"A big floral bouquet of flavors.  The malt character different this time. I get a big bitter bite, and the malt is nicely used in this imperial IPA."
""
""
"Overall: Starts off with lots of hops/bitterness.  Then fades into malt flavors and toasted grain. Excellent IPA and highly recommend for any IPA fan."
"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint. Pours a medium golden amber with a nice two finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange citrus, lightly floral. Flavor is hop forward with dry, piney and citrus hops, orange citrus, hint of dankness, light carmel malt, finishing with lingering resinous pine and grapefruit rind with hints of lemon and orange citrus. Medium bodied with active carbonation. A nicely made seriously hop forward IPA with a resinous, but not particularly herbal hop bill. The malt body was sufficient to support the intense hops, but was not in itself memorable. A quite enjoyable, well named hop bomb. I will not even try to taste another hoppy beer for a day or so. Life is good right now, though. It's been a while since I've had this, and there is a little sadness that it will be discontinued, but I have faith that Stone will continue to come through with worthy alternatives. RIP Ruination."

"Delicious to say the least. Easily paired with any hearty meaty meal and at 8.2% can easily knock you on your ass"

"sorry to see it go, hope 2.0 does it justice."

"Plenty of hops. Plenty of pine. A benchmark IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter with a slight floral note underneath. Decent color. Way more carbonation than I expected. Also: some sips have an almost mildly """detergent""" or dish soapy aftertaste. But very slight, and not enough for me to ding it too badly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect double IPA, just as the gods intended, loads of bitterness, let it warm and it becomes sweet.."
""
"Strong beer full of flavor and fairly bitter but in a good way. Hazy orange color. Nice bite."
"This is a good beer. stone isn't my favorite, I've had plenty better IPAs.  I've tried a few Stone beers and this was the first one I actually kind of liked, but I would prefer many others to this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A timeless classic. I'm gonna miss this one when they retire it."
""
""
"Nice gold color. Good flavor overall."
"Looks perfect pale and see thru the way a IPA should look with spotty lace.. A/T sweet pale malt, dry cracker, pine, citrus, slight pepper.. This is the definition of a IPA to me.. Lovely beer"

"Now I'm rambling. These problems are not unique to Stone. Many breweries face the same issues, especially in the more competitive markets. I bet Ruination 2.0 will be excellent anyway."
""
""
""
""
"I was surprised to read about Ruination's impending revamp, had to go back to it again seeing as how it had been a good 6-8 months since my last bomber.  What I had was a bottle dated enjoy by 5/6/15, poured to a snifter. Two finger head that laced beautifully.  IBUs are listed on bottle at 100+ and yeah this is one bitter beer.  Beyond the sharp bitterness I got a lot of that piney flavor, I just had a bunch of Alpha Kings a few months back and this reminded me of a """bigger""" version of that beer.  This is a classic but I respect Stone for rethinking some of their beers that have been around for a while that people might be taking for granted.  Hopefully version 2.0 does this one justice. RIP"

"The second best IPA next to Pliny the Elder."
""
"This was my first DIPA. Its been nothing but love ever since."
""
""
"One of the beers that turned me onto the ipa scene many years ago. Sad to see that Stone is changing up what at one time was the best beer I ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! I wasn't sure what to expect from this and man was I surprised. Very different, sets its self away from the crowd. Highly recommended"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light amber with sustaining creamy head and lace. Complex aroma hops giving off blanketing floral and fruity scents. Carmel malts hit the palate first, followed by strong and slightly earthy bittering hops. Sweet nutty flavors sneak their way through. Finishes dry on the palate."
""
""
"Overall, this is basically Stone IPA on steroids.  It's not too different except for being slightly hoppier and stronger.  No alcohol is perceptible, but I can tell it's stronger by the thicker body.  Very good beer.  Highly recommended for any IPA fan."
""
"Golden honey in color .light foamy head.minimal amount of lacing.goes down extremely easy.Very smooth and tasty.Prost!"
"Look was great! Smell didn't rip my taste  bud apart. Taste wasnt too good. Feel was ok. overall okay. I would drink it if someone gave it to me for free but other than that im not buying it again. People are way too hopped out and i am a hop lover!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stuff, I'm loving Stone and this is my favorite so far.  A lot of availability around me, I will buy a lot of it"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I would like to try a fresher one, as this one was actually quite close to its drink by date. Still thoroughly enjoyable. If you like bitterness, this one's for you. Even if you don't, its still worth a try."
""
""
"Just a little too bitter on the back end, but I want to try a fresher beer and see if that makes a big difference. Still an incredible beer and the smell is phenomenal."
"Stone never ceases to let me down to obtain a bomb hoppy beer!"

"Overall: A great beer for IPA fans. A ton of hops that drinks well."
"Pours a golden color with a two finger white head.  Aroma is hops, bread, and resin.  Taste follows with bread, resin, some pine, and a big bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium and mouth coating.  Overall, it dies what it says, ruins your palate for the time being."
"Clear golden pour with thick, clinging head. Heavy pine, with some nice malt comes through to the nose. The hop bitterness is perfect in flavor, and again well-balanced by a bready taste. The lingering aftertaste is a bit much, and really my only complaint. Very well done overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For some this will be too strong of a taste. Lots of hops which I'm into, if you're not a hoppy guy then stay away. This thing has a great smell and gnarly taste."

"A level of bitterness to satisfy just about any hophead. I'll take this one whenever I can get it. I've found its best in a bomber. For some reason, in a 12oz, it doesn't have quite the effect or consistancy from my experience, but I suppose it could have been sitting on the shelf longer. The look is almost terrifying as the taste. The descriptions on the back of all Stone bottles is half worth the cost...I'm starting to wonder if they really are written by demons..."
"It's a fine brew, maybe I'm just burned out on the never ending list of IPA's.  Plenty hoppy."

"Way better than Stone IPA, but still leaves an aftertaste that i still dont like. Good beer otherwise"

"What needs to be said...with the beers in this class it all comes down to preference...and there are so many great ones...this is no exception!"
"This may be the gold standard for super hoppy ales, for many.  I think its an open forum, with few contenders.  Definitely a must try for hop heads and, like all Stone beers, its huge hop bitterness is balanced by a letting the malts shine through early and late in the tastes.  Right on - my only complaint is that this could be even more hoppy if it were to live up to its name.  I would compare this to favorably with Six Point's Resin but put it below Green Flash West Coast IPA.  There is something a little commercial to the flavor, too smooth so to speak, that is also present in most Stone beers.  Green Flash seems to pulls better/truer malt flavors than Stone, which is chiefly why I rank that beer higher."

"One of the better, easily accessible DIPAs in rotation. I absolutely love this one."
""
""
"O-I recommend this beer, a solid IPA, thank you Stone."
""
""
""
"The hops were, indeed, ruinous."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pine resiny hoppiness. Still, very well balanced and not overly bitter or spicy. Citrusy with just a note of sweetness. A bitter, slightly metallic aftertaste. A definitive West Coast IPA."
""
""
""
"Great citrus hops aroma, but the bitterness is just over the top for me.  This is a tasty IPA that would be great with a more balanced finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a good one for hops lovers. Super hoppy, but flavorful. The smell got me excited to take my first sip. Not perfect overall, but damn close for what you pay."
""
""
""
""
"Similar taste to most Stone brews. It was very heavy and full filling"
""
""
""
"Oooh the hops.  The hops.  The hops."
"A longer bitterness in the aftertaste than my favorite Stone strong ales, but a great malt/rye balance nonetheless. Hops off the chart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first sip of this IPA was a shock but I found myself wanting more and more of it. A great IPA for sure."

"prost LampertLand"
"Had this on tap at the Twisted Root. Really sessionable. Not much sweet, crispy refreshing bitter and hop forward. A thirst quenching IPA."
""
"Overall, this isn’t worth the time. Not well-balanced and just too harsh in terms of bitterness. The beer gets thick and overcoats the palate. The beautiful citrusy nose isn’t allowed to shine… Bummer. This really doesn’t pair too well with that many foods, but If I was to pair food with this beer, I would have to go with a spicy bowl of ramen. The spiciness will help compete with the level of bitterness of this beer.  I give it a 79/100."
"very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid west coast IPA, these guys started it all"
""
"Big citrusy hops with some grass notes, a touch of alcohol, pale malt, and light fruit on the nose. I have several of these and most pour amber with a slight haze that grows brilliant as the beer warms. Occasionally I get one that is cloudier but it is still good. The 1""" creamy, off-white foam collar produces thick sheets of lace that break into classic gothic cathedral window designs as they dissipate. A rich hop palate with some citrus rind bitterness rides on a solid malt backbone seasoned with yeast driven fruit flavors and a hard to pin down spiciness that give way to long, lingering hop aftertastes. An initial sweetness tempers the hops. Medium body to a little above and medium low carbonation. A true classic."
"O - The aromas are superbly balanced and inviting.  However I don't think the flavors live up to the promise.  For me this beer is over the top on hops sensations and flavors when a double IPA should have more malt to balance.  Not the best of the breed in my opinion, but still enjoyable."

"Really great hoppy taste with a slight boozy taste. Not too much malts either which is great. Very refreshing on a hot day. Very crisp. The only problem is that it leaves a bad after taste in my mouth"

""
"overall: I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  Not in the upper echelon of great DIPAs, but still very good.  Would like to try it on tap...."
""
""
"O: Maybe I just happen to prefer more aromatic/floral/balanced DIPAs, but this was very underwhelming. In no way do I find this to be world class, as to me it simply comes off as another bitter West Coast hop bomb. But... if thats what you are looking for, then I imagine it is good for what it is."

"I'm an up and coming fan of IPA's. That being said, I was really disappointed with this beer. Far too bitter, and no hint of citrus whatsoever. That's just me though."
""
"Idiosyncratic - not a daily drinker for me - but the quality shines through."
""
""
"Pours slightly hazy golden into a std pint glass.  Small head with low retention. Some nice yet light lacing.  Beautifully balanced lightly citrus/pine hop aroma with a touch of nice earthiness.  The taste is very well balanced.  Not overly bitter and leaves you wanting another sip. Sip is the keyword as a few of these will really slow you down.  Mouthfeel is beautifully round and balanced.  When I am stacking beers to drink, I always leave this one for last.  It tastes great regardless of what you drank before and after you drink this, other beers are underwhelming.  There are other beers that are more floral in aroma and taste, but none have this balance.  If you like nice top-end DIPAs, this is a must try.  Excellent beer."

"Ya know...the name says it all. The text on the bottle about the name really says it all. Between this and Hop Stoopid I dont think any other beer will ever appeal to me. I am truly """Ruined"""."
""
"O: My palate has been """ruined""". I wonder if you can drink this as a mouthwash?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a stellar DIPA. Cloudy amber color. Perfect citrus and pine combination in the nose and mouth. Sticky sweet but just the right amount of carbonation to make you want the next mouthful. Great beer!"

"Pours a golden orange with a one finger, eggshell white head. The aroma is all citrus. Grapefruit, lemon zest, orange, there's a hint of bubblegum and a good amount of malt sweetness. The flavor is very bitter, but the citrus from the nose remains very present. There us a resin aftertaste that lingers, but I like it. Very solid DIPA."

"O:  good and I can see why it rates so high because the DIPA lover gets everything they want on the mango/caramel end of things with this one.  my taste and overall numbers will be a bit off that because I hate the mango/caramel end, much prefer the citrus/grapefruit, but hey ... I can still admit this a well-made beer and more than that, I can tell how it's one of the blueprints for the craft beer craze -- at least half of the DIPAs I've tried taste just like this one"
""
""
"Stone Brewing has recently become available in a two provinces in Canada. This is my first Stone beer. Poured into my Odell Brewing tulip glass bought at the Odell a Brewery in Ft. Collins :-) Truly excellent beer! Nicely hopped with a smooth finish. One of the best DIPAs I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very, very, very well made. It is perfect, given its ABV%. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect score is because I wouldn't drink this casually. (This has to do with factors of price, general availability, and others.) The demon mascot on the bottle bodes well with the devilishly bitter hops, and its ability to disguise the alcohol. Long live Stone Brewing Co.  \m/ >:} \m/"

"overall its a great beer, but i feel like there are far greater West coast IPAs than this that get much lesser ratings."
""
"Gold and Orange pour. Big ol' fat smell of piney hops. The taste is straight up hops all the way. A nice bitterness from start to finish. This is just a flat out great beer. It is straight forward with no bells and whistles. It is another great beer from Stone."

"Pricey 4 12 oz. pack is like buying 2 bombers of Stone Enjoy By, which I happen to prefer more than Ruination,and makes me glad I split the 4 pack with my neighbor. This is worth trying, but I don't find it approachable enough to get such high ratings, make up your own mind."
""
""
"A little overwhelming at the start but the finish is unbelievable. I bought a bomber and poured into a pint glass. I don't have the nomenclature a lot of reviewers have but this is a great Double IPA. I normally don't enjoy doubles because they end up being too sweet but this one is fantastic."

"I was very disappointed in this beer, I paid $10. For a bomber , I didn't get any citrusy notes from the hops, I am a fan of hoppy craft beer, this beer shouldn't even be considered craft, sorry stone, maybe I got a bad bottle? I am blown away by the high scores it got, I don't think I will try it again at $10. A bomber for swill."

"Overall - A stellar DIIPA from Stone. All fronts were well executed that make this a true stand out. I enjoyed the finish in this brew - nice bitterness from the hops and bitter grapefruit rind. This is a definite seek out who like their very bitter DIIPA's vs the more balanced ones."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've noticed that this IPA has gotten rave reviews but here's my grain of salt. It does sell as a very hop forward beer and believe me when I say I truly love IPAs. But just like any other beer, a good IPA has to be balanced. This Ruination IPA is everything but balanced. It is very bitter yes (which I don't mind), but the aromas are simply off. Yes it is 100 IBU and so what? I had many other high IBU IPAs and believe me that it is a fine art to balance them. This one is not."

"Poured into a tulip.  Nice golden color, a bit hazy, 2 finger head.  Floral, biscuity aroma.  Taste is very well balanced.  Slightly floral taste hinged by piney afterthoughts and just enough bitterness to knock it back down to enjoyable level.  Very well done.  Very easy drinking and satisfying beer."

"The beer poured a crystal clear golden amber with a decent white head.  The aroma was of grapefruit and citrus with a hint of tropical fruit and a sweet malt underneath.  The taste is aggressively hop forward and takes your palate on a hop journey from beginning to end.  After you get over the initial hop overload you get loads of citrus and grapefruit rind that peaks with a malt sweetness and ends with an intense pine palate coating.  The Ruination has a nice malty sweetness that helps balance the heavy hops and dry finish.  This is a top tier palate numbing hop bomb of a Double IPA.  Just because its readily available don’t overlook this excellent brew."

"Welcome to Alberta, Stone Brewing Co. And welcome to my belly, Ruination. A pale cloudy peach hue with some fluffy, frothy whitish head that coalesces down into a more manageable and firm puck floating on the top of the aromatic liquid below. Nice lacing on my mason jar style mug. Immense hoppy aroma, full of citrus rind, floral perfume, tropical fruit juice, and pine needles. A subtle sweetness almost like those candy cigarettes. Citric, floral, assertive yet not abrasive, almost cleansing in a way. As for the taste, believe the hype. I do not dole out perfect scores very often; in fact, this might be the first occasion. Basically the Platonic ideal of a DIPA. Comfortably medium-bodied and supremely smooth with gentle carbonation, incredible drinakability for such a big beer. Epic heavy duty marmalade citrus flavors, getting lots of tangerine, grapefruit, and lime, with a little sour lemon and green banana in the finish, along with further pineapple, papaya, and nectarine notes. So much rind and resin yet nothing coarse and astrigent .... Perfect sublime hop balance. Bready honeyed malts also make their presence felt although the citrus fruit keeps wrestling away my attention. Brace yourself for the finish, peppery resins and a huge pine bite, although again, somehow the beers falls just short of too much bitterness, reigning itself back towards a reassuring citrus/tropical vibe that one could exult in for days, liver permitting. Not much more to say ... Essential imbibing for the hop head and even the aspiring hop head ready to learn via experience (alternatively, I am a sadist for recommending a beginner try this ... You be the judge)."

"I recently tried this IPA for the first time and was not blown away by it.  While it is a great IPA without a doubt, and I am usually a fan of Grapefruit dominant IPA's, this one was just lacking character in my opinion. I find myself saying this again and again, but in a world stuffed with IPAs, I am on the hunt for my own perfect IPA! If you look through my reviews you will see I am a hard critic on IPAs but I have to admit for the price, I would buy it again."

"Make you smack yo mama (I hope not) IPA.  Super hoppy ipa.  Very strong.  Malty bready with that ipa burn.  Yet smooth and refined.  I am not a huge ipa fan but I Love this beer.  A few turn me into a puddle vomiting on a poker table.  Still good on 1-23-15."

"I love IPAs. Call me a wimp (I'm sure Stone would), but I don't think I could finish 22 ozs on my own, or at least not enjoy it all the way through. Even more intense than Lagunitas Hop Stoopid. Still, everyone should try it, and it's worth picking up from time to time when you want to knock out your taste buds."

"Overall (4.35): Very good DIPA and should please any hop head. With that said, its not particularly extraordinary. Doesn't set itself apart from the pack like my absolute favorites such as Enjoy By, Head Hunter, etc. It is however one of the better straight forward west coast ipas. Definitely rrecommended!"
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall: I expected much more from Stone, but this is still a fine IPA with some tasty, well executed elements. And yet, the beer feels like it was based on a good, yet unfinished recipe. Every element is lacking that extra characteristic required for making this something memorable."

"Big beer with lots of hops on the nose and citrus notes but balanced by big malt backbone. Almost chewy.  Glad I had it."

"T: Hits with a strong bitter punch, notes of dank and citrus. Surprisingly drinkable considering the high IBUs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Other than saying it's awesome, with a perfect name (hits hard) and a clever demon on the package that diabolically lets you know you're in for real ruination after a couple."
""
""
""
""
""
"I LOVE the high IBU with alcohol still 8.2%. My kind of DIPA. Very drinkable. Good clarity. Piney Citrus flavor and smell. Delicious. So Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  The Aroma of this beers really shows off the amount of hopping going into it.  The most noticeable thing about this DIPA is how dry it finishes.  I wouldn't say it finishes clean since there is a decent amount of hop resin feel on the tongue afterwards, but it finishes so dry I'm ready to take another sip.  I want to pair this with some really flaky fish and a spicy gumbo."

"Hop burn in a bottle :). The aroma is dank hops, tangerines, orange juice and a earthy tone finishes. Taste follows the aroma, dank hops start then the citrus shines bright. Orange peel bitterness and a tobacco after taste lingers for a while. No alcohol is present. This is a liquid poem to the glory of the hop. There is enough Alpha Acids in this brew to leave me satisfied. This is highly Recomended."

"Pours a rich golden color, simple at a glance with nice clarity. Soft thin white head blankets the top for a few moments before drifting to the edges and floating on top like a halo. Rope lacing coats my mug 360 degrees. Hops are direct and powerful in this classic styled IPA. Slightly sweet citrus on the finish. A tasty bitterness never leaves the tongue. The feel is bubbly and tingly on the tongue with a more than moderate amount of dryness on the finish. The alcohol is not as pronounced as I expected considering the 8+ abv. Well done on this quality offering from Stone."

"Appearance was good with an orange hue with a light head that dissipated quickly. The smell was full of citrus and grapefruit. The taste was similar with hops being the main focus of the brew with very little else interfering. Clearly a love letter to the flower. The mouthfeel was nice with a strong beginning and becoming refreshingly light in the end. Overall a very good beer with a clear message."
""
""
""
"This beer took the Stone IPA and took it to the next level. Color and head are fine, taste is amazing. Hop lovers rejoice, citrus, pine, grapefruit and more make this a go to IPA for true hop lovers. How can u get any better, It may be hard !!!. Keep up the great work, the bitterness and citrus combination is perfect, plenty of alcohol but not too much, awesome piney brew!!!"

"Much maltier than expected. Bitterness and sweetness battle to achieve dominance. Not in a balanced way. Not crazy about this sweet, bitter IPA. A little sweet for my tastes, despite the bitterness. It's not my cup of tea, altogether. Too sweet and simultaneously too bitter... Not balanced for my preference...."

"A very solid strong IPA with great flavor, presentation, aroma, and feel. It's not especially unique or complex, just above average across the board. Drinks very easy if you like a punch of hops and well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"This pours a clear golden color. I get a big aroma that’s both piney and bitter, with a bale of grass and straw thrown in for kicks. Intensely hoppy and with a drying finish that doesn’t keep me from sipping. Ruination doesn’t disappoint in the least."

"O - I have been waiting to review this one until I could find it fresh in my area. Typically the bottles that sit on the shelves around here are approaching/past their expiration dates. I jumped at the chance to get a growler filled. This is a beer that others in the style should be measured against. Great hop presence, but not overpowering. Although the aroma is the highlight, all of the other aspects are well above par. This will continue to be one of my go-to IPAs, when I can find it on draft or fresh in the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - This is one of the best IPAs that I've had. Unbelievable tasting hops with nice malt flavors. My only complaint is that the hops are so strong that there's not really any other taste, but for what it is - a classic West Coast IPA, I would put this again any of them."

"O: I realize this is an old recipe here - but it's a good one!... pretty straight-forward, but lovely, West Coast hop character... way better than their IPA and AB, but retains a similar thread of hop flavor and bitterness with them, as well as many of their other offerings... now all that's left to do is find a fresher bottle..."

"Bottle. Extremely clear. Lots of lacing on the glass. First taste is like a normal extra IPA. As soon as it gets to the back of the mouth, it turns super bitter. It's like biting into a lime or grapefruit rind. The super-bitterness comes only after the swallow. No hint of the near 8% alcohol. Amazingly smooth. Extremely crisp, extremely hoppy ale. It's worth the $8 for the 22oz bottle. But only once. I had to taste this beer and it was worth the price. You will buy this once, but if you like this beer, you will settle for the SN Torpedo or the Founders Centennial IPA. The 100+ IBUs don't show up until after you swallow. Crisp, clean, bitter. Excellent beer. Just didn't live up to the hype. Close, but not quite."

"Good Beer! Not as good as Ruination Ten, Go To IPA and not nearly as good as the Enjoy By... Out of all there IPAs I think this falls at the bottom along with there Cali IPA.. With that being said Stone is such a great brewing...That this beer compared to other IPAs is still good.. It has a dark golden look.. With a piney hoppy taste.."
"O: I think I prefer the regular IPA to this one, which is smoother and just more drinkable in general. Overall a tasty brew, but the bitterness keeps this from being a smooth drinker."

"Ruination was a big beer even before the change and remains so. It was very hard to note any significant changes at all. Despite Chinook being in the mix, the """pine factor""" did not seem to increase. While I think it isn't quite an elite DIPA anymore, Ruination is still a great showcase for extreme hoppiness."

"22 oz bottle split shared 2 Sam Adams Boston Lager perfect pour pints. Nose is citrus and malt sweetness. Appears clear with a good head that dissipattes after a few pulls. Tastes is upfront citrus hop and then the mouth goes a little bit more bitter. Mouthfell is soft and balanced but dries out. Overall not a bad beer. I need to try again to see if my palatte was off the first time or perhaps I had a slightly off tasting bottle. I can taste the potential for goodness."

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A classic from the Stone portfolio and I was happy to have it again. It is interesting how the more recently concocted IPAs and double IPAs contrast from this classic west coast American brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"IPA is my favorite style and yet I was disappointed with this highly acclaimed beer. Consumed in a tulip glass, there was way too little in terms of scent. Barely anything. Then the taste didn't blow me away either. It was good, just not worth what I paid. I've had over 10 other IPAs I'd reach for over this. Maybe it's old or something."
"Even though I'm still pretty new at this, this is the best beer I have so for. Looks awesome in the glass the pour. Instantly get a smell of hop/citrus when opening it. Smells so delicious when pouring and even better on the first sip. The hops hit you at first then malts and citrus. Has the good bitterness aftertaste. This is a great IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I just really don't like this one. Way too bitter for me, and without the juicy hop notes that I really like in some IPA's. It's just not my thing and I love Stone's Enjoy By. I'm not sure if there was an issue with my bomber, but this wasn't my cup of tea at all."

"Pours a pale gold, much lighter than most DIPAs, with a thick bright white head that dissipates slowly to a nice foam cap. Little lacing to speak of. The aroma is subtle, but definitely hints at the hop bomb that will assault the tongue. Lots of sweet tropical fruit and bitter, pithy grapefruit dominate with hints of other citrus and a hint of caramel. On the taste, there is a burst of sweetness followed by a wave of astringent bitterness. Ruination is aptly named, yet quite balanced thanks to the strong malt backbone. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Overall, a well crafted DIPA that truly is a """liquid poem dedicated to hops!""""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy sunset orange with a finger of bright white head and good head retention. The nose is full of citrus and other fruit: a big orange aroma, grapefruit, lemon, pear, pine needle, subtle black pepper, and a malt characteristic of biscuit and caramel. At the front of the tongue I get a nicely balanced grapefruit and biscuit malt taste, then this thing explodes into a resinous, earthy, dank assault on the palate. There's bitter herbal and pine notes on the end, which are cut by sweet caramely malt. Yes, it's an extremely hoppy beer, but it has plenty of balancing elements. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation."
""
""
"Overall a very good beer, although I prefer a DIPA to have more malt character then this one does."

"Poured from bottle to glass. Nice head, maybe 1/4""" thick. Wonderful bubbly foamy head with good lacing. Golden-yellow pour that looks delicious. Smell is citrusy and leaves you wanting to taste the beer as the smell isn't to strong. Taste is also citrus with a strong mouthful of hops. Presence is great not to bitter or much bite on the back of the tounge from the hops. Wonderful beer not only to recommend but to drink again and again."
""
"My favorite all-time beer to date. Hoppy deliousness. Great taste. Great finish. Doesn't get much better this. If you enjoy DIPAs and hoppy IPAs. then you will enjoy this. Very hopforward with the perfect amount of bitterness with a piney, citrusy finish."

"O - overall, as expected very enjoyable stone quality. Great fresh hop nose and flavor with a sticky and sweet body. Finish is clean but a little sweet and less bitter than I would expect. Great example of the style only thing i wish is it would be a little more attenuated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very nice all around, not sure how it ranks in a now-crowded field (of overhopped IPAs) but certainly worth getting."
""

""
"I am a fan of Stone and some of their other brews just feel this one is not what I was expecting. ;-("
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A smooth ale that goes down easy. Not insanely complex but a good example of the style. Stone knows how to make a brew right. My palate was not """ruined""" as the name implies but the humorous labels Stone comes up with adds to the likeability in my opinion. A great choice for one seeking a quality DIPA with good floral hop qualities."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, a bit of malts. Taste is hoppy, bitter, piney, caramel malts are present, well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, and enjoyable beer, but didn't live up to the hype, in my opinion."

"O: I've gotta hand it to them... Stone may be arrogant, but it's rightfully so. I'm starting to believe these guys (and gals) can do no wrong when it comes to beer. Ruination is another example of a world-class IPA and is anything and everything a hophead wants. Simply scrumptious."

" I hadn't tried this one since I last tasted it and my how the palate changes and appreciates a solid IPA. Grapefruit, piney and grassy. Very well hidden alcohol , one of the very best I've had in a little while now. In the world of IPA's this one is in my top ten easily. Very tasty and very hoppy I just can't believe I hadn't tried this one in five years. Awesome stuff."

"EBD 1/14/14 Light amber pour with a light red cast. Well formed head with lasting lacing. Nice nose of citrus and pine hops against a toast and caramel sweet background. Light body with a smooth texture. Just enough carbonation to give a light effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is pretty much one dimensional - hop flavor (grapefruit over pine) flows to a prominent hop bitterness which resembles grapefruit rind. The malt is present, but only in a slight background fashion. The finish is all bitterness, but with a focus on the pine hop aspects."
""
""
""
"This ale pours a hazy golden copper color with a small short lived white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is just what it's namesake implies. ..ruining. it is super bitter with loads of citrus and pine hops. There is a slight malt backbone but it is subtle at best. The mouthfeel is traditional dipa, medium bodied and mouth coating. The flavor is everything the name and nose promises, nothing but palate numbing hoppy bitterness. Like being socked in the tongue by a lemon, a grapefruit, and a bag of pine needles. This beer is not well balanced nor well crafted, but it us exactly what it vows to be; an utterly mouth destroying, taste bud ruining hop bomb of an ale(imagine a less fresh version of Hopslam). This is by no means my favorite dipa or my favorite Stone offering or even something that I'd frequently return to, but it is exactly what it is meant to be. All others will effectively be ruined for the night following this. Not great but exactly what its meant to be...and then some."

"Had a lot of hops in the taste, but finished much smoother than I expected. If you aren't an IPA fan you won't really like this. But if you are, this is a great buy. I will definitely be buying more of these - very drinkable bomber and great to share."

"Has a little bit of grapefruit flavor, but this beer is all bitterness. Like the bottle proclaims, the bitter flavor dominates your mouth for a long while after you drink it. I admire and respect the beer, but I also have to admit it’s a bit much for me."
"Overall: not a huge Stone fan as I find the bitterness fairly harsh in many of their beers, but Ruination has just enough malt character to offset some of the grapefruit pith bitterness."
""
""
""
"pours clear yellow orange, white head, lots of lacing. calm appearance. inside flavor is raging. aroma is subtle but pleasant, sweet peachy note. flavor has a lot of grapefruit, maybe some lime. sweet underneath. always a strong malt backbone with stone."

"Pours a vibrant orange color with a finger’s breadth of fluffy white head. It dissipates over a few minutes, but leaves patches of bubbles scattered across the surface and wet heaps of lacing along the glass. The aroma is of citrus, stone fruits, and wet earth. Lots of earthen hops, pine resin, grass, and a bit of dank must. It tastes of bitter, earthy hops with a bit of spice. Loads of orange and grapefruit citrus up front with a hint of lemon towards the rear. All pine, grass, and bitter herbs in the middle. Mouthfeel is wet, lively and bitter. A bit resinous on the finish, but it cleans up quickly. Overall, this is a great DIPA that is - in true Stone fashion - aggressive with the hops in an entirely pleasant way."

You can't really go wrong with stone and this was a solid offering. Not BAD by any means, not my preferred style of IPA i usually go for..I myself prefer there regular IPA over this...but then again everybody has there own preference, and thats what makes this website frigin awesome.

"O-Worthy of praise. Expected a bit more. Will buy again. Not sure if four should be priced as a sixer. But this is a Super DIPA. I wish the bitter-to-citrus transition was more smooth. But it works with the """one-two punch""" style. The cheddar funk makes me want to pair Ruination with a cheese plate. If you're not a craft drinker this will give you a sour face, (maybe even craft drinkers). This is not a gateway beer. I stress this because we may lose potential craft newbies if we beer advocates don't give them say a regular Stone IPA as liquid training wheels. Great beer for those who like bitter yet citrusy flavors combined with a """can't put my finger, nose and tongue on this funk""" taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Personally I like this a lot more than Stone IPA. It has surprisingly few rough edges for such a big beer, just a massive amount of delicious flavor and a malt profile that almost perfectly complements the avalanche of hops in the finish. Probably my favorite IPA/DIPA that is widely available."

""

"Powerfully bitter aroma, with pine, fruit, and caramel malt. Flavor is bitter but surprisingly smooth, with some caramel and bread hanging in there with the flowery, fruity, pine bitterness. More bitterness in the finish, along with peppery spice and some drying alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Shines a dull, light copper hue like muddled gold. Herbal, resiny nose that's followed by an alcohol smell, burnt sugar and almonds beneath both. Huge grapefruit flavors in the mouth; sweet fruit and pith bitterness. Pithy bitterness lasts into a sweet, marzipan flavor, ending on a very bittersweet note. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. Extremely aggressive and typical of Stone. Not my favorite IPA but it gets the job done right."

"O - I think a person really owes this beer a fair chance, pour it into it's proper glassware. I had this straight from the bottle and I must admit, I found it very overwhelming. There was way too much too much happening at times, it felt as if someone was pouring cigarette buds on my tongue, then like I was walking through a tree lot, to you name it. However, when I poured this into a tulip glass, I got the full aromas, the head retention, and this beer definitely transformed like a Cinderella story. The only thing missing is that resin; that beautiful resin that us hopheads have come to know. This is the only thing missing to me. I wish Stone offered Ruinten year-round along with this. Ruinten, is the complete version of this, a great fusion of an Enjoy By with Ruination characteristics. This is a great start, get through this, and you are ready for the DIPA world."

"This is a beer I've had many times before but I've never really gotten around to reviewing it for some reason. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Not much of a head but a nice copper color with good clarity. Citrusy hops, orange on the nose, resinous and hoppy with some distinct sweetness from the pale and carmel malts. Smells great! The taste is quite hoppy all around but very good. A generous amount of bitering hops on the start, this is cut by the sweetness of the malts as the sugars and alcohol coats the tongue mid palate and ends with another hoppy bite of bitterness. Not exactly a session beer but absolutely delicious especially if you like a nice hoppy brews. I certainly like my brews nice and hoppy so this is hitting the spot."

"This beer is very balanced, the malt notes play of the hop bitterness very well. It sits close to the edge of greatness for me, but it still has a ways to go. I wouldn't put it ahead of some of the major players, but it can stand on its own."
""
"Overall this is an outstanding IPA. I with absolutely be coming back to this one. Fantastic!!"
""
""

"Pours a clear copper color with a small head that fades to some lacing. The aroma is is a blend of citrus and pine, with a trace of of fruit in the background. Taste leans towards pine, with just a trace of sweetness. Has an ideal bitterness and a surprisingly dry finish. Medium body, crisp smooth and refreshing. Great balance with no hint of the 7.7% ABV. This beer sets a good standard to compare other DIPAs to. Well worth checking out."
""
""
"O - good drinking but am left wishing I had bought earlier."
""
""
""
"For what it is trying to do, this is a very good beer. But my problem with this and so many Double IPA's is the very American sensibility of excess. Just because a beer has a lot of hops, does not mean it is great."
""
"This IPA wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Appearance was great. Orange and clear with 2 fingers of frothy head. Overall taste and smell seems rotten in every sense. It tastes like rotten tomatoes except hoppy as all hell. Not watery yet surprisingly smooth. It might have been just a bad batch, but this is my review."
""
"Overall: Stone makes some fantastic IPAs. Not sure why it took me so long to try this one, but I'm a fan. Think I prefer their Enjoy By and definitely their RuinTen more, but this one is certainly a home run as well."

"Very solid DIPA, nowhere near the best that I've had, but given that this is a shelf beer and is usually found fresh when its on the shelf, it's really not a bad purchase at all. Focused on the bitterness and the explosiveness of the hops, it's the strong malt backbone that balances the entire beer out that is a pleasant surprise."

"O - A decent IPA. I know I do not like it as much as others as it just simply doesn't fit my taste for what I look for in an IPA (I prefer less lingering, dull bitterness and more bright citrus). With that said, I can see why others like it so much. Clearly it is well crafted."

"Multiple bottles, multiple tap pints. Clear orange pour. Massive eggshell, rocky foam. Big lacing. Nose is hefty citrus peel, grapefruit, honey, resin. Taste follows suit: resinous, powerful grapefruit bitterness, stickier honey. When its not super fresh, it will devolve into something nutty and abrasive and overly sticky. Sort of the opposite approach to IPA as Hill Farmstead. Aggressively bitter to near abrasive rather than quenching and soft."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and an above average example to the style, the hops were highlighted just like they should be and the hop profile was nice, but it didn't come together as great as some of the better beers of the style. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink two of these but I'm not sure that taste would make me want to have another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, I thought they were both pretty good and they worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the onion and garlic like hop profile, I don't mind a little bit of it in my DIPA's but it seems just a little too heavy handed in this beer. I would buy this beer again, and I will be on the look out for a fresh bottle to compare this to and so I can update this review. I would recommend this to any DIPA fan. All in all I liked this beer, but I wasn't crazy about it, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style, but it was still just a little rough around the edges and I think that prevented it from being as good as it could. Stone is one solid brewery and this beer is a good example of that, keep being yourself Stone."

"O - Feel like I am short-selling this beer based on the length of my review... this beer fully delivers on the promise of the """glory of the hops.""" it does not deliver peripheral tastes and smells as valued in some other beers, but delivers on its promises. Wonderful beer when other seasonals are not available, i.e Ruin Ten."

"Sitting on my couch watching Battlestar Gallacta, I give this beer a 8.7 out of 10"
"Its all in the name. A complete takeover of any other taste in your current pallet. A complete hop BOMB. I poured this from the bottle into a chilled pint. With a standard pour, I yielded a very decent 1-1/2 fingers of head, which was just orange of white and a diluted amber color. The head quickly gave until it was about 1/2 a finger thick and left slight lacing, but nothing to write home about. The head stayed until the end, it should be said. Flavor follows the nose, and just as I thought it would, Ruination proceeds to wreck the palate at first sip. It's very bright, and makes it hard to pick out the flavors and components once you've begun. Some would say it grabs your attention, I prefer to say it kills any possibility of enjoying other beers after this one (at least in the same evening). Make sure to seek this out."

"Overall: A great IPA that is nicely balanced, exhibiting great biscuit malt character that then succumbs to the piney and citrus hop flavor and gripping bitterness as any good IPA should. A great addition to any IPA oriented pick six."

"Medium+ bodied with a long finish based on the bitterness."

"Compare to RuinTen - Appearance looks like it was pretty much the same. Smell must have been pretty much the same too (Ruination does have a hint of garlic, maybe not as much since I didn't notice it until smelling it again). Taste also is the same, just a little stronger overall with RuinTen. Mouthfeel - RuinTen was definitely stronger in hoppiness and alcohol content. Overall - I'd say considering ABV the beers are almost exactly equal. If you're looking for a little more bang for your buck in ABV then grab the RuinTen if it's available. Taste is very similar - RuinTen is just the amped up version."

"Overall I guess I was expecting something very different. It was very floral bit not bitter enough for what I paid and was expecting. The smell is defiantly something I want to explore more. Not close to my any of my favorite IPAs but its very drinkable. I like it but at close to $5 a bottle, if rather have a 90 min IPA and keep the change. I will give this another shot though."

"O: It seems like it would be very easy to pick Stone IPAs out a lineup given how their yeast is one of a kind. I remember when this beer used to kick my ass; now I realize it’s just not my kind of thing. Stone needs to tame the alcohol in these beers."

"A: Dark gold with lots of visible floaters, thin head that dissipated quickly – 4.00, S: Tons of soft bubble gum along with a wallop of grapefruit, very nicely hopped with a subtle malty sweetness, the nose is mellower than I’d expect for a double IPA and from Stone who never shies away from the hops – 4.00, T: Lots of pine and grapefruit, similar to the nose this is a little mellower than expected for a double IPA, some biscuity sweetness and warming alcohol – 4.25, M: Mouth feel doesn’t normally jump out at me but this one has an extremely smooth and creamy flow, very nice all around – 5.00, D: As the above statements will indicate, this isn’t your typical double IPA but it is an outstanding IPA – 4.50"

"O: My understanding was that this beer was supposed to be undrinkable because it was so bitter. Not the case at all. A very, very good borderline DIPA. believe the general rule 8% ABV to be a DIPA and this falls just short. Nonetheless, this one feels very balanced and is good for any occasion. This actually feels light enough and is drinkable enough to be sessionable."

However, it is a fabulous beer to sit and sip, so yeah...it could turn into a session before you know it. It certainly did with me. Ruination is another great beer from what is quickly becoming my favorite brewery. Go buy this beer. NOW!"

"Poured into tulip; crystal clear light orange with a fluffy white head that sticks around for a long time, super tight and excellent lacing. Smell is a nice blend of piney hops and juicy citrus flavors. Some alcohol peeks though the hops, and only a small hint of malt makes the journey. Taste is spicy bitter piney hops right off the bat, smoothing into some softer citrus flavors and crackery malt with some leftover hop resin flavors blend with the well-hidden alcohol. I still consider myself a hophead, but lately I've moved away from beers like this. Overall though, it's an amazing beer regardless; right on the line between a crazy IPA and a tamer DIPA. Great hop character, I just wish it was a bit more balanced. But it never claimed it was balanced, so it achieves what it sets out to do."
"Really is a great beer, packs a ton of punch at 7.70 %, kind of on the edge between a great DIPA and a rediculous IPA. First time I had it the beer was a little out of date, happily surprised with how muich I enjoyed this fresh one."

"O: Eighteen months ago, this kicked my ass, and made me come back for more. Nowadays, my palate isn't raped, but that just means I can enjoy all the hoppy goodness that much more. Even if some of Stone's one-offs (I'm also looking at you, Stone IRS) are wildly inconsistent, their mainline of brews are usually rock-solid. This being no exception. Actually, I'd call Ruination the best of their regulars."

"The taste backed up the smell - right up front hop. As one would expect, it is bitter, but the malt bill balanced out nicely against it, especially for a 100+ IBU beer. A slight aftertaste is all that kept me from ranking it a full 5 in taste. Don't take that wrong, though. This is one of the best IPAs I've had, and it was well worth the hefty price of admission (case was almost $70 with tax)."
"Not as flavorful as the nose implies it's gonna be but definitely a smooth beer. Pungent hop resin bitterness up front. Tropical fruit flavors but no sweetness. Bitter throughout but not overly so. Malt flavor detected but again, adds no sweetness, just seems to mild down the bitterness. Some burnt toast crusts with raw hoppy leaf flavor and tropical fruit. Bit of detectable alcohol. A really nice drinking beer for those that do truly love the flavor and bitterness of hops. Again, not overly bitter but bitterness persists in a really nice way. A little rough around the edges, a little simple, and a little too much detectable alcohol for the abv but definitely for those who love the hop."

"o: A superior IPA, not quite a hop bomb but considerable enough hop presence to be outstanding over the considerable supporting malt base. Not a session brew at 7.7 ABV (not to mention price), but the kind you roll out on special occasions and savor."

"O - it took one sip for me to fall in love with this brew. A so readily available dipa packing all this delicious flavor? How could one not love Ruination. A true West Coast Gem and a tribute to what the Stone Brewing Co is all about. I can enjoy this literally any time I want to and that's enough to put a smile on my face. It shows that Stone has been and always will be in the top tier of the world's greatest breweries. Well done."
""
""
""
"A pretty extraordinarily balanced offering from Stone, in spite of its undeniable prowess in terms of displaying the brewery's talent at showcasing their hops and big, earthy malty notes. This is very floral and citrusy as I remember it, but I forgot how easy it is to drink compared to other readily available DIPAs. The hops are strong but by no means assault the palate, as the malts hold the fort with juiciness, and it is only semi-dry in feel, as well as not being as alcoholic as others in the style. I should be kicking myself in the face for not buying more single bottles of this in the past. At $3, this is a bargain indeed. Excellent stuff."

"O: Wonderful IPA. Would absolutely have again (and again) just by itself or with any fatty food. For me, this is what an IPA should taste like. It was one of my firsts, and it still is as great as I remember many beer experiences later."
"Overall, this is an uneven experience. But, impatience, in this case, is a virtue. Diving into the liquid itself is so rewarding, that the shortcomings of its appearance and scentscape are forgotten. This is more than just a good IPA, and memorable in ways that just flavor descriptors don't quite capture."
""
""
""

"O-My favorite DIPA. A lot of nuance and depth to this brew, but every aspect makes itself known. The hops, grapefruit, and semi-bitter citrus fruits balance well with the bready backbone."

"I had the Ruin 10 before having this beer. It is different than most Stone beers which is what I am sure makes it one of their better sellers... Similar to the 10 it has a destinctive hop presence and nice color. Taste is hoppy with a bitter bite when going down... Nice beer... Will buy at bevmo if on the shelf for under $6 a bomber"

"O: Now that I have a bit more context, this beer makes more sense. Yes, it's incredibly hoppy, but it's also incredibly malty. As hopped out as it is, it still maintains a strict sense of balance with the malt profile. However, this huge malt bill doesn't tip the scales in the body of the beer. It's medium bodied and (somewhat) refreshing on the palate. Deliciously complex beyond the bitterness, this beer is amazing."

"Alternately sticky and creamy somehow. Sharp and abrasive bittering hops throughout. Hop oils seethe along the tongue and seek out every last taste bud. It's a war of attrition and Ruination is fuckin' pissed. The teasy coquette of citrus that flashed her goodies on the nose has been summarily taken by a marauding gang of pine needle dicked hooligans. The image I'm left with is the inside cover of Appetite for Destruction. You know what I'm talkin about, and damn if that didn't tickle your pickle as a middle school skater shithead."

"Poured into a tulip it’s spun gold, clear with a 2 finger head, decent retention and has champagne bubbles rising from the bottom. Delectable hops nose with a good bitterness up front. Fruits are tropical, piney. Sticky lacing and good malt underneath. Finely carbonated and a medium light body. Lots of oily bitterness and a strong finish. This beer bombs your taste buds and that’s no lie. Pair it with subtly sweet foods because it’s superbly bitter."

"Overall This is most definitely my favorite beers by Stone Brewing Co. It is also definitely one of my favorite DIPAs. It is perfect for any hop head, but for others it tends to be really bitter. The more I drink it. The sweeter it gets. This is, at the moment, my favorite DIPA no doubt about it. I just wished they made an unfiltered version. I love being able to see those little hop particles floating around in my glass. I"

"O: Haven't tried other Stone IPA's, but would say this is fairly representative of a California IPA... It has an amazing smell, looks great and overall tastes pretty good, though I did find how it changed over temperature a bit of a downside. Overall a well balanced beer that leans towards I feel a more malt forward DIPA, that has plenty of hops but is not as smooth or complex as some of the big named DIPAs. A solid offering though."
""
""
"O - I prefer this to Stone's IPA; the malts are definitely subdued, and the hops are clearly center stage. However, I don't like it nearly as much as their Enjoy By; some sweetness would give this beer a nice complexity that would improve the experience tremendously (for me). As it is, it's a beautiful, extremely bitter beer, somewhat limited in flavor profile (one obvious hop profile for me, one subdued caramel malt profile)."

"Overall: One of my favorite hop bombs, if you like bitter simcoe hoppiness (floral and tropical notes), you will love this. I prefer the Stone IPA over this because it's a little less bitter and allows the fruitiness to come through more. Still, this is a benchmark by which other DIPAs should be judged."

"I can't count the number of times I've had this beer and I still can't believe I've never reviewed it. Well I guess now is the time. It pours a hazy amber-yellow with a white head about a finger thick that slowly fades to a thin lacing. The smell is straight up piney goodness with hints of grapefruit and citrus. The taste is pallet crushingly bitter. But its more then that, there is a complexity you wouldn't think you would get from a hop bomb. Grapefruit is the predominate flavor with subtle malty notes still not lost amongst the hops. The mouthfeel is medium and approachable with a dry finish. Too often DIPAs are sweet and sticky. Overall I've always enjoyed this beer but now I've finally reviewed it."
""
""
""
"O: If it only tasted better, this really could have been an excellent beer. As it is, I'm ready to write this one off as another offering of Stone's that just isn't nearly as good as their best."

"Ruination is another beer from Stone that I definitely approve of. At $3.29 a 12oz bottle though, it's kind of hard to recommend, as there are plenty of IPAs, I think, that are just about equally as good (and more balanced) for about $2 a single or $10 a sixer. At the same time, Ruination has something about it that isn't quite like other DIPAs out there, so I'd definitely recommend trying it. Excellent beer, and the high ratings are justified, I think."
""
""
""

"O/D - I thought this was an IPA when I bought it but turns out it's a DIPA. Strong for the weaker of the styles, and probably appropriate for the bigger. A very well crafted IPA with massive yet restrained characteristics that are in your face, but not prohibitively so. Great all aspects. Sessionable yet deserving of attention and small sips."
"Overall a solid IIPA but not worth checking out. Instead, go for Lagunitas' Hop Stoopid for a much more balanced and flavorful option."

"O - Great IIPA. This was one of the craft beers that I feel in love when I initially got into craft beer and it continues to give me a hop dose that I yearn for. Good stuff."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."

"This is not as big of a hop bomb as Enjoy By, but I saw that as both a compliment and hit. For Stone beers, definitely try out Enjoy By, but on the regular, I would definitely prefer this. It’s so well balanced. One of the best Double IPAs out there."

"Stone, synonymous with aggressive. Nose hits you straight out of the bottle before the pour, but we'll get to that. Pours a semi-opaque foreboding copper. Head as thick as 270 traffic at rush hour. I practically stubbed my index finger taking a closer, textural observation. The nose, which has been begging for attention from the moment the cap came off, now receives its due. Intense florals and bitter citrus. Stubborn, but not obnoxious, carbonation envelops the mouth chamber. Taste confirms what the nose foretold. HOP to it now, o my tongue. The bitterness is modulating between different flavors in an amazing way. First sip lingered for nearly a minute. """A severe state of damage""" indeed. Hop-based wrecking ball."
""
""
"classic dipa. poured into a duvel tulip fairly aggresively making about 3 fingers worth of very tight bubbles and loads of lacing. smells so damn good a little malty toasted bread followed by loads of piney citric hops. taste follows the nose well malts hit first for a second then comes all them delicious hop flavors of pine, bitter citrus and some flowery notes. mouthfeel was medium, sorta creamy. a damn good beer that i could drink every day. stone can hardly do no wrong"

"Ruination by Stone Brewing Company pours a cloudy, orange color with a thin cream colored head. Citrus, piney, and floral hop notes create a wonderful bouquet for the senses. Slighty toasted bread flavors quickly yield on the palate for some serious hop bitterness. The onslaught of grapefruit and pineapple citrus, gooey pine resin, and grassy earthiness are quite welcomed as they are delicately balanced with the sweetness of the malt. Medium in both body and carbonation, Ruination comes out incredibly well-balanced."

"Overall: Great DIPA from Stone that would doubtlessly be a staple of mine if available as a six pack for $12 or so. Still a good value at $6 a bomber, but I just don't buy it that often. Hop Henge is better IMO and is at the same price point. Always like to grab a pint of this when it's on tap though."
"This brew is kick-ass and complex. Each swig brings something as yet-unnoticed. A bit of tobacco just as liquid touches taste buds. Lilac in the nose. The woody smoothness of single-malt liquor. Brown sugar. Lingering OJ. Perfume of the gods. I could go on for hours. Actually, if I had a keg of this IPA I could go on for days describing flavors, smells, feelings, and experiences. But now I shall just enjoy. For it is quite enjoyable."
""

""

"Overall: Finally after a long time I am giving Ruination what is due, a beer worth having and if not worth keeping. Enjoying this beer with some home made rib eye steak I honestly couldn't ask for anything better at the moment. Rich and strong, It is a little pricey but what good beer isn't nowadays. If you see it and have never had the luxury of trying it and you like IPAs this is a must grab. Salud!"

"Poured from 22 oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Hazy light amber with an inch of off-white head and heavy lacing all the way down. Smells like pine, citrus and...roses (first sniff only). This may be may favorite IPA to date. Wonderfully dry and bitter hop and citrus flavor, backed by a surprisingly solid malty backbone. The mouthfeel was just right, just enough thickness to give it some real substance, but stops well shy of being too syrupy."

"O: I was really looking forward to drinking this and it lives up to the hype. I'd like to try the regular Stone IPA for a comparison. I could see the bitterness becoming a little much after a couple. Maybe the regular IPA is toned back in that department? I've seen this beer put into the category of quintessential west coast IPAs and if this is any indication of them then I need to try more! Great beer."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 2/23/2013. Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pine, floral, honey, bread, grass, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, light honey, lemon zest, and piney spiciness. Large amount of floral pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pine resin, floral, grass, honey, bread, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Excellent flavor balance of citrus hop complexity and pine flavors; with big piney citrus bitterness lingering on the finish for a while as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with an extremely sticky, crisp, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Imperial IPA. Great intense hop flavor and balance with good complexity; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"I love this beer. It has a wonderful aroma of citrus and pine. The taste is of citrus and its dry and sour like grapefruit. The look of the beer is great with a amber golden color, a little cloudy, and some light lacing. The mouth feel is dry and it has great carbonation. Overall another great stone ipa. In other news i have read some low reviews on this beer that say i don't really like the style ipa...my question is why keep reviewing ipas....your super low reviews just hurt the rating.... does not make sense.. if you don't like curtain styles don't drink or review them... ok i am done with my rant..."

"O - the smell Of this beer is fantastic, and it's got a nice mouthfeel. But the taste is too overwhelming - this is a beer for only hardcore hop lovers."

"Hoppy! Nice IPA. Gold…coppery color, small finger depth of head that diminished quite quickly with no noticeable lacing. Aroma of spices…hint of brown sugar and bread and citrus grapefruit. Abundant flavor that has quite a bite in the after taste deep in the back of the throat. Spicy...citrus fruit with an immediate bitterness. HOPS are abundant!! they have a very green, leafy...bitter pine like taste..very light in the mouth. warming feeling when swallowed."

"Wow this beer rocks harder than Led Zeppein. It pours up a hazy gold with a nice one finger head, medium retention and lots of lacing. The nose is a powerful pleasing citrus, pine, floral, and malt. Taste is heavenly. It starts out sweet and malty with some notes of apple and of source the grapefruit. It gives way to a wonderful hop bitterness that seems to be just about right. Mouthfeel is very full and satisfying. This is one of the better DIPAs that I've had. I think only Pliny stands above it."

"A very good DIPA, but not the best around. In season, I'd never pick it over Abrasive, except maybe for cost reasons. Out of seasons, it doesn't measure up to Odell Myrcenary. So while it's quite enjoyable, I can't see myself drinking it very often."

"O: Overall, this is better than I remembered it. Really a nice job of bringing in your face bitterness, and impressive in that regard. But theres more to IPAs than bitterness, and this one doesnt bring much of those other components. Certainly a beer Id drink again, and if you have never tried it, its a must try. But its not something I go to often, and hell its probably not even in my top 5 favorite hoppy Stone offerings."
"Apprearance is nice, good looking orange/copper fluffy-head and sticky lacing:.smell is all pine and some hints of earthiness, foral and perfumy.taste is marvelous, a womderful hit of pine in the jaws on the start which quickly disipates to a mildly sweet malty apricot. Flavor, earthy too, hints of grass and dirt. Mouthfeel is light to moderate, and carbonation is moderate as well, which allows the flavors to pull through withh little to no biteyness on the finish. Overall a real """crowd-pleaser""". Venison, gamey red meat, stuffed goat cheese peppers, spicy food, bbq, and good year round iipa."

"Pours a cloudy, dark maize. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Suspended hops are present. Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hop oil, and hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. There is a noticeable bitterness and slight dryness. Tastes of citrus hops, hop oils, fresh hops, sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, weak appearance and blend, but good aroma and body."

"I was hugely impressed with this one. Definitely surpasses all of the other stone IPA variations that I've tried. I will be drinking this again."
""
"I was prepared for a hop bomb and, while it pays great respect to the almighty hop, everything works together to make this beer a very drinkable and well balanced tribute by Stone to this particular style."
""
"Appearance is like hay, slightly hazy, 1/2-inch head lazily turns to lacing which hangs in there until the final sip. Smell is a little musty and slightly sweet. Taste is not as bold as 100 IBU would convey, it's actually tamer than many New Belgium brews (such as Snow Day or Red Hoptober - two brews I use as benchmarks for IBUs) even though the NB offerings are much lower on the IBU scale. The grainy malt flavor doesn't fight the hops as much as balance them. The wonderfully bitter hops come in at the finish and beg me to drink more as if to even things out. Banana esters and mango dance on the middle of the tongue as I take a second sip. Mouthfeel is thick and wonderful, allowing the luscious fruity and grainy flavors to mingle and tantalize the senses. I believe this hop bomb is one of the top IPAs available and will definitely drink again."
""
""
""
"I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, so much so it inspired me to write my first beer review in almost four years. Another excellent Stone brew!"
""
""
""
""
"Taste: This boasts 100 IBUs, but this isn't so much an indication of ironclad bitterness as much as it is a dynamic, multi-faceted flavor. First thing that hits me is the aforementioned floral lemon zest, which is quickly usurped by a strong amalgamation of piney hops. Perhaps the best thing about this is the biting blast that hits the tongue immediately (it makes its way up to the base of the nose too; potent shit) and allows a slightly waxy mouthfeel to usher in the surge of flavors described above. Each sip brings something new to the table, this stuff is top-notch."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer would be really good with some spicy food. I enjoyed it, my only complaint however is it was a little one dimensional."
"I can see why hop lovers give this a world class rating. Me, I like my hops to be more subtle and balanced rather than the entire package. But when it comes to being an Imperial Double IPA it has to be one of the best anywhere."
"This is very drinkable for those who love extra bitter IPAs. This is going to be on the top of my list of favorites, and one of my most recommended."

The aroma is out of this world the minute you pour the ale and stick your mouth on the glass the hops assault your olfactory senses with everything that an IPA should be. You don't sip this ale you take a big gulp and when the clean citrus finish leaves your taste buds before you know it your mouth is requesting more....it's gone way too fast!"

"this is a good imperial ipa, but i think i like the regular stone ipa better. this one pours a mostly clear honey color, a tint of orange to it, and quite a nice sudsy head. the nose is all lupulin, hop essence, and a touch of fruit, maybe apples or something to this in smell only. flavor carries the big bold hop nose, but it also has a nice medium malt body underneath it. possible wheat additions become curious towards the finish, but this is a hop bomb all the way. it tastes fresh, almost as fresh as the enjoy by, but it lacks a real hop identity i think, i dont know which hops are used, but i know its not quite bitter, its not quite sweet, its just sort of hoppy, if that makes sense. good carbonation, sessionably smooth, lots of alcohol but it can hardly be tasted. overall an outstanding version of the style, but i think a more distinct hop varietal would really pop this beer off."

I imagined it differently, expecting it to be a little more like Hop Stoopid (the only other beer that I've had that can even touch such hoppy glory) but I'm glad I was wrong. It's good to see that this beer accomplished an extremely high IBU and a unique hop character, while avoiding being a copycat of any kind. There's no other beer quite like this, but again, I could say that about any Stone Brew. One of my new Top 5"

"O...this really lived up to the hype. I was worried that I would be dissapointed because I expected too much. I was wrong. This is a perfect example of what an IPA should be. High quality, great flavor. All around great beer. I will look forward to my next Ruination."

"Overall (4.0): I really do like this beer, and if it’s fresh it’s hard to beat if you’re looking for a hop fix. It’s pale, crisp, bitter as hell, and the hops linger for a long, long time. Generally I prefer IPAs to be just a bit sturdier and more dynamic, but to me this beer represents the classic West Coast-style American IPA hop bomb. Great out of the bottle, but even better on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty - a solid DIPA and possibly the best I've tried to date. The hops need no further introduction; they are the stars of the show. A lovely range of aroma hop flavours that blend together perfectly. The bitterness is powerful but never seems over the top, while the malt provides just enough sweetness to keep this brew from seeming one-dimensional. Ruination is a well-deserved title; it towers over many other IPAs. Superb - add this to your must-try list."
"I think I have been ruined by trying some amazing IPA's (pliny, heady, sculpin, hill farmstead stuff), this just wasn't doing it for me. Better than average but not really memorable."
""
"Probably the best tongue-scrapingly-bitter DIPA that you can get almost anywhere. If you haven't had this beer, I suggest that you try to find it. Be prepared to take a few days off from drinking after you have this one, you'll taste nothing but hops for a while."
""
"M - For something marked with over 100 IBUs it lacked serious kick. It's balanced and doesn't leave much for aftertaste aside of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tip: First relish the hoppy glory that is Ruination IPA without accompaniments. Then, try snacking on some dried fruits as you sip the beer. Dates, dark raisins, and currants make excellent pairings."

""
""
"A class act. Excellent from start to finish. Personally I would prefer more balance over the over-the-top hops. You should really be sure you're ready to handle this beer, a highly assertive IPA. Hops through the roof. But those who stick it out will enjoy an excellent D-IPA, great flavour, lasting finish, and admirable profile, just raucous enough without crossing into assaulting. Try it."

"Quite good and flavorful, come on, it's Stone here. Whats nice for me is the fact that the abv's are in a more tolerant area for me to handle."
""
"O - I did enjoy the hops taste and would recommend it to friends who like DIPA's. It wasn't my favorite, but much better than most. May need to try from a tap to see if there is any difference."

""
""

""
"It smells of citrus and pine, and tastes of apple, pine, and slight grapefruit. Not a lot to sense on the malt end, other than a very mild sweetness - it's definitely skewed toward the hop side of the flavor profile. It's good, but I still prefer more citrusy and balanced IPAs, like Pliny, Union Jack and Sculpin."
""
""
"I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this beer. Light honey color, and a burst of hops on the nose.The first sip is hop heaven, and it keeps getting better after that. Good balance of hops, with a citrus finish. I recently had the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA, and it was lemon, lemon, lemon, and more lemon. That one was a one time release, and fortunately the Ruination is much more balanced. Not too much pine in this one, very drinkable. For the money, I would probably just get the regular Stone IPA. Have I been ruined for other IPAs? Probably not, but this is one hell of a beer."

"Extremely complex flavors, a hop explosion. This was just awesome. I had no idea how much I liked hops until this beer entered my life. I already have a Furious clone homebrew kit on the shelf...so its next on my list to compare."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great beer for hop heads. I always like a hoppy beer, and a lot of IPAs have a really heavy malt characteristic that I'm not always keen on, so this is a pleasant surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I cracked this one open after letting it chill for only a couple of hours in the fridge. It's a good beer, just not something I'm looking for in an IPA. It's a bit too malty for my liking."

""

"The bottle cap reads something along the lines of """an ale on overdrive""" as was published by food and wine magazine. There might not be a better description than that as Stone's Ruination will knock you on your arse with with overblown hops and it won't quit until the very last drop. This beer is certainly not for everyone, as it will gladly blow the doors off your palate making other beers you try in a short timespan to seem utterly lifeless. That being said if hops are your thing this is one of the very best. The appearance was lackluster but everything else beats you into submission with relentless taste nose and feel. I have had ruination many times before and will many times again. It also serves as a great introductory lesson into the field of imperial IPA."
""
""
"I wasn't drinking this beer 10 years ago, but I can imagine it was so radical it blew minds. As it is, it's still a solid DIPA. Big flavors and big personality."

""
""
""

"This is the best of the Stone brews I've ever tried.... The appearance is a deep color with slight amber under light.... It has a nice and plentiful head.... The taste seems hoppier than that of the """Levitation""" with citrusy hints.... It has such a delightful nose of deep citrus notes with an aftertaste that hangs with you for awhile.... Amongst my favorite beers of the over 400 I've tried.... Easily, one of my favorite American brews."

""
""
"Pours a hazy pale amber with an admiral amount of white head, great retention. Call me crazy, but I like a good hop haze. Nose is complex with a full range of citrus character. Obvious use of centennial here, citrus with a hint of pine/grass. Wweet malt backing. Taste follows with citrus hops and nice malt balance. Very smooth for a beer of this potency. Overall a very solid beer, no 5's, but not a single weakness either."

"I had the beer for the first time yesterday from a bomber,while brewing my own beer. I got it from a craft brew place called the fridge in lancaster. It's one of the best ipas ive had in a while. the hop aroma and taste are like heaven on earth.I will be getting this beer again and will be making a clone in the very near future."
""
""
""
""
""
"As one of the most tried, most beloved double IPAs, I have little else to say. Its reputation precedes itself. The nice translucent orange pours with a rocky white head. Tons of hops and a delicate sweetness on the nose. Obviously big hops and grapefruit power through your mouth and on down, leaving your tastebuds in ruins (unless you've got more of the beer left)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: Wow. This is right up there with the best IPA's I've ever had. If it wasn't so expensive I'd have this one on hand more often. If you are a hop head then seek this beer out!"
""
""
"I’ve never been impressed with this beer, fresh or otherwise. Harsh and overly bitter. Gimmicky. GRRRR…Gargoyles…awesome, Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): Ruination is a great Imperial IPA. It's no longer the cool, new kid on the block, but it could teach today's new kids a lot. One thing I really appreciate about it is that it keeps the alcohol levels in check and avoids the """syrup curse""" that overly hot, sweet, Imperial IPAs exhibit; these bad apples resemble American barleywines in their flavor more than IPAs. Ruination, on the other hand, is beautifully hopped, highly bitter, and pleasingly dry. She's a beauty."

"O-A well-done IPA with good hops that are strong and flavorful without becoming overly herbal and vegetal."
"overall a great dipa. one of the best in the categories."

""

"O: delicious - it's like food - a very heart and rich beer with just enough bitter hops and brighter flavors to balance it out"
"O - had this countless times but decided to review it finally. This fresh really is one of the best, most accessible DIPA out there. There is a reason they have been doing it for 10 years...its just DAMN good. I feel it's underrated because its NOT new. This is a great DIPA that should be tried by all."
""
""
""
""
""
"I got a 22oz bottle of this from Woodman’s in Rockford, Il for $5.99 in early 2012. Pours a clear amber color with a fluffy off-white head. Scent is full of hops mices with some citrus. Mmmm holy hops Batman. The taste is loaded with smooth, crisp hops that gang-bang your taste buds. Texture is smooth and refreshing. Slight dry, chalky finish. Really lives up to its name!"

"Poured from bomber into perfect pint glass. Frothy fluffy off white head. Some cling as retention. Light copper amber coloring. Smell is caramel and malt hops. Bready elements present, with some sweetness. Taste is sweet and creamy, with caramel and malt most prominent. There is a floral presence as well, with some resin. Mouthfeel is smooth. Good beer, less complicated but delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is certainly a classic DIPA but no longer a top favorite of mine. It’s big and bitterly hoppy and a bit boozy and yes, maltier than I might like. Not the most subtle or intricate DIPA; something like Pliny (to say nothing of Hill Farmstead or Alpine IPAs) has this beat on overall flavor, complexity, and drinkability."
""
""
"Excellent double IPA. Pours mostly golden with a hint of orange coloring. Smells like a bouquet of hops. Taste is out of this world with hops all over but becoming sweet especially as the beer warms beyond usual fridge temperatures. Overall one of the best beers I've tasted and definitely earns its rights as a benchmark for double IPAs."

I mentioned the wordy label, yet the beer and brewery do not come off as pretentious--if anything, one sees the passion and pride that they put into each beer that they make. Extremely enjoyable and highly recommended! Wish they would've released more of the 10th anniversary in GA though."
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Extremely bitter due to the piney hops. Not nearly as sweet as Ruination tenth anniversary. Much less of a malt back to it as well."

"I had this about 3 years ago, and I honestly couldn't comprehend it. Now that I better understand the glory of a well-done DIPA, I am somewhat blown away that I wasn't blown away by this beer in the past. Ruination is fantastic, and I am sad that I haven't had it in years. It's incredibly hoppy and dry, not sweet. In other words, this is what I want in my life."
""
""
""
"O- What is there left to document that hasn't already been stated? Ruination IPA has set the standard for an entire wave of IPA's (specifically, Imperial IPA's) flooding the American craft beer market. Although it might seem 'pedestrian' at this juncture, Ruinaition IPA is a testament to Stone's influence in the US craft brewing industry and are confirmed trendsetters. Ruination IPA still ranks with high marks as one of the beers which defined the style."

"The beer pours a nice yellowed orange, very much like dehydrated piss, and even the head is slightly yellow, but thick and bubbly, with not a very long retention. Lacing is thick and peaked like a mountain range. The smell is a stupendous kerpow of hops; very piney with slight hints of citrus and not a lot else. The pine hops are very much the dominator in the smell. There might be a slight sweet malt at the end of the smell, but that might just be me stretching to smell. This is just a big bitter punch in the face. This beer is just pine hops blasting over your tongue, but they are great. After taste is like a pine forest bristling in the wind. There is, again, an ever so slight taste of sweet maltiness to it. Mouthfeel is very crisp and smooth. Carbonation doesn’t seem to touch the tongue much but the bitterness of the hops is very present on the tongue, and the top of the tongue is left rather dry, but still sticky on the sides with saliva. The overall after-feel in the mouth is bitter. This is a beer that demonstrates the bitters, but not much else. The bottle claims to have great subtle tastes of yeast and malts, but I would say that the real strength and the only true flavor is in the deep piney hops. I don’t know if I would have this one again. I love a good IPA and a good bitter taste but this just seems to be straight pine and nothing else. It’s a great example of the pine flavor but I don’t know how much of the pine flavor I would personally like to drink. The beer is similar to Longhammer IPA by Redhook Brewery, only with more hops and bite and a better smell."

"Stones """smoked porter""" was my favorite of Stone's beers, then i tried Ruination. a double ipa even though it doesn't say it on the bottle, how could a beer with this high of i.b.u.s not be a double! this is my favorite double ipa out there heck this is probably even my favorite ipa period. there is not one thing lacking or wrong with this beer, the PERFECT example of a double ipa. GLORIOUS. very VERY hoppy but still balanced in an amazing way...pours golden yellow with slight haziness and reeks of bitter/sweet hops. immediate shock to the palate with an overabundance of hoppiness yet still as i said perfectly balanced... i cant come close to describing how great this beer is so just TRY IT 4 YOURSELF!"

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours hazy orange gold with a tall white head and plenty of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates very slowly, leaving lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of citrus and resinous pine. The malt also comes through in the aroma. This is such a hop forward smell. The hop forward nose gives way towards a very hop forward taste. The big piney hops lead into the citrus and sweet malt tastes. The hops are lovely and this beer is well balanced. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is sticky in the mouth. The drinkability is high. This is a well-balanced beer that definitely fits the world class label. Well done, Stone."

"O: Despite the 100+ IBU rating, I was very surprised by the lack of bitterness. Don't get me wrong, its def there but the maltyness, mild fruit flavors and alcohol taste really balance this out well."

"From a bottle into a tulip glass. I've only lived in places where Stone is not distributed, so these are true treats for me. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with two fingers of white, frothy head. The head lingers for eons and leaves beautiful lacing on the glass like strings of cob web. The aroma is all hops, sticky with citrus grapefruit and resin. Hiding in the nose is a waft of honey sweetness. The first taste is a blossom of pure hops; the heavy flavor is all citrus hops with a backbone of pine. It blends beautifully into that promise of honeysuckle like sweetness I found on the nose. The sweetness on the back end coupled with the unapologetic hop smack in the mouth makes this THE IPA against which I compare all others. This is the beer that turned me into a beer geek. Other IPAs are guilty of just loading you with hops for hops sake, but this beer uses them the way they are meant to be used. Cheers to the guys and gals at Stone for brewing such a gem."
""
""
"O - while the biggest of most intense DIPA out there, this one is something special and it's easy to understand how it's been around for so long."
""
""
""
""
"Overall very good indeed. The only problem I have this this guy is the taste is a little light on the complexity. As for an IPA though this is killer. Check it out."
""
""
""
"Overall- Trust the brewers. I've enjoyed a number of DIPAs well past their """expiration""" dates, and enjoyed most of them. Ruination is still a decent beer, but loses much more than it gains. The brewer's intent being a hop-slap to the face, that's perfectly reasonable, but drink it when you buy it."
"OK. I'm not a real hophead. I used to be an anti-hops guy until I was turned on to Double IPA's that offset the bitterness with citrus juice. I mainly drink IPA's made here in Vermont that tend t be on the citrusy side (Heady, Hill Farmstead and Lawsons). I actually went to the liquor store to get some Lawson's Double Sunshine and they were out. Figured I'd give this a try. Wow!. Super hoppy but balanced so nicely that I wasn't overwhelmed. Great head and carbonation level. A little clearer appearance than I like but no big deal. The key word here is balance. If I could change one thing it would be the super strong hop flower aftertaste, but I realize this beer is made for the fullblown hophead and will rate accordingly. This one is a masterpiece if a guy like me who isn't in love with hops can love such a hoppy ale. Well done Stone."
""
""
"Overall: incredibly drinkable beer that is much more session-able than I thought it would be; I'm a bit of a hop head and was expected a bit more of a punch, but this was still a delicious beer that I'll buy again; I let the bomber sit out and re-poured as I finished each glass, and as the brew warmed it opened up quite a bit--for my next tasting (I bought two bottles), I'll let it come to room temperature before the first pour"

"this one pours a nice hazy apricot color. the smell is hands down the best part of this beer. it is nothing but a powerful hop fruitiness with noticable flowers. the taste is bitter fruitiness with a slight soapiness. the bitterness is relentless and dominating. this is probably the most bitter thing i have had. the mouthfeel is is sticky and leaves my lips feeling dry. overall it was exactly what i expected but i like a slightly less rough one."

"O: right now I'm thinking I didn't know this beast was going to be this good. Holy crap, yes this is a palate wrecker, I don't think I'll have another beer the rest of the night or at least not anything that good! I'm more than impressed and yet pissed because my numbers are going through the roof on this thing. However, the next time I want this thing, I want it next to an awesome East Coast DIPA with both having the same freshness date and we'll see who's standing then. I don't even consider myself a hophead. Is this thing really this good?"

"Purchased from Bevmo in Mira Loma, California. Poured into a Baird pint glass. Beautiful wheat gold in appearance with a thick, thick foamy soapy off-white head. Amazing floral aroma from the pour on. Filled with hops and some citrus like kiwi or grapefruit. Overall, an amazing beer from an amazing brew company that continues to impress me. I will be looking for this again."
""
""
""

"O: Pretty much a palate scorcher. Bitter pine, grass and floral hops just coat your tongue. Relative drinkability for such a bitter beer makes it a great experience."
"Overall a must for any hophead or newbie to beer. Turned me onto bolder beers a few years ago and is still a great go-to beer. Another great Stone beer."
""

"O - A hoppy upgrade from the traditional Stone IPA. I feel as if they just turned up the hops a few notches and balanced accordingly. I feel there are better IPA's out there, but this is certainly one worth seeking."

"Golden yellow in color with an orange hue and good clarity. Poured with a thick, dense white foam with good staying power. The thick foam slowly reduces to a soapy cap that leaves sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus orange and grapefruit hop aromas with pine hops and sweet sticky malt underneath. Smooth oily feel that rides over the rich lazy carbonation beneath. Fairly balanced citrus hop and caramel flavor up front. Pungent orange and grapefruit hop flavors intensify into the middle that slowly transition to bitter pine hop flavors at the end. Finishes semi-dry with a bready/malty aftertaste at first that slowly gives way to a long lasting bitter pine hoppiness."

"How have I not reviewed Ruination yet!? Poured from a bottle to a pint glass the beer arrives a hazy yellow orange with a 1 finger white head. Good retention and lacing, looks good. The nose is terrific with huge hoppy citrus and pine character, more fruity than earthy. Smells like heaven. The flavor is very bitter with the same citrus, earhty hop flavor as detected in the nose. """Ruinous effect on the palette""" according to the bottle is right. Dominates. Sweet caramel malt base but not even close to the hop bitterness and flavor. A hint of the alcohol warmth. Full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is dominates your face so no use drinking anything of quality after as the bitterness destroys your palette. Very enjoyable."

This is much more of a sipping beer than a session beer. The flavor and the aroma have a nice complexity and invite/entice me to want to try this one."

"O: This is the epitome of a west coast IPA in it's clean but brutal hop assault. A very well made, clean and powerful IPA that is not for those new to the style or craft.

"It is extremely drinkable but just does not wow you. Lots of better IPA’s out there IMO."

"Pours an orange color with a dense white head and sticky lace down the glass. Aroma is of citrusy hops with some grapefruite and tangerine presence as well. Taste has good sweet caramel backbone followed by very stong hop bitterness. Medium bodied and smooth."

"Lasting numbing bitterness and a pleasant pine resin burn. Stone offers a through thrashing of the palate with their signature pine resin/earthy hops. A readily available hophead staple."

"22 oz bomber pours a slightly cloudy medium amber with huge head and lacing. Aroma is bready malt with citrus mangos, grapefruit and pine. Taste is wonderful citrus and pepper resinous hops - very nice blend of flavor and bittering hops. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with a kick and dry finish. Drinkability on this one is fantastic - I need frequent reminders to slow down! A great example of a west coast IPA."

"Ruination was the first Stone beer I had ever had, and it opened me up to IPAs along with DFH 60 Minute. This is constantly one of my go-to's. A great beer and very affordable."
"O: Quality brew, but it's almost like they took the Stone IPA and just made it boozier. I expected more. Still a good IPA, but not worth the price versus the Stone IPA. The Smuttynose Big A IPA is better for a similar price. Still good."

""

"O: Rich, intense, over-the-top bitter, this is a very strong IPA, typical Stone."
""
"The bottle graphics and story/poem were quite impressive and i really enjoy discovering the relationship of graphic creativity and taste of the craft brewers. Based on the reviews, I anticipated an above average hoppy IPA only to be disappointed with a weak hint of hop bitterness, smell and complexity. Color was nice orange but no foamy head and very weak carbonation. Served this beer in a tall beer glass at 38 degrees; serving at a warmer temperature may bring out the flavors, aroma and complexity others commented, I just couldn't find it in my pour.

"O - Well, if you like big bitter, hoppy beers then this is it!"
""
""
"Not bad. Not something I would drink again, but that's me. It's best in the first six ounces."
"Overall - A solid 2IPA. Not quite as interesting as Lagunitas Hop Stoopid or Pliny the Elder, or even it's 10th anniversary or double dry-hopped counterparts, but it holds it's own nonetheless."
""

"Why is this supposed to be a Double? It's an IPA. Maybe there has been some category creep since this was first released. On tap at Bergie's Pub in Old Town."

"Reddish orange hued ale having a large long-lasting white head with good lacing. No discernable carbonation. Hoppy flower aroma. Medium bodied that starts with light malt sweetness and intense citrusy (grapefruit) and hop flavors. Finishes with light lingering bitterness with grapefruit flavors. High hop profile but not aggressive at all. Well-balanced."

"Stone Ruination IPA, 22 oz. bomber: This beer is a lightly hazy dark amber color, and has a nice finger of head that lasts and laces well. The aroma is all out hops; citrus, pine and grass all come through. The flavor is very hop forward. You get a big blast of hops from the start, and the Ruination has quite a bit of bitterness to it. As you become accustomed to the hops (about half way through a glass), the malt starts to make its presence known. This is a signature big IPA, so if you like IPA’s the Ruination is not to be missed. If you are not an IPA fan, this is not the place to start."
"Overall I really enjoy this beer. The strength of the brew (7.7%) is hidden behind the distinct hops and the smoothness of the finish. Very good beer - worth a try even if you do not prefer IPA's, and especially if you do."

"Overall, Stone has produced a hop-lover's dream--an oily/resinous/bitter/citrus/pine bliss."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great for its category, I'm partially biased and double IPA's are just a little beyond palate comprehension at the moment but I can appreciate this beer for what it is, a phenomenal example of an American Double IPA."
"O: Far from balanced, Ruination works on an extreme level even if it is a style of IPA/DIPA that I only crave once in a blue moon (no, not THAT Blue Moon). I’d love to get this fresh on-tap sometime soon and if it’s very different then I’ll re-review."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1/2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is extremely hoppy with an emphasis on herbal and citrus zest aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, grapefruit, herbal hops, and some slight honey flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a nice crisp level of carbonation with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good DIPA that I have put off trying entirely too long. A very pleasant surprise."
""
""
"O - A very good example of an American IPA. Very solid bittering throughout and the hop profile plays wonderful together. The maltiness is there, just wish it was just a tad more pronounced. Very good beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nectar of life! A beer this bitter should NOT be this drinkable…alas, it is, and it’s so damn awesome. The distinct bread tastes contrasting with piney hops remind me of Sierra Nevada’s Celebration, but more intense in the hop department. Legendary beer…this might be the first $20 six-pack I ever buy. Worth every penny, for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden and clear with medium white head. Smells of heavy pine like I shoved a pine cone up my nose, a hint of citrus, and exclusively highlighting the bitter hops. Flavor follows similarly. Hops are palate killing up front. Finishes with bitterness as well, with some sweet malts in the middle, and citrus aftertaste that just lingers on the palate. I had this right after Founders Centennial and it blew it away. Big resinous mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation, with a slightly dry finish. Good stuff, and rather unique (but not as unique as RuinTen--that one is in its own category)."
""
""
"O – Almost but not quite over the top! Ok maybe it is over the top but really not too much A great beer. Highly recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a great beer. It looks, smells, tastes, and feels exactly the way an imperial IPA should. I love the hop aroma and taste complexity. I would maybe like to see a little bit more malt aroma and taste to add more balance, but I understand that Stone's intention was to overload it with hops. The alcohol is not very noticeable for a beer that is nearly 8% ABV, but once you get to the bottom of your glass, you know it's there. If you're into double/imperial IPAs, I highly recommend this one."
"Overall, this is a nice IPA on the dry side of the style. I think the somewhat small body is an artifact of it being so dry, but the taste is worth it."

""
"Overall: I feel like the taste wasn't as good as the aroma promised but it's still excellent. Certainly worthy of the hype."
""
""
""
"Overall - I really like this brew as a one time drink, although I don't think I would drink it very often. I like IPA's, but this one is a little too aggressively hopped for me. I know plenty of fellas, and it looks like plenty of BA's, who love it and would drink it every day, but not me. But that doesn't mean it isn't good! Because it is! But it is not a neophyte's beer, or someone just getting into the craft scene. It is quite potent, strongly hopped. To use boxing as a comparison, it's like a charger or inside fighter, vis a vis Mickey Ward. This thing will keep coming at you, you can't duck it or dodge it, the only way around it is to just man up and face the punishment!"
""
""
"A punisher, this. But there is enough complexity here that it's not just a one note hops bludgeoning. But it's a 100+ IBU from Stone. What else would you expect?"
"O: Overall a delicious IPA, definitely a palate wrecker. Must try for any hop head."
"O - Damn good. If you like IPAs you will love this one. I'd drink this any day! A great drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
"I remember loving this one when I first started drinking for real. Not a bad offering but at the premium price this one demands I just assume grab Stone IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent beer. Great hops, but not overwhelming, and oh so drinkable. You know, I may be a bit biased with this review. I'll be honest. If this was a Lagunitas beer I probably wouldn't give it such a high score, because I'm used to this from them, but this is a Stone beer that is distinct from their other offerings and they've delivered well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- What can I say, this was the beer that introduced me to the DIPA which has since evolved into my favorite style. Every bit as great as I remember it being the first time I sipped on it. Phenomenal beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I was kind of disappointed by this beer (as you probably guessed from my scores above). It is a very good beer, but it has everything that anyone could want in an IPA, not a DIPA. It is nearly perfect in terms of all the characteristics of a single IPA (it tastes just like Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA to me) and if it were, I would probably give it a perfect score. The bottle says """IPA""" and the alcohol percentage as well as everything else about this beer screams IPA, but I'll trust BeerAdvocate's classification as a DIPA and rate it as such. When I purchase a DIPA, I want to be blown away by the hops."
""
""
"I am a happy Ruination Camper!"
""
""
"O- a good ipa, definitely an upgrade from stone ipa"
"There's nothing subtle about Ruination. I personally would have preferred for more citrus hops instead of so much pine. And I don't think I could have more than the one 22 ounce bottle because the taste is so in-your-face. But Ruination is quite tasty and exceptional in appearance, smell and mouthfeel. It is a beer to respect."

"Great bitter DIPA."
""
""

"This is a good DIPA, but I'm spoiled living in the Bay Area, because there are better out there, namely Pliny and Double Jack. This is still a good DIPA, but its range is thin compared to the aforementioned champs. It's funny, because it's a lot easier to find the aforementioned Pliny and Double Jack than it is to find a fresh Ruination. I went to three liquor stores before I found one that was within the """Best By""" limits. most were over a month overdue. Let's sell these things on time, people! Good try, Stone. Yo don't make the best DIPA, but your IPA is still king in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great IPA. One of my top 5 beers."
"A tad boozy for 7.7 ABV but I've found this to be true of most Stone beers. All around very good and one to seek out, for sure."
""
""
"o - a fine beer from stone and to me, this is the epitome of west coast dipas. enjoyable, though i don't think you'd be able to taste much after one or two of these. appropriately titled at least."
""
"Wow. Great beer, the last beer of exceptional beer Sunday and what an NFC championship game this should be. This is a bitter buzzsaw palate wrecker no doubt and the most bitter beer I've ever had. Massive amounts of bitter citrus fruits that just don't quit. But the best thing about this beer is the huge buttery malt background, the perfect balance to the huge hoppy bitterness. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had."

"alright 12oz long neck with an awesome painted label. don't know why i havent reviewed this but anyway it pours a slightly hazed yellow orange with a bright white head that shows great retention from the one finger head that was produced. good lacing as well. the aroma is surprising more citrusy than i remember (been a few months) of course very piney, resins coming in, floral power. definitely some sweet citrus as well. this one is 60 days old so perhaps the pine and hop scents have faded and the citrus has held up but still a hop bomb to say the least. the taste is an absolute hop onslaught with pine more pine and some dankness; finishes bone dry. much less citrus than was in the nose but still present with sweet tangerine and bitter grapefruit busting through. a very pale biscuit malt is there but just overtaken by the hops. the mouthfeel is...well do you know rob gronkowski? its like taking a gronk power spike off the mother fu#@ing face in a new england winter. did rob gron just hit you in the face with a bag of hops? its stings doesn't it? prickly crisp and sharp when im in the mood for this i love it and stone does it right. overall i like this brew and what they did. if you want unbalance this is your guy! drink it rob!"

"Taste is really nice. I am usually not a fan of Stone, but this is a great IPA. Great hop with citrus taste. Bitter but palatable which makes this drinkable. It is more on the bitter side, otherwise, a great IPA. Obviously, Stone is a respectable brewery. So there is no reason to pass this up."

"Poured into my Ballast Point Big Eye ipa glass (compliments of Capital Ale House-Richmond). Has a nice color and moderate foam head. Can smell the citrus which makes for a nice ipa. Has a pretty strong hop bitterness that I really like, yet it doesn't overwhelm the citrus flavor that I really love. I rank Ruination up there with the finest ipa's on the market. With 7.7 abv, this is a big league ipa with a big league taste. I am yet to find a Stone Brewery product that isn't top notch!"

"O: This is a fine DIPA. Stone rarely disappoints and this one is a huge success. A great example of the style."
"Great Beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I love this DIPA. Stone always seems to make beers overloaded with hops and this beer is a good example of that. It's a delicious beer but at $6.19 for a bomber it may be for special occasions only."
""
"I've had this both out of a bomber bottle, and on tap at South Park Pizza tavern here in Dayton. Out of the bottle was much more enjoyable then the tap. Golden blonde color (standard ipa look) The smell is a strong but balanced floral. The taste is exactly what I would expect from Stone. A strong overwhelmingly flavorful beer. This is not an IPA I would suggest starting out on, this is a very full flavored, bitter beer and would most likely be to much to handle for anyone that is just starting to drink craft beer. However if you've had an IPA or two and know what your getting into, you might want to drink with caution, you will never want another IPA."

"So, this one isn't for the faint of heart. This one blasts me with hops out of the bottle with the smell and the taste. You have to be a true hop-head to enjoy this one. If you can get by the bitterness there are some nice tastes in there. I think I prefer my IPAs to be a bit more flavorful, but this is a great IPA and will put hair on your chest if you drink enough of it :)!"
"O: Overall the beer is alright, but I wanted more hop flavor out of this. I can't call it average because it's better than some of the other average IIPA's I've had, but it also strongly lacks the flavor of many others. It's hard to call this one, because a bottle can lose a lot of flavor based on how long it's been shelved. I bet this is a lot better on tap. I would drink it again, but only if I could figure out how to verify the date, and only to re-review the beer. As it stands right now, I wouldn't pick this up if I had a chance to buy an IIPA from another brewery."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I wasn't super crazy about this. It's a good beer, but it might just be a bit much for me in the hop department. I'll probably give it another try in a year or two when I have a chance."
""
""
"Overall: Simply put, this is a hop lovers dream. There should be a picture of this beer under the definition of Double IPA. Kudos to Stone for creating this masterpiece for which all Double IPA's should be judged. By far this is my favorite beer for the style and worth all """5s.""""
""
"O- similar to other stone ipas I've had with a big citrus and piney hop presence and the malt taking a backseat. This is a good ipa, but there isn't really anything in my opinion that makes it elite in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a cloudy orange yellow, with 1 and a half inch sticky white with head, lots of lacing. Smell is pungent pine, grapefruit, apricot, pineapple, and tangerine. Taste is just as powerful, grapefruit is most prominent and besides what was mentioned in the nose, some hints of garlic. Mouthfeel is dry, perfect size not huge or thin, very approachable, and lots of life. This is the beer that turned me into a hop head and it is still one of the best. Best by 1/25/12."

"My second time to try this brew. Pours a light amber with a nice white head, quiclky turns to a lingering foamy cap. The smell alone drives me crazy, a nice blend of citrus (grapefruit), and piney hop aromas. A very clean malt flavor, a massive amount hops, and a smooth warming sensation from the alcohol. This was one of the brews that turned me towards hoppier beers. A must try for any beer lover."

"Bought this at Family Beer and Liquor in East Dubuque, IL. Beer poured an amber color with a thick off white head. Fruity/citur aroma with a hoppy scent. Smell makes your mouth water. Flavor is hoppy with a fruity aftertaste; very refreshing. Not an overally bitter IPA, but very drinkable and lots of flavor. Very drinkable and very good!"

"O: One of my favorite West Coast beers."
"Pours a hazy golden color with about 1.5 fingers of foamy white head. Big hoppy smell as you would expect. Nice fruity taste with a hoppy back end. With 100+ IBU's it absolutely ruins your taste buds, but it a good way. This is the first American double I've had and will be the benchmark for all others after this. Overall a delicious brew that I can't wait to have again."

"O: One of my favorite DIPAs, and the best easily accessible one. The only problem is the price - I hide them when friends come over. Worth it when you want that classic hoppy caress."
""
"O - This may be a bold statement at $18 for a sixer, but I think this one is worth my money. It's that good. Because of how well balanced it is, you might not notice just how hoppy it is until you find out that parts of your tongue may have gone numb, so to speak, rendering other tastes nearly pointless. Get some!"

"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has bright golden color to it, with not a lot of head but it lays down nicely to a thin white lace. The smell is nice and earthy of hops and some citrus. The taste is very hopy, very nice bit with some citrus. I get a little bit of malt to. The mouth feel is very smooth and rolls off the tongue real nice. Overall this is a great beer."

"I'm an amateur so this will be some what vague..nice amber color, clear. carbonation is spot on. head about one finger along with. Instantly smell the hops (pine) along with citrus but the hops are definitely stronger. Taste: Very predictable, tastes just as you would think after enjoying the beautiful aromatics..but very delicious. Smooth, nice bitter from hops, some sweenesst and accents of the citrus. Overall a great beer!"

"Pours a lovely golden/red copper color. The beer itself is relatively cloudy. Nice head that shows great retention the whole way down. Aroma is extremely satisfying. Very bright citrus hop aroma with a touch of pine. Very vibrant aroma. The taste is just like the smell. Nice malt sweetness with a large over the top citrus hop flavor. Not as bitter as expected, but this ale really packs in the hop flavor. Citrus, candied grapefruit, and lemony tastes all backed by just a touch of malt sweetness. This beer goes down very smooth. Good carbonation, medium bodied feel. Overall this beer is pretty stunning. Crazy amount of hop flavor in this one keeping you coming back for more."

"A light golden tanish color with a giant white head and plenty of lace. The nose detects lemon cotton candy, and flowery banana bread. Very nice and kind of unique as hoppy brews go. The flavor brings lots more hops in the form of sweet bready herbal grass goodness. There’s wheat and sort of peachy fruit nougat. Delicious in a medium plus body with a polite carbonation and an easy, lightly frothy feel. A class hop brew!"
"Overall a fine example of a good and well balanced IIPA. Always a nice brew to grab off the shelf when you need your hop fix."
"Overall an excellent IPA. Well worth it and one I will definitely return to."
"I know this bottle was at least around three months old, and thought this was easily the best DIPA I've had yet. It was hop-forward, but not to the point of it being caustic. The ethanol, while """getting up there""" in percent, was not detectable and attempting to beat the drinker into submission. Not ruinous, but actually rather pleasant; still wouldn't want to drink any other beer after this, though. In all, would like to try this much fresher and see how it turns out."
"O: A very pleasant beer overall. I could be I had a really good bottle of their regular IPA but this wasn’t as good as I remember the regular IPA being."
"The smell is perfect. Its like walking through an evergreen forest with orange and lime trees scattered throughout. It just screams out hops. And as you would expect from such a strong smelling beer, the taste is something to behold as well. Its by far the most bitter, hoppy beer I've ever had. It isn't well balanced at all, but I don't think that was the point of this one. It shocks you into submission (and your stomach will not be happy). Its a very dry beer and well carbonated. Overall, it isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close."
"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour motors forth! This stop pours a clear light amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises lime, light lemon zest, light orange zest, caramel, and pine resin. The taste holds notes of caramel, pine, very light lime, black pepper, lemon zest, light pineapple, and balsa. The body is on the heftier end of the light medium spectrum, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, this is one beastly DIPA, one that wrecks the tongue with its massive hop concentration but still goes down eerily easily. Good times."
"O- Really unique hop flavors/aromas. This beer packs a huge bitter punch."
"O: Great beer that's balanced very well. I wish they had the aroma to match that awesome flavor."
"My concluding thoughts on this beer, are if you like hops, you will love this beer, if malty styles are your go to, or if you are into more balanced styles, this may not be for you. I always try to indicate whether or not a beer may be good for sessioning, and due to the alcohol content I cannot in good conscious recommend it, but it doesn't stop me."
"O: overall, I was kind of disappointed. I know it's a huge hop bomb, and I love that, but I'd like to see a bigger malt backbone. At 7.7% and this mouthfeel, it could easily be called an IPA, not a DIPA. Compare this head to head with the likes of Sculpin and it loses. Compare it with DIPAs like Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, and Double Crooked Tree, and it's not even close. Maybe I got an old batch, so I'll review again if I see something different in it. Overall, solid beer, but not one of the top in the category."
"I have had this before, never reviewed it. I remember when I first was getting into craft, I thought it was too bitter; now that I can't get enough of hops, this is a great IPA."
"O: Very good, perhaps a bit too bitter for me, but the pineapple quality is very nice. Overall a very nice flavor."
"O- Am glad I bought this one and will buy it again."
"I'd place this in the top 5 IPA's/IIPA's I've had to date. I love how both the piney/bitter and tropical/sweet hop characteristics are displayed and the balance achieved in this beer. It doesn't strip the enamel off of your teeth with explosive bitterness, but it does do well at giving me my hop fix. I'd take another one and six more after."
"O-I try to be objective as possible, but honestly for this beer, one time is enough for me. I don't like the piney hoppy taste. Seems to be a popular thing in the USA but I'm just not catching on. One thing I can say is though is that this is probably the most drinkable IPA that I have ever drank. The balance was there and the other flavors made it quite refreshing. The alcohol was something I never noticed so the ABV is deceiving. Amongst the hopheads, I can understand why this beer is loved. Just not for me."
"Is this the perfect beer? It is phenomenal from the nice light orange color to the wonderful citrus aroma, and finally to the outstanding smooth balance and extra dry finish in the taste. I would say the best part is the extra dry finish followed by a great cheek pucker - delicious! The hops are overwhelmingly tasty and abundant - grapefruit and citrus - but somehow the taste remains smooth. This is a truly outstanding IPA."
"Pours a nice golden copper, with a frothy tight bubbled 1 finger head that slimes all around the glass. WOW, this is huge. Big meaty grapefruit/mango hops, citrus explosion on my nose, big piny/earthy hop finish, with a faint scent of caramel malt and a little alcohol to help open the nostrils. One of the best tasting IPA's around, the citrus hops meld so well with the malts, a distinct mango flavor, juicy, juicy hops, with a nice malt backbone that doesn't try to steal the show. Medium on the body, smooth creamy, dry and delicious. Ya this is a good beer, this beer is a fantastic DIPA that i strongly recommend."
"Decent beer, but I don’t see what the hype was so big. Just a pretty good beer."
"Serving type: Bottle - 6.99 1pt6oz bottle"
"This is a great beer. One of the best IPAs I've had. Nice, nice beer. I need to get more of this."
"Overall- Really just an excellent IPA. I’m not sure I will find an IPA that could be anymore well crafted. The taste profiles are great, but not as much sweetness in the drink as on the nose. Really though, a very minor critique of an awesome IPA. Did I mention that you should drink this? Now? Yeah."
"O: nice well balance ipa, very hoppy and refreshing"
"O: A beautiful hop bomb that goes down easy. A must try."
"Malts are kept light but are still noticeable, biscuity and lightly toasted with almost an earthy English graininess. Hop flavor and bittering are both huge; the bitterness lingers on the palate forever. Hop flavors range from pithy orange peels to lemon flesh to bubblegum weed and even range into the minty realm now and again. Big flavors here, I think this could actually benefit from some more alcohol to throw out and accent some tropical flavors in the beer. Bitterness is a bit too over the top for me, I wouldnt mind a brighter hop flavor with a tad less bitterness. Still though, minor complaints here and I think this is an excellent DIPA and one of the fore-runners of the style, Stone should most certainly be commended for that."
"This is a beer that I can see myself coming back to. This is better than the Stone IPA in my opinion. Glad I gave Stone a second chance."
"for now this is very excellent and enjoyable!"
"A high IBU hop showcase. One of my favorite go-to hop bombs. Satisfies my hophead cravings and can be found in almost any better beer store."
"O: very solid DIPA. Less hop-profile than I expected, but the balance of the malt and hops cannot go unappreciated. No wonder its so popular"
"If you like hops this is the beer for you. I wish it hd a little more to it but it is an excellent beer I will definitely enjoy again."
"Verdict: Really nice double IPA, I don’t usually care for the more earthy and grassy IPAs but this one is pretty darn tasty. Another solid brew from Stone."
"O - completely overwhelmed by this, everything from the big balanced flavours, easy drinkability, all the way down to the kick ass label, this has everything a hop head expects in a beer, I need more!"
"O- so balanced for such a bitter beer, great to sit and sip, picking out all the layers of flavor and aroma"
"This o's a fantastic one. Nice to have an IPA that destroys your palate with detail and nuances. Sorta ironic."
"M - Extremely smooth, with the perfect amount of carbonation with a medium mouthfeel."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. It's hard to call a beer of this magnitude and hop profile very drinkability, but it is bursting with flavor that keeps going with every sip. Even with the strong bitterness, I found myself reaching for the glass again and again and looking forward to it."
"Drink it, I like it."
"Big thanks to Kevin for bringing this one to me!"
"Notes: Pretty good DIPA. A good amount of hops providing for a pretty tasty beer. Pretty well balanced between sweetness and bitterness and it has a nice malt backbone. It is a touch cloying however. Overall a nice DIPA, not elite but more than worth a try."
"This was a very flavorful beer, pretty easy to drink also. I would definitely drink this again."
"This is a really good IIPA. Big aroma, big citrus flavor."
"This is a really good IPA. The sad thing is that I feel that the regular Stone IPA had more flavor. Ruination feels as if it sacrificed deeper flavors for bitterness. If you love pure bitterness then this is a nice choice for you, but I feel as if I am just going to stick with a regular Stone IPA as my first choice."
"O- great DIPA. I really liked the citrus notes that came at the very end of the taste. It does tend to ruin your palatte though, which is what we asked for when buying this stuff anyway. I wonder what a full bomber would have done?"
"This is definitely an IPA that has made it into my everyday enjoyment. Stone has created a really nice IPA and the price is right."
"O: A solid DIPA. I don't get the sense that this is 100+ IBUs. Bitter, for sure, but not puckering. The malts, as minor a player as they are, maintain a decent balance but don't really affect the flavor that much. A good DIPA, but not sure it's worth the price tag. A solid B+/A- in my book."
"Overall, I would say definitely try this if you're looking for a hoppy beer. I'd be hard pressed to say if this or Hopsickle by Moylan is my favorite extremely hoppy beer right now, but both deserve a try for a true hop head. Definitely give it a try if you like strong IPAs and you can find it."
"Overall, very enjoyable. Strongly recommended for an IPA fan."
"Overall: More than enough for your hop fix. The taste of hops will linger in your mouth for... a really long time. Even as brash and bitter as this is, it's still very well balanced. A great achievement from Stone."
"A solid IPA. All around balanced, well hopped, and drinkable. The bottle claims 100+ IBUs, but in my opinion it's not overly bitter. Worth checking out."
"(O) Really solid DIPA. You definitely experience the 100+ IBUs and is true to Stone fashion with the overly used love of hops."
"O) I'm a fan of this IPA. A lot less hop profile from their regular IPA and a lot more balanced. If you're looking for super hoppy go with something else. A well-balanced IPA. Refreshing."
"Color is a beautiful clear light amber beneath a nice white head. Head retention and a lack of lacing knock a point off the appearance score. Wonderful citrus and floral scents hit the nose full force, and the taste buds as well. Hops dominate throughout, but the bitterness is welcome and pleasing, not at all offensive. Wonderful mouthfeel rounds out an exceptional beer experience."
"Its a medium bodied well balanced beer that fits well int he Stone lineup."
"Overall a very good beer. Not the top of my IPA list but would certainly choose this over most others."
"O: this is my go-to beer. its a little pricey at my local liquor store ($16.70 for a sixer) but completely worth it. never disappoints, one of the most accessible DIPAs around."
"O - I love this beer. Its big and unforgiving. Its a bash in the mouth with a sh!t-ton of hops. THis is why we love Stone."
"D: very nice brew , reallt well done , i could drink this all night long -:)"
"Overall, it does a good job at drinkability despite the high alcohol and hoppiness. It is still largely a one-trick pony. It is a beer for the hop-lover."
"I highly recommend this beer, whether it be in a bottle from the store or on-tap at the bar."
"Great DIPA!! I """go to""" beer considering the price."
"Opaque copper colored pour with modest head nice lacing though. Nose has citrus hops, malt and candy sweetness blended nicely. Interesting flavor, citrus, hops, caramel, with earthy and herbal undertones to round it out. Medium body, low carbonation, very smooth and refreshing, another good brew from Stone , unusual flavor, very enjoyable,"
"If you are a hophead, this is the beer for you. The aroma and taste is strong and will leave you wanting for more. If you want even more power try drinking it at room temperature. My favorite IPA and definitely one of my top 5 beers. I don't know how else to describe it, something you have to just try. Another winner by Stone."
"O- a beautifully balanced delicious IPA"
"O - Pretty typical of the very best US DIPAs, super jam packed bottle of hop goodness."
"D - There's a reason this is top rated. Very drinkable and very well made. This could easily be my go to if SN's Torpedo becomes unavailable. Cheers"
"D - There's a reason this is top rated. The drinkability of this is insane and the flavours are bold yet not overwhelming."
"O- A nicely balanced, extremely drinkable DIPA from Stone. This is what I order when I go to the brewery. Very enjoyable."
"O: Excellent DIPA, nice complex aromas and flavors, and well balanced."
"o- kinda pricey so i wont be able to make this as habitual as i would like to, will most definitely keep this on the repeat list :)"
"A good beer, but a bit of a letdown compared to the regular IPA and the legend of this beer."
"D - I never get tired of this brew."
"A great DIPA that has a dank, pine overtone and is smooth but packs quite the bitter, hop punch."
"O: Very, very good double IPA. I think I prefer this over Hopslam. I need to find Pliny somehow."
"D- With the carbonic acid and alpha acids tag teaming the tongue it is just too much. It is interesting and strong, but not something I would want again for a while, if ever."
"O - I do very much enjoy this beer and hugely respect it. I often do find it out of date on the shelves; and that is a shame. I have heard the brewery is attempting to rectify this but I think it is probably more of a distributor problem than anything."
"O- One of my favorite IPAs. I thought this was going to be a novelty beer, but definitly not. Well balanced and probably going to be my regular go to IIPA."
"D: It's a definitive hop experience, not a """balanced""" imperial IPA (Tho at 7.7%, it's not as huge as some others naymore). Must try from Stone, as always."
"Medium to fullish in body, mostly soft. Rounded and dangerously drinkable. Not an in-your-face double IPA, but kudos to Stone for making a palatably approachable version (regardless of what the text on the bottle may say)."
"O - overall great for what it is. There's just a lot better ipa's out there."
"O-this was very good and drinkable. i loved the creaminess and drinkability this is an IPA that will not disappoint! i could have this all night long!"
"O: I think this beer accomplishes what it sets out to do: fill your mouth with hops. I really like hoppy beers that have their own character and this beer has that. It has the Stone taste with incredible hoppiness. It is right up there with some of the other crazy hopped San Diego IPAs that I drink a lot in this wonderful beer city. I wish I had the ability to describe all the nuanced flavors better. I like these beers because they turn out to be great sipping beers. You really have to like hops to get through one of these though. If you do appreciate hops, you will like this beer, along with the other crazy hopped west coast IPAs. When you spend time with them, you find they have a lot of nuance to them beyond the crazy hops. That is nice. The one thing I don’t like about the Ruination IPA is the aftertaste. It really lingers on the roof of my mouth in a bitter way. I suppose it is just ruining my palate."
"O: This is a really great beer if you're a hophead! Surprisingly though, the hoppy goodness also allows some of the malty backbone to shine through. Really, really good offering from Stone. Wish I could try one SUPER fresh on tap at the brewery!"
"O - This has become one of my favorite's from Stone, and has become a real staple in my beer fridge. I can always count on being satisfied, especially if I only have time for a single pint of it. Give it a try."
"Drink it as often as you can."
"Overall this is one big, pungent, well crafted, hop forward beer. Fear the hops. This one keeps kicking as you get to the bottom of the glass, they will win."
"D: For a palate wrecker, drinkability is very high. The alcohol is well hidden behind the hoppy onslaught."
"O- I love IPA's. I could drink this all night. If you are unsure if you enjoy hoppy beer, choose something else. On the other hand, this is pure gold for a hophead."
"Overall-Simply one of the best IPA's you can find. Stone is building a great name for themselves. Definitely will have again"
"O: Excellent DIPA from Stone. Good flavors and well balanced."
"O- Again I have to point out that I am drinking this beer past its recommended date, but the look and the nose are still of a high quality...small let down that I am not getting those tropical flavors in the taste...good bitterness and carbonation a B+ for sure, i would def buy this again and i'll try and search out a fresh bottle.."
"D ~ Wears its 100 IBUs well. While a really good IIPA, I wish the nose would have followed through a little better. Not a letdown...but I enjoyed the nose so much"
"Overall - A good hop forward Imperial IPA by Stone."
"Cheers"
"O - This is such a solid DIPA. One of the first ever brewed, it truly captures the style wonderfully. Due to the fact that I bought it in MO, all of the bottles at the bottle shop had a best by date of 8-10, so I am not able to experience its full potential. It is amazing that this IPA still impresses me this much with as much age as it has."
"This beer is exemplary in every facet of my experience. In fact, I sit here and crave simply thinking about pouring this beer. I poured the beer from a 22oz. bomber bottle into a chilled glass mug. It was like taking it straight from the tap; which happens less often, in my opinion, when pouring from a bottle. It had a kick-ass head that left an intense lacing down the glass and would sustain longer than the life of most beers I’ve ever had. It was a very frothy head (my favorite) that took on a vivid orange hue. I took one smell of it and I thought to myself, “HOPS!” To complement the hops, there were some very citrusy smells to it. At times it I caught hints of a premium tobacco shop. It was intensely aromatic. The taste is a medium body with am almost silky feel in the mouth. The malt seems to complement the hops very well, as it is a very soft malt roast. The third character are the rest of the undertones of piney, citrusy, and woodsy flavors. The alcoholic esters add to the flavor some real pungency. It finishes dry. Overall, this is one of my favorite IPAs (top 10 or so). Its a special beer. Whenever I have the money, I will get this again. Hopefully, I find it on tap in the city (Saint Louis)."
"This definitely changes how you judge an IPA, as many do not seem to match the bitterness this monster brings. The other IPA from even seems very much toned down compared to this big brother."
"Despite having lived near stone and having noted the famousness of this beer among IPA/DIPA lovers, I hadn't tried this until the other night. The beer was beautiful in the glass with carbonation vigorously dancing throughout the body the entire drink and awesome retention of a 1 finger head. Both the nose and taste were a bitterness formed through citrus rind and herbal hop character, on top of a pineapple dominant tropical fruit shaved ice flavor. It drank beautifully at all temperatures with an enormously crisp mouthfeel and plenty of nicely incorporated carbonation. Wonderful hop bomb that never became medicinal or chemical in nature. Great beer from stone for sure."
"Enjoy"
"Overall excellent IPA, a little more hoppy than I prefer but darn good, highly recommended."
"Overall a classic from Stone that I will continue to pick up when I see it fresh."
"Overall, I must say I believe the hype. I was worried that it was a novelty beer that was hoppy for hops sake, but really it's deliciously well crafted, will try again, hopefully on tap."
"O: I got into craft beer with this being the holy grail of IPA's. Since then, and since getting a job at a liquor store with lots of crafts, everyone at work talks shit on Stone, and it doesn't sell very well, so I haven't bought it in a while, since most of our Stone products are out of date or on the verge. But this purchase has reaffirmed my original beliefs that Stone is fucking awesome, and ruiniation IPA is incredible."
"ten out of ten. absolutely awesome IPA. SO DAMN GREAT. I do not wanna get into a detailed description right now, so let me just say it is a magical, awesome IPA that I can enjoy time and time again. Thank you. ... I will be enjoying this brew in the near future because, well, it is great. Please, try one now. SO GREAT!"
"Overall - It was good, but one glass is good enough for me. May be a little too hoppy for me."
"O: amazing beer, great flavor profile and I love the bitterness and hop presence. I am always looking for extremely high IBU brews."
"Overall, only a few sips of this reveals why the label claims this has an """immediate ruinous effect on your palate""": after this many IBUs, it's doubtful that any other beer is going to have much flavor at all. But since the beer is this delicious, and a bomber clocks in at 7.7% ABV, you might not need another one anyway."
"I like the smell and taste of the hops. It is a great example of a west coast ipa. Thank you Stone."
"O: This is one helluva beer. It's got everything - mind-blowing hoppiness, an understated-yet-somewhat-balancing malt backbone, and an aroma that makes me wish they made candles out of this stuff. At 7.7% it's practically a lightweight in DIPA territory, and yet it stands toe-to-toe with some of the greats. Stone has practical perfection on its hands, 8 years (at least) running. Bravo, Stone. Bravo."
"This beer poured a nice reddish orange color and formed a nice bubbly off white head and left some nice bubbly circular lace. A decent amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus and some floral aspects. The flavor is of hops and citrus with a slight hint of herb. The finish is light and just a touch bitter and extremely astrigent. Great beer but a beer you probably want to drink at the end of the night unless you don't want to taste any other beers the rest of the night."
"Overall I have had this many times in the past but have never had a chance to review it. I must say that this is my favorite example of a huge West Coast IPA (or double). It's name says it all. Not everyone in the US is okay with this huge West Coast style, but I call all of those that can't handle a ruined pallet a big fat wimp! Cheers to all of us that do! A must try! I also must commend Stone for freshness dating their bottles now. This one was dated 08/21/11. Maybe the freshest I've ever had???"
"Overall, I think this beer is on the verge of being great. Its not quite there, but I think it has an awesome presence."
"O: Phenomonal, I didn't think I was this into hops until I tried this beer. Well worth the $16 for a sixpack, but after three my palate and sobriety were (delightfully) RUINED!"
"This brew is just like the muscle car metaphor I used earlier. Simple, straightforward, delivers one thing (powerful straightforward bitter) with exquisite speed, gusto, and showmanship. But just as a muscle car is not good for complicated cornering or subtlety, this beer is not the best for drinkers seeking an IPA with malt balance against the bitterness, or a subtle display of multiple aspects of flavor profiles that different kinds of hops can create working together in tandem harmoniously. Be sure that you are looking for the muscle car ride and not some other kind of racing car experience before you buy this brew, and you won't be disappointed."
"O: This is called ruination for a reason. A fantastic DIPA. Yet again, stone never fails."
"A classic big IPA...chug into a snifter...great appearance, bright with plenty of head...smelling then tasting tells you they put more hops into the boil than into the dry hop...strong, big, bad...recommended, even if I think there are better ones out there...doesn't really compete with the local 3Fs DIPAs, but it is quite a bit cheaper too"
"A couple of these can definitely ruin your palate, as evidenced by the name. A little too forward on the bitterness for my preferences. Picked up at six-pack for $15; to be honest there are better deals for other IPAs out there in my opinion."
"O: This beer may appear intimidating or even undesirable to some, but I would definitely say this is a good example of an IPA, rivaling my favourite (Southern Tier IPA or 2XIPA). Definitely warrants a try, would buy again."
"O: Stone makes a good IPA, and this is no exception. This would have gone perfectly with the steak I grilled for lunch. Then again, between that and the beer, I'd likely have been knocked unconscious."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D/O: Potent hops confirm that this beer is still worthy of the name. The fade to resinous but astringent pine in the middle is a little too clumsy and overdone to reward with accolades, but the crispness and the cleanliness underlying all of the powerful flavors is more than worthy. This beer is beguiling despite the punishment it inflicts on the palate. The opportunity to buy a remarkably fresh bottle of Ruination proves that sometimes you can go back again."
"This is a nice West Coast double. Its a stronger, very bitter and hoppy beer, but quite drinkable for a hophead like myself. Its not quite there with Bell's Hopslam and definitely not Pliny the Elder...but it is a very solid and worthy beer that I would definitely drink again given my love for my bitters."
"Overall, this is quite an excellent DIPA. I was a little taken aback by the extreme hop presence of this beer, but I had to keep in mind that this is the first true west-coast DIPA I've had the opportunity of trying, so I had to be prepared for a little more hop-injected madness. If you haven't read the back of the bottle yet, do it. It's hilarious!"
"This brew poured out as a murky golden orange color. The head was really big and foamy. The lacing was very sticky along the glass. The smell of the beer was very hoppy, they aren't fooling around with this beer. The aromas are mostly earthy to me, there are some qualities of citrus that peak through but not much. The taste of this beer is loaded with monster hop flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit oily and even a bit heavy. Overall as much as I like this IPA, I feel there are much better choices out there. For some reason the hops they use in this don't really do it for me."
"Overall - This is one great DIPA. I think it is right there with Hopslam. Bold hop pop that any hophead can appreciate. And IPAs and DIPAs aren't even my favorite style."
"This is the brew for a true Hophead"
"Overall Impression- Good all around. Not sure i would pick this over the original STONE IPA because has a greater bitterness and much more pricey."
"This pours a nice golden color lightly hazed with a white head. The smell is most obviously of hops, floral and some citrus, I was hit with it as soon as the bottle was opened. Mouth feel is good medium body the hops are very present. The taste is excellent, the high bitterness is the predominate taste hidden in there is also a nice citrus / grapefruit acidic taste, very nice (and loads of grapefruit bitter aftertaste). It seems that even being past date hasn't toned this down much, love it. Overall another quality IPA from Stone, I really can't decide between this and the regular IPA (and not the Belgium one) which is my favorite, I just rotate between both of them."
"An excellent DIPA. One of my go-to beers."
"Poured a 3""" off-white head which took awhile to dissipate. Lovely hazy orangy gold color. Smell of strong hops and citrus. Taste more of the same and has that piney tartness you get with really strong hops. As to be expected this is a pretty similar beer to simply their IPA except ratcheted up to stronger. Personally I like their IPA better, it's more balanced."
"Poured into a nondescript tumbler, a slightly hazy golden orange with a small, foamy, white head that retained and laced well. Seemed like a beefed up version of the regular IPA. Strong floral and citrus hops in the aroma. More of the same in the taste: floral and citrus, with a sweet caramel flavor coming thought, and lightly toasted malts in the background. Strong and flavorful, medium mouthfeel, and quite drinkable."
"I had this beer a while back, but it was clearly not fresh. These bottles just got into MN and this beer fresh is pretty damn fantastic. Wonderful double IPA. I can't help but think that this would be absolutely delicious with Thai food."
"Ruination IPA exits the brown bomber with a slightly cloudy amber hue and an inch of above it. The aroma is strong with flowery hops. An inviting hoppy concoction. The palate is assaulted by hops The bitter flowery hops dominate the palate. Some citrus and pine notes join the mix. Just the right kiss of caramel malt balance the dominate hops. The smoothness of the flavor profile belies the hops that make this brew famous and iit goes down easy all night."
"O- this is a good beer but I have some beers I like better for a lesser price. But if this beer was around I would like to have some more!"
"O: I do like this beer. If you are a strong hop lover like me, this is the beer for you! If only the smell could be a little more inviting, it would be an all around perfect beer damn near!"
"Overall great DIPA, I love hoppy beers and at one time that’s all i bought was hopped out outrages brews. I’ve gone away from that and its nice to know i can still get down with the hoped crazed beer geets. This beer is great highly recommended but a bit over priced. 7.99 for a 22 and 14.99 for a six pack. Try out at least cause if you like hoppy beers you'll love this one."
"Poured from a bomber into a Duvel tulip. Slightly hazy orange colour, big dense rocky cream head. Big punch of pungent floral, piney aroma, slightly lemony, extremely fresh--like sniffing a fresh packet of hops before tossing them into the boil. This beer has been thoroughly hopped in all aspects of the flavour experience. Extremely hoppy and bitter, but balanced to the point of keeping things enjoyable. Lots of juicy grapefruit/pine flavour with a bit of bready malt backbone. Long-lasting citrus rind aftertaste. Medium bodied, a touch slick/oily. A fantastic rendition of the style, my favourite to date, just bursting with unbelievable hop flavour throughout. Will definitely revisit next time south of the border!"
"Overall: The best IPA I've ever had. Hands down. Even if your not a hophead. JUST DO IT! Prosit!!!!"
"O: I love this IPA from Stone. Stone never dissapoints and I will definitely be getting more into them as they are readily available here. This is a great beer for the hop heads."
"Overall - hops hops and more hops. Imperial ipa is my favorite type of beer and I thi ruination is central to the genre for it's great combination if hops, both in aromatics and flavor. If you want a nice well-balanced imperial IPA tis is a good place to start."
"Ive had this many times before, but never from a keg this fresh - what a treat!"
"That's not a slam against Stone, just I had two really good IPA's back to back from two breweries that seems quite different, proof yet again that there is a God."
"O: This is by far one of my all time favorites. The taste is spectacular and overwhelming. Total sensory overload but in the greatest way possible!"
"Overall: one of my favorite DIPAs and each time I have it, I'm reminded of why. Getting it from a freshly tapped keg was a real treat. Cheers!"
"O--One of the best DIPAs I've had in a long time. Ruination tests Racer X----and all of its hop bitterness and citrus aromas!"
"O - I have been drinking this beer for a few years now and it has never let me down. Sure, there is the occasional out of date bottle but that isn't the beers fault. Still one of the best IPA's of all time."
"Well, upon entering my mouth, I realize it is not as brutally bitter as I was anticipating, which is great. I actually tasted the caramel and toffee malts. I doubt wheat was used in this brew; the sweet, and delicately raw qualities of wheat seemed absent. The beer is actually balanced pretty well. The medium body could have used a viscosity boost, and I’d preferred a bit more sweetness, especially in the swallow, but it was pretty good. Fruity notes were limited to grapefruit, lemon/mine, and a slight cantaloupe flavor. A bonus was the absence of astringent vodka flavors I frequently come across in DIPAs."
"It’s a really great IPA with a sweet citrus twinge. Stone, you can ruin my palette any time."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: While I enjoy sipping through this beer and expect to have another someday, its not something I’d put on my shopping list for regular consumption. My overall impression is that this is a very good example of the West Coast style (mostly all about the hops with the malt playing a very secondary role) its not a beer at the top of my list."
"Mouthfeel is medium body with a nice level of carbination."
"Overall an enjoyable beer and I'd definitely have it again but would rather have a double IPA that balances out with a bit more fruit."
"Golden-yellow straw with a plush egg shell head. Constant flow of micro-carb bubbles. Syicky pine, earthy grass and citrus, mostly grapefruit. Both aromatic and tasting hops must have been used. Full on hopped IPA. Not a trace of malts to be found. The sticky hops linger in the cheeks and on the tongue. Another flavorful IPA from Stone. They know their way around good beer."
"Overall: Another great beer from Stone. I've had better DIPAs but Ruination definitely ranks up there with the best. Expensive at $18 per 6-pack but a nice treat."
"O - So tasy, if you can handle bitterness you'll love this. very refreshing, I feel a buzz coming on"
"This beer STONES (ROCKS)!!-- sorry bad pun... little drunk."
"O: very nice balanced beer, expected more bitterness, very drinkable, definitely seek out again soon"
"O: Great Beer. Not as hoppy or bitter as I had anticipated due to strong malt presence. Very pleasant and drinkable for such a high hop content. Will definitely purchase again."
"O: As I said not as bitter as I was expecting. Had VERY high hopes for this one and it came very close to living up to them (maybe my hopes were to high and this is a perfect beer). A super good IPA for the hop lover."
"This is as close to perfect as I've had so far. I love good strong gin, so IPAs are my thing. This beer pours a pretty light amber with a creamy head and good lacing. The smell is like a late fall pine forest in a bottle, opened on a hot summer day. On the tongue I get strong juniper and mango. Warms well also. Alcohol is not offputting, but gives a nice warm feeling in the belly. I will definitely drink this regularly."
"Have wanted to try this for awhile now and I'm glad I finally got the chance. While not something I'd drink every night, I did enjoy it and would defiantly have again. If you haven't tried it before, do yourself a favor and find a few bottles. Just remember before you take the first sip of this amazing brew, """fizzy yellow beer is for wussies.""""
"This is a standby for me when I'm shopping for IPAs. This pairs well with steak, burgers, salty foods, and strong cheeses."
"D - Forgot how easy to drink this beer is - the 7.7% is well-hidden outside of the nose. I split a bomber with Mike and it went down very quickly as a warm-up for some bigger brews. Wish it was this fresh all the time."
"o- this is a great DIPA from stone. I came in expecting a hop assault, especially since this is a Stone beer, but instead got a well balanced beer perfect with my Memorial Day barbeque."
"Don't know what I expected but I really liked this beer. Bomber size is always a slight turn off but I would buy this again."
"O - Enjoyed, but I need a fresher one to see if the age caused any issues with this one."
"The Ruination could Ruin the day after for anyone looking to session this fine crafted ale! The color is a decent golden or light amber, thin head, the nose is quite nice citrusy, the beer has a full body with a lil oil texture. The beer stars off citrusy, then beer turns more bitter as it hangs on the pallet, the mouthfeel is deterioated by the lingering bitterness and higher abv...but I love punishment and would drink this until I was stupid"
"Overall this is a great dipa well balanced dipa. Easy to drink, yet it has a lot of hop flavors. Like the bottle says it is truely a poem to the glory of the hop."
"This is of course a Stone brew so of course, a plethora of hops was expected. But what strikes me about this one compared to some of their other hop monsters is the balance acheived. For instance, Arrogant Bastard is great, but its too heavy and bogged down by the mouthfeel and it maybe seems slightly overmalted, at least for my taste. Ruination is crisp and clean and refreshing, yet super hoppy and perfect for any hop head needing his hop fix. Fantastic beer, I will buy this again."
"A great session beer. Will definitely return."
"O-For the style its probaly spot on and would be great for any hophead. For me, I would get it again but do prefer plain old IPA's."
"Overall, I gotta say that this is quite a nice double IPA. It's not quite as big as some of the beers I already mentioned but the hop flavor is there in spades. Very enjoyable beer in all aspects if you can handle the bitterness. Not a beginner's IPA by any stretch of the imagination."
"In short - love it."
"First Generation hop bomb here. Not explosively juicy and resinous, just a big, lovely, hit of hops."
"Overall: A very solid IPA. I couldn't find a freshness date anywhere after scouring the bottle at length, but it certainly tasted fresh. Definitely not for one who is just exploring hoppy beers. It didn't quite live up to the novel of propaganda written on the bottle, but that's just how Stone does it I suppose. Would definitely pick this up frequently if not for the price, its great as an occasional treat though."
"Overall this is a very good IPA and I am glad that Stone was finally able to make it to Minnesota so I can have regular access to it. It takes some hits on the appearance and and the taste could use some more balance but other then that its a great brew."
"An awesome brew amd a great dromler! Well worth revisiting."
"An amazing I.P.A. overall. This beer shows the true evolution of the I.P.A. a beer made out of necessity, at first to survive a long journey from England to India, and not a beer made out of necessity to combat Big Beer and all of it's evil doings. If you ever find yourself losing faith in beer, crack open this I.P.A. and even if you utterly hate it, you will plainly see that their is still a true craft in beer."
"Overall: This is a great Double that I can drink a 22 of and be pretty satisfied. I buy this every once in a while when i need a real bitter fix. Stone definitely has the tendency to brew ipa's with more of the hop forward west coast style as they should be."
"Pours a yellow/orange color with a white head, dissipates quickly. SUPER hoppy smell, with a huge citrus bomb smell in your nose. Taste is pure hops and bitterness, a little off the charts hoppy but that's how I like 'em. Bitterness hangs on your tongue for a while. Simply awesome beer for hopheads everywhere.."
"Overall, this beer was well outside of my hop liking parameter and too one sided for me to truly enjoy but I know that it is well loved and it is a well crafted beer packed ful of flavor. If hoppy bitterness overload is your thing that this IPA should be on your list. Enjoy!!!"
"O: one of my favorite double IPAs"
"Overall a very good ipa; not sure it quite lived up to the hype, but still a very solid brew."
"D: Easily one of my top 3 favorite beers, drinkability and overall impressions are obviously quite high. I love this beer."
"Taste is bitter, but there's a smooth malt backbone to support the hops overload here. Delicious, and worthy of some repeat tastings in the future."
"O - A very good IPA. Great crisp hop flavor, slight warming as is goes down."
"Long lingering finish..."
"O-A nice well rounded beer, hoppy with a nice bitter bite at the end. Not a beer that you could drink all day but a couple to a few are nice."
"OA: When a brew reaches beyond what it's pre-consumption characteristics allude it is a beautiful thing. This is a well-balanced yet different IPA, thanks Stone, it's a jewel and was thoroughly enjoyed."
"O: I am happy I got a chance to grab a pint of this right out of the firkin! Would I drink this again? Without a doubt, yes! If you're looking for a bitter beer that is still refreshing and decidedly easy to drink, give Ruination a try, no matter how it's served."
"O-If I ever want to splurge this will be a good choice. Very pricey but well worth the money. Top 5 beer for me."
"O: This beer did not match the hype for me. The flavor profiles of the hops and dried fruits fell flat and it most falls to a less enjoyable bitter state."
"O: This is a rare DIPA that is not very high in the ABV category, which means it's fine to drink a few. I wish more doubles were like this - one of my favorite beers."
"Massive hoppy aroma, almost like peeling a grapefruit under the nose! In the mouth, it's a level of pithy-bitterness that few beers can attain, yet still be throughly satisfying to drink. This is one of the few. Yeah, the hops are over-the-top and take center stage over the malts. Yet, somehow, it's forgiven with a zipping acidity that cleanses the palate and leaves you wanting more."
"Overall one of the most bitter beers I have ever had. The pine is the main flavor with great balance. I wouldn't pay the high price again for a sixer but definitely a great experience"
"O- A very enjoyable beer that has really nice citrus notes and a refreshing crispness."
"GREAT BEER; SEEK IT OUT!"
"I love these punchy, hoppy beers. Very crisp and potent. For me, this one has just reached the peak of the ``over-done-ness'' hill and has just started coasting down the other side (as opposed to Founders Double Trouble, which is right on point for my palate). I couldn't drink more than one of these at a sitting and I certainly couldn't drink it every day, but I'll definitely try it again sometime soon."
"O: Palate recking for sure. Because of that, its a little hard to drink more than one in a sitting and you can't have anything else if you really want to taste it after you drink this one. Kind of reminds me of a less sweet hopslam."
"22oz. bomber poured into pint glass. Another great beer from SB. Very similar to it’s little brother their standard IPA. Not as nice a head and presentation as the IPA. Clear light golden color with creamy, fluffy and tan head. This is a hop beast with hop aroma all over and bitter taste to perfection with nice malt balance to the finish. Big, smooth and creamy body. This is IPA - WANT HOPS!"
"I drank this along with a salad of arugula, and other peppery leaves, which complimented the beer well. I guess I didn't drink the salad, though."
"Finally was able to find a fresh bottle. It really pisses me off that even in California, it is very hard to find fresh Stone beers. This one doesn't expire until mid-June. Pours a bright, clear golden-orange color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY hop forward. Lots of citrus aromas and hop aromas, mixed with very little malt and a ton of pine. Taste is initially citrus fruit, followed very closely by strong hop oil and intense bitterness. There is hardly any malt, which is what makes for a great west-coast IPA. There are some bread flavors as well. Tons of pine sap and just bitterness throughout each sip. Very intense IBUs here. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a little sticky. Crisp finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a great DIPA when it can be found fresh...which can be very difficult."
"O-This beer delivered on all fronts.I can't wait to have it again."
"Overall this is a solid brew and I'd like to try it just a tad fresher!!!"
"D: No trace of the ABV. Flavors are good. Aromas are fantastic. However, the bitterness was a bit overwhelming for me. Not a huge fan of the palate wrecking aspect."
"I enjoy hoppy IPAs but this one is just too much. The flavors are there but are there in EXCESS. Hops. Pine. Citrus. All there. All in a big big way. Stone's regular IPA is delicious, far more enjoyable and much more drinkable for my palate."
"Pours a bright orange, with a dense couple of fingers of creamy white head. Retains its head nicely, and laces fantastically. Nose has loads of citrus, mango, orange, some dank and loads of tropical notes all around. Taste is bitter right off the bat, less maltiness and all citrus/tropical fruits. Some pine makes its way in there too. Heavy bitterness with a mouthfeel that lingers immesely. No alcohol. Awesome IPA overall, this one rips enamel and does so with style and flavour."
"Overall, hoppy. I think that there were hops. And also the hops were good. But yeah this thing balanced increasingly as I sipped and subdued malt sweetness developed well. It's good."
"Loose foamy head sits atop a hazy orange ale. Small groups of sticky lace. Grassy, spicy hop nose. Sharp, dry, crisp. Huge bitterness coats the back of your throat. Sweet dark malt evens things out. Resinous sticky pine bitterness lingers, no real leafy presence. Alcohol, gin hits fast. Palate ruining bitterness smacks your throat hard, but isn't that the point? Still quafable. I'd attempt to stick with this beer for a session if I found it on tap, but it would be a short night!"
"Short review here. This is my first time having this beer. Poured from a 22 ouncer into a mug. Color is a nice clear amber. Lacing stays long after the beer is gone. Smell is amazing, citrus and pine. Taste is phenomenal, definitely one of favorite beers, had a Sierra Nevada torpedo IPA not long ago and this in my opinion blows that out of the water. Definitely worth the high price tag, will buy again and again."
"O) Tasty, I just wish the weather outside would cooperate so I could enjoy this refreshing brew even more. I have the remainder of the 6-pack that I'm sure to enjoy."
"Way to go Stone for making a terrible example of a dipa. People are excited about the brewery being released here. I am not in that camp. This beer is less than stellar. So why should my beer dollars be given to a less than average product when there is local superiority already established? Good luck Stone you are going to need it. Surly is king in this state and you will soon find out."
"It's definitely a tasty beer, I found it quite enjoyable and I would definitely drink it again! (But not too often)"
"Creamy smooth mouthfeel, zingy carbonation very nice. Synergies apparent with the citric, tropical hop favors doused in a provident malt base. Does tend to get dry, and dries out the palate, but nonetheless it's very drinkable, very enjoyable."
"One of these will do. Don't think I'll go out of my way to have another."
"Overall Drinkability - The wet paint smell was a beer ruiner. Talk about ruination. Had high hopes for this beer coming in, so I'm surprised that this was such a let down. Maybe I got unclean glassware, or there were bad tap lines, but for whatever reason this is the first high expectation beer that has bombed so horribly for me in a long time."
"O - A really good IPA with plenty going on"
"Bomber of stone ruination this afternoon. Glad to have this in Minnesota now. Nice color of golden amber and a nose of citrus piney lemony goodness. Tasted just hits on the palate! Love it. Finish is not quite there with abrasive, but like the hops an bitter it brings. Great brew."
"O: Strange hop bomb. It comes on super bitter and alcoholic but turns out to be very interesting mix of citrus, earthiness and pale malt. Let it warm a bit and then marvel at it."
"I thought this beer stood up to the typical stone philosophy - bold hoppiness. I do enjoy a great IPA and this is definitely one of those. Though this beer does not tickle my IPA tongue fancy. The bitterness of the beer is not balanced with anything. I feel like stone just put a bunch of hops in without anything else. If there is anything else added to the beer it cannot be tasted due to the overpowering plethora of hops. I think a delicious IPA needs to have that bold hopiness added with a nice balance. The nose on the beer is amazing and choc full of hops. The taste and mouthfeel left me wanting something to counter the bitterness a bit. Overall a great beer for straight up hops but my taste buds wanted something that mellowed that boldness"
"My second favorite IPA...Pliny the Elder is first. Amazing flavor and bitterness. A refreshing amount of hops. Very clean tasting. Overall, one of my favorite beers. Too bad a 6 pack at bev mo is around $15 :( If you want an IPA that really stands out, this is more than what you are looking for."
"Had this on tap in a tulip glass. Good looking beer, copper color with a whitish 1""" head that fizzle down after a few minutes. Really good aroma- pine, citrus, hops. Really easy going down and you could taste the orange peel citrus on the front, and not even that overwhelming on the back end- although the hops do linger a bit. At over 100BU, Ruination is supposed to ruin your palette. I enjoyed my beer without food, bubecause it might not pair well with certain foods."
"Overall: I don't know about my palate, but a beer this good could definitely be ruinous on my retirement savings. I'm in love...sorry honey."
"I did enjoy this beer. The only issue I had was that it seemed to be a little pointlessly over bitter. However, that was what they were trying to achieve and they did so. And since I do enjoy bitter brews, it wasnt too much of an issue to me. I will definitely have another in the future"
"O:So much hops it got drafted straight out of High School."
"A superb IIPA; delicious hop bomb, but not quite overpowering. Shows a lot of finesse."
"Overall, probably a little closer to faded than fresh. Still a pretty good beer, but it doesn't blow me away."
"D - While it is extremely tasty, I think 1 is enough at a time. I will get it again though, for when I need a Hop attack!"
"Pours golden to orange. Fills the glass with a cloudy glow capped with glowing white lace. Head fades with snowflake lacing, nice overall retention. Nose is floral, citrus and pine. Taste is the same but earthy hops with grapefruit and some honey on the finish. Definitely a beer for hop fans only. Nice and creamy but still with a crisp mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable for a near 8% abv double. Another great beer from Stone, one of my favorite breweries. I could session with this double IPA."
"This is a well made IPA of good character."
"Overall, a bold tasty brew hopheads will love, though I still prefer Racer 5, Blind Pig and some others that to me seem to have a more complex and satisfying hop profile."
"I just didn't taste anything that deserved all the arrogance that was painted all over this label, even if the words were true. After all, hops are so delicious and have slightly ruined my appreciation for all other tastes, but it wasn't this beer that did it for me."
"Draft to brand specialty glass. On draft is a whole new ball game!!! The only complaint I have about this beer (on draft) is that it's defined (and priced) as a double...and it's 7.7%. Could be the best IPA ever, but it's a damn good double that has the alcohol content of a high-end single. But damn tasty!"
"Pours a golden orange color, a little hazy with a 1""" white head with decent retention. Smell is mostly hoppy, the citrus hops are coming through really strong. I think I smell a bit of malt, but my sniffer don't work to well. Upon first sip; the hops come in hard and fast, I am getting citrus and pine. Definitely a good west coast hip bomb, I'm loving this. I don't think I caught much malt in there, but I could care less considering the full scale hop assault in my mouth. Mouthfeel is decent, usually if I don't really notice the mouthfeel, it means it's just right. Overall, if you love IPAs and feel like getting punched in the mouth with a fistful of hops, this is a beer for you."
"Pours a beautiful golden color, looks like an IPA should look, very summer like. It's pretty cloudy, there is almost no visibility through the beer at all. The head looks really nice, it's very creamy looking, lots of small bubbles. I want to give this a 4.5 on appearance, but the head already faded a little bit, it's sticking around at about a half finger length. It for sure smells like a double IPA, the hops just punish you up front on the nose, and then there is a nice citrus smell, maybe some tangy fruit in here as well, but I'm not the best at detecting fruit in IPA'S so I'm not sure. Overall the smell is really really good, it doesn't seem like it's skimping out at all on the taste, which I'm sadly finding more and more common these days in IPA'S. Well the first thing I notice on the taste is that there is no hop crispness, this beer is not crisp at all, which is very disappointing. I mean you can tell the hops are there because of the bitterness, but there is no crispness, which is very strange for a big hoppy beer. Also, the order of things are mixed up, the malt comes first, and then the hop bitterness, I'm a little confused here. It's by no means a bad beer, they did a good job, it's a quality beer, just a little strange. It really is a good beer, so I have a hard time grading this below a 4 on taste, part of me wants to, but I know that it deserves a 4. As far as mouthfeel goes, it's pretty standard for an IPA, nothing disappointing there. As for drinkability, on some tastes you can notice the alcohol more than others, but for the most part it is pretty subdued and is somewhat easy to put back considering it's an IPA. Overall a good beer, it's not the best IPA I've had, it's a little weak in some areas, but it's a solid brew."
"O- overall this beer is very close to ideal for the style. It is overhopped to the extreme and should only be handled by professionals. The ABV tends to signify an ipa while the hop profile leans heavily towards a double. This conflict brings down the score slightly based on style. Outside of that, this is another great beer from the hop geniuses at Stone."
"Pours out a cloudy orange with a tall white head that has nice lacing and very very good retention. It also has moderate carbonation. It has a nice aroma of citrus, earthy hops, biscuits, and pine. The taste is a pleasant taste of earthy hops, pine, followed by some floral hops and finishes off with some citrus and honey. The aftertaste has some orange and grapefruit in it. I do like the creamy smooth mouthfeel that is like heaven on the tongue and cheeks. This beer reminds me a lot of Bell's HopSlam Ale and I think both are worth trying for all you hop lovers out there."
"Wonderful execution. Seems to have more bitterness than the regular Stone IPA but still an incredibly smooth brew."
"O - I'd seek this out again. Maybe not a top tier DIPA but Stone has made another quality ale."
"while not my favorite style of beer, i think i found the one that will turn me into an ipa drinker. poured a nice golden color with a 2 finger head. the smell was a bouquet of hoppy floral, citrus, perfumy deliciousness. went down smooth with a dry finish, yet not as bitter as i expected with 100 IBU's. definatly recommend to friends and will most certainly buy again."
"overall-excellent beverage,my fav ipa so far,will defenitly do this one again!!"
"However, its still a great brew by Stone and bold of them to put a 100 IBU beer on the market.. Good job Stone"
"A liquid poem to the glory of the hop! Probably my favorite brew in all of Stone's lineup...now if only it weren't so damn expensive!"
"Very good, but for a double/imperial ipa, it could most definitely be a lot better. More intensity in hops, a better body,maybe some more balance with malt could bring improvements. As a regular IPA, it rocks with the best of them."
"I like their IPA better, and the double dry hopped IPA I had on tap during """Stone Week in MN""" was absolutey top drawer."
"Overall: A good version of an IPA even though it is on the lighter side of DIPA's, both in the mouthfeel and ABV."
"In conclusion...I am the sample set."
"Overall, it's a bright, bold and bitter double IPA that's not overpower and, ultimately, drinkable."
"I've been craving this beer, but my usual store only had bottles past best by date. I finally found a bomber at a different store with an acceptable amount of time left. Well, it pours a hazy, golden color, with a smallish head. The smell is your typical pine, with light citrus that you expect in a DIPA. The taste for me is more resinous pine than citrus. Jacked up bitterness, which I love in an IPA, double or otherwise. It doesn't have that malty balance that other DIPAs usually have, which, in this case, is fine with me. The mouthfeel is less creamy than I expected. Very good overall. I dig most Stone beers and this one is no exception."
"This beer has a light citrus taste ans there is some creamyness. There is no real bitter aftertaste and that makes this beer a good one for a non IPA lover."
"Overall this beer is just too resiny and bitter with zero malt backbone that I just can't get into. It literally ruins your palate as it promises and I appreciate the purpose but this is over the top. Some may like this but I am not one of them."
"O - really nice IPA with a pleasant balance to this 100+ IBU beer. Nicely done and a really drinkable brew."
"Tastes like other double IPAs I've tried except it's exceptionally lingering so I guess it's average for the style. If you like in your face hops-give this one a try. If you're not a hop bomb fan-I guess stay away like I normally do."
"Finish: Floral notes stick around for a long time next to a subtle heat and stickiness on the lips"
"Drink- I'll have this again. Just too good not to. A very good DIPA and the spicy, bold, dry hops are just a tounge overload but well worth it."
"O--I love hops, and I love bitter IPAs. This makes this beer perfect for me. If you are a hophead like myself, give this a try if you haven't. One of the best DIPA on the market"
"Pours a hazy amber color into a snifter with only slight head and a small amount of lacing. The aroma is of flowers, citrus, and hops. It tastes of all of the above and very dry with a mouthfeel of dryness also. This has recently become one of my favorite DIPAs."
"There's a throaty-into-the-chest warming that I've only ever experienced with Hoptimum. I likened that to the chili-high that chiliheads get with the spiciest dishes."
"O (D) - Ya know, this is good, and since it had a pretty bad pour and wasn't very cold, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I'll try it again and pour it better, and I'll expect more. As it is, it's a good beer."
"Beautiful creamy foam head one and a half fingers and a nice small layer remains throughout the beer and leaves leaves beautiful creamy lacing with amazing retention. Resiny hops in the nose. Bitter smell. Grapefruit tropical mango and very bitter as the name indicates. I typically would say this beer was too bitter but its just so delicious Dry bread-like mouthfeel highly cabonatrd with small light bubbles. . Incredibly drinkable at such a high bitterness. Ended up sessioning it because it truly ruined my palate."
"M - smooth but unremarkable."
"Overall, a very good beer. The bitterness is almost too much, particularly the aftertaste, which is quite mouth-drying. However, as the bottle progresses, it gets very tasty. I was underwhelmed at the beginning, but it started to open up for me. Very enjoyable."
"Quick review: Crystal clear orange with some thin white head. Nose is like fruit loops: orange, lime, lemon and a little cereal grain. Palate is crisp and bitter right off the bat! Lemon, lime and the big orange. A little pine, but very citrusy. Bitter and dry finish. Texture is a little lacking in bottle form. Draft version I recently enjoyed had better texture."
"Overall-Stone says this beer will """Ruin your Palate""" which is pretty true, don't think I can drink something after this one. I recommend sipping it, especially if your planning on drinking a bomber on your own. As the beers temp rises you get more citrus which is really nice. Great beer to finish the day with."
"I've definitely rank a couple of IPA's higher on my list than this one. Pliny and Green Flash to name two West Coast and Captain Lawrence and Flower Power on the East Coast. This one is easily in the top 10, just not at the very top of the list. Will drink this again."
"Medium carbonation with a light body make this very easydrinking."
"O: This is an amazing beer. It is very hopforward but very complex at the same time. Stone did a great job on keeping this a west coast styled IPA and still keeping it somewhat balanced. Don't hesitate, pick up a sixer or a bomber today! Cheers"
"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Best by date is 4/11/11. Pours a bright, slightly cloudy yellow orange with a finger of foam. Nice carbonation. Great lacing. I love the way this beer smells. Lightly sweet and oh so hoppy. Mango, orange peel, and peach. The malt lies submissively underneath it all. It knows its roll. Carbonation is spot on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Grapefruit and pine flavors play lightly on the palate. Not too resiny so it goes down relatively light and easy. Finish is dry, long, and hoppy. This is where the IBUs get you. Its not until long after you swallow that you feel like you've been chewing on a mouthful of fresh hops. Still one of my favorite DIPAs. I don't know how Stone managed to craft such a hoppy, bitter beer and keep the flavors light enough to make it very drinkable but I'm glad they are keeping it up!"
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its unabashed hoppiness. Many IPAs and even DIPAs will go lighter on the hop flavoring, while delivering much of it to the nose. Here there is a wonderful amalgamation of taste and aroma, where the flavors and smells seem to match up expertly, making this a contender for the style."
"-Cheers"
"This beer held up well despite consuming near its best by date. I know its not what it is fresh but it is still nice with some time on it. I definetly want to try this beer as fresh as possible."
"Overall, this is a solid Double IPA, but I've had better. Looks and smells great, but I would have liked a more robust flavor."
"D: Extremely drinkable from a taste perspective. Deliciously smooth and flavorful. The slightly high ABV at 7.7 keeps this from being an all nighter."
"D - Enjoyable...could easily indulge and put back a couple of these."
"CLoudy amber with little to no head apparent. Smell was great. yeasty hoppy malty. It smelled like one great ipa. this taste was not what im looking for in an ipa. too strong for my liking. I want to be able to taste something after. i understand that ipas will do this but it should be the first one that i have had all day. over all i will not be getting this again. not saying its bad just not for me."
"D - If you're a bitter beer fan, this is your brew; for others who prefer a good drink, I would try to find something else; another classic hopped beer from Stone; keep them coming"
"D: Bitter and dry, but remains very drinkable. Alcohol isn't terribly noticable in nose or taste either."
"D: just one of those all-time great imp IPA's. readily available and a beer everyone should sample if they like big hoppy beers."
"M - Light, well rounded bitterness. Light-medium body."
"drinkability - very drinkable if you are in the mood for a hop bomb and i could see knocking back a couple of these in a single (aggressive) sitting, but dont expect to pick up the subtleties of a Belgain or wheat beer after it."
"D - hop-bomb, but relatively drinkable; think a single bomber is my buds' limit, though"
"MF: Still a little abrasive and doesn't have a lot of the body some DIPAs have, but very, very tasty."
"Solid example for the style. There are a few I like more but this beer fresh is one I'd never turn down. For the record...it's even better on tap. Although I'm sure that's assumed already."
"D- The alcohol is non existant. The flavor was interesting, and the beer was pleasant on the eyes an the nose. This goes down with almost no effort so I'll give it a 4.5. Not near the best tasting DIPA, but one of the easiest drinking."
"Slightly hazy apricot/yellow with a white head. The nose doesnt wow me. I get mild citrus notes, honey and a marijuana scent. A nice hoppy bitterness but nice and pleasant at the start. Pine, citrus with some boozy undertones. This is a dry beer with light carbonation and somewhat of a sweet finish. Probably to big for more than a couple but after my first big bottle, i'd say I could now go through three."
"OVERALL: Fantastic beer. This is what my hop-loving palate has been wanting for a long time. That said, most normal human beings will not be able to appreciate this beer. It is only for the strong, only for the hop-heads and only for the true believers. This is what American craft beer is supposed to be."
"Great easy drinking beer for this style, it seems bigger and bolder than the low abv suggests."
"HV"
"D: Easy drinking and delicious! I plowed through a 20 ounce pint glass of this accompanying a home made veggie burger and fries. An excellent meal companion beer, strong and clean, goes down easy. I am impressed , I think this is the best Stone beer I have tried. I would even consider paying the slightly obscene 20 bucks for a 6 pack I enjoyed it so much."
"Great job Stone!"
"D - the label boasts an almost abrasive bitterness, one that might be enough to turn those alway who are not brave enough for it's bitterness, but I found it very enjoyable and smooth. I'd definitely enjoy a six pack of this. My bomber was empty before I knew it."
"D- The aroma is the best part of this brew, still tastes excellent. The bitterness separates this from other great IPAs, which makes this unique. Bold name for a bold beer, highly recommend this one."
"D: Very easy and enjoyable to drink because it is so well balanced. I could easily throw a couple of these back."
"Overall I like this beer a lot. Not sure I would want to drink it all the time, but it's very good. I will certainly drink it again. Would love to try it on tap."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, clean, crisp, and medium bodied. The carbonation is perfect, and the weight of the beer is just enough to keep it from devolving into a watery mess while still teasing the tongue with every sip. Drinkability in this case is a matter of personal taste, as the bitter finish is very strong, but I happen to love that (and judging by the reviews for this, most people do.) Each sip starts out zesty and sparks the flavor cascade to start anew - it really is an awesome beer. Probably has become my go to six-pack for IPAs."
"D: This is a great beer and an equally great representation of it's style. Absolutly makes you want to reach for another one. Highly drinkable despite the fact that it's 7.7%. Stone definitly knows what they are doing!"
"In conclusion I truly appreciate the flavor of this stone brewing gem and am glad I tried it again. Now I know it is not the beer I thought it was, and that it is actually a truly great brew."
"drinkability - are you kidding? there's a reason they make this in a 22oz right?"
"Final thought - Price sucks $15 for a sixer? But it is a must for any IPA lover. Maybe even a staple"
"D- Very easy to drink. Lighter bodied than I'm used to in a DIPA. A bit weak in the nose as well, although what was there was really nice. Great bitter flavor while still keeping it balanced and not overwhelming. While it is very bitter I don't really consider it a palette wrecker because of the light body."
"I've had this beer many times and it's one of my favorites, I love it."
"I will end up buying this one again. Good stuff!"
"Medium body and carbonation, sticky and dry, wraps around the tongue. Excellent drinking, alcohol is really masked and this is a total hop beat down. Great beer hands down."
"Overall: Tough to be totally certain. I know I enjoyed it. I'll have to revisit."
"This is a rich, bitter, and hoppy beer. I bought a couple bottle of this brew by Stone and had to back for more after i finished the first. If you are a hophead at heart this is the beer for you. I didn't detect the hints strong alcohol content. This is also not a beer you can pound because of the hoppy bitter notes."
"D: Might be tough to drink for some due to the high bitterness, but this is a great and readily available beer. It's a great go-to for anyone that loves hops and bitter beer."
"Is this a bad beer? No. I can see why some people might like it a lot. I like more citrus, less pine, sweeter malt and just better flavor. Of course, taste is subjective. If you're a hop head, you need to give this a try and decide for yourself.."
"D - The amount of hops in this is almost too much. I love it, but I think I'd have to cleanse my pallet after one of these before attacking another. It gets to be too much after a while. You need to give yourself a break from the hop onslaught."
"poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass, this beer pours a nice straw color with good carbonation and a 1 1/2 finger sticky white head that laces the glass. The smell is piney and citrus and it sticks with you. the taste folows the smell with a huge hop flavor and very little malt character. this beer is dry and bitter and full of flavor. the mouthfeel is great. good carbonation leaves you wanting more. the drinkablity is high for us hopheads. overall a very solid dipa."
"About as drinkable as an incredibly hopped, super-high IBU beer can be."
"the stone perfection that started me down the path to hopheaded bliss."
"D: Smooth and dry with the hops coming through. Very good IPA."
"D: High. There are a lot of great flavors intermingling here, I could drink this for a while without getting bored."
"Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"D-Soooo drinkable, this just may be the best DIPA I've ever had, I don't know how they do it but this is just another exceptional beer from Stone."
"Drinkablity - Serve this to your dormitory frat wannabe's"
"Upon re-drinking this beer at every chance, and despite the rather hefty pricetag, this remains one of the top IPAs and all-around top beers in the US."
"D: The drinkability is not very high for me because I'm not a real big fan of IPA's in general but this was definitely the best I've had. I wouldn't have this over and over again though. Overall, a good Beer but just not my style."
"Drinkability - This is an outstanding beer. What aroma and flavors!!! At 7.7 ABV one would need to take the time with this one, but it's so easily drinkable that it makes it difficult. I can just imagine drinking this on a beautiful Spring day. Worth a try and, for sure, one that I will pick up again and again."
"A simply wonderful IPA. I will have another."
"D - I could drink this one all day, but beware that it will rock your tastebuds so you shouldn't immediately follow one of these with any beer that you want to taste."
"I like how the hops shine to many dipas can't balance this well and end up tasting like a barley wine"
"D- Super easy drinking. I don't know if the ratings bear this out, but I would say this is just a quarter-step behind IRS, making it my second favorite Stone beer. A super easy drinking beer, by IIPA standards."
"Drinkability. A great drinker. ABV is well hidden and the taste is something I can't get enough of."
"D: Really great hop character and good amount of bitterness. I will be getting this one again for sure!"
"I love IPAs, and while I couldn't drink them all the time, this is a beer that truly tests that statement. Incredibly tasty DIPA, and one of my favorite brews in the world!"
"M&D- A great drinkable beer. A full character that kills any kind of taste other than hops. Smooth and tickling from the carbonation."
"D: Very good. An excellent Double IPA, one I would maybe use as an example of the style to newbies. The smell is the only thing that isn't really great about this beer, so I see why there are double dry hopped versions of this beer."
"Anyways, nice medium pour down the middle, moderate to good retention with some lacing. Color a harvest yellow slightly pale & incandescent. Hops firm assertive grapefruit, amarrilo maybe? with some lingering hop flavor from dry hopping. A in your face tour de force of hops but to me a little one dimensional although a good one at that. enjoyed but prefer to be Lucky rather than just good."
"D- Really good beer with so much flavor in there. Gotta grab it if you see it, def worth a try."
"Not Stone's best offering in this style but still worth a try."
"This beer pours a rich copper in color with a one finger white head a ton of carbonation. This beer has a lot of activity going on. The second I opened this I got hit in the face with hops. There is a good combination of pine and citrus, which are fighting for dominance. You definitely get your money's worth here. The flavors are very hoppy, as expected. I get a lot of pine and grapefruit with a good amount of bitterness. It drinks very fresh and very crisp and has an excellent crisp bite to finish. It's a very drinkable IPA and doesn't leave behind the severe cotton mouth that some IPAs do. I really like this beer but do prefer their 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA to it."
"If your a fan of hops I would suggest giving it a try, this will defiantly enter my regular rotation of drinks!"
"D: Very enjoyable and fine to drink moderately quickly despite the bitterness. Great example of a DIPA; its availability and clearly stamped date on the bottle mean Ruination regularly rotates through my fridge."
"Very highly recommended."
"Stone is so consistant with offering great hoppy beers"
"D. I would definitely pick this up again but not sure for what. It would go very well with pork chops and applesauce but not with a baseball game."
"d: really drinkable. i love it."
"I would not hesitate to give two Schlitz for an eight-month-old Ruination."
"Pours a medium orangish-amber color, with a nice head that sticks around for a little bit. The smell is really good- mostly citrus and hops. Great lacing on the glass. The taste is like a big hop bomb, but it's really good, and amazingly smooth. Citrus, floral, grassy overtones w/ the taste, w/ malt in the background. Mouthfeel is pretty amazing. For such a hopbomb, this beer is amazingly smooth and drinkable. One of my favorites for sure. At 7.7%, it's not going to catch up w/ you either... Stone Ruination is definitely on my short list of DIPA's, the boys at Stone did it again. Cheers!"
"Medium body and quite drinkable."
"enjoy"
"Drinkability: As with most hoppy brews, this brew is crisp and refreshing, but it lacks complexity."
"D: Gets a little heavy toward the end, but still pretty decent."
"Ruination is only my second beer from Stone, and as a huge hophead, I couldn't wait to try it. I'm nothing if not impressed, and can only hope the rumors of Stone coming to Missouri are true, so I can make this a regular addition to my fridge."
"The big thing with this beer is that it will catch you off guard with every sip. It really does open sweet and fruity before descending into bitterness."
"Everything you could want in an IIPA. The color is spot-on: amber with a very faint haze, a moderate amount of tiny carbonation bubbles, and good head retention with tons of sticky lace. The first whiff is pine with an underlying caramel characteristic. In this bottle, I also perceived a rose or lilac like floral aroma, but that might just be me (or the glassware). Balance is superb, tons of resinous hops with just enough sugar to keep things in check. A bit of carbonation up front, some alcohol in the middle (which quickly fades), and a long bitter finish. With a medium to medium-heavy body what else could one ask for except another (or a draft)."
"I would say this beer has high drinkability. Its on the lower end of the scale for double or imperial IPAs in the ABV department, which make it nice for having a couple. So, I could definitely drink a few of these in a night."
"This is by far the best IPA i have ever tried. It also goes good with a super sweet strawberry rhubarb pie. the bold flavors of the beer complement the boldness of the pie."
"Get one"
"D - very drinkable, if you are not afraid of the hops burning your tongue. seriously, this beer is great! not as great as...but price wise, it's a deal. will be drinking this brew again for sure."
"Notes: Nice, nice, this is a revisit after along time, I think, not so sure. But be as it may this time I am enjoying it quite a bit and don´t find it blah at all, I don´t sense the burst of breaking hops, I believe I ruined my palate long ago, but this is still rather enjoyable."
"Just another great IPA from Stone Brewery..always look forward to their great line of IPA's."
"This beer is an amber hue with foamy lacing that is intimidating at first. The smell is very hoppy floral and citrus. The beer is an American IPA on steroids. The hop bitterness dominates the whole time. From start to finish. It leaves a fairly dry finish, but is a bit laborious to drink. An amazing slow drinker."
"The 2nd 1/2 of the bottle had a bit more balance. This brew is only for extremely bitter folk. Would I buy this again? Probably not---I want a little more balance.."
"Final Notes: Yet another impressive beer by the Stone Brewing Company. Their huge beers never cease to impress, and this is no exception. A solid example of the style and one I will return to. Just waiting to be paired with some spicy Asian or Mexican food."
"DRINKABILITY: I loved this brew. The smashing hit of hops, perhaps the beer's dominant characteristic, is an absolute delight -- a gastronomical achievement that I'm much impressed with. I can't wait to drink it again."
"Recently did a Ruination/Hardcore/Tesco American Double IPA challenge and the Ruination, despite being only one day away from its expiry date,was still pretty fine with much more finesse and complexity and a cleaner palate."
"I can't believe I haven't gone out of my way to review this beer! Poured lightly for a 2-finger head, reduces to light bubbly film, impressively sticky lacing, color is a typical slightly cloudy amber orange. Aroma is loaded with hops, citrus and grapefruit, and some pine as well. Taste is described the same, but with a well-balanced malt profile, matching perfectly with the hops. Waiting too long between sips causes great bitterness on the palate, so whether to wait or sip again is win/win. I love this beer."
"D: I love Ruination and grab it every chance I can. I enjoyed the growler, but think I will go with the bottle next time as the carbonation was a bit light and I think this may be improved with the bottle."
"Overall, a fairly smooth hop grenade. Well worth a try."
"glass: snifter."
" ~ This is the kind of brew you enjoy ritualistically. What I mean is, you find a reason to drink it."
"Felt good on the tongue and didn't notice much of the alcohol. Would definitely buy more if it was available locally!"
"All-in-all I'd call it a good beer, but it didn't quite do it for me. Nothing too spectacular, but another solid offering from Stone."
"Pours a clear amber/copper with a big fluffy white head that falls to thick, sticky curtains of lace. The Aroma is hoppy and sharp, with a bright sting of citrus. The flavor is largely hop - piny resin, deep grapefruit and lemon - but it has a toasty, wheaty malt behind it that balances the hop nicely. At least until that back-end bitterness kicks in - it is satisfying and rich, like sucking on lemon zest, and it lingers long on the finish. This is a beer that rewards slow drinking and enjoying long after the beer has passed down the throat."
"This is the most bitter beer I have had so far. Every sip was like I just put a hop pellet in my mouth."
"If you're looking for a great tasting beer that pairs wonderfully with spicy food, look no further."
"D - Would definitely drink this again. This is a very good IPA."
"Smells great, tastes good."
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours dull orange with yellow hints and light and fluffy white foam which forms in drifts around the sides of the glass. A candy floss sweetness with a stabby hop flavour underneath. Quite fruity in a slightly tropical way. Very promising multi-layered aroma. Big, hard-hitting hops threaten to overwhelm but just as they teeter on the edge of too-muchness they recede somewhat but too much for me to handle. What follows is a candied peach smoothness. The after effects contain much hoppy bitterness but the fruit lingers too. Tingly in the mouth. Smooth and oily thick. Bracingly bitter. Thick, pungent hop aroma however. I'll stick to Stone IPA or Pale Ale here."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite Stone beers that is easily accessible. Not quite the same league as the """big boys""" but it is a very very enjoyable beer that I'm never disappointed by."
"This is a benchmark example of the style. I will always get it when fresh."
"Starts with a pale malt flavor but this gives way to strong bitterness, particularly in the swallow and aftertaste. Moderate body with a slightly below-average carbonation. A hop lovers dream."
"The CPJ"
"This is a fantastic beer, but I would recommend one bottle at a time."
"Overall - Certainly not a weak beer. I decided to take my time with this beer and enjoyed it quite a bit. The alcohol is a little strong in the taste, but not overwhleming. Overall, quite good."
"D: Every anticipated sip led to me wanting more and more. Sure it's not the typical session beer with the higher, very well hidden ABV. I could easily find myself having two or three of these in one sitting without feeling the least bit guilty about what I paid per bottle. Outstanding beer and must try for DIPA fans!!! One of the top five in DIPA's in my opinion."
"22 oz. bomber pour into a snifter to get all the aroma I can. Pours a nice golden apricot color with a white foam head that quickly disappears. The aroma is great. Pungent grapefruit, light floral and hoppy goodness. The taste is a grapefruit blast followed by a hop bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Very long finish. Non-hophead's please look elsewhere. While there is a lot of in your face bitterness this is quite drinkable. 7.7% enables multiples and the beer is great which makes me want more. I know this is a little pricey for a sixer or bomber but in the end it is well worth the dinero. Great stuff."
"D - Deliciously drinkable. A liquid poem to the glory of the hop."
"D - Drinkability was not bad, though I expected less liquor-ish aroma and aftertaste."
"Love it, drink it!!!"
"D: Love it. A great IPA for hop-heads."
"This brew will cause my ruination. One finger head of white foam, some lace, but little cling. Color gets the rating better, lovely hazy 7 on the SRM chart, looks very drinkable. Smells are aromas of more citrus than is in the book. Taste are flavors of lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit, pine, pine wood...bark, earthy nodes. Full of bounce in my mouth, filling, creamy. Great bitter beer...but I chew on lemons. More for my pleasure."
"This is an excellent imperial IPA, highly enjoyable. I'll be looking for it."
"D: It said on the bottle to store at cellar temperature. I know this is an IPA, but if you're looking for a more mellow experience, you might want to leave it in there for a bit. This was a brew designed by hopheads to please more hopheads."
"Poured from bottle (exp. date 2/28/11) into Leffe glass. Pours blonde golden with tiny white head that fades to a collar quickly with no lacing. Smell is tinny and subtle, some pine, slightly spicy hops. Taste is mostly bitter hops backed up by a bit of alcohol. Some pale malt but overall a very dry beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium carbonation. Not a bad beer, but not the Ruination I remember. I would buy the bomber again, but there are much better beers available in 6 packs that I would take a pass on this in the future."
"The beer is a briht, cloudy golden color. It pours from the cask with a 1 and a half inch foamy, light, white head. The nose is a blend of pine and hops, a little heavier to the pine scents. The beer is much smoother on cask, with heavy hops undertones. There is a bitter aftertaste, with an extremely smooth finish. The cask not only smooths out the beer itself, but also brings out the pine flavors that are more muted in the draft version. Very good beer!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but that 7.7% ABV will sneak up on you. Also, this much flavor will fill you up fast."
"Drinkability: A tasty beer and a treat for all fans of hops. Fantastic beer that's not a brewer's dare based on too much alcohol and hops. What all IPAs should be."
"If you are a true """hop head""" his one's for you. Enough IBUs for the entire crew. If you are a novice, stay away and leave it for someone who appreciates a work of art. Not for the Harpoon/Sam Adams fans. Body is just right, aroma when you pop the cap is fantastic. If you are sampling a few different beers this will ruin your pallet for the rest of the day as nothing compares to the bitterness and everything after tastes like water. Pricey but worth the $. Hop feel lingers and lingers. Congrats Stone! Truly a winner!"
"This is a classic Stone brew! Amazingly similar to Stone IPA, just amped up. Very enjoyable, highly recommended."
"D - Definitely and IPA you can have more than one."
"This is a Top 3 DIPA for me when fresh no doubt. When I can find it less than one month old in Michigan I buy it everytime!"
"A bomber is a little too much for me. One glass and I'm good. This is a massive IPA that is for """professional""" IPA drinkers. Readily available but just a little too much bite for my taste."
"Stone never fails to impress. Got some of these from my wife for my birthday. Awesome."
"This should be a standard for any Hop-Head, IPA fan. Stone always comes through with great beers. Cheers!"
"The drinkability was high for me, as I'm a hophead and love most of the Stone products. If you're looking for a great, almost taste-bud numbing IPA that you can quaff down and get a buzz from, then this is your beer; it always delivers - always!"
"Ruination pours a light brownish orange with a 1 finger head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice spiderweb lacing. Smell is of piney hops with bready malt. Taste is a smack to the face of piney and citrusy hops. There is also a delicious malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very crisp with a linger oily hop residue. The aftertaste sticks with you. I find drinkability to be quite high, but I dont believe an hop novice would. Delicious!"
"D - I am going to have to support Stone and buy a few more of these. Perfect for that hot day at the beach!"
" Overall I rate this way up in the IPA's I have tasted. If there is a better one I can't wait to find it. 9.5 of 10. Beginner IPA drinkers beware, you either will love the IPA's after this, or avoid them completely :-)"
"The palate opens with a pleasing, pungent bitterness with pine needles, juicy grapefruit and quite a bit of flavor with citrus and pine again. Unlike some other San Diego-style IPAs, this leans a little heavier on the bittering hops, and is all the better for it. Juicy and resiny, this is pretty excellent. Again, the sweetness is low, but substantial and complex enough to add a lot to this beer. Mild caramel and mildly toasty/biscuit-like, it perfectly accents the hops. While this beer is light in body, the oily, resiny character does make it seem bigger than it is, and the moderate carbonation make for an excellent beer. I was supposed to savor this, but damn, did I inhale it. Exceptional stuff, I will drink this more often, despite the rather high price."
"D - Very drinkable if you know what you are getting into; this is not an entry level IPA. Hops dominate."
"A great DIPA and a must."
"D: Very rich and filling, hard to drink more than one, but the incredible flavor and good mouth feel has me reaching for more."
"O: A great example of the style, and a hop monster for sure, especially fresh (this one is only a month old). If you're looking for a bitter beer, look no further than Ruination"
"I will adjust this review if the taste is different in the future."
"Drinkability is good in my opinion for an IPA. Goes down clean."
"I'm enjoying this too much to be bothered with an in-depth review, but will do one next time - I'll certainly be getting this again!"
"Pours a nice light burnt orange with a nice eggshell head and some nice lacing. Aroma of floral citrus hops fill the senses imparting a nice fruity boquet. Taste is sweet floral citrus hops with some light tones of malt. Palate is nice full body, very nice carbonation. Finish is nice floaral citusy hops with a nice fruity body ending in a dry alcohol nuttiness. Overall a very nicely balanced DIPA"
"D. This beer is a real treat, and one I can't wait to have again."
"I started a relationship with Ruination and while the passion-filled riptide of extreme hops immediately overwhelmed me, it slowed down as the first sip reached my stomach, leaving a long-lasting piney bitterness holding onto my taste buds for dear life. Each sip afterward was continuously filled with dramatic pine needles and grapefruit rind hops and never left me disappointed (until I finished the beer, of course). Undertones of sweet pale malts rolled out from under all the hops for the briefest moments right at the end, forming an arching backbone just looking for a good, quick scratch before being washed over by a final wave of lemon peel and herbal resin. The mouthfeel was consistently medium, especially with the rich flavors, and was rather silky and creamy even with the good amount of spicy carbonation. It wasn't exactly smooth, but it was easy to drink and really quite delicious."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Just under medium bodied and very smooth. The carbonation feels very good in the mouth. This beer is bitter in the extreme, but I still find it pretty damn drinkable. Drinking a full bomber will wreck the palate, however."
"Drink - A solid beer that I would be happy to drink again anytime. Worth checking out if you happen to see it on the shelves."
"I truly enjoyed this offering from Stone, and look forward to having my taste buds wrecked again in the near future. Rock on!"
"D-although I wouldn't drink a whole 6 pack in one sitting, this is top on my list the next time I want a double ipa."
"Although I wouldn't be putting back 5 of these. At risk of losing all taste sensation in my mouth for weeks. Regardless - another great one, Stone."
"A bomber. Pours golden-amber with a small but long lived white head. Aroma of piney, citrusy hops and biscuit malt. Medium, sharp body. Huge amount of citrusy, piney hops dominate the palate with sweet malt and ripe fruit provide great balance. Hoppy, dry, never ending finish. Great, complex IPA."
"D -This has great drinkability. I could drink these all the time. It goes down easy and I find it very refreshing. This is one of my favorite DIPAS. I can't wait to get some more of these."
"A good readily available dipa."
"This beer pours a deep yellow, almost copper color, with a white head. The smell strong with citrus hops. The taste is a strong citrus hop flavor. Not getting much from the malt, from it being overpowered by the hops, and yet its in a good way. The mouthfeel is somewhat light and yet not medium. It is drinkable. Maybe ive just gotten use to ipa but I thought it was a very good beer."
"Drinkability is surprising with this amount of hops. Bitterness is lingering, but what do you expect when you pop this beer open."
"O: Right in Stone's wheel house and they wasted no time knocking it out of the park. Great IPA."
"You can't drink too many of these without the ruination of your palate, which detracts from the drinkability. But, this is a must have brew for any hop lover."
"The bottle warns you of how this beer wrecks your palate, so don't even try to eat anything you really want to enjoy while drinking this beer. other than that I wish I always had a steady supply of this beer because one could drink this every night. HIGHLY recommend this beer. Epitome of west coast IPAs."
"Appealing bottle and silly writeup on how good the beer included with every Stone beer..."
"d - This is a very strong brew. When I picked up a six-pack, I had every intention of having more than one that night. As it turned out, one was plenty."
"D - I was quite surprised by the drinkability of this brew. Yes, it is hoppy, but if you're an IPA fan then you will find a lot to like about this beer."
"D = very. I took a few sips before glancing at the 7.7% abv, I was surprised. Really drinkable."
"22 oz bomber poured a beautiful hazy orange with huge bubbly white head which stuck to the glass nicely. Nice hop aroma with some pine and earthiness. Taste is like bam! of bitterness. Medium body. Nice hop flavor but super bitter. Quite drinkable for 7.7 abv."
"D: Overrated. Although it's not unilaterally hoppy, it's definitely unbalanced. Too bitter and overwhelming to be drinkable. 7.7%, but it feels a lot stronger. Tentatively recommended..."
"Carbonation is a little high, cuts through the malt too much."
"D - I could only have a few of these before my palate gave out."
"Drink: It's clean... It's crisp... It's complex... Some will tell you to only have one. I will tell you that it is very addicting and as a HUGE fan of ALL I.P.A.'s, I urge you to have another. I doubt I would have to twist your arm though..."
"Pretty good, though I do like a bit more balance in a DIPA. This isn't the most exciting or interesting beer of its style but that isn't really what they were going for either."
"Drinkability -- This is what immediately comes to mind when I think of West Coast IPA's, even though it's considered a DIPA. While it might not be the standard bearer of it's style, cough-Pliny-cough, but it's certainly one of the archetypes. Amazing aroma, good hop profile. Total hop-head maker. Now if only they could get the price down..."
"d- great beer, looks pretty good, tastes and smells great and those are the things that matter the most"
"D- This definitely is more of a one beer scenario for me. I love double IPAs, but only within some moderation. And make sure you don't try anything tasty after having this, your tastebuds will pretty much be useless. I urge all to try one sometime."
"Intensely good, but at the same time, intensely intense. Too much would be sensory overload. A bomber is money."
"D: really love the way this brew drinks. Smooth yet definitly there"
"Drinkability:Surprisingly easy to drink for the style, The mouth feel will wear you out before the ABV does."
"Picked up a 6 pack of this one up in Highland for about 16 bucks, figuring it was a better deal than the bombers. Poured a medium golden color, medium carbonation and a little white head. Huge floral hoppy aroma, but not much else; the nose is all hops, in a good way. On the palate, this one is light to medium bodied, with a sweet backbone and a ton of hops. A very drinkable and delicious DIPA."
"D - If you're a fan of DIPAs, you will love to drink this beer. That said, the bitterness and strong hoppyness will undoubtedly turn off many drinkers. Even as a huge fan of IPAs and DIPAs I probably wouldn't drink more than one in an evening, and I'd make it my last beer, because the bitterness does indeed dominate your palate. This is not a negative, just a reinforcement of the warning on the bottle. A wonderful beer, but with so much hop it takes some effort to drink. And at 7.7% it is a little weak for a DIPA."
"A very good beer with a powerful punch."
"Poured from a bomber a beautiful hazy bright yellow with a thick frothy rocky head that dissapated and left lacing for the entire beer. The smell is that of citrus and grass hops with a small bready malty undertone. The taste is not dominated by the hops that the smell begs you to think. This beer is wonderfully balanced with bready bisucuity malts and warming alcohol with nice citrus/piney hop undertone. Not a bitting or bitter taste but a clean smooth balance between malt and hops has almost a creamy smooth mouthfeel. The drinkability of the strong IPA is very pleasant and I could easily have more than just one."
"This is one of the few IPAs I've had that I honeslty enjoyed almost as much as a Pliny. For me, this easily beats out Sculpin and any number of other contenders. Damn. I'll be buying this a lot."
"D - Stone can do no wrong in my opinion."
"D - I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm not a huge fan of hoppy beers. But this is nice. While I can't say I'd like this all the time, I'd definitely like to revisit it."
"D- A very nice IPA, although the IBUs come through to make this a beer that is not for the faint of heart."
"They have similar tastes but this one comes out with more of a grapefruit smell taste and bitterness but still holds the same citrus pine like character as the regular Stone IPA has. The lasting bitterness can really prove this IPA or double IPA is really the real deal here. When everyone talks about American IPA this should be the very first one they mention. This is a hop bomb but thats not to say theres some malty full body sweetness in there which there is at the very beginning of the sip. You can't even detect the alcohol on this one either because of the pungent hops. This is my favorite bitter IPA of all time."
"Poured from a bottle. Very good beer. Love the bitter. Aroma of citrus and pine. As others have commented, great color and aroma. I would prefer a fuller body on the palate. A bit thin for me, but a nice clean finish. Would enjoy this on a warm day with a burger or steak."
"Overall: I like it. The finish is a little strong, but beyond that it's a very good IPA."
"D: Very drinkable, the key flavors and overall killer taste, make this one a classic for the style. A bit high in price, but still a really classic brew."
"Hazy golden orange hugh with a nice white head which fades to a ring that clings to the glass leaving some rather nice lacing. The beer is kind of opaque. Juicy hop blast to the nose. Balanc of pine and citrus, bit of fruityness. A hop assualt on the tongue. Combo of resinous pine, citrus hops on the palate matched with a super bitter hop finish. Clearly a good bit of crystal malt flavor going on. If there is such a thing as a regular mouthfeel this has got it. Because of the high bitterness I'm not sure how much of this I can put back, but it sure is good."
"This is a great DIPA that's widely available for semi-reasonable prices (I got this bomber for 7 bucks with tax). A good introduction to the style."
"D - It's a sipper, but went very well with my meal of dry aged new york strip steak!"
"Drinks easy. Hops, fruits, malts blend well. Ends dry on tip of tongue. A much easier drinker than implied by the name """ruination""". But still a good brew."
"Overall: The hop aroma in this beer oddly doesn't fully give the full story as to just how bitter this beer truly is. It has a beautiful hop nose, but the bitterness and flavor far out weigh the aroma. This is liquid hops. Citric and grassy hops are highlighted in ways that I've only seen otherwise in fresh hop beers."
"This is a mean mother of a beer. It pours so innocently with a beautiful golden color. Smells strongly of grapefruit and pine. Then you taste it. and it destroys your mouth in the best way possible. Pure hoppy goodness all around, but never so overpowering that you cannot drink it. Its one of those beers, that if you like hops, you have to drink again and again. And I do."
"This is a citrus hopfest. Although it's not as harsh or bitter than I thought it would be. It's actually very tasty. The nose is glorious! The hop profile is very flavorful and the malt does it's job. Too bad it's so expensive."
"Drinkability: Definitely one for sipping, but I could not have more than one a night. It does after awhile leave me tasting nothing but hops (as forewarned) so I think some care would be needed in pairing this with a meal. Still - a pleasant experience and worth revisiting again."
"Note: I don't know how old this bottle was - it was dated to drink by 11/8/10 even though I just bought it 10/15/10. Maybe it takes a while to get to Wisconsin. Poured with a huge head that left a nice bit of lacing. This one is all about the hops, hops, and bitter hops. I really wish there was more of a malty backbone to this beer, it's not very well rounded. It's intense hops without much more going on here. I found it exteremely bitter and I prefer IPAs with more going on or a sweet hop character - I've become a bit of a hophead but don't go for a flatly bitter taste in my hops. This one had kind of a one dimensional hop quality of bitter. This may have something to do with an older sample but I found it to be good but uninspiring. I've had some really good IPAs in the last week Surly Wet, Mpls Town Hall Fresh Hop, Ballast Point Sculpin, Alpine Pure Hoppiness. This one was good but I didn't think it lived up to the hype or to those. I'd like to try this fresher to see if it was just that bottle. I'd try this again but won't go out of my way for it."
"If there is a better hoppy beer out there please let me know. I would love to try it."
"(D) Very drinkable! It does burn the palate though so if you are doing a beer tasting, save this one for last."
"overall, great beer, would def buy again, very crisp, smooth, amazing beer"
"D: it drank very good and was a decent interpretation of a west coast style IPA. For the most part Stone has sold offerings in the bitterness department."
"Drink: a tasty IPA, but its drinkability is detracted by the sheer punishing quality of its hoppiness. I think about Ruination the way I think about a double-shot of vodka: I'm drinking this for a purpose, and it sure as hell isn't for the nuance."
"You wouldn't want to drink a lot of these in a row, but you might be tempted if you're feeling in the mood for a nice cool carbonated spiked hop tea. This is a hard IIPA/DIPA to beat."
"D a classic superb example of the style perhaps a little better in the bottle but still great"
"D: Not the most drinkable beer, but far better than expected after reading the bottle. The light body and interesting complexity helps a lot. Still, it is hard to through something back with this much hops and alcohol."
"D: Great. I could drink this any time, any place."
"Ruination is an excellent example of a west coast style IPA every step of the way. It pours an orange amber with ample foamy head. Smells of evergreen, bitter hops and citrus. Feels great in your mouth, complimentary carbonation, and well masked alcohol. I also highly appreciate the fact that you can get a six pack of ruination fairly readily."
"Kind of light mouthfeel. Very drinkable. I could see myself drinking quite a few."
"Tangy bitterness explains it. This is a strong flavored beer with a citrus aftertaste. It is a very nice IPA."
"(Bomber into snifter; golden orange; seafoam bone head.)"
"Stone Ruination IPA has a cloudy orange colour. The head is decent but fades fast due to light carbonation. The smell is of citrussy hops (grapefruit) - very nice. This initial taste is of bitter grapefruit hops and fading into an aftertaste that is bitter and tangy."
"I know that this drink deserves a higher taste rating, but until I get a fresher bottle I have to go with what I tasted, which was a great smooth beer with good tasting hops that tasted a little dated and diminished. I will gladly drink my 3 of these and update my rating later when I find a fresher bottle. Otherwise, solid 4.5's all around."
"Holy hops, Batman! That was the expectation with this 100+ IBU touted IPA. What I found was a beer with strong hop presence nicely balanced by malt sweetness, making this a great choice for both hop-heads and non-hopheads alike. A nice consistent head and lacing, along with a pronounced floral nose, makes this a treat for all the senses. To me, what an IPA is all about."
"D: I probably won't have this again. That's not to say that it was terrible, just not nearly as good as other beers of this style."
"Cheers..."
"D- Great beer, more drinkable than it should be, have to make myself not drink it too fast. Alcohol isn't noticeable with such high IBUs, could drink a few of these but a session out of it would make for a short night, this beer is just too drinkable to have more than one at a time."
"Still highly recommended!"
"Overall Ruination lives up to it's namesake, and the only complaint I have is that it's not readily available to me here in Kansas. Very solid example of the double IPA style, and yet another in a long line of incredible Stone beers."
"D - A couple of these and I would be done."
" Gimme more please!"
"Anyone who enjoys craft beer should try this ale."
"Drinkability: Good but not great. I love Ruination and I love hops, but somehow I get a lil' tired of this one after my first pint. Also, I don't feel like it is big enough for a DIPA. More of a regular West Coast IPA, a la Green Flash."
"thanks MasterSki for sending this gem my way, I see why this is ranked as high as it is there's very little to complain about other then the headache I'll have tomorrow"
"The taste is just more of the same. I can tell there is some malt in here but hell if I can tell you anything about it. This is hop forward. I recall talking to Greg once at Pazzos in Lexington and he mentioned how this was one of the first double IPAs and how others have gotten bigger with theirs. Yeah this could be just an IPA by some brewers standards (heck it comes off less heavy than stone ipa imo). I think of 90 minute as the standard for double IPAs...this just blows it out of the water."
"Quite drinkable and refreshing. One bomber is enough for me."
"If you like IPAs/DIPAs, you have to try this. If you're not a hops fan, meanwhile, this is one to steer clear of."
"Out of all the Stone beers that ive got this is prob the one im most looking forwards to as its not everyday i get to drink these brews but anyway it pours a beautiful see through tangello hue with really nice carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head with heaps of lacing everywhere,it really does smell as it good as it looks with massive hints of passionfruit,grapefruit,strong pine resin and some peach,it has a nice fullish sticky mouthfeel which really coats the inside of your mouth and leaves you with tastes of pine,passionfruit,lychee,stonefruits and you also get a touch of caramel malts with the hoppy fruit sensation that ends with a nice kick of biterness but not over the top bitterness for a hop head like me which really gives this brew the highest for drinkability because the alcohol is well hidden behind a beautiful taste that is nicely balanced in my mind and by all means this brew will be a staple brew for me im really digging it."
"This is an amazing beer. Perfectly balanced, complex hops of pine and citrus with an earthy backbone matched up with just the right amount of sweetness to bring it full circle. The mouthfeel is exceptional with a smooth buttery character which is rich but not too thick. Looks good with a nice sheet of thin lacing down the entire glass. The aroma is a nice preview of the intense flavor that is about to hit your pallet. One of my all time favorite beers that I buy whenever I get the chance."
"The beer pours a light yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of orange and pine hops. The beer just smells hoppy. The flavor is a lot of bitter oranges with some caramel malt mixed in. The flavor is very juicy. High bitterness, but still pretty drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D. AWESOME very solid IPA enjoyed very much..."
"Clear caramel pour with a medium, pillowy white head. Typical IIPA aroma, big hops, some pine. Flavor initially gave two immediate impressions: 1) the palate was slightly heavy, as if the malt was just slightly overpowering the hops, and 2) a faint but noticeable presence of fruit that is not typical of this style, along the lines of mango or passion fruit. The tropical fruit impression is very nice. I wish the bitterness was a bit lower so those fruits could shine more. Thanks to my brother-in-law Chris."
"Overall this is one of the beers that got me into craft beer. This is a new classic Imperial IPA. It might not be as complex as some IIPAs but it sure is tasty. If you haven't had this beer: buy it."
"Overall a fabulously complex and balanced IPA. It is among the best I have ever had."
"Served out of a 1pint, 6 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass. Appearance, well...gorgeous. Mildly opaque brew, crisp golden color. Fluffy head, 2 finger-breadths, nice lacing. Scents of herbs, citrus and flowers persist in the nose. Starts with a good punch of malt flavor. Citrus and woody flavors begin to appear with warming alcohol throughout. While 100 IBU's made me think this would be a bitter offering from Stone, it was actually well balanced and had just the right amount of hops. Feels substantial in the mouth, you know you are drinking a worthy beer. Easily one of the most drinkable IPA's out there, and by far one of the most enjoyable. I will be keeping one of these around for a rainy day."
"Indeed a liquid poem to the glory of the hop. Had been waiting to get a fresh bottle to review and I have to say, it doesn't get better."
"Appears bright orange with smoth white head that disapates slowly and leaves some nice lace behind. Smell is all fruity hops like you just put your face in a bucket of them. Taste is all bitter hops but not in the way that ruins it for me.Moutfeel and drink are both right for the style, nothing special here. All around this is one of my favorites from stone so far."
"D - the only ding id give it here is that its so bitter that it would be hard to drink more than 1."
"golden orange a tad lighter in color with a nice head of something nice and sticky. but it looks like a decent IPA. nothing too showy. have has seem difference in bottles in aging. like most it mellows as it gets older. but it seems to age in two directions. either the hops mellow and the sweet honey malt quality comes out. the finish is bitter like day one though. or there is a tamer bitter and it seems to have an extremely robust floral quality. rather in your face lavender and pine. a good balance. there is many quality to this great beer. i really appreciate a imperial IPA with a lower ABV. more balance and less gravity. in the border of crisp and malty dessert."
"D: Very good. I remember back in the day when I thought this beer was too in-your-face hoppy. But now, years later, it seems only modestly bitter. This half-growler will be gone soon."
"Exceptional. Stone IPA is a att-time fave, but this just takes what I love about that beer and kicks it up a bunch of notches. What grabs me most is the smell---its amazing. Intense. Glorious. The color is typical amber-orange with a nice head retention and lacing. Taste is not as insane as one would expect---hops up the wazoo, yes---but very drinkable. Real juicy and bitter up front, but smooth---then finishes dry. Really an amazing beer. And at $4.50-5 a bomber locally, a steal. Love it and think it's time I get another glass full in front of me real soon. A must try!!"
"D - wow. This is a solid IPA. When I pick up new ones to try, this is how I hope they taste. Tgis was a pleasure to drink. Definitely recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry. Just what you'd expect from a west coast IPA."
"My favorite beer by Stone, and I like a lot of their beers."
"drinkability: Not as much as even some of the higher ABV DIPA's."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber with a generously apportioned, sticky, frumpy, craggy, mess of a white head. Aromas practically run the gamut of hop adjectives (minus """earthy""" and """woody"""), but are primarily citrusy, then piney and resinous, with floral notes to boot. I also detect a bit of caramel on the nose and a faint hint of alcohol, which is hardly surprising considering the abv. Taste-wise, the hops truly do perform an absolute palate-wipe. Unless you are eating something sweet and sticky ( like bbq ribs) or strong and greasy (like garlic fries), I wouldn't recommend this for a suitable pairing, but if such dishes are the case, you need search no further than this beer to find a match made in heaven."
"It's not very drinkable because of the intense hop dryness but that's what most people order this beer for. I knew what i was getting into when I ordered it and I don't regret a sip"
"M/D: It is creamy and medium bodied, nice carbonation and easy drinking. While it is quite drinkable, I don't plan on kicking back more than one of these in a night."
"D- this one is all about the hops and doesn't leave you short. Not for the faint of heart for sure. I took me some years to enjoy this brew but now I really dig it."
"Stone Ruination has a well-earned reputation as one of the best DIPA's. Immediately after opening, the beer bursts with hop aroma, notably grapefruit and orange rind. The beer was a tawny amber with a centimeter of foam floating on top of the ale. The beer is fiercely bitter with a lot of West Coast hop flavors, especially putteringly bitter and acidic Cascade hops. The mouthfeel was oily and thick from the hop resins. The malt takes a backseat in this beer and the hops really sing. This is a great beer and highly recommended"
"Fairly high carbonation and a full-bodied mouthfeel. Burst of cane sugar and grapefruit up front, some passing toasty malts, and a long, dry, tart finish of hoppy citrus, pepper, and pine. Though the initial flavors are well-balanced and very nice, the long finish really dominates. Drinkable and very tasty; the bitterness builds in a very pleasant way as the beer warms."
"D - Yummy and refreshing. ABV is not too crazy."
"Trying to brew something close to this is my homebrew goal."
"I've heard plenty about this beer and seen it on the shelves for a long time. Glad I finally tried this bad boy out."
"so easy to drink. tasty, refreshing with little alcohol harshness. One of my favorites, its even better fresh on tap."
"[ serving type: Chilled bottle poured into a glass]"
"D: It's a good IPA, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again. Not my favorite beer of this style."
"Drinkability - Truely a world class ipa, very hoppy, and the alcohol isnt over the top. You must really enjoy hops to fully understand what this is all about. Still after years of drinking this, i can come back to it and enjoy as much today as yesterday. The price on this is a little much, 14-19$ a six pack, so when i do drink this, i buy a case to counter the overlal price per bottle. Its worth it, top 5 double ipa on the planet, enough said."
"Truly an IPA with flamboyant flavors that really pop. Behind the initial whiff of floral, citrus bitterness, was a wall of strong malt backbone which held the hoppiness in check. Clearly they were going for a style which would blow your socks off and they sure succeeded. If I had any criticism it is that it lacked a bit of complexity in the hoppiness...the strongest hops seemed to drown out the more floral elements a tad, sort of like an orchestra where the brass overshadows the woodwinds. For a comparable style with more complexity, at least in this man's opinion, try the Green Flash West Coast IPA."
"Quite drinkable, better than I expected. Ive shyed away from the stones but this will definately open me back up to them. Quite a unique and pleasent expirience for the IPA drinker. As the bottle explains, not for the beginner! Will enjoy again, After I cycle through the Stones. Easy beer to drink too fast while reviewing! HA HA! DONT DRIVE!"
"solid mouthfeel, crisp with a medium body. i would not object to another. in the end, a strong IPA/DIPA that holds its own... though likely more appealing to fans of the bitter end of the style's spectrum."
"ive had this before and ill definatly have it again. i would really like to try this fresher next time, but as is, it still tasted amazing. the aroma didnt really live up to my expectations, but the taste exceeded them by far. highly recommended DIPA in my book!"
"drinkability: for a Stone double IPA, very easy to put down. couldn't put the glass down. Solid!"
"D- wheres the 7.7 on this ?! i cant find it an amazing brew a great example of a pimped ipa"
"A good ImpIPA but not great as its rating would indicate, guess its been well marketed though."
"Drink: Very good. I could drink a few of these, but I have to admit my palate would be wrecked if I had more than two. I don't even know if that's a fault or not, since this beers charm is in how extreme it is."
"D- Not that great, but I guess a little better than I expected for the hop profile. All in all a truly great beer."
"This is one of those beers that for me was just overhyped, and I never came around on it. Really nice amber appearance with very little head. I consider myself a big hophead, but this is one of the few big IPAs that I find really undrinkable. There is a really nice piney hop aroma and boy is the taste just a magnification of that smell. I just find Ruination to be too uncomplicated in its bitterness--an overload on hops as I often enjoy, but just in an unpleasant manner. Certainly a solid beer, but not one I will continue to seek out. I have had it four or five times now, including on tap, and it just doesn't do it for me."
"Cheers."
"22oz bomber with lots of words on it. Hazy yellowish orange with some head and great lacing the entire duration of the beer. Smells of citrus hops and pine. Taste is damn good. Lots of hops taste with pine and citrus as well. A solid bitter beer and a great beer. Has that classic """Stone""" taste to it, just with more hops. Enjoy this hoppy concoction, but don't waste any of your good beers for afterwards."
"Golden copper pour with a dense white head. Wet grape-fruity hops coming out int the aroma balanced by honey sweet malts, and some leafy/grassiness. Grassy wet grapefruit hop flavor with a sticky sweet malt body and bitter pine finish. Medium-full body with a nice gentle carbonation."
"D: With the the great taste and smell, light mouthfeel and reasonable ABV, I don't see how a DIPA could get any more drinkable than this one!"
"Prost!!"
"D- I finished a six pack within several hours with no hesitations, but I am a HOPHEAD and at less than 8% this is definately drinkable for those who love hops."
"D: For me, I can drink multiple in a sitting despite the higher ABV. One of my favorites."
"Definitely drinkable. Another good brew from Stone."
"The beer is medium bodied but still it's an easy drinking beer. Always has been a favorite of mine. I wish I'd opened this growler a bit sooner (waited a good month....) but still, it's perfect. I love Stone, and I love Ruination."
"22 oz. bottle into Stone I.R.S. tulip. Pours golden-orange with two fingers of fluffy head. The aroma is a very pleasant blend of orange, apricot, lemon, a bit of pine and piles of hops. The taste is dominated by the citrus flavors with a bitter hoppy finish. The 100+ IBUs stay at bay for much of the experience, and the mouthfeel is oily and memorable. It doesn't get much better than this."
"D - Extremely bold with tons of flavor, but manages to pull it off by countering the extreme bitterness with tons of flavor, aroma, and alcohol."
"D - Definatley one of my favorites, very easy to drink a couple of these a day if I could. Highly recomend for any hophead, Stone hits a home run with this one."
"drinkability- this is a sipping beer for sure."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, can i have another?"
"great beverage, had it along side a sculpin and a PTE, and place this ahead of the sculpin."
"One pint was perfect. I would finish a bomber, but that much of this beer might be a little much. But refreshing for the style. Another awesome beer by Stone. They have never let me down."
"This will take some getting used to for this beer advocate. There's a sort of hybrid confusion going on, a battle between a smooth, thick mouthfeel and a malty sensation on the one hand, and a bitter IPA hoppy citrusy punch on the other. Leaves you wondering. A postmodern beer?"
"All in all, a great brew -- a pure, uncut, blissful rush for the dedicated hop head. Consider it welcome in my fridge anytime."
"D. Not very drinkable. I can enjoy one than I am through."
"Big ol'fluffy head on top of a red-orange sunburst color brew. Lacing and retention is excellent. Smell is a beautiful assault on the nostrils. Floral and perfumy aroma hops are abundant. First sip reveals an intense floral and earthy hop flavour. Warm alcohol and a very dry and bitter finish follow. There is alot to take in. Pretty drinkable considering the crowded palate and the level of bitterness. Although I prefer Stone's IPA, this is certainly a worthy brew."
"I've had this beer several times now and can't believe that I never reviewed it. I find that I am repeatedly blown away by the quality of the beers from Stone. This is no exception, Ruination is an excellent example of what an American DIPA should be. When I satiate for a dry kick and tons of citrus, this is the beer that I pick up. I highly recommend this to any IPA or DIPA lover out there."
"Overall: A perfect example of an SD DIPA. A must try. Cheers!"
"D: Very well rounded. Loads of hop flavor but not as bitter as one would think. What a DIPA should taste like."
"Very attractive gold color. Hoppy but not excessively so, still flavorful. Extremely drinkable beer for the type. Very smooth. Could have easily had a couple more. Not really what I expected, but still certainly one of the better IPAs I've had. Will not be my last Ruination IPA."
"D: Drinkability is above average but nothing too special in Stone's Ruination. More often than not, I pass on this one. There are simply too many great DIPAs available to make this a real contender."
"My only qualm with this beer is the drinkability. While I love the bitterness of hops, this one is so over the top that I found my 22 oz. bomber to be broken down into three segments. The first 10 to 12 ounces were as wonderful and exciting as any beer I've ever had. The next few ounces began to wear my palate down, and by the end of the bottle I had to choke down the dregs. That being said it's one of the most intense beer experiences you can find anywhere!"
"Maybe the first beer that got me into craft. Have tried it many times since I have started with my beer hobby; still holds up just as good as any other brew. A legend in my mind."
"This beer lives up to its title, as it """ruins your palate""" upon the first sip. That, to a serious hop-head, is a compliment."
"D - This beer is balanced, full of flavor and hops and is oh so good! Even though it is up there is ABV it's not too high so you can enjoy a few without a problem!"
"Atmosphere is very nice. Great regal appearance, and a full floral nose. Flavor is not complex, but pure in its intent. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Pours mostly clear with a nice frothy head and just a little bit of lacing. Aroma is just straight hops. Flavor is the same but MUCH more intense. IF ever there was a """hop bomb""" this is it. This stuff blows your palate up within the first few sips. Well carbonated, but hard to drink much of due to the insane bitterness. Tasty, but not something I'd seek out all that often."
"D: Very solid DIPA. I prefer the bitter ones, so this was a very fine drink. Not a real high ABV, so I could easily drink a few of these at once."
"I really like this beer. it moves to the top of the list in my personal favorite class of beers. it takes my edgy taste to the extreme without being imbalanced. I could drink this beer every day!"
"D: A very drinkable, strong IPA; the hops are well balanced but the bitterness is still pleasantly prevalent; the alcohol is well masked too making this a damn good DIPA from Stone"
"I could drink this beer all night, but I would problably end up on the floor if I did. The only drawback, $6.99 for a bottle! Worth it though if you are looking to splurge."
"Pours a clear copper color with a big fluffy white head that has excellent retention. Citrus hop aroma, with hints of pine. Extremely bitter taste with citrus and pine flavors, and a little caramel malt as well. Leaves a very bitter, dry aftertaste. Medium bodied with a fairly strong carbonation. I really enjoyed this, though with the extreme bitterness I wouldn't drink more than one at once.. this is a palate ruiner. A fantastic beer; if you're a hophead, this one's for you!"
"This beer is an all out hop assault, with little/no attempt to check the hops with a big malt character and it is exceptional. Clean, crisp and surprisingly drinkable if you enjoy a little hop-abuse."
"I greatly enjoyed this beer, much like the rest of Stone's lineup. Refreshing and full of depth."
"Cheers!"
"Stone's Pale Ale is one of my """go to""" beers and as I generally prefer IPAs, I expected greatness in this particular offering. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Maybe it was the strong citrus component of the taste that put me off. I managed to finish-off the six pack but only by drinking one bottle per session and with a meal at that."
"Overall, this IPA is a great example from Stone, but it greatly surpasses the standard Stone IPA with regard to balance. Regardless of what the label says, it is not that hoppy, so don't be afraid. If you see this beer and are in an IPA mood, I highly recommend it."
"This is my second Stone Ruination IPA tasting; thanks to Meng, who gave me this bottle after a social tasting session in which someone rejected it flat due to an expectation of what's to come. I am tasting this in a horizontal comparison with 4 other DIPAs and I have to admit that the Ruination way trumps both the DFH 90 and Southern Tier 2XIPA in terms of flavours and nose but the extreme level of bitterness has inevitably took 0.5 off both taste and drinkability. If I am in the mood to go extreme and wreck my palates, I will definitely choose this but more often, I may prefer to go easy. Nonetheless, I will still give credit for the amazing nose and flavors of this great beer."
"Drinkability: I will return to this beer on occasion. It is certainly worth drinking."
"D - Well if I was in the Monroeville area I would have no problem getting another bomber. They were selling the same bombers at D's for 11 dollars which was ridiculous. For the price defiantly worth the brew."
"D: I say without hesitation that this is one of the best beers I have ever had. If Stone distributed to Missouri I would drink this all the time. Since there is absolutely no balance, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't hop-crazy, but for me this beer is mana from heaven. its fairly low ABV make this one of the more sessionable IIPAs around too. It will destroy your palate though, so I wouldn't try to drink anything after it!"
"D: This beer is extremely sessionable in my opinion, which might end in a baaad night if you don't control yourself. Has a 'yellow Pez' character (what I characterized Citron vodkas as in college) to it that is absolutely irresistible. Instantly one of my favorite DIPAs, it's just a shame about the six-pack price."
"Great orange pour with a thick, creamy, white head. Hops on the nose. Citrus, grapefruit, orange, pine and floral hop aroma. The taste follows. BIG hop flavor. Citrus, orange and lemon zest, grapefruit, pine and floral hops out front. A small amount of dark fruit and caramel malt give the beer a hidden sweetness, but the hops overpower this before long. Alcohol has a small presence, especially as you get further into the better. This one finishes very bitter as advertised as the pine hops scold the tongue and leave a big dry flavor. Huge tasting double IPA. All about showing off the hops."
"D: A very nice DIPA from Stone. Certainly hop-dominated, but this demonstrates substantial finesse in a style that, to some, doesn't seem to warrant any. A textbook example of a bitter, aggressively hopped double IPA."
"With a 7.7% abv. I was amazed that I couldn't taste the alcohol, but I really couldn't detect it at all. Very easy to drink and I would drink it more often if it wasn't for the $18 a six pack price."
"Highly recommended"
"Went and paid my arm and my leg for this brew, meanwhile the local denizens were looking for Victoria, why? This beer is a very pale golden color in my Sam Adams (read that right, love the glass) glassware, and very pale at the bottom of the glass, crystal clear, filtered beer. I wonder, why filter? The Bell's I drank last night was unfiltered, and that definitely adds something, a complexity...anyway, smells great!!! The smell of those citrusy hops knocks you back, I swear I wish they could just bottle those huge Cascade whiffs you get upon first crack of the bottle....mouthfeel was lighter than expected for this style of beer, CA IPA. Let me sum it up by saying Stone is a great brewery in the California high hop style, but out here in Chicagoland, i won't pay premium over SN again, I feel like Torpedo is about on the same level, and Sierra Nevada is the real deal, original homey-feel."
"Drinks very well, beer me."
"D - yes please."
"Pours a light orange with a big, frothy head that leaves big lacing. Smell is piney hops. Taste is just right for a DIPA, subtle honey malt note that is quickly overwhelmed by a piney bitter dose of hops that explodes in the mouth. The alcohol is evident and warming, well-integrated. This falls into the """dangerous""" category, a very drinkable, tasty, and deceptively light brew that packs a real punch. Beware!"
"Wonderful double IPA, if you're a fan of hops this is a MUST try. Highly recommended."
"D: I'm good with one of these, but I wouldn't have a problem drinking a few either. This might be the strongest beer I've had for straight up hop bitterness. Welll done Stone."
"This one tastes slightly salty, bready and a good hoppiness but not as overpowering as my first sample"
"D - Good drinkability, but the high ABV and palate shock after having this beer is staggering. Definitely make this the last thing to drink."
"Most excellent brew!"
"D - Obviously a hop lover's dream. Ruination IPA lives up to its reputation as a """take no prisoners, make no apologies""" hopalicious brew of the first degree. If you're a """hoppie freak""" ... this one is maybe too drinkable ... hahaha, be careful of the 7.7% abv."
"A little light on the nose, but what I get is nice, bitter hops. It pours a beautiful light orange and is perfectly clear. The head sticks around a while and is white with big bubbles. Taste is unimaginably delicious! This is a bitter beer, which Stone has won me over with. I buy these to celebrate just being me."
"D: Beware: The last pour of this bomber was the absolute smoothest...Cheers..."
"D - The fellas over at Stone know what they are doing, and certainly know their way around a hop. I would recommend this to any friend and lover of great beer."
"The mouthfeel is good, but seems a bit light bodied when compared to the more active carbonation. This is a very drinkable DIPA, although I probably say that more often that not about DIPA's. . .though I do wish it had a bit more body to it."
"D: For a beer with this much bitterness, it's rather well balanced and drinkable."
"Good price and a great beer, now that its available in chicago i will probally get it often."
"D - Amazing DIPA, 22oz goes down easy. To me, this beer is the prototypical example of a west coast IPA, and one I am always comparing others to. Great work, Stone!"
"D- Just great. The reason I bought this was the fast the the bottle said """100+ IBU's""" and it delivers. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"Finally got around to trying this infamous brew; just started being distributed to CT recently and man, it does not disappoint. Not much else to say that anyone else hasn't covered. It's an absolute hop bomb, full of floral aromas and flavors, nice fruity hoppiness to it, amazing mouth feel. Finishes so smooth and clean, hard to find anything wrong with this beer... for the ABV it is super drinkable, I could easily down a few of these no problems. Just a super tasty, well balanced beer, with tons of hops.. love it."
"D: Very very high, drinks just as easy as juice."
"Even at 7.7% ABV this one is getting to me. I love it, but the bitterness is lovely because it is palate wrecking, and therefore not very drinkable."
"I've now had this on cask, tap, and bottle. The bottle version had the best appearance with thick white sudsy head and spotty lacing down the glass. Potent aroma of orange, grapefruit, and pine resin, with slight hints of the toasted malts in the background of this hop bomb. Taste follows smell with strong hops front to back. Solid medium body, ample carbonation, sticky finish with hop oils coating the mouth. When I want a hop bomb with a toasted malt content, I'm grabbing this one without a doubt."
"I'm wondering if i got an old bottle or something because this is in no way a 'good beer'...."
"Obviously the hops rule this beer, but it has other factors (unbalanced/yet different/engaging/yet annoyingly nasty) which help to make it worth finding, glad I did."
"For me, this beer IS DIPA."
"Notes-This *was* my favorite DIPA, until I had my first Pliny The Elder; now it's been firmly relegated to a rather distant second, it's still an awesome DIPA though."
"D:the hops punch lasts just long enough, and the assertive hoppy flavor keeps me drinking. Well balanced malt for it's bitterness makes all the difference"
"The beer pours a hazy copped with a fluffy head and beautiful lacing. I tend not to trust a clear IIPA. The aroma is grassy, herbal and overwhelmingly citrusy hops. The pungent grapefruit alludes to the bitterness to come. A bit of sweet caramel malt pokes through upfront in the flavor, followed by more big, bold grapefruity bitterness. The intense resiny bitterness lingers for what seems like an eternity, I feel like I was just chewing on some fresh cones! The alcohol is masked, but the extreme bitterness lets you know you are drinking a fairly strong beer. This is one nasty IIPA! I can feel a little heartburn coming with each sip."
"Those who complain about Ruination's lack of maltiness are not familiar with the style, nor with the philosophy of Stone Brewing Company. Stone hit a home run with this liquid gold, and those lucky enough to find it (and fortunate enough to be able to afford it) will surely have a memorable experience."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Big hop flavor. Solid beer."
"overall: I never got this much peach from any beer its bitter peach that is very refreshing. I always like this beer but this bottle was off the hook!"
"Cheers to Stone."
"D: other than the 7.7%abv its very easy to drink"
"Cheers!!"
"Who knew a bazillion IBU Double IPA could be so drinkable? Maybe I am worthy, after all. Another absolute classic from Stone."
"A terrific offering from Stone. I have had plenty of the regular Stone IPAs, and wasn't sure how different this one was going to be, but it did deliver. Color is a tad deeper golden than the regular IPA. Hops aroma is a bit more complex, although not overwhelmingly so. Taste seems to me like a richer, hoppier Stone IPA, with more emphasis on the citrus flavors, rather than the uni-demensional hop profile of regular IPA. So smooth and easy drinking for a 7.7% beer. Would highly recommend checking this one out, and would advise drinking a 12 oz serving of this before sessioning other beers to appreciate the excellent blending of flavors Stone did here."
"Stone Brewing Company, for all its humorous boasting, never really fails to deliver great beer, and they certainly didn't botch this one. Wassail, my friends. Wassail."
"Fantastic IPA. Classic style with a good malty compliment to the robust hop flavor. Not """pine cone""" hop at all, very drinkable. Pleasant mouthfeel without feeling heavy. Hop up front with a bitter and malty aftertaste. Served on draft - tasted fresh but not a lot of head so aroma seemed a little subdued."
"D: Under 8%? That surprises the hell out of me. It feels like it should be twice that. I'm not worthy anymore, methinks."
"D: Pretty good."
"Ahhhh, so glad to finally get my hands on a fresh bottle of Ruination and it was worth the wait. After being hit with some boozy DIPAs recently, I really enjoyed the lower alcohol content in this one, the hops really get to steal the show here. Excellent."
"Served from tap into standard pint. Pours a nice golden color with a one finger white head that lingers. The aroma was quite hoppy. The flavor of this beer was bitter enough that it became spicy while in your mouth, but massive hop flavor is lurking and hits you upon swallowing. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. There was minimal lacing throughout the brew, but some was evident. Overall this is an awesome IPA from Stone (my personal favorite IPA actually). If you are a big hop flavor lover and haven't tried this, you definitely owe it to yourself to track this one down."
"D: This is my first Stone brew since it has hit IL. This is a good DIPA/IIPA! Not sure if I would buy it again because I'am interested in checking out the other Stone brews. Overall good beer!"
"I like this taste much better than the original Stone IPA. Its not as bitter throughout just where it should be and in the right amount. The end hoppiness is also a combination with floweres which is very interesting. The mouthfeel is great and lasts several seconds and its an easy drink."
"Dont get me wrong, was a very good brew but seemed to me it should have fallen into the single IPA category. Hope to re-review this after a while with perhaps some fresher material."
"Drinkability: a very good DIPA. I will definitely get again."
"Pours a hazy light yellowish amber color with a one finger head that retains and leaves a nice trail of white lacing. The nose is hops hops and more hops. very very citrusy as well with a notable malt sweetness. After a good swirl I can slightly smell the alcohol. The taste is very similar. Lots of piny hops and very citrusy with a good malt backbone that causes this beer to be even more enjoyable. Very heavy, velvety and thick mouthfeel. Nice and drinkable as well. This is one of the finest IPAs I have ever had."
"SkÅL!"
"I was actually planning on splitting this and I'm glad I didn't. The alcohol is masked very well. Be careful this could get dangerous it tastes so good!"
"Drinkability: Able to finish a bomber but that's about it. Satisfying and a good representation of the style."
"This is a well balanced double IPA. I was expecting a little more of a hop assault, but all in all an excellent beer. The aroma is the star of this beer. I would love to have this extremely fresh and on tap. I think it would be incredible."
"Was very tasty with sushi."
"d- the bitterness ca get a bit overwhelming and the very end of a glass but this stuff has enough going on under the bitterness to keep you sipping."
"Overall, the consummate beer for the hop head! Many speak of Double IPAs stating that they """have a good malty balance""". To be honest, I could do without that balance. I need a beer that will """show me the hoppy""". Look no further than the Ruination"
"D: Pri-tay goood. I will have another in the future, but I do think the price tag is a quite steep at $3 plus per bottle. That is a little silly."
"D- this is a great west coast hops assault. I like it and will always enjoy in MODERATION. Great west coast participation"
"Stone ruination really shows you how a real IPA should taste! The hop aroma is unbelievablely strong.The mouthfeel is great and i love the pi ne. The aftertaste is what sets this IPA apart from others. By far the best IPA around in my opinion. A close second being Dogfishhead 90 minute."
"Note* As an artist, the package and bottle are really cool, I love the near tacky green and gold screen print, it's really awesome. I love painted/inked bottles."
"D/O- At 7.7%, a bit overpowering for me. Probably would stop at one, mayyybe two."
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, and has a below average amount of carbonation. This is a medium bodied, but leaves a good deal of lining in the mouth with each sip. It's a little difficult to drink because of the huge amounts of hops, but it is a great brew. Something I really enjoyed and will definintely have again."
"D - This beer is pretty damn drinkable. At least it was, until I noticed the Weyerbacher Double Simcoe on-tap."
"If you like bitter, you will like this. I like bitter, but there is not much else that is balancing it out for me. As the beer went on the bitterness factor dropped, and I was actually really enjoying it by the end, but that 1st few sips....bitter as all hell"
"D - A good DIPA. I would have guessed that this exceeded 7.7% ABV. I would buy this again, but there are other DIPAs that I prefer."
"D - I actually rate this pretty high. It is tasty. I don't mean to bash this at all, but i do think it is overpriced and a tad overrated. i live in ct so maybe its the shipping charges that make this so expensive. and a sign over it to say that it is """perhaps the best ipa in america""" doesn't help and automatically sets the bar way too high before tasting it."
"Edit: to clarify, this does wreck the palate. I followed up with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and couldn't discern any of the notes. Well done, Stone. Well done."
"Overall, I am a little disappointed. I guess I had in mind something better than Hopslam. Still pretty good though."
"This is perfect for a warm day's refreshment but for Hopheads only!"
"Drinkability: The hoppiness of this beer means that it's definitely a sipper. However, it's very good. Overwhelming amounts of hops aren't exactly my thing, so while I wouldn't drink this much, I like it a lot."
"Drinkability: A great beer! This is one I'll definitely look for again. While you might not necessarily want to drink too many of these at a time, this is one of the best beers I've had in a long time."
"Overall, this is a great stone offering and great DIPA. This is definitely the most bitter beer I've ever had, but i quite thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Overall this is a great bitter DIPA and one of my go to beers when I am in the mood for something really bitter. Recommended."
"Overall: An excellent IPA. This isn't the beer to start your IPA journey. This is one to seek out if you're a true hop head. You won't be disappointed."
"d- really high, this is one really tasty dipa that i will definately be drinking again. i thing the number of reviews says everything about this, my review is number 2,001!! top top notch dipa, great work again stone!"
"Overall, this beer doesn't do it for me nearly as much as I had hoped. I had high hopes considering Stone just came into Chicago, and after reading the reviews and trying Arrogant Bastard, I was ready to be wowed. It's not bad, it's just not great. I did get """used""" to it the more I drank, which made it slightly more enjoyable. Not something I'd buy again."
"Drinkability: Now, this is not a beer i would recommend to someone who is new to ipa's. I think only those who enjoy a good hop kick now and then would like it. I think it great, but as the name and description warns, it will ruin your palate for a little while, like a hop punch to the mouth."
"I'd score the beer higher for drinkability but I don't think I could drink more than one bottle in a sitting, and as the beer warmed up the bitterness slowly grew overpowering."
"Outstanding, epic beer. Balanced, balanced, balanced. Obviously a hop bomb, but the crafting of the grain bill and malt character of this beer shows the love and care that the brewers put into it. If this was available in Missouri, this would find a nice home in our fridge. Going to be the traditional American style IIPA that I compare all others of the same style to..."
"D - Well for 7.7%."
"Got another bottle courtesy of the wife, and it's just like it's supposed to be. Boozy, resinous, massive grapefruit and pungent citrus peel hoppy glory. This is the Ruination that I remember: great stuff."
"I can appreciate this beer for what it claims to be, an utter assault on your palette, but i just don't see what the long term appeal to this beer is. I guess I just prefer my DIPA's with less bitterness and a better hop taste."
"D- I couldn't see myself drinking more than one or two in an evening. Its just so hoppy. I'm not saying its too strong or anything like that...but god, the flavor is overwhelming. Its like an attack on your taste buds"
"This wont be my staple beer as its a bit intense, but this is completely an indulgence beer to anticipate and enjoy from time to time. I cant keep it in the house though because I might find myself sleep walking to get it every night."
"Hop-heads: Run, don't walk to get this brew if you have never tried it. Get Some!!"
"Way too drinkable given the ABV.... one of my favorites"
"Drinkability: Numbing your mouth is a double edged sword. Nothing else tastes the same, so you may as well have another Ruination."
"For a huge beer Ruination is very drinkable, I could easily sit here and down it in gulps when it should probably be sipped. Very nicely done!"
"Edit - I liked Ruination more than PtE, lolz."
"D - Not a real hard one to drink but I'm not the biggest fan of piney DIPA's. I think this one might not taste as good thanks to the growler of Coast's Boy King DIPA that graced my tongue recently."
"Wow! Hoppy, Hoppy, Hoppy. Excellent."
"Clean and crisp. Beautiful hop and malt balance not disasterously bitter. Beauty in simplicity."
"rerate on 7/6/09. On cask with amarillo hops at Daily Pint, Santa Monica. Absolutely amazing grapefruit, lemon, and orange aroma. Also has a touch of sweet toffee and vanilla. This was a beautiful hazy golden pour, with typical cask frothy head. Very well balanced flavor, then a wonderful dry bitter finish. This is an amazing brew, and the cask only adds to it."
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable."
"Drinkability is great despite the 7.7%, everything comes together pretty nicely with this one."
"After one 22oz bottle you will feel happy!"
"pours a hazed amber with a perfect one finger off white head. smells strong and floral. very leafy hops, citrus, stinging alpha acids with a strong tropical fruit backbone. the taste is brash and unforgiving. bitter pine hops explode on the tongue with whispers of faint malt and a spicy/peppery finish. one of the most bitter beers i've tried, and i love it. bold and brilliant. medium body. i could drink a few of these, but it's not a beer that the rest of the room will likely enjoy. stone raising the bar again. help me rhonda..."
"Despite all the hops, or perhaps because of it, this is a smooth very enjoyable beer to drink. It is a fine foil to their otherwise very balanced IPA."
"OVERALL: Ruinous, just like it said. There are a lot of beers out there that claim this or that, but this one lives up to its name and then some. Easily the most bitter beer I've ever had, completely frying my palate, and I couldn't wait for more. Stone said they would ruin me, and they did, and for that, I give my thanks. They should also say that if you'd like your palate returned to you, expect about 6-8 weeks delivery time. Recommended."
"This is 100% a non-session beer. Don't let the ABV fool you, this is an intense beer with a huge hop profile. Pours a hazy golden brownish yellow with a light white head. The nose is punched full of citrus hops and pine. Beautiful! This beer disperses in your mouth and leaves a film of alpha acid and fresh cut pine. If you were planning on drinking any other beers for the night. Forget about it! This beers hop profile dominates most in not all others so be sure to drink last. Big nose, Huge body, and a ridiculous amount of hops. Great brew."
"I could drink several of these with no objection, but it is a little malt heavy for my taste."
"Overall, this IPA is a great example from Stone, but it greatly surpasses the standard Stone IPA with regard to balance. Regardless of what the label says, it is not that hoppy, so don't be afraid. If you see this beer and are in an IPA mood, I highly recommend it."
"Good drinkability, considering the ABV. I definitely feel the effects after one bottle, but the unique and exceptional taste of this one makes it very appealing."
"Poured a golden color into glass with a one inch head. Bubbles foaming the top. The smell of hops and fruits is noticable. Taste is definitely hoppy with carbonation. Mouthfeel is a nice bitterness that lingers on the palate. Drinkability is very good for an DIPA. Overall, a very good DIPA from Stone. Could drink a couple more if I had some in the fridge."
"d - A pretty good DIPA. Nice hoppy smell and taste, will definitely be trying again."
"Drinkable beer, but I wouldn't have more than one a night."
"The carbonation is basically what you'd expect from this sort of brew - it's carbonated enough to make it easy to drink but not so much that it's overly fizzy. Quite thick, with not as much booze as you'd expect from a ~8% brew - there's simply no room for it in the avalanche of hops. Very drinkable for a beer of it's style - not enough balance to truly be an easy drinker, but very enjoyable nevertheless. An excellent brew from Stone, as would be expected."
"One bomber is enough for me. I really like my IPA's/DIPA's but I prefer them with more balance...a more substantial, sweeter malt base is what I am looking for, not my style for a DIPA..."
"D: the one bomber is a tough one to drink it goes down like 12 percent, but is enjoyable this one of the first true sipper ipas I have found, normally i just tend to gulp them down, reminds me of eating a Columbus hop pellet."
"D= A fitting name for a brew which will truely spoil your palate. Even most IPA's don't stand a chance as an on deck choice. Delicious and highly drinkable."
"All in all, this is a very well-put-together beer that I can't put down. I'm pretty much done with it and I've been trying to savor it for the sake of reviewing and enjoying it. Don't get me wrong, I've thoroughly enjoyed it, I just wish I had a lot more of it. Impressive in all facets, if you haven't tried this beer yet, then put it on your To Do list."
"D- I could drink it all night. I'm loving it right now with my brbq."
"D: Fantastic IPA; definitely lived up to the numerous recommendations from fellow BA's. I think the ABV of 7.7% for this DIPA helps keep everything in check and makes for a very drinkable version of the style. The hop bitterness is crazy powerful (which is fine by me!), so it kind of prevented me from actually tasting whatever beer I had afterwards!"
"(d) As far as drinkability goes, when compared to other IPA's this beer is very drinkable, but only when I'm just setting my sights on drinking. Definetly not something to be paired with food...unless you want everything to taste like this beer...which I guess is pefectly ok! Other beer companys make a few great brews...but Stone has yet to throw anything my way that I didnt like. Spend the $ and try this beer! (4/5)"
"Poured a 22oz bomber bottle into to a snifter glass. Pours a nice bright orange color with a nice lacey head. The smell is but a glimpse of the bold and bitter hops that exist in the taste. One of the hoppiest beers out there and it does not disappoint. It has an excellent crisp finish and goes great with spicy foods. A can't miss IPA."
"I will preface this by saying(though I'm new to BA) that I am something of an IPA fanatic and I have tried about 100 different types in the past year. That being said, I found this to be an excellent IPA. The nose was classic hop-ey, citrus, pine. The taste was very crisp and bitter, and the finish was dry. I would almost consider this a regular IPA instead of a double because it is so dry. For me this is a very smooth drinking IPA. My only real complaint is the price. Overall this is a top notch IPA in my book."
"verry verry hoppy and bitter. Citrusy hints, grapefruit and pines are all there. Enjoyable IPA, but be ready for this one, no ordinary Imperial IPA. Thats the only place where I knock this beer, and its hard to do, but drinkability was not excellent, just good. Overall a beer in its own category, enjoyed it."
"D: Liked it way better this time around, but off the top of my head I can still think of a half dozen DIPAs that I like better. Maybe it's the iconoclast buried inside me. In any event, its a DIPA standard reference, and for at least that reason I know I'll be coming back to it again and again."
"Overall, the nose is sweeter than I prefer (similar to a U.S. Amber Ale), but this is a solid drinker with some nice fruity-resiny notes and a beautifully bitter finish. Stone delivers once again."
"Mouthfeel was appropriately slightly thicker than a regular IPA but not cloying as a barleywine. Nice carbonation. Easy to drink beer, though I'm not sure I'd want a second one on the same night & I'm not sure I'd be able to taste anything less assertive afterwards, but it sure went down easily."
"D: A really nice IPA, and a good representation of the style."
"D:I could see drinking 3 12oz bottles of this, then moving to something more light. Overall this is a fabulous beer. However for the outrageous price of a 22oz around here, I'll stick with a 6 pack of 60 minute ipa."
"D - although i love just about every aspect of this beer, i couldnt see my self drinking it all night or sessioning more than a couple. it is intense!"
"D - Fantastic beer, could drink this a lot, the bitterness of the IPA actually leaves your mouth quenched, and no sweetness to become overbearing with time."
"D: good, intense version of the style. I could drink a couple of these with ease."
"Thanks so much Brad, much appreciated! Dark, orange pour, with a large creamy custard head, leaving scads of lacing. Hop-a-saurus aroma, witha syrupy pine and honey side, with some malt to balance out the aromatics. Piney hops fill the mouth, and the receptacle appreciates, bitter as all get out. Bready and sweet bread. Great! My palate hath been ruined due to the massive hopping! Long bitter finish. Greg , you brew good beer! Thanks!"
"excellent beer for those that like bitterness, IPA, etc..."
"Drinkability: One of the pioneers, and one that still delivers. Couldn't believe I didn't have a review for this. Not only does it hold up, but it's still a staple. Always something to get in a bomber if available. At least for me."
"Drinkability: I'd love many of these! But 1 22 oz. bottle is plenty, especially with 7.7% ABV. The alcohol is not noticeable in taste. But the brew is delicious and pleasurable. I don't know that my palate is """ruined," more like """delighted.""" Yes!"
"It has to be sipped, but the dry finish has a mouthwatering effect that begged rudely for another sip. I can't say it ruined my pallet but it handed out a few good shots to the jaw. Awesome beer."
"Full-bodied, but not unbearable. To the contrary, this is a very drinkable big-beer."
"d - just like it says on the bottle, this beer will ruin your palate. my palate does not deserve anything but mc. donalds at this point. umm i want a double cheeseburger."
"Taste is also awesome, and follows in the same manner as the aroma. I love the earthy notes in here, they are a bit stronger than the citrus from the hops but the citrus is absolutely present. A bit a an oily character from the hops, not unpleasant at all. Love this beer, wish I could get it for a bit cheaper than the $17 a six pack I bought it for today. I guess that's what two hearted is for."
"Stone IPA poured a very rich golden color, with a perfect head. It had a very strong hoppy smell to it. The taste was very strong, very very hopy. It had a very good taste, but it due to the extreme hopiness it leaves a very strong aftertaste, that may be a little harsh."
"drinkability is good but i dont think i could drink more then a bomber in one sitting"
"Quite a full body feel in the mouth and certainly warming from all the alcohol. Leaves you just wanting more and more however with all the """ruinous effects""" on your palate, maybe one is enough."
"Perfect level of carbonation for an IPA. Creamy mouthfeel. The hops abound, but work well for me. It's has a bit of a pucker-inducing finish, but the aftertaste is enjoyable even though bitter."
"Overall, this is a very nice DIPA that goes overboard on the hops, in a good way. If you are a hop head like me, you need to try this beer. The hops might be a bit overpowering in the scent and not as intricately linked as perhaps I would like to see, but again, this may be different with fresher bottles. All in all, though, this is a really interesting and powerful example of the style."
"Poured out of a 22 into a weizen glass. Color was a golden orange similar to hopslam with a nice soft white head and sticky, lingering lacing. Smell was a very sweet, floral - hops combo pleasing to the senses. Great, tangy orangeish taste with a nice bite to the tongue and palate. Taste stayed with me a good bit. mouthfeel was medium to light. Drinkability was good and enjoyable to the point where i would be comfortable with these all night. Then again, i am a strong hop, dipa lover, so take that into consideration. In other words, this beers got a bite to it but not an overload to the tastebuds. Highly recommended and surprisingly available."
"d - yes i can drink it. can i start a petition to eliminate this category, please?"
"I generally tell newcomers to this beer that if you are gonna have more than one type of beer you may want to save this one for last. This is an explosion of hop! A real pallet smasher. The hop really sits on your tongue for a significant period and you probably won't taste much of anything else for a while. Appearance is golden but not necessarily transparent. Smell is where this beer gets me. The floral notes of pine and citrus are great. Initial hit almost makes my eyes water. Mouthfeel is good and not too thin. Drinkability can be a slow process so take your time with this one."
"Overall I will drink this many times, especially in a fresh cask. And I can for sure finish a whole bomber by myself."
"D- For me, a beer with average drinkability. One is definitely enough to satisfy any jonesing for hops that I might be experiencing."
"An intense yet well balanced beer."
"This is a great beer to have with a big rare steak, don't bother with the veggies as you'll get enough greens from your beverage. Highly recommended with just a few peanuts as well if you're lucky enough for your local watering hole to carry this gem."
"In spite of tasting pretty great, this is too intense to drink much of. I do love IPA but there are just so much hops here that it would literally make me sick to drink three of these. I don't think I'd even want to drink more than one at a time. I would not say this is sessionable."
"D- very drinkable and refreshing, ABV probably makes it a sipper, but you will want more !"
"The beer pours our a harmless pale yellow color with about an eight an inch of head. The smell is powerful pine, and resin with a hint of citrus. The taste follows the smell very closely. Very aggressive hop presence. Lots of pine and resin up front. A hint of lemon at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and solid. Drinkabilty is a bit of an issue because of how much the hops assault your taste buds. Definitely a Stone beer based on it aggressive hop presence!"
"Poured from chilled bottle into tulip. A light copper color under a short-lived head; and a small amount that clings to the sides of the glass for most of the drink. Smell is great. Hops... obviously, strong citrus and essentially reminds me of harvesting my own Zeus and Cascades in the backyard...just take a handfull of both and stick a nose in there...same for this beer. Taste is exactly the same for me...it's got the same bite and bitterness as I've gotten from my own hops, some high AA's and good citrus to balance. Mouthfeel is ok..it's a pretty strong DIPA...not so much in the ABV department but certainly IBU's are up there. It's not something I'd call sessionable...it would certainly be tough for anything to follow this without having a big cleansing of the palate. Overall a good beer, especially if one is in the mood for massive hop flavor."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a golden color with a sticky white head. The aroma is a punch in the nose. Hops, hops, and more hops. Pine, floral, clove and some sweeter cinnamon aroma. Moderate carbonation, medium body and very tasty. Not much more to say about this brew but it is hopaliciuos!"
"I've avoided this one for a while in favor of other IPAs but I was pleasantly surprised. It will make its way into my IPA rotation."
"My opinion is that this beer is best enjoyed on a hot afternoon for that much anticipated first beer of the evening. Also great for the beach, on a deck or patio watching the sun set to match the color of this gorgeous beer, especially since it will go great with chips and salsa."
"Plenty of carbonation combined with the clean Columbus hop finish isn't hard to not want more of. At 7.7, you probably won't ask for a second glass, but the first one will be making you want another."
"I really loved this beer and would definitely recommend it. It gives you a big dose of hops without beating you over the head with it!"
"Poors a yellowish/amber small offwhite head. Smells like hops great grapefriuty piney hops mmm. Taste verry good hoppy with almost no malt in there. Mouthfeel is as abrasive as one would expect. I could drink this all day and all night if it were avalible in mn. Please oh please more more of this"
" A bit pricey but a must try for hop heads."
"A nice medium, not overpowering body. A good drinkable beer still. I expect fresher there would have been more citrus or pine hoppy flavor, but the planty bitterness is still excellent. Also the malts, while subtle, balance the hops well."
"This is a superb IPA -- rich, strong, well developed. A strong hop flavor that is synergized with mouthfeel perfectly. A banquet IPA for the most serious among us. Worth the price. I'll be back for more!"
"I loved this beer and if you're into hops you will too."
"D- fairly good, but you just can't quaff this one- would you want to? this beast is meant to be savored"
"Gotta say - I thought this was a """show-off""" beer - 100 IBUs!! But it is also a """real""" beer that, though not for the faint of heart, is also quite good. Will *definitely* get this again."
"I would never buy this. I probably will never try a fourth time. I have tried to drink this beer a few times as my palate has progressed and each time is as bad to me as it was before. This beer is just not for me."
"D: Very good drinkability."
"D: One of the most consumable beers of this style I have ever tasted. If it were a little less expensive, I could drink this beer every day."
"D- Barely noticeable abv and a nice crisp and refreshing brew."
"Very powerful in the mouthfeel. I'm no hop head, but this was much mellower than I would have expected - it wasn't mellow by any means, but didn't kick my ass."
"Pours a crystal clear deep golden bordering on copper color with good two finger tightly bubbled white head that recedes slowly lacing my entire glass. Smells of pine and resinin mostly. Caramel brown sugar and a touch of alcohol deep within the aroma. Taste is pine and herbal and bitter. Barely enough caramel malt to soften the bitter blow from the hops. Finishes with a long lingering hop blast and a bit of warming alcohol. Sticky resinous mouthfeel, medium body and level of carbonation. I've had this many times and just got around to reviewing it now. This is a great go to beer when I need a blast of hops."
"D- This is closer to a single IPA given the 7.7% ABV, but the flavor and aroma are packed with hops. A great IPA from Stone Brewing Co."
"D- Like it says on the bottle, this will pretty much ruin your palate after one of these and I think that is pretty much spot on. A good beer to sip on but don't expect to have much else after words."
"Reviewed form my notes. This beer is nearly translucent with a dark straw color. It has a thick white foam head. The aroma is full of great earth hops. It smells like there may be some yeast aromas present, but it's just as likely I'm just smelling the complex hops and confusing the two. A bit of sweetness appears initially when you taste. This is followed by hearty, grassy hops. The beer finishes with a very bitter hop flavor. Is there a better tasting DIPA out there? Possibly, but I haven't had it. The body feels a bit heavier than what I call medium. There is a lot of tickling carbonation and decent mouthcoating. This is a very hoppy, strong beer. It's hard to drink a lot of these in a row, but individually it goes down very well. Plus, DIPA's aren't meant for chugging, but savoring."
"This was an enjoyable beer. The alcohol wasn't too strong, but it carried a good buzz factor. I loved the story on the bottle, it really sums up why we love hops. Thanks for the date code, I wouldn't buy this beer without it. +.5 on drinkability score for that info."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Enjoy by 11/09/09 barely visible at the base of the bottle (guess it's past its prime). Poured a slightly hazy orange-gold with a frothy, bright white half inch head. Head eventually settles into a fairly consistent skim of a cap, with delicate strands of lacing around the perimeter of the glass. Nicely balanced nose - some sweet citrus and some aromatic bittering hops. Taste consistent with nose - hops character seems a bit diminished; however, its still pretty tasty. Finish is slightly medicinal and lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation level and some acidity that stimulates the cheeks. Pretty solid IPA - I'll have to re-evaluate on a fresh bottle; however, the fact that this has stood up so well past its expiration date is a testament to the quality of the brew."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable IPA with excellent hop and malt flavors. One of the best out there."
"Notes: An excellent double IPA."
"D: One hell of a DIPA. It's not quite Pliney, but it's pretty damn close. I think Ruination on draft might be better than Pliney in the bottle by just a hair. Overall another great beer from Stone, perhaps my favorite one. A brew worthy of my 100th review."
"The Ruination pours an opaque copper color with lots of carbonation and haziness to the pour. Nice frothy head with plenty of lacing. Smells of citrus, pine, and hops. Aroma's are not overpowering in any way but very pleasant. Taste is surprisingly smooth and crisp. I was expecting the bitterness to be overpowering the other flavors, but this isn't the case at all. The taste is mostly sweet citrus fruits. Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied. Although this beer will not """ruin""" my palate like the label depicts, regardless it is a tasty beer. One of the more sessionable IPA's in my opinion with the taste being great and the middle of the road ABV not noticeable in the quaff. Overall, great beer from Stone."
"D: Great. It's a pleasure to drink. Almost 8% ABV, not crazy high, but does not taste boozy."
"Drinkability - This brew is strong be careful you will quite literally Ruin yourself."
"D - I was expecting this to be much lower. Maybe I've spent too much time in California... This is good and I want more."
"Bottle. Clear gold pour with some white head. Lots of very hoppy aromas, the usual pine and grapefruit all-american nose. Taste is very much the same pine-sol and alcohol. Very complex but also hard to drink. A nice interlude in an otherwise all belgian night."
"A strong score for a strong beer. Stone never ceases to amaze me."
"One of the better IIPAs I've had and as always from Stone, a winner."
"Light/thin mouthfeel that is all encompassing and very well carbonated. While undoubtedly an assertive beer, hop heads will keep asking for more!"
"Very drinkable and a great example of the style."
"This has a very dry impact on the palate, the hop combination is powerful like a punch to the nose. The dryness is a bit much for me, I would have liked to taste a more balanced malt impact in the brew; the bread my nose was picking up either pulled a disappearing act or was overpowered by the aggressive hops. Not my favorite DIPA, but by no means a poor beer. I much prefer some 90 minute from Dogfish Head."
"Thank you, Stone, for a high quality beer."
"D- I must say I was afraid of this one but it is a pleasure to drink. Yes its bitter but in a good way. Its almost sweet up front but the finish (its a long one) is where the bitter comes in. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Overall, this is the best DIPA I have had [take that for what you will, as I have had fewer that DIPA's im sure]"
"If you like hops this could be the be-all-and end-all beer for you. It bitterness is great but this definitely ain't no 6 pack a night beer. You just coudn't take it."
"What else can I say about it. It's great!"
"Overall, this is an extremely easy brew to drink, perhaps only if you know what you are getting into, as the hops are intense, even a few days before the """enjoy by""" date. This brew is recommended."
"I must say this is the first bitter non overly malty DIPA I had in a long while. I don't even know how they classify it as DIPA at only 7.7% abv. Really curious how this will taste as it warms. My guess is the sweet citric notes will have a much bigger play and not beat completlely back down by the hops."
"Drinkability -5.0/5.0 - an excellent double IPA!"
"Thanks to my girlfriend for stowing this one back to MN from her work trip in Los Angeles."
"I was able to control the 22oz well, but anymore could have been a lot harder."
"Drinking more than three of these in a row can likely only be done by the most obsessive hops lovers. So if you are in this category, this is your IPA."
"One of the best Im perials IPAs you can buy. Highly recommend."
"Is this a top DIPA? Yup. And what makes it so great is that it's easily available to a number of consumers. Another great offering from Stone."
"D-Really pretty easy drinking. The smoothness of Ruination and the lack of any astringency make this one a winner."
"Smell and taste are both dominated by hops. It is bitter yet very smooth. Floral hops cover up the abv, and the bitter aftertaste lingers well after the beer is gone. If you're into hops this is a beer for you."
"D - This is very easy going down. But that ABV and the hops add a slight heaviness that would limit me to no more than 2 at one sitting."
"Summary - drink this beer. If you don't particularly like heavily-hopped beers, drink it anyway."
"Cheers Stone, you guys continue to impress me; keep up the good work."
"Notes: This beer definitely lives up to my expectations and surpasses them. It looks just like an IPA should and drinks excellently. It tastes amazing. While it does get super bitter like the description promises, it doesn't over-do it, because it matches bitterness with equally powerful flavors."
"D= very drinkable for a sampler, maybe the whole 22 ounce bottle if you're a seasoned IPA drinker. A bit too much IBU acid for most stomachs to endure much more than that, although I suppose that if I really hit stride with it and had 2-3 bottles I could go through them in a night's session."
"The head laces the wine glass like a nobody's business."
"Overall I like this one a lot, it's one of the only highly regarded west coast IPA's we get where I live. Probably not my top rated DIPA but not too far down the list, and different then most of the rest to make it something I seek out occasionally."
"Hell of a beer. Complex in terms of the multitude of flavors and the dynamic they create with one another, but with a more simplistic view--this beer is dominated by slightly sweet, American hops that are bold and heavy, but presented in a medium body and without too much flare. A great deal of depth, presented in a straightforward, authentic way. Maybe it's the amount of alcohol. This is an Ernest Hemingway beer if I ever tasted one. And I don't even know what that means."
"D - Perhaps the ultimate hop-lovers beer, this baby is named very appropriately. Best to save this one for sipping or for cutting through some seriously spicy salsa (my favorite way to drink it)."
"Taste is fairly mellow at first, follow up by a rush of hops and citrus. Not as overly bitter as some other IPAs I've had, but also not nearly as big and strong in terms of ABV. Very drinkable and tolerable for the style."
"Stone Brewery...exactly. Whats up with the winged devils on all the bottles?"
"Medium/full mouthfeel and lightly carbonated..Not a quaffer at 7.7% but I'm not exactly sipping this either...It's too irresistible for that!"
"Drinkability: A nice and solid beer that lets you know hops are king. Very good for the style, I could have two but after that I think my palate would be hopped out."
"D-big hops and a nice mouthfeel make for quite a drinkable beer. i love ruination and i could drink it all day, huge bitterness make that a challenge, though."
"Great beer for anytime or occasion, and if you can, a great pairing with grilled lamb or other more pronouced meat."
"This is one very drinkable brew."
"D - This is easily, one of the most drinkable IPA's I have enjoyed. I could put back 3 or 4, but your palate would stop appreciating it after the 2nd one. Stick to one or two to fully enjoy and respect this brew they way it should be."
"This was thoroughly enjoyed for this newly anointed hop-head. Would not recommend for the malt-minded brethren. Slainte!"
"D: One of the most bitter beers I've ever had. I could drink it all night, and it's pretty hard to drink anything after it or taste anything after it anyway. Not very drinkable if you're not a hop addict."
"D: Not a very heavy beer so enjoying more is possible."
"D - Good, but not the best. I think this is great for a hop head looking for the """wow""" factor, but this is not a beer you'd want to get a 12 pack of ya know? I think it is more manageable from a bottle (as reviewed here) but again this is a try it once or twice kinda beer."
"The first year round double ipa in production I believe. Not pushing the boundaries anymore, but stuff like this and Pliny were the innovators that many are imitating these days around the world."
"D: Hopheads only. And even most won't put down more than one. Catch-22 is that you won't get to taste what you have next ;)"
"(D)- The only real fault that I can find with this beer is that the heavy dosage of hops can hold it back at times, limiting other flavors. While I enjoy my hoppy beers, this is one that I must be in the mood for in order to enjoy it properly."
"(D)- A good beer, however its rather one dimensional to me: a dry, immense piney hoppiness on the palate. This is certainly the pinnacle of what hopheads search for! I am definitely enjoying it, but I generally gravitate towards a more balanced/ multi dimensional IPA."
"NOTE!!: This beer could seriously do with an abv boost, somewhere around 10-12% or even double the current (7.70%). The bitterness turns pretty abrasive when sipped slowly, but with more alcohol, and the necessary sweetening to create such alcohol, would do little to the hops character but turn the overall drink into something comparable to a fine scotch, making the bitterness have a warm, smooth finish and become more tolerable. Still a great find though!"
"Cheers!"
"All in all, a very delicious and complex beer. Excellent representation of the style and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good double IPA."
"Like the label say's it will ruin the rest of your drinking night if you hit up this bad boy first. Mouth is totally dominated by hoppy bitterness. Could hardly taste the 60min I had after. Will defenatly be buying more of this!!"
"D: A fantastic beer... one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. God, how I wish I had regular access to this beer. Dangerously easy to drink!"
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Thick, white, fluffy head retains nicely with sticky, oily, resinous lacing. Aroma is primarily grapefruit and citrus and is very intense. Taste is bitter, sharply bitter and juicy citrus and pine. Not picking up much of a malt backbone although this keg was filled in October so it's very fresh. I'm sure the malt is just overpowered by the freshness of the hops. I'm not complaining. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Delicious west coast classic double. Divine."
"Pour from their """large""" bottle. Golden amber color with good carbonation and frothy head. Pleasant floral aroma, but based on the description was expecting a bit more of a punch to the nose. Taste is floral and grapefruit. Not overpowering but on the high end of hoppy. Some sweetness, but definately an afterthought. A very strong showing for an IPA, in my opinion."
"D: I could drink a few of these and be quite content. Though as a novice in the world of hops, I might want to reach for something different after 2 or 3. Nonetheless my introduction to hoppy beers has begun."
"Pours nicely with a decent head fading into a nice lace. Good hazy, deep golden color. The nose is kind of funky, musty almost, but with some citrus and hops. The flavor is good, rich hops, and has none of the funk I got from the nose. The texture is medium with decent tannins from the fresh, bitter hops. Fairly good but might be a bottle variation. Will purchase from a different store and re-evaluate again. =)"
"Note: I have revisited (bottles and tap) this beer a few times since the review, same results. Maybe I outgrew it, but I'm just not feeling it anymore."
"Bottle. Pours a nice dark golden color with a considerable head. Loads of citrus and pine, a smooth palate up front with a considerable hop bite towards the finish. A classic really, the hops are huge, but not as great as some of the ones produced in the past 5 years. I'll have it on tap anytime."
"D: I wouldnt want to many of these in one sitting because of the effect it would have on my palate. It is very tasty but the whole bomber would be a tough task."
"Overall an outstanding beer. I would highly recommend this."
"Good and hoppy. You have to be in the mood for it, but if you are, it really hits the spot. I love intense - especially pine resiny - double IPAs when I'm outside in the cold for some reason. This ale has a bitter, crisp finish. Obviously on the overly hoppy side, but it never claims to be well-balanced."
"Slightly hazy copper pout with creamy head and nice lacing. Huge resiny hoppy nose with lots of citrus and sweet malts. Taste is pretty much just like the smell, a total hop bomb! But with that said, it's incredibly balanced. The bitterness is nicely complemented by the sweet malts. Lots of orange and grapefruit emerge as you go. A crisp and tangy dry finish makes this highly drinkable for such an over the top beer from one of the top breweries in the world!"
"I'd love to have this beer super fresh. In the state that I enjoyed it in, however, it is still close to world-class in its style. Beautiful, bright flavors working with each other make for a wonderful drink. It is only lacking in intensity on the palate. A couple of weeks longer and my score may not be as high as it is today. Either way, this is a treasure of a beer. Man, I wish that I had regular access to Stone in MO."
"Overall there's really not a whole lot that could be improved with this beer. Give it a shot if you haven't already."
"Notes. There are lacey rings on the glass. Its an IPA, what else do I need to say? It's a bit expensive here. $18 for a 6-pack, and $6.50 for the Bomber bottle. But if you want GREAT beer- here it is. A truly """great""" beer."
"though being a sipper of a beer, its not too heavy making the drinkability really good."
"D: Very drinkable, although this is definantly an after meal beer, really after you want to be able to taste anything at all besides hops the rest of the night."
"this beer finishes med bodied and with a good lasting bitterness. what a wonderful esample of what stone can do with malt and hops!"
"Overall, a good, solid brew from a good solid brewery, that may be starting to believe their own hype."
"SUMMARY: This is an absolute must try. Can't wait to get on tap."
"D - This is one double IPA that I can't get enough of. A classic that more or less defined the style. This is a standby/go to beer for me. One of the most drinkable DIPA's around. Not a session beer at all, but easy to have a couple of these."
"I used to really dislike IPA's but over the last year I have acquired the taste for them. This IPA is called """Ruination""" because it claims that it will ruin you for other IPA's that may come across your pallet in the future. This is an exceptionally true statement. Although it cost me nearly $5 for a single bottle, I will definitely be buying this again. This beer truly lives up to its name."
"Review from notes taken on: 10/14/09."
"Well comes it with the bitterness and then the malt comes up, big and sweet as the hops gain a second wind that's full of lemon and big pine sap. A slight edge of herbs and grapefruit ride makes a kind of lighter sweetness towards the end of the flavor. The mouth feel is full and creamy and kind of gas like, I can taste it in all part of the mouth, more than other beers for sure. Overall, this isn't the slicing hop ruination I was promised on the bottle, but its damn tasty that's for sure."
"This brew is a very drinkable hoppy brew. It is bitter and does have me burpin' up some flowery hops already, but it is a damn drinkable brew. Very good brew, easy to session."
"D - Surprisingly easy to drink. Quite tasty, but a bit one dimensional, in my opinion--not a lot of complexity to the flavor, but still very nice."
"Poured to a one fingered slightly offwhite head. IPA itself was a yellowish slightly brown color. Head hung around for a little while and left some nice lacing. Smelled of citrus, piney hops,and had a slight sweet smell. Tasted a little sweet at first then got that hoppy bitter flavor. That bitter aftertaste hung around for a while. Also had some alcohol flavor going on. Carbonation was good and it felt good in the mouth. Would love to drink these all night. i dont think you could with the higher alcohol content. But would love to give it a try."
"The beauty of this beer is that I can't taste or feel the alcohol in this at all. It's strong but only because of what's written on the bottle. As other on here have attested, this is a textbook I.P.A. and won't disappoint anyone looking for the epitome of this style. Once again, Stone has another winner here!"
"Drinkability:yes"
"I think you really have to be in the mood for an IPA to drink this, but I highly recommend it. I think this epitomizes what a great IPA should taste like."
"D - Love the piney hoppiness - bursting with flavor, really stimulates the senses."
"Beer is slightly warm in the mouth. Not a strong alcohol content in the flavor though. Moderate mouthfeel, not too thick not to thin. The definite feel of the beer is in the hop character. There is a lot of back end bitterness, mostly pine in nature, an interesting beer. The midpalate flavors are covered by the high malt. Drinkability is fine. The bitterness grows on me and ends up slowing the consumption."
"All the good points for a solid DIPA are met here. Not the best of the style I've had, but still pretty damn good, and one of the more affordable options at that."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Now that it is getting colder I tend to reach for a beer that combines flavor and content. Ruination is a definite winner, any hophead will not be disappointed."
""""Liquid poem to the glory of the hop""""
"D: At first I wasn't sure if I liked this beer because I mostly noticed a bitter taste in the back of my throat. However, after a few sips I was able to taste the other flavors and enjoyed the beer very much. I would easily drink Ruination again, but I wouldn't want it all the time."
"D - Very drinkable. Will definitely drink again now that Stone is available in CT (finally)."
"This reminds me of the old grape nuts commercial with Euell Gibbons ("""ever eat a pine tree? Many parts are edible.""") Tastes like I'd imagine a pine tree would taste...bitter, but with some pine and sweet aromas. 12 oz bottle (from make-your-own 6 pack), poured to glass. Cloudy yellow in appearance, frothy head. Fruity, piney aroma. Fairly sweet but the hops kicks in early and aggressively, through the finish. Not really in balance and got tiresome to me. Not bad but don't think I'd get again."
"D: Very nice. I want another and I'll keep buying sixers."
"not recommended for the inexperienced palate."
"song- """pressurecooker""""
"Had two bombers of this again, and its an ok beer. Its quite drinkable and easy going down. But its not blowing me away. Honestly, this feels sessionable to me."
"Drinkability: quite good, considering its intensity. This is probably best consumed with some heady or unctuous foods."
"Outrageously delicious and drinkable. It wreaks havoc on the taste buds, which is awesome. One of my favorites."
"D - If this were readily available in Kansas City it would be my favorite IPA for session consumption."
"Salud!"
"D: Start and end with Ruination, and you won't have a problem, besides a splitting headache the next day, probably accompanied by heartburn. A really nice DIPA for the hop fan, and a nice high ABV to keep it fresh tasting off the shelf, which it certainly is. Palate shot. Thanks, Stone!"
"D- This is a highly drinkable beer that I would recommend to someone who wants to take the hop plunge but wants something that is not going to wreck it for them. I only wish I could drink more than two bombers of this before going onto something else. I mean I could drink it all night but who wants to stay with one beer?"
"The intense tastes makes it a little less drinkable than, say, an equally ABVd beer (like Founders Centenial) but for an DIPA, very drinkable."
"Drinkability - This was the first drink of the night and it was a bit tough to finish it but only because I was so incredibly full from eating fondue. Overall I was impressed and look forward to getting some fresher bottles soon."
"The beer is very dry with an upper moderate level of bitterness. It tastes of bitter grapefruit, orange pith, and pine resin. Caramel notes are quickly overrun by the delicious hops. The finish is very, very dry."
" Not sure that this is a beer to drink on a regular basis. This is a beer to get for those times when you need a hop fix. Like the label says, I think my pallet is ruined for trying anything else tonight. I'm actually new to the hop bus, but I now understand why these beers are so popular. Thank you Stone! This one is amazing!"
"I am admittedly not a huge Stone fan as I find their beers very one-noted and simply lacking. This is one of their better efforts, however. Very nice hop flavoring with a nice balance make this a very good IPA. Not as good as I remember it, but still a nice IPA I would revisit in the future."
"Ruination IPA will ruin your chances of ever enjoying an industrially produced lager again. It will ruin your taste for mass-processed beer and even ruin your tolerance for others drinking them. This is a lesson in how beer should be made: with character and with pride. Look at the American micro scene - Ruination IPA has actually built a lot."
"Medium mouthfeel, and a dry afterbite make this drinkable. If you love northern pine, drink away. You may feel like a logger after drinking this one."
"I was expecting a brighter taste, but overall not a bad beer. The finish is what one would expect from an IPA, but the mid was a little off as far as I am concerned. This would work well if it had more of an Imperial feel too it. Overall, I would not buy it again, but it was certainlly worth the money to try it."
"Love it! Complex, and enjoyably drinkable."
"D- very well put together. a tought looking label for a tough beer to put down."
"It was good, but not something I would drink over and over again. I don't agree with the """world's best IPA""" label it seems to get."
"I'm going back for more"
"Need a hop fix? Hard to say no to this one. Looking for balance? Probably not your thing. As for me, loved it."
"Drinkability: Fantastic sort of a catch 22, its probably not the kind of beer you want to drink a lot of , but once you start drinking it your not going to be able to drink anything else. So, quite drinkable. I had three"
"This is a very good DIPA, but not great IMO. I gave drinkability a lower score since there are other much more affordable DIPAs, including PtE, that are better, or nearly as good. I especially enjoyed this today after my 100-mile Salem Bicycle Club """Peach of a Century""" bicycle ride after enjoying Arrogant Bastard Ale. A nice combination on what appears the last warm day of summer-early autumn in the PNW."
"Great DIPA, just not very drinkable, one bomber is enough. Ruination is on the more bitter end of the DIPA spectrum, but this is a must try for hop heads everywhere."
"Take Stone IPA and hop-it-up several notches. Terrific amber/orange color and a clean white head on the pour. The aroma is much stronger than most double IPA's due to the quality of hops used...you can tell. Lacing is absolutely beautiful. You can tell Stone takes great pride in this offering....from every detail. If you're not that into hops, you will hate this beer. It's not balanced at all, nor is it intended to be. This is a must on every hop-head's list."
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these without any problems at all."
"Pours a pale yellow/light orange color with a hearty head of single finger semi off-whiteness. Smell is wonderfully filled with hops boasting citrus, pine, grass and nearly lemon-like aroma as well. Taste is a blast of hop bitterness, almost oil-like the way the bitterness rolls around the tongue. However, it gives way to malt sweets as well. Finish is long and bitter reminding me for some reason of the sacks of lupulin clinging to hops responsible for this madness taking place in my mouth right now. Could easily drink another but my ability to taste is now desensitized...I'll save another bottle for a different day."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall- Great name for a great beer."
"You're not cool unless you drink this beer. The name is cool, the bottle is extra cool, and the contents are terrific. Poured into a snifter, it has a cloudy orange color with a foamy, cream-colored head that dissipates to leave a bit of lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is pungent with scents of grapefruit and pine hops. The first sip is powerfully bitter without being overwhelming. The next taste is a big gulp that leaves my tongue saturated with hop oils so that the bitterness lingers for a few seconds. Despite this powerful hop character, you could almost call the flavor balanced because of the bit of malt sweetness, and the carbonation makes it go down surprisingly easy. It is just fun to have this beer in the fridge, because every once in a while you want to be reminded how you can brutally assault your taste buds and enjoy every sip of it."
"Drinkability: I love this beer. Its very enjoyable and you want to pace yourself because it tastes soooo good. A very enjoyable beer and the glass won't leave your hand once you poor this beauty."
"Dr. It's very good, but there really are others that I would prefer."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Its sooo good. If you love double IPA's the way I do you will never want to put this one down."
"Overall: Hop bomb for a hop head.. what can i say. Nirvana."
"All in all, one of the best examples of an Imperial IPA."
"Aroma is stunning and bright with floral and citrus notes. Flavor is almost entirely of hops. Strong bitterness and grapefruit flavors, with pine and citrus. A bit of sweet malts in the background. The hop bitterness lingers in the back of your mouth leaving you wanting more. No strong alcohol flavors. Body is light and carbonation is moderate and pleasant. Overall a pretty good DIPA."
"D - Well, this kills your palate, but recently after the number of hop bombs I've had, I've found this to have at least average drinkability."
"For all the talk of ruin, there's a good malt backbone. Don't really feel the 100 IBUs anymore than I would 70. Intricate hops, though, good West Coast IPA."
"Introduced to this in Cincinnatti at the Dilly Deli. The aroma was full and very hoppy. The taste went to the tip and sides of my tongue. A very pleasant sensation for such a robust ale. After swallowing a light orange/citrus after taste was refreshing. The pint went down smoothly and I definately wanted another."
"D: A damn fine DIPA. It does lack a bit in the flavor and aroma department for me, but otherwise is a fantastic beer. I would really like to try this as fresh as possible, it may reach all fives in this situation. For now, I'll have to settle for my bottles I can smuggle over from Wisconsin."
"It settles amber in colour, with a half inch white head, which shows good retention. The carbonation is very lively. The aromas are fruity hops, grapefruit, hints of apple, and a subtle malty caramel base. The bitterness in the taste is monumental, however, it only really hits you after a swift but firm taste of toffee malts up front, after which you are assaulted by a floral bitterness, and perfumy grapefruit. The sustained bitterness of the aftertaste is impressive, and I have the feeling I will be tasting it for the rest of the week."
"Very drinkable though 2-3 glasses would be my limit."
"D= Complex enough to sip, but refreshing enough to gulp. Had to sip it to savor my 11oz half. Should have gotten my own bottle."
"D: Very good DIPA, has balance and not a total hop bomb."
"Notes: This is a great offering from Stone. A remarkable beer all through it. Cheers."
"D: Drinkability - well in truth, from the hops that punch you in the face from the first, not very very drinkalbe. In spite of that I think I'll have another...."
"D - Putting one or two down is easy and delicious. But I don't see anyone drinking an entire six pack at one time. Overall, it was very balanced and for a hop-head like myself this was heaven in a glass. what a wonderful beer!!"
"Exceptional beer."
"Jordan."
"Other- I really enjoyed this beer. I thought I wasnt into IPA's (DFH 90 min is too sweet), but this may have me reconsidering."
"MF/D: Very dry & bitter, medium body, very nice carbonation, lingering bitter hop finish."
"Drinks GREAT at 7.7% with this hop profile."
"Drinkability: Can't say it's too high, but then again, it's not really supposed to be, right? Very tasty and definitely a great beer."
"One of the very first real craft beers I had a few years ago. I remember swearing I'd never drink this kind of beer again. It's quite funny looking back now that that the IPA has easily become one of my favorite styles."
"Drinkability - Very intense beer with noticeable sweetness. Wouldn't want more than two."
"Notes: awesome 2ipa, very balanced for a west coast ipa, just all around good stuff"
"The balance between the sweetness and bitterness makes this very drinkable considering how many IBU's this is supposed to have."
"Overall: I have loved this beer for a long time now, but if you have the chance to get it on cast it makes a huge difference. The flavors pop out even more and the lighter carbonation allows the beer to really linger in your mouth"
"If your a hop head then your gonna think its alot easier to drink than someone who drinks nothing but bmc."
"Medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. This is definitely geared towards hopheads and thankfully, right up my alley. Aptly named, and as long as you're a fan of hoppy beers, this should be a great option to turn to."
"What can I say, I effing love this beer. This is the greatest beer ever."
"Notes: The head on tap was something to behold, quite a sight."
"D - I've always wanted to try a truly fresh Ruination and this opportunity didn't disappoint. Ruination is a truly great beer."
"A strong pour gets a fat fingers worth of fuzzy off white head that lasts for a few minutes and leaves no lace. The body is the tone of hazy honey that leans a little more towards amber. Nose is beautifully hoppy with the hops more of a pine veggie feel. First sip is very fresh and crisp up front then with a nice hop character that is like orange rind marmalade. With following sips the hop profile builds in strength, complexity and bitterness. The piney bight comes to the front as you drink also. The hops become so dominant that the whole mouth is overtaken creating a hugely bitter hoppy whole mouth feel. I don't mean for this to come off as a bad thing though, because through all this it is a wonderfully drinkable brew targeted at hop lovers."
"I have had this beer numerous times and was suprised when I realized that I had not reviewed it yet. I remember getting a bomber of this in a trade long before Stone was distributed here in NC. Now that I am able to get my hands on it at any time I really don't buy it anymore. This is a solid Imperial IPA and one of the very first kinds that brought me into the Imperial IPA realm. I have since explored various other variations of this style and have found that even though this was a good beer there are others out there that I find a tad bit better. I am glad that I bought a few bottles of this, for old time sake, and I plan on gettting this again in the future; however I am sure that I will reach for something else when I am searching out an Imperial IPA 9 times out of 10 but there is always that 1 time, like now for example."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of off white, sticky head. It is amber in color and clear. I immediately smell the hops, citrus and pine. I get a hint of the malt on a second whiff. This beer is very bitter. Its bitterness overpowers any malt. It is not very drinkable. I don't think I would really want a second in a sitting. It has its place, but definitely not a session beer. Although, this would be a good starter if I had to attend a festival or party that was going to serve Miller Lite. It would probably destroy that skunky taste."
"Big taste but not outrageously high ABV."
"Overall, certainly one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Intense, complex, and balanced flavors make this an exceptional brew."
"Pours a golden amber color, there however, is not much of a head and there is little lacing left behind. The smell is great, many different hops are present. There is piney and floral hops as well as fruit notes of grapefruit and other citrus. The overall taste is good as well, the beer is hoppy with piney hops and earthy hops dominanting the taste, little malt backbone. Mouthfeel is good a slight carbonation and a little alcohol burn. Overall even though it is a big hop taste it isn't as overpowering as some, it is smooth and drinkable for an imperial ipa."
"Purchased from Ray's Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. Poured a very bright, light gold body with not much foam at all. Could this be an old bottle? I see sediment in the bottle... Aroma is great -- fruity and citrusy hops. Medium bodied, this beer blasts you with hops up front which then linger on the sides of the tongue. Spicy bitterness that is on the end of the spectrum that I don't like. Warming alcohol feeling in the finish. I won't be trying this again unless I see it at a tasting where I might get a sampling that is more fresh."
"It's worth a try but unlike the Hop Stoopid (twice a month), this is one I may drink twice a year."
"Pours a honey color, slightly cloudy, with a cream colored head that showed moderate retention. Aroma was of moderate strength and seemed simple and straightforward consisting of a orange and grapefruit citrus hop presence. Taste was sweet upfront with a noticeable orange citrus flavor and hints of honey. Hop bitterness comes through very strongly on the finish, lingering through to the next sip. Bitterness was a bit much for my taste in this style. Mouthfeel was smooth and pleasant for this medium bodied offering. Overall, this beer was enjoyable and relatively easy drinking."
"Would absolutely recommend every hophead try!"
"Poured from a bomber bottle into my tanker mug (32oz). The head and foam looked like it came off a coffee drink about an inch and a half high. Sticks to the glass. Just by smell I can tell it is a hop bomb and that is putting it mildly. Citrus, pineapple along with the earthy, woodsy, piney flavors prevail. Very smooth mouthfeel but the alcohol is very hidden although it is relaxing to drink."
"Drinkability: Due to the relatively warm temperature for an IPA, it's a little less-so than a cooler D/IPA, but still very nice and enjoyable. Definitely glad I could enjoy it on cask as well."
"Perhaps the last bottle was a little old. I did not know how to check the date code then. This bottle there is the aroma and flavor of grapefruit and orange which I did not taste before. No grapefruit peeling this time. Revising the score upward. Previous overall score was 4.10."
"If you like IPA's, you'll probably come upon this one eventually in your search for the best, but I think you'll be disappointed. Ruination IPA; well said."
"O: One of my favorites, and one that I'd drink regularly if I'd the opportunity. Definitely not for everyone- if you aren't a fan of hoppy beers you probably won't enjoy this to the same extent as a dedicated hop-head. Still. Delicious."
"The draw settled into a finger-and-a-half of thick, tawny head with fantastic retention, especially given the heat and (relative) humidity. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very estrous with banana being the prevalent smell. Mouthfeel was really smooth with a light, honey-like taste on the tongue. Finish was smooth with a slight hoppy biterness that reminded me to slow down. Yow!"
"Time to drink like the big boys. I pour this beer into my pint glass and I feel empowered. It looks amazing. A beautiful cloudy golden hue is capped by at least two inches of off white head. The head settles leaving a cap that rests nicely on top of my glass. The aroma is.... HOPS! What the f*$k did you think it was gonna smell like. It smells like pure hops period. I can't find adjectives to describe it. Piney is an understatement. The flavor is so bitter and hoppy. It makes me pucker all the way to my toes. I imagine if you picked fresh pine needles smashed them into a grapefruit then took a bite. You couldn't get a more piney bitter taste in your mouth. It just keeps going too. I take a gulp and a minute later all I can taste is hops. I love it. It's medium bodied and leaves your mouth feeling tired and abused. This is a great DIPA. I will pick this up again."
"drinkability: one of my favorite beers, but to be enjoyed in small doses; i would love to drink this all day but don't know if my tastebuds could handle it; pleasantly """ruined""" i would say"
"Overall, this was good stuff. I'm not sure if it is deserving of it's rank among the best in the world, but that just shows the taste of most people on this website. If you like over the top hops and don't plan on tasting anything else for the next 12 hours, you should try this one. If you are new to the craft beer scene or aren't a confirmed hophead, than dear god stay away!"
"Overall a great double. Not AS boozy as others but still enough there to kick you in the pants. Definitely give this one a shot if you can!"
"This stuff goes down like candy water though, i think i could easily down a 6pack of bombers. Overall not the beas DIPA but a highly, highly worthy one."
"D- This is one GREAT double IPA. Gold standard would be a good definition."
"D: This is extremely drinkable, destroys your palate to the point of not even daring to try another brew after one of these as it will most likely taste like swamp water. This is probably my favorite of the DIPA's I've tried, I prefer with the little bit of age over it being fresh as well."
"D: Delicious...I could really get into this and I think that it is definitely frighteningly drinkable..."
"Poured into tulip crystal golden-orange with a thick white head. Great lacing. Smell has a """grass""" smell to it. Like the hops are very green. The taste has a good bite to it, but nothing extraordinary. That is until I began to eat my tortilla soup that I had to go with this beer. The back of the bottle says that this beer ruins the palatte, making any food taste bland. Quite the opposite. This beer actually made the spicy Tortilla Soup hotter. The beer magnified the spices of the soup on my lips, which was almost painful."
"Hopped to shit is the phase used by one of the employees at Chip's to describe this beer. Overall it's right on par with Stone IPA in that is is very citrusy and hop heavy. Great taste though. Very refreshing i found. Nice foamy head that stuck around for a while and the color was a nice lighter shade. Looks pretty standard. I'm for sure going to have to buy this one again. One of my favorites"
"D: Bitter and boozy, but a delicious DIPA."
"Well another one of my sought after beers that I finally found. Pours from the bottle a thick golden amber color with a big white head with tons of lacing, the aroma is of lemons and of course tons of hops, the hops take you to a back alley and kick the crap out of you. Taste is awesome just a great combo of hops and just enough malt to make it a beer and not just a hop tea. Mouthfeel is very good, only downfall to this beer is the drinkability one beer is attacking me more than most. Still glad to have the privelage of enjoying this beer"
"This tastes great not sure if I prefer this or the regular stone ipa, both are great. Tastes very smooth and I think it's pretty drinkable. Good amount of carbonation helps the mouthfeel. Not sure I would drink this all the time but it's worth trying and I will order this again."
"Plenty of flavour and just a great example of this highly hopped, amped up style."
"D: A very good DIPA with lots and lots of hops and complex flavors. Despite the massive bitterness in the finish it really manages to come off quite balanced. Too bad I suspect that this bottle was a little old."
"A little hotter than a typical double ipa, particularly given the low abv but a good double none the less . Like the arrogant bastard, i don't get it as much as i might sinces it's become so available but i think it's worth getting over many double ipas."
"Edit: Having this on tap at stone, I enjoyed it a lot more fresh and can say that is drinkable and I am adjusting my score."
"D - An absolutely delicious, but equally devastating brew. The definition of """one and done", it's sure to have you pleasantly belching hops for the rest of the evening."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth and for such a strong beer the whole thing goes down remarkably fast. It's a testament to the brewer that such a hop bomb can be so drinkable."
"Serving was out of a bottle poured into a kindy crappy tulip glass. I have some quality glassware on order. After the initial pour I poured the rest into a pint glass where the carbonation and head height made themselves more prevalent."
"The beer is well-carbonated, has a great bitter profile and finishes nice and dry. It highlights all the things you want when you drink an IPA and takes them to the extreme. This is a hop showcase that I can definitely drink more of in one sitting than I should."
"Poured cloudy orange color with small head. Aroma was very noticeably citrus. The taste was fairly strong citrus and a hoppy bitterness, a little stronger than Stone's regular IPA (which I liked). I am becoming more of an IPA fan as I try different varieties, AleSmith IPA still the gold standard in my unworthy opinion."
"Overall - An impressive beer. Hops take the stage and never go in for intermission."
"This beer is special to me because it taught me how unique beers can be. The first beer I tasted that wasn't in a 30. Stone Ruination IPA gave me my passion of craft beer. Enjoy this beer."
"D: I would say that this is a very drinkable beer. It is strong, so caution should be used, but it goes down so smooth and is absolutely delicious."
"Ruination really had more citrus than I can remember in a beer. Lots of character. Very hoppity, hop hopper. Glad Stone makes this and is fun for the occasional hop binge."
"D- This is intense"
"What a hop smack in the kisser! I have long awaited Stone's arrival to Florida. This was a one oily IPA. Poured an orange amber. Smell of thick hop resin, pine, pineapple, and some flowery bouquet. The taste was a mass deadening of the taste buds with hop oil coating every inch of my tongue and a finish that lasts forever. A scarily drinkable IPA with a high ABV."
"a great beer, however, not as intimidating as the brewer might want you to believe. far from being a source of ruination for the palate, this beer should be renamed 'celebration' for the rich and satisfying experience of being able to enjoy so many ibu's while remaining refreshing."
"Overall, an excellent IPA that I will be consuming again in the future. Not quite as balanced as the Dogfish Head 90 min, but certainly notable for its huge flavor."
"D: If you have a high hop tolerance, then hell yeah. It's so strong though, that for most, it will be a bit much on it's own. A good beer to nurse with appetizers - just don't expect to actually taste the food."
"Massages my palate. such a tasty IPA. one of my fav's."
"D - As far as DIPAs go, this is one of my favorites. Hard to taste the alcohol behind the hops and malt, but who cares. Well-layered hop profile makes every sip different and exciting. This is a feel-good brew, for those that like hops, at least! A must-try for fans of strong IPAs."
"This is a really hoppy brew, with a complexity that is unusual for the style. It sports a nice head with good retention atop a dark amber body. Nice but simple lacing. The aroma is just slightly floral with a hint of malt. On the palate, this mouthy smooth brew starts with a nice sweetness, that is quickly replaced by the bitterness of the hops. Moderate carbonation combines with the rest to make this a robust drink. The finish is decidedly bitter hop, with a long, long bitter aftertaste. A really nice brew when you're in the mood for something to fill your senses. But, you don't want to drink too many in one sitting."
"Best Double IPA I have had. Poured golden/orange but was also as clear as water, 1-2 finger foamy head that lasted as long as it was in my glass. Smelled like a room full of hops/bitterness and some citrus in there too. Tastes how I want my DIPA to taste, hoppy as hell and extreme bitter, some fruit in there with that too. Pretty thin with good carbonation, very smooth. Could drink this one all night, so tasty and hoppy, not very filling at all and no alcohol taste."
"Drinkability- excellent DIPA, good thing I have more of them. I love it!"
"As always, this beer and brewery has lived up to its name and reputation. Although still not much really need be said about this beer but that it's another gem from Stone. I'm ruined!"
"Love this stuff."
"O- Top 5 DIPA for me. The fresher, the better."
"M&D: the carbonation runs quietly underneath the rich hoppy flavour but the microscopic fizz does initially render a sort of bite from the back of the palate; as the beer goes, the carbonation also softens and a nice consistency b/w flavour and texture is arrived at. This balanced and delicious DIPA is not terribly complex, to be honest, but it does enjoy the best of both worlds where the depth and body of hops complement, rather than overpower, the other flavour elements on the whole. The high level of hop bitterness also camouflage the alc. strength, hence a truly, um, """easy-drinking""" ale for Bitter lovers like me!"
"D- A very good beer that definitely has its place in the DIPA's...but if you are expecting something over the top in the DIPA family, I would suggest something along the lines of an Unearthly, Double-dog, 90/120 Minute, Double Simcoe, etc., etc, etc....But still VERY good in its own right, and worth a try...Cheers!"
"Overall impression: P#ssies take a pass on this one. Awesomely agressive brew."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Very chewy. Lots of malt body."
"Stone Ruination IPA is a very nice double IPA that works well at the end of a summer day or with a winter meal. It's versatile and an enjoyable experience."
"D - A great double IPA true to the west coast integrity a beautifully bitter and intense beer which is probably better sampled with food. The beer lives up to the name Ruination"
"4 nice beer, but less complex than expected. also easier to drink and easier-going in general than expected (or maybe i've just become too habituated to hops). the low carb level prompts me to gulp the stuff before the remaining co2 is liberated."
"This beer is great. I'm buzzed already. I let my girlfriend have a sip and she hated it."
"Drinkability: Nice, drinkable DIPA, especially considering the low abv (for a DIPA). This really seems more like a standard IPA with stronger bitterness and a slightly higher abv (really, 7.7% is not that high for a DIPA)."
"Great Stone DIPA, surprisingly very balanced and not too much over the top. Much recommended!"
"Bold crisp flavors stand out in this beer. Great DIPA! The aroma is nice. After two of these i'm satisfied. Some real good pine and citrus in this one. I love the hints of grapefruit in this. Decent ABV not too boozey. It looks terrific in the glass and the head is nice and oily. The aftertaste could be a little cleaner but its still excellent. Ive had this many times out of a keg and bottles. Delicious either way and the label kicks butt just like most of Stones labels. I will be drinking more of this. I recommend this one."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with red hues. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into moderate lacing. The aroma is tons of citrus and grapefruit, a lot of pine resin, and a faint hint of malt. The taste is very fruity, oranges, peaches, grapefruit, nice bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very nice IPA that I wold love to drink again."
"I must say as well, Stone has great looking bottles as well! not only great time and care into the brewing process but also the delivery method/appearance!"
"Full body that flowed creamy."
"All in all this is a good IPA that has something going for it, like other reviews in which I stated, if only I could try this fresher."
"the """ruination""" of the palate makes it hard to drink more than one at a setting."
"Given the vagaries of scoring system here it will receive a lower overall rating from me than it deserves as the appearance is nothing to write home about (which isn't something I care about too much) and it is too big to be hugely drinkable."
"Ok so this is the second best DIPA that I have ever had. Appearance was top notch, big billowing head with tons of lacing. Smell and taste are very good as well- tons of grapefruit and floral hops. YES. Also some sweet caramel malt actually tries to sneaking in an balance it out a bit. Finishes quite clean with the oily finish. Drinkability is out of this world."
"Hazy from the cask at The Linkery in downtown SD, has a bit of the nitro-thing going on (I doubt it's nitro, just whatever happens in the cask that makes it look like that.) The smell is heavily of Northwestern hops, maybe chinook and centennial, not as fruity as cascade though. IIRC, stone uses an assload of chinook. The taste is everything you want in an IPA. My dad was drinking a different, """normal," IPA and this made it taste and look like a german lager...muwhahaha!!! It's truely sad that I think this is a balanced beer now. Other IPA's now pale ales, and pale ales, well, weak. Look what you did to me homebrewing! A bit hard to quaff down, but boy it's tasty. Stone just destroys all."
"J"
"I enjoy this beer once in a while becxause it's a really good ipa, but I could never drink many of them."
"An excellent double IPA. Very hoppy, but with balance. No real weird flavors or anything either, like I get in so many beers of this style."
"Drinkability - I'm just now finishing this six-pack that i bought about a month ago. I'm not far enough along in my beer drinking career to fully appreciate the DIPAs - just too much for me. This one is definitely a sipper."
"This finishes very clean and not too bitter. This is easily the best pound for pound IPA I've had. Ruination is the pretty girl next door who notices you!"
"D - I'd say the drinkability is high for this beer with 7% or so ABV. A very good IPA. I will definitely look for this one again."
"Upon pouring into a pint glass, this beer is a light orange color with a one finger head. The smell is of citrus and spices. Ruination tastes hoppy, some orange, lemon, other fruits, well balanced taste. Mouthfeel is very dry afterwards, have a water to the side. Drinkability is solid overall, pretty good beer."
"A friend picked this up for me in Houston. Cracked one open yesterday, poured a clear golden/bronze color with little white head, sparse lacing on the glass. Smelled of fresh hops, very citrusy, and a little piney. Tasted very citrus hoppy, mildly bitter. Well carbonated, a little dry but smooth. Very drinkable, only wish I had more."
"D - Excellent, the malt finish holds off the bitterness enough to make drinking a few of these possible despite the very high IBU profile."
"Great aroma, it's immediately in your face with citrus hop aroma and you want to drink it. When you do you are so glad that you did that you drink more and notice the great lacing, and then more and the taste blows you away. Pretty soon it is gone and you are sad, but then you are once again happy because you realize you just had one of the best beers you have ever had, and it doesn't hurt that you have 5 more in the fridge!"
"I like the diatribes and I love the labels on these bombers. Stone fucking rocks."
"Its dangerously gulpable, but at almost 8% abv, you'd better be careful."
"D - Scarily drinkable. I didn't know the ABV and guess that it was probably a 6% and maybe 7% at most. I was wrong - but that's how well it is masked. Wonderfully tasty and easy to drink."
"Wow, this is one great IPA. Not too over on the citrus. What amazed me is the balance in the taste and smell of this beer. Surely I need another one for future tasting. Certainly another beer to add to my MUST BUY list!"
"Well, I'm drunk-ish but fairly happy with this beer. It was a good one to chalk up on to the list o' """must-have brews""" board. It'll be a long time before I can get this guy again (not distributed to anywhere within a two or three states in any direction from here) but I'm super happy with the beer and I'm quite happy I went out of my way to get it when I was in an area that had it. I hope Stone can find a way to my state because this brew is special and I wouldn't be too terribly adverse to drinking this guy as often as possible."
"D - Very drinkable considering its 7.7% abv and 100+ IBUs. Powerful, delicious flavors that don't disappoint. Any hophead could enjoy this one. Stone never seems to let me down."
"I drank 2 of these today (with a Nor Cal mixed in for fun) and if not for having to get home, could have had a couple more, a great beer with a good drinkability"
"Overall: Even with the strong hop bomb, this DIPA is pretty damn balanced due to the nice malty start which eases the drinker into the hoppy fun. The 7.7% ABV is very well hidden. Stone fails to disappoint yet again."
"Poured from bomber, a mostly clear bright orange with creamy eggshell colored head, thick lacing. Smell: hops are on display, piney, earthy, citrus rind, candied citrus, with a soft toasted malt sweetness in the background. Taste: serious hoppiness, pine, floral, earthy, white grapefruit, tangerine, as well as toasty caramel sweet malt, that surfaces towards the end of the sip only to be beat out again by a nearly-puckering leafy, piney hop punch and lingering case of citrus-tongue. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, soft. Drinkability is off the charts for a DIPA, as the lower alcohol level, which is present only as a gradual building warmth, helps keep the focus on the hops and not on the booze."
"D - I stand by the statement that I am not a fan of the IPA's. However, beers like this and the Dogfish Head 60 minute are gradually opening me up to the style."
"This beer is not for the feint of heart--I think you'll either love it or hate it. It's not the most complex beer, it's not balanced in that it's mostly all hop bitterness, but if you like that sort of thing then I don't think you'll find a beer that manages to deliver bitterness while still being tasty and delicious better than this."
"This is always a winner and the beer on tap mirrors the nice drink found in a bottle. Nice mouthfeel and character all around."
"D - great beer, but although i will purchase/enjoy again, i probably couldn't see myslef haveing more than one in a session."
"Pours medium amber with generous white head. Nose is the most amazing feature of this ale on tap - a fresh citrus candied aroma from heaven. Hard to believe the draft is so much better than the bottle. Big hop profile on the palate and incredibly smooth all the way through the finish."
"Believe the Hype here ladies and gentleman! Poured from a bomber into my Duvel Tulip. Very nice 3 finger head with great piney and citrusy smells happening. Taste is unreal and ranks way up there with hops attack on your palate. Not for the timid or non-IPA lover. Mouthfeel is great and drinkability is pretty good for a DIPA. In my top five for DIPA's for sure. As with all IPA's the fresher the better, so don't store em' drink em!!!"
"D- An awesome DIPA. When you craving a beer with a big hop presence, go for this one."
"D - Something that I would reach for again and again...the hops seem to be like a good, spicy food...powerful, but makes you want more"
"Wow. It's been awhile sense I've had this brew. No wonder it's $5.99 a 22oz. A hop-heads dream. This beer is both complex and balanced, floral and piney, bitter and smooth. Stone seems to possess some-sort of mastery over the hop."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable considering the hop content. One of my favourite IPAs for sure!"
"A nice hazy golden orange color body with a short soapy white head. Aroma is huge amounts of hops,piny,citrus,resin, floral, with a hint of the malty goodness.Flavor is crisp and bright, citrusy,spicy and floral hops,quite resiny,a little grainy,a,nice malty side,just enough to keep things in order, not a sticky mess or a bitter bomb,just a really nice show of hops,medium carbonation,full body,loads of sticky lacing,a long hoppy finish,this is very good stuff, I will buy this again."
"D- If you hate hoppy beers you won't like this. That said for being a hop delivery device this is quite delicious. If you are looking for just an IPA this is way beyond that. At 7.7% abv, you have to be careful about how many of these you go through."
"This is an outstanding DIPA that lets the hops shine and is a must-try for hop heads out there."
"This is one hell of a beer. This beer truly lives up to its name. My taste buds have been wonderfully decimated by loads of deliscious hop flavor. It has truly ruined my palate for the evening...and that's a good thing!"
"Future outlook: Took me awhile to getting around to trying this one, but I'm happy that I did. Yet another outstanding twist on the DIPA."
"Rerate: on tap a couple times here in DC and I have to say that I like it more than the times I had it out of the bottle back in California. Very hoppy and bitter, but with the perfect amount of malt balance and a dry finish. A great IIPA to down a pint of and not get pounded with malt and alcohol."
"Having said all that, it's definitely not the worst DIPA I've had. But I have to disagree with the quotation underneath the logo on the bottle, """A liquid poem to the glory of the hop.""" No. I've had so many beers that are so much better at highlighting all of the deliciousness and complexity you can get from using a good variety of hops. This beer, on the other hand, is an ode to bitterness, that's it."
"m&d: smooth creamy mouthfeel making an extremely drinkable beer."
"D - A top-notch DIPA that I put above Racer X, Exponential Hoppiness, and HopSlam. I really liked this one (obv)!"
"I thought that the Stone IPA was great, but the contrast between the smell and the taste here add another layer of depth and this is my favorite brew thus far."
"Drinkability: This has easily become one of my favorite beers. I wish I had a growler instead of just 22 oz of this beer. It has an incredible smell and everything about it is truly wonderful."
" I would have another, but I wouldn't call this a session beer by any means. After two or three, I think my taste buds might be begging for death and it would be a waste of this hop explosion."
"What I love about this IPA is that for people who are used to """piss""" beer(Keystone, Bud, Coors, you get the idea), it is completely out of their league. """Horrible""" is a word often said to me by friends who I deem worthy of a swig. One of the hoppiest beers around my neck of the woods(North Idaho) and coincidently it comes from one of my favorite breweries, Stone."
"Poured from a bomber bottle into a pint glass. Paired with some cheese and chips and salsa. Golden/copper color. Big rocky white head, leaves a lot of lacing. Smells like fresh American hops, like you're literally holding a bunch of them up to your nose. Big and piney. Theres a lot of carbonation. Definitely a big beer with enough malt to stand up to the hops. Fairly warming with all the alcohol. As it gets warmer you get a lot of citrus flavors, grapefruit I guess? Beats 90 Minute and Hop Wallop I think."
"Pours reddish copper with less carbonation than one would expect for an American IPA. Smells predominantly of citrus. Nicely assertive hop bitterness with lots of grapefruit flavors and some grassy undertones at first, fading onto some piney notes near the end before a slightly sweet finish. A dry bitterness remains in the mouth after swallowing. Mouth feel is as one would expect from a beer of this size."
"D. A very good DIPA."
"d: A great sipper, but don't think you'll be able to taste anything else with any sort of discrimination after this one. There's a reason it's called Ruination, and that's your palette after drinking it."
"D - The bottle tells you that if you haven't had any IPA beers, this beer is not the place to start, and I'd agree. For a beer with 100+ IBUs it's pretty drinkable but by the end I was really sick of it. I'd suggest sharing this with a fellow hophead."
"taste is of grapefruit, caramel, pine, a touch of sweetness, and some citrus, ends bitter, some dryness, and tangy on the tongue."
"D - Probably one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've had. It's very enjoyable and the relatively low ABV makes it easy to put down a few before your palate gets weary."
"Ruination is bolder than the standard Stone IPA, piling on more of the citrus flavors I find pleasing, making the beer bigger and more complex.  Overall, I think I prefer the aromatics and the flavors of the Ruination over the standard Stone IPA.  But keeping style in focus, if I had to place Ruination among other DIPAs, I still think 90min would get my vote - my take is that the 90 is better balanced on the palate, something that West Coast examples seem unconcerned with.  Even though DIPAs/IPAs are a style I'm trying to come to grips with, I thought Stone's Ruination was a nice offering and one worth trying at least once."
"Excellent beer, I would definitely drink again. Seems like it would be especially good on a chilly autumn evening for some reason."
"Hats off to Stone. Those guys really know how to do it!"
"This one definitely does ruin your palate to some extent. However, it is delicious, and that keeps me going back for more. I don't know that I would want to drink the whole bomber all at once, but twelve ounces is about the perfect serving size. This would pair great with any spicy meal."
"The first 2x/Imperial IPA I've tried. It pours a great translucent golden and orange color color with a white head. Ridiculous amount of citrus, pine and earthiness scents off the bat. The scent is so prevalent - it's great around the nose. Taste is full of hops and citrus. The bitterness immediately presents itself in the aftertaste. 100 IBU's is no joke, it's very noticeable. Great taste nonetheless. Drinkability is not hard, it's sippable. Try it with a burger - it's great! The bitterness shouldn't deter you from trying the beer, it's definitely worth trying and tasting!"
"Pours a dark gold with a nice sized head. Nose of resinous pine and grapefruit hops. Such an intense smell. The taste had a sweet, malty start, but was decimated with a sour, syrupy finish. At times, it had an ice wine feel to it. Drinkability was average. This is another great beer by the guys at Stone."
"D: Drink this FRESH. I've sampled this several times, and the fresher it is, the better it is. Fresh hops overwhelm in a good way, almost to a sweetness rather than a bitterness. An amazing DIPA."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one. A little more fruit sweetness would have put this over the top for me. But a great brew just the same."
"Drinkability: Um..sure. I could probably have a couple, but I think overall I prefer the Arrogant Bastard over this one. Still a very good beer though."
"Drinkability is excellent, especially for a DIPA with an ABV of 7.7. Most I've tried recently were well within the 9 to 10 range."
"An excellent super-hoppy beer. Don't be scared by the label or reputation...well worth trying!"
"M/D - nicely balanced with a good hop bite, very smooth and tasty, this is one that you could drink all day and never get sick of it."
"Definitely drinkable. Stone makes good beers. I'll definitely try a fresh one sometime, but even if it's a little old, I still enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: This beer is one of those """Love it, or leave it""" beers. I'm definitely digging the intense hop profile. Many DIPAs play with the citrus or pineapple notes to offset the intensity of the hops. Ruination does no such thing. The hops are placed center stage, and this beer constantly reminds you of that time and again."
"Drinkability: I love this beer and I typically drink a couple as the taste is wonderful. But I probably wouldn't go too much beyond two though as for some reason, even with the moderate ABV, it kind of kicks my butt."
"D- One of my personal favorites (I'm a bit biased if you couldn't tell). Never the less, truly a great brew and a must for any hophead."
"an exceptional classic in the american craft brew renaissance. don't let the hype on this one (ruins the palette, etc.) distract you from the fact that this is simply a great, drinkable (if you like hops) ipa. (edit: okay, the dryness of the finish does kind of creep up on you, taking away a little from drinkability)"
"Overall a beer that any IPA drinker will enjoy."
"F'n great. The Ruination shines like a glass full of honey and smells like a florist. The most balanced IPA I've had this year. A happy medium between the Euro and American versions. Great lacing from first sip to last though the head itself dissipates rapidly. The flavors have a great balance, from teh hops to the alcohol, etc. The best part of the beer for me is the lack of a syrupy texture. Great body, good drinkability, a hell of an IPA."
"D - Not very high, although the interesting smell and taste make it easy to keep sipping in an attempt to pick up everything present. Felt very full afterward, and very expensive (>$4 per bottle), making this less drinkable than I would like to see."
"Pours a cloudy copper color with only a thin lace of head. The hops here will overload your senses here. Goes down smooth, but leaves a extremely bitter aftertaste on the tongue and is moderately carbonated. The hops here are enough to slam you on your ass. I don't care much for Double IPA's so it's hard to rate them high, but this is one of the better double IPA's I've had."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This beer poured a cloudy copper with a single-finger head. The nose is a combination of all different kinds of hops. It's mainly grassy and citrusy, with some floral and maybe a little pine as well. The taste is surprisingly smooth for all the hops it has, starting off with some bready malt that gives way to hops that shift as they linger. Definite citrus, woodiness, spiciness, and floral in nature. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some low carbonation. This beer is deceptively drinkable, I for all the hops I expected it to sit a lot heavier than it does."
"D- Delicious. I could drink a couple of these, but forget tasting anything else you may drink after. Very strong as well."
"This beer is very light on the tongue, and I could see myself enjoying two or three of these in a sitting. The ABV is a little high for a sipper, though. Give it a shot!"
" It's like I'm a freshman in high school all over again, and Ruination is the cool senior boy hitting on me. I wanna get as much of it as I can, but I know I must keep my distance down inside. But indulging in it makes for purely hedonistic adventure."
"22 oz. bottle poured to a bright golden orange hue...lighter than I had anticipated. Smell was strong with oranges and pine. Fluffy head that quickly dissipated to a thin veil. The bitter hops overwhelms with the first sip leaving an aftertaste of grapefruit. Almost a resin mouthfeel that sticks in the back of your throat. This is an aftertaste that is not fleeting. That lovely taste hangs out for quite some time, which is a good thing. Overall, a very tasty hop assault."
"This beer is surprisingly drinkable considering the high IBU's and almost 8% ABV. It does destroy your chances of tasting your next beer fully. Very good! Cheers Stone!"
"This is such a damn good IPA. It doesn't wreak havoc on the palate but that's because it's well balanced. The hops linger. It's crisp. A 6-er is far from cheap but you will be rewarded."
"Drinkability: I'd sip and savor because this is my favorite style beer. Definitely session if you can stand it."
"I am, however, finishing (and enjoying) the whole bomber, just out of spite. Once again, take that, Gargoyle dude!"
"This is the first beer that has been so bitter that I have had a problem wanting to get to the bottom."
"This one is a bit harder to drink, although still very good, but more than one would likely put me on my ass."
"D: Can I just have large quantities of this instead next time I need general anesthesia for dental work? This was mind-blowing in its sheer power. While I wouldn't have this often, I will look forward to every time that I do."
"the taste is excellent great smooth hoppy flavor with apricots in back ground. Long lasting bitterness after taste. The mouthfeel is great smooth with a little carbonation medium bodied. I could drink this all night very easy to handle and just down right enjoyable this is probably one of my top 10 especially in the IPA or double ipa style."
"this is liquid hops. I have enough of an understanding of what I like to desire multiple aspects and qualities to a beer. some balance, maybe. and there is no balance here. it is hop, straight up, no exceptions."
"The flavor comes right to the front. Like most Stone beers you can not ignore the taste of their beers. IMO the straight forward strong flavor of the beer looses a slight degree of drinkability. It ends up being worth the trade off. The pallete does take a second to get used to the hop explosion but once it's up to speed, you enjoy it all the more."
"but still, couldn't take too many of these at a time. nice beer, nonetheless."
"D- Bring water. 10oz was good enough for me. I could not imagine polishing off a bomber of this. Small sips were needed as I got through this. Not my favorite but far from the worst. I knew what I was getting myself into, which is key when ordering this one."
"D: Given the abv, I could drink this all night long."
"Poured a very light golden sunshine color with a small head that refused to give way the whole glass. Smells of grapefruit foremost, with pines and sea water following. Taste is just plain bitter. Mouthfeel is full and just the right carbonation. I could drink this all night, ABV is pretty reasonable for a DIPA."
"D- I would love to drink a few of these but this beer is not for the light hearted"
"Poured into a pint glass, the color is a golden orange with a small white head. There is a good amount of lacing on the side of the glass. Smells of grapefruit, floral, pine. Not as bitter as I thought it would be. Hops and grapefruit hit me the most when drinking. Good amount of combination. I really enjoyed this one; could definitely see myself drinking more than one."
"Bottle Pours an orange gold with a big off white head. The head produces very nice lacing. Has a wonderful hoppy aroma of grasses, citrus and pine. Has good mouthfeel and perfect carbination. Good bitterness and a nice aftertaste. This is a good one."
"Speaking of which, drinkability is excellent as long as I'm not having more than a couple of pints an hour. More than that and the hops do start to pile up and """turn""" the beer for me."
"I easily put away the bomber I don't know if I could drink more than one at a time but I suppose it would be great with buffalo wings."
"All in all, one of my better liked Stone brews, with plenty of positives, and only minor imperfections."
"Taste is a nice kick in the face, the bitterness hits you right away followed by the citrus, piney aromas of the hops, not shy in mouth, no bitterness aftertaste, just a sweet like malty flavor that comes in and seems to balance everything out."
"D-Excellent drinkability. The light nature means teh alcohol is deceptively well-hidden. The taste is also extremely clean, as I find to be a common feature w/Stone. The water they use is high-quality."
"All in all, a good beer. Not so sure I'm a huge fan of the hop profile--I tend to like a little sweeter IPA. Definitely one to remember though."
"This is the definitive Imperial IPA for me."
"Drinkability/Overall- Smooth strong Ipa not think and clawie as some can be. Not my every day Double IPA but I am not a hop head."
"I know this is exactly what the brewer was going after, but I would have prefered more hop flavor and less hop bitterness."
"This was the beer that got me hooked on DIPA's. This has a decent appearance to it. Bright amber color with stark white head atop. Very strong bitter hop scents, mostly pine coming off this. Again, the hops take over the flavor with this one, killing whatever sweetness the malt had in mind. If you are a hop lover, the piney aftertaste will love you long time. Nice mouthfeel, rather light. Drinkability is high due to lower ABV (for a DIPA at least)."
"I could drink a bunch of these."
"On tap at Abraxas, into a St. Bernie's chalice it went. Straw-ish gold, thin head. Tried alongside Maharaja, this has a more varied nose - somewhat less citrus, a little more pine. Taste follows the nose, with the hops kicking ass in the forefront. Compared to the Maharaja, very little malt backing, so this is more of a puckering hop assault. Feel is downright light for a DIPA, making this dangerously drinkable. Alcohol is on the light side for this style, further adding to drinkability."
"This is a very citrusy, dry and bitter beer, but not overpowering like some other imperial IPAs. There's some biscuity malt, but this thing is all hops. The mouthfeel is incredible, very smooth and resinous, with low carbonation, which I love. Very lemony and puckering overall, but not too heavy and pretty drinkable. Alcohol is somewhat apparent. Enormously bitter aftertaste. Yep, this bomber ruined my palate for anything else the rest of the night. Awesome."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker """pint""" glass. Appears a hazy apricot color with about two fingers of tight off white head. A thick lace coats the inside of the glass with each sip. Smells of citrus hops, mainly grapefruit, some orange and lemon, Caramel malt, and floral hops. Tastes of tongue puckering hops - grapefruit pith, orange peel, pine caramel, very sticky and resinous. Medium in both body and carbonation. Think I'll have another."
"22oz bottle acquired in trade(thanks kiefdog!) Poured into pint glass. Pours a hazy golden color with a finger of foamy white head. Smell is hoppy, citrus, grapefruit mostly. Taste is grapefruit like hops upfront with a strong malt presence. Not a hop bomb like I was expecting but really good. Light-medium bodied mouthfeel. The easy drinking mouthfeel and low ABV(for a DIPA) make this extremely drinkable. Just an awesome beer from Stone. I will be buying/trading for this again."
"The nose on the beer is filled with centennial hops and some fruitiness. The nose is quite pleasant. The colour of the beer is golden/light copper colour The beer come across as quite bitter with some notes of alcohol at the end, but there is a strong citrus flavour in the background. The beer is incredibly balanced even with the huge bitterness. The pale malts of the beer come through slightly, but there isn't much there. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, so it fits well. The beer is probably the most drinkable IIPA, I've ever had. It's so smooth and subtle, but complex. Great tasting ale, but it needs more hop complexities. It's an all centennial beer, so it tastes great, but it's just lacking a bit of punch in the hop department (I know it sound weird to say that for an IIPA, but I like the complexity of mixed hops!)"
"Pours a yellow-orange with a nice thick head with good lacing down the glass. There is a very sweet grapefruit/citrus zest and pine aroma. Tastes like grapefruit juice up front and pine in the finish. There is an alcohol taste and warmth also in the finish with a bitterness that lingers on and on. Very good flavor, but a little strong and can be overwhelming."
"I love this beer, it is much more bitter and hoppy than you would expect from an average IPA, but perfect for a Stone IPA. This beer lives up to what the brewery is doing. I love drinking one on a nice cool afternoon after a long week of work."
"drinkability just way to intense to have more than one"
"D--I didn't even want to finish my bomber of this. It was easy to drink, but I had no interest in it and eventually I just stopped caring."
" D- A very drinkable ale that I usually reserve for celebrations as it's a bit pricey, at least it is in our area."
"This beer is not In the league of Bell's Hopslam, Victory's Hop Devil, or Hebrew's RIPA. Ruination just doesn't compare. To me, it tastes like an amateur's attempt at a double IPA who had a small budget and wanted to get the highest IBUs as possible. I feel like Stone's only goal was to create a brew with a high IBU count. They seemed to skimp on the aromatic hop selection and completely avoid a malty support as if to trick the drinker into focusing on the bitterness. This beer lacks the complexity and balance that I like to have in a double IPA."
"D: Another winner from Stone. How is it that such an uncompromising hop assault is almost sessionably drinkable? I wouldn't turn down a 90 Minute or a Hopslam for one, but that's no knock against it. If you're jonesing for hops, look no further."
"D - If face-numbing bitterness is your thing, I guess you could drink it all night long. For me, I enjoyed a bomber, but that was plenty. This beer is something of a legend & it's worth a try for that if nothing else. But I'd had other DIPAs that I liked a lot more."
"D-Even a bit long in the tooth this brew still deserves respect. While the hops dont pop quite like they do when fresh the balance simply shifts to the malt side. Still plenty of hops....just not as bright as they use to be. I surely will not have any trouble finishing this bomber on my own."
"Amber color, nice cakey head. Very fruity smell that mimics the taste. Strong ester that tastes a bit like berries, completely hidden alcohol, good balance with the malts. The malts don't really stand out much but the bitter hops aren't really overpowering. A nice beer for a meal, alone, or whenever."
"Good drinkability. This beer has a great flavor, and while there is an assertive hop flavor, it is not overdone by any means. This is truly one of my favorite beers."
"drinkability: classic IPA, perfect, but still like HopDevil as my #1"
"D. Very drinkable, not balanced as the hops dominate, but not too bitter for my taste buds. A top notch DIPA"
"3.5 D: Lack of complexity from malts makes this hopbomb less drinkable."
"D: The head needed a somewhat aggressive pour to create. Could have used a bit more citrus to balance out the heavy floral/perfumey flavors. Overall a good DIPA, but nothing overwhelming."
"Poured dark amber color with a large rocky off-white frothy head that lasted the majority of the beer. Aroma was a heavy citrus hoppy. Flavor was moderate bitter with a bittersweet finish of long duration. Medium to full body with a oily texture and soft carbonation. Moderate alcohol bite at the finish. Very good brew."
"Notes: Stone has been my favorite overall brewery for some time now. I keep thinking that I just need to experience more breweries out there, and I won't be one of those cliche Stone guys. But they keep me coming back and never ever ever disappoint. Guess I am one of those guys, and proud of it."
"This is my first official review, so please bear with me. It poured a beautiful golden, wheat color with a nice two-finger head which eventually led to some absolutely stunning lacing. The smell was mostly hops, I sensed much a lot of pine, but also some nice citrus. I was so excited when I got my hands on this beer that I pretty much completely forgot to note the mouthfeel, but the overall experience was great and I remember a kind of thickness that I really enjoyed. The hops were almost overwhelming right off the bat and the bitterness that they brought hung around almost indefinitely. There was citrus followed by a nice malty afterglow. This is a beer that deserves to be enjoyed sip by sip; absolutely delicious. I'm sure I will be coming back to this beer in the future. In other news, I find the curvy brown bottles that Rogue, Stone, and some other West Coast breweries use is the sexiest bottle out there. It's curvacious, just like a good woman should be. Also, I find Stone's paragraph long descriptions/rants to be incredibly witty, arrogant and appealing. Great experience, great beer!"
"On-tap at Woody's City Market, served in a standard pint glass a nice crisp orange with beautiful frothy head. Aroma is crisp citrus hops and some sweet malts. The taste is wonderful balance of citrus hops and sweet malts in the initial that quickly turns over to loads of hops in the finish. The beer is medium bodied with nice smooth carbonation. This has been one of my favorite Double IPAs, and it certainly doesn't miss on draft."
"D - I had a bomber, and it went straight to my head. Yeah, I wanted much more, it was very drinkable."
"Incredible delivery and potent hoppy flavors make for a slightly unbalanced, yet VERY enjoyable beer. The flavors are VERY defined, and if you don't enjoy that style, this will be your worst enemy. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the intense finish that almost demands slow consumption."
"D = Found this to be a chore to drink. Not much alcohol taste, but the bitterness controls this brew."
"D: You're either ready for this one or you aren't. It's certainly a palate-wrecker, but can be quite quenching on occasion. If you're prepared for this beer, it's a world class hopped-to-hell IPA. If not, you may be overtaken by your glass."
"Final Thoughts - One of the best brews I have had. Price is the only thing holding me back from drinking this one again and again. Definitely worth the money though. Grab a bottle and find out what its like."
"The balance of this one is just off. It smells awesome, but the first taste is not much. Then it follows pretty heavy on the hops, but it lingers a little too much. A nice DIPA, but just not my fav."
"Great."
"Poured straight from the source at Stone brewery...A nice medium orange and slightly hazy color with a perfect head and nice lacing. The smell was nice and citrusy...what you would expect from a west coast IPA. Hops up front with a well paired sweetness is what I got from the taste. For an IPA like this with a little more alcohol content, it hides it very well. Outstanding IPA from an outstanding establishment"
"D- Drinkability is excellent and easy to have many. Be carefull high alcohol content!!"
"Ruination pours a cloudy copper with a 1-finger yellowish white head. The head sticks around throughout. Moderate lacing. The smell is not real strong but citrus & pine are apparent. The taste is very strong of herbal/bitter citrus hops, lemon & some toasty malts. Bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp, carbonated. Drinkable beer but very bitter & alcohol can sneak up on you."
"D: For the bitterness and style it's quite drinkable. The alcohol is fairly low for a DIPA and doesn't come out at all in the drink. This is a great beer from Stone pick it up."
"PS. It is one of the coolest bottles, I love the etched gargoyle."
"A quality beer, lovingly produced -- but I can't see myself buying this one again."
"Overall - You have to practice to like this one. It is definitely an aquired taste that I must have aquired somewhere along the line."
"Well I can't complain about the bitterness, it ment to be this hoppy and it's brewed very well. I'll enjoyed it once in a while, but it is not an everyday beer for sure."
"D- This is a nice hop bomb, but just seems simple to me. I think Surly Furious has quite a bit more to offer than this."
"I def. can drink this beer as much as I can afford it. It is probably one of my favorites beers altogether and certainly one of my favorite IPAs. I would give it all 5s but I figured I'd save that for the rare occasion I might find something I like more. An excellent beer overall."
"A standout among extreme beers with extreme hop character for its simultaneous harshness and its subtle charms."
"Overall: A very solid Imperial IPA, good citrus character, clean, crisp mouthfeel, and good overall drinking experience. A clear standout; recommended."
"D - I don't like DIPAs. To me, anyone can make an exceptionally hoppy beer. Plus, all DIPAs end up tasting the same. there's really no variety among them."
"D: a one word summary: marvelous. Simply marvelous, I extremely admire this Double IPA and stone brewery for their great stuff...not for the hop weakling"
"Stone often seems to indimidate with thier beers but this is refreshing and highly drinkable."
"This is very drinkable."
"I can drink this all day and night. Admittedly I am a hop-head and this is by far my favorite IPA. This isn't distributed in Illinois and I have to go out of my way to get it, but won't ever pass on the opportunity to do so. Which reminds me, this was my last one..."
"D - I couldn't drink much of this. It's good, but i'd die from elevated acid level in my veins."
"This beer is quite drinkable and has a pleasant, if slightly dry mouthfeel to it. I really enjoyed trying this dipa, however I do not mourn that it is not available at liquor stores in Minnesota. There are plenty of comparable midwestern dipas that can proudly stand next to a ruination."
"I've been dying to try this one since I've heard nothing but really good things about it. Poured into a tulip pint glass it poured a light copper, light amber, almost hazy orange color with a small head but left some lacing down the glass. The smell is hoppy as expected. The taste is wonderful. Hoppy, bitter, a little sweet with a great mouthfeel and the alcohol is pretty well covered up. I'm loving this beer. I could drink it all day. This is a beer I'm going to definitely pick up again and would go out of my way to get. Stone did a great job on this brew as with the others I've had from them."
"As long as you aren't afraid of hops, this is a tasty, easy to drink, beer."
"Fairly clear golden body under one finger head with fairly substantial lacing. The Hop Atomic Bomb. While other IPAs may have higher IBUs (though I seriously doubt there are many), this is one way hoppy beer, a very upfront assault on the tastebuds, akin to getting hit over the head with a baseball bat. Yeow!! Hops, hops, and more hops, with a bit of piney notes on the backend, and a lingering malty finish. I'd hope to give a more informed judgment on mouthfeel, but my palate is destroyed for the rest of the evening. Not for the faint of heart and not a session beer, and certainly not an entry brew for the category, but one of the best examples of SoCal DIPAs, IMHO."
"Overall, a great DIPA. Best smelling beer I've ever experienced. Definitely recommend this one!"
"Pours a pale yellow colored body, with an off-white colored head, smallish. Grapefruit sweet aroma. Some pine. Sugary sweet aroma. Grapefruity, malty, sweet, some pine. Pretty balanced. A good pale ale/IPA. More sweet than hoppy."
"this is a very highly drinkable DIPA. the first time i had this was alone in a hotel room 2 years ago, and from then i was hooked. even though i find this to be a bit more mild these days, i still have mad love for ruination."
"Very impressive, the stand by for hop showcasing."
"it pours a golden/orange color with a good head and good lacing.. then just average after that.. smell is ok but nothing that tells you that you are about to drink a top rated DIPA?? taste is bitter with good hop flavor and ok floral citrus smells ...taste is bitter first and i like bitter ipas but again this was nothing to write home about.. the mouthfeel was hop/bitter forward and floral/malt finish good and drinkable..it was smooth easy to drink i dont rate this as a DIPA its just a high ibu ipa with 7.7 abv its good and should be tried ....but it is overated its a B at best. like i said before this is not a DIPA just a good IPA.. try founders double trouble or bells hopslam to see what a great DIPA should be. still try this one and i will buy just singles of this one."
"Well I was far from disappointed, but it did not hit me as hard as I expected. It poured a nice brown with a slight off-white head. The aroma was mostly hops but an almost roasted hickory smell was also present. Drinking this was great it is very complex with citrus and hops and much bitterness, in the best possible way. And the bitterness was calm and smooth, if you can believe. The hops just slowly blanketed my tongue and made it feel like home."
"Hop Head Mania. Pours great with just the right head, ring stays around for awhile. Ruination has the color of honey in the glass when held up to the sunlight. Very nice color. Smells almost like a paper bag full of hops with a slight scent of malt over the top. Hoppy taste, hoppy taste. Hoppy at the beginning on the front of the tounge and at the back of the tounge. Slight malty in the mid range of the sip finished by the hops again. Grapefruity. Beautiful."
"i'm only disappointed in the fact i bought a single sample bottle, not a 6-pack. thanks Stone Brewing for keeping the Craft impulse everpresent. how about send some Self-Righteous over to the east coast...i haven't seen it yet!"
"Purchased at Green's in Atlanta. Beer has a cool bottle and pours a little darker than a Miller High Life. Smells pretty good with a lot of hoppy aroma. After tasting, I must say that this one does not live up to the hype. It's hoppy and all but that's about it. Maybe one-dimensional is the best way to describe it. This beer has a sweet side to it but the malts don't seem to play a role in the sweetness. Almost like there is some type of """artificial""" sweetness involved here. This seems strange to me and this is the reason I'm ranking this a little low. Somewhat overrated."
"Overall Far above average, fairly easy to drink too. I will get again. YUM."
"Such a great beer. Deserves to be the in the upper echelon of DIPAs. Need to revisit this guy more often."
"Really great tasting beer...big hops flavor but not much balance and not too complex. If you are really into hops this is worth a try. It's one sided with hops headed right into alcohol. Despite its lack of complexity I really like this one and would do it again...and again."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. It is my first time having it and I'm quite impressed. I don't quite think it is at the caliber of Hopslam, but it is very good and I will keep my eyes open for it in the future. It does not overwhelm and prevent future enjoyment in the evening, which makes it even more drinkable to me."
"D 4.5 - Excellent for a double IPA, almost sessionable but intensity and ABV could ruin you if you are not careful!"
"Verdict: Ruination is simply a massive beer. Stone have pulled off something masterful here, by keeping a beer so absolutely drenched in hop oil somewhat balanced. This is a must try for all hopheads."
"Fist off... Coolest bottle ever. Not cuz of the image so much as the fact that it's painted/ink screened(?) on.. Pour is good but in some ways nothing extraordinary. It sort of looks just like Sam Adams lager or such.. The aroma is AMAZING- I'm not a huge hop fan but this is the sweetest hop aroma I've ever smelled. Flavor is interesting, not just like other hop bombs, this has a smooth balance. Hoppiness isn't biting up front, it's strong but mellow. Has an earthy base with some hint of malt which keeps it's crisp. Mouth is nice. Sort of full, definitely not thin. The aftertaste is pleasant and not overwhelmingly bitter. This certainly lives up to it's A status.. Very enjoyable for hop heads and those who aren't."
"I can't believe I've gone this long without. Must have been the $16 per sixer price tag. Definitely one of the best DIPAs out there."
"Brew poured to a cloudy yellow to orange color with a thick off white head that had good retention and left thick lacing along the sides of the glass. From the pour you could clearly notice the heavy amounts of hops that have been used in this brew. That aroma brings forth noticeable pine scent with a slight citrus mix. While this aroma was expected I was expecting it to actually be more pungent as it is labeled as over 100 IBUs. With this being said the hops is all I could pick up. The flavor is about the hops as well, though I feel that it is more like a grapefruit flavor. You do notice a unbalance malt flavor, that mixed together seem to give a slight sweet flavor. As I said the hops are very pungent and the hop resin like favor just sticks to the back of the tongue/mouth. Though this brew weighs in at 7.7% the alcohol does not come out. Nice brew, I am not a big hop head but once in a while they work for me. This one worked and is one I would get again."
"D - Take the description on the back of the bottle seriously; if you are not the kind of perverse hop head who enjoys masochistically high levels of astringent hop bitterness then this beer isn't for you. I found the aroma a bit weak and one dimensional, and the flavor more so. I hoped for more flavor and aroma emphasis, but sadly, this was the kind of flat, bitterness oriented IPA that I don't care for. Drinking this was kind of like sucking on a grapefruit filled with juniper berries, and while I do enjoy both grapefruit and gin (often together), that is not the experience I am looking for in a beer, even an IPA."
"Notes - A hop bomb that did indeed ruin my palate for a while, but it'll recover, and be better for the experience. Bitterness."
"Overall this is a good beer and I would recommend to anyone who loves a great IPA beer. I had hoped my first bottle taste and the loosing of the flavors half way threw it was the cause of food I was eating previously, but later on in the week tried it again and had a repeat result."
"O- A delicious beer. This fills my hop requirement for the next month or so. While it's unbalanced, that doesn't really bother me. If you're going to make a hoppy as hell IPA then make it hoppy as hell. So good job Stone."
"PS: Reviewed from notes on 2/12/09, I still have the hoppy goodness in my mouth 2 hours after finishing this beer. What an experience!"
"Drinkability- After having the Hopslam and Double Simcoe recently, (both at around 10%) this one is much easier to throw down. Great offering."
"Poured a hazy golden color with a pillowy head and showed massive lacing down the glass. The smell was of huge hops; grapefruit, grass, pine, citrus. The taste up front was very floral and of citrus, with huge hop bitterness on the back of the tongue and down the throat. This is very delicious in every way, a hop lover's dream. Mouthfeel was good, very lively carbonation embraces the entire mouth. Drinkability IMO is high, despite the 7.5% ABV, it just tastes so darn great."
"Great drinkablity considering the amount of hops in this thing."
"D= this one will definitely ruin the ol taste buds. well deserving of the name and a very good beer. somewhat of a sipper though so I'm gonna have to take some points off for the drinkability."
"drinkability: this is a nice drinker at 7.7%. by the """100+ IBU's""" and the """immediate ruinous effect on your palate""" i was expecting this to a a kick you in the face hop. instead it's a very nice brew that i would definitely revisit."
"Drinkability: A classic. This is an intense brew, bitter yet flavorful, surprisingly low in alcohol for the style (7.7% is nothing to sneeze at, but when DIPAs regularly clock in at double-digits, this one's refreshing), attractive, and crisp. A go-to for hop heads and rightfully so. If you haven't try it, do so. If you have, well, try it again."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Pours a light brown/goldenish color with a thick white head with great lacing throughout. Aroma is somewhat fruity very hoppy with pine as well. Taste is hoppy and malt with a balance of pine blended in. Mouthfeel is really close to that of a barleywine. This beer is awesome, Stone never dissappoints."
"Overall, this beer is absolutely incredible. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I drank Ruination IPA around 10:30 PM, brushed my teeth later that night, and still had this flavor on my tongue the next morning. INCREDIBLE."
"Simply put, amazing. An IPA which doesn't forget about the barley. A smooth rich barley taste hits your mouth followed immediately by a perfect hop finish. The barley seems to deliver the hops to your taste buds. Expensive, $14.99/six pack at BevMo near San Francisco or about $5.00/22oz bottle...but definitely worth every penny."
"Classic DIPA nose, full of pine, tropical fruit. It's something that all of Stone's beers have in common. The taste is wonderful, with a big blast of hops at the end -- much like Stone says with Arrogant Bastard, I'm not worthy. This is the one beer that is a constant in my fridge, and easily one of my all-time favorites."
"From a bottle with an enjoy by date 4/07/09 so it must be fairly fresh. Pours clear amber with a fat one finger cream color head. Moderate amount of lacings. Aroma is piney resinous hops. Taste is orange grapefruit resinous hops with a surprisingly rich caramel malt partner. The mouthfeel gets fairly close to a barley wine but the taste remains in the IIPA realm. It has a pine needle dry bitter finish. Overall a fine beer. One that I would highly recommend."
"all in all, a fairly solid brew. All it's cracked up to be. An excellent example of a west-coast DIPA with that characteristic hop profile Stone loves so much. Frighteningly drinkable with an abv that stays hidden through the whole ordeal. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Reviewed on: 01-27-2008 15:16:23"
"thank god this beer is released year round. its the beer i have been expecting from all the hype surronding stone."
"D- If you love hops then this is a very drinkable beer. It is reasonably priced compared to most DIPA's. Just another favorite of mine brewed by Stone"
"One of the best IPAs out there, hands down. The amazing hop flavors and smells and the lighter body (for the style) make it incredibly drinkable. Second only to Pliny in my book."
"Drinkability-- Decently drinkable though im still gettin use to hops this strong its one i would look forward to trying again."
"an awesome DIPA, can barely taste the extra alcohol.... awesome a great beer"
"Recommended indeed!"
"Could I drink more than one? Yes, well, maybe that is not up to me."
"The best thing about this beer is its smell. It smells truly wonderful. A easy showoff allowing bystanders to take a sniff and they're sold."
"Drinkability - Good, though maybe I'd just have one bomber and after drinking a beer like this, you really can't switch to something else and taste it correctly."
"Overall this beer amazed me. So much so I needed to change my review. This must have been uber fresh as the citrus nose and flavor was just popping! Wow, newfound respect for Ruination. Awesome."
"This bomber was down and out pretty quick. The 7.7% is extremely well hidden and creeps into your brain soon after finishing the last sip."
"Drinkability: A more balanced IPA than most. The namesake doesn't lie, as this beer will destroy your palate - the malt sweetness is needed in the background to counteract the intense hops. Definitely a sipper, and enjoyable. It's different than most IPAs I've had, as there's barely any citrus character."
"This is probably the fourth one of these I've had, and i find it to be very easy to drink the entire bomber, and maybe even more. Strong flavors, unsurprisingly, but not unbearable, and definitely one that I will continue to drink."
"Another winner by Stone. You just really can't go wrong when you pick up a Stone beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit fluffy, lush, bit light, which helps this one on the drinkability scale. Yum."
"I could drink 2 or 3 of these in a sitting!"
"Everything promised by the still amusing and enjoyably overwrought labeling is delivered, so I cannot, in good faith here, fault truth in advertising. As I fancy myself a connoisseur (hah!) of the style, it did indeed take an acclimatizing first few sips, before this went down as nice and smooth as it was meant to, soon disappearing way too quickly, for my liking and my needs.  Woe upon me for only having the one bottle at my disposal."
"D - I can't believe it took me this long to have one of these...I'm absolutely in love with this beer! I'm going to have to go down to the regular IPA and try that...but I suggest this beer to any hop head out there"
"Drinkability. Most DIPAs I can put away one after another appreciating the hops, but also the sweetness balanced with it. This is not a balanced brew. And, for all those extreme hop heads who love their fix, this is certainly one to examine. For my tastes however, it was just a bit too much. Something about seemed... artificial. I really had to search out those other flavors besides piney, resiny, almost sickly overwhelming hops. I don't think I'll be grabbing for this one any time soon."
"D- very easy to finish this one. I wish it was sold here. The not overly high ABV and awesome hoppy taste make this one something id love to have a couple of. Recommended."
"Cloudy blonde ale with a luscious creamy white foamy head. Huge upfront floral aroma. Smells like a boat load of Cascade hops. Taste overloaded with hops. Could use a little more balance due to the high hop profile. The 7.7 % ABV seems a little too subdued for the amount of hops used. A true hop bomb! I do love the mouthfeel as I usually do with high alpha beers. I'm sorry, did I mention the high hop profile in this beer?"
"Definitely in my top three favorite IPAs, slightly beating out Dogfish Head 90min. and just under my all-time fav, The Alchemist's Heady Topper."
"From a 22oz. bottle purchased locally into a Willi Becher style pint glass. Aroma explodes with grapefruit, tangerine and pineapple hop aroma. Thick and resiny. A clear deep gold color with a big off-white head that laces well. Flavor is more hops, pine, citrus and pineapple followed by toast from the malt, then washed away by the hop bitterness. A touch of sweetness, but just barely. Finish is dry and bitter, clinging to the tongue. An awesome double IPA."
"Overall, this is a solid brew. To me it seems more along the lines of an IPA, similar to Bell's Two Hearted. This is nothing like Dogfish head 90 minute ipa or hopslam, but it is still a good beer I would recommend because it is very easy to drink."
"D - Heck yes....if you could indeed find it here in Minnesota. Sign me up... The problem is where though. Great beer from an excellent brewery."
"D - A good IPA, another solid Stone beer, everytime I have one I get excited by the prospect of them being in NO"
"D- Very good, very drinkable beer. Very hoppy but not too bitter and, while there's an obvious presence of alcohol, it's not overpowering. Very well made beer."
"Really enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to having other Stone offerings."
"I could drink this all the time. I am thinking more often that West Coast DIPAs kick the asses of those from our end."
"While i loved this, i also love their regular IPA, and don't feel that this is too far above that. Their regular IPA has a great hop profile that is intensified in this brew, but that's not always necessary and for a couple extra bucks i can get a 6 pack of the regular stuff! A great job by the boys in Cali though, I would approach this again, and once again approach with caution."
"Very good DIPA. Ruination was one of the first beers to get me hooked on craft beer, and I still like it very much. It has a caramel sweet malty backbone that serves to bring out the hop profile beautifully. Having tried many other DIPAs now, I find that I'm more impressed with the maltiness than the hops. A lot of big IPAs have too little malt sweetness to realize their hop flavors fully. This beer does not suffer from this flaw. The caramel malt is strong and assertive and cuts out most of the hop bitterness, allowing the rich, oily grapefruit flavors of the hops to push to the forefront. I find the hop profile just a tad on the boring side at this point. Let me qualify that quite a bit. I love the hops in Ruination, however it tastes a lot like many San Diego DIPAs. Of course, this is most likely down to other breweries looking to Stone, rather than the other way round. That said, I find the hop profile dominated by bitter grapefruit, without a lot of pine, spruce or floral aspects like you get in some DIPAs. All that said, this is a minor point and it's still a delicious, very hoppy beer. The beer looks pretty great, although after seeing some of the gigantic DIPAs with heads that are almost orange with hop oiliness, my standards are set unbearably high. The feel is very nice. It certainly doesn't """ruin""" your palate as much as some overly aggressive DIPAs. I'm surprised at how close I now find Ruination and DFH 90 min, as that seems like an obvious comparison to make. Sure, Ruination has a bit more bitterness, and the hop profiles differ, but both beers have very rich malt characters as compared to many beers in this style. I wonder if their rich malt backbones at somewhat lower alcohol contents plays into their popularity. Now, I'm rambling and I'll wrap this thing up. Ruination is a great beer, and Stone is a great brewery."
"A warm draw washes down nicely leaving me thirsty enough for another taste, but hard to think of as anything more than a one drink beer. Destined to be one of my favorites!"
"D: pretty drinkable, but leaves you with some serious cottonmouth."
"Well, this beer came highly recommended and also suggested by my server at a nice restaurant to go with my main course. When my wife started reading the back of the bottle before I tasted it I already knew it was a poor choice, why would I want something that was going to """ruin""" my palate with a nice dinner? The pine and citrus scents that are referred to by other reviewers just hit me as a insect repellent / citronella and the taste was no better. Not only did it taste bad, but it made my dinner taste worse, I will not be drinking this one again."
"D: Pretty drinkable, especially with the hops leaving you with a dry palate that beckons you drink more."
"Bright amber-red color with plenty of cloudiness to deepen it, good froth with some lacing, hard to see any bubbles. Mixed citrus gives the nose a zesty character, oatmeal, leans heavily on the hops, oily pine and tea leaf, too dense to parse out much else. Medium-bodied with again the kind of density which makes it appear heavier than it is. Some malty softness on the attack but, like duh, it's the hops which run the show. The grapefruit, lemon, orange citrus does slightly sweeten things. Weight and density consistent to finish. Subtle floral notes. Very good beer that I could not drink very frequently."
"Very impressive. Yeah, Stone is all about the hops, and smashing you over the head with them, but the malt profile is damn tasty, a perfect match for the hops. An outstanding beer, and one I will most certainly seek out again."
"Notes: Well, it definitely isn't Stone IPA, but it isn't far off. This breew seems lazy to me...just brew the regular IPA and add more hops. That doesn't make it bad, or boring, just unoriginal.I love Stone's IPA, so this can't possibly be a negative review, I'm simply expressing dissapointment that I didn't sample a significantly different beer; it certainly didn't ruin my palate. Stone delivers tons of macho marketing hype, but they brew incredibly balanced big beers."
"Sweet apricot and orange malt with cappuccino cream. Nice long flaovor that builds and then setlles into a long hoppy finish. Very -- almost too --- dry at the end....made me a little thirsty!"
"An average pour from the bottle yielded more than two fingers of pillowy-white head on top of a good-looking, orangey-golden beer. Not surprisingly, hop aromas, particularly of the floral and pine variety, are present, though not overpowering. Ruination's taste is by no means unique among IPAs, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The herbal, flowery hop notes come through head-on, with a little of the alcohol joining in toward the finish. Despite the intense hopping, I found this beer to be less bitter than expected; the finish even seemed slightly sweet. In addition to a pleasant finish, Ruination was creamy in the mouthfeel, and just generally drinkable."
"Doesn't leave a dry pallet.. actually doesn't taste nearly as strong as it says... very easy to drink... and really goes right to the brain! Not bad! Not my favorite IPA either.."
"I was quite suprised by this beer. It pours with a bright golden color and has just the right head. The smells and aromas of this beer are awsome if you like the smell of hops. It reminds me of when I cut open a bag of hops for homebrewing. It has good drinkability the hop bitterness is not so overwhelming as you might think. Ballance was very well achived for such a strongly hoped beer. Although I personally would not tip back a number of these in a row, I find it a good beer to enjoy on occasion."
"This isn't something I'd care to session. While not as over the top as some of Stone's beers, it's still a little hop heavy for my taste. I'm sure there's a market out there for it though."
"Overall: Overall this beer appeals to the hopheads only. For the style of beer(Imperial IPA) it is a great beer. It fits the style quite well. I see why they call it Ruination because it completely ruined my palate."
"This and their regular IPA have sold me on IPAs (not to mention their Belgain IPA). Was starting to turn around and with the help of Boulevard. A trip out to Colorado helped me really appreciate this style."
"Overall: An astringent chalky mouth feel, with a bitter finish that last on the palate. The IPA is well built and is very nice to enjoy. I don't usually like IPAs but this one is an exception. I like the way it was make and I like Stone brewery. The only thing I can think of is try to bring the maltiness forward a bit."
"This is a great beer, maybe my favorite DIPA, I could drink a couple of these a night, but I probably shouldn't do too many of them. The alcohol is why, not the hops."
"D- Excellent Imperial IPA. I would say I like the regular Stone IPA better, however. This one is a little heavier than the regular Stone IPA, which makes it a little less drinkable in my opinion. Would prefer just drinking about 3 of these as opposed to an entire 6 pack in one sitting. Highly recommended if you are a big hop fan."
"If I rank this beer on the hoppiness scale I would have to say that very few beers can beat it. The beer is designed to shock the taste buds with so much hop flavor and bitter bite that the carbonation is almost an after thought. I love this beer. I am a true hophead and this beer is not for the faint of heart. Lift up your glass and sip it down."
"All and all, a great IPA from a great Brewery."
"D - I could drink a terrifying number of these beers. They could truly be my ruination."
"Mad respectable as an annihilating hopfix. Makes up for all the other little pissy beers you've ever had to drink. Will probably give one of these to my son on his 21st birthday (or 18th). Teach a man to fish..."
"It was so crisp and intense on the palate it's hard to describe. Went down so well and so smooth. If you've never had this beauty on tap before, do not pass up the opportunity if one surfaces."
"This beer doesn't do anything for me and pales in comparison to the king of IIPA's, DFH 90 minute."
"D: If this weren't 7.7% ABV (and also expensive), I could be happy only drinking this beer. And I'd drink many of them every day. It goes down very easily, especially considering how bitter it is."
"Good mouthfeel, but the dry bitterness makes very drinkable."
"This is my favorite IPA, rich with Hops and heavy on the palate, but very enjoyable once you develop your taste for IPA's! Stone brews are all similar in their high alcohol percentage but still very enjoyable for the micro-brew connoisseur. There short story's on the back of all their brews are enjoyable to read as well and I find Ruination's to be true, the part about not being able to enjoy lesser brews after developing a favorable taste to the double IPA! Great Brew! and cheers to all the Hop Heads!"
"I don't like to claim I have a favorite beer because there are beers for every occasion. This beer is definitely one of my tops though. I can enjoy this beer any time."
"overall great beer with great availibilty.."
"Notes: I love Stone beers! They are always incredibly full-flavored, bold, robust, and full of that signature character they always bring to the table. Ruination is no exception. To tell you the truth, it reminds me a bit of Hop Wallop. But, this blows it out of the water as far as I'm concerned. I think Ruination is, obviously, hop-forward in the taste, but does a great job of staying somewhat balanced and never crosses the line into the territory of being overwhelming. One of my favorites for sure! Highly recommended"
"What a delight. The bitterness of this brew is what really makes it great. There is not too much sweety maltness going on, at least that I can taste, compared to some other double IPAs. That said, I did not taste any exceptional flavors or oils from the hops, but the ones I noticed were very good."
"Hazy yellowy orange color and a smallish cloudy white head. The smell of hops is insanely huge with hops and the flavor hits you with an equally insane hop feel and hints of fruit, mainly orange and pineapple. Extremely tasty brew, and it just might ruin you."
"D- A slow drinker, overall solid but not as good as others from Stone."
"D - If I had another I would drink it. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Bottle. Pours amber, smells citrus and piney. Intense hoppiness does ruin the palate just as promised once consumed. It was almost spicy because of all the hops, definitely unlike any other DIPA I've ever had. I wouldn't say it was a bad beer, I just felt it didn't necessarily live up to the hype and I found it to be kind of one note. Not really a bad brew, just not anything I'll be drinking again anytime soon."
"D - With a low abv for a DIPA and a good clean taste I could drink a coupld 22ozs with no problem."
"I am not a hophead by any means but this is ok."
"D: The lower ABV and lightness of this beer make it a very easy brew to throw back. It is a nice, clean and refreshing. Love the freshness of the hops. If you are looking to OD on hops, look no further. I have to admit that this is going to go pretty high up on my list of DIPA's."
"Taste: Like biting into a big juicy grapefruit, devouring peel and all. Very delicious, but not as bitter as I thought it would be."
"Scott"
"Light honey blonde with a fat pillow of head that lasts for several minutes after the pour. Leaves a ton of resinous lace all down the glass. Smells like fresh potent hops, piney and citrusy with a dollop of fresh bready yeastiness. Taste is very balanced between big hops and a smooth malty character very tasty but not really overly bitter for being supposedly over 100 IBUs, seems less bitter than the regular stone IPA to me. Good heavy smooth mouthfeel with a kind of dry salty finish, alcohol is well hidden. Dangerously drinkable."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/4)"
"(rated Jan 17, 2007)"
"Very drinkable until the very end (and that may be because I drank too slow.) As I said earlier, this beer may be a gateway drug into the illicit world of IPA's."
"It has a great feel in the mouth, not strong or biting as some Double IPAs can get. If finishes well and I easy finished the bottle by myself (my wife hates all hoppy beers except for anything from Dogfish...weird)"
"D- Lovely beer! Aggresive hop profile that progress nicely from sweet and floral to citrusy and piney to spicey and bitter. I loved this a lot! I could easily kill a 6 pack in one sitting. I hope to be able to find this very often! Cheers!"
"D: I'll be honest, I've spent so much time drinking Pliny that this just doesn't do it for me anymore. It's balls to the wall hops, without a lot of refinement or balance (two things that I feel Pliny does very well). I'd buy this once in a while, but as far as DIPAs go, it's not at the top of my list."
"D: It is awfully strong but I think three of these over cards of ultra spicy snacks is called for. But a whole sixer may take your taste buds on a field trip that will take a while to recover from."
"D- can easily get through a 6 pack of these and would more often if they werent so damn expensive. they go down easy and leave you feeling good. had to take off .5 of a point for the price as it is a beer that you want to savor, and as such, you only want to drink one or two a night."
"Incredible Double IPA. Pours hazy orange-gold with a thick white head. Impressive lacing all the way to the bottom. Huge, massive, colossal hop aroma. Resin, resin, grapefruit, celery, and resin. Taste was immense. Resiny goodness coated evertthing from the white and pink grapefruit to the caramel cookie dough malt. No biscuits, either. I actually like this more than AleSmith's Yule Smith. The taste is stronger, hoppier, and far more bitter. If you do not like IPA's, you will truly hate this beer."
"Notes: I had no reason to be intimidated and neither should you. Maybe some day I will develop a taste for hops and then this beer will be right up there to represent one of the best hoppy beers, indeed a """poem to the hops.""""
"Good off-white head, good retention, cloudy yellow amber color. hoppy sweet aroma. Initial hoppy rush followed by a sweet finish and slightly bitter after taste mouth tingles. slight foral taste and smell. light-medium body."
"Good warming booziness with a nice bitter slap in the finish. Ruination is the shit, get yourself some."
"D - This is one of those intermediate beers that could get you into trouble. It's 7.7% so it won't get to you too fast but once the buzz begins this stuff goes down as easy as any other. Happy drinking!"
"This is really not bad. I am not a big fan of the style to say the least. The best attribute is that the bitterness does not overpower. Though the individual hop flavors are not that pronounced IMO."
"I've been waiting to break into this one for a while. It poured slightly hazy dark orange amber with a full sticky off white head that settled into nice lacing after about 5 minutes. As it warms a bit, I detect a very nice orange and citrus aroma with a significant backbone of caramelized sugars and pungent juicy hoppyness. It tastes like hop nectar. Medium to full bodied, slightly syrupy, with sharp hop bitterness. I would call it medium sweet with a medium finish. The hops definitely dominate, but the rest of the brew has not fallen to the wayside. It's not completely dry like so many IPA's, but a delicious bold brew for sure! I give it a high drinkability score for hop and IPA fans."
"D- This brew goes down easy, very drinkable. Though at 7.7% ABV I suspect that these would sneak up on you, pleasantly..."
"I found this to have a great mouth feel, very smooth and refreshing. Just a great beer all around, although at $16 for a six pack this is not exactly a good session beer, yet it IS very drinkable."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into an Imperial Pint. The color is great, it is a cloudy light golden color. There is a nice creamy small white head the builds and quickly resides. Nice lacing. The smell is of course hops. I also get a ton of grapfruit some sugar and a very nice pine aroma. Just all around nice and earthy. Oh the taste! Hops all the way and I love it. The bite is great and I was shocked at how moist it left the mouth. The Runination is very Drinkable for an IPA, I wish I had another to have tomorrow. Recommended for all, especially IPA fans."
"This stuff is great, VERY pricey, but worth it. If you have never had a beer with a lot of hops, this ain't the place to start, but if you like pale ale's find this and try it. I remember when I was in high school and thought I hated hops, couldn't stand the bitter taste, now I can't get enough! GIVE ME MORE!"
"I picked up a 22oz'er. Poured this into my unofficial offical IPA glass (a Guinness pint glass). Pours a light golden color. Moderate head that fades quickly. Nice lacing on the glass. It has a nicely balanced smell of hops, pine and fruit. Not real overpowering and well balanced. As with the aroma, the taste is very well balanced. They didn't just dump a pile of hops into this. The hops and pine complement each other nicely, and a real nice bitterness follows (makes me wonder what the IBU is). For an IPA, it's light bodied and is real easy to drink. It leaves some stick in the mouth, and the bitterness almost has me rubbing my teeth. This a real good IPA and a very enjoyable drink. The Stone Brewery is new to me and I have been very impressed so far."
"Full bodied. Another great big beer from the brewers at Stone. Thank folks. Thank the Lord Jesus for the hop harvest."
"Unbelievably hoppy. Strong grassy, herby smell. Excellent, mouth-wetting aroma. One of the best noses I've tried. One of the better imperial IPAs I've tried. Doesn't quite compare to the Dogfish head 90 minute or Lagunitas Maximus, despite the higher IBU count. DFH/Maximus both have more of a fruity, complex, complete taste. For true hopheads, this beer can't be ignored."
"I'd like to try this side by side with the regular Stone IPA to see what the difference is, because from memory they don't seem too different. I like this. Wish it had a little more sweetness that I prefer."
"Pours a very nice orange haze. Very white head, little to no carbonation. Smells fantastic, a pine forest crossed with a pineapple plantation type smell. Tastes is dominated by a burning flavor of hops. No surprises there, this punches you in the face with its hops as much as anything I've ever had. I don't know about the bottles claim that other beers will be ruined for you permanently, but maybe other beers will be ruined for you that night. It would be hard to get the taste of this beast out of your mouth. Highly recommended."
"Overall - An excellent and very well balanced DIPA... recommended..."
"This is a perfect beer for hopheads. It pours a nice orange amber color with a thick foamy off-white head. Aroma is dominated by bitter earthy and citrus hops. Very bitter hoppy flavor that lasts throughout with a perfect malt backbone balance. It is like biting into a plant. One of the bet IPAs(or any other beer) I've ever had."
"Drinkability: is there really any other beer you would want to have after drinking this? Honestly I wouldn't recommend having more than two in one sitting (I prefer to have one followed by a beer with specialized flavor like a Pecan Ale--really brings out the taste to me for some reason)"
"D - Alcohol is well hidden, and this is a delicious beer."
"drinkability: very powerful, but not heavy. very enjoyable beer that i would have again."
"D: I have to be in just the right mood for a beer like this. I like my hops, but this beer is almost too much for me. That said, this beer is excellent at doing what it's designed for. Definitely worth a revisit when the mood is right."
"D- Wonderful IPA."
"Fairly smoothe brew, goes down easy. Drinkable, if it is to your taste. As one who is generally not a fan of IPAs, I probably wouldn't go get another one, but as IPAs go, it's pretty good. My best friend really likes it (she likes hops), and I bet my dad would too."
"M/D: This is really an exceptional beer. Smooth, easy to drink, good carbonation, full-body, and creamy. Started with a bitter dry taste and end with a bitter aftertaste. Highly drinkable, the 22oz went down very smooth. This will be a staple for a long time to come."
"Drinkability: My favorite style of beer does not disappoint. This beer comes as advertised; full of hops, bitter and 7.7 ABV. I have another half bottle that will not last long. Would buy this any day...money permitting."
"This beer is very drinkable and I was surprised, considering I've heard some of my friends say this ale was just to bitter for them. I found this ale smooth and although a bit too high abv to have more than one or two in a night, I'd happily sit back and enjoy sipping this brew for some time to come."
"This is easily one of my top 5 DIPAs."
"12oz bottle from the liquor store in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours a light amber-yellow body with an impressive inch and a half of off-white head. Smells intensely hoppy, like few beers I've had - citrus and pine most notably, with just a tinge of caramel malt in the background. Smells like smelling a packet of hops when homebrewing. Tastes like orange, grapefruit, pine, pith... Just the slightest hint of caramel malt, just enough to balance the flavor and make the beer obnoxiously bitter. Medium in body with ample effervescent carbonation, both of which help aid the drinkability. One sip most definitely invites another. Perhaps the best DIPAs I have ever had. An absolute must for any hop-head."
"A hazy golden orange pour supports three fingers of light tan head. Retention is excellent, with a prolific amount of spotted lacing left behind. Aroma consists of striking citrusy hops up front with a bit of astringency in the background. Notes of earth and pine float around. on the palate the hops are wrapped in a blanket of citrus and malt. They don't stand out as much as some DIPA's, but the balancing act here is pulled off perfectly, which results in a drinkable, yet very tasty example of the style. Mouth-feel is medium bodied. This one goes down pretty smooth, with an essence of orange peel as an aftertaste. This is a highly rated, and most talked about brew which, in my humble opinion does not quite live up to all the hype, but is for sure a good damn beer."
"My """go to""" beer store normally doesn't have any of Stone Brewing Companies products but I saw a few cases of this stuff sitting on a cart and I took it upon my self to do a little downstocking. Anyway as i poured the brew in my pint glass I got the full floral aroma before I even put my nose to the edge of the glass. It's almost like a pine tree just fell on top of me. The appearance was nice as well glowing a nice amber/orangey hue thru the glass. If you like hops this is the beer for you. Not over done in anyway but like another review said the 100 IBU's is slightly questionable. I was expecting my tongue to just fall off from the bitterness but that wasn't the case. ruination IPA is a very drinkable beer and i will definately be partaking in some more very soon."
"I feel like that Stone, who I normally associate with over the top, in your face beers, shows some restraint with this one. Nothing in the taste is overpowering, and 7.7 percent alcohol is fairly low for a Double IPA. This is an excellent beer that I will definitely be buying again and again."
"Topshelf stuff. Welcome to my refrigerator."
"Awesome IIPA. Aroma was all hops. Strong citrus and pine. Pour wsa a nice deep orange with plenty of bubbles and a one finger off white head. Taste is strong and hoppy. Citrus and grapefruit with nice carbonation and just a hint of malt in the aftertaste. The carbonation makes this an extremely drinkable IIPA. It's not as thick and syrupy as most."
"Overall impression: This is a very good DIPA. I would rank it behind some of my favorites though (my current favorite being Russian River's Pliny the Elder). I am a hophead and this brew has more malt and alcohol flavors than is optimal for me in a DIPA. And, as strange as it may sound, I like my hops a little less bitter. That said, I will definitely be drinking this on a regular basis, though a little goes a long way. As the bottle says there is an """immediate ruinous effect on your palate.""" You won't be tasting much for a while after this beer."
"Pours a golden orange in color with a bit over a finger of fluffy white head that has pretty good retention. Great aroma, hops seem to jump out of the glass. Citrus aromas dominate. Citrus might actually be a bit vague, its mostly oranges. Floral, pine and resin notes are also present. Taste is like the aroma but, in a way, its a bit more balanced. The citrus hops that dominated the aroma play a more complimentary role in the flavor but still dominate. Piney and resiny hops are more prominent here and really come to the fore towards the finish when the bitterness really hits. This beer is indeed solidly and strongly bitter but it doesn't seem like the 100+ IBUs the bottle claims. Mouthfeel is quite good, medium-light body with moderate+ carbonation. Drinkability is pretty darn good, this brew is very flavorful and enjoyable and a darn good representation of the style. I recommend buying this beer in bombers or sixers because a single 12 oz. bottle really isn't enough."
"This beer is truly one of my favorites if you could not tell. I picked up my latest bottle at Consumre Beverage on Como Park in Lancaster, NY. They have an increasingly amazing selection, and their cooler is supremely cold. As always, this beer is best drank out of a heavy glass to let it breathe and to allow for a more wide and even entry into your mouth for feel."
"Drinkable, despite the super-hops. Very good beer all around."
"I think this is very drinkable. Wish I hand a whole sleeve of it instead of just one. Overall, I love this brew. Hop lovers will really enjoy it obviously, but it has enough malts and balance and alcohol to appeal to many palates. Very well made."
"Well done!"
"D - Good to switch things up and overall enjoyable but not a main stay. If they could balance out the taste and hide the alcohol a little more this would be one of my favorite DIPAs."
"Save for a late session treat when the tastebuds can't take more....absolutely...but try it...you will like it."
"Bottom line: If you love hops you will love this beer. If you don't, then why are you reading this review? It's an IPA. Still, excellent balance that I think anyone could enjoy."
"D: A good beer, but it would be tough to drink a lot of them. Certainly a good specimen for major hop loads. Better than others in the category."
"D - I would drink this beer whenever I had the chance. Just passed 60 minute IPA on my top 5."
"Obviously we're dealing with a hoppy beer here, but for a DIPA, this is pretty well balanced. I don't see myself drinking a ton of them, but if I'm on a one-bottle night, this does the trick nicely."
"Purchased this beer from By the Bottle, in Vancouver WA. Poured from a bomber into a pint class and marveled at the way the head formed. Almost reminded me of a certain nitrous beer. Head left loads of bountiful lacing on top of a great copper orange full bodied IPA! Aromas exploded into my nasal cavities with piny, flowery, citrus and just plain outstanding aromas. Taste definitely follow nose with a luscious, piny, dry, bitter, sweet, malty , caramel, acidic and altogether complex pallet sensation gong on. I would say complex is the operative word. Mouthfeel is medium with great carbonation. This beer is freak'n awesome!"
"This beer is truly a bloody adventure, and one not to be drank unless you're in the mood. In terms of an extreme beer, this would probably get 5s across the board, but is just under perfect scoring due to the fact that you can't always just pick this up and drink it. It delivers on its promise. That said, I can't wait to stop typing and enjoy the rest of this..."
"This is a hell of an IPA. Juicy, fragrant, bitter, and delicious. Will pick up more of this."
"An excellent bear by Stone, up to par with their Arrogant Bastard ale, which is by far the best beer known to man."
"Drinkability - Off the charts. After enjoying a beer like this I'm searching the web trying to find a t-shirt to prove my appreciation."
"Serving: On tap 10/18/08"
"Aroma is strong and richly hoppy, promising a seriously hoppy beer - should whet any hop lover's beer appetite. Color is a clear honey-golden, and off-white head is thick and fairly persistent. Flavor is ferociously hoppy and quite bitter, but has a hint of sweetness and even a bit of fruity taste. Texture is fairly smooth, but it still goes down with an attitude and leaves a pleasantly bitter, hoppy aftertaste. Recommended for all who love seriously hoppy ales."
"This is a very good, very deep IPA. Pours a cloudy caramel color with a one finger tan head to it. Good lacing. The aroma is full of citrus,hopsand pine. As for the taste, a very citrus and hoppy taste to it. A medium to full body beer. Has a long lasting taste toit. Pretty good beer."
"Orangey yellow pour into my SA glass. Pretty 2 fingers of near-white frothy head. Smell of hop heaven...grassy, citric. Huge taste of citrus and semi-pine hop flavor. Very long lasting hop bitterness...not very full bodied but that's OK. Tons of hop flavor...I love it. Very drinkable."
"Still, this is a very tasty, very fragrant IPA. Full of character and extremely drinkable."
"Amazing."
"22 oz of Ruination is quite a job. Delicious if you like hops. I do & it is. Each & every hop head should seek this out. This beer is, or will be eventually, a legend."
"A classic Double IPA, and my favorite. Pours nice, creamy head, obviously very floral, very nice bitter finish that stays around a while. Very well mannered for a double, and nicely balanced. They advertise this as a 100+ IBU, but it's so well made you would never know it. Also the ABV is about perfect for this style of brew, you can have a few and enjoy yourself without getting dead drunk."
"D: Awesome, awesome, awesome. Stone has another winner (no surprise) and here's a brew that rivals their standard IPA. This is a staple of the brew world and one you should make your way to find. The balance is awesome despite the incredible amount of hops (usually a weaker IPA's downfall). Get this brew and enjoy!"
"At Trenton Road Takeout and The Hulmeville Inn, this masterful beer is constantly is cold supply of bottles. As the label implies, if you think it tastes bad, you clearly are not worthy of this liquid poem to the glory of the hop! Ruination is not only a beverage worthy of kings, but an elixir of true palatable flavor and distinguishable magnificence. If you do not like Ruination when you first try it, it is because you are a fizzy- yellow beer drinking wimp. Man up, drink Stone, or stay sober."
"Very piney, and stong but at the same time smooth. Again if you like IPA's you will like this."
"Pours a rosey orange amber with a sheet white head that bubbles up two fingers, respectable! Smell is dominated by grapefruit, orange zest, and a sugar cookie malt backbone. Taste is hop-gressive for sure. Lovely. Grapefruit juice, orange rhine, tropical notes of lime and flora. Then marches in sweet, sugar cookie dough, fresh baked bread. Very drinkable, finishing dry and begging for more. Always in my fridge right next to Green Flash's West Coast IPA."
"Great beer Stone brewing thank you for this wonderfull beer."
"D: It goes down pretty easily, as it's lighter than some of the bigger bodied DIPAs. Lower alcohol for a DIPA, too. I wouldn't probably session with this beer, but I did drink it in gulps rather than sips."
"Overall, highly recommended. I was craving a beer that would ruin my palate after the swath of malty-sweet Oktoberfest beers I consumed over the past sixteen days."
"As others have said, the alcohol does become noticeable. However, the bomber was easy to finish. This is definitely a beer I turn to when I need hops. It was a nice change from the malt-dominant Octoberfests and stouts I have been working on recently. Now if only I can figure out how to get my wife to bring this home every day..."
"D: Not even halfway through this beast on a rather empty stomach, and already slowing down. Could have 3 or 4 on a good day, but the alcohol definitely gets you. I would definitely recommend this beer over the IPA though."
"D - Depends on your enjoyment of the style. For me very drinkable and tasty DIPA that is a well balanced but aggressive brew."
"One of these and my tongue is all ready dead from the bitterness. If you want bitter, look no further. Not a big citrus rush like some other DIPAs."
"D: This is definitely the best Imperial IPA that I've had, highly drinkable and I am so pleased that this is now available in DFW."
"D: This beer lives up to its name, making a bomber something to stretch out a bit longer than most IPAs. This is not for the weak of heart or tongue."
"D- Too bold to be perfectly drinkable, but still quite enjoyable even in large quantities"
"Thank You Stone may I have another!?!"
"I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys the hoppy beers. However, it could be more complex and I would like to taste more maltiness to balance its bitterness. Still, it's pretty freaking good."
"A delicious big IPA. It is very smooth and drinkable. Hops heads will love it."
"the mouthfeel was good almost that of a winter warmer beer."
"D: This is a delicious, huge IPA. Well balanced, but strong - you're only having 1 or 2 of these."
"Overall, this one was delicious. There's not a whole lot that would set it apart from other quality DIPAs, but it's really good nonetheless. I basically felt like I was chewing on fresh hops. I will keep this beer in mind when I need a good hop fix."
"D: To die for. A great beer that drinks really well."
"Mouthfeel was also oily and moderate bodied. Adequate carbonation."
"D: This is the one that opened my eyes to the world outside of mainstream beers. Despite that personal bias the reviews do not lie. Overall this beer is like an amusement park. Scaring your taste buds in the bitter fun house and numbing the mouth on the hoppy tilt-a-whirl . In a perfect world I would make this a daily indulgence. Perfection."
"D - This actually is the first IPA I've appreciated all the way down... I think I'm warming up to them. Bring on the Stone Brewery!"
"Love Stone's stuff, but this isnt a favorite offering of mine from their shop."
"D: This is an excellent IPA. It's well constructed, tasty and complex. A good choice."
"An awesome San Diego style IPA. I compare this with the Port 2nd Anniversary I just had and this one just has cleaner, more balance flavor profile. Very much recommended for IPA fans."
"D - The bitterness and the alcohol burn detract from this some what. Though not as big and bold as a lot of DIPAs out there, it strikes a nice balance and becomes a somewhat sessionable DIPA if there is such a thing."
"D - Wow! After the first sip, I thought, """Yeah, it's not THAT hoppy.""" Into the second sip, I was like, """OK, there's the hops...nice!""" By the fourth sip or so, I was definitely feeling the hops pummel my palate into oblivion. For those who have not developed a taste for aggressive hop bitterness, this is definitely NOT a good IPA to begin with. This is definitely up there among the hoppiest brews I've ever consumed. Now I can say that Stone has officially ruined me!"
"Appearance is a fierce amber-orange with a minimal off-white head. Good lacing. While very cloudy at first this beer cleared a bit as it warmed. A strong aroma of fresh hops fills my nose with orange, grapefruit, pine, and mint. The taste is almost too complex to describe. Multiple flavors of fresh hops and malt dance around. The malt is rich and yet velvety. The hops are luscious but not harsh for such a highly hopped beer. Stone has pulled off one of the most difficult brewing techniqes out there. A balanced, yet not harsh, double IPA. THE best example I've ever tried of this style."
"As soon as I opened the bottle, the most wonderful aroma came to me. It was centennials, one of the best hops I've ever smelled and tasted, and I think there's another in there, it would be tough to push a beer to 100+ IBUs with only centennial, but the whole bottle and the beer in the glass smell like opening a bag full of fresh hops. It pours amber colored with a decent head, not the biggest, but that's perfectly find for this beer. When you taste it, I can't think of a comparison (from any of the beers I've ever gotten in SC) in terms of hoppy beers. There's nothing astringent to it, just a crisp flavor with a clean, beautiful bitterness, and it's surprisingly balanced, though the malt definitely gets no spotlight. You know from the name that this beer is ruinous for your mouth, but I actually loved it. I had the taste in my mouth for an hour, just drinking water that tasted like hops, but its certainly not a great thing if you're trying to do anything else. I found myself wanting more and the alcohol doesn't hit too hard, but I can't see this beer having a high value in a session."
"Stone just came to town 2 days ago, but I'm already a believer. This was well balanced and delicious. Highly recommended."
"Extremely drinkable. The alcohol is well masked, although I think categorizing this as a """double IPA""" is a little misleading given it's under 8%. If you're not driving, apply liberally."
"The 6th from my pack, this is the only bottle I really truly enjoyed. I had the previous bottles with my review-hat off and they were just so-so. This is a beer that needs constant attention to appreciate."
"D - Highly recommended. Incredibly easy to drink."
"D= I love hops but even I thought this was a disturbingly dry and bitter beer. Having said that, it would pair well with big foods and is a testament to the skills of the Stone brewers."
"Drinkability - A bit boozy, the alcohol is not all that well hidden. Though I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting, I certainly don't mind drinking it often."
"A seethru dark gold with a voluminous three finger head that died quickly but left lace patches. An incredibly strong hop smell buttressed with some citric and spice notes along with hints of malt. While a very dry beer, it maints a smoothness to it and was kind of creamy and fluffy...a very filling beer in the mouth. Not only is there a warming sensation to this beer, but it gets smoother as it warms (it's a sipper) and not only do the hops (mostly citric and earthy) continually poke out but there are some underlying malts, a little sweet in my opinion, in there as well. Another quality IPA from Stone; although true to its name, don't plan on having different beers and adding this to the mix b/c your taste buds will be dulled for a long time."
"Drinkability: If you're only drinking Ruination, it's a 5. However, true to it's name, it ruins all other beers that follow. I could drink these all night... if I were rich. So, the fact that I can't drink many of these in succession lowers drinkability to a 4. Sorry Stone. This is one of my two favorite beers of all time (along with Old Rasputin). A must try!"
"drinkability is good. this is a palate killing brew in its bitterness and hop quality. that being said, the hops are nicely mixed and well proportioned with respect to one another. it still would have been nice to see some malt mixed in to play off of the hops."
"D- Very, Very good IPA. Not to heavy but not to fruity a couple of pints of this stuff is just splendid. Very Refreshing."
"D- I really like this one and think it is a very good DIPA. I will certainly have it again. I can certainly see why people like this so much and it is one I would love to try on cask. Because the character of this brew isn't all that strong strong its very drinkable. Really-there's nothing to not like about this beer. I know my rdev will be way below the norm...which is because I do really like this beer but I'm not blown away."
"Drinkabily is very good as long as my tastebuds can handle it. Can't wait till next Thursday and have it on tap finally!!!"
"I like IPAs well enough, along with the occasional DIPA, but this is an unbalanced hop bomb."
"D-I can't imagine being able to have this on a regular basis and passing up having at least one extremly often"
"Oh man do i love this beer. Poured a nice golden color with a nice head to it. Very strong hop smell piney, citrusy and floral. Very much of bitter citrus hops to the taste with a malty sweetness. Leaves a undeniable taste in your mouth through out the whole beer. I could drink this all day, a good session DIPA,one of my favorites"
"Pours light amber orange with thin white head. Sweet aroma of citrus, hops and nice pine. Flavor begins citrusy and roasty sweet and finishes with a great dry kick of hops. Leaves the throat nice and dry, like a good double IPA should. Ruination is always a winner in my book, one of my favorites."
"A nice hop assault for the ones who like it, but it is unidimensional. There are plenty of better balanced DIPAs out there, IMHO."
"D= This one could get you into trouble. Alcohol totally hidden, Sip after sip just gets better and better without weighing your tongue down too much."
"Dark reddish amber color, fluffy thick off-white head. It sticks around for a bit and leaves nice lacing. The smell is possibly the best part of this beer. Strong citrusy, piney, delicious, """drink me now""" smell. Taste is similar with a very strong dry bitter finish. I wish I had 5 more of these."
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium body, with goo carbonation crispness. Very solid and approachable DIPA"
"Overall: A wonderful beer. As ruinous as they claim it to be to the taste buds it is anomalously balanced in its own right. Perhaps best enjoyed at the end of a tasting session. I could drink numerous pints without taste bud fatigue but realize other beers would have a hard time following this one. Highly recommended."
"Pours a very nice clear deep gold. Smells like hops. Tons of fresh floral/citrusy Cenntenial hops. Tastes like tons of fresh floral/citrusy Centennial hops. Sweet malt keeps it relatively balanced. Has a bracing bitterness that is not unpleasent. Mouthfeel is moderatly viscous with a smooth carbonation. Alchohol is not detectable. At 7.7% this is small for a DIPA wich is not a bad thing. Very and drinkable and very good. Wish I had access to it all the time."
"One of the best beers I've had recently. Everything about it is top-notch. The blend of hops and alcohol and everything is perfect - not like most IPAs. Actually, I usually don't drink IPAs as they can be a little too hoppy and bitter for my taste, but this one is different, and I'd buy it again for sure. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability certainly has been established. I could drink this beer during a summer BBQ or next to the fire on a frigid winter night. Thank you to Stone and their gargoyle for this deliciousness."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a small off-white head. Smells like a fresh grapefruit, amazingly rich. Taste is is the same up front with grapefruit, biscuity malt with a piney, floral finish. Very impressive bitterness levels that cling to your tongue. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels medium and smooth. Fantastically drinkable, even with its aggressive flavors. The best double IPA I have had. Truly world class."
"Welcome to Hop Heaven."
"Dark brownish orange if you let the light shine through it. Smell is like hop and honey. My Dad didn't like this one. This beer is very hoppy bitter with a bit of a sweet finish, if I could discern the sweet taste a bit more it would be perfect, overall thoug, it's still pretty tasty and I'm glad I have a case of it keeping my 120 ipa case company. Mouth feel was bubbly and oily. They called it a liquid poem to hops, yeah I agree, though it's not my favorite IPA, I like it though."
"Not a bad brew. I would prefer the Stone IPA. I felt this was lacking in hops, but made up for it in the alcohol content. I am better for trying it, and if this and the 'Busch boys' offering were all I had I would take this. IF your looking for a buzz I'm sure this would work, but I probably won't be buying it again."
"One of my favorite IPA's for sure."
"single from Whole Foods Reston"
"Bottom line: Skip the shpiel on the back and enjoy this moderately hoppy and delicious IPA!"
"Oh, Ruination... If you like IPA's (and doubles), you've probably already had this stuff. What can I say that hasn't already been posted by everyone here -- Stone makes some of the best west-coast IPA's there are. Ruination is no joke -- read the label, it tells you where the name came from and it's right on. You are hit with one of the hoppiest, most grapefruity tastes in the world of IPAs as soon as this hits your palate. The aromas coming out of it are unreal. One of the more drinkable doubles out there as <8%, and won't knock you over like a DFH 90min will. It's a heavy citrus-y smell and taste, and literally a double-IPA defined imho. Pour it into a snifter or goblet and just take in the aromas and enjoy it slowly at first, you will fall in love. As usual, great job Stone."
"Light orange color with a nice sticky head considering the abv. Carmel malts are followed by a strong rush of floral hops. Nice gradual hop bitterness that is tasted long into the aftertaste. Strong hops as expected but also balanced nicely for an IIPA. Excellent! I don't think Stone ever disappoints."
"This one pours a orangish yellow with a white head that fades fast but leaves lacing. Smells sweet and hoppy, some malt characters. The flavor is very similar, lots of sweet flavor, good hop balance. Not as potent of a hop flavor as I thought, but still flavorful and full. A good balance, medium light body, great mouthfeel. This one is a good beer, easy drinker, higher ABV then normal. Another great beer from Stone."
"One of the most beautiful looking beers I've seen. Crystalline orange-yellow with continuous streams of fine bubbles and a pillowy, clinging head. This is all about the piney hops -- lots on the nose, lots on the tongue. This sits on top of the classic """solid malt backbone.""" Finishes sharp and crisp, with a lingering warming sensation."
"D: I love this beer, but it will kill your taste for anything else that you will drink for the day."
"Awesome beer...I could drink this everyday."
"Overall: awesome"
"From the beginning this brew seduces me with its alluring honey color. It pours nicely as most Stone brews do and the generous head laces well. On the nose is a strong but not sharp floral hops and grapefruit. Medium bodied and great mouthfeel. Great flavors of fresh hops, apricot, hints of pineapple. Uncommonly smooth for an IPA and appropriately dry. Classic, challenging, impressive and true to both brewery and breed."
"Drinkability: This is still my favorite IPA to date. Stop reading this review and go open a bottle!"
"This beer pours a nice light clousy amber with a half a finder white head. The smell is beautiful! You can smell the hops along with the toasted malts as well as some citrusy smells. For such a high IBU beer this is VERY smooth. The mixture of the citrusy hops flavor and the toasted malts flavor are beutifully balanced. The mouthfeel is nice a slight, I just ate grapefruit aftertaste but a VERY smooth beer for such a high IBU rating. I am certain I could polish off a couple of these in a night but I would have to mix and match them with something sweet. A beautiful beer YUM!"
"I sometimes dislike it when a DIPA is all hops and no malt. This one definitely has that aura about, but that's what the brewers were going for. It's unbalanced for my personal taste, but it's a hop-head's wet-dream. I enjoyed it greatly, but prefer their standard IPA."
"D - Balanced which makes it easy to have more than one but it does hold true to its name and ruin your palette with all the sticky hops."
"I can't wait to get this regularly in NC."
"Ruination has scary drinkability for it's style..I have to pace myself with this badboy, or it could catch up to me quickly! Hope that Casanova's has some of this as I head east to Eau Claire in a couple of weeks. Great, great beer."
"My only disappointment is that it was gone soon, but luckily the buddy who's house I was at had another one and we devoured it next!"
"I'm really glad I came back to this one. I realize now that I was too young and immature to appreciate what Stone was doing. I would say they pioneered the """extreme brew""" movement that we enjoy today and I thank them for it!"
"D. This is a pretty good DIPA. Stone doesn't disappoint at all. It could use a little more balance overall but that's being nitpicky on a very solid beer. Wish I could get more of this in Louisiana."
"Drinkability - Stone really doesn't make a beer I don't like, and this was another winner from Cal. A wonderful job of not letting the hops kill the palate with the blend of sweet malts and bready notes. A great experience!"
"D. Drinkability is great if you are a hophead. Easy to drink and bursting with hops every drink. Once you have your first one, it will be all that you crave for the rest of the night."
"Leave it to Stone to take it over the top and do is successfully. What a fabulous Imperial IPA. Aroma is hops of course, but there are hop aromas of pine, citrus, flowers, and fruit. I can hold the glass about 8""" from my nose and still detect the aroma, it makes the hair on my arm stand up. Pours a great gold hue with lots of thick white head that creates a decent amount of lacing. Great mouthfeel, surprisingly full and creamy. Flavor is jam packed with hops which wasn't a surprise. Fortunately you can also enjoy a good amount of malts. What is truly spectacular is that although it bites you right away the incredible amount of hops actually blend well and fade into a nice smoooth finish. I'm sure that I shouldn't be talking very close to anybody right now but this one works well. 100+ IBU's is crazy and for this beer to mesh and work out as great as it does deserves a round of applause."
"Also, about the name... forget tasting other beers after this one! Your palate will be Ruined."
"D: This bomber will be enough for me at 7.7%. a beer to savour and sip for sure."
"D: This IPA punches you in the face. So, one bomber of these is plenty. But, a great imperial IPA and a nice treat here and there. It does have a refreshing quality to it."
"Amazing light amber color with an interesting aroma. Heavy in hops, malt, and alcohol scents. Definately too strong for my general taste. The creamy fizzy alcoholic flavor stays well after you are done. Definately one of the best IPAs out there, but it is not on my list of beers I want to repeatedly drink."
"D. This is my night cap, I could have had more but one did me just fine."
"this one is my first 5.0 a+ beer, this one is not for the faint of heart, this is big and bold and the bitterist beer i have ever had, if you like hops as much as i do than this beer is for you, but if you are a biggner or scard of the hops than this is not for you, this beer boast 115 ibu's and the name and bottle say it all, your tast buds will be signifantley ruined to all outher tates after drinking this one. this one is perfection in a glass and the standard b y witch i judge all outher ips's"
"www.theviceblog.com"
"A very well crafted IPA. It is clean, refreshing, and boasts interesting development in the flavor profile despite being incredibly unbalanced to begin with. Alcohol content and the sheer obliteration of your taste buds lower the drinkability, but this is a beer to be savored and enjoyed over time."
"D- yet another wonderful brew from Stone, is there anything these guys make that doesn't make me want more right away."
"The lighter body makes it drinkable and intense bitterness of this brew makes it a delicious sipper. With 7.7% ABV, Stone's creation is very drinkable, so long as one can handle the complex bitter hop flavors."
"With a rather low ABV for the style, this is quite drinkable, as long as this is the only thing you want to drink all night. A great nightcap with more than enough for my hop fix."
"First sip is very good, lots of floral and grassy flavor, with some citrus from the hops too. There is a bready malt in there, but I really have to focus on it to taste it. The hops really overwhelm me, but that was the intention obviously. A little warming in my chest from the alcohol, but that's fine with me. I am not a hop head, and I thought this might be to hoppy for me, but I am pleasantly surprised to find I rather like it. Mouthfeel is a bit chewy, but I could have used a bit less carbonation myself, but other than that minor side note, this is a tasty beverage. I'm feeling hops on my tongue for about a minute after each sip. I would have to place drinkability in the medium range, because I wouldn't want to drink more than a couple of bottles before I lost all sense of taste. But if I was looking to drink just 1 bottle, or looking for a bottle to end the night, this would be an excellent choice for a nightcap."
"Drinkability - Goes down extremely well, especially for an IPA. This is a solid IPA, almost what I was hoping, but not quite, from a 4.3 rating from 1200 reviews. I like it, might get it again, but its not an absolute favorite."
"Taste is initially sweet and buttery/diacetyl and rather rich on the finish, ever so slightly chewy on the malts. Feel is smooth and balanced yielding a nice drinkability. Very nice, yet I find this brew to be too sweet to make a habit of. Try it on cask if you can, exquisite...Otherwise head to Alpine."
"Found at the bottom of the label: """A liquid poem to the glory of the hop.""" Well said."
"D: Balance was a very nice surprise and makes it way more drinkable than some without giving up anything you want in an IPA. This will be a top repeat for me when I need an good IPA."
"Overall, a nicely complex IPA with different hop flavors present (floral, citris, & peppery notes)."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a clear golden amber. Had a nice thick bubbly white head that clung extremely well and left a small layer on top. Aroma was slightly sweet, but mostly fresh green olives with a touch of garlicy onion. Flavor was smooth, hoppy bitter, small trace of lemon and white bread. Felt slightly over sticky in the mouth, but was perfectly carbonated. Def a sipping beer."
"Drinkability: About as smooth as 100+ IBUs is going to get."
"Drinkability is outstanding. I sucked down this brew while trying to savor it. I'm definitely going to search and stock up my cellar with a few more bottles of these. The hunt's on!"
"D - A bomber of this is a great way to start or end an evening, but you're not drinking a bunch of these things at once!"
"Tastes like water."
"An excellent brew to behold,yet this is not a particular style I cherish."
"Drinkability: I shouldn't bought more... a single wasn't enough... costs be damned, this is the most drinkable IPA I've had."
"Not a very good beer to my palate."
"Man oh man, that's a rich beer. It looks great with its pale lemon color and big white head but don't be fooled by its """light""" looks. This beer carries one hell of a punch, upon the first gulp there's a hop attack that is unrivaled by other IPA's. Aroma of lemon, pine, citrus scented bathroom cleaner, a minor touch of circus peanuts. Tastes of lemons with skin and all, citrus, pine, bright citrusy sweet notes toward the finish, clean bitterness. Tickles the tongue. Light bodied with medium carbonation. After a few of these you'll be tripping billies all night but who said that was a bad thing? If you are a fan of hops, this beer is the way to go. Major respect for Stone Brewing Co."
"This baby is bad in the Michael Jackson (the weirdo pop star) sense. A green splash of hops and a bouquet of purple lavender. A bitter, malty, chewy candy, boasting Imperial character. The true essence is captured with small sips and deep inhalation of aroma. A dry hopped whiskey with a slap of sour musk. Elegant, wee bit brutal; demanding admiration and respect."
"Drank this last night - notes from memory. This is a very good DIPA and I liked this better than the Arrogant Bastard I had the night before. Pours to a perfect, dense head of foam showing off the beers bright, brass-like color. The nose is nice (typical citrus) but a bit more subdued than one would expect. The taste and drinkability of this beer is fantastic - classic IPA flavors surrounded by plenty of hops but balanced with enough malt to keep it from falling off the """bitter cliff""". Does this unseat HopSlam as my favorite DIPA? No way! Still, a beer I will buy more of."
"Drinkability is good, this is a very fine DIPA, very much up my ally. The self-indulgent label blurb implies this will be aggressive and difficult to appreciates, but the only thing it ruins for me is the appeal of rougher, less-made DIPAs, of which compared to this there are many! One of Stone's best beers IMHO."
"All I have to say about Ruination on Cask is WOW. A beer ment to be on Cask. Just smooths and rounds out this intense beer. Still mounds of hops, but adds texture and a smooth lengthy finish that this beer from bomber doesn't have. This beer is usually the beer to end all beers because it can linger and disrupt other beer samples, not from cask. Really something to behold."
"Poured light brown with a healthy amount of tan head. Its smell was impressive. I've had a beer with such a strong aroma. The smell was of strong and hoppy. This beer smelled bitter. This beer's taste was similar to its smell, bitter and hoppy, and as far as I could tell that was it. It was delicious. Despite its harsh bitterness this beer was very smooth."
"Drinkability: The balance in this beer makes it more drinkable than it should be. Which is a good thing. Ruined palate indeed - this is a hard one to top."
"if you want to give this a shot it would be good tomorrow or the next day... or any day ending in the letter 'y'... but not all of those days as it still, after this overly lengthy review, has not eased up on my palate"
"The first time I had this beer I was sitting down. I finished a 22 oz of it with out getting up. Feeling a bit buzzed and having to go to the bathroom I got up. I immediately had to sit back down, because I starting to spin. The appearance of this bee is a great golden straw color. The smell is overwhelming hops, mostly citrus, orange and grapefruit. The taste is a pugnacious assault of bitterness as the alpha acids invade your mouth. It is extremely bitter but has a nice hop profile that any hop head will appreciate. The drinkability is limited because of it strength and bitterness, however if all you are drinking is Ruination you're good. It says on the bottle that this beer will ruin your palate, they are not kidding."
"If this beer doesn't scratch your hop itch, then nothing will!"
"Drinkability: Maybe it is my love for IPAs and the like, but I love this beer. If you love hops, you need to give this a try. Be careful though, a 22 oz will leave you feeling quite nice! :D"
"Smells of oranges, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, and some floral notes as well - strong almost astringent feel in the nose when breathing it in. As if there weren't enough hops aromas and flavors in this beer, it's been spiced up with Columbus and Simcoe rounds of dry hopping. They both contribute a great deal of complexity to a big beer that is already heavy on the hops. There are blasts of citrus, pine, black pepper, and a slight grass hint in the finish. Same malt signatures as the bottled version but the real treat here is the cask presentation. The beer has smoothed out considerably, mouthfeel is soft and silky, this is just a treat to consume. So highly and dangerously drinkable after three pints I knew that things were going to go south if I kept going at that pace, but it was hard to stop. Just a wonderful presentation of what was already a great beer. Cheers to Stone for getting some of this up to us LA folks!"
"Another great offering from Stone - I'll have it again for sure, but I don't think I could have too many of these super-flavorful beers in one evening. Definitely don't have it before you have a lighter offereing in the same sitting."
"Get a few."
"The taste doesnt have the initial bite that I was expecting from an IPA. The beer is definitely bitter enough for an IPA, but just didn't have the initial """pop""" that I expected. That being said, it is a VERY drinkable beer. Smooth mouth feel, and great aftertaste."
"Bright clearish glowing orange color with a big lasting beige head. Smell is citrusy, orange, fruity and floral sweet hoppiness. Really nice, fresh smell. Taste is strongly hoppy with big citrusy, hoppy orange flavor. Nice crisp bitterness, but malt is nicely balancing it on through the finish. Really drinkable, refreshing and delicious. Fantastic double IPA!"
"awesome, awesome beer. an IPA that is big, bold, and delicious and has a body you can cut with a knife. finish is long, crisp, slightly dry and very chunky. fabulous stuff"
"D - Nice beer... An aggressive double IPA, but I'll stick with the regular Stone IPA anyday..."
"I would highly recommend this beer. I had this on-tap at the Sugar Maple in Bayview, WI."
"D- This is a great DIPA, one of my favorites so far. I could definitely have 2 or 3 12oz bottles of this before my palate would start to convulse from sheer hop over load. I would recommend this beer to anyone who's really into big hoppy beers."
"a very nice dipa!"
"Drinkability: I could have three or four of these pints. Truly delicious."
"It is definitely a great DIPA."
"D: Well crafted by Stone, I've had the on-tap version and feel that the bottled version is a little tamed. I'm glad I had the chance to pick up a bottle while in Vegas."
"I could drink this all day, of course it would be a very short day after a few pints."
"The spicy character blends well with the sweetness from the malt and the bitterness from the hops. It was a nice day so I had two!"
"D - This is an outstanding DIPA. Very strong and powerful flavors & aromas."
"pours a beautiful crystal clear golden color with a creamy white head. it has a wonderful hoppy aroma that doesn't hide at all. I would love to know the hop arrangement on this beer that wonderful grapefruity, floral aroma carries over well into the flavor combining with the sweet malts to make a wonderful IPA. the mouthfeel is definitely full, but nicely balanced by the hop flavor and carbonation. Very drinkable, starting to be sorry I shared the bomber."
"Tasted on 5/2/08."
"Make sure this one is on your list."
"MF&D - Medioum bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Not as oily as I like, but still very good. Worth checking out."
"A very tasty, very bold DIPA. If you like big hop flavor, this is the beer for you. Ruination is a great name, as I'm seriously thinking pushing my dinner back an hour to let the smack my taste buds took fade a bit. Definitely worth the $6, and I'll buy this again."
"This is a very good DIPA but not an elite one. Still, a very fine beer indeed."
""""A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!""" Here's to a stanza or two."
"I figured out that, if you wait until the bitterness fades a bit after the swallow and then press your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you get the bitterness all over again. I know; kinda silly, but I thought it was fun."
"drinkablity - one more please! great... beer."
"RJR"
"A well balanced beer. Pours golden red with a fluffy white head. Big aroma of caramel malts and citrus/piney malts. Taste starts out with huge sweet malts, and finishes with huge, lasting bitterness. Like everything else with Stone, this beer is about flavor, not subtlety. Big flavor. Big Bitter Finish. Big Beer."
"Poured a gorgeous darkish golden orange color with a small creme colored head. Lacing is spotty and minimal. The aroma is incredibly fresh, floral and citric. Taste is super hop-juicy fruity perfection! Awesome floral hop flavor w/bread and malt flavors quickly joining in after the awesome hop blast. Slick medium mouthfeel. The strong brew is very smooth and drinkable."
"The brewers at Stone may be a bunch of arrogant bastards but boy can they back it up."
"D: Won't have a problem killing this bomber but that is enough for me. Still a great beer that I won't mind drinking from time to time. Worth keeping the cellar for sure."
"Drinkability is good, I'll be getting a few more of these. Wasn't as harsh as some other IPA's, which makes this outstanding."
"I can't stop drinking this beer. Its mild and balanced enough to be an awesome session beer but also hoppy enough to satisfy any hop head out there. A perfect example of an Imperial IPA. Well done stone brewing. Oh yeah it was readily available at the whole foods in Tempe AZ at a very reasonable price. In sixers and 22oz bottles. If you can find it buy it."
"Overall- A damn fine beer, but not one that ruins your taste buds."
"Note that I bought these at something over $16 a six, together with taxes, they came out *mighty* expensive. It's a tasty beer, but not great value at that price."
"From a bomber poured into a nonic. Pours a light pale straw color with a nice frothy white head and a very thin lace that sticks to the glass. Hops Hops and more hops, mostly grapefruit with some piney smell to it. The malt starts off strong but then the hops make their presence known. The hops start off with a citrus taste then the grapefruit takes over. Their is a nice balance between the malt and the hops. Smooth tasting with moderate carbonation, unlike other stone beers their is no oily coating left on the tongue. Not a real bitter aftertaste, nice DIPA that is probably easier to drink than others so I would say I could have a couple of these."
"Full mouthfeel with balanced carbonation and an impressive lack of oiliness for an IPA this big. It's strong, but it drinks so smoothly that a hophead would be delighted to stick with this all night."
"Drinkability is relatively low. Alcohol is moderate but manageable. Flavors are good for a hop head. However, the hop bitterness will wear on anyone with excess consumption which limits it's drinkability."
"Super drinkable and flavorful, but I'm used to even bigger DIPAs (Hercules, Maharaja). If this were considered just an IPA, I'd rank it really high, but as it is, I'd say it's a tad small for its style. After realizing the drink by date was three months past, I'm certain this beer would have been even more impressive had it been fresh, so this review isn't completely fair."
"Well this beer was delicious and I could see downing a few of these with friends. I would be afraid if I drank too many at one sitting that I wouldn't appreciate this beer to it's fullest."
"Not the strongest, hoppiest DIPA I've tried, but one of my favorites."
"D: This is a very nice DIPA. I would have liked to see this one with a little higher ABV . Most in this style are around 8-10%, but none the less a very fine beer. At 7.7 ABV very drinkable. Great beer for my first Stone experience. Skal."
"Definitely set the bar a while back for Double IPAs. But this is not the best in class. Worth a try if you've not had it."
"It's not so over the top that you can't take a big swig without stripping tooth enamel. It's actually pretty drinkable, but the alcohol can limit a session somewhat. Try mixing it up with their regular IPA."
"D: This is a delicious, well balanced, bomb of an IPA. One of my favorite Stone beers and only thing holding this back is the overwhelming punch of the hops which is one of the best parts of this beer."
"This in the fourth Stone brew I've had, but the first to truly impress me. A masterfully crafted beer and one that should not be missed."
"Drinkability: For some reason I was thinking that this was going to be extremely overhopped and not balanced enough to drink for any extended period of time"
"With this beer, you only need two."
"D- I wouldn't recommend drinking too much of this in one night. Your body will not thank you for it. However, enjoyed ice cold and on a warm day it is quite nice."
"EDIT: I had to rereview this brew. It is actually excellent! One of the Best DIPAs I have ever had. I will leave my original comments, but boy was I wrong. It is more refined and well balanced compared to my initial offerings. Maybe it was the batch or my lack of experience with good IPAs. Well whatever the case, it is much better than my original tasting."
"Golden to copper in color this beer poured a 1""" head with medium-sized bubbles that dissipated slowly. The nose is filled with grapefruit and piney hops that are nicely blanced with malt balls and a touch of caramel. In the mouth this is medium-bodied and has a wonderfully smooth texture. This is extremely well-balanced and shows off its hoppy charachter. It all ends with a smooth but bitter finish."
"*Sampled this again after a year. The immediate grassiness goes away in the front, but is noticable in the back of the taste."
"It's somewhat interesting and flavourful, but for me not all that drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very high drinkability, though one does need to exercise some caution with a DIPA like this. If you start out with this ale for a night of drinking, don't be surprised when all of your following ales taste like hop. Also, the smoothness of this ale conceals the higher alcohol content and its easy to drink a couple too many of this one."
"A finely crafted DIPA. This brew pours a fairly dark amber with moderate initial head that dwindles down to a dense cap. The smell is mostly a citrus with some earthy floral notes. The citrus is indistinguishable, but not grapefruit. Some resiny pine finishes the palate off. Just an OK aroma, though the taste is a different story. Solid hop punch here. Very bitter. The hops have way more of a piney resin aspect here. The citrus aspects are gone. Just the slightest hint of any malt balancing. Mouthfeel is clean crisp and likened to a thermal nuclear hop implosion in ones mouth. Forget about moving on to a different beer, your done. Very enjoyable."
"I poured this into a large mug from the brown bomber bottle, and it had a wonderful dark amber color with a quickly dissipating off-white head, and natural translucence that looked just right. Left nice lacing behind after sips. This IPA has a strong, glorious hop scent that I rated as a """5"" as it is one of the best I have smelled. Very flowery and earthy. The taste is definitely bitter but is balanced fairly well by the alcohol and general wholesomeness of the beer."
"D - Drinkibility is very good. Everything seems in good balance and makes for a great beer. The amount of alcohol is just low enough to put a couple of these down in one sitting. Highly recommeded and hop-tastic."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable, especially for the style. This bitterness is on the high end, but there's just enough malt backbone to make you want more of this beer. Excellent take on the style"
"12 oz. bottle. Poured a bright orange cloudy color. No head to speak of. Lacing vanishes quickly.Strong citrus odor and perfume background. Strong ctrus hop taste up front. Then a slight perfume taste comes. Ends slight dry in the the mouth. Not sure you should more than a couple of these in a sitting. Might wipe your palate."
"D: I would have to say that this is for Hopheads only. I love this beer and I know its a staple in the industry, but if you haven't had it you are missing out."
"D: The bitterness on this beer is just about the most intense thing I've ever experienced but I really don't think it effected my drinking experience. All I wanted was to keep drinking this beer. Excellent, excellent example of the style, hops hops and more hops and really thats what this style is all about. The ABV being relatively low for a DIPA makes this one exceptionally drinkable."
"D- I could nurse these all day like an upper west side house-wife nurses a gin and tonic."
"Thanks to scootny for the opportunity. Pours a rich golden straw color with an impressive head that stays around for a while. Really nice carbonation. Smells of wet apricot-like hops with a touch of pine. Nice malty sweetness hidden in the nose too. Really enjoyable mouthfeel, big but not too viscous, smooth without being oily. Tight tingling sensation from the hops on the tongue. Hops dominate the palate (no shit, really?). Crisp and zesty, apricot flavors have transformed more to an intimidating pine over grapefruit sensation. A flash of malty sweetness right at the end. Finish is enjoyable and induces salivation. A really solid DIPA. Highly recommended."
"Drinking such an aggressive beer would not be possible without proper feel. It's insanely smooth and creamy... absolutely perfect in that aspect."
"Split the bottle with my dad and poured a 22 oz. bomber into two pint glasses. As soon as I opened the bottle, the smell of HOPS filled the basement. The nose was very floral and VERY citrusy. Good Lord. Taste was very well balanced. While it was quite hoppy, it was very well balanced with the malt. The taste wasn't overly bitter either, which was a pleasant surprise. Don't know how much of this I could drink. Overall, this is definitely an outstanding beer."
"D - If you like hops this one is a three-course meal. I would reach for this again regardless of the price. Recommended."
"Also feels a bit watery on the tongue"
"this beer poured a cloudy orangeish yellow color with some decent head. overall, a good looking beer, despite the lack of clarity. the bottles said the ibu's on this are 100+, but it tastes more like sour fruit than fresh hops. i believe this one i drank with barefootbrewer and wyattearp was aged a bit and that could account for the unique characteristics i'm getting in this beer. the mouthfeel is quite full for a regular ipa. nice. overall, i think i'd like this beer fresher that it was sampled, although i think stone regularly delivers on their offerings."
"I'd call this a split between an IPA and a double. Either way, it is very good and I am wishing I could get my hands on it more often."
"22oz bottle poured into a large Duvel tulip glass. Pours a nice orangish amber color with a thick white head that possesses excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is dominated by fresh resiny hops. The taste is an explosion of hop bitterness that seemingly kicks you square in the mouth, one of the most mouth puckering experiences I have had with beer. The taste is all grapefruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and delightfully smooth and creamy. Overall, this is without question one of the finest DIPAs I have ever tried, and could be one of the hoppiest beers that has ever touched my lips. If you don't like hops, stay far away. If you are a hophead like me, this is your beer. Highly Recommended!"
"Stone seemed to dish out what they advertised, but I'm still a much bigger fan of their Bastard."
"Poured a partial bottle into a wine glass, I figure the higher alcohol content justified it. Right away, I smell a wonderful hoppy aroma, the pour was a nice amber orange. The first taste is a little startling, but this is definitely a brew you have to settle into. After a few sips, it's bit harsh but definitely very good. I prefer the regular IPA, but I would definitely give this another try. The hops don't come through as clearly as with the regular IPA, but this is not a bad thing, just different, this is indeed a different beer."
"D- Not recommended. Very many imperials that are better constructed."
"I finally tried this after having it on my to-drink list for quite some time. It poured a light copper color with a little bit of head, and it had a sweet lemon and hops scent. The flavor was much the same, dominated by a very lemony flavor and a bitter aftertaste. There was no malt or yeast flavor to balance it out, that I could detect anyway, and the texture was fairly thin and watery. Overall it was good and easy to drink, but not anything great."
"The smell- piney, citrusy, flowery, all the best characteristics of Stone IPA but jacked up to the nines. This beer did not overpower me and paired great with my pizza pie. Excellent head retention, glass lacing, a pretty honied color to the pour. the taste is out of this world complex, long lingering hops, grapefruit and pine- but soo so balanced and satisfiying. Rolls through your tongue and palate to a long sustained finish. On the contrare, no ruining of my buds occured-it made me clamor for more. Great beer from one the country's premier breweries."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"In the land of DIPAs, this has got to be one of my favs."
"I can see this becoming a mainstay in my refrigerator. I love this beer just as much, if not more than Arrogant Bastard, and that's saying a lot!"
"I'm a fan. Overall, I find this offering from Stone superior to their regular IPA in terms of complexity and balance. Just a well brewed beer."
"I've been calling this my favorite beer for a while now...figure it's time I threw my review into the mix. I can't say enough about this beer. Pours a bright golden/honey color...foamy white head with sticky lacing. Smells glorious!! Bright, citrus, piney/hoppy goodness. Wonderful bitterness....aftertaste stays with you for a looong time. So damn good. I really credit this beer with opening my eyes to how exciting the world of craft beer can be."
"M/D - Incredibly smooth beer. Excellent carbonation. The taste does smash the palate so it wont do you much good to sample some other right after this one. I could certainly make a night out of the beer."
"Far and away my favorite DIPA of em all, it holds true to it's word though, in ruins you're palate but in a good way. Tast is very hoppy and very bitter but it's DIPA what really did you expect? ;-) Mouthfeel is very full feeling with the alcohol not being too overpowering to you but I could see being very well off after a few of these. My tip is to open this up and pour into a glass and take a smell right off the bat. That, my friends, is a dang good IPA."
"A total Imperial IPA standby. Hopefully Stone doesn't change anything with the hop shortage..."
"Pours a golden orange with an off-white head. Lots of sticky lace. Aroma is of pure hops; sharp citrusy hops. Taste is full of hops as well. Strong citrus and pine flavors, with a little bit of sweet malt hidden in the back. Bitterness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is great, medium full, smoooth, well carbonated. This bomber is going down pretty easy. Nearly 8% ABV is pretty unnoticeable."
"Fairly drinkable, for the style, though a bit intense on the bitterness side - even for a hophead like me. Perfect carbonation. A +"
"D: This is definitely a hop head beer, it gets to be a little much to handle by the end of the beer. So I could have one of these every once in a while, but it'd be when really craving some hops. One is definitely good for a night. Definitely a good beer though. I really enjoyed it."
"D: A tremendously accessible dIPA that doesn't lose its hop edge.. nice job guys!"
"Pours a clear orangey yellow with good white head that lingers. Nose is just balls out citrus hop flowers with ever so slight spice. The taste follows with hoptastic flavors and great bitterness. This is called ruination for a reason. My tastebuds are crying (joyfully, it hurts so good) hop bitterness lingers on the finish. Unmistakeable west coast Super IPA. Mouthfeel is pretty much flawless for the style, and drinkability is pretty darn good. Defenitely a good go to IPA, and readily accesible. Great."
"D- Dangerously drinkable, this one will sneak up on ya. A good pick for the serious Hop Head!"
"Had another one for Easter Weekend....This just gets better and better each time you drink it. My initial review was the aroma was fruity almost pineapple like...well it's sweet but the more I take in the aroma it smells more and more like sweet grapefruit. This is truly an EXCEPTIONAL beer...I want MORE"
"Taste is lots of hoppy, bitter, bubbly, grapefruit. Dry on the tongue. Pleasing into the core, warms you up."
"Drinkablity: Excellent, bold IPA. Cranks their standard IPA up a notch."
"The drink settled with a dark, murky gold color with a medium head, which was amber-white in appearance. The aroma was incredibly sweet, with a mixture of hops, wheats, caramel and even spice. It was wicked sweet and sour for an IPA, giving it a great taste. The carbonation allowed it to be nice and crisp, but with the taste the drink has, this mouthfeel makes it odd with those flavors. Overall, a powerful, incredible IPA."
"D - I could drink this as an everyday beer. In fact I often do!"
"Nice body and drinkable for sure. Recommended if you like hops!"
"Taste was great...hops upon hops...sweet in the back. Nicely balanced, but the hops take precedence for sure."
"Overall, an excellent, very complex hoppy beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with drink by 3/3/08. Amber orange color with little to no head but nice carbination. Very nice floral to grapefruit smell on every whiff. Nice sweet hoppy taste with grapefruit to pine and a nice hoppy bitter taste following the sweetness. Very nice DIPA. I could have 2-3 of these at one sitting but would prefer to savor every sip. In the same league with Hopslam."
"D. I could down a few of these easily. It was one of the best IPAs I have had in some time and the balance of hops and malt and citrus and color made for perfect drinkability."
"The taste was knock-your-socks-off bitter. For me, the bitterness (100 IBU's) was too much, and it overwhelmed any of the other flavors. As it warmed however, the bitterness mellowed and the hops came through. This is one that I would recommend, but I would suggest having it on the warmer side."
"Wow, this definitely one brawny beer that leaves it all out on the table. Heavy hops, heavy malts, and heavy heat? Check! Check! and Check! Even wiht all those big flavors and feel, I still find this bruiser of a DIPA to be quite drinkable. It may lack the magic and panache of some other West Coast Hop Bombs, but this palatte wrecker from Stone can more than hold its own."
"Thick and silky with a crispy carbonation. A classic example of the style. A great Olde English style IPA. Well done once again stone."
"All around this is a great beer that any hop-head would surely love and appreciate."
"Cheers"
"I highly recommend this beer. One of the best IPAs out there."
"T/M/D: Oily hops, and very little on the front of the tongue... it's not until this has settled in that the assault starts. Again, a bit of a medley, with citrus peel and pine blending in there. It all goes down quite smooth in the finish. All around, though, I find that I may prefer Bell's Hopslam on the flavour front in the style. I would still certainly go for another of these, though."
"Overall, a great take on what has become a huge style - the American Double I.P.A.. My favorite out of all the Double I.P.A.s is Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe, but Ruination is excellent as well. Might come down to whether you prefer a thick, silky body (Double Simcoe), or a lighter, smoother body (Ruination). Calling this a lighter body might be a bit misleading, of course."
"My new favorite, I think. Time for a serious favorite-off between Ruination, Founder's Red, Hop Rod Rye, and Hop Slam. If I live through that, maybe I'll invite the RIS crowd. But in terms of where my present taste resides, this is it. Stone rules!"
"This beer a sipper that I''ll enjoy one at a time."
"Floral, slightly citric hop aroma that lasted for a couple of minutes after pouring. Deep golden color with a creamy head that remained for a while after pouring and never completely dissipated. Lots of lace on the sides of the glass. Serious hop flavor and bitterness. As the beer warmed up above 50 degrees, detected some alcohol bite that became a little harsh around 52 degrees. Beer was much better balanced when a little cooler (~48 deg). Detected subtle crystal malt flavor and aroma as well. Very carbonated which caused it to clear the palate very quickly, making way for a nicely bitter and hoppy aftertase. Overall, an excellent beer: big, hoppy, complex and even though hops dominated, pretty well balanced for a double IPA."
"nevertheless, i think i can appreciate what this beer is trying to do, and can certainly see why hop lovers rave about it. anyway, even if i did have a better affinity to it, i think it would probably just be too expensive to be a regular of mine."
"It's a magnificent beer on the taste buds, with hops unsurprisingly prevailing but not without orange peel and lemon protruding. I'm definitely impressed. A little more fruit to balance out the hops would be ideal, but it's neither overly hopped nor without fruit. To a degree, it's splitting hairs, for this is a gem. The texture is heavily hopped without becoming gritty, and is actually quite smooth. Highly drinkable, this is one DIPA not to pass up. It's truly excellent, big and brawny without being overbearing, certainly one of the best I've tried in some time."
"22 oz bomber poured into a standard pint glass. The liquid was a golden yellow color, not quite pale, but deeper ad more bold. #ot some decent lacing on this pour along with a fluffy white head. There was a good amount of piney, earth, floral hops that I detected in this one. Big hoppy punch here very bitter but refreshing and not too dry. This was sticky on the lips' &t much malt flavor. Decent malt presencw but ot overly sweet. awesome ipa."
"D: I had my fill, I thought I was a hop head but this thing will blow your palate up."
"A good, and unique IPA. I really like the wide variety of IPA's stone produces. I recently had the Stones 11th aniversery ale, which was an IPA with more of a dark, carmel-like malt. I think this is nearly the polar opposite as the malts are very light, which allows the hops to dominate."
"overall a good IPA but not one of the best in my opinion, would defintely like to try it on tap some time to see if it brightens things at all."
"d: The label doesn't lie, this beer will ruin your palate and you will thank stone for it. Good stuff. Huge hops, great flavor and aroma. Good complexity. I can't imagine how good this would be fresh."
"Glowing brass-orange color, with s rather small but thick looking almond colored head. Moderate lacing and little carbonation. Not surprisingly the nose is dominated by a beautiful array of hops of all kinds... floral, fresh cut grass, pine resin. Some lemon and grapefruit citrus manages to sneak in there as well however. Taste is like a full scale blitzkrieg... hops just immediately attack the palate with various varieties managing to make their presence felt this providing some variability even if my palate sucks to much to figure out what exactly. Amazingly though some resin/earth malt manages to come on slowly and while maybe not balancing the beer, it at least provides some refuge. To say the finish is bitter doesn't do it justice. Really nice medium-to-full body on this thing too. For the first time I actually get what all the fuss is about these big hop-heavy beers... alive, sexy and slightly abusive but in a naughty I like it kind of way. OK I'm gonna go be alone with the rest of the this now."
"Pours a clear golden orange color with three fingers of frothy white head that slowly dissipates leaving lots of sticky lacing - can see each sip like reading rings on a tree stump. Intense fruity aroma with hints of grapefruit and pine trees - hops dominate this beer. Very dry and again the fruity hops are dominant with just a subtle malt character subsumed beneath it all. While intense, I appreciate the seeming restraint from an intense brewery like Stone - they don't overdo it here. This beer has a medium-heavy mouth feel, definitely a sipping beer."
"Pours a golden copper in color with a huge frothy head. The lacing that was left on the glass wouldn't even rinse off. Smell is hoppy, of course. There are plenty of varying hops in the taste. I would prefer more of the citrusy, juicy hops, but this beer gets it's name because of the bittering, tastebud crushing hop variety. This is a good all around beer. Mouthfeel is good and not tiring."
"Wow. Aroma is beautiful. Obviously expected this to be heavy on the hops, and it is with beautiful flower and perfume aromas. Malts come in the form of a bit of hay and nuts, but it is light. There is also honey and a bit of oak. It pours with virtually no head and has a slightly hazy body clarity. The color is a rich, peachy orange. Flavor is amazing, and your first sip really is the best, you can never get the same jubilation from drinking more (trust me, I tried). The flavor starts lightly sweet and then goes into a heavy bitterness. Mouth feel is oily. This brew has an intense, complex character, that in reality stays awhile, but I want it to last longer, to have that taste with me forever!"
"This is one over the top beer. A bit much for a night cap, as I tried to do, but definitely one I'll have again and again, I'm sure. I had this on tap once, and it was amazing. The fresher, the better with this one."
"D-This is one tasty beer going down. Could definitely drink more than one considering the low abv for the style."
"S: A very citrusy lemonade style ipa that was enjoyable but lacked complexity."
"A-maze-ing."
"Drinkability is high because the alcohol is barely perceptible and the hops are sweet-over-bitter, the malts are surprisingly present for a DIPA, Stone RUI is always a great choice and its been a treat to sample this aged version, the hops have held up well over time much like is seen in some of the older Stone Anniversary beers, I'm always coming back for more of this!"
"D: Like budda. I drank this all night. I could drink this all day every day."
"This is about as good as my favorite Celebration Ale with a little less richness and spiciness. Mouthfeel is rich enough, incredibly smooth and drinkable. At 7.70 abv, this is about as drinkable as a Double IPA gets. Really enjoyed this one."
"d: This is a very good example of a style I'm getting tired of."
"D: this one is kind of an alcohol bomb, but it finishes rather clean, which lends itself well to drinking it way too fast"
"O: Very good"
"Pours an nice dark amber color with very nice head and good lacing. Great hoppy scent, almost over whelming in it's flora. Excellent taste, very hoppy. It has a dry hopped taste as well, and finishes with a nice bitter aftertaste. Goes down fine, but a little dry at the end. A very good IPA."
"I am drinking this one in memory of my buddy Rick; I just found out he died yesterday. He and I drank A LOT of beer together and he taught me to make moonshine like the best of 'em. This one is for him. RIP dude. Gonna miss you."
"D- Very bitter. This better be your last beer of the evening because as the bottle says, it has an """immediate ruinous effect on your palate.""" I couldn't drink this frequently or have more than one at a sitting."
"oh yea man. I like this yet then again I'm a hop junkie."
"D - I expected more pronounced flavors in the taste, but the aroma spoils me. See Hopsickle for a complete ruination beer."
"The taste delivers on the bottle's promise: """A liquid poem to the glory of the hop.""" Fresh, resinous, sticky alpha acids immediately coat the palate. Juicy, fruity, malty notes round out the complex brigade of flavors. Ruination definately blasts the mouth with a ton of hops; I've had more initially punishing IIPAs before, but this brings the goods for a loooong time after you finish the beer. Drinkability is top notch, it's complex, tasty, and a hop-lover's delight. I'm glad I have a few bottles left...DISTRIBUTE TO NORTH CAROLINA ALREADY!"
"Poured from 22oz bottle to goblet. Pours a dark golden color with light cloudiness. Nice bubbly cream color head. STRONG hop smell (some citrus with pine). First taste- wow you can taste the full hop flavor all the way up your nose. This one warms you as it goes down. Great flavor, great ffinish- nice and tight. Cant wait to try again. Would like to try it on tap."
"Thanks, bennetj17. Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack Goblet. Poured a light straw with a big head that mellowed down and stayed as a film all the way down leaving a little lacing. This is the first time I've had it in bottle even though I've had it on tap a couple of times. Everything seems milder. Aroma is of pine needles, mild grapefruit and surprisingly a real mild sweetness at the end of the nose. Taste is full frontal hops. Like sticking my tongue in a handful of pine needles but finishing with a balance of malt that I had not tasted before. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. Stone makes great beer. Period."
"Another full-flavored, ultra-rich beer from Stone... their Ruination IPA is perhaps the ultimate example of an extreme Imperial IPA... appearance is copper/golden and the aroma is literally bursting with strong hops... upon opening the bottle, you are greeted with an extreme aroma of rich hoppy flavor... taste complements the aroma, with hop richness and bitterness pulling through... very bitter aftertaste with strong astringent taste... decent mouthfeel but average drinkability due to the extreme hop sensation and hefty 7.7% ABV... really good, full-flavored stuff, but really powerful to the point of almost being overhwelming... a potent beer with full-flavor chracteristic typical of Stone... If you're a fan of extreme IPA's, you will love this one..."
"Dry but well-carbonated and full-bodied mouthfeel, and ridiculously tasty. This one should be avoided by anyone afraid of a little bit of hops; it should also be avoided by anyone not afraid because it is ridiculously easy to drink for such an """extreme""" beer... Very solid and in my experience the best of its style."
"Bomber from Coit Liquors in San Francisco. Pours a cloudy golden orange with a whiter-than-white head, which leaves generous lacing to the last drop. Lovely fresh hop aroma, with notes of citrus. The flavour is packed with hops, and grapefruit and pine elements. The bitterness is actually very manageable and bracing. The finish is smooth and dry, with a huge dose of bitterness that lingers longingly in the mouth."
"Pretty smooth but quite sticky. Heavy in body and not particularly drinkable from the hop explosion."
"Now that I've lived with it for a while, I can honestly say it's bit of a novelty beer. It's amazing at what it does, namely, assault your nose and mouth with one of the most intense beer tasting experiences around. What it doesn't do well: it doesn't go well with food (too dominant), and it's too big and kick ass to be a good session beer. I can't imagine drinking three or more pints of this without having my tongue and nose go numb and possibly inducing some kind of permanent sensory deprivation. For serial drinking or drinking with food, the other Stone offerings are actually better, more balanced choices. But once in a while, you just need to be tied up, spanked, and forcefed until you cry out with the safe word. For that, break out the Ruination and start begging."
"Pours a neon cloudy kumquat, with minimal head.Nose- sweet candied tropical fruit. Taste- hop blast to the tongue. Pine, grapefruit rinds and mango. Doughy malts keep the hops in check and a creaminess to the mouthfeel. Hops are very drying in the finish and makes the palate crave more. Truly a classic west coast hop bomb. Carbonation is medium and drinkability is high. Great stuff"
" Taste.. Very hoppy with flowery notes as well as a nice malt flavor."
"for the next one."
"Nice pour, not much head. Bought it on a whim w/o prior knowledge of the beer or brewery. VERY impressed. Tastes great (all the hops you can handle), feels good going down, leaves a little bite to enjoy post-swallow. $16/six-pack in Essex County, MA."
"M/D: Mouthfeel is very nice. Carbonation is noticable but the body is medium-light and feels good on the tongue, with not hints of alcohol. Drinkability is perfect, very refreshing beer."
"Stone Ruination is a must-try for any hopheads out there, it is a perfect example of a hopped-up west coast IIPA. Besides that, it also hides the alcohol content extremely well, and every bottle has a bottling date stamped on it so you know that it's fresh."
"Pours a wonderful clear straw color- foaming a bit. Aromas burst out of the glass, floral and citrus all around. This beer packs a punsh (obviously), but unlike other Imperial IPA's, there is a smoothness to this beer that almost mellows out the intense bitterness a bit. Just a great flavorful beer, and seemed very fresh."
"The hops will bring me back to this beer again. Stone has done an incredible job with making this beer completely over the top and yet incredibly good. At $5+ a 22oz bomber and being such a tastebud scorcher, it's anything but a session beer, but it's not enough to drop down the drinkability in my opinion."
"Pours out a hazy golden amber beer,with a moderate head. Has a raw hop smell,,what i mean by raw is, is that it smells like hops in the brew kettle. Taste is sweet with lots o hops,,im not sure what type but theres tons of em! Initial sweetness leads to a slow lingering hop bitterness.Mouthfeel is a little bold,,not too much. Drinkability is good,,but i think one or 2 would be sufficient. The longer i drink it seems the hops get a lil monotonous { and i love hops} but im not sure that whats used in here are exactly my faves. Not bad at all but given the choice i would prefer 90 min IPA."
"Notes: Definitely one of the better double IPAs out there and it gets props for being on of the easier to find ones. This is also my first review for BA, so yeah!!"
"NB I'm a little concerned that my impressions seem to be quite different from most other reviewers, so take this particular review with a grain of salt. Hopefully I'll get to rereview this one."
"one doesn't have to be a hop head to enjoy this although liking hoppy beers would help."
"The mouthfeel is held together by the spicy and bold hop flavor and body. There is a surprising amount of smoothness to this IPA too. Very nice and tasty."
"Drinkability: This is NOT a marathon beer and after one or two your taste buds will be shot. Oh well, you can't have it all."
"Pours clear straw with a one finger head and strong lacing. Nose is light - lighter than the Stone IPA. Has a mild citric smell. Flavor carries heavy citric tones with more bitterness throughout. I am drinking this one right after the Stone IPA and I find this one to be more robust and thorough. The IPA is a bit tamer and this one is a bit..."""harsher", shall we say. I give them both the same ratings because I feel they are both different, but the same in quality."
"Enough has been said about this beer, but another two cents won't hurt. Everything about this beer, from the massive aromatics to the complex taste, is magnificent. On draught in a snifter, in a six-pack... This beer is partially responsible for pushing a few of my friends to beer appreciation."
"I finally decided to try this brew over the holiday weekend. Yeah, 999 reviews as of this posting. It is one heck of a hop bomb but unlike a one note song, this one has a great nose and layers of hop effect to create a killer one two punch. If hops is your thing this should be a must try."
"Clear, golden honey color, 1/2""" eggshell-colored head with good retention. Smell is rich, chewy, piney hops, sweet malt, and a hint of medicinal alcohol. Taste is a blast of grapefruit and earthy hops, with subtle carbonation, delicious tingly bitterness, and toasty malt that keeps things from being one-sided. Mouthfeel is really perfect for having so little malt flavor; it's thick enough to keep the hops from abusing your tongue. Similar to Three Floyds Alpha King, with broader, more complex bitterness, and a touch less malt."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability: Pretty strong and hoppy."
"This beer defines a hop bomb. It really could use a little more malt to help balance. The hop shortage is probably due to Stone Ruination. If you don't love hops, then don't even touch it. As for me, I won't have any trouble finishing this bomber."
"I know everyone loves this one, but I would not put Ruination in my top 10 DIPA's... too one dimensional.. and yes I know that's what the Stone boys were inetending... but I would appreciate a touch more malts."
"Taste is very up-front. A slight hint of orang peel, grapefruit, flower, and green stems is slammed out of the way by the bite of the hops. Tingy. Almost like a spice bite, but more crisp. Nice flavor hides the alcohol. I bought a bomber, so this is gonna be a battle of my taste buds with the hops. A bit hard to drink this big bottle."
"If you're a hophead you need this beer if not, why are you reading this?"
"This beer will cut through your palate and replace it with damn hoppy beer in no time flat. I If you think there's no such thing as too much hops, try this beer. You'll discover just how much of a hophead you really are.t is ludicrously enjoyable. However, it is exceptionally dry and strong, and you won't always be in the mood for it. It is an IPA, but one made with no regard to anything but itself. This is everything but a neutral beer. You will either find it disgusting or worship it. When you are in the mood, this beer is will hold its own as one of the most lovely aggressively hopped beers out there. As insanely hoppy as it is I find it pleasuring and satisfying. Brutal!"
"The beer goes down well, maybe too easily, for the 7.7%. A great beer and worth it."
"I find this beer surprisingly drinkable, despite its intense characteristics. As artfully crafted IPAs go, this beer is not as intimidating as its label suggests, as long as you like hops."
"Again, excellent beer! Highly, highly recommended!!!"
"This beer goes down very well. You can sip it, or drink it more like a session beer. IPA's are not for everyone, and this one especially is quite heavy on the hops. In terms of taste, the alcohol is surprisingly not overpowering."
"Lucky enough to find a sixer of this at bevmo in san jose for 6.99. What a deal. Too bad I'm only here for a week."
"I tend to shy away from most Hop Monsters like this one because they're just bitter, bitter, bitter. I decided to give this a shot because of Todd Alström's review. What a great decision. Just wish it wasn't $14 a six-pack in my neck of the woods."
"I don't know if it was from all of the hops in this, but I was so relaxed after finishing a bottle. Great beer."
"D: Boy, I enjoyed this one. Get yourself some!"
"This beer is a pleasure to drink. I could easily have had another and will definitely be on the lookout for more."
"clearish orangey gold with an off white head that settled pretty quickly but left really nice lace. hops in the nose are georgeous. pine and citrus (grapefruit). only wish was that it had a little more of a solid malt backbone to carry the hops... i know it's a dipa, but my favorites still have that faint biscuity or sweet malty character for the hops to ride on. taste is delicious nonetheless. medium body with a nice, soft silkiness. a bit of a bitter finish, but really, really pleasant. pour me another please."
"I could drink this beer forever. I love it and if you dont there is something wrong with you."
"D - Great. For as strong and bitter as it is, this beer is remarkablely easy to drink. Drinking a bomber...could easily have another."
"All-in-All, this is a big beer. A big, hoppy, nuts, novel, American beer. I love it. If you don't like HOPS or having fun, stay away from this one. Because these guys don't deserve to be trashed or (and I can't believe how many people actually do this) poured out."
"D: This is what all other IPAs should try to emulate : a clean, smooth flavor profile with a strong, consistent hop presence all the way to the bottom of the glass - excellent beer."
"Quite a few DIPA's i've had lately just seem to be an explosion of hops , hops , and more hops, but not this time. This baby was great from the get go from sight, smell and swill ! Really well balanced for the style, creamy but not thick, piney/ citrusy with a cat urine quality that one would think would be a bitter bomb but just sits well and long enough to please not overpower. I really enjoyed this and definitely a returnable DIPA. Don't worry Durge, as i type this , Tom is on his way back from Yankee Spirits with another bomber of this and the Arrogant Bastard."
"D = I liked this beer but I would give it only slightly above average in drinkability. It is very bitter without having the full hops flavors I would expect. As a result, I would probably pick another DIPA if that were what I particularly wanted and I think it might grow old quickly unless paired with a nice salty food that would help counter the extreme bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is coating, but not overwelming. I'd love to have a good steak with this... I know I say that a lot, but this is a Definite food beer. Stone's Imperial IPA is a great beer. A new one for my favorites."
"Carbonation is just right. Nice and effervescent. Hops dance around on my palette. More please."
"at first glance in a glass this beer looks almost identical to boston lager. a clear orange with little haze. it smells sort of spicy and has a lot of aroma in my opinion although its about 4 months out of date its still great. the taste is VERY hoppy like sam adams times 10 with some citrus mixed in very well. if you love sam adams boston lager like i do this will be sure to top it on your list. i love it im going to drink another now"
"D - Pretty good, I could do a few before having to stop. They say it's a double but by how well rounded it is, you could never tell. I'm almost sad to say, but this is my new go to IPA. Very highly recommended."
"D- Decent drinkablility, higher than average alcohol content and the residual bitterness takes it down a little but it is definately a good beer."
"I finally stumbled across a source for this legendary brew in our area and am pleased that it lives up to the hype. It's mellow golden color lulls the victim into thoughtful repose, its nose a stark and mysterious, sharp one. The taste is as one would expect...a razor thin foundation of malt only serving as a launching point for the hoppy pyrotechnics. The flavor is complex and satisfying, but the medicinal quality of the hop oils in this one make the mouthfeel my favorite aspect. This heavy dose of lupulin also leads to the one less than awesome facet of this beer experience. The drinkability suffers, in my case, because great care is required to avoid the spins and drowsiness and thus it is, as we say, a """sipper""". But...I've got time. Top notch beer."
"My favorite Stone beer. Especially when you live on the east coast and manage to get a bottle that is just two weeks old. Medium Amber color with a thin white head. Nose of bitter citrus oils and sweet malt. Medium body with a sticky, lush malt feeling sliding over my tongue, delivering a blast of grapefruit hop flavor that I can feel on the sides of my tongue. The finish is like a glass of grapefruit juice without as much acidity."
"Will always recommend."
"Not much to say after 979 people have already said something about it. Pours out slightly hazy, light amber. Medium head. Piney hop aromas. Taste is utter bitterness, held barely in check by a slightly sweet malt core -- just enough to let you know this beer has some punch. Amazingly drinkable for 7.7 ABV and this many IBUs. The tongue hurts but wants some more. Fine example of a DIPA."
"Pours a apricot color, foamy white head settles fairly quickly. Smells very citrusy sweet , surprisingly not overly bitter aroma. Taste is absolutely amazing. A fairly well balanced DIPA. A nice bit of citrus bitterness, and just enough malty sweetness to keep it from being too overwhelming. Smooth, slightly oily, and very long moist finish. A very drinkable beer."
"I'll keep this beer in mind if I ever see it on tap somewhere, but I personally prefer the hops I love to be better balanced with malt. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the hops to dominate, as this certainly had everything else going good for it."
"D: This is a good IPA but I like others better. Glad to try it and would pick up more if the price was right."
"Mouth-happiness: It's IPA ..the kind to eat with spicy food....or the kind to drink all afternoon."
"D - This is a fantastic double IPA, another great Stone beer, it's a classic"
"Comment: I am not a hop head yet I enjoyed this brew. I was especially surprised to read on the bottle that it was rated by the brewer at 100 IBU (normally about 40 IBU tops my taste tolerance). The excellent balance and ABV of 7.7% made this among the finest IPAs I have experienced recently. I might not seek it out but I definitely will never turn it away."
"D-This definitely leans to the hop side of the fence but there is a good balance from the malt. This is a good hop bomb, and a bomb I wish was dropped in NYC more often. I think this is also a beer that can usse a bit of time to get some of the harshness out. Newer bottles tend to be a bit harsh."
"D - quite nice. For some reason its giving me a wheat beer feel. It must be the orange I'm picking up. The hops are real nice."
"I would say this one lived up to the hype. It's not for everybody, considering how bitter it is, but if that's what you're looking for, this is a great one to try. It's bitter but still allows for complexity. Careful with the amount of alcohol though, it can sneak up on you. Recommended."
"O - Overall this is a fantastic brew, one to seek out if you are a hophead!"
"D- intense. full of character. hoppy. awesome. but due to its intensity, this will remain a special treat."
"I could definatly have a few of these, if Stone ever came to Minny, this one could be a mainstay in the fridge. This (as far as I know) is the first beer I have tried with Magnum hops and it took a few sips to warm up, but when those flavors came through, wow they were good."
"Poued from 22oz bottle into a glass. First apperance is great! A dark golden amber, with a thick off white head, that seemed to last for ever. Aroma was a spicey hop, slight citrus. Taste was amazing. Lots of hops! I loved it. I had wished I bought me! A very easy drinking IPA. Finished very smooth. THis is amoung my new favorites!"
"Pours slightly cloudy pale golden with 1/2""" white head that leaves decent lace. Aroma of pine and citrus hops and bready malt. The smell is surprisingly earthy to musty with a hint of soap. The taste is moderately bitter with good hop balance and a medium to long-lived bitter aftertaste. THe mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy texture, moderate carbonation and a slightly astringent finish. I was a little surprised by this one. I had high expectations, considering I loved their 10-year, and I really like their IPA. The smell is a little too earthy. The taste is good, and I might buy it again, but it is definitely not my favorite double IPA."
"A very good brew."
"All in all, this is an absolutely wonderful double IPA. It is perhaps the most drinkable double IPA I have had and is now on my favorites list."
"Poured from bomber into pint glass. Probably could have done with a better glass but that was all that was available. Vibrant golden color, clear, with """average""" head and good retention. Very impressive lace left behind as the glass goes down. Smell is a bit week in my opinoin. Of course it is of hops but I think that theres almost too much going on here and it really distracts from anything particular. Taste is good. Not as bitter as I expected but strong hops tastes, some malt but mainly the hops. Somewhat bitter aftertaste with a touch of grapefruit, leaves a dry feeling. Good carbonation leaves it light and crisp and pretty drinkable beer. Has a nice kick too it, although while drinking I really didnt notice the alcohol after the bomber you're left with that warm feeling."
"D: I could drink this brew day and night. Would /really/ like to try it on tap."
"O: I do love Stone. The caption on the bottle cracks me up. This beer is well put together, but still makes a bit of a statement. Very drinkable, I highly recommend it."
"There's just enough hoppiness but not enough to overwhelm the palate. The grapefruit/citrus flavor is what I look for in an IIPA and this is no exception. Lots of lacing left behind in the glass."
"The ruination ipa pours a cloudy orange hued goodness. Cool bottle with a few paragraphs spouting their pride but no freshness date. The smell is very hoppy and aromatic. The taste is strongly bittered which was good. A tad on the alocholic flavor and it was toasty and creamy. In the mouth it danced happy and left a sweet date like flavor. One of the best I have tried in this style."
"D-I have had some wonderful IIPAs in the past. This is good, but not great in my opinion. It is aggressive, and loaded with flavor. For a hophead, this is definitely one to seek out, but I dont see a whole lot of distinguishing from many other great IIPAs."
"For those who havent experienced, it is well time you should."
"It pours a hazy orange color with a small, quickly disappearing head. Smells intensely hoppy, and leaves a nice tingle on the tongue. I could definitely see a couple of these bottles going down. Very well done!"
"D - A nice brew that I will likely have again. I was really looking forward to a bitter beast tonight, I was let down on that end, but I found something nice nonetheless."
"Cheers for this great brew."
"I love this beer. The only downside is having to pay rockstar prices to get it into my belly. Very strong hop aroma. Strong hop finish. Excellent color. And just and exceptional mouthfeel. I love to drink this stuff. I wish I could get an IV...keg to brain."
"I'm coming back and editing this one a couple years later, after experiencing a few dozen other IPAs. The taste on this one isn't quite as earth shatteringly good as I remember. The citrus flavor is moderate, but not strong, and the aspirin bitterness on the finish is a bit much. I know, it's all about the bitterness on the label, but this is a bit out of balance for me. A good IPA, but not the best I've had. I like a little more citrus and a little less mouth pucker."
"Another great beer I get to rate! Bravo again Stone!"
"I haved this beer so many times in my life, this time I pour from a 12oz bottle. Color golden orange just like always, and nice sticky white head. Smell fresh caralized candy pine smell with alcohol and spice. Taste flower resiny hop pine with nice citrus and hint of medicnal tonic. Mouth feel heavy handed hop bitterness gives this mouhtfeel a long chewy texture but more refined than rough. This beer is fun to drink but dangerous after 4 bottles your feeling pretty buzzed."
"For a beer that for a couple years would have come up short for me in comparison to some of the other Stone brews, this is now one of my favorites... coincidence that that happened after I moved to the West Coast and am perhaps imbibing a fresher product? Mmmmm... I'm thinking no...."
"An end note: this one will dominate your palatte. Your food won't taste the same...Forget about trying to taste any other beers after this one!"
"The beer pours a beautiful light orange color with very good head retention and lacing. On the nose this beer is DIPA perfection. One gets an incredible aroma of light pine, sweet orange citrus (almost Tang or orange cool-aide like), and noticeable bitterness. Just unbelievable. On the palate the beer is very good, but doesn't blow my socks off. It's another very good DIPA, with lots of orange citrus and hoppy bitterness. The beer is fairly light on the palate, though you know the alcohol is there. Still, it's not obtrusive, and the beer is not heavy on the finish. Very nice beer from Stone Brewing."
"One more note -- the color of the beer is really cool...when in the fridge the light shining through the haziness of the beer and the dark glass foreshadows what's to come once you poor it. Hazy, cloudy, dirty golden...on sight alone you know the taste will be sharp."
"This beer is what it is: a fantastic hop bomby double ipa. Delicious,"
"D- Not the most drinkable DIPA ive ever had but tastey and easy enough to sip on."
"Could have drank a lot of these, nice addition to a great Stone beer"
"Pours an apricot color with a big fluffy creamy 3 fingers of head that takes it time and laces sheets throughout the entire bomber. Smells of juicy grapefruit, rind, and a little pineapple. Taste is sweet to start followed by grapfruit rind bitterness then finishes with juicy pineapple. Medium in the mouth with good carbonation. Very good drinkability. Overall an above average brew but too common in taste."
"A army of hops hit the palate, with the malt watching the battle from a distance but it is present. I want to sip and savour this beer for days but that is not an option. I will definitely be picking up more when I make it back to the U.S."
"I will be buying this beer again. A great tasting beer, not the most drinkable, but I will have no problem finishing this bomber. I dont know if my end rating will show it, but I enjoy this IPA much better than the ones that are more balanced (i.e sweeter)."
"D: I would and will order/buy one of these again. A nice brew from Stone....can't wait to try the Imperial Russian Stout I just got....mmm"
"A staple in my fridge, I love this beer. Drinkability is a little on the low side, because it is pretty aggressive. I would recommend this beer for any one who is a hophead like myself, definately not the beer to convert a BMC kind of crowd."
"D: While the malts were more evident this time around, there was still a decent amount of hops in it. I woke up the next day with my stomach churning. The fact that there is a high IBU balance here as well as a decent ABV, you cannot pound these back. However, you might be able to hang out and sip a few, but that's about it. Eventually, the high IBU will catch up to you and you will regret it afterwards."
"One of the few hype worthy beers in my opinion. I feel it was a very wise decision of Stone to put this in to 6 packs since it just seems like a shame having so many of the great beers of the world tied up in bottles that leave you weighing how bombed you want to get before diving in."
"Overall, this is a very easy drinking IPA, although the ABV could easily sneak up on you."
"D- not for beginners but still damn drinkable for a 2IPA. try and enjoy this beer, no attempts to balance malts with this as with many other west coast 2IPA's"
"22 oz bomber into tulip glass. A: Golden orange, minimal head with a good amount of lacing. S:The malt up front is actually more prevalent that I expected, but its quickly subsumed under the hops; citrus, grass, some boozey spice. T: A nice sweet/bitter balance up front, giving way to a very cirtus/grassy hop character. M: Pretty average, less thick that I had anticipated. D: I think this one falls somewhere in between an IPA and a DIPA. Its definitely aggressive, but just not as aggressive as a single IPA. Its a good choice for those times when you want something with a bit more character than your standard IPA but you just dont feel like taking on an 11% monster. A great brew."
"Pours a crystal clear, bright orange/amber with a one-finger tightly packed white head. Lacing left all over the tulip glass (my wife prefers it out of a pint glass, but she's a novice - haha). Aroma is heavily that of citrusy/piney herbal hop aromas with a slight floral note powering through. Taste is overwhelmingly bitter hops, grapefruit and resinous pine notes, with a strong hoppy spice. Although it is strongly hopped, it is balanced well with toasted malt flavors and a slight caramel flavor. Definite alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is rather thick and slick, but the carbonation makes it tingly and easy drinking. Only the alcohol strength keeps me from quaffing this beer throughout the night, as I usually end up passed-out after three 22 oz. bottles, which is a good thing because otherwise it ends up being an expensive night of drinking."
"A very good beer overall. Pair this with a cheddar burger. A nice job from the folks at Stone for a balanced beer in an all too often overpowering style."
"Thanks to younger35 for a couple bombers and Zorro for a 12 oz. extra..."
"Incredible IPA! I have loved IPA's for along time now and this one surpasses them all. They weren't kidding when they said it would """ruin""" your palate for other IPA's. Incredible flavor, with real clean pour and nice thin head. Beautiful Beer!"
"Goes down ridiculously smooth and quickly if you're a hophead. It's just too damn tasty to sip slowly even though it should be because of the relatively high ABV."
"Drinkability- Ok I havent been the biggest Stone supporter in the past. I always thought they made pretty tasty beers, but not really great beers. The more Ive been drinking them lately, the more Im starting to change my mind. This beer gets better and better every time I drink it. Highly recommended. Probably the most balanced big IPA Ive had. Great job Stone!"
"Overall: I love Stone. They are aggressive brewers who make some of the best brews around. No doubt this is one of their best. I cut my craft brew teeth on Arrogant Bastard which will always have a place in my heart, but pound for pound this is the best of the bunch when it comes to the Stone's Hoppy Brews!"
"A very good IPA from a brewery noted for the style."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. This is a strong bitter beer that rewards the palate."
"I will be stocking up on this exception brew next time I'm out of state."
"D/notes: A double IPA that sets itself apart from its higher level competition due to light mouthfeel, sugary sweet malt, and relatively clean and non-dry finish."
"Overall-A really good beer, not as bitter as I expected from the build-up from others and on the bottle."
"D: Good for the style. Not unlike Stone IPA on juice. Recommended for the hop head."
"Nice grapefruit aroma and flavor. Nice IPA, just wish it had some pine or dank."
"I don't know what else to say. This is one of the best DIPAs I have ever had. It is a shame that these aren't sold in Texas. It was worth the wait, and it was worth the search. Find this one if you haven't had it yet."
"12 oz bottle pours a bright orange color into a pint glass. A creamy thick white head sits on top of this tasty brew. Smell is grapefuit, and pine, and it smells absolutely delicious. First taste of this beer is bittering hops, followed by a caramel malt that is a powerful one-two punch. Carbonation is strong and creates a very refreshing finish. One of my favorite IPAs, and right up there with Two Hearted."
"A double India pale ale standard."
" Exceptional."
"from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass pours a coppery clear color with a big foamy white head. smells of flowery piney hops. taste is very hoppy, a hint of alcohol and nicely balanced bitterness, this is an amazing beer. this is a nice medium-body brew with low carbonation and very good drinkability. definitely try this if you haven't yet."
"I just may have to head back to pick up another because the drinkability on this great IPA is outstanding!"
"Overall this is a great beer, a little pricey but that's what BA high reviews do. I would definately keep buying this, espeically in 6 packs would be great."
"It's at this point that I stop to admire the bottle and read the wordy label. I find Stone Breweries true to their word: this is one hoppy IPA as the assault continues to delight and satisfy. Keep up the good work Stone Breweries and thanks too for a bottle that's a devilish work of art."
"definitely improves as it warms, i would recommend taking this out of the fridge for about 15 minutes before pouring."
"Way too easy to drink with the high alcohol content. Yes, the buzz on this beer may be a bit over the top, but there are other beers getting more press that are far worse."
"22oz bottle I was always turned off by Stone's labeling, it never did anything for me. Which I know: Don't judge a book... but foolishly that's what I did. I've certainly missed out on a fine beer."
"Pours a solid copper color with a nice two fingers of fluffy head on top. Nose is strong on hops with caramel malt backing it up. Taste is similar. Hops and sweet malt are surprisingly balanced for a DIPA, with a good amount of grapefruit tossed in as well. Body is medium to full, with good carbonation. This one is fairly surprising for a DIPA. I'd almost expect it to be a second IPA, because, while not particularly hoppier than the Stone IPA, it has a quite different flavor (lacking in some of the sourness?). Because of this, I think it'd be a perfect beer to introduce people to DIPAs. It also makes it much more drinkable than a lot of DIPAs. It's a tasty beer that's in keeping with Stone's consistent excellence."
"D: Get real. I could drink this all day and all night. I'd be drunk as hell, but I couldn't be happier. Big props to the boys down at Stone Brewing Company. Excellent brew."
"As an aside on pricing, cult following, and perceived scarcity/value: the same Brown Jug that is charging $3.99 a bomber for this on sale is charging the indefensible price of $15.99 for a six pack of 12 ounce bottles. (Yet only $9.99 for a sixer of Stone IPA.) Do I really think they are paying 60% more for Ruination than IPA? Not for a second. They just know they can get a shitload for Ruination, so they do."
"Drinkability.... Still quite good.... This is a very good example of the style (ADIPA). You're not going to chug back 3 or 4 of these bombers in an afternoon.... but 2 wouldn't be out of the question.... to satisfy your inner Hop Head. The Bier Band highly recommends Stone Ruination IPA for the serious hop enthusiast. BMC Lovers... stay away!"
"Drinkability: This is a very tasty and flavorful beer. A perfect everyday drinking Double IPA. The alcohol is probably one of the big detractor for drinking alot of this."
"As good as expected. Brought this back with me from a trip to CA and saved it for a lazy Sunday evening. Hops are the key on this one, but actually tastes like it has a higher alcohol content than it does. Very well balanced and smooth. Heaven in a bottle (or, actually, a Duvel glass)."
"This is a hophead's dream. It pours a beautiful amber color and gives off a subtle hop smell. This is a delicious IPA, maybe the best I've ever had. It has a great balance about it's flavor. Not too bitter, and doesn't have a strong aftertaste. This is very drinkable, and recommended for any hophead out there."
"Drinkability: Awesome. Probably one of my favorite DIPAs at this point. Low on the ABV and high in flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. I could and would drink plenty of these in one night. To me this is up there with Double Simcoe, with better taste but not better aroma. One of the top 3 DIPAs I have ever had. Bravo."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dating info into my trusty pint glass. It was opaque orangish color kinda like a dark butterscotch. It had a smaller head that I expected but still decent. Good lacing. The aroma was of course insane hops - more citrusy than floral. Was a combination of smells but one of them I definitely didn't like so hurt the score a bit. The taste had the same problem. Starts off really good but has this weird aftertaste. Not sure but what it is but don't like it. Fortunately, it's not dominant enough to ruin the whole experience. Mouthfeel is good with nice hop attack. Overall, it's a good beer but that weird smell/taste keeps it out of the top ADIPA's for me. Need to try again to make sure a good sample but the review is for this bottle. (3.5, RB-TA, T, O)"
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a tan head. Aromas of cittrusy hops, and in the taste a dryer grapefruity hop taste. A extreme hop aftertaste and a dry end. A small stickiness and lacing on the glass as well. Hoppy, smooth, and hides alcohol quite well."
"I eagerly anticipated the taste of this ale while pouring it into a Dogfish Head ergonomic pint glass. It certainly looks like an IPA: the hazy orange color and the nearly white head attest to that. Speaking of the head, it seemed as though it was never going to subside. The aroma is a bit fruity, with apricots dominating, while the unmistakeable fragrance of piney hops wafts upward to the nose. It has a very clean, almost sterile scent overall. Now, the flavor: floral and hops with hints of grapefruit, especially while cold. As it warms, the beer develops less citrus fruit and more floral overtones. The finish is truly hoppy."
"Overall: Rates with HopDevil and DFH 90 as my favorite IPAs. Awesome..."
"D - Overall, this is a typical run-of-the-mill Double IPA, nothing exceptionally special about it. I'm glad I got a chance to try it though."
"Stone has done an amazing job of making a very hoppy beer which does not stand out as overdone."
"drinkability - increases as u drink it obviously. like the bottle says tho dont expect to taste another beer after it. u have to if your in the mood for hoppy then great. otherwise if u go from another style to this then not so great lol. but damn stones are just so quality and unique. and the bottles are so cool. they are just fun to drink"
"D- It's wonderful. There are very, very few IPA's that can do this to me... I was sitting here grinning from ear to ear and just savoring. You must try this beer. cheers."
"Mouthfeel was extra creamy,very full.syrupy and cloying in a good way.Amazingly smooth wouldn't want to drink a lot of this beer,but i could if i had to. Great double ipa makes me not miss the 10th quite as much. A lot of simularity. Must try beer."
"I can't say enough about the Ruination and Stone in general - this is a highly recommended beer. Since I got into their beers, I've been highly impressed by everything. Now if only they were easier to get on the east coast!"
"Overall, this is a great IPA. The malt is there, you just have to really look for it."
""
"D: Maybe more of a """taster's""" beer than a daily drinker?"
"D: Great, you wouldn't know it's a big beer. I remember first having this after buying a bottle at the Lee Vining Mobil on the U.S. 395 and CA - 120 crossing, attracted to the label, thinking it was some kind of local speciality, at this point knowing almost nothing about beer. It blew me away with an enormous, full bitterness, the likes of which I had never tasted. Now that I am more adept at tasting and drinking IPAs, and 2IPAs, I get a lot more nuance and character that wasn't there before. This is a world-class IPA, great job to Mr. Koch and all his ilk down at the Stone Brewery, I just love this stuff."
"I'm a freak for the hoppy brews, so of course I love this one. I'm only disappointed in that I have to drive two states to the east to find it."
"Cheers!"
"Was recommended this even though I don't particularly like IPAs. The guy who recommended is a coworker and he told me to smell before drinking as this will get rid of the bitterness typically associated with IPAs. He told me I would smell flowers and feel like I was standing on top of a mountain, and I gotta say he's right. This beer smells of a wide open meadow with wild flowers, and the taste is just as you would expect. This is a good beer that will get me to try more IPAs. If and when you get a chance to try this one, I would recommend it."
"HOPS! Ive never got such a huge whiff of hops as when I opened the bottle, it shot out into my nose. Pouring the beer the aroma was pure hops, might as well have thrown the flowers into a glass. The color was very nice, and a very nice head that it kept somewhat. Crazy lacing going on. The first taste threw me for a loop, damn that was a lot of hops. It definitely had that ruinous affect on my palate. I adjusted to the hoppiness at it became remarkably smooth from there, albeit still a blinding level of hops. Really smooth beer too, no alcohol burn, not too much carbonation, very smooth. I wasnt able to appreciate the malty undertones much though... Im guessing in large part simply due to my inexperience. The only thing preventing me from giving a better rating is that I cant see much more to this beer than crazy amounts of hops (which is not a bad thing by any means, but I want to save my top ratings for a more complex brew). Great beer, great Double IPA, lives up to its claims."
"D- Pretty damn drinkable for what it is. Sometimes this beer doesn't always do it for me- but on most occasions, it is a welcome beverage."
"a huge thanks to Intiqken for this beauty!"
"I tasted this side by side with another CA IPA of lower abv - this lost (tasted blind) This is a very big hop beer - but not up to the hype. I really like it, but try blind next to Green Flash or Pizza Port and you may surprise yourself."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Overall a good beer, but by today's standards this is a fairly generic, underpowered DIPA. Its """lightness""" compared to other DIPAs makes this considerably more drinkable."
"Drinkability - A good drinker, but not measuring up to the hype. This is my third attempt. Tried two other 22oz servings and my perception hasn't changed much. Not sure how this is getting on """the list""". Seem like the style has progressed past this """definition"""."
"D- It was very drinkable for the high IBUs. Normally it takes a higher ABV to mask the hops, but Ruination seemed to balance the hop bite with malts. A pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability: Because of the abrasive nature of this brew, it is not very drinkable and does not lend itself to excessive consumption. However, I can easily see this paired with sharp cheddar cheese as the perfect midnight snack."
"Pours a nice rich golden,with a one finger plus white head. Excellent retention,and lacing. Smell is of fruit, and piney hops.Body is on the thick side with just the right amount of carbionation. Taste is of pine and fruit,hopped for sure, but not overly bitter. Really good!"
"Drinkability: Not bad for what it is, but somewhat complex to drink many."
"Overall, this was a tasty brew that would pair well with grilled meats and veggies."
"Pours a good looking golden amber color with a big sparkly two-finger head that settles down a bit in time but leaves some sticky-looking lace in its wake. Smells hoppy, with a very floral piney/grapefruit aroma. More pine than citrusy here, but a very pleasant scent for sure. Hmmm... a big hoppy taste, but not quite what I was expecting. I mean, yes it's big and yes it's bursting with all sorts of hop goodness, but it doesn't really seem all that complex to me. The hops are almost overdone a bit, and what little malt character is present doesn't seem to balance things out very well at all. Sure, it's a tasty brew, if you like hops, but it doesn't add much to the whole double IPA movement sweeping the American landscape beyond being big and hoppy. Sturdy, almost creamy (but dry) mouthfeel. A drinkable beer, but again, only if you like lots and lots of hops. Otherwise, I honestly believer there are better, more evenly balanced double IPAs out there worth visiting. I'd take an Oaked Arrogant Bastard over the Ruination any day."
"$15.99 for a 6'er is a little more than I am willing to pay, even though my brain knows 6 at the brewpub is more like $30."
"General comments - I couldn't help taking this into my mouth in large gulps. I just wanted to fill my palate with this amazing brew to savor every bit of it fully. It is truly amazing! I highly recommend it."
"I wish I had another handy. And I wish I didn't have to get up at 5 AM tomorrow or I'd go and get myself another one."
"Overall fairly drinkable, not as pallate ruining as Stone purports. Decent pale ale, nothing spectacular."
"Poured out of a bomber. The brew poured a clear golden-orange color with a nice fluffy cream colored head which dissipated into a small cap. Not as much lacing as I would expect. The smell is of citrus/grapefruit, grapefruit rind, and caramel malt. The grapefruit hop flavor blasts your palate. a bit of pine and resin. The bitter blast is followed by a semi-offsetting caramel sweetness. Definitely not as sweet as other ADIPAs, which is good in my book. I find that overly sweet IPAs bring the drinkability down. This brew has a nice balance. The feel is moderately bodied and has a creamy feel. It is bitter but doesn't blast your taste buds. This is probably the best IPA that I have tried. I wouldn't want to drink a lot of these in a session but a 22oz bomber goes down nice and easy."
"At 7.7% this is still quite drinkable. One hell of a hoppy brew, but an outstanding taste that dwarfs other IPAs. All others pale in comparison."
"This is a hoppy beer that does mellow a bit as it warms. It pours a nice orange with some head and not much lacing. The smell is very nice, hops, sweet malts, citrus, grass. The taste is a bit too hoppy for me right out of the refrigerator, but as the beer warms its true character emerges. There is a very nice sweetness that complements the hoppy bitterness. It is medium to full bodied and the sweetness works with the consistency of the beer and reminds me of some of the weaker barley wines I've tried; we are not talking syrupy barley wine here, but there is some hints at it. The hoppy esters remain on the tongue and the after taste is not nearly as bitter as one would expect with this hoppy brew. This has been a nice change of pace for me, since I've been reviewing really bland Saranac summer ales the past few days. L'Chaim"
" Body is sticky, but not too thick - just about right for an imperial IPA. Highly drinkable for such a strong, bitter beer. Well done."
"Overall: This beer is a hop-head's dream come true. Leave it for the end of the night, though, as the name """ruination""" fits quite well."
"Big thanks to my little bro """The Major""" for hooking me up with a boat load of Stone stuff, still have the DB and the Russian IMP to try yet, oh boy! Well, I may be a newly converted hop-head. The bottle said if you are new to big hops maybe don't start here, well I am, and I did, and I don't regret it in the slightest. Amber in color bubbly head with great lacing. Smell is floral, citric, hops. Taste is great, not over-powering in the bitterness dept. and has a nice malt character. This is a standout beer and if anything may just """Ruin""" me for other IPAs."
"(But this is still better than the IPA, and for that matter all of the other Stone beers I've tasted other than the imperial stout.)"
"Overall, I liked this even more than I was expecting. Very drinkable. Very refreshing."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured a clear golden copper like color. About three quarters of an inch of thick bubbly off-white head formed. Smelled hoppy, piney, malty and bready. Taste was equally as pleasing. Nice smooth piney hops with short citrus tones. Nice malty character that balanced it out well . Somewhat yeasty and earthy. Had a bitter hoppy bite in the finish. Alcohol was very mild in the mouth. Medium amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel was full bodied, somewhat thick, and actually quite refreshing. Drinkability was good. A very solid brew from Stone."
"A nice white head tops this giant of an IPA off, with a nice lacing as the beer quickly vanished from my glass. The beer has a nice looking amber glow to it, and has a smell filled of hops and maybe some grapefruit? The front end of the taste is nothing but hops (maybe some caramel with it) as it rolls down your tongue, as the back end finishes with oranges and spices. Very drinkable, hard to put down, this beer feels great in my mouth, with little notice to the fact of the higher alcohol content. A good beer that I might be picking up more often."
"Having recently tried a wide variety of IPA's, I decided to give this bad boy (7.70% abv) a try. Pour was good, nice foamy head, amber color, slightly fruity smell. I agree with several other reviewers that it has a slight grapefruit-like taste. The flavor is hoppy and complex, but not too strong on impact, and no lingering aftertaste. It is a very smooth IPA, in fact, and less bitter than some. I enjoyed this beer a lot. Would buy again!"
"Light orange in color with some blonde hues and a creamy head that leaves lacing all over the glass as it's sipped. Hops are certainly present in the smell, with a metallic twist and a hint of melon. The flavor - hop attack! As intense as the taste is, there's something about it that makes me want to take another gulp. The bitterness lasts long on the palate, interrupted by the occasional tropical Gummi-Saver flavor to keep me going. I didn't get much of a malty backbone, but lots of pine and citurs. Be sure to train your palate before jumping into this one. (updated 8-29-08)"
"D- A great beer IMHO. The alcohol is there (7.7), but it is well hidden under the hops. This is another fine Stone product that I will have to try ontap soon."
"Overall a superior DIPA."
"This is such a great, mouthwatering IPA. The ABV is reasonable as well which makes this a very sessionable beer. I could drink this all day long. Great hop flavor but not overkill. Doesn't numb your tastebuds. Definitely give it a shot it's a fantastic brew."
"Mouthfeel is good, have to watch for astringency on a beer like this, but it avoids that well. Drinkability is great for a stronger, hoppy beer. I've gotten on a little run of pints of Ruination before and it doesn't get much better than this."
"D - oh, boy, I can't really expand too much on that. Yes, you can drink of this. This brew takes alot of levels of flavor, and amplifies them beyonf nuances, and ,makes them major playres."
"Pours into a pint glass, pours an amazing peach color with a fluffy head that leaves some thick and heavy lace. Intense smell of some serious hops very citrusy and weedy. Taste is also very bitter no alcohol detected adn simply well balanced for a serious tasting ipa, little bubbles of carbonation dance upward in the glass. The beer is very smooth and goes down all to well, I could drink this all day , """liquid sex.""" I can taste sweet nector followed by intense bitterness; awesome crafted and a damn fine ipa."
"Overall a great IPA and I'd gladly have seconds."
"Drinkability? Well. You know. You can't have more than one of these. Unless.. well.. we won't talk about that."
"Drinkability- Not great. As a hop-head, Ilove it, but a full bottle will give me heartburn. One is the perfect amount tho!!!!"
"Pours out a copper-toned marmalade with no bubbles in the body and a decent sized head that fizzles to next to nothing. I've had DIPAs with higher abvs that have better heads than this. Smell has a general sweet to it, with tons of citrus and earth from the hops. Has a medicinal alcohol smell, which is disappointing considering the relatively low abv on this one. This one tastes rather sweet and a little tart. Some toastiness is welcome. Loads of hop flavor. Tons of grapefruit and tangerine. Doesn't get really bitter, but there is a pleasant lingering bitter after each sip. This can't be 100+ IBUs. Has a slight medicinal quality which makes it not totally work for me. Mouthfeel is excellent, and what I typically look for in a DIPA. Moderate to full body with a buzzing carbonation. I like this as it isn't really over-the-top. Tasty beer, but the medicinal quality starts to work on me after a while."
"This is a tasty DIPA, but it is a bit similar to others I've had. There's a big, pounding influence from the pine and citrus hops, that is counteracted by a cloying sweetness. Earthy and biscuity, this beer wraps your tastebuds into submission, but that certainly isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel is oily, but crisp and full bodied. This is a drinkable beer, even at the high ABV. Overall it's an excellent, if a bit too standard, DIPA."
"Overall, one of the most bitter beers I've ever had! A little one-dimensional for my tastes but still good. Highly recommended for the hop lover."
"I had a small glass, and that was enough for me."
"Fresh 12 oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a bit over 1 finger head with moderate retention. Aroma is very nice with exceptional citrus aromas followed by sweet vanilla and some floral notes. Taste is a well balanced blend of hops with flavors of pine and citrus strongly present. Lots of hop oils and a little resin. Too out of balance with the crazy bitterness for my taste although I understand what they were going for here. It is a well made and well balanced beer, but I have had many DIPAs that are much much better."
"Mouthfeel was smooth, a bit sticky, and overall very nice. Drinks smooth and pretty easy for a beer of this magnitude."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper, light caramel color. Lots of foamy, soapy, meringue like head forms, gorgeous. Very sprucy hop aroma with some citrus notes; nearly no malt aroma appears. Flavor is simply intense. This one has got to have sat on tons of hops post fermentation, probably chinook and centennial. The bitterness is not balanced at all, but who cares, I've yet to taste a beer this hopped. It's simply hop candy, so good. The finish is slightly sweet, but nothing compared to other IPAs or DIPAs. I wish I could have this every day, but alas, I've only one bottle."
"All in all, an outstanding example of the style, if not my new favorite IPA/DIPA."
"Aggressive yet highly drinkable. A good thing that Stone started packaging this in six packs (though I haven't seen one yet). Body is light-medium with a slight prickle on the tongue from the carbonation. I absolutely love this beer, very similar to the regular IPA, yet not. Maximum IBUs and highly resinous flavors seperate the two IPAs. A must purchase for West Coast IPA enthusiasts."
"Pours a beautiful clear copper hue with an nice off-white head that sticks quite well to the glass throughout tasting. Smell is a sweet sweet citrus hop that tingles the nose with delight. I could smell this beer all day. You would think with a DIPA the hops would dominate the flavor, but Stone does such a great job of balancing the malt and hop in this brew. Starts with a bready-malt flavor that gives way to a powerful citrus hop blast. A good floral note lingers in the aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is a bit oily in the mouth. For a DIPA, this one isn't dry/bitter hardly at all which I really enjoy about this beer. So drinkable, maybe too drinkable...wait a minute, what the hell am I saying. Stone contiues to amaze."
"This ale is superb. My favorite hoppy beer so far in 2007. There's nothing in-your-face about this beer, although the label illustrates something a bit different. I found this ale to be posses a rather quiet strength that satisfies on all fronts. It even produces rather flavorful hop burps. Excellent!"
"Over-hyped."
"Overall, I recommend this primarily for proponents of very hoppy, bitter brews. I certainly plan on enjoying more Ruination in the future."
"Drinkability: As mentioned before the alcohol content makes it hard to drink more than 1 possibly on a weekend 2 bottles of this (they the larger bottles). However its a true pleasure to drink. I'm very happy with my purchase here, definitely recommended for hop-heads, but if you like a more moderate level of hops in this beer its not for you."
"Got my wish after my last bottle (wanted a fresh one). This is as fresh as it gets! A little rough (bottled version seems a bit more tame/domesticated). I didn't go to Stone for the tame stuff, though...."
"It pours a slightly hazy orange-amber, with a slightly honey-colored head, tight bubbles, but not much retention. Smells like straight up pineapple juice. Yum-o. The website says that it's Magnum and Centennial hops -- ah, Magnum. The taste is remarkably smooth for a 100+ IBU selection -- the bitterness comes and goes, or maybe it's always there, but masked during the middle of the flavor arc by the tropical fruits and the smooth malts. Steady carbonation adds to the smooth mouthfeel. If it weren't so strong (and you can feel the heat as you sip it), I'd hook this up all night. As it is, I think two is my limit."
"I am becoming very fond of the taste. it is by no means a palate killer, which i guess i view as a good thing. the head retention is also good, more than the first beer. I feel like the initial review is fair, but i do think this is a good beer."
"Pours a light amber, clear of yeast, with a fluffy head that fades to a collar but leaves a ton of lacing. Aromas of zesty, piney hops, passionfruit and a surprising, very welcome malt note: rich caramel malts with some spiciness on top, with just enough sweet smells to balance out the hops somewhat. On the palate, really smooth malts (some of the best I've had for this style of beer) of soft caramel make the first appearance, but after that it's all hops, with the malt serving only as a (very solid) base on which to build a huge, magnificent hop house. The bitterness is fantastic -- big and citrusy (lots of grapefruit, a bit of tropical fruits) and just a bit harsh, with a tobacco finish. Mouthfeel is extraordinary for the style -- huge hoppy, resiny feeling made more than tolerable by a huge malt component and good carbonation. If only more DIPAs were like this -- all the elements play well together, nothing is out of whack."
"D: Personally, the hop flavor was a bit much for me. I did like the initial flavor, but the aftertaste didn't sit right with me. It's still a decent beer though."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. Orange yellow colored hue with a nice tight bubbly foamy white head on nice retention. Aroma is strictly hops and citrusy at that. Very enticing. Grapefruit, citrus, grass, about all of the aromas in hop available are represented here. Very balanced beer. Absolutely delicious. Not too much of a """Ruinator""" but delicious nevertheless. A little out of balance and out of whack as things dont seem to meld very well, but a very nice beer."
"Pours a pure, light gold with good effervesence and a sizable, diligent head. Light hitting the glass shines in many directions. Ahh, the smell of hops invades the nose with a bittersweet complexity that makes the mouth water. The smell fades to a honey-like scent after a few sips. The taste is no secret, a bombartment of hops that come at you from all directions, but pleasantly. Strongly bitter finish and aftertaste. Biting in the mouth so you remember it sip after wonderful sip."
"I work in mass now, so my beer selction just grew. Poors a cloudy copper, with an avergae head, that quicky disapates. Smells of all kinds of hops, and a tad sweet. Piny hops, and lots of them also some citrusy hops in the taste, which has a bit of maltyness lingering. Feals like a Dipa should in your mouth, and still maintains a deacent drinkability. Quite a solid beer, kinda in a league of its own with the IBU's, but im not complaining"
"notes: this is a very hopped up IPA style beer, its correct for the style of a bitter DIPA its very over hopped to the point of being almost undrinkable, still with drinkability being its only downfall its worth sampling with others so it doesn't go to waste, if only it didn't have such a high IBU rating.... of course if it didn't it wouldn't be as fun nor adequate for the style"
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle. First off, bottle artwork and message on back is fantastic. Second, this is a beautiful beer in almost every sense. The only knock, drinkability, however that could be a knock on any DIPA, due to high alcohol content, but I wasn't complaining! This beer could certainly get you in trouble with its smooth yet hoppy flavor. This is up there with/perhaps better than the best DIPA's I've had, including DFH 90 and Victory Hop Wallop. Now if it only wasnt so expensive..."
"D: Although it is rather smooth for being 100+ BTU's I don't think this is a beer that I would be having more than one per sitting. The hop-bomb is nice but can get overwhelming after a while. All in all a very good DIPA."
"Thick and creamy, nice and well-bodied. Substantial. I can drink it all night long. Remarkably drinkable for such a hoppy IPA. So very enjoyable."
" Overall, a fantastic beer, plenty of flavor, but easy to drink with a strong front, and a nice light aftertaste. This one will be in my fridge again."
"A terrific IPA that is surprisingly balanced. The malt is actually there, and the hoppy onslaught is apparent at the close. Overall, its a delight."
"Pours a somewhat hazy orange color with a modest head of off white bubbles. Almost instantly upon pouring, the aroma of pineapples was detected. Sweet pineapple and a bit of sticky pine resin in the aroma. Taste is as expected. Massive pine and citrus hop flavors. Long, intense bitterness in the aftertaste. My mouth is watering after every sip. Hops overwhelm what malt may have been there to bring this up to 7.7%abv. Body on the light-medium side. Some alcohol in the aftertaste, especially as it warms. I loved this unbalanced, but still delicious, IIPA."
"I wanted something special to watch the Gators in the National Championship game tonight and man did I pick the right beer."
"Poured a rich golden color into an AleSmith pint glass. Firm and thick, one-finger white head with very little carbonation bubbles. Very clear. Smell is of a light citrus and toasted malts. Taste is more of the same with toasty taste followed by a light fruity taste. Piney hop taste comes out in background. Long, drying bitterness. Medium bodied, but somehow mouth-filling. Also is sticky with low carbonation felt. Drinkability is decent but not the hop-bomb I was expecting with the Ruination tag. Could have a couple of these in a sitting."
"This beer poured a hazy golden color with a beautiful thick head. The aroma is of hops  delightful and fresh. The flavor of this beer is dominated by hops, but there is enough malt to balance it nicely. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and perhaps a bit creamy. As for drinkability.this beer is delicious. I find that it is smoother than I had anticipated. I will definitely look for this again!"
"sweet (hoppy) dreams!"
"Where to begin. Finally able to get my hands on a few bottles over here on the right coast. Pours a golden amber with a great head that stays with you the whole way down, with a nice lace that stays on the glass. The smell and the perfume of the hops forcefully opens up your nostrils when you smell and open up to drink it. You can almost smell the grapefruit rinds, the citrusy smell is so prevalent. Pouring a bottle of this, you might be able to smell it in the next room. Hoppy-plus taste that isn't too dry, actually tastes a little more alcoholic than it is. Hard to differentiate this from the 9% Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. It has a solid malt balance, but the hops rule this brew. So aromatic, but I find this a little more drinkable than the DFH 90. A great brew for any hophead."
"This beer did not live up to reputation nor the name. Maybe the weak aroma indicates an old sample, no dating on bottle. I would like to try a known fresh sample, but this beer, while good as an IPA did not meet up to my standards for an IIPA nor did it meet up to it's namesake."
"Highly recommended. Classic West Coast Double IPA."
"Not the best Double IPA I've had, but pretty well balanced. A must for hopheads, all others could probably pass it without missing much."
"Despite the 100+ IBUs this is never difficult to drink - in fact it is quite the opposite. A favorite of mine out of the big IPAs - many double IPAs have a huge malt backbone to balance out the hops and corresponding alcohol levels at 9% or above - this doesn't try to be something it isn't. I'm not going to knock it, but the label isn't lying - it really DOES have a """ruinous""" effect on the palate, so drinking a bunch of this with numbed taste buds seems pointless. If you like untamed fresh hop flavors, this is for you. If not, don't bother. Nice that I didn't have to share this one, but it was my last bomber."
"drinkability: I could drink these one after the other."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This definitely has a strong, bitter taste to it. I wouldnt characterize it as a session brew, but I really enjoy drinking it. More than one bomber would be a push though. It does go down surprisingly easy considering its over 7%. Overall, its one of the top DIPAs Ive tried and probably my favorite out of Stones usual arsenal. Its fantastic and highly recommended."
"D - An extremely drinkable Double IPA. Stone sure knows how to make a beer. Ruination is definitely not an introductory beer. In no way is it overbearing where you can't drink it, but you have to be ready for the hops. By the end of the 22oz. bomber, I was wishing I had more, but I love hops, so it's all personal preference."
"A hop head's delight. Definitely another must have double IPA to add to your palate's pleasure!"
"Drinkablity: I could drink this beer for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Then maybe a couple for a nightcap. Love this beer!! The complexity really gives your mouth something to think about while all your brain can do is convince your arm to grab that glass and pour more in."
"I have had this a million times but it never gets old, I guess that is why sometimes I don't review a beer the first time I drink it - to make sure it is not an anomoly. This is one friggin solid brew - duh! I love you Stone - you were my first love and always will be!"
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Color was a slightly cloudy liht orange color, with a small white head. Smell at first was not so great, with what seemed like dishwater. As it warmed a bit though (not significantly) there were plenty of hops, some tangerine, and a bit of funk as well (oxidation?). Taste was perfectly crisp, with the hops hitting you up front, followed by some grapefruit and other citrus fruits. The lingering taste on this beer is ever so bitter, and damn pleasing. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light, however the hop profile is really in your face. Alcohol is not apparent really, though it does not need to be in that the flavors are all pretty extreme. This is one of my all time favorites for this style in that it is not too sweet like so many other double ipas i try. This one is bitter, crisp and delicious. Thank God it is readily available in this area. Cheers"
"What better way to forget about a hectic week than going on a new adventure. This beer surely qualifies. Once again, I have to give credit to Stone for crafting such a wonderful beer."
"22oz. bottle poured a cloudy golden color with a large white head that leaves a few specks of lace around the glass. Smells of citrusy hops maybe some grapefruit and pineapple. Taste of slightly sweet malt up front with a bit of a dry hop bitterness towards the end. The feel is somewhat light and has a bit of a stickiness to it. This brew is pretty easy to drink but I'm not a big fan of the flavors of yeast and malt they chose for this IPA and I'm sure that because of those flavors and the lack of a big hop presence that this bottle may have a little age on it."
"A dark amber color that fades to alighter shade towareds the bottom of the glass. A quater inch thick forms, that slowly laces down the glass. A fragrant floral scent is dominant at first sniff, then earthy and citrusy aromas gradually become more apparent. At first taste the malt is very definitive, and then it is overwhelmed by immense hop flavor and bitterness. Those flavors attack the palate and linger there for some time. A thin feel at the start, but it gradually becomes more hefty as it reaches the back of the throat. This beer is a hopheads delight, strong aroma and flavor make this a must try beer, for anyone."
"D: Can't wait to drink this one again. A utopian hoppy, offering that stands out from other IPA's."
"Drinkability: Welcome to hop country. This beer is lights out in terms of being able to drink anything else after but definitely one of my favorite beers. One in a sitting though, usually at the end of the session. Nicely balanced, comparatively speaking."
"This beer looks is a hazey orange and there is little head. The smell is hoppy and a bit of the alcohol shows as well. The taste is bitter and the alcohol deffinatly shows here. The mouthfeel is sticky and the bitterness last a long time. Drinkable, but be aware that this beer will warm your innards in a hurry."
"Cheers!"
"Tastes not so much in bitterness until the very end. Hints of citrus are stronger here than in the aroma wich does seem a little strange to me. Leaves a frothy feel in the mouth and a bitter feeling on the back of the tounge once swallowed. Lite in body and easy to go down, highly drinkable, highly recomended. All hail the hops."
"If you plan on drinking different beer that session save this SOB for last."
"D - Good for the ABV, I hardly noticed the alcohol at all."
"Fun beer to drink, but don't plan on more beers after it if you want to taste them!"
"gonna have to try more stone brewery beer considering how this one impressed me"
"the flavor is hopsack, citrus, pine, grassy, on top of a solid malty bed, resin, hints of wood."
"World Class . Fantastic ."
"d- very. this is a great entre to dipa for the non-inducted hop head."
"Drinkability: An intensely drinkable DIPA. Not at all overpowering, in alcohol or hops. As I said previously, would be an excellent introductory beer for the style, perhaps for those you know who are enjoying the """Single""" AIPA variety but have yet to take the """Imperial/Double""" etc. leap."
"Drinkability - While an good overall beer from Stone, I think I expected more balance of hops and malt. I really enjoyed the hop profile, but didn't feel there was the malt to back it up. Even with those criticisms, I did enjoy it, just can't rate it too highly."
"On first sip you definitely get the """hop bomb""" character, grapefruit citrus predominates the hop profile, but there's a lovely grassy and earthy quality as well. Liquorice/anise flavour comes out of the mix, and a Hefty malt backbone that's toasted and biscuity with a little bit of sweet caramel, but not too sweet by any means. Mouthfeel is just mildly carbonated, medium bodied and dry. Slides down like water and I wanted more as soon as I finished my glass. Dangerously hidden alcohol makes this one a lot of fun. This is a great IPA and one I'm pleased to have finally tried. Cheers!"
"D - First time sampling from a bottle, having consumed from tap several times...not as good from the bottle, but still a very solid DIPA. Of course, I recommend everyone to drink this...not the best I've ever had, but a great performer."
"A very worthwhile IPA."
"Hard to find in the Midwest but worth bringing home."
"Amazing. Think Stone's regular IPA, but make the hops more pronounced and incredibly fresh. Obviously lots of hopping at the end. Not overly bitter - the bitterness level stays at the regular IPA level. But, the wonderful taste of hops just dances on your tongue. You can't help to take another swig. Then another. I'm okay with admitting I drank almost a whole growler of this myself. That hop flavor also stays with you long after you swallow. That flavor, plus just the right carbonation level and and ever-persistent head make for an unbeatable combination."
"My other top pick of High IBU IPAs, Wildcat IPA, isn't as complex and has more acrid bitterness, but it is a sweet song of the hop flower none the less."
"Definately drinkable/sessionable brew for the hop heads out there. Highly recommended for someone looking for a tasty hop treat. Definately not recommended for someone who doesnt like a lingering, resinous, hop blast. Will gladly drink again, hurry up and get distributed in northwest wisconsin!"
"I enjoyed this beer, but doubt that I could session it with such a strong flavor profile and character. A: Color is of sourwood honey with thick ample foamy head that dissolves into lingering lace. S: Very bitter and hoppy with a strong ginlike juniper berry aroma. T: Grassy and herbal with hops punch throughout. The IBUs tick off with each sip. M: Nice viscosity and palate immersion. medium bodied with nice enduring feel. D: Excellent flavor but a big beer that is best sampled in moderation. Nice option for pairing a bottle with dinner. My personal taste is more for the Stone IPA, but Ruination was tasty even for this Malthead."
"22 oz. bottle- of clear honey, with a medium off white head - nose of piney hopps , floral hopps , lemony citrus , malts , and clean  taste of lemony citrus , piney hopps , resin , tar , earthy , and - body a little raw , and slightly acidic  aftertaste of hopps , and citrus (lemon)"
"poured into my st.bernardus glass bc it was the only clean glass in my house. nice light amber color and very hoppy smell. hints of citrus and the perfect amount of bitterness. i'm trying to think of an ipa that compares and the only ones that come to mind are dogfish head and some english cask imperial ipas which i can't remember the names of. first time i've tried it and will surely be back for more."
"I've heard a lot of hype about this beer, so my expectations were pretty high. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a copper-orangish color with a nice two finger sudsy head. The smell is a hop lover's dream. A range of hop smells from sweet and citrusy to floral and piney. Truly a treat for the nose. Taste is surprisingly sweet, nicely balanced with the intense hops. The alcohol does come through slightly in the aftertaste and has a very dry finish. This is a full bodied beer with little carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but I think the dry alcohol finish is not overly desirable. Not a bad beer otherwise though, worth trying if you love hops."
"drinkability: at what I perceive to be an aged stage for this beer it still has a lot of nice characteristics, I am sure at a fresher stage it really hits the mark of an American DIPA,"
"A thing of beauty and it'll ruin you for most, this is the IPA of champions. It pours a nice copper amber, with a good head. The aroma is pour hop heaven (or hell). It's not over the top, just right for a seasoned hop head. The taste is intense, and very bitter, like a mugging, but by a bunch of sexy ladies. There is some malt, but it's just a pale glimmer to the heap of hoppiness. It has an excellent mouthfeel, not heavily carbonated, but just right. This is very drinkable, I would have rated it higher, but it's not for little boys. This is powerful stuff, and needs psychiatric and well as age verification to imbibe!"
"I got this bottle at Michael's Deli in King of Prussia, Pa. I poured it into a perfect sized pint glass. It poured about two fingers of head, that was nice and white and fluffy. It had medium retention. The color of the body was a nice amber that was cloudy toward the top. The smell was a citrus hop. The taste had a nice spicy bite to it. The mouthfeel was very smooth, yet not thick. A wonderful brew. Don't drink and review."
"I don't know if I just got a bad bottle from a bad batch, or what. Generally, phenols come from a bacterial infection due to poor sanitation. Given other reviews, I would definitely try this again, and hopefully it will be better."
"This is my for dipa I've ever had. Very light crystal clear orange color. Decent head at first but barely holds. Smell is that of yummy citrusy hops...a lot of grapefruit, lemon peel, orange, and pine. Taste is only slightly malty at first, the a rush of hop flavor and then a smack of bitterness. I don't think I would drink this beer that often. Don't get me wrong, its very good for what it is...but I'd rather stick to barleywines. All in all a very good brew from the wonderful people at Stone!"
"Bomber. Poured into a pint glass. Color is a gorgeous a golden, clear amber with nice head formation that leaves plenty of lacing. Smells floral and citrusy - actually, that really understating it. This smells delicious. Tastes like grapefruit upfront with a hoppy kick in the middle and a malty finish. This is very complex all the way around, but oh so tasty. Nothing wrong with the flavor - it is very bitter, though (which is a good thing!). There is a little too much carbonation here - it's a minor complaint, but nonetheless - it negatively effects the mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable DIPA, if you don't mind the bitterness. Highest Recommendation."
"An old standby I have yet to review. The relatively thick syrupy body leads me to believe this is a few months old, but it's strength has held it up just fine, as it has plenty of carbonation to cut through. Hoppy and resiny, but not very bitter. Fruity, simply bursting with fresh cut red mangoes; they're all over the nose and taste. Fruity hop aftertaste you can smell for minutes. Perfect sized ale body. Very good double IPA. Cheers!"
"D: At 7.7% abv the alcohol content seems pretty low for a DIPA. This translates to an easy drinkability that means you can just sit back, relax, and let the complexities of the beer wash through your mouth. The alcohol flavors are inobtrusive and do not detract from anything going on here. Excellent."
"D: I'm a Ruination fan for life. A very clean, refreshing beer and wickedly drinkable. The 7.70 ABV is noticeable but not cloying in any fashion. Hop heaven in a bottle."
"This is a beautiful, perfectly crafted beer. The color is clear orange copper. The head is thick and bubbly and lasts to the bottom of the glass leaving white lacing all the way down. The aroma is wonderful, hoppy and sweet. This is exactly how beer should smell! The mouthfeel isn't the least bit watery or thin. I can't say the taste is complex, but it is perfectly balanced and absolutely flawless. Other beers--even high quality beers--with about the same alcohol content are more noticeably alcoholic, the alcohol here is tucked away nicely and only shows up as a lingering euphoria after the beer is gone. Stone crafts their beers perfectly and this is a great example of their work."
"A 22oz bottle . This beer was an orange color with a medium head. Hops in the nose, all flowery and woodsy. A hoppy taste, but not as aggressive as I expected. The label said >100 IBUs, but I thought it was a pretty smooth ride. Substantial, but not overbearing mouthfeel. A nice beer."
"On the label it says that Ruination """rose from the ashes of the Stone Anniversary beers""" and that isn't hard to believe. It's not as complex, but it has the same sort of character, just toned down a bit. This results in a superbly drinkable offering from one of the best damn breweries to ever grace the planet."
"D: For what the beer lacks in taste, it makes up for in drinkability. The 7.70 % ABV is non exsistant, and I want more right now. Interesting take on the DIPA style. Recommended drinking."
"A very tasty and well made DIPA. Absolutely worthy of the Stone moniker of excellence. Very glad I finally got to try it."
"The first thing I have noticed about all of the Stone beers I have tried is that it starts with a huge head and wonderful lacing. They have this down pat. The fragrance is very piney. The flavor is more complex, with hops and pine backing. This beer screams of summer to me, and is pretty much my drink of choice around the grill. The flavor opens up as it warms and with summer grilling in Phoenix this is a big plus. The only downside to this beer is that it does ruin you taste buds. Another reason I like this when I am grilling something with big flavor that can punch through."
"Ordered some Ruination online to fill my refrigerator with DIPAs. This is a solid DIPA and one of the early leaders in the style. It's tasty and good for your hop jones. I must be getting more numb to hops, 100+ IBUs and I say """it's hoppy, but not really super bitter!""""
"Pours a deep cloudy orange with a small creamy head that quickly faded but left a bit of lace. Smell was hoppy heaven! Pine and strong citrus overtones are really all you can smell. The taste was right behind, just up in your face hops! Truly a DIPA if I have ever had one. Not as strong on the alcohol as some others which made this much more drinkable, which could be a problem with the high ABV. Could drink this everyday, truly a great beer and another treasure from Stone!"
"While I found this to be a very good, quality beer, I was also disappointed. After reading the rear label, boasting about how this brew will essentially kill your tastebuds due to its obscene hoppiness, I actually found the hop characteristics to be a bit weak. Not the """ruination""" and obliteration of taste that I had expected."
"Another beer sitting in the cellar that finally came out a few nights ago. Everyone at the Carolina Brewmasters flocked to this beer when I opened it up. I'm very glad I shared because although it's truly excellent in so many ways, it's difficult to finish or even get halfway through. Probably one of the hoppiest beers I can recall but just a fantastic style from a fanatastic brewery. Definitely need to pick some more up."
"The drinkability is also very good, I could go on drinking. No need to stop. Prosit Mk"
"Drinkability? Well, this one could certainly be the ruin of me. One of the most pleasurable beer drinking experiences I've ever had."
"22oz bottle. Pours a light golden straw, with little carbonation and no head. Beautiful aroma of floral hops. First taste is a bit of a surprise, in that I am not being bowled over by sweetness and hops - but I love it! My only other Stone experience was the Stone 10th Anniversary - and that one did bowl me over with hops. This one is very hoppy - don't get me wrong - but it's much better balanced than I was expecting. It goes down the throat perfectly and leaves a wonderful hoppy aftertaste that keeps on giving. Some of the extreme American beers have been too sweet for my untested Canadian palate, but this one is really very, very nice."
"A big herbal mouthful of hops, but not as complex or bitter as advertised."
"This one rings in at 100+ IBU's. Want a hoppy beer? Well, here you go...But, it does have enough malt and yeast that the hops aren't all over the place. A wonderfully hoppy treat! As nice as it is, though, it is a bit """over-the-top""" and serves as an occassional hop-treat! I definately recommend trying - esp. if you're a """hop-head"""!"
"Stone certainly doesn't disappoint here. Very complex in flavor, holding nothing back. A must try for hopheads, but not for the uninitiated."
"Poured into wine glass, despite the vessel the head is a foamy white color, with nice lacing. The body is a thick purpley maple syrup color, almost mahogany. Smells of subtle floral scents from the hop's contribution. The malt seems to take a wonderfully supportive role, balancing the lush hop presence. Some grape fruit, pine, citrus even toasty notes. The taste is much the same, with notes of toasted barely, subtle sweet malt, tons of refreshing hops. It's a dry, floral start, matched with mild sweet malt, the finish is the best very refreshing, second only to wonderful burps. This definitely lets the hop take over, in my favorite double IPAs there is a bit more sweet malt, but this is still a kick ass brew. Undoubtedly drinkable and worth a try."
"Taste was rather piney and sharp mix of different hop flavors. Massive flow of hop flavor but equally buttery and citrusy at the same time. Nice mix of hop flavors overwhelmed my palate. I knew what I was getting into but not for the faint hop experience. This beer brings the hop bite. Nice flow of hop tones from start to finish. Very floral and citrusy at first and then trails off to a nice dry hop finish. Mild hint of malt somewhere lost in the back ground. This beer has a tasty and refreshing hop flavor that is surprisingly tolerable. 100+ IBU count is very much there and blends very well throughout the beer. It is has an enjoyable hop taste that really does take over the pallet. If you were eating any dinner it may not taste the same after this beer. You may want to savor this selection alone. It is very well constructed and enjoyable not an overpowering smash in the mouth hop flavor. It is a controlled anarchy of hop fusion. Great brew with a good drinkability. This one is certainly worth a try any day of the week."
"Great honey/ambrosia color. Great, bright white head that slowly dissipates to bright layer of foam. The foam is kept intact by the plume of great bubbles rising to the top of the brew. And sheer magic makes that heavenly foam stick to the sides of my glass. Great malty, hop juicey aroma meld together in my nostril cavity. Mkaes me think of mommas biscuits melded with fresh wild flowers and citrus zest. The a great medium hop allure makes a malty melange of strong bitter and bready malt."
"Drinkability: One of the most drinkable double IPAs out there. Too strong to session, but not so strong that you couldn't easily enjoy a pint or two."
"I actually liked this more than I thought I would. Thanks to Ding for bringing this to me."
"Notes: I won't lie, I was skeptical of this beer living up to the expectations set by many beer lovers and BAs. Once again, BeerAdvocate has proven to be a source to be trusted. This beer astounded me with its balanced, nuanced flavor. Definately a benchmark for the style."
"I picked this bottle up, as well as a couple others, on my recent trip to Michigan. Can't wait till my next trip so that I can pick up some more of this, and Arrogant Bastard."
"D-Ok this stuff is OUTSTANDING.This is in my top 3 IPA'S.This stuff I think is just about on the verge of becoming a Barley Wine, you guys should know the taste of them.This may be the most hop I can take.I may have met my match.This stuff made me wail my hands in the air.VERY GOOD AND RECOMMENDED."
"Poured out nearly crystal clear gold color with a fairly big white head, nice lacing. The nose is all about a huge wave of hops, strong alcohol aroma, and a big grapefruit aroma, although not as much as some other IPAs... Tastes of full force hops, grapefruit, citrus peel. Fairly bitter, but definitely drinkable. A tad too much alcohol for me. Perfect amount of creamyness, sweetness, and carbonation. For a huge beer, this is drinkable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"From a 22oz bomber. A great beer, not as bitter as I thought. Great drinkability, I could down a few bombers without a second thought. Very hoppy with a slight alcohol taste, definately recommend trying, tons of hops, but very balanced."
"despite this very nice nose, I am underwhelmed by the taste. something rather bitter and a bit skunky rises to meet me, the citrus-like hop profile from the nose, while still notable in smell, is not the dominant aspect of this beer. After similar notes in the normal stone IPA I wonder if they are using a hop which is prone to tasting like this. given the IBU profile of this beer maybe all of this is normal, or my palate is more sensitive than most, though I enjoy many double IPA's normally."
"My taste buds were numb for a long time after this beer. I could taste NOTHING after this beer was done."
"Drinkability/Notes: It about time I got around to reviewing Ruination. I've had this beer more times than I can count and it never ceases to amaze. A hop heads delight. Big time citrusy hops dominate but the malts do make an effort to bust through just enough to make things interesting with a fruity/candy like sweetness in the middle. Definitely one of my favorite DIPA's, not as sweet as most with a rather dry finish which I really like. If it wasn't for the 7.7% abv I could put these back all night. Just an outstanding beer in my opinion regardless of style. If you haven't had the pleasure to try Ruination, seek out and enjoy. Another fantastic beer from the folks at Stone. Highly recommended."
"drinkability is good, but the palet decimation factor is high. don't switch from this to something light and delicate, but it's definitely a hophead's treat."
"Slainte!"
"The bottom line: if you like IPA's, Ruination is a fine thing to have in your pint glass. A strong, varied hop presence, and an overall solid beer all the way through."
"Upon emptying the bottle, I wish I had another. This would also be an amazing beer to pair with sharp, bold, and spicey foods. God damn its good."
"Presently a huge fan of Stone's IPA, and special order at least a case a month. Saw this solo bottle and picked it up, hoping to be hopped into oblivion. Aroma, pour and mouthfeel are all similar to the IPA, and at first the taste was indiscernable from it. That qiuickly changed as the hops took over my tongue and would not let go. Was very impressed as the hops seemed to grow in strength even after swallowing. Paired perfectly with the tailgating fare available. Would drink this more often if I wasnt afraid of permanently damaging my palate!"
"D: Eminently drinkable. Highly recommended. Anyone who likes good IPAs will fall in love with this beer."
"Overall, this is the most delicate and flawless presentation of hops in a double IPA I've had so far. The bite is there, but softened and enlivened by the lightness on the palate and light sweet malt backbone."
"I can drink this all night. It truly is """a liquid poem to the glory of the hop!""""
"Medium bodied and surprisingl;y smooth and drinkable. No detectable alcohol, just hop juice deliciousness."
"I was worried that I had left this in my cellar too long but damn it still delivers even after 6 months. The pine resin is so damn aromatic and delicious. Butter toast and caramel follow. Rich and creamy, very bitter. Grapefruit enters too. Light on the carbonation, thick bodied. Brilliant orange color. Super drinkable. Super rich. This is just a fantastic brew."
"First sip is nothing but hops, an astringent bitterness. Not as brutal as I expected, it is still rather cold though. This IPA definitely has a hop profile to the max. Hard to get any of the malt to come through. I've had IPA's that are all hops with thin malt backbones, this IS NOT the case, just having a hard time getting through to it. A vigorous froth sweetens it up. Ah, there it is, the malt is revealed. I also get citrus hop characteristics coming through now also. As I sip and drink, I ask myself where's the punch I keep hearing about. Then, I start to get this feeling in my mouth. The feeling like I've been chewing on high Alpha Acid hop pellets! This is only my second Stone brew and I was expecting some kind of unruly hop knock-out. The after-bitterness is very distinct. As this IPA warms, the hop-numb becomes a little more pronounced. The huge amount of hops are almost layered, they do not jump right out in one big hop-smack. I am impressed with Stone and will continue to drink their brews. Cheers"
"Though I am in no way a hop-head, I loved this brew! It is great, period."
"D: Oh, man. This is good stuff, and I think this is the first 5 I've ever given for drinkability. The best thing about this beer (to a non-hophead, at least) is that it's VERY well-balanced. There are many flavors and aromas being highlighted here, so it doesn't just taste like someone dropped an entire hop farm into a kettle. Yes, there's a pretty powerful bitterness, but there are citrus, woody, and floral aromas/flavors all playing nice with one another to round it out. Delicious. Applause, accolades, etc."
"D: Despite the boasting, this beer is truly well-crafted, and more balanced than its name would lead one to believe."
"Drinkability- For a huge beer, this is pretty darn drinkable. Maybe a bit of aging to diminish the harshness of the alcohol would make it even better."
"This beer pours a heavy amber color with a thick off white foamy head. The lace the head leaves behind covers the whole glass as you drink the beer and acts more like a dollop of whipped cream on the top of the beer then a normal beer head. The beer h a strong sweet aroma that reminds me of over ripe fruit. The taste hits you like a ton of bricks or more like a ton of bricks made out of hops. The hops and the spice covers your whole mouth with a IPA style tingle. The blend is great with only a hint of the normal bitterness. In all the beer is a sweet blend of hops and malt with a strong spice. The beer has a surprisingly crisp refreshing feel and is far smother then other strong IPAs that Ive had. This beer actually finishes very clean and refreshing as far as strong tasting beers go. Youre left with a clean feeling but youll be tasting hops for the rest of the day."
"Pours a clear amber/copper color with a giant white foamy frothy head. A very nice looking beer. The smell is a pungent citrus hop aroma. Grapefruit and tangerine are the aromas most dominate. The taste is very bitter,this is crazy hoppy. Citrus flavors are in this beer,but the hop bitterness really dominates. The m/f is medium with the flavors mixing OK. A very good beer that I waited a long time to try. Just remember,it's REAL hoppy."
"This is great stuff. The rare hopbomb that doesn't sacrifice one inch of balance or complexity."
"Drinkability: Well, you have to drink at least a bomber of this stuff, but two may be pushing it. A nice beer, but the somewhat high alcohol level may detract from having a couple."
"Overall, a very wonderful beer. As I am not a hophead, I wasn't expecting to like this. I was almost using it to warm up to my second encounter with an AB I'll be sampling in a few days (I got both of them in a trade)."
"...it poured well into a tall glass from the 22oz bottle...i recommend that you take the time to read the bottle and enjoy the labeling and it's odd, rough texture...once poured, the color is a medium hued golden yellow w/ an ample head...a citral hoppiness fills your nose as you breathe this one in deep...the tatse begins simple enough in your mouth but it's the aftertaste that makes this one worth the effort - not so much bold but still, to the point...the citrus mixes with the hops and thus begins a delicate balance and battle of tatses for your mouth to enjoy as you reach for another sip...at 7.7%, it's certainly more managable than most of your other Double IPAs and it doesn't weigh heavy in your stomach after the bottle is empty either...it breaks the custom of some of the more """thicker""" tasting Double IPAs...in fact, i find it strange that it's called a DIPA... i feel like it's a 'tweener - somewhere between an IPA and a DIPA...an alltogether fine crafted beer that i'll continue to enjoy..."
"D - I'd have this again for sure, but I think I'd prefer Stone's 10th Anniversary IPA over this one."
"If you like hops, you'll like this."
"Taste is balanced nicely. Aggresive hops offset with a moderate malt follow-through that takes a sweet slide on the tongue... followed with a more aggresive hop swallow. Very good and easy to drink."
"Overall, Ruination has a nice assertive hop profile. Along with a nice malt base. Another solid offering from Stone."
"D: for me its very drinkable... the flavor is strong and so higher alcohol is not as noticed. You will need to be a fan of dry finishing bitter beer, but I'm delighted by the lack of caramel sweetness that is so often associated with double IPA's. Still an awesome beer to be"
"Drinkability: One is enough... this is a beer everyone should sample once, it is a benchmark for double IPAs and challenged people's expectations, but I feel it has been far surpassed. Stick with Stone's regular IPA and get a bomber of 10th anniversary while you still can."
"Alcohol is evident, warming the stomach. and quickly buzzing, but all in all a damned tasty IPA."
"Excellent beer for any hophead, myself included. Surprising depth of flavor with the sweet maltiness, more than just bitterness, though that is definitely what this beer is about. Certainly not on Dreadnaught's level in my book, but an excellent DIPA that lived up to all my expectations."
"This beer pours a pale dark gold with a huge frothy white head that leaves a nice film the whole way down with tons of lace. The smell is amazing...hops, Hops, and more HOPS! If I had to venture a guess I would say they are of the centennial varietal but perhaps it is cascade. The taste is also very nice. Up front with biting hop bitterness and amazing hop aroma. This beer has a nice mouthfeel, very very good with full carbonation. Overall very very drinkable. An amazing DIPA, just what you would expect from Stone."
"Reasonable medium body, mild carbonation stays out of the way. It is impressive how drinkable this beer is for how hoppy and strong it is. In my opinion, this knocks the socks off of sweet, alcoholic DIPAs. One of my new favorite beers!"
"Another fantastic brew from Stone. Simply awesome!!"
"This is a GREAT beer. I almost had to stretch to find something to not rate it perfect on. Poured to a bright orange color, with just the right amount of carbonation bubbles. A thick off-white head lingered through the entire drink, and left excellent lacing all around the glass. A strong, highly hopped aroma of grapefruit and oranges led the way. Flavor at first was more of bitter hoppiness, combined with the citrus fruit. As the glass warmed, a slight malty sweetness crept into the flavor. Further on, the 7.7% alcohol made itself known in both aroma and the finish, which was a perfect balance of the bitter the sweet. My only regret is that this is not available locally, although if it were, I may stop rating beers, and just drink Ruination."
"D: Maltier than I remember, but still mighty fine."
"I would have to say this is by far one of the best beers I have tasted. The label states this is a liquid poem to the beauty of the hop and it is. If you like hops, this beer is for you. I have quickly become a hop head and for me, it doesn't get any better than this. The availability is lacking in the small town I live in, one store carries anything worth drinking, but this takes the cake. I would recommend this beer to any aspiring hop head as a perfect example of hoppy."
"Split a 22 oz. bottle of this with a good friend of mine. No freshness on the bottle. Poured a hazy orange color with a tall off-white head and decent lacing on the glass. Smells are fantastic - blooming hops all over the place. Pine. Hints of butterscotch underneath. Very complex character in the aroma, and it continues well into the taste. Crazy hops here that bounce all over. Very floral. The dominating taste is obviously the hops, but there are so many layers to them that I can't describe it as single note. Very nice finish and aftertaste. The hops continue to change and bloom even then. Creamy mouthfeel that complements the hoppy character very well. Overall, a wonderful beer, one of the best in the IPA style I have sampled in a long time. I will remember this one and come back to it."
"This is a very well-made, enjoyable beer!"
"It's almost luminescent gold with a crisp and clear color. The head isn't dense, but the lacing is superior. The hops are aromatic, sweet, flavorful and fruity. Mouthfeel was ok and overall pretty good. I enjoyed this very much and would love to have more."
"A beautiful, clear amber body, but with very little head (maybe too much hop oil to support a head?). Smell is piney and hoppy, but not as hoppy as I expected. The taste is great. A normal american IPA hop zing up front, some malt in the middle, but then a huge bitter bite at the end of the swallow. It's bitter, but still balanced. What a nice beer! Mouthfeel is moderate, and low carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding for such an extreme beer."
"D: Very good, and something I get frequently, but I do have to be in the right mood for the hopped to high hell attack on the palate that it is."
"Decided to review this beer tonite in celebration of Stone's imminent and recently announced MI distribution, no more road trips across the border! A nice sized white head sits on a light copper colored beer and slowly fades back. Smell is sweet orange liquer, vitamin c smarties at first, further in I think I can smell some pine hop aromas as well but this may be my from the overload on my palette. Taste is at first sip simply a strong bitterness, dry and grassy in its finish. As the beer warms and I adjust the sweet citrus is evident in the background as well as a piney, peppery, alcoholy kick before a big dry finish. Besides rejoicing the distribution announcement, I felt like something hoppy tonite, and of course this hits the spot. On other nites I might feel like the hops crush too much of the flavor, but not tonite."
"Full bodied, nice full mouthfeel. Slight oiliness that adds to the drinkability. The alcohol is noticeably present without being too much. The alcohol is well balanced in the taste and mouthfeel with the hops. I would not want to drink anything else after this since it is very strong on the taste buds (in a good way) and I don't think you could really """taste""" anything else afterwards."
"A very drinkable beer...wouldnt recommend drinking anything after it because you probably wont even be able to taste any flavor in the next beer"
"The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. The overall bitter aftertaste kinda lowers the drinkability in my opinion. A quality brew that does what they say it does."
"This is the 3rd or 4th time I have tried this beer but this is the first time I got the whole thing to myself ;-) thanks Indybeer. I poured it into my Sam Smith Imp pint glass and sat back waiting for the head to settle. It was a nice orange tinted golden beer with a healthy head. The first snif went up my nose, but the after that it was fine. Grassy tannin bitterness (yuck) with a sweet malt and citrus blend. This had way more grass bitter than I remember and it really turned me off. I set it down as I played some ran around killing Zombies in the mall and as it warmed the grassyness mellowed out but never went away. I had a 60 minute after this to wash away the taste and the 60 rocked."
"Pours a clear, golden orange with a thick (3/4) head that reduces to a thin ring with modest lacing pretty quickly. Light carbonation, not a whole lot going on in the glass. Grassy hop smell with a hint of citrus. The aroma and the taste seem to be a little off. Expected (from both the aroma and the description) more hop bitterness, but it was pretty tame. However, there is an earthy-hop (Chinook?) taste up-front and a lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. In between is a little washed out. Mouthfeel is smooth. Not much alcohol (for a DIPA) and plenty of hop character, so its very drinkable. However, in the age of triple IPAs and (soon to be) quadruple IPAs, it might be a little dated -- especially for Stone. I wouldnt be surprised to see a more extreme adaptation in the near future."
"Can anyone say a discouraging word about Stone? I sure can't. This is another Stone brew that has the power to (almost) make you forget about all your other favorite breweries. Cheers, tilt glass, liquid nirvana."
"This is my favorite IPA. If well chilled, let it warm a bit to unlock the complexities of the of aroma and flavors. Kudos Stone, you have my respect and gratitude!"
"Great flavor and the hops aren't overwhelming. Stone brewery is doing great things."
"A very good, well made beer... I had expected a little more hop bite, but this is more of a refined Double IPA."
"My big bottle of ruination pours a beautiful murky orangish gold with a thick firm head that leaves excellent lacing the whole way down my goblet. The aroma is powerful citrusy piney hops. Theres also some sweetness in the nose. Very enticing. The initial taste is filled with fantastic citrusy hops with some underlying malt evening things out just a bit. Finish is bitter and crips. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. Definitely very delicous and drinkable. Fantastic stuff."
"Comments: I liked this offering from Stone, I thought it was well balanced with plenty of malt flavor offset by the pungent hops. Not overly bitter & was clean in the end."
"d - the hops get stronger and stronger as you drink this beer. not for the faint of heart or the beginner."
"Had it poured into a standard pint glass. Nice golden straw color. The beer looked a little hazy. I didn't detect a huge hop aroma. There was a hop aroma but it didn't smack you in the face. Definite citrus aroma and flavor in this beer. A bitter beer, hitting at 100 IBU's it's going to be bitter. But I think that's all this beer is: bitter. There was not a strong hop flavor, it had citrus characteristics and left you with a dry palate when you were done. Mouth feel was good, nice carbonation, body wasn't too heavy, well-balanced for the body. This is a good IPA but it does lack balance. I didn't detect any maltiness or anything to offset the hop bitterness. When you drink this it's like drinking a dry, bitter, citrus drink. If that's what you enjoy then this is perfect."
"Just okay drinkability for this beer. Yeah, its big and hoppy, but its also unbalanced and a rather simplistic interpretation of a DIPA. I'll have one, and I'll enjoy it, but no real intrigue to draw me back."
"Very impressive Double IPA. I love that it's not super sweet like a lot of the other doubles out there. It really shows off the hops. I've been a pretty happy person since Stone got to New Jersey. If you like hops, check it out."
"MMMM MMMM good, as the bottle states, once you drink this beer, all other beers will taste horrible, and i think they are right. Great hoppy aroma and amazing mouthfeel with a great taste to boot. Loaded with hops absolutly loaded. Poured a hazy amber color with a great smell, not much head but it could have been the way i poured it. Drink it if you find it."
"Poured a coppery-hued orange color with a one-finger whitish head that slowly fell away to medium sticky lacing. Aroma is richly characterized by citrus and floral hops, sweet caramelly malts are still easily identifiable. Taste is less hoppy that I expected at first, but they begin to go to work on your palate, spreading a wonderful bitter op character all around. Malts back up the practically overwhelming hop profile very nicely, balances out well. Mouthfeel is smooth and slick, lighter end of the medium bodied scale, lower level of carbonation fits this IPA very well. Drinkability high, alcohol not easily detected, smooth and viscous on the tongue. May very well be my newest fix on a hop binge,extremely enjoyable beer. Will purchase again."
"I never thought I'd give a beer straight 5s, but this is a perfect IPA."
"One final note: as I finish the Ruination, my tongue actually becomes numb from the hops. Wow."
"Eric"
"I've noticed myself coming back to this beer over and over and over. I pay 4-5$ a bottle for the bombers here yet I will splurge every time I am out and pick one of these up. I simply must drink them if possible. Excellent."
"This is one hoppy BITCH!! Without a doubt, the hoppiest beer I've ever had. Beautiful tan-golden color with a beautiful pillowy head and terrific lacing down the glass. It's got a good taste, but after you get towaed the bottom of the glass, the hops become soooo overwhelming, it becomes hard to drink. I do like Stone's regular IPA better, cause it is better balanced...that being said, I still think this is one heck of a brew!"
"Highly recommended, but try it in the bottle first."
"I didn't even get to try this on tap on my trip to San Diego last year, but I managed to hit The Drafting Room while this was available. What a catch! My pint looked great - clear, golden orange with a short white head of fine bubbles, thick solid lacing throughout. Big hoppiness in the aroma, plenty of grapefruit, a bit powdery. Strong bitterness with lots of orange and grapefruit. Also, a solid malt base that gives the balance necessary for a hop-bomb. Citrus is just in-your-face from the beginning until the last bits of the aftertaste - the hops just linger and linger and linger. There's also just a hint of warmth towards the end as well. Very nice. Silky texture with fine carbonation and a medium/light body. Dryness creeps in as well. This is a hop showcase. It's balanced enough to keep things together, but still an aggressive beer. It seemed just a little more mellow on tap than in bottles, but that's really a minor difference."
"all told, i'm not sure this pour was a fair representation of this beer on tap (maybe it had just been tapped, maybe it was nearing the end). that being said, i would have expected more """meat""" from this DIPA (as experienced with the bottled version) than i got but it was still a nice beer."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours yellow/orange with a good white foamy head. There's a good bit of lacing on the glass after drinking it for a while. Obviously this beer has a very strong hop smell, with citrus and pine. It tastes like hops too. A strong hop taste but not overpowering, with a bitter aftertaste at the end which stays around for a while. Not well balanced at all, but this beer is for the hopheads out there. It has a nice medium mouthfeel, slightly slick. Even with all the hoppiness, the beer does go down smooth. I'm not a hophead, but for the style this is a pretty good beer. Whenever I'm in the mood for a hoppy beer, I'd definitely pick up one of these again. Cheers!"
"Poured from a bomber into a standard pint glass. Dark orange color with about a finger of head that slowly broke down to slight lacing. Very strong hop (whooda thunk!) and pine aroma. Taste was also strong in hops throughout but without overwhelming the palate. Plenty of balance makes it very drinkable for those of us who love our hops!"
"Pours a hazy yellowish orange color with a fingers worth of white head. Smells more balanced than I expected...don't get me wrong, the hops are quite dominant but the malts are easily detected. Pine and a lemony citrus followed by a nice biscuity malt aroma. The taste is all that I hoped it would be. Bitter from start to finish with doses of piney hops with just a bit of sweetness in the middle. Slick, oily mouthfeel with a dry, bitter finish. I don't notice the alcohol in this at all. Stone does it again."
"D - Easy...though so hoppy could be a bit hard to do a session with this... Just makes me crave a nice sandwich or bbq! YUM!"
"Drinkabilty- I LOVED it! Very nice! Maybe a bit refreshing but not much. LOVED it from the first sip."
"It has a medium-to-full mouthfeel. The higher-alcohol content does not have a strong presence in the mouthfeel. A very drinkable Double-IPA if you're a fan. Whether or not you like this style, I can't imagine drinking many of these bitter beers in a sitting. A noteable Double-IPA!"
"All in all, too much for more than a couple in one sitting, or even just one, but damned if i'm not going to gave more shipped to me."
"Really very easy to drink to spite its 7.7 ABV!"
"Overall, I wasn't very impressed with this beer for all the hype it receives."
"Note: IPA is by far my favorite style, and I have heard many a rave reviews of this beer. That being said, I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed. This is a outstanding beer, but it is not one of my favorite IPA's, even within the """extreme IPA""" category. For that style I would much prefer a Surly Furious, which I find to be a much more complex beer."
"On tap at UJ's on the Manatawnwy on my Bday (6/22). This was my last beer of the night (after a handful of good brews) but there was still room for it. The beer poured a yellowish-orange color and fairly clear. The head did not last long but did leave some lacing on the snifter I was drinking out of. The nose and taste were a nice big bit of citrus hops but pleasant but not too much overbearing. I liken it to Pliny the Elder but a little less no steroids."
"This is my first review, hope you find it helpful."
"Overall: A unique brew with some unexpected flavors. The drinkability may be low for some because of the alcohol presence. But a strong, out of the box DIPA."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy orange with a off-white head that is frothy and thick. The nose is pine, citrus, oaky, and brisk. The taste is a sharp bitter bite that starts your taste buds on crazy trip. It moves to a suttle and I mean suttle balance of malty honey vanilla sweetness but not much. This is a hop bomb and it will satisfy any hop cravings you desire. I love this DIPA, IMO it should be slightly more balanced but still fantstic."
"Cheers!"
"This is yet another flat out EXCELLENT beer from Stone. I'm always amazed how they can consistently leave their signature in the flavor of a beer, while still representing the style magnificently, no matter what style it may be. Within the style, Dreadnaught is that only one I've had that's better and it's not by much. Since this beer is more accessible and cheaper than Dreadnaught, from now on when I want a DIPA, this is the one I'll choose."
"The pour is clear copper with a 1/2""" white head that sinks down into a thin island covering the most of the beer and a thicker ring. The smell and taste is hoppy. Piney hops upfront, followed by grapefruity hops. Crystal malts mainly stay out of the way. The mouthfeel is thinner than I would have preferred. This is a big, bitter beer, but the whole ruining your palate image is a little disingenuous next to Hopsickle and the Plineys."
"I had this beer in a 22 oz. glass and it poured a dark gold with a medium head. The nose instantly reminded me of the pure hops which I use often when brewing at home and had all of the piney, fruity, and... er... hoppy aromas that go along with it. The taste was impressive to me in that, although the bitterness was strong and a strong hop flavor was found, this beer was not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I expected a ridiculously bitter beer (similar to some bad batches of beer), but instead was greeted with a good malt flavor, biting hop flavor, and a high bitterness which actually blended quite well and wasn't too bad. The carbonation was medium and the mouthfeel was good with a hoppy bite to it. The drinkability was good, but in my opinion was not superb do to the fact that I believe the high hop taste would become overwhelming over time without a switch to a milder beer. Overall, I rate this beer as good and certainly worth a try. It has a very high hop characteristic and a high bitterness that makes for a good IPA. However, I believe the beer is worth more for it's novelty factor and thus is not a beer that I would drink consistently."
"Bottom line: A great DIPA that, imho, deserves the reputation that it has acquired. I Highly Recommend it!"
"With the first taste, the hops are present. Notes of citrus and spice also lingers, and definitely improve as it warms. This is a very hoppy beer, especially as it warms. The hops definitely linger, as do a slightly oily mouthfeel which is not terribly unpleasant. The maltiness of the beer really mellow the beer, and don't let it become over the top with hoppiness. The mouthfeel is pleasant throughout, but there is a slight alcholol burn that goes along with it. This beer is quite drinkable, but is 7.7% per the label and may even be a bit higher. I can see this paired nicely with some thai or other semi-spicy foods, but not too spicy as I think you definitely want to let your tastebuds stick around for this brew."
"Oh, the drinkability. I always have a hard time rating drinkabilty for a huge beer like this. The bitterness of it basically keeps you from enjoying anything else for the rest of the night and one of these is nearly a vegetarian meal in itself. For what it is, its very drinkable but I couldn't see myself drinking more than one of these in a night."
"The only drawback to the drinkability is that it tastes so good you want to drink more but the abv will get you."
"Drinkability: Delicious and hoppy. A nice session brew if it werent for the ABV."
"This beer might not be the best session beer because it is a little high in alcohol. Also, the flavor might become a little overbearing after some time. Ultimately, this is a great beer."
"I'll give it another try and update my review if I find that it grows on me; I owe Stone that much."
"Drinkability - goes down easy, tastes good and with low abv for a DIPA, I could go for another 22 oz. bomber in any given session."
"While I cut my craft-beer teeth two decades ago on Sierra Nevada's hoppy pale ale, I can't really call myself a hophead by today's rather ambitious standards. Thus, with a bias toward """balanced""" beers rather than more extreme offerings, and with a lukewarm response to Stone's Arrogant Bastard (which I find way too harshly bitter), I wasn't very optimistic about Stone's facefull-of-hops iconic DIPA. But man is this one outstanding beer! The hop aroma upon opening and pouring is indeed in your face. It's an aroma I enjoy while brewing beer, but much like black pepper and vanilla when cooking, I'd rather it be tempered and blended with other ingredients when actually drinking beer. In other words, not unpleasant, just out of place. But that's the last of my complaints. The bitterness is definitely pronounced, but the beer remains surprisingly drinkable. There are some really good sweet, biscuity malt undertones to this beer, as well as an appropriate amount of alcoholic warmth. Moreover, the longer one lingers over this beer, the more those malt aromas and flavors come through, making for an amazingly balanced beer (for something that claims >100 IBUs) and a relatively drinkable one, too, at least for a beer of its strength. I'm still not much of a fan of Stone's imagery (gargoyles, dare-you-to-drink-me marketing type/hype), but a great beer will always rise above its packaging."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability- Love it. Don't plan on drinking anything else after this one, but you won't want to. I could drink a few of these with no problem. Not nearly as bitter as the >100 IBU would imply due to the massive malts. One of the best."
"Drinkability is very high, although unless you have some spciy fodd to accompany it, you can write our taste buds off for the rest of the evening/day whatever. Powerful stuff but oodly thirst quenching as well. Very solid job by Stone folks."
"I don't know what it is about these Stone beers. But when I finally get my hands on some of their top offerings, they never fail to disappoint. Maybe expectations are a bit high. But really, no matter I expect such a strong bitterness is going to hinder anything I drink. Maybe I'm an East Coast hack, unable to appreciate the West Coast brilliance. Or maybe this beer just doesn't do it for me."
"Cask version at Barleys 4th Annual Mini RAF (05/13/06): Easily the best beer at the event, it almost seemed unfair. Luckily it was not a competition though. Pours cloudy orange/amber with a fluffy off-white head with good retention. Quick, thin lacing. Robust hops and citrus aroma. Rich, smooth body with an achingly good hops flavor, full of citrus and floral notes. Some malt and caramel flavor in the background as well. The cask-conditioning does wonders for this beer's drinkability, and it is frighteningly easy to drink to begin with. The finish is smooth with a lingering hops taste that begs you to keep drinking. Superb."
"Ahhh yes, my first experience with the infamous """Ruination.""" Ominous-looking bomber bottle, 22oz'er. I dig the rough textured label. Intentional? Anyway, pours a crystal clear tangerine orange color, with a white, rocky head. Thin lacing, and good retention. Nose ... I could smell this one immediately when the bottle was rendered capless! Citrus, pine, and sweet malt-like overload! I could tell this one was gonna be something special. Palate didn't disappoint ... hardcore hop bitterness, overwhelmingly citrus fruit-laden complexity. Curiously, there is a decided sweet malt subtlety underneath all the hop heaviness as well. This one hits you hard, knocks you down, then picks you back up again. Incredibly complex ...not just a """let's see how much hop punch we can get in here""" kind of brew. Finished very clean, with a lot of residual fruity notes, along with a pleasant hop aftertaste. I'd say this is medium-bodied, and only lightly carbonated. This is really a masterful double IPA in my estimation ... I'm fascinated with the sheer hop power this beer has, while managing to maintain a subtle malt character at the same time. The combination is very """juice-like""" to me ... moreso as it warms a bit. An incredible brew. If you're into hops, get it NOW. If you're not, it may just be complex enough for you to appreciate none the less ... my wife, for example, doesn't care for hoppy beers typically ... she liked this one, believe it or not. Superb!"
"I had a bomber of this guy and what it says on the back was true; you're taste buds are destroyed after a few glasses let alone the whole thing. Plus the 7.7% AABV doesn't help matters. It's a phenomenal beer to drink, but in moderation. Hats off once again to one of my favorite breweries."
"Over all a great beer when you are in the mood for hops, probably the best double IPA I've had."
"This is a very drinkable beer, especially for the summer season, but it would be good year round. A very pungent and flavorful beer. I think Stone Ruination it is a good representative of the style, and would certainly have it again. Very nice!"
"Thanks to Gclarkage for this beer!!"
"This beer is indeed drinkable and enjoyable. ABV is potent throughout and one bomber of this makes you feel the ruinous affect it can have. Well balanced throughout given that despite how hoppy it is, tiny pockets of sweetness and malt protrude. Truly and enjoyable beer."
"D: Goes down clean and with no alcohol bite. Miles better than regular Stone IPA."
"Overall impression: Pure heaven. This is the nectar of the gods. What an awesome showcase of hop balance. World Class."
"Mouth is a caress of carbonation, perfectly so. I certainly will buy this again and again. Yet another brew by Stone that makes me glad to be on the left coast with easy access to their brews!"
"Cheers!"
"-UF"
"In some respects, it may be unfair to categorize this beer as a Double IPA, pitting it against such behemoths as Dogfish 90. Indeed, at 7.7% ABV it's near the lower end of the style guidelines. Ruination is really what I'd like to be drinking every time I drink a regular IPA: alcohol on the high end, hops gone amuck, eminent drinkability."
"Cheers!"
"This is one very nice beer."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a bright copper color beer with a nice foamy bright white head with great lacing and retention. Beautiful floral aroma with solid sweet malt as a backbone. Taste is also dominated by the floral texture of the hops with a great nice bitter finish. Great balance between bitter and floral malt and great presence of malt. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. I was really impress since I am not the greatest fan of IIPA."
"This is no haiku...it's an epic."
"Drinkability: Not something you would want to drink on a regular basis, unless you love hop bombs! A nice offering from Stone Brewing Co."
"Medium body & carbonation. Seems pretty well balanced, though the malt is definately behind the scenes. Compared to some other double IPA's I've tried, this one is more in line with what I expect from this style. High ABV, so can't imagine much more than one at a time, but I certainly plan on having more of these in the future."
"This is still my favorite IPA and I could drink it all day. Highly recommended."
"EDIT: In the time since this review, I've had a couple of samples of this beer that did not live up to my original review. They weren't terrible, but they weren't nearly as good as I remembered this beer being. I'm almost certain that I can attribute this quality to freshness. I'm not going to edit my scores because when this beer is fresh, it is incredible and worthy of the score I gave it. However, it must be drunk FRESH. Since the bottle doesn't have a freshness date (that I can see), it may be difficult to tell how fresh it is. You should probably inquire about how long it has been in the store before buying it. Otherwise, you may be disappointed."
"overall, a very good beer but it did not quite live up to the hype for me."
"Pours an orangey pale color with an invitingly frothy head. This beer also has an inviting, fruity scent, with easily enough hop oil to foreshadow the hop attack that is about come. The taste is all hops, but it is without the usual sweetness that accompanies big American DIPAs. I find Ruination to be too dry to really enjoy; it is just too rough."
"Stone Ruination IPA poured a cloudy orange from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. Very hoppy, citrusy aroma. Taste is very hoppy, as expected. Quite good, citrusy flavors, not quite a grapefruit flavor, but almost. Definitely an intense beer, not for those who don't like hops. Recommended, worth seeking out."
"Pours amber with a big white head, that fades to nice cover.Nice lacing. The aroma is lots of pine and grapefruit, some caramel notes. Flavor is grapefruit and caramel malt, with a good bit of resinous pine. Texture is very smooth, easy drinking. Terrific!"
"After the initial pour/look/sniff/taste I was going to turn on Sunday Night Baseball but decided to just sit with the beer and enjoy it in silence."
"Definitely a tour de force of hops. The substantial malt also helps balance things out making this quite a drinkable DIPA. Having said that, I find that cellaring this brew makes it much more suitable to my tastes. I find it really brings much more balance, while still leaving a bounty of hop flavor. It also leads to a less acidic, and how shall I say, less 'ruinous version of the brews. I know, Im a wuss. To those of you who down this stuff fresh by case when its fresh: I salute you. I'll stick to my cellared versions."
"22 oz bomber poured into an imperial pint glass, nice golden amber color with a finger of off-white head, decent retention, some scattered lacing on the glass. Nose is all hops, strong, resinous, piney and floral hops, very nice, makes you want to dive right in. Taste is exactly what you expect, huge juicy hops, grapefruit and citrus upfront, lingering pine and bitterness on the finish. Despite the massive amount of hops, a nice caramel malt tries to balance as well as it can. Medium/full bodied, moderate carbonation, and a very crisp finish. This is a very good DIPA, perfect for any hophead, ashame it doesn't come in 12 oz bottles."
"Not something to get everyday due to the cost, but nice once in a while. Might be interesting to compare side-by-side with Stone IPA."
"It's so crisp and just a lovely drinking experience. I could enjoy multiple bombers of this thoughought the course of a day."
"overall, a great beer"
"Taste: Ok so this beer is a hob bomb 100+ IBUs. Despite this the maltliness and higher alcolhol make it quite palatable. I just love this brew that all I have to say. If youre a hop head like me make sure to get your hands on a bomber of this stuff!"
"This is the hoppiest beer Ive yet had and I love it. At times I thought my enamel was being replaced with lupulin. A work of art."
"Nice mouthfeel and drinkability. I'll be back soon. A solid effort."
"This poured a clear yellow with a slight orange tint and a small white head into a snifter. A resinous piney smell hits first with bits of orange peel and a hint of biscuity malts, very nice. The taste actually made my mouth pucker, very bitter, it has a piney earthy bitterness with not much malt in the background. The active carbonation contributed to the bitter bite. I drank this a little bit above cellar temp; I think that accounted for the bite. I've had this before a little cooler and I remember more malt."
"This beer is quite different from it's bottled version. Amber gold color is topped by a foamy white head, lacing was prevalent from mid glass on down. Subtle aroma of citrusy hops was followed by a unique taste profile. I detected a mix of grapefruity and orangey notes, very refreshing albiet it's high powered abv. Creamy mouthfeel and good drinkability for it's strength."
"I can see why this is named Ruination IPA. Your taste buds could be gone after this bottle and it will be a glorious death. It pours a slightly hazy copper orange color with a nice head that disappears too quickly for my liking. The aroma is fantastic. Hops, hops and more hops with a slight alcoholic smell mixed in. It has a perfumy smell. Me likey. The taste has a bitterness to it but also has a nice malty underpining. The hops definitely win out though as they should. I find this beer surprisingly drinkable considering the power of the hops here. Stone never fails to kick arse."
"but this bitch goes down on you... and you love it."
"I was fortunate enough to be able to have whenever I wanted for a year and a half, when I worked a consulting gig in Utica, NY. Boy are these bombers addicting. Nice firm head, with excellent lacing. The smell, oh the smell!! BAM Citrus, lemon, hops resin. This is one chewy DIPA. Almost too chewy for someone that loves DIPAs. The only downside is that I couldn't really taste anyting else I might have later, like the Arrogant Bastard. This is my second favorite DIPA. I still prefer the Hercules."
"In the mouth, this stuff grows...plenty of body with a bubbley smooth feel as it quenches your hop thirst. This is the brew that wrote the book for 2XIPA style for sure...HIGHLY recommended to hop lovers, Cheers !"
"I could definitely drink this on a regular basis if it was available in my hometown. Even with the bottle being around for awhile in my possession (and who knows how long before that), it is an outstanding beer. I just don't feel that I'm experiencing it in its full glory and hope to have another chance at it."
"MANY thanks to BeerBeing for this one."
"O--Top notch double IPA, a once in a long while treat for me, the ace in the whole for my occasional over the top craving."
"This is a enjoyable beer. 750 ml bottle was getting a bit warm so I put it in the freezer for a bit. Naturely I fogot about it as I sipped away at the glass I poured. Needless to say my next glass was ice cold. Usually I don't like ice cold beer, but this is pretty good. Somewhat refreshing yet unrelentingly bitter."
"Golden/orange color with thin white head. Wisp of lacing remain on the glass as you consume this one. Smell is huge citrus hops. It smacks you in the face and just overwhelms the senses. Taste is bitter, but more of a piney, resinous bitterness than the smell. The bitterness is so extreame that it gives the beer almost a burnt taste. Very full and chewy mouthfeel. I believe this is the first DIPA that has lived up to my expectations for hoppiness. Others have seemed to be too sweet but that is not a problem with this one. Don't get me wrong, there is a malt backbone to this that eventually works it's way into your perception but the highlight of this baby is the hops. A beer for the true hop head only."
"Pours a deep gold with a minimal head and thin lacing after just a bit. The smell: Boom! Hops. Sweet and pungent all at the same time. Every sip of this is milder than I think it ought to be. At 100+ IBUs (as per the label), this is clearly a hoppy beer, but the bitterness does not overwhelm. Rather, the most prominent flavors are the sweet citrusy hop notes. Medium bodied, but with a tangy aftertaste, this one is great, but strong. The 22oz bottle is definitely enough for a sitting."
"A great beer for those hop heads out there. Sip and thank Stone they make beer like this."
"Beautiful light golden amber color. [served in my favorite Imperial Nonic) Nice aroma, much like a fistful of hops. Surprisingly balanced between hops and malt. It does NOT overwhelm you with bitterness, might you believe if you consider the name. Very Nice! I have enjoyed EVERY Stone ale I have tried, and this is one of my favorites. Great fullness feeling with every sip. GREAT BEER!"
"Finally, it's obvious that the folks at Stone put a lot of effort and careful work into this beer. It really comes through, and it's kind of touching. You can taste it in the beer...this one was *created*, not just brewed."
"Cheers!"
"22 oz. bomber at 55 degrees. Pours a slightly hazy sunset orange with a frothy and lasting white head. Just a huge hop nose emminates from the snifter. Orange, grapefruit, crushed pine needles, its all right up front, but not much in the way of any malt aromas to be found. A nice round mouthfeel with the subdued carbonation level keeping it silky smooth. Massive hop flavor profile; like biting into a whole grapefruit encrusted in honey and pine needles. Some faint crystal malt sweetness attempts to balance out the big muscle hops. Finishes with a big, bold and crisp bitterness; nice and long. The 7.7% interplays nicely being present just enough to accentuate all the luscious flavors of this classic American IPA."
"Overall I must admit I am a huge Stone fan, they have never disappointed me and this one was another great offering from them. If you dig the hops and like their regular IPA you will certainly like this."
"This is one of those beers that I picked up knowing it was going to be good. It came through with flying colors. There is a great copper tone they got out of the malt. The hops were huge on it. It leaves behind a thick shag carpeting of lime green hops on your tongue. For how loud the hops our the finish of the beer is smooth. It leaves a thick malt taste instead of the citrus burn that you get from some strong IPAs. After taking a second glance, the beer taste darker then copper tones lead you to believe. This is the professional of IPAs."
"Mouthfeel is solid, but drinkability gets docked a point or two. The bittering hops take a toll towards the end of the bottle."
"This beer is pretty arrogant in its own right. Thumbs UP!"
"An absolute assault on the senses. The bottle is practically exploding with hops. Ruinous? I can't feel my tongue. Make this one the last beer of the day."
"I need to recuperate before I have another beer. Awesome."
"So in conclusion everyone say it with me now, """I AM VERY BITTER AND I LIKE IT!""""
"Overall this is a great brew. It has complexity and balance that allows it to go beyond being simply a hop monster."
"A very drinkable Double IPA if you want it totally hop dominated, which sometimes is exactly what I want."
"If you are a hop head, try this... it's a hop monster. If you are not, don't come within 10 feet of this beer. Woof."
"Great beer, especially on tap."
"If only I lived in So Cal, I would love to try this on cask at a Stone event. I would also definitely keep a keg close at hand."
"mention of the words """hops"""."
"As for taste, I agree with other BA's when they say that this should be the only beer you review for an evening. The hop punch truly """ruins""" your palate's ablilty to taste any lessor flavors, in a good way. Heavy citric flavors are evident over a mild, yet detectable malt. Stone truly lives up to their well hyped name with this one, it won't let you down."
"Poured out of a bomber into a pint glass. Has a nice one finger head that disipates, leaving a ton of lacing on the glass. Smell of HOPS and a lot of them. Grapefruit notes dominate. Taste much like the smell. Not a lot of malt balance, but in the case of this beer, it isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel if medium and oily. Very nice. Drinkability suffers slightly, as many DIPAs do. I just can't drink more than one or two at a sitting. Overall, very good brew. Stone guys, you do a great job!"
"into my tulip it goes...comes out a somewhat hazy golden orange color with a monster sized white head that's very pleasing to the eye...the nose is very hopy and malty as well....the taste is a great balance of sweet malts and not overly bitter hops...great combination...still a little citrus and piney in there as well...very crisp mouthfeel and for me im pleased with the drinkability because the hop presence is definatley there but not too overpowering"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Easy and rolling in the mouth. Not the """beast""" I expected... it's a pretty damn easy drinkin' IPA if you ask me."
"bought a bottle at City Wide in Mishawaka to try with a friend from out of town. orange color. not head. some lacing. hoppy, citrusy odor. smells great. tasty. hoppy, citrusy, bitter and sweet. Like sucking on the hops themselves. Definitely destroys the old taste buds for further drinking that night...but i'd still have another. Reminded me of 3F Dreadnaught."
"mouthful of bitter hops with a surprisingly nice clean finish. prickly light mouthfeel that leaves just a touch of oily hop bitterness. nice flavor, but it's a little too straightforward for a DIPA. little malt presence, and the complexity from the aroma is missing from the flavor."
"D: Easy to consume and you can't really tell it has the 7.7% abv. A really decent beer that I could drink again and again."
"I like this beer, but am not impressed enough to go out of my way to buy it again. Definitely worth a try, but don't kill yourself trying to get it."
"This is one of the better IPA that I have tried and comes highly reccomended from the BevMo Crew in Socal!"
"Hazy golden peach juice with a not-quite-white 1""" sticky froth. Ridiculous citrus aroma: grapefruit, mandarin, tangerine, lime. There's a certain doughy sweetness present in the scent, too. Grapefruit rind dominates the first sip. Bitter indeed, but certainly not out of line. More floral citrus nuances emerge as the beer warms. And a definite malt sweetness is apparent as well. Medium body, juicy mouthfeel. Maybe I like the hops a little too much, but my tongue isn't numb at all from this. While Ruination is a hop showcase, I wouldn't claim that it is at all out of balance. In fact, it's quite measured, all things considered. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be so damn easy to drink. Kick-ass bottle art, to boot."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours a slightly hazy, slightly orangish darker golden color. There was a fair sized white head that drops off somewhat quickly. The aroma is definitely hoppy. It is a good mix, with notes of pine, grapefruit, orange. The taste is quite good. The hopiness is right upfront and strong, but not as overpowering as I thought this one might be. Medium malt body behind the hops, but you cant taste it at all. There are a few that are better, but you can get this one most anywhere."
"D - If you like west coast hops then you will like this beer if you don't, you won't. It's that simple."
"This is truly a great DIPA!"
"Pours with not much head to speak of, its a bright cloudy orange/copper that seems to glow. Aroma is strong. Smells like grassy hops all the way. The taste is strong and hoppy also. Dank hops, the malt is lightly sweet but overpowered by hop flavor. The finish is quite bitter, but you don't realize how bitter until later on when it is still lingering on the tongue. Very bubbly, smooth and rich, it is medium thick and has a nice crispness to it. I felt is was pretty drinkable, especially for hopheads. I would have expected a little more balance but I don't think Stone was really going for that anyway. Recommended..."
"i remember my first time trying this beer a couple years ago. i had already taken a shine to the hop flower, but i was in no way prepared for this. i was overwhelmed, though i did manage to choke down the entire bottle. many tastings later, i can say that while harsh, very harsh, but so good."
"Kudos to Greg Koch and everyone at Stone for this one."
"I think I have a favorite beer now. I smelled the bottle after opening and was amazed. It was a complex scent for an IPA. It poured a wonderful dark golden color with a light, quickly fading head. Make sure you drink while there is still some head. The additional flavors you'll get from smelling the head as you drink are amazing. Besides the hops, I noticed citrus flavors. It reminded me of an orange bubble gum I had as a kid. Neither the beer nor the gum tasted much like oranges, but there was a hint of it. The only thing holding back the drinkability is the alcohol content. If this beer was around 5-6%, I could drink it all night. At 7.7%, one is probably enough."
"22 oz bottle with about a year age on it. Poured into a Stone IPA glass, deep tulip. Color is hard to describe rose-apricot maybe, definitely has some pinkinsh hues, head is white and small. Smell is perfumey hops with a grainey edge, no alcohol on the nose. Taste is hops of course, but also a good blst of citrus, hops are not overwhelming, but they are the main flavor. There has to be a decent amount of malt, but it is definitely in the backseat. Drinkability is extremely high for the style (I2PA). Have a newer one in the fridge I need to check against."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing. The beer seems kind of oily, but its a nice, as it coats your pallete with hoppy goodness. Drinkability is very high on this DIPA. A nice and refreshing offering from Stone."
"I first tried this one about two years ago in the beginning of my craft beer drinking days and it was a little over the top for me, but now that I have grown to love IPA,IIPA or Imperial IPA I can say I really had no clue what I was doing back Beer pours to what I can describe as a honey maple with a creamy white head. The smell is tough to describe, no real over the top hops, best I can describe the smell is musty. Taste is great, hops and fruit are very detectable and goes down real smooth. I could probably drink 2 bombers of this one but I would hope to do so at home or with a DD as its got quite an undetectable alcohol kick to it."
"Nice orange-amber color, with a tan head that has some staying power. The aroma is powerful - it jumps right out at you, a nice blend of soft citrusy hops, some woodiness and slight mustiness, and heavy malt, with a touch of esters. The flavor is powerful too; the hop bitterness and flavor coat your tongue and compliment the maltiness perfectly, and you also get hints of cherry, caramel, and alcohols. Very drinkable. This seems a better balanced and blended beer than the Arrogant Bastard."
" Overall, this is a well crafted IPA. I could (and probably will) drink a few of these, no problem."
"I think I could drink this all day, but since I only have one bomber, we'll never know. Yummy"
"Drinkability is good for the style. Respect is due and caution should be exercised. This beer is certainly good but I think I expected more after the standard IPA."
"22 ounce bomber poured a golden copper color with a one finger head. Strong citrusy hop aroma. Extreme bitterness in the aftertaste. A must for all hopheads. Not as balanced as I would have preferred. Definitely a double IPA. Last week I had Great Divide's Hercules Double IPA and would prefer that to this. Although the alcohol content is higher on the Hercules, I think it was more drinkable than this. As the name says, my taste buds have been ruined...but in a good way."
"Stone's Ruination IPA starts off with a light head and pleasent golden color when poured. Smells of the strong hops and a piney hint are present. Has a distinct feel of syrup and once has coated the palate you can really taste the bitterness. The alcohol taste is just appropriate enough for this beer. As the ale warms to room temperature, it really becomes something special."
"Drinkability: Nowhere near as drinkable in quantity as the Stone IPA, this is a brewing achievement on the extreme level; just not something I want a lot of"
"Highly recommended."
"For an IPA - sorry, 'double IPA' - this is totally drinkable. Alcohol and bitterness become more noticeable as it warms. One more please!"
"wow. it's been quite some time since i've had this. man has my palate changed(for the better). this beer pours a very nice deep golden/light copper color with a nice white head that lasts quite a while. the smell is such a lovely scent of sweet hops. damn this smells wonderfull. when the first time i had this beer, i thought it was good, but really bitter. but now..wow. i've developed the taste of the lovely hops. boy they are all over the place on this one. a slight bitterness at first but not that much. the rest is just beautiful sweetness hops. damn, i really did not expect to like this beer that much, but wow.i have been """permanently ruined""" by this beer. absolutly wonderful."
"World-class brew."
"22 oz bomber, pours a lifeless orangey yellow with nonretentive standard ipa foam.. tight at first, big airy bubbles but very little lacing. nose is starchy, raw malt accented by navel oranges and waxy hop resin. smells like cooked vegetables. great mouthfeel and drinkability.. just carbonated enough and just thick enough with no limp spots.. nor is it too much to choke down. fruity.. sweet citrus meets its match in a numbing wave of dry hop bitterness.. not fresh, not too smokey.. kind of like the ipa equivalent of mexican brick weed. you get alot for your money, but alot will only get you so far. overall flavor screams """barleywine jr.""" without creating too much head buzz. a decent ipa from stone.. not as good as their standard IPA, but still drinkable for something so purposefully abrasive. cheap, so ill probably drink it again."
"I went into this brew questioning whether my palate would be able to handle it. Up until now I've been a malt man, prefering the earthy malts to the spicy piny hops...but i think my palate has finally matured. This was fantastic, pouring a transparent amber hue with a healthy white head on top. Smells of pure hoppy pine and spice, although a very moderate malty backgroud is persent. Tasted how it smells, like having a handful of hop buds in your mouth, oily and Uber-flavorful, but always balanced out by the perfect amount of malt which adds a biscuit like background. Like the bread in a hop sandwhich I guess. Really top notch, If I drink this in another six months I wouldn't be surprised if I gave it a 5."
"Notes: Ruination, jubilation, is there a difference? Superb presentation (bad ass looking gargoyle on the bottle), top-notch flavor, and just about all I want in a beer."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is just as good as the rest of this beer. In my opinion it is lighter on the palate, the feel of it is quite like water, light. The carbonation which appeared to be over the top from the look of the beer after the pour is complementary to the style. There is not too much, rather there is just enough to make you notice that you are drinking a carbonated beverage. I would definitely buy this beer again, however I probably will buy the regualar Stone IPA because for the amount of money this bomber costs I think that I would be better off in the long run with buying a sixer of the regular IPA."
"Note: Even the hoppy burps taste good with this."
"Light orange/amber in colour with medium carbonation. Huge citrusy hop aroma, with some interesting green (almost minty) notes in the background. Bracing, but not at all harsh, bitterness. Loads of complex citrus flavor notes: lemon, manderin orange and grapefruit. Minor notes of pine and black pepper. The malt component of the flavor profile is surprisingly clean. Somewhat light bodied for an IIPA, but in a really nice way that makes the beer even more drinkable."
"Pours crystal clear bronze/orange. Three fingers of off-white, dense cream rise and fall very slowly leaving patchy lacework. The nose is intense and amazingly hoppy- fresh-cut whole hops, with that american citrus and pine aroma. There is a just a hint of sweet caramel malt flavor to properly balance the taste, but mostly just alpha hop oil obliteration. The carbonation is tiny and scarce, but the body is light; and that keeps the mouthfeel smooth enough to retain a good drinkability. The aftertaste turns grassy while the orange peel and pine cone flavors all meld together to form a dry and bitter finish, full of complex flavor but never overwhelming."
"Overall, this is just a downright incredible assault on the tastebuds, and every so-called hophead needs to have this near (or at) the top of their list if they haven't tried it yet. Amazing hop aroma, incredible hop flavor, and another blatently kick ass offering from Stone."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable IPA. Do not plan on tasting anything after drinking it."
"The taste, however, is something of a letdown. Yummy, hoppy, yes. But amazing? I mean, sure, my mouth is all cottony and the hops are present, but what sets this beer apart from the pack? It lacks the balance of Dreadnaught, the subtle beauty of Dogfished 90mins, and the raw, unbalanced hop appeal of Hoppin' Ottin. It exists somewhere in the middle neather regions and I ask why? This is the Point lager of IPAs: Sure, it is head-and-shoulders above the rest, but for as much, perhaps a buck more, perhaps a few bucks less, I can get better. Good, but not amazing."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a 0.5l stein appears a light copper with good clarity for an unfiltered brew. ¾ inch white head that leaves good lacing. Bouquet is very floral but not excessively so. When discussing the taste it is logical to start with the hops, which are indeed powerful; yes, dominating too but not overpowering. There are good caramel-like malt qualities too. As the beer rises in temperature (my serving was perhaps a bit cold to start), the malt flavors become more pronounced, and the alcohol begins to warm the palate, giving an almost medicinal quality to an exceedingly dry IPA. The mouthful is very round, almost creamy, finishing very dry and quenching. The complexity and size of this beer do pose some challenge to the consumption of large quantities."
"This beer poured a golden yellow color that was clear at first pour then became progressively cloudy with each pour, which is to be expected, and was well carbonated. The foam that was produced was almost white with shades of an off white/cream color. It was thick and creamy in nature and sticky, it did not last very long which surprised me, and would like to have had it last deeper into the glass. Some lace was noticeable, but nothing really outstanding. The aromas that came from the glass were outstanding and very complex, tons of hop aromas, pine trees, citrusy notes (grapefruits), roasted malts, fruit, and hints of alcohol. The flavors were even better. The first flavors that hit your tongue are a creamy thick malt flavor, kind of toasted, then warming notes of alcohol are felt, fruits (pineapples, pears and grapefruits), then the hops - oh the hops - oh the flavors - herbs, citrus, flowers, fresh grass, pine trees, - oh the medly of flavors. All the flavors seem to blend together like 2 dancers. This beer finishes bready yeast and warming alcohol. Aftertaste was a melody of malts, hops, and bread, but warm from the smooth alcohol. The body was medium. Over all, a really really good beer, a must staple in the fridge. Stone knows how to brew a beer. Seems aging this beer mellowed it just slightly, one of the best out there. Nice and smooth."
"This beer is about as all-out as it gets. It's big, it's hoppy, it's flavorful. I now understand why this beer is so well-loved on BA - it's hophead nirvana. Definitely worth checking out."
"Notes: This is my favorite IPA and one of my top three beers now. However I should note that if a non hophead were to review this every score except appearance would probably be reversed. This is a beer for hopheads only!!! I could see my friends who drink crap beer simply spitting this out, and even craft beer drinkers who prefer a lot of malty goodness finding this beer over the top with the bitterness. Oh well, glad I'm a member of the middle ground, who can enjoy malt monsters and complete hop bombs. I'll drink this one any day of the week."
"D- This beer is bold if nothing else. It has a nice big flavors and some faint complexity to the hops. The malt and alcohol offer a nice support to make the hops stand up even more."
"Very drinkable for a DIPA... surprisingly gentle on the palate.... all in all a wonderful brew that I wish I had easier access to."
"An exceptional hop-tastic beer. For a double I would have liked more malt but for a beer it is a not-to-miss experience."
"Mouthfeel was slick and chewy but the stinging hops almost kept me from finishing it. I'd love to give this another shot sometime just becuase I love Stone beers but I may be hard pressed to do so. I hope this was a bad batchor something."
"Ruination IPA is, like all Stone beers, anything but routine. If you, like me, are a fan of IPAs (probably my favorite style beer), then you simply must try this ale if you get the chance. If IPAs, especially double IPAs like Ruination, aren't your thing, you probably won't like it, simply because it's sort of the """Spinal Tap""" amp of IPAs -- it takes everything about them and cranks it to an 11. Also, it's very likely to overwhelm you're non-craft beer drinking friends. Stone also brews another IPA, the Stone IPA, which I think is actually the better of the two,"
"This is the IPA that I judge all others by."
"The hops taste remains throughout. It's dry and grassy, but the hops also work with the malts to impart so many other flavors that the beer never becomes overly bitter, even after a full 22 ounces. I say that it is never overly bitter, true, but it toes the line at times, limiting how quickly you'll want to swig this awesome brew."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber, Ruination sits in my Stone IPA glass a nice clear golden color. A thick and rocky white head forms, filling the empty space of the glass. It's a very pretty presentation. As the head dissipates a great deal of lacing is left on the sides of the glass. The aroma is the first of the many intense sensory experiences this beer delivers. A huge grapefruit and citrus fruit aroma greets your nose with a very intense bitterness lying in the background. There is also a very apparent strong malt backbone that holds the whole beer up. The taste hits you like a freight train. Grapefruit and other citrusy fruits lead the charge followed by an intense bitterness. Underlying all this is a wonderfully nuanced malt base that is the equal of the intense hops. As intense as the hops and resulting bitterness are, it never seems harsh or abrasive. It just has the devestating, enamel-dissolving, tongue smacking, eye watering, tooth itching, tastebud killing, skin quivering hoppiness that hopheads adore and crave. For a beer this powerful, it is awfully drinkable. 22 ozs down the shoot before I know it, but the 7.7% catches up to me fast! Wow...what a great beer, a true experience."
"Oily on the tongue  and which the hairs were burned off by third sip. Puts a decent buzz on ya by the end of the bomber. Only thing to bitch about was the way it thinned out as it warmed up. Still a thing of beauty to behold and quaff."
"An incredible Double IPA from a great brewery."
"Pours a faded butterscotch coupled with a nice fluffy milky froth which dissolves in clusters. Smells floral with orange citrus and fruit. Hop is strong and up front as usual. I taste astringent grapefruit with an everlasting linger and a touch of sweetener. Good for the style, but it's my least favorite Stone thus far."
"Drinkability is exceptional. If you like what this beer is, and obviously I do, it is almost compulsively drinkable. If only I could get this beer on tap..."
"...but I was sorely tempted."
"It's true, it really does ruin your palate, so don't plan on tasting any other beers afterwords."
"Overall, a very, very impressive Double IPA. An absolute must try."
"Tasty, I expected no less based off the appearance and aroma. Hops are definately at the forefront of this one, but it is kept under control by the other ingredients. I've tasted """hoppier""" doubles, than this, but this one is top notch as it manages to find good balance in a category that is inherently un-balanced. Still not for the faint of hops though."
"Bottle obtained from Total Beverage (Colorado) a couple days ago. Pours a lushious clumpy light tan two finger head over a nearly clear rust (lightly browned) liquid. The smell during the pour in really enticing. Wet sweet with piney floral hops and mango. Some kind of frutiy ester mixes with the hop sting to make a really delicous aroma. To the nose, the fruity esters predominate over the hops, which are pithy piney. Peaches, oranges, honey malt. Tastes...hoppy bitter initially seems high, but then the thickness of the beer steps in and the bitter gets long in the tangle. Grapefruit pith is so strong it almost stings. It leaves the mouth with an chalky aspirin-like dryness. Behind the hops is the malt sweet. Noticable mostly, but poking it's head up for a view on occassion. Fruity esters are difficult to find. Peaches may be there, lost behind the hop bites. Thick chewy syrupy body with moderate carbonation. The aftertaste is flat out grassy hop bitter, accompanied by a touch of heartburn. Fairly enjoyable, but I don't need any more. The malt is so far below the hops that this beer is way out of balance. That's kinda to style, but not particularly drinkable. Vastly over-rating, IMO."
"Overall, I think this one of my favorites. I've had it before, twice in the bottle and once on draft. Every other time I'd tried it, it blew me away, and it didn't disappoint tonight."
"Note: I see I've given it a bit higher score than before and that pushed this beer to my No. 2 spot at the moment. Either my tastes have changed or I got a fresher bottle this time, although I would imagine this beer could age well."
"I retired for the evening about 20 minutes after completing the 22 oz. bottle, and sitting in bed, I noticed that the feeling I had was strangely reminiscent of the Codeine buzz I got from the medication I took last time I was ill. This beer is no joke."
"Drinkability: This is a great example of where balance is intentionally thrown off, yet done in a tasteful way. So many subtle flavors underneath the insanely hoppy dominance. Definitely not one for the macro-drinking pansy. This one is for the adventurous and the hop-head that is searching for that hops Vahalla."
"The up front hop bitterness is something to be hold. I poured this into a snifter. There was not as big a head as say their IPA, but the aroma was floral hop oils. The taste was a big smack in the face of bitterness followed by a smooth malt backbone and finished with a tingling hop presence. This a must try for any true hop head."
"Opinion: Well, I am not a huge fan of hoppy beers, and this beer in particular I would be inclined to say that it was too one dimensional. Not that they didn't put enough dimensions of hops in there, but there is barely any malt to balance it all out. It is pretty good, but I personally prefer some others more...like their regular IPA for example. Hey...this may be blaspheme to some...but it is my OPINION"
"Overall Impression: Hop juice! Fantastic beer if you are a hop-head."
"The mouthfeel is good. I would say this is a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation."
"Unfortunately this is one I have to pick up out of state, since Connecticut doesn't get Stone's beers. Pours an orange-amber color, with a nice white head. Odor is incredibly hoppy, with quite a bite. The taste is like no other beer I've tried. Ass-kicking amount of hops, without being too bitter and too hoppy. Hints of grapefruit/citrus, maybe some pine. The alcohol is very well hidden, and this beer drinks very easily for such a super-hopped flavor. I only wish I didn't have to drive the NY or MA to get it!"
"my 2nd """celebration beer""" of the night as I am celebrating ND beating Michigan in the big house this afternoon. The first was fish tale 10 sq"
"This is a strong brew, read the lable carefully. Awesome hop flavor not as malty as some other Imperial IPA I have tried so I like this one better. If you like hops and are ready to step up to the imperials this is the one to go for."
"This poured an orangeish yellow, with a giant off-white head. It is big and frothyand laced beautifully down the glass. It has a strong aroma of well balanced spicy and floral hops. The taste of overpowering hops turns to sweet malts and some grains. This ends up with a strong but not harsh bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is slick and full, but with all of the carbination in the beer the bubbles arent harsh on the palette. This beer is definitley high on the drinkability scale. It's delicious, strong, and an all around great I.P.A."
"Despite its bold character, if you like hops, this one will be gone before you know it. Definitely worth checking out."
"Stone Ruination is quality beer. It's more than a few steps over the line as far as acidity and bitterness go, but these characteristics don't totally detract from the refreshing nature of the brew. IPA is a style I don't visit often. There are too many others I prefer, plus it's only fair to let you guys have your share."
"Pours a clear golden orange color with a nice creamy head not a whole lot of carbonation, leaves some nice lacing afterwards. Scent of hops. This is my first double IPA the taste is outstanding IHMO with a medium body. There's a nice bitter taste, but is not that overpowering. This is a very drinkable ale, I will definitely be buying more."
"I found this to be an enjoyable, strong, agressively hoppy beer which lives up to its claim of ruining your palate for a little while. However, it does not find the balance many other DIPA's seem to have cradled themselves into, and is no longer one of my personal top 10."
"I would have to say that it is not exactly what I would call balanced. But I'm a hop head , so screw it . . . it's great."
"The first taste brings its nice bready malt character up front along with its incredible hopiness that has some nice spicey notes that threw my off mostly because i was expecting a more cirtusy type hop foundation. This beer is at the top of my list for me. The balance between the malt and the strong hop character in this double IPA is impressive. Whether you are a big fan of double IPA's or not this beer will not dissappoint."
"Talk about balance. This is a super hoppy beer but it is not harsh in the least. This beer is an exciting seesaw ride with malted grain on one side and crazy hops on the other. It is safe to believe the hype on this beer. This is an excellent IPA."
"This certainly is hop-to-the-Nth-degree. I like it because it seems to be the top of its class without losing its class, if you follow. But it's...not a chore, but a task to finish. It requires effort to drink, but you're rewarded with simply astounding hops and flavor. An experience not to miss for once you've had hop experience."
"A good DIPA, but pretty one-dimensional. It has some of the most extreme hop bitterness I've had in a beer. It tames some as it warms."
"Notes: I'm going against the grain on this one since the score is 91 as of this writing but i have to ask, what are people smoking? this tastes like crap( it's hurts you stomach too) I'm not impressed and this is the worst stone offering ever. I'm sure everyone will want to try it once. Spend you r time and money trying to get some Pliny the Elder if you want to taste a hophead beer done right. I could name countless others better than this. To me this isn't really even a double IPA, just some crazy experiment. My palate was ruined and I won't be coming back. To each their own, if you like this good luck to you."
"The drinkability on this Stone DIPA is high, it is about as drinkable as Stone IPA. The beer was so remarkably drinkable and balanced that I am wondering if it already had some age on it when I bought it. This is the first bomber of Ruination I have had so I am not sure what to compare it to. Stone has definitely taken hold of the title of My Favorite Brewery."
"A verys solid DIPA, but I wasn't overwhelmed as I expeced to be. Clear copper body, nice whtie head. Smell does have a fair amount of hop aroma in it, but it seems like there could be even moreso. This does have a nice sweet presence that is missing from way too many big beers these days, which helps to accompany the larger hop profile. This did fulfill my hop fix, but it could've been more over the top, which I almost expect from the style. Or have I become tollerant of high hopiness? Either way, thanks to Twilight for sending me this long sought after sample."
"Overall, this was a good, creamy, colorful beer. """Luscious," said Grover - and I agree."
"Dark flourescent orange with a huge white head and stubborn lace throughout the tasting. Flowers, hops, resin dominate the nose. The nose pales compares to what follows. Crushing, oily hop juice with some carbonic bite in the middle. Long bitter finish with a medium to full mouthfeel. Unfortunately, for me, unless you are just a serious hop-maniac, a pint is more than enough for this brew. Maybe it is the ad copy on the bottle, but I can't really taste anything else but hops, even now. I guess it's unfair to say this beer has a """finish""" at all. Maybe after a garlic clove and some Scope. It is a fine beer while your drinking it, but like an annoying ex with your unlisted number, it never seems to leave you alone."
" The nose is floral, and infused with a dry, citrus aroma. The taste is, """a liquid poem to the glory of the hop, """ as the bottle says. There is just enough malt to prevent this from being unbalanced in a bad way. As it is, this is unbalanced in a good way. The hops are a rainbow of citrus flavors, and they do run the entire gamut. Bitter oranges and lemons, grapefruits, and then, a slight pineyness at the end. The mouthfeel is light for the style, but it does coat one's throat. I must give this a lower drinkability than I would normally give the style because of the extreme hops. Do not drink this if are prone to heartburn, or face the consequences. I am not afraid."
"I hate to say it, but the booze was really out of control for me in this beer. Still pretty good, but the least best I've had from Stone."
"Appearance is hazy amber with some white foam, but little lacing. Aroma is (as a Stone beer should) mostly hops. Grapefruity, leafy, aromatic, floral hops. Initial taste is sweet malt, surprisingly, but the hops are there! Sourdough bread, toasty crackers, and creamy smooth. The taste mellows in the mouth down to some nice fruity flavors, drying nicely to a smoth finish with some yeast bread. This is a good IPA  and lots of alcohol!"
"Has a truer American IPA ever been brewed?"
"Overall = Right up there with Dogfish Head 90 and Hercules as my favorite Double IPAs. Highly recommended to fans of this style."
"Drinkability - a great balance of big beer alcohol, hops, and malt that make this beer this good this long after purchase."
"The Ruination is a golden orange with thick and chunky head that sticks to the glass. A nice amount of CO2 bubbling up from the bottom. It smells of potent hops, citrus, and sweet smelling flowers. Tastes just beautiful...intense hops!!! Almost like chewing on a fresh hop (which if you've never done I recommend trying) Slick, sweet citrus...orange peel maybe. I think the mouthfeel is perfect...not as dry as some double IPAs. I give this a thumbs up for drinkability. Not weak, which keeps it from getting a rating of 5 on drinkability. But other than that it is just great to drink. Cheers to Stone for a great double IPA!!"
"I wouldn't get carried away with this, it's definitely not a session beer, but it's a very well done IPA, and one of my favorites. Stone comes through again."
"Nice mouthfeel. I had hop flavor hanging on 30 minute later."
"Either way, this bottle if quite a good one. I'm a big fan of the regular IPA but I would have to say that I prefer this excellent brew from Stone."
"Surprisingly drinkable. Where did the bottle go?"
"The smell is ultra hoppy and the taste does not dissapoint. For some there may be too much of an alcohol finish but for me the slight twinge of some alcohol was a nice fit. This seems like it would be a nice nightcapper type of beer."
"Pours a clear golden amber, nice tight head forms. Smell is unmistakenly hops, as soon as the bottle is cracked pine fills the room, very spicy and my nose is ruined now. Taste: I don't know, my taste buds won't function after the first drink of insane hoppiness, seriously. Slight alcohol burn/warming, but pleasant. My taste buds feel numb, insanely hoppy with a very thick and chewy backbone, this is one kickass beer, I could drink this all day every day. Thanks for the import DrJay."
"I can see the hoppyness getting to you after a while, but this was a pretty darn drinkable beer- besides being tasty, I couldn't sense any alcohol in it at all- a great find."
"I can drink one of these from time to time. But nothing like Alpha King, which I can dink all night."
"Sports a blast of citrine - citrus and pine - hops. Layers of chewy sweet malts. This is like a napoleon - it's not terribly complex, or anything, but it is spectacularly good. It's totally rewarding."
"Bitter in the aftertaste. Yes, but after that? Good, but maybe too hop-oriented?"
"Orangebrown beercolor and a light yellow head. Nose is almost pure C(itrussy)-hops, lots of peachfruit and a light mostly caramellic amber maltnote. Taste is very bitter, hanging, citrussy but with it litle roasty and malty. Carbonation is ok but mouthfeel is mostly bitter. Good and well drinkable beer if you like your beer bitter to the max."
"The guy that designed this beer had drinkability in mind. This is so well done, it's hard to criticize anything. I could drink this 'til the cows come home!"
"Amazing beer...'nough said..."
"Well done. Highly drinkable, although too much hops tends to make me not feel too well in the long run ( a weird hang-over kind of thing), so that takes away some in that it limits the amount of the hop monsters I can drink in one sitting."
"I expected this to taste a bit more hoppy. It's very sweet, and I feel that Stone's regular IPA is more palatable. Still, it's a good taste. Some sweet candy like flavors with a real biting chewy hoppiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, but the hoppiness is a bit oily and chewy. Still, refreshing as hell on a hot night."
"Huge, dense, cream colored head fades slowly leaving a sheet of lace around the whole glass. Candied flowers and chewy grapefruit in the aroma. Transparent golden beer with a few streams of tiny bubbles rising from around the bottom edge. Sugary tea and chewy grapefruit sit on a solid malt base. Alcohol and a fairly strong bitterness kick in towards the end. Bitterness lingers for days, but isn't overwhelming. Body isn't too heavy, just a pinch chewy. A solid IIPA that's makes a good representative for the style."
"I have limited experience with double IPA's, and found this one very harsh. Stoudt's double is, IMHO, much better."
"Perhaps I should have heeded the warning on the label and should not have attempted this beer yet, as I can't consider myself a """confirmed hop head""". Granted, this is definitely a respectable brew, as expected, but in my short time as a serious BA, there have been other IPA's that I would rather drink before purchasing this one again."
"By the end of a bomber this beer can get to be a bit much, but it is obviously well made."
"Overall this is a beer made to be extreme and nothing else. It succedes in that sense, but it is devoid of any type of balance to it."
"It's ok, dog."
"Poured from a bomber into my Duvel tulip. The head is fiesty and rises fast, yellowish/orange-tinged head, dense and full-figured, long-lasting retention; leaves a nice sheet of lace on the glass. Smell: Grapefruit, lemons; grapefruit, grapefruit! And a subtle undertone of caramel. Taste: Sharp, very sharp blast of hop bitterness like a citrus-razor across the tip of my palate; the middle tugs out some malt background, subtle, like a pinch of cotton candy, but damn those hops zip back into the foreground with the quickness; this brew is like a hop headlock. Aftertaste: An incredibly long echo of hop zip and sting. Mouthfeel: Slick, fairly well carbonated. This is a beer brewed for hopheads. A beast."
"Pours red brass with a frothy white head. Smells of aromatic floral and citric hops, grapefruity. There is also a nice malt profile in the nose, more than I would say is characteristic of other DIPAs, and also an estery, yeasty sweetness. Initially tastes of primarily grapefuit hops, with more of a piney note in the finish, and a very evident, almost biscuity malt presence that balances the hops very nicely. As in the aroma, there is also a yeasty element in the flavor that hits just before the lingering bitter and slightly alcoholic finsh. Coats the mouth nicely, little carbonation. Overall a good, well balanced beer that is very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: The bold hoppines makes it a bit uncomfortable but it is still a well balanced and well hopped beer. The light fruitiness and caramel character make it enjoyable, but it's not great in my book."
" Pours a clear golden orange. Head falling to a white collar supported by fine beading. Aroma of orange, spruce, sweet malts. Nice bitter and resinous hops. finishes with Crystal sweetness. Very refreashing and not as hop dominate as when first tasted. Very drinkable. Always welcome at my house."
"Beer presents itself as a relatively light IPA, almost an APA, minus the hops. This is a very sweet, very drinkable, a very good beer."
"Drinkability: For such and intense beer, the drinkability is reasonble. Certainly easy to finish off a bomber or two."
"I like it, though, there are much better double IPAs (yulesmith and 90 minute come to mind...)."
"Frankly, I'm not that excited by Stone's choices of hops for their IPAs. Maybe I'm biased toward the Pacific Northwest """Four C's""" hops styles and expect more of that sort of taste from a California IPA - that's not to be found here. Stone's hops are more floral, acidic and bitter without much of the richness you'd normally find in a West Coast brew. Personally, I'll be looking quite a bit further North when I'm looking for an IPA (or double IPA)"
"The taste is like marmelade on toast (candyish orange and toasty malt). Heavy bodied, lots of carbonation, but an ale this heavy needs it. Almost puckering at the finish. This is one beefy IPA! I guess that's only reinforced by the fact that I've got a nice big bomber of it. This is fairly drinkable of you're feeling like a tough guy. Cheers."
"Drinkability- One is enough for me, but only because if I had another, I probably wouldn't get a full effect of the taste because half my buds have been destroyed. Excellent brew that is a must for any IPA lover. Glad I have a few more stored away."
"World-class I.P.A. here, but what else would you expect from Stone Brewing? Pours a tight, lacy head out of my bomber. Smell is definitely intriguing, with heavy citrus and pine notes. The smoothness is totally captivating, with no offensive bitterness whatsoever. Somewhat sweet and low in carbonation, this brew is dangerously consumable. Highly, highly recommended!..."
"I did it like this, as a project beer. For as you take a drink, it stays with you for so long, you can really get some things done inbetween sips. A truely delicious workhorse of a beer!"
"You better hit Ruination back or you are down in the first round. Consider Ruination as Liston and your tongue as Patterson. Be prepared for a beating. Tremendous. Fabulous."
"Pours lightly hazy orange/gold with a thick off-white head that last and lasts. The aromas are pungent; citrus, pine, apricot, grass, toast. Surprisingly big malt right away, with the hop character of the beer asserting itself but not overwhelming. Comlpex profile of flavors, peaches/apricots, candied citrus, yeast, mango, piney-floral hops, bread. A Creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel helps this beer go down smooth despite the ABV and the big hop punch."
"Pours a hazy, golden orange body with a fluffy white head and good lacing. Quite pale, with a bit of cloudiness, like peache juice. Intense aroma of citrus, hops and a tremendous earthiness. More intense than their IPA, but still extremely drinkable. After taste is bitter, with a dry, puckering bite. One of the best west coast IPAs I"""ve had the pleasure of tasting. A bit over the top, since I'd prefer their IPA, but this Ruination is extremely tastey."
"Nice hazy, golden-orange in color. Thin but creamy looking head. Huge aromas of pine sap couple with some background citrus happenings. After a while, the malt gave off aromas of orange blossom honey and apricot. Taste was a nice balance of sweet honey combined with a bitter, piney presence that leads into the expected mouth crushing bitterness of a Stone brew. Allowing it to warm a bit brings out its best. Mouth was thick and full, a little silky and very tingly on the tongue. Good stuff, 'specially for the hop head."
"Taste is light tropical fruits, mango. Hops lightly scorch the tongue and throat. Smooth and fruity, but I was put away by the massive booze feel and overall dryness. Drinkability is quite bad. Hop vines grew out of my throat and strangled me."
"A very smooth hoppy beer in the session mold with 7.7 ... bow down."
"Pours a clear orange-amber with a generous off-white head that leaves a medium-sized blanket of foam and light lace. Smells of resin-like piney hops with a citrus edge. Flavor is aggressively hoppy; mostly piney hop and citrus tastes. Nice long-lasting bitter and dry finish. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, with subdued, but long-lasting carbonation. Easy-drinking and flavorful, but a bit less balanced and interesting that the regular Stone IPA in my opinion."
"Wonderful beer, really. Not much more I can say."
"I am glad I took heed of the bottle's warning and saved this one for last. This does indeed ruin the palate. It is worth it."
"Aroma is very fruity, mostly citrus. Big fruit flavor up front. Then all hell breaks loose with the piney hops attacking your palate. You can find a sweet citrus, and dare I say it, even a malty backbone hiding among the hops. A tart and bitter citrus aftertaste, like lemon or orange peel. Flavor is very similar to Stone's regular IPA - maybe slightly more bitter but definitely with more alcohol in the taste. This beer is not for the newbee or the faint of heart. When they say 100 IBU's, they mean it. This beer will bitch slap you if you're a pussy!"
"Not quite the fearsome, palette-destroying beer I'd anticipated. I'd like to get my hands on a fresher bottle, but as it stands, a delicious double IPA."
"I picked this up in Memphis, TN while on vacation, I wish it were available in Houston. The color is golden copper with a tall, sticky head which leaves nice lacings around the inside of my pint glass. Aroma is strongly and solely of citrusy hops, of course this was expected. Taste is a full-on barrage of citrusy west coast hops. There is plenty of bitterness and flavor to go around. Drinkability is a little bit low for such an enjoyable brew due to the over-the-top hoppiness. This is the kind of beer that wrecks your palate for the evening too. This is my second beer from Stone, after their Arrogant Bastard, and all I can say is that they are fastly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"This is my first Stone product. If this is any indication of the ability of that brewery, I need to acquire more of these Stone beers."
"Stone, you are a group of amazing people. When I have my own brewery in the future, I can only hope to uphold the uncompromising standards that you have. Good job with your """liquid poem to the glory of the hop.""""
"Enjoyable and recommended!"
"I'm a big fan of Stone's IPA and my favorite style is double IPA so I couldn't wait to try this. 22 oz. bottle with no freshness date and a very cool green and metallic gold silk-screened label. Over 100 IBUs - I can't wait. Pours into my Chimay chalice an amber/orange with a creamy 2 finger head that reduces to a nice thin blanket. Looks like an IPA or a darker pale ale. Lots of hops in the nose (grapefruit, perfume, flowers, pine) along with some biscuity scents. First sip lets you know that you've found a hophead's paradise. Mouthfeel is thick but velvety smooth and it coats the mouth well. Huge flavor - lots of chewy malts contribute biscuit and nut tones, but the powerful hops (mostly citric and pine) bombard the palate and overtake the malts, leaving a bitterness that lingers pleasantly on the tongue for several minutes. The beer has a warming alcohol feeling and alcohol scents/flavors that come through as it warms. I think I'm in love. The only thing that lowers the drinkability for this beer is the availability and price."
"A ton of hops, but not overly sweet...malty and bitter, but a very drinkable beer. Hint of alcohol in the aftertaste, but the bitter hops are what stay w/ me. The folks at Stone Brewing are tops at what they do...I am one who greatly appreciates it. Thanks!"
"Drinkability and Overall: A very good and drinkable IPA. I've noticed as my palate """matures", I've been not enjoying the huge, hoppy IPA's as much as I used to. Probably just going through a phase. If you're a hop head, this is your beer."
"Revisiting Stone Ruination for the first time in a while. This beer pours a slightly ambered golden color with a small head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is full, lots of citrus and piney hops but with a huge caramal, thick malt backbone that really hits hard. The flavor is damn nice. Sweet and hoppy. Finely balanced sweet and bitter. Stone always makes me a happy boy. I have to say, I found them well before my time here on BA, and I have always respected the beer they make. The feel is thick and wonderful. This beer is much better than I remember it from last time I had it. This beer is well worth trying. So good. So good."
"Pours marginally darker than Stone's regular IPA. That is to say a mostly clear, slightly cloudy orange/amber color. A sticky off-white head tops this one off. Just like the regular IPA, the head retention is remarkable, and the ale gives off sticky lacing. This is one wonderfully aromatic IPA. Pungent hops reek of citrous, pine, and herbs. Sweet esters compliement the bitter notes, while a little alcohol taunts. True to its name, the 100+ IBUs have probably ruined my taste buds (temporarily). Taste is deceptively floral at the beginning. However, that is quickly followed by axe-in-the-face hops. Very sharp grapefruit, orange peels, and pine riverdance on your tongue. Fortunately, Stone is not known for one-sided beers. The hops are balanced by generous amounts of malt and alcohol. Smooth malt, some toastiness, sweet caramel, and some spice break up the 100+ IBUs. Bold mouthfeel lets you know who is boss. Finish is spicy citrous, helped along with warming alcohol, pretty dry. A great double IPA, with some spice and noticable alcohol."
"Thanks to my roommate for picking this up in Arizona over winter break. It was quite a pleasant surprise. This was a very clean looking beer with a clear golden color and a nice slightly off-white head. Head retention was minimal though the brew seemed to be pretty well carbonated. The smell was probably the most spectacular thing about this brew. I can't quit smelling it as I type. The scent is dominated by oranges and roasted hops. The taste is surprisingly well balanced considering that this beer boasts 100+ IBU's on the label. The bitterness is masked by a hint of orange and malts in the initial taste, and the aftertaste lets the hop resins stick to your mouth leaving you craving more long after the glass is empty. This is a fine I2PA and would make an excellent choice for any hop head. I don't quite think the Ruination has ruined the experience of other beers for me though, but Stone's arrogance is forgivable as long as they continue to craft such excellent brews."
"I am VERY glad I finally found this one... and it lived up to the reviews."
"22 ounce bottle. After having this on many occasions, it might be my favorite Stone beer."
"give me another; it's worth the hype. belee' dat"
"This brew is a slightly hazed, golden orange color, with a small cream colored head that leaves behind good lace. The scent is hops, hops, hops, some citrus tones from the hops. The taste is massively bitter, the first few swigs could ALMOST be described as too much, but i loved them. You got your floral tones, bitter tones, citrus, all great hop tastes. Slight alcohol spice, and slight sweet malt. Fucking awsome, a hop lovers dream."
"The carbonation is nice, but it's the only nice thing about the mouthfeel - otherwise the beer seems a bit thin. I'd expect even more resin notes from such a hoppy beer. As for the taste, I'm very disappointed. It's overly hoppy, but little hop flavor seems to come through - only a harsh, unbalanced bitterness. I was hoping for, and expecting, more, from Stone."
"Very smooth for the generous amounts of bitterness. Not the bitterest, but just right for a hop-head session. I have to thank my girlfriend for giving me this opportunity."
"Like I said before, this is the easiest drinking IIPA that I've had so far. Very dangerous. Kudos the Stone."
"his beer, holy crap, the most bitter beer I have ever had. Definitely an IPA because the alcohol is 7.7%. When you open the bottle you smell the hops. Citrus aromas, piney, sticky hop resins, and floral. The color is a beautiful orange brown and a white head on top. First taste is the maltiness and the flavor from all those hops, then about 1/10 of a second later, the bitterness hits hard. I thought it was too bitter. I took me about 30 minutes to finish a 22oz. My burps smelled good though. It was an interesting beer, not sure if I think it should be at #19, but way too bitter for me. Maybe when I'm like 60 and my senses have dulled, then I can brave this brew again. I would definitely try it if you can get it."
"at kuhnhenns thanks clark v v from rate beer for bringing this to share with bieristgut and me. my 1st stone rating. poured deep golden with a white head. aroma,hops citrus, alcohol, malts, honey, pine. flavor,some malts, hops, vanilla, alcohol,hints of pine, grapefruit with sugar on it,. nice balanced beer wish I could get it in the detroit area."
"Pours a clear basic gold under a three finger whipped cream-like head that lasts forever but leaves just a little lace. It features a big pine nose with hints of sweet fruit. With fairly flat carbonation, the liquid sits a bit thick in the mouth. Taste? Yup, there are hops here. Slightly flowery, but mostly pine, there is bitterness from the start, gloriously smooth yet pronounced. Pine sap and espresso combine with a luscious sweet malt to inspire a delicious finish, then the hops come back to leave a dry bite that throws the salivary glands into overdrive long, long after the liquid disappears. A touch of caramel evens out the edges, but they are still plenty sharp. Yeah, oh yeah, it's goood!"
"Mouthfeel is awesome...good body and consistency...smooth drinking goodness. Drinkability is good as well. If I had another..I'd probably drink another...yet another lovely Stone brew. Thanks to Ninjaworm for the opportunity! I must get more."
"Big, huge IPA, just what you should expect from Stone. Oily, sticky and bitter, exactly what a Double/Imperial IPA should be. Careful though, it is 7.7%ABV, but drinks much lighter, but will creep up on you. Just perfect for the style, 100 IBU make this one bitter beer, but not overdone. Could drink these all night, but the night would be over quickly."
"Draught. Golden. Strong, fresh, floral hop aroma. Hints of grapefruit, resin and pine in the nose. A wonderful DIPA in flavor. Cutting, masterful hops with the determination of sperm cells attack my mouth and spin my brain with its long, think, coating bitterness. Really well balanced with a nice malt backbone as well. Ive been off Double IPAs lately but this one is very good."
"This beer comes with serious rep which may persuade drinkers that this is a hop monster with no balance. Untrue as this beer has remarkable balance for such a hoppy beer. Yes, the nose is pure hops and yes the first taste is big, bad and bitter but there is a backbone that makes this among the best Imperial IPAs in the world. Savour it and don't be afraid to have other big beers after a bottle of Ruination as it isn't as scary as the bottle suggests."
"This is a beautiful clear orange beer with a thin but persistant head. There is a sweet flowery smell, almost like a good Belgian Ale, with no hint of what was to come. The taste is sweet and malty, then the hops hit. It is very bitter, but in a very good way. The bitterness doesn't linger as long as I expected. This bottle has been cellared for at least 6 months and may have mellowed a bit. The mouthfeel is pretty good, a bit thin for my taste in something this bitter. It is very easy to drink (the first one) but this is not a session beer. Although it is hard to think of what else to follow it with."
"I found this quite drinkable, but to be honest maybe one bomber is enough."
"Jeez. Well, this beer appears a light orange color with a huge head with big bubbles. Very sticky. Smell is of citrusy, floral hops, and lots of 'em. Tastes of course, hoppy. Very bitter as well. It takes a little while for the sip to finally complete itself. First, there's the assault of hops on the tongue, then a brief flash of beery flavors, then followed up by a bitter dry finish all over the mouth and throat. After adjusting to the bitterness I can pick up on some other flavors, which is good. I thought this beer might just be hops hops hops, which is ok, but possibly boring. However about halfway down the glass the other flavors start to come out. A bit of alcoholic sweetness, mmmm. Probably a good idea to let this beer warm up for about 10 mins, to let the other flavors come out, otherwise it's all hops. All in all a great beer, it has multiple personalities. Go ruin yourself people."
"Notes: Is it just me, or is there something similar in the flavor of all of Stone's brews, no matter what the style? It's hard to put my finger on it."
"To punish oneself with pleasureful hops and intense bitterness is the act of drinking this beer."
"Why oh why did I have to split this bomber? Chalk it up to advocacy I guess. Pours an electric orange with a rather large white head. Nose was wonderfully hoppy but nothing like Dreadnaught which was my measuring stick for this brew (unfair I know). Large grapefruit hops fade slightly into some spicy notes and a decent amount of malt was present as well. This was definetely not a one dimensional beer in my opinion. Drinkability was fairly high for a double. Great value with it's relatively low price (compared to other double IPA's). Stone has done it again. And I shall be revisiting."
"There are plenty of really big IPA's around today, but this one is a superior example, highly hoppy but not tongue-numbingly hoppy. I can't think of any others offhand that have such an explosive, overwhelming hop aroma, though."
"Drinkabiliity: This is the only field where Stone's regular IPA surpassed the ruination. I could drink this beer nearly all day, but not quite all day. As wonderful as it is, it's just a hair too powerful to drink indefinitely, as it were."
"Two friends and myself did a blind tasting of 4 Imperial Pale Ales, and this one surprisingly scored the lowest on all our scorecards."
"Stone is certainly one of North America's finest breweries, and this IPA is a testament to their skill and art. Double IPAs are not my favorite style, but this one is so supremely crafted that I have spent most of the evening with it. Extremely high drinkability! Ruination is a very seductive mistress, and I look forward to raiding my cellar to enjoy her company again, after the leaves fall and autumn becomes a distant memory."
"This is the second brew I have had from Stone. I do admire the effort put into their product, and the marketing of it. They are certainly skilled craftspeople, however, their style of brewing doesn't suit my tastebuds. I tasted this beer with a great deal of open-mindedness and plenty of positive comments from all... but I couldn't get into it."
"Review came from a 22oz bottle with the usual stone look to it. This poured out a murky golden color with a tall beige head. The head lasts a good bit and decent sized chunks of lace were left about the glass, as it was consumed. Very hoppy nose here with citric grapefruit and floral notes galore. Not much else came through just hops, hops and more hops. The flavor was damn hoppy as well, bitter citric hops mainly dominated with a bit of earthy notes as well. This really grabs you tongue and doesnt let go very much the palette destroyer that ends in a long lasting dry bitter hoppy finish. Hmm this is pretty light on the tongue for a Double IPA, with a less than medium body to it. Drinkability is hurt a little by the lighter body but it is still good. I would definitely have this again, as the flavor definitely packs the hops you are looking for in this type of brew."
"purchased in a 22oz bomber at d's six pack n' dogs in steel city. this beer is truely an attack on the pallet. pours a orange -yellow witha lacy head that sticks to sides of the glass like cobwebs. smell is overwhelmingly hoppy, mostly floral and citrus. taste is off the charts. awesome hop coplexity. so hoppy it amost burns...in a good way. mouthfeel is rather oily, and alcohol definately makes its presence known. drinkability is good but, will probobly shock you tastebuds to where anything less bold will seem bland. a hophead's dream."
"Stone has ruined me with a huge, bold hop presence that gets just the right amount of support to prevent it from being a raw hop-mess and instead be an extreme beer with incredible balance."
"From a brown 22 oz. bottle picked up in Vegas, silk-screened label and the usual great original blurb on the back of the bottle. Enchanting light copper hue, like the sun just popping over the horizon first thing in the morning on a clear day. Decent white head with good retention, it leaves a fair amount of lacing. For a beer with this amount of IBU's the aroma is deceivingly light and floral, with hints of citrus and spice. The flavour also starts mild for the slightest moment, and then the hops sucker-punch you in all their glory, so fresh and vibrant that you are nearly picking leaves out of your teeth after swallowing. Intense at first, but then mellowing out towards the finish in layers of different characteristics, concluded with another kick on the finish. A lot of art, science and religion went into perfecting this symphony of hops, and a whole lotta love as well, to rip off Robert Plant. The more I drink it, the more I crave, this confirms that I have truly crossed over to the dark side...er, I mean have become an official hophead. As it warms the malt starts to make an appearance at first sip, a rich biscuity malt that blends seamlessly in with the dominating hops, and then appears once again on the aftertaste in a citrusy tango. Stone has done an exceptional job on this IPA, it is not merely a one-dimensional free-for-all of excessive hops, they've managed to blend a complex and layered beer for those in the know. A rites of passage for hopheads. Full and rich mouthfeel, not oily or sticky for a moment, true alchemy. The next time I am in the U.S. I shall be loading my suitcase with this stuff. It's like falling in love all over again, I haven't felt this euphoric since I managed to see the Pixies live on their reunion tour this year."
"Clear straw coloured, white 1cm head is actually larger than on the regular IPA, but is fully diminishing. Aroma surprises for its not nearly as intense as its made out to be. Straight hops hit the nostrils, earth like, citrus like and mostly fuelic. In mouth, flavors are intense, but hard to put words on. Its very perfumey, somehow leathery, acid, fuelic. Generous alcohol vapours come through. Fine body helps the drinkability a lot with its adequate medium carbonation, but if not thin, its definitely not full. Miles away from a yulesmith or dreadnaughts flexibility. Mostly pure hoppiness and I found nothing to mention about the malt although theres a considerable bill felt."
"Totally irresistible."
"pours a nice crisp orange amber colour with a frothy sticky head. the body is nice and carbonated too. smell is a hop delight, intermingled with pineapple and a bubble gum juiciness. nice. the flavour is equally inviting though leans more toward hop power than sweetness. it starts our failry mild and a touch bitter before moving into earthy hop flavouring which is very strong and then moving into a bit of sweetness before finishin up with earth and hop again. alcohol is noticeable, though not offensive, here and there as well. this one leaves a nice warm, tingly feeling in your mouth and your belly. it's a tasty treat, to say the least."
"An excellent beer that I really enjoy. My favorite Stone brew."
"Overall, I want to try this on tap -- I have a feeling it could have a better showing in all categories."
"finish. left my lips and tounge tingling and wanting more...."
"Drinkabilty--you gotta drink the 24 oz. in 1 sitting --not too hard to accomplish."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden with amber hints with a fluffy white head that leaves a web of lacing down my glass. Aroma is all about hops citrus on top of pine maybe a pinch of floral thrown in for good luck on top of what smells like light malt but isn't. Taste starts out sweet malt and its not light its on the good side of medium and loaded with hops nice sweet floral and citrus flavors mingle in your mouth then it finishes with a good bitter bite on your tounge. Leaving a nice oily pine coating that has the tastebuds senselessly begging for more. Mouthfeel is nice and bigger then it looks on the heavier side of medium allowing the hops room to play. Drinkability is great a tasty Double IPA for sure."
"OK I've been trying to age this beer but keep drinking it instead. Looking at a bottle of this beer (or any Stone for that matter) actually makes me salivate the way really, really good food does when you are very hungry. The bottle burps hops the second you open it. It's a bit thick feeling at first with a thin white head. It has a piney, resinous hop bite that is wonderful. Try one with spicy Mexican or Thai food, Mmmm."
"Beer is good. Happy West Coast beering."
"Heya... as expected super hoppy. Huge hit of lychee, pine and citric bitterness. Rich, warming and a little medicinal. A malt liqour style shot of alcohol right at the end aswell. Nice bitterness. Thanks be to Greg from Stone fro bringing this bottle all the way to Sydney, very nice guy!!"
"Like I said before this is a hop head's wet dream. Don't try this beer if you don't like hops, you won't like it. I love hops and I found this beer to be damn near perfect. I hope to find another bottle to put up for a few years to see what it does with age, if I can stay out of it that long."
"Pours out a deep orange with a nice, frothy head that left good lacing. Lots of floral hops and even some mild, citrusy aromas. The taste held true to the aroma, but was a bit more complex. It goes down incredibly smooth, which could be dangerous because this beer will knock you on your ass! Highly recommended."
"Excellent."
"Had this at the HopHead throwdown...my notes say 'dangerous'. I found this beer rather big. Medium golden when served, it had a prominent sweet pine tree aroma. Everything after that was on steroids: Full mouthfeel, Full malt, with an alcoholic tingle in the finish. Tasty, but a bit more than I usually go for."
"Overall, I must admit I was a bit dissapointed. Extreme beers of this type are quite uncommon in my area, and are often highly regarded on this site, so maybe my expectations were too high. Next time I'll try to take it at face value, as the palate destroying, saliva-evaporating monster that it is, and not build it in my head before even opening the bottle. I definately enjoyed their classic IPA much more."
"Pours a slightly hazed orangy pale golden color with a thick, yellowy-beige head. Deep, piney hop oil aroma, grapefruit and honey-like malt sweetness rounds it out pretty good. Pungent hops and a decent malt backbone make this double IPA quite enjoyable. Hops are very sharp in the finish. Malt shows up nicer as it warms. I think I have to go shave my tongue..."
"while i would love to give this all 5's, i just cant bring myself to do it. the color seems a bit wrong to me, maybe too light?? and the mouthfeel. for a beer this big, i just thought there should have been a bit more substance to it. am i being crazy? yeah, probably. but even with those minor points, this is one awsome beer. id love to try it on tap some day."
"It's exciting, over-packed with character, and a pleasure to drink. The bottle claims are on-target: don't drink a quite, subtle beer after this one."
"Pours out a nice golden / orangish color with a smallish white head. Leaves some nice lacing down the side of the glass. Smells strongly of hops and herbs, with a slight undertone of caramel. Boom! Delicious flavor assaults the back sides of your tongue with bitterness. Tastes slightly of malt, but the main flavor is a delicate balance of what must be many, many varieties of hops. It creates a nice balance overall, but is clearly very well hopped. Finishes very dry with a slight aftertaste that I cannot place. The belch seems to ring of mint or some other herb. Mouthfeel is slightly thicker than I expect for the style, but it is not surprising considering the extensive hugeness of this offering. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Its certainly not for the faint of heart, but any hop lover will relish in its glory. This one is at the top of my list, and I look forward to finding it again... hopefully closer to home this time!"
"I had this beer on tap at the Throw Down, and had a bomber here at home, so I thought I would write a brief review. It pours a bright golden/orange with a nice head, and a light lace (the lace disappears quickly). The aroma is all citrus and flowers, and this is the first thing that you notice on your tongue too. On the back end of the beer is a mid hop bitterness, and just a little alcohol (not too much). This has a medium body, and a good drinkability. I cant handle more than a few high-hopped beers, but this is an exception."
"With a steaming bowl of Anam Cara's soon to be famous chili sitting before me, I knew that I'd reached the part of my hop head throwdown experience were it was time for the ruination of my taste buds. The citrus aroma rose well above the frothy head of my candle-lit 10 oz pour. The amber brown color indicated the presence of some malt. While I felt that malt presence in the beers full body, I couldn't quite taste it. Perhaps, my tongue was too far gone or the hops too strong. Sweet grapefruit jesus, this was the perfect brew to caress and refresh my palate balancing the insanity peppers in that chili."
"Overall- a strong IPA that wasn't a hit or a miss."
"A great beer to be savored."
"With the pour, the beer was a cloudy burnt, copper color. A thick stubborn head formed on the beer. The lace was weak and would quickly slide back into the beer.The carbonation was very active, it was a hectic rising of bubbles in the glass. The hops are biting and sweet. There are tones of sour apples as well--a good sour apple taste. Very good and very hoppy."
"Stupid me, thinking Stone couldn't hop a beer up any more than they did for their IPA. Personally, this is fun for a lark, but not something I'd put in my regular rotation. Still, Stone continues to impress. They know what they're doing - here's hoping they KEEP doing it."
"This Stone Ruination IPA is all about the hop character and then some. I'm tasting herbs, subtle sweet flavors, hops and a tasty smooth finish. Another potent beer from Stone at 7.7% ABV. As with the Stone Arrogant Bastard, this beer raises the bar for American IPA's."
"Medium bodied, but oilyness makes it feel fuller. I still like the regular stone IPA better."
"Amen."
"Wyll-"
"I just had to know what 100+ IBUs is like. I tend to like hops so i didn't think the bitterness would be an issue, and it wasn't. This poured a lot lighter than i expected, almost the color of a belgian pale ale, but with a very nice head. The smell was pure hops. I love that smell. I swear it clears the sinuses like spicy food. The taste does not mess around. It is hops, hops and more hops. I would not say this is the most balanced beer every, but i don't think that is what they were going for. Good mouthfeel from the sharp bitterness and good carb. I thought this was fairly drinkable. All in all very good. I enjoyed it, but i wouldn't say it ruined me."
"Overall very impressive and idiosyncratic."
"Been working on this bottle for almost 45 minutes. About four ounces left in the goblet. Drinking this beer has been a very interesting experience. Excitement filled me as the beautiful orange liquid filled my glass. Reaked of hops and nothing else, pleasant. Once in the mouth the hops became biting. Gripping my mouth and throat all the way. I've always thought hops were my friend. Never would imagine there ever being too much of them. A glimpse of pure bliss that is swiftly destroyed by the crushing force of bitterness drawn out into eternal cottonmouth."
"Update: 1.5 years in the cellar has made this incredible. Finally, the hops have blossomed into an expansive bouquet and the malt pairs well. This is so good, they should release this like Port wine, just so you don't get a fresh one and burn your tongue off. Scores adjusted to reflect the excellence that is cellaring this beer."
"Well a fruitfly poured out of mine. It was still alive and was walking on top of the head, so I know it wasn't bottled originally. It was a reddish golden color with a small head. Citrusy hop aroma, and the taste was dominated by hops. A big beer from Stone!"
"Serving 22 OZ bottle. This is a mighty fine hopped up ale. Pours a nice rich amber color. A nice descent head forms and stays. The smell is a mixture of fruit and hops. The taste is very good: nice and hoppy. If you enjoy Stone IPA then this is a beer to search out and enjoy."
"There is a god and he goes by the name of Ruination IPA. This is an incredible beer all down the board. It pours a sunset looking orange with sappy colors. The head is a slight mocha/white head that is incredible to look at. The smell is a strong citrus smell and the hops will blow your nose off. The malt is there and it adds a nice sweet fruity nose to the aroma. The taste is a hop overload, the bitterness will strike at first but then the sweet almost molasses and fruit will take over and balance out this beer. You can taste a tad bit of alcohol and grain but it is hardly noticeable with the amount of hops in this IPA. Feels medium bodied and smooth and creamy in the mouth, I would drink this any chance I got, this could be the best beer I've ever put to my mouth, yeah it is that good. Stone has just went from a great brewing company to an immortal brewing company in my eyes with this beer."
"One of the good ones."
"The first time I had this last December, I knew after the first sip that I was destined to be a hophead. My brother-in-law and I looked at each other and yelled """Awww, yeaaah!""" And it's been too long since I've had this. Here's to Stone and here's to the glory of the Hop. This is truly a miraculous beer. Even my burps taste good!"
"Expand your world. Before you die, you must have this beer."
"Opens the sinuses, attacks the upper cheeks with that """zing""" sensation; I feel myself getting warm but continue to sip, a willing victim. Macro drinkers would assume they had swallowed a weapon of mass destruction...only the most devoted hop heads need apply here."
"A double IPA experience. Great floral pine citrus smell. Nice dark orange color. Cellared for a couple of months, and found balanced in bitterness and only a bit hoppy. Was interesting with heavy meal. Had it 4.5 years later and its supurb bitterness was apparent."
"Suprisingly easy to drink for such a big beer. The good ol' hoppy cheek pucker, but not nearly as over the top as the taste."
"The ruination is a wonderful brew; it pours a light amber with a reasonably thick off-white head. The lacing is slick and spotty. There's lots of citrusy hops and cedar sweetness with a touch of honey malts, quite similar to its younger sibling, the regular Stone IPA. The mouthfeel is medium thin, and the taste is deliciously intricate: hoppy, a bit of syrup undertow, and with good tight bitternesss at the finish. Not as potent as the Dreadnaught or the I2PA, but you still get a clear sense of high alcohol in the taste."
"Light amber bordering on yellow with a delicate white head. Some lace. Smell was very good with bitter notes and a syrupy estery undertow. Taste was much more subdued than I was expecting from Stone. In fact I think this beer was less abrasive to the pallette than the regular Stone IPA. Up front was that syrupy Double IPA sweetness, which morphed into a more piney bitter taste, but towards teh finsh and aftertaste was a serious toasty flavor more akin to a british beer or a softer New England IPA. This holds its own and is a good beer, but I will stick to the IPA."
"Drinkability: Definitely feel the alcohol hit you, due to the lighter body. I don't recommend drinking this on an empty stomach (bad idea). But, I would get it again if I saw it on the shelf (and I prefer it to the other Stone brew I've had so far: Arrogant Bastard)."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick creamy white head; beautiful. The aroma is great! It has a nice mild malt scent with an intense floral hop arrangement. The aroma hits you as soon as you pop the top. The taste is great as well. It has a rich pale malt core with some light crystal malts. The hop flavor is very nice. It is extremely bitter and piney. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a great drinking beer. It is quite complex and full of flavor. It goes down easy and finishes very bitter; a fine sessions beer."
"Re-review 11-06, PLEASE, what was I thinking? After a trip to SD and many more DIPAs I now realize the beauty of Ruination...bring on the over the top hops! More SD style DIPAs for me, please!"
"The bottle doesn't lie, my palate is gone. No more good beer for me tonight. This is bar none the greatest IPA I've ever had. Fantastic!"
"I can sum this up with words from the bottle - 100+ IBU's! An explosion of bitterness assaults your tongue at the first sip. Surprisingly, this beer had only a slight hop aroma - alchohol dominated the aroma more than the hops. Malt and sweetness are almost imperceptable under the onslaught of hop bitterness. I even had trouble distinguishing hop flavor - it was all bitterness. Nevertheless, I would put this beer up in the upper tier of the imperial IPA's, just a notch below the 90 minute IPA."
"Man, Stone sure knows how to kick my butt with beer! Pours a very gold color with a good head. Smell is of hops and crispness, almost like a pilsner. Taste is absolutely excellent, exactly how a IPA is supposed to taste. Outstanding hops dominate here, with a crisp bitterness and a bold, bitter flavor that the meek cower before. Slight sweetness of the malt bows before the hops of this powerful IPA. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a nice clear golden color with a very sticky head.Whoa what a aroma almost made me sneaze,big piney and zesty hop here no malt aroma to speak of but very appetizing.Taste to be expected was highly hopped to say the least zesty grapefruit and light pine even a slight medicinal note in the finish,.a hop monster I have wanted to try and got exactley what I bargained for here."
"It is medium bodied in the mouth with a crisp and clean feel as well, very drinkable although it could dry you out from the bitterness."
"Ruinations mouthfeel holds together surprisingly well for a brew thats over-hopped. But it gets a little gritty in the end. One almost senses they named this beer with the foreknowledge that an ideology of extremes is imprudent yet destined to achieve mass appeal. They really are arrogant bastards down there. Almost as much as I am."
"Pours a vibrant golden orange with a offwhite fluffy head.. The head didnt retain that well, but that could be due to ABV or the amount of hops something. The smell is a hopheads dream.. piney woodsy, citrus, floral. You name it its in there. Taste is nice and not as bitter as one would exepect. Starts off citrusy then the malt balances it a bit and finishes with the piney floral hops.. This is one hoppy hoppy brew.. Never overwhelming, just a punch of hop love. As the label says dont bother with anything you want to taste after drinking this as your taste buds have been scrubbed into nubs.. Have one of these then have a couple of those Macros that got left behind in your fridge and you wont be able to tell. Hop burps are off the chart on this one. Drinkable yes, would I want a bunch of these.... am I worthy? I dunno im a bit scared to find out."
"What a great beer. Your senses really do go numb while drinking this baby. One of the best double IPAs out there. I could drink this beer all day long."
"I'm a big fan, though honestly, I give slight preference to Stone IPA over the Ruination--of course, I also consider Stone IPA one of the best beers I've ever had. Go figure."
"Notes: Um, come on Stone, you can do better than this. I mean yeah, you now hold the title for world's hoppiest beer. So what? Almost nauseating to get through an entire 22oz. First four ounces are fine."
"Clear coppery honey-peachy in hue with a noticeable ruby glow, the slightly off-white head reached a sticky finger in height. This is an attractive looking beer. The head retention was decent; it faded to a soapy jumble after some time. The subsequent lacing was sporadic and unorganized. The aromas of the bouquet unleash a wrath of citrusy-piney-flowery hops, caramel sweetness underneath. The potency is solid; I found the smells to be inviting but not earth shattering. The palate is tasty; the huge angry hoppiness is so impressively mouth-filling. Before I can even swallow if feels like I have a bushel of freshly picked hops resting squarely on my tongue. The bitterness is formidable but the flavors are very delicious, hugely piney with citrus notes working in conjunction, flowery underneath. The heat of the alcohol is obvious and it imparts some flavor. The harshness is moderate. Pleasant rawness. Maybe this is an inherent flaw of the IIPA but where is the malt delicacies? I wasnt that impressed with the Stone IPA either; this is a bigger beer and, yes, a better beer. I cant refute how yummy the hops are, I just want more malt or even a better blend of hops. 3Fs Dreadnaught manages to be a better-crafted hop monster. I do love IIPAs but I find them hard to review but very fun and enjoyable to drink. Drinking these beers are like going to the driving range a ripping your Big Bertha driver 300 yards over and over again. Yeah its fun but it isnt golf! I want to drive, chip, and putt. In other words, the complexities are lacking, it is just hops. The mouthfeel is medium/medium full with prickly carbonation. This is a very drinkable and lovely beer but I am enjoying it for its brashness. Yes, I would drink this again. I purchased a 22-ounce bottle in Loveland."
"Drinkable? This is a Beer gourmet brew for sure. Drinkable in the same way that Espresso is drinkable as coffee in Oklahoma."
"Big bold hop aroma, cloudy orange red color, wonderful deep and wide hop taste, you get a fresh burst of hops each swallow, it could be stronger to be a real hop bomb but probaly not better. The great taste was raging right to the end. Definitely on my top ten list. I just wish they would distribute to Wisconsin."
"Overall, I'm enjoying this because it's big on hops and alcohol, but it's not as complex as other I2PA's. It's heavy on hops and alcohol and therefore far and away better than the vast majority of brew and actually I don't feel this is Stone's best job of masking high alcohol levels at all. Not a favorite, but it's good."
"ng"
"My only complaint is that it does seem to have a temporary ruinous effect on the palate, making it difficult to pair with food. Overall a very rewarding experience. Once again, Stone has clearly come through for us American hopheads."
"Exceptional head and lacing...smell was a bit resinous yet, slightly fruity. Taste was over the top...bitter, bitterer and bitterest...leaving a fantastic aftertatste...a hophead's delight. Mouthfeel as expected was a bit dry, the way a fine brew like this should be. Not too bad on the drinkability scale, although more than one 22 oz bottle might be a bit much. A must try for hop lovers."
"Orange, pine, tangerine, like some sort of demented marmalade. Just enough sweet caramel hangs around to give it a backbone, keep those hops from burning a whole in the tongue. Smooth, creamy, medium bodied. Those hops keep me coming back for more!"
"Where the regular Stone IPA was outstanding, this beer is merely great. It's just a touch over the top, but still very well done."
"There's a lot here to balance, but it manages impressively and brings an ocean's worth of complex yet smooth, creamy flavor to the table. The strident hops profile gives an enticingly raw edge to the overall perception. The ABV is moderate and is in no way limiting. I'd greedily drink as many of these as I could get my hands on. The blurb on the back of the bottle says this beer will ruin your palate, but in no way does it do that. Rather, it woke my palate, and opened its eyes to how good some beers can be. If every beer I have for the rest of my life is half as good as this, I'll die a happy man."
"I think that Stone may be to me (and a lot of BAs) what Guinness is to the Irish wannabes: infallible. Like Stone but never had Ruination? Buy it. Don't like Stone? Leave it at the store and GFYS! (1st word: Go, last word: YourSelf. Get the picture?)"
"I have to hand it to the boys at Stone once again, this is truly a wonderful beer. Both IPA and Ruination are great, but I'll have to give the nod to the little brother. This DIPA is still a treat and will be a 'go to brew' whenever huge amount of hops are required. Which is most of the time."
"Drinkablity: I could drink it all night although at almost 8% I'd be paying for it in the morning."
"Overall - I was a tad let down, but I am sure I'll come around eventually. Maybe Stone should think more about brewing than the literature on their bottles (which is a beer bottle equivalent of War and Peace)."
"Taste: Bitter. It is quite syrupy at the end. Alcohol in the middle. Very drinkable. Great bottle."
"Golden Yellow color with little white head that leaves fast. Strong aromatic smell of floral and citrus/spicy notes. The taste is nothing short of delicious with a very tangy/bitter flavor. Very bold malts that just please the tastebuds and then a extreme bitter flavor that overpowers everything else and whacks the tastebuds senseless. This beer just shocks your mouth. There are slight pine and citrus tastes. This beer finishes dry with earthy tones and again a slight citrus taste. This is really a quality brew and I think I could drink this all the time. Another great one by Stone."
"Appearance is very, very good - an almost glowing light amber color. Full of promise. The aroma is out of this world. Like Hop perfume! Taste is almost indescribably goood. Unlike other big-hop beers, there is no competition among the hops for taste or character. The hops in this brew are all singing the same, wonderful song. Very well done indeed. Mouthfeel is refreshing, smooth and zesty. As you may have guessed, I had no problems drinking this beer down either. I could easily have several over some pool or darts. (If only distro was a bit better for Stone in my neck of the woods.) A truely exceptional brew!"
"For me this is the pinnacle of the art of brewing. A beer this good does not come around often. Every beer lover should try this at least once. If you are not a hop head before, this beer may well convert you into one. Thank God, Liquid Solutions ships to Georgia. This beer will be on my shopping list during the next beer run to Chattanooga. And when that dreaded ABV cap is lifted, it will be hard to pick up anything else when I see Ruination on the shelves."
"I'll have to quote the bottle on this one: """A liquid poem to the glory of the hop!""""
"I would have been more impressed with this beer if it hadn't psyched me out with the cocky back label. The label entices but also takes some of the mystique away form the brew."
"Pours golden orange in color with a tremendous frothy white head that coats the walls of the glass with spider webs of sticky lace as it ever so slowly dissipates. Nose is very floral and pungent hops with notes of pine, cedar, and a bit of fresh citrusquite sniffable. Even from the first sip, the bitter hops are an assault upon all your taste budsacidic grapefruit rind blended with pine oils followed by raw hop leaves and slick hop resins that coat the entire inside of your mouth and throat and do not go away until you take another drink. Once the initial bite of the hops subsides a bit, some notes of juicy citrus fruit and sweet malt are also noticeable. An absolutely exceptional IPA. The warning on the bottle that your palate will be completely ruined after you drink is quite true; so since I am currently unable to taste anything else, what am I to do? (Except to have another Ruination, of course.) Purchased from Liquid Solutions."
"I pour a chilled sample into my glass. This bottle talks a lot about hoppiness and anot being for """non-hopheads""". Guess I'll try it anyway. The brew pours orange and slightly hazy, no real head develops just a thin layer of off white bubbles around the edge of my glass. Aroma is all hops, which isnot surprising. I get citrus notes mixed with a floral character and even some earthy scents to. Very diverse hop presence. First sip reveals a prickly carbonation and medium bodied brew. Flavor is similar to aroma with hop dominance, some sour notes make me pucker a little and the finish is very dry and piney, makes me want to take another sip. This is a well made IPA, but I personally wish I could detect some malt character."
"Overall Impression: A great beer, no doubts, but as for crushing my palate, this just fell a bit short. In fact, it helped me enjoy a side of Gouda and Sharp Cheddar. I’m thinking I might have gotten an aged bottle, but I’m not sure (no date on bottle). By the way, many thanks go out to weefishheads for helping me acquire this bottle. This is a complex and well-made beer, but I find the Stone IPA to be a bit more hop-intense. Again, could just be my bottle. Regardless, strongly recommended, with or without aging."
"Indeeed"
"I could and will have more than one at a setting. The hops are not so overpowering that you can't have another, no matter what the marketing hype says. Enjoy!"
"This is certainly one of the America’s premiere IPAs, simply outstanding. However, it’s not quite perfect. A bit more malt character/balance, and this bad boy will be unstoppable. Highly recommended."
"White Grapefruit (fresh from the tree), lemon zest, strong pine, oranges and a bit of peppery spice, along with a pungent cannabis bud-like bite awakens and lights up the olfactory senses like no other IPA. A constant alcohol fuminess is there to remind us of the potency of this big brew. I'm Stoned...not that I know what it feels like!"
"The fruity bitterness of the hops overpower anything else in the beer. That's not a bad thing. Big bold bitter hops. So strong they almost burn. Damn tasty though. This beer says it will ruin your palate and it means it. You can forget about tasting any other brew for the rest of the evening. Except this one. Pour me another."
"Golden orange pour with a thick head that sticks around for a while. The smell is incredibly hoppy, with lots of sweet pale malt notes. Very fragrant and citrusy, bit of herbal earthiness as well. Taste is awesome. I think I let this one sit just long enough. The hops are not harsh at all, very smooth bitterness, and very complementary of the malts. Pale malt and honey notes, hints of caramel, it is all surrounded and supported by subdued piney-citrusy hops about as perfectly as one could hope. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, and the beer is very refreshing, and my only complaint is that it could stand to be a bit better carbonated. It's far from flat, but just under what I would subjectively consider perfect. This is definitely on the """Buy Again""" list."
"Poured a bright orange color with a medium sized white head. Lots of lacing. The smell is pure hops and the hoppiness almost burns my nose hairs. But the taste brings about much more complexity and shear brillance. Many different hops. The hops start out floral then become bitter then almost a crispy, citric hoppiness finishes. Malt is weak but is definitely needed. The malts seem earthy and provide some sort of base. The alcohol is not noticeable at all, I don't know how considering its strength. This beer was very crisp and every taste lingered in the mouth. I had to control myself not to race through the entire bottle. It was that good."
"The mouthfeel was full, smooth and satisfying...and complimented the above aromas and flavor. The drinkablity was very good considering the power contained within this high IBU brew. Overall...a simply fantastic high IBU complex IPA that is a must try for any hop lover. You'll probably want a case of this."
"Cloudy orange color with a nice head. Had a really big floral sweet and grainy malted smell. First thing that hits you and last thing that hits you are HOPS. Very tart and almost bitter hop juice twang with flavors of grapefruit rind, orange and resinous raw hops. It does have some floral notes and has a good sized backbone of malt to help a little with the enormous amout of hops. I am a hop head to some degree and this one is over the top."
"A wonderful hop aroma, good (but not great) malt balance, good color. The hefty alcohol presence is masked well, which is tough to do with an IPA. Stone comes through. A bit syrupy."
"Starts off with a nice floral hop flavour and ends with both floral and bitter characteristic. Malt balance is not bad for a 100+ ibu beer."
"Very drinkable on purely interesting craftmanship, but still one of the best tasting enormously hoppy and bitter beers I've found. Yet another unique take on the big or Imperial IPA style, very much Stone through and through."
"Big thanks to LongBeach Bum for this bottle, allowing me to retaste it, re-review it, relive it, re-invigotate myself!"
"A complex malt and hop taste at work here that is really over the top. That's the only flaw I see in this brew. The hops are too overpowering, hence the name Ruination. I could not drink more than a pint in one sitting or I would have no taste buds left. But I do enjoy it from time to time, because Stone brews excellent quality beer."
"Thick, full, round and creamy mouthfeel. Great drinkability for this hop monster. Another quality Stone brew."
"This is a good beer and I can understand why it is in the top 50."
"I havent had an IPA yet that left my tongue wondering what the hell happened the way Ruination did. It is quite easy to drink although after one Ruination, you wont be able to taste any other beer. After that, I was done for the night as my palate went into meltdown. The resulting hops burps almost killed my dog, who got too close once. Ruination is one of the biggest, baddest, hugely hopped IPAs around. If you want to challenge your tongue, go no farther than Ruination."
"The feel is great with a nice creamy body that finishes with a crisp departure. Drinkable in some quantity when mated up to a good main course."
"A light, almost straw colored IPA by Stone with little head. The smell wss very fruity, almost citrusy. The taste was very fruity, yet semi bitter. It had a very hoppy taste as well. This was not as good as Arrogant Bastard. I found it to be somewhat unballanced. Too hoppy for my taste. I'm a big fan of IPA's, but this one doesn't do it for me."
"Hazy peach color with an average amount of off-white head that laces quite nicely. I expected the nose to be a full-on dose of hops alone, but the malts were surprisingly evident as well. Sweet, flowery hoppiness abounds with a hint of what I liken most to molasses-like malts. It took me a few minutes to adjust to the taste, but I grew to really like this one a lot. Hops ebb and flow throughout as they dance quite gracefully with the base malts. An anise-like spice flavor amidst the citrus and floral tastes. The mouthfeel was quite remarkable--neither clingy nor astringent. This beer is not a mere novelty, as I feared it could be; it's a keeper."
"Altogether wonderful, but not one of the hoppiest beers around. This beer could win an award for the hops-belch alone."
"Not to drink with any food, as I had a shrimp cocktail as my glass was almost done and it was tasteless. My tongue was still in shock. Great beer."
"And thank you Eyechartbrew for bring this from West coast to East coast."
"My second taste of a Stone beer.Pours a nice hazy golden yellow with a very minimal head.Reeks of hops,hops and more hops-citrusy,almost lemon like.Tastes of hops,hops and more hops as well.Nice after bite on the tongue.Extremely bitter.Full bodied-not as smooth as the Arrogant Bastard but not unpleasant.A great beer overall-really enjoyable.As the remainder of the bottle warmed a little it was even more pleasant."
"P.S. I thought hop burps were just a joke. Wrong."
"Stone pours a rich golden color with a large white head that reduces after a minute or so. The smell is sweet hops that just seem to jump out at you. The first sip is an attack on your tongue, hops explode in your mouth and seem to numb out all other taste. Despite the initial reaction Ruination is not over powering. It is balanced with a nice amount of malt and even minutes after you can still feel the alcohol esters evaporating off your tongue. Truly delicious."
"Pours out a nice hazy orangish color wiht a fading head that leaves a lot of sticky lace. Hops hops and more hops on the nose, i love the smell of this beer, very spicy. The taste has much more malt then i expected wich is great because it really holds up well to the blast of hops. This is a top notch offering with a nice mouthfeel, wuite chewy and smooth. I could drink it all day."
"Overall a good beer. Drinkable and delicious."
"Bottom line: Another interesting, powerful brew from Stone. A real treat. Despite the intense flavors, the beer retains its drinkability. I would love to get a chance to have this again."
"Drinkability: One of my top 5 beers ever. Tons of hops, but still balanced. Stone = Good."
"This beer pours a dark golden color with a 1cm head into a pint glass with some beer to spare in the 22oz painted bottle. Without even really trying, all I smell is hops. Citrusy, piney resinous hops. In fact, if I take too deep of a breath, I can feel an itch on my soft pallet the aroma is so strong. The taste is more of the same - hops, hops and more hops. You can feel the hop oils trickling down your throat - don't believe anyone who says this beer is balanced. It has enough malt to have a good, heavy mouthfeel (and high ABV), but I'll be damned if I can taste any of it. Probably the hoppiest beer I've ever had or will have."
"Poored from the bottle with a nice golden amber color and a nice off white head that stays for the duration. Wonderful floral, cirtus, and a pine smells accompany this beer. I expected this beer to have more of a bitter taste, instead it is very smooth with a just little bit of a bite to it. The bitterness becomes more apparent upon warming, but is still very smooth. Ruination IPA is quickly becoming one of my favorites."
"Pours a golden amber with a cappuccino-like white head that leaves a beautiful white lace down the side of the glass. Aroma is fairly medicinal, and obviously quite hoppy. Also, there is some citrus going on. There's also some pine and a touch of malt. Taste is absolutely hoppy. Starts out floral. The name of the beer is """Ruination""" because it ruins your tastebuds after the first few sips. This is dead on. Eventually this goes to malt, and finally it ends earthy. Medium-bodied. Fairly creamy mouthfeel - not at all what I was expecting. This is a tasty beer, but doesn't seem much different that Stone IPA. For a hoppy beer I prefer Hop Devil."
"I really enjoyed this brew. I was continually impressed at how smooth this brew was despite all the hops. I was incredibly drinkable, and while I probably couldnt drink too many of these (simply because I wouldnt be able to walk to the fridge after more then a couple) it sure would be enjoyable to try my best."
"Taste: I don't mean to sound cocky, but I expected more bitterness. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to go around, but I just expected more. So much more balanced than I expected, with so much fresh citrus flavor I feel like I've just bitten into a slightly under-ripe orange, peel and all. I've never had a beer this juicy. It reminds me of a much more intense SN Celebration. A slight earthy, funky flavor jumps into the mix for a second, only to be beaten down by more orange-citrus flavor. I can feel my mouth watering as I drink this. Excellent, excellent beer."
"I wish Stone the best of luck everywhere you go."
"Yum! Thanks to Gusler for the bottle - I need more!"
"If beer were Nascar, this would be the Jimmy Spencer of big-ass IPAs. Mr. Excitement, baby."
"The cult status is utmostly deserved here."
"Medium gold color, medium head. Aroma is grapefruity, citrusy and a whole lot of hoppyness. WOW. This is the ultimate BIG BOLD IPA. Complex flavors. The big fruit maltyness is balanced by the incredible hoppyness. A beer of extraordinary contrasts. Smooth taste is balanced by a big sharp hop bite. The taste is malty and fruity and sweet and bitter and sharp while at the same time its not. Definitely worthy of the hype. Amazingly well made beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is bitter. Etched/painted beer bottle."
"pours a cloudy hazy orange-ish brown, with a cream colored off white head that sticks around. pungent tropical fruit malt backbone behind a searing citrusy pine hop presence. prickly, perfectly carbonated, smooth and rich on the tounge. sweet malty flavors stand up incredibly to the all out hop blitzkrieg. hops are a bit more piney than citrusy. bitterness is pronouced but not overbearing. alcohol taste is non-existent, but the brew begins to warm you after 1/3 of the glass. aftertaste lingers for days. a rolls royce among imperial ipa's, this baby is crafted beyond belief. supremely enjoyable."
"An orangey gold color, quite a bit of haze is present in this beer. Pours with a decently thick cream colored head. Smells of hay, a field of grass with some sort of spicy blooming flowers, slightly lemony. There is a solid mouth feel presence, it coats the front of the mouth. Of course it is quite bitter, but in no way is it out of balance, quite remarkable for that in fact. The hop flavor is crawling out of this beer all over the place. The bitterness stays with you after one swallows. A complex floral, orangey (though only slightly), apricot (but just a hint) mix of flavors. It is like sucking the nectar from an aromatic-fruity, but not particularly sweet, flower on some unspecified aromatic herb (of course this would be a hop). Effectively saturates one's taste buds as the bottle has promised. I am still struck by the fact that, though this is utterly bitter and hoppy, it is not perceived to be too over the top. There is a solid malt backbone that, though effectively hidden by the hop attack, is what makes this beer possible, it is what brings this beer to the next level."
"Hazy apricot color with an off-white head that rises up from the top of the beer rather than just sitting on top, and then slowly recedes like a wave crashing on the shore. Sweet aroma of hops and honey and butterscotch candy. Mouthfeel is smooth. Flavor is big juicy hop bitters right upfront. Grapefruit rind and piney notes, just a bit of sweetness from the malt riding beneath, as well as some honey and butterscotch, but it barely peeks out. ABV mixes in well, doesn't take over, but sends a soothing warmth. Good sipper, except I'm not sipping..."
"first off this is one of the coolest bottles ever. ive sat on this for a few months mainly because i just havent gotten around to drinking it. it poured out a beautiful pale orange with a small head that left a nice lace. one of the nicest looking brews in my opinion. the smell was of potent hops (duh) with a little citrus. the taste is, well, hoppy. very hoppy. it had a wonderful hop bite but didnt come across as bitter. infact it was really smooth and drinkable for a super hopped IPA, there is some nice malt flavour detected and a little alcohol spice to boot. pretty easy drinkin for the high alcohol content and giant hop character. it was a very enjoyable and it won me over big time. is it going to become a regular for me? no i doubt it, but it will for sure pop up on special occasions. damn fine brew."
"Wow! If there was an Imperial IPA category on BA, then the Ruination would certainly be at the top of the field! There's plenty of delicious hop bitterness to be had, but unlike most high IBUs, this is beer, and not simply hops for hops sake! A fantastic beer, and certainly one I will have again!"
"Ruination is a big I.P.A. Fans of the style will adore this beer. The 7.7% abv is handled and delivered nicely. You really don't notice it in the taste, but eventually it sneaks up on you. A little one dimensional? I don't think so, Ruination fails to disappoint."
"Drinkability: This all hinges on whether or not you are a hophead. If you are, this is right up your alley. If not, I'd recommend you find a friend (hopefully a fellow BA) with an adventuresome palate. Certainly worth the experience. I know what my brother will be getting for Xmas..."
"Update  This is a staple in my house, so I thought that Id re-review it with a batch from 2004. Is it still a perfect 5? Even after a bottle or two a week of this stuff its still perfect and I still havent found a better IPA."
"Notes: Solid beer. Would be hard to put down, or pass by. A don't miss beer! I like my beers hoppy but balanced, and this one does the trick for me."
"Pours out an orange color with thick off white head that dissappears slowly but leaves a sticky lace on the glass. Smell of hops is obvious and some malt. Tasted intial chocolate malt but that was soon overtaken by the strong spicy hops with a slight bitterness at the end. Very little carbonation and a medium but dry mouth feel."
"This beer pours a couldy orange color with a small head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy - like most micro IPA's. The flavor was very hoppy and spicy as the aroma hinted at. This is a good representation of the IPA class and if you're a hop head, this one is for you."
"Managed to have some of this on tap at OBF. It was still impressively hoppy, and the aroma was very grassy, but it was probably better in the bottle."
"then it finishes with overtones of carmel malts. nicely balanced considering the magnitude of the hops. very good mouthfeel, carbonation is there but not too much to where you have to fight with it. a very wonderful , beautiful beer. truely """a liquid poem to the glory of the hop""""
"Source: Liquid Solutions"
"Fresh hop flowers in the nose as well as the smell of citrus candy sweetness(malty). Lots of little bubbles and carbonation in the hazy orange nectar. A thick creamy, fluffy, white head stays stiff and persistant in the glass. Initial intense sweetish orange flavor followed quickly by sharp bitter chewy orange skin/rind taste. It is unyielding in its citrus bitterness thereafter. A slightly sweet tip of the tongue is left in the finish as well as dry bitterness on the back of the tongue. Medium mouthfeel with some smooth silkyness on the palate. Lovingly brutal to the tongue. Very good ... and not for the timid. I am cellaring a few to see how it mellows.... yea right."
"After trying a small sample at AOBF, I finally cracked open the this 22oz. monster that I smuggled into Utah. Poured a bubbly copper with a big spritzy white head. Smell was nice and hoppy, but not overly so--it smelled like a good regular IPA does--only with a little more alcohol fumes present. Taste? WOW. Just as I remembered. Initially slight malts fighting hopelessly against an increasing hoppiness. As it goes down, the bitterness reaches maximum threshold levels and stays around whether you like it or not. Even though the bitter hops are unbelievably over-the-top, this brew is balanced enough to easily let me finish all 22 hop-bursting ounces. Mouthfeel is great--just right. I don't think I would drink this regularly, but it's amazing enough to keep me coming back (when I can get it)."
"Over all a great IPA. I will definately purchase more of these. I also think Stone Brewery is coming in to it's own. Their getting more creative, taking chances and their consistency is excellent now. Not the way it was in the past."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to large sized white bubbles and amber orange transparent body. It has a strong hoppy aroma and a strong hoppy flavor to boot. It has an initial hop flavor and a strong hop finish. You can summarize the brew in 1 word! HOPPY. A true hopheads delight."
"Frothy white head which disipates quickly. Nice strong hop aroma which is full of grapefruit and a nice floral accent. Amber in color with a hint of redness but lighter than other super strong IPAs i have had. Low carbonation but not so low as an English Ale. The low carbonation allowed a hoppier accent to come through without bitterness. The flavor comes on strong and is balanced very well with a clean but notably hoppy finish. Fusel alcohols are present and warms the palate and throat. Excellent IPA that follows in the tradition of big west coast beers"
"Wow, do these guys have more beers than any other brewery in the world? Anyways, I found this IPA to be similar to several of the other American IPA's I've had (particularly the Rogue). Fruity, hoppy, hoppy, and hoppy. I liked the ABV, which is well hidden and provides a nice buzz (literally!). A wonderful smell, a nice fruity taste. Mouthfeel is dry and bitter, and this is certainly a hop-heads' dream. I am not, however, a hophead. I enjoy this kind of beer on occasion, and it is as good as most (I like the Two-Hearted and the Alesmith more), but if you're into this style, seek it out. It will definitely deliver."
"Slightly hazy orange with caramel accents forms a nice 2-finger head of light beige atop small to medium-sized bubbles. The head is meringue in consistency with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Aroma is very floral, fresh green hops with a complex, pleasant, and fresh aromatic quality to them. There is a brief glimpse of some toasty caramunich notes if you close your eyes and concentrate really hard. Everything else that may be there is completely overpowered by the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth with a wet finish and moderate acidity. Taste begins suprisingly with smooth malts, then acrid, pungent floral flavor hops..a wave of peppery drying alcohol assaults the mouth, followed by a toasty, then raisiny malt note appears towards the end. The finish is of potent, unbalanced herbal bitterness. Again, this is another intense brew from Stone, but completely out of balance which severely inhibits drinkability. This is a decent brew, but in my opinion, it is way overrated. A ton of hops does not a good beer make."
"When poured, it produced an yellow/orange hue with a little foam and nice lace. The smell of malt's compined with the hops gave a very pleasant aroma. The taste was like I was drinking a mild Barley Wine Beer. The sweet/bitterness was well balance while drinking in the mouth and palate. The bitterness is not overpowering, just nice a suttle. Rated right up there with Stone's great beers!"
"keep drinking it to stay ahead of the hops!"
"Initial flavor is a big brazen hop zing that eventually allows a long caramel malt to temper the finish."
"The bottle says, """A liquid poem to the glory of the hopp""" and it's no exaggeration. This beer is one of the hoppiest IPAs I've ever had, but it's very good stuff. I buy some nearly every time I buy beer now. I'm in southern california, so I might have to figure out an excuse to travel down to San Marcos!"
"This beer poured a nice copper color, with a large white head. The smell is simple, HOPS! Very flowery, hoppy smell. The taste is a great flowery/citrusy hop flavor with just a touch of malt to bring you back to reality. The lace left in the glass is wonderful, although I tried to get every drop that I could. This beer packs a punch, not as much as DFH 90 or Dreadnaught. I enjoy that the alcohol presence is not as severe as the two I just mentioned. Don't mistake however, 1 bomber of Ruination is enough for a work night. This is yet another great beer by Stone, which is easily available, and average in price. This is an excellent IPA that I will revisit often. Thank you Stone!"
"-F"
"Beautiful orange and yellow semi-opaque body. White head with amazing lacing. A whole bouquet of fresh cut wild flowers on a medium soft malted barley aroma. Shocking bitterness. A tornado of hops screams across my palate. Is this beer or hop juice. Amazing. Medium body. The bitterness is exiciting but it is also vicious. This beer is more of an art piece than a daily pleasure."
"I felt the ruination in a 22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep amber/copper color that is slightly cloudy. There is 1.5 fingers of foam that die down fairly quickly. There is a little lace left on the glass. The smell seems to be a little citrus and a lot of hops. I've never smelled anything like this. The taste packs one hell of a hops punch! The amount of hops overwhelmes two-hearted by far. You do get a bit of a piney-fruit mix in with the hops. The mouthfeel is excellent. Drinkability is fairly good. To sum it up, this is my king of hops, at least until I try my dogfish 60 and 90 minute IPAs in the fridge."
"This beer is definitely potent. I was a little scared, honestly, by the threats of utter palate annhilation. I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while this beer really nails your tongue to the wall, it isn't so overwhelmingly hoppy that it's exclusively for the biggest of hop-heads. Quite good and limited in its drinkability only by it's high alcohol content and intense mouthfeel."
"The beer poured a nice dark caramel color witha nice head. The smell was a strong hop/fruit and other smells I couldnt put my finger on..It is a very busy beer. The taste was strong, hoppy and had a very powder like mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but not my style."
"Originally tasted 19 June 2002. The beer gods smiled down and said, """Let there be HOPS""". WOW. This is a hop lover's delight. This beer, in my humble opinion, defines the """Imperial India Pale Ale""" style, the new & fashionable, super hopped IPA style we've been seeing a lot more of. I prefer to call it, """Über IPA""""
"What do you know? Stone captures my taste buds once again. This big IPA pours a deep copper color with a sizeable off-white head that lasts and lasts. Nose is big on citrusy hops. Notes of grapefruit, citrus rind, and pine proliferate. Taste, as expected, is big on the hops, although I would not say this IPA had a """ruinous""" effect on my palate. At over 100 IBUs, this was just right for my tastes! Mouthfeel was appropriately carbonated, and for an IPA of its size, it drinks very easily. An excellent IPA worth all the acclaim."
"Substantial alcohol warmth; really surprising how the malt characteristics do not ever give up the fight. Enjoyed with some Manchego and some Scottish whiskey cheddar. Really top notch: not sold in Northern New England, this is the """good stuff""" to be cellared and only brought out for special occassions for me."
"I like this beer, but it's not love. Just too one sided for me, but of course it claims to be just that. """A liquid poem to the glory of the hop""" is what it says on the bottle. That it is."
"Pours with almost no head, but had excellent lacing. The color is just about orange. There's a reddish tint, too. Smells and tastes stongly of hops (of course). Superb taste. Almost perfect. Very close to being exactly what I think an IPA should be. It's very crisp and had a clean finish. One of the most pleasant on the palate and drinkable beers that I have reviewed."
"Nice clear amber body with a big foamy head. Nice thick retention all the way down the glass. Aroma is big and citrusy with a biscuity yeast and malt quality. Medium bodied and a bit chewy. has a stinging numbing bitterness from huge amount of hops. Slightly sweet but oh so bitter. Really nice big IPA."
"The first thing that struck me when I poured this amber-bronze, IPA was the remarkable clarity, not a trace of cloudiness. A nice full head left scattered rings of lace as I enjoyed the brew. I must say that this was very well carbonated, constant tiny bubbles throughout entire glass of beer. Enough about the appearance, because I quickly forgot about it as soon as I caught a whiff of the aroma. It was a combination of citrus and clove, and it was wonderful. I found myself sniffing all the way down to the last drop and then took a couple more from an empty glass. Bitter is a word that I would never use to describe the taste. It was well hopped, but by no means over hopped. Along the burst of hops, it also tasted like it smelled, citrus & clove was an undertone to the flavor. A couple of swallows had a slight alcohol flavor, but that had no effect on my overall enjoyment. Besides, who the hell doesn't enjoy the flavor of alcohol."

"Can Stone do no wrong?! If you are a hop-head then this beer will knock your socks off! If you are not used to hops, you better get used to them before trying this great brew. It poured a nice copper color with a good sized frothy head that left a nice spider web like lace all around the glass. Right off the bat the smell is of hops, with a hint of pine and citrus. The taste is a rush of hops right off the bat, followed by some citrus flavors, then some alchohol flavors sneak into the nice crisp finish. Personally, I do not find these types of beers """bitter""" in the traditonal sense of the word, I find them very flavorfull. And this brew is no exception. It kind of reminds me of the Old Guardian Barleywine more than it reminds me of the regular IPA, since the regular IPA seems more harsh than this one. All in all, this is a perfect tribute to the all powerful hop!"
"The hops are glorified in every way in this beer. The aroma is dominated by a pungent hop oil, with a bit of pine as well. The taste, as expected, is quite hoppy as well, but not as over the top as I expected it to be. It certainly is not overpowering. Mouthfeel is somewhat oily...it starts off with bubbly citrus flavors, followed by the dominating presence of hops. I for some reason don't think this is the best IPA I have had, but it's damn good, and a great one for hopheads."
"Great beer and one thats quickly addicted me. Too bad Id have to go back to Tucson for more"
"Bam Pow Bash!!! That was my introduction to this outstanding brew. Am I a Batman punching bag in this episode? Anyhow, when you have a need for hops, this one certainly takes care of the fix. A brilliant, slightly cloudy orange color with a puffy white head. AROMA, yes, just like it should be- huge citrus, flowers, grapefruit rind, oranges, probably lemons and limes if I wasn't diving in so fast. This beer has a nice solid body holding in a creamy,milky nectar thats very smooth. The finish is bitter but smooth, maybe a little woody from all the hops. It only lacks a little malt complexity in the flavor, the malt seems a bit basic but does hold up well to the hop explosion. A great hop directed brew."
"Bottom Line: For those of you looking for a Tactical Hop Weapon, this one’s for you. As Goldilocks said, “This one is toooo ‘hard’.”"
"tried other Stone IPAs (or any Stone ale for that matter) so this beer is held to a high standard...and delivers once again. Looks very inviting, hazy golden with a frothy white head and rising bubbles in the bottom of my glass. Smell is sweet & malty, with citrous hops singing my nose hairs. The taste EXPLODES with citrousy hops, all the while hanging on to a strong malt backbone and an inviting alcohol warmth. Lemon jumps out at me, then the sweetness of the malt comes in to fill things out. Nice lingering taste of citrous. I could drink a ton of this..the consequences are worth it! Can these guys make anything other than great beer? Cheers Stone!!"
"Chewy and creamy, smooth and inviting."
"Overall, a very good IPA with an awesome flavor."
" Postscript: After tasting this on draft at the Stone Launch (12, 12@12) at The Blind Tiger, I can honestly say it DOES get better than this! Amazing."
"If you love hops, and you can handle 100+ IBU's this is your beer."
"Wow! I love me a hoppy IPA. Not sure if this is better than Victory HopDevil or Dogfish Head 90 Minute, but certainly in the same league. Stone makes some mean hoppy brews and this is no exception. Pours out a beautiful amber with a very nice white head. Tastes of hops. True to form this brew will kill your palate. But as long as you have this taste is your mouth who cares. The balance is wonderful. This is a top notch brew. Thank you again Stone!"
"As a hop and IPA lover I will be stocking my fridge with more Ruination!"
"Overall a great west-coast IPA. Dry-hopped to the max but still some hints of malt and a nice fruity yeast to balance it all out. That is balanced for a hop lover."
"Thanks to EnTil for the sample!"
"Cheers"
"Overall, this is one delicious beer. I expected the hops to overpower everything else. But at slightly warmer temperatures the malt is strong enough to poke through and the alcohol warms and makes the beer big enough to accommodate all those IBUs. This is an aggressive, deep, """arrogant""" monstrosity of a California IPA."
"Drinkability: Thank the makers that this is a 22oz. bottle. The alcohol is superbly woven into the fibers of this beer. I could drink this forever. Truly an incredible experience. """God bless the yeast, the malt, and the HOPS!""""
"I am beginning to understand Stone, """let's pack all our beers with a ton of hops.""" No exception here. Poure a hazy color, not too light. It tasted, well, quite hoppy. Not overpowering like Stone's other offerings, but still quite hoppy. It was a good sipping, end of night beer, but I could not pop one after another of these."
"Although a bit same-y in comparison to some of the other hopped up Stone beers, there's no denying that this is one helluva kick-ass beer! Flavours are off the scale, drinkability frightening and the effort/passion put into this beer is a beautiful thing, and very apparent."
"Pours a hazy, deep orange/amber with a dense, creamy tan head that never seems to subside. The aroma is strong on hop florals and a bit of pine. The flavor is all hops up front, but then a nice surprising malt sweetness slides in behind all the hops and supports them nicely. Hop bitterness shows again on the finish to clean things up. Very solid mouthfeel is definitely a strong point of this beer. A very good IPA that has excellent hopping levels. Glad it comes in a 22 ounce bottle, because 12 ounces would not be enough of this great beer."
"Don't drink straight from the fridge, let it warm up a bit or the hops will be overwhelming."
"I first poured this one, and started drinking it straight from the fridge. It was almost overwheling at that point, but as the beer heated up closer to room temperature, its incredibly robust characteristics really started to shine. With such striking characteristics, one is forewarned to keep Ruination IPA as your final drink of the night because it lives up to its billing -- """by the time you develop a taste for this beer, you may find that you are permanently ruined from being able to enjoy lesser brews!""""
"Copper in color, small whiteish head, good lacing. After the pour, the aroma filled the room with hoppy goodness. Pine & citrus greet the nose, and entice you to tip the glass and take a swig. Once in the mouth, the hops dominate the palate, coating the tongue with a thick, resiny, oily goodness. Citrus, pine, and maybe some cedar planking in there. Hops overpower the malt, leaving it a little unbalanced, but that is what I have had a taste for lately, it seems. A very large IPA, to say the least."
"Anxiously anticipated. Would it be too extracted? Actually, the hops in this beer may be more finely integrated than in the regular Stone IPA. No brushed metal drop-off on the finish. Deep, dark majestic bronze color suggests the reason. There is plenty of malt in this baby. Not as ruinously bitter as Rogue's I2PA IMO, and better for it. Lots of cedar, cigarbox-like aromas and flavors. Weighty and long. This is more of a marinade for the skull than a beer..."
"Wow!!! I have finally gotten ahold of the Ruination IPA, and I feel that there is so much anticipation behind the rating of this beer. First of all, I love this style and equally important it is brewed by Stone. IMO Stone brewing is revolutionary from the Bastard to the Smoked Porter. So, here it goes, the beer is poured into an official Stone Brewing Co. Pint glass leaving about two fingers of head. A deep copper goldish tint is the hue that this beer represents. As the gargoyle on the bottle stares at me, I attempt my first sip of this creation. WIth my first gulp, I took a deep breath to absorb all of the hop aroma that engulfed my senses. The hop aroma is a floral, citrusy, and earthy mixture of wonderful hops, with a sharp sweetness to the nose it bitters as it splashes down on my tongue with the welcoming bitterness (100 + IBU's) a trace of sweet maltiness tags along to balance out the beer to become a masterpiece. On the back of this bottle there is a warning of the what this beer can do to the palate. I agree that it is hilarious, and that I would not start out with this beer at tasting event. However, it is not to overwhelming for my tastes.... I love hops. If this beer and the Dogfish Head 90 min IPA were tried side by side a lot would be confused about which be was delivering which flavor. I think they are both sickeningly yet amazingly hoppy, yet I think I prefer the 90 min IPA. Definitely amazing a must try for all beer advocates."
"Many thanks to Greg, the Arrogrant Bastard, for making the stuff."
"The beer pours from the bottle a luminous deep copper color with a massive off white head and huge thick sticky sheets of lace to cover the glass. """Oh that smell""" To quote Lynard, """Tis hops""" that greets your nose, chased by a bit of malt and a lemon-lime crispness, quite a Hoot. A tad sweet at the start and the top middling in mouth feel with the finish survigrously hopped with a hard-hitting acidity and a devastatingly dry hop bitter aftertaste. Haven't tasted this much hops since I took a sip of """Hop Oil", which is also a Hoot if you have not seen or tried it."
"WOW. I don't think I can do this one justice or add to what has already been said, but this is one big, bad, malty, insanely hoppy, kick-ass beer that has everything I love in beer. When you pour this mother out, you can tell it is thick and malty and will have the mouthfeel of syrup. The grapefruity, floral, earthy, and herbal hop aromas can be smelled from across the room. After I poured my first pint, my roomate asked if I had been brewing earlier, and said he could smell the hops as soon as he walked in the room. The flavor of this beer is the closest I have come to heaven. The hop flavors are demanding of your attention by hitting you in the face as well as exhibiting some complex subleties. I detect some grapefruit flavors, pineapple, and pine needles in the hop profile. The bitterness is there but not as bad as you would think because the ultra sweet malt sure subdues it. The malt background is sweet like molasses with some buttery and butterscotch flavors that seem to melt in your mouth. All in all a greatly complex beer that is so drinkable for all of its bigness. All other beers taste like water in comparison."
"Pours a dense, cloudy reddish amber color with nice frothy head. The aroma is hoppy, floral - rather subtle considering the blast of hops one gets when tasting it. This is a big beer, wonderfully balanced. Despite the high hoppiness, the hops never seem overbearing and seem nicely balanced with the slightly fruity background. Dense, creamy mouthfeel is superb. I think it's very drinkable, but be wary of the alchohol content. Creeps up on you after a few."
"Ridiculously over the top beers are kind of a pet peeve of mine, as they're usually not very good, but this one works. The head, carbonation, and mouthfeel of this beer are just exceptional. The taste is indescribeable. It's endlessly complex and delicious. I recall reading a reviewer comparing the taste of this to and english meadow. That's really what this reminds me of, although it's been a while since I've grazed at an English meadow. Go out and try this!"
"Okay here's a test for a beer. Bit of a headcold. Olfactory nerves barely functional. Taste buds not doing much better. I should have waited for a more opportune time to crack open the Ruination but I simply could not resist. First of all, is there a brewery with better packaging and narrative on the bottle? I don't think so. The beer pours golden and slightly cloudy with a big thick head with major staying power. The head thickly laces the pint glass all the way down. Despite my headcold that lovely pungent hop aroma makes it through. And from the first taste I know I'm drinking something special. A little tart, a little sharp. The taste evolves and transitions as it works its way over the tonque and down the throat. Ripe melon to grapefruit. Beautiful citrus and herbal notes. Nicely dry and very, very hoppy but in my view not over-hopped. A true hophead, I have never tasted an overhopped beer. It's an abstract concept to me. As I finish my Ruination I can feel my sinuses clear a bit. My sense of taste and smell renewed. What a lovely curative is Ruination!"
"I get a real solid citrus flavor...exactly the type of hop flavor I'm looking for in an IPA..Juicy...and almost sweetish...only on the very long finish do I get a whiff of bitterness from the hops...I'm not sure on the hops but there has to be some Cascade and maybe Amarillio as well....just an awesome hop flavor but quitely balanced by what must be a good malt load because this is not unbalanced on my buds...it is just simply scrumptious....I can hardly put the glass down as I drink...this is what hops are all about...my hat is tipped once again to Stone for a tremendous beer....I wish I had 3 or 4 more of these tonight but then it wouldn't be just my hat that would be tipped...If you like hops you will love this beer...very drinkable and very, very tasty..."
"22 oz bottle, pours a bright copper color, nice foamy head, clings to my glass, intense citrusy aroma, the smell makes my nose tingle, all hops. Nice thick with a full mouthfeel, hoppy as hell, still has alot of malt balance, very good, I want more."
"Let's face it. Stone is one of the best """Big Beer""" producers around. And this beer does that reputation justice."
"I really like IPA's and this one only emphasizes that fact. Once you start to really like the bitterness of hops, you just can't get enough and Ruination doesn't disappoint. An extremely balanced IPA despite the fact that it rings in at 100 IBU's in the bitterness department. Full, rich and yes, you can taste malt here. No, the malt isn't a big player, but it rings the hops down to the point that they aren't as overwhelming as you are expecting. Began the bomber inside and finished while grilling steaks outside in 35 degree temperatures. Delicious. Thanks Murph for the sample."
"Poured a clear copper with a small head. Floural aroma hops are the first thing you notice.  There is something else in the smell that is a bit odd, but doesn't turn you off.  Not as powerful of a taste as I expected, but still very well balanced.  At over 100 IBU's you can imagine that the aftertaste stays for awhile!"
"Pours a beautiful clear copper with a touch of chill haze.  Impressive white foam, which settled to 1/4 inch and remained for the duration.  Nose is full of floral hops and a touch of bubblegum-like sweetness.  Some carmel malt in the flavor, some sweetness, and a ton of in-your-face bitterness.  Very carbonated, slightly rough mouthfeel with a meduim body.  The bitterness is nicely balanced with sweetness, making this a very drinkable brew.  A very solid IPA."
"Noble hop profile, rich and full bodied bliss.  Delightful vanilla/honey and complex floral aromas.  Inviting and well centered A-IPA.  The label acts as a intimidator, but dont be fooled.  Many like-characteristics with Ruination and Anderson Valley Hop Ottin' IPA.  Ruination being slightly superior.  My advice to anyone who enjoys the IPA, sample this.  First class."
"Pours a nice orange/amber color with a moderate white head.  Big time hops, all the way through, this stuff is excellent, citrusy, floral, hop city.  Thank you Xlperro.  This stuff is an all time favorite of mine!"
"As for as IPA's go, this is the bomb. Great stuff. Pours a nice deep golden color. Great hop punch. One of the finest IPA's I have had although it is a bit strong and may not be the beer you want to drink all night. Another great beer from Stone."
"Good but not what this hophead expected after I read the label. Poured IMO a more of a golden pale ale color with almost no head. The aroma was hoppy and only hoppy but not overwhelming.  It had the bitter hop tatse but a very boring one, the character of this beer was the same from the first sip to the last. I would drink it again but there are many other IPA's out there that put this one to shame............CHEERS"
"This beer poured a nice reddish orange color and formed a nice bubbly off white head and left some nice bubbly circular lace. A decent amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus and some floral aspects. The flavor is of hops and citrus with a slight hint of herb. The finish is light and just a touch bitter and extremely astrigent. Not quite as hoppy as their other IPA. A great IPA and another new aquistition for Ohio beeradvocates!"
"To sum up, this is one of the most incredible beers I've ever tasted. Given that it's my first brew from Stone Brewing, I can't wait to try more...I've got a couple more of their beers in my fridge and it's taking all of my self-control to stop myself from trying them right now! My highest recommendation!"
"Described as A liquid poem to the glory of the hop  Yep!"
"Ruination:  I hunkered down, waiting to be overwhelmed with hops, but was not (see red felt ale for over the top hops).  Despite the typically humorous claims on the label, this IPA is much more than hops.  Actually the aroma is very floral, and the taste is very well balanced, with lots of sweet malts to balance out what is clearly a well hopped beer.  This beer is significantly more complex than I expected, and easier to drink.  Very well made, enjoyable."
"Hazy, golden-orange with a foamy ivory head that holds extremely well and leaves brilliant lace. The aroma is boldly full of citrusy, grassy and earthy hops including flavors of grapefruit and pineapple. The flavor is also boldy full of citrusy, grassy and earthy hops including flavors of orange, peach, and tangerine. But there is also some distinct, sweet caramel malt present beneath the hops. This beer is big! Truly an assault on the senses! INTENSE. RICH. FULL. Definitely a """one beer""" beer - especially in the 22 ounce bottle! And yet it's balanced with enough sweet malt that you don't fall over with """bitterface"""! However, the alcohol might get you to fall over at a full 7.7% by volume. Astonishing! However, it should be noted - as it is on the back of the bottle - that this is for the """matriculated imbiber""". Albsolutely worth searching out for the hop head."
"Finally, after waiting all through the summer for Ruination to make its way to Oregon, it has finally arrived and what a joyous occasion it is. An exqusite thick head that never would have violated the sides of my glass, no matter how far it would have rose above the rim and that laces the glass nicely. Piney hop aroma that embraces the nose almost affectionately. Although, the color has a decent copper ale'ish hue to it, I can still read what is on the other side of the glass. Then again, don't judge a beer by its color, this is one great tasting beer. Hoppy, citusy flavor in every mouthfull will keep even the most finiky hophead happy."
"Wow. This is one kick-ass IPA. Inviting, seductive copper/orange hue with a creamy off-white head. Exceptional aromas of pine, orange, grapefruit, grapes. Sweet floral fragrances. I expected to have my tongue numbed upon impact by the hop bitterness, but I found this brew, even upon the initial taste, to be extremely smooth and balanced. There are hops aplenty, but they are intricately layered upon a wonderful malt foundation. In fact, I am almost as impressed by the subtle sweetness as I am by the over-the-top pine and citrus hop flavors. Of course, the hops assert their presence in the finish, and in fact my tongue is becoming a bit numb as I work my way through the glass. What a terrific feeling. Add this beer to my top-ten list, thank you very much."
"Copper/orange color. Monster head sticks around to decorate the sides of the glass. Huge citrus, pine cone, hop aroma. The citrus element is as much flavorful fruit as it is rind bitterness...precisely balanced in that respect. Grapefruit juice anyone? The hops are indeed huge but somehow remain smooth and flavorful. The malt is minimally detectable but manages, not necessarily to balance the brew, but to contribute to the superior drinkability. Wow! This is a killer, juicy IPA. Exceptional. Can't wait for distibution in NY. Greg?"
"Big sponge-like head that retains fairly well. Beautiful citrus/pine smell that absolutely screams hops. The color doesn't fall short of this impressive level of beauty either. Pale orange that brings the word """nectar""" to mind. As suggested on the bottle, an army of hops invades your palate. The hops ride in on a a soft and smooth malt blanket, but the assault is not far behind. As is characteristic of these types of hops, very strong citrus/orange peel-like and floral taste. Very subtle maltiness. This is a huge beer. Obviously, if you're a fan of hops, you'll absolutely love this."
"Ruination is a tasteful, drinkable, innovative beer, and yet another reason why Stone is rapidly establishing itself as the West Coast's premier brewery."
"Notes: This is one hell of a hoppy brew, not overkill like other massive IPAs but more over aroma, flavour and bitterness as a whole. BTW this beer is devastating to the palate so dont drink anything that you may want to taste after this beer as the taste buds will become numb in a way. A daring brew that gives you more than enough hops."
"296"
"Worth the price of the beer just to read the bottle, which exclaims that it is """a liquid poem to the glory of the hops"""  and 100+ IBUs.  I half expected a mushroom cloud to form over the bottle when I popped the top.  Aroma was peppery hops.  I braced myself and took the first sip (gulp, actually).  To my surprise, the hops were quite smooth and very well balanced with the malt - and the hops, although powerful, are not at all overwhelming.  In comparison with Stone's IPA, the hops in Ruination are not as grapefruity, and tended to have more of a herbal character.  A must-try for any hophead, but overall I prefer the IPA, which seemed more heavy-handed with the hops."
"Pours a bright golden with a huge pillowy/rocky white head that leaves a great lace all the way down the glass.  Slight juicy fruit aromas with huge hop oil smells that singed my nose hairs.  Intense hop bitterness that lasts from start to finish.  As the brew begins to warm the malt character of the beer really shows up and balnces this brew very nicely.  There are more juicy fruit flavors as well but they are subdued by the dominant hops.  Very crisp and dry on the tongue as well as very refreshing and insanely drinkable for the amount of alcohol and bitterness in this brew.  This is an absolutely amzing beer but can I really expect anything else from Stone?"
"Clear light copper in hue, topped by a fluffy, well - retained off - white head that leaves sparse lace. Grapefruit and pine """4 C""" American hop nose & mild caramel malt sweetness in aroma. Although the bitterness is expectedly assertive, it is accompanied by a surprisingly rich, toasty, lightly buttery, malt backbone. The citrusy hop flavor comes as no surprise, but is very well integrated into the overall flavor profile. Smooth mouthfeel, with a full, dextrinous body. Finishes w/ a bittersweet balance of hop bitterness and residual malt sweetness. Ruination is an exceptional IPA that showcases American hops, but malt character is not at all lacking. Don't let the 100+ IBUs scare you."
"I have to admit I was afraid of this beer. The bitterness of beer always gave me problems, but I have managed to gradually build up a tolerance to hops and have even managed an appreciation for hoppy beers ala HopDevil. Still I was afraid of this beer because of all the talk of it being over 100 IBUs. Then I crack it open. Sure it's huge hops (black pepper, citrus peel and flowers) but not as much as I was expecting. I take a big swig and ... it goes down easily. It's kind of cool how the bitterness and most of the flavor is time delayed. The huge flavor doesn't hit until right about the time I swallow. You get a bit of malt at the beginning and some more in the end as the beer warms, but the hoppage overpowers it. I'm still burping the hops 4 hours later."
"It's a pretty amber with a healthy beige head that leaves traces all the way down the glass.  The smell of hops is almost overwhelming but still very pleasant.  I found it a bit too bitter to qualify as an exceptional beer.  Citrus is present in the taste and it does leave a bit of residual sweetness but not as much malt flavor as I would have liked.  It has a nice fairly chunky mouthfeel for an IPA, but the bitterness detracts a bit from the drinkability.  The 5th Anniversary IPA is quite a bit better IMO."
