"Textbook dipa with a great hop backbone and enough malt and carbonation took keep you going through the next pour"

"Hands down TOP FIVE DPA"
""
""
""
"O- overall, very nice. Refreshing!"
""
""
""
""
"NEBCO never fails to produce anything but excellence and this proves it. My overall favorite DIPA."
""
""
""
"no carbonation.... dull dark-urine color.... juicy tones of aroma.... and the flavor follows suit! nice flavor. nice abv. nice brew. admittedly, dull-looking brew off the pour; and i'm sure this must be better on draught..... great color of the can to augment its tangerine-ish qualities..... but this beer has probably seen better days before it was packaged in a box and sent cross-country to my house..... still a great brew though! awesome grapefruit rind at the finish, and VERY lingering, I will add. very nice brew."
""
""
"Very good beer but overhyped due to its name."
""
""
"This beer is why I am proud to be from Connecticut."
"Absolutely worth chasing this beer!"
""
""
""
"Aroma is mango/pineapple. Light to medium body mouthfeel. Aftertaste is of dry tart grapefruit. Finally got to taste this son of a bitch!"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy but medium bodied and almost chewy with light carbonation and a slightly bitter aftertaste that was more malty and cracker than sweet citrus hops. Overall an outstanding beer, too bad they have to change the can as the artwork is classic."
""
""
""
""
"Very much over hyped and because of that, expensive. It's a pretty solid IPA. Doesn't touch Heady Topper but comes close with that can feel. Nice mouth feel and buzz."
""
""
"hazy orange color with big juicy notes of heavy grapefruit and melon. Awesome taste and very crushable. One of my favorite double ipas to consume. Will be unfortunatly be re-named :("
""
""
""
""
"It does not get any better than this fokes! Perfectly balanced double IPA!"

"Great IPA, just a little too much to the malt side for my taste. Would definitely seek out again despite that East Coast lean."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" give it a 4.31"
""
"A solid DIPA but vastly over-rated and the price gouging that goes on whenever it is released makes me want to give it a 2. But since that is not the brewers fault... it is a good beer. But in the same league with heady,haze and sunshine? i think not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just one of my all-time favorite beers. When I lived in CT I could pick this up pretty regularly but in MA now, so it's been a while. I'll have to re-rate the next time I get lucky enough to find it."

"Another winner from @Roguer."
""
""
""
""
"Not nearly as smooth as I had hoped for. Hop bitterness takes away from the enjoyment of this brew. Not horrible but for the hype I had hoped for more. Sea Hag is more enjoyable IMO."
""
""
"This beer has been on my Want list for a while.  Always have heard such great things about this brew and was so happy to finally get my hands on it.  As I sit here drinking this, I'm definitely feeling a let down.  The look is great, and the nose is fantastic--tropical fruits everywhere.  But the taste?  Simply doesn't follow the nose as I'd hope.  Compared to SOS, HT, and other DIPAs in the 8% range this beer lacks the flavor complexity.  I almost feel like I'm drinking a Stone IPA.  Bitterness prevents me from tasting the tropical fruits I was hoping for.  I will try again, but definitely won't go out of my way to get this one.  Big let down."
""
"Great beer, expected more from the hype but still very good!!"
""
"Overall:  An excellent example of the style.  I was so afraid that I would be let down because of its elusiveness.  A great beer."
""
""
""
"Glad to try this recently controversial IPA. Canned 12/29. Pours a nice golden straw color and reeks of hops. This is a bitter ipa, and as the carbonation in the mouth subsides the hops take over even more lingering around. For 8.8% abv it is a smooth drinker but a bit too harsh all around. Id definitely drink again but wouldn't search to hard to get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A welcome addition to the NE ale line-up... my favorites have that cloudy apricot color, where this is lighter and a little clearer.... nice nose and hoppy flavors but falls a little short on the citrus end and a little more bitter than need be... overall, a solid drinking beer and though not as good as heady, dinner, or HF offerings, is very tasty!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe I got a underachiever 4 pack."
"One of the best IPA ' S  out there highly elusive."
""
"This is freaking delicious. I lucked out and walked in when they were unpacking it off the truck. Tough to come by, but worth every penny."
""
"Intensely floral, with one of the best noses to date. It literally beckons you to consume. I thought it was extremely balanced, and I appreciated the citrus notes as it warmed, especially on the finish. Carbonation was spot on. Head was massive and barely dissipated. I've enjoyed this numerous times, but never like this. Canned on 12/29. Just wow."
""
""
""
"it was very very solid IIPA... not as good as I hoped though"
""
""
"Well deserved hype. The smell alone is worth the pour. Tried my first HT on NYE... The Bot is where it's at."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very rare, very hoppy, very good"
""
""

""
""
"Vermont has Heady Topper, Connecticut has Gandhi Bot.  Not quite comparable because HT gets the solid 5.0 in my book but good enough to not have to travel 3 hours north to get it.  A very full flavored dbl. IPA and slowly starting to make it's way around a good part of CT."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally got to taste it on tap.  Beautiful aroma, nice malty balance for the hops.  Great mouth feel and flavor.  The bitterness hangs on the back of your tongue a bit longer than I would prefer but it kept me coming back for more.  Excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Best IPA I've ever had. Love the floral and citrus notes on the finish. That's what sets this beer apart from so many others."

"Thank you to Chris N. for sending this to me! Poured into Tulip glass, a hazy orange copper color. Smells of grapefruit, tropical notes, and nice caramel malt in the background.  Taste is wonderful.  Nice juicy tropical, citrus hop notes.  A balanced malt background is there, but the hops still shine through.  Medium mouthfeel, nice and creamy.  Overall a great Double IPA, and I'm really glad I got to try it."

"The best..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium body medium high carbonation this beer is totally capable of giving a hop bitterness that dries out the mouth and leaves you wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is definitely the best DIPA that I have had, in my opinion. It has a great fruity aroma that is experienced further in its taste. Excellently crafted and is definitely what I would envision to be a perfect DIPA."
""
"Overall- if i had access to this beer year round i would buy it whenever i possibly could. this is everything you could ask for in an Imperial IPA."
"O-  Probably my second favorite DIPA after Heady and Ive had most of the others.  Underrated on BA in my opinion.  Id put it at least in my top 20-30 range.  Pretty hard to obtain, but it was well worth the driving and seeking I had to endeavor to obtain a couple 4 packs.  Highly suggested, as is NEBC Sea Hag IPA."

"Second review from a fresh growler pour"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great easy to drink dipa, the aroma is out of the world citrus and fruit.  Smooth bitterness with loads of fruit. My only complaint is that it finishes a little thin, the flavor kinda of just stops and doesn't follow through to the finish.  def not a heady topper but I don't think it's trying to be. Way different profile.  But still good. I like it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed this despite having it well past it's peak freshness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy peach and apricot color, pillowy white head, and big sticky lace.  Big aromas of grapefruit, peach and mango.  Taste follows through.  Grapefruit dominant, slight malty sweetness up front merges with peach and mango flavors through the middle and a grapefruit bitter finish.  Nice medium mouthfeel, carbonation breaks toward smooth at the finish where it gets crisp and semi dry.  Honestly, one of the best beers I've ever had.  Big hop flavors, great look and feel and a to die for aroma."

"Very smooth for a double IPA"
""
"A top 5 DIPA. Better than Heady imo. Right on a a level with Maine Beer Co Dinner. Fantastic beer."

"Got a fresh growler from the brewery And enjoyed it two days later back in PA. This beer has a unique style and taste and it's basically perfect. Beautiful hazy yellow pour, and a taste than more than matches the nose. I guess there are not enough reviews to make this a top 250 beer but imo it's an absolute top tier dipa. Beer should be rated 100. Also very cool vibe at the brewery."

"Today 3 of us did a comparison tasting of 5 IPA/IIPA's brews: The brews were New Glarus Scream, Revolution Anti Hero, New England Gandhi-Bot, and Fiddlehead Second Fiddle and Mastermind. Second Fiddle came out on top with a rating of 5.0. Two of us feel it  is the best IPA out there. Scream came in a solid second at 4.5. It was a surprise to all three of us because we had not had it before. Great nose, nice color, great taste. Very Solid. Anti-Hero was well liked by all three of us and came in at 4.25. Gandhi-Bot also came in at 4.25, however it did not have the WOW factor. But Fiddleheads second offering Mastermind did not quite live up to our hopes; a little weak."

"On tap at Blue Tusk. Hazy golden pour. Citrus and floral hop aromas, sweet on the nose. Big hop flavors up front rounded by a semi-sweet malt profile that comes off as soft yet clean and easy drinking. A hint of honey. The hop profile is dominated by grass, orange peel and floral notes and finishes with a big bitter grapefruit pith finish. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall it's an outstanding IPA although it's a little sweet and a little too bitter on the finish for my taste."

"I'm not going through all the categories to describe this beer other than to say it is near perfect. 8.8% abv, which is frighteningly hidden. Incredibly well balanced. Spectacular mouth feel. Actually goes down too easily. I drive over an hour to get this, and worth every penny. ENJOY!!"

"A hazy dark gold in color with a thick and frothy head that laces like crazy during the session. The smell is powerfully hoppy with both Christmas tree pine and tropical citrus fruit coming out with the most aggression. Looking for more in the smell I do find a bit of caramel malt relatively mild and completely overshadowed by the hops. So the taste has a bit of the malt too but again that is completely overridden by the hops which are totally the focus here. Big and brash full of flavor and quite bitter. Most of the flavors are citrusy and piney a great mix of the two that manage to compliment each other nicely. The body of this beer is probably in the middle of the range but carbonation is high which makes it quite lively in the mouth. This is also quite a strong beer but the alcohol remains well hidden through nearly the entire session but a nice warming characteristic does develop as the beer warms. Overall this is a first class beer a really great example of the style and one that I've got to get some more of."
""
"Rarely do I think a beer lives up to the hype but the Bot is nearly perfect. It lacks a bit in the aroma department but only when compared to super melony beers like Lunch and Heady. The taste is all citrus and a hint of bitter with lots of bubbles and crispness. Overall, I wish I could get this daily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fairly well-balanced for such a sharply hopped beer. Could be juicier, and wanted some more pulp in the appearance; otherwise, carries enough malt sweetness to cushion an cringing prickly hop bight. Brightly crafted beer."

"My friends agreed that if there was any beer that would be the equivalent of a mango lassi, this would be it. Perhaps that's what the brewers were going for given the theme? While I doubt this was brewed with lactic sugar, it definitely feels that way, and regardless, the hop profile melded with the base malts goes so well that it's impossible to deny that this is a serious force in the hoppy beer realm in the US. Deliciously stunning stuff, and highly recommended - as fresh as possible!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A real knockout! I'd say the beer this most closely resembles is Zombie Dust, and it's honestly very difficult for me to say which I prefer over the other. Any hop-head would owe it to themselves to track this down, as it certainly sits among the upper echelon of DIPAs."

"taste, fits the aroma, magnificent. mouthfeel is medium bodied and lingering, does not dry out until very late. super resiny. overall a freaking awesome beer. not to mention great artwork on the can. kudos to the makers of this fine liquid. this is one of the highest ratings I have given a beer in this category. comparable with Heady Topper and Hop Drop. a must have."
""
""
""

"This is one of the beers that turned me on to ipa's in the first place."
""
""
""
"O - A great beer, certainly a top echelon DIPA. I'd put this up there with some of the bigger names in east-coast IPA's from Vermont, etc."
""
""
""
""
""
"Double IPA's are everywhere now and this has remained one of my favorites for years now for a reason. The appearance was a nice yellow, but the smell took me back when I gave it a sniff. Lots of grapefruit, mint, and orange peel came through. The taste was a great amount of bitterness paired with a semi-sweet finish that made for a nice refreshing taste but kept a nice aftertaste. Intense but not abrasive. Would definitely recommend for hop heads and IPA lovers."

"O- Overall, this is a really well done DIPA. I've begun to shy away from the DIPAs that feel the need to push 10%. This beer does well at 8.8% and seems to be an anomaly. A firmly East Coast IPA with some West Coast flavor. Like Biggie let Tupac spit a few lines on a track. Great beer."
"O: A truly delicious brew that toes the line between East Coast and West Coast DIPAs, and remains incredibly drinkable and interesting from start to finish. If you can find it, it's absolutely worth the purchase. And if you can find a way to trade for it, I'd highly recommend it."

"Best DIPA ive ever had...plain and simple. Aroma is extremely tropical with beautiful pineyness. Pours a sticky white lacey head with dark tangerine color. Basically flawless beer in my opinion I just wish they would produce more of this beer in CT!!! Today I filled up two growlers and every time I am simply amazed"

""
""

"Overall: Solid DIPA that leans more toward the grapefruit side of the IPA spectrum. Would drink again."

"A totally hazy banana orange colored body with a huge head and fat lacing smothering the sides. Aroma is a bouquet of citrus fruit and flavor has lots of lush fruit including peaches and an overall biscuity feel. Very good!"
""
""
"Picked up a growler from the brewery on my way up north. Pours a nice hazy orange/yellow, very nice citrus & pine notes. Bits and pieces reminded me of Heady Topper, fantastic DIPA, wish it was more readily available in Southern CT and NYC metro area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Impressive DIPA, lots of fruit flavor under powerful hop bite."
"Overall - doesn't the top line say it all. excellent"
""
"This guy was introduced to me a few months back. To say I'm hooked is an understatement. I've had many """proclaimed""" great dbl's and The Bot still stands alone. Murky appearance? Forget about it! This is a great beer and I feel spoiled living in CT w/ this great little gem of a brewery being so close. This is my go to """premium""" beer and always will be. Cheers!"
"O: Very, very good DIPA that has lived up to the hype. Hope to find another 4 pack of this soon, because I doubt these last two beers are going to last the day."

"It's a great double IPA. Hits its marks on aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. Very drinkable, and the 8.8% is hidden well up front. If I was a douche bag (I'd like to think I'm not), I'd dock it for being opaque. It'd be nice for the head to stay around a bit and to have a bit more carbonation to continue surfacing the nice array of hop aromas throughout the glass."

"O: impossible to find in cans nowadays, but few places have it on tap. One of my favorites. 5/5"
""
"He is rightly excited that certain brewers in New England have properly executed the west coast IPA/DIPA styles. Certainly I knew of The Alchemist and Hill Farmstead, and of course Maine Beer Co and Smuttynose -- but aside from the Heady Topper this is the first one that grabbed me as comparable to Alpine, Port, Alesmith, Kern River, or Russian River. I'll be stopping in another state besides VT next time I'm back east."
"Overall a superior DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks CTJman for this one. Resinous, sticky pine and papaya on the nose. Juicy hop load as you would expect of a better DIPA: Sourdough, pineapple notes sink into an oozy malt. A clean bite of hops power washes your tongue for the finish and prepares you for the next sip. This is a very good DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice, easy drinking lawnmower-type beer. It drinks more like a pale ale than a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An absolutely well crafted and complete hop bomb."
"Poured into a tulip glass, leaves a nice two finger head that stuck around for a while,bright orange, nice lacing. Not a bad looking dipa. Smell is not over powering. Getting some pine and maybe lemon, with some slight caramel. Light carbonation and very creamy on the first sip. Definitely pine and grass up front, a little bit of citrus to follow. Aftertaste of pine and lemon, very nice. Nicely balanced with a nice little hop bite at the end that sticks around on the tongue for a while. For whatever reason I was expecting a hop bomb, probably random comparisons to heady topper I've seen on here, not the case, but still worth seeking out."
""
"If you can get passed the creepy can, you'll find a great DIPA. A 4 or 6 pack (not sure because I got it in a trade) of this would not last long in my possession."
""
""
"O - I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I was given this can as a gift and the date was about 3 months old. Regardless, the flavors were excellent and was very easy to drink. Wish I had more!"

"Can share at Proof courtesy of Matt Masterson. Pours a pale slightly hazy yellow. Good bubbly white head that lasted almost a minute. Thin collar. Nice spicy, piney hop aroma with a fair amount of malt sweetness noticeable. Taste is the same. Great. Again, not a piney hop fan, but when it's done well, it really works. High carbonation and medium body."

"Overall I am definitely enjoying this beer! Im always a little iffy when it comes to IPA's from the east coast, but this may be one of the better ones I've tried for sure. Its talking me about 25 minutes to finish off a 12oz can. Again, not a bad thing. Worth a glass for sure. Cheers!"

"Bought many cans of this from Harvest Wine & Spirits in Hartford, CT. Poured into a Waterford snifter. It's a beautiful orangy DIPA with a thick white head and lots of hops/exotic fruit coming off the nose. The part that just doesn't hold up for me in this brew is as it warms... the hops get really abrasive. Other DIPAs I've had are definitely better on the back end. In fact, I've drain-poured because of the aftertaste -- it can be amazingly harsh/bad sometimes. Otherwise, it's still an amazing brew for the first three quarters. I would definitely be willing to trade if anyone is searching for it."

"damn near perfect in my book! great taste, mouthfeel, etc..never had lawsons... I could drink this every day of my life if nebco distributed to NJ!! Good Carbonation, head, lacing, very heavy citrus on the after taste, if I could have a growler 2x a week I would need a CT mule... Do not hesitate to try this. will stand up to any 2ipa in the country..no shit!"

"The beer pours a pale orange color with notes of amber. The beer forms a big, beautiful head of creamy white bubbles that last at about a finger’s width above the glass. In body, the beer is clean of particles, but very hazy and nearly opaque. On the nose, this beer is big and beautiful. Pine needles, pinecones and sweet mango juice mingle with dank and spicy weed, grapefruit rind, and soft alcohol notes. From the can, the nose is just about the same with just a touch more roundness coming from the citric scents and less of the alcohol burning the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely and properly bitter with resinous pine sap sticking to the tongue. Sweet hops, alcohol, and light bread malt mingle with citric acidity to make up the side show. The finish is dry with only slight sticky sweetness lingering. On the tongue, the beer is medium bodied, with fluffy carbonation that gives velvet softness to the mouthfeel. The mouth is left sticky with resin and bitter tingling, the palate is wrecked. From the can, the beer feels slightly crisper. In flavor, the beer tastes of resinous pine, sweet mango, light pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot. Distinct fresh hop flavors bubble on the tongue and feel sticky and very resinous. The taste has a strong backbone of medicinal bitters. Mmm. A bit sickly sweet, but not too much so. The cloying alcohol seems most present in the finish which also features dry cracker malts at the very base of my senses and strong piney hops. Overall, this is a damn good double IPA. It would be excellent on a late summer afternoon. Great bitters, great hop character, and a great effect on the tongue. The alcohol is just a tad too much, but other than that I like this beer a lot."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Unique in the herbal notes which are very pronounced and enjoyable. Expertly balanced with a high amount of malts while still allowing the hops to shine through. Well deserving of its ranking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A quality, well-balanced but still hop-foward IPA. Fairly drinkable, but not as drinkable as some of my favorite IPA's of similar, that said this is still an top-quality IPA. Very tasty."
""
"On the whole, a damn fine beer. Slightly peculiar aftertaste aside, this is an excellent example of the DIPA style. Smooth, easy drinking--especially for its strength--and exceptionally well-balanced for most of the mouthful, as well as possessing a stellar nose. Delighted to have gotten the chance to try this New England gem."

""
""

"Overall, this is a very good DIPA that I have had numerous times and would never pass up. It's a very solid DIPA, just does not WOW me like Double Sunshine or Heady. However, add it to the list of solid east coast DIPAs which is ever increasing."

"O: Incredibly balanced. This one deserves more notoriety. Dripping with juicy citrus. Loads of hops. So glad I got to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter side of medium body with a very active carbonation, really dries out the tongue after several sips. A decent DIPA, though I expected better aroma from a canned IPA. Still enjoyable to drink though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid and aggressive DIPA that doesn't hold anything back. The flavor profile reminds me of some single IPAs, with the fullness, mouthfeel, IBUs, and ABV of a DIPA. This makes for a pretty reasonable every-day DIPA, if there is such a thing, and while I don't think it's quite in the PtE/HT class, I certainly think it belongs in the class right below them."
""
""
""
"Great drinker! Highly recommended for the style!"
""
""
"O: 4.5 Ghandi Bot nails what the IIPA style is all about. Strong citrus aroma, very well balanced, leaving me disappointed I can't have easy access to it. Nice job NEBCo!!"

""
"Overall: Damn fine DIPA NEBCO has here. This one can compete with the likes of HT, Pliny, and others any day. Complete pleasure to have a chance at this beer. Drinks very easy considering the ABV."

""

"Overall this is a phenomenal IPA. Hops have great flavor without being overpowering. Very well balanced considering its extreme style. This is certainly a must try for any hophead."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a nice beer. Well worth the try and I would definitely drink again."
""
""
"Impressed. New England brewered this up right; you put IIPA on the label, hit me with a lanyard of hops, keep the malt in the silo. We need more IIPAs like this in Minnesota. Excellent beer."
""
"Pours a dark golden in color with nice two finger white head. OK retention with nice lacing. Strong pine aroma with lots of grapefruit and some tropical fruit. Lots of pine and citrus on the tongue with some dank. Finishes dry and bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Extremely smooth. Overall, an easy drinking, complex DIPA! I'll be seeking this one out again soon."
""
""
""
"Very nice DIPA, though it's nothing to lose your shorts over. I can see why people love it, but it doesn't do much to stand out above the rest. That's not to say that it still isn't pretty delicious, though, because it certainly is. Goin' hard on that piney and citric hop swerve, this will make most hop heads happy, or at the very least, pleasantly content."

"This beer always makes me very happy. I would give it a perfect rating, but I have had the Peekskill Double Standard on several occasions, and I have yet to try those fabled IPAs from northern Vermont. It is just as good out of the can as it is on tap. Hopefully their new canning machine will not change that."
""
""
"Very, very tasty. This was much better than I was expecting."
""
""

"O: We have a hophead winner here, this one makes my short list of awesome beers I've met this year. An aggressively bitter beer that showcases citrus hops but remains balanced and doesn't get harsh."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The body was a bit fuller than typical for the style, but wasn't heavy at all. Drinkability was very good, especially if you're a fan of bitter IPAs. Overall, a pretty good brew, one that would be in my regular rotation if it were local to me. A must try if you see it."

"This is truly the best beer I've ever had...Had it uber fresh....14 hours (or so I was told). The first thing that hit me was the grapefruit aroma explosion. The most incredible aromatic beer ever. Mouth feel was slick & smooth buit not overly syrupy. My only complaint is that my wife liked it too....Now I need to double down. If you ever have a chance to score some of this, do it without hesitation."

"Overall – I can see how some compare this to Heady/Pliny. It has a great dose of hops and a nice fruity/malty balance to compliment them. I can't find a date on the can, so I have no idea how fresh this is.. but even still, this is a world class beer worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall (4.25): This is a great DIPA, it really is. It holds its own to most DIPAs out there, and now that it’s not so hard to find and more accessibly priced (every month or two we get a new shipment over here in upstate NY, typically priced at $12 per 4-pack—really not bad for a big, heavily dry-hopped DIPA from a small brewery), it’s a good pick. Would I take Heady over this? Yeah, definitely. But I can’t get Heady at my local shops. But would I take Gandhi-Bot over at least 90% of other DIPAs available to me in my market? Yes, yes I would. And, my girlfriend loves this beer—that’s called a win-win, motherfucker. Damn good beer, and it’s very, very nice to be able to get this now with some regularity and without trading."

"O – A hoppy, flowery, bitter, masterpiece of a beer. Nice change of pace from the sticky/sweet norm for the style. The floral and earthy notes in this one are what set it apart. Nice, unique peach notes to it as well. Balance is nice, and I am thankful to have tried this one."

"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a big, big head and huge hop aroma! The taste follows suit, very juicy, with a fairly diverse hop profile. Maybe just a tad out of balance towards the hops, but I'm very forgiving in that regard! Mouthfeel was very good, it has some body and is well carbonated. Overall, this is a very, very good DIPA that belongs high on any hop head's list. It actually tastes and smells similar to Heady Topper. I will snatch this one up any time I see it in the store!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Delicious and I put this in the same camp as PTE/Heady.. could drink it all afternoon"
"O- Extremely impressive IIPA. NEBCO is putting out some great beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hoppy bitterness with a good malt sweetness is the MO of this beer. Very bitter beer, I wouldn't be surprised if this one clocked in at 100 IBUs. It's complemented by a nice sweet malt presence that doesn't back down. So it's both balanced and unbalanced in that sense. I'm impressed with how strong the components of this beer are. I'm not a huge, huge fan of the über bitter DIPAs but as far as they go, this is a very good one; it may well be the east coast version of Abrasive. (4.25)"
""
""
""
""
"Can: Poured a cloudy amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of strong grassy hops notes with light residual sugar notes. Taste is dominated by powerful floral grassy hops with light citrus notes and semi-sweet malt non-descript malt base. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very enjoyable IIPA which is focus more on floral hops notes with limited bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange color with a frothy white head that slowly settles into a thick lasting ring. Sweet citrus hop aroma with plenty of earthy notes and a subtle malt presence. There’s some grassy pine needle and dank hop oils but the tropical/citrus fruits are most prominent in the nose. Lots of mango, grapefruit and citrus rind along with subtle biscuit in the flavors. Medium bodied with a complex, flavorful hop profile that is nicely balanced by a sweet malt backbone. Bitter and sweet notes play off of each other with hints of dry and bitter pine countered by notes of grapefruit and orange. The malt backbone adds sweetness with notes of caramel, toffee and biscuit without getting in the way of the hops. Overall, a well-balanced brew and very flavorful with a well-masked ABV making it dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A damn fine IPA from NEBCO, bitter, piney, citrusy, flavorful and most importantly, balanced. While I'm sure that this beer gets overshadowed by Heady and the Hill Farmstead IPA craze, this can easily hold it's own and is deserving of all praises and accolades."
""
""
"Expected more from this beer. More of an east coast dipa. Hop profile not my favorite but it packs a punch."
""
""
""
"Overall - Wow. This is one for the books here, what a great brew! Highly recommend! Cheers! You can compare this brew somewhat to Heady Topper, but it has its own flair with the different malts and less of a floral hit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Peach-amber color, hazy, with a finger or so of foamy white head; moderate retention and lacing. Nice hoppy aroma, citrus, pine, tropical fruit, light floral notes, some malty sweetness detectable. Again in the taste, lots of hops, orange, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, sweet malt base with a touch of honey and/or orange blossom in there. Definitely had a bitter bite to it, but the sweetness took a bit of the edge off, and it was pretty smooth for an 8.8% beer. Medium body, easily drinkable for the style, and overall quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Highly recommended and worthy of the solid ratings it has earned. I still think Heady Topper is superior overall because of the massive tropical overload, but Ghandi-Bot has nothing to apologize for: go buy some if you can find it, this one sells quickly."
""
""
"What more can I say? Top 5 IPA made on the East Coast. Find at all costs."
""
""
"O: Very clean. All the ingredients shine through. Wonderful flavor and a pleasure to drink."
""
"O: I must admit, I was not terribly impressed when I first had Gandhi from a can, especially since I paid $15 for a 4-pack. However, seeing that I've since come to appreciate a good IPA and DIPA, I decided to give it a try on tap. And, I must say, I was painfully mistaken. Gandhi joins the likes of Heady Topper and many of Hill's IPAs as some of the best-done IPAs in my book. I was astonished to learn that NEBCO has been in my former back yard for years and even more astonished that good old Connecticut could produce a DIPA to rival those of the Green Mountain State. I will undoubtedly be returning to Gandhi over and over again whilst in the 203."
"O: Really nice. Easy drinking, nice balance of flavors. Coming in a can is a plus for sure as well."

"This go-round, i got quite a bit more pine in the nose, which is much more floral overall and hop-forward. It still has a big malt backbone and fresher seems to carry more of a honey-sweetness. Long finish and overall the freshness make a noticeable difference. Thanks again brother!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nicely balanced IPA with a nice bitter aftertaste that stays a long time !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
"O: A lot can be said about this beer and the level of hops put forward. For the bitter-seeker, this is definitely a must-try. However, most will prefer a beer with more balance. I don't think the body is big enough to support the huge hop burden. That said, it's still a very good DIPA and one to try if you ever have the opportunity."
""
""
"Had this beer twice over the weekend. Shared pours in tulips, then had one straight from the can. The scent is heavy grapefruit. So much hop action on the nose. Bright and pungent. The taste went from 3.75 to 4.5 for me from poured to can. I pour all my beers, but this was so much better from the can. The taste is more balanced from the can. Everything you could want from a IIPA."
"O - A tour de force of clean, fresh hop flavors. One of the best IPA's I've ever had."

"one of the most drinkable double ipas ive ever encountered. thanks to a wonderful trade with thebrewo, I got to enjoy two cans of this bad boy. the pour on it is tinted red, orange, and bronze, with some small yeast floaters and an amazing bone white head that rises three inches high and holds up well above the rim of my glass. the nose is fresh oily hops, high alpha, fruity and juicy, citrus and pine both, only mildly bitter. there is a decent coppery malt balance, but hops are of course the star of this beer. the taste is a lot like the nose, with a very fruity and complex hop arrangement. I would love to know which varietals are used, but I can say that there is a hefty tropical fruit element, its pineapple or tartish passion fruit. a little bitterness creeps into the finish, but not enough to slow down its drinkability at all. love the feel too, fuller bodied but kept swift by its lively carbonation. super creamy, and less sticky and filling than many other beers of this style. I had two cans back to back, and was only done because I didn't have any more. im not sure if this comes in 4s or 6s or what, but I could drink these forever. its amazingly fresh and refreshing at the same time, unlike a lot of big india pale ales. thanks to thebrewo for hooking this up, its one ive been hunting for some time now, and it surpasses even its hype. bomb!"
"O-This beer is all about the hops. The incredibly aromatic hops deliver the right amount of bitterness that is balanced in part by the malt and in part by the alcohol. Overall, this very smooth beer is definitely worth a try and would likely put up a decent fight against even your favorite double/imperial IPAs. I would definitely try this again."
""
""
""
""

"O: This is really enjoyable with nice hop flavors, though slightly aggressive, and well balanced with the malts - there is enough sweetness that is it not overly or unpleasantly bitter. Pretty easy to drink and definitely one I would like to find again. Alcohol is well hidden."
"poured an orange hue (a bit hazy) with 2 fingers of white foamy head and excellent lacing left behind. HUGE floral hop bouquet in the nose, very sweet, floral, citrusy, pineapple, grapefruit. an excellent balnce of hop profiles.. west coast piney meets the citrusy grapefruit, with a pile on of northeast floral ipa style.. backed by a heavy sweet malt profile. this is up there with pliny, flower power, and heady. a resinous bitterness lingers for quite some time. the medium body pour is easy to drink due to the hops overpowering the booze flavor. low carbonation and a sticky feeling left behind, this is one of the better dipas i've had. nice and bitter."
""
""
""
"Overall, the best things about this beer are the nicely balanced aroma, and how easily it drinks. The hops on the nose are just so sticky, fruity, and sweet, yet so bittered, herbal, and earthy. These mix with the perfect level of bittered pales, caramel, and bubblegum. This beer is actually a nice change for the style, as many tend to overwhelm the beer with doubling a certain ingredient, thus tipping the balance out of favor. Here, the balance remains through both the aroma and the flavoring, leaving us with a tasty, easily drinkable treat from the beer-quiet state of Connecticut."
""
""

"O- good dipa but wasn't blown away by any means. Pretty dry with some sweetness to balance the citrus rind bitterness."

"Cheers!!!"

"Note: On 7/24/13 I had a can that was, according to Westmere Beverage, canned yesterday (as they put it, the only way to have one fresher is if it were canned in the future). It's more bitter than I remember, with a big dose of apricot. Lingering bitterness overwhelms any malt features, reminds me at times of Heady Topper somewhat."
"O: 4.5 - definitely have a soft spot in my heart for NEBCo from my years in New Haven, and this is one of their best offerings up their with Imperial Stout Trooper and Wet Willy; I'd also consider it a top 5 east coast IPA that stands up to Heady Topper, Captain Lawrence Captain's Reserve and DFH 90 minute. It's hoppy but not a hop bomb...instead, it's refreshing, smooth and balanced. If you like east coast IPAs, this is definitely one to fresh trade for."

"Thanks to GuisseppeFranco for sending this over as a bonus! This poured out as a murky golden color with some flakes floating around in it. The head was white and held a good retention and lacing. The smell of the beer gave off a very nice floral and citrus aroma from the hops. The taste of the beer was really quite nice as well. Again more floral fruity notes with some bitter pine in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is nicely carbonated, it's smooth and very drinkable. Overall it was a damn good DIPA. I would drink again if I came across more."
""
"12oz can: Finally got a hold of one of these. This one pours a orange-tinged hazy darker golden color. There was a very small white head on it that doesn’t linger or leave much lacing. Tons of hops in the nose of this one. Lots of resinous pine, and some citrus. Not much else making it past. Taste is very good. Bitter, but some residual sweetness bubbling up. Pine, biscuit, citrus, some caramel malts. Just a touch over medium bodied. Very Nice!"
"O: One of the best DIPAs on the East Coast and one that is, IMO, under appreciated. Definitely worth seeking out, especially since it can be hard to find at times."

The nose is really nice, caramel toast, pine sap and grapefruit rind combine for a really nice aroma. Big and hoppy with plenty of piney hop flavor and citric bitterness with a smooth, toasty maltiness. Full bodied and super smooth with the perfect carbonation for my palate. Finishes with a resinous hop aftertaste. A really good beer that I knew nothing about, the surprise gems are better to me than the hard to get sometimes."

"Overall, I had mixed feelings. I like it, and recognize that it is a very well done example of the style, but personally, I like my DIPAs balanced out with a little bit more malt sweetness. Don't get me wrong though, this is still a phenomenal DIPA."
""

"Overall - quite tasty. Not quite up to Heady Topper or Kiwi Rising IMHO, but definetely close. Love the smaller cans (take note, Alchemist)."

"I poured into a pint glass from the can, it has a burnt orange color body with a 2""" white head that hangs out for a while then leave a nice foamy lace around the edge of the glass. The aroma of the earthy and citrus hops, is very inviting. The taste has that awesome hop flavor up front, the citrus and earth tones from the hops, then the bitter taste on the back of the tonuge that lingers for a little bit. the mouth feel is great, rolls off the tongue nice and leave a nice bitter after taste, over all this one stands up to my expections of a DIPA"
""
"O: very delicious DIPA I have to admit. I am a huge fan of West Coast hop bombs but this one is putting in work."
""
"Poured from a growler purchased same day at NEBCO. Thanks Rob. Nice orange coloring, 1 finger white head, nice lacing on glass. Aroma of oranges and pineapple with piney notes and some slight hints of grapefruit. Hop aroma definitely noticeable. Taste is terrific--hop forward, slightly bitter, but easy to drink. Initial taste of orange and pineapple with slight notes of grapefruit along with caramel malt. Finish is a slightly bitter and enjoyable. Medium body with very good carbonation. Very enjoyable and dangerously easy to drink. Highly recommended."

"Cloudy yellow with lots of bubbles and a dense, creamy white head. Aroma is strong piney, citrusy and resiny. The beer is bracingly bitter, but there's not a lot of flavor contribution from the hops. A real tongue scraper. Good carbonation and medium body. Pretty nice, but I'd like to see a bigger hop flavor contribution."
"Overall, a really nice DIPA. Definitely a step below the best of the best but definitely when fresh is on the next tier. Really bitter and hoppy. If I could get this fresh in my area, it would be something I get a lot."
""
"The beer aerates while gushing from its 12oz can into my DFH goblet. It has a slightly hazy, pale golden body with 2 inches of white head that fades quickly. As the head settles, there is a respectable amount of inner-glass lacing and head retention. The beer's nose is quite citrusy and sweet, but the alcohol is modest and well disguised. The taste is quite excellent with a wide spectrum of hop flavors including a bold citrus, grape, pine, and tropical fruits. The mouthfeel is a little bit too hop forward and bitter (could have used more sweetness for balance), but isn't over-extending its welcome. Overall this beer is a sipper, with a huge hop profile and alcohol content to keep you easily satisfied. I'd love to try this beer again in the future, but many more DIPAs are better."
"Piny, herbal bitterness up front. Some toasted malt in there as well. Bitterness increases, but big hop fruity hop and malt flavors help offset it. Plenty of mango, pineapple, and sugary caramel mid-palate. The hops become more citrus-y and grapefruity toward the dry finish. Lingering orange, caramel, and resinous bitterness. Medium-full body with a nice, creamy feel. One of the better East coast DIPAs I have had the pleasure of trying. Oh, and the robotic Ghandi on the can is pretty cool too :)."
"O: I really like this DIPA. Solid nose, great taste, decent mouthfeel. It's really well rounded. If this were available in my area, I'd pick up a few cans now and again."
""
""
"O: I was torn between ranking this and not -- so it's important to know this beer is probably close to 90 days old. It is in the 12 oz can, so it's not too old. The first couple I had fresher were a bit tastier, but not by much to be honest. I'll make a note to review this again when I get my hands on something fresh. Until then - this is my review."

"Overall: This is a great hoppy east coast beer. Its among some of the greats!"
"Just wanna gulp it down. Omnom. Would love this as an extra anytime! Hah."
""
"O - A very solid DIPA. Worth trying if you can get it."
"O: This is a reasonably flavorful beer, but I expected something significantly hoppier. I don't understand the hype around this beer. Based on a concurrent thread, age doesn't seem to be the problem."

"Gandhi-Bot is a really solid West Coast-style double IPA. I love seeing brewers in my home state of Connecticut receiving accolades with beers like this one. Keep up the great work."
"Overall: wonderful pine. love the nice citrus without overwhelming grapefruit. Great sweetness, just fantastic. only drawback is that's a little tame in intensity for a iipa."
"O - Without any dating, I'm unsure of how old this can is. It seems as tho this was a super hoppy DIPA fresh, but it seems as tho some of the hop profile has gone by the wayside. I'm sure this had great potential."

"overall, while it didn't exactly impress at the outset this one came through in the clutch with a fantastic flavor profile. great DIPA, tasty and well-balanced. does enough to differentiate itself from the many out there. not to be missed for any hophead."

"o- awesome beer. i love it. heady's still better though (duh)."
"the hype. This can stand up with the dipa big boys any day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- In my opinion this was definitely a world-class DIPA that everyone should try. There are definitely better ones out there, but this should be a must try on any hop-head's wish list. I've had a lot of DIPAs, and I'd say this probably ranks right behind Heady Topper and HF's Abner (which were both two of the best beers I've had period). If you can get some fresh definitely pick some up. Like any great DIPA, this should only be drank fresh. The only thing I can highly suggest about improving this beer- Put a freshness date on the can!"

"O: Not too bad. Pretty drinkable. I wish the hops were more vibrant."
"Cost: $9.99 for a four pack."

"Poured can into a 13 oz tulip glass, not sure how to read freshness code. Pours a murky orange yellow with some floaties. Has a one inch sticky white that leaves some nice lacing. Smell is tangerine, mango, grapefruit, pine, grass, and hints of garlic. Taste is citrus up front, with a nice big grapefruit finish that lingers on the tongue awhile. Body is medium, a little dry which isn't a problem, plenty of life, and very drinkable. This is a awesome hop experience and definitely one of the best I have had."
""
"Overall, the qualities of this beer resembled a regular IPA more than a DIPA, IMO. It's possible that the travel that brought this beer to me caused some of its characteristics to seem more muted, and I'd love to try one fresh and local to see how it compares. It was still a good beer, but whether it's fair or not I guess I was hoping for something more along the lines of Heady Topper."
""
"O: the only disappointment here was the mouthfeel - could have used more spritz to brighten it and lighten it up. Still a great DIPA, and I love that it comes in cans."

"Have to admit that I really like the taste. This one is right at my hop limit."

"Happy to find this at Pies & Pints in Middlebury, CT, this favorite DIPA shows a bright amber color with a very modest white head and decent lacing. The aroma speaks of lemon-grapefruit and a pleasant caramel base. Very nice. The flavor brings lots more citrus bite and cramel sweetness. This approaches being cloying with a medium-heavy body and somewhat viscous feel. The hops are the theme here but it does carry some hints of cereal grain with the caramel sweetness. But let’s just call a spade a spade, it’s just a hop lovers retreat. Love it, tap or can, one of my favorites for a hop fix."

"Overall this is a good, really good, beer, but it isn't as fantastic as all of the hype I've heard from it thus far. The distribution is pretty limmited to my area and I can only purchas single cans when distributed. I'd get it again, but should probably just trade it to others who want it and can't get it. Worth trying for sure though."
""
""
""
"Overall I like it and it's quite easy to drink. Thankfully I like East and West Coast ipas. I like the cotton candy character that this has. "
"This is a truly extraordinary IPA. Its my current favorite, hands down. Its an extremely well-balanced, heavily hopped, smooth, aromatic, double IPA. If you're only having one, save it for last. Once you have one, the next beer is bound to be a disappointment, unless its an even heavier beer, like a DFH 90."
""
"Pours a deep yellow to orange color with a huge pillowy white head on top. Foams over the sides of the glass. Aromas are huge with hops, floral, and citrus fruits. Very nice smelling. Taste is spot on with loads of hops and fruits. Very delicious. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and decent carbonation from the can. Overall I thought this was great. Think it would be amazing on tap but still nice from the can."
""
"O: This was fantastic, big thanks to Brokenstones for this extra. It reminded me a lot of Heady Topper which I still crave since I got back home to Michigan. Wish I could get my hands on more of these!"
"O: Great showcase of hops, best East Coast DIPA I've had to date. Rivals Pliny in my book. Prob top 5 all timer for me. A must try for hop heads. The aroma and flavor are awesome. only thing that hurts me is the appearance. That could be my fault, but I'm skeptical of can. Must try for hop-heads, worth the hype."

"A really tasty DIPA and would I would happily drink again!"

""
"Overall: I’m righting this review about a week after tasting Pliny for the first time. This Double IPA definitely holds it’s own. I have heard very good things about it and I can agree. It has a strong bitterness on the finish but that’s usually to be expected with a Double IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid DIPA, but disappointing after the hype. Furthermore, the taste, while decent, doesn't live up to the smell."
"My man Sandman3479 hooked up a 4-pack, thanks man! Poured from undated can, though was sent """fresh", to a pint glass. The beer pours a light copper amber with a slight haze, nice 2 finger head with some retention and nice lacing. Awesome can, lol. The hops dominate the nose with citrus and earthy character with a faint pale malt backbone, no hint of the alcohol. Really enjoyable flavor with the hops immediately on your pallete. Hints of citrus: tangerine, orange, grapefruit, pine, and earthy. Medium bitterness and hoppy. Crisp and clean. Hides the alcohol very well. Medium to full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a very good DIPA. It was a treat!!"
""
""
""
"Overall; a rock sold DIPA, and certainly something I would seek out again... This is a nice DIPA, and refreshingly different from many of the IPA's available to me locally which place a far stronger emphasis on the tropics, and I felt like the candied orange peel dominant flavor really set this brew off... I really enjoyed this one, thanks again Ryan!!"
""
""
""
"O- A really really good DIPA that expected to be great, but the hops were just on the tad side faded. Too bad there is no date on the can, I'd like to know how fresh it is."
""
""
""
""

"O- This is a damn good beer. An east coast IIPA that along with Heady Topper among the west coast titans, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- expected a lot. Didn't get much. Very disappointing"
"Overall: This is a very good IPA, not sure what the date is on it, so hard to tell if I could've had a better can. Was expecting to be more wowed by this one. Glad I had it, but won't seek it out again unless I know it's super fresh as I've got better options locally."
"Overall I will I could get this beer on a consistant basis. Just wow. Top 3 or 4 DIPAS i've ever had hands down. The only negative I can say is no dates on the cans!!!"
"Bright grapefruit and grass. Restrained, but ample bitter. Prickly on the tongue. Grapefruit pith and candy orange slice fade. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"3.5/5 Mouthfeel is medium which is great for the style. Nice beer. A tiny bit of a letdown but still a great beer."
"O: A very good, easy to drink, well hopped DIPA. I have had better ones, but I think this one is very good. I would like to try it side-by-side with some other DIPAs like Hop Stoopid or Heady Topper. HT may be more appropriate since the serving container is the same."
"A near perfect IPA. Greatly crafted. This should be on every hophead's hit list."
""
""
"O-I head good things and the beer meets the hype. I hope Heady Topper is this good, because this is some good drink stuff I would drive to CT to get."
"The beer is light orange and slightly hazy with a tick, white head. The aroma offers hops, spicy malt, onions/vegetables (in a positive way). Earthy may be the term for which I am searching. The aroma is superior to the flavor, though the flavor is certainly enjoyable. Great feel. Easy to drink. Orange zest with a tasty malt backbone. Could definitely throw back multiple cans of this. Recommended."

"Overall: Totally worth the hype. A west coast IPA from the East. Outstanding."
"-GFunk"
"O- a good dipa, the only thing I don't like is that it leaves a lasting bitterness in your mouth that lingers for a bit after the fact, but the tastes work wonderfully together and overall it's one I'd keep going back to, very drinkable and delicious"

"You dont need me to tell you to get your hands on one..."

"Nice work New England! Please keep making this beer. It is instantly my favorite canned craft brew ever, that includes Maui Big Swell, a long time favorite."
"Taste is quickly sweet to start, but in the blink of an eye the citrusy bitterness takes over, dominating through the aftertaste. Very dry evaporating alcohol-type close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good for the style. Wish it was a bit more balanced, but the nature of the beast here."

"O: NEBCO's Gandhi-Bot is a world class DIPA. Just another killer hoppy offering from New England. Who'd have thought it - that the upper Northeast would be leading the way for a hop revival on the East coast? As hard as it may be to believe, this is world's better then the A- rating it currently holds. It's a must-have, and demands to be sought out by every hophead reading this."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a complex, flavorful hop profile that is nicely balanced by a sweet malt backbone. Bitter and sweet notes play off of each other with hints of dry and bitter pine needle/grass countered by notes of grapefruit and orange. The dry bitterness lasts throughout, even when the sweeter notes come into play and linger into a nice dry finish that leaves me thirsty for me. The malt backbone adds sweetness with notes of caramel, toffee and biscuit without getting in the way of the hops. Really well balanced and very flavorful with an excellently masked ABV making it dangerously drinkable. I'm impressed and ISO more!"

"Overall – A solid DIPA, though not one Id probably trade for in the future. Am very glad I was able to finally try this, but was honestly a bit let down."
"O - definitely lives up to the hype. its not super bitter (in comparison to other DIPAs) so if thats your thing you may not think too highly of it."
"This is a complex IPA. The malt and hops both express themselves in balance. At first you taste some sweetness from the malt and then the bitterness takes over. The carbonation and look of the beer is fantastic. I think this beer reminds meet of Dogfish 90, but beats in by not being overly sweet with a cleaner, dryer finish. This is not the hoppiest IPA I have ever had, but certainly the most interesting one. Fantastic beer!"
"O: For sure the best IPA I’ve had to date (beats hopslam and DFH 120 in my book). Not too overwhelming but really balanced and flavorful once it gets into your mouth. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who comes across it, if only it were easier to find."
"Picked up a 4-pack of this recently, looking forward to having it after hearing so many good things. Right after I poured there was a huge hop aroma filling the room. I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as hoppy as it smelled. Nice and crisp, not a lot of malt, and pretty good overall but nothing exceptional."
"Overall, this is different than anything else I have had in this style. The taste is not to my liking, too much pine and the fruitiness tastes like overrite fruit. I have been wanting to give this a go for awhile, thanks to angrybabboon for the can."
"Cheers..."
"CHEERS"
"D - Nice, complex balance, that belies it's ABV. Very easy to drink indeed."
"O - Solid IIPA, nice piney hops along with a silky smooth mouthfeel make this a nice drinkable beer. Little more hops may have made it better for me, but understand the restraint to make a more drinkable IIPA."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Gandhi Bot pours a light, hazy orange with a two finger head from a vigorous pour down the center of the glass. The aroma is very pleasant. Nice and light. This is a citrus laden nose. The hops and malts are really subdued indeed. The taste is stellar. A nice balanced hop, with again, a very light citrus presence. This is an easy drinker. The 8.8 is barely noticeable at all. The mouthfeel might be my favorite part of this beer. For a DIPA, it's not a tongue scorcher. You don't get the sense of getting burned out on this. It lays nicely upon your tongue, and has but only the slightest lingering bitter aftertaste. This is easily one of my favorite DIPA's/IPA's."
"Overall: This beer was a bit different from the other outstanding double IPAs, but still extremely good. The sweetness amping up was a nice change up."
"I would say this is medium bodied for a DIPA. It is really a hop forward beer all the way. Very bitter and a great display of the power of Hops. I would have liked to see a little more balance in the hop flavor though. This most recent batch seemed to be more bitter than the one i have had before. While I enjyed that characteristic of this batch, I thought the previous batch was better with more tropical fruit in the nose and taste."
"O - An outstanding D-IPA...and this came from which coast? (!!!) Fist pump to this beer, just wish it had better head retention, it lost points on the appearance."
"O- A very good DIPA with an exceptional aroma. The appearance with a little odd with so much sediment, but other than that, this is an East coast DIPA that I would love to have distributed to my area. Nice job New England Brewing Co."
"For my records: One in a mix at Nikki's, I forget how much $."
"Notes: Simply fucking great. Well done, folks. FFO Alchemist Heady Topper, Hill Farmstead Edward, etc."
"O: Unbelievably well balanced for a DIPA. No booziness, no overwhelmingly dry hop profile. It is creamy and sweet, yet still maintains an explosively flavorful and complex profile. This beer is a stunning achievement, one that was as much a pleasure to look at and smell as it was to drink. A hop bomb that is shockingly smooth and light. Buy this early, often, and in large quantities. ISO: more Gandhi-Bot."
"O A Great DIPA. Enjoyed this beer very much. This is a hop monster with a nice sweet malt complimenting everything."
"Cheers"
"O- Solid DIPA that I would love to have again. This has a lot of hops, just wish it had the room filling hops aroma."
"Tastes much like the smell with a lingering slightly bitter finish. Sweet and rich with lots of malt to balance the hops. Smooth and creamy. Overall a very nice DIPA."
"O: An excellent, easy drinking DIPA. Still one of my favorites, nice to have an excellent beer brewed 15 minutes away."
"Overall not the best DIPA I've had, but one that I enjoyed and have been wanting to try for a while. Will definitely seek this out again especially as it comes in a can!"
"O: A very very good beer. Especially from a can. It's a DIPA but it is very drinkable. I don't know the ABV, but you don't taste any alcohol at all."
"O: This is a great beer. If I had this readily available, I think it would always be in my fridge. Highly recommended."
"I like Ghandi-bot. I've been tearing apart IIPAs as boozy, cloying messes, but this manages to steer clear of those problems. In fact, I would say it does a very good job of hiding the ABV."
"I'd love to hype this somewhat-difficult-to-find local DIPA, but I just can't. The flavors just didn't work for me, and I couldn't see myself shelling out for a four-pack of 12 oz. again."
"O - I'm not just being a homer when I say I love this beer. Its one of my favorite DIPA's. Its filled with tons of piney, citrusy hoppy goodness but it is never overwhelming or too intense. It keeps its high ABV in check too. I love the fact that its in cans and the artwork is certainly interesting. CT's finest for sure."
"O: I thought this was pretty darn tasty. Nice flavors, hides the alcohol well. The bitterness lingering lowers the drinkability a bit... but it's 8.8% sooo I don't wan too many anyhow!"
"Overall, this is a great DIPA. There seems to have been some batch variation and some variation between can and tap but each has been extremely good. Huge hop flavors without the thicker, syrupy mouthfeel that comes with the territory. Very well done."
"o- a delicious beer that reminds me a lot of nugget nectar...very tasty indeed!! just wish there was more of it to go around."
"This is one tasty Double IPA. Wow. My style of DIPA too...very hop forward without too much malt sweetness or booze interfering with the hops. Quite a treat to get a chance to try this!"
"O - Overall, I loved this beer on tap more than I did the can last year. This stuff is clearly a spectactular DIPA and deserves every bit of fame it garnishes. A much buy whenever one has the chance."
"Thanks for the shot at this, Jason!"
"O: This thing drinks very nicely, and for its ABV (which I was shocked with, to be frank) at 8.8% This thing is a gem. The high alcohol would keep me from having too much of this bad boy, but I'd have no problem putting away 75% of a four pack. I'm just not sure how I'd feel. Brilliant hop character in this one that adds a compatible pine note to the pineapple. Very solid beer that is a worthy mention in style, just be sure you don't overdose on this monster incognito. Seriously, I can't believe how much bigger this beer is than I thought it was! Absolutely invisible alcohol."
"O: Probably the best east coast IPA/DIPA I've had yet. High drinkability, great balance and boldness to all of the flavors, and all delivered with great feel and presentation. Really glad I got to try this and I'd definitely try it again."
"Beer pours a hazy burnt orange color with a creamy persistent white head. Heavy aroma of citrus - pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit and just enough malt to carry it. Taste is more of the same with the malts being just enough to balance the heavy load of hops. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall, one of my favorite double IPAs that I always try to pick up whenever I """can"""."
"This one's for the hopheads."
"O- Overall I found Gandhi-Bot to be a pretty enjoyable DIPA. NEBCo does a very nice job producing a beer that splits the difference between what I consider to be an east coast DIPA and a typical west coast hop bomb. Quite drinkable. I could certainly see myself enjoying this one on a regular basis if it was available locally. Glad I had the opportunity."
"O: very enjoyable and if I could easily/readily acquire this double ipa then I definitely would keep this in the fridge at all times. Definitely glad I tried it and want to try it some more!"
"Dark golden amber color. Nicely balanced, sweet malt and hoppy aroma. Mild citrus. Flavor is malty and a little overly bitter. Medium full, thick body, mildly cloying and dry. A pleasant, perfectly average canned DIPA. It'd be nice to have this in your local market area, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Delicious double ipa that I wish was available more often! I will definitely hit this up again when it becomes available."
"Update, 10/1/11: Thanks to Heady Topper, now Gandhi-Bot is third, not second..."
"Poured into my DFH snifter- pours a murky light orange color. Pretty much opaque. Really nice head retention, nice sticky lacing all over the glass. Smell- hmm not much here. Some sweet tropical flavors, but this doesn't have that big of a aroma at all. Taste- really nice tart citrus flavors, definite hop presence, but well balanced with a nice malt sweetness. Mouthfeel- the dry finish and tart tropical presence here really makes this easy to drink. Drinkability- this is a really nice DIPA- I like that the ABV is a little lower than normal- seems like this beer is all about balance, which it has achieved. I would def have it again."
"Somewhat cloudy orange that once it settled became a fairly clear, deep golden color. No real head to speak of but definate carbonation. Big citrusy, resiny and line aroma. Malty presence with a tongue stripping hop bitterness. Long, lingering sticky, pine like flavor. Decent mouthfeel, there is a residual, somewhat gummy sweetness. A real good double IPA. Personally I like more hop flavor then the bitter blast so too many might be a bit overwhelming. Still a damn fine brew."
"Obviously a fantastic brew if it joins my top 5 after one review. Go get you some!"
"Double Ghandi Bot – Really murky copper, not all that attractive. Smell is very balanced IPA, good hop, good malt backbone sweet, but not overly so. Whoa hop explosion in my mouth, a little too bitter for my palette, once I got over the hop explosion, the sweetness came out which is really nice, but still a bit too bitter for what I look for in an ipa. Mouth is medium, but VERY bittery aftertaste. nice double/triple ipa…good, not amazing, but good."
"Nice brew here all-around. The ABV is nearly completely hidden, but adds just a bit of (welcome) harshness to the flavors. It's a little pricey (I paid 13.50 for the four-pack), but it's rare enough to give a whirl once in a while."
"O- This brew is great. I wish it wasnt such a hassle to get"
"O- A really nice DIPA. Worth a try if you like a more mild DIPA. For me, not in the top tier. Very easy and nice to drink."
"O = IMO, it live up to the hype. I expected a lot and this brew delivered. It's a great, hoppy, Imperial (red) ale. I can't wait to have another."
"D: Very good DIPA, just wish it were available more often and more widespread."
"Overall: Great beer! Incredibly drinkable for a DIPA. Balance and motuhfeel were key for this one, in my opinion."
"Overall I really love this brew... It's among the few that I try to keep as a regular in my fridge.  NEBCO needs to make this a year-round offering.  It really stands up to the west coast IPA/DIPAs."
"O- Really great brew from NEBcO. I'll be sure to pick this up whenever it comes out."
"Reveal: NEBCO Gandhi-Bot! Man, I wish there was a can date on there. I’ve heard such different things about this beer, I’m surprised there wasn’t more up front. I think if they toned down the bittering hops a hare, and then dry hopped the fuck out of this it would be epic."
"on 7/10/11 had it again in a can, and this beer is fucking fantastic. Lots of floates, which I'm not sure is normal."
"Looks like the rematch has me as victor on the cards. Sadly I liked the super aggressive version and this seemed to fall short to me. Nevertheless this is a solid beer and I would certainly like more."
"Overall: This is a very good IPA, personally I think it rivals other top notch IPAs I’ve had in the past. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it."
"Suffice to say: this medium mouthfeel and easy drinking beer is good."
"If Gandhi had been a drinker, I’m sure he’d have been cool with this."
"12oz can pours a thick, hazy burnt orange with minimal head and almost no lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, grass, pine, and slightly yeasty. I pick up lemons and orange peel, with some hint of spices. Mouthfeel is dry, and heavy. Taste throws at you a really dry mix of everything you smell. This is in my top 5 IPAs. It may be a contender for #1."
"Pours a beautiful honey color that forms a thick white head. Head doesn't stay around long, but the lacing on the glass is the best I have ever seen. Smells of pine, floral hops, and citrus. Tastes of bitter hops, citrus, grapefruit, and a sweet malt. The mouthful has a perfect texture and the carbonation is very good. Overall this beer ranks as a top tier DIPA. I would put this in the same category as Pliny the Elder, Dreadnaught, etc. I would have no problem drinking a 4 pack of these in a setting and wish it was sold around here. It would become a staple in the fridge!"
"This was a very smooth, easy drinking beer."
"O: One of my favorite beers - New England Brewing makes some of the best brewed beers and can easily compete with the big names in Craft Beer."
"O: Although New England Brewing is hyped for its Imperial Stout Trooper beer, I'd have to argue that this is the best offering they make. An east coast style iipa that I would pit against any other around the country. Seek it out, its definitely worth the trouble."
"Overall a great IPA. Would get more if I could. Might have to trade for some more."
"O - I'm really enjoying this beer it tastes very good making it a little too easy to drink for the abv but none the less if I was able to get this on the regular I would worth seeking out to try"
"D-Overall this might be my favorite DIPA to date. Had such complexity and stood out from other DIPA's ive had before. I wish this was local to me. I will trade multiple times a year to get this brew. And it being in a can makes it that much better to take camping or out on the Disc golf course! GIVE this beer a try you wont be dissapointed"
"Overall - Delicious IPA that maybe could use a bit more maltiness. If I had access to this more often, I'd definitely drink it again."
"Massive thanks goes out to my boy Jefe73 sending me this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from can into a Green Man snifter. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a half finger bone white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a damn tasty brew. Very well balanced flavor going on here with a great aroma as well. The CAN really delivered on this one! Maybe this is why Woody is on the CAN Quest... Only thing this brew is lacking is appearance, but who cares when it tastes and smells that good (and no, that's not a 'that's what she said' joke)... Get your hands on this one! You will not regret doing so. Thanks again for the chance to try this one Jeff!"
"On tap at Mikro with R Moe Nay, Pustevlaho, Andrea, and Jlynn. Looks like the yellow brick road... clear, golden, and carbonated. Smells of grapefruit, citrus, and HOPS! So hoppy and such a fruity sweetness to balance it out. This DIPA fresh is tough to beat. Pliny and Topper are the only beers off hand that I can think of that rival it. I absolutely love the hop profile of this beer. The alcohol is completely hidden and a clean smooth feel would be an understatement. Love having this brewery in my state. The only thing I can think of that distinguishes this beer on tap from the can is the ever so slight freshness of the hops and carbonation is dead on. The score if the same for the can because I can give the taste a 4.7 for the bottle and 4.6 for the can respectively."
"O (D) - fine, inoffensive, but not great tasting, which is its primary fault"
"Pours a hazy orange/yellow/gold with a nice white head. Fades quick. I smell pine, grapefruit, resin and maybe some bready malt. Smells like a good DIPA. Taste is like the nose, piney hops with some citrus and a bready malt back. Bitter, but not obnoxiously so. Pretty balanced. Good carbonation and a nice, medium mouthfeel with some sweetness, but not too much. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, I'm pretty impressed. I wasn't sure what to expect fromthis beer... Now I've had it, and decided it will stay on my wants list."
"Smell on Gaandhi-Bot contains mucho hops, grapefruit, and a good amount of pine as well. It really hits you with a punch. Taste has plenty more of the hops, with a sweetness, some citrus, and more of the pine in its` finish. MF is medium w/ a similar carbonation. Overall, this is a great DIPA. If you have not enjoyed this yet, do so when you have the opportunity."
"D: I think Ghandi Bot is very well done and extremely drinkable...I like the fact that is a relatively low abv DIPA...I could see myself easily putting down a few of these over the course of an evening and it would definitely be in my regular rotation if it was distributed in the great PNW!"
"Odd name and packaging aside, this is a fairly middle-of-the-road Double IPA."
"D- 8.8%?? Glad I saw that before I went planned on drinking all 4 I had. Very easy to drink. Would love some more of this! Big thanks to Doug for hooking me up on this one!"
"Extremely high. I feel like I could drink this all night, any night. Assuming it's a hops night. I would definitely buy this if I could get it in my area."
"Now hop to it, and get some!"
"The CPJ"
"Same with the taste-very smooth for this type of brew. Somewhat sour from hops, and a piney undertone. Amazingly smooth for the ABV, and the style!"
"I love this brewery's Sea Hag IPA, and this is on par with that, only hoppier (duh). And like Sea Hag, it drinks way too quickly, which is both a credit to how delicious it is and something to be careful of, considering this approaches the 9% ABV mark. Gandhi would have loved this noise!"
"D: The booziness strength isn't evident at first. It does build though, getting stronger with almost every sip. It's good but not as good as it smells."
"3.5 D: Not bad and definitely something I would drink again, but doesn't quite live up to expectations."
"What an IIPA, this is the first one I had that I thoroughly enjoyed many months ago and started my hops craze. Thanks NEBCo for this awesome beer and congrats on the BA recognition!"
"D - Very drinkable. At 8.8% abv, this beer stays super smooth and crisp. The hop profile is really amazing. Lots of complex flavor that mixes together for a really excellently balanced beer."
"Perhaps the best median for this beer. The explosion of citrus is extraordinary. Simply amazing. Cask is the way to go for this beer. One of the best experiences I have had with a beer."
"It's a really nice DIPA. One of my favorites so far. Thanks again for sending this my way, Evan. This is a rarity on this end of the planet. Highly recomended."
"I can certainly appreciate this IPA even if it's not my go to style of beer."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ yellow, with an off white head. In the aroma, orange citrus hops. In the taste, a sweet to dry slight orange citrus and a faint hop taste. A citrus hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry orange citrus aftertaste. The flavor is lighter than the nose, hides the alcohol, nice hop presence and really dig it."
"Drink- It's a vegan brew and very tasty. I would like another. The hops are in your face for the DIPA as they should and its a big drinking beer at 8.8"
"Gandhi Bot lives up the reputation it has created- and formitable Imperial IPA with an understated way of declaring it's strength in flavor, aroma, balance, and complexity. Elegant in every way."
"reviewed from notes. from a snifter glass. golden almost orange in color. minimal head and lacing. smell is hops, more specifically citrus/orangy and floral. very forward hop presence. fairly strongly carbonated. incredibly drinkable, and I would love to get my hands on more as soon as possible. very well put together, as all the flavors meld together very well."
"Enjoyed on 1/19/11"
"Maybe the can wasn't fresh, maybe it just isn't for me."
"Excellent beer, flat out excellent. NEBC absolutley nailed this one. Absurdly drinkable, bright aroma and balanced flavor. I am not certain I could ask for more. A top tier DIPA."
"Many people have told me about this elusive beer, and when I found it I knew it was a good buy, but damn. It's a great dIPA and will be enjoyed again soon."
"Drinkablilty is quite good. This is a solid example of a DIPA, well balanced, but nicely hopped too."
"D- I'm glad this comes in four-packs. I love this stuff, and I love that it comes from my home town! Highly drinkable!"
"I received this beer as an extra from Shaggy9356, thanks Matt! Before pouring it into my snifter I had to take a swig from the can to know what I was getting into. Needless to say, I already want more. It poured a murky burnt orange with a one finger creme colored head. It smells of floral, bitter hops and I love it. This is the most floral beer I've had in awhile. The flavor is very dry and bitter and finishes with a sweet citrus like flavor that goes into the drier hop ridden aftertaste. This gets big points from me. It drinks impressively smooth and crisp simultaneously. What an awesome beer, and from a can?!?! This beer lives up to the hype and is exceptionally drinkable."
"Thanks Mike!"
"Drinkability: fairly drinkable but the bitterness gets to me"
"I am sending these to friends that would appreciate."
"D: Very Good beer overall, would buy if I saw it in the store!"
"-very good IPA. i would say the best DIPA in a can i have had in a can. really wish this was made in the west coast for all my outdoor adventures"
"poured into a snifter. very cloudy with an orange color. head is not as big as I would like, but pour was also semi-passive so maybe that's it. the smell is of tropical fruits and strong. Very much like a Sculpin in that way. Taste is similar, with a powerful hop presence although bitterness is minimal. mouthfeel is on the thicker side for a DIPA, but pleasant. Drinkability is incredibly good. This is one of the few East Coast IPAs that seems to draw inspiration from San Diego breweries. Excellent beer."
"D - not just solid, but a damn fine wonderfully crafted DIPA. easily the best beer I've had by NEBC to date (including IST, which I was a big fan of). this is straight out of the left coast, with a wonderful look, scent, and taste. this is CAN #2 down from a 4pack I just received today, the other 2 will be gone in no time."
"Gandhi-Bot is medium bodied with creamy carbonation and is very pleasant to drink. Mostly because the beer is not sticky or coating. This is delicious, I would drink a ton of this if it was around. Very nice canned DIPA, but also just a very nice DIPA all-around."
"This beer pours an odd cloudy orange with tints of brown and lots of white sediment floating around inside the glass. There was a decent white frothy head, but the yeast sediment is a big turn off. The smell is a mixture of piny hops and lemon zest, it's rather nice but still not strong enough to be in the realm of a bouquet. The taste is aggressively hoppy. The front end is a nice sweet floral taste, but quickly degrades into a bitter film left on the tongue. It's a pretty drinkable IPA, but I must admit that it does truly have some bigger flaws. Overall still a rather pleasant beer something that would be just fine with me if I was handed in the future."
"Poured from the can into a Tulip glass...this allowed for the citrus and hops to shine through. Came off piney and sweet at the dame time. The beer poured golden and hazy, with not much in terms of head or lacing for me. Taste was hops of front to me backed by the citrus behind. Agree with some others that it comes off West Coast, but that does not downgrade it in the least. fantastic brew, extremely drinkable, and with the ABV being so well hidden, I could definitely see myself waking up under a table somewhere with a bunch of cans beside me."
"Huh, didn't know this did 12oz cans. Pretty sure if I did three or four of these while I mowed the lawn, I'd be redoing my work the next day. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Very enjoyable, glad I got to try it blind."
"Tastes a bit heavier than what I'd prefer for a DIPA. Although the flavor is hop forward, the malt adds a dimension that I'm not really a fan of. There is also a very earthy taste. It is more bitter than it is flavorful, unfortunately. But I'm just nitpicking here. This is quite a tasty beer."
"if this beer were not 8.8% I could drink them all day."
"D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easy, not too filling, nice kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely an excellent 2IPA worth drinking for a whole evening."
"All in all, my favorite DIPA to date. I wish I could get my hands on more of it as it's quite delectable. The ABV will creep on you quick, that is for certain! If you have the chance to try this, do not pass it up."
"Thanks to steve8robin for this one. I poured from a 12 ounce can into a sa perfect pint glass. Deep yellow/orange pour, 2 inch sticky head. The aroma is wonderful, pineapple, oranges and tropical fruit. A big rush of juicy tropical fruit up front, followed by sweet citrus. It has a drying finish, sweeter than I expected. It has a medium/full body, nicely carbonated. A great DIPA, luckily I have another can to enjoy."
"12oz can shared by sstackho, thanks! Pours a nice vibrant orange with a finger of bubbly head. Nose is filled with tropical fruits and citrus rinds - pineapple, grapefruit, mango. Long lasting bitterness, real pithy finish, hint of leafy hops, some pine. Balanced by a biscuity caramel malt body, not too sweet. Hides the ABV real well, nice dry long bitter finish - this is a top notch DIPA and being in a can is a double bonus. Wish we had something like this available here."
""""In a beer can," this is a beauty that I find very hard to pass up when I come across it on my trips to the New England area. If it were sold closer to me, I'd make it an essential to have in the fridge at all times...Into an oversize wine glass, it pours a dull and dense foggy grapefruit-orange color and carries an aroma of crisp sweet grapefruit citrus and orange rind zest. From open to finish, this packs a mega punch of hops that elegantly ravages the palate with citrus bitterness and leaves your mouth feeling like what I can best compare to as the same mouth coating numbness you'd experience after eating a fresh whole small grapefruit. Though this seems a little extreme, I warn you. This is an Imperial IPA that will quickly make great friends with your palate after smothering it and sneaking its a.b.v. in through the back window. Thus, it also becomes dangerously smooth. So hopheads, REJOICE!"
"This is an outstanding take on the style and extremely enjoyable. You New Englanders are lucky!"
"Drinkability: Above average DIPA"
"D - I could go all night (but I know the 8.5 will slow me down sooner rather than later)."
"Thanks to JoeyBeerBelly for the opportunity to try this one! Pours a super hazy golden orange color with lots of yeast chunkies floating around with a small head and no lacing. Not sure I like all this sediment in my IPAs... Nice, tropical fruit aroma, mostly pineapple and orange, light grapefruit, and a mustiness from the yeast. Taste is very nice, not overly bitter. Good dose of citrus, pale malts give a cracker-like quality, lightly sweet, and again, yeasty. Flavor seems to be a bit light for a double IPA, but I'm glad it's not ridiculously bitter. Body is below medium, and carbonation is very light. Overall, it's well balanced and pretty drinkable, just wish I had known there was this much sediment in the bottom so I could have kept it out of my glass. This might be the one setback of craft beer and cans... Makes it difficult to decant properly. But overall, a tasty brew!"
"D: Pretty good and easy to drink"
"Drinkability: I do like the combination of the different types of hops. A good beer to sit with if you want a hop bomb. One or two max."
"D- I could have several of these in one sitting and I'm really glad I was able to trade for some fresh. Not sure if I like it more than Dreadnaught but $11 for a bomber of Dreadnaught or about $10 for a 4pack of Ghandi-Bot (if I remember correctly), I think I'd be grabbing the Ghandi more often if it was available locally."
"A very drinkable beer for its alcohol content. The balance between hops and malt is better than many IIPAs"
"Drinkability: Simply put, this is a fine drinking DIPA. I previously had this from a growler, and I enjoyed that version a bit more. Still, a great tasting DIPA that I would recommend to anybody who is a fan of the style. Great beer."
"It is very nice to have a place close by to get good growler fills. can't wait to try the Tequila Barrel aged variety!"
"d - I thought this was an awesome DIPA. I loved the smell; lots of citrus hops jump out at you. I wish the taste wasn't quite as bitter, but still a great DIPA. Would definitely like to have again and glad I have a few more cans of it."
"Ghandi Bot is one of a very few number of beers that I get excited about when I see it in the store. I invaribly buy as much as possible- and I drink nothing but it until it's gone. I am bumping up the score a bit 'cause damn this is a good beer."
"D: Really tasty, really good-smelling, a little strong but ultimately as drinkable as a DIPA should aspire to be. It's gunky look was a little off-putting (maybe a more careful pour with the remaining cans?), but the end result is: this is one any hop-lover MUST try. Thanks to Charlie & Alan for the chance to taste this DIPA - one that'll rank among my tops for the style (possibly the best I've tried from a can)."
"D: A really good DIPA. Exceptional smell and very good all around. It doesn't knock down the heavy hitter of the style, but this one is better than most. Another huge thanks to SneezyAchew for hooking me up!"
"D: Good stuff. Not in the same realm as what I can buy here, but if it were on my shelf at competitive prices, I'd certainly buy this once in a while. As a special release or beer I have to trade for, I don't think I'd seek it out."
"Overall I'd heard a bunch of hype behind this beer and I was not disappointed. Easily one of the better East Coast DIPA's out there and one that's well worth a shot."
"Crack & Glug time: Holy Grapefruit Juice, Batman! First off, that little 12-oz. CAN produced better than two fingers' worth of eggshell-white head with excellent retention. The room was now like a grapefruit tree stand. Color was a cloudy yellowish-orange, like fresh-squeezed grapefruit. My hops jones was starting to reappear today and I was not sure that it was welcome. Mouthfeel was medium and the grapefruit taste was intense, but it was not as abrasive as another DIPA from earlier this day. As a matter of fact, this was hoppy, certainly, on the tongue, but relatively unassertive in terms of its bitterness. I was liking this from the outset. The finish was zesty, like orange zest intermingled with caramel. Think one of those Brach's Orange Caramels that they may not even make any more. I remember them well as one ripped a filling out, much to my mother's chagrin and anger. This made me feel good about myself, just like stopping the lashings, even for a moment. At 8.8, though, it might be better at home than in the cooler. Just sayin' ..."
"D-Certainly a well done beer but the hop profile does not match my desires. I liked it for sure but did not love it. A life changing beer, errr, no. A nicely done East Coast DIPA, sure."
"DB- Very flavorful, well done hop bomb. Reminds me of the great West coast IIPAs."
"D - Fair drinkability, don't get me wring very tasty but couldn't drink more than one of these due to the strong citrus hops and the ensuing dryness."
"D - Unusual DIPA here. What do you get when you pair burnt biscuits and citrus rind? Gandhi-Bot, apparently. While I'm not 100% sold on it, I appreciated the uniqueness of this brew."
"A tree sap sticky feel, though the low, but tingly carbonation makes this insanely drinkable leading towards that final punch of hops and pine needles."
"D: Pretty good."
"Good drinkability. Especially if you are a hophead!"
"The perfect amount of bitterness for me personally. Bubbly carbonation. Not a tongue scraping DIPA."
"Taste, doesn't weigh heavy, lots of hop mouthfeel, kinda light bodied, not a lot of malt to back it up, which is nice, I'm tired of all the malt heavy super sweet dipa's out there. If I wanted a barleywine, I'd just get one and sit on it for a year. This stuff is great for disc golf. Almost 9%, you'd never know unless you read it somewhere."
"Pretty full bodied DIPA with higher than average carbonation. Bitterness is pretty present but also has a good citrus balance. I would definitely recommend for others to try."
"D: Not bad for a fairly high abv beer. The strong flavors, especially the rampant hoppiness, might prove to be too much after a couple. This probably wasn't intended to be a session beer though."
"Overall, can't wait 'til the Tequila BA version comes out!"
"A damn good DIPA I wish I had more access to."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Rather herbal and quite bitter. Grapefruit flesh and rind, noticeable and fairly harsh alcohol. Herbal and floral hop flavors with a light crystal malt presence that provides a little sweetness. More acerbity than I like in an IPA, this is a real tongue bruiser."
"Overall a very solid Double IPA. Tought to call it balanced as you get almost no malt but you don't get andy alcohol taste at all. Tough to put my finger on this beer, hazy, hoppy, little malt. Intriguing...awesome!!"
"All in all, this is a great brew. I have loved this one since I first tried it. It is a great balance between hop and malt which is what I love about this brew. Not just super bitter or super sugary. Try if you like a balanced IPA."
"D - A very nice DIPA. Nice light malt base really allows the hop complexity to show through. Alcohol is well hidden. A true gem for the hop heads"
"THANK YOU NEW ENGLANG BREWING"
"D - goes down easy, beware of the abv."
"Overall: This was a great beer that somewhat meets the hype. It was almost too built up to me, but it was a damn good beer. The only thing I think that could have boosted my overall enjoyment would have been a bigger contribution from the malt to get more sweetness into the vibrant citrus flavors."
"D: Pretty good all around, balance is a little off ... too much bitterness lingering after the finish for my liking."
"Drinkability: I traded for this and I'm glad I did, I'm especially glad I have 3 more cans left. A very good citrusy DIPA from the east coast."
"Notes: This beer has earned quite a bit of critical acclaim. It is good, but I don't feel it lives up to the hype. Citric grapefruit taste dominates too much and creates a rather one dimensional beer."
"Drinkability: Good."
"D- Hopheads would delight and drink it all night."
"D - good drinkability. The dryness makes it hard to put away but that not always a bad thing. The bitter/sweet makes it...interesting... To be honest, I think I love the fact that Gandhi is depicted as a robot and find that slightly more entertaining than the beer itself, but it is still a decent brew."
"Quality DIPA for sure, superbly bitter (almost too much), and the can artwork is awesome."
"Finish is the most distinctive part of this brew, being very bitter pine and long and bold."
"Beer is light in body for a DIPA, about a medium body overall, really drinkable with a chewy resiny hoppiness to the whole thing. Its bright in the front without being overly sweet and its bitter in the back but not very dry. I really enjoyed this beer overall. I think its a great DIPA. Drinkability high."
"Poured from a 12oz can into my pint glass. Sweet. The body is hazy golden color with lots of lively looking carbonation and about a centimeter of creamy white head that leaves sticky lace. The aroma is full of citrus, namely pineapples and orange and a bitter hop aroma to finish. Notes of caramel linger in the behind the citrus and hop aroma. Not quite as juicy as I had pictured this one to be. Actually, relatively dry. I feel misled by the aroma. However, this still taste pretty good. Bitter pine hops bombard my pallet and finish nicely with a decent malt profile and citrus finish. Again, just not what I expected. The mouthfeel is heavy and a bit dry, finishes bitter and slightly syrupy. And as with other recent double IPA experiences, this one hides the alcohol very well. This is one that I truly love, drinkable to no end for me. I'll snag this anytime I see it."
"Very light body makes this dangerously drinkable. Easily one of my favorite double IPA's"
"This is an awesome offering from New England Brewing, something a trade friend showed me, and I'm glad. I'm a big advocate of cans, especially when local quality beer rests inside them like this. I still want some IST Kevin! You heard me!"
"Drinkability- I would definitely come back to this one. It's good for when you are in the mood for good beer, but don't want to think too much about what you are drinking or want to have something super rare. Very similar Half Acres Daisy Cutter. I would probably chose Daisy Cutter over this, but all in all they fill a similar need."
"D-decent IPA with big flavor and very assertive bitterness. hop forward and slightly messy flavors but still very enjoyable."
"I really was expecting this to not live up to the hype and I was flat out WRONG. Very, very good. Really enjoyable, with some complexities that happen after the second can."
"D- I'd enjoy this one again. Its a solid example of the DIPA style of beer, but its nothing fantastic. It could be better in many ways. If you love bitter pine flavor and something to sniff at, sure. If you have come to expect more from your DIPA, move along."
"Drinkability -- Pretty damn good. I'd be all over this if it were near me. Citrus bomb for sure. Great malting, nice hop bitterness levels, immensely drinkable. Good stuff."
"D - I dunno. I enjoyed the smell more than the flavor. Could use some more lively hop character. I might try this again on draft but don't see myself seeking out any more cans of this."
"D - An easy to drink DIPA. Would def go back to this if I was local to this one. Nice."
"Medium bodied, bubbly and well carbonated, pops on the palate. Goes down quickly from the slick feel, but I'm not sure I'd feel compelled to work my way through another can at this time. No freshness date makes me wonder whether I got the true experience of this beer or not. The results are a mixed bag."
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, very satisfying. a bit of warming in the cheeks. Scarily drinkable. Tremendous DIPA from little old CT. Eassiide..."
"NEBC - please make this a regular in your line up !!"
"A lighter and smooth dipa, but nothing that wows you. Worth trying if your around it."
"Recommended."
"Overall this is a nice, interesting DIPA that I had never heard of before. I almost feel like I'm being a little harsh on the taste with my 3.5, as I've warmed up to it a bit, but the intangible harshness makes it a little hard to drink for me, I dunno... I'd recommend trying this beer for sure."
"D: Goes down easily, very nice kick, damn good representation of style. I'd been moving away from DIPA's but this is the best DIPA that I've had in a while."
"D: I think this is very drinkable, it has flavors I could put up with for an evening. I like this, and hope I can find more in the future."
"M/D: Very smooth for a DIPA, extremely drinkable. Wish I could get more of it!"
" I am not the biggest fan of DIPA's, most of the time they are too malty and syrupy with an overly aggressive punch of hops that one tastes as over done piney resin. This is one of the few DIPA's that I actually enjoy because the malt is not in charge of the beer and the hop's are balanced out throughout the beer in a nice progression that suggests a well thought out plan of hop additions/dry-hopping."
"Drinkability: This is a DIPA just like I like them - lots of west coast citrus, a well-attenuated malt character, and the alcohol is well-disguised"
"D:I received this beer in my first trade on BA and I think I made the right choice and appreciate irishct15 for getting back to me to do it. To put it plain and simple this one is a hop lovers dream, super tasty with hops exploding everywhere, easy drink for ABV, and hands down the best beer I have ever had out of a can....so far. Look froward to scoring more of these in the future."
"Man, this is a good beer. Really glad I got to try this so fresh. Too bad for my chump friends that they missed out; maybe I'll just have to get another one next time I'm passing through New Haven."
"This does not seem like a DIPA compared to the others from the North East I've been drinking. Is that the west coast style? Perhaps the lighter color (sunshine orange) and dry finish fooled me -- I was not inclined to sip, rather I wanted to gulp it down. Very refreshing, and it sat well in my stomach allowing me to have another brew."
"I wanted to find this in a can, but it sold out so quickly I missed out, however getting it fresh on tap is more than a consolation. I met Rob at the brewery and he showed me around, it's a great little stop. I stopped at the liquor store down the road on the way back and I picked up some other NEBC beers (Sea Hag & Elm City Lager), looking forward to them!"
"D - An uncommonly delicious DIPA, and at any rate it is certainly an interesting take on the style"
"D - I liked this beer but may be a bit heavy for more than one or two. I really liked this one and will seek it out again."
"Drinkability is quite good though, to me, it comes across as stronger than the abv says. Not much of a complaint, really."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. A lasting amount of hop character clings to the inside of the mouth and just sticks with an oily and resinous power of retension that the head could have took a lesson from. For pushing almost 9% alcohol, I could get myself in trouble with a couple of these, they go down easy."
"Definitely a good DIPA here but the sharp spiciness of the hops just kept it from reaching that next level for me. I actually quickly followed this up with another can, just to make sure that I hadn't missed something but found the same result. Definitely one to try if you come across a can but this wasn't the end-all be-all of East Coast IPAs, as some might have you believe."
"D -A sweet/bitter balance -lots of hoppy goodness-a definite must-try in my book, Thanks Adam!"
"Well done, gonna buy more next time I travel to the Nutmeg state"
"Pours a nice hazy golden carmel orange. Nice one finger head that fades to spotty lacing. Huge hop aroma, piney and citrus. Tastes of carmel then grapefruit, lots of creaminess then a nice hop pucker at the end. Kind of easy drinker for this high ABV. I'd get this again."
"Excellent DIPA."
"M&D - one of the smoothest DIPA's I have ever quaffed, blended and balanced perfectly, syrupy and viscous on the tongue, definitely one of the favorite DIPA'a"
" The alcohol is pretty well hidden on the swallow but does make its presence known after the first pint is emptied. A very drinkable deceptively bigger beer. I enjoy this one a lot and will be picking up more and sharing with friends."
"Pours a soft yellow-orange color that is entirely translucent with a frothy white head. Some lacing is left behind when the head dies down. Aroma is filled with pine, grapefruit, citrus peel and warm bread. Flavors follow suit with a blast of hops through out each sip. The finish is dry and refreshing while retaining that subtle lemon drop feeling in the back of my throat that is a signature of a hoppy blend. Smooth and crisp, this is a great beer to pair with pizza, as I did and I could have a few of these in a sitting though the ABV might get the better of me. A great beer from NEBC."
"D: Quite drinkable. You do feel that ABV, but it is such a drinkable beer that having a second (or third) can is possible."
"MF/D- Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation for a DIPA. Not syrupy at all. Drinkability is good, but it is 8.8%. Could've had a couple of these for the smell and taste alone."
"Thanks Allie."
"O: Overall, a phenomenal brew! This is truly a benchmark when it comes to Dipas. This would be a go to if it weren't so limited in availability."
"12oz can. Pours a hazy orange color with a thin head. Aroma is sweet. Hops, citrus, grapefruit and a fair amount of pine. Taste is somewhat sweet with a bitter aftertaste. More pine with some citrus. The 8.8% ABV is hidden well. I miss drinking an Imperial IPA out of the Tall Boy can but, oh well. Finally it pays to live on the East Coast."
"Too bad it is such a limited release. I would love to have cans of this around to take to cookouts all summer long."
"Overall- With all the homer bias and all, this is easily one of my favorite DIPAs besides maybe Hopslam and Maharaja. An amazing DIPA and definitely worth seeking out. I can only hope that it is just as good from a can."
"Drinkability:I really enjoyed this DIPA, tons of hops, lots of malt flavor. Plus, the artwork on the can is fantastic!"
"1st growler from nebco, those guys are alright. Super pumped on this beer. Pours a real lovely opaque golden orange with a nice two finger puffy white head that leaves lots of lacing for a x2ipa. Aroma is just what I was hoping for, tones of hops. Piney, citrusy, and oh man sooo fresh. I'm getting some stone fruit too like apricot. Flavor is first big grapefruit, little apricot, bunch more citrus and then the piney bittering hops take hold of you. Great hop show case. Nice mouthfeel, dense but not overly carbed. Other than the higher abv on this I could drink alot of it."
"THE BOT!!! Would not have thunk soemone could put this much hoppy goodness in a can, but NEB KILLED this. The flavors of wweet floral hops are intense and NOT OVERPOWERED by a dry, almost delicate malt backbone. The nose matches, with all sorts of dankness."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of various hops. I get some resin and orange notes with some caramel malt. The taste is pine and orange flavored hops with caramel malt. The bitterness is low to medium due to the malt backbone. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Sweet citrus and pine hop profile balanced out with the malt makes this one dangerously drinkable. Overall not the greatest tasting DIPA, a very enjoyable one to drink."
"D: Another excellent offering from NEBC. Those guys seem to put out great beer after great beer. And Ghandi-bot is no exception. Big hop flavor, nice malty balance, this is a great DIPA."
"Pours a very nice hazy dark copper color, nice carbonation, very nice thick creamy two-finger light tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, a nice little malt note, citrus, pine note. The taste is sweet, hoppy, nice little malt note, good punch of citrus and pines. Medium body. Very Drinkable, this one really surprised me, very nice, true to style. Thanks Cody!"
"HV"
"D: This was unique and pretty good...definitely worth a try. I don't think I'd want more than one 16 ounce at a time though as it is pretty thick and heavy."
"D - Lots and lots of flavor but still smooth and easy to drink. I liked this one."
"Kinda let down with this one. I don't think the hops and malt had any semblance of balance and I struggled to find any pleasant flavors or aromas from the hops...is this a Barleywine or an IPA??? Really not sure..."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable despite the bitterness. Great job NEBCO!"
"Another gem from a couple of guys who basically work out of a garage. Way to be NEBCO."
"Another canned beer I was excited to try. Loving this new trend. Pours a nice golden, orange-amber color, with a good inch or so of ecru foam. Nice aromas of orange rind, grapefruit and caramel. On the palate, the hop brightness is not quite as pronounced, although it is quite evident in the bitter finish. Not a great DIPA (at least not by west coast standards) but a good one."
"d- fantastic from what I can tell from this sixteen ounce can. I can't help but like a beer more for being in a can and having the fucking sweetest label ever. This one doesn't stop there, though, it's a damn tasty brew to boot. I would jump at the chance to have this one again."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I only managed to pick up two of these at 4.99 each, so the whole drinkability factor went right out the window, but enjoy them if you found some."
"The picture on the can makes this more than worth it, even before any tasting is done. Classic. The beer itself pours a hazy tawny orange with a solid finger of light ecru foam on top, which dies away after a short while to a mere single layer of bubbles languishing on the surface. The nose comprises a sharp pine, grass, a bit of wet hay, and plenty o' citrus peel. Some vague, dark sweetness pervades the background. The taste is quite similar, with the pine and citrus rocking full bore (who'da thunk hops being strong in a DIPA?), carousing with dark greens and a solid mass of toffee. The body is a strong medium, with active, though still moderate, carbonation and a somewhat chewy feel. It's like a light syrup that somehow wastes away into a watery purgatory. Whatever that means. More than many DIPAs, I find myself wanting to go back to the glass well quite often, the thirst never fully slaked. Get some!"
"D: Quite nice, especially for a beer out of can! I would definitely seek this out again, although I can't imagine drinking several of these out camping."
"Thanks to Knifestyles for this one. A 16 ounce can poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazed honey amber color with about two fingers of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of white and red grapefruit juice, pith, and peel, bitter lemon and orange, pine, sweet caramel and melon rind aromas, floral pineapple. Amply carbonated with a medium to full body. Finish is dry and bitter with very little alcohol heat. Thanks again Chris!"
"This is a very intense DIPA that really hits the spot. The aroma and mouthfeel are excellent! I hope this is a year-round release by New England Brewing!"
"D: Extremely enjoyable. I love getting stuff like this (included as an extra in a trade-thanks Joe!). Delicious hops with a near perfect malt balance. Yes!"
"Overall, the nose was the best part of this beer, but the taste didn't keep up. It was chewy like citra and I really liked that aspect about this beer with all the fruit flavors. It is fairly drinkable and definitely something to try!"
"Good beer and something I would definitely drink again."
"Great beer, I don't see the alcohol content on the can, but I'm sure it's pretty high, I'd recommend savoring this one."
"Strong bitter hop flavor. Starts with a very brief round malt taste. Excellent body with a below typical carbonation. Long lip-smacking bitter aftertaste."
"-Cheers!"
"Our local heroes at NEB have really stepped up their game and Gandhi Bot is evidence of their dedication to bringing great tasting, big and balanced craft brews to the region. Great artwork, great flavor, great craftsmanship and a great DIPA all around. Drink it. It's good."
"O - Excellent beer and well done NEBC! One of my favorite new DIPA offerings of the year so far. I look forward to stocking up on this one!. Also love your label, very cool!"
"Drinkability- Overall not bad. I wish the nose was a bit more potent but the different hop profile is a nice change of pace. I'm sure this was a bit better fresh but still tasty. Thanks much Adam!"
"Overall I have to say I was quite impressed. This was a damn good double and a fine beer all around would love to do it again for sure."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is there. bitterness is there. flavor is there, too. definitely east coast style on the flavor with the herbal, earthy and malty notes, but with some west coast essence mixed in."
"Nice beer and seems to have a draft feel to it. I like the effort and would seek this out again. Well done."
"D - Very easy to get down. Becomes exceptionally more bitter as you continue to drink it. I would drink this again as it is pretty good and great to put down."
"Poured from the 16 oz can into a Sam perfect pint. Pours a hazy dark orange with a thin white head. Lots of nice lacing. Lots of citrus on the nose. Really refreshing smell. Taste is clean and bitter. Lots of fruit- orange, grapefruit even a bit of pineapple. Biting, bubbly mouthfeel gives a orange soda feel to it. Nice beer."
"Very fresh local offering! Pretty impressed by last couple NEBC offerings that Jaxon53 has sent my way. Unique lable over the can that I've never seen before. Wish I could hear the Gandi-bot talk. Thinking it would sound like something between Apu and Wall-e."
"I'd say in terms of appearance, smell, and taste this is a great beer. Unfortunately, its attributes rank in that order. Overall, B-B+."
"This is a solid DIPA that really brings the bitterness in the taste with a hefty hop profile throughout."
"D - This is definitely a very good DIPA...good strong bitterness, tons of citrusy and fruity hop flavors, nice body. Everything you could look for in a DIPA. I'd have no problem putting down a few of these by the end of the night...just not sure I'll be able to find any more"
"Pours golden with 2 fingers of head. Smells are citrus hops and pine, very nice. Taste is citrus hops up front and a nice bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium/full body with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is insane for a beer of this abv. A very solid beer that I am very happy I had the chance to try."
"D- This is a fantastic beer that I hope they make again. The only thing for me that limits its drinkability is the sweetness toward the end of the beer. I've noticed this with a lot of east coast IPA's as a whole though. Would suggest getting this beer if you can get your paws on it."
"D - This is pretty easy drinking, and the 8.8% is fairly well-hidden. I could probably have a couple cans of this one, but the bitterness does build up. One of the better East Coast DIPAs I've had. Hope they make this one more regularly."
"Medium body, maybe even pushing full. Appropriate carbonation. Plush, rich texture. Absolutely no hint of the 8.8% ABV. Bit of a lasting resinous flavor. Lack of punishing bitterness makes this a very drinkable DIPA."
"All in all, well blended flavors, taste is good, fresh, I was satisfied, one of the top IPAs I have had, I definitely enjoyed it, rivals the big names. Well done. I am glad I have a four pack of pounders."
"D - Need I say more? i think you can pretty much guess what i'll say here.. i went on a crazy tangent... i love this stuff.. i am a little biased, but only on the basis that i love hop bombs and i think this is king on the east coast.."
"D: One of the better DIPA's I've had in a while, and definitely another nice surprise out of New England. Keep 'em coming."
"this beer is over 8 % abv and you can't tell at all. it drinks the same as the sea hag (a regular strength ipa) it's extreme hoppiness masks any booziness that most doubles have....if you can get your hands on some... you must!"
"Gandhi-Bot pours a nice burnt orange color, with a white crown that's small but persistent. It smells incredible, a very nice blend between pine and citrus hops. The taste is a bit of a letdown though, as there's a bit too much generic hop bitterness as opposed to specific hop flavors. The malt is noticeable, but just barely. The beer is adequately carbonated, without being particularly impressive either. I wanted to give drinkability a 3 because of the overly present bitterness to the taste, but NEBC did a great job of hiding the alcohol here so I'll kick it up a little bit. I'm glad I tried it, and both the name and can design are awesome, but there are plenty of IPAs I enjoy more."
"This is a tasty, nicely aromatic imperial IPA. It hides the nearly 9% abv well. It's easy to drink and rather refreshing. Well done."
"F: Bitter! Lots of bittering hops, some pine and citrus lingering as well as some chewy hops and earthy. Little orange peel with a heavy bitterness that just sits in the mouth. It starts to get a little astringent which seems to linger for a while."
"This is truly a special DIPA, and I'm glad I have something like this brewed in my home state. Thanks NEBC!"
"Pours very dark orange. White head starts big but quickly fizzes to pink size, turning to a ring fast as well. A bit soapy looking. Leaves some lacing. Smell is pretty fragrant, lots of earthy hops and pine. Taste is also full of earthy and piny hops, very dank. Some caramel and citrus and warm biscuit in the aftertaste. At first, and take this as you will, it reminds me of Gubna, except much less intense and more drinkable. But some very nice tropical fruit notes seem to take over towards the middle and really gives the taste a huge boost. Nice bitterness too, the 85 IBU's are definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is high and alcohol is very nicely hidden. Overall a very solid DIPA. I loved the cycle of flavors. I like the 16 oz can too, good serving size for this beer."
"Thanks to the staff at Berman's for putting the last four pack they had of this to the side for me. Color is a dark shade of orange, and has a finger of white heading. The hoppy aroma, is somewhat musty, but with some pineapple and pine in there as well. Taste is all of dank, resiny pine like hops. It also feels like much more than 85 IBUs, but I am not going to complain or judge. Mouthfeel is medium, juicy at first, and ends on a bitter earth note. I will have no trouble finishing off the four pack, so drinkability is good for me. Final thoughts are that this is a hop lovers kind if beer. It drinks like a straight up IPA, with the ABV behind it to make it imperial. This, as well as Wachusett Larry are welcome additions to the New England beer world's list of India Pale Ales."
"16oz. can served at 50 degrees in my DT tulip. Poured a semi-translucent burnt orange with a one inch, creamy white head. Head eventually dissipates into a fairly consistent skim of a cap that coalesces around the shoulders. Delicate, concentric rings of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose expresses sweet grapefruit initially, with a hint of medicinal hoppiness at the back - perhaps a toasted quality in the mix as well. Taste reveals a citrus quality, without the sweetness. Some herbal/medicinal hops bitterness comes out right after the start and carries through to the latter half. Toasted quality also carries over from the nose, with the addition of a hint of caramel, before finally culminating in a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with an assertive carbonation that falls just shy of prickly and finishes fairly dry. Ghandi-Bot is an exceptional DIPA with a well-hidden abv. My preference for the style tends to migrate more towards the sweeter end of the spectrum, but this is a solid brew. You won't be disappointed."
"Gandhi-bot is an excellent DIPA. It's in the same league as Pliny and Capt. Lawrence. Get it while you can, and drink it fresh."
"D: I really hope i got a bad can because i had high expectations for this beer and really wanted to like, but it missed the mark for me. This is one i would gladly review again to proof myself wrong, but i did not get the citrus aspect that others seemed to find. For now though, this will have to stand"
"Served from a can into a Sam Adams glass. Orange, slightly hazy color with a thick white head. The scent was powerful; I was able to smell it across the table as I was pouring this beer. Taste was a big hop bomb; nice pine flavor, powerful bitter taste on the first sip. Overall a very nice DIPA; great to see the East Coast putting out some competition to the West Coast super hop brews!"
"D: Very Drinkable for a DIPA. I tend to lean toward the palate killer style of DIPA's. You know, the one(or maybe two) and done types, but I could drink this beer for a while without really getting (palate) tired. Wish I could have purchased more than 2 cans."
"D: Alcohol is non-present. This beer goes down easy - I could drink it all day. It is west coast style indeed, but not over the top """burn your palate after one glass""" style. Two thumbs ups"
"Gandhi-bot is a new kind of spiritual leader, he believes in wholeness. You cannot have peace without war, you cannot find inner harmony without embracing the polar traits which make you human. You cannot be one with anything until you are one with the bitter realities of life. Drink Gandhi-bot, embrace bitterness, learn to live again."
"D: Very drinkable, I wish I was allowed to purchase more than one can!"
"Poured a rich goldenen amber with a nice cap of white pillowy head. This smells delicious and balanced: citrus, mint?, pine, sweet malt with a little bread. The bitterness overwhelms the citrus leaving a strong bitter flavor, though not too resiny. Some of that sweet malt balances the brew but I will have to acclimate to the bitterness before I can proceed. At 8.8%, the alcohol is much better hidden than some other IIPAs but not totally disguised. Wow, I can't shake the bitter! As it warms, some of the citrus and alcohol come out. Overall, a pretty big beer but even for a hophead like me, I think the bittering hops were overdone."
"D: In the end, Gandhi Bot was a nice attempt, but ultimately out hopped itself. The taste was bold but one dimensional and the carbonation levels really slowed this down."
"This is an incredible beer. I am thoroughly enjoying this one, great balance with traditional character one would expect, just done to an extreme and all with no palate abuse."
"D - Very drinkable once you get that first bitter bite down the hatch."
"Would I buy more of it? - if only I could. I bought my allotted 4 cans and am not sure I'll have the chance to get more before the rest are all gone."
"Beer pours a nice glowing orange with a rocky beige head. Smells like a west coast style DIPA. Obviously hoppy up front (Amarillo?) with a slight spicy note. Hops hit your tongue first followed by a pale malt slight sweetness. Nice bitter aftertaste (in a good way). Mouthfeel is rich without being too sticky. For a double IPA, there isn't a ton of booze in the aroma or taste so this one sneaks up on you. I hope this stay's on the NEBCO rotation. Cool artwork on the cans too!"
"Pours out a deep copper color, bordering almost on red, nice clarity, decent sized head, which makes for a nice looking beer. The smell has a nice floral hoppiness. Some resinous fruit is in there too. I get pine and grass, leaves (maybe green tea leaves) and pollen, smells strongly of hop flowers, with some powdery grainy smells. Very nice, I remember breathing it with the glass in front of me and reminding me of smelling blooming flowers. The taste comes out with this dry pine and grass flavor, with a kick of sticky bread in the end. You get tastes of citrus rind, orange peel and lemon juice. Still some leafiness - this to me isn't the fruitiest DIPA, but they don't all have to be. The finish comes back with dryness and leafiness, nice and resinous. The feeling is very nice, sticky and big, but not viscous and syrupy. Really nice in that aspect. The carbonation was lively and enjoyable, made this one easy to drink. The drinkability is good, not too potent, but a nice kick. I wanted a little more (too bad I was splitting it with like 4 people), but really glad to have tried it."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and drink ability is out of control. Great job from Matt and the guys at New England. This one is going to be a big hit once the cans hit the stores."
"Cheers!"
"For an 8.8% DIPA, this is one hell of a drinkable beer. Outstanding."
"Ridiculously tasty."
"have since had it in both growlers and cans and it is a little less of a bitter bomb in the aftertaste, but still super delicious. The cans are particularly good for keeping it fresh. Love the 16oz tallboys.--> the updated rating is from the can version"
