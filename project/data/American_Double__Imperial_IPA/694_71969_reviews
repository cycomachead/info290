"All in all, loved this beer. Gorgeous aromas of citrus and hops. Very narrow taste of noble hops, no citrus. Nice."

""
""
""
""
""
"Very well balanced IPA, tasty and sooth for a 7.5%ABV"
""
""
"Very good IPA. I certainly rate this above some of the Victory beers if had lately. Great flavor and excellent balance."
""

"Easy drinking, near double? IPA. Nothing too strong, hop balanced with mild hops, clean. Nice alchoholy, hop mix smell. Malt presence is minimal, slight lemony, citrus taste. Easy bite fades quickly. Clean and smooth mouthfeel, flavor is good, doesn't linger too long. Liked it, sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"Really smooth to be so strong."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an extremely solid and boldly hopped beer. Cascade hops jump out in the smell and the taste. A light caramel look but overall Troegs did the IPA right with this one!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A well balanced double IPA.  I will drink this again."
""
""
""

"Very light for an IMP IPA. but also very good! Great for those who are just beginning to try imperials."
"Great taste. Great body. Great taste"

"Solid beer.  Not my favorite from Troeggs but a good IPA"
"Cheers!!!"

"Overall: A good ipa overall i wouldn't shy away from this one but didn't knock my socks off. Definately worth a taste"

"O: complex flavors and aroma; very enjoyable;"

""

""
""
"Currently my favorite IPA.  Great balance and not much to complain about."
"Very well-balanced but struck me as more of an APA than IPA.  A good anytime ale, I might even choose this as a session beer."
""
"Very tasty.  Good IPA and the alcohol is hidden well.  Great smell and look forward to having again."
"Pretty solid IPA.  I think this one was a bit old.  Would love to try it fresh."

"Great DIPA from troegs a definate rebuy"

"Solid as a rock... and nothing's changed. But the thrill is still, hot. I'm not sure if this is underrated; quite frankly, I don't care. I enjoy its balance, as much as I enjoy the subdued citra hops on the finish. Not overly bitter, despite the abv. There's an intelligent balance on this one for sure. I'm glad that it's now readily accessible in my area."
""
"IPA.. I get why people like them, but they are just not for me."
"Troegs Perpetual is an Imperial Pale Ale with an amazing nose, great citra hop finish."
""
""
""
""
"A medium body beer, not as dry as some other hoppy IPAs,.  The finish was the same as the start, very enjoyable"
""
"This is an odd beer to evaluate. Tons of new-ish, bright, forward hop aromas; but a massively bitter old-ish DIPA taste. It's good, but the extreme amount of sting is a major downgrade, as it makes it nearly impossible to really appreciate the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Little foam. Amber, yellow. Little smell. Super dank!"
""
""
"Overall- Not mind blowing but very solid and done right. I still think this tends to be a regular American IPA vs a true double in looks and taste. But still a good hoppy brew."
"very solid everyday IPA...   another draft that if it was around that i would be all over"

"Just got a fresh batch - bottled 12/14/14. Extremely pleasing IPA. Highest marks for this offering all across the board. When in doubt, grab a pack of these, can't go wrong."
"Love it in cans & feel silly I just now realized it's an Imperial pale ale"
""

""

""
""
"Overall it had a great feel, taste and appearance. Troegs continues to impress."
"Pours clear golden with little head, smells citrusy with roasted maltiness, tastes citrusy with malt undertones, smooth mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"This was a very acceptable IPA, not the best I've ever had, but definitely fitting for the style.  It has good head retention and lacing that lasts throughout.  The taste is fairly mild, with a bitter aftertaste that does not interfere with the enjoyment of the moment.  Overall, a satisfying, if not stellar, brew."
""
""
""
""
"Solid IPA with easy drink ability."
""
"Not as hoppy as I'd expected. Drinks easy enough for an imperial ipa, but didn't satisfy my hop craving. More malty. More like a heavier hopped strong ale."
""
"O.  An OK beer.  I myself like more hip character and I just get a little pine.  More malts which aren't bad but not great.  Mouthfeel is average.  Probably wouldn't buy again with all the IPA options but definitely not a bad beer.  Worth a try."
""
""
"A bold American IPA that deceives one to be assertive and still showing some ties to its origins, to later show its citrus soul with tropical nuances in the background. Drink it slowly and you will see. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Troegs.  Dank, really really dank.  Not my thing.  But well crafted.  If you like a dank ipa here you go."
""
""
"ANOTHER """Solid""" product from Troegs Brewery!"
""
""
""
"Growler fills on a regular basis."
""

"Decent beer. Not the IPA I was expecting"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass.  Crystal clear medium gold color.  Half inch head which dissipated.  Enough carbonation to maintain a light head throughout.  Nice light lacing.  Aroma is a nice balanced slightly earthy hop note but not overpowering.  Taste follows the nose with an exceptionally nice balance of hops and malt.  The finish is a hair sweet but then the bitterness comes through and lingers on the tongue, but not objectionable at all.  This is a very well balanced beer for those who are new to IPAs.  This is always in my standard rotation.  Very nice."
"I love the smell of this beer.  The citrus note is not too powerful, yet it adds so much...love this stuff!!!"

"Whoa ... hops on steroids!  Enough said ... and from a person who a year ago wouldn't drink an IPA."

"A clear crisp beer in the very good (but not great) catagory."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, yellow-gold coloring, with a filmy, clingy, bright white head. Aromas of subtle toasted grains, hints of caramel, floral and herbal spice highlights, and a blend of citrus and tropical fruit notes. A bit less nose than I was expecting. Flavors are citrus and tropical fruit forward, with a char undertone. Pineapple, mango, and apricot blend nicely with grapefruit and lemon zest. Cut grass, pepper spice, evergreen, and pitch notes from the hops provide a good balancing bitterness and dank feel. The body is smooth and light, with a fruit cocktail aftertaste. The finish has a tangy sweet cloy balanced by a solid resinous bitter note. Decent linger on a pretty tasty brew."

"Update of previous ranking. Drinking out of can this time, like I tried in past. The can and draft much better then bottle. This is back as one of my must buy 6 packs!!"

"O: [3.25]The nose and the appearance were pretty promising after that it kind of fell down.  I guess I will try another one, in the future, if I find it fresh.  The alcohol is well hidden - so that is a plus.  This is a """C"" beer."

"BOD 8/19/14.  Clear golden pour with a normal head.  Excellent lacing, normal retention.  Nose of tropical and citrus hops, with some pine in the background, over a light biscuit.  Light medium body with a nice slick texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a nice bit of effervescence on the finish.  The excellent flavor profile is complex and a masterpiece of balance. It begins with a balanced blend of hop flavors that flow into a moderate bitterness, that has a spicy note, over a slightly sweet biscuit background.  The middle is where the flavor components fade with the alcohol completely hidden.  The finish effervesces nicely and leaves you with a nice slightly spicy pine bitterness that flows into grapefruit rind.  Outstanding!!"

"Unassuming golden color and standard 1""" head are not foreshadowing what you are about to taste.  Sorry, the head has already disappeared.....  Pleasant mouthfeel with creamy and adequate levels of carbonation are there, which is a must for me.  Some complex flavors bouncing back between citrusy and piney hops continue to develop.  Initial swallows had extended moments of 'sweetness' randomly timed in my mouth.  I'm still waiting to figure out if ragweed and goldenrod are ruining the my nose or it's nose....as there doesn't appear to be anything of importance developing.  That said, it is an awesome Imperial, while not much to be said of the malt, and everything to be thanked for the layers of hop flavor."

"O: the fermentation characteristics from the yeast seem to come through more so than the lion's share of IPAs querfed in my time... the hops flow in a low-voltage electric current - bitter, stingy, and citrusy - so it doesn't knock you over the head - provided you eat well, you could easily knock back 3-4 of these over an evening hanging outside or at a bar, watching the game of the hour"

"This is an IPA for those who don't mind hoppy beers, but also want a little smoother hop taste. Give it a shot. The only thing I like that is hoppier is Hop Stoopid from Lagunitas. Either way, drink good stuff."

"This is my favorite beer that is not distributed in Texas. I feel that most complaints on here about this beer is that people are reviewing it as a double IPA. I don't believe this beer is. The label simply refers to it as an """Imperial Pale Ale""" and while visiting the brewery they did not refer to it as a double IPA. As such, if you take it as a regular IPA then this beer is incredible and full of resin hop flavor. The light color appearance may surprise some but I don't see it as an issue. During my tour at the Troegs Brewery I got to sample this straight from the fermentor and it was fantastic. This is the single beer I look forward to the most when I visit Pennsylvania."

"Pours crystal clear and very pale gold with medium to small head. Nice lacing. Smell is big lemon and grapefruit citrus hops. Taste is much the same as the smell up front and through the finish. Very rarely have I had a beer so consistent from the smell through the finish. And in this case it's consistently citrus hops. Actually though it ends up being a bit one-note, even if that note is good. Full bodied. Fairly drinkable and a really solid IPA throughout."

"I like how this one is put together. My first beer from this venerable brewer & I look forward to having more."

"O: It's just like a more lightly malted Nugget Nectar. At times when I drink it, I don't think it's the same beer as I remembered; but after a few more sips, I go """this is EXACTLY what I remembered it to be""". I really wish the aroma had more punch, however. But who cares? This is one of those beers where one isn't enough."

"Smells of orange zest, tangerine. Beautiful hazy gold color, lots of lace. Tastes light and fresh and crisp and citrusy, really quite an accomplishment to make a 7.5% beer easy drinking. May not be that super skunky IPA you drive hours to get just to stand in line for a few more hours, but it’s one I’ll buy any time I see it. Perfect summer beer."

"The Troegs DIPA is similar to most big IPAs that are trying to have 1000 IBUs....very malty with bitter hops. The beer poured a nice copper with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is mostly bittering hops. The taste is bolstered by big malt that is slightly sweet....to balance the beer there is bitter hops with not much pine or citrus. The mouthfeel is full in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a good DIPA for those that like it bitter....for those that want pine and citrus will be dissappointed with this one."
"O: Like I said in the beginning of the review, totally amazed by this new batch of Perpetual. Leaves me wondering if they have changed the recipe. Classic IPA that may become world class if every batch is this amazing."
""
"O: Not something I would go out of my way to get ahold of, but if I saw it on the shelf, I might grab one. Certainly wouldn't kick it out of bed. :-)"
""
""
"not bad, in fact it has some super moments (look and feel) but overall the way the hop signature is built just does not work for me, which is strange considering how friggin bonkers I am over Nugget Nectar"
""
"O: Well balanced. It's crisp and refreshing qualities make it a good brew for a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability - High! If it's between Jai Alai and Perpetual, I gotta go with Perpetual; $1 less per 6'er, and from Tröegs. You can't beat it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - At first I was worried with the aroma of the beer but the Taste and Mouthfeel really make this beer come alive and become a great drinking enjoyable IPA. The mouthfeel definitely stands out on this and leaves a lot of other ipa's wanting in this department. Wonder what this would have tasted like when fresh. If you like the way your beer feels in you mouth and you like IPA this one is a must have, Cheers!"
""
""
""
"This isn't bad. The beginning is great, but then there is that awkward moment of almost nothingness as the citrus rind bitterness swells. I like the beginning a lot, but then it's only so-so for me."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall this is a really nice beer, good and solid, but nothing magnificent. This beer doesn't blow me away, but could definitely be a classic example of the style."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: very light and dry"
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice color. A golden amber appearance. Good hoppy and fruity smell. Smells delicious. Also can taste the fruit right off the bat. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be. Has a little bitterness to it. Doesn't last that long. In my opinion, its a great IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden and crystal clear..personally I like it a little murky. Aroma is mild citrus and a teeny bit dank. Taste reinforces the smell. I find this beer underwhelming. The bottle is just under a month old too. Probably a good intro ipa. I will not be picking this one up again. Now nugget nectar on the other hand...."
""
"Overall: Not quite there as far as DIPA's go in my opinion. If this were labeled as a IPA, I may have given this a higher score. However, it's still tasty and I'll be grabbing for more from time to time."
""
"Continue to be blown away from Troeg's, how did it take me so long to discover this east coast gem!? Perpetual may be almost on far with the Nugget. Drank three last night was was throughly impressed I can't get enough of those high ABV's with maximum drinkability. Hope my old faithful keeps a constant supply of this stuff coming!"
""
""
""
""

"What a pleasant IPA from Tröegs, I really like the dry hop effect on this beer. Super drinkable with a well hidden 7.5% ABV. I would gladly have another."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Troegs rarely disappoints. Perpetual IPA , I think, is towards the top of the list of great Troegs brews. Well-balanced, fresh flavors combined with a wonderful mouth feel made for an easy-drinking, satisfying IPA that can be enjoyed on a night out or a night in. I'd have no second thoughts about recommending this."

"o - Very, Very good offering from Troegs"
""
""
""

"This ale pours a hazy orange color with very little head but decent lacing. The aroma is rather muted. The aroma is malty with minimal hop notes and a distinctive alcohol bite. I get the feeling as though this dipa is probably past its prime. The mouth is smooth and easy to sip. A little thick but in a good sticky way. The taste is better than I expected given the aroma. It is malty but with a nice hoppy bitterness. There is a definite bite of alcohol on the tail but it is pleasant. You can tell that this ale has seen better days but it is still a solid offering. Would love to try one of these fresher if troegs ever comes to Michigan."
""
""
"Pours to a nice, full foam, off white in color, with good retention and lacing. Golden amber color and clear. Aroma was hoppy with floral and citrus notes. Nice taste, good hop notes with some grassy, floral and citrus touches. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a lightly bitter aftertaste."

"O-very much a fan of thus IPA. Been a while since I've had a new, kickass IPA. This is outside the box, not a hop bomb. Love this."
"Bottle in trade. This one has about 2 months of age. Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a creamy white nearly one finger head. Bright hop aromas with citrus, lemon, grapefruit, definite sweet caramel malt backbone to the smell and the aroma has held up well for the 2 month age. Flavor is sweet malts, straw, grapefruit, honey, grass. Mouthfeel is very slick, medium, with medium carbonation. As with other Troegs beers I have had, this has a slightly syrupy feel to it. Overall a very nice IPA that I would drink again."

"This is a go-to IPA (toeing the line of DIPA) for me. Not necessarily the best I've had but always rock solid, like most of Troeg's offerings. And unlike some beers, I think I like it more every time I have it."

"I had this before from the bottle, but received a can from the legendary woodychandler, and found it to be better. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is full of hops, citrus. Taste is lots of hops, tropical fruits, touch of malts, tasty and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"The Crack! was nice and loud and the inverted Glug got me off and running. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning, opening a long-desired present to begin playing with it. I have become masterful at this practice and the pour was picture-perfect, resulting in two dense fingers of French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention. A brief pseudo-cascade resulted, finalizing in a beautifully clear golden-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7) and rather than fighting, Mammon, Croesus and Midas defaulted to yours truly, clapping as I took my first sip. I leaned in for a sniff first, taking in a tropical pungency of mango, tangerine, papaya and grapefruit. My mouth was watering and the hops monkey on my back also made a sudden appearance! I began to feel as though something historical was going to happen when I hit the """review""" button, but then my homeboy, nick """the tick""" D717 chimed in, reminding me that it would only be hysterical, as usual. I tied off, raised a toast to nickD717, and hit paydirt. Man, it came on like an Acela train between stations, high-flying and stopping for nothing and no one. The mouthfeel was medium, but who cares? I was gettin' my hops fix, baby! It had a tropical fruitiness underlain by a grapefruit bitterness and the monkey began to settle down. I looked down and ... Jumpin' Jehosephat! I had already CANsumed half of the beer in my glass. It may have been excitement, but I would rate the Drinkability high on this one, if such a designation still existed on this site. Finish was dry and biting and when I listened closely, I could hear the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara Desert. Phew! This may not make an ideal outdoor beer at 7.5% ABV, but in that case, I want to put Sunshine Pils on my CAN Want List prior to the summer."

"Overall: A very nice IPA. Definitely paler than most, which is refreshing. Not as hoppy flavor-wise as I would have hoped, although that may be due to the four months since bottling date."

"This is a really good, unusual dIPA. It's more like an IPA, maybe. Honestly, it seems almost like a Pale Ale. The smell has a biscuity sense to it which was different, but quite enjoyable. It has a carbonated and dry mouthfeel, and the taste is mainly of pine and citrus. I would probably get this again. Very enjoyable and drinkable."

"This is always my go to beer. Imo this is what an IPA should be. I love hoppy beers and this is one of them. Troegs isnt far away so very easy to find this stuff one or two weeks old. smells hoppy, tastes hoppy, and very easy drinking. At 35$ a case its also very affordable. If you love that teeth eating hop flavor, this is a must try."

""
""
""

"This is a pretty straightforward, solid interpretation of the style.  The finish kind if fades just a but quick, but that's close to my only complaint.  I think this would be a good IPA for those considering IPAs before jumping straight to west coast hop bombs."

"A tasty, flavorful IPA."

"Overall this is a very drinkable Double IPA. Glad i had the opportunity to try this, definitely would recommend if you see it."

"So, with a few months on it, it has muted some...the middle-roasted malts are shining and the hops are now an earthy, musty grapefruit. Strangely reminds me of a Dirtwolf with some age on it, the earthy hops shine more than the strong grapefruit it once had."
""
"...The frozen glass neutralizes the weakly fragrant hop that would otherwise be evident in a warm, room temperature pint glass....Incidentally, that was coincident in time for another sip. These guys are genius but be careful, easy drinking heavy hitter, at 7.5%abv."
""
""
"Perpetual IPA's balance is all about the standard IPA profile. There's no added sweetness that """imperial""" versions display. Nor does the alcohol compounds become a part of the flavor profile. Its utmost dryness and focus on hop dominance makes this an irresistable yet fortified dream for hop lovers. Now if I could just keep it going..."

"Had this at Yard House in Dedham - chose it from the 150 other beers to choose from. Looking for an IPA that would allow me to walk out on my own. Always enjoy Troegs and this was very good. Poured a nice golden copper color, with small lacing and decent carbonation throughout. This wasn't an overly hoppy beer, but I enjoyed the citrus and fruit hints. This was a nice blend of malt and hops. In fact, I ordered not one, but three of these. And I still was not slurring my words. At least this is my recollection. Very good beer"
""
""
""
""
"Well made IPA… golden color and full head with good lacing. I prefer a balance and drinkability, and do enjoy a serious hop kick, but am not an extreme IPA freak. This beer has nice citrus/fresh hop aroma and a very slight malt/breadiness on the nose. I’m not getting much malt backbone even though it’s a 7%+ brew, but it has a very classic hop profile. I enjoy Troegs beers and their Perpetual IPA is pretty solid, but it seems a bit reserved for what I was expecting."

"Poured a golden body with two finger head and good lace patches down glass. Smooth, easy to drink, for some reason I don't get much except a large dose of citric hops with a touch of breadiness that makes the mouthfeel somewhat filling. Not much else in terms of hop flavors like grapefruit and for some reason I really don't get any sweet malt notes. Maybe my draft was served too cold (it was definitely not at the recommended 45/50ish range) b/c I seemed to have had a muted experience compared to other reviewers. Still enjoyed this beer as the hoppiness wasn't overpowering or bitter."

"Yum! I've wanted to try this beer for a while, though that doesn't mean I necessarily had crazy expectations for it or anything. It was actually a bit better than I thought it would be, and what's even better is that it's a year-round brew. A very nice brew for the dank-heads out there who need to get their hop oil fix but don't feel like taking alpha acids straight to the vein. Very nice IPA, enjoyable from start to finish."
""
""
"Overall, a very pleasant IPA, suitable for daily consumption. Not quite as tropical and hop-forward as Torpedo and lighter than Victory Hop Devil, but comparable to Lagunitas IPA with slightly better flavor profile. Balance would likely lean a bit more toward bitterness in a fresher bottle, but this was close to well-balanced (could use a bit more bitters). Would be excellent as a part of a mixed 12. Will buy more."
" I'm wondering why my review does not jibe with most others here. The label is dated 2012, which may or may not relate to bottling date. But age usually mutes hops. not accentuate them. Puzzling."
"Very interesting IPA that brings a nice bitterness on the back end, even more so than most regular IPAs. It could be a DIPA for all I know. Showcases the hops well, a rather balanced IPA. Great local, not super outstanding but definitely an above-average IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Another amazingly good hoppy American ale from Troegs. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful copper color with a 1 inch foam head. Both the aroma and taste are of delicious tropical tasting hops with a good malt backbone. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. When fresh, this is one of the very best imperial IPA's out there. Cheers!"

"Overall, this is an excellent IPA. Brewery only an hour or so away, so likely very fresh. Great summertime IPA. Definitely recoommended."

"Date tasted: July 26, 2013 ... Glassware: Maudite snifter... Occasion: more camp IPA talk leads to another IPA... Appearance: hazy peach-orange body with a creamsicle-inspiring white head that laces diligently and thins attractively... Aroma: powerful citrus flavors--peach/grapefruit one-two punch with bright hops uplifting the scent... Palate: mouth-expanding, pine cone missile-sized presence makes this a worthwhile sip, while the alcohol is comfortably tucked away...Taste: shockingly mellow, deliciously balanced; more sour than sweet, with the puckering nature being fully realized late in the glass...Overall: Came as a gift from brother Jer and the golf weekend (nice!), as well as a high recommendation from Mount Pocono Beverage's associate...two beers later, and I am still aftertasting the pleasure of this beer's hops cascade; tremendously drinkable at 7.5% ABV, with the """I'm Superman""" vibe in effect after the beer is finished; another fine IPA that can fairly be in the discussion of the genre's top 25..."

"I feel like my rating is a bit dull, but this is just a really solid DIPA. Not mind blowing, but still really quality."

"O - Pretty damn tasty IPA. Very grapefruit heavy with some nice pine and grassiness. Troeg's has crafted yet another winner."
""
""
"Overall, this is a really nice beer. Hop-forward but not overly so."
""
""
"Great summer IPA. Nice clear pale yellow to straw in color, with white head that dissipated rather quickly. Smell is a bit lacking. Faintly watery, the hops smells good, but not quite as present as I'd like. Taste is wonderful though. What this beer lacks in aroma, it quickly makes up for in taste. Superbly grassy and a wonderful floral hoppiness to it. I get some apricot and a sweetness that I can only describe as when you chew on Dallisgrass on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A confusing DIPA, to say the very least, but at least it's not difficult to drink or anything. It's so creamy it's almost like air! The honey/butterscotch combo, while not exceptional, is quite nice, but all of the hoppy aspects faded out somehow. Nothing feels muted or old... Only bland. Bizarre. I suppose it would do okay on a warm day, but I'd rather take a kölsch or pilsner at that point, as it has less ABV and a far more grassy/fruity texture than this."

"O: I thought when I was drinking this it was an American IPA. Then I see it listed on here as an IIPA. After closer examination of the bottle, I see it indicated as an """Imperial Pale Ale""". I have no idea what that's supposed to be, but this sure didn't drink like an IIPA. It's an adequate IPA, nothing particular to complain about. It just doesn't quite hit the right notes in aroma and flavor."
""
"Pours a golden amber with a medium off white head slowly dissipating to a razor thin lasting through out with moderate lacing. Aroma of floral citrus hops, grapefruit, caramel malt, yeast and fruity notes. Taste same as aroma with some flavorful tangy grapefruit notes. A medium body on the palate, good carbonation with a smooth sweet bitter tangy mouth feel. Finished with sweet caramel malt, yeast fruity balanced by some floral citrus hops with a slightly tangy grapefruit ending. Overall a very good, flavorful and solid IPA."

""
""
""

""
""
"Overall a really nice change of pace from the super malty or super hoppy DIPAs I've had. Extremely well-balanced and complex. No flavor has been sacrificed. Just goes to show you that Troegs makes fantastic beer. Period"
"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a beer that is never fizzy, but manages to be quite soft and foamy as it moves across the palate. Closes quite dry, with low stickiness remaining on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although it's not amazing, I can always come back to this hopjuice for reliable drinking. I always want more length and depth every time I return...but I do return."
"Earthy, fairly hoppy, and perhaps not bitter enough for the style. It's a little hot. Hops are more dominant and complex in the aroma than the flavor, though."

"Another bulls-eye for troegs. Similar to the pale ale just a bit hoppier. Pours a straw blonde color, with a nice craggy head and lots of lacing. Scents of grassy pine needles on the nose. Very clean, sharp, spicy taste. Don't know how troegs does this, but the beer is hoppy, yet washes away clean and clear with no aftertaste. Great session beer, though a bit strong. Loved it!"

"Pours honey gold with perfect clarity and a frothy head of foam that stuck to the glass like cotton candy. Beautiful effervescence streaming up the middle of the glass. This one’s lovely to look at. Nose is peachy, tropical & floral. Has a little dank which I love and the malt is peeking out with some biscuit and honey. Taste is near perfection with no alcohol, some hop bitter and light malt to greet the palate. Light, clean but it falls short of crisp. The hops come up catty and earthy and the malt is fat with cracker and bread. Finishes bitter and a touch of grain. Of all the Troegs I have had this one is the least impressive. Troegs has it’s own brews to compete with and this one is good, it’s even better than good but it lacked nerve."
""
""
"Overall I would say that this is exceptional as it has all of what this style needs and more in the way of hops. It's a little more bitter than the favourites of mine, but still exceptional and would drink this again and recommend it to other IPA fans! 4 out of 5!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured into snifter. Clear golden yellow/orange with a thin white head even from a vigorous pour. Sits as a tight disc of foam for a while. Lots of delicate lacing as it's drunk. Smells of strong piney hops with some citrus fruits in the background. Taste is crisp, with tons of resinous and bitter hops up front with some fruit notes in the background. Fruit smells increase as it warms. Sweet malts try and make a play, but the hops beat them into submission. Mouthfeel is medium and pretty smooth for a DIPA, nicely done."

""
""
"Moderate body, but easy-drinking. Good carbonation. Big citrus-forward hops make up the bulk of this beer. Mango, grapefruit, navel orange. A great bitter snap that fleets away quickly, causing me to gulp this one down. No lingering bitterness. Sweet kiss of sugar on the finish. This is a splendid beer. So glad I had more than 1 bottle at my disposal. Would love to get some more of this."

"Troegs markets this beer as an “imperial pale ale,” but that’s not really a real style, and anyone who has quaffed this hoppy delight instantly recognizes all of the hallmarks of what tastes surprisingly closer to a hopped-up west coast-style IPA than the more balanced, maltier IPAs typically favored by east coast brewers. Perpetual boasts six different hop varieties — boiled with Bravo, Chinook and Mt. Hood; hopped back with Mt. Hood and Nugget; and dry-hopped with Citra and Cascade — and the Citra and Cascade dry-hop is the dead giveaway for why Perpetual exudes a delightfully citric west coast-style aroma and flavor profile. As an unapologetic hop head and New Yorker, I tend to scoff at certain east coast takes on my favorite style, but Perpetual is an IPA the northeast can be proud of."

"Overall: One of the best imperial IPAs I’ve tasted this year. Very crisp and clean. Prost Troegs, you’ve outdone yourselves again! I can’t wait to find this beer again. Enough complexity to entertain hardcore hop heads to the newest of hops."
""
""
""
"Not quite as unified a brew as the best. ** 3rd time, also a knockout with Squash soup with garden carrots and mozzarella. *** Must try."
""
""
"Overall- Everything about this brew is light, crisp, and clean; but it's got just enough heft in the right areas to let you know it's not messing around and more than enough complexity and interesting fruit flavor to spice things up. And that's a good four months after the bottling date. Very nicely done."
"This was a shot in the dark for me, being as I'm not to impressed with the troegs product line. It pours a lighter than expected golden straw color with a small off white head. This beer looks, smells, tastes, and feels like a IPA. I think they use the term imperial loosely. For what it is, it's not a bad beer. It's just a in between beer, probably won't stop by agin."

"Overall - Solid DIPA, thoroughly enjoyed. While the malt was pretty much nowhere to be seen, I was not disappointed and I did not find myself looking for it. Great brew."
" Taste starts with grapefruit, floral, bread, and pale malt. Ends with piney resin and a bit of funk. Has a crisp but very dry finish. Slightly creamy, lighter moutfeel for an IIPA with moderate-heavy carbonation. I like the balance of flavor in this one, lighter and more drinkable than some other IIPA's."
""
""
""
"o: a fine and tasty ipa, if a bit unremarkable and lost in the crowd of solid ipas out there these days, not sure the """imperial pale""" name is much more than marketing - this fits in with the typical low-moderate malt, high hop ipa"
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Mad Mex keep the pint promo. Nice carbonation. Served with little head but it could be the bar's glass - who really knows. Smells of a citrus, grapefruit bomb. Tastes great. Nice & bitter, dry. Little bit of crystal to back up the hops. Excellent and well done. Could drink a lot of these through and through. Glad to have another solid, high-quality IPA here in PA."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the hefty side of medium, slightly resinous, carbonation about perfect, and the long yeasty pink grapefruit aftertaste stays with you for a while. If you like your Double IPA on the sweet side, this might not be your bag, but if you enjoy a bitter grapefruit bomb that is well balanced and inviting, this is a nice choice."

It's a good hoppy ipa. Mouthfeel is nice, well carbonated, a reasonable amount of body... It's a solid, really tasty ipa; won't knock you over, but highly drinkable and tasty!"

"O: Great beer. This was made for those summer months. It's very refreshing and smooth @ 7.5% ABV. Bitterness does not linger on the aftertaste. The citrus is so mouthwatering. Another beer I could see myself drinking on a regular basis for sure."

"This is a sneaky good beer. Bright clear honey gold amber. Light, fluffy head that stays a while and leaves a bit of a covering. Good lacing and no carbonation evident as it sits. Smell is a good combination of toasted malt, light fruit esters, and firm hop presence. Some grassy notes and a bit of toffee tinged sweetness. Taste is where the money is made. Wonderfully balanced while still presenting a hop forward persona. Front starts with toasted malt, quickly leads to a gentle but mildly tongue scraping hop extravaganza. Subtle combination of pine and grapefruit with a good hop oily flavor. No trace of the alchohol. Feel is surprisingly light for a a beer of this strength. Smooth easy carbonation with a lightly creamy but crisp feel. A super drinkable ale that goes down like a pale ale. of lower abv."
"O- loved the nose on this beer was a little let down by the taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is similar to the aroma in the way it is played down but the sharp, hop bite definitely forces itself forward at first. There are also some laid back malts. It fits the style well but there is nothing out of the ordinary about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Floral, spicy hops- very unique IPA. Bubblegum and wheat notes- very delicate and almost German in some ways. Well balanced by a delicate malt profile but lingering bitterness. Another solid offering from Troegs"
""
"O: maybe not in the top 5 ipa's, but a very treasury and respectable brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer but nothing to distinguish it in a crowded category. The mouthfeel is really nice, but combined with the sweetness, it really hurts drinkability. But then one doesn't expect to make a session of a beer of this style..."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer was a fun - an absolute delight. Just can't think of a way to improve this brew, but then I have have too admit a bias toward hoppy IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty chewy biscuit up front quickly fades to sweet tangerine which is almost immediately lost to bitter grapefruit. A roller coaster of delight for the taste buds. Finish is dry with a bitter herb punch. A delightful IPA that is exciting and delicious."
""
""
"Taste has a nice sharp honeyed malt up front with an equal 1-2 punch of hop flavor and bitterness....kinda floral with a hint of pine resin and grapefruit peel. More tropical-esque flavors come out as it warms but the beer stays well balanced (hop flavor/bitter) and smooth. Good offering from Troegs, but probably falls in the B-list class of IPAs overall."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not my favorite style, but this is a solid beer though nothing extraordinary. I prefer more complex hop flavors with less bitterness and more sweetness, so this one didn't deliver in that sense. Still fairly enjoyable and not offensively bitter like some IPAs I've had."

""
"Pours a deep orange color with a solid 1-2 finger head at the outset. Some lacing on the sides of the glass. Head excites fairly easy with a bit of a swirl. Aroma is definite hops - floral and pine are the dominant characteristics. Taste is hop bitterness up front through the finish - same hops as via the nose - good flavor but for a DIPA not the most hop forward."

"Brilliantly clear yellow-gold topped by a good inch of sticky, frothy head. Big, festively hoppy aromas...fruit candy, leafy spice, grapefruit, and some pine and floral notes. The pine steps in up in the mouth along with an equal amount of grapefruit and tangerine. Green and almost peppery and fairly bitter too which covers most of the sweetness trying to come through. A wee bit of caramel lingers, but doesn't interfere with the hops. A little dry in the finish and quite drinkable. A very nice, fresh, and punchy IPA."
"O: I don't hate this beer, as i usually hate most commercial IPAs, but I certainly won't be chosing it off the shelf."
""
"A satisfying IPA, but certainly not great. I would recommend it as a try."

"Overall: It's kind of like their Hopback Amber Ale, but hoppier. It doesn't do much to distinguish itself besides its interesting """pine-y""" character. Definitely still a """good""" beer though."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: Its good but not great; I don't think the heart of this beer was to be a huge DIPA, but even as a singe IPA it seems a bit delicate around the edges. Would prefer more upfront hop flavors and aromas. Bitterness is spot on."
""
"O - As said before, a solid IPA. Troegs is a great brewery and this IPA is not a letdown by any means. I will definitely revisit this beer in the very near future."
""

"This is a nice IPA, but a bit delicate on my palate. All the right flavors are there but they just aren't as forward as I would have preferred. This is definitely a good beer, but there are better."

"this was a let down for me a little bit. just found it to be a little weak and lackluster. the pour was a really clear light golden color, with a small but lacey white head with reasonable retention. the nose exudes bitter hops, but they seem stale or distant or something, and the malt profile is very light for a big ipa. flavor was fine, but not inspiring, light euro malt profile, with bitter hops starting in the middle and riding on through the finish and then some. some light fruity notes, but i found it all to be a little overwhelmed by the alcohol, which was rather brisk and forward for a beer not even 8% abv. not a bad ipa at all, but certainly not one in the top 10 percent. it was all up pretty average in my book, nothing to distinguish it at all form the masses. i know troegs can do more."

"Update: Per my friend Terry, he messaged Troegs on Facebook only to find out from them that Hurricane Sandy messed up this batch of beer and made it too yeasty. Not only were they willing to acknowledge their mistake, but they told him to bring the case to the brewery to rectify the problem with an exchange. He made out fine on the deal by getting a fresh one. I only bought to bottles, so I chugged them instead."
"This is not your typical IPA. Very floral in a gentle sort of way. The spices from hops are an accent, and not the main feature. Citrus tones are also there as a very mild background feature. This is nice. Easy to drink and refreshing. If it were't 45 degrees outside and it was a blistering hot day outside, I think I'd enjoy this even more."

"New offering from Troegs, pours a light golden color, nice head to it. Great hoppy aroma. Taste is light to medium bodied, great mouthfeel. Nice crispness and balance to this one, a hop bomb for sure but also has a nice 'wet' finish and doesn't have the typical bitter dryness most IPAs have. Finishes clean and smooth. A very good IPA and is un the upper echelon of this style that is widely available out there. Highly recommended, will be getting a few more 6 packs of this while I can."

"Taste, rampant bitterness, you can definitely tell some high alpha acid hops were used, and not a lot of malt (from both the color of the beer, as well as the massive bitterness, lack of caramel, body etc. . . ). Unfortunately, they impart virtually nil in terms of mouthfeel of the hop. Carbonation is high, alcohol is mildly stinging like an antiseptic. The bitterness just doesn't have any flavor to it, nothing in terms of pine, tropical or citrus fruit. Its kind of bland. Reminiscient of double take ipa, all bitterness, no substance. I'd try it again based on the fact that I know Troeg's is much better than this in every other effort I've had from them."
"Great Imperial IPA. Was very please to add it to the mix. Impressive array of hops used in the multiple stages of brewing. Great burst up front and plenty of hop on the back end. Definitely a choice for hop heads. Dem Hershey boys are doin' it again!!!"
""
"This is a good example of a crisp, refreshing double IPA. Drinkable, tasty and totally """sessionable", amiright?"

"This is a great go-to beer for bang-for-the-buck. It's not the cleanest, nor most flavorful or bitter IPA, but given the availability and potency, it's worth every penny. I go back to this brew frequently."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours a translucent dark straw with a slight red tint with a very froffy white head. Beer has a very inviting aroma, with its floral, citrus, and piney notes that you can smell right when you are pouring it. Tastes of very sweet piney and fruity hops, and a little bit of malt. Beer is perfectly carbonated and goes down smooth for its light/medium body. Overall, a superb beer."
"Good, solid IPA that hits all the appropriate notes & turns in a performance that's worthy of a Zoscar nomination (though not the tin trophy). Very good IPA."
"pour is a clear golden amber with a tight light tan head. Nose is balanced, caramel malt and a faint bready note. Strong citrus in back. Flavor is more hop forward but still has a nice malt backbone. Caramel is light as well as a doughier bread. Hops are aggressive, citrus with a touch of citric acid. Light lingering bitterness and strong carbonation. Faint grain in the body with a fairly dry finish."

"A nice enough beer, but there are a lot of good IPA's on the market these days, and so I'm not sure I can imagine ordering this again any time soon."
"O: Packs a punch, full of flavor and very drinkable. Good stuff from the Troegs Bros. and good to see this one year round. Priced 10.99 a sixer."
"Poured from bottle into perfect pint glass. Date says 09/27/2012, so just over a week on it. Three finger white head, thick and frothy, plenty of lacing. Light golden orange color looks great. Smell is very interesting, with a combination of citrus hops and a grassy natural aroma which reminds me somewhat of Founders All Day IPA. The main difference here is more pine (and higher ABV), even though it's subtle overall. There is also a hint of sweetness which comes through somewhere in the middle. Taste is unique, too, blending elements of aroma with more emphasis on light citrus flavors, very soft lemon, grapefruit, and pine also subtly present. Mouthfeel is average, carbonation noticeable, less smooth than I generally prefer. Overall, this would be a fantastic session IPA, but for the 7.5 ABV. Nonetheless, I really like it, seems like a nice beer to have around. Cheers."

"Picked this up at DecCicco's in Brewster, NY. An amazingly clear yellow amber color with a very solid white head that deflates to a full but thin cover and a robust web of lacing. The aroma brings a mild citrus bread straw grass deal. A bit too mild to me but not unpleasant. The flavor brings a somewhat harsh grass hop with a nice grainy caramel bread. There’s a hint of alcohol but the grassy grain bite is the dominant theme. It offers a very liquid medium body that feels a bit glassy with very adequate carbonation. I detected a vague sulphur that wasn’t a bad thing. Toasted grains and lots of tongue grabbing hop bitterness. I like it plenty! Refreshing and a palate pleaser."

"O: This IPA is packed with hop aromas and flavors but is rather well balanced and quite easy to drink. No traces of alcohol are perceptible in the taste."
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a nice balance of dry, earthy bitterness and sweet tropical/citrus fruit notes.  Dry grassy pine  notes followed by a strong tropical and citrus fruit presence.  Lots of pineapple, grapefruit and lemon peel flavor countered by a pale malt backbone.  Really well balanced and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite a unique and tasty brew. I think the imperial pale ale label is important because though this has some big hops it felt different than many IPAs. Worth a 6-pack purchase."
"One of the better potent IPAs I've had. Seductive and sadistic."

"O - A very flavorful and pleasant IPA (bordering on a double). At this price point (less than $2 a bottle), this could easily become a go-to IPA for me. Great balance and high drinkability."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the strength of both aroma and flavoring. For the style they were both robust, immediately putting this guy above many of its competitors. What put it over the top was the boozy warming quality. While it is easy for the alcohol to get out of control and overwhelm the palate, here we found it to be beautifully complimentary, and nicely unexpected for such a hoppy beer."
""
""
"Overall, a really good beer that dances between an IPA and an IIPA. One that is more of a sipper but is quite enjoyable."
""
"Overall, this is a solid IPA, and while the nose isn’t necessarily remarkable, the flavors on the tongue do an excellent job of showcasing what is possible with hops, experience, and patience. A must-try for serious hopheads."
"Overall: a tasty, well-crafted and refreshing IPA. I'd definitely have this again."
"Mildly hazy golden/amber with a short egg-white colored head. Fresh hops, zesty citrus, rich malts and some raw barley in the aroma. Moderate hop blast, orange rind and lemon zest on the first sip. Rounds off to a tamer, smoother body with soft & bready malts and mild spice. Solid hoppy and malty finish."
"Overall, although the hop flavor's definitely there, there's a surprising amount of sweetness for a big IPA. Quality choice from a great brewer."
""
"i really like what troegs did with this one.. it's just a strong pale ale, but not quite like an ipa. beautiful beer overall."
""
"O - A nice brew that holds its booze well, but overall the imperial levels of sweetness make me wish there was a little more hop bitterness in the profile to balance it out - but I guess that's the catch when you set out to make an imperial pale ale."
"O: Great beer, but I suspect this bottle isn't uber-fresh, and I bet the beer is even better without that age."
""
""
"A truly wonderful beer that one would love to stockpile for the winter ... or the summer ... or the fall... or - you know. A must try from Troeg's."

"Pours a light, golden yellow with a slight bright white head. Worthwhile lacing. Great aroma. Juicy fruits. Tropical formost, with flowers and Nugget Nectar like grapefruit and deliciously sweet malt aroma in the background. Nice quick hop bursts to begin the beer. More floral and grassy than in the aroma. Actually, very floral and herbal. The tropical hops are more subdued, but have their moments. Good and fast sweet malt background before solid bittering pine. Really compact flavor, comes and goes and finishes dry, but a whole lot of action packed in it."
"O: This beer is awesome, I would definitely recommend it. Its really balanced with a nice piney feel thats not over the top. A well made beer thats dangerous at 7.5%. I can only imagine its a lot better on draft."
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up in Buffalo. Pours a clear golden copper with good carbonation. Tastes of citrus and pine, with a good hop bitterness. Good mouthfeel and quite easy to drink. This was a pretty solid imperial pale ale overall. I have to say though, this got a lot of hype on the forums and I didn't see where that was coming from. Good beer, but not outstanding."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear blonde color ale with a large foamy white head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of powerful floral aroma with some green hops notes and a light sweet malt base is very well done and very enticing. Taste is dominated by huge floral hops aroma with light green hops notes and very little bitterness with some lightly sweet malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. I really enjoyed the floral notes and if I were to compare I would say this is a notch below Heady Topper for floral notes but still ay ahead of most IIPA."
"Lightly hazy blonde colour, ring of white head with very little lace hanging around. Smell is really well hopped, pine with some earthy lemony citrus, and bit of fruitiness, a mild underlying mat and a bit of faint alcohol detected as well. Taste is also quite hoppy, citrus, orange and lemon, some pine, malty towards the finish, assertive bitterness throughout, more hops in the aftertaste. Light prickly drying carbonation, some hop oils and medium bodied. Really enjoyable IPA that drinks really quickly, something I would order again, solid stuff."
""
"O: A very good imperial pale ale, Perpetual IPA brings the grandeur of a DIPA with a high IBU count and 7.5% ABV, but the smooth, creamy malt flavors beckon the balance of a solid American Pale Ale. A dangerously drinkable brew for hopheads and fans of big pale ales."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and rather easy drinking IPA."

""

""

"Picked up a bottle after dinner at Capone's after dinner, oh so glad I did. The aroma has a big floral, pine resin punch. It's like a piney perfume, though there is a slight hint of booze as the beer warms. The flavor dives deeper into the citrus rind and pine juice, complemented by a bitter, peppery edge. A lot of IPAs pick up on these same notes, but this one amplifies them all in sharp, clean hits. Great IPA. Go find it."
""
"O: More balancing bitterness would be nice, but otherwise a solid, fruity IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A welcome year-round offering from a world-class brewery. I remember quaffing a 22oz bottle last summer (2011) and loving it. To learn it is a year-round is welcome news. All that enjoy hops and are able to score this brew should not pass this by...it is a wonderful offering."
""
""
""
""
"O - This might be old. It lacks the citrus component and has plenty of malt. I will have to revisit this one."
"O: A very good IPA, well balanced and great taste, not to much booze."
""
""
""
"Big thanks to duceswild for sending these! Poured into a pilsner glass, the clear golden straw colored body looks amazing. A small billowy white head has decent retention with awesome lacing left from top to bottom. Wonderful flowery aromas with a touch of pine and some bread to soften and round off the edges. Taste was nicely balanced with citrus and pine , leans more on the sweeter side which I enjoy. Medium body with a sticky oily feel and a short dry finish. Nicely done IPA, would enjoy this more if I could get it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): What to say about Perpetual IPA? Well, it's clearly another well-executed, tasty brew by Tröegs that brings something unique to the table as far as hoppy beer is concerned. It takes elements of a traditional pale ale and a West Coast IPA and blends them. The result is an exceptional hoppy beer long on fresh, green, citric, piney flavors that exhibits quite a nice malt backbone. I highly recommend this one. Plus, a six will only run you about $11. In the world of craft beer, that's called a bargain."
"Overall this is a solid IPA. I wouldn't expect anything less from Troegs after having Nugget Nectar. Solid brew and an even more solid extra in my latest trade. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good IPA, but far from great. I don't think the hoppy flavors complement the sweetness of the malt very well. In my opinion, the best IPAs provide bitterness in the form of tropical fruit flavors such as grapefruit, lemon, and in the most desirable examples, peaches and sweet oranges. This one carries little, if any, fruity bitterness. Anyone who can find this IPA can certainly find others at the same price that are far superior."
""
"Overall: this is an excellent IPA which is flavorful, drinkable and complex."
"D - a nicely made ipa that lets the hop character shine through with a minimum emphasis on the hops. Great aroma and a well developed flavor profile."

""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid. Not the best, but I'm glad this is going year round."
""
""
"I anxiously awaited the release of Perpetual IPA this year and was disappointed. Did the blind taste comparison with Nugget Nectar again and Perpetual IPA was just marginally better."
"Another quality selection from Troegs; perhaps a little something to hold people off until Nugget Nectar comes back. Clearish golden-amber color with a small cap of delicate white head. Fresh hops in the nose, citrus and fresh fruit. More of the same in the taste, crisp hops, citrus zest, pineapple, sweet bready malts in the background, moderate grassy bitterness in the finish. Light-medium body, full of flavor, and quite drinkable overall."
"O - Not seeing a lot out of this beer. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but there is nothing special."
""
""
"Overall - A good dose of hops with this beer.. and a nice balance of sweet fruits and malts. The hops linger on the taste buds well after the sip is finished. A great effort and a beer I would buy again and love to try on tap."

"The addition of a full time IPA to Troegs lineup is phenomenal. Well balanced and not over powering, the Perpetual is hoppy and filled with citrus flavor and this beer is at the top of my list. This is on par with some of the best IPAs money can buy and has become my go to IPA."

"With a very well rounded profile, beatiful citrus notes and a nice dry pine bite."
"A surprisingly good beer, a great IPA with dry hopping taste and very well malted. Pours medium yellow bodied with lots of carbonation bubbles. A tad above average mouthfeel, smooth. Hoppy aroma.

"Nice, thirst-quenching summer IPA. It's light and blonde, with a modest white head and a spicy aroma. Pine, pepper, and grapefruit rind. Nice smell. The taste is bitter, followed by a light malt flavor and lots of bitter fruit. Refreshing and sharp, but also clean and flavorful. Medium in body with a long-lasting finish."

"O: Somewhat sweet IPA, but not sweet enough to hurt it."
"O- there is a reason I boast Troegs so much... Exactly this! Perpetual pushes the tropical/piney theme of the classic hoppy ipa and makes for a great brew. Wow, this was fresh so I can confirm this brew should be positioned as one of the better ipas on the east coast. It's not flower power or heady... But it is good!"
""
"O - Troegs has made a fantastic IPA here. One of the best single IPAs on the market."
""
""

"O: Overall reminds me a bit of a bells hoplslam aroma wise, mixed in with a Victory Hop Wallop flavor wise.The nose seemed more fresh and appealing then the flavor though my best advice is to give this another try. Was not to impressed with this after one serving, but having bought a six pack and continuing, you'll find that this is a very tasty treat in multiples on a nice summer day, it takes time to warm up to, but is very well balanced, easy to drink with a good amount of hoppiness that will make you keep on enjoying."
""
""
""
""
"I think Troegs totally nailed the texture of this beer. Carbonation level is perfect. Lite, crisp, and refreshing while being a little dry. Sweet start with a nice clean snappy bitter finish. Overall a really great IPA by Troegs, nothing not to love about this IPA. I bought a six pack, but wouldn't hate it if it were a 12."

"Bottom Line- World Class offering from Troegs!"
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottled 5/30/12. Pours a dark yellow, with a one inch white head, that clings beautifully to the glass. Smell is lots of citrus mango, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, and pine. Taste is so perfectly balanced in the start and a nice sharp grapefruit finish. Body is medium for its ABV, perfect amount of carbonation, a little dry not complaining goes well, and dangerously drinkable. Now I consider this a regular IPA, not imperial and it is fantastic. Flower Power, Union Jack, and Hopnotch fans will love this. Well done!"

"A very flavorful and drinkable 'smaller' DIPA. One of my favorite Troegs offerings that I've had to date. Well balanced flavors and textures given the big hop profile."

"This was a nice, flavorful IPA. I wouldn't mind drinking this again."
""
"O - A solid IPA that remains drinkable and is worthy of a year round release, however, nothing will help it stand out among a crowded field where it ranks just a bit higher than average ."
"Hops are balanced nicely here and it is not the 2012 hop machine that most breweries seem to be striving for. However, it still drinks nicely and satisfies the palate."
""
"O- This was a pretty good IPA and at $11/6-pack for a year round offereing you definitely can not beat it. Recommend picking it up if it's available around you. Definitely not as good as a lot of the better IPAs out there, but not bad. A little bit too tart and too much of a sugary fruitiness to be considered top-notch in my opinion."
"O: Extremely easy to drink and very enjoyable - much in the West Coast variant of an IPA. There is some bitterness to this beer but it is not overly aggressive and the alcohol is very well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - unfortunately I just dont get the glowing reviews for this beer. I am usually a Troegs fan but this one fails to hit the mark. Easy to drink yes, but fails to live up to most all of the requirements for an IPA. Just meh, and barely that. I will give it another try and revise if needed. They deserve that at least."
"O - This is a great west coast ipa from the east coast. I'm happy to hear it's going to be a year round offering and it will be a great guaranteed-fresh IPA."

"Kickass local brew. A firm bitterness in this IPA that many others overdo. 4.0"

"O - I am thrilled that they are now able to brew this year-round. A regularly available true IPA is something that Troegs lacked and this is a fantastic addition. The color is pale and sets the tone for the light crisp nature of the beer. Great citrus and hop flavors. I usually look forward to the release of this one each year, but I am very happy it will now be a fridge staple. Second best Troegs beer to Nugget Nectar in my opinion. Highly recommend it."
"Enjoyed this beer, but don't just have one. The second beer really gives you the full experience."
"Overall this is a well balanced brew, full of flavor and full of hops. This should make the hopheads of the world happy any season of the year. Not quite as good a Troeg's Nugget Nectar but close."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great hop fix, insane aroma fresh, really complex hop profile, Huge spicey/earthy/floral flavors. I'd return to this one. One of the best and most unique East Coast IPA's out there (really a 1.5 IPA)"
"Overall nice IPA enjoyable wonderful smelling, nice tasting and goes down easy for 7.5%. Then again Troegs knows how to brew some good beer, pick some up and enjoy."
""
""
""
""

"Pretty good brew. Yellow straw color like a pilsner, with a cat piss aroma; probably from the citra hops. Lots of tropical aroma going on from the get go giving off that cat piss pungency. The body is a little above average and the alcohol content is apparent throughout. Good puckering bitterness without being overpowering."

"O - Damn, I did not expect this when I decided to visit the brewery. I like Perpetual as much as the next guy but this version is on a whole other level. The sheer amount of hops packed into this small firkin is staggering. Possibly one of the best Troegs beers I have ever had."
"O: Good, not great. Somewhat similar to the Headwaters as I said before, but more malty in the body. One that I'll definitely pick up on occasion when I can find it super-fresh!"

"O - Pretty standard IPA. Very grapefruit heavy with some nice pine and grassiness. I think when it comes to Troegs though, nothing can beat the amazingly intense and tropical nugget nectar."

"D: I would definitely drink this beer quite often, if it was available. It's cross between the Pale Ale and the Hopback Amber. The Troegner's did a good job on this one. As usual."
"Overall – This beer was fantastic on many fronts. It had a great look smell and feel, and the taste for the most part was a pleasant dry hoppy flavor. Unfortunately the taste left on the tongue at the end was not too pleasant and really pulled away from the overall drinkability."

"I see a lot of folks raving about this, but it's no Nugget Nectar, that's for sure. I was really looking forward to this, because I missed it the first time around, but it didn't live up to the expectations I had. It's certainly not a bad beer (I'm giving it a 3.5 overall), but after I finish this case, I won't be buying it again. It misses the mark for me as an IPA and there are much better IPAs out there. If they wanted it to be something different, they should have named it differently. It's all sort of confusing. Worth a try, certainly not bad, but not really my cup of tea, either."

"This American IPA pours a bright yet slightly hazy golden color, almost no head, surprising as it is full of carbonation. The scent is full of floral notes, has significant hops in the nose as well. Taste is a bright clear and crisp hoppy taste, bitter and dry, even finish. The one drawback is a bit too much carbonation, but its a tasty beer. Troegs does it well."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice tropical hop profile with some great bitterness. There is not too much malt coming through."
""
""
""
""
""
"A little bit of a let down after so much talk about Troegs releasing an IPA."
"I poured this from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass, it has a nice golden color body with a nice 2""" white head that slowley layed down to a thin lace around the top of the body. The smell is of piney and some citrus hop come through. The nice taste of pine, and the bitterness of the hops hits the tastes bud pretty well. Some malt comes through on the back but not too much. This has a nice dry finish and overall is a really good IPA. Great job troegs."
""
""
""
"Cheers."
"O: decent ipa, but also a bit one dimensional. I would have preferred stronger aromas to match the bitter-heavy taste. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I paid $11 for a 22oz bottle and I feel its good I just wish it was a flagship for the Troegs brother and available in six packs. one of my favorites along with nugget nectar and hop back. great job again Troegs!!!!"
"O: Perpetual IPA is my kind of beer. Finally Tröegs produces an IPA that I can get down with. I was starting to get concerned after the multiple attempts in the Scratch Series. Bottom line, I'm glad they landed on this for a seasonal release even though I feel that Perpetual IPA is strong enough to be a part of their year-round portfolio."

"Similar to Jarl, with more complexity and malty smoothness. No sign of Nugget dry-hopping. Way too drinkable for 7.5%. Calls itself an Imperial Pale Ale, and so it is."
""
"T: Orange and lemon zest, citrus with a dry feel, practically leap out of my glass (but not right away). The booziness is more prominent here than in the nose. My biggest complaint about the tap lines at Troegs: the ales are too damned cold. The hoppiness is lost to the temperature. As the ale warms, the hops become stronger, more evident. The citrus and zest are light but increase with each sip, strong but never out of whack. Pale malts aren't a factor but they keep the hops in"

"Pours a hazy light gold with a fluffy white head that settles to a squat cap. Resinous hop aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, mango, and peach with a touch of pine resin and a slightly sweet malt backbone. Taste is similar to the nose, lots of delicious tropical hop flavors with a fairly mild caramel malt profile. Finish is pleasantly bitter, and lingers for a good amount of time. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, with a medium body and good carbonation. Overall an excellent IPA offering, this would be a good addition to Troegs' year-round offerings!"

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, balanced with a gentle abrasive spiciness along the tongue."

"Overall: Bold all around, yet quite drinkable. Only possible improvement (and I hate to even mention it) would be some more malt complexity."
""
""
""
"O- Very much enjoyed this beer. Lots of hop flavors that go well together. Bitterness is there but not overdone. This one will stay on my wants for sure. Big thanks to Sam for giving me one of these bottles!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Troegs continual experimentation of hop combinations is starting to pay big dividends as is evident by this brew. Hopefully they keep cranking this out each year."

"O: An amazing IPA! Easily one of my top 3 or 4. A must try!!!"
"O - Good, nothing to complain about, nothing to brag about either."
"Overall, this is a great American IPA especially given that it's usually found at half the price of something like Sculpin. Highly recommended if found fresh."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice IPA to pound down for a whole evening."
"O - Overall this was a very pleasant surprise! I expected a good beer and I got a great one! Similar to NN is many ways, this beer is more hop-forward and a bit less balanced."
"Overall, Troegs knows their hops and they no how to use them. Perpetual is just another example of this. I wouldn't mind seeing this in 12 ounce bottles in the future."
"O= Overall, I thought this was pretty good beer glad I got to try this one. I thought this was a above average IPA and I would try this one again."
"O/D - This is a solid beer. It's not as good as Nugget Nectar, but I would definitely drink it again."
"O: Nice IPA, I would definitely like to revisit this."
"Overall: Not bad at all. Great fruity hop aroma, and a well-balanced flavor profile. I'm going to be on the lookout for a fresh bottle of this next time I'm in Troegs territory!"
"O/D- Easy to drink - the alcohol isn't coming through for me. Good, but I feel like I'm left with something to be desired."
"A bit too bitter/lemony for my preferences but a good beer none-the-less. Worth a pints-worth. Big thanks to CaptCleveland for the try!"
"Digging the artwork here, man. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset gold topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises plenty o' grapefruit (both yellow and ruby red), a touch of orange zest, an even lighter touch of lemon rind, a hint of pine needles, and a light smattering of sweet biscuits. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger pine element (though it's still submissive to the fruit), a bit of mandarin orange, and a hint of pineapple. Tasty stuff, indeed! The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, a very tasty IPA, one of the better ones I've had in a while. The sheer extent of fruitiness and dryness, though, makes it hard for me to think about drinking too many of these in one sitting. Oh well, it's great stuff regardless."
"Very well done and one I'll go back to."
"O- Excellent IPA not overly hopped up, not overly sweet. Perfectly balanced. If only my glass was always full of this!"
"O: Really a nice beer from Troegs, glad to have tried this one. Reminds me of Two Hearted quite a bit actually."
"I'd like more regular access to this and appreciate the hop forward drive and opportunity to try this. Thanks again Alex!"
"Fresh piney citrus aroma rises from this orangey/gold slightly hazy IPA. It really is a nice looking beer with a small but stubborn white cap on top. the candy-like malt backbone blends very well with the citrusy hop flavors, and leaves just a bit of lingering flavor on the palate. Definitely not a very bitter IPA, which is actually quite fine by me. Balance is key here, which troegs are masters at. A very nice Imperial Pale Ale."
"O-Very good ipa. Really refreshing and crisp. Not extremely hoppy, but sometimes it is what the mood calls for. Great for somebody who wants to get into IPA's, great starter beer."
"Lighter, floral on the style; kudos to Troegs on a unique slant in a market flooded with IPAs. This is a Fall release but I think it would be ideal for the springtime."
"Overall, a well-crafted IPA."
"MUCH better than several of those Scratch beers that were ipas!"
"Really digging the label and engineering reference. Says it was run through the hop back and then dry hopped. Well the effort does not go unnoticed here."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, hazy orange pour, big white head, loads of white lacing. The aroma is pineapple juice, with orange rind and hints of pine. The beer is juicy, lots of citrus, definite tropical notes, hints of pine, lingering bitter pine on the finish. The brew is medium in body, good carbonation, drinks bigger than it is. A very nice IPA."
"O - A solid IPA from a solid brewery. It doesn't stand out, but it certainly doesn't disappoint either."
"Overall: A very solid, well-balanced beer. What stands out in this one for me is the nice balanced addition of the citrus and malts with the still strong hop flavour."
"Nice deep gold color. Good one finger head that drops quickly to a thin skim that leaves great lacing. Smell of strong grapefruit with a strong malt base. Taste is a nice solid ipa in every way. Maybe not quite in the imperial range as indicated on the bottle but a good solid ipa."
"overall good, but doesn't really taste """bigger""" than a normal IPA, as the label suggests with the """Imperial""" tag."
"O: Love it! Could drink a few."
"Overall impression: Solid IPA. Nothing outstanding and seems fairly run-of-the-mill given Troegs track record and the hype surrounding this beer. Won't seek out again but a good example."
"Overall a superior IIPA, and another great beer from Troegs. This should be a perpetual treat."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Drinkability is high on this one. It goes down easily, perhaps a bit too easily, and the dry finish invites the next sip quite naturally. My overall impression is that this is a well made beer that competes flavorably with others of its style and I’m hoping this will indeed be around a long time and bottled in 12 oz bottles."
"While I still like this beer quite a bit, the fact is that it was much better a month ago when I had it last. If you've still got this kicking aound your fridge, don't wait, drink it now."
"The alcohol is far more potent than the smell would indicate. Otherwise, the taste does match the aroma profile, perhaps with a stronger bittering bite. The body is typical of the style. The carbonation is low--surprising, given the thick, frothy head."
"D: really delicious brew. it is nice to have a big tropical IPA not be totally cloying and overpowering the palate. and for a very, very moderate price of $5 i hope this will be around a lot more."
"Can't believe it's been so long since I've had something from Troegs. I think I need an Ohio trip to replenish the supply after I'm reminded how great all of their beers are."
"Flavor follows suit, with a bit of bitterness towards the back end of the spectrum. Still almost no pine. Tropical fruits are toned down a bit (unfortunately) but there is still a solid wave of citrus that makes this quite enjoyable."
"M - Medium body with light carbonation."
"Overall: One of my favorites of summer 2011. This should be a year-found offering!"
"Overall, I really wish they would just go ahead and call this an IPA, not an imperial pale ale. The best part about this beer was it's price ($5/bomber), but still another decent offering from Troegs."
"Mouthfeel is slightly heavier than medium bodied and leaves a good film on the inside of your mouth. Carbonation is on an average level. Overall, a good brew, but overpowering on the bitter side. Not a bad thing, just beware if that's not your thing in a beer."
"O - Not surprisingly, the growler has the same characteristics as the pint that I had on-tap an hour ago. I was pleased they sold it to go at a very reasonable price so I can enjoy this with my meals for the next couple of evenings. This is a really good beer in its own right and at this price, it's a great value. I sure hope Troegs offers this year-round."
"A very nice IPA by Troegs overall. Great aromas and plenty of character to offer the senses."
"Pours a deep straw with a nice, white, sticky head, plenty of lacing. Nose is a sharp bite of hops, strong citrus - grapefruit, floral, some sweet caramel underlying. Strong grapefruit in the taste, some earthiness, ending pleasantly bitter leading into a slight malt aftertaste, minor warming from the alcohol. Sharp citrus hops are throughout this brew. Medium mouthfeel, strongly carbonated. Overall this is a solid double, great hoppiness throughout though the brew might benefit from a higher apv. Regardless, this is good."
"Drinkability- Really nice beer that is extremely easy drinking and pretty damned tasty. I’m definitely not always a fan of Troegs IPA’s but they did a great job this time. Thanks much Jeff, mucho enjoyable!"
"O: I really enjoyed this offering from Troegs. Super-fresh bottles certainly does not hurt here! Should be interesting to see how subsequent releases compare. Would not mind this becoming a regular offering!"
"O: This beer impressed me. Lots and lots of hops, but in no way a palate wrecker. The perfect carbonation level seemed to have the hop flavors dancing on my tongue, and in the end just the right amount of malt backbone tied it all together into a nicely made hop forward brew. Will definitely be picking up more of these soon."
"O: This was spectacular. Best single IPA I've ever had."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: It's so so. I'd definitely drink this under the """it's local""" category but don't need to seek it out again."
"4.0 D: Good beer. Another solid offering from Troegs. I super hate the label art, but I can get over it."
"Totally down for this to be paired with BBQ chicken!"
"O- I drink a ton of IPA's being from Southern California and this stands up to some of the best IPA's around here. Thanks again Adam really glad I got to try this one, another great beer from Troeg's, I've liked everything I have had from them."
"Medium-bodied with decent carbonation. Easily drinkable, but honestly an underwhelming beer. More partial to the NN."
"o - Overall a really good IPA and another good beer from Troegs. Lots of fresh hops and fruit in the nose and taste, and great mouthfeel. Would definitely buy some of this if I saw it in bottles."
"The alcohol was perfect in this beer in the sense that it was present but couldn't be felt. While this wasn't as good as the Nugget Nectar, any fan of that or the Hopback Amber will be pleased with the purchase of this bomber. This would be a great IPA for the first-time drinker as its a good example of the style without being over-the-top. Cheers to Troegs for yet another highly enjoyable brew."
"O: Good stuff. A little more herbal than we were hoping for. We were really in the mood for an IPA with loads of pine or tropical fruit. Still, very solid."
"22oz bomber with a Bottled on Date of 081111. Pours a translucent golden straw color with a half inch of head. Tons of lacing. Nice whiff of hops. Piney with some citrus. Taste is more of the citrusy hops upfront followed by pine at the end. Fair amount of hop flavor but not all that bitter. Mostly bitter at the end along with some resinous qualities. Crisp and easy to drink. Somewhat thin of a mouthfeel but it works for this beer. Certainly reminiscent of Hopback Amber. Overall, its a pretty solid IPA worth trying again. Glad to see an Autumn release that's an IPA."
"overall: this is really quite an impressive pale ale. stylistically excellent and a little soulful to boot. an excellent run at the classic sierra nevada pale. they really do taste quite similar, but i would choose troegs every time over it."
"The beer is yellow, perhaps slightly orange, with a finger of white head that leaves some decent lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma is dominated by citrus and hops. Very nice. The flavor follows suit, with notes of tropical fruit, as well as a citrus and floral presence. Subtle notes of pine are present as well. Alcohol presence is well disguised. Malt is secondary to hops, as it should be. A really tasty IPA from an east coast brewery."
"Overall (4.5): Damn good. They better start releasing this seasonally or something. Between this and Nugget Nectar, nobody can make the argument that the East Coast doesn’t know how to handle hops. I just want more, more, and more. Holy cow this beer is great."
"Many thanks to MDaschaf for the chance to taste this one. Poured from bottle into Brooklyn tulip glass. Pours an astonishingly light orange/yellow color. Lighter than most IPAs I have ever had. nice head, not much retention. Smell- light citrus, sweet bready malt. Some tropical flavors like mango. Taste- hmm. something not quite right here. The hops aren't very noticable. This bottle is about 2 months old I think, but it has barely any hops profile left. This doesn't even resemble an IPA. Maybe like a weak pale ale? Dissapointing. Highly drinkable though...not much too it. Not very complex."
"The mouthfeel is a little below medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very solid IPA with some very good hoppiness. The aroma had a little more of a herbal, earthy hoppiness while the taste brought out some very good juicy and fruity hoppiness. I definitely preferred the taste to the aroma, although they both were pretty good. Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer."
"poured from bottle to glass. Hazy complexion with good lacing with a 1/4 inch head. Solid beer, good flavor, godd mouthfeel, nothing outstanding, but very appealing. Easy to drink, there are several of the style I prefer, but would buy this beer on a regular basis if it was available to me. Would take it as an extra, will not put it on my want list."
"Perpetual IPA took me by surprise; I am impressed by the expressive hops and minimal malts. Troegs should consider releasing this on a regular basis; perhaps in six packs."
"Overall: This is just another east coast ipa that just doesnt stack up to some of the better examples of the style"
"They are calling this an Imperial Pale Ale, so I guess it kinda meets that description. But it is not something that I'd buy again. Very disappointed - I usually love Troeg's offerings."
"O: A damn fine IPA. Hops are well done, body and malt are enough to keep it from being overwhelming. This one is a winner. Not my favorite IPA, but one I would drink anytime it was put in front of me. Recommended."
"Gold with a bit of haze and a half inch of dense, long-lasting foam. The fine bubbles clung to the glass in streaks and sheets. Grapefruit hit my nose first, followed by dry malt and citrus rind, light pineapple fruitiness. Sturdy bitterness throughout with lingering citrusy hops with a bit of a resinous quality. Pale maltiness up front with mild fruitiness and faint alcohol spiciness kicking in later on. Medium bodied with fine, silky carbonation, fairly dry with no alcohol warmth. Highly drinkable -- this bomber didn't last very long. Overall, it was very clean and fresh tasting with a straightforward flavour profile, which really worked. A great addition to Troegs' line up."
"Pours a wondrous, vibrant gold color with pure-white head, and lots of it. The body is hazy to the point of distortion, but not entirely opaque. The smell is of citrus, faint spice, more citrus, pine resin, straw, freshly cut grass, and bittering hops. An IPA scent for the ages. Taste follows suit, with grapefruit, orange, lemon, loads of hops, pine, grass, straw, and faint, faint caramel. A touch of cane sugar on the finish and in the mouth brings it down slightly, as it adds a sense of artificiality to it (not a gripe, just an observation). Mouthfeel is otherwise, crisp, bitter, and rejuvenating; finishes dry and slightly sticky. Overall, a great IPA that certainly stands out."
"I was a little apprehensive about the Imperial Pale Ale designation. I should’ve never doubted Tröegs. Those guys are too damn good. Perpetual IPA is a very impressive, very flavorful Imperial Pale Ale. I wouldn’t mind if the flavor were skewed a tad more in the hoppy direction, but it is damn good as it is. It features a lively hop flavor and is restrained on the malty side, especially with the caramel variety. Find a bomber! Very good stuff!"
"I thoroughly recommend this beer. Good luck finding it. It has been sold out in many of the local stores. Oh well, here is my opportunity to try a new IPA beer."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a huge fluffy white eggshell head. Retention is great on this and leave nice lacing. The smell is big time grapefruit and sour orange aromas. Taste is along the same lines, a little thin for a double IPA which is what the ABV conveys. Nice balance and crisp bite. Big grapefruit acidity and refreshing. Some negatives is the bitterness that is not supplemented with a prevalent malt base. Thin on the palate, but has an oily hop coating that makes me like this. Overall its a nice brew and for the price it is totally worth it. Would i try this again, yes, but i wouldn't search and and low for it."
"Overall a great beer. I really enjoyed it and would love to drink it again."
"Overall: Each aspect of this beer is good. Nothing is spectacular, but this is a solid beer."
"Overall, this is a solid East Coast IPA. A step below Nugget Nectar obviously, but leaps and bounds above the majority of East Coast IPAs."
"D: I was thinking that this was the easiest drinking 7.5% abv IPA I have encountered, and then I went to pour the rest of the bomber. Imperial Pale Ale – that explains it! That is why I was thinking it was so light colored, restrained in the malts, and light in the body. Here I was think it was a somewhat tame (but still quite good) India Pale Ale that drank more like a Pale. Silly me. This bugger is dangerously drinkable precisely because the “light” traits make it drink more like a 6% brew. Imperial Pale – kick ass."
"HV"
"I was expecting a lot better IPA considering the hop schedule. It's pretty well put together, but doesn't have that hop flavor that i was craving."
"More quality brew from Penn. heavyweight Troegs"
"O: Delicious hop water without a strong malty base. 3.5"
"Recommended"
"I'm really stoked about this beer. The hops are big and grassy and the fruit flavors are tropical and tasty, but they all play off each other masterfully. The whole thing is top-notch."
"This reminds me most of Odell's IPA that I seek out whenever in Colorado. It's the closest thing I've found to it in the East. A very thoughtful and delightful (there's that word again) brew. I'd pair this with a lot of different foods too."
"Poured into a standard pint glas a clear light golden with one finger white head atop that held well.Big pithy hops in the nose,grapefruit really stood out,really fresh and in you face.A big shot of citric hops at the onset with a big sweetish caramel base coming into play midway,more sugary sweetness in the finish.Started out great,and was a really good DIPA,but there was some big sweetness in there as well."
"Overall I was surprised by this beer. It's an awesomely drinkable PA with a great price tag. Troegs has failed to let me down yet."
"O - Overall, this is a very nice IPA. Well done, clean and drinkable."
"It's a beautiful thing."
"Light copper orange in color with yellowish hues and a light haze. Poured with a dense, frothy white head with nice retention. Foam reduced to a thick cap that left ample sticky lacings on the glass. Medium bodied with a slightly resinous feel. Delicate citrus grapefruit hop aroma with an underlying malty sweetness. Dominant grapefruit citrus flavor, more intense than the aroma, with a sweet malty backbone. Pine hop bitterness shows up at the finish leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste. This was excellent. I wish it came in 12oz bottles."
"Not what I was expecting based on the look and smell. Good beer, but it is definitely lacking in the taste department."
"o - overall, this is not what i was expecting. more malty than i expected, more earthy than i expected...then it hit me...this isn't an IPA, it is an imperial pale ale...and for that, this is pretty solid. still this beer is more earthy than your average pale ale and lacks the citric hop kick that i look for in both styles."
"O- Honestly I thought this beer would've been an IPA(India pale ale) but it really is what an """imperial""" pale ale style of beer would resemble. I think Tröegs may be on to something with this. Glad to see it as a fall offering and no longer limited. This screams easy drinking, but the 7.5% can get you in trouble just like their NN does. A very good one for the price."
"O- Very good ipa. Has a nice amount of bitterness to balance the malts. A bit thin but makes it a nice easy drinking bigger IPA."
"D - A solid, but largely underwhelming offering. I appreciate the value price and there are no major flaws other than the lack of intense flavors - might make a nice beer for longer sessions. Not sure how fresh this bottle was, but I'd give it another shot if I saw it on draft on the East Coast."
"O- I have a couple bottles of these with this one not having a date, so I'm not sure how old this bottle is and if they bottled several times this Fall, but the flavors seemed to be somewhat subdued. I have another bottle that was dated a little more than a month, so I will have to revisit this shortly."
"D/O: Light, refreshing, and quite drinkable."
"O: Good stuff. A bit of a disconnect between the light color and the heavy weight, but it's still going down easy. I'd buy it again."
"O: awesome IPA all around, love the fruit flavors. Great summertime IPA more specifically."
"Overall: A fine IPA; just like I like it, as it is all about the citrusy hops and the malt provides the platform rather than the competition"
"O - Has that unique Troegs taste with the hop combinations they use. Balances very well between the malts and hops despite the dominance of the hops if that makes any sense. I would definitely get this again."
"O- Balanced, bitter, and flavorful. Nothing that incredibly stands out, but very solid. Would definitely buy again as, long as price was right. Perhaps this would be better in 6pks?..."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, grapefruit and orange citrus hops. In the taste, dry citrus rinds, and somewhat pine like. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry trace of hops in the aftertaste. Big nose and mellow taste, lack of aftertaste, good but mellow."
"Overall? Thank you Troegs for making an IPA that stands up to those pesky West Coast IPA's...seriously, this has what every hophead is looking for. Real shame that this is a limited release only. Hopefully it is """limited release""" like Flying Mouflan was """Limited Release.""" Glad I bought a case of these bombers..."
"Lots of great hops and just little malt, a very balanced great beer."
"Pours a nice pretty clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy/foamy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, slight malt note, grapefruit. The taste is hoppy, nice citrus note, round off with some maltyness. Medium Body, nice bitter/dry finish. Not a bad brew, but there are nicer IPAs out there. Glad to have had a chance to try it."
"O- A very nice Imperial IPA, but overly alcoholic."
"Cheers"
"This brew pours out as a nice looking golden orange color. The head has some nice lacing and retention. The smell is really nice, plenty of hops and citrus aromas. The taste of the beer is smooth and piny, kind of refreshing too. The mouthfeel of this brew is pretty light bodied, but really goes down nicely. Overall this IPA pretty much rocks. I enjoyed it quite a bit and would probably buy it again some day."
"overall, a solid IPA, i really dig it, exspecially all the fruit flavors. similar in ways to both nugget nectar and ithaca hop stash. definatly a must try."
"O - Overall, quite an enjoyable brew from Troegs. A shame this is a limited release as I would definately like a fresh bottle of this come summer time. The on tap version is not quite as good as the bottle though."
"Very clear gold beer with a nice fluffy head and good lacing. Head sticks around for a while. Aroma of hoppy goodness; a lot of citrus and pineapple standing out. The taste has all those hops, with the bitterness held in check just enough to let the subtleties shine through. Faintly malty undertones, vaguely sweet, nicely balanced. Carbonation is moderate; finish is medium short, w/first lingering hoppy citric notes and finally a pleasant, controlled bitterness. Impressive. Truly one of the best East Coast IPA's I've had to date. Get it, drink it, love it."
"O - This may be the most robust IPA i've ever had because of the elaborate flavor, dominant hop character, and abv. If someone told me that it was a DIPA, I'd believe it. The most surprising aspect of this beer to me is that it looks nothing like an IPA. It's very clean, clear, and crisp like a pilsner with no sediment whatsoever. You wouldn't expect such a bland-looking beer to deliver this much flavor...highly recommend it!"
"Overall - Very nice IPA. Glad to see more and more east coast breweries making west coast style IPAs."
"Another excellent offering from Tröegs. If it were 4% alcohol by volume, it would be perfect."
"O: An excellent beer from Troegs that I hope is going to be more than just a seasonal. This beer is very drinkable and has great hop aromas, especially for a non-IPA. I'm planning to find more of this, while it is still somewhat fresh."
"A very nice AIPA, pretty much nails the style. Not the most flavorful hop profile but is still quite good. Would prefer more citrus and fresh hop flavor."
"Overall this was a good beer but nothing to write home about. It was tasty but not really worth the price point because of the serving size. This is a 6-pack beer in a 22 oz package which is never good for your wallet. Nugget Nectar is heads and tails better and will be the only Troegs beer I buy going forward."
"O: Overall this is going to become a regular feature in my fridge."
"Not a bad beer but pretty bitter. With the amount of bitterness and hops used I was expecting more hop flavor. This tends to be more bitter then flavorfull."
"Overall, this is a very nice imperial pale ale. One of the best I have had in this category. The nose and palate remind me a lot of some of the elite IPA's. This is a winner."
"From a bottle. Pours clear medium gold with a weirdly fizzy white head. Nose is a pretty nice balance of fresh hops and citrus rind, some candied orange. Mouth is fresh and balanced, hops focus on pine needles. A one-note bittering effect from beginning to end. Not as large and expressive as Nuggest Nectar. A decent IPA, good stuff right now, but not the greatest I've had recently and nothing to go nuts over. Succeeds in being nicely balanced and highly drinkable."
"D: This is a very nice brew from Troegs. It seems to fit into that vague """Extra IPA""" territory between IPA and Double IPA, but that's mostly a matter of semantics. I really enjoyed the Citra and Nugget dry hop character, which definitely adds a distinctive (and nicely complementary) character to this beer. Troegs does good work with hoppy styles (see Nugget Nectar and Hopback Amber), and this is no exception."
"Notes: Imperial Pale Ale hence IPA… Troegs always seems to be playing with this denomination, for instance with their Nugget nectar. It may work for them but meddles a bit the denomination of what is a nice hefty IPA, short of any imperial denominations I guess… Different than their NN, which I like more now, but at this price point this is a nice offering."
"O: Troegs Perpetual is a true achievement. An APA with chops. It's flavorful, crisp, and clean and I must say I think they accomplished exactly what they were going for. This is a great beer."
"So perfectly bitter in the taste. Grapefruit and piney hops run rampant and really make for a balanced, albeit on the very hoppy side, pale ale. A lemon citrus taste is detected in the middle, making for a juicy mouthfeel. A very light biscuit quality is in the back that only makes the hoppiness stand out more, as it makes for a backdrop, like a blank canvas. The best part may be the ultra clean mouthfeel and finish. Crisp and dry, but still juicy in the middle. Aftertaste holds some of the bitterness to remind you just how potent it is and makes you want to take another sip. Although its 7.5% abv, it doesn't really show it at all, except for maybe just a breath in the end. This is one of those beers that goes to show that there doesn't always need a large amount of malt presence to make a great beer. There is some malt presence, but the hops really just do what they do best here. I am impressed with this one and will probably buy again."
"O- Nice, reminds me a bit of SN Hoptimum. Grassy, piney and brash hop flavors! Certainly not ground breaking, nor is it even in my top 20 IPA's... but it was nice to try."
"O: Pretty nice taste and smell. Well balanced. Enjoyable."
"Imperial Pale Ale or strong IPA? I imagine it could really pass for an IPA and nobody would really question it, perhaps noting that it is a bit light. Overall easy drinking, great tasting, and interesting beer."
"D: This may very well be the best IPA I've had, if not, it's in the top three. I absolutely love this beer."
"It’s a fine beer. Nothing wrong with it, but also not as exciting as I had hoped. Good, Not great"
"Overall a very good beer, although the taste was almost a letdown after how much I liked the look and smell."
"Overall: I enjoy the smell a lot. The taste less so. I don't like when an ipa is grainy or vegetal, and this has a little of that. Also a little too unbalanced with harsh bitterness. Good, not great."
"7.5% is a surprise, because Perpetual IPA doesn't show it at all. I also expected this one to be a little more citrus forward, but that is a small qualm. Overall, this is another solid beer from Troegs."
"1367"
"Overall this is a solid bitter IPA, I'd have preferred a bit more balance however."
"Overall: I would say this is a nice IPA, less so as a IIPA though even that is not bad. Like an IPA, I prefer this cooler than the 50-55 degree recommendation for IIPAs. Yes, this is better than the Scratch IPAs I've had. Drink this slightly cooler than 50 degrees. This is a nice beer put out by an excellent brewery."
"Pours a nice darker orange with some gold highlights. Not a lot of head or lacing. The smell is weak, what's there isn't bad. A little floral and maybe some light citrus on the sweeter side. A little pale malt that translates to the taste too. The taste has a nice dry lemongrass quality and finishes very dry. Wheatlike notes. Overall ok, but nothing compared to many DIPAs out there."
"This is a good DIPA, one that's worth both the price and time drinking. I would have appreciated more sweetness from the malt, but I understand that most IPAs are really just a canvas for an extreme display of hops and bitterness. In the end, this is probably one of the best beers that troegs produces, and is worth seeking out."
"I'm glad Troegs made an IPA. This beer has a distinctive hop profile that reminds me, in some ways, of Nugget Nectar."
"Overall it's delicious. Lives up to expectations. I wish I had more than one bomber..."
"O - Really happy to have had this, and it has to rank among the best East Coast IPAs out there. That being said, I still long for the day when there is a well-distributed bone-dry IIPA east of the Mississippi. A bit too sweet for my palate overall, but I'm getting through the bomber just fine. If you like 'um a little chewy, you're going to love this, but pick one up regardless."
"O- half the cost of Sculpin for a bomber, and tastes just as good. Yeah, I'm down"
"Good in all aspects but for whatever reason doesn't stand out for me either."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. I am honestly taken aback by this beer. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this at all, and I have to say it is easily one of the best East coast IPAs I've had and a strong contender against the giants in the West as well. Definitely hop forward, but from there it balances itself among the hop influences and hits nearly all major categories (floral, pine, citrus, spicy) strongly. I will most definitely be seeking this out soon to try again, an absolute joy."
"Pours a clear light light copper yellow with a 2 finger head that forms a pretty 1/4 inch lace around the glass. Smells of sticky pine hops, traces of grapefruit, mango, melon and other citrus fruits can be found. Very IPA'ish on the bite, bit juicy hop burst with all the before mentioned citrus tones balanced perfect with the gentle malt in the background. This beer is medium in body, sweet, very bitter on the finish. This is good stuff i dont understand why Troegs makes there best stuff all limited editions..."
"It pours crystal clear and light golden colored, with a few fingers of foam that lace in huge clumpy sheets on the glass. Citrus aromas throughout, grapefruit and such. Strongly bitter up front, with a lot of caramel malt balance and a citric aftertaste. Slightly heavy body for an IPA, nice. Very good value and solid overall."
"Overall, very drinkable. Not my favorite, but pretty good beer. Would buy again."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a tinge of orange and two fingers of fluffly and bubbly/soapy bright white head that leaves great lacing everywhere. Smells fantastic. Floral hops with citrus tones - yes, tones - with a slightly sweet sweaty tangerine/marijuana and trace of pine smell. Taste: basically the same as the smell...if pine trees had flowers this is what the nectar would taste like. Hops hit u up front and malts slide down in the finish - perfectly balanced, and the balance is a delicate one, like walking a tightrope. Mouthfeel is perfect. Overalll - it lives up to the hype. Up there with flower power and two hearted for me without a doubt. Troegs better put this out in 12oz. bottles and make it a year-round affair or I will be very disappointed in them. Beautiful."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A really good beer here. If it's not elite where Ipas and hoppy Pales are concerned, it's darn close. Alcohol is well hidden, and this one goes down too easy. Cheers!"
"O: This is a wonderful IPA. This has to be one of the best American IPA's I have recently tasted, and quite possibly ever tasted. It reminds me of Bell's Two-Hearted in the taste profile, but it is more complex. Bell's is pretty much just delivering one flavor, while this has many tones and complexities in comparison. I have been drinking Troeg's for quite a while and it is about time they added a beer like this to their lineup. Good Work."
"The Troegs Perpetual IPA has a well deserved name. The flavor is consistent with each sip, and has a very deep hop presence which is always welcome. This brew has crossover potential, as it is light, with some hop flavor but totally unoffensive. A worthwhile investment, and could be a mainstay."
"The ample carbonation medium thickness leave a nice slick oily film on he palate after the finish. The grapefruit flavors are left as an aftertaste, too. Overall, this is one helluva good beer. The long-awaited supposedly more-often-than-one-off IPA from Troegs delivers on all fronts."
"O -- this was a fantastic beer and one that I'll seek out again. Definitely one of Troegs' best beers. I finished the second half of the bottle after it warmed up a bit, and the aroma/flavors were even more enjoyable."
"overall, a really great IPA; very tasty. while i wouldn't put it up there with the best of the best, it's an excellent brew. at a nice price point, too."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip, bottle 8/11/11. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with 2 fingers of dense off white head with amazing retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap. A bit of nice lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big pine, caramel, orange, tropical fruits, and spices. Very nice aromas here with good strength as well. Taste of big pine, grapefruit, orange, caramel, and big spiciness. Nice amount of bitterness present on the finish that lingers for a decent period of time with caramel, citrus, pine, and spice notes. Very nice balance of bitterness to sweetness. Medium carbonation and body, with a decently creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a very small warming after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to drink as well. Overall an excellent and delicious IPA. Very hoppy and nicely balanced, with smooth drinkability."
"O - Had high hopes for this one...although without knowing much about what to expect from it. I will border on saying this is Pliny-esque...although not quite matching it for overall character. This bottle is just over 2 weeks old and its freshness is really shining thru. Glad I grabbed a couple when I could - already looking forward to the next bottle."
"This brew is pretty crazy and quite tasty. The hop character and malt character are great, though I think they went just a bit overboard with the hopping for my taste. I like hoppy IPAs, but this one just seems a bit too bitter for the malt backbone that it has. Still quite good though, and definitely recommended."
"Overall - Really tasty and smooth. More balanced and malty then the smell was leading me to believe. I really am glad this beer was finally made, now i hope it will be made year-round."
"This beer is too easy to drink. Washed down a salad with this beer and could have easily downed two more. I look forward to seeing this around on a more frequent occasion, as i thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Future outlook: As expected from Tröegs, another quality brew."
"O: A very nice beer. Hard to know what its true style is APA vs IPA, but whatever it is, I like it. And at $4.50 a bomber, its a great deal."
"Taste-Apricot, brown-sugared grapefruit, pineapple, followed by a nice dose of hops that offer a nice balance and great flavor. Fragrant and very tasty, this brew would match well with sweet and sour chicken infused with Wasabi, or a round of spicy Thai spring rolls."
"O: I like that Troegs is making an imperial IPA (of sorts), I wish they would add an IPA to their everyday lineup, but until that happens I am happy with this offering. I understand it will probably just be a seasonal, but still a real nice beer. Keep them coming Troegs."
"O - classic tröegs. Easy drinking and full of flavor and a great value. What more could one ask for in an IPA."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, somewhat filling, nice kick, nice representation of style. This reminded me of a better balanced Gubna - some similar flavoring, but far tastier. For the price, I'll be picking up a few more of these."
"This beer poured a clear light amber and formed a huge foamy snow white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus and pine. The flavor was of hops, caramel, citrus and pepper. The body was medium light and the finish bittersweet."
"A solid brew from Troegs. It didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed it more than the Scratches, and the price is very reasonable for whats in the bottle. If this becomes a year rounder, I could see me picking up a couple bottles a month, especially given the freshness of the Troegs stuff we see here."
"So glad they didnt just rehash or tweak Nugget Nectar. A great IPA, and at 7.5%, i hope it will be sold in six-packs."
"personally, i think an imperial pale ale is an IPA....just an alternative spelling of the abbreviation. i'd probably be a bit disappointed if this was their double IPA, but i am more than impressed with this IPA. recommended."
"Wish they would start 6 packing this one, big fan."
"Pours a bubble golden amber with good cap of white bubbles, good retention and sticky lacing. Scent is grapefruit and citrus forward with splashes of fresh flowers and pine, all backed by a lightly sweet and biscuity malt profile. Taste follows scent nicely with the bitter grapefruit and citrus rind notes, floral, grassy, piney and litly herbal notes also present in some form or another. Pale, lightly sweet biscuity malt provides a backbone and only a small touch of noticeable alcohol. Medium bodied, a touch bubbly, oily but clean. A very nice addition to the lineup... Not great enough to be a limited or seasonal, but should be a regular member of the lineup if Troegs ever decided to do so."
"O- Pretty disappointed in this one. I thought this one felt short of quite a few brews I've had of this style recently or I've just been drinking some of the most gnarley ones out there. Not really feeling anything DIPA about this one."
"O: Amazingly balanced, nice sweet character that really helps the whole thing shine. This is a great one."
"its pretty decent. I'd take their Nugget Nectar over this any day, any time of year, but this is pretty damn decent as it is."
"CHEERS!!"
"This beer is as confusing as using the IPA nomenclature for an Imperial Pale Ale. Darkish golden color, light caramel and leafy hop aroma. Thinnish medium body and a touch of sweetness that barely balances a big dose of grassy bitterness. Weak grassy hoppy middle which overides the malt character. Slight alcohol heat gives it a little spiciness. Finishes dry on the tongue and bitter on the palate. Can't tell if this is just an out of balance big pale ale or an IPA that fails to deliver hop flavor/aroma. Even on its own merits without the confusing naming convention, doesn't fare much better."
"the beer is a light golden color with a sticky, huge, white head. strong citrus hops in the nose and has """West Coast""" ipa written all over it from the start. Taste is a mostly bitter hops, though not as abrasive as some hop bombs. Bone dry finish. Malt backbone has hints pale ale malts, so maybe I'm starting to understand what they mean by """imperial pale ale""" rather than calling this an India pale ale, though the distinction seems minor and unnecessarily confusing. I'd call this a straight IPA since that's essentially what it is. Overall very solid """I""PA from Troegs though this is a beer that belongs in 6-packs (and probably year-round) rather than high-priced bombers though I'll enjoy the temporary treat for now."
"O- really nice brew here. Very tasty and well rounded. Make this seasonal or year round please!"
"I was quite impressed with this beer. Lucky to snag the last bottle at Wegmans in Malvern. The aroma is in your face with lots of pine and a bit of citrus. Taste is more of the same. The bittering lingers but is well balanced with a nice malt backbone. I like the name Imperial pale ale. It really describes the aroma/taste well. It is balanced like a pale ale but hoppy and strong like an india pale ale. Another winner from Troegs. I hope to see it around again (for now it appears to be an August offering only)."
"The beer is very pale for an """IPA.""" It is pale amber with a ring of white foam that deposits very thin lace on the sides of my tulip. The beer smells malty like graham crackers with herbal hops. The Citra and cascade seem to be masked by the earthier Mt. Hood hops. The beer tastes very bitter with a little herbal and lime leaf hops. The finish is dry and long lasting. The MF is a little thin. Overall this is an okay beer, kind of misleading to call this an IPA. This being a fresh bottle, less than 2 weeks since bottling, it is rather disappointing considering how hoppy and flavorful Nugget Nectar is compared to this rather pallid beer."
"Overall a strange appearance but an otherwise solid brew from Troegs."
"Sixty some odd ounces deep into a growler and still solid. The pour is fine good head great retention. Color is straw a bit cloudy and the color of IPA. Smell is lime pine and sweet caramel milk. Taste is more pine and plant with a lot of super sweet. Ithaca flower power mixed with troegs sweet hopback amber. Overall top notch."
"O- This is a beer that is hoppy and very easy to drink. I really like this beer, not as good as Nugget Nectar, but at $5 a bomber this is an IPA that I will get again and again when it is in season."
"O - Good DIPA, barely a DIPA though but solid. Definitely good for the price."
"After having a couple bottles of this the past week, I can say this is an excellent IPA. Troegs should consider making this part of their year-round lineup."
"O- I like it. Very hoppy, scathing bitterness, pretty dry finish. Not what I expected from Troegs, but it's worth checking out."
"O - a good all around beer."
"Taking each component individually is lackluster, but the overall sum of the parts is extremely drinkable and enjoyable. The previously mentioned beers pull off what I expect from an """Imperial Pale Ale""" better than this does. This was more of a citrusy, resiny light bodied west coast IPA, but I won't complain at the price and fact that they bottle date everything. Recommended."
"Overall good, typical west coast IPA with lots of resinous hops, pine, citrus, some tropical fruits, but not a ton, quite bitter. Its a good offering but still not quite the complexity and awesomeness of Nugget Nectar, but a tasty DIPA at that."
"Overall: This is a really nice IPA. I hope they end up doing this one again. The hop bitterness is wonderful with just enough malt in there as well. Definitely would have another."
"I love the balance of this one. It has a ton of bitterness, but also a surprising sweeter, cream malt undertone. Highly recommended!"
"O- Overall, this is another solid beer from the Troegs Brothers. I don't like it quite as much as Nugget Nectar, but it's definitely worth picking up. I know I'll look for this brew again, it's worth it."
"O - One of the best DIPAs I have had. Very well balanced. Not outrageously hoppy or bitter. Would DEFINITELY buy this again. Especially for $4.99/22oz!"
"O - This brew reminds me a lot of Myrcenary from Odell, fantastic brew! Thank you for sending this one my way as an extra StormKing47, you rock!"
"O: A nice beer but not one I'm going to turn to too often as there are quite a few IPAs at a better price point with more hoppy complexity (see FW Union Jack, Bear Republic Racer 5, Titan IPA, etc.)."
"The CPJ"
"This a very well balanced beer. I believe it is the better than all of the previous Troegs Scratch IPA series, although not as good as that wet hopped Citra IPA aka Scratch #35. The Troegner brothers did a great job with this one."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable IPA that I hope to see in 12oz bottles someday. Recommended."
"Overall – A very good pale ale that reminds me a lot of Dogfish 90 Minute but without the sweetness of 90 MIn. I think I prefer the 90 minute but this beer is good for a change of pace."
"My oh my, this stuff is just as good and drinkable as Nugget Nectar, though in a different way. Glad I picked up more than one bomber (which, at $4.99 in NJ was a steal!). Thank you, Troegs!"
"Beer is medium in body and great, if I hadn't kicked the keg I would have gotten it again. Beer is wonderfully hoppy, strong and has that chewy hop resiny back bitterness that I love in a beer. This IPA does it right balancing hops bitterness with hop flavor and only the minimal malt backbone. I want this in the bottle now."
"Definitely better than any of the Scratch IPA's I've had, this is one I will drink more of when I can."
"Eh... the taste. Not a perpetual drinker only because I was expecting something less sweet. Caramel backbone is strong. Any bright citrusy flavors that would have been are severely downplayed because of all of those residual sugars. However, the fruitiness is still quite present. The bitterness is not as smooth as I would have liked and I don't agree with the toasty caramel quality which makes it too rich for my liking and less refreshing. In the end, I've brewed much better IPAs despite being strikingly similar as far as character goes."
"O: This is a reall solid beer. Glad I was able to sample while super fresh!"
"Overall I have mixed feelings. In one hand if this was an Indian pale ale it would be the smoothest one since it's balanced and not too bitter. As apposed to the other it's the best pale I ever got my hands on. Regardless of what it is or what it's trying to be it's dangerously drinkable and a steal at $5.50 a bomber. Damn good beer."
"Overall – Honestly, I was surprised by the bitterness of this brew. It reminds me of a West Coast DIPA, which is a good thing. I love a big hoppy, piney, citrusy bitter DIPA and this does not let down. The low sweetness adds to the dryness of the beer, and does not overwhelm one with a sugar shock. A pretty good DIPA that I would have again. Thanks again Kevin!"
"O- Overall another very nice hoppy beer from Troegs."
"Given the low price point, and ABV at 7.5%, this is a huge winner. You can have more than one without bruising your tongue, wallet, or brain cells."
"A new, non-Scratch release from Troegs! And a hop bomb at that. Nice looking golden beer with a full head and ample lacing. First whiff reveals a truck load of raw citrus hops that makes me immediately regret buying only one. Palate is super fresh and hoppy with a perfect amount of pale malt to balance it out. Bitterness is there but doesn't overpower the palate. Very tasty IPA. I think Troegs found a winner here and a perfect fit to their seasonal lineup."
"A good attempt at a """double", even though this is not technically a double according to Troegs. The amount of pale malt used solidifies that. I guess im just looking for more bitter/pine taste which I've come accustomed to from troegs, but it's not here."
"light citrus starts it off, lots of pineapple and grapefruit coming off here. light though with hints of grass, nice touches of light malt mid palate. as you take the sip the first thing you notice is the light, crisp body and the clean, easy drinking nature, especially for the abv. it just drank soo clean. nice touches of grapefruit an crisp, dry hops bit the tongue and dry the palate out perfectly."
"Poured an Orange/copper color with a thin head, dissipated but kept a foam ring around the glass, only about 5 oz. Shared with 3 other people. Very tasty 2IPA. Aroma of citrus and some spicy hops. Some nice doughy malt to round it off nicely. I would like to get one of these all to myself."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. Ignore IPA on the label. This is not an India Pale Ale or a IIPA. As the label clearly states, it is an Imperial Pale Ale. That is the way this drinks. It does not contain the hops and citrus that one would expect from a traditional IPA or IIPA, it has more of a malt backbone as a Pale Ale would. When judging this beer for what it actually is, the flavors are balanced and complex. The sweet citrus blends well with the biscuity malts and finishes with just the right amount of bitterness."
"Bottle 8-11-11 (fresh!) Poured into a Bell's tulip. Looks exactly like apple juice with a white cap of head on it. The nose is malt dominant with soapy, flowery hops and a smell my wife calls """those candy hearts you get with the phrases on them""". I don't know exactly what she is talking about and yet I do. Not a huge fan of the nose. Flowery, bitter hops, a bready malt back, it almost tastes lagered some how. Not really a fan and surprised how much I don't like the hop profile for how fresh it is. Oddly bland for a really fresh IPA. Bitterness, but not in a fun way. If you try really hard, there is a pine presence, but mostly flowery. Nothing wrong with this beer - good mouthfeel and whatnot, but I don't like it. Also, Imperial Pale Ale for IPA? The definition of no errors, but distinctly average."
"This seems to be more akin to an India Pale Ale, however simply saying it's an over-hopped Pale Ale would do justice as well. However you wish to classify this beer, the bottom line remains the same: brilliantly hoppy, balanced and flavorful. If this is any indication of things to come from Troegs, I think we're all in for a real treat."
"O - This has changed categorization a couple times already, and I'm not sure why. Its an IPA, and even says so on the label. Not an APA, and not a DIPA. With that, I really enjoy the aggressive citrus hops with the touch of malt to back it up. Clean flavors, nice and bitter. I can only hops they make this at least a seasonal release, if not a year-round one."
"Reminds me of Scratch #37 or #38. One of the best hoppy beers I've ever had from Troegs."
"Overall this was a great beer that went down real easy for me, especially considering the strength and the massive hop flavors. I caution anyone who does not want an in your face hoppy IPA to stay away from the beer so us professionals can handle this bad boy. Bought this for $5 at the brewery and it was worth every penny. I hope I can find more up here in NY. Hats off to Tröegs for creating another fine beer!"
"Overall a great pale ale that I would love to have more of!"
"O/D-At $4.39 this is an exceptional value. This is my type of DIPA. Just a bunch of fresh exotic fruits. Exceptionally juicy. Wow... $4.39. Thank you Troegs."
"Overall, this is a very, very solid attempt and I am quite happy that this will seemingly be readily available at a very nice price point, though not quite as nice as having it in sixers."
"m/d - Sticky and full bodied. Definitely drinkable, this cool summer evening is helping, might be a different story if it was still 90. Overall a nice big IPA, I think it's priced right, probably a little over hyped because of how little they made."
"Overall, i think this is going to become a flagship-type beer for Troegs, as if they need another. This is just excellently done! Wow!!!"
"22 ounce bottle bottled on 8/11/2011, so this one is nice and fresh! Served in a pint glass as recommended on Tröegs website page for this brew, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops (grapefruit, tropical fruits, orange peel), along with some pine hops and bready/grainy malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like citrusy hops (grapefruit, lemon and orange peel, tropical fruit), pine and floral hops, and some bready malt. There's also a long lasting bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and goes down easy. I liked this brew a lot. Not quite as much as I like Nugget Nectar, but it's still very, very good. For only $5.99 a bomber I think it's worth every penny, I'd definitely buy this again!"
"O: Another excellent beer from Troegs on par with Nugget Nectar! Juicy and mouth watering with a lot of hop flavors. Beautiful citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hop-heads will love this one. I could drink this all night."
"O: Troegs' taste profile was most evident and I would be describe this as """Citra Nectar.""" - Get it? lol"
"The taste is much like the smell. Finishes with a lingering sweetness. Good drinkability. I could have this anytime, and while I prefer Nugget Nectar, this is a great hoppy beer."
"O: I have to admit I wasn't the biggest Tröegs fan, this may have changed my mind."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, sticky and aggressive on the palate. I've come to expect greatness from Troegs, and this is another hit for me - I hope this eventually becomes a more regular release."
"I was looking forward to trying this one. I mistakenly thought that Troegs made a new IPA, but found out that the I was for Imperial, not India. Why doesn't Troegs make an IPA anyway? At any rate, I poured it into one of those bumpy pint glasses. Nice fluffy head, with a light, golden color. Interesting hops smell with some sweetness. Kinda reminds me of Nugget Nectar. Wonder why? Hmmmm. This tastes kind of like a Nugget Nectar light. Hoppy but not overwhelmingly bitter. Very enjoybable and the alcohol was very well hidden. I will grab another one or two for sure."
"Big 22 ounce bottles got my case for 35 bucks for 12 bottles not bad. I really wanted to try Troeg's new offering. Pours a pale golden honey tinged hue pretty interesting looking IPA, pale color with a slight chill haze. Head forms a bright white pale color with thick even bands of lacing dwindling down the sides of my chalice. Aroma has a nice pungent citrus base of hops with some tropical and pine elements close behind. Really sweet sugar coated hop nose, basically hop candy with a nice biscuit breadiness to it. Flavor I guess we should remember kids their calling this an imperial pale ale, not an imperial IPA but it is labeled Perpetual IPA. A bitingly hoppy, mildly bitter experience presents with some warming alcohol and layers of hop oils carrying pineapple, citrus grapefruit, very flavorful profile amongst the big beer package of a 7.5 percent ale. Luscious layers of hop oils build up to a medium bodied ale flowing nicely. Drinkability is solid a beer I will share with friends I'm not sad that I did invest in a case."
"O- HOMERUN from John and the boys at Troegs. This is one of the most balanced pale ales I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. I know this will get knocked down as it gets traded out to other states, but I had the sincere pleasure of consuming this beer the day it was bottled. It is a pleasurable experience from how refreshing it is to it's hop bite, touch of sweetness and light dry finish. This is a dangerously drinkable beer that I could see being consumed by the gallon. I hope this is converted to a year round because it will curve my dependence on Nugget Nectar! Seek it out and enjoy!"
"Perpetual is a great beer. One whose sum is greater than its parts. Picking it apart and breaking it down into categories does not do it justice. Enjoying the beer as a whole is where you can most appreciate it. Tremendously drinkable, The bomber is disappearing without much effort. Well done Troegs, Cheers!"
"Overall -- I like this more than any of the pilot Scratch IPAs that lead up to this. Really nice, and for the price, you're a sucker to pass this up. Hopefully six-packs are on the horizon."
"7.5 apv is not too odvious..this beer is quite drinkable..worth picking up..."
"I REALLY like where they are going with this beer. It had that sort of bright, fresh, crisp, and clean hop profile that I really enjoy in a lot of my favorite APAs out there. While the flavor profile screams DRINK ME, DRINK ME, the ABV unfortunately holds this back just enough to keep it from being what I would consider thirst quenching. I realize that this is an Imperialized version, but for me, if they could just find that sweet spot in the middle between the flavors and alcohol, this would really be something special."
"D - Another success from Troegs... Not only is this a great beer, but it's an extreme value as well... Bursting at the seams with hops, but never overpowering... Sophisticated and worldly... Glad I picked up a couple of bottles..."
"Now, IPA in this instance means Imperial Pale Ale, and not India Pale Ale. However, I just can't grasp that. Nor can I grasp how it's categorized as an APA. This sucker's an A1 hop bomb. Pours with a thin, wispy head. As soon as you pop the cap, you'd swear you were drinking a bottle of bud. The kind variety...not that bullshit. Wow. What a smell. It's much stronger out the nose of the bottle than poured into a pint glass, but man is it strong. The taste is marvelous. A very hop heavy effort. This is right there with the best of 'em. The mouthfeel is marvelous. You could swish and gargle with this and never get tired of it. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers...and certainly a top 2 Troegs beer. Right there with Nugget Nectar. If this is limited, get it while you can."
"Troegs hit a homerun with this one. This is definately a contender for a year round brew."
"22 oz. bottle from Pinocchios (in Media, PA) poured into a pint glass. Appearance was dark gold with a finger of white head which settled to a coating. Lacing was light but lasting. Nose was citrus hops up front with elements of floral and grassiness and spice. Taste is a very nice and refreshing - citrus, some bready yeast, mild bitterness and caramel sweetness. APA? Nah… this is an IPA taste for sure, but like most of my favorites - even with a refreshing bite, still overall quite nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium, mildly carbonated, and on the sticky side. At 7.5%, this is (carefully) sessionable. I am pretty excited about this beer. Nugget Nectar is our finest right-coast IPA ( I know, I know…not how Troeg's classifies it) but with limited (seasonal) availability. Now they have filled some of the void! Try this again - are you kidding? I am on my way back to the fridge RIGHT NOW!"
"D - Perpetual IPA is easily better than all of the recent Scratch IPA offerings (save for #35, the fresh hop Harvest Ale). For all intents and purposes, this IS an IPA regardless of what they want to call it. I found the hop profile to be quite complex while the brew still retained a balanced flavor. I'm glad they decided to make this a regularly available beer!"
"This brew is medium bodied with a modest to light level of carbonation. Fairly easy drinking for 7.5% but the alcohol is there and hits with a warmth and flavoring expected of that strength. It is aggressively hopped (does that even need to be said?) Overall a pretty good offering. This is as over hopped as Nugget Nectar is for its """style""" to the extent that it is outside the normal realm. I don't know if calling this an Imperial Pale is a joke of sorts or if """IPA""" is ambiguous. I guess """India and Imperial""" are interchangeable."
" The taste is definitely and IPA thorugh and through -so much herbal citrus and slight tangerine sweetness from the hops with moderately high bitterness, yet the flavor of the hops is the star with slight tropical tinges from the Citra yet some lemony aspects from the Bravo and gentle floral component from the cascade in there. I love how full and expressive it is. the malt is just there as a backdrop to pin all the vibrant hop flavors upon, very dank herbal and almost peachy at times with a gentle juicy hop tinge -an incredible amount of hop flavor which I am sure will get compared to Nugget nectar, yet it leaves no doubt this is the IPA they have been working hard to achieve with lots of practice blending on the scratch IPA series leading up to this. Overall it is great -Chock full of hops of the American high alpha ilk which should please anyone who likes dank, juicy and still moderately high in bitterness too. I enjoyed the drinkability of this most -a well crafted IPA."
"O - This is one bitter hop bomb of a beer that will satisfy any hop head. In fact, had this been sampled when blindfolded, I would swear it's a West Coast beer. The East Coast is rising to the extreme IPA challenge and this one ranks right at the top of the list in perceived bitterness, I'm really digging this beer. Definitely worth going out of the way to seek out, this is WAY over the top when compared any of the other beers I've had from Troegs and they've done a darn good job of designing a tremendously lopsided beer. Well done Troegs, could you PLEASE add this to your regular rotation?"
"ADDED NOTE: I agree with Slate, and would also not the brewer calls this an IPA. Should not be classed as an American Pale Ale"
"O - This is exactly what the name says...Imperial Pale Ale...a great hop presence and flavor with an equally balancing malt bill...the flavors play off of each other perfectly"
