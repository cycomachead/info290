"Just too hop forward for me. No smoothness in this beer. Hops and nothing else. Blah!"
""
""
""
"The end of my drinking day.  This stuff pours a mostly clear amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweetbread, mild booze, sweet resin, candied grapefruit zest, and a twinge of red apple.  The taste brings in more of the same, the sweet malts and fruity hops really making for a treacle-y sweet flavor profile for most of the time spent on my tongue.  Near the end, some dank grass shows up to provide a bitter bite for us.  The body is a lean medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this is too big and sweet for its own good.  It's not a bad beer by any stretch, but it was a bit of a chore to work through."
""
"Popped the top and just didnt' smell right? Maybe give it another try..."
"O: Boom! This is unbelievably hoppy - a true palate wrecker. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour are stuffed to the gills with notes of pine, weed and grass. Underpinned by subtle caramel malt. Nice body. An intense experience; only hop-heads need apply. If IBUs are your thing then seek this out."

"O: A really solid DIPA from a brewery that specializes in West Coast hopiness! Of the four staple IPA's that Green Flash offers, I found this one to be better than West Coast, but not quite as amazing as Palate Wrecker. Probably pretty even with Hop Head Red for me. Definitely worth trying if you haven't had it."
""
""
"A great full body hoppy delicious beer"
"Not a bad ipa by any means... but considering that it's a """triple ipa""" it didn't pack the extreme hoppy/high ibu taste I was expecting. I'd defer to green flash's palate wrecker before this one"
"taste follows the aroma, but a bit milder than the aroma."
""
""
""
""
"Great aroma, full body ipa. Very robust and delicious."
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty decent stuff, a bit on the weaker end for a triple IPA but that's not a terrible thing as there isn't that much of an alcohol bite to it that are typical of triple IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A more or less genial double, disguised as a 'triple' IPA.  With its well obfuscated 20-ish proof alcohol, I guess one can't really complain all that much, especially given the big hop and malt 'hire me now!' presentation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer.  Lots of hops as expected, but still easy to drink."

"Notes:  They pulled it off.  This was very good!"
""
"Too much pine overwhelms the other flavors"
""
"Mouthfeel is prickly from the carbonation and hop resins. Slightly chalky. Makes the nose and sinus cavities tingle. This is a beast of a beer and the hop flavors are rather unique at times, going beyond the typical citrus and tropical elements although these are present and accounted for. Obviously some prior hop experience is a must in order to fully appreciate. Its a hot one from hops and booze perspectives. However, I could have enjoyed another, which must be testament to some degree of restraint from the fine folks at Green Flash."

"I was very impressed by this one. I got it in a growler to take to a dinner party. It pours a golden color with a thin head. Aroma is citrusy and piny; the hops hit you right away. Wonderfully balanced taste. The strong hops will certainly satisfy the hops head ; a great dry bitter hops finish that leaves you wanting more. Yet, there is a sweet malt backbone that I like to balance out the hops. Great feel. Nice stinging carbonation, medium body and quite drinkable. I had like 3 of them and felt quite all right afterwards;)"

""
""

"Pours and orangy opaque with medium to light white head. Smells as you would expect, citrusy pine and sweetness. Opens up predominately pine up front fades to citrus and a good malty sweetness to finish. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky but not off-putting. No alcohol burn present, only slightly boozy. Overall I love it. A huge dose of piney goodness and sweetness to balance. My kind of big IPA. I can understand how the palates of those who don't walk on the wild side of flavor-town might be overpowered by this big luscious beauty. But if you like to get jiggy with the hops....if you like Hoptimum, Resin, Gemini,  then you don't wanna miss this one."
""
""
""
""
"A huge hop experience that manages to be perfectly drinkable. Make that sippable. I think people who crave the biggest hop brews should try this. I have tried all the Green Flash regular brews but this one has escaped me. I'm adding it to the shopping list when I run out of my stash of Stone's Enjoy By 12-31-14. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach."
""
"Big DIPA (or Triple IPA as they call it), I liked the fact that is relatively not too malty balancing towards a spice piney and tropical hop profile. As great beers it sure improves through the degustation, I had to keep raising its score. A must for hop addicts."
""
"First taste will grab you by the booboo! Could brew that you don't want to consume too fast."
""
"Smell for me dictates taste and for this one, not a good thing. Rotting fruit? Glad I tried it but wish the store had it as a single. One time deal on this one. No date info so no idea on freshness. Don't usually buy IPAS without dates. Took a chance. At 10% it does the job. That's about all I can say"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite DIPA, (or Triple I suppose). Very piney and citrus flavors and aromas going on. This one is NOT a malt bomb it is extremely bitter but balanced, which an ipa should be... Awesome!"
""
""
"This is a beer to experience.  Definitely one  to try out when you're feeling adventurous and or needing to feel numb.  I really enjoyed this beer the first time I tried it; the second time I just thought the IBU's were overpowering.  This would be a good beer to drink while smoking a cigar.  Overall I'd say this is a good beer when you're in a bold mood and still want to relax."
""
""
""
""
"Just a solid beer all around.  Wouldnt really buy it again but its solid."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is where things get interesting. The 100 IBUs announce themselves well. But the hop profile changes. While pine resin is indeed there, there is also a real lovely grassy-anise flavor. That was cool. Finishes more lime than lemon... and of course a nice boozy warmth. Not to syrupy for a 10.1 ABV. I would imagine that this will be on tap at Raglan and Queensland Public in San Diego..."

"cant wait to get my hands on one of these again, awesome gold color, very bitter crisp hoppy aroma with strong tropical fruity notes of citrus then hits you with a nice pine in the middle and lite burn on the end as you would expect from a big IPA."
""

""
""

"Underrated, Green Bullet is a very fine beer.  Triple IPA is a bit of a misnomer as this is smack dab in DIPA country.  Not nearly as sweet as some triple IPAs can be, it's perfectly balanced with citrus, tropical fruit and pine doing the waltz on your palate.  Bitterness muted, this beer is extremely drinkable for the ABV.  World class, yet approachable and simple IPA characteristics..."
""
""
""
"A total hop bomb....if that's what your looking for, get this. Good head, great golden color and minimal lacing. Citrus, melon and a bit of spice on the nose. Taste is the same with pepper being the spice. Mouthfeel is full with a bitter finish. Overall its a really big beer with a lot going for it....just not my cup of tea."
""
""
"Poured from 22oz bottle. Beautiful amber color; pleasant aroma mixed with malt and hops. One of my favorites. It's a big IPA with big hops, but smooth and balanced. An easy drink for such a big beer."

"Great well rounded, nicely hopped Triple IPA"
"Great beer!"
""
""
"For me, I love it."
"Overall, it's a big beer with lots of hops, pepper and alcohol.  Not for the faint of heart.  But I like it."
"Turbo IPA. Bitter but good. Grapefruit and citrus flavors. Huge head!!"
"The 100+ IBU's grab your attention but do not overwhelm. Very good and a must for any hophead."
"Overall - Really an excellent DIPA (okay, it's labeled a """triple ipa""") that has a assertive flavors with nice complexity and balance. Really nice transition from tropical sweetness to floral  to a nice resiny pucker, just begging the next quaff. A must try imho."

"This is close to a perfect beer for a hop-head like me. The tropical mango and pine sit on the palate ever so gently, building to a hot, hoppy finish. The '100+' IBU is much deserved on the finish, as this beer is generally only recommended for those like IPAs and then some. If I could have this beer every day, I would, I not for the 10.1% ABV.  I would recommend many beers from Green Flash Brewing (more ratings pending.)"

"Pouring a clear copper with a dense, white head with nice retention and little lacing, this looks solid. The nose is big, pungent, spicy and mildly green with hops dominating. Mildly soapy and oily wit some resin, there's plenty of tropical fruit, melon , caramel and honey. Malt character is noticeable bit clean. Solid. The palate opens with a big, bruising bitterness, pungent, resiny, piney, oily and fruity. Surprisingly, this isn't astringent, which is nice.  Mango, pineapple, papaya, melon, caramel, toffee, mildly burnt toast, spicy garlic and honey are present. Bitter, pungent resin on the finish with a mild sweetness, this is a bruiser. Solid"

"Personally thought taste was two thumbs down. Tasted bit whiskey like.  I would say for those looking for a beer with a potent taste this could be it"
""
"Awesome DIPA that will put you on your ass.  Citrus-y and a little spicy.  A little more syrupy than I'd like, but not among the worst offenders in this category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In spite of the ABV, I found this quite drinkable, not too heavy for a 12oz. This really pops of fresh citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  Is the west coast as bitter as their beer?  I'm going to find out some day as I visit all the breweries up and down the coast."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  There is a lot of hop power in this but it has a nice finish that isn't as resiny, or sticky as similar beers.  I think I enjoyed this more than palate wrecker."
""
"A dank and slightly boozy aroma...hmmmmm. Surprise! It tastes nothing like it smells. Loads of pineapple, mango, and a hint of spice. The slight thick booziness is offset by a good bitterness. Really nice for a brew with a high ABV. I'm a fan."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good DIPA and hits the style well.  I don't pick up what these New Zealand hops they tout on the label offer that American hops don't.  A bit pricey too.  Give it a try.  I might again next year but no more than a 4 pack because of the price"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2.6/5: The green bullet misses its target by several hundred feet"
""
"Overall: Good.  Not an everyday beer.  This will wreck your palate more than palate wrecker.  Which I suppose is appropriate since I have poured it into my palate wrecker glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O:  A very well made and heavily hopped IPA.  Great flavors and excellent complexity."

"This looks great, a sunset orange with a one inch cream colored head.  The smwll is all tropical fruit and resin, as I guess a triple IPS should.  The taste is better balanced than I would have thought with all the IBU's and alchohol.  Lost of resin and pineapple in the flavor, but the 10.10 alchohol is a tad harsh.  All in all, good but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was very smooth, easy drinking, start to finish"
"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought it was a very average example of a Tripel IPA, it had some big hop flavors, but the good aspects only showed up in the background and the flavors that stuck out the most weren't that great.  This beer didn't have good drinkability, it was a little smooth, a little warming, not too crisp, a little sticky, a little filling and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is more than enough for me, no way I would want to drink another one in a row.  What I liked the most about this beer this beer was the appearance, this was a pretty nice looking beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and drinkability, there weren't that good and they really held this beer back from being as good as it could be, the sweetness and green onion hops were my biggest problem with this beer.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's very easy to find a better tasting strong hoppy beer.  I wouldn't recommend this beer, it just isn't a great example of the style, but if you like lots of sweetness and green onion hops it may be worth a shot.  All in all I didn't like this beer, it just wasn't for me and it got hard for me to find the good in this beer the more I drank it.  It reminds me of the Devil Dancer that was released a couple years ago that was very green onion like.  IT's now my least favorite Green Flash beer and my least favorite Tripel IPA.  Better luck next time guys, this beer just isn't for me.  I'm starting to lose motivation to try new beers from this brewery, I keep on getting disappointed."

"Poured from a 12oz into my snifter. Excited to try some of these NZ hops. Beautiful tangerine hue in the glass, very little head. Had wonderful, clean lemon and piney aromas... and I am stunned to say definite mango as well. I am not used to such a distinct 'citrus' smell, it is usually a bit more general of a smell to me. Mango. The mango notes were also in the taste, along with a harsh bitterness (100+ IBU after all, but in a good way), a fresh piney hit, and not a bit of sweetness. Hop heavy. Hid the ABV very well. Clean and refreshing mouthfeel, medium. Very good feel for a DIPA. Such a great nose, I really like this. Will have to buy again some time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma on this one is very pleasant. Taste is very hop-bitter forward, nice malty support, this is very enjoyable, was $11.99 a four pack, price supports the 100+ IBU's that wil light up your palate."
""
""
""
""
"Boozy, hot, pineapple bomb"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice sticky, resinous sipper. Love the sweetness at the finish, which adds complexity. If you love their West Coast IPA, this will be its step-up, beefier brother. It's intense, but with some balance from the malt sweetness. It's a big, quality example of a West-coasty IPA with a boozy kick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: the 'triple' part is, in my mind, wholly attributable to the medicinal-strength alcohol character that doesn't always poke through cleanly, but when it does, likely kills all the germs in your mouth as well as fights gingivitis... all-in-all, this is wonderfully constructed and elegantly smooth... just lovely!... up there with and perhaps finer and certainly more alive and flavorful than ol' PtY"
"Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's certainly not the """triple""" IPA they claim, but a hell of a beer anyway. A nice slow sipper that will please anyone with a sweet tooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a barely clouded orange-amber with a thick creamy white head. The head settles down to a light disc and leaves some tight sticky lacing. The aroma is mild but with some nice fruity hops notes. The taste is"

"Beer was excellent! I'm getting another after work"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Definitely an interesting beer with a good amount of complexity between the wide array of tropical fruit flavors, initial dank hops, and bready/caramel/toasty finish.  A little intense on the hop bitterness and the hop flavors are a bit off to me.  Overall, its a good beer, but it has a few noticeable drawbacks for me personally.  Certainly worth the try though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- my local distributor hyped this up to me but I feel it is overly alcoholic and doesn't do enough to be an enjoyable ipa...my hop fix is temporarily appeased but not satisfied and the syrupy feel doesn't help it's cause"

"An unusual beer and a good direction for Green Flash."
""
""
""
""
""
"A unique, flavorful, slightly challenging (the less charitible might say """challenged""") beer - worth trying, though I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. Reminds me of some well balanced yet over-the-top home-brew I've sampled more than it does most commercial styles. Compared to Green Flash's other offerings, I'll stick with Palate Wrecker, especially for the price."
"Another great beer from Green Flash!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is worthy of praise as is most beers from Green Flash"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer has an excellent malt-balance for its 100+ IBU rating. It is not overwhelmingly bitter  and the malt has been used effectively without making it overly heavy. Green Bullet is very refreshing and the 10% ABV comes across in a very subtle way. My verdict: a very well-made beer that is a nice tangent from the typical American Imperial IPA style."

"Lots of hop aroma. Basically, all I smell. Poured with a one inch white head and a light orange color. Nice hoppy, hoppy, hoppy taste. Also, light tasting, fruity flower taste hits the top of your tongue. Pretty good."

I have been intrigued by the possibilities of such varietals as Pacific Gem and Green Bullet for some time and I think this ale gives me a good idea of what they can bring to the table. I would recommend this DIPA to both fans of the style and individuals intrigued by unique combinations of hops alike."

"I like the fact that, even if it's extremely hop-oriented (duh), there's a flavorful sweet fruity flash at the beginning of every sip, and after the bitter pine festival, in the aftertaste. From start to finish. Didn't live up to its aforementioned level of hops, but it was really good."

"O- Yeah, this is a great addition to the Green Flash Brewing portfolio. Strong bitter hops dominate this one as they should. But there is a pleasurable malt backbone that balances this brew out. I will definitely seek this brew out again in the future. If you like hop forward ipa's with a malt presence then this is the trip IPA for you."

"I love this beer!  Bright, crisp and clean, and very well balanced.  Not a bit of funkiness as found in some other imperial IPAs (like Ska Decadent and Sneaky Pete).  I can't say enough good things about Green Bullet and highly recommend it!"

"A very slick mouthfeel. Okayish drinkability. Not my cup of tea, so to speak."
""
"On tap at Toronado (SF) in a tulip. This looked great, cloudy and orange with a decent head. The smell is strong pine and citrus but also sweet. The taste is strong pine and bitter at the front and really sweet at the end. The mouth feel is syrupy and there's a strong alcohol presence. Overall I think this beer completely missed the style. For a triple IPA, the sweetness of the malt should never dominate the beer. This is definitely my least favorite Green Flash beer."

"I feel like this is just a step below Palate Wrecker which may not be as big a beer. Even though it's an easy delicious ride."
"OVERALL: Despite it's hoppiness and high alc content, Green Bullet drinks pretty smooth. It has a very crisp feel to it and a complex layer of flavors that goes behind just a hoppy kick in the mouth."
"Overall a good DIPA. Nice flavor, if not a bit extreme. Not balanced. A bit too hot for my liking. But overall I still liked it better than many others entries of this style."
""
""
""
""

"This ale pours a handsome copper orange hue with a frothy white head that is long lasting and gives way to a nice lacing. The aroma Of this offering is hoppy abd citrusy bitter but not clean and fresh. There is a definite skunky note to this one; which is displeasing and off for the style of ale. The flavors follow suit. Hoppy and bitter but not so much that it rings out as a true triple. There is a disconjointed nature to this one between the hoppy bitterness abd the malty sweetness. It is a nicely crafted ipa but not one that I will return to often."
""
""
""
""
"O - I like hoppy IPAs but this one was hard to finish. Very strong and bitter and not necessarily in an enjoyable way. It's worth a try for anyone who likes double and triple IPAs, but there's better stuff out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-this is a really good, strong IPA. It definitely has an extra edge over most double IPAs. The more I drink it, the more bitter it becomes and the stronger the flavors come out. I really recommend this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good double IPA but needs more in the nose to make it great."
"To be fair, this was strong and one in a sitting would be more than enough. There was more than enough flavor to enjoy and while this wasn't """Triple""" in anything more than name, it's a good example of what a Double should be. Strong fruits, hop bitterness, and body combine for a tasty beer that almost rose up above its counterparts, but came up just a bit short. If you're into other offerings from Green Flash or similar breweries (Stone, Sierra Nevada, etc), this one won't disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good DIPA with plenty going for it."
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very strong kick, decent representation of style, this beer is an example of bigger not always being better as a I much prefer some of Green Flash’s other “weaker” IPA’s to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"As a Triple it was middle of the road for me. It reminded me a lot of Ommegang Brewery's Three Philosophers. So if you like that beer, you will most likely enjoy this one. I'm learning I'm just not a big fan of the triple in the first place so perhaps my rating is a little unjust, but for the price I paid, I was unsatisfied."

"The alcohol is really hidden on this one. Possibly a hint of booze on the back, but there’s tons of bitterness to hide it. It doesn’t taste this beer at all. It definitely warms going down. Definitely a good job at doing the triple IPA style. The highlight of this beer is the bitterness for the hopheads and how well this beer hides its size by being light and not too cloying."

"O: this beer lingered on my pallate my entire 10 minute walk home, and I only drank a 3rd of it. Just not an enjoyable beer worth ordering more than 4oz. I appreciate what they were trying to do experimenting with new hops and organic oats, but this is not a production beer."

"good use of malts to back up the high ABV, but the hops are way too subtle for me, I want my hops to kick me in the teeth. this is not a bad beer but a tripel IPA should bring a bit more IMO... maybe I am a hop snob, damn straight"
"O: decent, one of my favorites from Green Flash, though i haven't tried a lot from them. I'm a fan of dry hops, so that could be it."
"Overall: Solid beer but I would not call it a triple IPA. Imperial IPA sounds better but the punch from the hops doesn't come until the middle-end."

"Medium body with a blast of dry hop bitterness that lingers over tropical/citrus fruit and caramel malt sweetness into a bone dry finish.  Complex hop profile with dry, earthy bitterness and resinous oil/pine needle flavor followed by juicy tropical and citrus fruit sweetness.  Strong grapefruit, pineapple, mango and orange zest character balancing things out with much needed sweetness.  Sweet caramel malt backbone with honts of toffee, biscuit, hazelnut and slight dark fruit notes.  Some alcohol heat in the finish but overall the high ABV is decently masked.  In these high ABV triple IPAs the alcohol/ethanol flavored often kills off the hops but it's nicely integrated into the finish of this beer.  Complex, flavorful and decently drinkable for it's strength.  A touch too malty for my liking but still a very solid beer."

"Pours dark, cloudy amber color. Thin foamy head with small amount of lacing along the glass. Has a citrus, apple type of smell. Very malty taste with citrus. Strong piney hop finish. The malt persists throughout. Strong bitter aftertaste. There is a sweet aftertaste. Caramel maybe. Hides alcohol very well. Good for an after work wind down."
""
""
""
"Overall- one of my favorite IPA's around I love all of Green Flashes IPA's this one is very good"
""
""
""
""
"This is, simply put, a big walloping hop bomb, pure and simple, and tailor-made for hop-hounds. I enjoyed it, but overall this one seemed a little too heavy on the palate. Maybe I'll have to revisit it another time."
""
""
""
"Overall this brew grows on me with each sip. What i like best about it is the breadiness of the brew - that was totally unexpected. Give it a shot if you come across it."
"overall I think this coulda been better but it was enjoyable, I'd buy it again if i could get it for 2$ a bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O - Whether it's the West Coast IPA, Le Freak, Imperial IPA or the Green Bullet, I'm a happy man. The green bullet has all the features I like best in an IPA: huge citrus hops, subdued malts, and massive ABV. This is definitely one of my go to beers."
""
""
""
"O: Another winner for Green Flash. Lots of hoppy goodness blankets the substantial ABV. Not as drinkable as West Coast or as much of a hop bomb as Palate Wrecker (despite the TIPA designation), but a very good hoppy ale that somehow manages to conceal its punch."
"Recommended to me by the guy in the craft beer store (Hudson Vine) next door to my hotel in NJ. Opened the bottle and immediately smelled grapefruit. A great IPA (I'm a hophead), even better than Stone IPA, which I think is a great IPA. It's so well balanced that even at 10.0% ABV I couldn't sense the alcohol on the nose or on the palate. Plenty of hops, but so well balanced that they don't over power the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"mmh, alcohol"
""
"O: I had a Double Jack and this caught my eye. This isn't even close to Double Jack. There are plenty of other beers out there that are better. It's not bad but not up to the hype that my server made it out to be."
""
""
"Full bodied, oily, resinous, dry, with modest carbonation. Has a very bitter aftertaste. Not my favorite Imperial IPA, mostly due to the heavy onion and garlic taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's decent. Enjoyable but not something I'm going to rave about. Very, average I would say. Good flavors with nothing truly shining through and defining it amongst the better IIPAs out there."
"O: Huh, interesting. Very dank but not super bitter despite the """triple IPA""" label. Big ABV leads to a big balancing malt so overall this ends up being pretty easy drinking (especially for a 10% TIPA). Good showcase"
""
""
"O - good to try, not sure why it needs to be called a """Triple""" IPA. Probably wouldn't bother to buy it again."

"The taste begins quickly with breaded malts but those inimitable pine and earthy pound their way forward and take it over with a lingering, bitter finish. Alcohol is very well integrated. I would have this one again."
"This is a damn delicious imperial (which I say to avoid the double/triplecontroversy, hehe) IPA. I recommend you try it without delay. And that's all I have else to say."
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a great beer, although not too different from some many single or double IPAs in my opinion. The most noticeable differences were in the aroma, which was like a genie in the bottle begging to be let out, and the mouthfeel, which did not have an overdrying effect. A strong effort by Green Flash, but not a better product then their West Coast or Palate Wrecker."
""
""
""
""
"Green Flash is a great brewery. If this had come from a lesser name, I would probably think more highly of it, as backwards as that seems. It's a very good beer, but does not live up to the legacy of what I know these guys can do."
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely love this beer! Fantastic clean hop profile with enough sweet malt to nicely support the hops. Pours a hazy orange with a light head. Nice stank on the nose with strongly herbal hops. The taste replicates this with a deep bitterness joining in and a lingering light sweetness. The finish is long with spicy and piney hops and quite bitter- it just keeps going. Almost a bit prickly from the spiciness in the mouth. This is a superlative beer, and I'm surprised the ratings are so low overall. A definite hop-head's beer."

"Pours a deep amber, very clear with heavy lacing. Nose is resinous with sweet malts backing things up. Heavy pine, grapefruit, and a bit of caramel. Taste is heavily hopped, lots of bitterness with a solid malty backbone. The bitterness is cut out nicely by the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is heavy and lightly carbonated. Overall, this is a resin pine bomb with lots of sweetness. Not my favorite but very good."
""
"D: This wasn't as huge as the triple IPA name would make you think, but it was a solid double IPA using three unique hops. The scent and taste were great, although the body was somewhat weak. The finish was clean with well hidden alcohol, and the bitterness really wasn't very harsh. So it was pretty easy to drink. Nice brew."
""
"The aftertaste is bitter, but really nicely so, and you quickly become used to it, and numb to the big booze content. Dangerous brew. Put the car keys away."

"Atmosphere is really great. Dark hue, giant persistent and inconsistent head, tons of lacing. Nose is sweet and hoppy. Hops are not overly crisp, but more short and stout; with a little bitterness and citric acid. Syrupy and thick with a fleeting aftertaste. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"Overall: truth in advertising. This is no high abv American barley pretending to be a dipa (or triple ipa)."
""
""
"O: This may be the weirdest IPA I've ever had, let alone a purported Triple IPA. It was so very little flavor and aroma. I don't know if this was a bad bottle or what, but both of us that had pours from this bottle had similar observations. The aroma was so muted that if I closed my eyes, I wouldn't have been sure if there was beer in the glass. No off-flavors or oxidation that I noticed, or anything offensive…just a lot of nothing. Based on this bottle, I'd recommend avoiding this one. And I'm not motivated to go spend money for a second go-round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale orange-yellow with light colored head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is quite tropical, light malt sweetness and some pine as well. Taste is super damn bitter, the hop comes more pine than citrus. Good carbonation and body, but overall not a great brew in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and spicy herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, herbal, and pine flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that shows more of an intense hop presence in the flavors."
""
""
""
"If you like hops... I mean REALLY like hops, you owe it to yourself to try this monstrous, unbalanced green monster."
""
""
"O: Solid IPA - worthy of a try."
""
"Definitely good flavor, better than other harsh, acrid IIPA's, such as Hoperation Overload."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This big IPA successfully walks a fine line that brings it close to being a messy, kitchen-sink project without erring into such a tiresome realm. The smell hints at just such a fate, but the flavor profile delivers something more mature and metered--but still overtly hoppy. The hops cultivar is not widely known by name as one of the highly-sought New Zealand cultivars, and perhaps with good reason; it's profile is most comparable to the most sturdy and intense of West Coast (California) hops."
""
""
"Overall - This is a good beer I had been wanting to try. American barleywines are my favorite style right now and I wanted to see where this beer laid in terms of DIPA or American Barleywine. It's definitely on the DIPA side with an extra hop kick and some extra maltiness which I like. Good beer, different for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I wasn't expecting the strawberry/guava like sweetness, and I was hoping for more hops. I love just about everything this brewer does and I had high hopes for this one."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by 3/10/14. Pours a cloudy orange, with a one off white head, that leaves behind plenty of sticky lace. Smell passion fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, hint of hard candy, fresh pine, and earthy hops. Taste matches perfectly, maybe my palate is damaged because it is really well balanced, tropical with some grapefruit and pine threw out. Body is medium, perfect carbonation, not dry, and holy s--- is it drinkable! This is awesome. Not sure why they are calling it a triple and I really don't care."
""
""
"Overall: A very solid triple IPA. Definitely worth a try. A little sweet for me. I was hoping for more hops depth in aroma and a cleaner, more refreshing finish, but still an excellent offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not something you would throw back multiples of, regardless of the ABV., but for times when you're looking a big abrasive IIPA, this does the job nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Green Bullet pours a copper color with a large lacing head. There is a very hoppy aroma; very floral. The taste has a bold hoppy flavor, very very floral, but not bitter. While hoppy the flavors do not burn the palette; its a very easy drinking yet bold IIPA. Overall its fantastic, very flavorful, yet so easy to drink."

"O - Very tasty and unique Triple IPA."
""
""
"O - This beer has been getting a lot of mixed reviews, but I concur with it's current rating of """very good""". While the hop varietals used aren't my favorite, this is a damn tasty beer (way better than Palette Wrecker IMHO) with a surprising amount of depth."
"O - I usually love west coast grapefruit and pine IPAs, but this one missed the mark for me. It was way too sweet and sticky with not enough balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the most unique IPAs I have ever had, and it is very tasty as well. I think Green Flash nailed it, I challenge you to find an Imperial IPA that has a hop profile like this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not entirely sure what this is, but it's definitely worth a try. It's not really extreme enough to be a Triple IPA, but it is very interesting. The issue here is the booze. It is obvious to begin with, and it becomes hilariously obvious as it warms up."
"overall - certainly a big IPA, but the particular hop flavor doesn't overlyimpress my taste buds."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden amber color with an off-white head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is sweet malt and piney hops. The taste like the aroma is dominated by the hops creating a lingering bitterness into the finish. When you get past the hops, there is a sweetness from the malt up front. The mouthfeel is between light and medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a great hop bomb that is highly recommended if you are in the mood for some hops. There is no balance whatsoever, this is a West-coast IPA through and through."
""
""
""
"I did not love it"
""
""
"O - A strong beer, but seems like a different approach over many Imperials."
"I do have to compare this to a couple other New Zealand hop beers which in my opinion are just a tad better. However, this is a drinkable beer with having again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a big thick beer, definitely feels like a triple IPA, though not over-the-top bitter. The downside to this one is the slight onion smell and taste--not super strong but enough to be noticed."
""
""
""
""
"For an IPA this big, I'm surprised by the lack of balance. They must have put an incredible quantity of hops in this, or it must be really highly attenuated, to feel over-hopped at 10%. But it does. I like the melon, want more flavor beyond the pure, clean bitterness."
""
"This beer is huge on that green onion, dank hop flavor. It also does a great job of hiding the big ABV. This certainly is a monster DIPA with an orginal hop profile."
""
"The beer pours a clear coppery amber with no head or visible carbonation after a few minutes of resting. The nose is definitely reminiscent of some faded NZ hops, sugar sweetness, tropical weirdness, and booze. It drinks the same with some bite from the alcohol and hops upfront, a sweet middle, and pleasantly bitter finish. It's medium bodied, modestly boozy, bitter in both the taste and lingering finish - no citrus rind, little carb, adequate sweetness, and little acidity. This is tasty, but I'd rather grab schlafly TIPA, which is more drinkable, fresher, and costs less. I'll probably pass on this beer in the future, but it's decent."
""
"O - This is the third time I've had this beer. The first time, I liked it. The second time I hated it. This time, I really enjoyed it. Will have to try it again to really see."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very interesting and tasty. A complete change up to a typical DIPA(triple whatever). I like it alot, and if you want to know what other direction hops can go this is a good try."
""
"Overall this was a good beer and very enjoyable, but a little bit of a letdown since it was billed as a massive IPA. Don’t get me wrong, this is a solid beer that hides the alcohol masterfully and has nice malty balance to go with the hops, but it did not have the explosive hop punch I wanted. A good beer, but not a great beer. Lists """New Zealand Dry Hop""" on the label but there was not distinctive dry hop presence in this brew."
""
"The beer is clear and golden with a thin, bubbly white head. The aroma brings mint, cops, herbal tea, earth, mushrooms, citrus, pine, floral scents. A touch of alcohol in the nose. Hop forward with a mint tea character throughout. Alcohol is present but generally unobtrusive. Moderately low carbonation and tad sticky on the palate. Citrus, particularly oranges, soaked and alcohol. A solid beer, albeit best in small quantities."
""
"Drinkability is okay, it's interesting to see how far you can take the IPA, but at the end of the day, it's too far to really want to have another in a sitting."
"Overall - As advertised, hoppy to the max with alcohol warmth. Nothing fancy, balanced or special but does have a different hop flavor coming from im guessing the new Zealand hops. As usual another too expense brew from a great brewery. Worth a drink for sure but not worth the money."
""
""
""
""
"3.5 beer easy- not bad, not great."
""
"Golden body with fluffy head of foam and lots of lacing. The nose is fresh and excellent with lots of hoppy goodness. The flavor is complex as hell. Piney, citrus, tropical fruits galore with a strong alcohol presence making it known that this thing is 10% abv. Sticky mouthfeel in a medium body. Overall, an awesome DIPA. The complexity is outstanding and even with the alcohol presence, this thing still drinks very well."
"O: This gives the Imperial IPA a run for its money, but I'm personally more partially to the Summit hops in that one. Perhaps a tweaked recipe, just a bit more balance, can elevate this interesting beer to that level. Single hop using just Green Bullet?"
""
""
""
"O: I'm definitely a fan. I'll probably end up getting a few more. If you like the more intense IPAs, then this isn't going to bother you at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This triple IPA is different than any IPA that I have ever had. Complex hop and piney profile, and substantial bitterness. It seemed to get better once it warmed a bit. This one is definitely not for people that do not enjoy hops..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this would be much better if the alcohol was toned down. Rubbing alcohol character in the finish. I love Green Flash, but this was a bit of a miss for me."
"O/D: A one and done kind of beer. It's too sweet and too pungent, to the point where it's not entirely enjoyable, but still has some great flavors. Good for one of those """extreme""" styles."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good beer from Green Flash. This has a unique hop flavor but very good. Give it a try."
""
"Overall (3.75): I’m not 100% sure how I feel about this beer. I like it, a lot, but not so much for being a crazy D(T?)IPA as a really smooth, rich, hoppy sipper with a rich makeup. If I’m rating this according to how much I enjoyed it, I’d say 4.0-4.25; if I’m rating it to style, I’d say 3.5-3.75; so, I’m being conservative in my numerical rating. But I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, and it was definitely worth buying at least a single bottle of."
"In the flavor, herbal, piney and earthy, with some oranfe and grapefruit smoothy notes. Solid bitterness, as this big beer does not finish sweet. Malt is caramel like and adds to the body of the brew. Full bodied, smooth and satisfying. Carbonation is at a medium-low. Overall, this is a really good brew. Very hoppy and easy to drink despite the strength."
""
""
""
""
"TOTAL = 39/50"
""
"A nice take on the style, was hoping for a bit more wow factor from Green Flash. I would just assume stick to their IPA, this is more of a sipper that doesn't quite pop for me. Some hopheads will probably disagree. I might buy this again, but not totally in my hop wheelhouse"
""
""
"O-awkward beer, I confess I am not a huge fan of the style, but the flavors were unbalanced and tasted off, ?bad bottle"
"QUITE GOOD; NOT MUST HAVE!"
"O: Taste is obviously subjective, but the Nelson Sauvin hops are not my favorite. Having said that, this is a big delicious IPA with a massive grain bill and the IBU’s to match."
""
""
""
"Overall - One of the single best beers I have ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Dark earthy and heavy ipa with an alcohol finish."
"a huge ipa, showcasing the new Zealand hops, a great project this one. it pours hazy burnt orange color, little bits of yeast are visible if you strain the eye, but the overall appeal is lovely, under a robust inch of thick off white foam. the nose is quite bitter, tropical fruity, and full of zest. I smell an acidic mix of fruits from orange to pineapple, but there is a lightness and a brightness to this that is uncommon in such big versions of the style. its clean and sort of oceanic, a great mindset before the first sip. bitterness is obvious right away, and honestly most of the real flavor comes in the aftertaste, where minerals and piquant fruits marry beautifully. I don't get much pine as the label denotes, but I do get a unique hop profile, reminds me of a topaz single hop brew I had in saint Louis, but I know this is different. I am amazed how bitter it finishes for such a fruity flavor. it also comes across a lot lighter than 10.1% abv, although as it warms up its a lot more apparent. good carbonation and a sturdy body on this make it a nice fall ipa. its tropical vibe takes me on a needed vacation, and its alcohol to bottle size ratio allows me to forget all the stresses in my life. a nice escape this one. all green flash beers are brutally hoppy, and this one is the exclamation mark on the lineup. good good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really liked this, reminds me a lot of Stone's 17th anni. That said- 'triple ipa?' absolutely not. Feel quite a bit more like a double, no where near the level of beers like Simtra, Ruinten, or PtY in terms of hoppiness or alcohol. Anyway, picked this up in Sacramento last weekend, hoping some hits the shelves here in Nevada soon. Really like getting to try exotic hops!"
""
""
""
"O - just a solid take on the big ipa style. Green Bullet is tasty, beautiful, and balanced. It's definitely something worth seeking out again and just another fine example of how good Green Flash really is."
""
"Great beer. Well done. Keep the hype train rolling..."
""
"O: A little too aggressive with the bitterness and not quite as strong aromas and flavors from the hops while slightly showing it's 10.10% ABV makes this one a definite slow sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"TrIPA? Good DIPA. But honestly falls a little short in the potency department. Something like Enjoy By has a lot more hop freshness and punch. Still worth a drink though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this TIPA. Heh. Well worth a try if you want hops coating your mouth for hours!"
""
""
"O: Very good beer. Pleasant IPA. My first taste was filled with intensity, every one after was smooth and excellent. Refreshing. Hoppy."
""
"O: An impressive beer that shows off the tropical fruit character of the New Zealand hops and despite being ridiculously bitter is very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly a unique beer. The hops give a really huge resiny, woodsy spice factor, as well as a modest amount of sweet, fruit notes. A tad bit more balance between the two could have helped the taste, but I didn't rate it lower as it still works well for this beer. It holds the ABV well."

"Overall, an excellent brew. Some Green Flash beers I love, some I don't care for at all.This one makes the top of the list. Might well be the most drinkable double digit abv I've ever had, sessionable even, if I had a death wish. So watch yourself with this one. Three more in the fridge. How long can I hold out?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather resinous and boozy brew. If that is what you are looking for this is a fantastic choice but if looking for something easy drinking or balanced, then you may want to pass on it."

"Well balanced. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. Nice tropical and citrus notes but the onion-esque flavors throw it off for me."

"Poured a gorgeous clear amber with bubble trailing up the glass and a thin ring of white head. Very good looking IPA, classic in appearance. Scents of citrus pith, pineapple, grapefruit, tropical fruit, and pine. A classic West Coast IPA aroma. Taste is of bitter pine, grapefruit pith, a bit of a spicy hop flavor, strong levels of hop bitterness, though not Palate Wrecker level, with a nice sweet malt backbone. Bitter aftertaste. Very good, it's hop forward but not overwhelmingly so, served very well by the malt balance. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with moderate carbonation, about what I expect for a DIPA. Overall this was a great DIPA, it hit all the usual West Coast hop forward flavors, balanced with a bit of malt. I'd go back to it."
""
"All in all, it's good, but PLEASE give me Palete Wrecker stat!!!!"

"Not wild about this at first, but after an overly long warming period, this beer really cracked me upside the head, & the oil slick impression is one I have never experienced in a big IIIPA. Winner. Excellent beer. Happy to have y'all here!"
""
"Overall I'm impressed with this one. Real strong and serious triple IPA that isnt laden with malt. Give this one a shot."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A big ass TIPA from Green Flash, but one of the better Triple IPAs I've tried. That being said, it's still too aggressive for my tastes, lacks refinement, but for an out and out hop bomb, it's a solid offering."
""
""
""
""
"O: Just too much malt; sweet in a way that makes it hard to drink. Not terrible flavor, though; just sweet."
"O- I really dig this beer. I feel like this is what their Palate Wrecker should have been."
""
""
"O: Give me palate wrecker all day. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed. Dank and piney, but a bit one-dimensional and I wasn't a huge fan of the hop choice."
"O-Good 3x ipa that does not drink like a 10.1% beer. Could have a couple of these and not realize the intoxication until I would stand up. Very good offering from Green Flash."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a bit of fizziness before this settles to a smooth foamy feeling moving across the palate. Ethanol easily felt on the back of the throat and in the nostrils as warmth and burn, not exactly pleasing. Closes semi-dry, which is surprising as I would have expected something much drier with this many hops. Heavy stickiness remains on the lips and palate. Again, fairly average for the style, nothing surprising in a positive sense here."
""
"It's not far off from what I expected from Green Flash on a bottle that said """triple india pale ale.""" Hop heads will like it. Englishmen who think an ESB is a strong tasting beer, and who think that American IPAs are over-hopped abominations probably won't. It's a matter of taste on this one, and the taste is all hop-head-heaven."
"Overall: Disappointing. Not enough hop aroma or bitterness to balance out an off-putting booziness and somewhat boring malt presence. Gets better as it warms."
""
"A pretty decent TIPA (DIPA) but there are much better ones that I'll choose before coming back to this one. The hop intensity is definitely noticeable in this one but more hops does not a great beer make."
"O - This is a sipper imperial IPA yet it is relatively easy to drink. This is solid, but I'd choose others in this category before coming back."
""
""
""
"O: While I am an admitted hop-head and DIPA lover, I've never been much of a fan of the so-called Triple IPA category, though it is more so because the term simply doesn't mean anything than because I don't like over-hopped, highly alcoholic beers. Now, with that said, this beer is clearly nothing more than a DIPA, and a restrained one at that. The flavors are clean and pleasant, but aside from the alcohol, this beer really isn't packing much of a punch."

"Bomber from Tipples to my tulip glass. Pours a dark gold almost bronze color, clear, with a nice white one finger head. Definite pine on the aroma, with some nice floral citrus aromatics. Dank for sure. Malt profile provides some additional sweet on the smell. Big bitter pine on this one, but with a nice sweetness from the malt bill. Bitter is up front and all the way down the gullet. Big and slick mouthfeel but plenty of carbonation. Pretty big beer here with the high ABV. Solid DIPA, though heavier than I wanted today."
""
""
""
"O: Really good IIIPA! Not very balanced but i feel like that was the point. I'm actually really impressed by how close they got to an unbalanced mess and came away with a good brew! People have been trying to compare it to RuinTen but it truly is it's own beast!"
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear medium orange with one finger thick khaki colored heady with spotty lacing. Smell: pine, floral, nectarine, notes of earth and honey. Taste: pineapple, resinous, sugared citrus, nectarine and white grape juice, biscuit. Low delicate carbonation. Feel is syrupy, almost chewy. Intense."

"Overall, after drinking the green flash west coast IPA I thought I was in for a hop bomb with this and I was wrong... don't get me wrong its bitter and hoppy...but then it is so mellowed out by malt which was surprising. not what I expected from green flash but also not bad at all either...How to sum this up: its good and worth checking out for sure...get a single bottle...if your expecting a citrus bomb like the west coast IPA, don't go near this."
""

""
""
"D - I loved Palate Wrecker. This one seems like a bit of a mess."
""
"O- solid beer, I think it's a great example of the TIPA."

"O: Nice, well put together IPA. It's drinkable enough, all things considered, though too high of an ABV to actually drink very much of it."

""
"O: 4.0 A solid offering from GF. Not many triple IPAs out there, always excited to find one on tap. Much prefer this over the 'silver bullet'."
""
"Green Lantern, er, uh, Bullet Triple IPA is okay, but not special. Fair aroma, nice taste and strong buzz, but you could never drink more than one at a sitting... and you'd be lucky to finish a full 12 oz. before it got warm. I will finish off the four-pack I bought at the recommendation of the store owner, but I will not be buying any more."
""
"Edit: just ordered a West Coast IPA on tap from a local establishment and it tasted so off that I went and told them the taps must be dirty. They told me me they accidentally gave me Green Bullet instead. Talk about a blind taste test!"
""
"O - Happy to have tried this. Can really only seeing myself having this on special occasions though due to the high ABV. I would recommend."
""

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/10/2014. Pours moderately cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge mango, passion fruit, pineapple, tangerine, peach, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of tropical/citrus hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of mango, peach, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Good amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, peach, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; and no cloying bitterness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! All around great complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"D: I gotta say I am a little disappointed with this brew. not impressed with these new Zealand hops or what green flash has done with them. green flash does some beautiful things with hops and this really fell short."
""
"The brew poured a clear amber with a small white head that instantly gave off the aroma of hops. The aroma was of tropical fruit and dank hops with a hint of pine underneath that gave it a spicy aroma. The first taste had citrus rind hops with more of the dank tropical fruits and a spicy pine finish. The hops were appropriately aggressive and leave you with a strong bitterness on your tongue. The malt did give the Green Bullet a somewhat sweet finish, but the overload of hops definitely kept it in the background. The brew was easily one of the hoppier beers out there and the huge hops keeps the high alcohol at bay. If you want an assault on your palate the Green Bullet will definitely leave you in hoppy happiness."
"While I'm not a huge IPA fan, this beer surprised me, with its smooth, fairly mellow hop taste and great feel. Very refreshing and very easy to drink. Quite shocked at the abv for its smooth and balanced taste. This could easily be a regular drinker for me, although I admit the hops do get to be a bit fatiguing for my taste, as nearly all IPAs do for me. Still, an excellent example and one which shows DIPAs (because of abv?) seem to suit me more that a single motor-hopped brew. Good job, Green Flash."
"O - Nicely done but incredibly boozy."
""
""
""
"Interesting and unique take on the style. The aromas are weird and it carries on to the flavors. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it just takes a bit of getting used to. It's well crafted and I can appreciate it. Huge Green Flash fan here, but this isn't one of my favorites from them, but it's still good. I can still dig it. Very solid stuff nonetheless. I can definitely see the appeal."
"O: Another solid outing from Green Flash. A well made, easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent hop profile but pretty strong alcohol, not well hidden at all for 10%. Hops are either trumped by the strength or muddled, nothing really stands out for me as great."
"Overall, I was hoping for a bit more complex hop profile from this one, but I'm still pleased with it. A very strong, very hoppy, very bitter beer. Awesome stuff for a hophead."
""
""
"Overall- Average at best and a failure for its style. Unless you like pine bombs, I would not purchase this. It's only redeeming quality is the high alcohol."

"Overall- Pretty good beer, a bit sweet for being a """triple IPA""" but did have a good bitterness to back it up."

"O) This is a pretty nice beer. As for high octane IPAs I would compare this with, I enjoyed this more than The Oracle, but like Devil Dancer just a teeny bit better. I will say, if you play fantasy football, and by chance you just lost your best player to a season ending foot injury. Well then, a Green Bullet goes nicely with scouring the waiver wire, and sulking about your season being over. Glad to recommend this brew..."

"This beer is how I imagine a pine tree tastes. It was that bad. It is not like any other Imperial IPA I have ever tasted. No idea if it was a bad batch? The color and smell were decent, however the taste was awful due to the overpowering pine taste. If you are a fan of that sort of taste then look no further as THIS is your beer!"
"O-One of the the better """Triple IPAs""" as the alcohol was't over powering, but still not much need for it."
""
""
"Overall (4/5): Green Bullet is an outstanding beer in its own right, despite not quite reaching the level of greatness that other hoppy beers in Green Flash's lineup do. I heartily recommend it, since it is certainly tasty and unique enough to make it worth buying. Enjoy the hops!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like this beer, it just seems closer to a higher strength single IPA than a double like dorado/dugana etc that I was expecting"
"Different batch... Found a single with a different date... This batch is way better then the first 4 pack I got. Now the beer actually matches the description, good stuff! Tropical, sweet malts, piney bitterness.... As advertised. Wish I would have bought a 4 pack this time instead of the first shipment."
""
""
"O: A unique hop profile with tons of character. A bit rough around the edges, and a bit boozy, but I thought this drank rather well and definitely kicked my ass."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good. Great even, but not world ending. I was afraid that the malt and alcohol would dominate like so many 10+ abv beers, but Green Flash does a good job of keeping this one hoppy and surprisingly light. Still, the flavors are somewhat muted and the tropical/floral highlight is missing that hint of citrus. Still very solid overall."
"O: Triple IPA? Pretty ridiculous label. But, I'm glad I got to try this."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not at all what I was expecting! I drank this behind a Boneyard Notorious and I was supremely letdown. The combo of hops/malt in this beer just did not do it for me. The beer had a weird feel and taste and I felt the hops were a bit muted. The body was there and I do not object to chewy IIPAs but this was just weird."
""
""
""
"A friend split a 12oz bottle of this with me, thank God I didn't buy a bomber or four pack. Yellow orange color, translucent, good head and lace, looks nice. Aroma is like mango fruity hops but in the very background I caught a whiff of something I don't like and I suspect it is the dreaded Summit hop. Flavor followed suit with just the mildest note of garlic and then the finish was just awful. If they didn't use Summit then there is some New Zealand hop which is just as bad. Gross."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent beer. A thought a little too much palate scrapping bitterness that didn't let the hops shine thru. Still a drinkable beer."
"Serving type: 12oz bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everyone else went on & on about all the attributes, I got nothing more of value to add. Bottom-line: falls short on the sum of the parts, especially balance/integration of flavors: 2-dimensional, and in the wrong dimensions. Agree with whoever described the harsh MF."

"Enjoyable. The smell along with worth it."
""
""
""

"anyway, it's alright..."
""
"It really tastes like an imperialized West Coast with a slightly modified hop profile. Decidedly west coast in take and style and it does it well, but I'm not sure what makes it triple other than the booze."
""
""
"Third, for the abv and hop level of this beer, the drinkability is very well done. This isn't nearly as syrupy as I would have expeceted and its relative drinkablilty shows a lot of skill on the part of the brewer. Give this one a shot for sure."
""
""
"Overall: it's really good. Being only slightly higher in alcohol than palate wrecker, in not seeing the """triple", but it's still great."
"Overall: Another great imperial West Coast IPA. Good mix of citrus and grassy hops with a nice caramel malt undertone."
""
"O: There's a lot of great and exotic hop taste packed into this beer. Not as bitter as I was expecting, considering that this is being billed as a triple IPA, but the novelty and complexity of the hop profile really makes the beer. The presence of the silky smooth malt body is certainly noteworthy too, and it complements the hops wonderfully. The alcohol is felt, but this still drinks very well for a beer of 10.1% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like this beer. It is well-balanced and tastes good. It's not as destructive as Palate Wrecker, which I liked, but I like this better. This beer is more considerate of my taste buds!"

"Overall - West Coast TIPA, this thing is an absolute monster and all around solid. Would recommend giving this beast a shot!"

"Definite must try."

"Mouthfeel has medium to high carbonation high bitterness and huge amounts of oils. All this gives is a medium body and a sticky feel"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: thick mouthfeel like i'd imagine. A good amount of carb makes this one easy to drink despite the amount of hopping."
"One of the best beers I have tasted in a while. Up there with Founders Double Trouble and Lagunitas Sucks. Nice yellow straw color, very little head, viscous full mouth feel, in your face hops I am guessing simcoe or galaxy. Very satisfying and delicious . Going out tomorrow to buy more."
"The beer had a clear body, golden amber color, and a one finger thick head. The carbonation looked gentle, and was comprised of some very fine bubbles. The smell of the beer was quite a bit milder than what I expected a Triple IPA to be. I could detect grapefruit and hay, and some pine. The taste was much hoppier than the smell, with a grapefruit laden, tongue tingling,hop bitterness. The alcohol was very well hidden, and the beer felt nowhere near 10% ABV. The body was medium dense, but much lighter than a typical beer of this strength, and the finish was herbal and long. This was a great find for a hophead like me."
""
""
""
""
"Poured in front of me this beer fills the glass with a slightly hazy deep straw light golden color liquid with a smallish off white head that shows moderate retention. Huge hoppy aroma with a bitter green onion, pine resin, pithy citrus, and a touch of licorice. Malt, yeah maybe there is, but with the hops and alcohol I can't find any in the nose. the flavor has a light bready malt in there but its mostly obscured with pine resin licorice citrus and alcohol. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice double ipa but for me the alcohol was a bit too present, sometimes harsh, and distracted me from totally enjoying this beer."
""
"Bottle says best by 02/18/14, so I imagine this is fairly fresh. Poured into a snifter, with a very thin layer of grey head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving an even thinner ring around the glass. No lacing. The color is translucent golden/orange. It looks crisp. Typical trip. ipa aromas of heavy hops and malt are prominent: sticky pine, with a slight hint of mint, which is super interesting. The flavor profile is only slightly reminiscent of your typical trip ipa: Green Bullet is not nearly as sweat, which I tend to appreciate about this beer. It is sticky hoppy with some malt in the background, but mostly this is enjoyably hoppy, with pine and citrus as well. It almost has a pulpy feel to it. It's crisp, but smooth, and I'd say rather drinkable for a trip IPA. I like it. Overall good beer, one I'd grab again given the chance. It's more like a strong double IPA than your common triple. Less sweet too, which is a good thing. Cheers."
""
""
""
"Overall: Despite noticing the alcohol, this is very easy to drink. Overall, there is not quite enough complexity to the hops for this to be a great DIPA, and there is not quite enough complexity to the malts for this to be a great Barleywine. However, the subtle yet bold mixture mostly works, and this is a very good, albeit not outstanding, choice for a high alcohol hop fix."

"Final Thoughts: This was my first time having a Green Flash beer and it basically met my expectations. They are finally distributing to MN and I picked up their West Coast IPA as well which I cannot wait to try after having Green Bullet. Would I drink it again? Sure would."
"A decent beer, but I just felt it was a bit overly dry and bitter, to the point I felt like I was sucking on a pine cone with every sip. Can't see myself ordering this one again; the 8 ounce pour at 16 tons was more than enough for me."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle with a Best By Date of 2/28/14. Pours a semi translucent golden amber color with an inch of head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet tropical amd citrus fruits with some dank hops. The taste is more of that sweet dank hops along with some piney notes and sweet tropical fruits. Pine and sweet dank at the finish with some notes of sweet onion and garlic. Great bitterness throughout with a good sized alcohol presence. On the sweet side but it works well. Medium amount of carbonation with a bit of an oily mouthfeel. Overall, another great Imperial IPA from Green Flash. I'll be having this again."
""
"O- very tasty ABV is so well masked could pound a few of these good stuff"
""
""
""
"My mind immediately goes to Palate Wrecker as the strong alcohols become part of its story; adding complexity, balance and challenge. I am however, pleased that the beer remains dry and hop-forward and doesn't become a sticky or boozy-sweet mess."
"This seems to be the liquid equivalent to chewing whole hops. Having tried that recently I can say this with some confidence. Not for the faint of heart this one will jump start your hop drive if you are a fan of bitter earthy hops. Quite good and I'll definately buy a four pack if I find one still around."

"Overall: I was excited to try a new hoppy beer from Green Flash, particularly as this is super fresh, having just arrived in our market"

"On the sweet side, but the bittering hops don't overwhelm, which pleases me. The citrus notes were somewhat muted, which was a bit disappointing. Borderline cloying, so it's weighing heavy on my palate."
""
""
"O - Outstanding Imperial IPA, lots of wonderful grapefruit, and grapejuice in the aroma and flavor."
"Poured a darkish gold, cloudy, great carbonation leads to two finger head with lace patches on top of an intense hoppy aroma, some citric but a good deal of grapefruit and there is a good amount of sweet caramel as well. Don't know why but these are the type of hopped up (triple IPA, though? come on) beers that I like. Strong hop presence, a little chewey/bready, caramel malts add sweetness and there is balance in a medium-to-full bodied beer, and then there is a grapefruit presence that I really appreciate and love to have. Not a hop bomb or overly boozy or """palate wrecker""" but a very enjoyable, dangerously easy to sip, high hoppy/boozy IPA that is top notch."
"O: Leave it to Green Flash to make the best Triple IPA on the market."

"tonight I am comparing it head to head with New Belgium Rampant Imperial IPA and Widmer Brothers Nelson Imperial IPA. Rampant is still my """go to""" imperial, this is more expensive and special, lighter in color and with less aftertaste, but so drinkable!"
""
""
""
"A big bruiser of a beer with considerable sweetness up front and punishing bitterness in back. Definitely not just a IIPA hop-bomb. The heavy malt presence will certainly offend some hopheads, but I like it. This could easily pass for an American Barleywine."
"An uncanny hop bomb with medium (sturdy) bitterness and a latent spicy bite. At 10.1%, Green Bullet is nothing to play around with; and, with the hop complexity and drinkability on its side, it's a damn fine Triple IPA to have around on cooler and lonelier nights. A surefire sipper. A dream ale. Delicious stuff from the hop masters over at Green Flash."
"O/D-I enjoyed this beer. I haven't had a hoppy Green Flash beer that hasn't kicked ass. The whole 'Triple IPA' thing is kinda dumb I think. DIPA, TIPA, QUIPA (Quadruple IPA...probably will come to fruition at some point unfortunately), who cares its an awesome Imperial IPA, no need for the verbal pissing contest."
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid beer by anyones standards, great showcase of some floral hop varieties. But I prefer their other hop forward options."
""
""
""
"Overall this is OK. It isn't hard to drink but it is at a level where my tongue just says """To hell with you I can't deal with it.""" 10.10 power not detectable at all."
""
"O: A great TIPA with an almost overwhelming hop presence that is actually quite laid back in terms of bitterness. The malts balance very nicely but make sure to give way to the hops. Surprisingly drinkable for 10.1%, but it sneaks up fairly quickly. Recommended"
""
"Full throttle DIPA, big and ballsy, more citric fruit and hop bite with lots more lime, honey and soft but quite present grapefruit. Rich, and velvet smooth on the tongue. Nicely done. If ya like a high quality DIPA (and dont we all?) this one is well worth a try"
""
"O- This is a great beer.I too often find big IPAs much too syrupy and sweet. That is not the case with this one. I really enjoy it, will suggest it to friends and will most definitely buy it again...like tomorrow"

"M: Chewy, viscous. Ample carbonation cuts down on the oily aspects."

"Overall, this is a great beer. The bottles I got were really fresh, even though it was tucked all the way back on the shelf @ tw. By comparison to the other high ABV IPAs I think it ranks right up there with the rest of them (RuinTen, Enjoy By, Hoptimum, Hopslam, etc)."
"Green Flash delving into new hop varieties makes me wonder if these Green Bullet hops are really anything special given that this recipe likely has been tweaked and perfected. Overall it's unique with melon and herb notes, not as abrasive as Palate Wrecker and while alcohol is present it is still drinkable."
""
"o - i'm not usually wild about triple ipas but lately there have been some brewers killing it (kuhnhenn's tripa and hoptimum come to mind). this is far from the thickness of some of those xtreme beers (DFH 120 or even devil dancer)...and it kind of rides the middle of the road for the IIIPAs that i've sampled. worth checking out and fairly enjoyable."
"O - Deleted. See comments above."

"I am very conflicted about this beer, and don't think I could recommend it, even if I enjoy drinking it."
"New seasonal from green flash, had in bottle and on draft. Very interesting beer, pours a clean bronze colour with a small head. The aroma for me was difficult to pinpoint, although I certainly detected the tropical and fruity notes of the New Zealand hop varietal along with a small amount of pine and plenty of booze. The taste follows suit, I am quite familiar with some of the New Zealand hops, specifically the pacific gem which I am fond of, so while i sort of knew what to expect, my expectations were met and in many respects, superseded. Tropical and fruity notes certainly dominate, pineapple, mango, and guava hit you upfront. This is followed by a some citrusy/lemony notes which compliment well. The malt presence is very light; a quality I personally like in an ipa, and this allows an aggressive, dry bitterness to show through. Although I think the 10.1% alcohol is fairly well hidden, it is certainly noticeable but not in a way that overpowers the great flavors that are harmoniously profiled. Very clean and crisp on the palate making it surprisingly drinkable for its strength. I found that this offering drew on some of qualities of their imperial ipa and to a slightly lesser extent, palate wrecker. I found it interesting to drink, and just like the imperial ipa, whilst difficult to judge first up, by the end I was intrigued and converted. All in all, this is an excellent ipa, and for me, the best green flash offering to date. Despite the fairly steep price tag here in nova, I will be looking out for more of this again throughout the remainder of the fall/early winter."

"Poured into a goblet slightly hazed menacing looking burnt orange,it just looked like one of them big ballsy brash hop bombs.Aromas of pithy grapefruit and leafy/floral hops with a sweet caramel and alcohol base.I found the flavors to be not as sweet and boozy as I thought they would be but the hops are big and brash with citric and leafy flavors coming in waves over the carame/biscuit base,the alcohol is there but it didn't hit me over the head.A really nice big hopped """triple""" IPA as GF calls it,I liked it alot."
