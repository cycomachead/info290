3.97,-7.5,4.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"Good frothy finger high head, mixed bubble sizes makes for uneven surface, light tan color, excellent retention, the lacing is very thick and covers wide swaths of the glass side. The liquid is as close to red as orange, very deep and glowing, at first you could miss seeing the tiny bubbles meandering within, very pretty to look at. Thick, clingy nose of molasses, pine sap, pink grapefruit pulp, it’s more spicy and smoky than herbaceous, pineapple, mango, nectarine, apricot fruit scents, more chocolate and malt appears as it warms, ends with even more smokiness like meat fat on a grill. Full-bodied, beef jerky, iron and slightly soapy, sticky in a dry residue fashion. Plenty of pine and grapefruit, tangerine citrus, here you get a bit more herbal stiffening but not enough to inch into “refreshing” territory. Cocoa, caramel, molasses sweeten the finish. The carbonation seems to be at an average plus level but the beer is so dense you need even more. Cherry, pineapple, nectarine, peach, mango fruit, in keeping with the whole more heavy than juicy and flowing. It’s a good enough brew but not sure I’d want more than one in a sitting.","farrago","Wednesday at 04:58 PM"

3.78,-11.9,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Proof that beer ratings don't always sway the palate, I went into this one super excited only to leave disappointed. While not a bad beer by any stretch, it isn't a 95 in TheIPAHunter's® book. Picked up two 4-packs prior to my fantasy baseball draft and left 6 of them in Pennsylvania to be shared by others who may enjoy the flavor profile more than me. You get hints of Mosaic hops in the nose and the taste, but the malt addition is a bit too much for my taste. I believe this was done to drown out the ABV and, while it works, it's to the detriment of the wonderful citrus notes that Mosaic hops can provide. Glad to have tried, but won't be seeking this one again in the near future.","weiserr","Sunday at 02:40 PM"

I stumbled on Chillwave in a craft shop in NC.  I have not been able to acquire Heady Topper or Pseudo Sue, but I can't imagine anything better than this CW stuff.  Bronze color, floral and citric aroma with a malty wildflower honey background, and a taste that follows perfectly.  CLEAN crisp and absolutely delicious.  The best 2xipa I have found to date.  I am going to have to find a recipe clone for this.  Highly recommend!","Gerg1","Mar 26, 2015"

Medium bodied with nice hop bitterness on the backend, but not at all as bracing as West Coast examples.  I prefer just a tad more malt backbone (there's a hint of honey sweetness and some tropical fruits), but still fairly well balanced.  Better than many of the current crowd favorites that are all hop aroma and flavor with no malt and no bitterness at all.  This is a great beer.","thebeers","Mar 22, 2015"

Overall, glad I gave this a second chance because I like it a lot more this time around. Not my favorite of the style, probably a touch sweeter than I needed, but I am definitely a fan. Would drink again happily.","denver10","Mar 13, 2015"
4.19,-2.3,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,"Big Edmund Fitgerald fan and a hophead so grabbed one when I first saw it.  This is very well made, smooth hoppy, high ABV beer that hits the mouth smoothly and goes down easily.  Surprisingly a little sweet on the tongue. Wow, 9.5 barely noticeable. Very, very hoppy with little secondary flavor like citrussy or floral.  I'm repeating...very smooth, high ABV not noticeable, but I guess I was hoping for something really exceptional from Great Lakes in a double, some kind of unique flavor touch. But you won't be disaapointed either way.","hotpauko","Mar 12, 2015"

Medium amber with a hint of head into the tulip (my BA bro Jens4212 supplying the fresh bottle, and sampling side by side). Grapefruit, passion fruit, tropical fruits (he mentioned papaya, I haven't had it), some bitterness also standing out in the aromas. Huge mango explosion on the front of the tongue for me, some warming alcohol, and just the juiciest, tropical IPA you could want. Finishes crisp and clean, with a hint of the tropical note. Excellent inspiration for what can be done with those HOPS! The circle of fantastic GL seasonals has been completed. I'd recommend trying them all.","Mikus","Mar 09, 2015"

Just not what I was expecting, malt has more of a role than with most double IPA's. At 9.4% I was expecting a taste bud buster. That never happen... It is ridiculously smooth and drinkable for being so high gravity. It just doesn't seem to crave that dank mouth watering hop bill that I have came to love with some of the other DIPA's.

Taste is sweet caramel malt, yeast, citrus orange, a bit of tangy grapefruit, earthy pine hops bitterness. Palate is a full body, smooth with good carbonation. The finish is of caramel malt, yeast, citrus orange peel notes, some tangy grapefruit, with some good earthy pine and herbal hops bitterness for balance, alcohol is well behaved.

A superlative IPA!","secondtooth","Jun 25, 2014"

While the description of the flavors might have seemed fairly straightforward or basic, it’s how rich and balanced those flavors are that makes this beer special. The hop forward nature of the brew allows the flavors and aromas of the hops to be fully expressed and experienced, while still giving the balancing malts their time to shine in the finish. Hop heads will love the strong flavors of their favorite ingredient, while those of us looking for drinkability still have a beer that finishes smoothly and easily! This beer is a must try for any beer lover, and is a great IPA to keep on hand. Drinkers unaccustomed to strong hop profiles might still be overwhelmed by the hop flavors here, but anyone with a few IPAs under their belts will find this beer very satisfying!","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

It's hoppy as you'd expect a DIPA to be, but not over the top and astringent like some. Honest, this is the bets DIPA in Ohio.

I've tried all of their regular beers and many of their seasonal beers. I've also been to the brewery twice. This is by far my favorite beer of their's. Usually I find Great Lakes beers too hoppy and bitter. This one is just right though, which is funny considering it's a double IPA. I love the way it looks in the glass. It's just gorgeous. A sort of orangey yellow haze that makes me excited just looking at it. The taste is almost fruity. Tropical fruit. In a good way though. I don't know what else to say. Just try it. I buy it whenever they have it at the grocery store.","Sleepy_Conscience","Apr 20, 2014"

A maltier, fuller bodied feel than expected for a higher octane DIPA. Grapefruit and ripe pineapple hop flavors over a sturdy caramel malt backbone. Minty hop flavor near the end with a musty, citrus hop aftertaste. Booziness is there but is superbly masked by the aromas and flavors. ","IronLover","Mar 29, 2014"

I am glad I did. This is a fantastic double IPA with great balance. Citrus is probably the most prominent flavor, but I enjoy the caramel malts that it also offers.

4.39,2.3,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5," The taste is great - lots of hop flavor with more of an orange type flavor with mild mango and grapefruit accents. The malt sweetness appears in the taste more toward the end of the glass but really just supports the hops which have a lot more flavor than bitterness and the alcohol is practically non-existant in the taste, there herbal and light pineapple flavors inthe peripheral make this a pretty decent Imperial Ipa to sample in multiples. Overall I would say based on having this side by side with Victory and Goose Island Imperial IPA's as well as DFH it is pretty impressive -very flavorful and not harsh in any way.","Slatetank","Mar 10, 2014"

THIS ale pours a beautiful clear copper color with a thick white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is a very fresh blend of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit. There are a lot of fresh hops here, supported by just enough malt to some what balance this beer. The mouth is medium bodied and coats the palate gloriously. As far as flavor, this one has it going on. It is a total hop bomb with tons of citrus, pine, and grass. There are significant notes of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. This is way beyond what I expected from a nob west coast ipa. Beautifully bitter and hoppy and so fresh one can almost taste the tap. This is a brewery that I had long ago lost faith in but if they can produce s west coast style ipa like this than maybe I should rethink my opinion.","lochef81","Mar 06, 2014"

Huge bittersweet toasted malt flavor has a complex hop bill. I detect notes of citrus, pine, tropical fruit and chewy, resiny bitterness. The 9.4% alcohol is easily lost in this complex menagerie of malt and hop flavor. Despite the huge flavors here, there is a sense of balance that allows for a wonderful warming and spicy bitter finish. Nice clinging lace stays through to the finish.","jbaker67","Mar 02, 2014"

Smells like passion fruit and pineapple, very intense and pungent. Flavour is nicely balanced, with passion fruit, citrus and pineapple vying against the bread and caramel malts. Really well balanced beer that is a pleasure to drink. Mouthfeel is as good as it needs to be, with just the right bit of carbonation, actually not very bitter for a DIPA, nice and dry with a passion fruity finish. Overall, this is a really nicely done DIPA that needs to be drank fresh. I loved it and for $9.99 a 4-pack, I would buy this any time over a $8.99 bomber of Toppling Goliath Sosus, which is another Mosaic DIPA that hit Madison at the same time I picked this up. Don't get me wrong, that is clearly a superior beer, but until Toppling Goliath starts bottling 4/6 packs, I'm going to choose this one 7 times out of 10.","Stevedore","Feb 28, 2014"

4.33,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"I heard about Mosaic hops and then this beer was released last year, and then I heard about Mosaic hops from just about everyone a very tropical fruit softer flavored DIPA that goes down so smooth it's hard to explain to those who've never imbibed on this God send of a beer from the armpit of Ohio where some say there's nothing good except for Great Lakes. I disagree a lot more good food and music places then Pittsburgh would know what to do with but I love both cities therefore I digress. Aromatics contain tropical fruit a bit of mango/papaya/citrus notes if that, nothing is harsh just smoothie tropical fruit notes. Flavor wise it hits with some vinous herbal hop bitterness and a bit of citrus pith that lingers to create a rolling bitterness between sips. There's more bright citrus/passionfruit/mango juice on the palate with waves of bitterness grasping the taste buds between sips. Nice textures, hop oils are slick but not resinous, even carbonation medium bodied way too easy to consume in number considering the ABV weighs in at 9.4%. The expiration date on this is dead on very fresh just released in Ohio the best by date is 5/11/14. I saw an episode of No Reservations: Cleveland where Anthony Bourdain visits these chillwave riders while drinking Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold.","WVbeergeek","Feb 28, 2014"

Pour is really nice too, with limit head, and just gives off an aroma of hops as it falls in the glass. The taste, for me, is out of this world. It is very hoppy, but is smooth until the last drop, with a great citrus finish to it. Highly recommend this brew.","evad310","Aug 08, 2013"

Nose is tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, apricot. The nose is like sweet perfume with floral hops and a fat malt character that yields up honey, caramel and cracker. Taste is extraordinary with plump, juicy ripe fruits and herbal hops light and earthy. It’s got a a sour zing and is resiny and dry. There’s a touch of alcohol on the palate but it’s inviting and warming. The malt is steady and sweet with some crusty bread mid palate and the hops splash up bitter with some light pine at the end for a dry finish. This is a fantastic DIPA that’s abundant with fruit, loaded with malt and exhilarating with bitter hops. Stupendous!","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

The nose on this one is huge. One detects citrus notes of grapefruit, pineapple, and grass. In the initial taste, one detects a peppery citrus sensation immediately. Accompanying notes include sour grapefruit on the sides of the tongue, orange, grass, and a biscuity malt backbone. The peppery grassy sensation takes over in the aftertaste and warms the back of the throat. Alcohol becomes a little more prominent in the aftertaste. The one disappointment I have is that the mouthfeel runs a little too thin for a DIPA. I want this one to last a little longer. This is a good one.","JohnnyHopps","Jun 08, 2013"

It's truly it's own beer. Absolutely standout stuff.","hagbergl","Jun 08, 2013"

The bitter tones play nicely but mostly as a balancing act to the wonderful flavor scheme. This drinks like the perfect summer IPA.

4.33,0.9,4,4,4.5,4.75,4.25,"I was really happy my neighbor found this brew...always like trying the new beers of GL. This beer pours a hazy brilliant orange with slight copper hue. The 1/2 finger thick slightly offwhite head was nice and frothy. The smell reminded me of Ports Wipe Out IPA. There is more floral notes than pine or citrus...Iwould have guessed columbus hops, but bottle says Mosaic. The taste is a very well balanced brew between floral, malt and ABV. The beer is a touch on the sweeter side, which must be from the honey malt used. The mouthfeel is full in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a very good beer, but at 9.4% ABV...it would be tough to session.","WoodBrew","May 16, 2013"

3.81,-11.2,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"a nod to the hectic freshwater surfers of the great lakes, this imperial ipa would warm any winter warrior after just a bottle. thanks to thebrewo again for hooking this up in a wonderful trade. the pour is a honey color with an amber hue, thick looking, and very clear, with less than an inch of off white fizz that settles to a thin film relatively quickly. the nose is oily resinous hops of course, and sweeter residual sugar notes, caramel malt, and plenty of sturdy alcohol. the booze is really quite intense. the flavor starts out with a lush fresh cut cactus sort of vegetative and refreshingly cooling hop profile, very unique before the fruity esters creep in. more malt body than expected, also on the sweeter side, sort of stopping the refreshment in its tracks. bitterness is not huge in this beer until well after the swallow, where it sort of crawls out of the throat and back onto the tongue, drying me out a little. cool complexion of flavors here, but the booze stands out too much. its just too strong, even for the style. it makes it more like a beer with a shot of middle of the line vodka dumped in, not quite offensive, but bordering on it in my opinion. I think it detracts rather than adds. mouthfeel is fine, and the lively carbonation cuts through some of its massive almost gelatinous body. I would rate this higher, but the alcohol intensity is a drawback for me, it takes away from an otherwise extremely impressive offering from great lakes.","StonedTrippin","Apr 23, 2013"

They will always have some of our favorites, but its good to see some a little more unique coming from This great brewery. It's not a wreck your palate like its Lake Erie Monster relative as its just a brilliantly crafted Double IPA letting you look forward to warmer weather. I'd like to see this stick around in the GLBC bottle release calander. It's definitely something anyone could enjoy and if you like fruit flavors then you can't pass it up. 2 thumbs up to Great Lakes for releasing an ale of this style. This is somewhat uncharted territory for GLbC and they knocked it out of the park considering this being their first release in bottles of this kind of ipa(to my knowledge anyway).","BradtheGreat7","Apr 10, 2013"
4.16,-3,4,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"O - I really enjoy this beer. It has what I would describe as a toasted dank hop aroma/flavor that I'm getting in more and more new beers lately, so I suspect Mosaic might be the common denominator. For 9.4% ABV and 80 IBUs, a very well balanced Imperial IPA.","meegs","Apr 10, 2013"

I've had Heady, Pliny, Sucks, Hopslam, and I've always maintained my preference for maltier, less hoppy beers. Maybe that's why I like this so much. This is the best IPA I've ever had.

4.31,0.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of a DIPA, it was very true to style while having a nice tropical fruit element that really shined through in the aroma. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, the alcohol showed up only a little, it wasn't overly bitter, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention. I might be up for drinking two of these but I think that I would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very good and I couldn't get enough of great tropical fruit aromas it had. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but if the flavor was a little more tropical and intense like the aroma was this would be one awesome beer. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good DIPA, I might even get a four pack of it, I would recommend this to anyone who loves DIPA's especially the ones that are heavy on the citrus and tropical fruits. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I thought every aspect of it was good, but I don't think it's a top tier DIPA, it's just a little short of being up their with some of the best of the style. Good job Great lakes, I always expect solid beers from you guys and this one turned out to be pretty good and I enjoyed it. I would take this over Lake Erie Monster any day, I hope they brew this again.","StoutHunter","Mar 25, 2013"

4.28,-0.2,4.25,5,4,3.75,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the fresh and fruity aroma. The hops are extraordinarily fragrant throughout the entire tasting, striking the perfect blend of tart, tangy, sweet, fruity, and zing. The flavor follows nicely, but with much more bitterness from earth and herb than from the fruity sweetness and citrus in the nose. This is not a negative, but just a bit of a surprise, as we were expecting a much sweeter, more malt-balanced beer. The flavors actually tended to muddle a bit with warmth, so enjoy this experience closer to fridge temperature than cellar temperature. All in all this is a great beer, but it is the aromatics that really stand out for us.","TheBrewo","Mar 18, 2013"

I had tasted this at Peaches St. Paddy's Day weekend and liked it, but had forgotten how good it is. I want more.

I get the clover flavor again which is more pronounced in the taste. The aftertaste is wonderful. A very bitter and peppery flavor lingers on my palate.

Pine/herbal hop notes, orange oil, with a major soapy element going on, and a rather sweet malt base; higher alcohol is not hidden. This really did nothing for me. Too sweet, too soapy.

Smells of tons of peaches, light juicy orange, mango, maybe some papaya or guava, stonefruit, along with some carmel from the malt, and light honey. Somewhat dry aroma. Taste starts with lots of sweet, juicy fruits. Peach, mango, papaya, and some grapefruit. Sweetness from the honey shows through already. The middle brings more honey sweetness as well as some carmel malts that really balance the fruity hops. Starting to get the resinous bitterness from the nugget hops. The finish a wonderful combination of fruity hops, sweetness, and slight bitterness. Lots of juicy peach, mango, some tangerine, papaya, stonefruit, little grapefruit peel, honey, and carmel. Slightly dry and bitter, but the sweetness cuts the dryness and bitterness wonderfully. Full body with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. The mosaic hop never disappoints, and the nugget hops provide a nice resinous bitterness to contrast the fruity qualities of the mosaic hops. Hoppy, yet very balanced and the flavors the hops bring are pretty complex. One of the best showcases of mosaic hops I've had. Excellent double ipa.","brewskis","Mar 09, 2013"

It's not their fault, they just seem to specialize in balanced, middle of the road, high quality lagers and ales. Well color me impressed. Alchemy Hour DIPA is easily one of the best beers I have had in recent memory, and is a top notch DIPA in every regard. This reminds me a great deal of Hopslam in its balance and sweetness.

It doesn’t seem to have the big IBUs that some hop heads seem to gravitate towards, but this brew has a decent balance that could make it a little more accessible to be a crowd pleaser. The only down fall to this one that I found was the coating of the mouth by the thick heavy malt body, but to me, that is a minor problem and I could enjoy this brew on a regular basis, if only Great Lakes decides to make it year-round! Right now it is only considered a Spring Seasonal beer and may already be gone from the shelves.","Beergelden","Mar 07, 2013"
4.25,-0.9,4,4.5,4,4.75,4.25,"Thanks to a VERY generous BA for this as an extra. Best before: 05/07/13. Pours an almost-clear amber color with a large white head that takes some time to go down. Scent is very tropical with tropical fruit notes and a bit of honey. There is some piney-ness, but not as much as what we're used to here on the west coast. However, I love the way the hops outnumber the small malt profile on this one. Bravo, Great Lakes. Come to think of it, this may be my first Great Lakes beer I've ever tasted. More tropical fruit aroma with a bit of grass and citrus. Taste is just as the nose leads you to. Awesome tropical fruit flavors (pineapple, mango, papaya, guava)...also with a hint of kiwi. The malt backbone definitely comes through in the taste, which was what I was hoping WOULDN'T happen, however... it works with this beer. Lost a couple points...but not too much. Tropical hops with a hint of citrus and some honey and caramel malt flavors. The sweetness of this beer mellows out the bitterness that should be here. A little or bitter with a little less sweet would do this one good. Mouthfeel is PERFECT for a DIPA. Pretty much spot-on. Not too thin, not too sticky, not under-carbed. Drinkability is scary high for the ABV on this one. No alcohol warmth detected. Overall, this beer is a pretty solid DIPA. The nose is great, but the taste is still a bit too malty. I know us west-coastians think differently when it comes to our IPA/DIPAs. Very tasty beer that I would definitely purchase on the regular if it were distributed to California.","DovaliHops","Mar 06, 2013"

Aromas of huge mango, grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, floral, caramel, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop and malt notes. Taste of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, floral, caramel, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, floral, caramel, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a near perfect bitterness/sweetness balance; and absolutely zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, lightly slick, and sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Dangerously easy to drink. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA! Great malt and hop complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to drink. An incredibly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 03, 2013"

The taste pushes forward a big sweetness to balance out this bitter beast; it's reminiscent of granulated sugar on grapefruit, which is then followed by a lingering lemon zest bitterness. Sharp, bitter hops clash with a huge malty sweetness in the mouthfeel, leaving the nearly 10%abv as an afterthought. It's grapefruit rind bitterness is well matched by sweetness resulting in a (surprisingly) drinkable DIPA. This beer reminds me of """this one goes to 11," with some obvious differences.

I wouldnt say it is fully balanced but again I dont mind the Mosaic hops shining through in this beer. Aroma's are fantastic, mango, pineapple sweetness.

3.96,-7.7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"A good looking beer, about a full finger or so of white head on top of a golden amber liquid body. Smell is the typical unique Great Lakes malt aroma, backed up by some floral and fruity hops. Taste is more of the same, following the typical Great Lakes recipe for IPAs. Similar to Lake Erie Monster, but less hoppy and more fruity, although I wouldn't really classify the taste as """fruity""". It's more floral and citrus if anything, but either way it's less aggressive than The Monster. Mouthfeel is decent, once again similar to the other Great Lakes offerings. They don't deviate much from their base recipe, and this brew is no exception. However, at 9.4% ABV, it's a high-gravity option that has good flavor and low alcohol presence. All in all, a winner and a solid B+/A- rating.","DrewV","Feb 22, 2013"

A couple pints of this will surely wash away the rigors of the day. If HopSlam was to your liking, then you have just found a fine substitute.","DingleHouse","Feb 21, 2013"

4.73,10.3,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pours a clear honey color with fluffy straw colored head. Aroma is of grapefruit, clove, lemongrass and fresh pine resin. The flavor is reminiscent of ripe ruby red grapefruit, with bready/malty sweetness. Some alcohol in the nose but it Mary's nicely with the hop and malt balance. Mouthfeel is rich and full and the drink ability would be wonderful if the Abu wasn't 9.4% great job GLB.","ABOWMan","Feb 21, 2013"
3.78,-11.9,4.25,3,4.25,3.5,3.75,"Overall, this is a good beer but people here are acting like Great Lakes redefined the IPA. I love West Coast style IPA's and this can't hold a candle to the real-deal WC IPA's out there - Bad Boy would kick this beer's pansy ass. Poor Man's makes this look downright indigent. Again, I'm glad to see Great Lakes taking their portfolio in more of a new school direction, but this is just a good beer, not a game changer and certainly not a 4+.","jampics2","Feb 21, 2013"

4.45,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours a brilliant deep clear orange with an off white head that quickly dissipates to a slight ring on the glass. Aroma is of big tropical fruit notes, peach, mango, orange peel, muted pine, booze, honey sweetness. Upfront there is a big pop of tropical fruits followed by a honey sweetness in the middle of the mouth. At the back of the palate the sweetness transitions to a dry finish with grapefruit puckering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to medium light. Deceptively smooth and light, the alcohol is perceptible but well hidden. What alcohol does come through helps cut the sweetness and keep the beer well balanced. A well crafted and enjoyable west coast DIPA by Great Lakes with a midwest uniqueness.","spark3148857","Feb 19, 2013"

Taste is similar to the scent, grapefruit up front, some pineapple sweetness, finishes bitter with a touch of booze. Drinks very smooth for the ABV. Carbonation is spot on. Great mouthfeel. Great Lakes has really done a great job here. People should seek this out, I would say this is easily on the same league as Hopslam.","Pdiddey3d","Feb 19, 2013"
