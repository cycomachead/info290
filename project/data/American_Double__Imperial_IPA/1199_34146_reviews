"Night cap. Poured into a tulip. Everything I remembered from the first time I had this one. Great double IPA, as to be expected from Founders. Three more waiting for me in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a version that had been aged for 6 months - not good idea"
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden pour with thin, clingy white top. Grapefruit nose with fresh bread too . Citrus hops in flavor, perfectly balanced with malt in the end. Smoothest finish is remarkable. No trace of alcohol in such a big brew. Wish it was slightly more aromatic."
""
""
"O- This is a very tasty IPA on tap. Plenty of grapefruit to satisfy the die-hard west coast IPA fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2/16/15 (Bottle) - Strong blonde pour with minimal head. Aroma was distinctly orange and lemon, two favorite flavors. Beer somewhat bitter, tastes strong going down and I enjoyed the taste. Texture is lighter and smooth, carbonation minimal. Overall, it's a very good beer and I look forward to future bottles and other Founders offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-The magnificent intensity of the hops delivers such an excellent tasting beer. However, while the hop intensity is something you'd expect from an Imperial IPA, it does not lose its balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Wow!  Being a double IPA, and being that I overall really don’t like IPAs much less double IPAs, this is a hell of a lot better than I thought it would be!  I’m amazed at how much I like it actually!  It has to be because this bottle has a year’s age on it, which must have really toned down the hops.  It actually tastes much more like an American barleywine rather than a double IPA.  It’s fucking delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For somebody who likes IPAs, but not insane IPAs, this would be a good intro to the double IPA. It is accessible. It is a solid IPA that I would recommend any hop-head, like myself, to try."
"Had this immediately after Founders Centennial IPA and it really is in a lot ways very similar, but in other ways very different. Instead of centennials bright reddish amber, double trouble is a more subtle hazy orangeish straw color with a subdued head. Smell is mild but good, sweet pineapple, mild hoppy punch, bready malts, hint of vanilla. Taste is much smoother and maltier than I was expecting very creamy. Ruby red grapefruit. Fresh bright hops finish it off. Feel is slick and creamy, I bet this would be amazing on nitro. Mild carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed it. Very malty, delicious hops."
""
""
"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle on January 21, 2015."
""
"This one was a very strong and incredibly bitter double IPA, one that I was expecting to be as such but I still ended up surprised by the strength of it, it was absolutely loaded with hops. A very in your face beer and one that had to be sipped away at slowly rather than quaffed, perhaps the only thing that prevented me from rating it that little bit higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"V - Four pack of bottles, medium/high value."
"Pours a hazy honey color, with hardly any head.  Aroma is restrained hops.  Taste is malty, boozy and balanced by hops.  Mouthfeel feel oily for an ipa, but not bad.  Overall and balanced dipa with a kick of booze."
""
"12oz bottle (great artwork on the label) poured into a snifter (unfortunately, not fresh--a few months past its prime); golden to tan in color; very little head and not much lacing; citric aroma but not strong; fairly smooth--not much carbonation; a citric, bitter hoppiness flavor but malt backbone comes through a bit in the end. Overall: A really enjoyable DIPA, which I regret not trying when it was fresher. Hop profile not as complex, interesting or unique as many other DIPAs but solid overall beer that beats many in its category. (9.0)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a dank, resiny, oily slick double IPA. Big malt on the front end with a bitter, bitter finish."

"Had on drwft at Pharmacy Burger Nashville"
""
"O--Very nice IIPA for sure.  Loved the hops citrusy smells with crushed pine needles.  I prefer my IPAs to have a little dank/resin scent so I was missing that here, but overall this is a great IIPA that I would definitely have again.  Definitely could see this one sneaking up on you after a few"
""
""
"Nice brew. All of the tell tales of a DIPA, can't say anything blew me away but a very good presentation of the style."
"Good beer. Nice smooth drinking DIPA with higher abv. Buy again for sure"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like this DIPA. A lot. Is it in my top 5, NO. But still a solid beer."
""
""
"Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is so f'ing good man. Great bitter, light flavor. Good aftertaste, strong because it's a double. I love this brew and buy it whenever I see it. (Which is rare)"
"Hoppy taste and aroma, though not overly citrusy. Medium malt taste and body. Finishes somewhat bitter. Better IMO than Surly abrasive, still liked dreadnaught more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very resinous and high presence of alcohol. Hint of toffee and not so hoppy, Very long bitterness. Not the best dipa i've had"

"Overall: My tastes tend to favor maltier, darker beers – but I have to admit this is one of the finest American Style Double/Imperial IPA. Great beer at a reasonable price point."
""
"Overall - Lots of hop bitterness and the booze is really well hidden.  Tastes a lot like a hopped up version of their Centennial IPA.  An above average DIPA."
""
""
""

""
""

"Overall - This is a great example of the style. I haven't found anyone who doesn't appreciate this Double. Thanks Founders!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Not overly hoppy.  Smells great, tastes real good.  My only small complaint is a lingering bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"What we have here is a delicious, boozy Double IPA in a bottle that will give me nightmares for the next week. I fell asleep after a four pack with my iPod on shuffle. . .I emailed my music video treatment to Rammstein the next day. Seriously Founders, how about some bottle art that doesn't inspire night terrors?"
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic mouth feel and wonderful dry and hop taste.  Poured a hazy light amber with light white head.  Great pineapple and tropical fruit taste.  Good finish with taste and dryness that last a long time.  One of the best DIPA I've had."

"O- Generally like the big DIPAs to be a little smoother, though this one actually is quite refreshing.  Aftertaste left me a bit off."
""
""
""
""
"Stylistically, I'm not sure this is a perfect DIPA. With that said, this is a phenomenally tasty beer. Extremely well-balanced in every way and a few surprises thrown in. Another winner from Founder's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent DIPA. Pinapple masks the high octane really well. The best part? Special at local store: $4.99 a 4 pack. Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours orange with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head.  Aroma is of citrusy hops, sweet malt and ripe pears.  Body is full and tangy.  Citrusy hops dominate the palate, while biscuit malt and ripe fruit provide some support.  Finish is long, dry, and bitter.  Excellent brew."
""
""
"Good but not great.  Was drinking Heyoka, Ca$h Money and Unsessionable the same night and Double Trouble was just not on the same level.  Left me wanting more with every sip / gulp.  Very mild flavored and slightly bitter.  Very little back end."
""

""
"Nice, but nothing special - could just as easily knocked off a dogfish 90 or a Double Jack and been just as happy - grab it if you see it, but not something I am going to bother hunting down next year"
""
""
"Reddish-orange with a quickly thinning tan head.  Smells herbal and oily with faint fruits.  Has a precise, floral bitterness on the palate that ends with a splash of orange, a hint of spice and consistent all the way through.  Medium with enough heat to keep you warm.  A potent yet refined, classic DIPA."

"Very hoppy - just how I like my IPA's.  For some, the bitterness could be a bit overwhelming, but I find it very enjoyable.  The pine & citrus basically punched me in the face upon the first taste.  There's a slight bit of malt, once you get past the hops.  Gotta love the higher alcohol content too."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a solid beer. Liked this a lot more then Founders Devil Dancer TIPA....that was just too boozy for me(as are most triples in my opinion)...this beer is pretty well balanced...lots of hop bitterness, some malts push through to calm them slightly......I have had tons of DIPAS and by no means would i give this beer a 94 rating on here and i wouldn't go out and BUY this again, BUT..... if somebody offered me one i would not turn it down. in a nutshell, glad i picked it up and tried it out and if you haven't, give it a go."

"Overall-  I would definitely order again, especially on draft.   Excellent quality.  Feel a huge nap coming on…."
""
"Cars aren't nicer to drive just because they have more horsepower. Music does not necessarily sound better if it's played louder. Likewise, beers aren't superior the stronger they are or the more loudly they're hopped. All in all, for something to the tune of 86 IBU and 9.4%, Double Trouble has the technical specs to intimidate, but it's an unusually and exceptionally well-balanced, mellow DIPA. For hopheads, the best time to visit Michigan is June through September."

""
""
"Pours copper amber with a thin white head. Aroma is floral citrus hops, some grapefruit with a pungent notes, some orange marmalade as well. Taste is sweet caramel malt followed by some citrus fruity notes, grapefruit and earthy hops. Palate is a medium to full body, smooth goes down easy, good carbonation. Finish is a combination of sweet bitter caramel malt, fruity and some lingering earthy grapefruit pungent, tangy hops. Alcohol seems well behaved. Overall a very good, full flavored, easy on the palate DIPA"

"Overall (8/10) - An excellent beer that I would happily purchase again when it's available in season.  Not as bitter and hop-centric as some of the bigger IPA names out there but I'm completely fine with that--this is well balanced and the flavors are complex enough to keep you guessing."

"Very hoppy, very delicious. Pours a nice golden orange. Not much head and a loose lace. Very piney with plenty of citrus notes (pineapple & mango) and a nice malt backbone. For the price and availability (Jul-Sep), this is a great Imperial DIPA. Love it. Enjoy."

"Pretty good offering. It hits the DIPA category well but lacks in aroma which follows into a moderate blend of citrus and bitter hops. Nothing in it really stands out but what is in unit blends together well. Last years batch wasn't so memorable either but I'm sure I'll be grabbing some again a year from now."

"O: This is about a solid DIPA one will find that is readily available (during Summer), and that you don't have to go on a scavenger hunt for. price is equally respectable, averaging $3.50/btl. Good grapefruit tartness and the biscuit ant root malts even each other out. The tropical fruit and dank resin compliment each other as well."
""
""
""
"OK, well, let's get it on! On the pour, this is a beautiful golden-wheat colour that really is enhanced by being an unfiltered beer. A small, thin disk of head quickly dissipates into decent lace on the glass. The nose shows citrus and hops, and when I take a sip, that's the first thing that hits - immediately followed by a bitterness that I find unpleasant, and that clings to the tongue long after I swallowed and overshadows any other flavours that might have been present... I had high hopes for this one and was a bit disappointed in the taste. The alcohol is well-hidden, only becoming noticeable at the very end. The mouthfeel is of a nice, creamy brew with just enough carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer, but the bitterness turns me off of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was expecting quite a bit more from this beer. Sure the bitterness is here and the aroma is decent but I found the flavor to be really lacking. A little more hop flavor and less hop bitterness would be wonderful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My aggro pour not only caused a pseudo-cascade which settled into two fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention, but it released a lot of esters. So much so that my eyes watered briefly and I even sneezed! In the interim, the head began to fall, leaving sticky acing in its wake. I would need a jackhammer later to remove all of it. Color was reminiscent of the old television show, Solid Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity! This, of course, brought forth the Unholy Trio of Mammon, Croesus and Midas, all clamoring for some of my gelt. I went for a deeper sniff instead and found the nose to be a combination of pine tar and caramel, but in a very nice way. Mouthfeel was dense and heavy, like a dollop on the tongue. It came with a boxer's one-two punch with the fusel alcohol heat softening up my poor, bruised tongue and then the intense pine hops hitting right behind. Holy ...! I was rendered at a loss for words for a moment and it caused me to wonder what kind of havoc its brother, Devil Dancer, might be like. Phew. 86 IBUs and 9.4% ABV, just the way I like to start every day. I know that fresher is better, especially when it comes to hops and this read """Bottled 06/17/2014""" and I began to wonder what it might be like aged. Phew. Did I say that already? My eyes were watering, my nose was running and I was beginning to doubt my self-proclaimed hophead status. Finish hit like a belt to the solar plexus and if you have never had the pleasure, try this. It was literally breathtaking. Dry and hot and suddenly, the Zephyr winds could be heard blowing across the Sahara! OMFG. I had better stick to AIPAs in the future."

"Overall: This is one of those IPAs (and beers in general) that has different aromas and flavors when cold than closer to room temperature. The toasted malt is more prominent when chilled, resulting in a more balanced beer per se, but as it warms, the citrus is where i like it to be with malts becoming sweeter and playing more in the background. My ratings are based on this beer being closer to room temperature which i enjoy more than straight out the fridge. However, this is not up there with my absolute favorites in the style, but close! Founders is my favorite brewery for a reason: They make great representations in any style! I highly recommend it for someone who enjoys a well balanced IPA. LET IT WARM UP! Cheers!!"

"Verdict: A less than impressive DIPA from Founders, just way too boozy and abusive. The hop profile is nice but just gets strongly overpowered by the alcohol character which overpowers the malt which could provide a much nicer counterbalance. Just too intense for me."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely in the caliber of Enjoy By, Dirt Wolf and Hopslam in my opinion. This one is excellent for a brewery that is more known for its stouts."

"Poured a deep clear gold with a thin and short lived white head. A little bit of lacing hangs on. The initial aroma is pure Cascade: deep and piney, but developing some malt depth as it warms and open up. The taste is equally big, with deep malts balance off of huge citrus and floral hops. It has nice solid weight to the body and is an excellent Imperial IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Sweeter and more liquor like that other DIPAs, a great winter beer, or last one of the night - so long as you need not drive, it's bitter, resinous and cloying. Let it warm."
""
""
"I love this beer. One of the best DIPAS out there and one of the reasons I rank Founders in the top 10 Breweries in the Country."
""
""

"O - Founder's Double Trouble uses everything that's awesome about a double IPA to it's advantage; big fruitiness, pine sap bitterness, a hefty malt backbone, and the alcohol that goes along with it. In a market flooded with this style, Double Trouble is one of the better examples out there."
""
""
"Note: I am not experienced in rating beers, but this beer reminded me of my favorite beer Plinny the Younger. I bought the Founders at an ABC Liquor, the beer was located on the checkout table, and it appealed to me. I figured $4.50 was a fair price... not cheap but not too expensive. So I tasted the beer and was impressed by its tart and biter features. It was a perfect thing to drink after a long day at work."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is good, but I don't see it as one of the best. Maybe I got an older bottle."

"The beer pours a nice, clean head that borders on creamy but is very bubbly and leaves a lot of lacing. The beer itself is a clear bright orange with a very light brown note. The beer smell has strong grapefruit and resin notes. The overall smell is also fairly crisp. The grapefruit notes dominate the nose but the resin seems to dull it a little bit and make it floral. Also, there seems to be a slight black peppery smell. The taste is fairly surprising and different from the smell. The grapefruit notes are much stronger in the taste than it is in the smell but there also appears to be a more citrus and floral flavors appearing with a tiny hint of sweetness but overshadowed by the hops. The taste also has a slight note of black pepper and the pine flavors are also there. The mouthfeel is crisp and surprisingly light for a Double IPA but still heavy bodied. Overall, a fantastic Double IPA and one worth getting if you can. This is definitely the easiest and most complex DIPA that I have had to date."
"O – Very good DIPA. It would be well worth checking out for any hophead out there. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I didn't know how well Founder's would do with a DIPA but they really succeeded with this one."

"Overall this is a fine offering from Founders. I've had trouble finding a true DIPA from them (Devil Dancer was more of a barleywine) so this one is great. Glad I got a 4 pack instead of a single. Will definitely try to find this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a growler into a mug. Probably my favorite Founders offering to date, and the kick-off beer for DIPA weekend. The color was extremely inviting, beautiful, almost glowing copper.  The aroma was strong on the floral and the hops.  Flavor was strong on grapefruit.  Not too much alcohol in the taste, which was great give the strength of the flavor. Great beer."

Maybe the others I had tried were not the freshest, this one I know was very fresh, less than a month old. Anyway, I would buy this one again and will look for it when its released again."
""
""
"O- All of the Founders IPAs I've had so far (Devil Dancer, Harvest, Centennial) all have a very similar taste to me. I don't know if it's their house yeast, similar hop profiles or what but this has been the best of them IMO."

"Pours a clear amber with two fingers thick of soapy white head; one ring of lace around the glass from remnants of the head; the glass is undisturbed the rest of the way down. Smell: apricot, grapefruit peel, pine - lots, garlic - a little. Taste: upfront it's summit-y...garlic and green with a white grape and cracker backing; then mid sip seems to change gears to peach, pine, and alcohol. A bit oily and booze slick. It's fine."

"Amazing beer. I now know again why this is one of my favorite beers of all time. After being duped a few weeks ago with buying a bottle that was from 2013 and throwing my tastebuds for a twist, this redeemed that experience. Its a huge beer at 9.4%, but the tast is just out of this world. After that year old, I took a sip of this, and was expecting just a mouthful of bitter hops (which would have been fine!), but then there was the more complex aspect. There was something else in there to cut that biterness a little, but didnt take away from the double IPA flavor. There was a fruity aspect in it, after the initial bitter hop taste. Not fruity like a belgian IPA, but fruity like a cross between a peach and a grapefruit that had sex with a hop plant and brought forth a forbidden fruit - a fruit/hop hybrid that we have all grown to love."

"Poured bottle dated 5/29/14 into IPA glass. Not quite fresh but this is New Hampshire, so that will have to do. Slight white foam head and minimal lacing. Beautiful aroma of citrus and grapefruit. Taste is of strong grapefruit and warm burn from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is peppery and a little carbonation as well. Overall, a very well done Imperial IPA that I'm glad I got to try!"

"The appearance of this beer is confounding. After a fairly vigorous pour, it appears a bright, shiny gold but offers little head on the glass. From my reading this is not typical, so its possible I got a got a bum batch. It smells fantastic, and the aroma might be its best quality about it. Very citrusy; lots of grapefruit and not overly piney. The taste is sharp and seems to try to do too much. The citrus holds throughout, but the beer seems very malty, almost like homebrew extract. Not nearly as smooth as many other IIPAs. Overall, this beer is overrated. I am a big Founders fan, but this beer underdelivers. After finishing my four pack, it left me wanting more."
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice contrast between sweet and bitter, very easy to drink with nicely hidden alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In general, the bitterness is a bit stiff. The sweetness holders the beer back slightly and there’s that alcohol that comes through in the back. Despite the negatives, it is still a hop driven and relatively clean drinking DIPA. One of the best on the shelves."
"O: Insanely good. Beats out many other neo-hopped DIPA...this is a cut above."

"Final comment: Some may criticize (as I think some have written) that this beer suffers from being one dimensional by not possessing the usual plethora of aromas/flavors found in other DIPA's. However, I have never tasted anything as dank and citrusy since Stone Ruination IPA...in this case, simplicity is Double Trouble's charm."

"Simply beautiful pour with creamy white head, golden body, very slight haze. Nose was surprisingly light, with some white wine elements of multi-fruit, booze, and floral. Perhaps served too cold? Palate flavors betray the IBU number as it is delightfully hoppy, bitter, but not hugely bitter in a bad way of any sort. Good malt balance. Scarily easy to drink. As I near the end, I'm appreciating the floral qualities more."

"O: Best Founders product I've tried, by a wide margin. Clear and crisp, with a pleasant hoppy burst in back. ABV 9.4% extremely well hidden behind the flavor. Cheaper than Devil Dancer, and much more enjoyable."
""
"Double Trouble, you say? I'll take two!"
""
"O-I commend the amount of work put into the beer, but again it's downfall in my opinion is that its really pandering for attention. Don't try so hard beer, calm down."

"An excellent example of a great DIPA. The appearance was dark yellow with a thin head. The nose was bursting with floral and pine from the hops, although there was a bit of sweetness on the back end from the roasted malt. The flavor was amazing with full force of hops coming in the beginning while leaving the sweetness from the malt in the finish to make a very refreshing beer that doesn't attack your senses. Overall I thought it was an amazing beer."

"Overall - Yeah, I'd say this bottle is well past its prime. I'm now reading on Founder's website that this beer's limited run is July-September, and considering this is June, I declare this about as dead as IPAs get. A shame. Hate to review it like this, but let this review be a reminder: IPAS DO NOT AGE WELL... DISTRIBUTORS PULL THESE OFF THE SHELVES! A definite candidate for a re-review."

"This is an excellent beer on-tap, i have never had it out of the bottle so i can not comment on that. It is a full flavor easy drinking beer. It will not you on your ass if you aren't careful with it. I would put it in the top 5 beers brewed from founders."

"Founders Double Trouble pours a yellow semi-translucent liquid topped with an weaker foamy white head. Both the nose and tongue share the simple sweet floral hop flavor. The potency is balanced, but unimpressive for the style. On the mouth is a smooth clean refreshing beer that is expected for craft beers. Overall Double Trouble is a delicious strong simple beer that is worth a taste. It's not the best Founders has to offer, but it's still worthy of the name."

"UPDATE 7/20/14: Fresh fourpack with bottles sealed a month ago. Pine is not funky, not that much bitterness lingering, 9.4 ABV pretty well covered, smooth enough but not really silky. Changing my rating to: Appearance 4 to 3.75; smell 3.75-4; taste 4.25-4, mouthfeel 4.25-4."

"O: A remarkable DIPA, definitely on-par with Heady Topper. Generally, """balanced""" is a throwaway term when it comes to beer, but this one manages to maintain a strong, fresh hop flavor without sacrificing a clean, lemony-crisp smoothness. About as close to perfect as it can get. Very reasonably priced, but tough to find in the northeast."

"O: Wouldn't expect any less than a fantastic brew from Founders. The bitter bite can arguably be off-putting for some but it is not overwhelming. What was surprising is that this seemed a lot less malty than many of the other DIPAs out there and it stands out with a wondeful creamy body."

"Pours a clear gold with a foamy pure-white head - great retention and lacing. Aroma of great astringency - overripe pineapple and mango - a lot of peach sweetness, some pink grapefruit and mild resin. Hints of strawberry as well. More light biscuit malt comes through in the flavor as well as huge citrus and tropical fruit astringency."

"I'm a bit schizo about this beer. I buy it every year and have the same response: one night I think it's good but not great, then the next night it seems truly outstanding. Don't know why this happens. But it is never bad; sometimes it's great."

"O: Very happy I have gotten to try this. Hopefully I will get to try it a little fresher next time around, but this is still a very good beer even with some age... just a little muted from what I imagine it should be. Very drinkable... almost scarily so for something this high in abv."

"a great big ipa, just how we like em. pours a dead sexy radiant honey color with a puffy white head, lasting, and maybe two inches tall. its got just the slightest haze to it, with mellow rising bubbles backlit by a setting Adirondack sun. ahhh. the nose is real hoppy, oily and dank, definitely in the west coast mold. some citrus notes, but also some more traditional bittering stuff, and some high alpha varietals too. medium pale and crystal malt middle, enough body and back bone, but gentle enough to lets the hops do the talking, or should I say screaming. this is an aggressive brew, bold and bitter, crisply refreshing for its size, but still sticky in the mouth, sappy, huge. alcohol is obvious but not unpleasant, just a reminder of the power of this beer, and that I probably shouldn't have more than a pint. great carbonation, this drinks pretty easy for what it is. founders has gotten the hops dialed lately, and this beer is a real testament to that, just a real well done example of the style."
""
""
""
"Here is a dank, bitter, circle of hop flavor, kind of DIPA. This has the flavor and bitterness to match. Pale malts hold up so it's not a thin bitter mess like some IPA's I've had. This leans the toward green pine and grapefruit hops. Alcohol comes out a bit but works with the finish. This is the best Founders I've had to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From my tasting notes: It poured a deep gold with a solid white head that had good retention and lacing. The aroma was full of tropical fruits, floral hops and citrusy grapefruit notes. The initial taste was a huge grapefruit rind bitterness that deftly slid into a lingering floral hop bitterness and dry finish. The bready malt backbone helped hide alcohol that was undetectable. As the beer warmed the flavors became more intense and well balanced taking you through it’s robust hop flavor profile with every sip. A troublingly tasty and tippable brew despite it’s high ABV and bold hop flavors."

"Overall: Could have fooled me it was a double."

"Pours a pale golden yellow with a quickly fading white head. Aroma almost exclusively of hops. Herbal and pine resin up front with hints of grapefruit, orange rind, and tropical fruits. Sweet malt hits the palate first followed by tropical fruit and citrus pithiness. Finishes bitter. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall, a nicely balanced and well crafted Imperial IPA."

"Another Founders I'm pleased to drink and pours a pineapple hue with the fluffiest two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is a good combination of malts and hops with aromas of pineapple,boiled candy,lychee,caramel candy and torn orange leaves,the mouthfeel is over medium bodied with beautiful moderate carbonation and the taste starts off with pineapple,strong citrus,sweet caramel candy and finished with a passionfruit bittersweetness and overall it's very drinkable with its ABV not noticeable at all and yeah it's nice but there's better DIPA's out there cheers."

"12 oz poured into teku. Pours hazy bright orange with a single finger head. Smell is bready, piney, tropical fruit, earthy. Taste is full of pine, some melon, lots of lemon, I get a little bit of lavender. Mouthfeel is creamier than a typical ipa, as to be expected. Over all this is a great Midwest style dipa. It's got a great appearance, a nice nose, and a lot of unique bold flavors that are still surprisingly smooth. Great label, better beer."

""
"Very decent lacing, actually a little surprising to see the high alcohol content, an anti-session beer that you could easily drink more than one of as if it were a session beer. All in all I would say it is just about the perfect double IPA, might have to pick up another one tomorrow while they are still available."
""

""
""
""

"This is one of those double ipa's that is so drinkable it's scary, would love to try the barrel aged version of it.

"I love IPAs but this one stayed on the pallet too long. Great smell and initial taste but long lasting hops taste. Does not have a smooth feel to it after swallowing but fells good initially in the mouth. I probably will not try this one again but was better than the pallet wrecker from night before."

"O: This beer is definitely a solid DIPA. Very tasty and hoppy as you could expect from Founder's Brewing."
"Taste is all about the hops, very resinous and tropical fruit pith...grapefruit peel, lime zest and papayas. Unlike many DIPAs that are big on hop flavor, this one also packs a helluva bitterness punch. Malts are pretty non-existent on actual flavor, but it does have a very smooth and creamy body...typical of Founders with a very fine-bubbled carbonation. I like it well enough, but there are a couple local DIPAs that I am surprised to say I would probably buy over this, freshness being equal of course. I like that it is available in 4-packs though as opposed to the bomber format."

"O-Overall a very good double IPA. The 9.4% abv is not even apparent in this beer. Smooth with the hops being the dominant factor. The malts definitely help to give some balance to the taste but the hops come in well executed. Drink and enjoy."
""
""
""
"Not a bad double IPA, but I was a little letdown. Almost on par with hopslam which was a real letdown for me. That being said, I'd take this over hopslam, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek out either again."

"top-tier, but can't quite beat sucks/hopslam/abrasive. spizy stuff"
""
""
""
"Clear, golden-yellow with a fizzy, bubbly head. Nothing spectacular and no lace with very little retention. Disappointing. Big, fruity, citrusy hops with plenty of booze to back them up. Fairly sweet, lightly roasted malt. Same with the taste. All piney, citrusy, dry hops with some booze and a pungent finish. Feel and body are appropriate for the style. This is my third of the night and it's just as good as the first. Pretty easy drinking for the strength and flavor profile. Not overly hoppy but just not what I expected. A pretty standard, boozy DIPA that doesn't leave me craving more. Still a great beer, nonetheless."
""
""
""
""

""
"o: the reason i was a little let down from the flavor was because the aroma had much juicier tropical fruit than the taste. i'm also a fan of that so its all subjective. this is not a bad beer though, its got a lot of solid full flavors (as you usually find in DIPAs) and it is well balanced. most people can enjoy this."

"Overall, I am sympathetic to the reviewer who said he never knew quite what to make of this, and I'm not sure I do, either, but I just finished one 12 oz. bottle, I enjoyed it, but I now need a nap, and after the nap I will switch to something else. But I must say as a hophead I am enjoying the bitter, tongue-curling finish that lingers nicely. Certainly a quality DIPA that ipa lovers must try."
""
"Appearance is light copper in color with a golden hue on the edges. There is just a thin layer of head that dissipates quickly. There are distinct grapefruit notes in the nose. There is a touch of malt and it is certainly hop forward. The hop bitterness oddly decreases on the finish, but there is a nice dryness that keeps this offering pleasantly bitter until the very end. There is a touch of lemon on the finish as well."
"Overall this is very enjoyable, easy drinking a very nice I2PA. Wishing I had bought more then a four pack now."
"O- I was very excited to try this beer as I had heard great things. It definitely lives up to its recommendations and I would gladly drink this beer on a daily basis if it was easier to get around here. I can't stress how delicious the grapefruit notes are on this beer. Another great beer from founders."
""

"First time writing a full review. Poured bottle into pint glass. Light orange color. Plenty of lacing. This is one amazing smelling beer. So much citrus aroma... like a fresh peeled orange. Tastes incredibly smooth for 9.4% ABV. Some hop bitterness, but mostly citrus, some sweetness on the back. No alcohol burn. Nice mouth feel, good amount of carbonation. Dry, but not overly dry. Overall, a really incredible beer. As long as it is available it will be my go to beer. I also like that its available in 12 oz 4 packs as opposed to the 22 bombers. Better price and it make is easier to drink on a random weeknight."

"Overall this is one of my favorite DIPAs, and one of my favorite Founders offerings. I toke a lot of heat for what I'm about to say, but Double Trouble """ages""" exceptionally well for a DIPA. I'm not saying to throw it in the cellar, but the flavors do not diminish terribly over time. Probably wondering why I am mentioning aging this beer, but my first experience with it was aged for 6 months (not on purpose), and I thought it was exceptional then, and I think it's exceptional now with just about 3 weeks on it. Cheers."
""
""
"O - I could throw back a few of these. Price point is reasonable and this is a tasty IPA for the hopheads. I enjoyed this with BBQ babybacks, and some grilled meat with a dry rub seems to be the way to go,"

"12oz bottle, deep golden colored body topped with with a bubbly, white head that holds good retention and fades to a foam leaving some lace on the glass. Juicy, tropical aroma, with citric grapefruit, bready malt, caramel. Bready, sweet, caramel malt backbone can't stand up to the bitter, pungent hop bitterness of grapefruit, mango, and pine. Juicy and sweet, but bitter and a bit hot. Medium body, resinous hop, lingering bitter finish. Overall, I never know what to think of this one - I love Founders, but it's not my favorite of theirs, still a reputable DIPA though."
""

"This is just a great DIPA. Up there with some of the big boys for sure. It will be a staple of mine, expecially when I'm in the mood for big citrus hops with great balance."
"Double Trouble is a beer that I'd definitely recommend. I heard some people say it was """sort of""" like Hopslam, but it's not at all. MAYBE the aroma is SOMEWHAT like it, but nothing else is close. Hopslam is extremely sweet (but not in a way that's cloying), and this is rather dry and bitter -- it's all about your personal preference. They're both completely different beers with an identical price tag -- try them and decide for yourself."

"overall: A great fruity DIPA from Founder's, I could drink this all day and session it even though it's 9.4% abv. One of my favorite DIPAs, and one of my favorites from Founder's, this is a well balanced highly drinkable beer, very hoppy but not a huge bitter hop bomb like most other DIPA's on the market."
""
""
"This beer is good not great. It color is a little more pale than beers in its style, and the smell is muted. It smells of orange pine and grapefruit. Taste is very mineral like with hints of pine and citrus followed.by a spicy finish. Not as flavorful or refreshing as current ipas/dipas out there such as enjoy by, flower power, or sucks. I love founders but have come to expect more. brand aside this is a solid beer but it didnt wow me."
"Overall: Just a solid imperial IPA. Really intense but not a hop bomb, despite the way this review sounds. Highly recommend and a good value...wish it was lower ABV so I could drink more!"

"Poured into a FFF Alpha King glass. The beer its self is golden yellow and hazy with a thin white head about a finger thick. I can't say this beer is very pretty but it certainty is not ugly. The first smell is pine with citrus and grapefruit and hints of mango. This IPA is more on the piny side but there is a nice complexity to keep it from being one dimensional. The taste is earthy, sweet, piny, and fruity. One of the more complex tasting DIPAs I've had recently. I think a lot of DIPAs try to be hop bombs and pallet strippers rather then assertive and complex. The mouthfeel is a little thicker and sweeter then I prefer but it's still drinkable. Overall, this is one of the best DIPA buys out there. Its hard to turn it down when its fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic aroma and flavor, though a bit sweet. Very good juicy hop flavor, extremely enjoyable as it warms. Very nice. A bit weird that this was from 4/18 and there's very little head, but the ring of bubbles never dissipates."
""
""
"MF - Smooth. No alcohol. Hides its 9.4% ABV very well."
"O: this is hop nirvana. A great mix of tropical, pine, herbal, bitter and sweet. Aroma was very impressive, taste even better. Definitely a must buy when fresh and in season. Might be the best highly produced dipas."

"Overall, this is excellent Imperial IPA, and should be a must-try for hopheads. The hops are nicely chosen to showcase a wide variety of flavors, and the beer as a whole presents a good measure of countering sugars and breads. While the sheer strength of the hops does lead to an obviously out-of-balance beer, the deliciousness of the overall profile does largely make up for it."

"O: A nice DIPA. There are better ones and worse ones. Based on previous reviews, I was expecting a lot more citrus on the smell and taste, and since I really favor that in an IPA, I was disappointed. The age may have something to do with the lack of citrus, since this bottle was not fresh by any means. I would buy this again if fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an alright DIPA. I expected more from this considering Founders is top class, but this one fell short for me."
"Taste starts with the citrus pine, mild bittering effect in the aftertaste, malt has a stronger than anticipated presence but helps to balance the flavor, nice creamy mouthfeel with a soft but ample amount of carbonation, finishes slightly dry, alcohol is very well-hidden."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love this beer! its a wonderfully balanced DIPA that hits all of your taste buds. its sweet, dry, a nice acidic quality, easy drinking and full of dank hops. awesome stuff. i think i'd give this a 94 or 95."

"O- this is a great double IPA. More up my alley with the overly bitter and hop forward taste, unlike some more malty, sweeter examples."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Having first had this in 2012, this year's release brings back fond memories. The more I drink this, the more I like it. Very easy-drinking for an 8%+ ABV IPA, and probably one of my top ten DIPAs."
""
"O: Great great beer. Delicious balance for a """hop-bomb""" style beer. Jim Koch should try this one next time he wants to criticize aggressively hopped beers. <4.75>"
""
""
""
"Pours an unimpressive pale yellow color that is too clear with a thin white head and poor retention. I figured a DIPA brewed by one of the worlds top breweries would look more full than this. Nose is resiny, hoppy, and a bit boozy. The astringent hops and pine notes overpower anything else in the nose. Tastes the same but finishes with a bitter-sweet bite and a nice chewy body. This is a decent DIPA but it pales in comparison to Hercules or Good People's Snakehandler for the matter."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice beer. If I would have had this 2 years ago I would have thought it was incredible, but there are just so many great DIPAs out there these days. This one is well above average, but there are many better DIPAs available. This falls in the category of, 'will likely pick up a 4 pack once a year when it comes out, but wouldnt go out of my way to obtain'."
"O - After half of one of these my palate has fully adjusted and is able to pick up more flavors than the powerful bitters, founders doing its thing as usual."
""
"Overall: This is a very good representative of the DIPA (Double Imperial Pale Ale) style. Great summer-time porch sipping beer."
""
""
"O: Frankly, I didn't look this one up before buying at the store. What a pleasant surprise! Good session beer for the spring and summer months ahead."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 5 - again, wow! I have never had this imperial IPA before but it hits all the high notes for me: huge grapefruit and onion/garlic aroma, slap of bitterness on the anterior tongue and super dry; this is definitely going into my top 5 DIPAs and the only beer that comes to mind that can compete is Surly Abrasive --> I need a side-by-side comparison pronto; anyway, buy, trade, sell your wares on the street to get this beer if you love hop-forward imperial IPAs!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Founders does a fine job on this one. As always they produced something excellent. If you're not into the grapefruit rind flavor, I'd stay away. I love the fact that this is such an easy drinker while hiding the ABV well. Nice beer and definitely worth a try."

"Another homerun by Founders. Born and raised in New Jersey we unfortunately do not get many of the top beers in our state (that needs to change). Thank god for Founders because the quality beers they put out makes it easier for us who miss out on Russian River, Three Floyds and such. This beer is why you have to drink craft beer because when you drink a beer like this you really want to thank the people who make them. This beer is extremely easy to drink and you will not notice the ABV so be warned ... go slowly and enjoy."
""
"Overall, this is a great ale."
""
""
""
"The taste is where this one falls off the wagon for me compared to the great DIPA's of our time. It's solid, but lacks the overall direction certain other brews have. The grapefruit is very noticeable as well as the pine. It just doesn't come together for me. The feel is great, full bodied with a dry bitter finish. The price point is also way too high for what you get. To me this is the worst value in DIPA land."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Another great seasonal from Founders! On a personal level this beer delivers my favorite style with an ideal mix of flavors. It is probably best when fresh and is good on its own or would pair nicely with a spicy dish. Would I drink it again? Yes, in my immediate future."
"Nice resiny, hops at the forefront, but very well balanced by the maltiness. Nice citrusy, floral taste with a very nice hop bitterness. The malt keeps it from being over powering. It has a very nice, bready quality. This is by far one of the best IPA's I've had. I'm very impressed by the balance and flavor on this brew."
""
"O: A very nice DIPA with plenty of citrus hops and a good balance. Alcohol nicely hidden as well. Get some if you can find it"
""
""
"O: Another fantastic beer from Founders. Hops are the star of the show here, making this a must-try for any hop head worth his salt. Get it while it's out there and get it while it's fresh."

""
""

"Good balance of extremes between malt and hops. Given the introduction of more citrus forward flavoring hops, this brew won't rank as high in my list as it may have at one time, but it's still a great dipa. Not overly bitter, fairly complex hop flavoring, and good malt support. May actually be a tad sweet."
"Overall: Founders killed it with this one (not surprisingly). They don't get much recognition in the hop department, but this is easily in the same league as hopslam or any of the other top-tiered midwest DIPA's."
"It reminds me a lot of HopSlam and turns my world upside down / :"

""
""

"Overall (4.25): This is a really solid, well-crafted DIPA that does everything it’s supposed to do, and quite well. It’s not ground-breaking in any way, either, but it’s still damn good. It’s got a full and varied hop flavor with solid but never overwhelming bitterness, with an understated malt body that has a character of its own—but still knows to stay out of the way. Definitely a very good DIPA, and proof that Founders knows what they’re doing with this style of beer."

"O: This is a really good DIPA, but it can be pretty harsh on the palate. Mine is blasted right now. PALATE BLASTER! I'm confused with sticky sweets, oily bitters, and alpha acids that just won't go away. I will drink this again, but I'm reminded why I an not a fan of most DIPAs and TIPAs."

"O: allthought really loving hops I am having difficulty telling what is good and what is not in alot of ipa styled beers. Even thought I love intense hopiness it can mask the bad in a beer very well, I would think. The higher alcohal level in this one pulls more malltiness out of it and lets you feel alot more of the nice flavors underneath the hops. Great beer, great taste, definitely something I will return too."

"Well this is another winner in my book. It pours a hazy straw color eventually becoming clear. The head is minimal, but there is plenty of observable lacing. Smell is pine, resin, maybe even (maybe I'm crazy) mint. Mouthfeel is excellent. It is full and satisfying. Taste is a beautiful sweet fruit upfront and a pronounced bitterness on the finish followed by the warmth you might expect from a higher ABV volume beer. But it is amazing just how well this beer is balanced. The alcohol is well masked with the only real hint taste wise being the warm feeling at the very end. This beer is just pretty awesome!!!"

"Overall - after returning to Michigan from Wisconsin, I now find Double Trouble everywhere. It's hard to buy anything else when I'm in the mood for a double IPA!"
"O - Overall, this beer was good, however not something that I would pick up again. It was simply too bitter in my opinion. Not that bitter is a terrible thing, it's just that usually when I'm wanting to enjoy an IPA I actually want to enjoy the flavors and not just the ridiculous boozyness. BUT, for it being 9.4%, I guess I can't complain. However, for $4 a bottle, I will definitely pass in the future."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It looked good in the glass (if a little paler than expected), smelled fine (some imperial IPAs really give away the alcohol in the odor), and tasted pretty good. I've had beers of this style that are not at all subtle, so I gave this Double Trouble fairly high marks because it is a pretty good representative of its class."

"Overall: Excellent beer overall. While the bottle I had was over 4 months old, the hops really hadn't faded like I feared they would have. I'd love to try it fresh. I would highly recommend trying this one. I really wish I had more than just the one bottle. Too bad Founders doesn't distribute down here in southwest Florida."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. IPA#2 for IPA Day and another great one."

"Overall: A very well balanced and enjoyable DIPA. I have had this on draft and in a bottle many times before. This one can be enjoyed over and over again."

"Double Trouble has always been one of my favorite, local IPAs. I really wish it was available year-round, but a seasonal release means you always know that you're getting it fresh, and this stuff is amazing when it's fresh, so I guess there is a nice trade-off. So out of kilter towards the hops, but in such a lovely and delicate way. Tastes like a DIPA with the drinkability of an APA."
""
""
"O-Great DIPA! Easy drinking even with the high ABV, it's well hidden. Definitely at the top of my list."
"Overall: I'm really impressed with this beer fresh. Delicious, but just a bit too much alcohol."
""
"I like it for its hops bitterness and surprising pineapple flavor. The high alcohol presence takes away from this one. And it's a bit one dimensional."
""
""
"O - Overall, if you're an IPA fan you should really try one of these. It holds it's own against some of the best DIPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a pint glass. nice hazy orange with strong 2 finger head. Some nice alcohol lacing. Good head retention as well. Aroma has some strong carmel notes with a good citrus blend. Taste is has more grapefruit then the smell and it goes down great. Mouthfeel is wonderful and thick with a desire to drink it quick. Overall a great DIPA by Founders. Would definately try again."
""
"O - Man this thing is bitter. Luckily, that’s what most people are looking for these days in a DIPA. This beer is delicious, but I don’t think I could drink more than one due to the high level of bitterness and the heat from the alcohol. Besides this, it looks good and smells terrific. I’ve had more drinkable DIPAs, but this is still very tasty."
""
""
"o: my favorite hop bomb, dangerously drinkable yet incredibly complex from the aroma to the taste."
"Bright transparent yellow on the pour with a frothy white head. Great retention, beautiful lacing. Wonderful aroma with pale malts, yeast, citrus fruit, grapefruit and bread. Big hop bite and grapefruit twang on the first sip. Dry pine and citrus follow through the overall body. A crisp, tart finish. Clean, hoppy mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Another winner from Founders. I'm not a hophead, but these imperial IPA's are really selling me."

"Overall: Double Trouble is an excellent example of the Imperial IPA style thanks to its relative adherence to the hallmarks of said style. Those who aren’t fond of particularly rindy tastes need not apply. Personally, this reviewer prefers Bells Hopslam to this offering from Founders, but there is no question this is an excellent (and slightly cheaper) way to experience a delicious DIPA. The best thing Double Trouble has going for it is the way it keeps you coming back for another swig, and once there, it does not disappoint as it seems to get better and better towards the bottom of the glass. 16.5/20"
"Overall: Big-bitter-hop-bomb. The lack of any malt presence really allows this beer to showcase the hops. Definitely a top 10 IPA/DIPA. Obviously best drank fresh, but still good after a few months"
""
"Overall: A very good beer but in a genre with so many good beers, this one doesn’t stand out."

"O- very good dipa from Founders. Nice citrus flavors with a good punch of bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"O. Very lovely. Nicely balanced. A really flavorful IPA."
"Pours a hazy, yellowish, lemony, cloudy pils-ish, with extensive, sedimentary like lacing forming after each drink. The color surprising for a DIPA, I think. Nose is hoppy, coniferous, citrus-iferous, delightful. Taste is rich, clean malt up front, little roasted notes (which is good too), sweetish on the first taste, moderating subsequently. Hop follows cheifly with citrus assertiveness first, then some O-chemistry following. Mouthfeel is on the slightly thick-ish side, marginally syrupy, but overall, a super interesting approach to a DIPA and one I'll buy again. This is less alchol forward, and although all hopped up at 86 IBU's, you'd never know it given the great balance of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely hop forward, but is still really excellent overall. It's high alcohol, but the hops are more prominent than any booziness."
"Overall: a nice, subtle Imperial IPA. Perhaps a bit too subtle, indeed, for the style, which typically requires a more in-your-face attitude. Still, very nice, and I would definitely have this again if given the chance."

"O: I'd forgotten how good an Imperial IPA this was - been quaffing down Palate Wreckers, 471's, 90 Minute IPAs, Shipyard's XXXX, and the like for some time now without returrning to an old favorite. As is true with most? all? Founders brews, this is a top-notch beer."
""
"Overall: A heavy-handed dose of hops in this. Big and bitter, but some balance would have been nice - though maybe that's just my mood."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright, golden yellow in color and hazy. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Pungent citrus hop aromas, grapefruit, ripe pineapple, with an underlying malt sweetness and pine hop aromas at the back end. Aroma gets boozy as this warms. Medium bodied with rich carbonation. Slightly resinous up front and creamier through the middle. Pine hop flavors up front that allow a citrus hop blast thru the middle the rides all the way to the end as the pine hop flavor returns. Pine hop bookends with citrus in between. Finishes with tongue clenching hop bitterness that lingers. Easily one of my favorite doubles."
"O-very drinkable especially for its ABV. great beer for a summer day"
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid IIPA. My first brew from Founders. Was looking for KBS, but fell upon this and was pleasantly surprised. Worth a try for sure if you like this style."
""
"O - Kept waiting to drink several of my IPA/IIPA with a buddy but schedules just didnt permit so I am making my way through them. This beer is tasty and as its a Founder's brew I am sure its amazing at its peak. However due to its age now, its not what it should be (my fault not the beers). Rating is based on this one but will be revised once I lay hands on a fresher version. It's Founder's...its got to be good!"

"O: Not the easiest beer to drink and definitely too strong and too intense to be sessionable. The flavors are very nice though very hoppy and there is an alcohol presence."

"Double Trouble is a very straightforward example of the Double IPA style that does everything right without really standing out in any particular category. A textbook DIPA that provides an easy, tasty drinking experience. Just watch out for the 9.4% ABV."

"This beer has a nice rich golden color body with just a small fizzy head that doesn't hang around long. The smell is full of citrus aroma with some pine notes coming through. The taste is the same as the smell citrus on the front of the tongue, with some malt and some bitterness on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is great, a little bitter after taste on the back of the tongue. Overall i really like this beer and if you are a IPA fan, you must try it."
""
""
""
"O - Double Trouble is a very good, but not great DIPA. It falls just a little bit short in every category of greatness, but it is enjoyable and a good value."
""
""
""
""
"Great brew! Thanks Matt for sharing! Highly recommended, glad I could share this one with a friend!"
""
""
"Ov: This comes close to rivaling Hopslam, I prefer 3F Dreadnaught slightly. A great DIPA. I originally had an old bottle purchased in NYC and was much impressed with the improvement when I had this on tap at Founders. A must try if fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the second Double Trouble I've had, and the first one was a better experience than this one I'm reviewing. So, I'd suggest drinking these within the first 30 days of bottling. That said, it's still very solid with 60 days on it. One of the best Imperial IPAs out there for sure."
""
""
"O- A good solid DIPA. Some of the flavors are a little distracting though. I do love the heavy citrus flavor."
""
""
""
"O - a really solid DIPA, it really reminds me of hopslam for some reason, and that's not a bad thing! happy i grabbed a 4 pack"
""
"Outstanding IPA. Grapefruit nose. Awesome. And when it first hits your taste buds, you get that grapefruit. Then the explosion of hops. When compared to any other IPA (my favorite class of beers) this one simply is hard to beat. My favorite Founder's Brew hands down."
""
""
""
"On tap in a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy yellow orange with one finger of white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit, pine resin, and citrus. Flavor is pine, grapefruit, apricot, and caramel. Mouthfeel is sticky and lightly syrupy. Awesome beer."
""
""
""
"O: This is a DIPA that’s right up my alley. Tropical fruit, flowery malt and high drinkability. Doesn’t feel like it’s attacking my sensibilities. A wonderful beer."
""
""
"O: This is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Founder's never disappoints!"
""
""
""
"Truly a top-shelf beer & a first class DIPA. These are folks who know that you CAN'T PUT TOO MANY HOPS IN DIPA. Kudos to them!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a very good beer. I seem to like it more towards the end of a pint and I dont think thats the 9.5% talking. Letting it warm up brings it to life. Highly drinkable and enjoyable. Greater than the sum of its parts."
""
""
""
""
""

"Fantastic DIPA"
""
"O: As an Imperial IPA, this beer is a fine example: heavier than an IPA in overall texture, but not necessarily overpowering with hops. At 86 IBUs, this beer finds the balance between good hop flavor, without killing your tastebuds for anything else."
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite of the seasonal DIPA releases. Really tasty."
""
"Now Igor- bring me my second Founders Double Trouble of the night!"

"O: this is a great DIPA dont get me wrong but with all of he hype and stature that this beer has in the community i had expected more depth and complexity"
""

"M: Abundant tropical fruits, the tingly bitterness, the hoppy goodness. The other night, I tried this beer blended with KBS. Sounds incredible and doesn't taste half bad. A good IPA from Founders."

"The medium body has a nice stickiness, thanks to the hop oils. Carbonation is medium as well. Double Trouble is a very good beer by one of my top 5 breweries, but there's just too much of a flavor I can't pinpoint that comes a little close to oniony/chemical/medicinal. Overdone Simcoe or Summit? Don't get me wrong: If I brewed this I would be ecstatic. But there are more than a few IIPAs out there that are better (and cheaper) than this."
""
""
""
""
""
"So I just finished off a growler (64oz) of this beautifully concocted beer. What appeared to be almost a blonde, was full of great aroma, robust floral taste with large hoppy greatness, and a very sweet finish. Looking forward to enjoying this tasty treat in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This DIPA is unmistakably of Founders origin, showing off a collection of qualities from a few other pale ales. While malt never really gains much purchase in the flavor of this beer, the malt component of the smell reminds of the wonderful Founder's Harvest Ale. Flavors are more reminiscent of Devil Dancer, although that other beer is more like a distilled and syrup-ified version this product. The hue is inspiring, indicative of a deep understanding by the brewers of how an IPA is supposed to look, although the conspicuous lack of head development detracts. It is a decent DIPA, although it could benefit from a shift of hop additions more toward the back-end."
"O: World class beer one of the best DIPA I have ever had."
""
"O-really enjoyed this one. Great taste and not impossible to get your hands on."
"Overall: I can see why it's a top 15 brew. Enjoyed and would buy again."
""
"Overall: This was a pretty big grapefruit bomb which isn't a preferred style of IPA for me. I know there are some people that love this stuff and I can appreciate it and how well the alchohol is hidden in there, but it's just not for me."
""
""
"Glad to try, but if I were to buy a DIPA it would not be this one. I would purchase other ones before this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Pound for pound this is one of the best DIPAs around. Considering the availability, I am surprised we dont hear more about this one. I much prefer it to Hopslam. Between this and Harvest Ale, Founders is knocking this style out of the park."
"Overall: This is a great double IPA! You wouldn't really think by tasting or looking at this beer that its 9.4% although you'll start feeling it by the end of the bottle. Another excellent beer from one of the best breweries this country has to offer: Founders."
"The bitterness of the beer is spot on, and will make any true hop head very pleased. Enjoy!"
""
"On tap at el Bait Shop. A pretty orange color with plenty of foam. Even with my allergies going crazy I can still smell the fruity hops and a touch of pine. The taste is just fantastic. Lots of citrus, with some grape and pine. It seems just a tad on the earthy side. It finishes with some lingering tartness, and you start ot feel the alcohol about 1/2 way through the glass. I'd say it's comparable to Hopslam but it's available for more than 2 weeks of the year."

"This beer pours a hazy, semi-transparent golden with an average white head. Strongly hoppy aroma has a hint of evergreen. Powerful hoppy flavor has firm tones of evergreen and grapefruit, quite sour. Lively, fizzy texture has firm body and is quite pleasing."
""
"A good DIPA that hits a lot of the great hop flavors, minus citra overload, but it is heavy and highly drinkable. Not that that is a bad thing, but it is different from a lot of more quaffable DIPAs. I like it and would get it again."

"12oz bottle with a Bottled date of 02/09/12. Pours a vibrant amber with very little head. Some lacing. Aroma is musty with some pine, and earthiness. Taste is piney and earthy. Some hints of citrus and warming alcohol. Musty, earthy finish. Basement-like. Not really digging this all that much. Lightly carbonated. Im diasppointed with this one. Overall, the musty flavor is too much for me. There's a ton better double IPAs out there and many better Founders brews as well. I'll pass on this in the future."
""
"M: Slippery, and soapy, with an intense grassy hop dryness."
"Big thanks to Illudium for the sample!"

"Overall: You know what, if you are an IPA person like myself this will be one of your go to beers every time you step into a beer spot. You get everything you want, the feel of alcohol, incredible carbonation, drink with love. Salud!"
""
""

"Overall – It has very good qualities that many Double IPA fans would like. Its appearance, nose, mouthfeel and initial taste are all great, with the only thing that doesn’t do it for me being the very persistent grapefruit flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark gold with orange hues, bright white one and a half finger head, great retention, considerable lacing. Strong aroma of citrus, flora, and piney hops. Initially dry grapefruit dominates shifts to a touch of marginally sweet malt finishes dry with piney hop bitterness. Slick and satisfying, medium to heavy body thanks to a more than adequate malt backbone. Double Trouble has all the attributes of what I look for in an IIPA, noticeable bitterness, floral and citrus notes, controlled tones of sweetness, plenty of body and a pleasant dry finish. Belongs in the top tier of the style."

"Overall this was a good DIPA that I would seek out again."

"Notes: Bottled 2/23/12. Grabbed a 4 pack to celebrate Founders coming to Iowa. Overall a nice DIPA. Not over the top but a balanced hoppy treat. A touch sweet but not overly cloying. Overall a very nice beer to sip on during a beautiful spring day."

"Overall a pretty good drink. Delicous fruity delight that will keep me coming for more of these DIPA's!"

"Carbonation on the high side with a full body and a sipping-quality of drinkability, overall Double Trouble hits the spot."

"O - Another great offering from Founders. Good drinkability and flavor. One of the better double IPAs I've had."

"Double Trouble is one of the best """accessible""" double IPAs on the market. I really like how it straddles the line between balanced and easy drinking, yet bitter and intense."
""
""
"Overall, I’m not a hop head by any means, but this is a very good DIPA, and will lead me to trying even more. Once again, Founders gives us a world class beer."
"O- This is definitely a good DIPA. Up there with some of my favorites, however it still doesn't compare to some top notch ones such as Heady Topper. In order to reach that level it would definitely need to be a little bit sweeter and hoppier. Overall though this was definitely a quality beer. Definitely would recommend it as a go to DIPA if Pliny, Citra, Heady Topper, etc. isn't available to you."
""
""
""

"Overall; I have yet to have a bad brew from Founders, 'nuff said!"
"O - Outstanding and worth looking out. If you see this beer on tap, absolutely order it. It's amazing on draft and great bottle."

"Served in half pint glass at New Albanian's Gravity Head."
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a snifter, the beer is a very bright, vibrant, orange-gold coloring with a fluffy, big bubbled, off-white head of about a half an inch. Aromas are amazingly blended, with a light orange and grapefruit citrus blend mixing with a floral, wet, fresh hops aroma. This smells really friggin good. Flavors are lighter than you would expect, with a solid toasty and rich caramel backbone giving rise to a hop forward blast of tart and bitter grapefruit and spicy, wet, fresh hops. Palate is amazingly blended, and the body is smooth and light, which helps the beer to avoid becoming overpowering. Decent lacing along the glass, and this is an easy drinker. The aftertaste is smooth, with a slight touch of hops cleaned up by the citrus notes. Clean, smooth, and slightly dry finish. This is a good damn beer!"
""
""
""
"O- An amazing DIPA with a great mouthfeel, huge hop bitterness, and juicy tropical/citrus fruit flavors. Taste is maybe not quite a 5, but I will make up for some of that here, it falls between a 4.5 and 5 in taste."

""
""

"A huge DIPA. This is proof the west coast has competition in the IPA category"
""
"O- Very enjoyable, this beer is definitely a vehicle for the robust hopiness that any hop-head will love"

"Pours clear and straw yellow, smells strongly of hops and some sweetness. Taste is dominated by hops, some citrus, grassy and piney hops. Pronounced hop resin lingers all over the mouth, palate is completely destroyed. Carbonation is good and mouthfeel"

"overall: great beer. great taste. thanks again Founders."

"o- i paid roughly the same price for this 32oz growler as i did for a 4pack of 12 oz. The difference was 16 oz. Considering double trouble is long gone, i didn't mind at all. The beer was fresher and just as delicious as i remembered."

"Moderate carbonation with clean, crisp, but extraordinarily bitter finish. Green, dank, piney aftertaste. This is a pretty well rounded but incredibly dank and hoppy DIPA. For a teeth curling hop fix, I would seek this out. Not exceptional, but pretty good."
"overall its a nice IPA with a good nose. wish the taste was a little more crisp"
""
"Pours a yellowish color with a slightly cloudy consistency and a nice fluffy, creamy head. Smells amazing. Zesty grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is excellent, nice blend of creamy texture and hop zest and bite on the tongue. Taste is dominated by the citrus hops and a hoppy dry finish. Good lacing on the way down. A very pleasant experience, and the alcohol is completely hidden."

"For not having some chew to the body and a lack of sweetness for balance, I'll knock a half-point. Still a killer brew and strongly recommended for hopheads all around."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a yellow-orange with a very small white head that fades quickly. Smell is all citrus and hops, grapefruit, pineapple, almost mango, with floral hops and sweetness. The taste has a nice hop kick at the beginning with a hint of bitterness. The citrus is present from start to finish with another hop kick in the aftertaste. Grapefruit flavors stand out as well in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is ok, could be a bit smoother, but still a nice medium mouthfeel, giving you a """chewing on hops""" feel. Overall a great beer, lots of flavor complexity, lots going on here wrapped into a really tasty beer. Definitely a hop lovers delight."
"O-top five DIPA for me. Really smooth with a wonderful hop aroma and flavor. Great beer by Founders, of course."
""
"O- Very refreshing. Glad I bought a 4 pack."
""
""
""
"Very high carbonation content, with a hint of citrus. This beer fits me to a T!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Real nice. A great and well balanced DIPA with great character."
""
""
"O: Founders has it here, possibly the best DIPA I've ever had. Juicy, hoppy, wet and dry. This is awesome stuff, try some."
""
"Overall: This is a taste DIPA. Founder still delivers a quality brew that excells for its style. I would like more malts in this beer for balance, but I have nothing else to complain about. It an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall one of my absolute favorite DIPA's to date always look forward for this fresh.Founders crushes another one out of the park."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden/amber color with a thin head. There is only a minimal amount of lacing as the beer goes down. Aroma is wonderful - on the surface - a bouquet of lime, pineapple and grapefruit, while there is a hint of pine resin lurking beneath. A detect a wisp of something slightly powdery or soapy as well. The beer seems surprisingly light for a DIPA - especially given the ABV. This is actually a huge plus. As for the flavor, it is quite dry and straightforward. Pleasantly bitter. It's very good, but not bursting with citrus flavor or teeming with hop resin as the aroma suggests it might be. I am certain this is fresh as well. Solid, but not my fav. DIPA."
""
""
"O: Good stuff."
"O-A great DIPA, similar to Double Jack. Founder's made a wonderful DIPA and I'm looking forward to having more of their beers."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a big hop bomb. Bitter strong hops mixed with pine and a bit of sweet malty caramel hidden. Its bitter but not overly so. The alcohol is very well hidden. I do wish the fruity pineapple aroma played through into the flavor. Very good dipa and i would recommend to anyone who likes the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is another great DIPA from the north center of the US. Better then Hopslam but not quite as amazing as I hoped."
""
""
""
"O: An excellent DIPA. I do wish the juicy fruity hoppiness I smelled in this beer transferred directly into the flavor, but the flavor was quite good nonetheless. The beer is also dry while imparting some malty sweetness. Great balance."
""
"This is always compared to Bell's Hopslam. So here's my take on the issue. Double Trouble is less balanced, more bitter and more astringent. I personally favor Hopslam because I prefer a little more balance in my DIPAs but hardcore hopheads are sure to love this."
""
""
""
""
"I found this to be a raw, brutalist cold-cock of hops. To some, certainly this is a compliment, and sometimes I mean it that way, but in this case, I found it crossed my flinch line. The only really standout part of this beer was the mouthfeel. Founders always nails body and carbonation just right. Only a dyed-in-the-wool hop maniac would love this beer. As for me, I merely liked it."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great, well balanced DIPA. Not as huge as some but great hop variety and balance. Solid."
""
""
"Best on tap, but good in any form. Pours perfectly clear solid gold with a big one finger head, fluffy white, and lingering. The aroma exhibits heavy floral and citrus (especially grapefruit) notes, beautifully integrated with what seems to be a honey sweetness from the malt backing. Flavor is heavy citrus and floral with nice bite, big grapefruits, pineapples, honey. Finishes extremely smooth with mild bitterness and a sweetness lingering on the palate. Light and bubbly carbonation, easy drinking for the ABV. Great beer."
""
""
""
"O - One of the best DIPAs I've had. Almost a guaranteed buy when I find it."
"Pours out a golden yellow hue with a thick white head that leaves minimal lacing and retention. The aroma has a very pleasant citrus and pine. The taste starts out with a pine and citrus (orange, grapefruit and lemon) followed by hints of sweet malts and finishes off with more hops. The mouthfeel is a medium to full bodied beer that is full of flavor that leaves your mouth dry. A nice tasting Dipa that is very bitter, so if your not a fan of bitter beer this might not be for you, but recommended for anyone that likes a bitter tasting Dipa."
""
"Overall this is a delicious DIPA, though still can't hold a candle to HeadyTopper/Pliny."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a no-holds-barred assault of hops, and I feel it could be a bit more balanced. The grapefruit, grass, and pine are nothing short of intense. This is definitely worth a try, even if it is not personally my favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on draft into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a beautiful hazy golden wih a thick head. Nose is hop heavy and loaded with citrus. Taste follows the nose closely and its solid. The mouthfeel is mad bitter but I enjoy it. Overall this is great.Definitely try it"
""
""
""
"O: Great beer, Great flavor, but drinkability isn't good enough for this beer to be as highly rated as it is."
""
""
""

"Overall an exceptional double IPA."
"O: Great Imperial IPA, not too strong, great blend and great beer, I want more than a 4 pack!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- like this beer a lot. I look forward to its release if you can find it try hopslam by bells brewery nothing like it and best dpia imo, also try lake erie onster by great lakes brewing co."
""
""
"O - Everything comes together to make a great double IPA."
""
""
"Truly a winner and a contender for my favorite beer of all time."
""
""
"Overall: Founders, as they so often do, win the battle here again for me. Hopslam is great, but Double Trouble takes things to just higher a level with the full aromatics, juicy flavor, and just a bit of resistance in the mouthfeel. Love, as always. 5/5"
""
""
"This has a pleasant grassy aroma, and pours a hazy golden color with a head that dissipates quickly. There is a sweet attack of ruby grapefruit and pineapple, with a long bitter finish. The hops are aggressive and provide plenty of bitterness. This beer isn't balanced - and that's a good thing. Certainly one for hop heads - I enjoyed this a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite good. I enjoy it and would have another, but it's not my favorite Founders."
""
"O: Overrated. A middling DIPA, but heavy on the hops (at least in the bottle). Not my favourite Founders. Recommended for hopheads, but not worth the hype."
"Overall, a little bit of a let down coming from Founds, but different. Sure some love it and that's what the beer world go 'round."
""
""
""
"As always with founders, awesome artwork on the label. Poured into a tulip. Half finger of bright white head, with foggy glowing orange body. Dank fruity hops on the nose. Lots of citrus, melon, a little lemon zest. Palate is smooth, and full. Lots of sweet malt balancing a bitter hoppiness. Some nutmeg or some other spice on the back of the palate. Smooth as hell and not too carbonated. Awesome brew!"
""
"edit: 2013 bottle drank fresh.. liking it way more. not sure if it's because my palate has developed or because it's just better this year. re-scored. went from a 3.25 to a 4."
""
"Overall, beyond decent. This is an excellent IPA. Stands out for sure."
""
""
""
""
"O. This is an ok beer. Definately easy to drink and chug down. Alcohol is not their at all. Price is the only thing holding this back. Their are 6 packs out their with just as good taste that cost less."
""
""
"O- This is a very good DIPA. Maybe it would get an even higher score from me had I not drank some Bell's Hopslam the past two days. Definitely glad I found this one though and not sorry one bit at all that I drank yet another killer beer from Founders."
"O: Pretty good. The caramel and citrus hops integrate really, really well on the nose, but the taste is something of a let down. Reminds me a bit of West Coast IPA with a little less hop flavor."
"Pours a light orange/yellow with a small head when poured down the middle of a snifter. Hops and grapefruit just assail the nose. The taste is all hops and citrus with just a hint of pine. The bitterness is way up there. This is very dry leaving me feeling as though I need to hydrate. This one is a bruiser of an imperial IPA. The name fits well. No finessing here. No balance either. Hop monster. For my palate this bruiser was just too much of a good thing."
""
""
""
"Cheers..."
"Overall, this is a very nice, subtly complex Double."
""
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 1/6/2012. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops (tropical fruit, orange peel, grapefruit), with some pine hops and some sweet malt noticeable too. The taste is similar to the aroma, the citrusy hops are strongest (grapefruit, orange peel and tropical fruit), and some pine hops and sweet malt flavors are also in there. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish, no surprise there. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's sticky and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brew, I'd buy this again. $11.99 a 4-pack."
""
"O: A very nice beer teetering on the verge of being boozy, ultimately balancing out with a blast of sweet sweet hops. Another great beer from one of the best breweries in the world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first time I have tried this and I am glad I did. I will look forward to its release every year. Recommended."
"O- A tasty beer that I wish was around more. For a style that can be fatiguing, this one drinks well."
"O Nice stuff that is very bitter and not balanced, which I like alot. I'll let it warm up a little and see how it changes"
""
"Overall: I have always loved Double Trouble, but wish it wasn't a seasonal. The price is right at $2.75 a bottle just wish I didn't have to soak up as much as possible when its around."
""
""
"Golden and clear with plenty of head and healthy lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit, but toned down, earthy, with a hint of pine. Carbonation is a bit high for my liking and body is light side of medium. Drinks like a DIPA. Lots of citrus and grapefruit middle through the end and noticeable alcohol. Laid back bitter finish."
"O: Such an easy drinking Imperial IPA. A really nice offering from Founders. Pretty inexpensive at roughly $2 a bottle. Can't go wrong with Double Trouble! Just don't tip the bottle upside down before finishing off the contents inside..."
""
"Overall this a solid dipa and a pretty tasty beer. However this is nothing spectacular in a world with PtE, Abrasive, and Heady Topper. This is a more widely distributed brew than those others so it gets some points for accessibility. Worth a try if you like the style."
""
"This is a very good offering from Founders. Great hop profile here. What you expect from a DIPA. They did a great job with this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A decent brew. Not anything overly amazing. It’s a very one sided DIPA compared to most of what I have had. Only semi-interesting. Would be okay to kill a fewe for a buzz, but not something I will likely buy in the future. There are a lot of readily available beers in-store I would grab first."
""
""
""
""
"O: Personally given the choice, I'd rather have Founders Breakfast Stout, but this will do in a pinch nicely. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great brew that any DIPA fan should check out. While it is not the best IPA I have ever had, I would never decline one."
"very nice and smoothe with a bitter kick at the end"
""
"Overall: Drinking this side by side with a Hopslam, I find these beers so different that I am surprised that so many have chosen to make the comparison in their reviews; while the citrusy aspect is similar, this beer is more bitter, resinous and cloying"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great example of the style. Really showcases the hops, very little malt flavor to be found. At the same time very drinkeable and not overly bitter. Highly recommended for fans of a lighter colored hop focused double. How does it compare to Hopslam? How the fuck should i know, i didnt get to the store early enough in the day and probably shouldn't be spending $20+ dollars on a sixer anyway."
"Overall: Very solid. One of the more grapefruit-forward DIPAs I've encountered."
""
""
""
"Reviewed on: 01-12-2011 02:13:21"
"O - A wonderful seasonal DIPA by Founders. Definitely meant to be had fresh, I've had last years after it was sitting on shelf for quite a while; completely different beer. Cheers!"
"O: Above average IIPA, maybe methods of shipping took away from carbonation? Maybe I'm being a bit picky? Still very good, the smell was awesome to me"
"O: A very great DIPA. It's much more hop-forward than a lot of other DIPAs, but it's still pretty complex. The whole array of hop flavors are represented here. This is a hopheads dream."
"O: This is a new favorite for IIPA's, while this may be my first review on BA, I have been trying every IIPA I can get my hands on and review them off the record, but I finally decided it is time! I'd highly recommend this beer especially if you don't mind your IIPA's to have that tangerine, grapefruit like flavor. The malt in my mind is very subtle, but with this beer style, I think that is fairly normal. Either way, this is a solid 4.5 beer in my book, can't wait to have another. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: great beer - what happened from last year to this year that it's so hard to find? Last year it sat on shelves, and this year it's gone within a couple of weeks. Very drinkable, especially for a DIPA. Great beer, and thank you to Treebs for the extra."
"Overall, this is a solid DIPA from Founders. I honestly don't think that these guys can do wrong. I would have liked it to have had a tad bit more carbonation but other than that this was a flawless brew. Very happy that I received a four pack of this. It won't last long...."
"This is a very enjoyable, drinkable IPA. I have had it on several other occasions and will probably have it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- Man what a fabulous DIPA, a real showcase for delicious hops. Some people might not agree with me, but personally I slightly prefer this to Hopslam, it's less boozy and sweet but has such a great vibrant fruit flavor and great bitterness, exactly how I like my IPAs. I mean damn, Founders."
""
"O- I was not let down by this beer, really bitter, big hop bomb, another solid offering from Founders."
""
""
"O - Very nice beer. I was happy to get this one so fresh and I wasn't disappointed. The hops aren't masked too much with sweetness, yet it is very balanced. I will definitely get this one again."
"If there were more ways that I could say this is a great IPA, I would. But bottom line is that this beer is the integration of everything that is IPA about an IPA, distilled by a factor of 2 ("""Double""" IPA). With a better glass this might have wowed further, but in a standard pint it was still exceptional."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottle dated 1/06/12. Pours a clear orange yellow, with a one inch fluffy white head, with attractive lace. Smell is tangerine, pineapple, pine, and some grass. Taste is all of that with nothing dominating, with a hit of grapefruit in the finish. Body is on the large side, still very approachable, in-between lush and dry, with plenty of life. This is really one of the best DIPAs period. Love this brewery."
""
"The taste was just what was as expected given the high ABV and IBU numbers. It is citrus at the front, followed by a wall of hops, with an alcohol aftertaste at the end. Overall, this is a decent double IPA, which I probably say because I like the style so much, but I would not go searching out just for this one. It definitely satisfies those hop heads though."
""
""
""
"D - I actually really enjoyed the nuances in the aroma but the flavors (while overt) are not complex enough to match some newer recipes."
""
""
""
"Founders continues to make some of the best beer. Am looking forward to trying the KBS."
""
""
""
"recommended."
""
""
"Overall experience is great! Nothing I can say about this that I don't like. Will be difficult to drink for hte next few hours as I watch the Ravens/Patriots in the AFC Championship game, but I will do my best! Cheers!!!!"
"O - Definitely a great DIPA, especially when really fresh like this bottle. Really like how the citrusy aspects stand out here...been fortunate enough to be able to have fresh Heady Topper, Hopslam, and this in the last few days...have to say this really stands up favorable against those other two fine DIPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad I was able to try, but does not stack up against many of the other great midwest DIPA's. Would enjoy a Hopslam or Dreadnaught over this every time."
""
"Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The more I drink Founders beer, the more I appreciate how solid everything they put out is. This is an excellent DIPA, maybe a half step below Hopslam"
""
""
""
""
"This is definately a fanatastic beer. I really like my uber hop forward IIPAs, but this is a great beer and belongs ranked with some of the best. Surely try it if you get the chance."
"Overall, a really solid IPA. I think it's fantastic, but not a world-changer. Heresy for a Founders product? I don't think so, they make great beer, but I don't feel the need to camp out in line before each new release."
"First time trying this. Poured to a big pint glass. Color is light orange. Amazing nose of citrus, hops, and lots of melon. Lacing all the way down the glass and the head lasts the entire time I'm drinking. Tons of melon on the flavor. Lots of citrus and hops, with a bitter back end, but it's the melon that really stands out. Mouthfeel is medium and the bitter finish hangs on the tongue for quite a while. Very smooth and went down entirely too fast. 9.4 is very well hidden. Overall, this was really tasty. I've definitely had hoppier DIPA's, however the flavor stood out, and the melon was really nice. Yet another stud beer from Founders."
""
"O: An aromatic, flavorful, full-featured DIPA that is balanced and satisfying."
"O- More impressed than I thought I would be. Really great stuff. Will be seeking out more."
"Overall - One of my favorite IPAs, even if slightly imperfect. Too bad I only get it every once in a while. Just shy of being one of the great IPAs, like Pliny and Heady."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good DIPA from Founders. Hard to compete with Hopslam coming out at the same time but it definitely has drinkability. The booze smell is a little bigger but the finish is clean."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a pretty good beer! Solid product by Founders. However, there a few other IIPAs out there I prefer."
""
""
""
"Color, flavor, etc... were flawless and multiple servings could be enjoyed in an evening - this can't be said about many other DIPAs on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip, bottled 12/23/11. Pours slightly hazy bright amber color with a huge 3 finger off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap that lasts for the remainder of the glass. Some decent lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big grapefruit, floral, grass, pineapple, lemon, pine, and some herbal spiciness. Damn nice and fruity aromas here with good strength. Taste of strong grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, pine, and floral notes; with a bit of spice as well. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, grapefruit, pine, and spiciness on the finish for a while. Good balance of bitterness and sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel that drinks very smoothly for being over 9%. No alcohol noticed other than a small warming after the finish. Overall this is definitely a fantastic DIPA. Tons of fruity flavor, with great balance, and smooth drinking for the level of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*Overall: another great IPA from the state of MI..."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very balanced and highly drinkable DIPA IMO. I don't know how Founders made it so light and refreshing, yet have enough flavor and hops to attack the palate but they did. This needs a second release in the dead heat of summer. Please Founders, please."
""
""
"O: This is a very solid Imperial IPA. It has strong fruity flavors, looks very nice and is pretty easy to drink. I wouldnt say the best on the market, but it holds its own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oerall, I like this beer and find it to be underrated. It's up there with the best of them!"
""
""
""
""
"Lots of hop flavor trying to break through, but the bitterness just overpowers a lot of what I think is in there. The substantial malt presence helps to balance this though. Either way, an enjoyable and very midwest imperial IPA."
""
""
"Another win for Founders. Double Trouble is everything I want my DIPAS to be. Piney and citrusy with a bold, complex flavor profile. Outstanding overall balance. One well work to seek and drink."
""
"This beer is drinking like a barley wine at this point (which I expected), and it would be interesting to try it fresh for comparison. I think it's lacking in some of the aromatic citrus notes I prefer in the nose of a hearty DIPA, but I understand that a lot of hops fade after a year of aging. Considering the IPAs I've had from Founders already, I'd say this one is pretty much on par with tho other ones I've had."
""
""
"Overall - This is a beer worthy of the Founders label and of the hype. Founders seems to hit on all cylinders as a rule, not an exception, but this beer takes it to another level. Highly recommended, does not overwhelm your taste buds with nuclear amounts of hops. So good, smooth, drinkable."
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite DIPA's and a better beer IMO than Hopslam. Founders strikes it rich again."
""
""
"Overall this is a very good IIPA. Definitely worth trying."

"O- dam good DIPA but the ABV at 9.4% puts the hurt on real quick. try this if you can but be aware that is does not taste like the ABV!"
""
""
"It’s hoppy, with an aroma of grapefruit zest and pine trees after a summer rainstorm, matched on the palate by flavors of citrus, pine, and a big resiny chewiness. Another excellent Founder’s brew. Those folks in southwest Michigan are so lucky, aren’t they?"

"Overall Impression- While enjoying the Centennial IPA weekly this past year, I was happy to come back to this 2X IPA from Founders again! I definitely recommend this one with its strong citrus hop flavors and punch to the mouth. A hop heads dream! I definitely didn't know this one was over 9% though! I had this for the first time @ the Founders Beer Dinner @ The Stable in Benton Park. Love coming back to good beers!"
"O: Very drinkable for a 9.4% DIPA. Flavors are balanced yet pronounced. Excellent beer."
"O - A solid DIPA all the way around and one of my favorites."
"A good DIPA, plenty of flavor, perhaps too sweet for my tastes, and the ethanol burn and obviousness is a bit of a let down. I'd look for slightly more balance between the alcohol, sweetness, and hops, though still expecting extremes in all of those. For me, the combination here just isn't the right one."
"O: Not bad, still very bitter this far down the road...has some barleywine characters while still maintaining a lighter body."
"A fine beer here. Not my favorite DIPA out there, but still a tasty beer. It's a shame we can't get Founders here in TX, because I know it would sell like gangbusters. Good stuff here."
"Overall: This was one of the first DIPAs I ever had, so I love revisiting it. It still is a great no-coast IPA that provides that crazy burst of grapefruit that we Midwesterner hop-heads love!"
"This was my first DT. Impressed, but not blown away like i was with my first sixes of Hopslam. But they are different beasts. And I prefer my DIPAs meltier and more tilted to hop flavor/aroma rather than bitterness. So Hopslam is definitely more my type. But Double Trouble is a hop heads delight, to be sure."
"O: Another awesome IPA. Loving these Eastern IPA's! WOW! review over!"
"This beer seems like a 9-year-old schoolgirl with her hair in plaits who produces from her Hannah Montana schoolbag a massive morning star and proceeds to garrot every mofo in the vicinity with huge fucking spikes. It seems mild and harmless at first, but brother, it ain't."
"Overall this one is definitely worth checking out."
"Wow. I can't believe just how light, fresh, aromatic and drinkable this is for 9.4% ABV. But the extra potency allows for an absolute bombardment of hoppy freshness, which gives it a intoxicatingly bright and aromatic core. An absolute joy to drink. I'm sure I've not had a more drinkable beer of this weight."
"O - This one is definitely a hop bomb with plenty of tongue buckling bitterness. Seems a bit one dimensional to me though."
"Overall Drinkability - Perfect balance. Tug of war."
"Overall: A good but not great DIPA if I lived in the midwest I would probably drink this on quite a bit"
"Overall a solid double IPA, I enjoyed this one and can't wait to get a fresh one next time it comes out and review it again."
"O: This is a decent brew. I dig the matchmaking of the malts with the hops. This is not balanced, and rightfully so. As a DIPA, I would expect the beer to be dry, hoppy and crisp; kinda like a high quality czech pilsner on roids."
"Well it's Founders so yeah it's good. Very solid brew, but not their absolute best and the bitterness and alcohol would prevent me from drinking more than 1-2 of these per sitting. Solid DIPA."
"Pours crystal clear and scary yellow with a white head. Unadulterated grapefruity hop nose with super sharp grapefruit/citrus hop eyeopeners. Dry, bitter, grapefruity hop flavors..different hop variety than I’m used to out west, but nonetheless, i like the flavor profile generated from them regardless...pretty dry and hop forward for midwest, too...bitter, dry, grapefruity...tasty as all get up, really."
"Full-bodied, rich and not nearly as hoppy as I expected it would be. Fairly heavt coating of the palate, downright sticky. Fortunately, this is not a hop monster IPA like so many currently produced American, just a seriously good Imperial IPA"
"Overall: Very solid overall."
"Pours a hazy light orange-yellow with a 1 inch off-white head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, pine, and some malt aromas. Taste is of sweet malt up front, followed by citrus zest and pine hops, and some pineapple/tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. There is a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA with some nice hop and fruit flavors. I am glad I got to try one of these."
"O- I've had this before (in the winter) and was a bigger fan of it then. Of course, this all boils down to preference, but I do prefer my IIPAs to be hop bombs and almost overwhelmingly so. As it stands, it's a great beer."
"To each his own. I will buy some more of these and revisit soon enough."
"(O) One thing I really like about this beer is it's a pretty straight forward brew. There's not a lot of complexity and it's a solid DIPA. You want a good hoppy beer but with the balance of a great malt foundation, this is a really good beer to reach for."
"The taste is incredible. Like drinking a slightly foamy grapefruit juice. For a high alcohol beer there was very little alcohol impact. I felt a bit of dryness, but the mouth feel was full, creamy and lasting. I drank this with a bit of cheddar and nut thins for a nice complement."
"Overall: Nice. Very rich in flavor. More complex than the average Imperial IPA. Nice mix of malt and hops. A bit on the piney side, but still very pleasant. Everything stands out, nothing is completely overpowered."
"O: Pretty solid Imperial/Double IPA. This beer vaguely reminds me of what an amped up Two Hearted would be like. I enjoyed it."
"Overall not to bad, especially if you're in to big hop flavor. It's just not my favorite DIPA. I think there are some others that are a bit better balanced. Certainly wouldn't turn this down, but probably won't pick up again."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the soft nose. It had robust and present hops, but still seemed to keep a lighter edge, with subdued fruit and a milder grain. These acted to acutely balance out the big hop components, making for a well-balanced brew, but with a nice fresh bite."
"This beer poured out as a nice golden yellow with some orange colors in there. The head was thick and white. The lacing looked really nice too after each sip. The smell of this beer is floral and citrusy, the nose is very fresh smelling and has a very inviting aroma to it. The taste of this beer is really nice also. I was really impressed with the flavors in the brew. The mouthfeel is a little thin but still pretty decent. Overall It's a really nice DIPA and worth getting if you see it."
"Overall: Another very nice beer by Founders. One could have a few of these by flavor and drinkability alone, but the 9.4% ABV makes it a tough sell for a sessioner."
"O: Very different DIPA and interesting. I think this is a brew I need to be in the right mood for but I won't knock it for this. Would try this again, but I'm not sure what I'd be looking for out of the next experience."
"Love this beer, just wish it was a bit cheaper. A great medium between Founders Centennial IPA and Devil Dancer. Cheers!"
"I'd love to have this side-by-side with some of my favorites…Hopslam, Dreadnaught, etc….just to see how it compares, but regardless, I'm glad it's been on the shelves as long as it has!!"
"Overall - I thoroughly enjoyed this and I'm glad that I had the chance to pick this one up."
"T: The malts hit first with some light caramel and a very slight breadiness. Then the hops come in with some notes of pepper, pine and grapefruit. The finish is on the grapefruit note and ends on both a sweet and bitter note. Pretty tasty."
"A pretty decent DIPA, the hops definitely represented, in a non-left-coast manner, and balanced well enough. 86 IBUs? Sure. 9.4% ABV? Could have fooled me - oh, wait, it did."
"First Founders beer. Was super excited. Poured a medium amber with a small amount of head. Lacing was medium. Great nose. Grapefruit and citrus. Taste is well balanced. Not blown away by this like I thought I would be but overall a very good beer. Maybe my expectations were too high."
"A great DIPA and my second taste of founders after KBS. I think I might be looking for more soon"
"O: Pretty surprising for me. Very drinkable for a 9 percent. I think it drank more like a 6.5 or 7. All around a really really good option and good tasting DIPA. Not quite at the top of my list my really good."
"Ok drinker, even at 9.2%. The hop burn lingers in the after-. Well worth a try."
"Overall, the strong pine and grassiness is a bit much for my palate; I prefer a little more citrus balance. Pretty decent IIPA though. I'll have another."
"a bit of honey a bit of pilsner hint and actually quite light and robust at the same time. pours a bit lighter then most... yellow a bit of murk. great protein with a sticky head and good hopping. nice is pine lemon with a pilsner hint in the back. palate is a nice tight floral first and foremost. sweet of honey malt hints. wouldn't say it drops off but it feel rather crisp. nice tingle. reminds me of the long trail for some reason... just as textbook feel but interesting accents."
"O: A very robust, flavorful and boozy DIPA at 9.4%, Double Trouble is just that indeed -- trouble. You likely won't go beyond a second one over the course of an evening session, and the big time hops and alcohol tinge might only play with a spicy Mexican dish. Its a DIPA of unusual quality that is worthy of being called a great beer for those who love killer hop bombs."
"Founders keeps winning me over time and again! This beer is available for about half the year which makes it that much better."
"The beer pours out of the keg golden in color with a thin head and some nice lacing. The look is appetizing, but doesn't do the beer justice on first inspection. Not to sell the taste/drink of this beer short, but the aroma off this beer is outstanding! Off the nose you get all kinds of citrus fruits - tangerines, oranges, grapefruits - which really showcase the high IBU levels of the beer. Despite the large nose, this beer is very well balanced by malts. While balanced, this is still a bruiser of an IPA. You're going to get resin and citrusy hops throughout the drink and finish of this beer. Overall, this is a great beer for all manner of beer lovers."
"Not a whole lot of clear flavors but well-crafted and interesting display of ingredients. Strong but never overbearing, it’s particularly interesting without a big malt backbone. It may be as much as 6 months old (the dates were smudged) but it still has an interesting quality, possibly because of the yeast strain. At any rate, I easily downed 2 and would hope to try on tap at some point."
"O - a slight dissapoinment, slight. but overall a good beer and i can't remember the last time i finished a beer this quick unknowingly, not sure if its me or it has a good drinkability for a big beer. i like the bitterness and sappy characters very much, i would like to see more body and more pungent aromatics."
"The body was well balanced, with some bitterness. Overall this beer was in great shape. Sorry it took me so long to write this down."
"O - Pretty torn about this one. It has all the potential to be a really good beer, but just doesn't come through and deliver."
"Enjoy!"
"Overall a very good offering from founders, looking forward to how it compares to the devil dancer."
"3/31/2011"
"poured into a tulip glass, a nice finger's worth of off-white frothy head is present, and as it subsides, leaves traces all over the glass. The aroma is strong, smelling of a combination of citrus and pine. The color is light gold, lighter than a lot of the doubles out there. The taste is very smooth, a touch of sweet caramel followed by the bitterness. Lots of mouthfeel and very good carbonation. A wonderfuly beer."
"At approximately $60 a case for 24 bottles this is actually a very good buy. Worth it!"
"O: Tasty. Not the best DIPA I've had, but it ranks towards the top 30%..."
"This beer pours a slightly orange but mostly yellow color, with a 1 finger white head. the smell is very citrusy hints of grape fruit and a nice pine scent too. the taste is very hoppy up front with a little bit of a malt back bone to it in the middle and it finishes out with a nice hop bitterness. the mouthfeel is overall pretty good not to heavy for a DIPA and its well carbonated. overall i usually dont like the DIPAs that are over 9% becase they start getting to sweet, this one manages to stay fairly dry"
"pretty solid DIPA without doubt, this would be in my regular rotation for sure if I could get it in my neck of the woods"
"Medium body, nicely carbonated. A pleasant drink in all regards; exactly the type of polished brew I expect from Founders."
"O: This is a nice American DIPA. The taste trumps minor issues. I'll be having a few more of these down the road..."
"O- Age or not still my favorite DIPA out there i think Founders overtook hopslam on this one. Seem like this got better and hopslam fell off"
"O- This is one of the best value priced IIPA's out there, imo. It has great flavor and really hits the spot no matter what you are craving. Drink it cold on a hot day, or room temp on a cool day. I like this beer so much that I am continuing my quest in cloning it homebrew style."
"Overall - I guess my preference in IPAs and DIPAs pretty easy to see. I like em West Coast, hard and hoppy, bitter as you're old Aunt Edna or as crazy fruity/tropical as the strange fruitcake she used to make, but is now too bitter to bring you anymore. Chalk that up to personal preference. I would still encourage anyone who comes across this brew and likes IPAs/DIPAs of some fashion to give it a try. For me, just above average. Thanks to McNuts for this one! I really did want to try this brew and I did enjoy it. I always LOVE trying another IPA or DIPA even if it isn't my preferred type of IPA/DIPA."
"O: Really enjoyed this one. I've had some really overpowering IIPAs, but this one settled in just right. I'd buy a full sixer of it."
"O - This is a great IIPA/ DIPA! Founder's has made sure to stay true to style!"
"overall very drinkable and nice. this was definitely an ipa leaning imperial. hoppier than other imperials i have had and i liked it."
"Overall : I my opinion this beer is very well done. Its refreshing crisp and clean. This is exactly what im looking for when I drink this style. Can't say enough good things about this one."
"overall, it's a reasonable IIPA, but i'm not sure how this rates to an A-??? i think the fact that it's 'FOUNDERS!!!' might be leading to a bit of grade inflation. blind taste test with other B rated IIPA, i think it finishes middle-of-the-pack."
"O- a nice DIPA here, perhaps a little sweet but really smooth and well balanced."
"Overall-Awesome flavor, once again, not let down from Founders!"
"Overall-Excellent IIPA, glad I have more in the fridge and will probably drink another right now. Up there with Pliny, Ghandi Bot, Maharaja and others. West Coast style IPA with all the tropical fruits. Oh ya, and great artwork. Founders needs to come to Texas!"
"Overall, this beer is great. I've had it several times and I have found that if you let it sit for a while, the bitterness dies out a bit, but the fruitiness goes with it."
"O - Double Trouble is a respectable DIPA worth trying. I'd probably like this better with a lower ABV."
"O - Very nice, nice indeed."
"D: A delightful and drinkable DIPA. I'd buy it fresh again and order another."
"D- Double Trouble is a tasty concoction of tropical fruit and caramel malt blending into a creamy taste fest. I will be seeking this out next year as well"
"O - This is how I like my DIPAs, with the caramel malt clearly staying in the background while letting the hops to be showcased and finishing bitter, not sweet. Nearly three months in the bottle, and its fabulous. I'll have to buy this again when its much more fresh."
"O - Beautiful in all ways. Drinking this side-by-side with Port Mongo and FFF Arctic Panzer Wolf, I am amazed how exponentially better it is than the aforementioned, which are very very good in their own right."
"Overall: A decent DIPA with bracing bitterness and fruity hop aroma and flavor. A little bit less than I'd hoped for in the malt department, but it's clear that Founders was aiming for a cleaner, lighter DIPA rather than one with a malty whallop."
"This pours a hazy, pale orange and has decent head, retention and lacing. The smell is noticeably hoppy and specifically grapefruity. The taste is pretty powerful, but I really like how this beer is, very much so, on the bitter side of double IPAs. There is slight hint of malt and sweetness up front, but it is washed out by the delicious zest of hops. This is pretty heavy in the body, but who cares? Give me another!"
"I had this last night at MacNiven's in Indianapolis. The beer pours a very bright and clear gold in color with a minimal white head. It's very, very light in color for a DIPA. It smells of delicious grapefruit and has a light resinous hoppy aroma. God, this beer smells delicious! The flavor too is of fresh grapefruit and is wonderfully right in between sweet and bitter. The fruit is just downright superb. It drank light and very crisp. It has a nice bite and the alcohol is barely present at all. Overall this is a top notch beer and one of my favorites. I'm glad it doesn't disappoint out of the bottle OR on draft."
"Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a two finger bubbly white head that quickly dissipates to a ring on top. Smells of pine resin, apricots, grapefruit, this one is all hops. Looking for malt and I can't find it. Hop juice. Taste is bitter resinous with apricots, grapefruit, hints of tropical fruit and a faint pale malt somewhere underneath all of this. Long lingering mild hop bitterness after every sip. Hop sap sticky resinous mouthfeel, medium level of bubbles and body. Great Dipa here. Could use a little bit of sweetness to counteract the blasts of hop on my palette, but great nonetheless."
"Over- Excellent DIPA, one of my favs."
"Light gold with an off-white head, citrusy on the smell, citrus hops and sweet residues on the taste. Grapefruit! Pineapple! Dry, slightly bitter finish! Are there malts here? I liked it but I didn't love it, and this is a tough category, you know? It's a wonderful beer if you like your citrus hops but ultimately there's not enough complexity--I can't really put down more than one at a time."
"O-Overall a decent DIPA. You can certainly feel the alcohol so this is something you need to take your time with and savor."
"Very smooth mouthfeel goes down real easy, so I think it's probably a good session beer for an IPA."
"Overall: A great beer. Up in the same league as Hopslam, Abrasive, and Maharaja. An outstanding DIPA."
"Overall: A good, refreshing DIPA that is suited for the summer. Maybe a little too easy to drink considering it has 9.4% ABV. Recommended"
"Overall, a great summery IPA."
"Overall a really mice beer and definitely one that I'd purchase again. Long live a quality and relatively affordable 2X IPA."
"It was well balanced, medium bodied, and full of flavor. Felt good in the mouth. I will definitely look for more of this. Outstanding."
"Overall - This is really a great DIPA. Wow - the malt sweetness becomes more pronounced as it warms. I wish you could see my glass right now, I've got about 10 well defined lace rings on my glass, some of the best lacing I've ever seen. This perfect blend of pineapple malty sweetness followed by a very sharp, but pleasant resinous hops, followed by a wonderful alcohol warmth and satisfied smile means that I'll be purchasing lots of Double Trouble in the future. (per the Founders website, this is seasonal, and available Jan thru May - would love to know what an aged one tastes like!) I really like DIPA's, and this is a Very Fine example - highly recommend!"
"Overall it's one of my favorite DIPA's and even though my case was 2-3 months old, it drank nice and hoppy all the way to the last one. I would totally get it again next year fresh. Solid offering From Founders."
"Overall I really enjoyed this DIPA from Founders. Thanks to xanok for the extra. Highly recommended!!"
"Plus it has one sweet label."
"Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum...Super DIPA...it was perfect. And the BBQ meal I had to go along with it (at Holy Smoke in Mahopac, NY), made it that much better. Color, nose, pour, palate, finish. This beer had it all. Find it. Buy it. Drink it...and then look the menu, and order it again."
"Overall it's on the milder side as far as imperial IPAs go. Not quite the hop kick-in-the-mouth most of them end up being. I would drink it again but won't list it among my favorite IPAs."
"O: For 9.4% ABV this is dangerously delicious and drinkable, I would be buying this all the time if it were available in my neck of the woods. Great hop presence, great balance, simply great all around IIPA."
"Mouthfeel- Awesome, very creamy, low carbonation, minimal dryness. Excellent."
"Overall: Very tastey DIPA. Wonderful aroma/taste and well hidden ABV."
"This is an amazing beer to say the least. I tried it at freshcraft in Denver. The bar tender and I began discussing beers when a bottle was brought out from the back. The bar tender got it from a friend whom brought it out from the midwest...it's not sold in the west yet. As to the appearance it was hard to judge but taste and smell wise this thing was hoppy like a m-f****er as Samuel Jackson would say. Sometimes with double ipa's you loose a lot of hoppiness and gain more malt. Not with this double ipa...from the moment the aroma hit my nose I knew this was going to be an exceptional beer and needless to say it is one of the best ipa's I've had"
"Would like to taste one down the line to see what age does to it..."
"I was expecting this to be a real mouth-puckerer, but it is actually quite smooth and refreshing. Even though it has some serious hop bitterness, it's not overwhelming. To my taste, this is about as hopped up as a beer should be before the quality is compromised. I wouldn't care to drink this every day, but once in a while it's a nice treat."
"Very light golden color with whispy white foam. Not much lacing or bubble formation, very light look to it. Aromas are nice, big piney hop and light grain. Flavor is intense. Huge bitterness and a bit of citrus fruits. The hops on this one rip away at the taste buds, very cool. The mouthfeel in interesting, very bitter with a slightly prickly carbonation, but still drinkable. Overall, a very solid DIPA, a staple in my Spring drinking."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This definitely lived up to the hype. One of the best Double IPAs I have ever tried."
"O: Great beer that I will probably revisit in the future when I can't get hopslam."
"For me, has an overpowering honey taste and texture to it. The honey does seem to mellow out the bitterness of the hops. At 86 IBU, I wouldn't have believed it unless it said so on the bottle. I enjoyed this 4 pack, but don't think I would buy again for a IIPA."
"overall - great example of style. big beer."
"I've had this on tap a couple times. Tasty, strong, and a bit citrusy. Pours slightly hazy orange-gold with a nice white head that recedes a bit. Pine and grapefruity citrus in the nose. Pine and grass in the taste, with citrus and bitter hops following shortly after, and a mild malt backdrop. Mostly dry finish, with a twinge of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel, and an overall pleasantly drinkable IPA."
"Mouthfeel is considerably silky, more towards medium-bodied, but very clean and crisp all the way though. A notable feat when drinking this beer. A two-thumbs-up IPA for sure. One of my new favorites."
"Overall, this is a pretty decent DIPA, but with so many breweries pumping out DIPAs these days, Founders isn't quite cutting it with Double Trouble. Not a bad beer, but there are many other better DIPAs out there. However, the hop profile is unique enough that this might be a favorite for a few people."
"This was an excellent beer, the flavors were very noticeable, almost something different with every sip. This was also incredibly easy to drink, a bit dangerous with the higher abv."
"Drinking Notes: As I was typing this review up news broke that Osama Bin Laden was finally killed by US Troops in Pakistan; that news made this world class beer taste even better. I salute all our military and intelligence personnel and raise my glass to those killed in battle protecting us, and of course those murdered 10 years ago on 9/11."
"O – A classic hop-bomb, but still drinkable and not overly bitter."
"Not bad, but not up to my Founders standards. Probably will try a bottle of the new batch when it comes out next, but I doubt I'll be excited about it."
"O - its a good beer not my particular favorite by them but a pretty good DIPA."
"O: This is a wonderful example of the IPA/DIPA style, and Founders really shows mature taste and discretion in brewing it in their own way. Instead of just showcasing a super hoppy creation, they throw down the gauntlet for Pale Ale FLAVOR. Genuine and memorable - this beer is damn good."
"O-Would prefer a more assertice hop profile. Pretty good."
"Founder's does beer well and this is a great example."
"O - a very nice IIPA, but this is the kind of quality I've come to expect from Founders. As always, a solid A beer."
"O: Solid brew by a world renowned brewery. Only real complaint would be the light chalk in the taste, it makes it not as refreshing as other DIPA."
"Over all this is a darn good double IPA (I like it much more on tap), but to compare this to hopslam seems absurd. This beer doesn’t have any right to be put in the same class as far as this beer drinker’s mind is concerned."
"A pretty bold Double IPA that is remarkably balanced. Definitely worth a purchase; warrants further exploration of Founders' other offerings."
"Well done founders. Well done indeed!"
"Overall: Great aroma, great taste, a little thin on the mouthfeel, great ABV. This is a great beer, even if it is on the thin side."
"PS - this is my first review since BeerAdvocate appears to have changed which attributes are part of the review process, so take things with a grain of salt (as you should probably be doing with reviews anyways)"
"Hearkening back to the old """Drinkability""" rating criteria, this beer was gone woefully too soon, and despite its ABV I could easily (and very happily) kill a 4-pack of this in one night."
"Overall, a solid DIPA, but I have had better."
"Flavour is very hoppy grapefruit and floral with a nice balancing caramel malt sweetness and a bracing bitter finish."
"This beer surprised me. From the appearance I thought this would be different. Superb DIPA. Good bitter hops here. I was gonna review another beer, but I think my palate is destroyed."
"D: This is a very palatable ale, true to its American IPA roots. If you're a hop head, this one is for you."
"This is the type of beer that would get me in trouble, maybe where they got the name. They claim 9.4% but this is so light and easy to consume I just can't wrap my head around it. A few of these, they are so good I could, would start to work. Overall, I had no expectations coming in and am blown away. I put this at the top with Stone Lucky Bastard as my favs."
"O: Overall this is an excellent IPA. Definitely in my top 5. I just wish I could get this fresh in Florida!"
"Pours a clear orange color with a small white head. A wonderful aroma; rich, super sweet hops, sweet almost honey-like notes. A great flavor as well; smooth but piney bitter hops, sweet and a light citrus too, light bitter pine and light alcohol. Very nice. Too drinkable. This is dangerous."
"Lordy, there is a ton of hops here, bordering on being too much at times. There's just enough balancing flavors to keep this from being a steam roller, and it actually turns out to be a great DIPA."
"The mouthfeel is solid, it's medium-bodied and highly carbonated. The drinkability is also rather good, this is a pretty easy drinker. A good DIPA. Nothing amazing, but it's solid and drinkable."
"After the powerful floral aroma this beer brings the hop bitterness and doesn't let up. There was small moments of citrus hop flavor peeking through the bitterness and I would have liked the chance to experience them a little bit more. Overall all though this beer brings what the style promises - assertive hop bitterness and a smooth clean aftertaste. Surprisingly drinkable for such a strong beer and it never gets boring - but still would like to see a bit more complex flavor come through the bitterness."
"All in all a good beer. Could have some hop flavor."
"Overall this was one damn good DIPA. There was a lot of claims that this could go head to head with Hopslam, and after trying it I fully agree and would love to try the two side by side. Everything was on par for its style, a really well done DIPA that had great drinkablity, this one could sneak up on you if you aren't carefull . Even though it is 9.40% it never feels hot, just a little warming as it goes down, as it should be. I can't say enough good things about this beer, one of the best DIPA's I have had, its right up there with Hopslam. It is nice to know that if I miss out on hopslam next year I can still get my fix with this great brew. I am glad I bought this and will buy some more next time it is released. If you love the style or consider yourself a hop head you need to try this beer, it will cure what ails ya. Founders puts a 100% into all their brews and it really shows with this brew, and thats what makes them one of my favorite brewery's."
"Overall/notes - Really tasty IIPA! Lacks h punch it really needs to be one of the top examples, but worth revisiting for sure. Drank this one over a long period of time, and it really improved as it warmed. All of the flavors became stronger. I'll have to get another pack of this sometime soon."
"Overall- An Amazing double IPA, founders really hit the nail on the head with this one. Bitter hop flavours, paired with a sweet grapefruit flavour that is smooth, crisp, and very easy drinking for such a high ABV. Can’t wait till my next trip to Michigan, will definitely be picking this one up again!"
"O/D-Better than I expected. Absolutely love this one, wish I could have it fresh all the time. One of my favorite Doubles I have had. Oh so drinkable despite the high ABV. The hops are showcased masterfully here. Needs to be fresh to be fully appreciated. Great beer, no wonder why its talked about so much. Once again, Founders goes for the win."
"It appears that Founders went with the palate stomping approach to this DIPA. I prefer much more balance but the flavors are good and it is a well made beer."
"D. Okay beer but there are much better Imperial IPA's out there that give more satisfaction."
"O- Over priced, over rated. Need to do my homework a bit better. 20 bucks for a 4 pack of this swill?! Does pack a punch."
"Overall this is lighter in color than most, tons of lingering lacing, profound grapefruit and bitterness, and overall a big beer."
"O: Awesome IPA. Very drinkable. Alcohol isn't noticeable at all, I wouldn't have known it was 9.4% if the bottle didn't say so. I would drink this untl I fell off my chair, which wouldn't take that long."
"Founders really does some nice work and this a fine example"
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium with almost a full finish. I am use to West Coast DIPA's, to me there is not enough umph in the hop department. I feel that it is just above an IPA but not a double. Good beer and a good malty backbone overall."
"Skal!"
"A solid DIPA if you find it fresh (and don't mind some harsh booze), but nowhere near the class of this style."
"A medium body with good carbonation, this beer coats and sticks the way a DIPA should, but it is also very drinkable and refreshing."
"DRINKABILITY: Loved this beer -- a real competitor to HopSlam. It might even displace it as my favorite Imperial IPA. Because of the high alcohol content, I wouldn't want to stick to this as my beer for an all-night poker session, but one or two sipped with friends would be appropriate. The cost is reasonable and I'll definitely be having many more."
"Big strong white head to start things off. Not especially wowing on the eyes, very typical golden tone to this beer. However, there are some very nice scents going on here. Strong grapefruit and fresh floral smells. The mouthfeel is just about perfect for a double IPA in my opinion. It's got that punch expected from the style, however theres a certain smoothness that really bring it together nicley. The hop profile includes mostly earthy/grassy notes with a little smudge of grapefruit and an orange-y citrus kick. Very nice, complex flavors in this glass. It's a beautiful thing."
"D- 4 For a strong IPA like this I feel the drinkability is decently high. It is a drink that could catch up to you weren't careful (9.4% ABV); all in all it is pretty crisp and easy to take down. Just a bit bitter and dry for me to want all night, but very good nonetheless."
"Drinkability - Wow!!!! An incredible brew. Without a doubt one of the best beers I've ever had. I want another. I could definitely make a night of this. Very easy to drink. Would be great at anytime of the year. Crisp and snappy for Spring/Summer and a nice warming appeal for Fall/Winter. Outstanding. The high ABV is only a small setback because I wouldn't be able to gulp this all night."
"O- it was delightful drink. Founders make the best and this was not shy off there mark."
"Overall, it's a beer I think I enjoy, but it does seem a bit overwhelming to my mouth. One in an evening will be fine, but I won't mind drinking it for several evenings."
"Overall: This is a very good Double IPA. The smell is slightly better than the taste. The bitterness wears your tongue out, and it's hard to tell what else is going on. I know it's a double IPA, so it should be really bitter, but I'm just nitpicking."
"O: A tasty ale. This beer is entirely focused on hops, with little attention given to the malt or other flavors. Despite the bitterness, it is also surprisingly drinkable."
"Overall a great melding of the coasts. Sweet like the east and puckering like the west. Balance flavors really show a good well made ipa. Hops are the stars and do not share any room with malts or any other inferior flavors. Great beer"
"o: solid brew, extremely drinkable. I could sit and pound these out as they are very light, have a wonderful texture and a solid bold taste profile. I do wish the bitterness settled more in the middle to make way for the sweetness...only joining back in for the dry finish. The lingering bitterness is still well balanced, though may be a distraction for some."
"Part of my experience might have been that this was bottled on 12/8/10 so my drinking experience definitely different than getting this fresh but still enjoyable."
"O/D - Yes. Exceptionally drinkable, I'd say. Good beer to drink before Trailer Park Boys."
"A super solid DIPA, I will definitely have this again. Find it fresh and you won't have any regrets."
"O) Double Trouble made watching my favorite MLB team getting the snot kicked out of them a little more tolerable. Thank you Founders. I would gladly recommend this brew!"
"Notes: Founders is based out of Grand Rapids, and I've tried many of their other styles, all of which are pretty solid. It would be nice to know what varieties of hops they used for this. If you happen to know, leave a comment."
"Mouthfeel is slick, a touch oily. Carbonation is good. In the pantheon of big IIPA's, Double Trouble is a rung belong the top tier in my opinion, but still a great beer."
"From Bottle (dated beginning of March '11) to Snifter. Poured a very nice, translucent honey/yellow color with a 2 fingers of head which quickly vanished. On the smell I definitely picked up some tropical fruit -- mangoes, pineapple, banana peel. The taste held more citrus flavors than the nose, mostly grapefruit. Overall, not bad, but didn't blow me away. I guess I prefer some of the maltier DIPAs (ie 90 minute)."
"double jack.. bottom of the 4 but interesting (give it a try)..."
"O: Awesome. It's a great choice for hopheads used to west coast ales but are looking to try a slightly different flavor profile."
"O: Great double IPA, top 5 for me at the very least, and I've finally been able to try it on tap to confirm that. The balance from the malts is the key to making this beer as good as it is."
"Overall if you like ipas you will def love this delicious hop dream pa"
"Absolutely delicious, and a benchmark Imperial IPA to me."
"Overall, I was very surprised in a great way. I am a fan of Founders, but not particularly of Centennial. My expectations were not great but I had to try this because it was Founders. Back to the store tonight buying 12 more!"
"Pours a very clear golden orange color with a thick white head and tons of pretty lacing. Smells of orange and tons and tons of piny and grassy hops. Tastes like Jesus, of citrus and an unrelenting blast of palate numbing hops. Just awesome. Mouthfeel is medium with a heavy carbonation. Overall, its just an awesome beer, by far the best I have tried from Founders."
"Some DIPA's are very malty and some are basically hop juice. This is in the middle of that, leaning towards hoppy. I think this stays away from being so ridiculously hoppy that it detracts. That said, it's one of the more bitter ones I've had. Definitely need to be in the mood for a beer like this."
"O: i have been known to drink may of these and have to call a cab to get home. be sure you do the same!"
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Double Trouble brings a hop hammer down on the palate, a very good DIPA."
"I'm a fan of this beer. As I said above, it's quite floral and sweet for a DIPA, without the strong bitterness of, say, Hopslam."
"The force is strong in this one. Aggressive Double IPA full of flavor. The hops prevails throughout but the piney earth note hit the tongue first and really standout. Smooth cream full body flavor with light bread, orange, lemon, pine mingle with the hops very nicely"
"O-> Exceptionally balanced and enjoyable. Right up there with the best double IPAs (that I have tasted anyway) and just a fantastic brew."
"Not my top pick for the style, but definitely in the same league. Fantastic stuff, worth the road trip to obtain."
"O: Great aroma and solid hops throughout the beer. It's a kick in the mouth; fantastic DIPA for those that like them."
"Mouthfeel is right where you'd expect it to be. Overall a this is a much better than average DIPA and one I look forward to each year."
"D: Founders has managed to bottle hop juice. A big...big....beer"
"Drinkability must, of course, be affected by the pretty immense ABV. Other than that, yes, I'd like another. And another."
"I like my DIPA's more balanced, with some decent malt balance, of which this has none. My high expectations, based on other Founders beers, wasn't met."
"I like it a lot, but I don't think that I'd want more than one at a time. Still, very, very tasty."
"Overall - A great DIPA, I felt that the bitterness detracted just a bit from making it truly outstanding, as it felt like there was a little bit off in the balance. But a very, very good DIPA"
"Overall another great beer from a great brewery."
"A wonderful mouthfeel and an overall pleasurable experience. This is like a Hopslam, but different. Kinda like a Surly - Abrasive, but different. It's a thing unto itself and as it's name suggests, I enjoy only one as I melt into the warm bathwater, then cut myself off; I figure two can only lead to trouble."
"O - A bit one dimensional but I still dig it and would drink it again for sure."
"D - Good, but a little too much hops. Not enough balance. A little too piney for my preferences."
"Overall, definitely a good beer. Very nice flavour, but not terribly complex. If you like hops, you will like this beer. If not, you will not."
"Overall, this beer was better than I was expecting flavor wise. It is not quite as good as Hoplsam, but it is delicious. I recommend it for any fan of the style."
"Pours a cloudy bright citrus golden with pure white foamy half inch head. Lacing hangs on down the tulip glass. Strong nose was picked up before the cap was fully off; so much hops in the auroma! All citrus and grapefruit. First sip reveals this to be a very hop-forward and dominate DIPA. Still mostly citrus hop taste, the faintest malt touch, and bitter/dry into the finish. Great mouthfeel, medium to heavy on the palate, still well carbonated. Almost no alcohol presence all the way down, amazing for a 9.4% beer. Overall, this is one of my all time favourite beers I've ever gotten to try! Great example of the American hop-bomb Imperial IPA. Wow, I really hope Founder's future expansion plans bring them permanently into Ontario. They are quickly becoming a favourite brewery."
"Both smell and taste contain an overabundance of hops. With the smell you get the strong scent of piney hoppiness and with taste you get a punch of hoppiness with a slight sense of sweetness that passes quickly and leaves the robust flavor of bitter hops in your mouth. And that flavor sticks for a while. The feeling it leaves is of a crisp, powerful IPA: A big bite with a hoppy aftertaste. Personally this is a strong IPA for me. I like an IPA with a little more balance to it, this beer seems to give too much hops. If you love hops and just hops in your beer than this beer is a winner. As for me I did enjoy it but just a hint too much bitter with only a little malt or sweetness to balance it out."
"Overall (Drinkability): I'm torn with this beer. It's three months old, and while age certainly accounts for the hops fading I'm having a tough time rationalizing this much fade. What flavor I can pick up is good, so I really want to try this brew when it's fresh. So, with that said...Founder's has not yet disappointed me with any of their brews, so I will absolutely seek this one out again to get me some fresh hoppy goodness. I will, of course, update my review to reflect a fresher brew."
"Overall a great IPA warms you all over."
"O - I think this is a very good example of an American IIPA. It is not complex, but clean, lots of hops, good attenuation, and very drinkable for such a strong beer."
"D- One on the nicest American IPA's i have had. Lovely fresh sweet fruits balanced with the hop bite makes it very refreshing. Abv doesnt give it sessionability but i certainly enjoyed the one bottle! Reminds me of Kelburn Carte Blanche with a revved up Abv and hop content."
"Everything about this beer has an in-your-face style. Nice color with a decent head. The smell is all about grapefruit. If you want to teach someone how beer can smell like something other than """beer""" then this is one great example. The taste borders on too bitter with the grapefruit/grapefruit pith being the strongest flavor. I dont think it would be too much for IPA lovers but those who dont care for the style will probably not enjoy this selection."
"D-Goes down a little bit too easily, but it gives you enough warning of how strong it is that 1 at a time is probably enough for me."
"Wonderful brew with plenty of reason to return for more. This is what an imperial IPA should be. This conceals the alcohol well and has plenty of flavor,"
"O: I've got to ding this one a bit for its in-your-face booziness. However, I will try this one again next season... as I do every year."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - You can definitely tell that this is a double IPA thanks to the hop profile. Extraordinarily hopped, tangy and bitter. Good to sip."
"M/D: Mediu, bodied with decent carbonation, a small amount of heat from the alcohol, intensifying as it warms. Overall, really nice. Would love to drink head to head with some other top DIPAs."
"D: oh boy, i could see how i could get in trouble drinking these all night. strong enough to do damage. delicious enough to enjoy the damage."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color, with a small head. The smell is a bit weak, but has a nice grapefruit smell to it. The taste is VERY bitter, very intense, a strong grapefruit like flavor, typical of an IPA, but VERY strong. Could use a little more carbonation, and not to hard to drink. Overall Very enjoyable, a top beer."
"D: Pretty good. I normally enjoy HopSlam more than Double Trouble, but in a stunning upset, the excellence rankings have reversed this year. Wish I hadn't missed out on this when it was coming out in large quantities. I need more."
"the CPJ"
"D: No alcohol is noticed despite the listed 9.4%. The flavors and body are more akin to a 7.5% brew."
"Update 04/01/2011 - No April fools: this is the best all around beer I've ever had. I'm on my second case and I hope to find another before they're gone for the year."
"Discovering IPA's / DIPA's lately and was sad to see Hopslam leave. This could be a good fill-in during the off season. My first Founder's but definitely not my last."
"This DIPA pours a hazy, light orange-yellow tint. An array of bubbles in various sizes make up a thin, off-white head that spreads thin across the top, leaving sticky lace as the session progresses. The nose takes on a fresh lavender character that fades quickly into juicy mango, then sweet, citrusy tangerine. Sour patch lemony hops bitterness fights forward in the palette. Clean malt snaps its way in the middle and a slight spice makes a peek towards the finish. Lingering bitterness ensures you won't forget what style slowly depletes from your glass. Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. This flavor-packed, fruity hopped IPA is loaded with bitterness and an excellent treat for hopheads and big IPA lovers."
"Founders Double Trouble fresh is just fantastic. It's hard to imagine a better DIPA. I've had Younger within the past week and I would say that this is almost as good. The beer was a fuzzy, bright, yellowish amber with a good head. It smelled like rubbing your face into freshly picked hops. It tasted like juicy pineapples and oranges with a solid crackery malt backbone and good clean hop bitterness. Just delicious, I might have finished my 12 tulip in 5 swallows. I wish I could have drunk it slower to savor it more, but it was just that good."
"Notes - A truly great beer for me. Its not the hoppiest Ive had but the combination of citrus, hops and pine are favorites of mine. I like double IPAs and this is one of the best Ive had."
"D- Not very hard to drink but overall I feel this is a very average IIPA. Yes, it is hop and bitter and that is good, but that seems to be the only thing going on here. I would try it again, but I would not go out of my way to try it."
"Decent DIPA, one worth checking out. Many people enjoy this beer but I have a couple issues with it. The hop flavor does not come off clean and that really effects the beer all the way through. The way the flavor just digs into and lays on the tongue really hurts the beer. One in my limit, after that I need to move to something a bit cleaner."
"Overall, a decent DIPA and a solid effort from Founders. This isn't the greatest DIPA by any means, but it is still quite good. This is only the fourth beer I've had by Founders and I'm already finding them to be one of my favorite breweries and it is starting to seem like they can pull anything off that they set their minds to. This one is certainly worth a try. Cheers!"
"D- I could have a couple of these. One night I will."
"Overall: Wish this beer was distributed out west...it would definitely be one of my go-to choices. Guess I'll just have to keep my bro Ohio Hop Devil happy so he'll send me some next year!"
"I'm sad to give this a low score after hearing so many good things about it. Poured from a keg tapped just 4 days prior, it looked very promising with it's staying head, and deep body. The nose brought a strong hop smell but a predominant smell of body odor. The taste is the same with some sweet malt flavors and hop bitterness and pine resinous feelings/flavors. I say this from a very objective standpoint as I was looking forward to trying this beer for the first time, but I must say, a disappointment."
"Overall: This didn't win over our non-ipa testers, everyone finished their glass but didn't want to kill our test bottle."
"Pours a slightly cloudy gold, huge aromatic head, lots of lacing. Smells of dry sweetened grapefruit, peaches and pine. Tastes is well-balanced blend of floral notes, citrus notes and piney resin. Grapefruit on the end and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pretty dry, not resiny or sticky. This is way too drinkable at 9%. Dangerous. This is a well brewed DIPA."
"Taste is loaded with a front-end of citrus, back-end of pine, mango and sweet hop resins. ABV is hidden extremely well. Tropical fruit sweetness stays on palate for about 15 seconds, and ends with sweet malts. This ought to be a staple in my fridge."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is ok. A little too much grapefruit and the booziness makes this less enjoyable than it should be, although it got better as it warmed up. I'm starting to think I got a bad bottle, as the flavors and smells just didn't pop, carbonation was low, and there was very little head. Will pick up another in a few weeks and try again."
"This is probably one of my favorite beers at the moment. It's seasonal, you can only get it Jan - April so when you see it, grab it! Truly excellent stuff, a GREAT beer!"
"This pours a straw yellow/orange with a two finger head that has some staying power and leaves some lacing around. On the nose it's a hop attack of citrus with some wet straw, orange, and especially grapefruit all there in a really pungent head. In the mouth there is a buzzsaw of hop bitterness, a very citrusy IPA, mostly grapefruit. The medium body keeps the bitterness hanging around for a long finish with maybe just a touch of alcohol, which is pleasing. Overall this is another great beer from Founders, the perfect compliment to Breakfast Stout."
"D-just a great drink overall bursting with hops and flavor."
"Really nice DIPA - not quite up there with Hopslam, but few are. Glad I got to try a few fresh bottles of this Founders offering, look forward to trying again next year."
"Drinkability is flat out fantastic, a real great beer just got better this way."
"The mouthfeel is rather thick and viscous with just the right amount of stickiness. Carbonation is just a bit on the heavy side, but it work swell. This is definitely a potent DIPA, but it's good and unique, which will make it memorable and I'd try it again if the opportunity presented itself."
"D-Im sure i might review his again in the future. as i was told this was alot like or even better than hopslam(which i love) but i was dissapointed with how bitter this one was. ONly able to drink about half the glass.. It looks and smeels wonderfull. Will give this beer a try next yr. but for right now it wasn't for me!"
"Drinkability: very high for 9.4%"
"Cheers...GREAT BEER!!"
"I certainly can't find much negative about this blend. I suppose the appearance is its weak point and I prefer a slightly more bitter flavor in an Imperial. Overall, an excellent brew."
"Poured a deep, and very bright orange. Lots of haze almost obscured the light but left enough to give it a wonderful hue. Some visible carbonation inside. Big white frothy head, faded and left a large amount of lace on the top that stayed till the bottom. Glass was lined with lots of gooey lace that dripped down the glass, very nice looking. Smell was very strong, lots of fresh hops, pine resin the biggest factor here with hints of alcohol, which at nearly 10%abv is not a surprise. The flavor was un real, and very strong. Big alcohol and pine resin hit me first. Huge DIPA flavor and right up my alley. After it warmed some more subtle citrus tones started to come through. Some pineapple and grapefruit flavors fought with the unrelenting pine resin taste. Awesome strong bitter finish,Great full and crisp mouth feel, and very dry at the end. Have to be careful with the ABV which can sneak up on you."
"This Beer poured a slight hazy honey color with a nice head and good lacing. Excellent, clean hop and faint sweet malt aroma, piney, grapefruit and lemon. Among the flavors are pine, lemon, sweet malt, with a beautiful hop profile..you will wonder where the 9.4 apv is hidden...a very well-balanced DIPA"
"D - I like this beer more than expected and at 2 months old it has held up quite nicely."
"D- this beer is very powerful and has a lot of flavor. I've run into better DIPAs in flavor, but it's still pretty solid. 12 bucks for a 4-pack of a DIPA is also something you really can't pass up either"
"D--Pretty spot on for the style."
"On tap at The Big Hunt in Washington, DC. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy yellow golden color with a thick white head and a ton of lacing on the glass. Aroma is very strong pine and grapefruit. The taste starts off malty, then immediately followed by a burst of intense, but nice bitter hops with a strong pine flavor to it. A malty and citrusy sweetness lingers throughout the session. The ABV is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Decent carbonation. I really enjoyed this DIPA especially on tap."
"D-- West Coast meet Midwest. Or something like that. To me more of a very good take on a West Coast DIPA but with twists. Not grainy or earthy like other Midwest DIPA's that I have had. Very fresh and crisp. More like Sculpin with the tropical notes but bigger. Well hidden ABV and can or want to drink two in a sitting."
"Pours a really nice straw yellow with a hint of orange. One inch bright white head. Good lacing and head retention. Aroma is awesome. Mango, Pineapple and Floral Hops create an awesome tropical scent. Taste starts off with those big juicy tropical fruit notes, backed by a medium sized honey/caramel malt. A good amount of bitterness from the pine hops and alcohol heat linger at the finish and into the aftertaste."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours hazy golden with white head. Aroma is huge grapefruit, mango and tropical fruits. Love it! Taste is sweet with big bright hops adding a pleasant layer of bitterness. Lighter bodied with slick texture and bitter finish. This is one great DIPA."
"M&D- This is dangerously drinkable for a ABV of 9.4%. I don't seem to notice the alcohol at all. Incredible. I wish this was available all the time and it would become my fav brew."
"D- Easy to drink. Deceptively hidden ABV, as well as a low amount of bitterness could have you thinking that this is a normal IPA. Goes down like nothing. A good effort, and a solid brew."
"This is a very tasty and drinkable double IPA from a brewery that has never given me a reason not to list them in my top five. This beer never made it up to my home town this year so I am pleased that I got to enjoy some at the pub before it was all gone. While I don't think this is similar enough to HopSlam for me to make a comparison, it does deserve the honor of being put in that position by so many beer lovers."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with one finger of off-white head that sticks and clings to whatever it touches. Complex aromas that are hop-forward (floral, resinous, citrusy) but packed with sweet malty notes of honey. The taste is nothing short of amazing. The hops are aggressive but extremely well-balanced. Bathes all my senses in a floral and citrusy mist. Stunning stuff."
"D - Very easy to drink. Its pretty refreshing and goes well with chicken wings and other meat products. Although the appearance lacks, the smell and taste are pretty good. Not my favorite DIPA, but it is pretty tasty."
"Definitely a top-notch DIPA. It's not the best I've ever had but I'd certainly drink it anytime. It's an excellent beer and recommended to all fans of the style."
"Great drinkability on this beer. Probably one of the best for this style. The sweetness and bitterness coexist in a perfect harmony."
"A lot of comparisons are being made between this beer and Hopslam. While they are similar, I found Hopslam to be slightly more balanced. A very good beer from Founders, but not the best DIPA I've had."
"A really smooth IPA. Velvety, smooth, bitter and awesome. Lots of citrus up front and piney bitter in the backend. Really a great beer that has it's hops really balanced, and the silky smooth malt mouthfeel balances wonderfully with bitterness of the hops. Great beer."
"Drinkability and overall: Great DIPA. I've read alot of comparisons to Hopslam, but I don't think they are close. No honey in this, less citric, and less astringent. Great double IPA, always a treat when it's in season."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. This beer is pretty similar to Hopslam in my opinion, although a bit more balanced and bland. I'd like to have this on tap to guarantee freshness, as I believe this may be a bit dated."
"This is a great IIPA, another wonder from Founders."
"D: This beer evolved for me and got better with each sip leaving me wanting more by the time I finished the glass. The ABV is felt but not tasted."
"D: Due to the boozyness of this beer, I can't drink more than a few ounces."
"Drinkability: A four pack of this (which is how I bought it) is perfect for a session. Six might be too many, three would leave you wanting more. Just right. I will definitely look for this one again when I'm in the mood for a hoppy Double IPA...which is right now, so I'm going to have another."
"Very pleasant surprise. Would definitely seek out more. A very welcome deviation from current DIPA's. They stayed away from darker malts and the usual cloying sweetness. In the current debates where barleywines and DIPAs are almost interchangeable, this one is not confused about what it is."
"The smell of this beer is amazing and lets you know exactly what you are getting into. Nice hop profile with smooth clean citrus finish. Drinkablity is outstanding if you can get your hands on some of this fresh it is one of the best IMO. Comes in a 4 pack for around $10 well worth the price."
"D - big and flavorful, this is great and easy to drink, but you kind of want to savor it more."
"i would drink this again..curious as to its on tap taste..."
"Drinkability: I started this out with a grin but in the end the bitterness became a little overwhelming. If your looking for a hop bomb based on a pine feel look no further."
"Drinkability- This beer is very dangerous! I would never have put this beer at 9.4. I have had some beers half as strong that do not go down as easily. Very drinkable, everytime I have one, I already want another. This may be the most underrated beer out there right now!"
"D - The bigness of this beer does not take away from its drinkability... Although 2 of these in one sitting would be enough, I could def drink them in a row."
"This is a very good DIPA--it's not sweet and cloying or enamel-destroying bitter. Probably the most drinkable 9% ABV-plus beer I've had."
"O - A unique and flavorful experience. The hop profile is different than other DIPA's. A nice change from the norm indeed. It's a pleasure to drink and worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel is light yet oddly creamy and thick at times. Grapefruit rind/herbal dry finish helps drinkability out a great deal. Really soothing and nice beer."
"Drinkability - Not to impressed with the double trouble, for the price I was expecting a better balanced and blended beer, It wasn't awefull just not a world class beer in my opinion."
"D - well, fantastic. It's a DIPA. All of them go down like water, but it's not the best. I still think Founders is the best brewery in the USA, just not the best makers of IPA's."
"This is a solid DIPA, but certainly not my favorite. The aroma is pretty fantastic, but the flavor is lacks the complexity and subtlety of the aroma. Light hop flavor up front followed by a bitter smack down for your tongue. Still pretty drinkable, and still pretty good."
"D: This is a great beer. It smells great, it tastes great, and it's quite drinkable. One of my favs. I'm docking it just a *touch* on drinkability because of the high alcohol content and presence in the flavor. Hop heads, especially those who like those bitey-west-coast style IPAs, will enjoy this one."
"D: 9.4% ABV is nothing to sneeze at, but the alcohol is well integrated and it's too delicious to keep the beer out of my hands. Sculpin so far is my favorite IPA, with Double Trouble I think I've found my favorite DIPA."
"Poured into a snifter, with a slightly cloudy deep golden color. Formed a thin, white head that disapated into slight ring around the edge. Smell was a somewhat muted piney/ grapefruit with a scent of apricot. Taste was great - a creamy mouthfeel of hoppy bitterness and slight grapefruit taste. Also a trace of sweeteness, just enough to round out the experience. Overall a very smooth tasting experience. Another top notch brew from Founders. This would be ranked as one of my favorites. Thanks to McNuts for the extra!"
"Overall, a pretty good and very unique DIPA. Where most DIPAs are either very citrus or pine forward, this beer has a very grassy, spicy, and herbal flavor to it."
"D: For the ABV, this is absolutely amazing. Very nicely done. Founders is an amazing brewery and I would expect nothing less. I could put down the four pack and think nothing of it."
"While I tend to stay pent up during the winter months, the release of double trouble allowed me to see the beauty of this time of year. More double IPA or IIPA's tend to come out this time of year, and it makes me love winter. Double trouble is one example of how great winter IPA's can be. Mango, orange, pineapple, and pine dominate this beer's profile and I love it. A nice golden color, and perfect clarity (I assume due to filtering) keep this beer visually appealing. A great beer, it gonna keep me coming back."
"Drink- Very good. A great example of a DIPA."
"This is normally the first beer that I order when I visit their taproom."
"M/D) Medium body. A bit resiny and leaves the mouth feeling very dry after each sip begging for the next. Definitely a sipper. Not a sessionable beer."
"D: This is my fourth time having this beer and I have just had it back to back with a Bell's Hopslam. Honestly, it is more of a sipper and the bitterness is way more upfront. Also, the alcohol and just general size of the beer is a lot more apparent than in the Hopslam, which felt like it was almost half the size in abv as this beer. None the less, this beer was really enjoyable."
"D- Very easy to drink, I loved this beer. I had one while I cooked some dinner the other night and I had to have another right after because it was just so good! Great job Founders!"
"Amazing dipa, Founders has yet to steer me wrong"
"D: Wonderful for 9+%. Alcohol was really hidden nicely which makes this DIPA dangerous. Could have burned through a 4-pack if I wasn't careful."
"D: This drinkability is outstanding, the 9.4 is fairly well hidden overall."
"This is one of my favorite DIPA I have had the pleasure to enjoy. The great thing is, I don't have to go out of my way to get it like I do with Hopslam."
"Nothing really new here, and there are some examples of the style that are at least marginally better, but this is no slouch, either. Worth an effort to sample."
"D - Fine for the style, I get a little overwhelmed with piney hops otherwise it would be higher. Smooth and balanced after a few sips."
"Founders didnt break any new ground here in the Double IPA category but its one of the most balanced drinkable IPA's Ive had so its totally worth filling up your fridge with this brew."
"O: Put another check in the win column for Founders. Their Double Trouble is great drinking, and one that I will certainly be returning to. The balance between the hop oil, malt and alcohol is awesome. Another high gravity beer done right by one of the best breweries in the business."
"D- I enjoyed this beer, very smooth and easy to drink. Light tasting. With 86 IBU's and 9.4 ABV it packs a punch that is easy to enjoy. Very good beer."
"D - Considering it is a 9.4% DIPA this is very drinkable. I was warned that it was a palate destroyer, but that was not the case at all. Good IPA."
"I really like this -- reminds of a Smuttynose IPA, but a lot more intense both in terms of fruit, savory herbs, and alcohol. I'll definitely buy another pack of this...so well balanced with a long finish and excellent mouthfeel."
"D- The dominating grassy and resinous character of this beer is a little off putting and makes this one harder to drink. A good DIPA, but I would prefer one with a more complex hop character."
"d- I could drink about a dozen of these. I am really enjoying the hops on this one. Great beer"
"overall - IMO one of the best beers ever made!"
"Pours a medium gold color w/ a very thin white head. The smell is very fruity and sweet, almost like a fruit basket- very nice. Nice malt and hop taste mixed w/ a sweet fruity taste. Very nice sweet aftertaste, w/ a hoppy tinge to it. This beer isn't quite up to the reviews I've read on it, but it's very good, and I'll definitely try it again to confirm my opinion. This is the first time I've tried Double Trouble, and I'll definitely try it again. Very good beer, just not World Class for me."
"Golden amber in color with a soapy white head...moderate haze. It's got a wonderfully fresh citric, fruit, and pale malt. It's a mildly sugary, very sweet taste, with a lot of bitterness for balance. Good fresh, fruity, lemon-orange hop flavor. Not overly bitter. Orange blossom. Mildly peppery. Overall, this is a hoppy, perfumy, and very drinkable IPA."
"D-its a great IPA, a slow drinker, and something I wouldn't mind having all night. I'll definitely be recommending this to friends. I just wish it were available in Florida."
"D: There's a hint of alcohol. I like this beer and wish it was available locally!"
"D- Good and pretty easy to drink, this is one of the rare IIPAs that I would consider sessionable, well maybe not a big session but could easily split a sixer with someone."
"D - If you're a DIPA fan, this one would be easy to put a few back during the night. The alcohol is masked very well here. Definitely worth seeking out."
"D- Very good beer but not seductive enough to make me want another four pack. I think I'll try a different DIPA next time. That said, It is worth trying, especially if you are an IPA fan."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. good hop depth and a nice malt character. good stuff!"
"The only knock on this beer is that it goes down so so smooth that it boomerangs at you a bit. Must respect the fruity flavor and well hidden alcohol."
"You can taste the bready like malt on the aftertaste mixing in with the hops oh so well. What an awesome beer. It also reminds me of the Ballast Point with that almost off putting smell with the ridiculous amount of hops and probably the hop variety they use mixing together to create a huge unusual aroma you normally aren't used to smelling in a beer. You can also taste the grapefruit hops. I've found with these types of higher alcohol IPA's they are best to warm a bit and the bitterness and mouthfeel really come out to play. I will definitely be trying more Founder's beers now this is an Imperial IPA they should brew year round."
"edit: 5/30/2011 - I've now had this beer many many times including on tap and gotta say it is one of my go to double ipas. originally I gave this beer 4.0 across the board, but gotta bump smell taste and overall to 4.5. there is a really nice sweetness balancing this out, even fresh (sipping on one bottled just over a month ago). great hop profile, but even sweetness that balances things out making it a great beer for any occassion."
"D- Very easy to drink. Too easy to drink. Slight booze burn. A definite sipper. This will sneak up on you."
"D: Pretty drinkable for 9% abv"
"Excellent."
"Off-white frothy head swells above a hazy, pineapple yellow-orange body. Smells of pungent grapefruit and sweet aromatics. A smooth, yet lively burst of citrus, grassy hops lead the taste -- finishes with a nice bitterness and tingled taste buds. Medium mouthfeel; hops oils linger on the enamel. One of my favorite imperials, and yet another one that I would never guess was 9.4% As was once said by a great man, """If you call that a beer, I'd rather have another one.""""
"Quite drinkable as well, with no detectable alcohol."
"D: Very drinkable DIPA, basically no trace of the high ABV present. This is a nicely balanced beer, the up front hops is complimented by the sweet malts and citrus flavor, a solid DIPA."
"pours a hazy golden orange into my 'ephemere' 16oz tulip and puts up a 1/2 finger head - spotty lacing works it's way down the glass -a very hoppy nose with grapefruit and pine up front - taste is right there with the grapefruit and pine resins accentuated by a prickly carbonation on the tip of the tongue, smoothed out and balanced with a nice malt finish - very flavorful - good body with a slick mouthfeel - I could easily drink the whole 4 pack in one sitting if I wasn't more careful...."
"D: No alcohol to be tasted, uncommonly simple flavor and easy, wet finish.... oh yeah, extremely high :o"
"d: This is a very drinkable Imperial IPA and wish that I had more. It's not a monstrous explosion of hops but a well delivered, balanced hoppy craft brew. Well done Founders in not chasing after the 100+ IBU mark."
"D: This a quite a drinkable DIPA in my opinion, wonderfully piney and tropical funky."
"D: Usually I would not place a beer at 9.4% as a 5 for drinkability, but alas, this beer is just so damn tasty that is is utterly drinkable. The few times It has been on tap at my craft beer bar I start , and end with it, maybe trying one other beer in the middle and deciding it was a mistake to abandon perfection. A+"
"D- No alc, would have guessed 5%. Extremely easy to drink. A great beer if you want just hops. I have to stop myself from trying to drink more."
"bt"
"I just had my first bottles of fresh Pliny the Elder not too long ago. And I have to say, as much as I liked Pliny, I prefer this one to Pliny because it offers more complexity as opposed to Pliney's one-note character."
"great drink ability although it will catch up to you!"
"A translucent golden color, not much head on the top of the pour, gives way to slight lacing as it is consumed. A piney and citrusy smell is given off. I taste grapefruit and other citrus notes. It has a medium mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation. I could drink several of these in one sitting, although with the high abv, not the best idea. One of my favorite dipa's along with Hopslam. This one is not as sweet though."
"It's yellow fizzy beer! Well more like straw gold and hazy, with a thing white head that produces some lacing. Piney and citrus on the nose. Really not much going on here. Flavors of pine, citrus and slight resinous hops. Not much if any malt presence with a somewhat thin mouthfeel. Very bitter lingering aftertaste. Very hop forward, lacking balance. Tasty but lacking in the category of X2IPA."
"On Tap at Shark Club of Howell, MI"
"Drink- I like what Founders does. 4th beer and again a really good one at that."
"D: The overall drinkability is decent. Double Trouble is a great beer for the hop head that likes a beer of straight hops and little malts. I personally would rather drink a Surly Abrasive or Bell's Hopslam."
"For the 9.4% abv its hardly noticeable, so for that i tip my hat to founders. Extremely aromatic and flavorful, if your a fan of the tropical fruit like IIPA's then this is a must try! Almost like Lagunitas A Little sumpin' sumpin' on crack and steroids."
"I'm usually not a fan of the super-danky DIPA's but this is one of the better ones I've had. The hop assault is tough but nice flavors make it worthwhile."
"Great drinker, easy to put down quick and to cleanse between a Bourbon County Vertical!!"
"Very happy with another Founders brew. Really like their products and recommend them highly!"
"Very tasty wish I had a few more. Great DIPA!!"
"summer."
"Drinkability -- Wow. This year's batch of Double Trouble is killing it! Having consumed fresh Hopslam for a week, this is definitely as good as its heralded Michiganian cousin, if not better. Lots of great juicy citrus, solid bitterness, and a caramel malt base that is really exceptional. Love it."
"I think the Hopslam bing this last week made me appriciate this beer even more this review. While it isn't as smooth or drinkable as Hopslam, the hoppiness is much more pronounced."
"D -- Definitely worth a shot, a hint off balance but still solid."
"d 4.5 back to back against hopslam, double trouble strikes me as even more drinkable due to having enough rindy bitterness to counter the abundant pale sweetness. personally, my ideal iipa would feature something"
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin for such a big double-hopped big imperial, but I kept trying to just smell the beer and couldn't help but sip it. So it's also highly drinkable. It's just not as balanced between bitter and sweet, malt and hops. Assertive is an understatement."
"This pours with a nice, thick head, which is disappearing as I type this. Has a hazy, tan appearance. Floral, citrusy smell. Smells great, actually. The taste is a little bitter, with the citrus and pine hops flavor I like. There's some sweet maltiness to balance this out. As I'm drinking, the beer is leaving behind a lot of lacing on the side of the glass. Another great DIPA."
"Drink is decent, quite a bit of bitterness, especially on the finish, dries a bit on the finish, but drinks much easier than 9.4%. A slight malt backbone helps balance the heavy hops as well."
"All in all a great DIPA, but not one you need to kill yourself over trying to get a hold of. Hercules is very similar to this beer in a number of ways, but I prefer Great Divide's effort in this case."
"WOW!! This is one of the best IPA's ive ever had. It all starts with the smell - grapefruit hops, hmmmm. And the taste is the same, I love it, thank you founders for finally coming to NY, i love you, gnite."
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass which produced somewhere between a pale and amber color with not much head to it. This had a nice hoppy aroma with a mix of piney and citrus notes. It was nicely light bodied considering the alcohol content. This was almost dangerously drinkable with a nice refreshing hoppy finish. Another excellent beer from Founders."
"I'd say good for a hophead but it's a little pricey, not my favorite style of hops and kinda limited so I rank this a little low. I'm surprised to see this many great reviews on this beer. It's ok, but definitely no A in my book."
"12oz. bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a slightly hazy gold with a finger of fine bubbled white head. Big grapefruit hop aroma, very fragrant. Medium bodied. Fair amount of malt sweetness, but this is all about the hops. Drying hop bitterness that lingers in the finish. Fresh, green and dank. If you need a hop fix, this is it. Easy drinking for the ABV."
"This is a fine example of the style. It has a unique dryness to it, lending to the astringent alcohol. But, through that, the flavors are strong, balanced, and quite delicious."
"after a few sips, the alcohol does come up to bite a little bit, but not overly so, however i can see how it may offend some people. highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Incredible mouthfeel and easy to drink. This is a good DIPA, but not a real standout; which isn't a bad thing, it just doesn't have the wow factors some of the other """great""" DIPAs have. This is a well done basic DIPA. One issue that needs to be fixed is the foam head left after a pour: the head quickly dissipates into lacing."
"D- This is a great effort by founders and I love the grapefruit qualities."
"Great DIPA from Founders, definitely satisfies. It's a nice beer to look forward each year.. consume fresh! Recommended."
"Good beer, the mouthfeel was silky and smooth and my favorite aspect which added to the drinkability."
"The taste for me was somewhat unexpected following the smell. Initial hints of fruit and caramel, followed by a very bitter/tart finish. It's an addicting contrast, and it's easy to forget that the ABV is over 9%. Very drinkable and not as in your face as you might imagine. Definitely one of the better versions of the Double IPA that I've tried."
"D- its a good dipa and a rather easy drinking one at that but its a bit heavier on the palate and the sweetness then I like."
"D - good drinkability."
"D - Very very drinkable beer. Its so smooth and the alcohol isn't coming through that much in the nose or taste that you could drink a few of these and that 9.4% would catch you way off guard. Think I may be grabbing a sixer of this on my next stop at Warehouse."
"Time for another taste o' the Double Trouble. This time, it pours a hazy golden straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, melon, leeks, light caramel, and light honey. The taste holds notes of pine, yellow grapefruit, light leek, and very light caramel. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, a fine DIPA, but it's very one-sided in favor of dry hops. Generally speaking this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does get pretty tiresome and boring after a while."
"D: I'm really enjoying this. Very balanced. This is a dangerously drinkable IPA with no trace of alcohol despite the 9.4 abv. Those IPA folks out there expecting or wanting the """HopBomb""" should look elsewhere. There is a real delicateness to this IPA and one that I will seek out for now on."
"D- Very drinkable and not too heavy! Alcohol is warming however not restrictive. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability - certainly a beer worth seeking out each season. However, I find that I'd rather have something that took a bigger stand (ie - the heavy maltiness of 90min IPA or the sweet fruitiness of Ithaca Flower Power). Price is high, but well worth it for the hop heads out there."
"d. pretty drinkable. id enjoy a few if i had the money. good work founders...."
"D: One then that's it... This is a big hopped up beer that deserves more respect than trying to drink more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Good beer. Not my favorite type or style, it was quite good and would easily drink again."
"D - Very drinkable, especially considering the relatively high abv (9.4%), it is not overly noticeable as the beer feels nice and smooth and crisp. Very well balanced overall."
"D - a fun and surprisingly easy drink for a double. be careful!"
"Medium body, decent carbonation, dry and bitter on the tongue. For a heavier DIPA, this is still easy drinking, although there's definitely some heat from the 9.4% ABV, but I thought it suited the beer pretty well. I look forward to this beer every year, and I wasn't disappointed."
"This brew goes down very easly. Especially for such a high ABV. A true hop head would be able to session a few of these brews. However, with the high ABV and the huge bitterness of brew would make it hard for most people to have more then of these brews in a sitting."
"Pale yellow/orange body with a thick white head. Aroma of pine and citrus is immediately obvious. Some earthy tones as well. Flavor pretty much in line with what I expected: sweet toffee malts, citrusy' and some earthy (almost salty/onion-y?) notes. Finishes very bitter and earthy. Well carbonated and the finish coats your mouth with a sticky sweet residue. I seem to drink this beer as if it were a 4 percent abc session beer. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Overall- They don't call this Double Trouble for nothing, very drinkable for 9.4%."
"Drinkability: Part of this is just purely bitter, which is not really my style. I prefer more citrus and tropical fruit. This has a good hoppy emphasis though."
"D: Goes down so very quickly. The 12 oz won't last too long in my glass! Drink up my friends!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and juicy, punctuated with a peppery prickle (from the alchohol?). But overall this is a very drinkable beer. It is not as complex as some of the top IIPA's, but very enjoyable, a well made beer, worth seeking out."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color with a thin white foam that hangs on the surface. The smell is of grapefruit and pine resin. Orange blossom and a tad bit of honey mixed in. Essentially it smells mainly of fruity hops. The flavor is of earthy grapefruit and orange zest. Not overly potent, I would like to hope that this which is as new as I could have reasonably gotten it isn't already past it's prime. The mouthfeel is the standard bitterness, but not nearly as frustratingly acidic as many other beers that I've had. I can't believe this is a DIPA, it has the lightness of a regular IPA. The drinkability is good on this beer, though to anyone drinking it, I would make damn sure it's as fresh as possible."
"D - goes down way easier than it should, good thing it's expensive or I could overindulge on this one. Excellent offering."
"I truly don't believe this is a great representation of east coast DIPAs, west coast DIPA's, or DIPA's in general. It's just simple, bitter, and dry."
"Bottle dated 12/28/10. Poured into NB globe, color is golden peach with a tiny white head that fades quickly to a creamy collar with nice lacing. Smell is citrus hops, grapefruit, bubble gum, tropical fruit, pineapple. A great showcase of American hops. Taste follows smell, very bitter but lots of citrus fruit, lemon zest, grapefruit, pine, some pineapple, a touch of pale malt some alcohol and a bitter spicy hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light medium carbonation, finishes pretty clean. A very drinkable beer, this is my favorite founders brew. This one is right up there with Elder, the best east coast example of the style."
"Comments: Glad I got to try this fresh. Oddly enough, each additional smell has a slight alcohol (rubbing?) burn to it..."
"D - Extremely drinkable, but I don't know if I could handle more than a couple of these. I intend to pair this with a spicy chicken or shrimp dish in the near future."
"DB- Extremely hoppy Double IPA, who would have guessed. This reminds me of the Devil Dancer hop attack, I wouldn't review another beer after this. It doesn't bother me as much as Devil Dancer, the flavors sustain with the experience, it doesn't feel to hop messy. Good but one four-pack per fresh batch will do me good."
"A clear golden orange pour with a nice head with good retention and lacing. A very clean tangerine nose with a touch of spice, one dimensional tangerine nose(wish the hop bill was a bit more complex as this could have been absolutely amazing). A solid tangerine hop presence is the main player in the taste with some pine bitterness with some heat presence. The taste could be cleaned up a tad and this dipa could be one of the best ever, a little bit drier and a slightly more complex hop bill and we are talking top 5 dipa in the world. The carbonation is medium and works well with this beer, the hop resins are moderate. As I mentioned above a little more dryness, a slightly more complex hop bill and we are talking about one of the greatest dipa's on the planet. A very solid beer."
"D- very nice IIPA, this is a good one, definitely a well-disguised sipper, another solid seasonal from Founder's"
"D: Very drinkable considering the style and high ABV; the bitterness here never becomes overbearing and the flavor is tasty enough to make each sip quite worthwhile. It probably wouldn't be hard to put a four pack of this away in a night."
"It's surprisingly drinkable for a beer with such a high ABV. Goes down really smooth and leaves me wanting more. Probably not a good idea at 9.4% though."
"Drinkability is high for an alcohol of this ABV. It's a nice DIPA, Founders never disappoints."
"Notes: Just what I like in a DIPA. Formidably bitter, but with all those nice vibrant tropical fruit flavors."
"D: Decent drinkability for a DIPA. Its so goddamn bitter at the end that its hard to drink more than one in a sitting, but it is tasty."
"This brew is solid and a welcome addition to the pantheon of DIPAs."
"Hides the alcohol well, this beer goes down easier than it should!"
"Truly enjoyable. Wish I could get my hands on it more regularly."
"D - Dangerously. I can't believe this puppy clocks in at over 9%! Puts Pliny to shame in this category."
"SUBLIME, MUST TRY!"
"Overall impression: Good DIPA, and vastly superior to Devil Dancer."
"Poured a 10 day old double trouble into a pint glass with some glorious carbonation and a creamy half inch white head. Bubbles slowly creep towards the top and its quite the sight. Smells like straight up grapefruit and piny hops. Tastes is phenomenal and resembles just biting into a plate of fresh fruit with a hoppy cut to the tongue afterwards. It feels real creamy and I can take these out so fast. Double Trouble is definitely one of the best DIPAs around."
"I really liked it and wish I could easily access more."
"D: Well hidden ABV, making it dangerous due to a high drinkability. Good DIPA, probably a bit old at tasting time, but a very solid representation of the style."
"Trouble is a good word for it. The hops will knock you on your ass if you aren't expecting them, though they are balanced very well. The ABV is thoroughly masked. Not for the faint-of-palate but if IPAs are your thing, this is worth a try."
"The DT is very easy to drink, with the alcohol making its presence known without ruining the party. This was the first beer from Founders that I ever had, and it is probably my favorite. Great effort from a great brewery."
"Drinkabilty - Its alot smoother then i figured it would be. But at 9.4% that drops it down. If you love hops but devil dancer was to much for you, this may be the ticket. Also, i wonder how fresh this bottle is. It might be a little old so i take that into consideration about the taste. Another great beer from founders"
"This 12oz bottle was poured into a cervoise. It appears a cloudy, straw yellow with a puffy white head that leaves good lacing. I smell floral hops, some grapefruit, orange peel and pine. This very hoppy beer has more of the earthy, piney, woody hop taste rather than the citrus. Decent sweet malt background. The mouthfeel is dry and semi-tacky. I enjoyed this one and could drink a couple."
"D - I think the drinkability of this beer is pretty good. It goes down smooth, and the tropical fruitiness of it makes it even more enjoyable. I would for sure pick this beer up again."
"D= I couldn't drink about one of these wouldn't really want to drink anymore than that pretty boozy for me but still pretty good."
"D- ABV is very well masked here. A sweet and hoppy DIP which i could find myself getting carried away with. Well done Founders! one of the better ales I have encountered"
"Needs more carbonation."
"nice medium + body with medium carbonation. very drinkable for a DIPA. outstanding beer. from a brewery known for their stouts, IMO this is one hell of a DIPA."
"Balanced taste / palate until a real alcohol-fueled kick at the end. A very bitter finish - quite pleasant, if that's what you're looking for - but a much boozier taste than I'd expected. At 9.4%, alcohol flavour is to be expected, and without the (super) sweetness of many barley wines. Something to enjoy on occasion, but definitely not a session beer."
"- Overall another big hit for Founders. Really digging these folks. Solid brews all around, and this is a big drinker for sure.. hiding it's strength very well. Goes down well... even for such a big hop beast."
"D- The acidity is a bit too much for my liking, but 1 or 2 is great."
"goes down well. nothing I haven't had many times before, but with a pleasant tropical fruitiness that makes it sweet, but not cloying. a good beer, but overall its forgettable."
"12 oz. stubby with lots of sediment in the bottle - conditioned? 86 IBUs. It is a chill-hazed golden orange, with low carbonation and a half inch of whitish head that leaves some bits of lacing. Toast and fresh bread in the nose, with lots of piney, citric and tropical hops, and a breath of alcohol. The malts smell great and are well-integrated with the strong dose of hops. It has a delicious malt flavor as well, lightly sweet, with orange, pine, pineapple and tobacco-flavored hops that impart loads of bitterness. Medium body, with low carbonation and a nice long bitter finish. It's great to finally have a double IPA that isn't overloaded with crystal malts. Quite a dangerous brew - delicious, smooth and deceptively high in alcohol."
"Very beautiful poor. Nice golden copper hugh with a frothy white head that's full of retention. Smell has hints of apricots, clementines, and caramel malts. Tastes delicious. Sweet caramel malts come out first followed by tongue coating hops, hops and more hops. The hop bitterness hangs out on the tongue for a good 30 seconds after every swallow. This beer for those daring to venture into Hopdom. Considering this bottle is over a year and a half old it's hard to imagine how hoppy it could be when fresh."
"d- really nice for the abv, goes down very easily, i would drink this again for sure, solid dipa. great work again founders."
"Drinkable, yes although the alcohol is high to be just pounding these down"
"D: Goes down alright, but the lack of sweetness makes it a little hard to put down fast."
"Poured this in my chilled pilsner glass and the head rose to the occasion. Two finger head of rich, tight, creamy bubbles of just slightly off white color. A wonderful lacing followed that clings to the side of the glass like ribbons of white ice. The color of the brew rated a 10 on the SRM Beer color chart, respectable for a IPA. I found myself captured by the intense lime and malt smell, with a little corn , wheat, malt, and grapefruit. Creamy and zippy as the brew washed over my tongue, upper palate and rear upper palette. I will get more of this beer. I was sorry when I found myself looking at the bottom of my glass and there was no more of the exotic brew left. I will share this with my friends that like a good refreshing beer that doesn't taste like the run of the mill brew that you can find anywhere."
"Great IPA, i'll buy it when i comes out fresh each year. another Midwest IPA to search out."
"This brew has an oily feel to it, along with a warm finish."
"One my favorite DIPAs. All around solid brew."
"One distinguishing aspect of this ale is the clean, refreshing (dare I say West Coast?) effect of it's flavor profile. It's chock-full of IBU's and will satisfy any hophead, but it's really one of the more drinkable DIPA's I've come across."
"The beer is a deep gold color with a short white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is of citrus, floral hops and some caramelized malts. The taste starts out a strong burst of fruity citrus sweetness and another strong burst of hops bitterness that complement each other well. The malt character is on the thin side for the style and it allows the hoppy and sweet flavors to be more intense. Likewise the after-taste is sweet and hoppy. Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, strong kick, very good representation of style."
"D - Quite drinkable, despite the ABV. One of my go-to DIPAs, I look forward to these being on the shelves again."
"D - One of the best DIPA's for drinkability. I really wish I had (or could get) another. So smooth and balanced, the ABV is really the only thing standing between you and an entire 6 pack."
"Notes: Too much alcohol for me, a little unrefined, and a little sloppy. Good offering from Founders, but I much prefer the stouts."
"Drinkability: A good beer, but lacks depth to be a truly great DIPA. Definitely a good beer and worth a shot, though if I'm in the mood for a DIPA, I'd look this one over in favor of others."
"Pours a surprisingly bright yellow- like urinating after taking a vitamin. Wonderful aromas of pine as well as sweet malt and orange and grapefruit rind. Tastes rich and full with lots of pine and caramel malt, and very balanced. Very smooth in the mouth, if a bit thick. A very nice beer."
"A really nice (d)IPA, my kind of beer. Tasted at a beer sampling at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"First DIPA I've tried and I am definitely impressed. A very well rounded beer. Flavors are robust yet balanced. Feel is dry then clean and crisp at the end. Alcohol is barely detectable in the taste, making it somewhat deceptive and even dangerous. My gut tells me this has been aged because the hops seem a bit restrained and the finish just a tad too smooth. Maybe I'm wrong and the beer is just that good. Another exceptional brew from Founders."
"D - I'm guessing this one has mellowed out a tad in the last 6 to 7 months, as it was probably the most drinkable beer I have experienced at 9.4%. I'd like to try it fresh at some point, but this one is very drinkable with a little age on it. So beware, four of these would probably put you on your ass."
"Ti's is à perfect brew for à Nice hot summer day"
"D. Hop heavy without being overly bitter and because of the, well hidden, high alcohol content it's likely to get you into trouble quickly."
"Poured a nice orange with a slight haze to it. Two fingers of soft off white head left behind plenty of sticky lace. The smell is nothing but hops. All I picked up was fresh fruit and pinesol...awesome. The taste was right on the money with the smell. Lost of fresh hops up front giving it a wonderful grapfruit and apricot taste that is backed up by a sticky pine freshness. Mouthfeel was full and smooth. Drinkability was very nice also. I couldn't tell it was 9.4% but could sure feel it after drinking two."
"Pours a hazy golden orange, with a couple fingers of soapy white head. Tons of webbed, sticky lace. Immediately I get a whiff of this stuff, and haven't even dug my nose into this yet. Upon further olfactory investigation, I get a giant wave of pineapple, mango, orange and other tropical fruits. Solid malt backbone, and a hint of alcohol in here as well. I wanna get into this now. Hint of the malt and the hops lead the assault here, chased on its heels with a significant bitterness and a light wave of alcohol. Mostly pineapple and orange in the hops here. Wow this is solid. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium-high carbonation and the drinkability is through the roof. The alcohol pops its head through at the end of every gorgeous sip, teasing me. I know it's coming, and yet can't resist another sip of this. I need another."
"This is a very well-balanced IPA. I generally enjoy the maltier IPAs because it provides exactly this - balance."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, hops, mixture of grapefruity and pine hops. In the taste, sticky sweet grapefruity hops and a hint of alcohol. A small bite, but mainly smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry grapefruit hop aftertaste. Nice big hops, a bit sticky, but really nice, nonetheless."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Very light, clear, orange-yellow pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Lots of citrus in the nose dominated by lemon and tangerine. Slightly herbal and medicinal. Big, spicy, bitter, wet hop bite that dominates the sweet malt, but not to the point where it's too much. Complex with hints of grapefruit, tangerine, tea, orange, and pine. Just enough sweetness to keep it honest. Slightly medicinal as the alcohol warms from start to finish. Nice, crisp, dry finish that's a bit resiny at the same time. And even though the alcohol isn't totally hidden, it's still quite drinkable. I'm three for three with Founders beers. Can't wait for four!"
"D - Good. One at a time to appreciate the experience."
"I can't wait for this to hit the shelves again late this year."
"Drinkability - Ehh, for the ABV yes, but when I had Founders Centennial and Two Hearted in the refrigerator, I most defiantly went to grab those over this. Will not get this in the future."
"D - I should go out anf find a fresh one to see just how much of a hop bomb this really is, as I think this is one that should probably not be cellared. Still was very delicious and a definite recommendation."
"D: I love this beer. Would be able to drink a lot of these if it didn't leave such a bitter aftertaste. Some bitter hops can be good, but this isn't."
"D: Nothing at all wrong with this DIPA. There is just nothing that really stands out about it. I mean I love it, but it doesn't jump out at me. Maybe I've just been drinking too many hops beers lately. I would drink this again and again if available, but there are better DIPAs out there."
"D- Not a terrible IPA, but the hop profile is a little one-dimensional (sort of reminiscent of oskar blues gubna, but a bit sweeter and maltier); it was hard for me to finish this one."
"As I said before another great offering from Founders, these guys just know how to brew a fantastic beer"
"Drinkability - Really enjoyed the experience of this beer. A real pleasure to drink due to the fresh aromas and well balanced flavors. I had to restrain myself from drinking this too quickly because of all of the nice fruit flavors and smooth crispness of this brew. Very well balanced and smooth for a DIPA. It does not have the hop intensity or as rich and complex flavors as some DIPAs, but that's not all bad. The balance of the fruit and hops makes this a worthy DIPA. Definitely look forward to having future sessions with this beer and sharing with family/friends who enjoy Big IPAs!!"
"D: The alcohol sneaks up on you but it is hidden well making this a pleasant sipper"
"D: Founders Double trouble is dangerous as it is a delicious hop/malt combo that is easy to drink without the slightest hint of alcohol """heat""". At 9.4% abv, I should not drink as many of these as I would want to."
"The bar has now been set dangerously high. Also this is the first brew I have ever tried by Founders and its a great start."
"D- A very good, drinkable beer. It definitely sticks out as DIPA I'll remember. The flavors really do jump out at you. I don't know if I'd drink the whole pack, but more enjoy one at night!"
"D: Nice drinking IPA, spicy, fruity with a dry finish that is definitely 6 pack worthy and a fine example per style. Started out drinking this fairly cold (around 38-40F) which highlighted the lighter, fruiter, and spicy side, and finished up a bit warmer which brought out the dry grassy hops of 86ibus. Sip and savor through the temperature spectrum to full appreciate all this has to offer."
"I actually allowed the last third of my pint to come to room temperature(accidently)but I still found this beer drinkable and complex."
"D - solid double IPA, a nice one to sip on during a summer night"
"It's a good double IPA, but there are better ones out there that better hide their alcohol."
"D: For a hophead such as myself, this is quite drinkable. There really is not any alcohol detectable and the sweet tropical fruit/bitter hop counterpoint is quite mind-expanding. I have had this beer several times and I have never been quite this impressed with its complexity and craftsmanship. It is by far the best double I have had in awhile. Congratulations, Founders. I am starting to think that if I had to choose on brewery from which to drink beer from for the rest of my life, the gem in Grand Rapids would be the one."
"D - This is a fine example of the style. The malt takes a back seat here and is somewhat 1-dimensional, but that allows the hops to really shine and the blend is quite nice and satisfactory. Overall, this is an above average double IPA."
"Pours more like a wheat beer than a IPA, cloudy with a sun-kissed hue vs the amber rust of a traditional IPA. There is a slight creamy head that sticks to the edge of your glass. The alluring aroma has a fairly standard sweet pine vapor, maybe a little sweeter than most IPA's but it definitely draws you in. When first you touch glass to lips visions of the mad scientists at Founders pureeing whole hops and stuffing them into bottles dance through your cranium. A very powerful pungent spice hits you like a ton of bricks. Either you raise your glass in triumph or recoil in horror. This beer is not for those who enjoy a pale, but for those who wish hops to become one with their soul. A sweet piney bitterness surrounds the experience. A dominant sweet taste rushes the palette at first with a strong bitter backside. After a few deep pulls at 9.4 A.B.UV. a warmth rushes the body. The lines are drawn either you praise the hop gods or you cruse spending 9 bucks on a 4 pack! Tis not a beer for the faint of heart but a true treat for the hop hounds."
"Bruisin' Ales. Pours golden with abundant off-white head. Citrus aroma, and delicous citrus grapefruit taste. It is a fantactic drinker and goes too quick. Above average mouthfeel.Incredible DIPA. Juicy wth pink and white grapefruit, and apricot. Good malty offset."
"M/D - easy drinking, way too easy for 9%, light bodied and amazing taste. I will have this again and again"
"Drinkability: Great beer. The only knock is the high alcohol content would limit me to one or two a sitting."
"D. Drinkable. The high abv shows through only slightly. I like big citrus grapefruit hopbombs and that is what this is. Is it Pliny or Hopslam, not quite but it probably the next best thing that I have had."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of strong floral hops, citrus, sweet malt, yeast, slight alcohol, and slight wood. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, sweet malt, citrus, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, very good aroma, appearance, and blend."
"Pours a hazy golden, almost straw color with not a very impresive head (and I poured aggressively). Smell is very sweet. I pick up lots of honey and sweet malts. Also maybe a bit of tropical fruits (mango, papaya). Wow, this taste is intense. Intense and delicious! I get hit with a truckload of hops up front and slowly fades to a nice, sweet honey flavor. I get lots of honey from this (similar to Bell's Hop Slam IMO). The high abv is present but is balanced well with the honey, fruits, malts, and hops. The mouthfeel is awesome and not too thin, not to thick. Drinkability is scary considering the abv. I could get myself into some trouble if I could get this beer where I live. Founders has yet to let me down so far. Great beer from a great brewery."
"Man...this is a complex, thinking man's beer! Very drinkable and highly recommended. Another Founders winner...big surprise!!"
"Pours a hazy yellow colour with a thick white head and spotty lacing. A huge hop smell of mostly pine and citrus, but some sweetness too. Taste has a refreshing hop blast, lots of grapefruit and a bit of sticky pine. Some toffee in the taste too. Really nice carbonation level, pretty spot on for the style. This is a sipper at this abv, but I am having no trouble downing this beer fairly quickly. I wish I had more than just one bottle."
"I prefer IPA to Imperial IPA, and Founders Centennial is, in my opinion, a better beer. This beer is, however, a fine representative of it's category."
"Drinkability: This is good stuff. Alcohol is a bit high to make it regularly drinkable; although you would never guess that it is near 10%."
"D: the beer invites you to have more, remarkable considering how hoppy this beer is (but not remarkable considering how happy this beer drinker is)."
"Drinkability: To me, this isnt a great example of the style but it is good, not great. I think they come in 4 packs. this was a single and it might have been out of date so i cant only rely on this one tasting to make my final judgement. Nice package though."
"D- The drinkability is good for a few but after that you might want to be switching to something a little more mild in taste because your taste buds will be working with this one. Overall a very good beer but I did expect a little more out of Founders considering all their other beers have been exceptional."
"D- If not for the ABV i could session this beer. One - two tops. Good, not great IIPA for the price $9.99/4 pack."
"D-Very enjoyable, and I would definately buy again, but I could see how this would become tiresome after a few. Great for a hop fix, but I think my palate may be shot for the evening...."
"I think I like just about everything Founders makes, and Double Trouble is no exception. It's a pretty solid IIPA."
"Reminds me of Hop Wallop in being a double that's paler, hotter and lighter than the single. A bit one note."
"D: This is an excellent Imperial IPA from Founders. Juicy, vibrantly fresh hop flavors and aromas make this a no-brainer. This drinks extremely easily and manages a great balance for such an inherently unbalanced style. Absolutely worth a try - another winner from Founders."
"On first impression it's hop-centric, but the malt ends up propping the bitterness despite an real pretense to balance. It ends up with something for everybody, and the big ABV seems to just be along for the ride, so it's nicely drinkable, if worthy of caution. Subtlety wins out over blunt force in this case, a nice turn of events."
"Great beer, reminds me of Hopslam, a lot. I don't know if I like this one more but I think they are neck and neck until next year where I can do a side by side."
"D. A superb brew. Another fine brew from founders."
"An exceptional DIPA is made by the uniqueness of the experience. This doesn't hold that. This is a very nicely balanced and flavored drink with no apparent problems or issues. I like it."
"Not the best beer in the world, but definitely an entirely enjoyable experience. throw the taste in with a 2 dollar price tag and it was GREAT"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. The well-balanced nose and palate combined with its smooth mouthfeel made this quite enjoyable. A great example of the style."
"d- a really smooth one with no challenging flavors to slow your drinking rate on this one"
"One of the most balanced, elegant, and profoundly enjoyable Double IPAs I've ever had, and more proof of Founders' incredible winning streak."
"D- A perfect 5...I could drink this by the pitcher!!"
" These baby's go down way to smooth IMO, real easy to polish of the 4 pack! you've got to try this one!"
"D) One was plenty for me. I acknowledge this style -- Imperial IPA -- is really not my favorite."
"it has a very citrusy hop nose with some floral notes. Golden-bronze color with suspended particulate giving it a slightly cloudiness, which is common in Imperial IPAs but still not necessarily impressive. Nice white head. Almost a bit creamy on the front end as it coats the mouth. Appropriate bitter finish but not too strong. I good imperial IPA but not the best i have had."
"Pretty good. An IPA that makes itself interesting with some range beyond the basic hop taste. A bit strong to drink a lot of, but I'd probably have it again, and this coming from someone who tends to shy away from hoppy beers."
"Edit: 01/14/12. Haven't has this in over a year and a half but liking this a lot better. Bumping the overall up to a 4.5."
"D- I would never be able to tell you that this beer weighs in at 9.4%. Great job on that Founders. I could put a few back in a sitting."
"Drinking this at my buddies wedding, much better than the BMC that is the alternative. Has a nice golden color to it with nice big white head. Smell is glorious, just a masterpiece of hoppy smells, one of the best smelling ipa's I have ever had. Taste is very very good, each sip is better than the next."
"12oz. bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Small, one-finger head. Gold, clear with obvious good carbonation. Nice lasting lacing. Nose is pine and resin with a fruit, especially orange, background. Taste is grapefruit, sweet malt background leaing to a bitter finish, but not overwhelmingly so. Kinda' just requires another sip, which I can handle... Mouthfeel is thinner than expected but oily. There is certainly no hint of the 9.4% ABV. This actually gets sweeter as it warms. Nicely balanced beer overall."
"D: I think a few of these would start to creep up my, but I wouldn't mind it one bit. This is just a phenominal beer that I always grab when I see it available. Founders just can't do wrong IMHO!"
"The carbonation was pretty high and tingly. There was this weird mouthfeel thing about halfway through the taste. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it but the mouth suddenly becomes dry. I get a similar mouthfeel in beers that are Brett heavy or have a lot of smoked malt, neither which this beer has. My only guess as to what causes it would be hop resins but I'm not positive."
"this beer is very drinkable. again, reminds me a lot of hopslam. could be dangerous because it is so smooth and comes in at 9.5% abv. can't get founders in nashville but will pick up a sixer of this every time I come through KY."
"Founders never seems to disappoint. No exception here."
"For some reason, DT reminds me of a Smuttynose Big A meets PtE. Just a small character of both beers and yet not a clone. Also, there's really not much balance in this beer so if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the D-IPA for you. I'm O.K. with that, the more bitter the better and Double Trouble delivers the goods. Well done, Founders."
"Great appearance, bold amber body, and massive grapefruit aroma. More of that on the palate, so damn good, I wish it was warmer when I had this, I can see this is a great big warm weather dipa. So drinkable at that high abv. Just gets better downward to the last drop. Highly recommended for any west coast ipa guys."
"Founder's Double Trouble pours yellow with a slight amber tinge with a white head from a brown half gallon growler. The aroma is all hops, grapefruit comes to mind. The flavor is intensely hoppy, pineapple and grapfruit like flavors dominate. Alcohol is only slightly noticeable, but this one packs quite a punch. Excellent beer, recommended."
"Big hop impact, this is truly bitter but not in a bad way. The flavor is big herbal hop blast with the fruitiness showing up towards the middle of the flavor. The after taste is strong and bitter. A very complex hop taste with the dank basement taste paired with flowery herbs and a citrus edge. Mouth feel is fine and this beer is truly a DIPA in that it's surely twice as big and bitter."
"overall this beer lives up to its name double trouble or hell a triple threat or a five tool beer it has the looks, smell, taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability. def. an All-Star DIPA"
"Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours a clear light orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet citrus, grassy hops, and garlicky hops. Flavor is quite similar -- lots of citrus, hop oils, garlicky hops, some caramel malt. Quite tasty, about equal to the bottle form."
"Cheers!"
"Clear golden color with some orange highlights. About 1 cm of head and some nice lacing. Smell- lots of citrus, pine. Taste- Sweet malt in the very beginning and then a big blast of hops, pine, grapefruit. I think I am tasting resin as well. Medium on the mouthfeel, right on point for the style. Prickly carbonation. The alcohol gets a little hot as the beer warms and the bitterness wears on me a bit which doesn't help the drinkability."
"Overall, this is a wonderful example of a DIPA. It's bitter and hoppy, while still paying a decent amount of respect to the malt. The fact that's it's widely available is also a major, because this is a beer that I will certainly have again. Another standout beer from a brewery that never disappoints."
"This is medium bodied with an average amount of carbonation. This is actually pretty drinkable. Can be tough at times because of the ABV level and the strong bitterness, but everything puts together makes this an enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability - For a 9.4% beer this is quite drinkable, but the intense hoppy nature of the beer can bring about palate fatigue. I'd say this is best enjoyed one beer at a time. Nonetheless, a very good DIPA worth seeking out to try."
"D: I never would have known this was almost 9.5%. Really easy to drink and incredibly flavorful without any perceivable alcohol."
"I was at a great little pizza place in DC that had this beer on tap as their """seasonal beer", after sampling it, I ordered it. They served it in a fab (huge) red wine glass. The aroma was clean and grassy but not as grassy as the Plinys. The mouthfeel and taste was smooth and amazingly drinkable, counting that this beer is 9.5% and it drank like a 5% beer. We don't get a lot of Founders down in FL (well not any) so I was super excited to find this, and enjoyed it very much with my lunch. I have enjoyed almost every Founders beer that I have come across in my beer travels and I am going to be very sad that I am not going to be finding any Double Trouble in Florida."
"D- Impressively drinkable for a 9.4% beer, although 1 is certainly enough to get my D.I.P.A fix. Really good quality beer, solid for the style, slightly warmer (alcohol warmth) than I like."
"Overall: I'm glad I bought a 4 pack of this. Despite it being 9.4%, the taste and feel leave me wanting a couple of these. The neck label notes that this beer has 86 IBU's, which I at first found odd, but after drinking realized that the bitterness here really makes this beer enjoyable."
"Poured to a two fingered head with big bubbles in the center of the glass. IPA itself was a almost yellow with brownish hints. Head was offwhite in color. Lots of lacing. Left some nice rings with every swallow. As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell grapefruit. Very citrusy smelling. Also some alcohol smell. Pine was also evident. Smelled great. Tasted citrusy, also strong pine. Had a nice bitter aftertaste. Aftertaste hung around your mouth for a while. Felt a little thick in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. After three swallows, I could feel the effect of the alcohol. My stomach got warm. It felt like I had a shot of booze. Ill buy these again. I just think you would have to be very carefull. It tastes so good you just want to guzzle it. Good brew at one at a time."
"It is not boozy - the alcohol is covered by the thick hops. This is a winner, but it would be difficult to drink two. It's a good thing I have others! ..."
"M/D: Well put together, good mouthfeel, dangerously drinkable."
"pours a hazy copper-orangish color with a good bit of lite fluffy head, and lots of carbonation. thin lacing covers the glass as the beer recedes. very hoppy smell and taste, with a vague hint of some citrus or fruity like flavors as well. very lite feel for such a hoppy beer, not in a bad way at all. this is a very drinkable, and delicious beer. very different from other DIPA's i've had."
"Flavors of grapefruit and pine fill the mouth upon first sip, and they're chased by a light malty sweetness, a touch of solventy alcohol and ultimately a sharp resiny bitterness. It's not an entirely dry beer, even in the finish, though it's not sweet either. Medium in body, it has a pleasant lightness to it for the hefty alcohol content. This is very good, not quite in the upper-eschelon of DIPAs, but highly enjoyable all the same."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. This beer is tasty, hoppy and has no taste of alcohol. This is probably the best non west coast IPA I've had since Hop Slam. Very good."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel, carbonation on the low side, but complimentary to the flavors. The finish kinda ruins this one for me...too much alcohol, which when combined with such an intense bitter hop flavor, makes me grimace a bit with each swallow."
"OVERALL: There seem to be some distractions at first, but the reality is, this beer is all about the bitterness. The first couple of sips mask the bitter flavor with floral scents and flavors, but as you get deeper into Double Trouble it becomes apparent that the hops are the star of the show and they are bitter. Not an easy drinkin' beer, but a fantastic beer for a hop head."
"Feel/Drink: Nice medium bodied DIPA. I like how the alcohol is hidden, makes this really drinkable. Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"Drinkability: Good for an imperial. I think the bitterness might wear on you after awhile, as might the higher ABV."
"drinkability: very solid DIPA, highly recommend and would seek out again"
"Drinkability- scary drinkable considering how high the abv is on this one, very nice strong hop finish really builds up as the beer warms up and continues to get closer to a room temperature, the balance is still there though this is overall definitely a beer made for the lover of hops, very nice example of the style which I enjoy quite a bit more in this years batch that last at least as per my own current tastes, worth look for while its still around"
"Drinkability is fairly good for such a hefty beer, mostly due to the fairly light body and immense dryness in the finish. Difficult to determine whether to sip or slosh this one, which can be a good or a bad thing. Good, as it makes the beer more desirable, but once the alcohol kicks in, that certainly becomes a negative. Overall, though, a pretty well-put-together DIPA."
"D: This is a good beer to sip; it's hoppy but also packs its punch by way of alcohol content."
"Great Aroma, Mouthfeel and taste. I wish this was a beer that easily cloneable."
"D - Quite drinkable for a DIPA but I wouldn't drink this beer all night long."
"Overall Impression: This one goes on the Mikey Likey List for sure! A nice hoppy punch in the face with a sweet malty backbone makes this one a winner!"
"definitely not sessionable. drinkability is average i guess, unless you like your beer as bitter as possible. i generally like ipa's but i might have to steer away from double ipa's. certainly not a boring beer, but i can't see myself drinking this often."
"Wow, I expected the hop kick but I was really surprised by the fruity snap on this one. Another great breakfast/buffet beer. Color was cloudy, bouquet was very hoppy without a hint of the grapefruity kick that was to come on the first sip. Good for breakfast or a hot summer day."
"D..Easy enough to drink, especially given the 9.4% ABV. However, with the taste being a small disappointment, the overall drinkability is diminished. Somewhere between an average and good beer."
"Drinkability: Right now this is my favorite IPA. What a flavor profile!"
"I like a good hoppy beer. I think the Founder's Cenntennial is a fine IPA. The problem is, more is not better. Just because you can pour an obscene amount of hops in a beer does not make it enjoyable. I realize that double IPA is a bit a of a daredevil beer by definition, but this beer misses the mark on hop character by a wide margin. It is not done artfully or well, just brash and decadent. The intensity is not fresh or floral, but resiny and overpoweringly grapefruit. I think even the most extreme beers need just a modicum of balance. There was none. Just grapefruit, grapefruit, and yes, more grapefruit."
"I'd say this was pretty drinkable, too bad I can't get it in Florida."
"I would have liked more fresh hop taste and the alcohol to be slightly cleaner. I had this one at a bar on accident and thought it was the best thing ever. I feel the bottled one is considerably different."
"Bravo."
"The Double Trouble pours a bright orange color with some haziness that prevents visibility through the glass. No lacing is noticed but there is some bubbly retention. Smell is dominated with sweet citrus fruits and pines. Some hops and caramel malts are also noticeable. Much more of the hop presence (86 IBU's) comes through on the palate. Other than the hop dominance in the quaff there is also a citrus presence. No alcohol is noticed in the taste. Mouthfeel is seemingly dry and bitter. Drinkability is solid, nothing compared to the bigger DIPA's but for the price definitely a go-to for those hoppy afternoons."
"on my fourth dipa of the night so the reviews have gotten shorter, and yet somehow sweeter. ha."
"D: One of the more drinkable DIPAs I've had. Will have to pick some more of these up after DLD. Alcohol is hidden well. Would love to have more."
"Drinkability is good. It goes down nice and easy for the style and is pretty tasty. A good choice for a double if you've never had one. I'd certainly not mind having another."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a cloudy golden color and poured a white foamy head. The smell of this beer was hoppy like a Christmas tree. The taste was the same, WAY hoppy. It was like putting a handful of spruce in your mouth. Too much of that I will not buy again."
"Wow great imperial IPA. Pours a bright, hazy, golden orange with an off white 2 finger head. Medium lacing. The nose is incredible on this beer. Citrus and grapefruit hops dance through your nasal passage in a delightful way. The citrus and grapefruit are well balanced with a fruity sweetness. The finish is an oily mouth coating finish of long drawn out grapefruit tartness. I will seek this beer out in the future."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/4""" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a malt forward scent that boasts of pale and bisquit malts. It's quite bitter with some bready notes. The hops are present in the nose, but the malts go a long way in hiding the overall aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a bitter hop punch up front with a bisquity finish. The hop flavor is quite good. It's piney up front with some light citrus notes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good DIPA. It's not your typical west coast version, but rather a more balanced and complex variety."
"Overall, pretty decent, nothing special."
"When did beer get so expensive? At $12 for a 4 pack, it's a bit pricey. But given the 9.4% alcohol in the end it's worth it. Visually it is cloudy and the color is a pale amber. The head is very creamy with good lacing. The aroma is very strong. Lots of grapefruit and bread. The bitterness kicks in early and stays throughout. Under it is plenty of grapefruit and orange. A slight banana flavor. And the hops definitely spice it up. The alcohol is very """round""" and helps mellow it a bit. Flavor and bitterness. Really a terrific double IPA."
"This one is definitely not a sipper. Get one, try it, drink it down, and move onto something better. If you have access to founders, you have access to stuff better than Double Trouble."
"O: A decent DIPA that doesn't satisfy by high expectations from such a great brewery."
"Original review from 3-16-10: 4.0/3.5/4.0/4.0/4.0 B+"
"D: Very good for the high 9.4% ABV. That being said, I probably wouldn't order more than one in a row."
"D - IPA fans would love this, others should be warned. It is extremely hoppy and is not for the faint of heart. High alcohol content is noticeable but not overpowering."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is my first go-round with this fine ale, and it really is up there with the best of em'. A well crafted beer to be sure."
"D: Sure I'd have another. Highly recommended."
"One of my favorite beers. It has a wonderful color and exquisite smell where you can really pick out the different flavors. The only area it lacks is it drinkability as it can be a little harsh but again this might be nitpicking as I believe it is fantastic beer."
"Poster child for the style. Dense, slightly syrupy-sweet malt trembling to support a mighty hops burden. Bitter grapefruit rind and a touch of piney resin. ETOH is the slightest bit hot at the finish, but not enough to be a detraction. A beer to be enjoyed at a leisurely pace."
"Pours a nice gold with smallish but persistent dense white head. Big citrusy hop smell- sweet grapefruit and lemon. Taste has a lot of good malt sweetness. Lots of hop flavor. Citrusy. Grapefruit again. Light bitterness. Some warming alcohol in the finish. Very nice full bodied mouthfeel. Easily drinkable. Very good IPA overall."
"With my love of hops and strong American IPAs, I have been trying just about everything under the sun lately. There have been others with stronger hop punch, but very few with this excellent blend. It reminds me of a good Scotch."
"Slightly hazy deep golden/orange color with just shy of a finger of off white head, though it was far from an aggressive pour. Lots of grapefruit and fresh peaches. There's also a sugary sweet malt aroma coming through. The taste of this is amazing. Lots of grapefruit throughout. Hits you right in the front and then again in the bitter finish. There's also a pretty fair amount of sweetness that comes through in a heavy peach note. Resiny pine through the middle that mixes nicely with the peach. You can feel the alcohol more than taste it. Very drinkable. Count me in as a big fan."
"Drinkability is average to below average due to the aftertaste I previously mentioned. In addition, the ABV. would likely limit mass consumption of this ale at a single seating. Still, not a bad beer to enjoy from time to time."
"Conclusion: Mad thanks to the wife for picking me up a 4-pack of this to celebrate my first graduate conference (and a win)! I'm honestly not quite sure how I feel about it. It's tasty, but a bit brash. I think I might actually let the remaining two sit in the cellar for awhile and see what they do w/a bit of age on 'em."
"Very good hop forward beer. Would enjoy again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed this beer and it's definitely my type of IPA. I might have to add this to the regular purchase rotation."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability is good, not great but good - this is a big time beer that even hop heads and rum runners must sip."
"always avoided this beer for some unknown reason. probably because i got it on tap and wasn't too impressed with it. that won't happen again. it was much bigger in the bottle. pours a slight hazed golden amber with a thin off white head. the smell is strong of grapefruit hops and alpha acids. much more aromatic than from a keg. the taste is sweet and hop forward with a slight bitter finish. very heavy. slight hints of juicy fruit mmm. the feel is just a bit heavy so that was a small hit on the drinkability for me."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Color was a light golden orange with a very small head that was gone in a squinit. As soon as i got a whiff of this beer i knew it was gonna be good. Strong hops with citrus and pine apple in the back. Taste was very good and the hops blended well with the fruity bite of citrus present. I could detect some alchohol after the finish but not unpleasant. This beer reminded me of hopslam a lot but with a more pronounced hop dominance probably due to the lack of honey. Mouthfeel was a medium- sharp sensation with the right amount of carbonation. Easy to drink but packs a wallop that seems a little stronger than advertised. Love it! Founders did their homework with this one."
"Drinking this is pretty easy for a double and hides the 9%+ pretty well. This is good."
"D - Pretty good HopSlam competitor. Not something you'd put back more than two of."
"I should note that I had this beer after a pliny the elder and while also drinking a hopslam for comparison sake, so my palate was pretty raw when I was done."
"Glad I went back for this stuff. Passed it up before when going to get Hopslam. Then I saw it was seasonal and decided I had to try it. It is the next best thing to Hopslam along with Dreadnaught. Why do they have to release it the same time as Hopslam? Be nice to have this in the summer to tide us over. Although I can't blame them for trying to compete because they do have a competitor here."
"D - Bottom line, most may not agree, but this is better than HopSlam. A great beer by a great brewery."
"Drinkability - So easy to drink this 9.4% IIPA. Alcohol is hidden very well by the amazing fruity/hoppy flavor. I would have another. So much for saving the 3 left out of my four pack to bring back to NY!"
"Yet another great beer from Founders. Try it."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for 9.4, possibly dangerously so. I've had both bottle and draft and although both are good, I preferred draft."
"I poured this soon after finishing a Centennial IPA so I could better tell the difference between Fonders single and their double. This one looked gorgeous. The cloudy chill gaze to the liquid was dark amber in color with a 2 finger fluffy white hewd sitting on the surface. I love DIPA's for their tropical aromas and this did not disappoint. Pineapple was abundantly detectable along with dank hops. The flavor was more bitter and less floral than I prefer but still showed some nice exotic DIPA characteristics. An excellent offering AGAIN from Founders."
"Mouthfeel is lighter with decent carbonation. Drinkability is okay, it tastes good (even with the hop blast), but its relative lack of a malt profile isn't a point in its favor"
"Very drinkable for a double IPA."
"D: An excellent IPA and very drinkable. Careful though as the ABV is high and subtle. A nice one to settle down to in the evening."
"D: Very good. I liked this one a lot as this beer is all about showcasing the hop. Great hop nose and flavor with minimal malt character and moderate bitterness allows the hop to shine through, without being obnoxious. Very drinkable."
"D: This beer is a very drinkable beer, especially if you like IPA's. I want my bro to have this beer because this, I know, will be something he will like!"
"Overall, this is an outstanding beer. Founders is racking up some serious points in my book. This is the best """normal""" IPA I have tried. I say """normal""" because my favorite IPA is still DFH 120, by miles."
"Pours a hazy gold color with minimal white head that fades to a white film. The smell, while not overpowering, is of citrusy, piney hops with a bcakground of candied sugars. Taste starts with citrus hops...evolves briefly to sweet candied malt..then back to piney hops. I think its worth mentioning that the 9.4 % abv is incognito, little to no alcohol burn to the nose or mouth. As usual with the Founders brews this beer is thick with ideal carbonation for my palate. Not often i reach for more than 2 big beers in an evening but this one can tempt. Doesnt have the reputation of Hopslam and im not complaining...just more for me to drink!!"
"Overall this is a great DIPA and another solid offering from Founders. Highly recommended."
"Double Trouble pours a slightly hazy light orange with a fluffy white head that clings to the glass. The nose contains notes of bitter citrus, pine, and on the back end some slightly sweet malts. The taste follows through on the promises made by the nose with strong floral hops, grapefruit, and orange peel. Mouthfeel is medium with just enough carbonation, and the finish is long with lingering citrus and hop bitterness. This is a BIG DIPA from Founders, similar to Bell's HopSlam and if you take the wet hop of HopSlam from the equation, it matches up quite well!"
"Great brew...going out to get a case tomorrow!"
"Poured into my new DFH signature glass. It has a slightly hazy deep golden color with a little over a finger worth of head that is leaving some great lacing as it recedes. The smell is incredible. There are some great orange and grapefruit citrus notes coupled with the hint of pine. The taste has a nice bitter presence upfront. The citrus taste is much more subdued than I was expecting. The pine come to the fore front on this beer and in a great way. The bitterness doesn't linger too long which leaves a nice finish. Overall this is definitely one of the best DIPAs I have had. I am curious to see how I have ranked it compared to others I have had, but it should be up there if not at the top. It is another beer by Founders that has impressed the hell out of me. Thank God they have arrived in Georgia."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It is hazy gold in color with a sticky little white head. Big, flowery pine aromas with a sweet citrus backdrop. Double Trouble is heavy on citrus and troprical fruit. The lingering finish has nice bitter counterpunch to the sweetness up front. The beer is full bodied and has a very sticky mouthfeel. My only regret with this is I waited so long to try it, a great DIPA."
"Pours a little lighter than I would like from an imperial ipa, with a decent head that leaves decent lacing down the glass. Not bad, but not great either. Smells a little light for a dipa, with a little citrus and more pine than anything. Tastes stronger than the smell, just a bit bigger. More citrus is noticeable. Nice tasting. Not my favorite dipa, but still very enjoyable."
"A favorite of mine from Founder's Brewing. Should not be missed by hopheads."
"D: Good...but I guess there's a reason I didn't polish off my entire fourpack in one sitting."
"D - The alcohol being hidden so well is a big plus, and so is the light body. I'd gladly have another, but considering how harsh it is on the taste buds, I'm not sure that's necessarily. If the taste kept up with the nose it would be even more drinkable based on the amount of goodness it provides. As it stands, it's still really good, and I'd love to have some more while it's still this fresh."
"D- Really a hop bomb. Quite bitter. This beer lives up to most of the hype. I like this a lot better than Ruination and 2hearted but it obviously is no where near HopSlam."
"D: I don't buy many cases of beer, but a brew that drinks this well, I need to have at my disposal. Basically a steal for $60 a case."
"On tap at Trappeze in Athens. Poured into a Gouden Carolus chalice (split pour). Big, frothy white head leaves soapy lacing all over the glass. Aroma is piney citrus and some grapefruit. Taste is everything you would expect out of a world class dipa plus a bit of spice on the backend. Bitter and juicy in every good way possible, improving even more upon warming. Delicious."
"Can't help but compare this to Hopslam. Double Trouble is more bitter, for sure, but lacks the strength and complexity in the aroma. I like 'em both, and I like they have different strengths."
"This was good and should satisfy anyones craving for a mouthful of hops."
"The alcohol is there but not distracting. Only the high abv slows down the drinkability, but no other issues here."
"D: More malt character would round out strong hops.l"
"D- Not very high, I was expecting something a little more complex. I let this warm quite a bit and I think the negative qualities (dryness, one note flavors) became even more obvious. I'm actually struggling to finish this one."
"I do love me some Founders (i must qualify). I'm downgrading this. I keep going back for Southern Tier Unearthly which i rated lower than Double Trouble so i had to revisit. Still a fine beer but i think i got carried away by memories of KBS and Breakfast Stout, and oh yes, Backwoods Bastard."
"The mouthfeel is nice and the drinkability is silly, like most DIPAs. Another great brew I've tried from a great brewery. Tis might be even greater of a score if i could get it even sooner, though it is still just a month old."
"D - Very good through & through. Definitely worth a shot if you came across it."
"D: the balance is amazing, the aroma is probably the best I've ever experienced in a hop forward brew, it is delicious and affordable"
"D-Very drinkable, very tasty. I think this brew is easily worth the price and deserves all of the hype-talk that it has received."
"If you don't like hops, you'll necessarily hate this beer. If you do like hops, this should give you a fix. Actually, it drinks rather well despite the intensity, taking nice full sips. Goes down smooth, once you get past the bitterness, but that wears off a little as your tongue goes numb."
"This has a smooth, creamy mouthfeel, balanced with nice airy carbonation. A great beer, smoother than many other DIPAs. Will definitely buy again."
"Cheers!"
"D - Incredible for and IPA and a beer with 9.4 ABV. Good Job."
"D: Hoppy and boozy but hey beer ist for the manly"
"Also, I love the label art."
"Pours a semi-hazy light copper color crowned with a thin and creamy, white head. The nose is sharp and bitter citrus hops and foreshadows the quick bitterness of the citrus hops in the flavor. A little bit overwhelming and is not quite in balance. The body however is very mild and viscous. Just my type, and makes the higher alcohol content comfortable and warming. The finish fades slowly and ends with a lingering tart and bitter flavor."
"The pale golden amber colored body was clear, and the head was quite thick. The aroma was a very inviting grapefruit and pineapple. The taste was bit more light than I prefer. The dry and earthy bitterness was on the money, but the lack of a solid malt backbone hurt the flavor a bit. The sweetness of more sugary and simple kind. The feel was sooth and slippery, with not a whole lot of tongue coating stickiness. The alcohol was very well hidden and the beer was very easy to drink."
"D- Now here's something funny, the bigger the gulps you take, the better this nbeer tastes! Not good for sipping but great for tearing through. The only problem with this is the 10% ABV, you can't keep up that pace very long!"
"Drinkability: This goes down so smooth it would be easy to drink 4 or 6 in a session, but that would not be my recommendation. A couple of these are enough to enjoy the evening."
"Maybe not the bitterest DIPA I have reviewed, but one of the most balanced and drinkable."
"Excellent offering from a great brewery."
"Very nice mouthfeel and a style that's easy to drink plenty of - which I plan on doing."
"I could definitely do with a few more of these. Wish six-packs were available instead of the four."
"D-i haven't had this in a long time and this is fantastic! big hop flavors, a little bitter at the finish; but so darn hoppy! i will be drinking more."
"A nice DIPA that doesn't weigh on you too much, nice drinkability. Worth trying and actually fun to drink."
"I made a point throughout the whole review to avoid the Hopslam comparisons. Yes, the two are very similar. Loads of grapefruit hops and excellent balance. I find Double Trouble more bitter, more boozy, and more citric. Hopslam is more about balance and pure grapefruit hops. Both are easily some of my favorite IPAs, so I can't pick a clear cut winner. Either way, this beer is supurb and well worth checking out."
"D: I love this beer it drinks so smooth."
"Double trouble is good... it's just not great. It is very hoppy, and that's certainly a good thing. The hop flavor blows away HopSlam both in violence and persistence. However, I just think DT lacks the delicate balance usually found in an excellent big beer, including the aforementioned Bell's product. This is especially noticeable in the flavor profile, but also comes through in the aroma of the beer. A good beer if you can get your hands on it, but there are better options at this ABV and in this style."
"Notes: I can understand the unnecessary hype putting this as the next best thing to Hopslam. Not that Founders needs any of the praise since it almost seems that they float above the ground. Mind you, it is an extraordinary brewery but nobody should scape from some critical analysis and Founders, good as they are, seems to get away with things others don´t. This is not necessarily their fault but is surely due in part the cultural vibe that is building around them, at least in the region from where I´m writing. Double Trouble is well above an average offering, and the nose is rather close to that of Hopslam, but the appearance is nowhere near it. Other than that it is a great DIPA without the hefty price tag, albeit not a cheap one either."
"Tasting notes from a few months back, dont have the exact date was near this years release."
"Libation: Quite a good hop bomb here, but it falls a bit short on the malt balance. Very nice overall, and I'll certainly try this again, but given the choice I might try some other options instead."
"D - Drinks exceptionally well. Forgive my blasphemy, but this may even be better than HopSlam. Utterly delicious and goes down very well."
"Overall this was much better than I remembered after finding it last year. Really a well done DIPA. Neck and neck with Hopslam for a winter seasonal although I think this one has a bit more bitterness whereas the honey sweetens the Hopslam a bit more. Both are very well worth a shot."
"In terms of drinkability, this beer is a true monster. It's a hop monster that takes no prisoners. In that regard, those that can take on the hop can really get to this beer."
"MaCain really fucking likey."
"D-Drinkable for the style. Complex and tasty. Lack of hoppy brews lately may have affected my scores, because this was a welcome change of pace."
"Finally got around to picking up a 4 pack of this DIPA. It's a good one, maybe not quite as sweet as some but still very tasty. Definitely worth a try."
" D: She aint no session beer.... did I say that right? I could really put more than one away tonight seeing the ABV and it is a weeknight I will have to find something more sessionable."
"I remember enjoying this more last year on tap at Ashleys - as I remember it, it seemed less piney, more integrated. But I had a lot of beer that night. Still its a pleasure and an education. Like being knuckle spanked by a nun."
"More citrus and tropical fruit flavors are present when tasting this beer along with some pine and pineapple that went unnoticed in the nose. Nice bitterness that doesn't linger. A bit of noticeable malt in the background to help balance things out a bit. A very good IIPA and reasonably priced. Too bad its only a seasonal."
"I remember this beer tasting more catty last year. I enjoyed it then, but this year's is more balanced while still delivering the bitter punch that I enjoy. Good, good stuff."
"More please, thank you."
"The taste is really sweet, a bit cloyingly so, very thick and syrupy. This is strong stuff. The hops have quite a bit of grapefruity tartness, orange burst, some oily and estery qualities too. The beer is very sweet and has lots of boozy pineapple flavors, boozy florals, tons of sweet malts, and candied sugars. There is a ton of ABV on the back end of this beer and it has a throaty burn for sure. The sweet ABV is there long after the finish. There may be some spicy yeast in the beer but it is hard to tell because the ABV just predominates on the back end. This beer may have just too much ABV and it isn't hidden all that well. It's good, but it is really strong."
"Pours amber to a tad red orange in the pint glass,this smell is almost a grapefruit in a glass,strong floral grapefruit hops almost a mango tropical feel,lets ya know whats coming,the hops balance the sweetness in a near perfect combo,This DIPA is real easy to drink"
"Not bad at all. A fairly standard DIPA. Certainly enjoyable, and worth a try (especially for those that are hop heads). It is just not my favorite of the style or brewery."
"Flavor is pretty complex for an IPA. Bitey(hops), lots of citrus and carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Bitter and sweet. Bitter at first taste, and finishes on the sweeter side and dry. Very good Imperial IPA."
"The mouthfeel is both sticky and oily, and the beer coats my mouth and tongue the way a DIPA should. Medium to full bodied with proper carbonation. A very good effort by Founders."
"D: Double Trouble is a beer you can drink as fast as you want, I suppose, but isn't a chugger. It's just far too harsh and strong, and a tongue bruiser. I love Founder's and want to like this more, but it's just a little extreme, even for the style. I think that they could dial down the IBUs a bit and bring in some more subtle maltiness and it would be equal to Hop Slam in many ways."
"Overall, a nice DIPA. Coming from Founders, however, I was expecting a little bit more. It's definitely a great DIPA, but from a world class brewery such as Founders, I was expecting just a little bit more."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Luckily...."
"overall another solid brew from the folks at founders.."
"D: Really easy to drink but two would be plenty"
"Drinkability: What a great beer. Thanks to Founders for selling this in 12 oz bottles for $10 a four pack instead of $10 for a corked, foiled 22."
"D- Although the booze is slightly noticeable (something I rarely note in a DIPA), it is deceptively drinkable for a 9.4% brew. I could definitely have a few of these. The intense bitterness that lingers on the back of the palate in the form of grapefruit peel does make it slightly slower drinking."
"Overall, pretty solid. Lots of hops, but not overwhelming. I'd buy it again, for sure."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a large white head that had great retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Huge pungent hop aroma. Mostly grapefruit but there is also other citrus fruits involved such as oranges and apricots. The flavor is one dimensional. More grapefruit and citrus flavors. Very high bitterness even at the proclaimed 86 IBUs. Alcohol is the only other flavor other than hops. Has a good body and carbonation but it can only do so much against the harshness of the hops. This beer is a poster child for palate fatigue. The high alcohol does not help either. Hopheads only need apply."
"This west coast-style Michigan DIPA is a real treat. Golden in color, with some haze. The head is white as snow, with nice retention and lacing. Aromas consist of grapefruit, flowers, and pineapple. The hops dominate all of the malt on the nose. The flavors that come from this brew are amazing. Grapefruit, pineapple, and fresh greens are dominant, but there is a nice malt profile on the finish. Mouthfeel is amazing. Medium bodied and has an extremely long finish. One cannot even tell that this beer has a high ABV. One of the most drinkable DIPAs I have ever tasted. Cheers to Founders on this one!"
"Very drinkable, alcohol is detectable though coming in at 9.4%. One of the best IIPAs out there, absolutely delicious."
"Overall, this one is a creeper. The almost 10% could go to work on you easily if your not careful, heavy flavors and high ABV would make this hard to run a marathon with, but that's exactly what I wanted out of this brew."
"Drinkability:This was a very tasty DIPA. Just the style I prefer. Nice and balanced. Not too biting of hops but enough to justify the style it claims to be. I could through back 2-3 of these at most and be thoroughly pleased."
"D= Great beer. Been waiting to try this one since Founders started to distribute to MN. Great beer. I'll prolly be coming back to it again. Really nice juicy hop taste without being overly bitter. Great beer."
"Drinkability: Excellent hop-forward DIPA. However, there are a lot of similarities between this beer and Founders Harvest Ale (which is fresher) and Red's Rye (which is more complex)."
"Drinkability: It has taken me a while to get it down, about two periods of hockey. The bitterness is a bit too much for me to drink it easily. It's a 9.4% DIPA after all, but I usually get them down easier than this."
"A solid IIPA. Not as earth-shattering to this palate as to others it seems. It's good, I'll have to try a fresher bottle sometime to see if the hops have died down significantly."
"There is still plenty of body and depth to this beer after 10 months. I bet this is a beast when fresh. I'll have to pick up some more next spring. Thanks for the opportunity, Kevin."
"Drinkability - Pretty good considering this is a DIPA. I wouldn't want to have to many in one sitting but overall, this is a good beer."
"D-Good drinkability for a 9.5 ABV DIPA"
"12 oz. bottle served in a snifter. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a decent frothy off-white head, lacing throughout. Aroma is caramel malts, fruit, grass, peaches, a hint of alcohol, grapefruit, and citrus hops. Flavor is sweet malt, wood, pine, resin, and grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, a bit boozy, and a lot of bitterness that sticks around for a while. Pretty damn good DIPA, could use just a touch more of a malt backbone."
"OVERALL: This is a very bitter DIPA, even more so than others in the style. The bottle says 86 IBU's, but it tastes like heaps more. No malt, just bitter hops here. This one was enjoyable and surprisingly drinkable at the beginning, though the high bitterness made it tougher as the glass emptied. I enjoyed it, but would definitely have to stop at one. If you like huge bitterness in your DIPA's, this is your bag."
"Drinkability: I would have this again but on another night and would recommend this to those who seek a simple ale with a few hop profiles and a bittering finish"
"I don't have to tell you that this yet another great and must try Founders beer. Well, it's a must try beer if you like well made bitter and tart craft beers. Even if you can't find this beer on tap, it's just as good in bottles."
"Where this beer shines is it's absolute enjoyability and ease of drinking. You don't focus on the intricacies, you just enjoy it. When I have a hopslam or a gueuze or a perfect RIS, my eyes light up. This doesn't happen here, but it is a great beer."
"Feel and Drinkability: Medium-light with just enough carbonation so that it doesn't interfere with the rest of the beer. This is one thats easy to drink, and definitely enjoyable. Alcohol is apparent and creates a warming sensation. Finish is semi-dry, the flavors going on lead you in direction but then the actual finish isn't all that dry. I'll definitely come back to it, its up there with some of my favorite DIPAs. Its one that I'd recommend, and I'll enjoy the rest of the four-pack. But for me there still is nothing quite like Hopslam. $9.99 for a four pack is fair, and worth it. I'll be checking out more DIPAs but this one so far ranks as very good, nothing godly or heavenly but I'll say that its holy."
"2010 Janurary - Picked up a 4 pk that was bottled Dec 31/09. Very smooth and easy drinking beer, considering the higher alc %."
"Overall impression: Wow! A big, easily drinkable double IPA. I can't detect any alcohol so this would definitely sneak up on you. A hop lovers dream but the drinkability is amazing. Nice job Founders!"
"This is often compared to its competitor Bell's and their Hopslam, but there's no comparison in my opinion. Still, a good take on the style and worth the price of admission."
"D - Easy to drink for a stronger beer. More bold than fascinating but an enjoyable drink."
"D: An above average dIPA from Michigan, but not even the best IPA from Founders"
"This is my first beer from Founders and is one of the best beers I've had. I wish they were more widely available. This is a very good double IPA. I think more than one might be hop overload, but the one is completely delicious. I look forward to the other two Founders beers I bought."
"Overall- this is one amazing double ipa. i'm glad i chose this over the trusted 90 min. from dogfish i've had before. if you're a fan of ipa's and you have an opportunity to grab this one i say do it. KAPAISCH!!@$"
"Overall, a really good beer from Founders. I've been waiting for a DIPA from Founders and they put out a good one."
"Overall - An excellent and very well balanced DIPA... recommended..."
"Definitely not typical, and definitely not as insane as expected, this is one of the most drinkable IPAs I've ever had, and one of the most balanced as well. Be sure to give it a chance and contemplate it carefully before passing judgment. Thanks to super-cool BA kels for the assist!"
"Drink is good does not taste like a 9.4% ABV.More juicer than I expected."
"This is a really bitter Imperial IPA. Reminds me of Ruination to a certain extent, with its strong citrus and grapefruit flavors. But, it's a little more sweet. After taste is damn bitter. You can definitely taste the alcohol as well. Hop flavor is distinctively woody and spicy in addition to the citrus notes. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with nice medium-low carbonation. For nine and a half percent, this beer goes down very smoothly. One of the better double IPAs out there."
"Pours a brassy gold with tiny bubbles of carbonation that maintain a bone white head. Plenty of pine and citrus hop aroma, along with some sweet malt and creamy banana. A lovely perfume. Those translate pretty well to the flavor, but i am less impressed because of the apparent alcohol. Pine, citrus, and tropical fruit flavors are enjoyable along with bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Sweet flavors never become cloying, but at 9.4% and a full body, drinkability is limited. A good DIPA--you can certainly do worse."
"Drinkability suffers a bit because of the intense bitter and alcoholic finish that lingers well into a minute after a swallow. For hopheads, though, this is an original take on the style."
"a good DIPA, though the malt side of things could be a little less sweet and more robust. just because we are hoploading this one doesn't mean the malts can't have a nice character independently. not to mention that the hops bring plenty of sweetness of their own"
"Drinkability- Not in the top tier of DIPA's, but a nice flavorful brew that could be considered sessionable for it's easy drinking ability."
"Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy orange with a half inch, bright white head that quickly dissipates into a soapy skim, several clusters of ringlets and a thin band around the edges. Some spots and specks of grouped lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose is grapefruit - some sweetness and some piny hops, as well as an earthy quality and a hint of booze in the mix. Taste follows nose, but somewhat muted - nothing really stands out on this one in terms of the grapefruit sweetness or the hops; somewhat subdued. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with minimal carbonation and also slightly oily on the tongue. Decent DIPA, but didn't blow me away - nothing really popped on this; however, this feature does enhance drinkability - not to mention an extremely well-hidden abv at 9.4%."
"A- is the perfect grade for this one. Well done, community."
"This is a decent DIPA, and I would drink it again, but (here comes my regionally elitist moment) it ain't got squat on some of our West Coast DIPAs (e.g., Pliny the Elder, Yulesmith, Ruination). So I reach for one of those before this."
"This beer does not jump right up in punch you in the mouth it seems to slide into your taste buds before pronouncing it's bitterness. It goes down easy and it pretty crisp."
"Quite drinkable, although the alcohol reminds you that this is a sipper."
"Huge thanks to whoever left this at my place!"
"Nice change of pace. IBU's aren't through the roof and this beer is not in-your-face like all its DIPA counterparts."
"Super flavor-packed, apricot, grapefruit, that cooked bitter orange, in a smooth,silky, somewhat sticky brew....the sweetness perfectly balances the extra hoopy bitterness so that the bittreness is purely enjoyable and the flavors can really be appreciated. Alcohol amazingly well-hidden. This is how a DIPA shoul be mde--too often the hoppiness is too aggressive and unbalanced. Excellent."
"Founders hopsey-piney, grapefruity,spicy, and flowery IPA isn't too bad for an IPA...maybe the Double IPA helps. Nose distinctly of grapefruit, brings to mind a fresh and quenching beer, just light enough for the summer heat. Not being one to appreciate a hoppy beew, I can tolerate this one, and may have a few more before the summer's over."
"Founders makes great malty stouts and that is what they are known for. Even their DIPA was quite malty; I guess that's not what I'm looking for in this style of beer."
"This is one of the most drinkable DIPA's i have ever drank it goes down alot smoother than most and might even be a good one for people to come from bigger standards to doubles"
"This is one of the best designed beer bottles I've seen thus far. They have some great artwork. The beer pours a bright orange with a head that quickly fades. The smell is slightly astringent but mostly a blast of sweet hops. The taste has great balance for a DIPA with just enough bitterness (86 IBUs) and citrus tart to go along with the sweet malty flavors. This is a very drinkable beer, I just wish it was a little more complex."
"12 ounce bottle- pours a hazy mandarin orange, minimal white head with some sticky lacing. Sweet fruity hops, caramel. Taste- prickly blast of hops, pine, grapefruit rinds.Solid malt backbone- cookie dough, caramel. Medium to high carbonation, and finishes dry. Alcohol is hidden quite well. Very drinkable. Would like to try a fresh sample of this as age of bottle unknown."
"Mouthfeel - I continue to be impressed - a smooth and creamy texture while still refreshingly watery until the dry hoppy finish. Nice medium-low carbonation to keep it smooth. A little sugary residue on the lips afterward."
"D - Moderate, good for a big IPA."
"D) Decent. I was hoping to be """wow'd""" but not - oh well."
"[Re-aged]"
"D: With such a high ABV this would not be a beer you could have more than 3 or 4 of. Very drinkable with a nice spicy food, but not a sessionable beer for sure."
"This is one heckuva DIPA, maybe a bit better than Dark Horse Double Crooked Tree IPA although not as outstanding as Three Floyd's Dreadnaught, I'd love to have one of these each day to keep the doctor away ... or maybe to invite the doc over for a brew."
"Recommended ++"
"D: Fantastic brew, Founders just keeps on churning out hit after hit. This was my first venture outside of the Stouts/ Porters and their width of quality is as impressive as their depth. This was a pretty smooth drinker for a brew of this size, a real treat to be sure. A must try for all beer lovers, a truly high amazing brew!"
"D - This is a simply outstanding double IPA that is wildly complex and well built, but drinks like a standard IPA in that the alcohol is well hidden, and the body is not flabby or overly thick. Another wonderfully hoppy brew from one of my favorite breweries!"
"-Bye"
"absolutely drinkable. I enjoyed this beer. the first founders offering I've tried."
"Poured a a light bronze color with a lasting white head. Nose is grapefruit,orange peel riding on a big malty backbone.Taste is strong on citrus with floral notes. Alcohol blends in nicely with this for 9.4 ABV. Mouthfeel is not as hoppy as some but tasty and amore complex IIPA all the way aroud due to the great malt and balance."
"A cloudy orange that settled into a clear orange. Small head even with an aggressive pour. Aroma was citrus with a high alcohol smell after it warmed. Taste was hoppy bitter and grapefruit. Too bitter for me straight out of the fridge, but it warmed up nicely at room temperature, removing excessive bitter. Not bad at all. The feel is oily and drinkability is OK."
"-not too drinkable for me. i was hoping for a bit more from this fella. gonna say i was a little disapointed"
"D - this was an okay DIPA. Not very well balanced, but the hops were quite delicious. I like Devil Dancer better from this brewery, but this was enjoyable none-the-less..."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow-orange color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing that sticks around. The aroma is citrus, lemon, cream soda (which actually adds a lot to the beer...weird), and pale malt. This is a very unique aroma, and not like any DIPA I've yet experienced. It does smell hoppy, but there is much more going on. The taste is slightly hoppier than the aroma, and there is a firm bitterness in the sip and more so in the aftertaste. The lemon and cream soda are still there, but they are much less prominent. This beer has a nice , but it doesn't intrigue me the way the aroma does. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture, and a lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good DIPA. I've come to the point where I almost view reviewing DIPAs to be a chore, because so many of them taste nearly the same. This beer has more depth in the malt bill which adds depth to the entire beer. This beer is a true winner."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a yellow color with a not much head and a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is sweet malt, earth tones, no hop character in the nose. Taste is pretty explosive with a sweet taste of candy up front and a hop explosion towards the back end. this has a oily hop taste on the finish that sticks to your palate for hours. Overall the look and smell of this was a let down but the exlosive hop profile on the finish was a nice touch, more sweet on the front end. I want to be fair, I am not sure how old this bottle was and this could be better if it was fresh."
"Overall, a good IPA, but not particularly balanced. That's OK with me!!"
"Drinkability: For a DIPA this is a dangerously drinkable beer. It would be easy to have too much of this high ABV potion and then have the alcohol sneak up and surprise you. However, this is definitely a keeper and a beer to return to when one has a chance."
"Pours a hazy light golden orange color with a full finger tight foamy white head that fades slowly leaving sheets of 3D Belgian lacing. I'm totally loving the complexity and uniqueness of the smell; bright sweet melon, tangerine and honey. The mouth feel is adequately carbonated, tangy and smooth...a gateway to the full sweet and citrus flavors. This is one classic Double IPA...and a very easy drinker. Oh! Its 9.4% ABV...that's what kicked my butt. Too much karma in Founders' town once again. That's it... I'm moving!!! Many thanks to infestaxion for this opportunity!"
"D - Very drinkable and enjoyable the ABV is almost too well hidden"
"Bone white half finger head of mainly microfoam with a few oddly placed huge bubbles, above average lacing in thin sheets. Solid murk lends translucency to the light orange to yellow colored liquid, traps the light to increase luminescence. Somewhat high-toned nose, zips through there without much thought on sitting for a spell, pine needle and grass sourness and then more slightly bitter tea leaf scents hit you first, honestly the first few sniffs you miss the caramel and butterscotch notes, mandarin orange to white grapefruit citrus also has your nostrils on edge, as it starts to dissolve the peach, apricot scents almost an afterthought. Full-bodied, dense and doesn't get more than an inch or so into the mouth before sinking in fully. The carbonation may be too fine to cajole things back into motion. Some bitters but mostly grass, green hay and pine bark next to sour grapefruit pith. As in the nose, the caramel and malts in general too little, too late. Sweetest part is the apricot, peach, guava fruit, adds some residual sugar. More scone or muffin baked good qualities than breadiness. Very dry finish, overall the flavor intensity and weight last until the very end."
"Just a really amazingly complex tasty hop bomb brew with a decent drinkability for how much the alcohol shows through. This guy has a place in my fridge any day."
"Less than one week fresh DT smells and tastes very similar to Founders Fresh Hop Ale. A little more depth and body and maybe a little muted on the bitter hops, but pretty similar. I may actually prefer the lightly aged DT to fresh."
"This is a beer that I bought in April of 2009 and drank July of 2009. It's appearance in my sniffer glass was a brilliantly clear gold color. The head and lacing was white and minimal. The aroma was mainly dominated by hops. There was a pleasant hop-candy note and the typical citrus. Higher alcohol was also present in the aroma but not overly assertive. The flavor was dominated by an extremely assertive hop bitterness, which I expected. What I did not expect was the beer to be """hot", an out-of-balance alcohol flavor. This high phenolic character distracts from any subtle hop or yeast notes that are most likely there. Overall, this is a big beer in every department. Unfortunately, a possible oversight during fermentation caused it to be a little too big."
"D - For not being an IPA kinda guy, this beer amazes me. I'd take this over any IPA if given the choice, but would have to switch to a Centennial IPA after a few to prevent from going crazy."
"Overall, this is a pretty decant DIPA. I really can't taste the booze. My bottle is going fast and I could easily drink another. I am glad I now have access to this."
"Pours a bright golden orange with a modest, fine foam. Nose is HUGE of big citrus hops, among some of the most I've ever experienced. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, although shy of syrupy--any more so and I think it would be a bit much (but it's not). Big bodied, and big citrus flavor with hints of pine, spice, but tons of grapefruit. Very bitter finish in a really happy way. BIG double IPA but super drinkable as far as such a big double IPA can be. This is a really awesome beer. Go Michigan brew!"
"Edit: a month later? Wow. This is awesome. All kinds of noble hops going on in there. Gets better as it ages (a little) 'cause it loses the NW hopness. This is awesome. I could love it."
" ~ I've said it once and I'll say it again, """this is the most complex IPA I've ever had.""" Thank you Founder's."
"Hazy pale straw color. Light carbonation with small bubbles that form a tight white rim on the glass. Nice floral, citrus, zesty, grassy/herbal aroma. Hop flavor is strong and complex but balanced with the malt backbone of this beer. Clean malty flavor with good hop flavor and bitterness as expected in a 2xIPA. Noticed hop flavors include grapefruit, citrus and pine. Medium light to medium body that finishes dry with a nice malty sweet and herbal lingering bitterness. Not a harsh beer - rather an intensely hoppy, very strong pale. Nice beer."

"My personal preferences in double IPAs lean towards the unbalanced ones. I love hop overloads, specifically grapefruit flavor overloads. Founders Double Trouble gives me that. I'll be picking up some more, for sure."
"Bottle courtesy bulletrain76. Pours hazy orange-goldenrod with a filmy white head. Literally smells like freshly poured grapefruit juice. I can't pick out any other notes, just Welch's grapefruit juice. Flavor is similar but with some orange juice notes too. Finish is slightly resinous and herbal, with only a modest tinge of bitterness. Dry on the palate with no trace of the big alcohol content."
"D: Alcohol hides a little. Overall simple and straightforward, but great and very drinkable."
"D- A beautiful beer and well balanced. I'm not sure I'm in love with the flavors that are presented but I'd give it another try if I had another to drink. Ah, for my next trip to Michigan..."
"It's hard to believe this beer is 9.4% ABV. It's pretty oily, yet feels light in body, and has pretty vibrant carbonation. Somehow it's even refreshing! I had trouble enjoying this slowly, no alcohol burn at all and just flat out delicious. Easily one of the most surprising beers I've had this year. Hard to believe it's sitting at an A- as I write this review."
"I'm going to be pretty sad when this stuff is all gone. Hopefully, we'll see it next year."
"D - alcohol gradually creeps into the aftertaste as the beer warms, however, it is never however overpowering or hot, really starting to enjoy these founders beers"
"Taste: It has a bitterness to it that almost has a toasted grassy taste too it. Not as strong as I would expect but to me it is just the right amount of bitterness. Even with the high ABV the there is no alcohol taste to it which sometimes there is a hint of."
"A vigorous pour only achieves an inch of head. it is a foamy off white and has decent retention and some lace. Body is a golden orange straw color leaning slightly towards a amber tone. Nose is vibrantly hoppy with noticeable citrus tones and some back round prickly grassy notes. A mix of sappy and citrusy hops enter the mouth and are thick on the tongue. Very marmalade like with more of an edge to rind on the citrus profile. Really silky and mineral based, maybe a bit oily on the back of the tongue. Bitterness turns more piney and thick as you continue to drink. Mouthfeel falls right in line with this. Alcohol is very well hidden. A damn fine drinkable double IPA."
"Pours a really light orange, golden color with a one finger white head. The head has pretty good retention and plenty of lacing is left down the sides of the glass. Smell is great, hops, grapefruit, sweet, and both citrus and pine. Taste is really good. Not bitter at all and there is a pretty good taste of grapefruit, followed by some pine as well. Pretty hoppy and finishes smooth. Kind of a high ABV but it's not noticeable at all in the taste, making this one very drinkable. Overall a pretty solid IPA but I was pretty sure it would be coming from Founders. I'll be looking to pick this one up again."
"Overall a delicious, tasty beer."
"D - More piney and dry than many DIPA's, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Kindof one-dimensional though. Decent alcohol content. The flavor doesn't get too old after 12 oz, but a bomber might be a chore to finish."
"Pours is a dirty gold with amber hues and a big foamy white IPA head that sticks and laces the glass. Hops smack you in the face, grapefruit reigns with some other citrus thrown in with lots of leafy hop oils giving this brew a very fresh aroma. Taste hits the DIPA barrier, thick and hoppy, a heavy bitterness coating the tongue. Grapefruit is again the dominant flavor. Great stuff, reminds me of 90 minute."
"overall, this was a great brew i really enjoyed"
"Saw this one sitting on the shelf at the local beer store... I quickly scooped it up because I love Founders and anything Michigan I can find now that I'm stuck in central IL aka the beer void of America. Cool looking label also. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep cloudy yellow color with a slight orange tinge and a HUGE frothy head that sticks around all day. The smell is a huge hit of hops; spicey, citrusy, piney and resinous. There is also a sweet malty backdrop that complements the hops nicely. No solventy alcohol smells. That is one excellent smelling DIPA. The taste only confirms what I thought about the smell, hop bomb but not in an overly bitter, mouth puckering way. All the flavor is there but it lacks that sharp bitterness that turns some people off from huge hoppy beers like this one. The citrusy, piney hops are nicely balanced with a solid backing of slightly sweet maltiness. There is only a hint of alcohol in the finish in a warming characteristic but I would never guess this rings in at 9.4%. The mouthfeel is full bodied and has a velvety smooth carbonation, almost like a nitro tap. Drinkability, considering the high ABV and IBUs is huge. I would drink this all the time if that was an option. I really like Founders in general, but I think this may be my new favorite. Spectacular beer, if you can get your hands on it... buy it!!"
"D- This beer could definately get me in trouble, or any other hophead out there. Like I said before, very drinkable with no alcohol taste... CHEERS!"
"Cheers!"
"Great stuff."
"The beer was surprisingly well carbonated (this was my first growler trade, didn't know what to expect). The bitterness was spot on for the style and I really like a double IPA with a dry finish. The high abv is well hidden and the beer is delicious, something I am definitely going to revisit in the future."
"Final Thought: Great start, solid finish; a well crafted Imperial IPA!"
"Light-ish carbonation for an IPA but it goes down smoothly - let's do this again!"
"Drinkability is good. High abv means 2 12 oz'ers would be about max. I would enjoy 2 of these. Very nice!!! Glad we have Founders in Virginia now!!"
"(D)- At 9.4%, this is a heavy hitter for sure! However, it has an awesome dry, yet refreshing and sweet combination that is balanced really well! A superb example why IPAs / DIPAs are one of my more favorite summer beers currently."
"A: Heavy gold with hint of ruby, thin layer of spider web-like head, a few patches of foam clinging to the sides of the glass - 4.25, S: Lots of citrus, tropical fruit and some bubblegum, based on a recent tasting involving Amarillo I'm guessing they are part of the build - 4.50, T: Sharp hop bite, on the side of earthy, malt is present but can't stand up to the huge hop flavor, pine sap, alcohol is noticeable but not prohibitive - 4.25, M: Slightly chewy, medium to heavy body - 4.50, D: This is a mammoth of a beer and perfect for sipping - 4.00"
"This one absolutely fries your taste buds. One of the most massively hoppy ales I've encountered in many months. Similar to Bells HopSlam, maybe better."
"D - This is a drinkable weighing in at 9.4%...a very solid IIPA...Founders does it again"
"D - Yup - one will do it for ya, however!"
"D - I could see myself drinking this one till it hurt."
"D - Very easy to drink more than one, but watch out because they sneak up on you fast."
"Drinkability: Quite a good DIPA. Not the greatest ever, ends up a bit one-note, but not bad at all."
"D - This is an outstanding DIPA. It was really easy-drinking and I almost didn't notice the potency of this brew."
"Probably one of the more drinkable DIPA's, IMO. The alcohol is well-hidden. Although the malts don't shine, they do manage to keep the hops reigned in a little bit. It's still out-of-balance, but not overly so."
"Drinkability: Sipper - nice balanced - hint of pinot noir like tannins on this one. I highly recommend. Great Doulbe IPA"
"Certainly worth trying - not quite a Pliny, Racer5 or a Gordon, but a worthwhile IIPA nonetheless."
"Drinkability? The big abv is, what can I say but....very well hidden indeed! Dangerously drinkable so I'm glad I can't get this locally or I'd be in <see name of beer>. Ok, I tell a lie, it would be awesome to have this beer at my beck and call. This is damned delicious and I thank you hugely, John!"
"Given the other ratings, I gave this a second chance a few hours later. What to do with the other two?"
":-)"
"Good, somewhat hazy, pale orange in color. Nice sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Mildly metallic smelling. Definate piney/grapefruity presence. Big hop blast up front. Resiny and sticky sweetnees to it. A tad solvent like-more alcohol then from the hops. Good body. A good beer overall but lacks something to really make it great. Worth a shot for hop heads out there."
"For hop fans, you've got to go get this one!"
"Thanks for finally coming to Minnesota!"
"D- Very drinkable, I was surprised to see it was 9% this brew will sneek up one you. Overall a good Imp IPA but not the best any means."
"The color and flavor of Double Trouble are weak; however, it more than makes up for those weaknesses with aggressive bitterness perfectly balanced by sweetness making this a refreshing warm weather IIPA."
"this beer was as good as expected."
"Good beer for hop enthusiast, not for everyone though."
"I ordered this beer on tap last night. It was served in a tulip-shaped glass. It was golden yellow with no head. I blame that on the serever. It was opaque and hazy and easy on the nose. It smelled sweet and grapefruity and really piney. It tasted like bitter pine cone and lime with quite a bit of alcohol warmth. I recall a moderately thick and sweet texture, but not syrupy. It didn't go down to easily. It was a good beer but I only ordered one. It went well with my raw oysters."
"D - This is a really good IIPA that I recommend. Cheers!"
"Pours an almost lager pale yellow with a thin, vibrantly white head. Definitely looks different to this DIPA fan. The smell is a pungent citrus hop aroma, and nothing else but a faint alcohol smell (at 9.4%, I guess that explains it). A very crisp and bitter taste, I like DIPAs, but this one is a lip puckering bitter. I'd almost say I need a bit more malt backbone to balance that out. Still very light, and nice in the mouth, but a bit dry in the after taste. I like this beer, its light and crisp for something so heavy in ABV, but maybe too light for the style. I like a bit more sweetness to add to the citrusy hop flavor. Certainly, deceptively easy to drink for how big it is."
"Drinkability: A big one, yes, but one that is highly drinkable and comes recommended. Another winner from Founders."
"Had this one on-tap at Pizza Plant in Williamsville. Served in a goblet. Somewhat hazy yellow/orange with a thin white head. Heavy pine aroma. Sharp crisp flavor with a mellow maltiness in the middle and a slightly sweet finish. Again, pine and some citrus. Somewhat thick, chewy mouthfeel. Not sure how many of these I could drink with it pushing 10%, but it certainly is tasty! If you enjoy hops, seek this one out."
"Found this one on-tap at Raleigh Times, served in a Raleigh Times tulip a crisp light orange with a frothy eggshell head that's slow to diminish and leaves great lacing. The aroma is a nice amount of citrus hops with a hint of sweet malts. The taste is an interesting balance of citrus hops and sweet malts with a great bitter finish. The beer is slightly heavy but maintains a nice smoothness, especially as it warms. This one was enjoyable on-tap, but I prefer it from a bottle."
"D- Sharp hop bitterness makes this not the smoothest DIPA however its a great representation of this style. Hop heads will love this. Could use a toning down on the bitterness."
"Drinks fairly easy, but you're well aware you are imbibing in a serious DIPA here. Well done Founders, I sure hope I see in my neck of the woods soon ( since Founders is planning on Mizzou distribution soon ) !!"
"A deep golden color with touches of amber along the sides of the glass. A two inch high head forms on top, cream in color and laces slowly, as well as clinging to the glass. Pine and citrus strike the nose with a strong, intense scent, with a grassy and earthy fragrances at the end of the aroma. Mild malty flavor, with cracked and bread start out each taste. The hops soon take over, with a citric, grapefruit flavor, along with the sweetness of pineapple, it finishes with grassy and earthy flavors. A very consistent feel, medium bodied all the way through, it finishes with mild dryness on the back of palate. An easy to drink beer, strong flavor, intense aroma and a smooth feel that make wanting this beer on a daily basis."
"D- I could definitely have more than one of these. It is easy to drink, and tastes fine, but is overall nothing too special."
"An interesting example of the style that is drinkable and full of hops. What can't Founders do that won't impress? Check it out."
"D - Not the most drinkable DIpa, but certainly delivers the hops in an extreme way no question. It goes big or goes home. A great IIPA just very tasty and fits the west coast style well."
"Pours a solid gold color with swirls of yellow clouds swiming threw the beer. The color I enjoyed very much for a Double PA. Beer has enough power in it to form a great head and leave an insane amount of lace around the glass. Lace left on the glass looks like decoration as it covers the entire glass once finished. Smell is of floral citrusy notes and a bit of malt. Taste is very citrusy hops coming threw with it's partner being floral flavors. This was a nice change of pace, as allot of IPA's have malt flavor very strong. This particular beer for me had the mallt relaxing in the back ground. The amount of Carbonation I felt was apporpriate to bring out the flavors of the brew. The drinkability is lovely as this brew will make you feel like it can be a session beer...This has become a must have int he fridge when fresh."
"Drinkability: Looking for a hop fix? Look no further. Founders Double Trouble will easily match any west coast hop-bomb. When it comes to complexity, however, well... not so much. This beer knows what is and knows what it's not. That said, I can't wait for another."
"D - This beer begins with a lot of potential, great hop aroma and initial hop flavor, but the harsh bitterness ruins it for me. It has very nice hop aroma that is almost on the level of Hopslam, but the acrid bitterness reminds me of Ruination. There is a lot of malt in there trying to balance the beer, but the heavy handed bitterness all but obliterates any sweetness. If you like extreme, harshly bitter beers, this might be nice, but I prefer hop character and for me the excessive bitterness makes this an unbalanced beer that I will not drink again."
"Note - Quite arguably my favorite label in all of beerdom..."
"For a DIPA this sure hits the spot."
"CHEERS!!!!"
"D- Very drinkable, nice a light for such a big beer."
"Definite citrus and pine going on in both the smell and the taste. There is a sweetness going on that is balanced out by the hops so it is just right for my palette. Lots of body with this beer as well. It grabs your tongue but no aftertaste. Also, not big alcohol flavor that you get with some of the high ABV beers, which makes this highly drinkable. Nice!"
"I've been on a bit of a reviewing slump as of late. Alot of duds and disappointments. This makes up for that and gets me back on track!"
"D - Looking over the grapefruit I think this is very very drinkable. So much so that even though the grapefruit turned me off I could have done another."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Piney nose. Flavor is sweet, grapefruit and pine. Barely a lingering grapefruit aftertaste. High ABV is hidden. Decent DIPA. $3.70 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Better tasting IPA's at lower cost=me not drinking this again."
"Notes: Founders demonstrates its master craftsmen status again."
"The taste was much sweeter than I previously remembered, but it balances very well with the still impressive hop profile. Strong sweetness when it first hits the tongue, again caramel, followed by strong citric punch of hops. Leaves the mouth high and dry. Nice weight on the beer, quite heavy feeling for a DIPA, nice and sticky also. This is extremely drinkable for 9%. Alcohol is hidden well and it all goes down smooth."
"Drinkability- Surprisingly light for a DIPA of nearly 10% ABV."
"Don't have too much to say about this one, but it's still a solid DIPA. For the style, the drinkability is pretty high, and the alcohol can sneak up on you. Recommended."
"10/12/10 - over the last two days I've been sampling from a four pack buried in the back of the beer fridge since Easter, and they held up perfectly."
"D - A different and enjoyable take on the DIPA. Well done."
"A really nice beer, not the most complex DIPA out there, but fun to drink and enjoy - you can easily have several of these in one sit."
"D. This one drinks slow, and the alcohal is a bit hot. Still pretty good, but for some reason I liked the Centennial IPA more. True to the style though."
"A good beer. Not sure I like it more than the Centennial IPA they offer, but that's me. The hops are nicely complemented by the sweet malt in the beer but not too much overpower what should be the focus of any good DIPA...the hops."
"Overall, a nice crisp Double IPA with nice citrus and pine notes. A clean, refreshing beer."
"D: Its not bad at all. The drinkability is pretty good for a DIPA. Goes down pretty easy and doesn't sit too heavy. The teeth hop ache is a bit much at times, but it is manageable. This does remind more of a West Coast DIPA from a none west coast brewery. It works and gets the job done. Glad I had the chance."
"D: I docked this some points for lacking complexity, but the flavorful nature of this beer gets some points here... nice to see on tap at the Institute"
"I would probably drink the entire four-pack (why four pack? ask Founders about this) save for the abv. It's a sneaky alcohol presence for sure... I guess that's where the trouble is! Fantastic beer. One of my favorite DIPAs or IPAs."
"D: Very, very solid all around. Not quite as good as HopSlam, but this one has got most DIPA's solidly beaten."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor is decent which makes for an enjoyable beer. The alcohol, though well hidden, is on the high side which will certainly limit the beer some. Appropriate for the style nonetheless. Definitely a solid offering."
"D: I can't put away many of any double IPA, and it's the same for this one - it's clearly high quality but the sour aspects keeps me from wanting more."
"D: Pretty drinkable."
"D- High ABV, big DIPA, so a little tough to try to session. 1st bottle or 2 go down great though."
"D: High alcohol hurts like in all DIPAs, but the sweetness does get near-cloying as the brew goes on. That said, this is a good DIPA with a great aroma profile."
"Clear golden. Thin dusting of dirty white froth. Bubbly collar leaves moderate amounts of lace. Very nice aroma of hop cones and fresh citrus and lemon oils. Nice combination on the palate of hop flavor and bitterness. The pendulum swings more toward the bitter properties than flavor, but it's really nice overall. Some juicy exotic fruit nuances. Malts purely balance. They don't add much flavorwise except a little biscuit maltiness. The alcohol is hidden fairly nicely for a 9.4% beer. This is solid."
"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGrandOleHopry1"
"D- A solid DIPA. Alcohol is a bit too present for me but it is 9.4% so I guess I should have known."
"Pretty drinkable considering the ABV. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, but for its warming effect. This is a solid IIPA, but is not knocking my socks off either. It may serve as a good introduction to the style, as it isnt too extreme. But as far as looks go this one is top notch. Ill likely be drinking this one again, especially considering at roughly 10 bucks a four pack it is reasonably priced."
"Founder's Double Trouble is their double india pale ale. It is extremely hoppy with a bitter citrousy after taste. The aroma is incredible and filled with fruits, ranging from bananas to pears. Overall, it is an incredible beer, but hard to finish. However, on a full stomach you'll be tanked after two, as this beer is 9%"
"Drinkability: Pretty solid beer. Would seek this out again and drink more."
"D - Somewhat drinkable, pretty high in alcohol content. Not hot, but not a session beer. Well balanced IIPA."
"This poured an opaque straw color with no head. It smelled like lemon and cultured yeast, with a bit of grapefruit. It tasted like lemon and orange hops, with bready yeast and a bit of honey and tea and grapefruit. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a pretty clean flavor, but it wasn't as tasty as I was hoping. I had this right after Maharaja, and it reminded me of when I tried Ruination immediately following HopSlam. The flavor ends up getting a lot more tea leafy, for some reason. I might have to try this again by itself. Body was nice, and alcohol was well hidden, so it was certainly easy to drink. I just imagined this would have been more crisp and delicious."
"Thanks Ben!"
"D: Great, another Founder's brew another homerun. When it comes to DIPA and Stout's these guys do very little wrong."
"D: This beer was nothing short of top notch. I taste the alcohol but I want to, its not only hops. A unique DIPA that is a nice change of pace. This foursome will go fast and I am eager to restock."
"Man, what a beer! The aroma is like sticking yer schnoz in a pile of pine branches. Great foamy, frothy, head and lots of lace. Color is a lovely shade of light amber. Flavor is very earthy chewy malt base with lots o hop. Great burps. Don't notice the alcohol till later. Nice hoppy and even a bit sweet finish. This beer is a work of (beer f)art."
"D: Stunning. Easily in my top 3 of DIPAs. Between this and Hopslam, Michigan might be the IPA capital of America."
"Served: in a standard US pint glass."
"It is full bodied despite the lite color for a DIPA and pretty easy to drink for 9.4%"
"a balanced beer, but nothing extraordinary here. good, not great flavors and the intangibles are meh."
"Pours hazed, lighter golden amber, light tan head, creamy and leaves spotty bits of fine lace. Grapefruit hops in the pungent nose. Fresh and enticing to my hop loving nostrils and palate. Grapefruit, and more grapefruit on the tongue, soft and sanguine. Here is a somehow slinky, and sophisticated yet all the while hop crushing DIPA. Enjoyed every sip of this one from the talanted brewers of Founders."
"A child's Willy Wonka ticket, a free pass to sessionable drinking, aroma seducing, abv inebriating, almighty DIPA. Clear in body and intent, the 9.4 shows like Hawaiin punch and the hops are as tropicana as can be. Looks like a 60 Min, hits like a rebel Ssips on pineapple steroids. Strong, clear, fruity, burning. Yum. Cute label."
"Overall: I like this one, I like it much more than I like the Centennial IPA. There is more of a shift toward a sweeter hop with a thankful absence of those rose flavors that you get in the Centennial. This one is rather enjoyable. It is what I would consider a nice Summer IPA."
"A very light clear gold color DIPA with a medium white head and good lacing. The aroma is a beautiful grapefruit hops with sweet orange bread, very enjoyable. The flavor brings on the obvious citrus hops, not over the top but solidly crisp bitterness in a medium bodied, smooth blend of bread pudding and apple pie. It is very drinkable yet there is a decided alcohol warmth that announces itself en route southward. Otherwise, this is a friendly, pleasant DIPA that does not pack as obvious a punch as many DIPA's yet satisfies the serious hop head palate. Very likable, surely recommendable, one I would buy again even though it's a tad pricey. Founders finds the mark again!"
"D - Not too shabby"
"All in all, I'm pretty impressed. Everything I've had from Founders has been either good or amazing, but for some reason, I wasn't expecting the same from a DIPA. wow, I was wrong. Definitely smooth and drinkable for a DIPA, this one is up there with the best of 'em. Definitely worth seekin' out. I'll have to find a few more."
"Drinkability: this beer goes down very easy despite the high alcohol. Great flavors and a few pints will hit you quickly."
"hazy burnt gold with an off white head that leaves nice lace but doesn't hold extremely well. nose is pineapple pineapple pineapple with a touch of sweet, fruity maltiness in the background as well as hints of toasted honey nut cheerios. considering the fact that this is a dipa, i find the balance to be extraordinary. the line is blurred between hop and malt, and i think that is exceptional. i didn't expect anything less from founders. i'm glad to see them branching out and producing at a level that makes their sweet sweet nectars available to those of us that used to have to go to great lengths to find them. nice body as well. on the lighter side of full. easy to drink, but not deceptively so. definitely a winner. maybe not the greatest dipa of all time, but worth a go in my opinion."
"D- Overall, pretty good Founder's product like usual. Since Hopslam is around 7 or 8 dollars more I would rather drink this and have a good DIPA."
"Another really fine beer from Founders."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty beige color ale with a medium size pure white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of citrus and bitter hops is dominating. Taste is dominated by the bitter hops with some citrus notes and some subtle floral notes also noticeable. Malt is also present and brings some refreshing sweetness to offset the hops presence. Body is full with good carbonation and no appearance of alcohol. Very well done and easily drinkable with great refreshing factor."
"easy to drink, especially with the mouthfeel like it is. it would be easy to down a few pints of this, but then the abv would no doubt rear it's head and make me feel quite the fool."
"Drinkability - not my favorite DIPA, but I'll be interested to see how the other one cellars."
"Hazy amber with a dense cream coloured cap. Great head retention with sheets of lace and rings indicating each sip. Intense aroma with lots of grapefruit rind, pine, fruity and floral notes. Medium to strong bitterness with fruity sweetness, plenty of grapefruit but less pine than in the aroma. Alcohol towards the end followed by lingering bitterness. Medium bodied with carbonation a bit on the low side. Very smooth with a creamy texture and alcohol warmth. Pretty good overall with a sharp hoppiness, but the alcohol was a bit forward."
"D - I could have a few of these in a session. Very enjoyable."
"This is certainly well-crafted, but is honestly a bit much for my taste. I prefer my DIPA's a bit less bitter. I'd prefer HopSlam, Centennial, or even fresh Two-Hearted to this."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable despite the high ABV. A few of these may get the best of you though."
"A fine beer, but a bit too heavy and present for something of it's ABV."
"If you like hops you'll love this beer. The alcohol notes brought the drinkablilty down a bit for me, but otherwise this is a tasty DIPA."
"Drinkability: A punchy, downright intense Double IPA that's in the same vein as Bell's HopSlam, though, and this is just me, I feel I'd prefer the Bell's just a tad over this one."
"D-Everyone wants to compare this to Hopslam and I was hoping this could compete....it doesn't....it's not that it isn't good because this is one of the better DIPA's I've had but it is not on the same level as the Slam...(.I did a blind taster of this, Torpedo, and Slam and it came in second behind Slam)....it has some similar characteristics of Slam but is not as assertive in the sweet citrus flavors....DT also does have a little more harsh bitterness on the finish too.."
"I knew I'd like this one. Very drinkable, very enjoyable, and very Founders."
"Once I got over the fact that this is a very different DIPA, I actually enjoyed the beer. It is very drinkable and packs a punch. I wouldn't say it would be the first DIPA I would pick up, it definitely stands out."
"For a DIPA it is very good!"
"Got this one on tap at Founders 4-8-09. This is the palest DIPA I have ever seen: a very clear light golden color with an off-white head. The nose contains a strong influence of floral hops, with citrus (especially grapefruit) and candied pineapple, as well. This is a beer that should definitely be enjoyed at around room temperature. I've tasted it cold and I've had it at the proper temperature, and it's really not fair to the beer to drink it cold. When it's warm, it's very easy to appreciate pine sap, tropical fruits, apricots, fresh tart apples and floral notes. All of these are very nice, but the candied pineapples are amazing. Caramel and toffee gain in prominence as it warms. The finish is nice and bitter; everything I was hoping for. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. This is a very drinkable, delicious DIPA. But did you expect any less from Founders?"
"Pours a very nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, some malts, with nice touch of citrus/pines. The taste is very nice/bitter/hoppy, little bit of malts thrown in, citrus/pines. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a nice hoppy/bitter DIPA."
"Perhaps a touch thin for most but I really like the thinness. Without the chewy maltiness, this is one big light colored DIPA."
"D- The alcohol heat and the bitterness of the hops really dominate this one. There is not enough hop flavor or aroma to support the bitterness and alcohol and the malt flavor is pretty hidden. I love big hops but not when the bitterness that dandelion pungent bitterness without flavor."
"bottle courtesy of kkulacki. Pours a dusky brown to orange with a nice half inch head. Laces slowly and stickily. Smells of hops, sweet grapefruit, alcohol. Big lupulin oil blast right up front. Tingling bitterness. Grapefruit and pineapple on a caramel malt base with obvious but complementary alcohol mingling with the bitterness. Bitterness lingers and alcohol warms. Full bodied for the style. Not syrupy, but close. A good IIPA, but personally I like them to feature the hop flavors, not the bitterness. Still, very excited to have gotten to try this. thanks, Konrad."
"D: The 9.4% ABV is shocking, as it really does not show... this isn't even really a case of being 'well-hidden' so much. It's more like there was nothing to hide. A little bit of an exaggeration, but it is very smooth and one that could easily be sipped at and repeated. Very good."
"D: Would drink this all the time but it costs a million dollars for a 4 pack. It's as simple as that. Highly drinkable - don't notice the fairly high ABV."
"."
"Drinkability: Sailors declare """pan pan""" not long before they cry """mayday mayday""" as the ship goes down. Be sure to have a steady, studied colleague keeping you in check as you imbibe this sneaky and irascible brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, even though I've had better 2IPA's this is still a really good beer to drink for a whole evening."
"D: Very easy to drink beer. For a DIPA, this might be just the right kind of beer to introduce to a hop virgin."
"It's rather surprising to see a 9.4% ABV. Very enjoyable and recommended. A winner."
"drinkability: if i wanted to completely destroy my palate for a few days i would drink a 4-pack or more. i'll judge the drinkability on that and the fact that i will definitely seek this one out next year. cheers, Founders. you've made me happy again"
"This is a lovely beer."
"Pours a hazy, maize color with a white head and lacing that lasts. The smell is wonderful - a little bit of sweet pine, with some grapefruit and generalized citrusy notes. The taste is superb - incredibly smooth from start to finish. Some mellow maltiness up front, followed by some passion fruit and lemon zest, and finshes crisp and slightly bitter. The alchohol is hidden well for the most part, a little bit of esters in the nose and warmth at the end of the taste. Another phenomenal offering from Founders - Well done!"
"D: Well, I certainly enjoyed this IPA, but 2 would be my max. A really solid IPA"
"My first beer from Founder's. Overall I thought it was a good DIPA. I would love to try it fresh from the tap. Given all of the choices of DIPAs that I have available to me, I would probably go with something else, but if offered, I would not pass this one up."
"Mmmmm...this is what Double IPA's are all about. Starts off sweet and viscous, with layers of boozy fruit draped all across the front & sides of the tongue. A nice malt presence smooths things out in the middle, right before a bitter onslaught of raw pine resin and leafy-green hop cones. A touch of mango and ethanol heat lingers after the bitterness fades. The body is thick, but not overly so, and the carbonation level and bitterness are on-point for the style. All in all, a delicious IIPA from the good folks at Founders, and a must-try for any Hop Head."
"I would strongly recommend this beer to anyone who loves hops."
"Overall: Certainly in my top 5 Imperial IPA so far. Highly complex and pleasantly drinkable. A truly wonderful discovery! Highly recommended."
"4 of these will be plenty as far as drinkability goes. Sometimes too much of a good thing is exactly that."
"Damn good offering from Founders. Now, I need to have this on draft."
"All in all, another solid American Double IPA. Not sure it is in the league of 90 Min, Hop Slam or some of the west coast powerhouses, but it is a great DIPA, that I would gladly drink whenever found. Well done Founders."
"EDIT: ok, I revisited this one and it is loads better this time around. The hops really pop here. They are loaded with both citrusy and piney flavors and make this a really terrific little brew. I like the heck out of it and I'm going to get more."
"This is a great double IPA. Great balances between the hoppiness and sweetness. Nice character to it. I will definitely return to this one."
"Taste is hoppy and piney right of the start. Aftertaste has a sharp hop bite. I do not get a lot of balance with hop and malt on this beer. Definitely heavier on the hop side. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected with a 9.4% ABV. I would never pass a this beer, but I am not going to seek it out."
"Perhaps a touch thin for most but I really like the thinness. Without the chewy maltiness, this is one perfect DIPA. Perhaps this and Pliny the Elder are tops in my book. Wonderful."
"Overall I find this to be a paramount of the style, a beer to set standards by, albeit a fairly high bar to hit."
"The alcohol isn't as bold as I would have expected for the abv. Nice touch."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack chalice. This beer pours a nectarine orange with a nice white fluffy head that leaves a decent amount of lace as it disappears from my glass. The aroma is a hop smack to the olfactory nerve. Huge notes of apricot and pink grapefruit. Just a slight hint of a malty sweetness. The flavor is just about the same. If you're looking for a DIPA that's malt bill lives up to the hop bill, this is not it. Huge notes of apricot, grapefruit, lemon zest with a blast of alcohol at the finish. There is also a almost medicinal bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is light with very little malt body. Also the hop flavor doesn't coat the mouth like it does in many DIPA's. To me this is more like boozy hop water then a DIPA. Give this beer some body and mellow out the alcohol burn and this beer could be fantastic."
"The color is a mix of straw and tea. Pretty clea and bright in color. The head starts at about one finger, and slowly recedes to nothing. Th aroma is a bitter orange zesty nectar with some gummi bear sweetness. The coarse, bitter hop citrus nectar hits the palate upfront. Some dry pilsner malts mix to cut some of the hop bitterness that evolves into somthing a little more resiny and smooth for the finish. This a a hop bomb sipper in my opinion. Well integrated 9.4% alcohol too."
"Pours nicely. Foggy yellow orange with a thick creme head that leaves a very thick lacing on the way down. Nose is tangy citrus with heavy pine tones. Flavor is extremely smooth. Extremely. There is still a bite of pine and hop tones with fairly strong bitter aftertastes and a slight salty thing in the back of my mouth. But like I said, it is really easy to swig this one down. Feel is smooth on liquid, carbonation is lower. I can dig this. A bit acidic and biting, but in the right ways."
"Pours a clear apple cider colored body with mountainous white head that left lace patches. A mix of hops with citric and heavy fruit smells (pear, grape) along with a strong malt base. The hop taste is pretty strong in this beer, as it hops piney citric flavors and some grapefruit. Overall, medium-bodied and slightly smooth with some chewey, malty breadiness in there for a slightly sweet sensation. Finishes dry thanks to some herbal hop bitterness. A clean and refreshing DIPA that I appreciated."
"D: Invigorating, complex, and incredibly drinkable. It was a late Saturday afternoon beer so I hadn't eaten in awhile, and I could feel the alcohol warming my cheeks. But this is profoundly drinkable for any hop head."
"D: It's definitely a good beer, but it doesn't stand out from the pack of DIPAs for me. Good beer but there are better entries in the style."
"D- Easy to drink for sure."
"Notes: No trouble here as I had two and enjoyed every drop."
"D - This is way too drinkable. It doesn't seem boozy. It is not sweet in any way, and within a half of a glass, the hops have burned the taste buds enough so that it seems no so bitter - at 9.4 ABV, it is as dangerous as a martini."
"Thin mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, but finishes tingly. Definite warming in the cheeks. Decent drinkability, but would like a little more complexity and balance."
"Pretty, bright tangerine-orange colored beverage, with an even fine haze. The near white head, large at first, turns to a dense soapy 1/8""" layer. Sparse bits of lace remain... Hoppy stinkiness floads out of the glass and up into my head. Flowery citrus soaked wood and a whole lot more. Frankly I'm not sure what's going on right here. Everything comes together into a tight blend of mouth watering punge-itude. Taste is loaded with all sorts of hoppy flavors. Orange, lemon, pine, cedar, grape skins, grapefruit rind, and more. Tingly carbonation throughout. This beer is a delicious treat, and also dangerously easy to consume."
"This was quite nice. Not among the very best, but I'd gladly have it again."
"Yet again, Founders has created a gem, a standout beer and stellar representative of the DIPA style. This is a terrific beer, another notch on the Founders belt. What's with those top-notch Michigan breweries. Between Founders, Bell's and New Holland, Michigan breweries are hard to beat."
"expected more of a taste at first, but as i continued to drink, it kept getting better and better. really nice hoppy taste, creamy and citrusy. very back of the throat bitterness with a soft and creamy body. great beer, another great offering from Founders."
"The drinkability is good, especially if you need a hop fix."
"This one is a hop bomb that has many interesting flavors going on. Plenty of tropical fruit and green leafy notes. Alcohol presence blends well with the aggressive hops. Pale malt, brings a certain sweetness that highlights the citrus bitterness rather than bringing balance."
"Drinkability: The aroma and taste are off the charts for this beer. It's exactly what a DIPA should be. Highly complex and drinkable. NICE!!!"
"Hop bitterness gets a quick start, a little coarse but not harsh. The fruit implied in the aroma follows through in the flavor with the malt putting up a better fight. Warm bread, honey, and tropical fruit saturates the palate with bitterness building to a long warm finish. Sticky but very well balanced with alcohol clearly evident but never hot, harsh or boozy. Pretty drinkable for a Double IPA but the bitterness and obvious alcohol are sufficient to slow me down. Still, a very delicious and dangerous beer. Nice."
"On the palate though the fruit is a little superficial and gives way quickly to a dry finish marked with a little bit of pepper??? Not much on the mid-palate. Curious. Over all an easy quaffer. A summery take on the Double IPA idea. A good picnic Dbl IPA, maybe if there is such a thing."
"this isn't a very strong beer by any means. it is very light compared to the double IPA's i'm used to drinking. it's got sort of sweet quality to it that makes it very easy to drink, but i'd prefer a stronger flavor over ease of drinking."
"D - Double Trouble is deceptively drinkable. Each sip begs for the next, and it's not heavy, sweet, or cloying. Despite the bitterness and lack of malt presence, it remains well rounded. A must-have DIPA that will surely give many others a run for their money."
"I guess my taste buds have changed significantly since I first tried this one, but I had it on tap the last week or so at the Pub. Still a great looking Double, great head retention. A big malt backbone to carry the hops and nicely balanced, Also not leaning towards sweet which in a Double i don't really care for. Drinks more like a juiced up bitter IPA, if fact it kinda reminds me of Smuttynose, but obviously a little more boozy. Decent finish. Overall a pretty good Double, but I really like my citrus monsters, and I don't get even a hint of Grapefruit with this one which knocks the taste back a notch. I can appreciate an earthy piney brew, and this one is more so than I remember. I also knocked down the drinkability a bit because it is a little hot, and good for one pint, two would be too much."
"This beer poured a nice golden pale color with a very nice white head. There is a considerable amount of lacing and it smells of citrus, pine and malt. The taste is a mirror image of the smell. The carbonation is medium for the style and very enjoyable. Another high class brew from Founders."
"Poured a hazy orangey gold color with a nice two finger head, which dissipated quickly and left little lacing in the glass. Very pronounced grapefruit-like hop smell; I got nothing else. Taste was incredibly almost like drinking grapefruit juice, much more so than any other IPA I've tried before. Remarkably, no real bitterness along with this very citrus and hoppy taste. I was looking and hoping for some bitterness in the finish from a DIPA, but the citrus kick up front stays put. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkability was good, even with the high ABV, just because of the low bitterness and nice taste."
"Eric"
"smooth and light yet not thin, some resins in the finish. gentle to moderate carbonation is refreshing yet not fizzy, playing a complementary role."
"Drinkability: Moderately high for something with such a big ABV. As I said in my intro, this is now my new favorite DIPA and I definitely give it the edge over Hopslam (no insult intended as that is an absolutely amazing beer as well). I'm going to say that as long as I'm not driving, two or three could be quaffed down in a night."
"Drinkability is great, the alcohol of 9.4% is very well hidden. Def. one of the better DIPA's out there, another winner from Founders. Paired with some habenero cheddar and pepperoni."
"Pours a slight hazy pale straw color with a nice dense foamy head leaving nice lacing with each sip. Great tropical fruit hoppy goodness. Lots of citrus, mangoe, grapefruit. Taste amazing again lots of citrusy hops almost a little sweet then a blast of bitterness cleans the palate. Some nice sweet caramel malt flavors in there as well but the hops really shine through. This is the closest thing to Hopslam I think there is. Not a hint of 9.4 percent alcohol at all. Nice and smooth. Another great beer from Founders"
"Drinkability is deceptive for a brew with this high an ABV. It went down fast and easy, and I could easily have gone for another two or three. Makes me wish I'd bought more. Oh, the woes of one who wants to try as many different beers as possible. Oh well. I know that if I need to bring something to a housewarming or a party this summer, this is going to be it."
"Food Pairing Recommendations: A good bleu cheese or Buffalo wings."
"Drinkability is OK but this is one hot brew. The 9.4 comes through almost too much."
"Overall, I appreciate the pilsner malt base. It give just enough of a foundation to support the hops, but don't challenge them as more highly kilned malts would. Though out of style, these malts showcase the hops well. Light on complexity, variety, and depth, many may consider this a bit to simplistic."
"This is a beer that I would almost term a hop bomb. Tons and tons of juicy citrus hops and fairly abrasive in the finish. For a hophead likie me, those are good things."
"This is a phenominal DIPA, one of the best I've experienced and reingnites my excitement for futher exploration for hoppy bliss"
"Pours a light amber/orange with a thin filmy white head that leaves lots of lacing. The aroma is lightly sweet fruit and has a wonderful resiny, piney, grapefruity quality that begs you take take a drink. Flavor is decidedly bitter with a nice caramel backbone. Nice fruitiness as well. Medum ot full bodied Finish is very dry, long and citrusy bitter. I say 2 thumbs up for Devil Dancers replacement!"
"D: A bit overboard on the centennial IMO. Decent and worth a try, but less than impressive."
"D: Although this is loaded with hops like it should be, they do not make you pucker when you drink it. Many others in the style are a struggle to get down. This one is extremely drinkable. I just wish I had another."
"D: A good beer but I expect more from Founders. They have fallen short of where I think they should be."
"Picked up a single at Abe's Cold Beer for $2.50. Appears a slightly hazy gold with light lacing. The aroma has a juicy white grape with lemon and bitter orange peel. The flavor dives into grapefruit and citrus rind with a grassy, herbal undertone that lasts into the aftertaste. There's a hint of sugary bread for the malt backbone. I have to say this DIPA is surprisingly drinkable. It reminds me a little more of a strong IPA, as its big, but it doesn't have that knock-out smack of hops."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with 3 fingers of foamy white head. Good retention leaves some really nice sticky lacing behind. Smells of honey, citrus, grain, floral, and piney hops. Taste starts out with a plethora of grapefruit followed by some candy, honey, and a touch of pale malt. Finish is a mix of grass, wood, and pine needle bitterness. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth with a semi-sticky feel, nicely bitter but not too over the top, pleasant. Dangerously easy to drink, hides the alcohol well."
"This is very fine DIPA from Founders; at least in my opinion, much better then the wretchedly sweet Devil Dancer they make. Other then the somewhat excessive alcohol bite in the finish, there really was nothing I didn't like about this beer. Well done."
"Drinkability: Not terribly high, especially compared to others in the style. The bitterness is HUGE and not balanced much by the other aspects."
"Another strong offering from a brewery that's done very little that wasn't for me."
"This beer poured a very hazy, yellowish color. Nice two finger white head with very nice head retention. Lacing was thick and sticky the whole way down. Nose is of citrusy hops, some earthy tones - grain, slight grass, and a bit piney. Taste is definitely of citrusy hops, most notibley grapefruit. Some floral hops present in the taste, with a touch of pine. There are some faint malt taste - possibly pale malts but it definitely doesn't detract from the bite of this beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slight sticky finish to it, carbonation is good. To sit and have 1 or 2 would be the ideal based on the ABV but taste wise, I could sit with this for an evening."
"D: Dangerously drinkable, this one could get me in trouble...if I had more that is. So damn tasty. I'm thrilled that we'll finally have Founders here in Minnesota in the coming months, as they make some fantastic stuff."
"Do I dare say that I like this more than Pliny the Elder? Yes, I dare say."
"Overall another winner from founders but I would probably go somewhere else for my DIPA fix first."
"Haven't had a bad beer from Founders yet!"
"12 oz. bottle poured into a Goose Island IPA glass. Produced a nice, thick creamy head that hung around a while. The hops smelled of citrus and pine, tasted the same. This beer was very smooth and balanced. Could not believe the alcohol was 9.4%, very deceiving. Would drink a few of these and not think twice. Very nice Imperial IPA from Founders."
"Very tasty IPA with an excellent aroma."
"I have wanted to try this offering from the home state for quite awhile.Poured into a standard pint glass a foggy/hazy light to medium golden with a tight formed 1/2 white head that settled slowly leaving shotty lace.Deep pine resin in the nose along with leather and alcohol dipped dark fruit,strong flavors on the palate,the alcohol does not hide by any means.Resiny pine and citrus rind really hit up front,big alcohol sweetness comes thru along with some overripe pineapple,it can sting ya after after one or two.A bigtime American hop monster,it will kick ya in the teeth,just the way I like it."
"Drinkability: Scarily drinkable on account of the fairly light body and the very well-balanced flavors."
"Drinkability: Another hyped beer that lives up to its reputation. While I am more of a malt guy, it is hard to argue with the near perfection of this one."
"This is not a session beer but nevertheless, it's weak enough that it's easy to sneak up on ya and give ya a good smack upon the head. The taste is a bit too heavy and earthy for me but nevertheless, this was a solid beer and proof that Founders hasn't found a style that they can't tackle head on. A great alternative for those who can't find a west coast I.P.A. in their local liquor store!"
"Overall I definitely prefer this to Founders """Triple IPA""" Devil Dancer (which I thought was more of a barleywine than Imperial IPA)."
"d: I love Founder's, but this came up a little short."
"Double Trouble is just that! As its double the hoppy tasty fun and definately troubled in its way too easy drinkability!"
"D- A pretty nice sipper with great balance. Reminiscent of hopslam, but a different animal, in my opinion. I'd be up for 1 or 2 of these per season."
"M/D - On the lighter side of medium bodied with an excellent crisp carbonation. The hops dont have the mouth coating feel of some oter big DIPA's, but that is about the only criticism I can come up with. An excellent DIPA."
"A great beer from Founders, well done. Will definitely look for more of this!"
"Refreshing an very drinkable, especially fresh. I drank it at 49F and it was just right. Highly recommended for hop heads! This is the real San Diego style IPA, for those that think Big Head is. Cheers!"
"Definately a different double IPA. It starts to makes sense when I remind myself this isn't a west coast brewery. Then again, neither is Bell's but this doesn't hold a candle to Hopslam."
"Poured on tap at the Roadhouse in Brookline, MA. Very nice orange/copper color with an unusually creamy head for a DIPA. Lots of lacing. The smell was beautiful citrus, as was the taste - more grapefruit than orange. Very, very flavorful, not not so intense that I couldn't have a few. If you're not into this style then stay away!"
"Truly a top-shelf beer & a first class DIPA. These are folks who know that you CAN'T PUT TOO MANY HOPS IN DIPA. Kudos to them!"
"D-Good flavor but finish kills the desire to have another one. Good try might be better in 6 months when hops die down a bit."
"D - Not bad, but not quite up to par for me with other Founders products. The alcohol seemed to dominate the flavor to much for this to be an elite IIPA. Still, good hop bomb, and will more than satisfy your need for hops."
"D- Great flavor but high abv in this brew. Hard for me to drink more than 2 in a night, but those 2 sure go down easy."
"Founders will do themselves a massive favor if they make Double Trouble a regular release. HopSlam is slightly superior, but if it's only brewed once per year, that doesn't do those of us without easy access much good. The only negative with this brew is that it has replaced the beautifully bombastic Devil Dancer. Oh well, a scathingly hoppy DIPA is more than adequate compensation."
"D: A decent DIPA. I expect more from Founders. A big part of that is that I either need to trade or travel to get their stuff. Glad this was a travel. A good beer but nothing amazing."
"Drinkability is... interesting. Very nice DIPA, but also huge - by the end of the glass, I was ok being finished."
"Clear golden yellow color with light orange center, two finger white head, nice sticky lacing. I love these golden DIPAs. No caramel malt to get in the way of the hops. Smell is unbridled piney and citrus hops. Taste is great! Nice and bitter, lots of grapefruit, orange, citrus goodness with just light malt sweetness. Very dry on the finish. This is definitely a hop bomb and a delicious one at that. Is it better than Hopslam? Not quite. But it's pretty darn close!"
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Pours a golden cloudy brew with white frothy head that leaves some lacing. A citrus aroma with spices that is very attractive. Viscous mouthfeel with grapefruit, hop center, fruit tang, alcoholic booze toward the finish. A real hoppy potion of a brew that could well with any season."
"This is a very solid DIPA; one of the fruitiest you'll ever find I'd say. And the fruit flavors are all over the map - pretty damn complex. I still don't know what's up with the smell - it's weird, but whatever it is doesn't hinder the taste. This is a very nice addition to Founders' lineup."
"Very drinkable, especially for the abv/intensity. This is appropriately named, as I would be in """double trouble""" if I drank this as a """session""" brew. This is the kind of DIPA I like!"
"Some warming from alcohol. Medium body, lower carbonation. Very nice."
"Overall a shockingly good DIPA from Founders. This one is very RResque, except not as solid in the malt profile and just BARELY doesn't hit quite as hard and this one is much dryer on the finish. I think if they threw some Fresh hops in this one in the fall or made the malt presence a touch more forward, it could easily compete with some of America's best. It's great as it is anyway. Very impressive from Founder's and one I would defenitely be drinking regularly if I had access. Great brew."
"Update: Like all IPA's ...make sure this is FRESH!!!! I had a slightly older one after this and it totally disappointed."
"Although this is a great tasting beer I would not reach for another in one session. The hop flavor is a little harsh (but good) and the alcohol is a bit high if one were to have more than a couple. This is a great brew with a great character. A big beer from a big brewery. Thank you Founders!"
"D: Just right for a DIPA, two or three in a session is just perfect. Not over the top, but definately something I would have often, if I could get my hands on it. A very nice selection from Founders. Skal."
"Overall- Sweet, yet bitter. A definite must have amongst BA'ers!"
"12 oz. Bright golden pour, fairly clear. Little white head. Great hop aroma with a little sweet malt. Taste is incredibly balanced hop and sweet malt profile. Little biscuit, yellow raisin peeks through, then is immediately matched by the piney hops, very little citrus really. Slightly bubbly light medium body. Very interesting clean double IPA. Dangerously drinkable for 9.4%. Nice bottle art as well. Definetely a beer to compare pros and cons to Hopslam with. I tend to like a sweeter, stickier brew, but it is hard to argue with the quality of this."
"If you like a hoppy DIPA but don't like to be punched in the face and want to have more than one, this is for you"
"D: The one thing that stands out in this beer is how close the sweetness and bitterness in this beer work with each other. It's almost impossible to tell them apart, it's as if they have sort of blended together to form a kind of hand in hand sensation of tingly fruitiness."
"A medium body thats not to heavy and not light in any way. With a creamy mouthful this beer goes down damn smooth. A nice sweet after taste leaves you wanting a second."
"Strikes a balance between different citrus fruits--pineapple and orange mostly--some grapefruit, but not as prominent as in some DIPA's. Low carbonation, with a slight alcohol warming at the finish. Another great beer by Founders."
"Drinkability- This is an excellent drinker and I would choose this as my lawnmower beer. I would be hot as hell, but I would be happy."
"I've always been a huge fan of anything Founder's and this IIPA is no exception. This beer has a lot of unique characteristics when compared to a lot of the others out there and I really enjoy it. I'm unsure of the availability of this IIPA but I'd love to see it brewed year round."
"Basically, it's a very solid DIPA with some standout traits. This would impress me a lot...and does in many way...but there is so much here that screams Hopslam. And it's just not at that level, so that it seems like a pretty cool cover band."
"smells of grapefruit and slightly citrus. has an opaque goldenrod color to it with almost no head. the taste is smooth for 9.40%ABV with no alcohol presence. there is a lot of citrus in the flavor and would be a great complement to any spicy dish. would have many more as long as it is available."
"Hazy orange with a tight white head. Excellent retention and lace. Tropical hop aroma, pinapples, mangos, citrus fruits, etc. Flavour is all about the tropical hops, with a big, sweet malt character to boot. Long, lingering bitterness. Carbonation seems a tad on the low, with a truly viscous mouthfeel. Nice DIPA, and exactly what you would expect from the style. Maybe just a touch to big and sweet for me, but good none the less."
"Drinkability: Another win for Founders. I was blown away by this beer. The alcohol is excellently hidden...If not for the high ABV I would have several. An excellent beer for the style and for all beers."
"Well done here by Founders. I hope this stays available because I will definitely be seeking this out again. A top notch DIPA that I recommend to anybody who loves hoppy beers."
"Dark golden color with just a hint of copper/bronze. Much lighter than expected. Head drops quickly to a light soap scum head that trails just small patches of lace. Smell is a powerful grapefruit knock in the face. Taste matches the smell but somehow manages to finish somewhat dry and clean. Mouth is a little syrupy. 9.4% is well hidden. I'm tired of saying it, but once again an exceptional beer from Founders."
"Comment: This is a seriously bitter beer. In a good way. I enjoy the initial malt rush because it provides a platform for the enormous hop entrance. Balance. Balance. Balance. My main criterion for a great beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for an IIPA, making it easy to go through more than one. It's a very, very good IIPA, but it seems to just fall short of its potential. To me, it tastes like a slightly watered-down version of Hopslam. It is still an excellent beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. There was less carbonation than expected."
"Another kickass Founders Brew. Spot on for a IIPA."
"this beer pours a light orange color with a 1""" head with beautiful lacing thru-out..smell is of strong pine and grapefruit upfront with delicious strong bitter hops and a malt sweetness that perfectly balances the high 9.4 abv... it is perfect!! to follow the taste is of exceptional hops floral citrus and malt all blending together with the smoothest DIPA ive ever tasted you will not taste the alcohol but you will feel it later. the mouthfeel and drinkability are exceptional. this edges out HOPSLAM.. this is a perfect DIPA... well done founders your brews are fast becoming my favorite brewery. the beer comes in a 4-pak and is pricey per bottle but 100% worth it! it is a gem and a treat for your beer senses...A-plus.. also i like the double look label unique."
"D: Enjoyable, it will put me to sleep. Would drink again"
"Drinkability - Very solid as IPAs go. ABV over 9% sneaks up on you, doesn't dominate the drinking experience."
"This is a solid beer by Founders that I definitely enjoyed. It's a little bit dryer then I would like it to be but the hop flavor in it is delicious. Not something I would drink regularly, but I could see myself picking up another bottle or maybe an entire 4-pack somewhere down the road. Not a session beer by any means."
"At least I can awake to new purpose!"
"Awesome artwork on the label as well."
"Thanks to Sholland for this gift! Good meeting you! Poured into a tulip. Pours a light, hazy yellow. Thin white head. Smells of huge citrus! Grapefruit, orange etc. Wonderful sweet aroma. Tastes fairly similar. Lots of hops- mostly bitter grapefruit with little malt to back it up. Some spearmint gum flavor, too. I usually love this profile, but this is a bit thin. Very good, though. Will definitely seek out more when it hits the area."
"Drinkability: Again, this is a HOP BOMB. You're not going to sit back and kill the four pack in an afternoon... This ain't no session beer... But for a DIPA, I would say this ale has good drinkability. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"I'm not sure if I'm blown away by this but I would recommend this as a great example of the style."
"Notes: Very different than the other two but still a competitor. I can def see myself buying this again and again in the future."
"Very bitter with a decently rich body. The carbonation is also high. The malty beginning portion is relatively benign. The hop is the story--it completely dominates the swallow and the aftertaste, which goes on seemingly forever. Although the taste does not reflect the smell, it's hard to ignore on the initial taste."
"poured into a pint rich honey golden with a dense head that quickly fell, leaving a sticky lace throughout. Waves of pine resin and grapefruit citrus rise from the glass to the nose. The beer strikes the mouth thick with an alcohol warmth. While the hops attack in a floral pine bite, they are backed equally by a toasty malty backbone of sweet balance. The hops never subside, the tongue tingles from their spice, but the malt continues to deliver sweet burnt caramel. Grapefruit citrus swirls around the mouth. After it's gone, the tingle of hops and the warm glow of 9.4% abv are the obvious remains. this is a huge beer that brings a massive balance between a mountain of hops and an ocean of malt. The alcohol takes a flavor back seat but punches harder than some 11%s I've had (unearthly for one). To steal from Shaefer: this is the one beer to have when you're having only one! Afterwards, the mouth is corrupted and the mind is fogged. Founders has balanced it's no-prisoners hop attack with a huge malt presence that warms the mouth. DIPA it it's finest."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall another awesome beer from Founders. They continue to amaze me. Keep em coming Founders."
"Whenever I review a hoppy beer I start by mentioning I am not regularly a fan of hoppy beers. I prefer malty dark beers. I am rarely enthralled with the hoppy beers most people seem to love.. However, I enjoyed Double Trouble quite a bit.. As expected, it was a lot like Dogfish 90 minute.. strong hop presence but balanced with a strong malt backbone as well.. The aroma is all hop, but a bit mroe earthy than the typical citrusy, pine-like hop aroma.. Flavor is also, obviously, very hoppy yet with that malty sweetness lurking just behind the floral front. For such a strongly flavored beer it is surprisingly easy to drink.. the mouth is on thelighter side of moderate and it doesn't weigh you down. Overall its really great.. every for malt-lovers."
"D: No want for hops in this one. You'll have your fix and be ready to rest and then have maybe one more - and enjoy them both."
"Solid DIPA, just wish the was a little more complexity going on to break up the hop bitterness upfront and the dry citrus finish."
" I guess this one just didn't hold up to my PacNW ipa palate, reminding me of just another iipa."
"The alcohol is pretty well hidden even though it clocks in over 9%. This isn't a bitter palate smashing ipa, but is really hoppy and easy to put back at the same time. Well done."
"D: This is a drinkable, solidly made double. Another good entry from Founders."
"Very slight orange hue and a very slight haze. White head quickly disappeared to tight lacing in the glass. Very well balanced for a IIPA. Hints of biscuit and apricots in both the smell and the taste. Very dry finish which brought down my drinkability rating. All around a very tasty beer. Founders has yet to disappoint me."
"bright golden straw color with a slight chill haze and a creamy snow white head. tropical fruit, honeyed bisuity malts, and resiny/lemony citrus in the nose. taste follows suit with the balance towards the big but smooth hop bitterness over the lightly sweet malts. medium in body with prickly carbonation in the mouthfeel. warming alcohol is noted on the back end. long drying, bitter finish but not harsh. drinks easier than the abv would suggest."
"It's good to see Founders releasing a DIPA in bottles and this one brings the thunder, with a big time fresh tasting mix of hops and citrus. A touch too hot maybe but I still really enjoyed this. Another great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"The aroma is of ripe, bitter grapefruit and pine resin. The alcohol is fairly noticeable in the nose, as well as an underlying sweetness. Double Trouble is a dry, light bodied, west coast style DIPA. The high level of bitterness is reminiscent of grapefruit and pine, just like the aroma. Sweetness is very low. The alcohol is strong in the dry and bitter finish. The beer is light-medium bodied with good carbonation and a sticky, oily mouthfeel. This is a pretty damn good Imperial IPA."
"Found a four pack of this tonight at Winchester Wine and Spirits...lately it has been all about the hops for some reason. Pour gives off a light, clear golden color, which seems a bit unorthodox for this style. Usually you get darker tinges of orange and even red, but anyway, large white heading comes through. Complex nose, one that you should take your time with. I get honeysuckle, alcohol, pineapple, mango, bit of bees wax. Hops show themselves a lot more in the taste, with the hops beginning with a spicy edge, and then some tiny amount of fruit, and ending on a dry bitter note. Mouthfeel is light to medium, which is another oddball quality of this beer; still love it. Alcohol is very well hidden, although there were times when vodka popped in to my mind upon tasting. Easy drinking all around with this one. So far the alcohol has not crept up on me, but it is still somewhat early. Good going Founders."
"D: Pretty hefty but tasty brew. It's a winner the bitterness and ABV would curb me after one. Could use a bit more balance."
"Because this finishes up lightly it goes down pretty nicely. While there's an alcohol burn it doesn't translate into huge residual sugar and weight to the palate so it doesn't come off as thick. Nicely done."
"D- Very easy to drink for somehing thats over 9%. One of those """the next thing I know it was gone""" beers. They did well with this one."
"D- an easy to finish beer and a quick fix for hop withdrawal. i could see myself having a couple of these, but any more than that and the high level of alcohol would take its toll on me. glad to see this one bottled, but i thought the on tap/growler was better."
"I bought this at the Blacklick Wine & Spirits in Reynoldsburg, Ohio."
"This one pours a yellow orange thats slightly hazy and has a nice white, soapy head that diminishes to a small ring. The smell is slightly sweet with a citrus front and some fresh cut grass and pine bringing up the rear. The taste is slightly bitter hops without much pine and grass and more sugary sweet with a hint of pineapple and other citrus juice. The mouthfeel is a little thin and lacks body. The carbonation could be kicked up a little as well. The drinkability is still good but this one could be better. I believe Hopslam outshines this midwest DIPA."
"Bright, lightly hazed, golden yellow color under a thick, whipped off-white head. Drippy little patches of lace and an ever-present bubbly cap. Deep hoppy aroma: heavy grapefruit, orange juice, pineapple, tropical fruit, and flowers. All fresh, dank, and oily smelling. Tons of sticky fruit-juicy hoppiness in the flavor. Sweet, sugary citrus hop oils stick to the tongue...that's about it, but it's done so damn well. Like biting into an orange. Medum-full body, creamy and yet almost crisp in the finish. Not much heat suprisingly, although something keeps it from being too dangerously drinkable. Still, a deliciously citrusy DIPA that impresses me on all levels."
"Overall, one of the most subtle DIPAs I've had, and better for it."
"A very nice DPA."
"A hazy golden yellow/orange color with a huge fluffy white head that satys around for a long time,huge amounts of sticky lace all over the insides of my glass. Smells of grass(skunk weed,in a good way)pungent citrus and piney hops with very little malt presence.Flavor at first is ultra sugary/tart grapefruit,oily lemon peel, and pine needles, more bitterness,if you let it warm enough you can detect some of the faint caramel malt tones,and this very faint note of honey. Finish is dry and a little boozy. Medium in both body and carbonation.One of the best growlers of beer ever drank. Super Ultra Good !"
"Pours honey-orange with a extra small white fizzy head that doesn't hang around or leave any lacing. Smell is carmel malt and lots of hops I think I detect some honey notes as well(but it could be all the hopslam I've been slammin'). Taste is off the charts this is another top-notch double! Everything is right in place with this well balanced hop-bomb. It's nice to know their doing this in the mid-west. If I ever find my self in the great-lakes area I know I can get some great beer. Seek this one out hop lovers from all regions, you'll be glad you did!"
"A solid, if rather pungent IIPA."
"The main differences I see between the bottle & tap is in the smell & taste, both of which are more intense on tap. I notice the alcohol in the bottle and not at all on tap. More balance on tap for me as well and not as bitter."
"Another homerun for Founders, I really like this beer because it reminds me of Pliny the Elder. Definitely one of my new favorite DIPAs"
"Drinkability: A very, very solid example of my favorite style, this one's more to the light end - lighter citrus, lighter leafy notes, very simply sweet - and that's A-OK with me. The 9.4% is hidden amongst the hoppy goodness, and - if the bitterness were toned down a little and the carbonation toned down ever so slightly, this one would be nearing a perfect 5.0. A lot of promise here, but even with those minor flaws, this one's a great, great beer."
"This pours out a very pale color, like straw. There's a thin head with loose bubbles and decent lacing. The smell is really great. There's an amazing fruitiness in the hops. A bit different than the over-the-top citrusy kind of stuff. The hops are just pungent and wonderful, like fresh hops. After the head fades a bit, you get a bit more of the alcohol smell. The taste is far less hoppy. You get this resinous, sticky feel, with a kind of piny taste, and there's quite an alcohol taste. There's kind of a fake fruity taste in there, like candy fruit flavors without the sweetness. Very dry. The mouthfeel is actually very nice. It kind of warms you inside, and is quite smooth. The carbonation is not too sharp. The drinkability is about average. There's very little to pull you away, but this one catches you quick enough to prevent the desire for a second."
"D- A very different take on the style. I did enjoy this, but it is a little on the sweet side."
"Very nice. A model DIPA in my book."
"Notes - I don't rate the drinkability as high because Double IPAs aren't my favorite style, the bitterness lingers in my mouth and blows up my tastebuds for a while. Otherwise good."
"Final Thoughts: Comparisons to HopSlam are inevitable - this beer doesn't hold a candle to HopSlam. It is still a darn good beer that I would love to drink from time-to-time."
"D: This beer packs a punch. It will knock your taste buds around and the alcohol percentage is high so you can find yourself feeling different after just a few."
"D - Reminds me a lot of my attempt at a Blind Pig clone. Very easy to drink, especially for 9.4%abv which is well hidden."
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow hue with a bright white creamy head that slowly falls to a nice layer of foam. A good amount of thin lacing holds on the sides of the glass. Smell is heavy on the citrus; fresh grapefruit, orange peel, and lemongrass. Underneath that is more hops, sticky pine with a very small amount of pale malts. I can tell this will be a hop bomb...Taste starts off with those big citrus hops but with a good amount of bitter flavor mixed in as well. Midway a touch of caramel malt and a hefty dose of spruce and earth. For some reason the aftertaste is pretty weak which is odd for such a hop monster. Body is a bit thin for the style with a gritty feel and a medium carbonation. A pretty good DIPA for sure, one I would gladly enjoy again and again. Thanks again Alex!"
"The drink is heavy-medium in body with good carbonation and fine drinkability for style."
"Been waiting for this one to make it to PA. Picked up a single at The Beer Stop for $3.50. Poured into my nonic pint glass a hazy golden yellow with a green hue. The head is a solid two fingers deep and off-white in color. Smells of grass, stinky citrus and piney hops with very little malt presence. Did they dry hop this with skunk weed? Upon my first sip, a huge flood of bitterness attacks my taste buds. Notes of white grapefruit, lemon peel, and pine needles, more bitterness, and an almost non-existent malt backbone. Finish is dry and a little boozy. Medium in both body and carbonation. I'd drink it again."
"HV"
"Pours very bright yellow, very similar to harvest ale. Minimal head that went away quick. I could smell the hops from about a foot away. When I finally brought the glass close to my nose I got alot of lemon, a little pine and more citrus smells. Hops are very prevelant but do not dominate at all. Very easy drinker for having almost 10% abv. I could put a few of these down but I would certainyl be rocked. Feeling buzzed already from just one. Excellent example of a double ipa. Founders impresses me more and more with every beer I try. I think this will be in my fridge from now on. Highly recommended."
"Of the roughly 20 double/imperial IPA's i've had I would not hesitate to say this is the most enjoyable."
"Another winner from Founders. These guys can do no wrong."
"Oh yes! Poured a dark orange thickness and just smelled of pure, floral hops. A solid off white head of which some stuck around awhile. The taste was amazing--a powerful hop sweet/bitter combo that finished as strong as it started. It was thick and almost chewable.. mmmm! Darn decently drinkable for being as thick and strong as it was too. Founders done good again!"
"D: Drinks a lot better and smoother than the 9.4% abv would suggest. Another delicious winner from Founders!"
"D: high drinkability because the alcohol doesn't stick out. the flavor doesn't keep me coming back for more though. it's a solid brew but nothing i that makes me want to buy another over other DIPAs"
"I am officially obssessed with this beer at present. I find myself at the brewery on a regular basis ordering several pints and then obtaining growlers for the road, pulling four packs from the coolers of any store I find it lingering about within, having invasive thoughts about it at inappropriate times, etc. I can't put my finger on what exactly it is. Honestly, I have had better tasting brews. Better smelling brews. And to tell you the truth, I think the name is kind of cheesy too. But it just feels good. It works. I love it. It is futile to resist."
"Had this on tap at the Founders brewery. Has all the typical characteristics of the style.. orange-ish color, grapefruit-ish hoppy aroma and flavor, strong alcohol backbone. Was balanced appropriately as some beers of the style can be too overwhelming in terms of bitterness or strength. Really enjoyed this one and picked up a few to come back to later."
"This is a great DIPA; not for those afraid of bitterness, but a reward for hop lovers. Founders does it again - I am a bigger fan of these guys every time I have a new one."
"poured from a bottle obtained in a trade. pours light copper with light head. the smell is mind blowing. HUGE citrus notes. lots of grapefruit. this reminds me of a west coast DIPA, but from MI. giant hop bitterness up front with light malty finish. alcohol is very present as this sucker is 9.4%. it is noticeable from start to finish. hop flavors are citrus, very grapefruit with a bit of pine. if it had a smidge less alcohol, it would be a perfect score. mouthfeel is perfect in this one. founders tends to release some over carbonated beers here and then and this one is perfect. i would love to drink these more often if i could. search this out!"
"Nice to have a something approaching a West Coast DIPA in the midwest."
"D - This beer is better than my expectations."
"It looks like Chicago go a ton of this, so I'll be grabbing another 4-pack before it disappears."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a nice bite of carbonation."
"Poured a medium and cloudy yellow color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas of citrus, floral, pine, and a trace of tropical fruits. Tastes of citrus (grapefruit), pine, the same tropical fruitiness, some sugary sweetness, and a little doughy. Light to medium alcohol in the finish."
"Overall, really great example of the style, and the taste is one of the better of any DIPA's I've had in a while. Very much recommended."
"D: Good with a spicy meal. Excellent slow drinking beer."
"Lush citrus in the front, strong hop character, with a drying piney bitterness lingering on the back end. Seems to last forever, as if chewing on a fresh grapefruit rind. Fairly full bodied, verging on syrupy, but it dries out quickly in the end. Very tasty, a strong midwest contender in the DIPA arms race."
"D- Highly recommended and easy to drink."
"Might also be suffering a little in comparison to all the absolutely stellar offerings from Founders but a top noch DIPA"
"Overall Impression- Ignoring the Simcoe characteristics of this beer. Double trouble is another example of the phenomnal abilities of the brewers at Founders! They must have alien technology to deliver some of the beers they produce. This is no exception. If your not drinking Founders your just not drinking a quality beer. They do have the occasional bombs (Devil Dancer), but I never have a problem laying out the duckets for Founders. West Coast brewers beware!"
"Overall: Another fantastic beer from Founders. Glad I picked this one up. Now I need to grab another."
"D - It is a higher alcohol content but I would love to sip this all the time. I just regret not finding this brew sooner. I was only able to purchase one bottle as that was all the was left at my supplier. I will look for this more often."
"Like a lot of people, I had this beer side-by-side with Hopslam. Even though they are the same style they are very different beers. Hopslam gets a slight edge in my opinion, but I really enjoyed Double Trouble and the two beers compliment each other very well. There are definetly days and settings where I would prefer Double Trouble to Hopslam."
"Interesting to have this released around the same time as Hopslam. I am having the two back to back and am definitely enjoying the Hopslam more, though this is definitely in my top 5 all time DIPAs without a doubt."
"Future outlook: Quite good. Didn't live up to Hopslam, but at ~1/2 the price, a pretty solid alternative."
"This is a very tasty, very good beer. The low perception of alcohol, mixed with the somewhat high actual level could be some sort of combination of the words double, and perhaps, trouble. If only they would name it accordingly. All kidding aside, a tasty IIPA, that I would purchase again. Another solid hit for Founders."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. Great beer for a hophead I think this is one of the better DIPAs out right now, I wish this was a year round offering!"
"I'm not a huge hophead, but I could still go for a few of these a night. Another quality job by Founders."
"Drinkability: Yessir!"
"A good addition to the Founders line-up."
"Drinkability took a hit due to the high ABV and strong flavors..."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: Founder's makes some fantastic beers. This is the second IIPA of theirs that I have had and it definitely did not let me down. It has a beautiful aroma and a flavor that is perfect for a sippable beer. I think the lingering bitterness might turn away some customers, but for those that don't mind a nice hop bitterness bring your finest tulip glasses on over."
"A 'must' for all IPA lovers! Get some!!"
"D:At 9.4 it will definitely sneak up on you, but I will probably drink the entire 4-pack over the course of the night. Great beer."
"Overall a very, very good DIPA. The earthy, leafy flavors of the hops reflect a more rustic and organic tone, rather than fruit cocktail syrup sweetness that many sub-par high alcohol hop bombs seem to be. If you like 'em more bitter and biting, this one's got your number. The fallback of the malty sweetness really compliments the hop attack, making it a wonderfully balanced bear hug of a DIPA."
"One at a time this one could send you into sensory overload, great stuff but it's perfect to purchase by the four pack. One suggestion for Founders would be to take a step in their own direction with hops, the make a Centennial IPA and Bell's Two Hearted is straight Centennials. This brew is being released alongside HopSlam, it's two much of a MacDonald's vs BK, or Coke vs Pepsi copy cat competition on a mini scale."
"Drinkability- All of Founders IPA's all have the exact same body and overall 'foundation' (for lack of a better word). They manage to get the beers nice and hoppy yet not crazy bitter. Not real sure how they do it since there is little malt detectable. Whatever they're doing it's freaking delicious. Thanks again Don!"
"Hopheads rejoice, this one is a keeper. The smell is amazing while the taste is not very balanced but who cares? (edit: after warming, more balanced). Try it."
"D- A healthy dose of hops and booze make this a definite sipper. A semblance of balance make it a decent drinker."
"Overall this is a very sessionable dipa that could hurt you. I like the hopslam more but this is right up there. Very nice."
"Really good IIPA overall, and if you like hop-bombs than you should definitely put forth the effort to track this one down."
"Notes: When I first had this the day it hit stores, I tried it back to back with Hopslam and was severly dissapointed by it. Having it on its own, however, makes you realize and appreciate the huge differences between the two. This is a goliath, where Hopslam is a bit lighter on its toes."
" I thought it was very similar to HopSlam, in my opinion. Probably will be equally hard to find though."
"This beer poured a clear copper color and formed a small off white head that left trace lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus-grapefruit, pine and caramel. The flavor was of hops, grapefruit, caramel and pepper. The body is medium light and the finish slightly astringent, yet sweet. A pretty nice IPA that hides the alcohol level pretty well."
"Bottle. Pours a nice gold in color. There's a very nice inch of carbonated head forming on the pour. There are no carbonation issues with this one, like I found in the Harvest Ale this year. Smell is nice, citrusy hops. Very welcoming, but not overpowering hops. Taste is more of the bittering hops. Somewhat citrusy. Very crisp and clean on the mouthfeel. This has a lot of the characteristics of their Harvest Ale, just a bit bigger. Very good beer. Nice time of year to be having this, HopSlam and Nugget Nectar available."
"The pungent and earthy hop bomb that this is tickles the tongue at first but it's just a little foreplay cuz then it give the whole mouth a kick of citrus brightness. Notes of honey & malt then step up to smooth everything over. The complexities are great and interesting to the end with the finish of leaving both a spicy & lemony and slight eucalyptus hot bite and a sweet malt tinges down the back of the throat."
"D- Very drinkable beer for hops lovers. Will have this again for sure."
"Tastes just a bit milder than the smell. Hops scorch the tongue but the sweetness saves it from being a disaster. There's a nicely dry finish and it's somewhat bitter. There's a nice alcohol/hop burn in the finish as well. All the elements play very nicely together. This is very damn drinkable. So strong and dense it's a sipper for sure."
"I am a big fan of Founder's beers and I visit the brew house every chance I get. I did have Double Trouble on tap during Christmas 08 and I do not think it lost any of its characteristics after bottling."
"Poured a clear color with a bronze tint. Lacing was short lived, but it did pour with a strong presence of darker than white colored head. Smell is initially citrusy with grapefruit, and a strong malt presence as well. On a second waft some pine hops can be noticed as well. Taste is strong on citrus with floral notes. Alcohol blends in nicely with this for 9.4%, but every once in a while it pops up. Mouth feel is not as strong as hop slam, but still balanced."
"I picked up a 4-pack for $11.99 in Columbus. The beer is crystal clear and yellow / light orange colored, with a thin head. The smell is hoppy in a citrus way, with fruits ranging from grapefruit to orange. There's also a hint of """malt rot", that's probably not as accurate as it could be but it's what I get out of some DIPA's (such as this one in a small way and Double Crooked Tree in a big way). The taste is a strong suit, all the citrus elements from that aroma with some abrasiveness on the tongue, bitter but not too much in the aftertaste, good malt balance, very nice. The body is on the light side but substantial enough for my preferences. As usual Founders makes a solid beer, you can never go wrong choosing it."
"Double Trouble's pretty impressive. I like it. It's certainly a bitter hop bomb, which is always welcome in my world. I'd prefer a little more of a citric hop flavor. It just seems like it'd work slightly better than the strong floral/piney quality of the hops. Very small complaint. It is a very good beer and is definitely recommended."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a medium body with a sticky feel. The flavors are long lasting. The abv may make the drinkability go down for some folks. I never noticed it during the first beer. Half way through the second bottle I am feeling it. Well played Founders. Well played!..."
"I love Founder's beers and this beer continues to keep my faith with them alive."
"Nice with obvious big grapefruit but even bigger alcohol. Huge bitterness with a slight residual sugar. A bit chalky in mouthfeel and very thick which is kind of offsetting. Just a monster DIPA, very tasty yet hard to drink quickly or many of."
"D- Drinkability is good. For the third and final time, be careful. You can't tell the alcohol from the taste."
"mouthfeel is lingering resinous hops, clean finish with oils lingering on your tongue, dry, excellent level of carbonation, creamy head, sweet and nicely bitter, easy to drink due to hidden alc"
"Overall, a solid DIPA. I just wished that there was something that would grab my attention about this beer. Everything was well done, but nothing stood out. Just a great brew that you can rely on to give you a mix of hoppy, citrus taste."
"Notes: outstanding IPA. definitely keeps pace with Bells Hopslam"
"D - A little below average for the style. I would expect a bit more character from the malts to even out the hops a bit."
"Pours a lightly hazed copper, almost orange, medium sized white head forms, very thick and forms a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots, nice retention. Smell is super hoppy, lots of pine and grapefruit, alcohol and caramel, floral, more grapefruit, huge hops, but very alcoholic which creates a pinesol aroma, but still awesome. Taste is similar, tons of pine and grapefruit, lots of malt too, alcohol, caramel and floral, some fruitiness, very sweet and malty middle, more pine, intense bitter finish, pretty badass. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth but goes down pretty smooth for the ABV, alcohol is present but works well with the hop oiliness, pretty great DIPA!"
"D - Tasty DIPA for sure, but a 12-oz. serving was definitely enough for me, especially after drinking all day. This is one DIPA that is certainly not for the faint of heart!"
"D-An A+ for me. So happy to get a chance to try this brought back from the dead brew. Save the hops by not making Devil Dancer and make more of this! My kind of DIPA for sure."
"D: This is a great beer that I could drink all night, but they had 16 beers on tap including KBS!!! Just a great night."
"poursed an amber color this filled the glass nicely. served on tap and in a standard pint glass."
"Medium copper with dark orange edges. Slight haze. Creamy dollop of off-white head that hugged the glass nicely. Served a bit too cold, so I let it warm. Nose full of big, bold, citrusy hops. Some tropical fruits and pineapple as well. A little candy sugar and biscuit to boot. Very hoppy! Taste followed suit. Big, citrusy grapefruit hop flavors combine with pineapple, tropical fruits, and pine. Some sweetish, sugary malt slips in but can't do much. Medium-bodied, very creamy feel. A very nice hop-bomb DIPA, but could use a little more malt for my tastes."
"Pours copper and hazy witha fluffly off white head that recedes slowly and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. First whiff after pouring is a strong evergreen hoppiness with an underlying sweet citrusiness. Further on, the sweet citrus becaomes more dominant with some grapefruit and sweet tropical fruit notes. Taste is the sweet citrus flavor riding a medium body with a nice malt backbone. There is a sprite like sweetness as well that blends into a peppery bitterness and finishes with a nice dryness and some evergreen flavor. A highly drinkable beer for me, one of those beers where every sip makes you crave another. Although the alc content is still fairly high, it is much easier to drink more of this than the devil dancer, which is a great sipper. This beer also fits the dipa category better for me."
"Had this beer on-tap at Founders the other day. Wow it sure is HOPPY. Not that nice flowery hoppy either, just piney. This thing is all sting. Luckily I was in dire need of a hop jolt so this beer was satisfying. There isn't much of a backbone to this beer just all hops, for that reason I marked it down in drinkability. It really is out of balance and isn't for the faint of heart. My tongue was gone after one pint. I was tasting the hops the rest of the day, not that that is a bad thing."
"Founders seem to have the IPA/DIPA style pretty well blanketed right now. Double Trouble is another fine addition to their stable of beers in the style, and I enjoyed it throughly."
