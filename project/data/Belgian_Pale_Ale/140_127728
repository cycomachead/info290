3.59,-3.8,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"""A penchant for yeast," eh? There was such a pile of lees atop the kick that I was unsure as to how to proceed following the Pop!ping of the cap. Gentle? Mais oui! Certainment! But even at that, how could I avoid rousing the lees? Cue Cicerone (tm) CBS # 739! I began at a tremendous angle to the glass and poured until I saw the first bit of lees pull loose from the punt, at which time, I stopped the pour and let it settle back in the bottle. I used the bartender's trick to create a brief finger of fizzy, bone-white head that quickly reduced back to wisps. Color was pure Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity and my trio of gelt fiends, Midas, Croesus and Mammon appeared, fighting once again over who would get the first sip. I am deeply indebted to them, but I was not going to wait the outcome of their latest squabble. Nose had a Juicyfruit chewing gum odor, no doubt of the yeast. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was tart, like the lemon zestiness of the hops was in counterbalance with the sweet fruitiness of the yeast's esters. This was an experiment which needs tweaking, IMHO. Warming, I was getting black pepper and a mild funkiness, but the hops must have faded in the interim. Oh well. Finish was dry, tart and refreshing, but not really my cuppa tea. The final pour looked like murky lemonade. Nose was VERY funky! Taste was the melange as described earlier, but now more pronounced! Wow.","woodychandler","Feb 16, 2015"

The smell is grassy, with a little bit of yeasty funk. The taste is of coriander, a slight note of cloves and some nice Belgian funky flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty light, but it stays quite nicely on the palate, and finishes somewhat dry. This is one of my favorite beers out of the beer camp pack. Too bad it's a one-off beer.

Big yeasty notes on the nose, a bit of nutmeg/allspice, and some citrus (as the brew warmed up). Hops were very faded (it was bottled almost 4 months ago, so I was expecting this), however with a little time, some grapefruit/citrus came through. Good, clean flavors though. Great mouthfeel. This was very good, even with my arriving to the party late... though I would say that the Allagash collaboration edged it out by a good deal! Still very happy with Beer Camp!","Mikus","Sep 30, 2014"
4.5,20.6,,,,,,"Has a big fruit nose dominated by orange over light biscuit with hints of peach and light banana. It pours peachy gold with a light haze under a  1” finely bubbled foam cap that quickly dissipates. A rich, creamy fruity attack features large pitted fruits, orange and a suggestion of tropical fruit but no banana. There is some spice in the background – maybe oregano. A very effervescent beer with a medium light body, Yonder Bock finishes sparkly clean and refreshing. While the beer is hop forward, providing an assertive bitterness on the finish, it in no way interferes with the Belgian yeast flavors and the hop flavors are refined enough to sneak by those who dislike hops.","pat61","Sep 29, 2014"

This is a very drinkable pale with a nice yeast and hop combo for 6.3% it has a nice complexity level...I expected nothing less from Russian River and Sierra Nevada!","Slatetank","Aug 16, 2014"

3.75,0.5,,,,,,"The beer pours very little white foamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a very yellow gold that is clear. The beer smell consists of earthy hops and the usual suspects for a BPA. The notes are a lighter than usual bubblegum note that is probably created by candied sugars and a bit of yeast that gives off a nice breaded note. The taste has a stronger hop note than the smell. No bubblegum notes but the candied sugars are noticeable as well as a bit of a yeast taste as well. The beer is fairly smooth with consistent and effervescent carbonation. Medium bodied but on the lighter side. A decent beer, and worth trying at least once.","HattedClassic","Aug 15, 2014"

3.99,7,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a one finger white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of saison style yeast, clove, light bready malt, apple juice; spicy. Flavor is Belgian saison style yeast, clove, hint of funk, then developing a lightly buttery, bready malt flavor for a melded malt and Belgian style finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A successful hybrid of American blonde and Belgian pale styles, combining the dry start of Belgian yeast and spicing with the lightly buttery blonde malt. Nicely done. Blondes tend to be a bit pedestrian for me, but I liked this combination of styles quite a bit. Another winner from this interesting Beer Camp box.","LiquidAmber","Aug 06, 2014"
4.04,8.3,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Overall, this is one of my more preferred beers out of the pack, as the brewers at RR and SN have managed to find that sweet spot between the two quintessential characters of American and Belgian approaches--hops and yeast. And with both, they manage to infuse them without letting one overpower the other, so this stays firmly out of the IPA/Tripel hybrid that is the Belgian IPA. Instead, you have a much easier drinking, but nicely interesting beer.","LambicPentameter","Aug 06, 2014"

Nose of farmhouse funk, all-spice, oregano, and a bready backbone. Flavors are all spice forward and heavy, with a resinous hops character to follow, and a subtle sourness in the backbone, with hints of funk. Very herbal up front, with a rich sweetness to balance. Light and crisp in mouth, with a spiced and funky aftertaste. The finish is effervesced and clean.","GarthDanielson","Jul 27, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grain, spice, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, earth, spice, citrus zest, and Belgian yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Pours a straw-gold with a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, 1/8th inch bright white head that quickly dissipates towards the edges leaving a dollop in the center. Nose expresses belgian yeast, coriander, citrus and a bright herbal quality. Taste follows nose; however, herbal quality is more pronounced as well as some spice. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but close to light) with a bright carbonation and a mild acidity. Overall - drinkable with a nice hops profile.

Actually has a funkiness to it. That is probably the Belgian yeast. Malty taste up front with strong bitter, hoppy taste. At the end, you get the more sour Belgian flavor.

Pours slightly hazy bright gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, banana, pear, apple, white grape, clove, pepper, light bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, banana, pear, apple, white grape, clove, pepper, bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate yeast spice/hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, banana, pear, apple, white grape, bubblegum, clove, pepper, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a nice crisp malt/yeast spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian pale ale! All around good complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 25, 2014"

While both are aggressive to the point of discomfort and give little regard to conventional norms, Yvan (much like Company) proves itself less coherent (in motive and execution) in addition to being more broadly structured by a ceaseless incisiveness.","QuentinCall","0"

The aroma, however, is pretty nice, spicy-phenolic, hoppy, with a light fruitiness. The flavor is a nice change from the other beers I've had in the collection: this one is well-balanced and interesting, with a clean but stead maltiness, deliciously yeasty-spicy character that gives a little pepperiness (is there coriander in here too? It tastes like it to me, but it might be the yeast character), with light but very ripe fruitiness. This is a very well-done Belgian-style, that doesn't adhere to any particular style but which is interesting and very drinkable.","allengarvin","Jul 22, 2014"

4.17,11.8,3.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured a pretty clear golden yellow with a thin ring of white foam. The body looks fantastic, but a larger, fluffier head would make the appearance that much better. Scents of esters and phenols, big on banana and clove aromas, with notes of bubblegum and pear apricot with a faint sour tang and hints of biscuity malt faintly discernible I. The background. A very good aroma that captures the best of Belgian yeast. Taste begins with a nice hit of fruity flavors with notes of citrus and lemon peel with a moderate undercurrent of phenolic white pepper and clove spiciness and some biscuity malt keeping the flavor soft at the start. This moves into a moderately bitter middle with notes of pear and lemon peel and more pronounced phenolic spiciness with some floral and spicy hop flavors. Finish is dry with notes of spicy phenolic clove and white pepper yeast and lemon peel and a moderate level of hop bitterness and earthy hop flavors. Aftertaste is white pepper and clove with moderate lemon peel-like bitterness. A very nice, fairly complex flavor profile that highlights the best aspects of Belgian Pale Ales with an increased hop bite. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a slightly chalky, drying feel. Very nice, refreshing and easy to drink. Overall this is a good example of a Belgian Pale Ale that combines the best of Belgian yeast aromas and flavors with a nice, higher level of hop character than is normal and a refreshing mouthfeel to make a very drinkable beer. Very well done.","Auraan","Jul 18, 2014"
