"Great beer! Good color and great taste! Would definitely recommend."
"Tasty Belgian style. Amazing floral bouquet. Finish is a bit lacking. Very drinkable."

"Sharp Hoppy notes combined with 3 different hops make this a fine Belgian  IPA"
""
""

"Love this mix of styles. Flavor skews Belgian as it warms."

"Whoa whoa whoa... got to pull back the reins on this one.. big Belgian flavor and American hops jam packed into one beer....crazy"
"Just not a fan of Belgian ales in general....."
"Transparent light amber body with a thick cream colored head. Aroma is of toasted malts, white pepper and a dash of citrus. Flavor is malty and yeasty with a peppery profile and some nice fruity flavors of white grape. Feel is bready and yeasty, tastes fuller than your average 6.8% BPA. Overall a nice Americanized take on the style."

"O: Solid offering from Revolution.  The ABV can sneak up on you due to the beerâ€™s high level of drinkability.  Highly recommend for fans of Belgian beers as well as hopheads.  This beer can appeal to many palates."
"Overall impression:  A firmly Belgian, American hopped ale.  Immensely enjoyable and poundable.  I'm biased as I love this brewery and this is another solid offering."

"Too aromatic for my taste with strong citrus notes"

"I love Belgians and I like pale ales, but this beer isn't really a great specimen of either. Probably refreshing during the summer, but not the best fit for this cold February day."
""
""
"Overall I'm pretty happy with this beer and I actually would consider getting more of it. Nearly almost being a double ipa it still manages to be very sessionable when its really cold. Would recommend to anyone looking for a citra fix!"
""
"Great beer. Can't go wrong!"

"Too dark a beer for my taste"

"solid belgo pale ale seasonal release."
""
""
""
"Overall, I thought this beer was going to be a hop bomb by the aroma, but it was balanced to say the least.  Interesting hodge-podge of flavor here, I would recommend this to fans of American/Belgian ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely drinkable, clean, very aromatic with Belgian and hop qualities. A little on the dry side which makes for a nice mouth feel. Overall very nice but a little too hoppy for a Belgian ale style if you ask me."
""
""
"This is a very good beer. The server told me this was a Belgian beer, but it doesn't taste that way. More of a hoppy pale ale.  Delicious, so good I had 5.  Thanks Revolution!"
""
""
""
""
"I love this take on a pale ale; great fragrance and taste.  This is a new favorite."
""
""
"Bright, fragrant, red berry-driven nose, great color with tight, fine foam, flavors of lemon and brioche with a buttery, rich, textured finish."
""
""
""
""
"Revolution continues to blow me away.This is an outstanding brew. I've always bee a sucker for Citra + Belgian Style yeast, but this ""Pale"" goes above and beyond. Crazy."
""
""
"It's a tasty brew.  I have to admit beer prior to this (different brands) kind of sucked, so this was really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of hops but also malts and some spices as well, love revolution brews!"
""

"Belgian style? There is nothing belgian style about this beer. It is much darker than any true BPA would be, the head is weaker than a unic's sex drive, and there is no hint at all of the floral notes and effervescence associated with belgian ales and yeast. With that being said, this is a decent AMERICAN style pale ale. It is completely drinkable, with complex and balanced hop character that everyone is used to by now with the ridiculous amount of APAs out there brewed by craft breweries in the US."

""
"Get it on tap if you can.  Never would have even thought to try this style of beer until I tried this one.  Beautiful, almost perfume-like aroma.  Earlier batch in a bomber wasn't as good."

"I seem to be going against the grain here but I really didn't like this beer. I drank it straight from the can, so I'm sure that didn't help (although I thought the Eugene porter from Revolution held up pretty well in a can, but this beer is more delicate I suppose). It tasted very thin and highly carbonated, with a sweet/sour kick (I guess that's the fruity elements and the funky elements). Would not buy again."
"O-An easy drinker with nice tropical fruit and malt backbone."
""
""
"O - An interesting brew and worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall this a very affordable and drinkable and excellent brew. I home-brewed a clone that's conditioning at the moment so I can't wait to try it!! We used magnum, citra and cascade hops. Our tribute to a great example of the style, and a great brewery too. Viva the Revolution!"

"Pour is bright amber orange with a tight white head. Nose has a fair bit of resin hop up front, light yeast notes with a fair bit of spice and tang. A good bit of sweet juicy citrus and faint grassy hop in the back. Taste is a bit sweet, light tangy yeast with a hint of spice, loads of pine and resin with a touch of citrus and some grassy bitterness through the finish but light. Body is syrupy and full, softer carbonation."

"Overall: An absolutely wonderful brew. Will go back to this one again and again. Insanely drinkable with so much going on. Love the combination of this being a traditional american pale with a great belgian base. Revolution is absolutely killing it right now."

"Overall: Not much I can fault this beer on, maybe if they DID add some hibiscus, this one would really pop. Love this one, will be buying a lot more."
"This beer pours hazy orange/gold with a thick frothy head and leaves a nice thin lacing on glass. It smells of grassy and floral hops with hits of grapefruit and lemon. The taste is pretty much the same but very hoppy with hints of honey? Overall great beer!"

"Active carbonation supports both the flowing smoothness and the crispness of this lighter style of which this beer verges into stronger territory by achieving a medium body. It's about semi-dry most of the way into an easy finish."

"O: I really like this, especially for $5, so much so my score may not do it justice. Complex, a bit different and very tasty. I would definitely consider this a must-try, really well made"
"O: a well-done and and refreshing Belgian-style pale ale. Very drinkable and rather aromatic for style."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of peach, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, banana, tangerine, pear, apple, floral, grass, clove, pepper, light pine, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great citrus/tropical hop complexity with a moderate yeast and malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big peach, pineapple, mango, tangerine, banana, lemon zest, orange zest, clove, pepper, pine, floral, grass, bread, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy tartness and spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, pineapple, citrus zest, banana, clove, pepper, pine, floral, grass, light honey, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop and yeast flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian pale ale! All around great balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"overall its hard for me to score. real real sweet, which isnt my thing, but the flavor is exactly how the brewers intended it to be IMO. see what you think."
"Overall - Quite tasty. The tropical fruit and tartness work very well."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a damn well done Belgian!"
""
""
""
""
""
"DELICIOUS; GRAB A BOTTLE!"
""
"Overall: Other than the aggressive aftertaste, this beer brings a nice combination of IPA and Wit flavors"
"good looking beer, golden color w/nice white head and lacing. nose is funky and lemony w some dank fruityhops underneath. taste is quite sour-perhaps if i was expecting this i could have scored it higher? is this an awa? puckering lemon leads to an aspirin like light bodied mouthfeel."
""
""
"The A Little Crazy Ale from revolution is ok. The beer poured a fairly clear copper with thin white head that is not leaving a lace. The scent definitely has Belgian style pale al all over it. The taste has the Belgium white flare with a subtle hop. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer...but I am not a huge fan of Belgium style pale ales."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel has a vinigar like stickiness that is cut by a Belgian dry finish that both last well after it is swallowed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, small hops but watery. In the taste, dry hops, a yeasty presence, and just a touch fruity. A nice hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer mellow hop and yeast presence in the aftertaste. A bit thin, nice hops, and a small yeasty fruit presence."

"I was pleasantly surprised but this one, I'd never heard of it and loved it from start to finish. Big citra notes with a mellow Belgian twist, I'd be drinking this often I I could buy it in my part of the world"
""
"Subtly sweet yeast, dry citrus zest, faint juicy fruits, banana, little bit of hop bite... smooth and drinkable."
""
""

"really surprised by this one, a really damn good hoppy american style belgian ale. has all the characteristics of a west coast ipa, with a belgian yeasty taste in the background."

"12oz can, pours a deep, golden color with a frothy, eggshell head that fades rather quickly leaving some lacing on the glass. Fruity and juicy nose with plenty of citrus, especially orange rind, some bready malt, and yeast. Fresh tasting with more orange and citrus, juicy, caramel, bready, Belgian yeast. Medium body, ample carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I would buy it again. It was both refreshing and complex with nice balance of flavors."

"Strong earthy bitterness from the start and only a little fruity yeast to attempt to balance it out. Add some malty crackers to the mix, but hops still dominate most of the flavor profile. Mild resiny palate. This is one hoppy BPA, just a little too hoppy to be on my session list though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A better than average Belgian style pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a nice combination of spice and hops, slight malty sweetness. I strongly prefer this over anti hero, last batch was too vegetative, this just pops."
""
""
"A handsome yellow pale ale was poured from the can into a glass with a bright white head. Noting the bubbles, the ale was aggressively carbonated while leaving lacing on the sides of the glass. In the aroma, it smells quite biscuity with mild Earthy notes. In the initial taste, the beer is citrusy, with notes of yeast, biscuit, and mild pine. The carbonation does not allow the initial taste to linger for a significant duration. In the aftertaste, it evolves into a more dry taste with hints of grape skin and biscuit. At this point, this is mild favorite from revolution being an easy drinker with a complex taste."

"(O)- For the style, this is quite nice. Easy drinking and lightly crisp without pummeling your palate with a hop or yeast bomb. Would be a great beer for spring/summer time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In addition: Tried it out of a can and really liked it. +.25 on the score for that."
""
""
""
"It pours darker than a BPA and clearer, with little head or lace. The aroma is mild for an American style but just right for authentic style. The taste is over the top yeasty and hoppy, as mentioned before, American. The aftertaste as well. Compared to those other over the top Americans, this one is pretty well balanced, but it is very tasty. The aftertaste is tart and yeasty and bitter. Pretty darn good."
""
""
"O: Fantastic beer. So glad it's in cans. Need to stock up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly worth a BUY."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a ""perfect pint glass"". It looked very nice, a lighter amber color with only .25-.5 inch of off-white head, crystal clear. The smell was also very nice, mostly malt with some slight spice, not much hops. Taste and mouthfeel were very good. It wasn't overly sweet despite the aroma, with a medium-light mouthfeel. I felt it was very well balanced and an easy drink. I'll definitely have it again. It's a nice change of pace from the hop bombs that are so prevalent today."
""
""
""
"O - A really nice easy drinking belgian pale ale, it is not a standout beer, but it also doesn't have anything working against it. I would gladly drink this beer again if it was offered to me, not something I would typically drink, but a solid and enjoyable beer."
"O- This beer goes excellent with any food. However on it's own it lacks complexity and some more flavor. Really expecting more aromatics also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really nice belgian Pale ale. Didnt blow the doors off, but really solid all around. nice local beer made by revolution!"
"(A little) crazy drinkable! Only complain is lack of a head :/ way to go Revolution."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a nice big pale ale with a good balance of fruity yeast character and hops. It is very drinkable but the carbonation is a bit to big as it opens up."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great Belgian pale ale or Belgian IPA. Awesome hop aroma."
"i could drink this all day"
""
""
"O: A great BPA with a distinct american edge."
"Poured into tulip glass. Appearance is bright, clear, golden, and pale. Thin white head collar with minimal head present. Some lacing is there. Aroma features a happy combo of American c-hops and Belgian yeast with an emphasis on the former. Notes of mango, grapefruit sit atop delicate Belgian esters. This brew drinks like an IPA: fresh, hoppy,, and crisp... only difference is that Belgian twinge at the end. This provides a touch of spice that pairs well with residual hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, I am again fully satisfied with yet another Revolution product. If you haven't sought these guys out, what are you waiting for?"
""
"D - This was a nice hoppy Belgian, and it was easy to get through most of the bomber on my own. Hope this is a regular bottled offering from Revolution, as I like it more than the Wit and the Saison."
"O: This is a very well balanced and very approachable BPA. Personally, I'd prefer it to be a bit more aggressive, but I imagine this was brewed to be a ""gateway"" beer."
"22oz bomber, pours dark orange, smell is slightly hoppy not overwhelming. Taste is complex, layered, fantastic. Great beer. I'm really starting to like this new niche, Belgium Style Pale ales. It's the best of american and UK methods to make such a diverse style."
"Time for dinner, so I might as well give this Belgian-y guy a go. He pours a mostly clear sunset amber-gold topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, grapefruit zest, mild pine sap, light pineapple, light black pepper, and a touch of what seems to be passion fruit. The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine is a bit more assertive, and the Belgian yeast kicks in a bit more, adding some mild notes of black pepper, clove, and cardamom, while also bringing out some of the more lemon-y tones from the hops. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice BPA, with some tastily bright hops, but I do kinda wish the Belgian yeast were more prominent. Oh well, it works well enough now..."
""
""
"Resiny orange zest, hop oils, creamy smooth feel with lasting moderate bitterness. Orange flavors, light tropical character also. Dry resiny aftertaste. Fruit forward and plenty bitter, fairly yeasty but doesn't eclipse the hop showcase."
"a really damn good belgian pale by rev. I hope they do this one more often as it is really good"
"This is my first review, will get better with the details in the future."
