"Fatty pours a golden color with a small head.  There is a yeasty toasty aroma with big banana notes.  The taste is similar, big banana notes, toasty and yeasty.  Nice full taste, good body.  Overall its a fruity bpa."

"A solid belgian style ale but far from my favorite."

"Furthermore Fatty Boombalatty ---3.5/5"

"look for it again when we are in Wisconsin next time."

"Taste is a little grainy, sweet, Belgian hops and some citrus bite. I would like this beer more if there was less grain. Mouth feel is good with plenty of carbonation. Overall a decent beer but could use some work."

"O- A nice twist on a Belgian Pale Ale that is refreshing to drink."
""
""
""
"A good drinking pale ale/tripel. Americanized somewhat, but enjoyable. Let's have one more."
""
""
""
""
"I think I have to downgrade my rating (4.28, 8/2013) on this.  I don't remember this tasting so much like a tripel, and I mostly don't like tripels."
""
"Overall Drinkability: Not quite Blue Moon on steroids. More like Blue Moon on vitamin B12. Still it's an improvement over the former."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a good Belgian Ale. Nice one from Furthermore."
""
""
"O-Very sessionable for the ABV goes down more like a pale ale than a 7% beer"
""
""
""
""
"Mixing in the sediment from the bottom: Aroma is much more subdued. Color becomes straw. Hop flavor becomes much more intense; bubblegum flavor is much reduced. Overall, the sediment smoothes it out quite nicely, I'd bump it up a few points if you haze it up."
""
""
"O- good beer with nice Belgian yeast notes."
""
""

"O - Pretty damn good beer. It would make a great session brew when I want something with some serious flavor."
""
""
""
"Hazy pale yellow in color. Served in a standard pint glass with about a half inch of creamy thick white head. Copious lacing. Aroma is all Belgian with notes of banana and spice with citrus hops to a lesser extent. Flavor is pretty good and while the yeast is present its not nearly as strong as the aroma. Mild sweetness, bubblegum, lemon, citrus, and some yeasty esters. Lighter body, actually a bit thin. Overall quit nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M. Somewhat on the heavier side of medium thickness, but smooth and even slightly creamy in feel nonetheless because of the well-calibrated carbonation levels."
""
""
"Overall - This was an excellent beer with a mixture of different flavors that fell into place very well. Not the best Belgian Ale I've tried but this one is definitely up there!"
"Pours a hazy pale orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, orange citrus, coriander, and a nice alcohol presence. In the taste, coriander, orange juice citrus, a small alcohol note and somewhat peppery. A smooth and a medium bodied moouthfeel, with a dry spice with a small citrus in the aftertaste. A bit boozy and peppery, and somewhat all over the place in the taste."
"A nice American-style Belgian, and at 7.20% ABV is a good option if you want a lighter beer but with significant punch."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits, yeast, spice. Taste is bursting with flavor. Lots of spice, some fruits, yeast, very flavorful. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a top notch beer worth seeking out."

"Bottle from O'Reilly's. Orange tinged body with a token head, and a few drops only of lace are later left. Yeast with some fruit and spice aroma. Above average mouthfeel but also aggressively carbonated. Good drinkability, corriander and pepper, and secondary fruit and tanginess. Decent take on the style."
"O - An interesting Belgian pale ale with heavy witbier spicing. Cutting back on the spicing would help this one out, but it is still pretty enjoyable."
"Overall, this tastes to me like a strong saison. I know the whole point of this beer is that it really fits no specific category but thats the flavor profile I'd compare this beer to. The spice flavor is dominant, a result of the belgian yeast and extra hops. Not at all a bitter beer though. Lots of different flavors blend together in this beer."
"This ale pours fairly clear deep golden color with a sticky white head. The aroma is a burst of fruity esters, a lot of banana, as well as some citrus and hints of clove, inviting. The flavor is dominated by fruity esters, a lot like banana bread, with some cloves, and tropical fruits. These flavors are balanced out by some spicy hop flavor and moderate-low hop bitterness. The beer finishes slightly dry with just a bit of lingering yeast character. The body is medium and carbonation medium-full. Overall a nicely made beer, refreshing, yet still interesting, worth a try."
"Totally unique flavor. I don't know if this would get tiresome, but it's a cute new playmate."
"They brew I made needed less coriander, less wheat and more citrus. When I add a squeeze of lemon, it is better. This beer has the detergent like perfume odor and taste too. Just not for me I guess."
"Not great but worthy of a try. Possibly needs to be cold cellared to improve it a bit. It is tough to compare American Belgians against the likes of Westmalle and Chimay."
"This beer has a pretty cool name, makes me think of the one line from the Bloodhound Gang song You're Pretty When I'm Drunk but anyway, this beer pours out as a golden yellow color with a fluffy white head. The smell has an average Belgian aroma to it. The taste has a decent bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side. The overall on this beer is that it's an average beer but not something I'd rave about."
"Overall: Very nice complex and refreshing... something. Not a typical Belgian at all, as it resembles a Hefeweizen more than the claimed base Witbier. Regardless, it is delicious, and perfect when a stronger Summer seasonal is desired."
"O: A very complex and tasty Belgian Pale Ale. Very refreshing and perfect for the summer heat and humidity."
"Pours a bright peach color with a really nice two-finger white head. Good lacing as it goes down and a thin collar stays along for the ride. The nose brings some light bready malt as well as a light floral aroma and a bit of earth and spice. Flavor has mild malt sweetness plus a bit of a hop presence. Yeast kicks in with some mild spice toward the finish. Really light, yet creamy, mouthfeel that is the highlight of the beer for me. Nicely done. Thanks again, Andy."
"Good-the aroma is awesome, and the alcohol is expertly hidden. However, the flavor tastes like there's just a little too much going on. The belgian yeast along with the high-ish hop rates makes the flavor a little muddy. Still very drinkable and pretty solid, but not spot on."
"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a quickly receding white head. Spicy aroma with light fruits. Banana bread taste, with some citrus coming through; yeasty, and some dry spice. Medium body, and moderately drinkable. I need to revisit this one."
"Drinkability is okay, it's a clean brew, the ABV is well disguised, but the esters are unapologetic. I'm a big fan of Bavarian esters, but they're not for everyone...."
"O-Interesting in that it tastes like a Hefe-Weisse meets a Belgian Pale Ale-worth a taste-a decent beer from Furthermore."
"This to me is a summer beer. It's abv is too high for it to be a session, but that doesn't bother me in the least. Worthy of a six pack purchase. Not my go to brew but a descent change of pace."
"D: Very nice WI version of a Belgian style. I could have more than a few, the 7.2% ABV is very well hidden. Excellent Summer brew and worth checking out."
"Pours a hazy orange red color with a thick fizzy white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells of banana, coriander, wheat, and some citrus. Tastes of banana, wheat, orange, and some spices. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty nice."
"Brownish gold in color and cloudy. Large but inactive prickle bubbles and small active ones. Light rim of foam and some lacing. Banana dominant nose with just a whiff of wheat. Smooth sweet attack that is consistent with the nose. Some pleasant banana tones imparted by the yeast. Nice wheat flavors, just about right. The hops comes on strong towards the finish and leaves little burn in the aftertaste the alcohol helps to enhance. Pretty decent as far as summer beers fo. Some mild sour notes."
"I think this is one of the better American interpretations of a Belgian style ale. It drinks closer to those than some of the usual ""belgian style"" ales that come more like lagers or weak ales than anything else. Low ABV's (well, relatively) keep this drinkable though some may find it too carbonated."
"D) Really good. Kept going back for more! Was not sure of the ABV (not marked on bottle) and did feel the 7% after a while but didn't taste it."
"D - Ehh. It's OK but really I just wanted to try it since it was the only new beer on my shelf at my local sixer place. I wasn't in love with it but it was pretty drinkable for a Belgium. Wish this was in the variety case rather than that crappy ""Make Weight"""
"(D)- A good belgain from the states. A tad stronger even for the style, but its smoothness helps."
"Nice variety of aromas and flavors, but nothing spectacular about this one. I'd have it again, but given the variety of BPAs out there, I'd try something different."
"D-a little messy and has some flaws. overall it isn't band, the phenol flavor lingers for me a bit too long but the bitterness balance to the fruit and floral esters is quite interesting."
"Appears a clouded golden orange apricot tone with a large white head, lacing is fine and intricate. Aroma has a mix of citrus/clove/anise and American hops. Also some tropical fruits mango/pineapple character going on in there. Flavor blends a heavily spiced wit with a big Belgian golden ale, over ripened banana and pineapple juice with bitter citrus pith accented hops an heavy with coriander and a touch of anise. Pretty intense experience I can feel and taste the booze I would guess even a bit higher than the seven percent it actually is. Mouthfeel is a bit cloying at times between the layers of spices that stick to the palate between sips and the aggressive hop profile, it's just a bit sticky on the palate with some residual sugars. Carbonation is ample no complaints on that but those spices make me want to brush my teeth. Drinkability overall is decent a strong aggressive interesting hybrid ale another uniquely American take on a classic style, gotta love our no rules attitude when it comes to brewing."
"Pours a cloudy hazy golden color that is darker on top and lighter on the bottom with a one finger head which gives way to skim with a moderate amount of lacing present. The aroma is of a bubble gum smell with hints of lemon, corriander, and a floral hop. The taste has a big rich bubblegum like flavor, rounded out by floral hops with hints of lemon. The mouthfeel is dry and low to moderate carbonation. I would say the drinkability is good, its an inviting aroma with a big smooth flavor that keeps you coming back."
"Overall I've had this on tap and it seemed much more balanced. For now this is my review. If I find it again on tap I will have to revise my scores if I see fit."
"Pours a slightly hazed gold color with highly active carbonation, leaving a big cap of soapy whit ehead, decent retention. Scent is a huge whiff of peppery belgian yeasts and spices such as corriander, a light citrus and wheaty background round out the nice scent. The first sip is an almost cloying bite of the corriander and peppery yeast, the malts come across as quite sweet (almost bubblegum like) for containing such a large portion of wheat and a muddled citrus flavor is present throughout. Medium bodied, highly carbonated, dry finnish and a touch of burn. An interesting beer that tends to overdo some of its ingredients."
"D: VERY quaffable, almost too easy to drink at 7.2%! Haven't heard much about this brewery, but, picked up this single while up north last month. I will certianlly make sure I get more of this gem!!"
"I'm pretty sure Furthermore brewing just moved into the Pittsburgh area, as I just started seeing their beers pop up around town. Fatty Boombalatty was a nice introduction to the brewery for me, as it is a pretty good Belgian. Also (or Furthermore), it looks like the pricing for their beers are great, as a case of this beer was right around $35 when I spotted it at the beer distributor."
"D - This brew packs an unexpected punch of goodness! I heard good things but didn't expect this. Very nicely done and deliciously drinkable, I may have to pick up some more Fatty!"
"Drinkability: An average American Belgian style ale. Worth the try."
"I don't mind coriander, but it dominated this for me. For once I feel like a beer could be a bit more diluted, as this was sticky sweet coriander."
"D - Quite flavorful and complex as a Belgian should be...alcohol level is middle of the road at 7.2% - not very detectable at all in the flavor, but I'm feeling it a bit (2nd beer of the night). Not my favorite Belgian pale...but a pretty good example and glad to have a chance to try this one. Maybe one of the greatest names in all of beer."
"d: Unique and delicious. I've tried 2 from these guys now and really liked both, this one in particular."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, corinander, bready, with some slight pepper notes. The taste is slighlty sweet, yeasty, with a nice malt note, bready, corinander, and some pepper. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice BPA."
"D - goes down nicely, but forces you to take your time."
"d-nice beer. Seems to not know what it wants to be. Esters are a bit high and the beer could be drier, but it still tastes nice."
"It's a cross between a hefe, an IPA and a Belgian pale and it's definitely drinkable though probably lacking the heft to be a serious Belgian pale."
"pours a hazy very cloudy orange color, with little to no head and very very lite carbonation. it had much of a citrus type very spicey feel to it. reminds me very much of spring houses robot bastard ipa. very delicious beer that i was pleasantly surprised with and enjoyed a lot from begining to end."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it was a pretty nice flavored and easy drinking beer. Not what I expected for something listed as Belgian pale but still a pretty good beer."
"D - A good pale, but wit characteristics in the spice profile make it interesting -it is hard to rate to one style but the citric zing and high carbonation leans toward double wit w/ a peppery end. It drinks very well for either style though and for its abv"
"Boombalatty has a apricot orange color and a weak head that reached an inch before lowering into nothing. No lace from this one. This pretty much smells like orange jolly ranchers mixed with some fruity yeast. Tastes of oranges apricots and some cereal like tastes. Hops are not really in the picture. The feel is between light and medium with some carb, nothing to exciting, goes down smooth but kinda dead. I could see going for one of these in the summer, but would not seek it out on the regular."
"D- its was allright not the best I've had for the style but pretty solid. Really improved as it warmed up."
"I like the effort here from Furthermore, with a Belgian Pale Ale that packs a lot of power and flavor into a rather steady sipping package. I'm glad I picked a bottle of this up."
"D: Very tasty, though so close to New Glarus Crack'd Wheat in the same market that I'd buy NGCW instead. The main difference is FBFB has more banana/arugula flavor."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of Belgian yeast, spice, anise, and leather. The taste is like the aroma, but with more anise. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could drink again."
"This one goes down easy but the upfront and lingering sweetness make it a special once in a while treat."
"I like they beer they made. I want more with something lightly spicy. Rabbit braised with mustard or some curried leg of lamb."
"Very high carbonation, slightly aggressive on the palate but it gets better as some CO2 escapes from the beer."
"Murky golden pour with a nice head that recedes down to a collar. Smell is clove up front, but with a little swirling to breathe an awesome bouquet of citrus and spices comes to the forefront. Taste is a bit more watery that I would hope based on the nose, but is still pretty smooth and satisfying. Mostly light bready malts and faint hints of spices. Medium bodied with a tiny bit of prickly carbonation, this one is decent and worth trying at least once but don't go out of your way."
"I knew going into this that this was the brewerys most popular beer. In my mind, it didn't disappoint. I liked this a lot."
"Great two finger head thtat recedes to a nice, super thick foam which leaves a soft lacing. Lets not forget the eruption of bubbles rising to the top of this froth-monster amdist a hazey sunshine amber. The aroma has some spicey, white peppery, hop notes with candi sugar and some yeasty and wheat banana fruits. The taste starts with hot bananas. That 7.2% abv giving the bananas that ""hot"" twang. The middle is a little more mellow, but the heat still lingers with the fruity yeast and sugary malt. The finish i warm, sweet, and a little metallic, but still good."
"D- I love this beer a lot and that is why it saddens me that it is only seasonal and will be disappearing soon. It has a high ABV but you cannot even notice it and that is what makes this such a ""dangerously drinkable Belgian"" as they say. This a more of a Belgian strong pale/wit hybrid than a stand alone strong pale."
"drinkability is great. just enough hops to compliment the base beer and keep it nicely balanced and drinkable. this would be a great beer to sit out on the patio and drink all afternoon."
"D - Pretty good beer overall considering the amount of alcohol, which went undetected by me. However, the ingredients of wheat, coriander, banana and hops could be better balanced by a more subtle carbonation level to bring out some of these characteristics better. Aside from that I could have one or two in a sitting."
"single scooped from Riley's in Madison and foamed back to NoVA"
"D - Good because it would be something that I could drink regulary but would not be the first thing I would reach for."
"Pours a hazy golden color. Nice mix of yellow and orange, and I can't tell if it's chill haze, or just haze, but I think it's a bit of yeast haze, because it didn't really clear up throughout the drink, but I can still see through the beer. The head is thin and white, not very dense, but it actually stays around a bit and leaves a little lacing. Kind of normal for the belgian pale style. The smell has a few dominant characteristics, all of which are interesting. First, there's a kind of fruity, sugary, bubble gum flavor, partially from nice fruity esters, and partially from the candy sugar (I assume) that gets used in this one, but it's really powerful in the nose at first. That subsides to a deep spiciness, I mean really spicy, earthy and pungent, herbal, kind of leafy, almost like burning leaves, with a hint of grass clippings. You can really smell a bit of malty sweetness, not quite bready, but sweet, mixed in with a bit of yeasty tartness. The taste starts out like chewing on fruity gum, thanks to some esters and a bit of sweetness, but that falls back quickly into this sticky, earthy taste. The malt comes in, a bit toasty and crackery, but there's this uncontrollable earthy spiciness in there. It's just herbal, leafy, and almost burnt with the hops and the spicy yeast combining - the yeast is actully a bit tart as well as spicy, somewhere between Saison yeast and Belgian Pale yeast. The malt presence comes in at different intervals, like cookies, and also a bit like powdery, starchy grains in different places. There's also a bit of a burnt sugar type taste to it. Overall, it's really a great Belgian Pale, perhaps leaning the furthest towards that earthy spiciness of any I've ever had. The body is actually very sticky and full from the malt and hops combining. The carbonation is nice and lively, crisp, and accented by the moderate dryness of the beer. The only thing is that the earthiness can wear on you thanks to that dryness, but I really find myself enjoying it. Not the easiest to drink, it's actually a bit challenging, though thoroughly enjoyable. I would definitely buy it again, but could not make it a beer I drink often, despite how much I enjoy it. I would recommend to anyone."
"Pours a super cloudy and chunky orange/yellow, like yogourt, thick white head forms, slowly settles down to a thick ring around the glass, some lace chunks. Smell is neat, lots of banana and orange peel, some floral, wheat, yeasty, very fruity, pineapple, touch of apple cider sweetness, very neat. Taste is nice too, orange, sharp and citric, yeasty, lots of light fruit, toasted wheat, banana and spice, some bitterness in the finish, very cool. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy mouthfeel, medium to high carbonation, very refreshing for the ABV. Not sure what style this is, almost like a weizenbock/pale ale hybrid or something, weird but very enjoyable."
"Pretty good drinkability. The higher carbonation gives a fuller feeling when drinking this for me. Two of these would be about the max for myself."
"Drinkability is good. Basically a fusion of a Belgian Pale Ale and a Hefeweizen. Not bad though."
"Drinkability is a quandry. I like this one a lot, and with just a bit less yeast I think it'd be a solid 4.5. But the yeast is just a bit over the top, both in the taste and mouthfeel. Pull that back, let the hops really shine and this is a well above average beer."
"This is a pretty good US Belgian beer. Kind of an amped up hefeweizen flavor and feel. Had an interesting mix of spice flavors and enough sweetness to keep it balanced. Worth a try."
"Drinkability - Since this was one of the free beer options at the wedding reception I was at (the other was Coors Light on tap, no thanks), I did a nice session with several of these and liked them quite a bit. Will look for this one again."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a deep golden orange with a white head. Aroma of fruity esters. Medium bodied with sweet malt and citrus flavors up front, but then finished with a strong, warming alcohol flavor. Not really the most pleasant finish for a beer in my opinion. I might give this another try in the future."
"D- if the ABV is really over 7%, furthermore did a world class job of hiding it. it could sneak up on you if you had a bunch in a single night. definitely interesting. check it out."
"D: Filling and refreshing at the same time. This beer is unique compared to others I've had. I can definitely see myself enjoying more of these! A solid beer, for sure."
"I would place it at the top of my best of summer seasonal list..."
"This is a bright-yellow colored beer, with a modest head on it. The aroma is fairly nice, fruity, with a nice perfumy scent. Very nice flavor! Hugely coriander, with a bitter citrusiness. Somewhat similar to Celis' Grand Cru--all the flavors of wit, but stronger, with a good tart, phenolic edge."
"pours a nice sunset yellow color with a huge belgian head that dissipates just right and leaves great lacing and a nice ring..the smell is fruit full..its a blast of apples pears and peaches followed by the mandatory clove..its fantastic cant wait to drink it..the taste is all summertime sit on the back porch take it easy...its all fruit up front then some hops and wheat and nice sour yeast with a clove finish..fantastic..the mouthfeel is a perfect balance between sweet and sour.. this beer is fantastic..highly recommended.. this is summertime"
"Overall I feel like next to maybe one other American-made Belgian style this is the absolute best I've had. Seriously this beer is extremely complex, superbly balanced between sweet and spicy, the carbonation is perfect, drinkability is off the charts, and I'd say it is almost every bit as good as Duvel. I'm not afraid to go against convention when it is warranted, and for sure it is in this case. As soon as I'm done with the 6-pack I know I will want more."
"D- an OK belgian, definitely better ones out there"
"This is a very strange brew but I made peace with that and decided that I love it. Appearance is well, clearly unfiltered, color of banana runts. Smell is nice, like pineapple with a touch of hops. Taste really opens this one up. Lots of different citrus fruit esters. Some floral hops on the back and may be a hnt of beligan candy. Mouthfeel and drinkability are out of this world good. Drinks easy but very thick and unfiltered."
"I must say that this is a fantastic surprise. I like it a lot. Very drinkable, very tasty, just very good across the board. I don't know that this fits perfectly into any style guideline but it's really tasty. I actually was searching for reasons not to rate it so highly, but I could not find them. This is one I'd love to have in my fridge with regularity."
"This is almost certainly a beer that is best consumed fresh. Once those hops begin to fade, the yin and the yang will suffer a bit. After all, yin without yang isn't nearly as good. Fatty Boombalatty is da bomb... and Furthermore is an underappreciated gem."
"This was one, tasty beer. Lots of complexity to the taste, with fruit, yeast, wheat and a nice amount of bitter to balance things quite nicely. It sure is unfiltered! It's a thick, peach color with a good head. Good mouthfeel and medium plus carbonation. Worth looking for this brew."
"Really quite nice effort here, could keep some around if it was available in IL, thanks to Mr. Quartetman for this one."
"For an American brewery that doesn't necessarily speciallize in Belgian beer, not bad at all."
"D- It is a little bit sweet for a session beer, but it really is a nice beer to sip on. It has a lot going on for the style, and a great attempt by an American brewery to brew a Belgian style ale."
"Overall I feel like this is a pretty damn good belgian style ale. It might be a tad high in alcohol because it's not hidden terribly well. There is nothing outstanding about it but it's just a solid effort. I would have it again."
"Light to medium bodied, fairly carbonated which actually gives it a refreshing quality, although truthfully it tasted better as the beer warmed and the carbonation died down a bit. The alcohol is hidden fairly well, but after a few of these you would certainly feel it. This is something I'd like to drink again. All in all, this is a great Belgian pale ale from Furthermore."
"D: I liked this enough to have 3 or 4 per sitting. I enjoyed it wuite a bit!"
"D - All the time brew. Really love it as it feels light like a $15 a case beer, but gets you messed and tastes like a crafty goodie....Snack Snack Snack"
"D: This is a very enjoyable night cap. Not sure i'd session it, definitely not at the ABV."
"Balance, schmalance, call it a train wreck if you want, but I totally dug the complexity and lack of overwhelming sweetness I've experienced with other Belgians. Actually nothing overwhelmed anything else so I'd have to say there is a nice balance here in a rather chaotic way. Hmmm, I think I might be starting to get this whole Belgian thing."
"crisp taste...hops evident...lemongrass, chamomile...finishes dry. burst of lemony hop flavor which is nice with the spice taste. good malty backend...big mouthfeel of spice & hops. lingering chamomile and malty goodness."
"It was a nice. I could sip on this all night."
"A read of the beers' description at their official site explains the complex tastes. Good beer that started out better than it ended."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a small head and no lacing. Not much in the way of aroma on this one. A bit of candied sugar, some caramel, and a little yeastiness. Taste is on cue with the aroma. Candy sugar, a bit of apple, slightly spicey, and a dry yeasty finish. A bit thin on the tongue, carbonation was ample enough and overall pleasant to drink. A decent take on the style."
"D: The alcohol is well-hidden amongst the Belgian spices but that is not enough to salvage a spotty flavor."
"This beer very yeast-driven, in that most of the character is spun off the fermentation, not the grains and hops. In addition to the bubblegum are more spicy phenols plus red apple and white grape esters. The appearance is a hazy gold, similar to a hefeweizen, with a short white head. The body is also deceptively drinkable for a 7%+ beer. All things considered, this is a pretty good Belgian. Kudos to Furthermore, this stuff isn't easy."
"This is good....I just don't know what it is."
"With the high ABV, it might be hard to have several in a row, but it would certainly be tempting."
"A real good ale. I would of liked the lemon cut back a little to bring the other flavors out but it is still very flavorful. The high ABV cuts down on drinkability."
"Overall I though this was excellent. A style that is hard to master, but they proved they could do a damn good job at it. A classic in my book and I am very glad that I chose to seek this one out. Definitly a winner and I loved every minute of it."
"Nice cloudy orange color. An finger of lacy head that lingered for a while. Really liked the taste, more like a wheat ale on steroids. Like if Blue Moon had a bigger, stronger, hoppier brother. Good aftertaste with a little hop bitterness. Dangerously drinkable highly reccomend and will pick up again."
"Mouthfeel is nice and chewy, a little thicker than I was planning on, and it also has a nice carb. to it. I could have a couple of these, but the sweetness might get to me after that, but overall a good beer."
"D- This is an ok session beer with nothing to exciting about it. The hops don't seem to fit with the rest of the beer flavors and the dry malt flavor makes it a bit bland."
"D- pretty solid, and its pretty cheap, not a bad option for a belgian pale fix"
"Golden copper orange. Fluffy white cloud of froth graces the surface. Lacing is more than adequate. Sweet candy like aroma spliced with some peppery spice notes. Some doughball aromas as well. Flavor is o.k., but lacks the character and complexity to make it anything more than o.k. Sweetly malty. Slightly alcoholic. Peppery. Faint yeast esters. Body is medium or so. On the high end of the carbonation chart, but appropriate nonetheless. This is a decent drink."
"D: Not a bad beer at all, this could be a very good summer drinker. It doesn't stand out though."
"Overall: Nice bubblegum flavors mingled with fruit and yeast. Very nice flavors right from the start. I really liked it."
"Thin in the mouth with light, prickly carbonation. Slightest bit of metallic twang lingering. Overall lacking in herbal character from hops both aromatic and in flavor, but is well-rounded overall."
"Overall: finally, I like one of the Furthermore brews. Easily the best of the group I bought from France 44. Good solid Belgian ale with an interesting and somewhat complex taste. Cool name as well."
"D - This one goes down very easily. The best Furthermore beer I have tried so far."
"drinkability: high"
"(Served chilled, in a Westmalle chalice.)"
"The only thing to really point out that would ever need to be pulled back is the amount of yeast in this beer. Even decanting two thirds of the beer brought on the opaque look so swirling in the rest made no difference. All of the characteristics point right to Belgian White Ale even with the bigger bitterness here. All said and done this is an enjoyable Belgian-style ale with certainly more oomph (7.2% abv) compared to the typical Belgian White Ale."
"This is an impressive first stab at Belgian-stylings by a newish brewery. Kudos here."
"D - I'm quite impressed with this one. The brewers are doing everything right. The label simply defines it as a ""Belgian Style Ale"" with a bunch of other marketing fluff, so their intent is tough to pin down. I'd certainly pin it in the Saison / Belgian Pale Ale realm, if that's vague enough."
"D: Enjoyable for an American take on the Belgian Pale Ale. Went down leisurely and smooth. This was my first offering from Furthermore and I have to say I'm impressed."
"Probably not a true Belgian, but I'm choosing to think of this as creativity rather than inadequacy. The color is an intriguing translucent apricot, with a nice off-white head. A stream of fine bubbles rises throughout the time the beer is in the glass. It's ""very drinkable for the style," which I put in quotes only because it's getting to be a common comment from me -- but usually it's a negative, and here I find it to be a plus. Some nice spice and fruit notes -- I almost think there's some apricot to the taste, too, unless that's just the power of suggestion. A clean, lightly hoppy finish. All in all, I'm a little surprised to like this beer as much as I did, but it does have a nice balance of interesting flavors and drinkability."
"I'd love to find out more about the ingredients, and the abv, and maybe more...this is perhaps the most impressive and enjoyable brew I've tasted from these guys yet! Good job!"
"Good luck Furthermore."
"Drinkability/Overall: as others have noted, this is not a beer that strives for balance. Gobs of citrus, bubblegum and spice make for an intense experience, along with a seemingly hearty alcoholic content. Still a refreshing beer that felt pretty damn good on a hot, finals week May night."
"A hazy golden color with a small amount of very fine head, which dissipated quickly but left 2mm of very fine white bubbles. Aroma is slightly tripel-ish, with a fair amount of clove-iness (quite good). Flavor is very spicy and good...a lot of American Belgian ales taste slightly chemical-y or overdone, but this one did not. Mouthfeel was not flat, but was quite good and smooth. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: This is a little intense, very yeasty, somewhat boozy, and definitely hoppy. Its no balanced work of art. Thats for sure but it is a complex and exciting beer. I would think that age would help mellow it in a good way. At any rate, it is very strong and gives a great buzz."
"Hard to finish a 12 oz., glad I only had a single."
