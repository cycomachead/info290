"Wg. mnie jedyny jasny punkt Taras Boulba to piana. Tylko czy to wystarczy?. Jak ktoś potrzebuje ""odhaczyć"" to piwo, to i tak spróbuje. Jeśli masz wybór to kup coś innego."
"very light, similar to coors light.  super bitter but without any actual hop flavor.   over carbonated.  possibly a bad/old bottle?  pretty much undrinkable."
"Not a bad Belgian pale ale here, this has more hop flavor than many so credit where its due.  The nose is pungent and musty, body light and crisp, and flavor more or less balanced.  A beer I could session though it is slightly abrasive."

"The finish knocks this down a few pegs for me, however, up front is a nice hoppy pale ale."

"*Wheat malt and coarse-filtered (rather than bottle-conditioned) for sure."

"A bit hoppy but mainly bitter. Not particularly nice floral tones from the hops. A little boring. Just had a second bottle and it just really reminded me of PBR. Maybe I got a bad batch but I really didn't enjoy this."

"A generally agreeable BPA, one whose mantra of 'extra hoppy' is played out well enough, I suppose, for the conservative Brussels crowd, even if this reviewer is a little nonplussed. Easy to drink, the kind of beer that once you get through half of it, all the while relating it via words, you feel the urge to just say, fuck it, close the laptop, and sit back and enjoy it. I only mention this, because that doesn't happen very often."

"O: pretty damn tasty, lovely showcase of hop bitterness... heard this guy say he's more a fan of English ales, and it shows in this one... comes across as a sort of hybrid English bitter and small Saison... curious to try it over there - held up pretty well here"
"Again, huge hops seem to cover up some probably nice notes. Bravo on the hop-bomb, not so happy about the sacrificed flavours."

"whoa.... popped the cap and got a pilsner-y whiff of something akin to a French chick's armpits. gruff and growl-y aroma, very different indeed! hazy urine yellow, minor head but creamier with a more vigorous pour. bitter, but not traditionally hop-bitter... more like a pilsner/lager hop bitter. this is a hard brew to describe. Heineken/stella-like, low abv. worth a try but wouldn't purchase again..."
""

"This is a wonderful session or outside type ale. A slightly cloudy light straw color with a thick, frothy fine bubble egg shell head. The head slowly retreats with marvelous lace rings. The nose is bright and fruity with strong malt presence. A complex yeast starts off the taste. The mid point of the palate comes through with light malts and dusty grain. The end hits with mild hops. The feel is thin, light, crisp and high carbonation which equates to a fairly smooth finish. Tons of flavor, dry on the end. Go for this if you get the chance."
""
""
"Overall, I want to like this beer. So much, that i want to look past the seemingly overhopped bittering hops. But the bitterness simply detracts too much. Maybe if it was a little older, the bittering would fade and the flavors would mellow out."
""
""
"A refreshing and fairly light (in terms of body) pale ale."
""
"D- Decently drinkable brew. Not really my cup of tea but I don't mind it."

"A very interesting and flavorful Belgian pale ale. Spiciness and hop bitterness really standout."
""

"Feels odd drinking De La Senne now after all the time spent politely ignoring their presence when in Belgium, but sometimes its just takes time. Pale golden body - nice healthy head, little bid of sediment. A little bit of euroskunk at first whiff that departs quickly. High bitterness, light clean hoppiness, crisp yeast, a bit grainy. OK, but not something I'm likely to buy again. It may be 4.5%, but the dry bitterness limits its sessionability"
""
""
"Slightly hazed pale yellow color. Tight bright white head.Spicy yeast and and spicy, floral/herbal/earthy hop. Richer and silkier body than expected. Carbonation is very bright bu flatter than expected too. Dry semi-sweet fruits up front, taffy, some spice, extremely dry finish with some bitterness for balance. Pretty good, could use more bitterness, has a nice savory flavor to it though from the hop/yeast combination. A boldly flavored session ale."
""
""
"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of fairly high intensity, leading to a foamy (9/10) and slightly smooth/creamy (1/10) mouthfeel. Carbonation nears the border of fizziness, but never gets quite there, thankfully. Closes semi-dry, with light stickiness lingering on the palate and lips."
""
""
"I can't remember how much I paid for this bottle, but I fear it is a lot more than I'd hope for such a potentially perfect session ale. I'll definitely be trying to reproduce this in my own home brewery."
"A very original beer, a hoppy Belgian that worked amazingly well. Huge drinkability and very refreshing. It is like a mix of Witbier and Belgian IPA."
""

""

"Pours a cloudy lemon color with billowing dense white head. Foam settles slowly leaving big chunks behind. Smell: lemon peel, pils, spicy. Taste: lemon pie, intense grassy flavor, finishing with a blast of spiciness over more custard-like sweetness. Drying, hop strewn finish."
""
""

"Super lean, with some outrageous bitterness - makes XX Bitter look like a cream soda. There are little hints of fruity esters peak through, making the 4.5% all the more sessionable. Complex but drinkable, begs for sun and food."
"Pretty good, though I can't say the hops really make themselves felt. Perhaps this is too old - without a date it's hard to tell. Looks nice, with a rounded, yeasty aroma. Flavour is OK but various off-notes spoil the effect. Satisfying body. Goes down easily enough; I'll certainly have another if opportunity knocks. Worth sampling if you have the chance."
""
"Very diverse, the color is a cloudy yellow, gold. the head on this thing screams Belgian. the retention stuck around the whole time drinking and an interestingly it appeared the head retention created an island within the middle of the glass. The aromatics mostly yeast driven it seems gives of an interesting phenol, that plays well with the soft spicy citrus notes present from the hops. the flavor is very similar to the aroma. Its semi sweetness finishes comfortably dry. what makes this beverage above average is the mouthfeel. It has a high carbonation level that does not effect the creaminess in the mouthfeel. There is no alcohol warmth and very approachable. This is overall something to share with friends not an everyday beverage but overall impressed."

"T: What? How is this extra hoppy? MAYBE for a BSPA. Still. Herbal boring and bad."
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, orange zest, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, honey, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, grape, orange zest, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, honey, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, bread, honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish; expected of 4.5%. Overall this is an excellent hoppy Belgian pale ale! All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy ester, malt, and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle. Pours a very pale whitish-yellow colour with big bubbles. The nose has subtle notes of light citrus, spice, cracker and grain. Taste is similar with a very crisp, dry finish. Effervescent carbonation. A light, refreshing session beer."

"O- I really enjoyed this beer, I had it on tap a few separate times at Moeder, and this is a very, very drinkable, tasty, good-for-any-normal-day sort of beer."
""

"At first I was pretty thrown off by all of the wild spicy and earthy flavors, but the more I consumed this the more I realized that a Belgium take on an American session beer is pretty great, as you do get the slightly fruity, funky yeasty phenols here, as well as the spices and dried hop resins, without having to worry about getting plastered after one or two glasses (I'm looking at you, Westmalle Tripel). A very good offering from De la Senne and probably one of the tastiest beers I've had recently that's under 5%. I could stock up on these in the future for casual evenings, no doubt."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and sessionable, the beer has a low ABV and wonderful taste/smell of yeast and hops. I could enjoy several of these and it was refreshing on this warm spring afternoon."
""
"overall it's a very drinkable Belgian pale that could serve as a everyday beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The low alcohol content makes the beer very sessionable but it is still packed with lots of hoppy and yeasty flavors making it comparable to some of the top Belgian Pale Ales."
"Overall, quite good indeed. Unique and nice."
""
"Pours a hazy pale, straw yellow capped by a billowing two finger bright white head. Excellent retention, significant lacing. Grassy hops, Belgian yeast, hay, and flora. Typical Belgian yeastiness, pear, grass, and hints of dried dried apricot. Finishes with mildly bitter green tea and just a hint of fresh mint. Light-bodied, slick with a hint of creaminess. A personal favorite among Belgian pale ale. Throroughly enjoyable everytime."
""
""
"Overall a pretty nice beer, different from the usual Belgian offerings in it's hop forward taste."

"I haven't ever had a more delicious session beer. For being so light, this beer kicks some tastebud ass!"

"O: pretty cool brew and yes I would drink another."

"Overall:drinkable refreshing golden ale"
"The beer is light golden hued and extremely hazy and murky. A thick, foamy head measuring approximately an inch leaves sticky lace ringlets around the glass. The aroma brings coriander, grass, light yeast, malt, floral hops. Similar to a saison in many aspects. The taste is refreshing and light, with a nice floral hop presence. The finish is tangy ith a light bitterness. Thin and quite drinkable. A nice sessionable type example of the style."
""
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Pale Ale."

"Beer is sweet in the sense that Duvel is sweet beer, it is an interesting beer. Yeasty and mildly dry on the finish with a little hops in the midpalate, mild bitterness at the end. I enjoyed it a lot."
"This beer would work perfectly with some of those delicate fish entrees that are also a bit oily. The floral notes of the beer will complement that of the fish preparation, and the bitterness will cleanse the mouth and allow the champagney carbonation to refresh the palate and ensure every bite tastes like the first."

"330ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Pale straw color. Hazy appearance. White, medium bubbled, froth. Rocky, fairly good retention, crown. Floral & citric aromas with subtle tropical fruit hues. Maltiness & Belgian yeast at first sip is blown out by heavy hoppiness that lingers into the finish. Medium to light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Oily texture, slightly watery in the middle . Lemon juice sensation, heavy astringency. Long bitter finish. Resiny & piney aftertaste. A devilish refreshing & amazing Belgian Pale Ale."
""
""
""

"T: Really subtle but great flavor profile. Some light citrusy notes: lemon and orange peel with a nice grassy and spicy hoppy finish. Maybe some pale malt as well. Light and refreshing. I'd definitely drink this again."
""
""
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Very cloudy, hazy yellow pour with two finger foamy white head with good retention and nice lacing. Pretty typical Belgian Pale Ale nose with lots of grass, lemony citrus, and yeast. The taste follows suit with a really intense citrusy, grassy, yeasty tang. Hints of lemon, orange rind, spicy herbal hops, and a touch of pepper as well. Mothfeel is slightly fizzy with a nice crisp, dry, tangy, bitter finish. It definitely stands out as a Belgian Pale Ale."
""
""
"Poured into a Stone Brewery flute. Pours a light yellow-orange amber fine white yeast particles floating from pouring the whold bottle, half finger fine white head that slowly dissipates, leaving nice lacing. Aroma of earthy citrus light fruit, faint Belgian yeast and mild hops. Flavor of light bready malt, citrus and hops. Finishes with a light lemony bitterness and light malt. Light to medium bodied. A refreshing pale ale with a distinctive dry, hoppy, citrusy finish."
""
"A Belgian beer to chat over, or even have a mini session on: no great, wonderful or exotic flavours to enthuse about, just a pleasant beer and well worth having."
""
"Served in a pint glass, this beer poured a hazy golden-yellow with a decently foamy white head. Hoppy aroma, grassy, and a bit bready. Biscuity malts in the taste, generously hopped, floral and some citrus notes, almost IPA-ish in nature, and touches of light fruit and light peppery spice. Bitter finish. Decent, but not overwhelming. Light-medium body, and fairly drinkable."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a nice clear golden color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer had some light spice notes on the nose but really gives off lots of nice grainy aromas with some floral hops in there too. The taste of the beer was a little on the light side. It had some decent bitter notes along with some sweet grain too. The mouthfeel was light and pretty refreshing. Overall this brew was good, just not has strong as I thought it might be. Very easy going brew."

"Taste is very nice. Hops are presant, but not over powering. I'm tasting some citrus (maybe tangerine), and a touch of biscuity malts. Very funky and interesting beer. Nice carbonation and overall a good beer."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Opaque bronze, lightening to gold at the edges, with a compact white head. Aroma is immediately reminiscent of Westvleteren blonde - pale malts, subtle esters, and a blast of noble hops. Flavor doesn't quite live up to the Westy, although who really does? A nice clean malt profile gives the resinous hoppiness plenty of room to stretch its legs. Pleasant lasting bitterness with a nice grassy twang. Very clean and dry on the palate, refreshing and easy to drink."
"Overall, a solid beer - worked well as a palate cleanser between Double Black and Cantillon."
"Very interesting beer."
"Drink- It was okay, Didn’t compete with the other beers at Stone for Zwanze 2011."
"The taste is thin at first but becomes more bitter hops and mix with a pale malts to become bitter and fresh. All in all a nice refreshing beer."
"Overall: Refreshing and drinkable but pretty simple."
"O- Very nice! I enjoyed this more than I thought I would going in. The citrus qualities and spicy, hoppy bitterness really made the experience for me. Recommended b"
"Pours a semi-hazy straw color with a huge white head and gobs of lacing on the way down. The nose brings some straw and wheat with some faint hops. Nice and inviting, but nothing too exceptional. The flavor really takes a turn in a positive direction with plenty of floral hops to combine with the light malt. Light body and good bitterness. Solidly-dry finish. High carbonation and super crisp. DLS does it again. Fantastic brew."
"O: Low alcohol and great drinkability. I would try it again."
"Overall: crisp and refreshing an average beer. nothing to write home about."
"O: I enjoyed it. Probably wont order it again for a while, but definitely worth trying."
"O: Another nice, light beer with a pretty solid hop character."
"jd"
"A tough one to get into from the get go; give this some time to grow on you."
"(D)- A crisp and refreshing take on a belgian pale ale. Not super hoppy, but it is bitter. Bigger on the bready citrus; almost like a Saison at the same time."
"O: Lots of spices and a nice bitterness could go a long way, but this one lacks body."
"A really good beer!"
"Flavour is a bit thin, diluted notes of honey and bitter hops with a dry, hoppy finish. Bitter in a manner similar to tonic water on the end."
"A highly drinkable and surprisingly bitter flavour. Very refreshing."
"It is a decent beer. My bottle might be old."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a small 1 inch head that becomes an oily film on the top of the beer. Spotty bits of lace on the drink down. Smells of yeast, watery citrus hops, and malt. Tastes of watery malt, subdued citrus hops, and yeast. Somewhat abrasive hop bitterness after each sip. Not too good. Good carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, I am glad I got to try this hard to find Belgian beer but it is not my cup of tea."
"The mouthfeel is almost perfect. Taras Boulba is incredibly smooth, mostly as a result of the fine carbonation. the finish is dryer than average. It makes this beer very drinkable. A very good interpretation of the style."
"Thanks, NorthYorkSammy!"
"D: Drinkable and decent. I would not purchase myself again, but would pass along to another to spread the wealth."
"D - Not bad. Worth a try, not sure how often I'll go back though. But definitely worth a try."
"Low ABV makes this perfect for a lay sunny afternoon. Extra hoppy ale is what it says on the label and that's what this beer delivers. Great session beer."
"Actually, a bit to unbalanced hoppiness, I lack a body to help it be refreshing."
"I understand Gogol is one of the greatest of all the great Russian writers but I doubt even he could have devised a character so memorable and unique as this. In fact, this is my favourite Belgian character since Hercule Poirot. While admittedly it does a take a great deal of its character from the American hops, there's no mistaking that its intricacy, balance and the first-rate of its craftsmanship were undoubtedly the work of a Belgian mind."
"Cheers"
"D- this stuff rocks! Simply beautiful brew. Super drinkable and a blast to quaff. Worth the wait to find it on draft."
"On tap into a tulip at Moeder Lambic...A honey gold pour with a light tan head. A big clear thick off white head, good retention and lacing...A light sweet aroma of honey and grain, mostly the same on the taste. A light tasting but flavorful and easy to drink brew."
"Pours a hazy pale yellowish with a somewhat small coarse head. Smell is floral and herbal with a saison-like essence. A faint funk and yeast also is pleasant. Taste is lemony and herbal/flowery with barely a trace of malt. Dry and bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is too thin and watery. Overall, a good sessionable pale."
"It poured a hazy golden color with a foamy white head. The aroma was floral. It was light bodied with high drinkability. It was very light, refreshing, and crisp."
"Poured into St Feuillien tulip. Beer is a light slightly hazy yellow with a half inch white head. Nice retention and some lacing. Smell is incredibly floral hops, very fresh smelling. Belgian yeast in the background, the hops steal the show here. Taste follows smell, firm hop bitterness followed by a very floral hop flavor, a hint of rosewater, a very unique hop profile. Some light malts and a nice bready yeast finish to help balance out the hops a little. A light body with a medium carbonation, the hop flavor coats and gives an interesting finish. Drinkability is very good. I love finding a beer that has lower abv and great flavor. If this was easier to find I would drink it much more often."
"The taste is really great. Slightly more hoppy than a Houblon or Local 1 and very tasty. I'm definitely going to go find some more."
"D: Highly palatable but...intensely dry drinks have never been highly quaffable for me. Nevertheless, Taras Boulba drinks very well, particulary the first one or two glasses."
"D: Nice BPA, lower in alcohol than most, but still pretty full-flavoured, a session beer for Belgium."
"D - This is really great. Goes down wonderfully to the point of being dangerous. Pale but bitter. Just really enjoyable."
"This is an outstanding Belgian Pale Ale, and incredibly sessionable and quenching for its weight. It will not be replacing Orval any time soon, but it's a beautifully crafted beer with finesse and style."
"Then again, I don't really remember what Orval tastes like. I remember that it was damned impressive for its size, that it managed to cram in most of the best Belganiness of a good Dubbel only without much of the alcohol burn. This is like that. There's a goddamn Turkishmarketsworth of ripe fruit in there, along with maybe the nicest Belgian yeast profile I've ever come across. It's all the nice flavors you normally associate with burn only there's no burn. And the aftertaste is superb. It tastes the way an old dusty beerstore smells, only in no way gross. One sip of this and it's like I'm standing in the middle of John's Grocery."
"Herbal, floral, zesty hops hit the palate first, quickly matched by bready and earthy malts, white pepper-like spiciness, strong lemon rind bitterness. This has a lot of flavor and complexity, but it never feels heavier than its 4.5% ABV. Light and thirst-quenching, dry from front to back, I'm really liking the balance between the malt, hops and yeast. There's a touch of medicinal phenols in the finish that remind me of aged Orval, faint enough to add an interesting complexity. The bitterness in the finish seems to grow with each sip, lingering for minutes in between sips, exhibiting an herbal and lemon peel-like character. Such a great beer."
"OVERALL: A great, flavorful summer session beer. Proves that a low ABV doesn't mean low in flavor and complexity. This is a great alternative to witbier on the terrace on a warm summer afternoon. It's just too bad this one isn't distributed more widely. Highly recommended."
"Low ABV, excellent flavor, very refreshing - a wonderfully sessionable Belgian ale."
"M/D: Carbonation i allright, but it does have a soapy feel to it. ABV-level is fine."
"When I get back to homebrewing, I will attempt something like this. Fantastic stuff."
"This is a great beer, there's a certain cohesion between the seemingly incongruous elements that makes it a really drinkable pale ale."
"A refreshing light beer, and highly drinkable at under 5% ABV."
"D - A bit of a one dimensional beer with bitter, bitter hops and not much else. Malt is secondary, hop flavor is non-existent. I guess I'm probably used to/spoiled by excellent American interpretations with way more hop character. I guess I'm a bit disappointed in this one...it's good, but I have no need to have another now, and I don't see myself seeking this out either - too many other good beers out there to revisit this one."
"D- Smells and tastes nice, but the bloaty feeling keeps me from wanting a second glass this particular day."
"D- Moderate. I really enjoyed it, I'd like to see it in a larger bottle format. Buying a few of these small bottles to drink over a night would hurt the wallet- but I like this beer. While not 'extra hoppy' it is more than sufficiently hoppy, a Belgian pale with a bit of a kick to it. Nice."
"HV"
"Pours a sunny slightly hazy golden with a big fluffy white head. The aroma is sharp and grainy, with some lemon and coriander. The flavor is thin and lemony, with a strong bite of coriander and allspice. There is a grainy, almost wheaty body, with a distinct aspriny bitterness. The finish is a bit weak and watery, however. The mouthfeel is quite watery."
"D - A drinkable pale, the drinkability is very nice for this style - hopped slightly like a belgian strong yet abv is at level of a pale so it is win/win. I found the bitterness to be substantial and if it weren't at the lowered strength it is could be compared to a Belgian Ipa w/ the bitterness - recommended."
"The nose is light enough where unfortunately we do detect a bit of hops, spices and resins. The mouth is the opposite. In addition to being quite special entry in the mouth, rather resinous, leading to flavors of anise and licorice, accented and highlighted by a hops and yeast quality. Tasting offers a body quite dry with a strong bitterness that breathes the fresh hops. With only 4.5 °, it offers much flavor in the mouth and can be drunk in large quantities. A classic BITTER (and not an IPA or Pale Ale like I saw it), yet resolutely Belgian."
"I could drink this beer any time any place."
"Overall a very drinkable and user friendly farmhouse ale."
"D - Another nice take on the Belgian IPA. Very drinkable & worth seeking out if you can find it."
"M&D - medium bodied and easily drinkable, nicely combined flavors and not so funky to turn people off, a nice classic belgian"
"The beer actually didn't last this long. It was quite smooth and creamy. I guess that's all that needs to be said about it's drinkability as well. It's a good thing it's only 4.5%"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a generous white head, lots of lacing. The smell is flowers, clean minerals, grain. The taste is up front minerals, sweetness and biscuit in the middle, and a long bitter finish. It's highly carbonated, a little viscous. Nice and easy to drink as it warms. Wish this were available around here, and were a lot cheaper. All in all it's a lot like a mellower version of a Belgian IPA. Fine stuff."
"Taste pretty much follows, although I would say this has a lightness to it that American Pales don't usually have. The malt is richer and not as wide, if that makes sense. Low abv makes this a good session beer for me."
"Wasn't sure what to expect, but liked the idea of a ""hoppy"" Belgian ale. This poured a nice rich golden color in the tulip glass it was served with with a good amount of head that clung for a few minutes. Well-balanced smell with hops dominating. The taste was also hoppy up front, but none of the bitter aftertaste of IPAS. This beer finished with a sweet, smooth flavor that was refreshing and different. I had no idea until I got home that this beer was less than 5% alcohol. If it didn't cost me $7.50 a glass, I could drink this one all night. A delicious ale!"
"A good brew. This one would work nicely with chicken Francaise. A great session brew. Well worth trying if you see it out and about."
"This is probably my favorite sub-5% abv Belgian that I've tried so far. It tastes like a light Belgian IPA, which makes sense given the self-applied label, ""Extra Hoppy Ale."" I chilled it down a bit in the refrigerator and side-stepped the overflow other BA's have reported. Consequently, the head was probably a bit less than it could have been. The beer is a glowing, hazy yellow-gold liquid with a puffy white head. The aroma is a bit weak. Dry yeast is the main aroma, but there is a noticeable tangerine hop undercurrent. The beer really shines on the palate. It's a pretty exceptional beer given the truly sessionable 4.5% abv. Both malt and hops shine and work well with the yeast. The malt is light but fresh and flavorful. The hops give the beer a great bite in the aftertaste and provide pleasing bitterness and flavor throughout. The yeast flavors are a refined and restrained Belgian complex of earth and must. This is one of those great foreign session beers that's sadly too expensive to drink in quantity here. I'm deeply envious of Belgians (and anyone else lucky enough) who can find it easily and cheaply."
"really, this isn't much different from the bottled version. maybe fresher, and of course no gushing. again, this has exceptional depth of flavor for just 4.5% ABV."
"Quite drinkable and a lot of flavor for a lower ABV beer. This could be a session Belgian."
"Taste, again, has some citrus and lemony hops, but is by no means ""hoppy."" If anything, it tastes like soapy lemon zest. Not particularly appealing, and this is one of the few times I think a beer is overly carbonated. The flavor could have used a dampening down."
"This beer poured a hazy, golden color with tall, white foam that persisted and clung to the glass, leaving some lace. The smell was a wonderful aromatic hop aroma (noble?) coupled with effervescent carbonation which tickled the nostrils. The taste was very dry and full of aromatic hop flavors, though not overly bitter. Behind the hops was a mild malt body with only a touch of sweetness. Perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and good, fine carbonation. The hops were present from start to finish. This is a wonderful session beer. Thanks to Daniel from Moan & Dove for recommending this one."
"D: This is really easy to put down. I'd drink it all the time if it were more widely available and less expensive."
"All around good beer, but nothing that really strikes a fancy with me on this one."
"This is easily drinkable, but not something I want all the time. Only beacause there are so many great Belgian Pales out there, and this one is just good. Not Bad, but good."
"advertised as extra hoppy, it is anything but. rather the hops just serve to clean up the sweet fruity esters left behind from the belgian style."
"pour is a murky golden. the head creeps up the bottle after popping. very carbonated beer. tight white belgian bubbles. nose of herbal straw, pilsner bitterness, and a mild floral lavender quality. taste is soap astringent. quite dry on the tongue. lavender comes through on the palate quite nicely with a pislner earthy like finish. wonderful bitter. light. effervescent carbonation that does burn but adds to the clean dryness of the beer. very mild sweet, some honey with a finish of bread. minty crisp on the tongue balance with that too. great beer. great for late spring to summer. so light and well hopped it could be had with everything... but spicy foods."
"Drinkability- All in all a really nice pale ale. Really easy to drink and refreshing."
"Acidic without being citrusy. A balanced finish that offers a notable hop flavor. The yeast is lighter than the smell would indicate. Balanced body; leans toward the bubbly side."
"Edit: thinking back, this keg had been rolled down stairs into the basement minutes prior to tapping, so I wonder if that really screwed up the taste by agitating all that yeast into the beer."
"Drinkability: I'm always happy to mix in a lighter alcohol brew, particularly when it's both pleasantly flavorful and irresistibly quaffable."
"Its good to see the belgians can make a great light tasty beer aswell some excellent dark, strong brews."
"Cheers..."
"A pretty easy drinking Belgian."
"Aroma was enjoyable as it reminded of Belgian smells with added hoppiness. It had a nice fruitiness to it. The taste is light and fruity and was one which could be session-able. It was pretty dry in the mouth and you were left with some resinous hops. Overall a very solid Belgian Pale."
"Pours a clouded yellow orange that's hard to see in this dark light. Nose is minor dough with spices mixed in. Milder than I expected. Flavor is quite hoppy it seems. Fair amount of dough. Earthy too. Minor citrus on the backside. Decent level of spices it seems, buy really the hops are in full effect here. Smooth feel. Low carbonation. Nice to drink. It started off off to me but soon got quite nice. Like this beer a lot."
"8/4/9/4/18/4.3"
"and... even the appearance is nice... so, actually, it's the best when you like beers that are made by brewers that are not crawling in front of the market."
"Pours a nice golden color with a thin white head that didn't last very long. Nice hop aroma with hints of spice and fruit. Strange combination of a belgian strong ale and an IPA. The absence of any malt flavor gave this a funky aftertaste."
"Feel is what I would expect from a beer of this style, refreshing body, heavy carbonation. Could have another but the bitterness might get to me. Very good recommended."
"Golden body, modest, retaining head, and not-to-crisp on the tongue. Wonderfully refreshing with a hint of honey on a bed of flower. Slight sour tart oils incude citrus and powdered candy sugar. A lemon merengue turns De Ranke bitter with healthy use of hops, the way only Belgium knows how. Something special."
"maybe i am the fool, you better watch this one, i got a booming head ache just minutes after finishing the bottle!"
"Grainy astringency and assertive, grassy hop bitterness up front. A dollop of honey on wheat bread shows up mid-palate along with lemon mineral water bitterness. Lemon peel and yeast dominate the finish, with some lingering spicy wheat malt fighting with the bitterness. Moderate body with a lively, bottle-conditioned feel. Refreshing and interesting. Would be a nice quaffer for a hot Belgian day!"
"M + D: Feels great... it's a shame I'm not blown away with the scent and flavour, as this would really top it off. A nice, crisp carbonation to begin, followed by a fairly slick and even oily body which makes for a smooth and easy finish before basically 'vaporizing' with a bit of a post-finish dryness. This may be a case of an ""off-bottle"" and it may simply be that I am not too keen on the hops used or the method in which this beer was made. I'd be happy to try it again to ensure I am not throwing a perfectly good beer out the window with this one, becasue it looks fine in the glass and the feel is fabulous."
"D- There is not a lot of flavor in this beer other than the pungent bitterness after each sip. The hops due linger but there is just no real aroma or flavor hops and not much to support the bitterness of the hops that are there."
"I bought this bottle at Beer Mania in Brussels. The bottle I got was labeled for import, which is where the Shelton Brothers URL came from."
"Big thanks to Phyl21ca for this extra!"
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy (lots of lees) beige color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of extra dry hops with lightly spicy yeast. Taste is a well balance mix between some spicy yeast with some really dry hops (not really bitter though) and good Belgian style malt profile. Full body with great carbonation. Well done if maybe a tad too dry but I wouldn't mind having this more often."
"Pours a somewhat cloudy dark golden with an excellent creamy white head and some sticky lacing. Smells earthy with hops and a bit of forest floor. Big bitterness from earthy and herbaceous hops. There are some spice notes, a bit of creaminess, and some smooth very slightly sweet malt providing a backbone. Aftertaste of white pepper. This is extraordinarily flavorful for such a low abv beer. Excellent achievement. The mouthfeel is a bit spicy and quite smooth, even a tad light. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Overall: The most flavorful beer with a lower ABV i've had to date. A beer i would have again in a heartbeat. Definitely put one on the top of your list."
"Tried this a couple of weeks ago at Moan & Dove. Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a goblet. Color is a light copper - I'd call it a shade or two lighter than a typical pale ale. Very nice 1/2 - 3/4"" head with good lacing and retention. The aroma is slightly floral, with faint smell of hops mixed in. Exeptionally drinkable beer (although in this case three of us split one bottle), one I could see having several of over the course of an afternoon with friends. Relatively low abv% adds to drinkability. This is a very unique beer, and one I will definitely try again."
"This is a pretty good beer, unfortunately the bottle I drank had begun to skunk. The dry finish is right on and the spicy aromas and flavors complement the hops well."
"Poured from capped and corked 750ml bottle into a standard pint glass. This unlike the Zinnebier did not have beer between the cork and the cap. Firm pour yielded a 3 finger head with good staying pour and nice lacing. Beer was a pale translucent amber. Smell was of slight hops, straw and Belgian yeast. Taste was slightly sweet, straw/grassy flavors, very light with a hop bitterness in the finish. Long finish. Very easy drinking, light and somewhat mild. Beer was a little thin. Very nice."
"33cl bottle. Pours an opaque straw yellow with a huge white head that lasts. Characteristic sediment. Smells strongly of Belgian yeast and hops. Very floral and somewhat grassy. Light grain in the background. Tastes floral, with a definite hop presence; slightly sweet, grainy malt in the back. Faint yeasty spice. For the style and ABV, the body is as full as it gets. Nice effervescence. Crisp, refreshing, plenty of flavor, lots of character, refined, balanced, etc etc. Fantastic."
"Really enjoyable."
"Very impressed with this beer. Definitely will pick up some more of this when I can"
"This was on tap for one night only at Moan and Dove. The drink had a murky and generally cloudy look to it. Colors were a plain gold look with a rather quick lacing. The aromas were of sharp alcohol with some hops. The alcohol was most apparent which wrapped around the drinks grassy aromas. The taste definitely was grassy but it was light enough to not be overpowering. Generally bitter taste. Solid body allowed it from not being heavy or light; just right. Overall, a real treat."
"Why would Brasserie De La Senne name a pale ale after an obscure historical novel written by an obscure Ukranian named Nikolai Gogole? Who cares, as long as the beer is delicious. Taras Boulba is another hoppy Belgian that saison freaks owe it to themselves to try."
"Overall: I don't see myself seeking this one out again. Taras Boulba isn't awful, but it's not what I thought it would be. I was not expecting the sulfur/skunk tang of it. It looks great and feels pretty good, but to me the flavor just wasn't good at all. I have to wonder if the problem is my lack of familiarity with the style given the high rating of this by fellow BAs or even maybe a light struck bottle. I actually chose to trade for this because it is supposed to be an nearly top shelf example of a Belgian Pale Ale. I must be missing something, though because for me this was not a reassuring introduction to the style."
"One beer that comes to mind in comparison is Green Flash's Pale Ale. That is an excellent example of a west coast pale that has all the attributes of a bigger beer without the actual huge taste and alcohol."
"I like it a lot and will have it again."
"Pours beautifully, with a bright light gold body and a pure white head as thick as whipped cream, but lighter. Aromas of fruity and floral hops -- perhaps even some higher AA varieties -- laid on a base of light, slightly biscuity malts. On the palate, things are light and soft, with wonderful integration among the different flavors. Fresh lemongrass bitterness starts things off, with more herbal notes in the middle. The finish dries out in the malt column, but puts across a pleasant lemon note to compensate. Mouthfeel is light, with plenty of carbonation; the overall impression is one of lift and deftness. Overall, this is an excellent saison-ish Belgian beer."
"I don't care much for the herbal/medicinal/Alka-seltzerish aftertaste."
"Taste is even more subdued, it taste like a belgian pale, but it just doesn't have enough umphh. I don't think this is a bad bottle or anything, they just got it in at Abe's, but who knows. Mouthfeel is fairly light, dry, pretty on point with all that carbonation. I could easily drink another, but i just found it pretty boring. If you are a huge fan of belgian pales and its in your price range, pick it up, but not highly recommended."
"D: Quite drinkable. Something that would be nice for 2-3."
"Belgian ale is a broad category but this really drinks like one hell of a mild saison. Try it out."
"33 cl bottle. The beer poured a cloudy golden color with a one inch plus head, thick and fluffy. The nose gave me notes of citrus and an earthiness. Taste was smooth, lemon citrus on the tongue. There is a nice hop kick in the mouth but it is not overpowering bur rather pleasing to the taste buds. Overall this is a fairly easy drinking well balanced beer."
"Fruity, yeast, candied sugar aroma. Tall, fine, off-white head leaves a thick coat of lace. Glowing golden beer frames a cloud of lazily rising bubbles. Sugary vanilla and fleshy fruit up front give way to juicy pine and grapefruit hop flavors. The finish is slightly bitter. Just enough to clear all the sweet flavors and drive you to another sip. It starts as a Belgian Pale Ale and finishes as a mild West Coast IPA. IPA."
"I could have had a few of these, but there were jsut so many to try."
"Belgian bomber, no freshness/brewing date info. Capped and corked, I also found a bit of darker liquid betw. the cap and the top of the cork. The cork seemed to have a slight blue cheese sheen to it, Funky....This one pours cloudy medium tangerine, with an initial huge, wild head, after a minute or two the poor was more controllable and resulted in a real nice slowly fading merainge, and then a thick, wildly undulating film and leaving the now expected extensive thick sheeting and lace. Nose is of candied and spiced cotton candy and popcorn. Earthy, lightly peppery, plenty of yeasty interest. Notes of some light grapefruit, herbal and flowery hop notes and more mild, lingering peppery spice. Very Saison like. Fairly light bodied, quite complex and interesting. I love to come across a new (at least to me), vibrant and very tasty offering like this one. Yeast filled final pour, adds some nutty notes, medium chunks and perhaps a more pronounced hop presence, very nice beer. Not cheap @ $9.99, but oh so worth it"
"Worth the $10.49? No. But they got me with the name and the label. That's how they get ya!"
"This beer is very good; probably one of the best visual experiences; it has a very intriguing aromatic character, but is not quite perfect; and the flavor is merely quite good. The flavor seems a touch flat somehow, this is of course a product of the low alcohol percentage, but the best of these hoppy, low alcohol sort of season like brews have more texture and more exciting flavors to them than this does. Still this is very good, and I would be quite happy to see a bunch more beers in this same vein. I like how easy drinking this beer is and also how the bitterness, while substantial, is not overdone. I could use a bit more hop flavor and aromatics, but that might be made up for by getting a really fresh sample of this beer."
"Bought a few bottles to take to my tasting club for a belgian themed night. I admit I am getting into belgian beers more and more. I really like the belgian pales due to their addition of hops, because I love IPA's. Taras Boulba is great because its not too strong. There is not too much 'belgian funk' in this beer, almost disappointingly, but I can drink an entire bottle and not be smashed. The hops in this beer are subtley bitter and build up on the palate. The beer is almost fizzy and I like the layer of foam after its poured out. An overall refreshing and hoppy drinkable belgian ale, gold in color."
"Cheers!"
"This was a very nice beer, and given the abv., would make for a good summer session beer. Quite impressive."
"Drinkability - It was a descent Belgian but nothing too special."
"Overall - A very good Belgian pale ale although if they beefed up the flavours a touch i think this would be outstanding... certainly recommended though..."
"A Stand-Out Belgian Pale, one of the finds of my obscure pale hunt. Mildly yeasty, with a good fomay head. Nice mouthfeel, medium lus mouthfeel, expirey 2008. Quite hoppy,good bitterness and a remarkable overall taste effort for 4.5% a.b.v. I would drink this regular and convert many people if this was available regularly."
"To start, this was a great looking bottle, I really love the artwork. After popping the cork, I did notice some seeping moisture, but this didn't affect the beer at all. Poured a golden/orange color with a big yet thin head. The smell immediately screams saison/farmhouse with a noticeable hop aroma. The taste suggested slight hints of fruitiness, although the dry, yet not all out bitter hoppiness is what shows through in this beer. For me, it had a very similar taste to a La Moneuse I believe, but I could be getting it mixed up with something else, either way I have had a beer that is very similar to this. I found this very refreshing, and would have no problem drinking this on a nice summer day, such as this one. If you can get your hands on this one, I would definitely try it, it's well worth it."
"Absolutely excellent hoppy saison. Perfect appearence with a lasting froth. VIbrant nose. Tremendously flavorful for such a low alcohol brew. Extremely hoppy, but such a balanced flavor. Excellent longevity as well, im guessing this will keep well for at least a year (nothing like an American IPA.) Pure and clearly high in quality. Fantastic belgian ale."
"Cheers"
"Good new one."
"The feel is airy and effervescent, juicy at first, then with the dry smack on the back of the palate. It was very easy to finish a 750mL of this very refreshing summertime Belgian. Imagine a hoppier, less fruity version of Zinnebir, and that's not far off the mark."
"Taste is light malty and strong spicy, like a combination of a pils and a tripel, light but powerfull and full-bodied. A nice bitterness which is a litlle raw and herbal. The yeast gives the beer a Belgian spiciness, which reminds me of coriander and anise. The aftertaste is dry and hoppy. Mouthfeel is smooth."
"M&D: creamy in texture, subtle in carbonation and medium-bodied, this is a very nicely flavoured, heavily hoppy ale, just like what it says on the beer label: ""Extra Hoppy Ale"". That said, with due respect, it lacks the kind of complexity that other good Belgian Pale Ales have, and is not as bitter as a real Bitter fan would satisfyingly contemplate... extremely quaffable and more-ish, though."
"BBE aug 08. Nice and lasting white head and a cloudy golden beer. Nose is quiet hoppy belgium goldings like so spicy with bit of sour orange and some pale maltyness. Sparkling and inviting fresh. Taste is bitter and dry without missing some maltbody. Good mouthfeel and full taste despite only 4.5%. Great session beer IMO."
"Draft at Bruxellensis (9/9/06). Also brought a bottle home and saw it for sale at a few establishments around Brussels."
