Taste is right up there with what you might want in a spring-seaon ale; crisp, clean and simple. Pale malt bill right upfront with a not-to-bitter hop finish. Not much else, but quite good.

It doesn't even come straightforward with its Belgian yeast nuances but, what Spring Blonde does have is exceptional balance among these attributes. The finished product has just enough flavor to command interest but not enough to make multiple beers a chore - this one is a crisp and refreshing for an easy drinking, well-crafted experience.","BeerFMAndy","May 09, 2014"

The mouthfeel is light and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Flavors follow the nose with Belgian yeast and lemon upfront. It is a very light and refreshing pour, especially for the adv. Drinks like a light beer at best. This is a refreshing enjoyable summertime beer but lacks complexity or depth. Good but overly simple.","lochef81","May 06, 2014"

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, cracker, bread, light honey, clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice and pleasant flavors with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Belgian blonde ale. Good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 15, 2014"

Well, it was just the right amount of bitter and everything else. Great golden color with perfectly white head. The head goes away, but it has very nice lacing all the way down. The only disappointment was the smell - there wasn't much there to distinguish it from other beers. The rest though, taste and mouthfeel was terrific. A very bold, crisp feel over the tongue to go along with the bold, crisp taste. Very nice offering from New Belgium.","jjamadorphd","Mar 09, 2014"

The nose has a nice crackery malt scent and a light dusting of hops. The flavor profile is extremely clean, with light malt, but a pleasant amount of bitterness for a generic session beer. Yeast character is mostly neutral--maybe a hint of fruitiness. Light bodied. In general, completely unexceptional--the type of light beer every microbrewer had at one time. Inoffensive.

When I first poured it I was getting some aromas like that of NB's Trippel, which is one of my go-to's, and I wondered if it was going to be something like a Trippel Lite. Closer inspection revealed a weakish lemony aroma, and some corn-like malts - not bad but not what I would call stellar. First taste, to be honest, I could barely taste anything. I had my wife taste it and she called out the lemony, tart front end and the bitter finish, which is pretty much how the label describes it. As I got through the glass, the tartness up front and bitter back end became more apparent, but the mouthfeel is pretty light and watery. I compared it to a Coors Light, which I have nothing against, just not something I drink/buy/think about with any regularity. It does have a little more going on than a CL, and the airy mouthfeel could be considered refreshing. The abv is low enough that you can have a few without getting totally smashed, but do you want a few? Just a question to ask yourself. JSYK, I am really hard on Belgian pales in general, but this beer did not stand out to me whatsoever, and my wife used the word ""pointless"" to describe it. I actually do like New Belgium and buy their products quite a bit, but don't need to get this one again.","BeerWizard","Feb 02, 2014"

Lightly sweet, with blends of caramel malts and butternut squash, the brew is highly drinkable and perfect for a warm day outdoors on the porch with a book.

This is a lovely and well-balanced ale that remains faithful to the New Belgium name and the company's more distinctive label ""re-invention"". Liked it!","secondtooth","Jan 19, 2014"

As I said, I'm not certain if I received a poor batch, but I'm incredibly disappointed with the quality of this beer. I'm amazed that a craft brewery (and such a good one too) could have brewed what I just drank.","olsontl","Jan 17, 2014"

Flavor is similar with a grassy mildy bitter finish. This one definitely leans to the sweet malty side of things for me. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, meh. What I generally have come to think of most NB offerings. Not bad but not one I will bother with again.","denver10","Jan 14, 2014"

The first taste explodes with sweet barley and subtle yeast flavors that are quickly drawn back by an inviting bitterness. The after taste lingers in the back of the mouth with a refreshing feel. The body is perfect for this style of beer. This is definitely a go-to beer for me.","LuckyStrikes","Jan 07, 2014"
