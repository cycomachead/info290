3.41,-5.5,,,,,,"Had on tap while in Antwerp. Pours amber colored with a fluffy white head. Aroma is light bready malts, faint yeast, and a bit of grass. Flavor follows with bready malt and crisp grassy finish, bit of caramel, with very little of that Belgian yeast flare, and extremely low on the sweetness. Light plus body with medium plus carbonation. Seems like quality of a Sam Adams for Belgium. Not bad, but not sure why one would choose this when there are so many other options.","BMMillsy","Sep 12, 2014"

The nose comprises rye bread, light ruby red grapefruit zest, Belgian yeast, a hint of clove, and a few drops of maple syrup. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some mild grass and flowers for the sake of it. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice little BPA, nothing to write home about, but if you're here and need a bit of Belgian-ness, it's here for you.","TMoney2591","May 01, 2014"

3.86,6.9,3.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Ordered on tap at a Calgary ale house (1600) and arrived in a genuine De Koninck tulip glass. This iconic Belgian pale ale is in fact a fairly dark orange to reddish amber hue, with a little white lacing left on the glass as one proceeds. Aroma is classic Belgium, fairly strong and redolent with sweet and fruity yeast esters, caramel malt, and bright floral hops. Everything is well-integrated although the floral/herbal hop notes from genuine Saaz are striking. According to Roger Protz in "The Taste of Beer", Saaz is the only hop used and with a fairly heavy hand I'd add. The aggressive hops lead the way on the palate, evoking lavender and fresh perfume, layered over a fairly rich caramel flavor with a little vanilla creme and dark raisin. I also get some green fruit sourness and the body is fairly heavy with a lot of residual sugars. Satisfying. Finish is similarly complex, with a rich buttery character, lingering sweetness and some booze accompanied by a dry pepper spicy bitterness. One is left with an overall impression of sweet dough, dessert sugars, and bitter medicine all bound together in a way that works, although some might wonder about a clash between the latter two components. I like it, personally.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 02, 2013"

I understand Saaz are inherent to the style, but I really struggle with this particular hop. I just donâ€™t like it very much. Fortunately the bitterning was dealt with a very light hand and I was able to look around them for the most part. Overall, very nice (3.5/5).","mhaugo","Sep 04, 2013"

Tastes very similar to a modest American amber ale with a tiny amount of Belgian yeast. A faint hint of Belgian yeast in the finish. Light to medium bodied. Very attenuated flavor.

This is a refreshing crisp ale, with perfect carbonation and a smooth palate, finishing with a lovely but quickly fleeting slight bitterness.

Nose is very subdued but suggests green apples (maybe a little vinegary), as well as Saaz hops and grains. Taste is big on earthy grains and malt with perhaps a trace of acidity. A biscuity quality lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, with a carbonation that starts off crisp and slowly tapers off towards the back, ending with a semi-dry finish.

3.97,10,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep copper to light amber with a thin, soapy head that leaves behind a touch of lace. Aroma is very light, with toasted malts, peppery hops and a touch of must. Flavor begins with some toasted malt, lemon, and some light bitterness in the finish. Has a medium body, low to medium carbonation, and a dry finish. All in all a very nice beer, but not one I'd go out of my way for.","zerk","Feb 06, 2004"
4.1,13.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"In respect of the on-tap versions, one word of warning... this beer can taste rough, acidic and sharp if you are unlucky. Some cafÃ©s don't sell enough of it, or maybe the stuff left in the pipes from last night doesn't get flushed out before they start pouring again in the morning, but just note that if your first one doesn't taste good it might not be your fault. Complain and they will will give you another.","downes51","Jan 27, 2004"

4.07,12.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall: One of the few Belgium beers that is distinctly better on draft then from the Bottle. A nice bottled offering and my marks reflect that I have an Â‘agedÂ’ sample (though not out of date). A Bolleke of this in Antwerp served on Tap, with a swirl of yeast of course really does still take some beating. Maybe better when fresher in the bottle, donÂ’t leave it too long in the fridge or buy older sample of it would be my advice.","TheLongBeachBum","Dec 28, 2003"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Sampled on tap at an outdoor cafe in the Antwerp city centre (Reubans Section). This stuff is excellent. The appearance is dark golden with a lovely white head. The aromas are of alcohol, various spices, sugar, yeast, and hops. The taste is quite sweet up front, malty in the middle, and bitter (hoppy) on the finish. The mouthfeel is slick and nice and the drinkability is quite good!","francisweizen","Nov 05, 2003"
3.77,4.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy golden brown, with a weak head (and poor retention at that); yet it is lively and effervescent. The smell is of bread, fruit, and a grassy background. The flavor has a crisp start, sweet middle and a dry, spicy finish. The feel is smooth and slippery with a balanced effervescence and a lingering dryness.","SeanChouffe","Oct 25, 2003"
3.8,5.3,4,4,4,3,3.5,"The yeast in this is pretty distinctive. It definitely carries a Belgian quality, but for stands out from others in its distinct fruity spiciness, creating a nice underlying profile of aromas and flavors that ties the different aspects of the malt and hops together with its own interest.","Stopper","Sep 28, 2003"
2.78,-23,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"This beer was ok, a fairly standard example of the Belgian pale ale style. Nice and easy drinking, but nothing to make me feel like I needed another one. Really not too much flavor in this beer, overall it is just lacking in those flavorful beer qualities. I quickly moved on to a duvel that I saw on the menu, you should too.","Gueuzedude","Sep 05, 2003"

2.76,-23.5,3,4.5,2,3,2,"Red-orange body topped by a uniform finger-and-a-half head, and dropping. Rich fruity nose, oranges, plums, and some candy notes. Unfortunately, the taste is less complex: sweet, but the aspects are much less defined. And there is an annoying chalkiness in the center of the aftertaste. A disappointment.","RonfromJersey","Jul 17, 2003"

3.8,5.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Nice amber colored ale with hop presence in the nose and the taste. Very light with a nice mouthfeel and smooth body that leaves a lasting head. Is good at any occasion but especially with spicy foods as the hop balance is more prevalent. Low ABV makes this a highly drinkable ale.","bierman2000","Jun 27, 2003"

3.54,-1.9,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Beer pours out rusty/amber with a decent amount of yeast globules hovering in suspension. Nice and creamy orange head dissipates within about a minute. Kind of a spicy hop/sour malt smell with a yeasty undercurrent. Delivers a clean yeasty taste with a decent supply of malt and hops in balance. It's kind of watery, but not without flavor. Therefore it's quite refreshing served cold. It's pretty smooth with a toasty finish. After finishing one, I can see myself enjoying another - maybe due to the 11.2 fl. oz. sized bottle, or maybe due to the slightly complicated nature of this refreshing ale.","optikon44","Mar 30, 2003"
2.78,-23,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"The appearance is nice-- pleasant amber color, clear, medium head with slight lacing. The mouthfeel was soft with a nice balance of carbonation. The aroma after the initial shot of Saaz hops was followed with a light malt and sweet water character. Taste had the similar sweet water quality, like a N/A. Some dryness and bitterness on finish, but not necessarily pleasant. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone interested in a trial of Belgian beers.","garymuchow","Mar 28, 2003"

3.85,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This ale poured an amber color with modest white foam. The smell was also modest: malt and some musty grape scent (characteristic for many Belgian ales). The taste was malty, with the tell-tale musty grape flavor, as well as some floral hop flavor in the finish.

Nose is sweet with notes of apple peel, dark fruits, spice, and is also a bit medicinal. Creamy medium-bodied brew with a complex flavor. Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts up front followed by a malty bread flavor. Middle has notes of doughy yeasts and lots of spice such as vanilla, clove, and allspice. Fruity towards the end with notes of ripe apple and a touch of plum with a dry finish. I prefer their Cuvee beer to this one, but this is still a very enjoyable brew.","Morris729","Feb 07, 2003"
3.64,0.8,3,4,3.5,3,4,"The beer has a nice crisp mouthfeel. Fruity and plummy flavors, and also very malty. It's remeniscent of many Belgian stong ales, but without the high abv.

4.07,12.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Has a slight spicy yeast flavor that bubbles on the tip of the tongue. Extreme smoothness is accompanied by a fruitiness and a slight caramel taste as well. An exceptional ale, pairing well with my block of horseradish white cheddar. Mild and easy to drink, yet full of flavor and delicious. Worth finding.","IrishRedRock","Jan 31, 2003"
4.47,23.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"What can you say? This is just another fine Belgian beer. The fine blend of malt & hops is not necessarily exceptional but is noteworthy. They definitely know what they are doing. I prefer the Cuvee to this one but I still really enjoy the flavor. Very smooth and clean on the palate with an enjoyable nose to compliment the flavor. I had this with a chicken in pesto sauce & cheese which turned out to be a great combination. Again I will highly recommend this one to try and it will not be unusual to find it in my fridge at home.","AtrumAnimus","Jan 15, 2003"

At first taste all that I could detect was the the vienna malts. After letting the beer sit for a little I noticed that this beer is very simple in flavor with some mild hopping, but what makes this beer great is that it's finish is so crisp and smooth that this beer is a satisfying treat to be experienced.","WVbeergeek","Dec 27, 2002"

3.85,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours with a firm just off-white head over an attractive coppery/amber liquid. Nose is of new-mown hay, very delicate aromas. Taste is malty, though not heavy-handed maltiness. Leaves a clean aftertaste on the palate. Very little hoppiness to speak of. Light bodied finish, makes a very agreeable "session" beer...if I found this on draught it would be very easy to put alot of this away!","beerluvr","Oct 06, 2002"

The lace is quite good, leaving prominent rings in the glass.  Aroma has a pronounced medicinal quality with underlying sweet and spicy notes.  Taste begins with malt flavors then flows into a distinct apple peel taste accompanied by spices, among them cloves, I think.  Finish is dry with a hopped edge. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety.   An excellent beer.","Pegasus","Sep 29, 2002"
4.3,19.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear, deep reddish-copper in color with an off-white head that holds OK and leaves a good collar with some whispy surface foam, and some good lace. The aroma is bold and welcoming with a gently dark fruitiness, a soft spiciness, some toasted maltiness, and a light suggestion of hops. The body is medium-light with a very fine, and somewhat limited, carbonation level. Very smooth in the mouth with a light caress on the tongue from the gentle effervescence. The flavor is delicate; with a toasted, biscuity maltiness from Vienna malts, a light spiciness (I think from both the yeast - or a possible spice addition - and the Saaz hops), and some medicinal phenols that smooth as the beer warms. Well balanced. The finish is short and dry with just a minimal lingering earthiness. This beer is very drinkable and continually beckons you to have another sip! Very clean and crisp. Quite surprisingly full of character (though not complex) for a beer that starts at only 11.8 Plato. This is what I think of as a standard Belgian artisinal ale. Well worth seeking out, and probably worth buying by the case.","NeroFiddled","Sep 15, 2002"

(This must be an old bottle. Still tastes just fine.) Yeast imparts a tang and spiciness to what otherwise feels like a soft malty British ale. Quite refreshing without being too vigorous. Comfortable and full of character - well balanced. I imagine this would be a good introduction to Belgian style.","Thrasher","Feb 23, 2002"
