3.17,1.3,3.5,3.25,3,3.75,3,"this is pretty bad. well, i shouldnt say bad, its just so overly safe and dumbed down from real belgian pales as to be a new style entirely, really frustrating that people out there who dont know any better think this is craft belgian pale, man are they missing something. its got a really subtle belgian yeast nose, and even less on the taste, just a slight sharp white wine acidity and fruit complexion. the malt base is super light, too light really, and all the hops ever are is a balancing bitterness with a light grassy character, but basically no hop flavor. its just such a simplified version of a great style in all three aspects that its disappointing to me. weird grain funk in the middle of this and it doesnt go well with the yeast. it tastes and feels like it was fermented too warm, and its just not real nice overall. one thing that does work though is the carbonation. its dry and fizzy and full of life, which is its best feature by far. overall this may get a few people into the style, but its so safe and bland that i really dont care for it at all.","StonedTrippin","Oct 11, 2014"

4.25,35.8,,,,,,"I was surprised by this macro version of the Belgian Pale Ale. It poured a dark slightly cloudy brown with a medium head. The aroma was fruity with caramel and that mouthwatering Belgian aroma. The taste was great with caramel, earthy hops, moderately sweet malt and a hint of banana esters. Although I am not usually a big fan of this style, I enjoyed this one from a sampler pack at a neighborhood pig roast and would definitely purchase a case if it is affordable.","wattoclone","Aug 14, 2014"

While it had some potential in the burnt/caramel notes, the malt isn't strong enough to stand up to the bitter citrus and carbonation of this brew. I probably won't buy this again, and would choose the original blue moon over this variety anyway of the week.","Antnego","Jun 14, 2014"

Light medium bodied with a normal carbonation level that produces some effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is nice and well balanced. It begins with a light citrus note that flows into an equally light caramel sweetness. The finish is somewhat crisp, but has a lingering spiciness that is nice.

It doesn't remind me too much of the real Belgian Pale Ales I've had, nor some of the better efforts to copy the style from other countries. Still, it's an ok beer, just not too remarkable. Poured it slightly warm with a huge, foamy, frothy, thick, cream-colored head that soon settles and good lace. Color is a clear orange amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is bark, old wood, cardboard, with a hint of malt and spice. Flavor's like nose, more intense, malt really comes out, tang of course, bit of bitter and some sweet along with some medicinal. Body is big and full but at first has a powerful warming despite its strength, medicinal component leaves an unpleasant lingering bitterness. Finish is as stated, like flavor, and would be much better with popcorn or something to cancel the off flavors.","drpimento","Nov 12, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, and slight yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip.

Extra points from me for a quarter-inch head that maintains throughout most of the session and for some minimal lacing. Not much happening in a good way in the smell department at all: some sourness, a bit of malt, mashed root veggies. So I stopped smelling this one. The taste is alright: starts off on the sweeter side with some faint citrus and malt, finishes a bit dry with some allspice and cloves, then more sweetness. Apparently, there is hibiscus in this beer. Now I had a tequila-hibiscus cocktail a few years ago that was just sublime. But the hibiscus in this beer is burred, which is a shame. It's a drinkable beer for sure, not too bubbly, a nice velvety texture at times. It warms well, too.","kaufmaal","Sep 20, 2013"

The need is out there for a standard (american) belgian pale... However, this isn't it. "Rounder" may have sucked less when it was bottled, but time (and oxidation) has not been kind to this beer.

Tastes are actualky not too bad here with notes of banana, orange, caramel, toasted grain, yeast, bread.  Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, medium bodied; finishes clean.  Overall, not too bad of a BPA, but there are much better ones out there.","barnzy78","Jun 12, 2013"

Color was a button-bright copper. Nose smelled heavily of biscuit malt underlain with a light, perfume-y floweriness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was tending towards sweet, kind of light and flowery. Finish was semi-sweet, tasty, but not compelling, I would tell you that there are better iterations/ interpretations of the style out there.","woodychandler","Jun 05, 2013"

3.29,5.1,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"What, no Ed Norton? No John Malkovich? Anyway, this stuff pours a sunset amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises thick toffee, Belgian yeast, light banana, candied orange peel, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, though there's less toffee (and what is there is drier than before), and there's a stronger emphasis on the spicier aspects of the Belgian yeast and the candied orange peel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this ain't exactly a bad BPA, but it's nothing really worth revisiting. It's a tasty-enough brew to take down amidst the other offerings in the 12-pack, but it's nothing I'd really recommend on its own.","TMoney2591","May 14, 2013"
