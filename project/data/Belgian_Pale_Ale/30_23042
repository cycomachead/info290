It's a seasonal that tends to be available for a good part of the year, and I can usually find it if I'm looking for it.  This is a Belgian-style pale, which I guess confuses some people, and it's not a common style, so maybe that's the issue.  But whatever, it's a good mild pale, perfect for warm spring or fall days.  Give this one a try.","dcscientist","Sep 26, 2014"

Aroma of caramel malt, mixed light fruit, coriander and clove, slightly vegetal. Flavor is light caramel malt, thin light fruit juice, light hops and Belgian yeast. Light bodied. A rather mild and malty take on a Belgian pale, with understated Belgian yeast and light flavors. A kind of hybrid between a Belgian ale and light lager. Pleasant enough, but underwhelming. Not getting the relationship between Belgium and karma, so maybe I'm missing some nuance in this ale.","LiquidAmber","Sep 23, 2014"

The smell is a real tease: bready, honeydew, coriander, some citrus, some funk. For a Belgian-style ale, this one's one of the flattest tasting ales I've had in a while. There's a sour fruit flavor that's on top, some sweetness, a bit of yeast, but the carbonation simply buries any decent ingredients and flavors.","kaufmaal","Nov 09, 2013"

This will be something I look for heading into Oktoberfest season. When I went to post, I discovered this beer is classified as a Belgium Pale Ale. With that as the target, I would like to see more nuance in the malt/sugar profile and a bit more finish to remind me of the tastes that just passed over my tongue.","BuckeyeSlim","Dec 05, 2012"

Taste of grape, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, herbal, earth, pepper, and light yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, biscuit, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Pretty good flavor complexity and balance; no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly crisp and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good Belgian pale ale. Fair amount of complexity and balance; very smooth to drink.

This beer had ok drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, but it was over carbonated and the taste really didn't hold my interest, one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were equally good and were pretty true to style. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and the carbonation, the taste wasn't true to style and the carbonation was a little out of hand. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it doesn't deliver as advertised, and I can't say I would recommend it. This was my first beer from Avery that I didn't care for, this brewery is pretty solid, but this beer turned out to be a rare miss for me from them, I just don't think this beer did the style justice, I am still down to try more of their beers, but so far this is my least favorite beer from them and one of my least favorite Belgian Pale Ales, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jul 31, 2012"

I think anyone might enjoy this beer with a quality feel and mild but tasteful flavoring which includes a subtle hop overtone that finishes just a bit dry.

The carbonation is a bit lacking, and the body is solid without being in any way impressive (it could stand to be a bit fuller).

Citrus doesn't seem hop-derived, but there could be some flavor hops in there somewhere. Carbonation is fuzzy upfront with some astringency, and is flat a second later once it hits the palate.

Mouth-feel is light to medium bodied and carbonation is average. This beer goes down smooth. Avery seems to hit triples and homers with their bigger brews, and singles and doubles with their smaller brews. While this is a good brew that I really can't find fault with, it's not on par with some of their other offerings.

Deep lacing was evident from the start. Nice carbonation bubbling up from the bottom. Smell was intresting, somewhat hoppy, but more of a spiced belgian twist. Hints of Bananas were very noticeable as well as some orange peel. The feel was unusually smooth and a bit flat at first. I actually was not impressed with the first sip, but rather the later ones were much better. Felt very creamy and had a nice lingering finish to it. Muted american hops were mixed in with a nice plae belgian taste. Again bananas and pears, mixed with some earthy bready grains were the commonplace. Overall this was a fairly intresting brew. I did not know what to expect and was defiantly pleasantly suprised. Will have to try it again if I see bottles. Well crafted for sure.","mikesgroove","Jul 12, 2007"

The mouthfeel holds up, but that's about all this one has going for it. I am completely underwhelmed by this Avery effort. The brewery won't likely be remembered for this brew. Give it a try if you're really curious, but there are much better Belgian styles out there to try.","Atlas1","Feb 09, 2007"

Sweet, rich, malty, and clean, but lacks some fundimental Belgian qualities. It lacks the tartness, peppery-ness, and light belgian astringency. The body, sweetness, and alcohol seem fine. The malts (pilsner) seem to be quite caramelized, adding a strong sweetness that would dominate any present belgian character. Quite bready and lightly toffy-like. Pears and peaches share characteristics of Belgian Pale Ales, but the similarities are few.

The head poured thick and cream tan, lots of small bubbles, but the aroma was very flat--a very light fruit if I swirled and dug in deep, but nothing like the yeasty, fruity easters normally in a Belgain ale. The taste is dominated by the yeast, but not malt to back it up. And there was an astringint taste underneath that just puckered my mouth a bit. Not much hop, which is fine, but there's no balance in what's left. Thought maybe the bottle was old, but didn't really taste oxidized--seemed like the beer as intended.

Aroma is somewhat nondescript, nothing notable. Taste kind of disappointingly follows the nose, with light malt sweetness to start, the faintest glimmer of spicing, and a touch of fruity hops.

3.53,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma was nutty with biscuit and fruity esters and taste was toasted caramel malt with a little grass from the understated Sterling hops. I was prepared for a much more traditional Belgian Ale. Avery claims this to be part farmhouse ale part pale ale. I think it is a pale ale with mild Belgium yeast and very understated belgium flavors (coriander and citrus/orange zest oil). Finish is semisweet with caramel malt. Easy drinking at 5.2% abv it is certainly a candidate for a session beer.","karst","Aug 26, 2005"

It has a fine malt scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts along with a peppery/coriander aroma. It's dry with some light fruitiness. The taste is decent. It has a weak malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with some mustiness. It is slightly fruity with a lemony zest and a bit of coriander. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average beer, but not much for a Belgian style. It drinks well, but it's not one to seek out again.","WesWes","Aug 16, 2005"

Smells caramel, chocolate, hop floral. Hops are floral like First Gold, but also have a gentle grapefruity pith and orange oil. Taste is caramel, apricot, mildly hop citrus flavor and bitter (grapefruit pith). Goodness, this is a light and refreshing summer beer that's totally drinkable. It tastes like a candy I've had...dippin' sticks? Plus some oily orange hop mixing with fruity esters. Esters are apricot (I mentioned this before), blackberry, strawberry, a touch of dried hay, and honey. Belgian funk is at a minimum and there is a hint of toasted grains. Light body, but the sugars flow thicker than the beer weighs. Md carbonation, which works well with the flavors. This was a really tasty beer, bordering on complex. Well done.","mentor","Aug 16, 2005"

Slightly hazy, amber colored beer with no signs of carbonation within. Notes of butterscotch and apricot in the aroma. Body is light, and the mouthfeel is somewhere between watery and crisp. Beer is mildly sweet and quite refreshing with its lightly fruity flavors. There might be some floral hops in there, but other then that there isn't a whole going on. According to the label it's supposed to be somewhere between a ""Farmhouse Ale"" and a Belgain Pale Ale. It's got the fruitiness of the pale ale, and that's about it. Not a bad beer, but there is a good amount of fruity flavor without and malt or hops to balance.","HappyHourHero","Jul 30, 2005"

It was not bad tasting, but didn't really taste like a belgian pale. It was very much like a belgian wit with all the spices and fruit kicking in.

Spicy yeast emerges and add a nice flavor to the mix. Finishes pretty clean, leaving you to want for more. Karma is very easy drinking, yet nothing stands out about this beer that makes you say, that it's really spectacular either. I'd give Karma another shot, but with so many options out there, it's probably something that I'd keep passing over for other brews.","Winter","Jun 27, 2005"

The citrusy orange notes definitely are the strongest note in the aroma. The taste is lightly sweet, and again the orange/ citrus note carries through to the taste as well. This beer is light, both in body and on the palate.

It doesn't hit the mark of it's purported style as a Belgian Pale, but it's still decent. The aroma is quite fruity (plums, dates, hint of peach) with some pleasant nutty yeast overtones. This ale was served to me at about 50 degrees F, and warmed quickly, enhancing the aroma and taste. Taste is a bit nutty with some belgian malt flavorings, and more dark fruit and caramel, with a hint of baking french bread. Mouthfeel is phenolically oily and smooth, with a hint of hoppy bitterness at the end. Drinkability is good. A decent ale, but definitely not a belgian pale, or even a american version of one.
