"Clear golden colour, small head that fades soon, minimal lace. Smell is sweet,floral, vanilla, coconut, honey. Light boyd, creamy palate. Taste is similar to the smell: Vanilla, honey and coconut."

"O: Yes, an 8 out of 10 seems appropriate for this brew.  Great label, interesting name, and yet it’s a very simple but unique brew.  Really not a lot going on, but simplicity sometimes hits the spot for uniqueness.  Saw this in Brussels but had no chance to try it due to all the other options.  Found this at Yorkshire Bar in Kunming, where the owner gave it to me due to his awesome service skills."

"Pours hazy golden beer with decent 2-finger white head, good retention. Smell of honey, yeasts, grass, pale malts, troll sweat 8). Flavour is close to russian minibreweries, commonly yeasty, slightly honey, grass and malts. Normal brew for unnormal belgians. Medium body, moderate carbonation."

"The beer is hazy and yellow with a half inch of pure white head. The aroma brings fruity esters, yeast, booze, grain. Notes of pineapple and grass with a mild but present alcohol. A tad sweet with a mild warmth in the finish. Light bitterness in the finish with lingering tropical fruits. This was pretty good."

"Overall...a refreshing beer but nothing remarkable."

"There's an improvement in the taste. The flavor is malty-sweet with far less grain. Very full bodied with a low carbonation. Some alcohol warmth. Low hop that only shows up (weakly) in the swallow. Short aftertaste."

"A pleasant enough BSPA, one whose alcohol and yeast are kept well in check, which makes things all the more agreeable to this camper. I may have to bogart another of these little bottles from my source."

"O: Medium drinkability but I was expecting more from a Dubuisson beer"

"served in perhaps the coolest glassware known to man, this is a very light bodied stronger pale ale. pours hazy and pale, almost white in a dim lit pub, with a lasting white head, sexy looks. smells is less sexy, standard malts and belgian yeast, a little fruity, wheat, lemon rind. flavor is balanced but rather subtle for such a strong brew. its not watery in feel, but the flavor is very light, grassy and drinkable, but largely unexciting. feel is great, classic belgian effervescence and a less than medium body. plenty sessionable in my opinion, despite the invisible 7% abv. overall its a very well made beer, lacking somewhat in flavor, but could be good with a hearty cheeses and breads course. not bad at all."
"Pours a slightly murky yellow with a white head that settles to a thin cap. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spices, grape juice, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it tastes better than it smells in my opinion."

"Pours a golden yellow color with a tinge of orange and a slight hazy transparency. Has a nice 2 finger head with a perfect white head and a lacing that tracks each sip. The aroma is of sour apples, lemon peel and a grassy hay like aroma, slightly sour. The taste is bright and vibrant, lack of malt favors hurt this beer and it's too acidic for my tastes. Nice cleansing feeling with the citrus but overall it's a pass for me if I am looking for a nice Belgian pale ale."
"On tap at Cheeky Monk on Colfax the beer is served to a tulip. Arrives a brilliant hazy golden color with a 1.5 finger white head, some retention and lacing. The nose is rather mild with a strong biscuity malt character and a hint of citrus and pepper. The flavor is an improvement with an increased citrus character. Light biscuity malt blend nicely with a mild bitterness. Very approachable. No hint of alcohol. Finishes with a clean malty citrus flavor. Crisp and well carbonated and lighter medium bodied. Overall, an easy drinking Belgian for sure. I'd have another, refreshing."
"Overall: a very tasty and extremely enjoyable beer. This sort of thing is precisely to my taste. I love it."
"O: Quite a beer to clench your thirst with."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-orange amber. Foamed out of the bottle on opening, aggressive carbonation. Massive white head and nice lacing. Pleasant light fruit (apples and citrus) and light Belgian spices aroma. Taste is similar, nice sweet light fruit, light Belgian spicing and a bit of hop kick. Fairly understated, but the flavors are well balanced and tasty. Not as good as the better Belgian Belgian strong dark ales, but I enjoyed drinking this."

"not good! not good! Not good! not good not good not good not good. I think that you can go over by this beer! ...sour also the taste. with yeast. not good not good not good -- not good not good not good not good. we don't like it. there are a lot of strong ales more good!"

"D: I enjoyed this - call it somewhere between Duvel Single (the green label) and regular Duvel. I'd have it again."

"This beer is a foamy, light golden color. There’s some musty hop aromas both muted and floral. A light, crisp Belgian fruitness on the palate. It has a smooth—real smooth—and effervescent finish. A solid if not terribly exciting expression of a Belgian pale ale."
""
""
"I usually enjoy blondes but I felt that this beer is really unbalanced. It's refreshing to an extent and isn't trying to be something over the top, but I could really do without that extra ABV here. For the low price, not a bad bargain, but there are far, far more interesting Belgian blondes."
""
"O - decent beer, helps that I'm drinking it late at night in Belgium, but compared to other beers isnt anything too special."
""
"jd"
"This one was a letdown, I was expecting way more from this one, a supposed limited edition, 10th anniversary release..."
"O - Didn't like it. Chouffe is much better than this one. If you're not a sweet tooth, steer clear."
"OK overall - marked down due to price vs 250ml bottle ize."
"O- The fizz dominates this beer with soft notes of hops and some yeast character coming through but not much. This beer turns a bit water after the carbonation burns up."
"Dr: Easily downable - not that you'd want to - but it's well priced. ABV is high."
"Lit-up foggy, silky-champagne color, smart-foamy transient head. Vague malt and musty/floral Belgian-yeast aroma. Surprisingly (pale-ale-)malt forward flavor, low-on-juicy white fruit essence. Rounded, finely-frayed edges and strangely dull on the tongue. Dry, mostly, yet allowing a sweatened-skin dampness. Not what I expected - thrown off by its almost cereal malt boldity. Nice, but not at that price."
"Poured a clear golden color, noticeably carbonated, with a thin, spotty head. Light grainy aroma, floral, and not too strong. Good balance of light hops and pale malts in the taste, slightly grainy, mild sensation of orange zest. Dry finish, and a little funk goingn on towards the middle of the glass. Light body and generally drinkable for those who prefer lighter beers, but not too distinctive, and not something I'd get more than once."
"Pours a hazed golden straw, big cap of frothy white bubbled, ok lacing. Scent is pale, lemony and grassy with notes of musty straw, light spice and some yeastyness. Taste follows suit - ight and pleasent all around. Active carbonations, lighter bodied. A nice drink on a warm summer day, light all around, but no off notes."
"If you like mild lager beers, then this is for you. Otherwise, I would search something else."
"Lots of light carbonation. Overall a tasty beer but not something I'd go out of my way to seek out."
"Served at the newest Sharp Edge location, poured into it's official frosted chalice with the troll wearing a hophat as pictured on the label. A pale golden light pilsner like brightness with a slight yeast haze, bright white thicket of head with fine even Belgian style lacing. Aroma had a nice apricot nose with grassy herbal hops complementing the fruitiness. Flavor again fruity juice like apple tone with a mix of light hops bascially watered down hop juice just a touch of grassiness and nice bready yeast tones in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied scary how pale this is goes down really easily if only my wallet could keep up I believe it was around 8 or 10 bucks for a small chalice, and they clamied it was 10 percent abv. Carbnoation level is effervescent goes down like a glass of perry or carbonated cider. Overall impression is a decent take at a Belgian Pale, not the most complex or enjoyable version but decent. Catch this one during happy hour where Beigian drafts are half off."
"Not a tough one to put down, but really not among my favorite of the style."
"A bit thin and watery - if this were more carbonated it would be more reminiscent of a lager. A decent beer, but a little too sweet and weak. One of these every now and then is more than enough."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's a little light for the style but still a decent beer to drink for a while."
"I'm not really impressed with this."
"D: Not particularly spectacular or anything but very easy to drink and very refreshing. Nice one for the summer."
"Felt good in the mouth, not too light, with just the right carbonation. I really enjoyed this one."
"D - Lovely and pleasant to drink. Definitely unusual and a good aperitif/pre-dinner drink. Aftertaste might be a problem after a while..."
"Overall a very nice surprise and worth a try for the American IPA lover who wants to branch into (or re-visit) the Belgian styles."
"Very drinkable. Very tasty."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, lemon zest and yeast. In the taste, lemon zest, a sweet malt and a small hop presence, a bit earthy too. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry yeasty lemon citrus in the aftertaste. Saison like with sweet lemons, I can dig it."
"D: Between the horrible taste/aftertaste and the high alcohol, I would have to say this is one of the worst beers I have ever had."
"M/D: Carbonation bit thin, a bit too alcoholic (but what can you expect from the brewery that makes the most alcoholic beer in Belgium),"
"O: Ok, but not great. The strong bitterness isn't pleasant (especially for the style) which prevents me from jumping for this beer."
"D - despite not having a great appearance, nose, flavor, or mouthfeel this one oddly went down easily. maybe i was just trying to finish it quickly and move on. not a terrible beer, about the best compliment i could give it now."
"Delicious as expeted Cuvee des Trolles gets caught somewhere between a Belgian Pale, a Saison, and a Triple."
"One of the worst Belgian brews I have had."
"D-Overall this is a decent BSPA. Its pretty champagne/tripel like and gives the impression of being lightly fruity, dry, and spritzy. Still fairly drinkable and well put together though not anywhere near my favorite of the style."
"25cl bottle: Picked this up in an Auchan in France. This one poured a crystal clear golden color. There was a frothy white head on it that dropped away rather quickly. Surprisingly lighter aroma. A little yeasty and a bit grassy. Maybe some very faint spice. The body is a little lighter also. As is the taste. Some malts, breadiness, pepper. A touch dry finish. Certainly not the best Belgian Strong Ale I have ever had, but still OK. I like the little troll on the label."
"The body was medium, the aftertaste was a little dry, not bad overall but really not anything that stands out among its competition."
"Drinkability: Good beer from Belgium, but overall a light affair. Certainly worth trying out, and decently sessionable despite the ABV."
"D: Not a mind blowing beer, but a nice little Belgian. Unfortunately, a little pricey, so I don't know if I'd bother with this one again."
"25 cl. is gone very quickly."
"Nice hazy yellow pour with a thick white head. Nothing special with the aroma, a bit yeasty. It tastes a bit sweet with bready yeast flavors. Very drinkable and the alcohol is very well hidden. Overall a great beer!!"
"Note: Nothing outstanding here, but it is a nice refreshing beer. Worth a try but not really worth going to much trouble to seek it out."
"Former Bush 7, the Troll has a bunch of strong citrus flavor bitter. The taste is long on the palate, a pleasant roundness and is easily tasted the flavor of orange peel. The power of these returns even citrus aftertaste as a somewhat sweet syrup. Neither acid nor hot, it offers a finish of good bitter hops with a return to delay. A beer with the power of the Dubuisson brewery without that alcohol is ubiquitous."
"D: Not a bad beer, but on the plain side."
"D-Good sipper, and the light body makes it dangerously easy to drink. This is a lighthearted brew w/nice fruit notes, and it won't kick your ass like a lot of other strong pales."
"Bottle at Chaucer's Pub in London, Ont- A hazy yellow pour is capped with a thick finger of bleached white head, that leaves moderate lace. Aromas are faint, but balanced. Spicy, slight floral, some bread, grass, and hops. A mild bite of spices and fruit enter the mouth. Mild bready flavours, with some sweetness, and mild alcohol. Soft carbonation, an easy drinker considering the ABV. Probably a touch under-rated IMO. Thanks for getting this one in Milos!"
"The mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer are exceptional. In all an excellent thirst quencher. In fact, the beer is gone and resting happily in my belly."
"Overall: Decent brew, but not too special for the style. Very easy to drink, but lacks body. Will not refuse another one though"
"Not the sort of thing I would normally go for, but good for what it is.. .may they sell many a Troll... as long as it keeps 'em making Scaldis."
"Overall this wasn't a bad beer by any stretch but it's not one I'll seek out again."
"Good Summer Ale. Beer poured from tap a hazy yellow color, which just a bit of head. Nothing altogether of note in the smell other than the hops. Taste was fruity with just a slight bit of bitterness. The beer drank easily - light without much carbonation."
"Overall, there are so many better brews within the style. Still glad to have tried just for the sake of something new. I read on the bottle that it is a filtered brew, which might explain the lack of depth and character of the brew. Perhaps an unfiltered or bottle-conditioned version would be better?"
"I pour my Cuvee des Trolls into my nifty Cuvee des Trolls glass and it's hard to tell if the beer is cloudy or not. (the glass is frosted) It seemed fairly clear as I poured it. There is a very white head. Nose is airy. Barely any perception of grains there. Flavor is quite sweet at first. A bit too much I would have to say. It mellows a good bit, but still remains slightly too much. Citrus is there, yes. Beyond that there isn't much. The overpowering nature of the sweetness at first sets the tone for a not so thrilling ride. Feel is full on carbonation and the liquid is slightly thin for the style. An okay beer. Cool glass though."
"Notes from: 6/14/04"
"Overall: A very enjoyable experience in itself, that starts from the moment you see the label until the last sip you take from your Banana perfumed glass. Will have again."
"drunk on the bottle, it'll be even easier. A really nice beer in deed. Served on it's awesome glass, it's transformed into a mid-strong lightely ambered belgian style beer... but it can be compared to a strong california ale, so it can be drunk even on hot summer and cold winter... really interesting indeed..."
"It's a bit of a misnomer to consider this a Belgian Strong Pale in the Duvel tradition which this clearly is not attempting to be... rather, it fits into the Belgian tradition of not giving a flying fuck about style guidelines. It's a strong Belgian ale that happens to be pale. And not terribly exciting. And maybe with a diacetyl problem. That's all."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Belgian strong pale ale."
"d- very drinkable, as i said, not a ton of flavor but it's pleasantly light. at 7% you could get ahead of yourself with this one on a hot day. i like it. give it a try."
"There is a fairly earthy quality to this blond ale but that's where the distinctiveness ends. Herbal hops but overall a quite sweet blond. Medium bodied with a sweetish aftertaste. Nothing earthshattering but it was an enjoyable and drinkable brew. Worth a shot if you can find it on draft."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice beer with a somewhat unique character for the style. The alcohol comes through rather strongly for a beer of only 7% ABV, but somehow this doesn't make it less drinkable. Recommended!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep golden ale with a white foamy head with good retention and some minimal lacing. Aroma of Belgian malt with some sweetness and some notes of dry European hops. Taste is also dominated by some sweet malt notes with light bitter and dry notes of hops. Medium body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol."
"This beer poured a golden color with a slight white head giving way to a nice ring on the edge. The nose of the beer was slightly hoppy and citrus but subtle as you don't get kicked in the head with hops as the label may have you believe. The taste is also not overly hopped. there is a slight malt character and hops notes to round out a decent beer."
"On a final note; the higher than usual ABV wasn't even noticed during my tasting session - another big plus for this beer!"
"D: Very approachable, and, for a strong ale, quite more-ish."
"Taste is yeasty with some solvent and fruity peach notes. There is a light bitter and malt is faintly present. A light spiciness in the back. Actually there were no real complex flavors in this beers. The yeast wasn't really special and hops and malt were not very outspoken. Body was kind of thin. Just a standard blond beer, nothing special."
"And this was a very fresh brew, thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam. I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy direct from the brewer."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet."
"Cuvee de Troll was a beer I found hard to conclude anything on. I had almost written it off after my first few sips but as I got further in I found myself enjoying it more. Not a particularly complex beer - especially not for a Belgian - but it was certainly not bad. Flavours were hard to pin point as - though present - were not at all bold. Some grainy malt, light pepeery spice. A lingering dry finish. Faint alcohol with some fruity airness. What I would consider a decent aroma and mouthfeel as well. Average bouquet with neutral texture and carbonation. Overall it was enjoyable but not rememberable. All the same, a good job by the Dubuissons."
"25 cl bottle served in proper glass at t' Brugs Beertje in Brugge on 9/13/06."
"The problem with this beer was that, at least for me, it was good but unmemorable. Then again, after an evening at Smokeless Joe, you have to expect things to become a little 'unmemorable'... will review again at some point to make sure I'm not imagining things."
"D: Certainly approachable, but I didn't find it overly engaging."
"Typical pale Belgian in appearance. Frosted glass - dedicated Cuvee des Trolls glass. Who could resists trolls! Apple and soy sauce aromas. The apples also show up in the flavour, along with sweetness, some yeastiness, grain and light hop bitterness in the finish. A little bit boozy and drying. Not the most flavourful for the style, but refreshing. Wouldn't regret having another, but there are better examples of the style."
"This would definitely be a pleaser amongst a variety of beer enthusiasts, as it's not your typical pale ale, it really has something all its own. Another fantastic beer from the Dubuisson brewery."
"this brew, if you can track down a bottle, is liquid gold."
"I'm in love!"
"Drinkability: Excellently smooth, well balanced and enjoyable. To me this beer tastes like a better version of the Bush Blonde that stands at 10%. At 7% this tastes like a more realistic and natural interpretation of the same beer. I tasted the two beers side by side and I definately prefer this Cuvée Des Trolls."
"Hazy golden beer with a big, rocky, white head. Quite a bit of lacing ended up on the glass. Light fruit and spice in the nose, quite sweet with some alcohol. Flavour is sweet up front with some pear. Light bitterness that leads into a medium dry finish that has some pepperiness and alcohol warmth at the end. Texture is a bit creamy, medium body, carbonation on the lower side."
"Not so much body, well carbonated, aftertaste with the same notes, but nothing remarkable, again. Maybe some flowers and hops."
"An acceptable Belgium. Yeast and sugar. Sweet syrup sugar at the start, with a long yeasty finish. Dry aftertaste. Hard carbonation on tongue. Yeast and floral aroma, nothing too strong. Medium mouthfeel. Alcohol kicks in, and is masked by the sugar. Smokless Joe's has the dedicated mug . A little more appreciated in bottle had 7 years later."
"Best before 24-06-05. Poors in nicly givving a nice head that lasts and leaves nice laces at the glas. Futher an opalizing golden beecolor. Nose is quiet flat( maybe cause of age) having some malts but lots of esters giving it a fruity nose and a hint of hoparome. Overal not 100% fresh though. Taste is quiet dull too having some malttaste, quiet sweet, alcoholic and then going into a moderate but litle hanging bitterness. Lots of carbonisation makes mouthfeel more lively and litle better then taste but one was enough for me. No bad beer though."
"Pours a hazy golden into its distinctive frosted glass which makes in a little difficult to rate its appearance. Floral aroma, passion fruit, nice dessert smell. Taste was a lot of piney hops, and some fruit. Mouthfeel was crisp from the hops, yet still quite smooth, quite a duality. I had had a few too many by the time I had this, so I would like to try it again just to make sure my notes are correct."
"The beer disembarks the 330ml brown bottle a slightly hazy lemon yellow color with a middling sized semi-creamy bright white head and as it evaporates, the resultant lace forms a thin velum like sheet to surround the glass. Nose is fruity, nice malt, crisp and clean to the senses with the start ambrosial, light malt presence and the top thin. Finish has a benign acidity, the hops delicate upon the palate, dry lingering aftertaste, a nice light way to end the day."
"Overall Impression: Tasted this beer at the '03 Belgian Beer Weekend and I liked it quite a bit. However, this sampling wasn't as good as I remembered it. And I seem to remember a nice layer of head on the first one. Even so, a nice little beer."
