"Overall: Not realizing that this brewery focuses on belgian style ales, i saw amber ale on the label and went for it. I dont know why this is classified as an amber ale? Its a straightforward belgian pale ale if you ask me. It has that classic Belgian spice and yeast with some fruit complexity. One of the better American Belgian style ales iv had actually. Overall a solid beer in a style i normally wouldnt seek out"
"Deep copper. medium lacing. thick head. moderate carbonation. taste of Belgian pale and hop"

"Suggestions of apple, citrus zest, allspice, cinnamon, and floral, grassy notes can all be parsed.  Alcohol is moderate, and the beer closes with a medium, balanced finish."
"Guess it's the east. Just not a big fan."
""
""
""
"It's a Belgian pale. Or an amber. But not exactly either. Has the yeast aroma you expect from Ommegang with a mix of clove and banana on the nose. Highly carbonated in appearance and texture, which is juxtaposed with a creaminess that I found rather appealing. This beers maintains a thin but dense head all the way to the bottom of the glass. Little to no hop punch, this is malt and yeast forward beer to be sure. Not a huge fan of ambers in general but this is one of the better ones I've had, perhaps because of its departure from the style."
""
"""Belgian IPA"" is what they call it. I get that. It's more sweet than hoppy, and consequently reads like a mild dubbel."
"deep cognac orange color with heavy head.  slightly boozy and sweet banana nose (after warmed in a snifter).  highly carbonated mouthfeel.  taste is dominated by belgian yeast, accents of pepper and coriander, and a general slight fruit sweetness.  it was hard to pinpoint any specific sweet flavors in this pour. aftertase is belgian yeast and slight fruit."
"Par for the course for a good triple"
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Farther from Amber ale than expected, resembles a witbier in overall character and taste with strong yeast overtones."
""
""
"Not much on the nose , grain, clove some yeast. Great carbonation, creamy feel. Taste is crisp, yeast, pepper, hops are there and alcohol at the end. Like pretty much everything from Brewery Ommegang, Great Brew!"
""
""
"Enjoyable Belgian beer done by one of the best in the business . . . Ommegang."
""
"Ommegang never ceases to amaze. Rare Vos pours a beautiful orange-gold and tastes like every other amber ale should taste. It's not a beer that you'll shed a tear over, but it stands as what should be the beer all other beers model themselves after."

"Overall: A great take on a Belgian style ale. Good mix of spices and fruit flavors with a nice touch of toasty malt."
"This is a goto for me it is mellow easy drinking. Citrus notes very low bitterness. It has a touch more caramel then I would like . Like a Caramel orange which is different but it is really good with food it did a bang up job with Thai spicy noodle."
"Very very tasty beer, first one I've enjoyed from this brewery"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a lot of fine sediment in suspension, billowing off-white head, settles slowly to a thin ring, fair amount of lace trailed down the glass. Smell: mild nectarine, apple cinnamon muffin, notes of orange and pepper. Taste: nectarine, orange and brown sugar themed bread, mild grassiness, slight lemon with nectarine skin and spiciness in the finish. Creamy into fluffy feel. Everything is in moderation here, but quite tasty. Best by 9/2015."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Little smell with a salt water feel."
""
""
""
"T: Banana and cloves but with funk. Grape must, stone cling peaches and good citrus component--orange. Lots of perfumey coriander, perhaps too much for my liking. Really really good ovreall tho."
""
"Yeasty. This is a sweet amber colored ale with caramel notes on the eye. In tucking into this, the yeast and fruit notes come right to the forefront. Slight banana and clove feel whilst the yeast really takes over."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I drank a glass of this very quickly. Second glass, not so much. Lacked a bit of excitement."
"Spices too much like a clove cigarette"
""
"Overall: This one needs some improvement in the mouthfeel as far as a more enjoyable beer. However, in terms of drinkability, it is top of the list. I find this beer very quaffable. Overall, great showing from one of the best craft breweries in the States and a damn good Belgian one at that."
"a beer like this is simply not an exceptional beer, at least not for me, that being said in the realm of amber ales this is about as good of an amber ale as you are likely to have, it retains the ease of consumption of the style while taking that proprietary house yeast in the belgian style and bringing something new to an amber ale, it removes what to me is an often unpleasant though not overwhelming hoppiness, this is at any rate an great beer for any occasion, though not an altogether special beer, use this instead of your boring amber ales for a party and enjoy"

"O: [2.50] I really dislike Belgian yeast.  It doesn't agree with me and this is a one note beer with just that single note.  Unfortunately that means I didn't finish it."

"Pours with a nice, clingy, yellow-white head,  Golden-hued and slightly cloudy.  Aroma is of coriander, allspice, orange peel and a hint of apricot.  Sweet start with some sour notes in the back of the palate.  Dry on tongue, well-carbonate with a long finish.  A very enjoyable beer before dinner!"

"I usually find I don't like Belgian Pale Ales for some reason, but the Rare Vos is an awesome brew! It would be good with a lot of different types of meats and cheeses. The heartier the food, the better with this one. Go get yourself some Rare Vos and experience a massively flavorful and easy drinking Belgian Pale Ale!"

"Man this is a pretty brew! A gentle pour yielded a massive foamy head sitting on a copper body. My mouth is already watering. The nose is mostly malts with a little of the belgian yeast. The taste is lots of malt and belgian yeast with a little hop buttering. Awesome. Great carbonation. Tiny bubbles streaming from the center like champagne. I love Ommegang brews and this doesn't disappoint."

"Great rusty gold-orange color, full of life on a swirl. Smell is a little faint, but I get mild caramel, apricot, brown sugar. Taste is a nice balance between sweetness and malt, a bit of a pleasant lingering aftertaste. Very nice Belgian style, thankfully stopping short of being too sweet."

"O: Amber ales - even Belgian-style ones - aren't really my cup of tea. This, though, is very well done. Nuanced and subtle yet easy to drink, this would pair fantastically with food. I'll have to pick this up again, that's for damn sure."
""
""
"O - quite possibly the most underrated of all of Ommegang's great brews. I know they miss the mark on occasions with some releases, but their core group as well as some of their special releases are all top notch and for me this is the one that's overlooked at times. But I tell you, this may be Ommegang's best overall beer. It goes well when paired with about anything imaginable and is very drinkable. In fact, its one that could be enjoyed all day long in any season of the year. Here is my tribute to Rare Vos, the remarkable sly fox from New York's Belgian brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a ""cafe"" beer, the ABV on this seems a little high. I'd like to think they could make this beer taste the same at more of a Wit-level of alcohol. Still, this is a tasty, far from oversweet BPA with nice notes of spice. Certainly a good day-drinking beer."
""
"O: the uniqueness in this beer has always been its bold toastiness, nutty malt character, and distinct fruity flavor... excellent brew, especially on tap"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy copper with an off white head. The smell is quite nice, mostly caramel with apple crispness. Nice light, crisp mouthfeel. To me, this beer is quite straightforward, but does a very good job of it. I got brown sugar and apples right off the bat, followed quickly by the belgian yeast, very clove like. Leaves a nice clove spice on your palette. Easy to drink, I could definitely have more than one. One of the better belgian-style beers I have had in awhile, I would definitely recommend it."

"This belgian style pale ale pours a hazy amber hue with a fluffy lasting white head that leaves beautiful foamy lacing. The nose is dominated by caramel malts, orange, coriander, pepper, and Belgian-y yeasty funkiness. The mouthfeel is creamy, effervescent, and quite rich. The flavor follows the nose but with even more complexity, balance, and depth. This is a very good beer and an excellent introduction to belgian ales for those strictly used to American offerings."

"Overall, this is a great brew that I think I had one before in a large bottle. It may benefit from being on tap or corked as this one was a12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was pretty impressed with this beer. The more you drank, the more you knew how beautifully crafted it was. The caramel malt presence in the flavor added a rich dimension to this Belgian Pale I can't remember experiencing elsewhere. Very nice."
""
"O - second time around with this one, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd buy this again if the price was right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer overall. As I'm not a huge fan of belgian beers in general, I enjoyed the fact that Rare Vos was extremely well balanced in terms of keeping the sugary Belgian flavors to a pleasant minimum. I didn't feel overwhelmed by these sugars and felt that they were kept in check by a pleasant level of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium carbonation, medium body, but a touch chewy. Also the initial blast of carbonation was soda like but it quickly calmed down."

""
"Overall- Very tasty, and one I've returned to many times. recommend trying."
""
""
"O: Solid offering from Ommegang; it evaded me for a long time, but I'm glad I finally picked a bottle up. For the price tag, this is definitely something I'll be buying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would recommend trying this beer with some braised pork belly. It pulls fat off the palate excellently."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a dark amber/orange in color with a NICE three finger head with good retention. Smell is of nice Belgian yeast -- bananas and cloves. A little fruity in the nose but the yeast takes the forefront here. Taste is more of the nice Belgian yeast and what was in the nose. There is a little fruity hops with a great aftertaste that includes a slight bitterness but not overwhelming. I really love the Belgian yeast so this is all win for me. Mouthfeel is really quite thick for the style which is hard to do and keep all these variables together in such a nice beer. Really a nice beer that I haven't had for years and really glad I tried it again."
""
""
"Bought a few of the Ommegang christmas packs so am regular with Rare Vos. Good looking beer that smells very good. Very tasty, one of the better Ambers. Like the beer but would not buy on its own but would certainly buy as a value along with some of the other Ommegang beers. Excellent beer but not a great buy alone."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- overall very good beer, excellent belgian style beer at a reasonable price! Would definitely purchase again and share with friends"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is yet another zesty, vibrant, drinkable Belgian-style ale from Ommegang. This would be dynamite in the summer or spring."

"O- a great beer for my 500th. I would love a case of it. This goes in to my top 10!!!"
""
"O- It's a well made beer which makes me wish it was more flavorful than it was. It is a dialed back version of a Belgian Dubbel and seemed muted."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a great look and feel but is lacking in taste in my mind. Needs more citrus or more maltiness to keep it from tasting flat. I love Ommegang and I think they do Belgians right, but this is a bit lacking for me. Wish I liked it more. I'll try it in bottle to see if its the keg but maybe I'm just not a fan."
""
""
""
"Beer was purchashed on tap at the Eagle Tavern in Liverpool, NY (they no longer have it on tap). Outstanding beer. I would recommend this to all of the beer lovers."
""

"O: Solid beer – great flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Overall, this is pretty good, but brace yourself for an overwhelming spice thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding."
"O- Love this beer for its somewhat intense bubble gum flavor that has a generous dose of malt and yeastiness (is that a word?)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber color with one finger head that lasts throughout the drinking process. Solid lacing. This is a beautiful looking beer. A bit yeasty to the nose with a hint of fruit. Tastes great. I mean outstanding. The balance is almost perfect. It goes down smooth and ends with a fruity, hoppy finish. The aftertaste leaves something to be desired but the initial flavor is exceptional. Overall, this is an awesome beer. I would recommend this to a friend in a heartbeat."
""
""
""

"Overall: A great belgian style amber that showcases fruity malt character tempered by belgian yeast spicy and earthiness."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer It was only a dollar to upgrade from a budlight and worth every penny($4 a pint $14 a pitcher on non special days). This is a perfect end of summer beginning of fall brew, fruity enough to be enjoyed on a hot day but enough spice to remind one that the leaves are changing and the weather is becoming cooler. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again and highly recommend it to others. Plus at 6.5 abv theres enough to give a solid buzz but not so much that it would be unsafe to drive after ordering another."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an above average example of the style since it's pretty much a straight forward Belgian Pale Ale, but the caramel malts add a little something extra to it and I thought it worked well with this beer. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, but I don't think I could drink more than one or two of these since I think the carbonation would really start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was the fruit profile in the aroma and taste, it was a nice mixture of fruits that worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, I know this style is suppose to have a higher carbonation, but I thought it was a little out of control. I think I would buy this beer again, but not very often and I think it might go well with food and it's not too over priced. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian Pale Ales, even through it's not the truest to style it still has most of the key attributes that define this style. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it wasn't my favorite of the style, but I thought it was pretty nice and a little unique. Good job guys this is a solid easy drinking beer that's pretty close to a Belgian Pale Ale, i'm happy I gave this beer a try."

"o: A highly drinkable Belgian style amber ale. Liked this better than Hennepin, though it would be interesting to try them side by side. Three Philosophers is still my favorite Ommegang of the four I have tasted so far because of its relative dark maltiness, but Rare Vos would probably be second to that, and the superior warm weather drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very different brew. The phenols are somewhat offputting, and the buttery toffee caramel base dominates. The high carbonation robs the mouth of the flavor too early."

"Packaged in April 2013. Poured into tulip glass for review. Pours clear amber with frothy white head. Very little lacing. Smells spicy with black pepper & clove, notes of sweet citrus (orange peel), coriander. Spicy phenols persist after other aromas fade from the nose. Tastes sweet, yet finishes dry. Lemon & orange flavors with ample hop bitterness. Bitterness lingers and stings the tip of the tongue. Feels about medium full. Alcohol kept well in check. A delicious beer. Very well brewed and solid all around. Love the complexity and aptly priced for a Belgian made in America."

"Overall Impression: An enjoyable, complex, and interesting take on a Belgian pale ale that is certainly worth the taste! However, being neither altogether crisp and refreshing, nor very satisfying and filling, it left a bit of an emptiness in my belly. Could have done with less of the citrus fruit. There's already so much going on, that cutting back on the oranges a notch may actually bring out more of that complexity."
"Cloudy dark golden color with giant marshmallow floating over top. Aroma Belgian fruitiness: cinnamon apples, oranges in vodka, rinds, honey, and sharp spices. Taste of cinnamon apples, oranges and rind, honey, clove, and I aggressive but still noticeable booze. Big bodied but oddly, not that chewy, more fluffy. Easy drinkin' and flavorful. Nice for summer evenings."

"This beer pours a reddish amber with a little haze and smells mildly fruity, orange with hints of spice. It’s creamy with a big head, but almost no retention. Good lacing and the taste is smooth . Again Ommegang has the made the perfect dubbel in that you can taste no alcohol except a touch in the finish. Little pepper on the nose and it’s a little on the thin side. Sweet yeasty malty, soft on the carbonation with a slightly sticky, dry finish. Although the hops are not up front on the palate they balance nicely with the malt and this beer is very delicious without tasting too heavy. Ommegang never fails to delight and this is a superb and contemporary Belgian Pale Ale."

"O: A four or six-pack of Rare Vos might just be one of my go-to beer choices from now on. And what’s more, I just brewed a light beer with orange peel, so this is a perfect archetype that I can look at my missteps with – hell, if I can ever make a beer this good, I’ll quit my job. A beauty of a beer!"

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 11/13/2012. Pours moderately hazy and cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big banana, pear, apple, orange peel, light caramel, clove, pepper, coriander, floral, bread, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with malt and spices. Taste of big banana, pear, apple, orange peel, clove, pepper, light caramel, bread, coriander, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, orange peel, clove, pepper, caramel, bread, coriander, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with malt sweetness and spices; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, foamy, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian pale ale! Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink, even at high carbonation. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"O- Again, I think there is something off about this particular bottle of a beer that I am quite familiar with, but it was still enjoyable. It almost seems like a sour version of Rare Vos, which doesn't work quite as well as a fresh Rare Vos on draft."
""
""
"O) Enjoyed this beer... Sometimes spices in a brew can be a bit much for my tastes, but this was nice. Very well done... Could definitely unwind with a few of these. One of the better Belgian Pale Ales, I've had the pleasure of drinking. Glad to recommend this beer."
""
""
"Overall: Nice, everyday Belgian Ale, but the 6.5% abv keeps this from being as sessionable as it tastes. However, I guess 6.5% is a session beer for Belgians."

"Overall: My favorite Ommegang brew. I followed their pairing directions and have had it with pub food - pizza, wings, side of fries or onion rings - it really is a easy drinking, medium alcohol beer that is great at home or out at your favorite bar or restaurant. A nice introductory Belgian for newcomers to the various Belgian styles. The women in my family love this as well - a beer for everyone really and ranks in my top 10 favorite, ever."

"overall: another treat from ommegang"
""
""
""
"Golden-hued, with an orange cast. The frothy head fades fairly quickly. The nose, concentrated in a 12-oz. tulip, is of toffee, citrus, and pepper, satisfyingly affirmed by the taste. The beer is refreshingly prickly on the palate. This sophisticated blend of flavors, combined with a relatively modest ABV, makes for a noteworthy thirst-quencher, and an able accompaniment to a piquant meal."

"One of the best beers to be had. I found this as a three dollar beer pint night at the flying saucer. What a difficult name to remember though. Normally $5/pint. Good enough to make me want to sign up and make my first comment. The smell and the taste remind me of armangnac or calvados or perhaps an armenian brandy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll start saying that this beer is a winner. It pours as a beautiful amber beer, with a white, well-retained neck. The orange peel and spices are absolutely clear. It is so great. The palate has a caramelized malt, not at all sweet, showing wonderfully expressed pepper-like tones. The high carbonation, and the hops, well balanced with malt and spices, is what we expect from the style. The aftertaste brings us hops and... pepper! What a wonderful beer. Perfect for a more intellectual conversation (I'm sure the 6.5 ABV would help...)."
""
""
""
"Poured into an Ommegang flute glass. Pours a coppery golden amber with a three finger white head with good retention and lacing. Pleasant aroma of clove, peach, pear and citrus fruit, light banana, enticing. Flavor is relatively muted compared to the aroma, with biscuit malt, caramel , finishing somewhat dry with a lingering dry caramel aftertaste with hints of hops. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. An unusual flavor combination that is well integrated so that individual caramel, light fruit and yeast flavors reveal themselves and fade away during the taste. I greatly enjoyed this ale, as I have all of Ommegang's offerings."

""
"O- Amazing. Try it."

"Overall: Upon coming into this beer, I was told great things by beer lovers alike. I did come into this with an open mind and tried to stay as unbiased as possible. It far exceeded my expectations. The overall balance of sweet and bitter came together just right and provided me with a texture of just pure, Belgian style beer. I will be getting this beer again as a great session brew and would totally recommend this to anyone looking to expand into the Belgian beer market. Cheers!"
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer light and refreshing with enough flavour to keep me interested."

"Nice caramel straw color. Not amber. Smells sweet, with a citrus floral element--almost like a hefeweizen. Spicy aftertaste. The sweetness coupled with the citrus element work well. It grows on you and is definitely bitter-sweet. It covers a majority of the palate --bitter, sweet, citrus, spice, etc. Decent amount of carbonation. Nice summer (warm weather) beer."
"O-a nice complex Belgian beer that I could sip for hours. Lacks some yeast on the palate, but an otherwise tasty brew."
""
""
""

"I like this style very much and enjoyed this one -- especially the aroma and the rather complex flavor profile."

"Came home from the local wine store and had three bottles of beer. This was recommended as being a great beer and I am enjoying it. Seems a bit fizzy (or is it yeasty?). Enjoyable nonetheless. With that being said I am not sure I would want to drink several of these, might be wrong though. This is definitely a beer worth having again."
""
""
""
""
"O: A fine session beer (as the label suggests). Rare Vos has an enjoyable dry malt flavor with an edge of spice that would work well with most foods. Since it is not clingy or too heavy, it is enjoyable in more than one doses."
""
"O - A nice BPA that should not go overlooked."
""
""
""
""
""

"The color when poured was reddish copper-amber, with loads of tight white foam and lace on the side of a tulip glass. Make sure you pour slowly or you'll get nothing but foam. The aroma was of yeast, spices with a fruity hint. The taste had a very pleasant carbonated bitter/sweet yeasty flavor, with spices with a very pleasant aftertaste. Nice combination of components to this fine Belgium Amber Ale. Another winner by Ommegang Brewing Co."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of moderate intensity, which somehow manages to never feel fizzy on the palate, but still completely foam up as it moves across the tongue. The result is a soft and foamy (redundant, I know) mouthfeel that closes out quite dry, with little residual stickiness. Excellent."

"O: Another incredible beer from Ommegang, fairly light, compared to other Ommegang beers that I've tried, but it's a great beer. I got it for an incredible deal, normally it would be a bit more expensive, but I would say it is worth it, its got its reputation behind it, recommended by for everyone, superb."

"O: more than credible US version of this Belgian style."

"there is a funky taste to it, but it's not over-powering and i dont hold it against the review. it's still a great brew and one i will recommend...."
"750 ML Poured into a Ommengang Rare Vos glass. A medium amber color with a white bubbly head. Head had been 2 fingers thick, before settling to a tin head with lots of side cling. Fair amount of carbonation rising from the bottom. Primary aroma was a yeasty smell, with a hint of pepper undertone. Flavor a peppery spice, with a finish of a slight hoppy kick. Felt reaonable in the mouth, a bit of kick on the tongue, with a bit of texture and chew. Overall, not bad, but the low ABV seemed to pack a more of a punch than it really did."

"Overall (4.25): There’s a reason this has been one of Ommegang’s best sellers for years. Actually, several reasons. It has a fantastic balance of depth and character for a beer its size—it kind of reminds me of what a “baby Quad” might taste like, with a farmhouse side to it—and yet it’s still very easy to drink, and has something for everyone who enjoys Belgian styles of beer. Rare Vos is a winner."

"2 finger frothy head with excellent lacing on a cloudy orange with amber and brown hues body. Dark fruit, yeast, some citrus, caramel malts. this one is really bland actually. Flavor is the mosty unidimensional with some herbal and bland barley up front moving to orange peel citrus otherwise nothing else. Light to medium body and moderate to high carbonation. I was expecting a lot from this one and it was very disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of funky yeast, caramel malt and ripe fruit. Body is medium and crisp. Funky yeast, vinous fruit, lemon zest, caramel and earthy hops fill the mouth. Finish is long, earthy and fruity. This brew grows on me with every sip."

""

""

"O: originally I gave this beer a 3.5 but now its in the high 4s. Beer has refined itself and also my pallet has probably changed as well."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very nice beer - I can see why people rave about it so much. Indeed very drinkable / sessionable as indicated on the bottle. I could polish one of these off easily over lunch with little problem, and would not mind having another one if I decided to not have a ""session"". Definitely one to get again."

"Pours turbid amber with a quilt of fine light cream foam. Smells of stoney amber malts, some herbal hops, some hints of metal and clay. Flavor is all crystal malts and belgian yeast. The yeast is sweet and dirty with a bit of apricot essence. Some biscuit in the malt with a tea flavor and some more metal. Medium on full bodied for the style with a soft, but persistent carb and a slime finish. Decent beer."

"This beer is crisp and refreshing. It would be great to have lounging outside on a spring day. I could easily put away 3 or 4 of these in one sitting."

"More than medium bodied with soft carbonation. This is somewhat creamy and finishes dry. It is unusual to find both qualities in one beer. Very nicely done."

"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Deep orange-red copper color with a big billowy, creamy head. Nose is faint orange and coriander. Taste is coriander and orange peel. More orange peel and a hint of floral on the finish, followed by coriander and clove. Nice balance. Refreshing with just right carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer that has enough complexity to maintain my interest, yet not so overdone as to demand my attention."
""
"Overall, I cant say enough good things about this very approachable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is easily one fo my favorite examples of the style. Tart, crisp, and complex. It remains fruity and light and lacks the rich bready malts I don't care for in a belgian pale ale. As a bonus it is perpetually available all over the place. This is a fantastic beer."

"I was a little concerned about how the aroma started off, but Rare Vos has come together nicely. Yet another Ommegang beer I've waited too long to try."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy amber in color with a thick and creamy off white head that doesn't appear to want to go anywhere. The smell is somewhat mild but pleasant with peppery spice, belgian yeast esters and a touch of light fruit as the main contributors. Malt aromas a muted but a mild bready character is there as well. The taste is also largely dominated by the peppery spicy character with some definitive hop bitterness and floral flavors in there as well. The base of the beer is built on a solid, somewhat sweet caramely malt which provides good balance for the rest of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is also quite nice with just the right amount of carbonation, bitterness and a dry finish that leaves just a touch of the peppery tingle. Overall this is a very good Belgian pale ale, while I feel the smell could be a bit more assertive and the the taste may be just short of great, this is still pretty good."

"A very nice offering from Ommegang. It's somewhat of a crossover Belgian/Amber - something I've been dying to try from a brewery like this. Ommegang showcases some excellent fruits and spices with just the right amount of Belgian yeast. It's a bit tart and finishes dry. The reddish orange hue is also quite nice. The uniqueness of this beer takes it to another level, for me. Very nice."
"Poured into a pint glass, decanting properly so as not to disturb the yeast sediment. Pours slightly hazy copper with a tall, soapy eggshell colored head. The head dissipates slowly. There are lots of noticeable tiny bubbles in this beer. The Belgian yeast aromas hit the nose first, delivering fruity notes of banana and apple. I can pick up some biscuit aromas from the malt. There's also a touch of citrus. The flavors follow the profile of a typical Belgian amber. The yeast brings the fruit flavor profiles from the nose like that banana, apple, and citrus. There's some mild spiciness. The malt provides a nice backbone for this beer without being too heavy. The shot of beer left at the bottom of the bottle really had some nice Belgian yeast flavor. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean. The drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer."

"Pours a clear amber with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty and easy to drink."

"O: A very good beer. This is a different take on Amber Ale. The Belgian yeast funk is at just the right amount to compliment the breadiness and the sweet caramel malt. The dried fruit flavors were also a pleasant suprise. This beer has a complex flavor profile, but all of the flavors work together to create a very pleasant beer drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D- Extremely drinkable with low alcohol, making it even easier to drink a lot. Vos tasted kind of bland to me fresh off the tap but 10 or so minutes in the flavor just came together making me smile. A good Belgian Pale Ale of which there are alot."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being towards the higher side. Overall it's a pretty good beer, but not one of my favorites from Ommegang. The crisp, sweet fruits and yeast spice dominate a little too much making it felt a little overly sweet and almost apple juice like at times. Pretty decent tasting and easy drinking overall, but I like their BPA a lot more."
""
""
""
""
"O: A true pale ale. Usually the Belgian characteristics are so dominant I can not enjoy the hops or malt backbone. At 6.5% this is great thirst quencher to start out on a hot summer day."
"Taste/mouthfeel/drinkability - Banana and apples are noticeable right away. A sweet, medium-bodied, delicious Malt profile that compliments the light Belgian yeast front. Pairs perfectly with the bacon-bit cheddar burger that sat in the Brooklyn East IPA. The light spiciness does wonders to reset the palate from the burger and the smokiness of the spicy sausage wrapped in banana peppers. This ale is light as it spritzes on the tongue with a bit of acidity. Toffee-like malt is noted in the aftertaste. The taste of Belgian yeast conquers the fruity notes as the beer warms up. The ethanol is well-balanced and completely hidden. Not nearly as dry as some other reviewers have mentioned. It leaves me satisfied with every drink."
"This is a nice offering from Ommegang. It doesn't have that overpowering Belgian funk that often accompanies this style. It has a nice flavor and is easily drinkable. It's worth a try."
""
""

"Medium bodied. Carbonation bites slightly. Slides easily over the tongue and finishes dry."

"O- I think this is a very decent beer, and is a great version of the style. Fruity, spicy, yeasty...this one has it all. The booze factor is noticeable to a degree as well. I can't honestly say it's my favorite type of beer to be drinking, but I think it's very deserving of it's rating. Would I drink this again...yes, but I'd drink this one only on occasion. I agree with the website that this would add a little something to a saucy meal such as chili!"

"Just wished I had read the label in more detail. Selected it based upon the high BA scores at the liquor store."

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a goblet. This pours a nice amber color with a large foamy white head. The smells are of belgian yeast esters, some fruit, sugar, caramel. The feel is medium with high carbonation, very tingly. The taste is pretty good, lots of brown sugar, caramel, nice and sweet."

"Pours a nice copper color with good clarity and about 1 finger of white head. Big big banana flavor a little watery but kind of full in body at the same time. Slightly flat. Some deeper malts, underlying notes of caramel. Works well with the banana and clove. Pretty unique, kind of like a Belgian amber ale. Flavors are well blended, simple yet just complex enough to stay interesting. Finishes clean, lingering subtle banana after taste. This beer could use some body work though, the flavors could definitely hold up to a touch more carbonation."

"O-Another solid brew from Ommegang, carbonation was at a good level, and it was nice to see the incorporation of amber/red ale into a belgian framework."
""
""
"O: A very drinkable beer and one that I have had many times, I think that it actually improves some with aging though my guess is that aging it much more than 5 years and it could be on the down slope. I really like this beer and it could easily be a session beer for me."
"Light to medium texture in the mouthfeel and no real notice of the alcohol. Very drinkable and a good spin on an amber ale."
""
""
""
"O- Well made but rather one dimensional. I was expecting something with a bigger and more distinctive flavor."
"O - This is a tasty Belgian ale, though leans more on the side of an amber with the hop presence coming across as more of a creeper flavour on the finish. Worth a try though."

"O: A very interesting BPA. Almost no hops, but super fruity and malty and even a little funky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark amber/copper color with a big cap of off-white foam. The tulip glass directed the yeasty aroma full of fruit and clove spices. The maltiness of the aroma transfers on to the palate. The malt is biscuit-like, almost crisp in nature. High carbonation leads the way toward a bitter and spicy finish. Dry and refreshing while still being malty with a hint of alcohol. This is pleasure to drink."
"Overall: B"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange color into Duvel tulip with good half inch head and smells of yeast and citrus. Mmmm sweet yeasty Belgian-like goodness with a bit of orangey citrusness among the yeasty floaters. Very, very good example of Belgian style brewed in the states. Great mouthfeel and great find, will enjoy this fully and keep my eyes out for more from Ommegang."

"Great flavour...mild, but just enough Belgian flavor to not be overwhelmed. A very approachable BPA, especially for a casual beer drinker looking to expand on the usual; but also appeals to the finer side of beer...good brew."

"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a classic belgian style 3 finger head that settles to a bold thick and frothy lace that slimes its way up and down the glass. Banana bread meets orange peels, meets sweet fruity spices, with a touch of hop for balance all fill the nose. Creamy orangesicle wrapped in a banana peel on the tongue. Orange and spice and vanilla and a yeasty banana tone with a lemony tart finish. Medium bodied, high carbonated, creamy smooth easy to get lost in beer. Great beer by Ommegang, Rare Vos is an absolute favorite of mine, just a truly fine BPA."
""
"Ommegang proves again that their ""Belgian-style"" isn't a joke. This is one of the best, if not the best, Belgian-style you can get without actually getting a plane ticket to Bruxelles. This is incredibly flavorful but subtle, sweet but finishes cleans, and plenty of Belgian yeasts to keep every sip interesting. Love this beer."

"one of my absolute favorite beers, especially on tap. pours a slightly cloudy carrot colored orange with a lacey white head 2 inches thick. smells just a hint sour, with belgian yeast backing it up. a nice caramel malt sweetness meandering through as well. taste is crisp, and not like a classic amber, no residual sweetness to speak of, and a fairly sharp quick refreshing finish. this is a very well made glass of beer, and one that i wish was never empty. the nice finish, medium abv, and medium to light body make this a really drinkable beer. i find new ways to appreciate it every time i have one. just fantastic!"

"Nice mouthfeel, not too harsh, but one may feel the carbonation and spiciness going down. For as much flavor as this beer contains, there is surprisingly no aftertaste at all, which saddens me just a bit... Not that I won't have another!"

"O: Not a bad beer. For some reason, the second time I've had it (about 6 mos. after the first) isn't as good. I may revisit this one eventually."
"O-a nice amber ale well-balanced good flavor"
"Overall this is a very nice drinkable Belgium ale from Ommegang."
"Overall the beer seems to vary all over but never messy or out of kilter. Quite enjoyable."
"Medium mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. VERY drinkable. I should have this again soon because writing this is making me want some. Recommended!"
"Overall: Very smooth, rich tasting. Hearty. A lot of pride went into this Sly Fox. Recommended."
"Overall I loved this beer, but I am partial to the Belgiums. I will certainly have again."
"O: Very drinkable; both flavor and balance."
"The beer pours with a very lush cream colored head that retains very well, vigorously releasing the bouquet initially. The color is amber, with the typical yeast sediment. Smell is of very pleasant fruit and spice, cloves, perhaps coriander. Tastes of very pleasant yeast and malt without undue sweetness, and with a grassy and spicy character, not overbearing. Hops bitterness is most obvious in the finish, but is also very measured and perfectly balances the malt. Though not very high in alcohol, it's taste is quite noticeable. Medium to heavy bodied mouthfeel, again, very balanced. Overall an excellent beer."
"Definitely on the funky side of Belgian pale ales, with a hefty nod to all things fruity, though the witbier treatment kind of falls flat with the weak-seeming spice and aforementioned intermixed fruitiness. I cannot tell a lie and say that this lacks flavour, but it's just not my particular thing."
"An excellent food beer. Matches well with sharp cheeses or a spicy shrimp dish. Highly recommended."
"its worth a try but a second may be a bit of a stretch at 12$ a bottle I'd buy one of Ommegang's other offerings available here in Alberta"
"Overall a very nice tasting beer, very easy to drink, not very complex but still worth a try"
"Out of bottle. Not my type of beer at all. Did not match the typical Belgian flavor beer of which I am not a big fan of anyway. For me this had a charcoal, ashtray type taste that is just not a match for my palatte. Seems some folks enjoy this, so give it a try if you'd like. I have turned the page on this one."
"D - Well balanced and very easy to drink."
"Cheers!"
"O - Fantastic beer. Loved it all around. Would definitely get it again."
"I’m a big fan."
"Fruity esters invade the nostrils. Grapes, plums, with maybe a hint of pear. Big bready malts come together with some clove and other phenols to get my mouth watering. Grainy malty sweetness hits the tastebuds first, followed by fruits, spicy phenols, and mild alcohol warmth. Virtually no hop bitterness, but this one had been cellared for just over a year. Full-bodied mouthfeel with a dry finish."
"O: Good beer, but not as great on tap. Still recommended. Drinkable. I *might* be convinced to try another on-tap."
"Overall: Fantastic all the way around! The beer is alive from the time it hits the glass. Although I stop the pour well before the head reaches the rim of the glass, it expands and begs to overflow each time. Highly recommended. I certainly won't be shying away from the 750ml version of this next time..."
"Yeah, maybe a bit too bitter and Belgian for an everyday drinker, but pretty decent."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. Been meaning to try it for a long, long time but hadn't for some reason. Glad I did. High recommend. Available here in TX. Rotation - makes the fruity/spicy rotation as the occasional bomber or six pack. Need to try on-tap as well. Great summer beer - very refreshing. [O;Y]"
"O: A good offering from my dear brothers at ommegang."
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer overall. It has a nice character that, while not totally unique or new, makes for an interesting and very appetizing brew."
"It's a good beer, but in my opinion not a great beer. It's pleasant, light, drinkable and quite sessionable for its 6.5%. The characters are pleasant enough, but it doesn't really do anything exceptional."
"O - A great find that is one of the lesser hyped Ommegang beers. Is right there with the belgian imports in my opinion."
"Oh, and ""rare vos"" is Flemish for ""sly fox."" That's got to count for something, eh?"
"overall: lots going on in the taste, nothing overly pronounced, but well-balanced."
"What an interesting, spicy amber ale. I suggest having it directly after an American amber, as I did, to note the differences. They’re striking."
"O - It's the kind of beer I'd expect from Ommegang. Not the best, but still really nice. The bottle was good, but I'd recommend on tap if you can find it."
"O - Was impressed with this at first, and almost salivated at the opportunity. The appearance and aroma both had me expecting a great offering. The taste and mouthfeel left me a bit disappointed from those initial expectations. A worthy drink still, but I wasn't overwhelmed by any aspect of the drinking itself. However, the aroma of this beer alone merits strong consideration."
"A very good brew. I think it gets even better as it warms."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a small white head. Aroma of caramel malt, some yeast, with some light fruity notes. Taste is caramel malt, yeastiness and some dark fruit undertones. Palate is nice medium body, carbonation is good. Finish is malty, yeasty, with some dark fruity plums notes, light hops and a slightly sweet spicy and nutty aftertaste. Overall a very nice easy to drink ale."
""
"Mouthfeel on the head is great, frothy and creamy. The beer is moderatley crabonated, and lighter bodied than the robust flavor suggests."
"This is an interesting cross in styles. Ommegang knows what they are doing with the making of this beer."
"o - Overall a nice amber ale with a Belgian style kick to it. Lots of dark fruits mixing with some bananas and bready malts. Very easy to drink, would give another shot."
"This pours out as a slightly cloudy amber color. The head if fluffy and tan. The lacing is pretty nice on the glass. The smell ofthe beer has a good amour of yeast and some hops on the nose. The taste ofthe beer has a soft malt sweetness with a bitter dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and remains drinkable. Overall it's a pretty good brew."
"Served in a tulip glass and the beer appeared a clear, golden amber with a big white head that was very well retained throughout the beer. Noticeable carbonation streaming to the top of the glass. The beer had a very nice aroma, sweet, spicy, floral and banana, just like a good Belgian should be. The taste is very good, complex and follows the nose nicely. Medium feel to the beer with high carbonation. The beer had a nice dry sweet and crisp finish. Overall, an excellent, highly drinkable beer and one that I will seek out to try again."
"Overall = Pretty good. I like Belgian beers but I'm a bit of a novice at comparing the various brands. So far, there are other Belgian styles that I prefer over this. Chimay blue is a favorite."
"Crisp and creamy with a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Opens sweet and malty with suggestions of banana, cloves and gingerbread spice. Peppery yeast surfaces, followed by a touch of metal. Finishes dry with a puckering note of sour cherries."
"Complex, and quite an enjoyable experience."
"Previous Ommegangs have blown me away; this one didn't and my ratings reflect the disappointment; but it is definitely worth a visit"
"D: A bit light to be categorized as a BDA, but the brewery bills it as an amber and that seems right. Lots of Belgian character, but in a balanced and rounded way. It is very approachable and drinkable. This would go great with a broad range of dishes."
"See, there is a beer with ""Rare"" in the name that doesn't get blasted by many BAs. It pours a cloudy red-orange topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises clove, orange peel, black pepper, light nutmeg, wheat, and a plenty o' bread, which seems to smother everything else after a few sniffs. The taste tones down the bread in favor of the spicier notes, and the orange really shines through a bit more here. I think I get a touch of cinnamon in the background. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate (though kinda prickly) carbonation and a finish that borders on the refreshing. Overall, a pretty nice Belgian-style brew, but I think it's one of the lower points in Ommegang's repertoire."
"O- A really delicious beer, very drinkable and refreshing."
"O: A good amber. Not overly complex but definitely worth trying."
"A champion among amber ales. Pours a clear amber with a nice white head that retains well. Nicely toasted malts in the nose, along with a medley of fruit and a bit of spice. Malty taste, with flavors of pear, banana, apricot, and light spice. Very smooth, and quite complex for an amber ale, but not over-complicated. Medium mouthfeel, finishes dry, and is very drinkable."
"O: I certainly prefer this beer on tap. Gave some to a co-worker ""Wow, we serve this here. It's like a beer smoothie."" Have had half dozen bottles over the years, must say the tap adds something extra."
"O: A solid Belgian Dark Ale. Definitely ""darker"" in body than a BPA, but similar flavors. Enough differences between the two styles to keep them both in your beer fridge."
"O/D: Looks great, feels good, smells and tastes like something's wrong. Had at The Mews, so dirty lines could have played a major role. Might have to take a shot with this beer in a bottle, can't get much worse."
"M - It seemed thin at first but after each sip i notice some residual stickiness that compliments the smooth character of this belgian dark ale."
"Overall, why did i wait so long to try this? Awesome American made Belgo amber. Brings the whole package to the party."
"Overall - such a fine tasting beer upset I only have one to taste. would love to sit back and have a few good sessions with this beer."
"O: Overall. Yum. 4.5"
"The pour was nice. Light amber in color and very cloudy. Nice little touch of white on the top as well that reached a heightof around an inch before settling back down. Light grain aroma with hints of spice and light fruits was welcoming, albeit a touch light for me. Smooth, mellow, and a bit bland on the taste. Lots fo pepper like taste tried to cover up a lack of depth and an otherwise slightly bland overall vibe. Still decent feel and a very smooth, easy drinkability."
"A ""true belgian style amber ale"" from Cooperstown, NY. Apparently, rare vos is Flemish for sly fox. Sports a distinct, foggy orange honey color that looks as refreshing as it sounds and retains a ""rocky"" head quite well. Smell is typical of quality amber ales with sweet, but mellow, notes of cloves, bread and citrus. Taste is similar to smell, accentuated by a sharp (almost overbearing) shot of carbonation. There is a lingering bitterness as well as some buried caramel accents. This does get a little sweeter as it gets warmer and overall a very decent brew."
"This is a great bear to share with your friends in summer time. The taste is so refreshing. The beautiful color and aroma of this bear are extraordinary delectable with any kind of food. The Rare vos flavor is exceptional, you can feel many sensation in one time."
"O - This is a nice belgian dark ale. Really dig this offering from Ommegang. Smell didnt really blow me away but alot of the other stuff did."
"Drink- A very good beer. I've become a big fan of Ommegang lately. Well crafted and tasty. I just got back from a run and would like to have this after all my runs."
"O: Very good beer. Looks great, aroma coming of the beer is very nice, very good flavors....definitley a high quality beer."
"Overall - This is a beautiful beer. Full of flavor. The bitterness was not unpleasant but not expected. I prefer the other Ommegang brews tot this one."
"O- Very drinkable. I wish I had the whole bottle to self. Refreshing and enjoyable. Great for ~$9."
"Overall: Decent beer, but the carbonation kind of ruins it. Aromas are good as well as the lingering flavors, but when it's on my tongue it just doesn't hold up. I would like to try this on tap or 750ml to see if it's as ""gas-y"" as in the 12oz"
"M: Soft, creamy, bubbly mouthfeel. High carbonation. Medium body."
"O: One of the lightest categorical Belgian dark ales I've ever had. The light malts and fruitiness pair really nicely with cheddar and blackened chicken. It's bright and refreshing enough on it's own as well, carrying satisfying bittersweet malts and fruity esters."
"Medium bodied with tons of carbonation release scrubbing the palate, almost too much. Nice complex flavors similar to the smell. Very drinkable and good but not incredible."
"O-This is a a highly drinkable belgian-style beer with nice fruity yeasty flavors and a great high carbonated champagne-like mouthfeel."
"Overall - I have yet to be disappointed with this brewery. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and it would work really well during the warmer weather as a refreshing beer."
"O= overall a very solid experience, the sourness might catch up with one's gut after a few. Probably good with burgers, roasted red meats, maybe bold tomato pasta, or even to counterbalance some fresh sweet fruits ie banana, mango et al."
"O- A great take on a Belgian Dark Ale, but it still aint a belgian dont fool yourself."
"Looks good and smells good. Lots of spice comes through in the nose, especially coriander. That same spice is huge in the flavor and really gives this one it's characteristic identity. I really like this beer. The feel is alright, a bit aggressive on the carbonation, I'd like it to be smoother. Overall, a good choice on a night out."
"Overall its a very solid Belgium amber ale with a nice bit of funk and more hops than I have in most Belgium ales. Very glad to find this in a 12oz cheaper version. Great brew."
"This is one of the best Belgian styles from an American brewery I have ever tasted. Ommegang is spot on with this one. This is going to be a regular in my cellar. I cant wait till it warms up as this will be a great summer session beer."
"This beer has a milky amber appearance that has the perfect amount of head when poured into a glass. It smells sweet, fruity, and malty. The taste is very smooth with a lot of flavor. I taste apple and a light sweetness which is not overpowering. The after taste is very is light with a a hint of fruit making you want more. This beer would be good for any occasion, but tastes more like a summer beer. Cheers."

"drinkability; a smooth drink, well balanced and pleasant. Drink and enjoy!"
"D: I'll reserve this one for the warmer weather when I'm looking for a brew with this much spice presence but is easy to drink and refreshing. Would probably be a great transition beer for a Blue Moon fan."
"This is a very drinkable belgian style ale and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the style."
"I'll be keeping a bottle of this one on hand."
"This was a pretty good beer though I guess that ambers and browns aren't really my favorite beers. The nose on this one was a bit weak, and somewhat boozy, though there was some nice malty tones to it. Flavor follows with a nice roasty, toasty, bready, and cracker-y malt profile. I'm not really getting the fruits that others are talking about, but there is a fair amount of yeast notes to it too. Overall, not a bad beer by Ommegang. Pretty drinkable with some pleasant flavors."
"The CPJ"
"A wonderful treat that is surprisingly even better on tap."
"http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced. seems to lay somewhere between a BPA and a BDA, borrowing traits from each."
"Very nice mouthfeel and the lightness of body in this beer invites for more, very drinkable."
"Rare Vos was amber in color and hazy. It had a nice off-white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was fruity yeast and malt aromas. The taste was fruity and well with some mild pepper and spices. The finish was dry and fruity. The mouthfeel was just above average with a thin body and medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was also above average. This is a fairly good beer, but needs more body in my opinion."
"D - I think this is so bad that it takes on comic (or tragic) proportions. Is this for real?"
"It's been a while since I've had a Belgian Amber, and this was a treat for sure."
"Overall: A decent beer, no doubt, but not one of Ommegang's best. Still, worth a try."
"D-4 good, balanced beer that isn't too heavy, though it is rich in flavor and I'd probably only want 1-2 at a time. Overall a tasty brew that I'd recommend and buy again."
"Pours a golden copper color w/ a big off white head. The head of this beer sticks around for a long time. Nice carbonation. Great lacing. This beer smells of clove, spice, and has a earthy smell to it. The taste is nice, not too heavy, not too light. Has a outdoorsy, citrusy, spicy taste to it. This would be a great summer beer. I actually would like a little more alcohol in the taste, as I don't get any. For the style, this is a good beer. Maybe not world class, but on a hot summer day I'd pick it up in a second. Glad I finally got to try this one."
"D. Great brew, good balance. I could keep this brew and usually do, in my cellar. I am glad I live so close to the brewery that I never run out."
"D/O- I'm not so sure I'd want to have more than one, maybe two, of these. Can't remember the last time I gave a ""5" for appearance. Reminded me a lot of Hennepin...guessing that's the yeast."
"Had this at a restaurant in San Francisco. Pours an amber colour with a finger of slightly off-white head. Some nice lacing around the glass. Smells quite spicy with dark fruit and Belgian yeast. Very dry flavour, the spices come through even more in the aftertaste. Nice carbonation level. Another good beer from Ommegang."
"Highly drinkable, this may be my favourite Ommegang beer that I've tried to date. A pleasant surprise, I wished I picked up a few more of these."
"Drinkability is quite good. Could easily have downed another one of these. If you're hankering for a good Belgian brew that's easy on the wallet, look no further than Ommegang. Their stuff isn't quite that Trappist quality, but it's as close as you're going to get on this side of the pond."
"Its has a nice drinkablity as well. I have seen some BA's talk this brew down, but I have enjoyed it very much. Its easy to drink, a lower ABV then many of the other brew in the style. Drinks very creamy and smooth. The flavors also come together so well that allows this brew to pair well with anything. This was a great brew from the Brewery Ommegang. I will be sure to pick up the bigger version of this brew on my next visit to the beer store."
"Pours hazy deep amber to glowing red with a creamy white head. The aroma is heavily fruity and light to medium spicy with tones of sweet yellow apples, apricots, peaches, pineapples, overripe pears, mild white pepper, coriander and light hints of fresh herbs. Malt and hops bring tones of crispy crackers, light caramel, white sugar and a touch of flowers and grass. The flavour is fruity up front with tones of citrus but there is also some notes of apples and apricots. Undertones of grassy bitter hops and toasted/cracker-like malt. The mouthfeel is soft carbonated and round. Light sweet and near medium hoppy. Bit dry. The aftertaste is earthy and grassy bitter. Medium bodied."
"This is a very easy drinker, but I really did not find it all that unique or interesting. Also, for me, the spiciness was just a bit overpowering and could have been balanced a little more by the fruitiness and a little bigger malt presence. Still, it is an enjoyable beer."
"D-its really not a fun beer to drink, i was excited for it to be done with soon after opening it. the plastic-like taste towards the finish seems to grow throughout the glass. this is definitely not something i'll ever be getting again."
"D - This is an impressive beer, much like everything from Ommegang. I am regretting passing this beer up so many times. It goes down way to easy. I wish I would have gotten more than a single."
"Like a lot of other belgians this beer tastes like a friend invites you over to their farm and let's you taste beer they've brewed right there on the farm. A warm and cozy beer that tastes good on a cold night like tonight."
"Pours reddish amber with 1/2 layer white foam. Cloudy active bubbles. Malty smell, some orange hints. Light citrus taste, very mellow. Candied sugar. Belgian yeast notes but in background. Little bubbles of carbonation create a buzz if you look for it. Good flavor, easy to drink, another solid ommegang offering."
"This is a pretty drinkable Belgian ale, but it is just not quite there for me. I love the mouthfeel and the aroma, but the taste is a bit too spicy and lacks that nice fresh orchard fruit character. It is definitely a well crafted ale, but I think there are a lot of better examples out there."
"D: Sweet, fruity, malty and spicy: just what you'd expect out of the style, and a great example of it. Not my favorite beer, but a great one none the less."
"D: didn't care for this one as much as some others"
"Looks nice, amber with a nice white head. Light lacing and above average retention. Aromas are very enjoyable, although light. A bit of sweetness, with standard belgian aromas of light barnyard (that became more pronounced over time), a bit of citrus and sourness. The beer really falls flat at this point for me. It is thin with very subdued flavours. A bit of belgian nature comes through but no real malt, although the beer does not finish dry... Decent beer, but of all their offerings, ,this is the one I would least look to redrink."
"D: Not a big fan of this one, alcohol was well hidden, taste didn't improve with warmth."
"Pours murky and orange with lots of foamy head. Smells yeasty with lots of floral hints. Tastes very yeasty and belgiany. A solid but not necessarily outstanding beer. A bit of hoppiness but nothing too crazy. A thck mouthfeel That's a bit rough from the bitterness. Overall fairly drinkable"
"Pours a hazy amber color with a full 2 finger head. Mild lacing with adequate retention. The nose on this brew is a little sweet with dark fruits and a little must. Palate is complex and tasty. A nice bready malt backbone with some spice and funk from the yeast and some sweet candied flavors. An extremely drinkable and enjoyable offering. Worth seeking out, enjoying, then seeking out again."
"M: Great mouthfeel with the perfect level of carbonation. Tha alcohol is not noticed."
"Very well balanced and while this brews flavor is pretty good, it is the lack of off flavors, tricky to control with certain Belgian strains, that makes this one a well brewed ale."
"Very drinkable- good even as session beer. Great with food. I plan to drink many more in the future"
"The price wasn't bad at all for such a high quality brew. Great stuff."
"d - i could do a bottle of this my self, would have no problem buying again"
"This beer poured a darker amber color, with a large lacing head. Smelt of spices typical of a good beligin beer. The taste was a bit heavy, lots of spices were present, a bit malty also. A very full flavor, but nothing that made it very difficult to drink: everyone could enjoy it. Overall I found this beer VERY enjoyable."
"i MUST race their next year's cyclocross race..."
"Easy drinking and enjoyable. An easy to drink style overall."
"D - More of a sipper than quaffable for me but quite enjoyable."
"the color is amber as the name implies with a tan head. heavily carbonated and bubbly. mostly transparent although slightly cloudy. the smell is of light belgian yeast and some fruity sweetness. taste is of the yeast and is sweet. like a lighter tripel. the beer is light and refreshing and is a nice change of pace for a Belgian. Very good."
"D-good, these are sold in both 4 packs and bombers and you can enjoy it in either capacity"
"Beer poured a caramel color with a large frothy head. Aroma was coriander, orange peel, grains of paradise, with honey-like malts and caramel. Taste was very sturdy. This brew will not be overwhelmed by typical bar foods. Sweetness was moderate with a pleasant balanced spiciness. Grainy. Mouthfeel was thick at first, but mellows quickly and dissipates on the palate. Overall an excellent beer. Substantial."
"Same goes with the bottle. Perhaps not as enjoyable as it was on draft but a good beer."
"Slightly hazy amber color with one finger of head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of Belgian yeast, candied sugar, and some fruit like pears and plums. Good complex flavor as well. Pale malt, candied sugar, spicey yeast, and a slight vinous quality. Somewhat dry finish. No hint of alcohol. Medium body but the carbonation is a little bit lackluster. A decent texture is salvageble. Very enjoyable beer from Ommegang."
"The flavor is quite nice with a big dose of pear, yeast, and some light banana. There is a very, very small amount of white pepper in the background. I also get a hint of stone fruit. The feel is somewhat light with good carbonation and a bit of creaminess. This drinks quite well and is one of the better Ommegang brews that I've had."
"Pretty solid beer overall. Nothing spectacular, but a great way to round off a solid thanksgiving dinner."
"Rare Vos pours a cloudy amber color with a huge 3 finger head. It took two pours to fit in the pint glass despite a mild pour. Wow the aroma! Often I have to put my nose close to smell the beer, but I could smell the aroma of spice, hops, fruit and yeast as I poured. I paired Rare Vos with Thanksgiving dinner (Thank you Beer Advocate). This was THE PERFECT beer to go with the heavy starches, poultry and gravy. The fruit, spice, hops and yeast balanced out the heavy meal. Every sip was pure heaven. It has a medium body with medium carbonation. This beer is highly drinkable with a low abv. My only regret is that I had only 1 bottle to go with dinner."
"Rare Vos always been one of my favorite Belgian Style beers. It gives up some of the weight and depth of its counterparts, but renders itself more drinkable and still keeps your palette watering for more. This beer does a great job of filling the gap between Witte and Hennepin..."
"This is a very good beer and worth buying."
"D: Love to drink this beer, great medium body makes this a good one to drink by itself. Really love the deep fruit notes, makes this a wonderful beer to admire and enjoy."
"D - Drinkability is high. Moderately low ABV combined with a complex and flavorful taste profile keeps this one in my hand often. Just a slight hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Drinks quickly and beautifully!"
"D - Very easy to drink. The bottle was gone far too quickly. All around very soldi beer."
"D - Very smooth beer and fairly easy to drink. The tastes are present and well balanced overall."
"I'm a big fan of Ommegang, but this beer left me somewhat disappointed."
"Pours a hazy orange with a beautiful glow to it and a relatively thin white head. Slightly tart nose, but fruity with pear, a touch of lemon, a light dusting of clove, and a bit of breadiness. Pleasant. The taste is even better. Beautifully balanced with nice spicebox and fruit notes balanced by some yeasty breadiness and a touch of caramel. More pear and clove, but everything is rather restrained rather than in your face. Subtlety can be a good think. The finish is harmonious union of the pear, caramel, and clove- without being very sweet. Slightly on the carbonated side, but with a creamy, soft fizz to it. Very nice with a cheese plate, and quite drinkable. Lovely."
"The overall color of Rare Vos is a slightly muted orange heading in the direction of amber. The wheat content of the beer makes it cloudy as is typically seen with other wheat beers but seems to be even cloudier than most. The smell hold citrus notes which helps the beer achieve a higher level of drinkablilty because it is not too strong of a wheat taste. When poured out of the bottle it produces a nice fluffy head which beatifully compliments the color of the brew. This is my personal favorite of the original ommegang beers and is a must try in my book for anyone seeking a quality beer."
"I like this beer, but I find it lacking in most respects. I don' know; maybe I just can't appreciate it for itself, outside the shadow of Ommegang's Abbey Ale."
"D - I could drink a few of these, but its not my preferred style."
"D: This was a very good beer but I was not entirely blown away by it. That being said I most certainly enjoyed it and would not hesitate to try it again"
"Tasty, however not exactly my fav genre for either belgians or beer in general. definitely quality brew. doesn't even taste like 6.5%."
"Overall, very drinkable. Not great, but worth a try."
"Moderately high carbonation and a dry, light mouthfeel without being thin. Some tartness up front that borders on sour, leading to banana and sweet caramel. Long, dry, peppery finish. Pleasantly balanced and very easy-drinking."
"D: Very good"
"Medium to medium light bodied mouthfeel after the initial carbonation passes. Very heavily slanted toward the malty side without assertive hops. Somehow, even by decanting and not pouring the sediment, this reminds me a bit of a hefeweizen but amber with a touch of spiciness and raisins/dark dried fruit. Quite good, a little surprising to me for some reason."
"Will have to come back to this from time to time."
"D- I greatly enjoyed this beer. That being said, by Ommegang's standards it's a bit of a let down. I'd recommend this beer but at the price point it's at, I might direct them to some of Ommegang's other offerings. Quite drinkable though, with little notice of alcohol."
"Hazy amber pour with a moderate creamy head. Really yeasty flavor, banana, bread, kind of bitter. Faint tropical fruit sweetness. Kind of too burdensome and sweet to be a session beer, but a bit simple to be considered anything special. Not bad, fine."
"Highly drinkable with a medium body...it is a nice steady drinker...I will be coming back to this one again."
"not quite overly offensive, but almost. vegetables, metal, and white bread are not the quite what I look for in a belgian dark ale or any beer, really. I have been unimpressed with Ommegang and Rare Vos is no different. I remember not enjoying it a while ago, but I was hoping that my palate just wasnt ready for it yet. Maybe after a couple more years I'll appreciate this brew. maybe."
"A great beer overall. I will definitely come back to it."
"Of the beers from Ommegang, this is the least exciting. That doesn't mean it isn't good, though. It's a very drinkable, albeit somewhat basic brew."
"This is a spectacular beer. It's simple and drinkable on the surface with oodles of complexity below the surface."
"d- really nice, this is a solid amber belgian, i would pick up a bottle of this again for sure. it's nice to split over dinner, or share with friends."
"Despite a damaged cork, Ommegang impresses with the Sly Fox. I forget how much I like these guys until I drink their beers."
"Drinkability: Another extremely solid and tasty Belgian from Ommegang. Not sure how this is the first time I've having a bottle, but alas. I'm hoping to visit their brewery soon, since I'm not too far away. QPR here's great too, as you can usually find this for around $6 or $7, if not cheaper."
"pours a hazy orange /copper color with a staying 1-2 finger head it looks great..smell is fruit , spice yeast, and malt..taste is a mix of dark fruit taste with some lighter fruits also it sweet with spice and yeast and malt in the background some pepper and nuts balance it all..mouth feel is medium + with alot of sweet fruit and malts its drinkable and very recommended"
"The only thing at all holding the drinkability down are that metallic ring, and a faintly harsh prickly alcohol bite. My suspicion is a super-fresh bottle of this would be rid of that, and thus several notches higher. I'll keep my eyes open for a newer bottle and hope to adjust later; even as is, still quite a tasty beer."
"Nice balance of toasted and nutty malt, bready yeast and herbal hops. Body is airy but substantial. ABV is nicely restrained and keeps this a refreshing beer. Some clove-like yeast spiciness comes out as it warms and adds another layer to the beer. Not as sweet as it smells, which is nice and is very drinkable and smooth despite the prickly carbonation. This is easily the best Belgian Amber I have ever had. Too bad it is too pricey to make it an everyday, mellow drinker. Solid beer, so damn easy to polish off a 750 by myself."
"D: Very true to the style, but almost disappointed because I expected something more. Very drinkable like a standard craft beer. Wouldn't go out of my way to buy this again, but great to introduce to those that are familiar with the style."
"D- Not very drinkable, but not terrible. Perhaps after the Abbey Ale (not had on the same night) my expectations were too high."
"Slightly hazy, bright copper color--brighter than expected for a dark ale, but looks like a refreshing summer brew that'll be perfect for ending a hot & humid day in Brooklyn. Brilliant citrus & pulpy fruit tones, with a slight hint of bitter hops rounding out the nose. Sweet, citrus, grainy malt flavors, vanilla(?). Great carbonation, moderate body rolls and lingers slightly sweet. A delicious, moderate-bodied summer brew that riffs on the style, adding something uniquely refreshing."
"This is a very smooth and approachable Belgian style beer. The color and taste were both a little lighter than I was expecting, but it produced an enjoyable beer that goes down easy. The taste is light and somewhat subdued. It finishes slightly sweet, but unfortunately leaves me wanting more."
"jd"
"Higher carbo, and well rounded Belgian amber."
"It is possible that this particular specimen is past its prime. The date is missing from the bottle and I doubt this circulates quickly at Price Chopper. The skunky nose is a bit of a red flag. *shrug*"
"Pours a clear amber color with active carbonation, minimal head and little lacing. Scent is of sweet carmel malts, hints of nuts, apple and banana whiffs with a touch of spice. Taste is mostly the sweet carmel malts with touches of toffee, some fruit flavors present include the apple, banana, touch of cherry, a touch of white bread and only a kiss of peppery spice. Slightly muddled tasting. Lighter side of medium bodied, slight lingering sweetness. A slightly complex beer that comes across as muddled instead of flavroful."
"Clear amber with a fluffy, beige cap. Good head retention with clumpy, sticky lace. Aromas of cloves, malt, marshmallow, pears, white pepper. Nice and spicy without going overboard. Malty sweetness to start, low bitterness, a little bready. Orange zest and pear followed, with a clove and peppery finish balanced with some sugary sweetness. Quick finish with just a bit of lingering spice and oranges. Off-dry with high carbonation, medium bodied, mild warmth, decent texture. Quite good. I liked the combination of spice and malt with a little fruitiness. This made for an interesting complexity without it becoming too muddled or heavy."
"Expect a good balance between smooth sweet taste and an underlying hint of something surprising."
"D- A touch above a session ale. I think even if the ABV were low it still would be far from sessionable. Its a bit rich and sweet for that."
"Will I be drinking this ever again? I doubt it. There just isn't enough going on for me to get past that Amber Ale flavor profile that so doesn't excite me. This is a solid beer though and you may love it. It is cheap enough that it is worth a try."
"Overall - A good take on a Belgian beer."
"Buy Again? No."
"Pours a very nice looking murky amber with very frothy beige head. Aroma of some light citrus, dark fruit, hints of licorice, faint leather, notes of Belgian candy sugar. Flavor is very much the same with small notes of caramel, some spiciness. Mouth feel is medium body with fizzy carbonation. Overall, a very nice, enjoyable beer."
"D: I would normally open a 750ml bottle only if I were sharing with a friend or two. This time, however, I'm glad I opened this bottle of Rare Vos for myself. I've enjoyed everything I've tried from Brewery Ommegang and Rare Vos has proved to be no different in that regard. I'll share the next bottle...."
"Good!!"
"Probably tied for my least favorite Ommagang Beer(along with the Witte). I don't think it deserves the big bottle treatment or the pricetag, as it's just an everyday so-so amber in a flooded market. Though even then, it seems it gets a decent score from me."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is also medium. This beer is more like a Belgium Pale Ale, instead of a Dark Ale. I am going to rate it based on the Pale ale side/amber ale. It is a good beer overall."
"The mouthfeel is exceptional. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this beer. It's up there with Hennepin in my opinion. This will probably be found in my fridge more frequently."
"Mouthfeel is nice. High carbonation swells foam up in the mouth in a luxurious way. Otherwise, the body of the beer is nice, thin while cold but it thickens as it warms to a nice smooth texture. Nice beer."
"Sampled from the tall bottle on June 1, 2010. The pour is a murky amber color with about two inches of off-white fluffy head that lingers for quite a while before settling down. The aroma is an inviting spiced malt and yeast with the bottle-fermented exuberance you come to expect from a Belgian style abbey ale. The smooth and creamy mouthfeel leads to a mellow but slightly bitter flavor with a soft note of spiced hoppiness at the end. Ommegang does an excellen job emulating the style and this is just as good as if not better than an import."
"Drinkability: Quite high -- everything about this beer is really solid and like I said earlier, it's very refreshing and will likely become something of a rotating selection in my fridge during the warmer months. It also doesn't hurt that the 6.5% ABV isn't outrageous and can quaffed over time and not be too harsh."
"Notes: It´s not bad but it sure is one of the most uninspiring offerings from Ommegang. Generic and very short of any personality or roundness to make it noticeable."
"pours a slightly hazy copper orange color. large white fluffy head and good lacing. lively fizzy carbonation. smell is a bit fruity taste is the same with some spices thrown in there as well. medium body. sweet slightly chalky finish. short flavor duration. completely average brew."
"Overall a pleasant version of the style."
"I had this beer at Taco Mac on tap. Wow an excellent brew. It had a perfect amber color with a smell of fresh hops and a slight sweet smell of malts. The taste was great man I was like this beer is actually worth $7 especially with the chalice. Thanks again Taco Mac. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp and the same time which made for a wonderful drinkability. Man I would highly recommend trying this beer. I loved it though I have not yet searched for it in the store."
"Easy enough to drink and, as others have noted, won't knock you back for a Belgian with the low abv."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a hazy orange color with a large head that quickly settles into a fairly thick collar. Lively & active carbonation. Aroma is of citrus peel (orange, lemon, some grapefruit) and spice (coriander?) 1st sip brings a sharp bite of lemon/orange peel bitterness with a note of spice as well. There is a slight sweetness. Mouthfeel is light but not watery, and lively from the carbonation. Overall, this is one very good beer! I plan to have plenty on hand during the hot summer days to come!"
"D: A nice mellow belgian amber ale. not too spicy or intense. A nice session type belgian that won't knock you out half way through."
"It's reasonably smooth and very drinkable. It's not necessarily something I would sit and drink by itself, but I think it would pair well with food."
"Comes out of the tap a pretty clear amber with a fine off-white head. I did not get much, but this was doubtless a product of how it was poured. Sweetish aroma is malty and strong and has a subtle butterscotch undertone. Mouth-filling flavor is yeasty and malty and has a fruity undertone with a hint of butterscotch and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is tingly, fizzy and lively."
"D: Better than anticipated and nearly spectacular. Would pair nicely with dinner and dessert alike. Or have it with an appetizer. This one would compliment any portion of a meal, or be completely satisfying by itself. Very well crafted."
"A tasty beer that could work as a session brew or a dinner pairing."
"Very drinkable, little hint of alcohol. This one is a winner, looking forward to trying the rest Ommegang has to offer."
"D - Quite refreshing but certainly still feels like a solid Belgian beer. All the flavors blend quite well and make it decently drinkable. Could definitely drink a couple of these but not much more."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber, big fluffy light tan head. A ton of cloves in the aroma, with as much orange rind presence. Very reminiscent of a witbier.. A potpourri of herbal flavors and spices are balanced very well by a smooth, citrusy sweet malt base with more than a bit of heat after the sip. Buttery and bitter on the finish, and sufficiently carbonated all the while. Drinkability is high. Just an excellent, excellent beer."
"Drinkability - A carefully-crafted beer with a great balance between fruitiness, earthiness, and spice. An all around delicious Ommegang offering. They never disappoint."
"D: This is a very versatile beer; it could be paired with food or just sipped by itself."
"Poured from a 750 ml caged and corked bottle. About three inches of bubbley head. Strong dark fruits and yeast scents. Dark amber color. Plum, prune fruits upfront. Strong yeast, biscuit like notes. The taste finishes a little dry. Mouthfeel is pretty light for the flavor. Very drinkable I won't have much problem finishing the bottle myself. Going well with some slices of aged provolone."
"It is an easy quaffer, very much like an unfiltered PALM. It is a good brew."
"D- A very well made beer. Drinks nicely, but is a bit of a sipper for the ABV. Definitely worth having."
"Top fermented. This is a sublime Belgian Dark Ale, really quite different from others I've tried. Well balanced and flavorful."
"This is a very rustic Belgian ale, almost like a saison, and a well-balanced beer."
"D - I really enjoyed this one, wish I had more than one."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable indeed. I would call the flavor very good, though not outstanding, but as a complete package it is a tasty treat."
"Poured from a 750ml cork and cage bottle into a stem tulip results in the expected frothy white head that subsides after a while to leave plenty of residue on the inside of the glass. Strong Belgian yeast aroma with more than a hint of barley sugar and a touch of hops. Taste is slightly tangy, sweet, very nice. Strong mouthfeel. I'll be buying this one again for sure. Wouldn't mind ageing one for a year for comparison."
"D) A nice Belgian amber. I'd have another."
"Lots of carbonation in the mouth, sweet but muted. Beer is medium in body, carbaontion makes the body seem bigger. There is a roasty / sugary / caramel flavor in there. No aftertaste or real bitterness. Overall its pretty good."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a medium tan head. Smell is of Belgian yeast strain. Taste is dry and crisp sweetness up front, with a slightly tart and tangy middle, and a estery yeasty finish. Surprising amount of bitterness for a Belgian Ale. Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly high carbonation from bottle conditioning. Very good beer, just short of an A-, I would get this again though."
"Medium bodied and slightly warming with a lingering aftertaste of wheat and malt. A solid offering but not as good overall as the other Ommegang products I've enjoyed in the past."
"D - pleasant, moderately complex, but not too strong. Very drinkable."
"D - As I get further down the glass something in the flavor seems to be making it a bit tougher to drink. Not quite sure what it is. Still pretty refreshing, but I think maybe a bit to sweet once the glass starts going down."
"Drinkability: very easy to quaff this beer. This is a beer you can drink all day long."
"M/D: dry with light carbonation. Needs a little more sweet/smooth for me, but this beer goes down easy."
"The drinkability on the beer is scary! I found myself about halfway through a 750 in about 20 minutes, and I'm generally of the sipping over a long period type of drinker."
"Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. A great combination of fruits and spices that makes for a nice light Belgian style ale. Nothing overwhelming, making this one a very easy drinker."
"Finish is very dry, almost watery and a bit soapy."
"D - All around good beer, easily drinkable and pleasant."
"Overall a very nicely done Belgian Dark from Brewery Ommegang. Pretty damn drinkable, too, especially if you like sweet Belgian beers. I wouldn't have more than two in a night just because of the sweetness, but this is good stuff. I'll get it again."
"I was very impressed by this beer. I had just stopped into the cafe to try Duvel Green, but ended up liking the house beer more. Great beer for relaxing at a bar."
"This is a very well crafted balanced brew. Drinks very easy. A top notch brew from Ommegang - yet again."
"As you can probably tell, I greatly enjoyed Rare Vos. I can tell you there will always be a full bottle in my cellar from now on. It's only sour note is aroma."
"m&d: smooth mouthfeel, drinkability is expectional. I've had a few pints of these at a bar in Cooperstown with my girlfriend, and decided it was one of the most sessionable Belgian-style ales in existence"
"It is a good brew easy to drink flavorful and it goes down smooth. I would buy it again without hesitation"
"D: Rare Vos seems to be a tweener; it could be a session brew, but it does boast an above average ABV at 6.5%. Not to mention, a complex beer is meant to be enjoyed, not drank to the point where the palate (and everything else) is numb."
"This beer was particularly good for a Belgian Dark Ale at a very reasonable price I must say. At 6.5% ABV, the pour on this one was an excellent spectacle with a very frothy head and a medium amber-bodied finish. This ale has kind of a tartness to it, but far from overbearing, and a good compliment to it's natural fruity tones. Despite being a somewhat bitter beer (which follows the trend of most ales), it is quite fruity and the mouthfeel is superb. Most importantly, the taste for the Rare Vos is decidedly above average for a strong amber ale."
"D- easy to drink and much different than i was expecting. a rather unique beer that i would like to see more like. and its sessionable to boot. check this one out if you havnt already."
"D: I really enjoyed this one. One of Ommegang's better offerings IMO. A great rendition of the style."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is pretty weak for the style, thin but little carbonation. Drinkability is extremely high, I've never had a beer of this style that's more drinkable."
"I've had most of the offerings from Ommegang and their beer has lead me to really dig in and begin my quest in beer appreciation so I can't really say enough good things about their family of beers and this beer is no exception."
"I felt this beer to have a bit of an identity crisis not discerning itself as a dark Belgian ale or an amber ale. The citrus flavors would have been better supported by a stronger backbone of malt character. Not a bad brew, but lacking in some key areas."
"All in all, a very good imitation of a Belgian Dark, but it is a noticeable step down from the genuine article, in my opinion. Still a very good brew, though."
"D- At 6.5%, this belgian, like they are intended to be, is very drinkable. The carbonation helps, but the esters may be too much after a few."
"D - Refreshing and delicious"
"Drinkability/Overall: I had no problem finishing the entire 750ml bottle. Most of my friends aren't in love with this beer, but I actually find it my favorite of Ommegang's easy to find stuff. It always has a place in my fridge for semi-special occasions (like Tuesdays)."
"This is a good alternative beer for a hot summer's day. I am drinking this in December and finding that I want more flavor and substance at the moment."
"D:Very drinkable, especially for a Belgian. Belgian-styled brews are not one of my favorites, though I appreciate the craftmanship that goes into making them. Cosequently, I usually would only drink one of them, but I could see myself putting back 2+ of this one"
"Impression: Not the best of their lot, but a good starting point for someone to get interested in Belgian-style ales."
"Carbonation is high. It is easy drinking and delicious."
"D: The price is right on this one and it's definitely worthy. Not my favorite Belgian Amber, but not my least favorite, either. This would be a great companion with an assortment of dishes, or good sheep or goat cheese (like that great Dutch Legendairy Goat Gouday). If it goes up in price anytime soon it probably won't be worth it for me, but for now this is a good go-to Belgian-style Amber from this side of the pond."
"A huge tan head bellows forth boldly off a medium pour, rising to a good three-fingers, then tapering off slowly, leaving a borken, chunky lace behind. Brew color is amber with some jagged orange hues where the light hits. Big sweet malts and light fruits (grapefruit, grape, orange) float pleasantly to the nose. A little candy sweetness lingers underneath among some slight phenolic activity. Tastes fruity and spicy up front with a bitterness that works in almost perfectly toward the end. A bit of tartness is noticed as well as some taffy. Disparate characteristics blended well to push the taste upwards to perfect, but not quite, as the finish becomes a bit weak. Mouth-feel lies on the full side of medium, and this one goes down a bit dry, with a modicum of alcohol heat touching the back of the throat. Not anything like most ""American"" ambers, but better."
"Aroma is spicey, fruity, Belgian yeast, and orange coriander. Taste parallels aroma with fruity, spicey phenols and great toast malt compliment. Effervescent carbonation adds to the impression of a very delicate beer."
"D: A very drinkable beer. I will not have a problem finishing off the bottle, and at 6.5 percent I could easily open another one (if only I had bought an extra!)"
"A solid American/Belgian offering."
"F: Very clean but very lingering light sweetness. A little syrupy. Crisp finish, almost like a good lager or bright amber ale."
"Drinkability: A nice intro beer to this style. I would have this again but am glad I got a smaller single as opposed to a bomber. Decent, not outstanding."
"This is interesting, but not for me. Something that is worth a try, but I am not really that into this."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It's flavor profile reminded me a bit of a dunkelweiss, even though this isn't one. The spicy clove and penetrating carbonation are what did it. Overall, I'm really glad I finally picked this up."
"The smell is fantastic, mouthfeel is great. Super smooth. This beer is so ridiculously smooth and flavorful that it really is a glorious representation of the style. If you like Hopback (Troegs), you will love this. It doesn't have the hoppiness of the Troegs, but has so much character anyway. You need this...seriously."
"D- Really nice take on this style."
"Drinkability is good. An easy going Belgian that does the right things well and holds back on the right things just as well. Nicely crafted. Cheers!"
"Drinkability- Excellent, will drink it again"
"....just had my first one. Freakin' awesome. Don't know how to put it any other way. Great amber color, nice body, pours with a great head, no aftertaste. Perfect amount of sweetness and balance. Got a 4 pack for about $9, not too bad, considering the overall quality of this beer."
"I could easily knock back 2 or 3 bottles of this in an afternoon and possibly come back for a 4th (if still able to stand)..."
"D - A superb saison, Rare Vos is definitely an excellent representation of the style. I'm realy surprised it took me so long to try this."
"D-An easy-drinking amber ale with a nice touch of Belgian influence and flavor. This is easy and smooth enough that it could be a good gateway beer into Belgian-style flavors."
"Please give this a try...and enjoy it slowly."
"Pours a clowdy amber with thick 2 finger head. Big bubbles fade quickly to a lacey half finger of off white head. Fruity aroma with yeast present. Taste is filled with yeast, nearly bread like but has a fruit character akin to apples. Smells also of apples and spice as well. Light mouthfeel and mildly warming sweet finish."
"Overall, a very balanced and drinkable Belgian-style ale. Very versatile for pairing with foods and great for any season."
"Drinkability: This is outstanding. To my tastes this highly drinkable beer is meant for sipping and relaxing but I can also see that it should go well with dinner or even to follow dinner as a dessert treat. This is definitely a beer to have more than one of both tonight and in the future."
"D: I am a big fan of this brew. To me, it seems like a less horse blanket version of Hennepin. Refreshing and drinkable."
"Taste is somewhat sweet and a bit malty. Nice and sharp with a bit of hoppiness and some good thick flavors, overall pretty decent but not one of my favorites from Ommegang."
"Beer pours a light orange/amber color with a thick fizzy two finger head that quickly dies down to a small blanket on top of the beer. No lacing is left on my glass as I drink the beer. This one is appetizing looking but doesn't have the lacing or head the style calls for. Smells of belgian yeast, belgian spices, malts and a bit of alcohol and maybe some citrus. I find the smell kind of weak and a bit overpowered by the yeast, it does however adhere to it's style. Taste is very similar to the smell but I feel like there is a better balance, belgian yeast and spices with some malts and citrus, not much hop presence if any. Mouthfeel is a nice creamy and medium body, has a lot of carbonation (a tiny bit too much for my liking), alcohol warming was not bad at first but took over toward the end of the beer and a nice thick coating on the mouth. All in all this beer is pretty drinkable, it has a great taste but the alcohol and spicyness might take over after a few, the price was not that bad either. I feel like this is a great example of a Belgian Dark Ale's taste but the weak smell and appearance keep it from being a great overall Belgian Dark, I would probably buy this one again as a solid Belgian Dark."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, not too heavy, its sweet and complex; it's a good sit down beer"
"D- A really effective brew with the perfect combination of complexity and smooth drinkability."
"Pleasant notes of clove, bananas and caramel just round out this ale making it smooth and enjoyable. Whether you're coming in from a day of carving up the slopes or in the backyard grilling some steaks for dinner, a Rare Vos is a great addition your day."
"Drinkability: A decent all-purpose belgian that would go great with a meaty meal or just a session."
"I have not been disappointed by any offering from this brewery, and the Rare VOS keeps their record intact. Amber, somewhat cloudy pour, generous head that falls to a ring around the glass. Rich, spicy, complex aroma with honey, clove, and yeast. Taste is a little bit dubbel, a little bit saison, a good balance of yeast and malt with just a enough lingering tang to keep one thinking. Honey, citrus, and spice overtones. Hops bitterness is present but in the background. A very nice addition to the Ommegang spectrum, and one that I will certainly purchase again."
"Drinkability: A fantastic and refreshing Belgian style beer. A darker beer with fruitiness and spice and all for the right price. I just wish the aroma was a bit stronger."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a mild yeasty aroma. Taste of spices and yeast, good flavored. Feels creamy in the mouth. Goes down very easily, I could enjoy these all evening. Overall this beer makes a fine choice."
"Poured a slightly dark amber with a fluffy foamy light tan head out of a 750ml bottle. I've greatly enjoyed and been very impressed with all the other Ommegang beers I've tried, but found this one to be a disapointment. Smell was of faint clove, apple, and banana. Taste was similiar minus the apple. After everything I've had from Ommegang, I'd probably attribute my displeasure in the style of beer rather than their take on it. I've just not had an amber ale I've much cared for."
"I would be happy to have a Rare Vos at anytime, but on the other hand there is not much to distinguish this from other quality Belgian ales."
"a highly drinkable brew its fresh tasting,smooth balanced full of spice, mild fruit flavors and complex aromas .well done . cheers"
"Pours a a translucent and hazy orange-brown color with a nice fat, frothy foam head that consistently stays and lines the glass very nicely. There's constant bubbling action radiating from the bottom of the glass and rising towards the top. The aroma is very limiting, in my opinion. I can only find the typical Belgian yeast strain odor and some hints of fruitiness - nothing more. The taste however, is completely the opposite. At first taste, you're hit with a subtle spiciness and orange/citrus lingering, topped off by the breadiness of the yeast and the warmth of the alcohol. The mouthfeel is very crisp and light. The bitterness from the hops lines the inners of your cheeks and along the top surface of the tongue - very nice. The drinkability is decently high. Easily sharable with a friend or two."
"Drinks very well, great smoothness through the spices and yeasts."
"Notes - another great one from ommegang, super drinkable, not overly intense yet very complex!"
"Rare Vos is a good, all-purpose beer. I'll finish the rest of this 22 ounce bomber with a dinner suitable for a sly fox."
"Medium light body with fair carbonation. You know you've got something going on, but it doesn't get in the way of how you drink it. This went down very well -- a very easy drinker if you are into the style. 6.5% might surprise you, but you don't sense the alcohol at all. Worth trying."
"CHEERS!"
"D: Pretty good brew that hides the alc. content well. Very drinkable."
"D - Save for 6 oz, I had the whole 750 ml. It was pretty easy to drink towards the top and just became less so towards the end. The yeast sediment began to increase (naturally) and it became more and more citrusy."
"This may not be the most complex Belgian you can find, but its relative simplicity makes it an important part of the Ommegang lineup. If someone was not very familiar with Belgians, I would certainly start them with this and not Abbey Ale or Three Phils."
"this beer pours out a caramel amber color. it has a nice white head that lasted. malty nose mixed with cherry and clove. wow, hard to figure out, very complex. taste is nice and malty mixed with sour notes, sweet notes?, and clove. great balance and quite complex. mouthfeel was nice and smooth, not real bitter at all. has a similar texture as Fuller ESB. I'll need more to really figure this one out, would buy again"
"Taste is pretty light and refreshing. It is somewhat sweet but there's a decent amount of hops and bitterness there as well. A fair amount of spiciness. Not strong at all, this is one of the more ""sessionable"" Belgian-style beers I've had. To me, it is a lighter and more drinkable version of the heavy hitting Trappist styles. Worth trying."
"Prost!"
"Pours a hazy dark amber. Nice foamy head that quickly dies down to a small thin line. Aroma of malt and cloves. Taste is of cloves and spice but very tame. I was expecting a lot more from Ommegang. It just didn't jump out at me with any significant taste or flavors. Also it seems a bit watery. Its certainly very drinkible, but not the best I've had."
"Mellow fruit and malt w balanced hop bitterness. Medium body w a clean finish. Overall a very refreshing ale. Some mild spice isn't overpowering."
"Hazy orange complextion with solid, white head and decent carbonation. Citrus, sourdough and pale malts (this is not a Belgian Dark Ale, by the way, but a Belgian Pale Ale at best). Slight hops and touch of cedar wood and caramel. Finish is silky and spicy, with ever-present hop structure. Finish is a tingly on the nose and a tad watery. A bit tough to drink just on the finish, but the beer is very enjoyable and a great value."
"This is quite easily one of the most complex and interesting beers under 7% I've ever had. Very enjoyable from start to finish."
"Outstanding!"
"Poured with an excellent, burnt brown-colored head. Dark amber color with patchy lacing on the sides. Aromas are wicked, wicked rich in citrus, grains, hints of toffee maybe even caramel. I liked the slight sense of burnt sweetness to the drink too. Taste has a great, great sweetness to it that mixes oranges, lemons, biscuity grains, honey and even syrup. Carbonation is so well balanced that it makes the drink very refreshing but smooth at the same time. Complemented with the flavor and the aromas, this is one gosh darn awesome drink. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Another great example of a Belgian Ale from Ommegang. Many earthy flavors and tons of complex tastes. Not sure it should be labeled a dark, though."
"This is not a belgian dark ale,. Its a belgian pale. That said, its decent. Clove and cooked apples on the nose, banna on the pallate, huge amounts of bannana, with clove on the back end. Decent beer, but not great. I probaly won't be haveing it again."
"This stuff is so relatively cheap, its definitely worth a try-- I think mine was 5 or 6 bucks."
"Poured from the bottle to a hazy orange with good carbonation and a thin head that dissipated quickly top slight lacing. Nose was a nice blend of citrus fruit, spices, bread dough and wheat. Mouth was tingly and slightly hoppy, and the taste picked up the lead of the nose. The only drawback was a slight watery finish, but not enough to ruin my enjoyment of this beer."
"D. A drikable beer. Pretty straightforward with not much complexity. Probably a little more dry than I prefer. Overall not my favorite from Brewery Ommegang."
"D - Hell yeah. This beer is great for relaxing, almost would consider it a session ale if the abv weren't so high. It's very crisp and refreshing, with lots of good flavors, that don't come at you too strongly."
"This is simply a fantastic brew and one I'm thrilled to have been able to try since I can't get much Ommegang here."
"Overall, I have to be honest. I almost didn't want to buy this because of the alcohol content of only 6.5%, but since it was cheap (5.00) i couldn't pass it up. I'm glad I did because this will not be the last time I buy this beer."
"I could drink this all the time, very impressive. I have come to expect nothing less from this wonderful brewery."
"Just enough flavor to not disappoint me, but I was hoping for something much more unique. This is a great brewery and I've never been disappointed by their beer, but this one didn't meet my expectations. It's medium bodied verging on light and has some fruit flavors almost like an apple, a dry apple. Not very sweet at all. Good amount of carbonation. It is really smooth and drinkable and could be a great session beer. I like this beer, I was just hoping it would be even better."
"D= Solid Belgian amber ale here. Nothing too extraordinary, but nothing to bitch about either."
"I do like this beer very much, but I think I like a couple other offerings from Ommegang a bit more... 3 Philosophers and Hennepin."
"Ommegang rightfully advertises their beers' ability to pair amazingly with foods. Indeed they do, I haven't had a Thanksgiving or Easter in years without one of their products at the table. But those big 750ml bottles also make nice treats unto themselves. I'll tell you from experience they suit a good book, a breezy spring night by candles, or the company of good friends just as well as any dish you can think of."
"Very tastey and easy to drink. I wasn't eating anything with this beer, but I suspect it would pair well with quite a bit of different foods."
"The carbonation is just right, many Belgians are over carbonated, and tend to taste sharper than they should. The alcohol is masked so well that 6.5% is mind blowing for how light and refreshing the beer truly is. I must say this is was a great pickup on my part and I will buy again."
"overall medium-bodied, simple and complex at the same time, easy to drink, a nice session ale"
"It pours out an amber color with a frothy white foam. The nose is pretty unremarkable to me as it all seems to kind of blend together and leaves nothing that pulls out in front. The flavor is smooth and a nice blend of some mild malt flavors. The mouthfeel is the highlight as it is silky and smooth, like your hair after conditioner. This beer is pretty easy to drink as it has a mild attack and a clean finish. I find I am ""restraining"" myself because while this beer is good, there are other Belgians of various styles that I feel should be ranked ahead of it."
"Not the best offering from Brewery Ommegang, but certainly a pleasing, easy to drink dark(er) ale."
"A 750ml bottle shared with psycohops and brothercannon. Poured into my Ithaca shaker glass and appears a clear medium chestnut color with about a finger of dense light ecru foam. The foam leaves no lacing on the inside of my glass. Tastes and smells of ripe fall fruits such as pears and green apples, sweet caramel, a touch of spicy yeast and black peppercorns. This Belgian ale is a notch above medium in both body and carbonation and quite dry. One of the better offering of this style that I've had."
"Overall this isn't one of the most flavorful Belgian Darks that I've had, but it is one of the easiest to drink. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice Belgian-style beer with a lot of flavor and substance that doesn't try to overpower you."
"This one just got smoother, and tastier further down the glass. The taste became a bit more tame, but kept all the qualities that make it a great beer. This is one to enjoy outside as the sun is just about to set, or in the dim light of a great bar."
"This upsets me, because I love Ommegang. I'll track down another bottle and try this one again, when I can. I'll update this review, if necessary."
"D: I'm pretty disappointed by this. I don't think I'll pick up another."
"On-tap at The Busy Bee served in an Ommegang chalice a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was sweet malt, spice and yeast. The taste was a nice dry blend of sweet fruits and a touch of spice. The beer is on the light side of medium with a nice dryness and low carbonation. This has always been an interesting beer and it holds up to that on draft."
"Overall, I think this is well-balanced, easy-to-drink, and delicious."
"D: A nice beer with mild flavors that could be a good crossover beer. Ommegang has better offerings however. The value is still good like most of their brews."
"Kind of a light amber/orange pour for a dark ale. Huge white rocky head. Lots of yeast, some malt and fruit in the aroma. Quite a carbonated mouthfeel, but not overly so. Taste has much yeast, malt, some amber leathery tones. Also some toffee/caramel and fruits, citrus and red. Clean finishing. A good drinker for the style especially."
"Mouth: Very carbonated, but not over carbonated for this style of beer. Definately enough to get your tongue tingly. Good amount for a spicy beer."
"Very drinkable and a pleasant flavor profile. This was nice in a somewhat warm afternoon."
"Feel and Drinkability: The most notable thing about this beer is that it is extremely dry. It reminds me of a merlot or something. Very dry and not quenching at all. Carbonation is spritzy and coarse. In my opinion the carbonation gets in the way of the beer's flavor....there's little enough of that as it is. To me it seems as if I'm drinking tonic water, the body is thin and the beer is close enough to flavorless that it bears a striking resembelence. This is one that I'll not be buying again. Not a big fan at all. This one does nothing for me. Dekonink has a real toned down amber as well, but that one is crafted much better than this one, the feel is right and its got a nicer flavor. Sure its not big and in your face but at least its there. I feel that this one is just too weak, its really stretching for it if you ask me."
"Nice medium body, with ample carbonation leading to a smooth substantial feel. I will have no problem polishing this 750 off, which is a nice change."
"Super easy drinking, I think I could handle a big bottle by myself!"
"I had some hype when going into this beer. I expected it to be better, I have liked most of the brews by Ommegang. This one, for me, fell a bit short of par."
"Pours a hazy, deep orange that almost glows like an ember, with a nice tan head with decent retention. Its aromas are interesting. It smells very minerally, almost beachy, with light, fruity ethers reminiscent of apricots, and a pleasant, natural yeastiness. The fact that all of these aromas are present and yet all very subtle makes this beer very intriguing. I've become accustomed to Belgian-style ales practically smacking me in the nose and jarring my tongue with their intensity but this beer does none of those things. Rare Vos has a lot of finesse. Its flavors are complex yet gentle. Its fruity notes range from peaches and apricots to sour strawberries. Its bitterness is best described as unripened fruit rather than ""citrusy," ""piney," ""earthy"" or what have you. Finishes dry and leaves you excited for the next sip. This is another extremely good ale by Ommegang."
"D: Very good beer and great to drink."
"D: Easy and satisfying to drink."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable even at 6.5%. You would not even know that its that high if it was not printed on the bottle. The balanced taste and thin/dry body make it a good candidate for having a few."
"Drinkability - Fantastic beer form one of the best breweries in the world, IMHO. A great beer for novices and veterans alike."
"Overall a good light belgian ale. A-"
"Pours a cloudy brown colored body, with a small whitish head, fizzy but diminishing very quickly. Very floral light sweet aroma. Sweet fizzy taste, clean aftertaste. Floral taste, some acid. Warming up....a little more even taste, not acidic."
"D: Will have an easy time putting back the rest of the 750ml."
"Poured a cloudy amber golden hue with a thick creamy head that faded to lacing. Smell consisted of banana's and mild clove. Taste was very good and very smooth. Tasted banana with a mildly sweet finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability very high. This beer is really really enjoyable and I'm disappointed that I hadn't tried it sooner.This is one that will be a regular at my house!"
"D - Very nice full flavor and smooth finishing beer. Definitely a sessionable ale. The not so high alcohol content allows for a few of these in one night."
"( Hennepin too ). At this price how can you loose? One of the greats from Cooperstown"
"Pours amber with a huge white head (first pour) and fair lacings. Aroma is dominated by yeast. Taste is Belgian yeast strain, sweet malts, hint of bitter hops. Has a bit of boiled ham in the aftertaste. Overall an interesting beer that I probably won't try again."
"Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is good, as I'm having no problem putting the 750 ml bottle away."
"D - Ommegang continues to impress... This is another fine offering that will keep me coming back for more... A brewery in NY that continues to churn out wonderful Belgian ales..."
"Overall, great beer, would recommend this one for sure."
"M&d: medium mouthfeel, good carbonation, still not a session beer, but a great example of the style for a reasonable price"
"Overall, Ommegang has disappointed me again. I think I'm going to go a little bit out of my way from now on to avoid Ommegang's brews. I hate to drag down the average of this well-ranked beer, but it's just unoriginal and not at all memorable in a unique way."
"Fizzy mouthfeel though"
"D- Very drinkable. This stuff is waaay smooth. I really liked this one. It doesn't have a real strong alcohol presence, so it goes down really easy. Reminds me of a mild sherry/brandy."
"Pretty good stuff. I don't think I would actively seek this out and it won't make my six pack club, but good no less."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/2 inch head with decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet earthy malts. There's a lot of hops noticeable. Fits the style, since it has a wide array of possible flavors. Smooth, crisp mouth feel with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt and lots of hops. The bitterness level is strong, but not too overpowering. Overall, another really yummy beer from Ommegang - definitely worth a try!"
"Good drinkable spicy ale."
"The Belgian yeast is the key taste here. Relatively thin with a very high level of carbonation. The hop flavor only shows up at the end. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming."
"The beer is a very nice amber color with good to moderate lacing. I'm always a little bit suspect of small bottles of beers that I almost always see in large bottles, so the small bottle could be the problem here. That might make no sense if I knew a bit more about brewing, but I can only report what I see, and I saw a head dissipate very rapidly. Anyway, the smell is spicy and Belgian. It's a little muted, but there are good notes of dough, coriander, earth and light fruit, maybe apricots. The taste is quite good and a bit of an improvement on the aroma. Some lemon flavor makes itself known, along with more spicing and some background caramel. The feel is sparkly and nice, but it gets a tad sticky in an odd way. The finish is just a bit watery sticky, rather than full sticky if that makes any sense. I keep trying to like Ommegang more, but this one doesn't quite have me on the bandwagon as much as I would like."
"Overall, I'm starting to really like Ommegang's lineup of beers. This is another solid offering."
"I picked up a 750ml bottle in Whole Foods. Pours a lighter shade of amber into my Ommegang glass. Has a real thick head that hangs around for a while before settling into a thinner ring. Leaves a small amount of lacing. Smells of fruit (orange?), spice and light malt. I can also smell a bit of the alcohol. It's got a nice spicy taste to it, with a hint of sweet malt. Not a whole lot of bitternes to this one. It's crisp and dry. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Rather fizzy, but easy to drink. I will most certainly buy another bottle."
"D - A good beer that I'm glad to have finally tried. I certainly would've liked this better with a softer carbonation and perhaps a touch more sweetness, but it's still an easy drinking and pleasant offering from Ommegang."
"http://foodbeertravel.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/rare-vos/"
"D- Very smooth and pleasant. I think I'll have another glass..."
"Cloudy orange beer with a slowly fading head that stays at a quarter of an inch.Aroma is fruity and slightly spicy.Taste is an assortment of fruits with black licorice on the back end.I usually don't agree with the majority but in this case I completely agree.Very good and worth every bit of the 4 pack I got for $9.00.Highly recommended and would gladly puirchase again!!"
"Drinkability- very drinkable. The aftertaste leaves a craving for more, while the balance of juicy oranges with pungent spices leaves another glass or two sounding like a good idea."
"Poured a cloudy rust-like color in my snifter. The head came on strong but was gone in short time. The moderate lace hung on and lasted to the end. Distinct aroma of pear and clove (sorry, no leather, tobacco, and other such like comparisons the beer cognescenti refer to. We home brewers and winemakers know about esters). The nice carbonation makes for lots of bite but leaves a smooth foamy mouthfeel after each swallow. Hops are just right. You know they exist, but you're not left with the bitterness of Ommegang's Hennipen. All in all, a very nice ale. One I'll drink many times over (as long as I have a job...otherwise I'll be drinking Busch at 4 bucks a six pack). As young Bobby Zimmerman said, ""The times they are a changing""."
"Overall: Very good, light, fruity brew. Extremely Drinkable."
"(rated Jul 17, 2007)"
"It pours with a gold tinted off-white beige head. It has an amber body with a little bit of fizz to it but not much. It smells like malt and fruity wine/grape and fig. It tastes a lot like the aroma. It has a strong malt flavor with a very fruity aftertaste. There is mild hops bitterness but not much. It has creamy smooth mouthfeel and it is very drinkable."
"This nice looking bottle pours a dirty rusty brown. It has a thick creamy tan cap that has amazing hang time,well the center has nice hang time,the edges colapse first, leaving a pillar of head jetting out of the center of my snifter. A few large chunks of yeast are swirling around,even on a slow and gentle pour. The nose is beyond understated and smells faintly of dried rasins, bread crust and light spice mixture. Right upfront I get a tangy tartness that is not appealing to me in the least. Light maltiness never comes full circle and seems weak and underpowered. A subtle yeasty fruitness is underlying and is really the best part of this disapointing offering. Ommegang has impressed me over and over,this one just didn't do it. I will try this again, just to see if this was a fluke. A thin mouthfeel and bitter dry finish did this no favors either."
"This beer poured deep copper with peach and orange highlights and a two-finger off-white head. The smell starts off with some sweet malt that gives way to grain and some fruitiness and spices. The taste starts off with some sweet malt and gives way to a wide array of fruits including dark plums, grapes, and little pineapple and citrus. After that the hops and spices kick in, including some anise and coriander. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with medium carbonation that ends in a little dryness. This is not necessarily the most drinkable beer as far as quantity, but it's definitely one that will make you think about what you're drinking. The taste is constantly shifting, which is perfect for the large bottle I bought it in. A great beer if you can get your hands on it, a testament to the impact Belgium's had on the flavor of beer all over and a good reason to seek out other beers in the style."
"Reviewed on 4/21/08. On tap at the Colgate Inn. Pours an orange-amber with a small white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, some light flowery hops. Reminds me of a witte- lots of spices (corriander and anise star)and light citrus fruits. Finish of a buttery roll, kind of salty (but in a good way). A great session. Very drinkable. 7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"D: Very good drinkability, yeasty, sour and a very good example all around."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a thick foamy white head and large chunks of yeast floating around. Citrus sour aroma of lemon, orange and grapefruit. Sweet citrus flavor that contains a lot of yeast and a touch of maltiness."
"D: Pretty drinkable, though the finish could be cleaner its not unpleasant."
"Low ABV and great taste makes this a good drinkable beer."
"amber orange murky with lace. smell is pineapple, apricot, pear. the nose carries over to the palate consistently. the hop is minty and it has a mild apricot sweet to it. straw yeasty and a light grapefruit finish with some buttery yeast malt quality. a well rounded brew. good american example. have had it before and it didn't turn out as good."
"D = This is a pleasant, good drinking beer but just a little simpler than I expected."
"D - This has been my go-to Thanksgiving beer for about five years now, and it's never let me -- or anyone else partaking -- down. Well rounded and full-bodied, yet tame enough to act as a sympathetic character, allowing the savory flavors of the meal to shine through. So easy and so delicious."
"I poured a 12 ounce beer into a tulip glass. This is a very pretty beer. It pours a hazy copper color with an impresive white head. As the head recedes it leaves little lacing, but a thin froth remains on top. The smell is of slightly sour cherries. The first sip is mildly sweet with a sour cherry finish, and the finish lingers! The beer is full bodied and is a pleasant sipper."
"After touring the brewery we learned that bottle conditioning does not apply to kegs, so this is reallya different experience than this brew in the bottle. Maybe less complex, but a fabulously refreshinga nd gloriously tangy spicy brew (grains of paradise, it turns out). Very balanced. A winner."
"This beer leaves me fairly neutral, but reading through other's reviews it is clear that many hold Rare Vos in much higher regards than I can understand. To my palate this never materialized as a life-altering scrumptious beer. On one hand it's just another Belgian-influenced ale lacking the oomph, the complexity, the tight balance that makes a good beer great, and yet on the other it is a good solid ale. Nothing special."
"Cheers!"
"D: The relatively low alcohol, refreshing carbonation, and interesting flavor makes this something I could enjoy many of"
"D: A good brew. This is a bit of a wide open style so I didn't have any preconceived expectations. That said, I thought it was a bit too bitter and noseless."
"I bought this bottle mostly too harvest the yeast from the bottle to make a tripel. That being said I have avoided buying this particular beer before, and it was stupid to do so, this is great. Pairing it with a nice rib eye and a simple salad. Pours a light amber, think falling leaves, with a active dancing head the carbonation keeps going strong in the mouth, and tastes great while doing it. A good strong belgian, I only hope my beer made with the yeast is half as good."
"Drinkability is moderate. I'm disappointed with this beer. The body isn't working for me and the flavor profile is weak. Decent, but subpar IMO."
"Enthusiastically recommend this beer to anyone!"
"Nice off white head offwhite/cream coloured lace. A pale copper hue. Nice nose with spicy aroma with hints nutmeg and citric zest with a slightly spicy finish Goes well with aged cheddar and summer suasage. For the price, this beer iis for sure a keeper on my list!"
"D Great drinkability. I could easily drink the whole 750 ml bottle from which this came in a session."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth"
"It is a smooth, sweet and spicy sip that offers a slight warming feeling as it goes down. That may have been more due to the serving temp. The nose advertised the taste well. The bread came through more in the finish. IT was a full, thick mouthfeel. I served this after it had been out of the cooler for about an hour, I felt this opened up the beer's flavor rather than serving it straight from the cooler."
"Pours a soft orange-brown body with a thick, three-finger head that forms like sponge--and lacing is a beautiful web that coats the OFFICIAL Rare Vos glass... yeasts are fruity and spicy--malts are interwoven with balance... without prior knowledge, this beer could smell like any number of styles--versatile! Palate is medium-bodied and a bit astringent--a finish with warmth befitting a 6.5% ABV... smooth and slick with lingering effects... citrus hops and strong malts collide in a seesaw that keeps the tongue in a suspended bliss... like a Belgian monk and a German beer wench brought forth a beautiful love child... rule one: Ommegang doesn't brew a bad beer; rule two: each is a study in itself, demanding a session of focus and appreciation, followed by another sessio to compare and rethink... Rare Vos is a complex beer that chllenges and rewards--excellent."
"As always Ommegang brings a fantastic Belgian style beer to the table at half the price. :)"
"Don't drink and review."
"D: The texture and flavors make this one a prime target to session. Hits you pretty hard for only 6.5% too."
"Overall, this is a remarkable showing by Ommegang. A nice light Belgian that does not lack on taste or character."
"The 6.5% definitely keeps this from being a sessionable brew, unless your name is Andre Roussimoff. But at $5.99 for a 750 ml bottle, this sure as shit beats a trip to Belgium (or Cooperstown for that matter). A great beer at great price. You really can't beat it."
"From the first sniff to the last swallow, this is a top-to-bottom classic! Like a Cuban cigar amidst the swirling of autumn leaves."
"So I was at an Oktoberfest last night and I took place in a keg tossing competition and I won, this was my prize so we popped it opened and tried it. This beer pours a cloudy dark amber with lacing. The nose is nice on this beer with hints of bananas and apples. The taste most reminds me of an apple crisp. A very pleasant mouthfeel, the carbonation level seemed correct. I drinkable brew, wouldn't be an all nighter for me but I enjoyed what I had!"
"Poured into my Chimay chalice and produced a one finger head that turned into a small island of foam in the center of my vessel. The smell of some kind of fruit, apple? melon? fresh cut grass. Taste of said fruitness, with some spice, coriander? clove, Some sweet like malts. The carbonation keeps rising into the center of my chalice, and to the center of my tongue. Another great brew from one of my favorite breweries."
"Taste is spicy, but, mellow with a slight metallic taste. As it warms, it becomes more fruity, again, like apple. The mouthfeel is full bodied. This is an easy drinker that flavors up as it warms. Excellent."
"D - This is a very refreshing and enjoyable ale. Yet another outstanding brew from the Brewery Ommegang."
"Very good beer over all. Would definitely recommend and I can't wait to try more Belgian brews."
"12 oz bottle. Pours an dense orange/amber with a mega off-white head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of bread and fruit. Initial taste of fruit and spice. Flavor dries out at the backend and is kinda yeasty. Light to medium body, light carbonation, limited lacing, and light on alcohol. Overall, on par with Ommegang offerings, not particularly special."
"Poured this into a wine glass. Pours a clear amber color, with a thin white head that settles very slowly. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Smell has a faintly fruity aroma, maybe a bit of molasses or brown sugar. Taste has a slight sweet flavor, with some spices, clove, very faint anise. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin with a slight bit of effervesence. Flavor is nice and abv is moderate, making this a easily drinkable brew."
"The finish is a little short and a light bitter hop spiciness can be detected. I think this beer would be a perfect, I just mowed the lawn and would like a quality beer to cool off, beer. I would not walk into this one expected huge flavor or even memorable characteristics. I am expecting more from the other Ommegang beers, but overall Rare Vos is not too bad."
"Not my favorite Ommegang, though I haven't tried them all, but that ain't saying much, because I consistently prefer their output head and shoulders over almost any other American brewery."
"Drinkability is good. This is a solid Belgian Ale. Not a real powerhouse of flavors. But that fits well here. This is a nice, subtle and tasty easy drinking beer. I wouldn't rush out to buy this again, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down."
"Not a bad beer, but it gets a bit monotonous in the long run."
"D: This is a tasty dark Belgian-style beer and certainly one of the cheapest 750s you're going to see in the store, that alone demands a repurchase at some point. Good beer."
"D - Very refreshing and the ABV is in check so this gets high marks in my book. This is a food friendly, tasty brown ale."
"D: Can't believe I've waited so long to try this beer. I'm definitely grabbing more and soon"
"Clean and fresh enough to drink more than one in a sitting if you are up for it."
"Pours a clear amber with a thick creme head. Doughy, inky, yeasty nose. Flavor is smooth. High amounts of dough. Lots of it. Minor spicy. More minor funk. Some citrus fruits are there too. It's smooth and well done. Feel has a biting carbonation and the liquid is good. Very easy to drink. A good Belgian style ale."
"This beer went great with some cold pizza. Nothing extradonary, but a very quaffable & affordable Belgian style brew."
"Poured a orangish, ruby tinted body with minimal head but left it there because of good carbonation. A simplistic but good, strong swwet malt base smell with some citric notes, mostly orange peel, and some spices (clove). Smooth and medium-bodied, this beer has a crisp fruit taste that is spicy, yet also contains a good amount of sweetness to it and was slighty chewey/doughey. A nutty, dry backbite complements the beer as it goes down and this is a nice Belgian that I could relax with all day while watching college football (which I am doing now)."
"East drinking beer, much enjoyed."
"D - Fairly high. A nice one to bring to dinner with friends and family."
"A very easy drinking beer. Pours a light amber color with a generous off-white head and a bit of lacing. It really does have a great look to it. Aroma was faint but pleasant, subtle hops, malts with a sweet spiciness to it. There's not a ton of flavor but it's good for the summer. Somewhat spicy, with floral notes, sugar, a mild bitter hop bite and some yeast. Very smooth and a pretty good mix of flavors."
"Amber body with a rapidly diminishing off-white head. A small cap is replenished by a steady stream of bubbles. Grainy, sweet fruity aroma. Fruity, spicy yeast is clearly present in the flavour, along with some bready malts. Seemed quite aggressively carbonated, and along with the yeast profile, it reminded me somewhat of Unibroue."
"Clingy tan head with delicate bubbles. Great retention and good lacing. Orange or amber color like a Midwest sunset. Aroma of sweets fruits and rich soil. Great flavors displaying much depth like an aged wine. Tropical fruits and exotic spices. Cloves, mango, white pepper, fermented grapes. Light carbonation, dry finish with a crisp nip. Velvety smooth and the sweet character does not cloy the intriguing flavors. Clearly a quality brew."
"(Did have another later with dinner.)"
"A good attempt by an American brewery at a Belgian style. They succeed very well in re-creating the style, I'd reccomend it."
"Medium in body and slick with fine, subtle carbonation that works very well to lighten and freshen Rare Vos. Superb drinkability."
"Pours amber in color with reddish hues. An impressive two inch head forms on the pour and manages to stick around for awhile. Smell is yeasty, bready and a bit musty. Taste is more of they yeasty and bready experience, but there's a slight metallic flavor as well. Not sure where that is coming from. Very highly carbonated. I'll let this one sit for awhile and warm up, hopefully the carbonation will die down a bit. Decent beer, but not overly complex by any means."
"This came across as a nice example of a Belgium Amber, even though I'm relatively new to the style this is a solid beer. Pour was an intense copper with abundant head and lacing, both of which lasted for the entire experience. Constant carbonation is visible. The aroma came across similar to other Belgian styles that I have had, in fact it smelled similar to a saison. I believe it is the yeast that produces this unique aroma and flavor. Somewhat spicy and hoppy, there was a definite presence of sweet malts, perhaps a touch of caramel. The flavor is good although a bit weak in my opinion when compared to the aroma. Malty with nice overtones of spices and fruits, there is a well deserved hop finish in the flavor that is especially nice. Tasty and complex a truly enjoyable beer."
"This is a damn good beer that I am downing with supreme please. Quite tasty, though not super complex, but the carbonation/feel rivals Belgian productions."
"Drinkability: Had the dunkelweizen at Piece brewpub again last night. That was far superior to this one, on the drinkability scale. Good, but I'd take the Hennepin over this one any day."
"An enjoyable nightcap to 800 miles of driving over a twelve hour span. Ommegang continues to please."
"Drinkability wasn't bad, I do suggest letting this one warm slightly to bring our more of the flavors. Not as complex or as strong as other beers of this type I've had, but has enough going for it to make it a nice beer. Probably wouldn't go out of my way for it, but if offered it, would gladly drink more."
"Taste: This reminds me somewhat of a Belgian dubbel, with many of the fruity, brown sugary characteristics of the style. Maltiness comes in the form of biscuits, but blended, much like a Fig Newton. Sweet, but in no way cloying, and nicely balanced throughout. Midpalate in nicely spicy with cinnamon and clove. Finishes spiced again with more fruit notes. A good interpretation of a Belgian style by an American brewery. Actually tastes Belgian. Refreshing."
"D, notes:This beer has great drinkability. Very tasty and well balanced. Can Ommegang do no wrong?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Not a bad beer at all and definitely unique in my beer experience. Not something I would drink 6 of, but I do think one after dinner would be quite nice. The alcohol is very well hidden. Very good Ommegang!"
"This poured a slightly hazy bronze with lots of tan head. It smelled like citrus and wild floral hops with wild Belgian yeast, and no noticeable malt. It tasted very potent, more sweet than bitter, like earthy wheat mixed with wild floral hops, light honey malt, and some mulled spices. It was thick with some carbonation, and had a smooth bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and well constructed beer, that wasn't overpowering in its Belgian flavoring. I definitely enjoyed this."
"Rare Vos is a treat to the palate and a beer I could enjoy for a while with a few friends. There are numerous flavors and qualities that leave you seeking another sip to find more to enjoy."
"D: The big bottle will do me."
"Great drinkability. Would buy again as a dinner beer."
"Another wonderful beer form Ommegang! The aroma that erupts both from the bottle and from the puffy, long-lasting head is full of bread, bananas, peaches, cloves and leaves. The color is a beautiful amber-mahogany, with a bit white head that settles down to about an inch and stays there. There's plenty of fruit in the taste, but the most striking thing to me was how smooth it was, and how rich it tasted down to the last drop. After the bottle was empty, I found myself breathing out of the top of bottle just so I wouldn't lose the smell of the beer. You won't go wrong with this, at any time of year."
"D: really nice beer for a Belgian amber, but probably my least favorite from Ommegang. Just not a huge fan of ambers."
"($2.70, 12oz, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"Bottle Pour: Pours amber. Big bannana and corriander yeast aroma. The yeast smells and tastes much more like the strains used in Hefeweizens rather than most belgian beers I've had. Still very good. Lively carbonation. Fruit, malt, wheat-yeast.... goes down very smooth."
"I live for this kinda stuff - domestic interpretations of great Belgian styles. It's very complex, very well-balanced, and very drinkable. Sly fox indeed."
"Haven't had a beer from this brewery yet that wasn't delicious."
"D- a few non-connoisseurs that i've talked to (not that i am one...YET) have expressed a sincere dislike for this beer and i couldn't agree less. as far as american belgians go, i put it at the top of the list, or very close to it, and i really feel as if i'm drinking something imported. it has that taste you only get from the real deal AND the boldness and audacity that you rarely find outside of america. a perfect pairing of old world tradition and new world ingenuity and a definite 'members only' spot in my fridge."
"This beer is smooth and easy to drink. And the relatively low alcohol (6.5%) for a Belgian means you can get in one or two more. I was pleasantly surprised with this one."
"Another winner from Ommegang!"
"From a 750 ml bottle in to a goblet. Hazy orange with off white head. Smells bready with some fruit in the background. Snappy sweet taste that is rather tart with some fruit in it. Carbonated mouthfeel that would do very well with food. Not a life changer, but a very nice beer."
"Exellent! American breweries can be proud of thier belgian style ales!"
"A very enjoyable Belgian, but I'm not sure if I will purchase again. Don't get me wrong, I would still recommend it."
"D - A good beer. Nothing off, and the nose is really nice, but overall it fails to deliver."
"Drinkability: A fine, easy-drinking brew from Ommegang. Certainly worth a try. Oh, and the orange slice? It was delicious."
"Frothy white head with nice lacing ,nice amber color ,slightly hazy ,good carbonation, good balance of fruit and spice. Very drinkable ; overall this is just about an exceptional ale. I love the overall balance of all the ingredients. Yet another quality brew from ommegang"
"D - I really recall this being a better beer than it is, but I have no reason to think that there is anything with this bottle. Nothing particularly bad about it, but it is just kind of dull and unremarkable, especially the flavor."
"Drinkability: Light, crisp and balanced. This one always leaves you wanting another. I bought as a single but well definitely pick up a 4 pack next time I'm out. This is exactly what I've wanted as something light; I'm stunned how good this is for the prices of $7 for a 4 pack."
"Pours a five-finger thick white head that takes forever to fade leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Wheat/yeast nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is fruity & yeasty, almost a clean finish. 750ml bottle $5.99 from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Overall - quite a decent Belgian style dubbel from Ommegang, although I've had better from them. Definitely worth a try"
"D: Very, very drinkable. Not quite a top echelon beer, but very close. Definitely one I come back to time and again and one I would recommend anyone try. Shows off what a tremendous brewery Ommegang is."
"I can drink this beer all night, and have a few times. Very well crafted and easy to drink."
"This is one ""Sly Fox"". It has a beautiful red/ orange amber color with a hazy body. Tiny bubbles form a thick foamy head that has a light tan color. An inviting aroma of sweet floral orange and spices mingle with doughy yeast and malts. On the tongue there is a complex sweet, fruity and spicy character with caramel malts and doughy yeast mixing with dark cherries, spices and orange peel. Hops add some light bitterness and dryness to the finish. The palate is full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. It is smooth and very drinkable. Outstanding!"
"Overall a perfect beer for a variety of meals/occasions. No problems enjoying a four pack of this treat."
"delicious"
"Hazy orange hue, off white head that lasts until you're finished. Slight bit of marmalade, pancake syrup and sugar dominate the nose, followed by a true Belgian nose that has some bananas, earth and some soft floral hops. Palate is quite creamy, but with enough carbonation to not make it feel viscous at all. Belgian candied sugar controls the palate, with creamy/earthy malts. Good and quite drinkable"
"Poured this beer into my Chimay goblet. It pours a hazy golden with a big, white head that faded into just a thin white layer on the top of the beer. The aroma has hints of vanilla and apricot. The taste is mildly sweet with nothing that really sticks out about its taste profile. There is a slight tangy sensation at the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and is a bit more carbonated than I had expected. While this might seem like a ho hum beer by my review, these 5 judging categories just don't do it justice. There really needs to be a sixth category for balance. This has to be the most balanced beer I've ever drunk. There really isn't any flavor that I can really distinguish. It's really amazing."
"D: An ok drinkable beer. Feels very nice on the palette, but the tequila characteristic of the beer took a little bit away from it for me. I think that someone else might be able to handle a sixer of these as it is a fairly rounded brew, but I just could not get over the tequila aftertaste."
"Final thoughts - Nice brew. Very mild."
"Sweet fruits surface in the aroma, mixed amongst the Belgium yeast. A rather dry Belgium style brew, the fruits don't make much a statement in the taste. A bit of peppery spice help add some pizzazz, but all things considered - this won't be one I go for again."
"D: This is immensely drinkable for its style and ABV."
"Drinkability was very high with this one, light enough to be sessionable, wonderful complexity of flavors without being bogged down by alcohol or thickness."
"Drinkability- A solid brew especially for the 5.99 price. Worth a revisit."
"I wasn't overly impressed by this one, but it's not a bad brew. The apples and subtle spices hit up front, along with a nice amout of toasty malt. Bitterness is kept to a low, as expected. There's a slight warming alcohol in the finish. I'm a huge fan of Ommegang, but this beer was not up to par with their other efforts, in my opinion. Still, it's better than many other American takes on Belgian ales I've had."
"This beer has excellent flavor and balance and does not come off too sweet or dry. Can easily have a few of these."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is pretty good with a medium body despite the lighter flavors. Carbonation is light but steady adding to the lighter mouth feel. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: It was a well balanced and surprising brew. Lots of spices, rich body and moderate ABV make this a great session brew."
"Poured a clear amber with a thick white head. The smell came out of the bottle as soon as the cork came out. Smelled a little funky. Some grassy and musty scents took over a slight malt presence. Tasted light and fruity with a slight straw taste and some bitterness. This one also got better as it warmed. The mouthfeel was thin and dry and works as a great session for me. Another great belgian inspired ale from Ommegang."
"Tasted on 2/19/08."
"Drinkability is there, for sure. I could easily be pursuaded that this is a true belgian, not a US micro. Great job!"
"This brew is a little sweet for me to drink a ton of."
"I enjoyed this, but it wasn't quite as malty as I was expecting. Still it was a good beer, and a nice Belgian take on the amber style. I have a feeling Rare Vos would pair even better with food than by itself."
"I frequent the Ommegang beers more than just about any other brand. They are cheap, easily accessible, and about as close as you can get when it comes to an American brewery taking on Belgian styles (Allagash coming in at a close second IMO). Nine times out of ten I go with Hennepin, Ommegang or Three Philosophers, but rarely this one (or the witbier). The first time I tried it I don't remember being all that impressed, but with this new batch, I decided it was time for another visit. Poured in to my Stella Artois glass a very nice strawberry blond, with a large, foamy white head. The color is quite striking, giving off a sort of glow. Aroma reveals a melange of fruit such as orange, lemon, nectarine, and also a pinch of spice lingering in the background. Flavor begins with the citrus fruits mentioned above, with a nice yeasty finish. Malt is also worth mentioning, as it is well balanced with the light hops. Mouthfeel is lush, nicely carbonated, and very refreshing. Although the ABV isn't all that high, I could feel a bit of warmth after a few sips. I still could drink two bottles of this without too much of a problem. I am now quite happy I came back to this one. It seems like the most underrated of the beers from Ommegang."
"Pours a cloudy amber red with a nice foamy head that lingers for a long time. It has a very light bready and spice aroma. The beer had just enough spice in the taste to make it interesting, with a slightly sweet, caramel malt body and a light hop bite at the end. At 6.5% ABV it's quite drinkable. Overall a very easy drinking beer."
"Poured into a chalice a nice light orange color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, minimal lacing though. The nose is malty, with some slight yeast, tangy (citrus/grapefruit/grapes), with some slight spice and caramel. The taste is malty/yeasty, I really enjoy the tangyness (grapey) tones this brew has, slight spice/caramel. Medium body, a well-rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, another very tasty brew from Ommegang, highly recommended."
"Overall, as far as Belgian styles, there are infinite others that are miles above this example, so I cannot recommend it."
"The best thing about this ale is its appearence. It is a beautifull cloudy orange/amber color with a very quickly fading head. The overall aroma was very light with a strong dose of yeast and some citrus. The taste was nice, slightly sweet throughout, not really bitter at all. The finish was quite short. Medium to light body with somewhat over the top lively carbonation."
"It's quite drinkable overall. A well-rounded, enjoyable brew."
"Sorry, this is a Belgian ""Dark""? and the finest at that? OK, don't get me wrong, this is a REALLY nice beverage. My point on the ""dark"" characteristic is...if they're calling in news crews because we're 'drinking a dark' then I'm missing the boat. Duval is calling this an amber...OK, it's amber. How difficult is it to rate a beer when the swath of acceptable interpretation is so wide that you can drive a truck through it...what's the point. Again, Dr. Lew Bryson has a fitting argument about 'style'. Anyway, it smells 'wonderful'. IMO, when a beverage reveals that classic earthy Belgian yeast aroma then you're in for a treat. What's interesting to me about this one is that how malt presents itself in a toasted character. There is an aggressiveness that i would normally associate with alcohol, but at 6.5% ABV, this one may be deceiving me. The mouth feel is well carbonated and light. The flavor is earthy, creamy and has a maltiness that i personally associate with a lager. The mouth/taste combination is quite drinkable. Sorry if this isn't helpful; intended more as ""notes to self"". Enjoy."
"A good tasting ale, you definetly taste the hops and fruit with a mild spice."
"Tastes of spices, yeasty, dry floral hops and fruity. Good dry finish, very drinkable."
"This is a highly drinkable beer. Not too heavy or light. Very tangy and has a lot of personality."
"I think I'll have to pick up another bottle and try again. This one hit me on the subtle side and that surprised me."
"Quite dry and well-carbonated. Easy to drink."
"As with all Ommegang beers, this is a beer I'll be buying more of."
"Recently tried Ommegang's Abbey Ale, and really liked it... this one is probably just as good if not better... considered a Belgian Dark Ale, this porus a light-copper, hazy color with a decent head... Copped singly from Total Wine and More in Union, this is an outstanding brew... typical Belgian Ale flavors with yeasty alcohol and sweet, fruity flavors present... taste complements the aroma, with a sharp, sweet, fruity flavor that goes down crisp, clean and smooth... great aftertaste and good mouthfeel with an incredibly easy drinkability... Nice blend of fruit and sugar present in the taste, and although that typical Belgian Ale flavor is present, the fruity-sweet characteristic of the brew is not at all overwhelming... Excellent beer... Definitely recommended..."
"One of the most drinkable Belgian style beers I've had. I could make an evening out of this beer. A pleasure to drink."
"This is a beer that at 6.5% is almost sessionable and with the way it tastes, it's a good thing the alcohol is so low. This is a beer that you want to drink. A lot. It's an absolutely out-of-this-world-smooth amber- more american brewers need to make amber's like this. It's the polar opposite of the Hopback Amber/Nugget Nectar-school of amber brewing, and is put together nicely enough that it's merits can be thrown up against Brewery Ommegang's other offerings; not an easy accomplishment when you are going against Three Philosopher's and Ommegang Abbey Ale, but this beer for a lot of people will eclipse the aforementioned beers. This is a beer that, if it were more widely distributed, could be like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, occupying the growing category of gateway beers that bring the drinker from generic American Macro Lagers to Craft Brewed beers. A truly inspired effort by Ommegang and one that is sure to be a staple of my beer fridge for years to come."
"poured from the champagne-style bottle, this was a good looking beer-cloudy amber with a nice off-white head and lacing. bouqet was very fruity, with apricots and raspberries coming to mind along with notes of honey, flowers, fresh bread dough and a musty barnyard aroma. taste was a bit of sweet malt with a moderate bitterness. astringent, sourish finish. medium in body with a spritzy mouthfeel."
"Pours a nice cloudy orangey amber with a big fluffy one and a half white head that bubbles down to a cap in a few minutes, there is a solid cookie yeasty funk but really nothing else, the taste is much like the smell with spicy yeast and a bit of fresh red apple with a suprisingly alcoholic finish, the mouth feel is rather loose and watery and rather insubstantial. The drinkablity is smooth and easy but not what I was expecting from this style of beer at all."
"Brew poured to a nice orange color with amber highlights. Filled the goblet perfectly with a nice sized head that went right to the rim of the glass. Surprising this did not translate into a nice amount of lacing? The aromas that come to mind first are fruit, to me it has a strong apple presence. Also there is a classic clove yeast scent that is just so good! Also a nice subdued spiciness. The flavor is very good, spicy on the back of the mouth reminds me of a peppery mix, sweet flavors from the malts almost a candy like flavor. Adequate hop and a nice semi-dry finish. Now I will admit that I am not the best at putting my thoughts down on paper so I know that I am missing a few things here but IMO this is a excellent brew, one that I have had numerous times in the past (being in NY) but not in a number of years. Glad to give this one a try once again, a very solid offering from Ommegang."
"What flavor there is is OK, it just doesn't blow your socks off. Malts, berries, and then a touch of acidity and baking soda in the aftertaste."
"Pours a golden/light amber color with a thick, fluffy head that hangs there. Aroma is strong and malty with a hint of spice. Taste is malty and rich upfront with a fruity/spicy element showing through. Tastes a bit funky in a good way. Coriander/nutmeg stand out to me (even if they may not be in this beer) and it's just a very solid ale."
"Hazy and orange with a decent head, plenty of lacing. Aroma of floral hops maybe cloves and apples. Taste is dry and malty with a clean coarse carbonated finish. Mouthfeel is decent and the flavor stands up to the spiciest foods. A little expensive to drink a lot of this one but certainly a pleasure I would indulge in again."
"D - Very drinkable. I could easily drink a couple of these. An excellent beer"
"drinkability - Not bad, worth a try. Anything is good from Ommegang. I drank this almost a year later."
"Drinkability: A good brew. Easy to consume."
"Mouthfeel is pleasantly dry with the perfect amount of carbonation. I plan on getting my hands on a case of this for the summer. Extremely refreshing and nice entry point into the world of craft beer for non-beer-geek friends."
"Not quite what the Chimay blue is as far as the Belgian style goes, but this is still a very good beer."
"Cloudy dark golden with a thin white head, sticky looking though. Sour wheat and yeast characters with some soft lemon lime, rocky candy, and floral hop notes for a nose. Yeasty twang is very smoothed out, nutty and caramel malts, toasted wheat cracker, cereal grains, herbal and floral hop characters are slightly perfumy, citrus is lemony with a touch of grapefruit pith. Some caramel into the finish with coriander like spiciness and unripe green banana. Medium to full body has a nice smooth mouthfeel, slightly cloying, and a crisp carbonation that eeks out some creaminess."
"Hoppier than expected. Good stuff."
"The beer fell cleanly into my glass with a good thick head of white suds that remained until I was finished. Active bubbles are visible through the clear cedar colored body. Smells of sweets and spices give way to a more subtle flavor of toasted grains and bready yeast. A lingering raisin flavor stays int eh mouth after the swallow. The scratchy, almost velcro mouthfeel perfectly accompanies this brew. Definitely worth the buy."
"Mouthfeel as noted above is smooth, but not what I would describe as creamy. The tight bubbles of carbonation seem to bring the spices to the forefront, which came off a little overbearing in my opinion. Looks great and smells great, but doesn't come off as such overall. Nonetheless worth a go."
"Mouthfeel is medium light, much better than expected as this is characterized here as a belgian dark which tend to get too thick and sweet for me. Very enjoyable and very drinkable. An absolute delight."
"Drinkability: High quality, extremely enjoyable Belgian amber ale perfect for quaffing. (4.5)"
"So easy to drink, and excellent paired with food. Very versatile - good with a hot ham sandwich or Thanksgiving dinner. Definitely a beer to always have on hand - drinkable and flavorful."
"D: Pretty good."
"Had this beer in Cooperstown, NY. It was pretty darn good, especially on-tap. The beer came to me with a nice, thich head. The coloring was a nice light-brown/reddish color. The smell was nice, but I do not remember much regarding that. The taste was a nice, nutty flavor with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel was good, not too thick, not too thin. A well-balanced beer worth trying again."
"another from the Ommegang gang ; pours a hazy light copper-brown w/ a huge head that took it's time going down, good lacing as well ; a bready fruit aroma w/ an orange-like citrusy undertone, a faint alcohol prescence as well ; a tart, slighlty vinous flavor, w/ an interesting hop flavor as well, some fruity flavor comes through in the end ; a dry, light-med bodied brew, very bubbly, can't help but burp after each sip ; a nice beer, not to high of an ABV makes this one quite quaffable..."
"Like so many Ommegang products, Rare Vos is a treat, great to enjoy on a cold Winter evening, great to share (especially since it comes in 750ml bottles), and it goes great with cheeses. Smooth and tasty, it is one of my absolute favorites. Try it and enjoy."
"This has a nice cloudy pour with a taste to fit. This is a smooth amber beer with a bit of spice and mild sweet to it. Smells like a yeasty beer, and it is. Good head and bubbles coupled with a lack of overt bitterness make this a quite drinkable beverage."
"D: I like it, always have but one of these big bottles will suffice at a sitting."
"Poured into a red wine glass. Presented with a smell of malt and yeast. Nice caramel/amber color with a fluffy white head. Lacing clung to the side of the glass throughout the tasting. Well carbonated, but not overly so. Pleasant mouthfeel with a tingle across the tongue. Mild, hoppy taste, reminiscent of a pale ale, with a subtle taste of coriander to boot. Clean finish with a slight taste of alcohol at the end. Another enjoyable brew from Ommegang, although not what I would consider characteristic of a Belgian."
"Drinkability  I would have another, but wouldn't seek this beer out."
"This beer pours a cloudy reddish-brown color. The heas id large, fluffy, and white. It recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is of yeast, cloves, pears, and squash. The taste is like the aroma, but with a nice mustiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice, lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I would dink again."
"D: This is Ommegangs weak sister."
"D- Rare Vos is a nice Belgian Ale. I will probably have this one again. I have enjoyed other offerings from Ommegang a lot more than this one so far but this is still a solid beer."
"Pours a cloudy orange-ish color with a white head. Aromas of candied sugar and a Belgian yeast. In the taste, Belgiany sweet malt and a hint of corriander. A small bitter mouthfeeland a dry Belgian yeast aftertaste. Smooth and mellow, with a nice hop presence."
"Really a very, very good beer overall."
"Pours out a cloudy orange amber with huge head and massive carbonation.Smells very estery,my sense of smell sucks but the esters show through.Taste is a very neutral beer slight esters,but very light in malt and hops.Mouthfeel is normal,,drinkablility is actually very well,,go down really smooth."
"This brew is easy to drink and very refreshing. Solid beer, recommended."
"D- This beer is light in sweetness but has a nice subtle complex flavor. The soft bitterness and the nice sweet flavor have some good depth."
"D - A pleasant malty belgian. Worth a try for sure. A very tasty ale one I would probably pair w/ poultry."
"A luscious amber, somehat cloudy brew. A modest but healthy fuzzy head that fades pretty quickly with nice lacing. The smell is mildly malt and wheat, a bit like a hefe but a mellower quality. Then the first taste says more hefe to me. I didn't expect that. I don't get the hops so much, more like a mild brown bread but decidedly like a hefe with delicate wheat and lots of citrus going on. Strong tingling carbonation at the front but it maintains a subtle blended flavor and feel, medium drinkability but more to be savored for those who admire the style. Not my favorite style though."
"Comment: This is my first Belgium Style Amber and maybe it just took me by surprise, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe it's just a style that I need to get more accustomed too."
"Awesome brew. Very cheap to get and very amazing."
"Drinkablity is wonderful."
"Yeaaah Boooy.... Sorry that's the gangster in me coming out... once again refer to the avatar... Its proof I'm gangster... <insert laughing from the masses>"
"About $10 per four-pack"
"I was a little disappointed in this brew as compared with some of Ommegang's other offerings. Not a bad brew, but I would rate 3 Philosophers and Hennepin well above this brew."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown color with a thick off-white head. The bubbles were tight and the lacing was pretty. The aroma is initially sour with malt showing through after a few minutes rest. The taste is spicy and sour with some sweetness. The mouthfeel is thin to medium but shows a carbonation bite. Overall, this is a delight."
"I am currently brewing an amber ale and can only hope that my beer turns out close to this. I really love the color of the beer. Its a light amber with just a bit of cloudiness. The foam on any of these beers in the 750ml bottle can get a bit much if you dont pour it slow. overall a great beer that I will be buying again."
"This is moderately drinkable. It's light, but lots of carbonation, and while the taste is inoffensive and pretty good, it's not so great you can't get enough."
"12oz bottle. Pours a nice cloudy dark copper with decent head, but only some lacing. Aroma is spicy and yeasty - kind of like a hefeweizen. First taste is tangy and spicy. Further tastes continue with the spice dominating. It's a nice flavour, though perhaps not overly complex."
"Great clingy off white head, slightly hazy. Aromas are big on the esters, with dark fruit and spice/herbals like aniseed and clove. Dryish on the palate, thought it could use a little more body and flavor. Reasonably crisp, but doesn't hold up as well at warmer temperatures, as a large phenolic flavor goes from support to dominance, especially in the finish."
"D-a decent offering from Ommegang, not my favourite"
"Not sure why this is classified as a dark ale because it pours a light amber color. Has the trademark Belgian yeast taste and is a very good beer. If you are new to Belgians this is a good starting point. Very well made and easy to drink more than one."
"D - Pretty good. Fairly low ABV for a Belgian and a pleasant flavor. A bit phenolic but splitting the bottle would be nice."
"Ommegang's Rare Vos reminds me of saison-style ales in its texture and off-dry finish."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle poured into a chalice. Pours a bright amber color with an impressive white head that leaves a lot of lacing around the sides of the glass. The aroma is fruity with some spices and a hint of citrus. The taste features a subtle tartness with dark fruits, spices galore and a nice dry finish with some hops. Overall, this is one of the best American attempts at a Belgian Ale that I have every tried. Highly Recommended. By the way, this brew is bargain priced at under $5."
"Served from a 750ml into a large tulip glass, pours a light amber with great clarity and a pillow of head. Aromas are sweet, floral, yeasty. Notes of spice at first, mellowing to carmel and honey on the finish. Backround flavors are somewhat lost or at least difficult to distinguish through the carbonation. Very crisp, almost sharp. May be quite refreshing on a hot summer day."
"I could see a lot of people liking this brew. Might even be able to get some people to start trying something besides BMC with this beer. Give a bottle of Rare Vos to some unenlightened friends, you never know..."
"Deep amber color, good foam head with staying power. Good aroma, some fruity hints, some malt, nothing overpowering but a good bouquet. Superior taste. Excellent body. Not too heavy(another drawback of a Belgian), hence my 4.5 drinkability. It is on the pricey side, but still less expensive than a true Belgian."
"Had a bottle with seafood enchiladas at The Mission Restaurant in Syracuse, a great pairing. Rare Vos reminds me a bit of an amber Duvel, though not quite as the complex. The malts are sweet and mild with an apple, cherry, and berry taste. Very drinkable and tasty, but it might be overpriced if you're a budget beer shopper or think Rogue is too expensive."
"Pours an orange amber color with a dense, smooth head. Smells of oranges, prunes, and candi sugar. The taste is fruity up front but quickly overtaken by an assertive malt. The finish is oaky with a lot of tannins and an odd bitterness. Not bad, but not what I expected. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, nicely carbonated though. The drinkability isn't bad, as your tastebuds warm to it. The finish is pleasant and just dry enough to urge another sip. I like it, but not as much as I remember from a couple of years ago. Not sure if its changed, I have, or we both have. I'll have to give this another go to figure it out, I think."
"Pours an orangey amber with a head that maintains shape but is a bit small. Leaves some wisps of lace. Smells of toasty malts with some fruity yeast and apples. Flavor is a great mix of apples, pears, caramel, passion fruit, toasted malts, a subdued yeast spiciness, tea-like hops, and a bit of worty sweetness. Mouthfeel is moderate with some carbonated zing. Delicious Belgian style amber. Highly drinkable."
"Overall: This may not be an example of what usually comes to mind when I think of a Belgian style ale, but that is probably because I have come to expect hugely alcoholic brews. This is a really nice beer, which I think will go well with grilled meats or, I would imagine, anything with a cream sauce."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Chimay glass. Coppery-brown color, murky with a slight white head. Malty, peppery aroma. Flavor is rather dry, sweet and spicy, not as complex as some of the Belgians I've had but still rather tasty. Mouthfeel leaves a little bit of a film sensation in the mouth, otherwise it goes down quite smoothly. A great bargain compared to some of the Belgian imports."
"Poured into a snifter pours a amber color with a fluffy foamy head that stays the entire drink and leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is of ripe fruits, grapes and sweet malt. Taste starts out a bit fruity with hints of roasted malt, goes down with a bready finish. I enjoyed sipping this in the afternoon very good and would drink again."
"D: Overall, nothing to keep you really coming back. It's possible to have a few of these in a row, but you'd likely still be searching for flavor."
"I quite enjoyed this beer. Nice taste, easy to drink, etc. I think this would appeal to a variety of people. And it probably would go well with a number of different foods as well."
"Overall: I previously thought that the Ommegang brewery could do no wrong. And I still belive this, but the category BA gives this beer is misleading. I suppose it's given this category because there is no Belgian Amber Ale listed as a style. I would drink this again, but only if sharing with friends so I could see how they feel as well. It's a good Belgian style, but not my favourite."
"This is a nice light beer. the label says that this can be aged, but I'm not so sure about that."
"Drinkability not ranked as high as others. I'd much rather be drinking Three Philosopher's or Hennepin."
"D: Does not entertain the 'buds. Rather average. I looked at some notes I'd taken on this beer about a year ago and I said pretty much the same things. To me, nothing to write home about."
"This is still one of my favorites. I need to get back in the habit of buying this often. A great beer for a great price."
"I could polish off this 750 bottle with little difficulty. A very nice brew overall. The best Belgian style Amber I have had to date."
"This aint bad, I dont think its the freshest it could be but thats my fault.It is very subtle though and would be good for getting a person into belgian beers.Its not overpowering in any sort,this would be a great summer beer.Nice beer."
"Overall, very good. A bit bitter for a traditional Belgian, but that fits my taste profile very well."
"Very nice pour- thick head with reat belgian lace. Spiciness is very evident- cloves, buttery cinnamon bread, huge yeast presence. Nice chewy mouthfeel with great flavor. Fruity, spicy yeasts all belgian all the time. Alcohol creeps up like a boozy wine, as the phenolic notes carry on to the aftertaste. Its great to know that american brewers can duplicate the style so true to form. Carbonation lifts the mouthfeel to lighter levels making it very smooth going down."
"Thick and bubbly, but has a relatively clean finish, considering its thickness. Coats the tongue. It's a delicious, formidable beer. Tastes great but is maybe too heavy for all-night drinking."
"1 pint bottle - I finally broke down and busted out the wallet to buy this beer. Then I almost dented my ceiling when I failed to properly finesse the cork out of the bottle. Oops. The pour was beautiful ... big poofy, cumulus white head, textbook lacing. Orange-amber body. Only a slight fruity aroma penetrated my olefactory senses, but the flavor is dynamite ... warming, yeast, orange rind, light spice. This is a quality Belgian-style ale that delivers all the prototypical characters without being overpowering. Worth the money. (#2642 - 1/7/07)"
"Drinkability: Very smooth, and a fairly competitive price. I think I would buy the other flavors over this one. The alcohol is hidden quite nicely."
"Follow the directions on the bottle and pour out very slowly. You will be pleasantly surprised at the thick, everlasting white head that forms on the top of the brew. Once you've sampled the rich, crisp, hoppy smell however you may kick yourself if you pour too quick. The head won't go anywhere on this slightly ruddy, amber brew. So pour with care and you can enjoy it right away. Start is malty smooth with a slightly sweet note. Settles full-bodied with a variety of flavors. Caramel, wheat, and a near-hidden fruitiness are the most distinct flavors i can detect. Finishes with a hop bitter edge and a long-lasting but not altogether unpleasant aftertaste. In fact, I dare say for those who like amber beers this is an ideal bottle. Especially when it's as fresh as the ones I picked up today. It has superlative character, flavor, and blend. Rare Vos is without a doubt the ""sly fox"" of full-bodied ales. In fact, I think I may have found a new favorite beer. Well, that's a tough call, but I am certain it is my favorite when it comes to non-vintage micro- or macrobrews. I only wish I could get a four-pack of this stuff in Texas instead of making the trek into the far north! Give it a try and I know you won't be disappointed."
"Danny brought this to me witha thick, tawny head with decent retention. The color was a slightly hazy medium-amber. The nose had a distinctive yeast-driven mustiness. The mouthfeel was thick, full, and very effervescent. The taste was fruity (like Juicyfruit gum), musty, and with a tang of spiciness. The finish was very dry with the mustiness leaving a dusty feeling on the back of my throat. Yow!"
"if not a bit mild mannered"
"A respectable Belgian Amber. I think I will stick with the Ommegang Abbey Ale if given the choice."
"got this in a 25.4 oz cork bottle for around 4 bucks. the smell is the best part, very fruit with a slight hop scent and a strong yeast scent, taste fruity as well almost like a hard cider, not something I'm a big fan of, but something thats interesting and an occasional pick up at the beer store"
"Poured a hazy copper color with a nice tan head, that settled fairly quick for a Belgian, not much in the lacing department. The smell is of light malt, light Belgian yeast. The beer is pretty well balanced, you can taste the malt and Belgian yeast/spice up front, little sweet, and it ends with a touch of hops. This beer is well carbonated but not too much where it limits its drinkability. This is a very nice beer. If I am ever up visiting the baseball hall of fame, I am definitely checking out this brewery."
"Drinkability: Odd, drinkability is good but the beer is not what I was expecting, at all."
"Ommegang brews a damn good Ameri-Belgian!"
"Overall: Ommegang continues to prove a reliable domestic Belgian brewery. Not what Id call a Strong Dark but a sold Belgian Ale nonetheless. I strongly recommend any of their offerings. One final point: I picked this one up for 5.99, which is a heck of a lot of bang for the buck."
"Nice looking bottle, packaged like a champagne bottle. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy yellow-amber color with a frothy foamy head. Smell is mostly of amber malt, a slight hop profile and very slight tinge of alcohol; perhaps some small amount of spice. Taste is initially sweet of the amber malt, a slight metallic taste, followed by a hoppy, sort of dry finish. Mouthfeel is thick with carbonation, but the beer is rather light and goes down very smooth. Overall, this is definitely a drinkable beer and worth trying."
"Overall a bit too big and strong of a Belgian Pale for regular drinking, but a nice beer."
"750ml bottle, poured into a snifter. The beer has a gorgeous amber color with a frothy white head. This has a great taste of fruits, and is especially vibrant with a hint of orange. This went down smooth, and is very drinkable. I wish I had eaten something with this as it would go well with some of my meat dishes."
"Extremely smooth and drinkable. Very nice offering that I will certainly will have again. I recommend giving this one a try. It is certainly worth it. I may have to cellar a few bottles for a while and taste the difference. Overall a great brew with a lot of taste and provides to be quite an enjoyable Belgium style beer."
"A great interpretation, and a great bang for the buck as well. Would drink it again (meal or no meal) again in an instant. Highly recommended."
"Frothy, long lasting head tops a deep amber, slightly yeasty appearance. The aromas was full of soft esters; cloves, citrus, and sweet malts was quite inviting. This ale is a smooth, complex, well balanced assortment of cloves, ginger, and lemons which compliment a soft maltiness. A nice peppery earthiness was detected through out. For such a complex brew, the finish is surprisingly dry and spritzy, with just some phenols lingering in the aftertaste. This has got to be one of the finest ales I've drank. Tonight is St Nicholas Eve. A very nice ale to compliment my wife's spicey German christmas cookies. A real steal for 3.99 for a 25 oz bottle."
"Well worth a try though."
"A very good ale, another excellent job from Ommegang."
"This is a very nice ""sipping"" brew. A very nice interpretation of a Belgian. Serves well as an apperitif or as a complement to a creamy Belgian or French cheese plate."
"Drinkability/notes: A quite drinkable example of the style, seems quite authentic when compared to Belgian-brewed examples."
"The aftertaste is a bit too bitter and heavy for myself, though the ale is still very drinkable."
" Wavz"
"750ml. Poured with a cream white head with large bubbles. Non-clear golden yellow with lots of suspended yeast. Yeast totally non-flocculating, so even a careful pour would have left 1/2 the bottle behind if I didnt take some yeast. Aroma was typical Ommegang, sour and spicy with vapors of peach and cherry. Palate was less sour than aroma and about 1/2 way between Duvel and Ommegang Ommegang. The ""fine dose of yeast"" did cause massive rumbling in my plumbing later that night though."
"This is a full flavored beer which I enjoyed very much, I would recommend it to all."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable Belgian Ale. Nice and fresh , not to heavy or strong. Exellent taste! Tried this with mussels recently ...Nice!"
"Great beer by Ommegang!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with no date, although I'm sure it can be cellared for years to come. Pours a beautiful clear copper with a rocky white head. Excellent retention. Smells of spices, hints of the yeast, and toasted malt. Very nice - kinda earthy. Taste reflects much of the same. A real yeasty, malty character to it, with hints of citrus. Travels well. Touch of bitter hops at the end. Flavors of the alcohol, too, but not overwhelming. Nice mouthfeel, although it could be a little thicker, I think. Overall, very good; glad I got a four pack of this."
"Recommended anytime."
"D- Just strong enough to enjoy and relax on a late night. Great for enjoying with a friend or girlfriend/wife after a long day at work."
"D - Very good. Not nearly as spicy as some Belgian-style ales but still quite good."
"I poured a hazy brown, with no head. Immediately I could smell corriander and bananna. The mouthfeel was flat, no carbonation whatsoever. The taste was sour. I think I must have gotten a bad batch of this stuff, as my experience of it is not consistent with other reviews. Either that, or I'm just not a fan of this style."
"A great beer with food or have just one. Great effort, how do they sour this thing?? Funny the other reviews don't mention sour? Bottle conditioned? Did something get growing in here??"
"This is a very tasty and drinkable complex brew. Would make for a great all night savouring session brew, and while deep and complex is also an approachable beer and as such would make good crossover fare. I will be drinking this one again."
"Poured a burnt orange color with amber highlights. A nice fluffy white head appeared initially, but disappeared quickly. The smell is very sweet, with Belgian yeast, spice, and estery smells leading the way. Taste is similar, with the addition of some fruitier flavors such as banana and citric acid. A peppery flavor lingers towards the end of a taste, much like la Maudite. The aftertaste is dry and slick, as the sweetness of the yeast, malts, and fruits are offset rather aggressively (for the style) by hops. There is a lot of nice flavor here, and this is the first corked Belgian style ale I have had that isn't intimidatingly high in alcohol. This bomber will do me just fine. This is an interesting, exciting, and very drinkable take. In my parts, this is going for almost $9/bottle, rather than the $6ish it should be going for, so it is difficult to choose this over comparably priced Chimay. Still though, another stellar effort from Ommegang."
"A ""feel good factor"" beer, for sure."
"D: This is one of my favorite go-to session beers. It's huge on flavor and at 6.5% abv, it's something I can drink a few of. Terrific beer."
"The beer is crystal clear after decanting ""according to directions"" and has a light copper color with a decent white head. The aroma is kind of sparse, it has a little bit of malt and a little bit of fruity ester kind of like passionflower but overall its kind of light. The flavor is good, not really strong or dominating but pretty appropriate for style. Overall this is a good drinkin' beer, not your usual Belgian rocket fuel but good. I confess I'd like a little more distinctive aromas though."
"Poured a clear amber-orange color with massive puffy white head. Smell is a tantalizing mixture of sweet fruit with some background spiciness. Taste foloows through on the smell with the spiciness becoming more prominent, but not overshadowing the sweet fruitiness. Some yeastiness also to be found. Nice full creamy finish with the sweet spices really showing through. Great drinkability. I paired this with grilled shrimp and scallops for an excellent meal."
"D- IMO not a session beer, well brewed beer though. Only complaint is that at times carbonation kinda blanded out flavor. I will be back to this though."
"D :: An easy drinking, huge-bodied belgian style without a ridicoulous alcohol content? Bring this one on!!"
"This a beer that may be better without food than with. Enjoy a glass before or after dinner."
"Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Another winner from Ommegang. Of all their beers, this is probably my least favorite, but that's like saying that Shelby's first mustang was the least impressive of his modified race cars. The light sweet flavors and the refreshing finish carry this beer well, masking the booze and upping the general drinkability. Fantastic."
"D: The yeastie byproducts (spicy phenolics) are a little much for me. I couldn't quite finish the 750 mL in one sitting."
"This is an exceptional beer visually, and in flavor. Buy it!"
"Overall a superior Belgian pale ale. I'm not a big fan of the style - but Ommegang nails this one dead on."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a Duvel tulip with a hazy amber-orange body and a massive rocky and creamy ecru foam cap with super sticky lacing. Yeasty sourdough bread aromas with anise and bergamot and a ""warm"" and sweet barnyard funk scent -- not like a lambic, just earthy, I guess. Bready anise inflected sweetness is finished off by a round of tannic and earthy bitter hops. Full, creamy mouthfeel, but medium bodied. Some yeasty sourness is apparent in the middle of the sip. Ommegang's second most drinkable/approachable beer. Great stuff as always."
"This beer poured from the tap, had a great appearance. It gave a nice amber/copper color, with a beautiful head that stuck to the end, with excellent lacing. It gave a nice spicy and orange smell, same flavors found in the taste. Mouthfeel was full and frothy. Excellent beer!"
" It's hard to believe this beer is 6.50% ABV, since I can really taste the alcohol in this during each sip and after each swallow. The spices never overpower here and this is exceptionally balanced both in taste and mouthfeel. The aroma is very subdued and a bit lacking here, but all other aspects of this beer are enjoyable. Ommegang does a great job of bringing belgian styles and tastes to the states, and this offering is great proof of that!"
"Had to check myself after two. Very enjoyable brew."
"D - Goes down smooth and satisfying....someone should refill my chalice."
"Drinkability - this is good, but drying effect hinders sessionability, at least on a regular basis."
"This is a really drinkable beer. Ommegang brews are high quality, low cost beers so pick some up."
"Very nice beer overall. An intriguing mix of flavors, and a great idea by Ommegang to brew a Belgian amber ale. A good starting point for those who want to get into Belgian-style beers. Recommended."
"Big cork-n-cage bottle with no freshness date. Very loud ""POP!"" when opening, and the pour reveals a hazed copper body with a frothy, two finger tan head that becomes creamier as the many beads of carbonation replace the larger bubbles with very small ones, and leave a nice trail of lacing as I drink. The aroma is very phenolic right off the bat, with spicy yeast and a lemony zest combined with nutty malts, green/leafy/spicy hops, and notes of pear, apple, and melon. The taste is the same but adds cloves, medicine, banana, and a phenolic bitterness that eventually gives way to a hoppy bitterness, all on top of a body that starts prickly, but evens out to reveal a medium body that is quite smooth. A great deal at $5 a bottle."
"Drinkability - great beer! could easily have a lot in an evening and enjoy it."
"Overall, not bad, but not terribly memorable. With some of the more challenging and wonderful offerings from Ommegang, I'll probably pass this one by in the future."
"the weakest offfering from this brewery in my opinion"
"The body is decent. Very refreshing. I would drink alot of this if it were available in Iowa. Can't beat the price for a great 750mL. I'm looking forward to the Witte."
"This belgian pale ale pours a nice cloudy golden color, with a good white foamy head. The smell was not pleasant, a first I thought of regurgitate, then skunked came to mind (if subsequent samplings prove this smell an anomaly, I will come back and re-review). The taste is nice, with a fruity flavoring. The mouthfell is plesant. I good beer which I look forward to enjoying again. And hopefully the smell will be better next time."
"Ommegang Rare Vos pours a medium copper color with a thick off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. This bottle was brewed in Cooperstown. The smell is predominately malty with a touch of fruitiness. The taste has that typical Belgium character, it's fairly light and a bit fruity too. This is quite a good take on the style. Recommended."
"d - very drinkable, this one will become a regular for me - it's my first Ommegang offering, and I hope the rest are this good"
"Overall: More eye candy than anything else."
"Poured a rich brown with purple/red highlights leaving an off white head that is sticky. The aroma is yeasty, figs, plums, honey, cloves, and ginger spices. The feel starts off highly carbonated, moves to a strong bitter bite of grapefruit that is complimented by some fruit sweetness that finishes slightly harsh on the palate."
"Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel and plenty of carbonation. Alcohol is not really noticeable until afterward, easy to drink. Went well with shrimp scampi and should work well with most foods. A good buy."
"Pours a hazy orange with a huge head and active carbonation, banana undertones and a crisp fruity prescence punctuated with controlled alcohol scents and some grain pulls through as well. Full taste, carbonation sits in as you drink it all the way down, fully flavored but not too heavy. A fantastic beer, stunning in quality for the price."
"Pours a cloudy golden hazy, and its interesting to watch the carbination rush to the top. Powerful yeast flavor, with banana undertones. I was surprised to detect some hops. Mildly dry finish, unless its just my current palate influencing it. Overall, a very nice beer."
"This is my first beer from Ommegang, and I am impressed. Looking forward to trying some other offerings."
"The smell is pleasant, with hints of candy and citrus on top of malt. The taste brings light fruit, malt, and good yeast flavors all the way through. The mouthfeel is full while drinkability is very good."
"Drinkable as any of this fine brewerys beers. Just a wonderful example of the style. Its miraculous that this is made in the states."
"A nice dry, mellowed-out Belgian ale. I could probably make a session out of it..."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with a good tanish head. The aroma was a nice bouquet of sweet malts. Very enjoyable. The taste is a pleasant hit of malty goodness with a bit of hops but not overpowering. There are also some spices in this one that work well. This medium bodied beer is very pleasant and drinkable in my opinion."
"Awesome Belgium style brew from NY."
"what the hell is a belgian amber? well, ok, this is from ommegang so ill give it a try. amber color and a bit cloudy. smells like any other belgium. sour tinges, nice and smooth. clove, malt flavors. very tasty beer. not too hard hitting like some other big bad belgians. quite impressed."
"If anyone knows of Belgians that are similar to this, feel free to beermail me the good news. You may convert me yet."
"Overall- This was so weak I could not believe. My wife drank a bottle and couldn't believe the lack of flavor, more like the watered down flavor. Thumbs down until Ommegang bumps the flavor in this 1!"
"Flavor: first a sourness like lime, a berry note thoughout, theres grains and a slite bite in the end. Carbonation is apparent. It's very well drinkable."
"This Belgian ale poured out a dark golden amber with a good size hrad.The aromas were of hops,malt and citrus,also in the taste.The beer also was yeatsy and rich and all in all a pretty good offering from Ommegang,although I do not believe it's there best."
"During a recent tour of the brewery I saw that they add some flavors to this near the end of boil. I don't remember which ones (I think coriander is used for the Hennepin, and anise for the Ommegang, but there was also ""seeds of paradise"" or something peppery)."
"Mouthfeel is very light, very clean. Well done for a Yankee micro, would stand up well to any native Belgian pale. I could definitely session a few of these."
"Opinion: Well, this beer has some serious age on it, so it obviously isn't in its prime. The flavor is still really complex, and I would really like to try a really fresh example. I will be trying this beer again for sure."
"Bought this and Hennepin recently; I prefer this one. It is an amber color with a small white head that remains present. A small amount of lacing. It has a sweet malty odor to it, mostly sweet. There is a very nice fruity taste with some spice and a little hoppiness. It feels very good in the mouth, not too carbonated. A very good beer, quite drinkable."
"This is my first ever public review, I felt compelled on this one, so that must mean something."
"Poured into a Moinette goblet from a 750 ml bottle as a lively orange color with golden accents. Big, rocky head of a cream color. Fantastic retention and much lacing in the inner rim of the goblet. Nose is lively with citrus, spices, white grapes, and fruit salad! Taste profile is pleasingly light, yet very complex and exciting. Citrus offers a lively play on the tongue, encouraged in its performance by a worthy hop presence. Best described as a refreshing taste, leaning toward hops and citrus fruity lightness, with some expression of yeast to add complexity. Alcohol is not assertive. Light-bodies and lively, this is a great beer. Immenently drinkable and ""user-friendly."" Recommended!"
"This is the first belgian style I've had from the proper glasswear and it is making a huge differance. I could sit and enjoy one of these every night. What a wonderful pleasant experience. I can't wait to revisit some of the other belgians i've had to see if it's the glass or the beer or maybe a little of each."
"Verdict- An above-average, well-rounded beer."
"Not particularly drinkable, I found it hard to consume this 750mL bottle which is strange considering the amazing Hennepin and Ommegang. Interestingly, my wife liked it much more than either of those two options."
"A combination of belgian golden ales and american ambers. Incredibly drinkable and endlessly enjoyable."
"This is a great drinking beer. Its flavors are subtle and don't hit you over the head."
"Overall: A good one, but not a great one, probably my least favorite of Ommegang's brews."
"[see other review for more cohesion]"
"Pours a deep transparent amber with big foamy off-white head and huge lace. Subtle toasted grain, flowery hops, and candy sweetness in the nose. Medium-light and strongly carbonated mouth feel. Yeasty and slightly biscuit-like in initial flavor. Grows into big fruitiness before balancing into a drier lingering bitterness that is slightly medicinal. Flavor slightly more subdued than I would like. Remains a drinkable and well-balanced amber ale."
"Poured for me at a Belgian style cafe from a corked 750 ml bottle . Dark orange color in the low light available to me at the bar. Fruity esters hitting my nose as I take a sniff from my goblet. Thin lacing down the side of the glass. Taste is also a nice fruity, sweet/sour on the tongue with a bit of an oakey aftertaste. My fiance and I had no problem finishing it off with pleasure."
" Unfortunately, whle not a bad beer, this is a little disappointing. For a Ommegang this is a boring beer."
"This beer is very easy to drink--a little too easy to drink. The light mouthfeel lulls you into thinking this could be a session beer. At 6.5 % abv, this could be a slight miscalculation. What a nice beer."
"On the whole this is a very sippable and drinkable beer from Ommegang. It is the one of the big four that could easily be enjoyed all day without much of a problem."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is meduim plus bodied. Very well balanced sweetness to spicyness. Just another dam fine beer from Ommegang."
"Another great selection from Ommegang, the 2005 akorsak Brewery of the Year."
"I love belgian beer and some state side copy cats, this effort wasn't really up to my expectations, but close"
"Pours a cloudy orange, medium thick white head forms, lots of lace. Smell is malty, some citrus/floral hoppage, yeast, some orange and a little bit of spice. Taste is more of the same, malty, with some chocolate, orange, spice and a little citrus. Mouthfeel is very smooth, its been aging for a while, with medium body and medium carbonation. The taste was not so complex, maybe because its been cellaring since february, not sure if it would help or hinder this beer."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a moderate head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very fruity with some spices - smells promising. The flavor is much the same with the orange and the spices, but there is another fruit flavor in there that I don't think mixes well with the others. Just doesn't hit the palate well. The mouthfeel is on the low end of moderate and the drinkability is ok. I just don't care much for the flavor of this one."
"Very ncie beer."
"First time I tried this offering from Ommegang, kinda is rare in these parts, usually I find Hennepin. Pours a hazy gold color, smell is of fruit, taste is of malt, sharp fruit but not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner from what I expect from these guys, but overall it is pretty good. I'll probably stick with Hennepin though since it's my fave from Ommegang."
"The body is in the medium range. The texture is really nice with the sweet to bready glow. The alcohol is smooth and light. Overall this is a dessert deer but nice to share with another person."
"as advertised, it is mellow....as in the taste isn't too strong. it's certainly a high quality pale ale. veeerrry smooth. very drinkable. the taste is unremakrable though....not bland...but not awesome. definately worth a try. woould probably go great with a meal, b/c the taste isn't overpowering."
"Drinkability: This made for a nice affordable Belgian style Ale from Ommegang. I wouldn't expect anything less from them. This made for another winner from Ommegang."
"Very round; soft and big. Quite refreshing for an ale with such a malt profile."
"My favorite of the excellent offerings from the Ommegang crew. If only there were more Belgian-style ales of this caliber produced domestically. . ."
"Enjoyable and drinkable. Another winner from Ommegang and one I'll drink again often."
"A flavorful and refreshingly crisp take on the style. Nothing flashy, but impressively well-rounded. I imagine that this could make for a rather nice session ale."
"A dark honey color with a huge head,pour slowly people!!!.The smell is not very strong.There are some hops with spices and a little floral.The taste is a bit hoppy and grainy.There is a large abundance of wheat flavoring,as well as carbonation.The after taste is sweet,I can see having this with fruit or dessert.This is a nice full flavored beer that I will buy when I see it again.Ommegang is top notch."
"To sweet for this hophead."
"Drinkability: Very delicious and refined, I wish more brewers perfected their craft the way Ommegang has."
"Drinkability is excellent this is one of the smoothest beers I can remember, taste is great and the alcohol isnt on the high end of the spectrum. All these things make this a highly drinkable beer; its too bad its retired. Im heading to the beer store to stock up on whatever they still have on the shelves."
"Appears rather cloudy with a yellowish-brown color and mighty head. I smell roasted malts with hints of various spices; very intriguing. I first taste the fruit bitterness that are usually associated with Pale Ales, but it soon follows with a distinct sweetness. As the brew warms, the sweet character develops and begins to dominate the beer. As a result, I found each sip to be unique and enjoyable. The alcohol content was also very subtle, never overpowering or dominating. Very complex. An excellent beer, but I don't think I can have several of these at one time because the texture is a bit more rough with the spices."
"D: For the price, the value and drinkability of all of Ommegang's beers is very high. However, the rough carbonation and unique flavor makes me not want to have this one regularly."
"Edit: on second tasting, fruitier notes of peach and apricot are descernable along with herbal hops and none of the skunk. Understated and pleasant."
"This easy drinking beer is very tasty and well balanced. The soft carbonation brings out all the flavor. It also hides it's 6.5% alcohol very well."
"Great looking beer. Copper orange, hazy, with a big head. Notes of orange, spice, and some barn yard smells. Fairly uneventful drink. The orange/citrus and spice hit again, but nothing that is worth talking about. Very drying. Wish Id picked the Hennepin."
"Drinkability is high and I recommend trying this one."
"WOW. Amazing. This poured a beautiful hazy orange caramelly color with a nice white head and a good amount of carbonation. Good lacing. The smell is malty and sweet. Clove is noticeable in the smell and fairly dominant in the taste also. A really complexy sweet fruity taste here. To me this brew tastes mor liek a combination of their witbier and a really interesting amber beer. The spices they use probably lead to that. The mouthfeel is pleasant, moderate and stickey. This brew is insanely drinkable, you can't get enough of it."
"This is easily to drink. Good to toast with, bubbly and bright. A recent favorite and absolute pleasure to review!"
"I like it, and will probably have another in the future."
"The taste is greatly refreshing. I could fancy this thing at any time of the day. Light and crisp. Great sour fruity finish with a nice spice complement. So juicy and wet to the palate. This brew is light and complex at the same time. Drinkable as all get out. You get a nice bubbly mouth with some light fruit flavors and a spicy finish that basks in sourness. These are some pleasant bottles of beer. Quite bedazzling on a hot summer night. I am in dig of this."
"overall: an excellent belgian style ale. every category is near perfect. i'm surprised this is averaging a mere 4 in ratings. a must try."
"Orange color with a small head. Definitely a fruity yeast aroma with some cinnamon and spice mixed in. A touch of sweetness can be detected upon tasting but the real killer for me here was the carbonation. Way too carbonated to make this something you can drink all night long. It tickled the inside of my mouth and hurt the drinkability. Not a bad beer overall, but something that could benefit from being less caronated and more well-rounded and balanced."
"tangerine flavor and color. you can even feel the carbonatinon on your lips and in your throat on the way down...tooo much but ok."
"While Rare Vos never recognizes any of the styles that are generally given to Belgian Ales, it simply does its artistry with benevolence, grace, and artistry- just as true Belgian brewers would have it!"
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a Unibroue glass. Pours a dark copper with some floaties and two fingers of cream-colored head. Good retention and lacing as well. Smell is a strong green apple and citrus fruitiness with a nice clove spiciness and some yeastiness. Taste starts out with a sugary sweet maltiness but then hits you with plesantly sour cherry/green apple flavor. Finish is just a little spicy and very crisp. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is a little on the low side. This is a really well-balanced easy drinking Belgian ale--unlike a lot of others with more complexityI could see myself drinking this as a session beer."
"Drinkability- Wasn't expecting the flavor I got. Still tasting it in my mouth. Interesting and enjoyable. May not be for everyone though."
"I would have this again, a very solid Belgian even though made in America."
"I still prefer Ommegang Abbey and Hennepin but next time I see this on a shelf in a store I won't hesitate in picking one up."
"It is light and easily drinkable with some great Belgian characteristics. I am glad I have two more in the closet! This is the first Ommegang beer I have had and I am very impressed by it."
"Pours a hazy light copper color with a little-moderate head. The smell is pleasant and floral (although pretty weak). Taste is great and well rounded: the first taste is of refreshing wheat, the next has a green apple taste to it, and it concludes with a sour malt taste. Overall it is a very agreeable beer, very easy to drink, so be sure to buy a couple bottles!"
"Mouthfeel is bubbly, and smooth. Very drinkable- as are all Ommegang brews. This is the first time I've had this one, and I really enjoyed it. Tasty, refreshing, lovely."
"To date, this is my least favorite beer from Ommegang. 2 out of 3 ain't bad!"
"Appears cloudy and golden amber, with extreme effervescence. Head is frothy and rocky, white in hue with a foamy surface. Pale malts lend a little breadiness to the aroma, which is well complimented by ripe bananas, a little citrous, and some grassiness and spice. Malts are thick and extreme in their breadiness. Citrous is cleanly bittering with lemons and bitter orange peel. A little graininess is there, and also some grass. Coriander, as well as other spices are present (a little clove?). Subtle fruit sweetness, considerably less than the nose would suggest. Mouthfeel is very full, but broken up by tons of carbonation. We damn near broke a light popping the cork out of this bad boy! Alcohol is barely noticeable, just slightly warming. Finish is dry and clean. I am really enjoying this offering from Ommegang."
"I never seem to be in the mood for a Belgian, but I always love them when I have them. I haven't quite figured that out yet. This is another great brew from Ommegang. This and the Hennepin are my two favorite from them. Beautiful light amber body and a white head that stays the entire glass. Nice spicy and fruity aroma, and a spicy hop taste make this very refreshing. There seems to be a hint of lime as well that really hits the spot. Finishes slightly dry, with a bit of solventy alcohol, but it all works."
"This is a nice beer to quaff, but it doesn't impress me the way Hennepin did. If it were a little bit cheaper, I'd go for it more often, but at the only place I know of them being sold (35 miles away), they are the same price, so I will probably go for more bottles of Hennepin next time I'm there."
"750 ml bottle - cellared for roughly a year. Carefully poured from a long-standing, chilled bottle it's a perfectly clear orange amber beneath a big-bubbled head of white foam that holds splendidly and leaves some thin splatters of lace about the glass. The nose is lightly fruity (apricot, lemon rind, orange), a touch cork-like or musty, and subtly spicy. In the mouth it's light-medium bodied and zesty on the tongue due to its effervescent carbonation. The flavor is exactly as the nose suggets it might be with a bit more sweet malt, a touch more fruit, a sprinkling of delicate floral hops, and alot of peppery spice! It's well-balanced, but it relies more on its thin maltiness and peppery yeast to do that than it does hop bitterness. It finishes dry and refreshing with a quick passing of fruitiness followed by some lingering chalky dryness. The yeast pour brings out a little more character and lends the body a touch of girth; and I prefer it that way. Additionally, I don't feel that this beer really gains anything from cellaring other than to drop some of the yeast out of suspension (a rough, fresh bottle can be a bit much). Overall, as a Belgian-style pale ale, this is right on the mark! Love it or leave it!"
"750 ml corked bottle. Hazy apricot color with a large white head. The aroma is yeasty. There is also fruit, mainly oranges and strawberries, in the nose. Very spicy smelling. The flavor starts out sweet and fruity. This is clearly a bottled conditioned beer. I find the finish too bitter. It's not bitter like hops, but more like orange peels. While this detracts from the flavor a bit, the flavor is still very nice. A nice beer from Ommegang, but not their best."
"Comments - Let this beer warm up a few minutes, at least, before drinking it. The flavor and smell don't seem to match up for some reason, but the beer is still enjoyable. This beer is pretty complex. I'd say it is worth a try."
"Pours a rich and shiny amber in color with a thick head and lots of layered lace. Aroma is all lemon, sugars and spices. Mouthfeel is very light and pleasant. Went well with my salmon, lemon, taragon and pepper grilling concoction. Very drinkable, I had to pace myself or I was gonna finish before I was done eating. Flavor is at first sweet malts and sugars, but balanced nicely with smoothj hops and the yeast provides great antecedent flavors to the beer."
"Very nice and easily quaffed brew. This is a very good beer and hard to identify any major flaws."
"The beer after its release from the 750ml cork and wired brown bottle sets in the glass a luminous copper color with a portly creamy light tan head that after decomposing leaves a thick and clinging sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is nicely malted with light hints of spice and plums. The start is lightly sweet and the grain profile adequate, the top is moderate in feel. Finishing is punishing in its acidity, the hop delightful in their spicy bite, very dry after taste that lingers long, a good beer, but I sample only rarely."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy amber color ale with a huge white foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of floral malt, sweet hops with some subtle spices and a touch of Belgian-type yeast. Taste is a nice mix between some floral sweet malt and discreet yeast with some spices. Body is just above average but carbonation is a bit low for a Belgian Ale."
"Slàinte!"
"Just another of a long line of solid, very good beers from Brewery Ommegang. While not my favorite, perhaps, the sweet/sour combination makes the beer interesting and drinkable. The earthy notes and spicy character make it refreshing, and while not amazing, the final impression was one of satisfaction and contentment. I don;t know how much more you can ask for than that."
"This is a great beer. Deceivingly easy to drink as the alchohol stays disguised in the tastiness of this beer."
"Mouthfeel wasn't that impressive, only a little better than average... drinkability wasn't that great. Overall, I thought it was OK, but I wouldn't have another one on my own."
"The drinkability- considering the easygoing flavours and mouthfeel, I rank quite high. the only limitation is that the alcohol goes unnoticed while drinking it but not in the body. that's why I don't give it a 5 there."
"At the end of the glass, I didn't want another one and am hoping that I won't be quite so disappointed with the bottle of Ommegang that I've had hanging around."
"Proper temperature and proper glassware are vital for this beer. A very good beer."
"This poured a hazy copper, big frothy head, that left puffs of lacing all the way down, smell was of raisins and fruit, taste was light fruity and tangy, mouthfeel is light and slightly tart, and highly carbonated, drinkability is fantastic, just another fine product from Ommegang. I will revisit this one."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium coper color with a great 2 finger head and equally nice lace. Smells of sweet dried fruit (cherries, raisins, plums) with a bit of spicyness mixed in. Taste is similar to smells but with an almost immediate hop spicyness, not overpowering but just enough. Finishes with a definate alcohol taste. Also noted some caramel and even a slight roastiness. A nice Belgiun Pale and a deal at $5."
"I am surprised by the fact that this brewery is American. I could have sworn this beer came straight from Belgium. An excellent brew."
"Nice full, but not too full mouthfeel. There's lots of carb but it doesn't numb the tongue. Despite one flaw, this is a most drinkable beer. The 6.5abv helps that too."
"First taste provided a spicy, tongue-stinging that led to a mildly bitter finish. Taste is chock full o' Belgian funkiness. If you gulp enough air with a swig, it tastes like an attic or basement. Is that good? Not so sure. Some metal in there as well. Sometimes sour, sometimes tangy. No pronounced flavors though. Very subtle in its approach. Mouth is thick with blankets of miniscule bubbles. Definitely an easy drink. Tasty as well."
"What a nice touch of Belgium here in the states, and only $2 a bottle. If you're ever in Cooperstown, take the tour of the brewery. It's fascinating and refereshing..."
"Notes: I am very impressed. This is the most non-American, American brewery I have found. Nice to drink."
"Rather light bodied, with ample, cascading carbonation. Smooth and almost creamy on the palate. Overall, a tasty example of the style, brewed here in the states."
"Another great beer from Ommegang, the true budget beer afficianado's choice at only $3.99 a bottle where I bought it. That's value."
"Paired well with my new favorite cheese, Rembrant aged gouda."
"¾-inch initial cream head, very thick with sticking lace. Light gold hue with a peach skin tint and some active haze. Tart grapefruit nose, with a wet straw yeastiness following up. Lemony tartness, coriander, almost an odd rubbery flavor and a trailing hop bite that cleanses the palate. Tasty, medium to light body that doesnt force itself on you, but rather gently makes its presence known."
"My favorite of the Ommegang line, especially as an accompaniment to food, like home-made very-thin-crust pizza, or maybe asparagus and spicy sausage."
"This was to dry for my taste, the mellowness is too mellow and the complexity it seemingly has just doesn't seem to really peak any where and the dryness flat out takes too much out of it for me. A dry yeast beast masqueraded as a scrumptiously lush looking brew...hmm...Viking brew anyone?"
"This brew is a luminous orange/amber color with a medium off-white head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is lightly spiced and fruity, along with some yeast. Medium-bodied with peach, yeast, wheat and spice flavors. The finish is dry and fruity, with sweet malt peeking through. Pretty solid through and through."
" Notes: Paid $3.99 for this 750, very affordable offering from Ommegang."
"Pours a hazy peachy amber color with a fluffy light tan head. Aromas of musty mild yeast, amber and crystal malts, light fruitiness and spicing. Starts off amberishly sweet (nuances of clover honey), then dries a little from the clovey phenols. Moderately fruity with a faint nuttiness, with a very slight woody tartness in the aftertaste. A little bit on the weak side, yet flavorful. One of the better U.S. brewed Belgian-style beers."
"This one paired nicely with spicy turkey chili."
"Of the 4 new brews I had tonight, this was probably the most dissapointing. This beers flavor was just about the most average tasting ""belgian"" style beer I've had in a long time. The flavors that were there were weak and not interesting. This left a bad aftertaste as well. Maybe I just had a bad bottle, but this was pretty damn rough."
"This beer is quite tasty, and quite well balanced. The interplay between the smooth fruitiness and the sharp spiciness is quite complimenting. This beer is definitely a work of craftsmanship, it is quite well balanced, yet quite flavorful for a beer of this strength. Actually this might be the best beer that Ommegang makes."
"Pleasing and straightforward. I think this is my favorite Ommegang offering."
"I could drink this all day. Even my beer-hating girlfriend liked this one!"
"Amazing mouthfeel. Full of flavor and aroma."
"Overall the beer is very enjoyable and drinkable, one of my favorites. Makes me feel like I'm enjoying it on a summer's night in Brugge, instead of a cold, dreary night in Akron, OH. And for $4.99 that's not bad at all!"
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. The inexpensive price was the best thing about this beer. There are plenty of other BPAs I'd drive across town to get and this is not one of them."
"A bit of a disappointment. I love Ommegang beers, but this one did not impress me. Not that it's bad, but it doesn't hold up to the many, many fine examples of the style. Kind of sour, almost flat. A little darker in color than the usual Belgian pale. The La Fin I followed this with absolutely blew it away (I know, different style, but still....)"
"Greatbrew ! 750ml bottle. Poured a cloudy orange/copper color with a solid white three finger head. The smell is fruity, sweet malts and yeasty. The taste is wonderful. Slight citrous flavor with a bready malt goodness and hint of spice that is hard to beat. Nicely balanced with a hop bite that just noticable enough to be almost perfect. The carbonation and mouthfeel were right on. The drinkability is very good."
"This is the second trial for this beer. The first I thought was bad somehow, but this one confirms that I just dont find this beer particulary nice. Its not bad, really, but its off flavours dont do well to inspire you to obtain more."
"I would imagine that this would be a very diverse beer to pair with different foods. Great drinkability level. Another winner from Ommegang."
"A pretty nice stab at the Belgian style ale from the people at Ommegang. This corked 750ml bottle pours a nice orange bronze color with a touch of haze, but fairly translucent. A nice rocky head rests on top of the beer. Smell is a nice big boquet of mellow fruit scencts, floral hops, and mellow ripe malts. A bit biscuity and buttery as well. Taste is much the same, a nice mellow a sweet taste, with hints of hops and fruits and malts all coming at different times, and a tad yeasty. Very smooth mouthfeel and this is definately and easy beer to put down."
"Compares favorably to a Duvel or Flemish style ale. Pours white, puffy head that thins quickly, leaving nice rings of lace, even in my plastic cup. Color is like a pilsner with a touch more haze. I taste a fine, toasted caramel sweetness, with pleasant nose of coriander, grains of paradise(?), a bit of Curacao orange. Comes in with a slight banana note at the finish. I wish I could've keep this to cellar, but I went a little crazy at the store where I bought this, near our motel. Ended up buying 13 bottles of various micros, and had to trim down to fit in my luggage."
"The drinkability is OK and the after taste is limited with some sweetness."
"The body is buttery and slick. Very full, but not thick."
"This is an amber colored brew that poured a nice head that maintains throughout. Smell is of fruits and belgian yeast. Taste is of caramel malts that finishes with a nice dry hop. Mouthfeel is light but lively. Overall drinkability is near perfect."
"Great bottle for a great beer. Needless to say, I pointed the top away from my face, windows, or my wife upon opening. The head was very full and tight. The lacing was consistent throughout the drink. The nose was rich with plum, citrus, and some alcohol. The beer danced on my tongue as the malt blended well with the clove and citrus flavor. The color was a medium amber. However, the head was more impressive than the color in regards to appearance. The finish was clean. This was one good Belgian!"
"Thanks to wyllder for the sample. Appearance was a bit murky...medium yellow with a decent head. Smell was a pleasant blend of grassy hops and yeast. Taste is very different, but very nice. It was light on the palate early on but burst in a delayed fruity finish. I got a distinct impression of pears. Mouthfeel is very, very smooth. Extremely easy to drink. A brew I would definitely have again."
"Notes: This beer is a great value for 4.99 While the flavors aren't overwhelming in a medium bodied ale, they are certainly unique and the finish definitely will be recognized by your taste buds. However, when the finish hits it is almost like 'what that was it'? Not as complex and hard hitting as I would have hoped..."
"I like Rare Vos marginally more than I liked 'Ommegang squared', but it isn't great beer in my mind. It isn't overly complex and the flavor profile doesn't push my buttons all that hard. I'm still glad that I gave it a try."
"Beer is good. Happy Belgian style American beering."
"Drinkability: It's good, but after one, I'm ready to move on."
"I'll have this again. My wife liked it too so I should stock it."
"This is a nicely complex and refined beer, just needs a bit more 'oomph' to push it to the next level."
"As far as drinkability goes, I'm not too sure if I could drink the whole 750mL bottle, gets a little sour after a bit but overall not too bad for $3.99."
"A cloudy brownish gold colour topped with a medium sized head set this beer up for a first sip. This is a refined beer that doesn't scream Belgian but rather whispers it in the ear. very drinkable and at 6.5% abv, almost sessionable. This is the one true drinking beer from Ommegang where the rest of their lineup is strictly sipping."
"The mouthfeel is excellent too. This is not really my favorite style but I think the rare vos may be one of Ommegang's best. Oh yeah another dangerous one on the drinkabilty- too easy to have more than a couple."
"The color of a red cloud. A biege head came and went quickly, leaving almost nothing. Slightly hazy. Yellow in the thin parts. Nose is very spicy alcohol. Very estery- very tart on the tongue, very dry finish with a lingering tartness. Drinkiability OK, but i would like to try again."
"Overall, it's a moderately drinkable beer. It is free of off-flavors and unpleasantness."
"An excellent offering from Ommegang that I'll run back to the next time I have a chance to buy it..."
"Drinkability: Average. There's better Belgain Pale Ale's out there, but as a domestic brewery that made this, it's quite decent. Worth a try."
"I always passed this beer up, getting the Hennepin or the Three Philosophers. Finally, I purchased it. Cloudy amber, semi-sweet, good hops and malt...boy was I an idiot. For the price, $3.99 for the bottle, this was a steal. The taste was so smooth and drinkable, almost conversationable. If there is such a thing as a ""table beer"" along the lines of a ""table wine", this would be it. ."
"It pours a rich opaque gold with a lightly tanned head. The smell is a mixture of malt, hops, floarals, and fruit. The taste is of malt sweetness with a cherry finish. There is also a boquet of alcohol that is quite plesant. It's clear and light to the feel with a wet finish. I am really quite impressed with this one. The best Ommegang product I have had. This is an excellent beer I will have again"
"Unlike most of the belgian-style ales I normally enjoy Rare Voss is not a burly behemoth of flavor. It is a mild, easy drinking brew. At 6.5 ABV, it was easy for me to drink a 750 ml. bottle and not feel more than a pleasant warmness. I went ridiculously well with the steak and aparagus, neither being overpowered by the food nor overpowering. This may be the the best session beer of this type I've had, and it is a great substitute for a table wine when consuming red meat."
"A medium-sized, dark, cream-colored head leaves swoopy lacing. The beer is a full, reddish-amber and clear. Dry, spicy, flowery nose. Dry and spicy again in the front. Pepper. There's some fruit in the middle, but it's not sweet. Foamy, creamy with temperature. The finish is bitter and dry, peppery, almost sour. Alcohol is evident. I remember really liking this, but this was a bit of a let-down."
"Rocky off-white head, hazy caramel/amber color in the glass. Fruity nose with light Belgian yeast character. The taste is brash hoppy bitterness tempered with a good dash of malty sweetness, somewhat dough-like in taste. Spicy yeast notes too. Finishes fruity and bitter with an after smack of malt. A good drinking ale."
"Comes in a bottle conditioned, corked bottle. Pours a pleasant, deep amber with good head retention, lacy white head. Taste is as a good Belgian beer should be. Heavy on the hops, big malt profile, and spices unknown create a powerful, sharp and bitter beer. Good smoothness and drinkability. An excellent beer, as expected from Brewery Ommegang."
"Exceptional appearance! Fluffy thick white head with tons of lacing.The color is a hazy brownish-red.Tastes stronger than the 6.5% ABV the bottle says. Maybe because it has alot of body.Sweet malt nose but not much more than that.Very drinkable with crisp bite.No real hop taste or smell,but there is some bitterness on the finish. Would like to see more hops.Has a bready,dry,grain taste."
"I really wanted to love this beer, as Ommegang has brought more good into the beer world than any one brewer should be expected to. And don't get me wrong, this is a very tasty, refreshing, well-made beer. Still, I'd like it to have a bit more balls. A nice girl, but no prom queen."
"750ml bottle: This pours a slightly orangish color. Big off-white head that lingers a bit. Aroma has lemon, yeastiness, some bread, a hint of caramel and some spices. Lemony taste up front. A hint tart. Somewhat malty, spicy, a llittle on the lighter side. Definitely a complex taste. Very Nice."
"Light and crisp with bold carbonation. A bit much for my delicate tounge. Easy going down, but lacks anything of desire."
"This is an impressive looking Belgian, from a 355 ml bottle it pours a deep hazy apricot colour with a great deal of carbonation action, and a massive creamy head that gets chunky on the pour, rises above the rim of my chalice glass and holds its form. Solid lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is more faint than I was expecting, I'm picking up spices and traces of a juicy red fruit, like grapes or plums, also a bit of earthiness in there as well. The flavour also contains that red plum-like characteristic, as well as some grass, and on the finish I begin to start noticing some sweet malt blended with spices, mostly clove and pepper. Mouthfeel is light and velvety, a pleasure to roll over the tongue. A decent Belgian, although I'd prefer a Unibroue over it if given the choice. That's if Sleeman doesn't go and screw things up."
"It pours out of a 750ml bottle, clear orange with a nicely lasting film. Very belgian aroma with a wall of doughy and bready yeast. Fruity and flowery malt (peaches, apricot, honey). It begs for a sip... which I later regret. Watery and bland palate with empty almost uniquely yeasty flavors, bready. Mouthfeel is creamy and way too airy and carbonated which almost distracts the flavors out of your mouth before it hits your tongue."
"Cellarable. Nice hoppy carbonation from bottle conditioning after about 3 months. Light with Abundant head that settles into lace sealing of malt and Light spices in yeast including cinammon. Creamy mouth feel and must be sipped. Popular. Fruity aroma. I think the ladies like this too."
"Poured from the bottle a nice dark copper color with a great amount of head, little bubble bath of froth from this lovely belgian. Very high carbination and a ton of lacing. Scents of fruits, banana, and alcohol. Hard to get away from the idiot at the bar with the stogie... definate impact on the senses... Tastes of dark fruits and vanilla ice-cream. Im terribly impressed with how long this ale held it's carbination. All in all it is just very nice, like it!"
"Medium bodied, feels higher in ABV than it is, not something I'd quaff down, or even buy that often, but it is interesting."
"(12 oz bottle aged 2-3 years)"
"The Vos pours out clear initially from its bottle, but the end of the bottle contributes a bit of hazy yeast, making the overall appearance slightly foggy. The color is a dark earthy amber, and the bubbles pour up from the bottom. The head is large, overflowing the glass at first, but it recedes slowly, leaving a ton of foamy lace behind. The smell is very... what is it? It's not light, theres plenty to smell. Its very straightforward in its subtleties. This could probably use a good aging, but I'm drinking it straight from the store. From the smell of this beer, I instantly remember touring the Ommegang brewery and seeing the sample of spices they use, because theyre in the smell, thas for sure. I cant put my finger on them specifically, but what I do smell is a figgy cherry fruitiness along wiht a spiced wheaty aroma, all of which smelled quite sweet. The taste is sour fruity spice, with an alcoholic malty flavor and the definately hint of the yeasts. There is a hint of the hops too, but not overpronounced. The mouthfeel is a bit too dry feeling for me, with the combination of the light body, the good amount of small bubbles and an overall dry taste. Besides that though, its a good beer definatley."
"A spicy drinkable brew, almost tastes like a Hefe-Weissen."
"Very nice brew. Thanks WesWes!"
"This beer is enjoyable and easy to drink."
"I really like this stuff. I am having it with five grain crackers and cream havarti cheese. I love cream havarti cheese. This tastes mighty fine. First is a sharp, spicy and peppery yeastness. Next comes the fruit, and lots of it, mainly green melon and orange. Nice flavor with this beer but for being 6.5% the alcohol is way to prominent. High carbonation. But, the best thing about this beer is that it is very very creamy. It makes it wonderful."
"A great all-around lighter styled Belgian ale, and one I'd love to sample at the ""sly fox"" proper."
"This is another solid offering from Brewery Ommegang. The price makes this a great buy in and of itself, but the brews that BO makes are just fantastic. I will definitely come back to this one again and again."
"A nice looking amber pour with a very generous, foamy white head. The nose to be quite subtle, almost dull. Light grassy notes with hints of lemon zest. The taste also seems more mild than i excpected. Bland up front followed by a very light caramel-fudge sweetness in the middle. The finish leans towards the sweeter side with mild spice, lemon and even a touch of woodiness. The mouthfeel is very smooth, almost flat...to light bodied for my liking. An easy drinker but not something i can see myself enjoying bottle after bottle."
"This fox was so eager to be imbibed that it literally blew its own cork to get out. Once it settled down, it slipped down with a rich mahogany color and a smooth full head. As soon as it began to lace the rim, I noticed a fruity banana aroma coming out of the glass. The first sip revealed a smooth body that left a slight tingle on the tongue. Its light and relaxed malty flavor, laced with spicy undertones is not as rich or filling as Ommegang's other brews, but (with its relatively low ABV) would make this a great session brew."
"A very impressive beer, which had a nice malty flavor. It was mellow, maybe from age. But it had a lot of fruity flavors and smells. The color was a beautiful amber, or something similar. Cloudy, due to the yeast. Quite good. Not an everyday beer, but definitely one to come back to."
"Very nice burnt orange color with a wonderful sweet malty aroma. The initial taste is peppery with a bread like texture. The alcohol is very well hidden and I would recommend this one to anyone who wants to start trying belgian styles. Not as good as Hennepin, but still solid!"
"This is a very nice domestic ale with really interesting and unique characters hearkening to its Belgian muses."
"Beef Notes: Another good one from Ommegang. I think it would make a great gateway beer to introduce people to Belgian styles, as it is very unoffensive. I would love to have it again, but if I was purchasing, I would probably buy one Ommegang's other fine beers instead."
"."
"Taste is sweet malt and spicy up front. Definitely taste some cloves in there. Some fruitiness, like spiced apples way back there in the flavor profile. After that it finishes with quite the strong alcohol finish. Mouth is kind of sticky with a bit of alcohol burn. Nice sipping beer. Probably could've left this one on the cellar for a few more months to let the flavors mellow a bit but stil pretty damn good."
"Poured a bright tangerine-cranberry color with a large white head. Tons of bubbles, this almost looks like some sort of lambic from the color and high carbonation. Aroma is sweet and fruity, including concord grapes, buttery yeast, and a bit of malt. The mouthfeel of this is over carbonated and really thins out the full flavors of the brew. Very fruity tasting, a little bit of spiceness from the yeast and hops, but hardly any malt flavor. I was rather disappointed, this is my least favorite from Ommegang so far. Really left me wanting a bottle of Hennepin."
"I was slightly disappointed in this ""Belgian-style"" Ale. It was drinkable enough, but I had really set myself up to expect a true Belgian taste. It's not there. At least not in the bottle I tried. It poured a clear amber with a white head that was short lasting with little lacing. The aroma was of malt, yeast, and a little hops. The taste just didn't have the unique, Belgian kick to it that I was expecting. It was a little thin, actually quite thin in the mouth, but that may be due to the low alcohol content. Come to think of it, that may be what is missing in this beer. At 6.5%, it was just thin, compared to Belgians at 8, 9, or 10 percent. In its favor, it was half the price so I could drink a few of these, but not as a Belgian substitute."
"Slightly hazy copper with huge off white head. Crisp carbonation keep the fine grained head till the end, lacing in sheets the whole way. Hops are present, but not overpowering. Green apples and pepper. Very dry finish. I think of this as a lighter, milder version of a hoppy Belgian strong pale such as Piraat. Less alcohol, mouthfeel, and hop bite. A very drinkable beer."
"poured an orangish copper with a generous pillowy white head- beautiful. tiny bubbles cascaded up from the goblet's bottom. aroma was floral and citrusy with that sweet belgian malty essence. mouthfeel was crisp and medium to light. flavors of green apple, a little nutty, caramel and a dash of pepper in the finish. this is a highly quaffable session beer and my favorite from the cooperstown brewery. glad i bought a whole case!"
"Pours a nice dark orangy color with a sizable head that dissolves to a fine bubbly sheen...citrus seems to dominate in early glass, as it warms it reveals a nice balance of malt/hops. Spice in the finish..pepper, hint of cloves....grapefruit....this beer is excellent with spicy food, thai, mexican etc...the brewer at Ommegang told me (at Half time's recent 3 phillophs event) that this is the staff's favorite at the Brewery"
"12 oz bottle of this Brabant Ale poured into a goblet a slightly hazy dark burnt orange, with a huge head of tiny bubbles. Head eventually melts into ring and sheet lacing. Aroma is of dark fruits, florals, and peppery spices. Mouthfeel is bready and full bodied, with lots of carbonation. Taste is sweet caramel malts upfront, yeasty breadiness, peppery spices, and a touch of bittering hops. Finishes a bit dry without any overpowering aftertaste. A decent American version of a Belgian Pale Ale, but it doesn't seem very strong. Seems to me, it's missing something. Maybe in the yeast strains they're using. Very drinkable for this style."
"The taste is spot on belgian strong ale. Lots of heavy malty spice up front with a small amount of bannana and fruit coming through the middle. The carbonation is well felt in the middle and the alcohol reveals itself towards the end without being unwelcome. Lots going on here."
"Rare Vos, Sampled a 75cl bottle. Poured a pale caramel color with a nice persistent head. Had a slight musky,earthy smell to it.Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The taste wasn't very strong for this ""Belgian Style"" Ale; it has a malty/grainy/bitter taste and a dry, slight alcohol finish which didn't mesh very well.Maybe they should call this their english brown ale.Not Ommegangs best beer thankfully."
"Dark, rich amber body has a nice glow. The head starts off big-bubbled and a bit fizzy, but settles into a nice cream-colored melted icecream layer that doesn't seem to get any thinner. Plentiful streaming carbonation gives the beer a sense of being alive. Very estery aroma, a bit herbal and some vague fruit. The flavor is surprisingly dry, when starts me off calling it thin, but is perhaps better labeled as subtle. The fruit and herbs of the end are quite pleasant, but there's a slight metallic bitterness detracts a bit."
"Somewhere between a copper and orange hue; a bit hazy and murky looking, as well as a decent amount of lacing to be noted. On the nose, fresh fruits, cherries, peaches, green apples, pears, simply amazing. A bit twangy and just on the border of being chewy, but not quite. Dry and a bit laid back; decent yeasty body with some reserved sugar, candy cane offerings. Sticky as it warms, sort of a bubble gum palate and a bit rustic. Reserved flavoring in the background, certainly drinkable; one that should be enjoyed by most BA's."
"Drinkability: Why bother to finish the glass, I no not why."
"Honey colored with an ample creamy beige head-marginal lace. Softly fruity and malty on the nose. Crisp in the mouth and almost saison in style. Flavors are refreshingly fruity with light maltiness. Citric hop flavors clean things up nicely. A nice beer for the price. I paid 4.49 for the 750ml. And it does a decent job of trying to be what it would like to be-a Belgian! Good effort and a nice value."
"This is a tough catagory with really strong competition. The thing I like about this one is the taste is truly distinctive. The price is right too. I will quaff again!!"
"paid $3.99 for a 750ml. $7.49 for a 4 pack of 12oz bottles."
"Drinkability - delicious enough to drink everyday and about as affordable. Well done by Ommegang."
"John"
"Drinkability: Oh god, yes. A solid beer with a bargain basement price. They could charge twice as much for it and I'd still consider this well worth it. I like Hennepin and Ommegang a little better, though."
"Overall Impression: Sigh. I really hope I got a bad batch somehow, which still counts against the brewer. Starting with a gush didn’t help my impressions, and the end result is that, while I’ll drink this, I’m already looking forward to my next beer. The flavor profile is well balanced and the spices are nice, but not great. Obviously some quality in the brew given the massive lacing, but overall, I feel like I didn’t get my money out of this."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy reddish-amber color with two fingers of head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is very malty and sweet, with bits of lemon and caramel. The taste starts malty and sweet, with a bit of fruit and pepper. A hint of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is also fairly nice. Another great brew from Ommegang."
"The nose is very nice and provides hints of yeast, fruit and spice, along with a very strong alcohol sense that seems higher than its rating. A smooth, creamy feel crosses the lips and provides a bready and yeasty sense very quickly. Lighter notes of fruit and spice enter as each sip settles in and hints at a very nice complexity. The body is lighter and thinner than normally noted in this style. This is followed by a less than crisp, but notably clean finish. The drinkability seems quite good and I can imagine a setting with several of these consumed."
"Not bad as far as American made Belgian brews. It's definately a lot more refreshing and crisp than most brews of it's kind, which tend to be heavy and thick. The taste is like most Belgians, but lighter and somewhat sharper. The appearance of the beer was a nice thing too. The color was ""murky"" brownish red, with a creamy colored foam. The head lasted a good bit and was very frothy to begin with."
"I think the pepper spice would mellow a bit with some aging. What a great excuse to buy another bottle or two. Cheers."
"Overall - a pretty good strong ale but I think that a couple refinements could be made to give a better balanced beer."
"Belgian style ale. Dark golden color, large head. Aroma is very malty, fruity and sweet. Smooth malty flavor, nearly fruity. Some hoppyness, nice malt flavors. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is smooth and malty, no bitterness. No harsh alcohol taste (6.5%). Very good beer."
"This beer poured an amber/almond color that was cloudy to the eye, probably d/t to it being bottle conditioned. The foam that was produced was thick, rich, creamy, sticky, full and colored and off white in color. Lasting power was very nice. It produced a nice sticky lace on the sides of the glass. The aromas that this beer produced were of alcohol soaked fruits, big malts, some grains, plums, raisins and a banana, lots of spices (clove, nutmeg, pepper, licorice), hints of yeast and like a tree bark tendency. The tastes were dominated by all the spices that were noticeable in the nose: cloves, peppers, nutmegs, licorice, followed by some sweet malts and fruits (some dark sweet fruits, bananas and apples), then yeasty bread grains, and hints of alcohol. Aftertaste was of dry yeast, drier overall then I would have thought with the sweetness taking a back seat, and only emerging on occasions. But refreshing and a different view of the style. Not as heavy as I would have thought comparing it to others of the same style, more of a medium/light medium body. Decently complex in the nose and pallet. Good and would probably get again. But would like to try others of the same style first before I revisit."
"Interesting: Has a lot of character, but the biting finish was a let down to an otherwise good, well balanced, beer."
"This was a delicious beer. I set aside the rest to have with dinner and it was even better as it warmed. The reasonable ABV% makes Rare Vos quite easy to drink. A great beer with grilled meats and vegetables. A real treat."
"Nice amber color with a slight head that continues to linger.Malty and sweet aroma-somewhat spicy and faintly of hops.Big flavor-malty sweetness,spiciness and maybe a touch of caramel.Full bodied mouthfeel and smooth on the palate.Overall a great beer-never had a bad one from Ommegang."
"A nice looking deep amber ale with a creamy dense head and light retention. Gives a fruity spicy aroma with an earthy quality that is quite pleasant. Great full bodied with a creamy yet effervescent mouthfeel. Flavor is malty, fruity with notes of caramel. Everything was excellent about this ale untill the last mouthfull which seemed weak and slightly watery. Also this ale would benefit with a higher abv. It's just missing something."
"Very straightforward yet somehow subtle. A dark brew with a head that won't quit. An offering to the nose of cloves, clove incense, and clove cigarettes. There's definitely a little pepper and fruit there as well, but this aroma is so well-integrated, it's like watching two really great dancers have at it on an empty floor. Just mind-bogglingly well put together. Flavor is also clove-like but dominated by the yeast. Meaty and luscious yet fruity, estery: lemon and light rind bitterness to close."
"A hazy copper colored beer with a large white head. The head is quite fizzy and diminishes quickly. Aroma is malty and fruity with some spicyness. The taste malty and peppery. Lots of flavor from the yeast as well. Overall, a solid belgian style ale, but not my favorite Ommegang."
"Poured a hazy tan-brown. Tart fruit aroma. Initial impression contained an element of raw medicinal alcohol, but this faded quickly as the beer warmed up a bit. Tart phenolic fruit flavors of apricot and pear. At first the beer seemed a bit untamed and unrefined, but as it warmed a bit more maltyness emerged and the flavors came together much better. Finish was a bit sharp with citric acidity."
"I'm fairly new to Belgian-style ales. But if the majority of them are like this, count me in. A gamey meal would go along just fine."
"Actually it's pretty dry on the palate. There is a chalky, yeasty slice of powdered coriander and glazed meats. Dehydrated banana peels and dehydrated citrus peel are stitched throughout the voluptuosly large body. A bit Frankenstein-like...a bit engineered, but impressive."
"Pours a hazy deep orange with a medium head that sticks around for quite some time,the aroma is orangy and pretty clovey.The taste is a little tart to begin with and a lingering spiciness to it.Nice mouthfeel to it and seems to be pretty drinkable, something a little different."
"Big thanks to purplehops for providing this bottle!"
"Shared a bottle of this with beergeek279. Pours a orange color topped by a thick off white head. Shows great retention. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy, with a touch of sweetness and spices. The taste is very grassy and herbal, with again a nice hop component. The mouthfeel is rather light and refreshing for the style, and reflects a well crafted beer. The carbonation, although strong, is part of the beer rather than being a noticeably individual item. The drinkability is actually very good. As many others have mentioned, this could be a belgian style session type beer."
"Rare Vos pours an orange-amber color with a thick off-white head. Excellent head retention and a beautiful beer. The bouquet is diverse with notes of citrus rind, caramel, and herbal/floral aspects. The taste is a great balance between caramel malt, herbal hops and citrus. Finish is sharp and clean. Rather full-bodied and mildly carbonated. Drinks very well for a beer of 6.5% abv, and according to the brewers, it's about as close to a Belgian session ale as you'll find. Another excellent creation from Ommegang. Great stuff."
"Thanks to aaronh for supplying this sample. Ommegang makes such quality beers, and this is no exception. For a fraction of the prices of ""real"" Belgians, Rare Vos stands with the best of them."
"This brew poured a very large creamy head of finely sized off white bubbles that as it receded left an excellent lacing. It has an amber colored body with lots of carbonation rising in the mug. It has a very nice malty aroma. It had a initially smooth taste that finished even more smoothly with a very mild floral flavor. There was no tartness, bitterness, just smooooooth. Can I have some more please?"
"Hazy apricot color with a large effervescent cream colored head, even webbing of lace delicate and beautiful Belgian style ale poured from a 12oz. bottle conditioned vessel. Aroma has fruit sweet nectar picking up some sharp apple tones, and cherries thrown in there to make it a bit sweet and sour. Slightly musty yet peppery yeast effervesence makes this beer one of the most appetising american made belgium styles ales I have come across. Sweet sharp malt tones with fruit phenols dancing along the palate what a great beer, same yeast profile just a tad peppery in the flavor profile and a mild bitter hop profile to go along with it. Just amazing that this beer wasn't brewed in Belgium, in my eyes the high carbonation makes this beer able to cut right through the flavors of a well done prime rib or any other lucious meat. Medium in body a true blessing to any beer lover, and this Brewery Ommegang product may just be the most drinkable other than Hennepin. Just simply a must try wonderful strong ale."
"This beer reminds me of a wine. It's most dominanat flavors are fruity flavors that I would usually find in wines. But this does have more complexity than that. There's some citrus hops that fit well and I definitely taste the yeast in this. The yeast is also apparent in the finish causing for a very dry ending in this one. The body is light in my opinoin and needs to be a little more bold for this beer to go to the next level and join its compadres Ommegang and Hennepin."
"This tastes strikingly similar to a smaller, less mature version of this brewery's Ommegang. Good, but not this brewery's best."
"Pours out to a slightly hazy light amber with orange accents, forming a large light beige head after a vigorous pour. Head is sea-foam in consistency and has OK retention with sparse lacing. Aroma is of dry cloves, a faint whiff of bananas, apricots, a crisp toasted wheat note, Wyeast Belgian Wit yeast aromatics, and diabetic urine (seriously). Mouthfeel is spritzy, with a watery thin body. Taste begins with florid carbonation, immediately fading into a thin bitterness with nary a hint of hop flavor or aroma...more of a tannic bitterness, like oversteeped black tea. There is a toasty note in the middle, a mentionable complete lack of malt body or sugar, followed by more chemical bitterness in the watery, thin finish. The finish reminds me of chewing a Tylenol. In the aftertaste, I tend to pick up roasted barley astringency and some isopropyl alcohol. As it warms, the alcohol becomes obtrusive and drys out the mouth. Highly overrated, and nothing I would care to drink again."
"Originally sampled on 27 January 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. Thanks to slushy for this one. This is a hazy burnt orange w/ some champagne bubbles & tightly bubbled head. Slight flavors of peaches and pears. This was a very enjoyable beer."
"-F"
"The beer poured a dark golden/ amber color with a large off-white head that remained throughout my tasting. It was a bit hazy and overcarbonated due to bottle conditioning, but it's not a real big issue. The aroma smells of sweet Belgian malts and corriander. It's a bit fruity. The taste is good. A bit plain for me. Their other beers offer a little more spiciness, but this one is a good choice. The taste has the same fruity taste, but not as strong as the aroma suggests. I detect very little hopping in this one. The mouthfeel is quite smooth. This beer is very drinkable and a delight. Ommegang offers plenty in the line quality Belgian ales. This one however, is my least favorite of theirs'."
"Mildly sweet, with biscuit and raw grain flavors. Oranges, slightly spicy, and transitions into a dry piney finish. Full bodied a somewhat rustic (in a good way). Creamy, smooth, & balanced. This beer is complex, sublte, & highly quaffable. Drinking this is as easy as breathing air."
"Overall, a tasty beer that I would try again, but not up to par with Ommegang or Hennepin."
"This brew poured a large, creamy head, but it left little to no lacing on the sides of my mug. It had a fruity aroma to it. It had a very smooth taste which was much to my liking. There was no bitterness to this brew in my opinion. I was very, very impressed with this brew and I hope to have the opportunity to enjoy this brew again."
"Slightly cloudy orange body, topped by a hefty big-bubbled white head. Head settles down to a half-inch topper shortly. A large snout of a nose, dominated by apples, lemons and oranges (not the grapefruit of cascade hops). Also a strong spicy character, peppery (not spicy like the dry spice of an overdone Christmas ale). All the characters of the nose are also in the taste: the spicy, peppery hops, a very apple/citrus fruity taste. Finishes surprisingly dry and clean. Could make a really fine ""relaxing on the deck in summer"" beer."
"What a bier!!!"
"Pours a nearly clear orange-coppery color with a big, white, frothy head. Estery, spicy, and fairly earthy aroma. Kind of a dry malt taste, with some noticeable hop bitterness. Medium-bodied and crisp. Dry finish and has a honey-like aftertaste. Pretty darned good stuff, and only about $5.00 for a 750 ml. bottle. You can't beat that."
"An odd, but not unpleasant beer."
"Big 750 ml brown bottle with cork and cage. A loud ""pop"" indicates a full amount of carbonation. Medium copper in color, shiny. Poured into a wide mouth belgian goblet as the bottle instructs. Off-white to beige head. Subtle smells of mulled spices. Cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg too. Taste was a bit oddly sweet, syrupy and full of spices. Hints of black pepper and sweet carmel malt, but nutmeg and cinnamon seem to dominate the flavors, but they don't balance and malt or traditional yeasty belgian flavors. Chewy full belgian feel fades as is the glass sits, and it turns into a muddled, spice filled, watery concoction. All beer and belgian flavors seem to fade into a wierd mess. There are present to start, but they fade fast. Seemingly artificial alcohol heat to finish. Watery, thin, and slippery feel linger. An all out search for positive flavors left on the tongue, comes up empty. Not one to savor, and honestly hard to finish the entire bottle. Maybe my taste buds aren't refined enough. This one was a dissapointment to me. My apologies to those that are a big fan of this one. I liked the other two from this brewery. I don't think it was past it's prime, I just didn't enjoy it like I hoped I would."
"Another great brew from the folks at Ommegang. Pours an orange/copper in color with a thick creamy off-white, persistent head. After the froth dies down, a sticky web-like lace is left on the glass. Aromas are quite yeasty with moderately fruity undertones. Initial taste is somewhat malty, mixed with yeast and citrus fruit. A nice crisp zing of spiciness, possibly coriander, is left on the tongue. This is one exceptionally complex, yet balanced brew."
"I hated, HATED this beer. But, I could appreciate how so many might like it. I was also impressed by the fact that the flavor didnt follow in lock step with the aroma, offering up some nice appley tartness that was non-existent in the aroma. I will take off points for the possible addition of Coppertone and cabbage to the kettle, but Ill be fair enough to recognize this beer strengths too"
"This is a well-balanced, though not overly complex, brew. It pours a cloudy, medium-dark amber with a light tan head which settles into a weblike lace. There is hoppy smell, but not much by way of spice. The mouthfeel is exquisite--cottony soft and a lightly fine carbonation. There's an initially tart taste--the hops--which fades deliberately into a slighly fruity finish. Very drinkable. I like everything about this brew and the brewery that makes it; they are clearly doing something right."
"I picked up some bottles after my trip to the brewery and I am extremely impressed. Out of the four beers they brew this is in the middle of the pack, but for this brewery that still means exceptional. Vos poured a sweet orange color with a fair bit of cloudiness and sediment. The head was white and ginormous as a good Belgian should be. The smell was spicy with just a subtle hint of hops. The taste was full bodied with a sweet malted characteristic and some hops and pepper in the back. Seeing how carefully they attend to the brews only made me appreciate this even more. I can't wait for my 750 of the abby."
"Complicated but not overbearing, spicy but not combative, Rare Vos is peppy and intriguing. Certainly a beer that I will purchase again, and I will probably put one or two in storage for a while, if I can keep my hands off them."
"The body is medium, and it is full of flavors. The complexity is not too much as to scare people away. I would think that this would be a great beer to turn someone on to the style."
"Unibroue can't go wrong. This beer pours with an enormous fluffy head. The aroma is dark fruits, malts, sweetness, and a touch of hops. This has such a beautifully smooth mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation zing. It's sweet, a little spicy, some cloves and fruitiness as well. Not much to say other than buy this 750mL for the very far from objectionable price. Also buy this if you're looking for something more mellow than the higher ABV monsters that Unibroue makes."
"Compared to the other beers by ommengang I was a little let down by this beer. If you gave me a blind taste test of this beer next to a real belgian I havn't had yet I'd be hard pressed to tell which one was the American beer. It's an excellent belgian attempt. Ommengang stands alone in US belgian style beers, but this beer just fell a little short in my opinion. I might get another bottle and let it age for a while before trying it again."
"Orangish-copper in color with an off-white head. Lieave a good amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet from candi sugar, with hints of raisins, dates, and toffee. The flavor is sweet, bread-like with raisin notes that flow into a dry alcoholic finish. This is a very good medium-bodied Belgian-style ale. I will definitely sample this one again."
"Woah. Thems some brew. Pours a hazed red amber with a flowing white head. Fruity, spicy, grainish... what is it? Well for yeast sake, it's quite the belgiumish brew. Quite good indeed! Not the best Ommegang, but for a Belgium brew from the US this is up there for sure!"
"Pours a hazy peachy amber color with active carbonation and a thick, persistent head. Crisp yeast scents complemented with fruity (apricot) notes and a bit of peppery spice. Yeasty but not bready--a creamy, smooth mix of light malts and hops topped off with the spiciness that shows up in the nose. Alcohol warmth shows up more and more as the beer warms up. Nothing dominates the flavor of this incredibly drinkable, but a bit watery, beer."
"Cheers"
"An Awesome, High Quality Belgium style beer brewed in the USA, now back under the direct control of a Belgium brewer. Is it idiosyncratic, or politically incorrect, to say that I hope the Belgiums dont mess about with this beer?????"
"Palate is surprisingly simple and a bit watery. There is some malt, with a subtle clove/phenol note. The fruit is there again, with pear leading the parade, and banana making a fleeting appearance. Decent length, and easy to quaff, but there's just not a lot there. A disappointing performance for a beer from this fine brewery. I'll have to pick up another bottle to see if mine was representative."
"Drinkability: I really like the beers being produced by Ommegang. I just hope that with the recent announcement of their sale to the brewers of Duvel that they maintain the quality I've come to expect from them. If you've never had Ommegang, I urge you to do so now! Not to be missed."
"Pours a cloudy hazy golden-amber color, huge tightly bubbled clingy head that leaves long lasting lace in my glass. Flowery, spicy clean citrus aromas. Fruity and sweet spicy flavors, medium-full body, very lively carbonation, finish dry and crisp, very refreshing and tasty."
"A very good beer. I will definitely purchase this one again and try all of the other offerings from this brewer."
"Cloudy, hazy amber-honeyish hue, soft gold highlights. Fluffy dull-white head with handsome lace and soapy retention. Yeasty, citrusy, fruity, malty, musty, and faint pepper gathers as the nose, fragrant but not magical. Medium-bodied, peppery, very well carbonated, malt and yeasty-must battle for supremacy on the palate but the sweetness and fruitness are not to be ignored. Complex, a true pleasure to drink. Hard to believe that Rare Vos (and anything made by Ommegang) is domestic, a genuine treat from the Beer Gods this is brew is recommend."
"Pours a copper/amber color with a sizeable head. Sweet, fruity, and floral nose. Malt, fruit, and some spice in the taste. Well balanced and finishes surprisingly dry. Very drinkable."
"Pours reddish amber in color with a 1/4 inch fluffy white head. The smell is malty with a hint of sweetness. The taste is Belgian all the way. Spicy, sweet and a hint of banana. I have had this beer a couple of times before but never had the chance to review it. It's like a baby Belgian Ale that just can't go all the way. I say that but I really love this beer. Another great offering from a great brewery."
"I've always liked this beer, just not as much as their others, Ommegang and Hennepin."
"Hazy dried apricot color with a large foam that settles quickly. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of head retention, since Belgians usually have no problem with this. Complex aroma of grape (making it a bit wine-like), plum, a bit of citrus, a touch of malt, and a hint of Belgian spicy yeast. Flavor profile differs a good deal from the aroma, but is also very complex, and definitely tasty. Bread-like malt, smoothed fruity bitterness, and yeast character up front, with an underlying yet rich spiciness. Dark fruits appear at the back, the aforementioned plum mostly. Grape-like acidity is present throughout. Finishes with a more apparent hop bitterness and a touch more yeast. Medium to full-bodied. With another pour from the 750 ml bottle and an immediate taste before the head settles, the mouthfeel is much better and the spiciness created by that wonderful yeast is more apparent. This would definitely benefit from better head retention. However, this is quite a tasty, complex, unique, and extremely drinkable ale. Definitely worth a try. I'd love to pair it with some food next time."
"Rare Vos: Year 2000 clearly stated on the label. Well cellared, and the beer was a effervescent treat. Pours an orange/gold, with a huge rocky head that lasts. The taste was particularly sweet and fruity, with a Champagne mouthfeel. A slight (very slight) taste of cider suggested that this had slightly passed its perfect age, but all-in-all it was very satisfying, and went very well with Thanksgiving dinner."
"Great beer, I am loving these Belgian styles."
"Pours a deep reddish golden straw color with a beautiful frothy white head with excellent clinginess.  The aroma is a light fruitiness of banana and citrus mixed with a malty sweetness.  A lovely taste of green apples, honey, citrus, malt, and hops with a somewhat dry finish.  It has a very crisp and refreshing feel in the mouth.  This was an outstanding beer!  And, its a great buy at $3.99 for a 750ml!"
"An impressive, self-sustaining, rocky head tops this beer.  The color is a ruddy, deep-amber that's very cloudy.  The aroma is certainly yeasty and fruity, although not as intense as I'd anticipated.  Also, there's some fleeting bananna and clove.  Medium bodied and doughy....with a pleasing spicy flavor.  I particularly sense cinnamon.  As with other Ommegang brews that I've tried, the price is fantastic, while the beer is interesting and well-made."
"An Amber ale, very well carbonated with a thick and creamy head.  The aroma is slightly sour, orange-like and fruity.  As it warms it develops a malty richness.  Very nice.  Taste starts with a big malty sweetness, followed by some darker fruits (fig perhaps) and spices.  Somewhat dry, sour finish, with a mildly sweet aftertaste.  Quite drinkable, even if not quite up to the standards of the brewery's namesake beer."
"Another winner from Brewery Ommegang!  Pours a nice cloudy amber with a frothy tan head.  The aroma is a mixture of fruits, spices and malt.  The taste IMO was somewhere between an Ommegang and Hennipin, less fruity the the O and not as hoppy as the H.  It was more of a malt taste with hints of subtle hops and fruit/spice flavor. This beer is a very drinkable brew which can be enjoyed with food, but I prefer to sit back and just enjoy it by itself as I relax................CHEERS"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a massive 3 finger off white head with staying power.  The smell is that of a slight yeast with fruity esters and a touch of spice.  The taste is a very well balance with spices, slight fruit, and light hops with yeast in the background.  It does not have a sticky mouthfeel like a lot of Belgian-style brews I've had.  This is one fine tasting Belgian-style brew!  Cheers!"
"Hazy brown/nutmeg color, head dies down to a side-clinging trace after a while...slight yeast aromas, quite a bit of spiced apples going on in the smell.  Coating mouthfeel, sense of fruitiness ranging toward apple and peaches with a simulation of an estery feel.  Attenuates mid mouth with an astringent (straying to sour) close and a somewhat dryish finish.  Impressed with Ommegang again, to my tastes, a good beer that's not quite as good as their flagship brew."
"A good beer by my standards, however less refined than what I would expect from the grand masters at Ommegang."
"Pours a cloudy peach/orange color with a slightly fizzy head that leaves an excellent lace all the way down the glass.  Slightly tart smell with some apples, peaches, and other lighter fruits.  Great starting fruitiness that has a nice refreshing tartness to it with some definite apple, raisin, orange zest, and some sweet candy flavors as well.  The sweet fruitiness is offset nicely by just enough earthy noble hop flavors.  The brew is slightly effervescant across the tongue and also rather smooth as well.  This is one very drinkable brew regardless of the time of year.  They just don't seem to know how to make anything that isn't excellent at this brewery."
"This beer is a blazing orange and has thick, meringue-like topping that is well retained.  Some fruity and yeasty tones are evident on the nose.  Almost a bit of a musty smell as well.  Light to medium body.  Carbonation seems just right.  Very mellow and drinkable beer.  Some light notes of wood and smoke.  Also get fruits (Grapes?) and bready yeastiness.  Some hebal qualities seem to surface as well.  No hint of alcohol on my buds.   Nice beer."
"Cloudy orange/amber with a persistant foam.  The lace on this beer has staying power, and leaves a trail all down the glass.  Floral and spicy in aroma, with clove and maybe pepper notes.  The flavor is malty sweet and spicy, with a pleasant hop bitterness at the end.  Medium to full body, with wonderfully balanced flavors."
"It's a very nice golden-orange with a fluffy white head that leaves lace all the way down the glass.  The smell is subtly spicy.  The taste is also a bit spicy, but quite mellow and understated.  It goes down like silk and is very drinkable.  I enjoyed this the most of Ommegang's offerings."
"Impressive off - white fluffy, thick and very persistent head.  Slight hazy copper - orange hue, w/ copious, effervescent bubbling.  Quite attractive in appearance.  The aroma is comprised of notes of peach & candied fruit followed by understated acetaldehyde w/ just a hint of phenol.  Caramelized sweetness hits upfront, but is immediately mellowed by honey flavors & sour apple as well as black licorice.  The high carbonation coupled with the relatively full and dextrinous body for style lend a spritzy (but not prickly) and enjoyable mouthfeel.  All around yeast esters are more mellow than the typical Belgian, but contribute more than sufficient complexity to this very drinkable brew.  The clean finish reveals hop bitterness on the back of the tongue as well as a light biscuit flavor and mustiness.  Alcohol warmth slowly emerges long after the sip is over.  The 750 mL bottle is perfect... it's drinkability makes 12 oz a tease."
"This beer poured a nice dark golden color and formed a good medium tan head.  Some lace on the side.  Nice frangrances of spice and malt.  Is a fairly carbonated beer and bears alot of the characteristics you find in a Belgian style.  Has a slight foamy heavy feal in the taste.  Gives it a heavier feel to the body then you would expect."
"Big frothy off white head subside to a clinging cream coloured lace. Mild haze from the yeast, looks nearly clear with a pale copper hue. Fruity, estery and spicy aroma with hints of ripe plum and an earthy blend of anise, clove, nutmeg and citric zest. Dry malt palate that taste like a toasted multigrain cracker, big crisp mouth feel and a moderate body. Bitterness from the hops is noticeable. Estery with a slight peppery phenolic character that goes towards coarse and medicinal in the finish. The finish is dry and grain with residual phenols. Paired very well with whole grain crackers and aged hunters cheddar."
"Copper in appearance, nice carbonation.  Has very fruity taste and a dry finish.  Tried some with cheddar cheese and enjoyed it very much.  Very comparable to Belgian made ales.  I did have one bottle, perhaps served a bit warm, which did taste a little solventlike.   However this seems to have been an exception."
"156"
"Still a good budget Belgian-styled brew. But certainly not the classic I once thought."
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample."
"Bright Orange/Copper color, with a lasting head... and I mean lasting.  Sweet spicey smell.  Taste of esters, fruity, with a bite of spice.  Great lace left in glass (Chimay goblet).  The taste improves on your last glass.. swirl and pour the yeast it is good for you and improves the flavor. This is the most drinkable of Ommegang's products."
"Other reviewers said it well.  An exceptional beer that brings Belgium home."
"The folks at Ommegang certainly did their homework. Rare Vos is a fine example. You can't go wrong with any of Ommegang's beers. I had the pleasure of visiting the brewery this past summer. Following the tour and tasting, I bought a sampler case!"
"Notes: A top fermented, bottle conditioned, Brabant Ale. Absolutey amazingly delicious! You almost forget you are not in Belgium, and for $4.50 a bottle it's a cheap imaginary trip to Belgium, for the taste buds and soul."
