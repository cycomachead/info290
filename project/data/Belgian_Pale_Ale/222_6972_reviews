"Fruity bitter after taste. Great finish."

"Un poco carbonatada de más"
"Poured a deep clear blond with a moderately retentive white head. Nice sticky lacing left. The aroma is mild, fruity and yeasty. The taste is very similar but a little more robust. The body has a nice light weight to it, with just a little bit of carbonation on the finish."
"I am neutral on this beer."

"This beer is extremely well balanced, specially fot those who prefere them bitter."
""

"An okay and easy to drink and refreshing Belgian ale that unfortunately lacks that little extra."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great Belgian blonde.  If you are looking for something complex, then you might be disappointed, but then again... you probably shouldn't be drinking a blonde ale."
"Drinkability – Very easy drinking, and quite a good session beer."

"Decent. Smooth with slight hop. Would have again."

"Okay Belgian. A little tang, very carbonated with gives it a nice pop. A little sweet, not bitter or sour. A slight champagne flavor."

"330 ml. bottle. Golden colour, with a big head that leaves a lace and and a cloak on the sruface. Amell is citrus, herbal, spices, pear, floral. Medium body, carbonation just good enough. Creamy and sticky palate. Taste of citrus, spices, herbs. Good one, but not exceptinal."

"Very well balanced, bitter-sweet Belgian blond elegantly spiced and with good fruit complexity. Thankfully not really sweet. All Maredsous are great solid brews."
""
""
"330 ml bottle into chalice, best before 9/2014. Pours moderately cloudy deep gold color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, honey, bread, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, hops, and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, honey, biscuit, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, honey, biscuit, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of pale malt, hops, fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a very nice malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian pale ale. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of pale malt, hops, and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: This was maybe my first Belgian ale, and I think it's a great introduction to Belgian ales. It's not imposing to look at with tons of sediment, nor is it an ugly quad. It doesn't have a very high abv, it tastes good, very fruit-forward and typical of the esters of Belgian yeast. Recommended, especially if you have never had a Belgian ale before."

"Uma boa cerveja. Ela é mais leve e tranquila. Dourada e de sabor e aroma moderados, porém possui seu equilíbrio e condescendência com a proposta. Uma notável representante das Belgians Blond Ales, talvez até uma das melhores nesse estilo não tão badalado."
"not too bad, there are more flavour in other abbey beers out there, but relatively low alcohol content could be a bonus (or not, depending on taste)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very light. Overall, very good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Body and mouth feel were fine and this is a fine beer, I look forward to finding it on-tap somewhere one day."
""
"Bottle poured into a chimay glass. Deep golden color with a nice two finger head. Lacing nicely as I near the bottom of the glass. Mildly sour with fruity notes in both the smell and taste. This is my first impression but I would leave this one out of my top five Abby style beer. Great beer but it is in a tough catagory. Price point was on par with the beer though. A good value by comparison to other Belgian Trappist style beers."

"Pours a copper amber with a large lasting beige fluffy head with good lacing. Aroma of Belgian yeast, bready , biscuit malt and some fruity notes. Taste is of Belgian yeast and bread, some slightly zesty fruit flavors with some mild citrus. Palate is a medium body, with mild carbonation. The finish is Belgian yeast and bread notes, mild zesty fruity flavors with some light bitterness. A good Belgian blonde ale with food or on its own."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable, and went well with food (crepe with ham and cheese). Had a second one and enjoyed it as much as the first. Definitely more hoppy than some Belgians I've had recently, but it works."
"My only complaint is that we only get the small bottles imported to RSA."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, pineapple-like fruit, and slight yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O: Nice and well balanced beer. Although i like it, i think it's kinda expensive for what it is. But other then that it's definitely a beer i could drink any day."
"O: Good drinkability. Actuallly, a bit disappointing taste which is too watery and tasteless to the stye"

"A light dry slightly bitter aftertaste on the medium bodied affair."

"Medium body though it leans slightly fuller. Medium-light effervescence. Drying, clean finish. Nice brew."
""

"Pours a golden/amber color into my goblet, with a very clingy, overflowing head. Leaves cotton candy like residue as the lacing. There is some re fermented yeast at the bottom. Aroma - Very sweet fruitiness, like watermelon and pear. Yeast and malt character is going to be dominant going by the aroma as well. Taste - very bready, with wheat, banana, kiwi, melon, and candy apple. Very carbonated and medium mouthfeel. A fine, refreshing brew that is 'for anyone.'"

"* Wondering if it was a bad bottle, doesn't seem consistent with other reviews"

"From the caged, corked 750 ml bottle stamped: 2012 91-09:40. Sampled on March 5, 2012. The cork flies across the room and a nice smokiness erupts from the bottle. It pours a slight cloudy golden yellow with a small, long-lasting fizzy white head. On the nose there is a malted bread, yeast, anise, and thin hop character. The body is a bit better than medium. Up front the taste begins with sweet malts then turns over to a peppery character and ends modestly bitter but not sour. This is a decent Abbey Blonde."

"Overall: A very good Belgian Blonde. One of the better Belgian Blondes out there. I like the easy drinking nature of this beer, and it would make an excellent session beer. One of the best Belgian Blondes I've had."

"I like the beer, but my expectations of a Trappist were much greater. I tried the Maredsous Tripel a few days ago and it was also equally disappointing. Sad but true. I'm particularly disappointed with this one because Hefeweizen's aren't difficult to make and for a Trappist, I expect perfection. Sadly, this one doesn't even come close."
"330ml Bottle, poured into Leffe Chalice. Poured a large foamy head. Amber colour, hazy. Had a Belgian yeasty aroma typical of Belgian Blonde/Pale Ale. Was slightly more bitter and spicy than other BPAs I've had. Tasted notes of berries. Normal mouthfull. Overall a beer very similar to Leffe/Grimmbergen Blonde that is pleasant but holds no major surprise."
"Overall: Wife says: Not my favorite, but I'm not a big fan of hops, and this is an unusually one-note beer. Husband says: I much prefer the Maredsous 8."
""
""
"Overall, this is a less-than-stellar offering. It's nice, but forgettable. I'd probably even prefer an Affligem Blonde to this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice one from maredsous, taste an appearance stood out the most, the rest was pretty much what i had expected, nice quality"
""
"An excellent brew that is crisp and refreshing and seemingly sessionable."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: An excellent job on this beer I must say. This is a case that the brewer knew his limitations and didn't try to push the yeast too much like so many Belgians seem to do with me. Crisp, clean, simple but not boring and certainly worth a try. Easily a rival for even the Trappist brews."
""
""

""
""
"It's hard to find a lot to write about Belgian pale ales. To me, there are supposed to be simple yet flavorful and refreshing beers that provide good quality without having to flex any muscles. This beer successfully nails the definition of such ales. I would take this over a Leffe blond ale any day, and it could serve as a good gateway beer for people who are just starting to try new brews."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"Overall, a decent but unexciting Belgian pale. No harm in drinking it but there is much better out there."
""
""
""
"Taste - Very clean and crisp, but still has a soft, complex fruitiness - peach, mineral, yeast, and a slight tartness on the end."
""
""
"Overall: Great beer! Maredsous does it right to start off with this one in their portfolio. Great pairing for some triple cream cheese, honey, and crackers. A must have."
""
""
""
"So clean (for a Belgian), and yet so characterful. This beer is crisp, refreshing, complex, and incredibly drinkable. Pairs with any number of foods, and an awesome beer to have around. Highly recommended."
"Pale blonde/orangeish colour, one finger of thick white head, generous amount of lace on the glass. Smell is yeasty, some light citrus notes, green apple, sweet scents come off of this, spicy and fairly upfront hop profile. Taste is swet candy and yeast at first, followed by dry spicy flavours, lightly bitter, long dry finish. Med-high prickly carbonation, dry, medium full body. Nice belgian pale ale, sweet intially but ends pleasantly dry, quite a drinkable beer here."
"Poured a golden orange, with some browner hues. White or just off-white; good head and retention. Nose is interesting, lightly sour, funky and almost gueuze like in some senses. Some yeasty qualities. Taste has some light tartness on the front end, wheaty and some barnyard like funkiness. Light sweetness, with some hints of honey potentially. Some bready notes, lightly-coloured fruits and a minimal spice note. Medium light body, medium high carbonation. Yeasty with a touch of alcohol, but that doesn't impede its drinkability. Nice light and pleasant, a fairly satisfying blond."
"O: that is something to forget very quickly!"
"Generally being the least heradled of the Maredsous beers, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Not necessarily a world beater, but definitely something highly worthwhile to drink."
"O - A very solid refreshing pale ale. I can't say I'm a fan of the style, but I certainly can't complain about this one. I would actually recommend this over Duvel. It's quite reasonably priced in my area as well, so I would definitely recommend this to fans of the style."
"On tap at burger. in Santa Cruz. Pours a bright fleshy orange color with a creamy white head. Aroma has a prominent booze note, along with some light spiciness and a bit of honey/caramel sweetness. The sweet cakey malt note comes out more in the flavor. Not much else going on here, kind of a simple beer. There's an astringent hard water/mineral note that leaves the palate unclean. This slowly overtakes the sweetness, and about halfway through the glass it's pretty distracting. A rather unsatisfying beer."
"O: Not a bad beer, but it's nothing special. Was hoping for a little bit more spices."
"Beautiful gold color w/ a two finger off white head. Excellent carbonation and lacing. Somewhat clear, but cloudy enough to not see through. Yeast, malt, pineapple, other fruit in the nose. Nice smelling, but I'd like it to be stronger. Very smooth tasting, w/ fruit, nuts, malt coming out. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth w/ the malt coming through. Overall, this is a good beer, but not best in its style. Tasty, but Maredsous Tripel is the best from that label that I've had."
"Overall: Nice blond beer, not too sweet, that’s what I like"
"Overall: All in all, M6 is a pretty tasty, competent blonde."
"O - This has pretty good drinkability. Overall, I think it's a good beer, and great for a hot summer day. It is smooth, refreshing, and I could drink a few of these in a single sitting. I would buy this again."
"Overall, this is a terrific companion to virtually any meal or just hanging on the deck on a Summer evening. Clean, tasty, and not overpowering in any element"
"T - I was really impressed with this drink from start-to-finish; complex sweet notes and some mild malt flavors really balance this beer and provide a unique drink that I would have over-and-over again; great stuff"
"Got this on tap at the Sharp Edge in Canonsburg, PA. A big fan of Maredsous abbey. It pours well with about an inch light head. It is very nice on a 90 degree day since it has little over powering hop after taste. It is somewhat sweet with a bit of floral overtones. I would only recommend to those who like beers like Wittekerke and desire a light hop overtones."
"o - Overall a pretty average Beglian pale ale. Smell has a little mint to it and if it had a little more going on in the taste it could be better, but solid none the less."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I enjoyed both sipping my way through the first half of this beer and then pairing it with the food I had chosen for lunch (a cheese, fruit and walnut tart garnished with a touch of greens). My over all impression is that this is a very good beer. I’d not say it is world class but it is well worth a try and it shows very well in comparison with other Belgian pale ales I’ve tried."
"O - Overall this is an okay BPA. Like many others I tried this night there are much better representations of this style."
"The CPJ"
"(D)- A solid belgian pale ale. Straightforward and classic for the style."
"Drinkability is good. A good beer for when you want something mild and mild tasting."
"Very good beer. Those damn monks! I love drinking out of this goblet too. Makes the whole experience more authentic."
"This is an exquisitely crafted pale ale, and will definitely pick up more in the future."
"Poured from champagne bottle into goblet at slightly over refrigerator temperature. Pouts yellow with a good head which thins but remains for some time. The aroma is of malt without any hop or spice aroma. The flavor is malty without being cloying with an unbalanced, generic hop flavor. The hops and malt coexist together but don't seem to make a whole- that's really too bad for such a pretty beer. The unbalanced flavors and (appropriately) high carbonation make this beer enjoyable but forgettable."
"Pours a slightly hazed pale golden hue with a bright white head fine bubbled effervescent texture. Fine even Belgian style lacing. Aromatics have light biscuit malt sweetness with a touch of tropical fruit and pear juice...a nice welcoming herbal slightly citric hop nose going on as well. Clean biscuit malts hit the palate first with a backend of fruitiness and herbal grassiness in the finish. A touch of white pepper from the yeast used, but overall a very complex low alcohol session ale from Maredsous. Finishes pretty dry with yeast spice and grassy hops, nice straight forward Belgian pale ale...efferevescent carbonation dead on to the style. Overall experience is a good one, a beer I would definitely come back to, but for 3.50 a pop at the local I'm sure sixers of American craft beers will be my go to still."
"Dr: Very good, but not the best abbey beer available. Certainly worth a try, but it doesn't come cheaply. You'll enjoy it, but it's not amazing. The ABV isn't as well hidden as it could be; but it does result in a pleasant warming effect."
"Average drinkability, not my favorite Belgian Ale."
"Very enjoyable beer. I'm more of a hop bomb fan, but I respect the sheer quality of this beer."
"A well rounded and flavourful offering; fitting the role of being Duvel's little brother nicely. Harmony is struck between flavour and drinkability with a relatively low ABV and tasty Belgian yeast and the frutiness it imparts. This leaves me looking forward to their Brune and Tripel I've got sitting in my fridge."
"Drank this one at Flying Saucer in Houston on Pint Night. Beautiful glass, great beer. Wish I would of had a steak to eat with this beer. Light, but still with flavor, refreshing and almost felt like it cleansed my pallet between sips. Good caramel look smell and taste. Pleasing and cannot wait to try some of the other beers that Maredsous offers."
"The foam was light wheat in color, lacey and creamy. the color was a red golden honey. The smell was a light brisk pils, wheaty and hoppy. The taste - light, brisky, heavy wheat with a hoppy feel and a light fruity undertone. Mouthfeel - smooth and somewhat heavy. Drinkability - Not too bad. Good session."
"Quaffable, this beer. Not as harsh with the spices & carbonation as I would have expected, and instead the malts provide a mellow vanilla & toasted biscuit profile that backs a gentle, floral hopping. Clean finish with a flash of ethanol and pepper. Mouthfeel is neat and crisp, with a medium-thin body. Overall, this is a tasty, albeit simple Blonde ale. Worth a try."
"An enjoyable hoppy Belgian pale ale, very easy to drink."
"Pours a clear, dark goldan orange colour with a decent amount of head. Tastes of sweet candied sugars with some dark fruit lingering in the finish. Its almost a little too sweet though. Drinks down pretty good overall, but its not overally great. Not terrible either though."
"Poured a dark brown in color with orange reddish highlights that had a thin head and left a little frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma had nice belgian yeast notes with dark fruit, brown sugar, and slight booze. The taste also had huge sweet malt and belgian yeast flavors with pruny dark fruit brown sugar accents. The brew was full in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty,yeasty, dark fruity, and sticky finish. It drank quite well and was a solid brew from maredsous. They haven't dissapointed me."
"I'd get again but not a unique beer or a panty dropper."
"I drink a 330ml bottle. slight smell with the white head. The taste begin with light sweet and finish with a little bit bitter. Generally speaking , this is a cleanly feeling of taste beer between Belgian and German hefewisen flavor."
"D - Fairly high drinkability. Not an amazing BPA but I've had much worse. I could have a few no problem."
"D - A solid BPA but a bit lacking in character. Taste is solid without doing anything unusual or special."
"D- Nice flavor, and pretty light for a Belgian. I could see myself having a few of these. A good example of the style, but nothing to blow you away."
"Drinkability: In most abbey style ranges the enkel is overlooked in favour of the stronger Dubbel and Tripel styles, but it's fairly simple flavour and lower strength make it a great, refreshing drinking beer."
"D: All day long in the summer. While i prefer darker, more substantial beers, I wouldn't turn this down."
"Creamy, nearly fully textured up front, the beer fades quickly into a thinning (somewhat watery) feel barely into the mid palate, leaving a large portion of the session flat. But after that, the beer finishes with a whispering evaporative feel that efforlessly lifts from the mouth surfaces and making it easy to drink."
"D: it's an OK beer but with lots of other beers in the same style and price range, i'll probably not be returning here super soon"
"11.2oz bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Bottle conditioned. Poured a lighter gold with a finger of big bubbled white head. Fruity aroma with some Belgian yeast spice. Light to medium bodied. Fair amount of noble hop bitterness. Lightly spicy. A little citrus. Nothing earth shattering, but very refreshing and drinkable."
"Always enjoyable."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a big white head. In the aroma, dry candy sugar and quite flowery. In the taste, flowery and yeasty. A smooth and medium to light mouthfeel, with a semi dry yeasty to clean aftertaste. Nice blonde, but bigger than most."
"D - dry crisp good summer beer not overly comeplex but great in this ridiculously humid weather."
"It is a solid pale ale, one that I would go back to, and one that s fairly cheap as well."
"O: Remember it as better on tap. Otherwise good for the price."
"Drinkability: A run of the mill blonde but a decent session beer. A bit tame for the style but enjoyable nonetheless.-"
"With a good mouthfeel and a good drinkability it is a blond which is worth to try."
"O: Okay, but not great. Definitely unique."
"Notes: It is a very enjoyable Blonde for sure with nice balance of malt and hops."
"This thing drinks a little too easily for being 6%. It would be quite easy to go through 2 bombers of this one!"
"D - This is a very nice Belgian pale. Good character and flavor."
"Poured into the branded Maredsous Chalice. Pours a golden-orange colour. Lots of white, foamy head, with tons of bubbles. Lots of lacing too. Smells yeasty, but I'm not getting too much else. The taste has some sweetness to it, with a little bit of hop bitterness. Pleasant enough, but certainly not my favourite from the style. Nice carbonation level."
"Drinkability: refreshing and easy drinking, would definitely get again."
"Mighty easy drinking, particularly when consumed in a relative beer wasteland (Thailand) where macro-lagers are king. I may have overrated as a result, but this is a solid brew regardless of where you enjoy it."
"D: This was very thirst quenching. I would definitely have it again if I was in the mood for something Belgian that's sweet, light, and refreshing."
"the taste is superb its crisp pale malts balanced with some citrus hops mixed in with yeast some bananas clove and rounded out with sweet caramel..this is a classic so delicate so smooth yet it is just full of flavor as it warms the clove and yeast just add to the taste..its a medium mouth full but full flavored..i can drink this first or last or anytime in between..delicious well made highly recommended"
"I was really pleasantly surprised by Maredsous 6. I was expecting an average offering, but instead was really wowed. I really appreciate the attention to detail with this one. It doesn't try to impress with a high abv. or overly intense flavors. Instead it excels at offering the most accessible, but complex and enjoyable experience I could imagine from a Belgian Pale Ale. $8.99 @ Joe Canals."
"single from Whole Foods, Fair Lakes, VA"
"D - Not a style that I generally prefer. This one is ok, but not a beer that I would buy again."
"A good solid well balanced Belgian beer."
"D: A very good BPA, nice flavours, good feel. I liked this lighter offering from the House of the Great Duvel."
"M & D - Good CO2 balance and a nice refreshing medium-light body. Refreshing and lower ABV make this a nice session BPA. Good spring and summer beer."
"D - not bad. lacks character."
"D: A decently drinkable ale by Maredsous. I haven't explored this brewer too much and I've been meaning to try the Tripel and Dubbel also."
"Reddish-orange with a good-sized off-white head which fades quickly and leaves a dotted lace behind. A pleasant yeasty and phenolic aroma floats out of the snifter, making itself evident without any effort. Closer inspection reveals some malts and mild hops with some vinegar, grass and caramel in the background. Tastes malty and spicy and goes down dry with some distant hops biting at the back of the throat. Some citrus notes linger. Medium-bodied and fairly well-carbonated. I wouldn't mind if there was a bit more going on in the taste department, but find it hard to complain too much. Good brew."
"D: Good, but nothing exceptional. At the price I paid for it I could say I would buy it again."
"Drinkability: Weighing in with an ABV of 6.00% and given its distinct Belgian characters, I wouldn't consider this a session, nor would I reach for it on a hot summer's day. However, I would reach for this beer in the winter; not as a winter warmer but instead as a beer to bring alcohol-enabled warmth to your chest when you look out the window on a cold winter's night. Sit too close to the fire though, and you'll feel the heat!"
"Nose pretty cool that reminds dairy, it is very soft mouth, good malty and quite bubbly. The finish, but really the end, spicy flavors leaves (cilantro) and a little acidity. A very pleasant beer tasting and, moreover, has a great balance. Another excellent beer from brewery Duvel Moortgat. Great."
"D - pretty easy, as you'd think, but foamy"
"D: easy drinking here. Quite sessionable, a very pleasant drink on the whole."
"This is a pretty solid rendition of a Belgian Pale. Certainly not a beer that will blow you away, but pleasantly flavourful, balanced and ideal for a refreshing drink. Nice stuff."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. A malty start with the usual belgian characteristics: honey sweet, candy suger bubblegum malt; fruity (banana, tropical) and floral. These are the same tones as found in the aroma (which does have a tiny bit of earthy funkiness). The carbonation is fine and at a medium level that I like. There's low bitterness but the aftertaste with some citric peel but it also has some slight cardboard tones - but not enough to discredit this beer."
"Very floral and hoppy smell a hint of lemon and pineapple. Taste is a slightly honey sweet malt with strong bitterness. I find the bitterness is a bit overpowering but nevertheless, a nice little Belgian style. I personally don't think i would have this again, i prefer other blond Belgians like Duval."
"This beer just goes down so easily. It's not the most complex or interesting Belgian out there, but what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in sheer refreshment and drinkability. This beer would be an ideal summer beer or something to drink after a day out hiking."
"Pours into a Maredsous chalice clear gold with an inch of sticky white foam initially, but hazes up with the last few drops. Nose is floral with a bare hint of funk, and some tropical fruit. Sweet, lightly bitter flavour. Ample apple and and again, tropical fruitiness. Finishes with a yeasty, characteristic Belgian flavour and bitter orange. Quite a soft and creamy mouthfeel on this with a moderate carbonation. Mostly a typical Belgian blonde, but with a bit heavier flavour and body. Quite nice and amply drinkable."
"Drinkability: while it's not my favorite, it's still a perfectly respectable beer. Perhaps without the light sourness it would rate much higher."
"D: The light body and relatively low ABV make this beer an easy drinker. The flavor has a nice complexity that grows as it warms. My only wish would be for a bit more carbonation. Overall, a solid choice."
"Has a thick dry, carbonated mouthfeel, almost like ginger ale, very dry indeed. Meh, I wouldn't bother trying this again."
"D-An enjoyable beer of simple elegance that I would buy again."
"D: A very good beer that might be more drinkable than the double or tripel. It has almost the same flavor profile as their other beers only scaled way back, which makes it more drinkable, but the carbonation level keeps it from being a session beer."
"D: with the 6% it goes ok on a nice warm day. A nice one to drink."
"This was a good beer but it really tasted more like a blonde than a belgian pale. I actually didn't have that strong a belgian character. It was, however, a very good and refreshing beer with good malt character, good carbonation and decent flavor and drinkability."
"I must say it s not my favourite from Maredsous but very drinkable in all. I think however that in all it s a bit too carbonated and it makes you burp quite a lot."
"I like it. But I wouldn't go out of my way for more."
"D= A very drinkable and enjoyable ale. Highly sessionable! I'm not saying they are the same, but if you like Orval you should try this."
"Easy drinking, solid belgian Pale."
"The tatse is a little complex with sweet start and bitter finish, not really what I was expecing. Nothing special that I'd get again."
"A good drinking beer with some kick but not the knock down power of it's big brothers."
"D-...This brew is very enjoyable and quite drinkable. It would make a fine session brew, keeping me on my toes with the inherent fun of its flavors. If only it weren't quite so pricy."
"I'm fairly ignorant about Belgian beer but I've been experimenting with some of the lower strength varieties lately (I tend to steer clear of anything over about 7.5%) and I have to say I really liked Maredsous Blonde. I poured into a big Duvel glass, the colour was a cloudy amber, and the head was great - nice and thick. The smell was rich and pleasant and similar to other Belgian pales (yeasty!). The taste was dry and spicy with no discernible alcohol and it went down very easily. In terms of taste and smell, it's a first cousin of Orval and I'll definitely be having it again."
"Maredsous 6 poured a cloudy amber with a large tan head and excellent lacing. The smell was of yeast and hops. The taste was bready sweet. Some citrus notes as well from the hops. Mouthfeel was good crisp and carbonated. Drinkability was good as well. This was a great beer. Reminded me of Orval, but a bit sweeter. Very nice ale that I will look for again."
"D: A nice blond belgian beer that is very affordable (in Sweden the alkohol is highly taxed and I both this for only 16,40 SEK - about $2). If you find this one - buy it!"
"Update: 2nd tasting got wax and grain on the nose with spiced honey notes. Straight ahead blonde; there are better out there."
"D=very good and definitely a tasty beer, drinkability is high with moderate alcohol content and a light feel."
"It's pretty good overall, but not outstanding."
"On-tap at the Bryant Lake Bowl in Minneapolis. $6 for a 10 oz pour. Appears a mostly clear amber-orange with a short head. You know, it was a nice Belgian, but it was very plain - just smooth sweet bready and light caramel with a hit of Belgian spice. You really expect more from a good Belgian. Drinkable, but for $6 I want a better beer."
"drinkability is good. really liked the aroma and was slightly let down by the taste, but it's still a well balanced and pretty solid beer."
"Pours clear golden color with one finger white head. Smell - extensive plum-like fruitiness hits nose at first, then maltiness, very soft pleasant aroma. Taste - wow, I haven't had belgium for a while. Malts, some plums, raisins, some pleasant bitterness in the back. Very good carbonation, light, easy drinker, great beer. Very enjoyable. Thanks a lot Rob!"
"If this beer was a singer it would be somewhere in the Barry Manilow/Billy Joel/ Elton John range. Nothing to make you say WOW, but it has moments of excellence and there's nothing offensive going on. I'd have wished for a tad more strength in the aroma and taste areas, but even so I'd happily have this one again."
"Feel and Drinkability: As aforementioned this one is bone dry. Body is light and carbonation is higher giving this one a cleansing feel on the palate. With the real dry character of this beer I feel that the higher levels of carbonation help to offset the dryness as well as to bring out the fruitiness in here. Overall everything works real well toghether, feel and taste each work to make this beer the most it can be. This is a finely crafted beer."
"The taste and feel, though, are rather weak. Overall, it is mostly the character of dry, bland, faintly bitter lemon soda with hints of yeast and raisiny alcohol. It starts slightly more raisiny and with a fairly strong grain quality that takes over at the finish and in the aftertatse on the first couple sips, but these elements vanish rapidly. Soon it has almost no aftertaste at all and just is dry and bland from start to finish. It seems rather fizzy and a bit watery, too. However, it is decent to drink and rather refreshing in a way."
"Quite drinkable for the style, a very sessionable Belgian Pale."
"Overall, a pretty solid and sessionable Belgian."
"In its' own glass. Poured brilliant gold-honey hue until I deposited the last ounce from the bottle which clouded it up and gave it a murky orange glint. The head was off-white and foamy with nice lacing and staying power. The smell made me think of corn syrup, yeast, honey, soda biscuit. Refreshing tartness in the taste, sour flash here and there and over ripe fruit hints with yeast backdrop. Neither bitterness nor malt predominant, citrus and spice was in the mix but muted. I would definately think this was Belgian but not the best example of the style, still well worth trying. I still have the 8 and the 10 from the LCBO gift pack to try so I'll look forward to that!"
"D--ok sipper. not much more to say."
"Medium bodied with a perky, persistent carbonation. This is a superb Belgian sessioner with a good deal of depth and change throughout. It's probably my favorite of the Maredsous line. It's always great to find these massively drinkable and enjoyable smaller Belgians."
"Pours a clear light orange/amber, very big and fluffy thick white head forms, drops a nice sheet of lacing on the glass, settles to a thin ring and layer, nice retention. Smell is nice, very clean and aromatic, some honey, bread, light floral, some tropical fruit, and candi sugar. Taste is nice, light cracker and banana, tropical fruit, honey sweetness, a bit of orange peel and citrus, with light spice near the finish, sugary, but quite dry in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, very smooth and drinkable Belgian pale. Nothing exciting but solid."
"The taste is a slight dissapointment after the smell. The carbonation is a bit high and hides some of the flavors. Otherwise there are lots of citrus fruits and a quite yeasty aftertaste. A nice touch of hops round of the taste in the same way as the smell."
"meh... kind of average..."
"Drinkability: I've had me a few, and so shall you! This is a OK Belgian Pale Ale, quite interesting primarily due to its aftertaste."
"Best head ever. Poured clear gold with a thick, frothy white head. Aroma of yeast, candy sugar, and spice. Taste was very understated. Typical Belgian-sweet, with a nice malty back. More yeast ester flavors as the beer warms and settles. Light mouthfeel."
"A decent BPA. Not very bold and anemic in the hop department, but tastey and easy to quaff nonetheless."
"I don't know what gives - I've enjoyed this beer on many spread out occasions before tonight, but sitting down with it now I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed. I'll be sure my scores reflect a medium, but as far as blonds of this milieu go, this failed to set itself apart. I still love the Maredsous series, but will definitely have the 8 and 10 ahead of this in the lineup."
"Overall, this has to be my favorite in the Maredsous range. I would certainly recommend."
"I really like this one. Good stuff."
"Smell is rather weak and mostly floral sweetness, with addition of citrus. Taste is spicy with some nice sourness, high carbonation as well. Aftertaste is a pleasant mix of bitterness and sweetness, but bitterness is more pronounced. It is quite light and refreshing drink."
"d: a good belgian but i was a little disappointed because of the hype"
"This is a very nice beer. Perhaps not as intense and/or flavorful as the 8 and 10, but a solid beer at a manageable abv. Cheers!"
"My beer poured a deep clear golden color with a thick one inch head and an off white color. Nice froathy bubbles in the body. The nose was malty, sweet and the taste was more of the same with some citrus notes and a hop presence. Medium body and easy drinking."
"Drinkability : une bonee bière dans le style Belgian pale ale"
"This is a pleasant Belgian offering, on the lighter side but still very flavorful."
"Not a beer I'll be rushing back for. Hope the other 2 offerings are better."
"all in all, it is still a very good beer; not great but I will call this an 8.5."
"A tasty and very sessionable belgian pale ale, def. worth a go"
"On the whole a good beer with decent drinkability that is both worth a try and the price. A great accompaniment with a variety of food from fried polenta with cheese to Belgian waffles with chocolate syrup. Both of which I have paired it with at Belgian Beer Café in Barra de Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro."
"Remarkable beer. And unlike other Belgian blondes, not cloying or heavy. I could drink this all afternoon."
" However when drinking I felt a very light beer, with a small barley taste. Bitter-like mouthfeel, goes down too fast. I honestly expected a heavier-bodied beer for its smell and ABV (6%) but I found it very light and easygoing."
"D - It's certainly worth a go, and in my opinion is easily the best of the Maredsous offerings."
"D: Approachable & engaging, but I don't think I could session it."
"Overall - A pretty good beer... Definitely worth a try..."
"In terms of flavor, there's not a great deal to deal with. It's a bit spicy, which is pretty cool, but the hops never enter the scene in a dashing fashion, leaving much to be desired in the end result."
"This is a very good, well made beer. It is high quality, just not exactly to my taste, but still very enjoyable as well as being a joy to look at. Worth whatever they're charging."
"BB 12-2007 Great poorout with huge head forming and forever lasting and leaving beautifull patterns on the glas. Nose is very fruity mostly strawberry but also litle malts but overal light. Taste is lot better with good strong maltynes, alcoholic bite, fres and fruity with blackcurrant note and good but moderate bitterness. Litle sweetness cause of fruityness but overal dry caracter. Great carbonisation makes with taste a good mouthfeel and easily drinkable."
"Had again 4 years later, a foamer, and bitter more than sweet and drying, a steady blond."
"Nothing special or overly intresting but still a well-made and solid abbey blonde. There are much better beers available in this style though. (St. Feuillien, Florival)"
"The first taste that hits the mouth is alcohol. But that is soon replaced wit ha mild bitterness combined with a balanced maltiness. Bitter hops and a fruity note of green apples dominate the aftertaste."
"A nice Belgian Blonde. More orangey-gold than blond in colour. Yeasty, orange-rind nose, lightly flowery. Flavour is dry, citric and lightly spicy, yeasty. Pretty faultless, and easy to get along with. Soft, round, balanced, with an interesting yeasty/spicey character, pretty much how i like my paler Belgian ales to be, very tasty."
"A bottle of Maredsous Blonde 6 is quite expensive here in Korea - costing 4000 won."
"75cl bottle: This pours a golden, yellow color. There was a huge white head. Some lacing. It is also a bit fizzy. The aroma is slightly malty. Is this going to be a Belgian attempt at a macro? Maybe not. Some faint floral notes and fruit in there also. A lighter malt sweetness than you usually get with the Abbey style. Some yeastiness and breadiness to the taste. Maybe a few faint fruits also. Good, but a little light."
"Not an incredibly memorable beer--but highly enjoyable to drink. I could drink many I imagine."
"Decent beer, part of a Maredsous 6/8/10 sampler pack. Gotta go investigate another."
"Nice."
"It comes in a large brown bottle with a thin neck and bulbous top. It pours a muddy copper with an overly big beige head. The head may be a result of all that pent up effervescence trying to funnel through that thin bottleneck. The aroma of malt, hops, yeast and alcohol (Hmmm, the ingredients) are not all that obvious and fades with the head. The medium malt body contains a lightly sour yeasty flavor, a mild sweetness and an astringent and lightly citrus bitterness. It's just a tad watery and lacking in upfront aromas and flavors, but I like it...and it blends and balances towards the end of the glass."
"Overall, very disappointing. I will try another, but it will be very difficult to obtain for me."
"Came out a deep clear orangish gold under a firm but bubbly off white head, which lingered well and left some very good lace. The nose was fruity sweet, while the mouth was (too) heavily carbonated but light in texture. The initial taste has the typical francophone fruity sweetness. The hops come on strong soon thereafter, though, leaving a very crisp, just this side of harsh impression. The aftertaste is mildly bitter, but a bit thinner than I would prefer. Overall an excellent beer, but still missing something."
"Had this on tap at the Half Moon in Kennett Square,a real nice golden/orange color with a very sticky head,very fruity aroma of banana and a slight pineapple aroma.Taste is slightly yeasty with some nice fruity tones almost to easy to drink.Seeing I was on the roof outside drinking this it seemed to go down even easier.Real nice."
"Count me in. Only draw back is the price but I think it's worth it on this one."
"The pour a nice golden-orange color, moderate sized head, frothy, brilliant white color, fine sheets of lace to coat the glass. Nose is sweetly fruity like a ripe banana, malt, citrus, and quite pleasant. Begins sweet, top has a moderate mouth feel. The finish is modestly acidic, pleasantly hopped, quite dry aftertaste. As for me, I normally don't care for ""Blondes"" at least where beer is concerned!!!, but I find this one quite quaffable."
