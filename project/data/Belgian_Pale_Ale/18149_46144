I really want to try a fresh bottle of this since I could see the particular Brett character working well with the hops.  Alas, the bottle was this old when I found it on the shelf.  Hasn't developed poorly in the bottle since the Brett was able to let go over time but the hops sure have faded to almost nothing.","Immortale25","Nov 01, 2014"

Perhaps more similar to a Farmhouse/ Saison than a Belgian Pale Ale, but nonetheless, it is incredible. Reminds me a bit of Orval, just not as complex and intense.

Pours a quite hazy medium golden amber with a massive, half glass white head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy, pillowy lacing. Aroma of bready malt, slight dry white wine, hints of clove and slight wild yeast and funk. So far the funk level is just right. Flavor is much more funky barnyard up front with moderate brett, developing unusual sweet / dry malt, lemon citrus; slightly floral and vinous. Finishes with dry brett and light hop bitterness. Light bodied, but nice mouthfeel from active carbonation. I never know what to expect from brett influenced Belgian and saison type beers; I'm not a fan of intense funkiness, wild yeast nor sourness. This ale has a distinct funkiness, but all the flavors are nicely balanced and lightly influential, and I really enjoyed it. Lighter than expected, but well made and enjoyable.","LiquidAmber","May 14, 2013"

I'm pretty let down by this beer, I as came in with high expectations, but this beer certainly didn't come close to meeting them. Definitely stick with Rayon Vert for an interesting American take on a Belgian Pale Ale hit with Brettanomyces.","flayedandskinned","May 05, 2013"

Very large puffy white head. Hard to keep it under control during the pour. The aroma has a big dose of soft funk on top of fresh grain. Very pleasant. It smells like a tropical fruit barnyard. Flowers, leather, mangoes, mushrooms and earth. Wonderful brett notes. Very mild medicinal character. Seemed a bit strong, at first, but it settled into the rest of the beer after a minute. The taste starts with fruity grain sweetness before drying out with funk and adding a touch of lemony tartness. Lots of funky, fruity brett flavor. Mushrooms, lemons, barnyard. I try not to avoid esoteric notes, but it sorta tastes like unripe kiwi. Finishes quite dry with medium to mild bitterness. Grassy hops. Effervescent mouthfeel at first. Definitely reminds me of other brett beers. Personally, I prefer it with a bit less gas, and the carbonation fades quite quickly. Pretty smooth feel after a minute, actually. Otherwise, it's light but full on the palate. Very well suited to the beer and style. No booze. Exceptionally easy to drink. Wonderful balance. This is the sort of beer that I would drink be happy to drink regularly. Surprisingly good price, too, particularly compared to most recent TLA bottles. Anyway, I'm quite impressed by this one.

I was never amazed with the regular devotion, but with the brett addition here the beer is entirely transformed. the pour is thick and hazy pale straw color with an inch of white head and amazing lacing. the nose is funky from the brett, not sour at all, but somehow very wild and farmy, summery, harvest time, I don't know, its fresh and its old world. pale malted barley and wheat malt, and a decent hopping, more than I remember in the regular devotion. the brett yeast really makes the flavors come together, tons of hay and cut grass, and a little citrus before the hop bitterness kicks in. awesome mouthfeel, really bright on the tongue, with very active carbonation and a lighter body that feels bigger than it is.

The nose has a brilliant Brett character with pineapples, tart fruit, spicy cloves, white pepper. I don't think I've had the base beer, but the Brett has completely covered it up. Some honey is present too. The palate opens way too sweet, almost like someone dumped some Splenda or Equal in this beer. Again, there's a blend of white pepper, clove and pineapple. Very highly carbonated, this beer is a little too spicy and a little too sweet for my liking. Decent.","DefenCorps","May 05, 2012"

On the palate, this one is medium bodied, complex and refreshing, with bretty fun and flavors of freshly ground black pepper, crisp, juicy apples and pears, Belgian yeast and some candi sugar. ™","emmasdad","Dec 08, 2010"
4.25,10.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Thanks to Chad for sharing this! Pours a murky straw color with a small white head. Scent is a lot of Brett, Belgian yeast and pepper. Other spices as well. Taste is somewhat salty initially, followed immediately by Belgian yeast and slightly tart green apples. Then I get some orange and lemon peel. Lovely pepper flavors matched with Brett. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly drinkable. Overall, this is a better version of the original Devotion. I wish they replaced it with this.","DovaliHops","Nov 14, 2010"

4.05,4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger of head and left nice frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The funky musty brett and belgian yeast aromas dominate the nose alongside some spice, slight citrus, faint grassy, and apple notes. The taste also has the belgian yeast character but the musty funky breet is not as potent but is well balanced with citrus, spice, and slight clove accents. Honestly the flavor leans more towards a saison with brett. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, spice, musty funky, and bubbly finish. It drank pretty good but like I mentioned its probably better categorized as a saison. I still was glad that I had the opportunity to try this beer and a variation of the devotion.","Gobzilla","Sep 18, 2010"

Very faint brett, but it is there (even though I accidentally sat on this one for a while). Nice belgian pepper/spice element, but not enough funky brett. A bit sweet. Very drinkable.

3.38,-12.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"750 ml corked and caged bottle courtesy of brotherliam, thanks again for trading me this bottle Bill, drank tonight from my Kapittel goblet, color is a golden orange with some lighter tones, two inch fluffy white head that lasted a few minutes, appearance was nice except for the sediment floating around from the top six or seven ounces from the bottle, could have excused that if it was from the bottom but it was not, aroma consists of apples, yeast, caramel, herbal accents, lemon, orange, sugars, earthiness, mild funk, and grapefruit, taste starts off with dryness and is rather yeasty from the get go, some citrus in the middle but still very dry, finishes dry as well with earthiness and what seemed like hibiscus even though there is no flowers in here to my knowledge, warms up with green apples and sweeter funk with that same dryness, dry, flowery, and yeasty mouthfeel, medium bodied, tons of carbonation, gushed a little bit when the cork popped, taste lingered a long time with the dryness, could have drank the bottle probably but pretty filling considering its ABV, too dry with misplaced heavy sweetness at times, not the smoothest Belgian style beer out there, the brettanomyces will probably develop more as time goes on but it is already starting to really dry things out, Devotion is not one of my favorite beers to begin with but this helps a little bit in some areas, not too bad, worth trying","Floydster","Apr 30, 2009"

4.17,8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a semi-cloudy sunset gold with a two finger bright white head that falls to a thin layer of foam. A decent amount of spiderweb looking lace holds on to the sides of the glass. Aroma consists of pear, apple, and light yeasts. A good amount of brett, honey, and grass as well. Taste begins crazy bretty with big musty hay flavors and dry farm blankets. Midway a touch of honey sweetness emerges but is quickly taken back by the sharp lemony hops. Aftertaste is pretty funky and dry with some zestiness lingering. Light fluffy body with a crisp feel and active carbonation (woo hoo!!). Pretty easy going down, I definitely prefer this to original version. I'd love to see what some age would do to the brett. Overall, good brew for sure.","BeerTruth","Feb 27, 2009"

4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"this one is easy to drink, downed the whole 750 in no time due to only being 6%.

Smells lightly lemony and grassy, and slightly metallic on the finish. This Brett is still young, and this should sour up and become more complex over time. Tastes quite bitter and somewhat funky with a nice earthiness and a little funky, but nbot sour at all. Smooth, bitter, and earthy in the mouth, with a slightly stinging bitterness that lingers. Nice, but will probably get better.","Georgiabeer","Jan 13, 2009"
4.27,10.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: A tasty upgrade to the standard Devotion. The somewhat more subtle Brett addition allows for some fine penetrating complexities without losing sight of the original beer or suffering from lack of drinkability.","ChainGangGuy","Jan 12, 2009"

The carbonation is very good.","HopHead84","0"
