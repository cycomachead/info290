"Wow there's a lot of caramel here that does not belong. I guess you can't rate against a style that is the invention of a corn busting macro."
"This beer was fairly disappointing. It looks ok, but perhaps was stored too long."
""
""
""
"Decent blue moon option. There are better ones out there"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly a below average beer."
""
"Bright amber color, good sized head and lacing. Fruity aroma, some dust and yeast. Flavor is bread, yeast, odd aftertaste. Overall, ok beer but I wouldn't drink another and probably won't finish this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It looked right, smelled right, but was super bitter and ultimately not worth finishing.  It didn't taste like a belgium pale ale.  Overwhelmingly sour and one dimensional.  The sourness overtook the hops substantially. I might've gotten a bad bottle and will re-review if I get another bottle."
""
""
""
""
"pretty good...would do again."
""
"I really liked it and Heather liked it"
""
""
"Smelled and looked good.. Unsuspected bitter rotten fruit taste.. Too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Better than I expected.  I might not buy it again, but I wouldn't necessarily turn one down.  A decent example of a Belgian Pale Ale.  Much better than Blue Moon's take on a witbier."
""

""
""
""
""
"Very good! Loved it! Surprised I liked it so much! Not bitter smooth but flavorful! Didn't taste the orange! Which is good because I don't like orange beer!"

"I actually liked this one, probably my favorite Blue Moon to date"

"not my favorite blue moon by any imagination."
""
"I liked it for a basic beer, not hard to find and decent flavor. A bit of a heavy pour but a good taste, and nice long finish. Not that sweet compared to Blue Moon's other offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Spicy nose over fruit, mostly orange with some floral, herbal spice. Pours brilliant amber under a snow white, clingy 2"" foam cap. Palate is primarily fruit - orange with some herbal and spice notes but lacks depth and character. Also has a little sweetness that needs something to balance it."
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer.  All of these blue moon beers seem to have a similar background taste with slight variations on different styles.  You can definitely tell that this is a macro-brewery disguising as a craft but at least they are trying."

"this is pretty bad. well, i shouldnt say bad, its just so overly safe and dumbed down from real belgian pales as to be a new style entirely, really frustrating that people out there who dont know any better think this is craft belgian pale, man are they missing something. its got a really subtle belgian yeast nose, and even less on the taste, just a slight sharp white wine acidity and fruit complexion. the malt base is super light, too light really, and all the hops ever are is a balancing bitterness with a light grassy character, but basically no hop flavor. its just such a simplified version of a great style in all three aspects that its disappointing to me. weird grain funk in the middle of this and it doesnt go well with the yeast. it tastes and feels like it was fermented too warm, and its just not real nice overall. one thing that does work though is the carbonation. its dry and fizzy and full of life, which is its best feature by far. overall this may get a few people into the style, but its so safe and bland that i really dont care for it at all."
""
"My BA profile says I've not yet reviewed a Belgian pale.  However, I've definitely drank a few of this style.  I'm not sure how true-to-style this beer is, but it is definitely flavorful and easy drinking.  Purchased as part of a Fall variety 12 pack.  This beer is one of the better ones in the pack."

"Overall an OK brew.  A nice fall beer.  I'd have it again."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty bad at first. Gets better as it warms, but still has an odd, stale cardboard character to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: It's good. To my surprise this is actually a nicely done pale ale. Nothing great, but much better than I expected. As with all things macro-brewed, the taste has been muted."

"I was surprised by this macro version of the Belgian Pale Ale. It poured a dark slightly cloudy brown with a medium head. The aroma was fruity with caramel and that mouthwatering Belgian aroma. The taste was great with caramel, earthy hops, moderately sweet malt and a hint of banana esters. Although I am not usually a big fan of this style, I enjoyed this one from a sampler pack at a neighborhood pig roast and would definitely purchase a case if it is affordable."

"Overall: Worse than the regular Blue Moon (which I actually don't stick my nose up at) because of the weird, astringent earthiness. Would not recommend."
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing to write home about, but if it was between this and domestic American adjunct lagers, I would take this every time with a grin on my face. Its pretty light, easy to drink, and doesn't really offend. Unfortunately it doesn't impress or stand out either, so I wouldn't seek this out."

"Overall: A somewhat tepid offering by a large international brewery. I love Blue Moon, but this one isn't nearly as good. While it had some potential in the burnt/caramel notes, the malt isn't strong enough to stand up to the bitter citrus and carbonation of this brew. I probably won't buy this again, and would choose the original blue moon over this variety anyway of the week."

"Clear amber pour with an average head that rapidly diminishes. Lacing retention is poor. Nose is light but has citrus and caramel notes. Light medium bodied with a normal carbonation level that produces some effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is nice and well balanced. It begins with a light citrus note that flows into an equally light caramel sweetness. The finish is somewhat crisp, but has a lingering spiciness that is nice. A solid session/ lawnmower beer."

"I enjoyed this beer. I think it was tasty and full of flavor. It wasnt the BEST tasting beer ive had, but it was really good. I got it in the Sampler Pack and it was the first one i pulled out. I could defiantly taste the orange peel in it. Blue Moon is great at making tasty beers. cheers"

"Pours a golden brown color with a thin head. The aroma is of honey,caramel and malts. The flavor matches the aroma by being dominated by the honey and caramel flavors.. I found this beer to be perfectly sweet and really enjoyed it only wish the winter sampler had come with more."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, itâ€™s not a bad beer but also nothing special."
""
""
"Musty malts, dirty grains, bitterness, oxidized notes, orange pith, and herbal astringencies. I'd rather not go into any more negatives. Mouthfeel, included."
""
""
""
"Taste is fairly mute with caramel malt providing the majority of the flavor, slight spiciness in the aftertaste that quickly fades, a nice creamy body exists with soft carbonation and a full feeling which is more than it deserves overall."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A bit meh for a beer, don't really care for it; but I guess I will drink it in the seasonal packs."

"This is a nice pale. It has bold deep hop flavor."
""
""
""
""
"The label says ""Belgian Style Pale"" and I guess that's supposed to mean Belgian style pale ale. It doesn't remind me too much of the real Belgian Pale Ales I've had, nor some of the better efforts to copy the style from other countries. Still, it's an ok beer, just not too remarkable. Poured it slightly warm with a huge, foamy, frothy, thick, cream-colored head that soon settles and good lace. Color is a clear orange amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is bark, old wood, cardboard, with a hint of malt and spice. Flavor's like nose, more intense, malt really comes out, tang of course, bit of bitter and some sweet along with some medicinal. Body is big and full but at first has a powerful warming despite its strength, medicinal component leaves an unpleasant lingering bitterness. Finish is as stated, like flavor, and would be much better with popcorn or something to cancel the off flavors."

"Overall: Drinkable, but another not so impressive beer from Blue Moon (Coors)."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and slight yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a below average beer that is fairly drinkable but there is nothing that stands out as memorable about this one."

"Overall, this is an acceptable beer, but not by much. I canâ€™t handle the sweetness for very long, but I know some people who will enjoy it for that same reason. Just keep that in mind if you try it- if balance is your preference, it wonâ€™t measure up, but if you like the taste of malt sugars, you may fall in love."

"The color is a pale orange, like watered-down Tang. Extra points from me for a quarter-inch head that maintains throughout most of the session and for some minimal lacing. Not much happening in a good way in the smell department at all: some sourness, a bit of malt, mashed root veggies. So I stopped smelling this one. The taste is alright: starts off on the sweeter side with some faint citrus and malt, finishes a bit dry with some allspice and cloves, then more sweetness. Apparently, there is hibiscus in this beer. Now I had a tequila-hibiscus cocktail a few years ago that was just sublime. But the hibiscus in this beer is burred, which is a shame. It's a drinkable beer for sure, not too bubbly, a nice velvety texture at times. It warms well, too."

"Overall: It sure looked pretty in my tulip, and the smell was inviting, but there wasnâ€™t anything in the pint to live up to these expectations. I guess I didnâ€™t hate it, but I certainly didnâ€™t love it either (3/5)."

"O- a somewhat flavourful brew; to bad that I enjoy what it brings to the table."
""
"Pours to a half inch head that falls to a thin layer of foam that is permanent. Color is light amber-gold. Aroma is spicy, floral, orange zest and caramel. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus and herbal notes with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is decent with moderate CO2. Overall, this Belgian Pale Ale is spicy, tangy but the flavors build up on the tongue and begin to annoy after a while. I suppose paired with the right food it would be better. To drink it for the sake of drinking beer, I'll pass."
""
""
""
"O - Never really been a big fan of Blue Moon, although I do appreciate their ambitiousness lately. This beer is mere steps from being a great beer, and things only get better with age and practice right?"
""
"Overall a tasty if somewhat mundane version of this style. Slick and smooth and quite refreshing."
""
"O - neither awful nor spectacular"
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer just isn't there. It's like a Belgo Pale on training wheels or something. From just tasting the beer I can tell that the right ingredients are in there, but just not enough of them! It's like a runner that takes the time to train for a marathon but only puts out 50% at the race. You know it's in there somewhere but....aaah! I would not recommend wasting your time on this beer."

"DATE TASTED: August 4, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky's Tavern pint... OCCASION: convincing wife Shan that ""Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives"" is a mockumentary, not a documentary ... APPEARANCE: nice, lively orange-amber body; creamy white head that settles slowly and laces surprisingly well!... AROMA: caramel malts ""round"" the fragrant flower pot hops with some doughier, breadier elements--the citrus is subdued by an oddly malty punch... PALATE: medium-bodied, oily, antagonistic in its presence--mildly sessionable, if not for its Blue Moon calling card funked up aftertaste...TASTE: mild coriander sits amid malts that belie this beer's objective; mostly caramel and a 40 oz. malt profile that kills the enjoyability for the drinker.... OVERALL: another ""miss"" from the Blue Moon Expressionist Collection, though not to the extreme of the Blackberry Wit or the Agave--still, like finding out Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives"" is not real, one feels this Belgian pale really is a distant attempt of the original..."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Tight, foamy head which leaves a foam blanket, and a bit of lacing. Nose is light with the characteristic grain attachments. Plenty of flavor components...yeast, bitter pecan shell, with some spice, and hints of sweetness. Well-balanced. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
" this resembles Killian's red from Coor's :("
""
""
"O=This did not remind me of any Belgian beer that I've tried--more like a cross between a pale ale and an amber ale...a good beer for what it is; worthy trying if offered or on tap, but I can't see me buying a 6-pack...it is slightly above average, but there are better ones out there."

"This is reminiscent of a true BPA with the malt (or whatever the hell blue moon miller coors is using in place of malt), but there isn't any Belgian yeast flavor here, probably due to blue moon coors skimping on it, and instead using their proprietary bullshit strain of whatever bullshit yeast they had lying around and were able to make a lot of for a batch of beer that would be plentiful enough to ship to all the grocery stores it could get contracts with to carry it, where it would sit on the shelf for however many months till they, the grocery store chain would be forced to sell it at a(n even more) discounted price, at which point poor schlubs like myself would take the opportunity to try it on a whim, and oh yeah, there aren't any even passable belgian pale ales on the grocery store shelf, save for the ones sam adams includes in their current variety pack in which the rest of the beers pretty much suck (read: blackberry wheat nonsense). The need is out there for a standard (american) belgian pale... However, this isn't it. ""Rounder"" may have sucked less when it was bottled, but time (and oxidation) has not been kind to this beer. I fell prey to this as I didn't have to buy an entire blue moon sampler to get to try a new beer, but this not worth it even for $7. In summary, Don't. ""Rounder"" wants to conjure up images of a young poker-playing Matt Damon (MATT. DAMON!), but sadly this beer is more akin to him and his performance in the Legend of Bagger Vance."
"This isn't a bad beer by any stretch but it certainly won't please any true Belgian beer fans. This beer doesn't have any of the great BPA flavors I would expect and want to find such as fruity esters or nice spicy notes from the yeast. This is more of a malty brew with citrusy notes from the addition of orange peel. Ultimately, this isn't a beer I would pick up if I want a true BPA, but as far as Blue Moon offerings go this one isn't too bad."
""
"O: Overall this beer was alright, not bad but not original. Still I could drink quite a few of these and I would not turn one down if I was offered."
""
"It's got both smoothness and crispness consistently in an almost, maybe even, medium body with light but steady-flowing carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty terrible and synthetic. Almost cloying and medicinal. Drain poured half the bottle. Where are the hops, where is the Belgian? Like bad fruit juice."
""
"O: Overall the flavor is quick to come and go and brief initial taste. Sweet wet lemony and a very safe play that treads lightly on the hops, lacks a strong belgian pale grain biscuity nature and has a bit to much sweet speciality grains to boot. Lacks crispness, and is about as exciting as kissing your cousin. pass. The initial brief flavor is hardly worth the price of admission as this fnishes like water off the tongue."

"12oz bottle, pours reddish-brown, tall rocky ivory head, decent head retention.  Aromas are weak with a bit of bready malt, yeast, fruity, orange.  Tastes are actualky not too bad here with notes of banana, orange, caramel, toasted grain, yeast, bread.  Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, medium bodied; finishes clean.  Overall, not too bad of a BPA, but there are much better ones out there."
"This really reminds me of their Winter Abbey Ale with a whole lot more sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad. Not something I'd seek out. But glad I tried it. Different."
"O - An enjoyable asy drinking beer. I was in the mood for a more malty type beer an this really hit the spot."
""
"My pour, followed by a patient settling, resulted in a dense two fingers of foamy, tawny head that resembled a scoop of ice cream atop a cone. Color was a button-bright copper. Nose smelled heavily of biscuit malt underlain with a light, perfume-y floweriness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was tending towards sweet, kind of light and flowery. Finish was semi-sweet, tasty, but not compelling, I would tell you that there are better iterations/ interpretations of the style out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Average at best for a Belgian. I started this beer with high hopes but it fell a little bit flat. Taste is mildly boring; slightly bitter aftertaste; really not much to it. Average...wouldn't seek this beer out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this beer has its flaws. Made by coors, it's an attempt at a macro microbrew. It felt like they were forcing a flavor that that couldn't develop quite right. There are some good points, but not redeemable. I'd rather a real microbrew chased with a coors light."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very mild, some light notes of yeast. Taste is also mild, bland and kind of boring. Some faint yeast and malts, a touch of bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall should be marketed as a Belgian Ale Light."
"Sweet lemony scent. Pours a ruddy brown with thin small whitish non lasting head. No lacing of glass. Slightly spicy cinnamon and sweet taste. Candied sweet potato beer! Funky aftertaste. Smooth overall but lacking body."

"It's nice for a sweet beer. It has sweet character. An interesting brew."

""
"O - This is a very good drinkable beer. Nothing to knock your socks off but a clean session-able beer. This is a good beer for those not ready for some of the beer extremes."
"What, no Ed Norton? No John Malkovich? Anyway, this stuff pours a sunset amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises thick toffee, Belgian yeast, light banana, candied orange peel, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, though there's less toffee (and what is there is drier than before), and there's a stronger emphasis on the spicier aspects of the Belgian yeast and the candied orange peel. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this ain't exactly a bad BPA, but it's nothing really worth revisiting. It's a tasty-enough brew to take down amidst the other offerings in the 12-pack, but it's nothing I'd really recommend on its own."

"Overall just another amber ale."
"""A drinkable but pedestrian Belgian Pale"" So true I had to lift this sentiment from another review. Best thing I could say...this would work in a maranaide for pork or chicken."
"Overall â€“ A rather tasty and quite easy drinking brew that was on the rather cheap side ($ 14 for a 12 pack sampler). A rather enjoyable brew overall."
"Very good Belgian Pale Ale. Iâ€™ve been pleasantly surprised with this Blue Moon variety 12-pack. Iâ€™d have this again for sure."
""
""
""
""
"A so-so ale, not the worst thing I've had from the Blue Moon line, but not the best either. Not terrible and easy to drink with a decent flavor. The biggest knock is there is nothing remotely Belgian about this. Even by BM standards, this is way out of the style it is classified as. If you can look beyond that, this is worth trying at least to quench your thirst."

"O. This is part of their expressionist collection. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just quite plain. Certainly if you're looking for a Belgian Pale Ale, this is not a worthy contender. But a mild beer overall. Easy to drink."
