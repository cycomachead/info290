Really not a lot going on, but simplicity sometimes hits the spot for uniqueness.  Saw this in Brussels but had no chance to try it due to all the other options.  Found this at Yorkshire Bar in Kunming, where the owner gave it to me due to his awesome service skills.","patre_tim","Sep 16, 2014"

The aroma is of sour apples, lemon peel and a grassy hay like aroma, slightly sour. The taste is bright and vibrant, lack of malt favors hurt this beer and it's too acidic for my tastes.

Aroma had a nice apricot nose with grassy herbal hops complementing the fruitiness. Flavor again fruity juice like apple tone with a mix of light hops bascially watered down hop juice just a touch of grassiness and nice bready yeast tones in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied scary how pale this is goes down really easily if only my wallet could keep up I believe it was around 8 or 10 bucks for a small chalice, and they clamied it was 10 percent abv. Carbnoation level is effervescent goes down like a glass of perry or carbonated cider. Overall impression is a decent take at a Belgian Pale, not the most complex or enjoyable version but decent.

A bit too much I would have to say. It mellows a good bit, but still remains slightly too much. Citrus is there, yes. Beyond that there isn't much. The overpowering nature of the sweetness at first sets the tone for a not so thrilling ride. Feel is full on carbonation and the liquid is slightly thin for the style. An okay beer.

Some grainy malt, light pepeery spice. A lingering dry finish. Faint alcohol with some fruity airness. What I would consider a decent aroma and mouthfeel as well.

Nose is quiet flat( maybe cause of age) having some malts but lots of esters giving it a fruity nose and a hint of hoparome. Overal not 100% fresh though. Taste is quiet dull too having some malttaste, quiet sweet, alcoholic and then going into a moderate but litle hanging bitterness.
