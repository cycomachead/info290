Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and Brett flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The beer is thick with the kind of profile for a Belgian ale that seems to be prevalent in a lot of American interpretations. Thick and somewhat clogged. I think the use of Brett here kind of adds a little complexity and pulls it away from being a one-track brew. I guess it softens things up. An alright Belgian ale. But it could be something so much more.","RblWthACoz","Jun 28, 2013"

It's strikes me as  one of many Orval-inspired beers, but just doesn't quite recapture the magical funky weirdness of the original. That said, it's an excellent beer that can be found on the shelf at pretty much any time without needing to worry about freshness, given the style. I'm sure I'll find myself drinking it again in the future.","LambicPentameter","May 29, 2013"

The nose comprises dry corn, light Brett funk, mild caramel, and a kiss of booze (you know, like that just straight-up bombed chick you've been eying for a little while, noting the number of shots o' tequila she's been rocking, who then comes up to you in a minor careening stupor and plants her tongue right in your throat...we've all been there...right?...). The taste holds notes of mild orange zest, mild caramel, light grass, and a firm stranglehold of Brett (in a good way). The body is a lithe medium, with a moderate carbonation and a bone dry finish. Overall, a nice enough Brett-infused BPA, but the smell leaves plenty to be desired, and the Brett doesn't mesh entirely well with the rest of the flavors.","TMoney2591","May 22, 2013"

The nose is relatively funky with a slight honey sweetness and a touch of spicy ethanol. The taste is definitely more farmhouse than belgian pale presenting great initial yeast/funk, mild honey and malt sweetness, balanced spice and fruit. Although the honey is present it's overpowered by the yeast until the beer has warmed well past cellar temperature. The spicy hops sit well on the palate and complement the beer's funk and sweetness. This is definitely a drinkable, age-able, balanced Belgian-style beer, but also presents a great depth and character and funk.","ThePorterSorter","May 15, 2013"

The thick, fluffy two finger clean white head has slightly above average retention and leaves behind some thin, delicate lacing. Grassy hops, mild pear, and general light earthiness. Grassy notes, very light hints of apricot, pearskin, and some accents of honey. Finishes dry and earthy with continued grassy hop notes. Light to light medium bodied with smooth, silky mouthfeel that feigns slightly heavier as the brew warms. Abundant, yet gentle carbonation. Subtlely complex and incredibly drinkable Aria joins Hommel Bier as another Perennial Belgian Pale Ale masterpiece.","chanokokoro","Apr 30, 2013"
