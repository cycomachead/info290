3.99,28.7,4,3.75,4,4.5,4,"I used to drink a lot of beer--but it was just commercial garbage like Millers or Coors. This is a Coors product, but I sure think that it's a step in the right direction. It was kind of a stepping stone for me, although a few other beers were too, namely Leinenkugels and Shock-Top. I like this beer. It's light, it's perfect for drinking when the weather is warmer. It has a nice taste that is refreshing. I love the citrus taste and the spice after taste. It's the perfect after work beer, it's what I buy for parties now, and it is the beer to get when you end up in a place that doesn't serve micros. It has a light head, which is nice when you are looking for something refreshing. It's my everyday beer now, and I really like it, but it in no way has kept me from learning more about and trying other types of beer.","llevise","Aug 04, 2013"

Hazy pale colour, with a samll head that fades to nothing in a short time, leaving a small lace. Smell of citrus and grains, with some skunky and artificial notes. Carbonation is good for a soft drink., decent and refreshing palate. Taste of citrus and some spice. And soft drink., everything very faint. Not bad for a Coors, but nothing I'll try again. And aobut the Belgian Pale Ale.... strange mis betwwen that and a Belgian White, it doesn't work.","janubio","Jul 30, 2013"

Tastes of the mildest hops I have ever witnessed. Sweet cherry follows the hops, And reminded me of a nice German dunkel. Also has a weird penny-like taste far off in the distance. The taste is very odd to say the least, Although fairly good. The mouthfeel brings out a hell of a lot of sour cherry. WAY too sour for that matter.

The first sip was actually not bad, yielding a mild, somewhat wheaty flavor with a hint of orange. The honeymoon ends there though, with subsequent sips unmasking a mishmash of dilute wheat and nickel (I don't supposed I've ever actually tasted nickel, but I expect it would taste an awful lot like this). A cheap, wheaty fog lingers in the back of the throat for way too long, and further imbibing offers little relief. The label touts cascade hops, though their presence is subtle and used to ill effect. I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this brew, but this manages to fall short of even my paltry expectations.","MaximalC","Mar 30, 2012"

This stuff pours a clear tawny-amber topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, biscuit, light greens, and a touch of orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, though the greens are joined by strong grass and light pine needles to form a gang of bittering hooligans that mess with the already kinda so-so status quo. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pedestrian BPA at best, one that tries too hard to be all Belgain-y and pale ale-y without actually succeeding much at either.","TMoney2591","Jan 17, 2012"

It seems like it would fare decently well in an Amber Ale category though. The yeast is very weak, barely adding even a modest fruit character...very un-belgian. Its a malt driven beer with a nice creamy body and adequate carbonation. I guess my scores reflect a combo of stylistic fit and plain ol enjoyability...as a BPA it would get a D, but as an Amber Ale of some sort would probably get a B.

Win some, lose some. Color was a deep-amber with NE-quality clarity (""CU -colored? Who they tryin' ta zoom?). Nose had a distinctive honey odor - could this be what the hibiscus was adding, if anything? Mouthfeel was actually pretty full, not outright creamy, but close. The taste was bland for all of the adjuncts that they mention. It was pale, all right, pale in flavor. I got a tea-like flavor in the mouth and whether it could be attributed to either the hibiscus or the hops, I do not know. Finish was grassy, somewhat tea-like, but just not a lot happening.

Usually I like to smell some hop, pine, citrus, or something with my pales...but not here.

Its amber-copper color is about right for a standard pale ale but I was hoping for something with less clarity. Caramel malts and maybe a dash of clove are evident in the aroma with a slight touch of yeast toward the back. The body comes in at around medium. Sweet malts prevail in the taste rather than the wheat, spices, and yeast elements I have come to associate with this style. But there is a slight hop bite at the end.","puboflyons","Mar 27, 2011"

Very complex flavor, but not very balanced for my preferences, which don't tend to favor overbearing hoppiness. An assault on the tongue with medium hop bitterness and overbearing grassy notes. I'm not a fan of pale ales, but I will do my best to grade within a style I'm not familiar with. I think the hoppy bitterness is probably balanced within the style (if not to my liking), with strong notes of tobacco and acetaldehyde. I imagine this would go over well with the PA crowd.

The aroma is very light, you only pick up a slight smell of hops and floral notes. The appearance isn't horrible, not much head at all, disappears quickly. But the Lacing is decent, definitely the best factor appearance wise. The taste is just like the smell, only a slight hop bite, only a tiny bit of a floral taste, you do get a nice unique taste from the hibiscus, but that is really the only redeeming factor taste wise.

Taste is mildly hopped with a nice biscuity malt backbone. Sturdy taste, more good balance. I pick up some strange sort of ham-like flavors. Feel is still a little thin, more body needed.

The buttery aroma transfers over to the taste which mingles with coriander and orange peel. Not very sweet, no evidence of any candi sugar and no yeasty flavors that you typically see in a BPA. This is more of an EPA with coriander. Some very light spicy hops in the end. The feel is light but does have some body, fizzy carbonation makes this brew drink like seltzer, finishes a bit dry.
