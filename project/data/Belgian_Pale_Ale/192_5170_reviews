"O=Probably the worst beer I've had this year...all I can think of was that it was old stock, but it was horrible."

"O - Loft has suggestions of fruit complexity but at it's core this is an easy drinking and rather simple pale ale that wishes to provide crisp refreshment for the hotter days of the year, and it certainly does!"
""
"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some peppery and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with floral and citrus flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smells are fairly faint in my opinion."
"O: light refreshing brew for a hot day, flavors are approachable"
"An easy drinking beer, though with some subtle complexities if one takes the time to appreciate them."
"T- Sweet breadiness, but not overly so. This is an easy drinking beer. It's good, but not great. I feel like New Belgium should keep this one out. This was apart of the revival series. It taste similar to Fat Tire, if you takeout the caramel notes, and sweeter notes that Fat Tire has."

"Poured a cloudy, yet transparent amber, with a half finger white head. Pretty nice looking, standard, but not horrible. Scents of slight tropical fruit, some sweet malt, and very slight citrus and pine. Okay, nothing offensive, but very light. Flavor is light, with hints of floral hops predominating, with a bit of wheat cracker, slight citrus peel, and that earthy, dirty New Belgium yeast. It's a very light flavor to be sure, but it's not bad. Good for a light session beer like this. Mouthfeel is light bodied with fairly high carbonation. Again, a light, sessionable sort of mouthfeel. Overall it's decent enough, nothing I'd seek out, but good enough to drink on a hot summer day."

"KInda' boring really."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of floral hops, pine, slight earthy malt, sweet malt, and a hint of sugar. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, floral hops, lemon, and a hint of pepper. Overall, decent appearance, the aroma and body are highlighted by the lemon/pepper notes, and the blend is good."
""
"Pours a pale yellow with a fizzy head. Nose is sweet, lemon and grassy, citrus hops mixed in with some cereal malts. Taste starts off with citrus zestiness, which moves on to a cereal malt flavor. A lemony, grassy hop flavor finishes off the palate. Mouth is creamy and smooth. Overall, this is a refreshing summer beer, just as it is supposed to be."

"Clear gold in color. Forms a moderate fluffy white head, but it doesn't bother sticking around for too long as it reduces to a thick, patchy surface coating. Aroma is light, but pleasant. Biscuity malt, some grassiness and a pronounced floral quality. Taste is - unique, and not in a good way. Strong, overpowering floral taste, like camomile or something gives this beer a string perfumed quality. Almost unbearable. Some citrus zest. Lower pale malts. Light body. Minimal bitterness. Appropriate carbonation. I was surprised to see this listed as a Belgian pale as it really doesn't resemble one in the least. In all fairness, the bottle doesnt claim this is a Belgian pale. Never the less, this is a barely drinkable beer."

"Overall, a solid and session-worthy, but ultimately forgettable beer."

"O: Great summer session beer. Too light for my usual taste though. It reminded of a light beer in some ways, but enhanced to try to give it some depth. Not bad all in all, but this would leave me wanting more if I just had one of these."
"Taste packs alot of maltiness for such a light brew and the hops are adequate, especially on the bittering side. Yeast is still lacking for a Belgian PA, but there might be a light apple-nut contribution here. Mouthfeel is expectedly light, being a session ale and all. Not bad, it was nice to have this again - it must be at least 5 or 6 years since this was last around...but it doesnt taste as rich and yeasty as I remember."

"Tastes lightly bitter with a hint of hop bitterness with the volume turned down low. A touch of biscuit malt rounds this out, with an uninteresting finish. While this may make a nice summer beer it doesn’t do the trick for this session."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is basically just water. Nothing special here. Maybe this is a recipe that should have stayed hidden."
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure I agree with classifying Loft as a Belgian Pale Ale because I didn't get any spice notes in the palate. A more fitting style might be Session Pale Ale. It's light, moderately hoppy, and refreshing. Would I drink it again? Sure."
""
"O-Nothing bad as far as flavor goes, but just bland boring nothingness."

"Surprised at how much this beer grew on me. It’s simple on the outside, but improves as it goes down."

"Poured a golden yellow with just a hint of amber. Solid two fingers of white head. Okay retention and lots of lacing. Aroma has fruit, lemongrass, and vanilla. A light tasting beer that is crisp and mildly fruity. Light hops. Has a very creamy mouthfeel. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying a few more to see if it grows on me. Definitely one to drink on a hot day."

"A light, grassy and lemon beer for hot weather. Nothing spectacular, price point a little high for the lack of ingredients or process though. Would prefer something with a little more substance, regardless of the weather."
"This is a special brew meant to provide a light drinking experience basically. It delivers what it promises and gives an easy drinking, lighter brew - though it has to be one of, if not THE, lightest Belgian Pale Ales around. I was surprised at how light it really was and how it did kind of ""lift"" my palate up. Even though I tend to go for heavier stuff, I have to say that I still like this one because of it's even style, even though it is lighter."
"Light Orange. Clean, balanced but subtle aroma. The aroma is very spicy, hoppy and fruity. The flavor delivers a very nice citrus and fruit taste from the hops. The added lime leaves add a touch of lime flavor. A nice American wheat ale with a broad range of flavors but this doesnt seem to be in the Belgian mold to me."
"Nice summer beer, thicker than water with taste."
"Opinion: Well, this is a pretty tasty beer. It has some pretty good flavor, but it is obvious that this wasn't meant to knock you down. It would probably go pretty well with a cold basket of fruit on a hot summer day. I would rather use a Barley Wine for this purpose, so I probably won't be drinking this all too often...OK, I was just kidding about the Barley Wine, but it is still one I probably won't drink too often."
"Notes: A very good beer to be drinking over the summer or as a session beer. A very drinkable beer, but a little too bland for my taste."
"Not NB's best by a long shot, but not their worst. Give it a try."
"This should be an excellent hot weather thirst quencher - but good anytime. Very drinkable."
"This is a very subtle beer and very well balanced considering how delicate it is. Very drinkable and refreshing, and it would make an excellent summer beer. Very nice."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" eggshell head above the golden brew. Head lasts well, with delicate, prevalent lacing. Aroma is pale malt with citrus. Taste resembles the nose, light pale malt sweetness with a lemony twinge to it. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with good drinkability. Nice crossover and/or summertime brew. Not all brews need to make you sit and think about flavors nuances for hours, some are just for drinking, esp at 4%abv."
"Nice golden to amber color, thin one finger head does not last or lace particularly well. Very thin pour is unimpressive but not a clue to the beer as a whole, which is good. The smell is very herbal and organic some fruity undertones and hops ring through. The taste is very pleasent smooth, with a hint of fruit and some hop character in the finish, a bit over carbonated. The mouthfeel is unimpressive and watery...much like the pour. I like this beer as a drinkable one because I can give it to a fan of Boulevard or BMC and they might drink it and like it. This is a good beer and very drinkable in quantity and quality. Will buy again for stocking in the fridge for all occasions."
"Sweet caramel malt and a crisp grassy/citrus hops were very enjoyable, though a bit average. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style, though this made it quite drinkable."
"Loft pours a crisp golden with a two finger white head that is thin, but does stick aroun for quite some time. Aroma is yeasty to say the least, but the yeast has some pleasant peppery/grassy notes that balance the slight hints of caramelish malt. The taste is a little too thin for me. Sweet malt slides right over the tongue leading to a grassy middle before being punctuated by a sharp hop bite that is without a lot of character. Mouthfeel is too thin for my taste as well. Usually I'm a fan of New Belgium's brews, but this one just doesn't do it for me. Bring on the Frambozen!"
"I've enjoyed other beers by NBB, but this is not a beer I'll be having for a while...may need to try at a later date"
"Might not be world class but I like it nice enjoyable pale here. Thanks go to Dertbert for this sample."
" ok so it's not a bad beer just really, really bland. the taste is a light sweet malt. if someone handed me this on a hot day i wouldn't say no. i'm just amazed by the complete lack of substance to this beer. come on new beligum ditch this dud."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with nice carbonation. However, this brew just really doesn't do anything for me. Much too non-descript. I don't think I'll be seeking it out again. Thanks to mentor for the sample!"
"I have mixed feelings about New Belgum in general but am definatly not impressed by Loft. I was poured a pint by an excelant beer-barman but the Loft did not produce an adequate head. Its nose is very faint and slightly sour. The body is light, almost watery. Sweet grain flavor with strawberry notes. On the up side, its rather easy to drink, but thats mostly because there is not too much to it."
"Pours a nice golden yellow orange. Very nice color. Head is very small and disappears quickly. The smell is excellent. Even though it is quite faint, I can smell the fruit. Kind of an orangey, lemony smell. It's great compared to Fat Tire's smell. I absolutely love the taste. Tastes kind of lemony at the first wave, and then turns nice and malty at the finish. The aftertaste is quite interesting because it leaves a taste like fresh, buttery corn-on-the-cob in the back of the mouth. the hops are quite light, and not overpowering at all. This, in turn, makes it very, very drinkable. It goes down very smoothly. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys beer."
"Drinkability: Light, refreshing beer, with low alcohol content makes this one a dangerously quaffable summer beer. I would not hesitate to have another. Worth trying, at least once."
"A pleasing light orange in color, 1/8th of an inch white ring; fair lacing. Biscuits and underlying malts with hints of lemon peel and grass on the nose. Up top, very rich, zesty and creamy; has a sweet-sour feel to it. Medium burnt toast like flavorings coupled with some grain and wheat. Has qualities like its Fat-Tire brother, a decent and refreshing offering."
"Loft is a good summer session beer. At 4 or 4.2%, these go down pretty easy after mowing the lawn on a 95 degree North Carolina day. Not a whole lot going on with the beer, but solid, and does what it's meant to do."
"Nice golden color, White head. There was about a 1/4 inch head immediately after pouring, and this was gone within a minute leaving slight white lacing around the edges with virtually no head in the middle. I was surprised by the amount of carbonation, as the quick dying head led me to believe this may be a bit on the flat side (not the case). Not sure how to describe the taste here, but I'll give it a shot. First off, it's fairly mild, a bit fruity (hint of fig?) and very light tasting, with some fine carbonation. Slightly hoppy, with some Grassy over-tones (not that i go around eating grass, but that's the impression i got nonetheless). Also there is a bit of a ""sour"" aftertaste. Really it's just kind of a ""blah"" beer for me, It's easlily drinkable, but just not enjoyable. I was hoping to like this one more, but so far ""New Belgium"" has failed to impress me."
"Great ""gateway"" beer for getting people off swill. Otherwise, don't bother. Nice kite on the bottle."
"bright and clear orange, smells scrumptious. smoky malt and hops, peachy fruit and something bitter and nutty. raisin? all the size of a belgian with no muscle. taste is very mild, malty with a fire roasted chestnut note. like an amber ale in its simplicity. very dainty hop addition lends a smooth crisp finish. also notable in the finish is a spritzy spiciness. unique. extremely flavorful for 4%. an interesting effort from NB. a little messy though in its attempt to quietly meld these flavors.. suffers a bit as jumbled."
"I think I actually prefer this from the bottle. There's no pretense that way. Something to swig from while the Mariners lose. Otherwise, ther ain't much point to this. This isn't horrible, but it isn't worth shelling out craft beer money for when you can buy a perfectly adequate macro that won't be far below this."
"Quite light with a wheat bite around a dry, saltless biscuit around raw almonds. A touch of lemon balm. There's little spice aside from some wheat husks. This is a pretty airy beer with nothing to scare the fat tire drinker."
"Pours a beautifully brilliantly clear golden-copper color and is topped by a frothy pale tan head. The aroma is bready, and a bit yeast (surprising considering there is no residual yeast left in this beer), with notes of lime and a hint of woodiness. The beer is fairly dry, and certainly spritzy as it first hits my tongue. The carbonation adds quite a bit of zesty, spritzy character to this light brew. There is some nice herbal spiciness here as well as a bit of dry lemon-like acidity and zest, especially in the finish. This is a nice, light refreshing brew which is good to sip on a hot summer day. There is a hint of malty sweetness here that accentuates the Kaffir lime leaf and adds a bit more to the citrusy zing, though the citrus is somewhat subtle, at least compared to the Stone 04 I had recently."
"I was recently at a restaurant in Cripple Creek Colorado, and they had Loft in bottles. For lack of anything better, I made the mistake of ordering one. The appearance was a light amber, with a white head and minimal lacing. Aroma was faintly floral with a portent of coming cloves. Malt was conspicuous for its absence, and a sour, lemony flavor dominated. Carbonation was light, mouthfeel was dry but lacking in yeast. A disappointing offering from New Belgium."
"This beer is crisp and clean and you definitely feel the carbonation in your mouth. A straw flavor with a light finish. Very straightforward and refreshing. Very unpretentious and a good summer beer."
"Of the three lighter beers from New Belgium this is my favourite due to the fullness of body, nice finish, candy sugar nose and plain old drinkability. The Belgian part is subdued with a more conservative flavour profile taking over. It almost tastes like Okanagan Pale ale at times. I intend in getting more of this while it is available as it is a great summer seasonal."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a grainy pale malt scent. It's sweet smelling with some musty notes. The taste is good also. It has a pale and wheat malt flavor that goes down easy and refreshes. It's a bit grainy with a nice malty feel. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine seasonal brew and at only 115 calories, it's good for you."
"overall: not recommended, prefer 1554 & fat tire by nb brewing to loft, not worth the $6 sale price i paid for this six pack"
"Highly drinkable and refreshing and with its low ABV of 4.2% it could turn into a 100 degree summer session beer. It is low on calories too...but who cares!!!"
"This beer pours a light golden yellow. The head is white with a slight yellow tint to it. It looks fluffy. It fades slowly leaving thick laces. It smells very cirtusy. The aroma of hops is quite present. It smells just a little like Fat Tire. Ever so slightly biscuty. It tastes fruity. There is a strong orange flavor present. It tastes cirtusy. The hops flavor is strong, but not over aggressive. Can a flavor be strong, and mild and the same time? It tastes slightly spicy. Just a slight hint of cloves. This beer is carboneted just a little too much I think, but not enough to detract from the taste, just a little too carbonated for me. It is very smooth. Definately a good beer for a hot summer day. While the flavor is a little lacking, it is still quite decent. This beer would make a great session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the mild taste is very non aggressive. This is a great beer to drink all summer long. Definately worth a try."
"Drinkability is quite high. Even though it seems a bit disappointing, I will probably buy some of this next time I'm back in Omaha and looking for a sessionable brew, but probably not before I've tried some other breweries I can't get here in Iowa City."
"a real contender in the ""Champagne of Beers"" category!"
"This is a beer to drink on a hot day. It doesn't make it bad, it just isn't the most flavorful of beers out there."
"Nice copper color, some malt aroma, small phenol level present, a slight citric nose also present, not much fruitiness to it, slight spice character, hardly noticeable, maltiness never really jumps out at you but it is distinguishable to the palate, moderate body, smooth medium carbonation, a drinkable beer for the season, some spice to accent spicy food, nice."
"Bottle. Not much flavours to speak of. Really not hoppy or malty, the flavour dissapears really quickly. I really can't pick any flavours that stand out, and the palate is so soft that its almost non-existent. My first in a line of many dissapointments with this brewer."
"Bright and light in the mouth. Steadily carbonation. This begs for warm temperatures, and days when beer can be consumed outside again."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but pretty plain. Not bad, but nothing to write home about."
"12oz. bottle: Mine poured a golden color without too much head to it. It was fairly clear. The aroma is that pretty familiar commercial lager beer smell. Im kind of suprised, since this is supposed to be a Belgian Ale (?). Nothing else really there, except maybe a hint of floral notes. Slight wheat taste, with some sourness in the aftertaste. Nothing bad about it, but nothing to make you want to have another, either."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, especially with the low abv. the only thing that would stop me from drinking several would be my desire to switch to something a bit more aggressive."
"12 ounce bottle labeled Best By 28 Dec 04. Pours clear golden/orange, with light frothy head that dissipates fairly quickly, but did leave some lacing. Nice nose- subtle, not overwhelming or imposing - malts and fruit. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, clean finish. Taste is pleasant, with some malt sweetness and ?apple taste, and light hop finish. Drinks easily. I'll look for this one next summer when it's released again."
"Drinkability- This is a very refreshing beer. Wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is. I like it and could easily drink many of these. They go down without any problems."
"An excellent summer brew."
"Notes: This is a strange brew! Too dry, too dry, too dry! I like the brewery, but this is their worst beer."
"Out of all of the New Belgium beers, this is perhaps my favorite (though I haven't tasted La Folie yet; I also have a lot of fondness for their Single, not brewed this year [2004]). I have a particular fondness for low-gravity beers one can drink all night long and not feel the effects too much, and this fits that bill well. It really fits the Belgian model of brewing well: unique and interesting ingredients brewed in a firmly traditional style; innovative, but innovation in pursuit of flavor and not for its own sake."
"Edit, I'm docking it to 3.0 as it really isnt that tasty. Still refreshing but still..."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Not too shabby for Mid-October but it would probably be better when it isn't about 45* outside."
"Rotation: retired"
"The beer's body is also light. Overall this is an above-average beer."
"The taste has only a trace of that plastic I came to loathe, mostly what is here is a perfectly tender pale ale. Lots of toasty hop character to go around and insanely drinkable. I could wolf down a pizza and sixer of this without batting an eye."
"All in all, a nice beer. This is an excellent summertime beer for quaffing with friends or while sitting out on the back porch listening to th baseball game on the radio. The light body and texture reminded me of some of the Mexican beers that I've had, but without the corn adjunct sweetness. I'd grab this one again."
"This is as light as a non-light beer can get, and yet I don't mind it at all. It is a nice break after a deluge of thick, cloying stouts and porters, the last summer gasp before we settle into the darker half of the year. Not bad."
"Taste is grassy with a dry hoppiness. Lightly fruity and bitter. Airy wheat malt and a bit grainy. Did I mention dry? Well the mouth is dry too. And crisp. Lightly fizzy on the tongue. Pretty good and very drinkable. Surprisingly good and straight forward."
"Overall Impression: This one just doesnt do it for me. The flavor just seems harsh and unpleasant. My least enjoyed New Belgium so far."
"Loft doesn't quite take flight as befits a beer with a soaring kite on its label, but it has no trouble staying airborne and was a welcome and uplifting addition to my day. Thanks to marc77 for the bottle."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light tangerine color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty, with some sweet fruity esters, and just a touch of spice. Not really too strong of a smell though. The taste is also very malty, a touch of residual sweetness, and a bready yeast character. Slightly spicy finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light and watery. The drinkability is good though. A decent brew."
"Thanks to BDiddy for the bottle!"
"Dark yellow color, moderate head. Sticky lace. Smell is light lemon and new belgium's trademark buscuit maltiness. Taste is yeasty, malty, and very light and smooth. Excellent hot-day beer, too expensive to be considered ""lawnmower"" beer, however,"
"Overall - I think this does very well as a beer to relax with on a hot summer day, and one of the few my girlfriend actually likes. Would buy it again if I was ever out West for awhile."
"I should note that when I was tasting this beer we were tasting many other beers before it that were quite disappointing. The lack of good beer before this may have set this up to be better than it truly is."
"The hops are crisp, but the taste of apples predominates. The beer even looks like apple juice.It's a straightfoward beer--unremarkable, but unobjectionable. As I drank more, the taste became more and more sour. The fruit taste became more dominate as I approach the bottom of the glass. On the last sip, I cringed a little at the sweetness."
"Loft pours a respectable dark golden orange color. Head is moderate and leaves nice lacing. Smell is lightly hoppy with some light sweetness. Sip starts with mild hoppiness and ends with a notable floral taste. Taste is fairly balanced, but lacks any commanding flavor. I was hoping for a more complex beer. Not a bad beer, and easily drinkable, but lacks a strong enough flavor to be really good."
"Average across the board. Pours a golden yellow with hints of reddish orange light. Lacing is minimal, leaves light residue. The smell is of grain and more grain. Earthy bread tones are also noted, slight malt and citrus aroma but not much. The tase is like a light grape nut cereal with semi caramel malts, hints of lemon zest as well, light and dull, drinkable if nothing else available."
"Not a bad beer from Ft.Collins but not the first I'd grab from New Belgium."
"Appearance was golden orange in color. Poured a nice head that left a sticky lacing down the side. Smell was of floral hops and a hint of bread. Taste was curious, a bit fruity with a dry hopped finish. Mouthfeel was rather light but a bit of an interesting play on the tongue. Overall drinkability is not bad as it is worth a try. I would not turn down one if offered but I would not go out of my way to purchase this again."
"The smell is very floral with some hop spice and some malt and caramel hints blended in. The taste starts out hoppy and kinda dies into a slightly dry and sour taste in the finish. There wasnt much mouthfeel other than some fizz from the carbonation. Not a very asserative beer."
"Pours with a white, two-fingered pillowy head, fades soon and leaves a good lace. Medium carbonation. Clear golden amber color. Nose is hoppy, starts and finishes hoppy, the lime leaf is not noticeable; hopheads line up for this one. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Finish isn't terribly long. But it's a refreshing beer. Almost light enough to qualify for lawnmower status."
"I'll be as generous as I can here, but this beer is enormously disappointing, especially given the build-up on the packaging. I understand that a summer brew should be ""light"" and ""refreshing," but this is ridiculous--it's barely beer. Buy a pint of selzer, squeeze in two limes, and add a splash of IPA: you'll get the same flavor for a tenth the price."
"Many, many thanks to nvsblman for the great brew."
"This ale poured a clear, golden-amber color with creamy, white foam that persisted. There was a good, steady carbonation. The smell was lightly fruity hops with some wheat malt and citrus. The taste was malty with a hoppy finish and with a strong lime citrus flavor throughout. Nicely tangy. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth and crisp with medium body and moderate carbonation. There was a lime citrusy aftertaste that lingered pleasantly. This was a nice, light, and refreshing ale, and it really grew on me. If you like lime, try this beer."
"Pours a pretty coppery-orange with a big frothy hat of white foam that stays put and deposits thick rings of lace on the glass. Copious carbonation mesmerizes as it floats upward. The smell is dominated by a broad, bready sweetness and punctuated by a nice grassy, slightly citric hoppiness and a nice little metallic nose at the finish. Good malts out of the gate and a building bitterness that backs off for a tangy and refreshing finish. Mouthfeel is thin but I must consider the time of year and the temperature outside, (good summer brew). Drinkability is fine...seems to be a good beach beer."
"The smell is full and good, exhibiting light fruit and alcoholic characteristics. The taste is similarly sharp and nice, although a bit too light. It feels a bit sharp in the mouth but remains easy to drink."
"Overall, this was a very pleasing and refreshing beer. Definitely the best ""lighter"" beer I've had...a great summer drink!"
"This is an unusual beer that doesn't follow any strict stylistic guidelines. One could call it a hoppy, light Fat Tire without being too far off the mark. Fat Tire is a non-traditional American amber ale (with Belgian elements) and Loft is a non-traditional American pale ale (with similar Belgian elements, although the hops seem distinctly American). To complicate matters, New Belgium suggests you drink this at a briskly cold 38 degrees, even chillier than lagers are supposed to be served. I'd say don't drink it quite that cold, but this isn't a cellar temp ale either. A smooth, innocuous malt quality provides just the barest trace of backbone for the sparkling, piney hops. The yeast seems to play a large part here, by unifying the brew and providing slight metallic and buttery elements. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, clean, and perhaps the high point. Hops twinkle and glisten on the tongue. Finish is crisp and refreshing. A warm-weather, low-alcohol session beer, good for drinking large amounts of, and for serving straight out of the cooler - although it tastes better poured into a glass than in the bottle. Judging by the review scores here, it's not as good as it used to be."
"This is a very drinkable beer without being a pushover in terms of flavor or complexity."
"Overall it isn't a bad beer, it just doesn't do much for me."
"Pours a clear, slightly orange amber color with a small white head. Smell is a hint of sweet malt with a floral/piney hop aroma, not too strong. Taste starts with a bit of sweet malt and wheat, but the focal point is the nice blending of citrus tones and a piney hop flavor. NB's web site claims a mixture of Liberty and Sterling hops and spiced with kaffir lime leaf. Very little bitterness. Clean, crisp finish. Medium body. Good drinkability. An interesting brew that I'd definitely buy again."
"I tried this out of curiousity, the local liquor store owner had been singing it's praises every time I went in. I have to agree that this is a great offering, and I am glad I took the plunge. It pours an interesting orange/copper color, and leaves a nice (albeit small) head with a little bit of fine lacing. Smell is very fruity, almost an orange scent, with some florals too--nice. The taste is similar to most pale ales, with a bitter/coppery first bite which leads to a smooth finish. I pounded 3 of these fairly quickly, so I have to give it credit for drinkability. A solid beer all around."
"But this isn't a Belgian pale ale! Whatever it is, it's refreshing, and -- well! -- lofty!"
"Comments - Not one of my favorites from New Belgium but one that is worth a taste when it is offered. Just look for the big red kite on the label."
"Bottle was marked best before August, 2003. This is the beer with the red kite hovering aloft in the wind on the label. I had this at the brewery and I remember enjoying it then. Poured out a slightly cloudy golden orange color and was topped with a thin a sticky white head. Semi sweet fruitiness in the aroma. Taste gives a pleasant sourness. The body is light and this golden brew downs the hatch easy enough. The taste is similar to other golden ales I gave tried, with nothing really standing out. Decent and drinkable."
"Light orange color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and floral. A lighter bodied ""Belgian"" ale. Malts are fruity. Hops are spicy. Light and refreshing. There is a lot of stuff going on here, and I find myself having real trouble describing just what. Its dry hopped and very crisp. The low alcohol doesn't seem to affect the flavors. Interesting beer.. Will need to re-taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is fruity and a touch biter"
"Clear, gold in color, with almost no head at all. A light, citric hop bouquet sits atop a mild, caramel malt, with just a hint of diacetyl character. Flavor starts light, with caramel, almost biscuity, malt flavors. Toward mid-palate a lemony flavor starts developing, building towards a very sharp finish punctuated by herbal, citric, and piney hops. Refreshing in character, and drinkable enough, though far from my favorite offering from this brewery."
"A medium mouthfeel, quite nice. Goes down smooth. Good beer."
"Overall Impression: A great limited release, something to look forward to as much as Alaskan Summer ale. Label says it ""delivers an uplifting zest"". I agree with that!"
"Pours a crystal yellow, with a medium-sized cumulus cloud head. Smell is hops. Taste hints at some barley and wheat malts, but quickly gives way to tangy, almost sour hops with strong notes of grapefruit in an acidic, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is surprisingly big. Very refreshing and drinkable. I need to get some porch swing now..."
"What can I say but WOW!! This was the only beer I didn't have at the brewery and I think this is the only time I have ever given a 5 in a category. This ale pours a beautiful golden color with slight head that has some staying power. The aroma is very refreshingly fragrant of pale hops. The taste is just pure bliss. I am definitely a huge fan of New Belgium brews and have had trouble picking my favorite from 1554, Fat Tire, and Sunshine but this one takes the cake. You immeadiately taste the bitterness but it is not too much, just enough, once you swallow the bitterness remains for a moment and then the malts kick in. At first you can taste how rich they are and then the wheat flavor jumps in. On top of all that it is very easy to drink. I will hunt this beer down and make sure everyone I know has the chance to taste it."
"The smell suggests of hops, but as if they're maybe not the freshest. The taste is crisp from the hops, though not overtly hoppy. The clean malt body makes for a nice beer for spring and summer. Good with meals as well."
"I was at the Flying Saucer with 10 or 15 of my closest friends. I was the first to have a Loft. It poured a real clear yellow with a nice head. The aroma was of a sour hops. I thought there was something wrong with the beer. I passed it around and NO ONE at the table liked it smell. The taste was of citrus and left a bitter taste in my mouth long after the liquid was gone. The mouthfeel was unimpressive except for the citrus. I found this a beer that I would drink again as long as I did not have to go out of my way."
"This is a good beer for a hot day. It's definitely a session beer."
"This has a light copper color to it with a medium head that seems to last through the tasting. The sweet flavorand crisp aroma prepare you for what is to come as you sample the beer. The flavor is sweet and lightly malted with a bitterness the accompanies the light crisp fruitiness of this beer."
"We've just started to receive ""New Belgium"" beer in my area and I have fallen in love with three of their beer. ""Loft"" would be number two of the three. When poured, it was golden yellow with loads of foam. The smell of hop's and citrus was just outstanding. The taste was a well balance of hop's and citrus with a hint of malt's. This brew had a sweet/bitter finish that was very pleasant. So, with the taste of hop's, citrus, malt's and just a hint of wheat, this is just outstanding. The three best of is ""Trippel, Loft and 1554""."
"Anyway its odd but drinkable in hot weather..recommends it be served at 3 degrees C on the label"
"I still love you, New Belgium, but this one isn't among your best!"
"Overall, the beer is slight and subtle, but theres a lot going on underneath the crisp, refreshing cover."
"A clear, deep-golden body reveals dozens of steadily rising bubbles beneath a creamy white head. The retention is limited, however, and it drops shortly to just a creamy collar and whispy surface foam. Sheets of tiny spotted lace remain, however. It's actually quite attractive. The nose clearly displays wheat; and along with it an unusual note that's herbal, floral and even a touch grassy, as well as lightly citrusy. Interesting! It's smooth and gently crisp in the mouth - light bodied and refreshing. Some bitterness and citrusy/gently piney hops appear in an otherwise thin and generic, partially wheat-based malt. It finishes dry and refreshing with a touch of citrus and a soft, lingering bitterness. A decent summer brew that's better suited to a sunny day of boating than relaxing in the harbor at sunset."
"This was an odd little beer that I enjoyed. I liked it because it is different that your typical light beer."
"A clumpy, white, dense head leaves full, sticky, thick lacing. The beer is clear amber. I get hops in the fairly faint nose. Also some darkness and a little ink. There's a nice caramel maltiness in the front, but a slightly strange tangy middle. It's just a touch sour. The finish is just as dry as a really dry thing. Wheaty. Nice fresh aftertaste. This is a good, pleasant, fresh beer. A nice, light, summer amber."
"Pours a slightly reddish amber color with a creamy white head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is sweet buttery toffee, floral hops, and a bit of fresh grass. Moderate in body and quite smooth. Taste is sweet caramel followed by some biscuity notes and piney hops all the while in the presence of a strong malt backbone. A touch of acidic citrus is present in the finish. A fine brew and another winner from New Belgium Brewing."
"Im a big fan of New Belgium and its fine line of beers, and looked forward to this beers debut. The beer pours a limpid amber to almost copper color, the head impressive in size and frothy in it texture, with fine sheets of lace to cover the glass. The aroma of buttered popcorn, malt, lightly floral and quite pleasant to the nose. Begins a bit sweet with tons of malt, the top middling in its feel. Masterfully hopped, stinging in its acidic bite, dry as a bone malt aftertaste that lingers on. A good drinking beer, but I was expecting something more? What, Im not sure maybe another Saison, quite quaffable nonetheless."
"Acquired via trade. I couldn't help thinking of poor Charlie Brown when I saw the kite on the label. If only Charlie could kick back with a good brew after a loss to the kite-eating tree. He could enjoy the appealing orange color with a thin white head and decent lacing of a brew like this. He would enjoy the pleasant hops aroma. He would have surely been mildly surprised by the subdued hops flavor with a nice wheaty counterbalance. Ah Charlie Brown, forever doomed to lemonade."
"Re-reviewed: Unfortunately my last bottle. Less bitterness present. A bit of wheat taste. This beer was good enough for me to miss it after not having it for a month or so. I increased the drinkability rating. My rating of this beer increased as I drank more. Not just a high rating because it is exotic in my region."
"2002 release. Golden, but not as pale as you'd expect from this color. Not much of a head, but it leaves some lace. Great aroma of pine and citrus-like hops tells you that this will be a great refresher. Taste is similar to a lighter American-style pale ale. Very flavorful yet refreshing, this is most likely meant to be a summer brew. Light to medium body. Subtle pine-like hops and bready malt are the main flavors present here. A unique spicy hop finish awaits you after that. Of course, this one is extremely drinkable. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, my favorite summer brew so far this year!"
"wow, new belgium has done it again with this beer. i have yet to be disappointed by anything from this company. this beer is very different than their other styles, its quite complex and doesnt really fit into any one catagory. the brew pours a golden amber color, with a short lived white head.  the most notable smell to this beer is hops, this is one hoppy beer. the fist sip confirms this, definate hop flavors with a slight malty sweetness, and a nice spicey kick at the end. the beer is slightly dry tasting, but very good, almost reminds me of a pale ale. i just hope i can find another 6pack of this before it goes away."
"Gotta thank marc77 again for these New Belgium brews. They are rock solid."
"Lovely golden-orange in color with a moderate snow-white color, moderate lace, slight carbonation.  Spicy, hoppy aroma, with fresh bread notes.  Tasting this beer is a curious experience, the taste is quite hard to characterize, it begins with caramel and toasted malt flavors which drift into strong hops, then giving way to sweet orange flavors, and a crisp, clean finish.  In describing those flavors, it is difficult to determine where one ends and the next begins, so gracefully do they flow into each other.  This is the kind of beer that distinguishes New Belgium among micro brewers.  A superb and enigmatic brew."
"This is definitely a beer in its own category.  Beautiful orange-brown color with a light lace, the aroma really raises the eyebrows.  I was led to think, ""so what's the big deal? its just another well-hopped ale.""  Boy was I wrong.  The complex flavor of this brew is completely on another level than the aroma would suggest.  A lighter wheat-style ale body supports flavors of sweet malt flushed in orange juice and then dusted with spicy, but not really bitter hops.  This is one of the best brews I have tried this year if not ever.  Awesome"
"Clear dark golden / light amber hue, topped by a large bubbled head that quickly settles into a thin layer. Intricate lace is unexpectedly left.  The malt aroma is bready and a touch grainy, while the assertive hop nose seems to be a combination of Cascade and a lightly herbal and noble (perhaps Spalt) hop nose.  Light caramel emerges as the beer warms.  Light caramel sweetness that mirrors the aroma is perceptible initially in flavor, then is followed by subtle wheat tartness and husky, but not astringent grain notes.  Hop bitterness is mild and belies the strong hop nose, but since overall malt sweetness is low, this brew exhibits an overall balance.  Lightly bodied, but dextrinous enough to lend a somewhat slick mouthfeel.  Finishes with a strong cracker - like note especially noticeable with an exhale, but is otherwise dry and clean.  Loft is yet another unique New Belgium creation.  Although somewhat confusing to the palate, the drinkability is good.  Hmm... A jack of all trades... (but a master of none?!)"
