4.4,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall: (4.25) A Belgian IPA, done the Vinnie Cilurzo way. Vinnie seems to have taken the Belgian IPA style and put his own twist on it. He has done away with the super citrus-y, piney and tropical American hops in conjunction with Belgian yeast. Which to me, is a really good call because when the high alpha American hops are used in tandem with the naturally very fruity, estery Belgian yeast, is an absolute train wreck in flavor; The yeast and hops just fight each other too much and the beer tends to get this weird peanut butter flavor as the hops start to oxidize. Defenestration does not suffer from these qualms at all; the yeast esters and floral hops really marry well together and they coalesce beautifully in the incredibly dry finish. Russian River does an incredible job as usual with this beer!","flayedandskinned","May 08, 2013"

4.15,7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O: A nice Belgian offering from RR. Quite balanced as the hops are really held in check by the creamy malt undertones. Would certainly drink this again.","IronCitySteve","Oct 10, 2011"
4.03,3.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Clean flavor, lightly fruity pear esters, mild malt backbone, lingering hop bitterness that's also a bit mild. A clean an crisp Belgian Pale, easy to session. Hoppy doesn't always equal IPA, in this case the beer seems to be mislabeled here as a Belgian IPA.","emerge077","Oct 09, 2011"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A decent enough beer, but not exactly a huge success for a brewery like RR.","John_M","Sep 23, 2011"
3.7,-4.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Light bodied with a lively carbonation that didn't attack your tongue, nice and refreshing for a warm sunny day outside the brew pub today. Would have liked fresher tasting hops on the beer though.","nataku00","Sep 12, 2011"
4.03,3.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A decent version of a Belgian IPA, although it tastes to me a bit too vegetal.","Beerenauslese","Aug 28, 2011"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"A nice Belgian Pale Ale with some extra hops thrown in. They seem to be noble hops as opposed to American. It's not especially over the top from a hops perspective. The hops add another component to the beer but it still maintains its Belgian characteristics. It's interesting but very drinkable. I enjoyed it quite a bit.","GJ40","Aug 17, 2011"
3.8,-2.1,4,4,4,3,3.5,"A decent beer with a nice aroma with the mouthfeel lets it down.","dgilks","Aug 13, 2011"
3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Really wasn't my thing, even if I can tell it is still very well made.","Beerandraiderfan","Aug 12, 2011"
3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is the problem. A "Belgian IPA" can be one of two things, one being far superior IMO, it can either be a hopped up Belgian ale style (in this case I'd consider this beer a hopped up tripel of sorts) or it can be an American IPA wort fermented with a Belgian yeast strain. The second I find more appealing and "better" than the first, easily. This beer should have been Blind Pig with the Damnation yeast. Oh well, onward and upward. They all can't be winners, not even from Russian River.","drabmuh","Aug 12, 2011"
3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear golden-yellow color with a two-finger white head and some spotty lacing on the way down, along with a thin collar throughout. The nose carries a bit of Belgian yeast and hops. Contrary to many Belgian IPAs, it seems more like this has Belgian hops in it. Based on my limited experience, it seems close to Styrian Goldings, though I could be way off. Hops don't quite complement the yeast as much as I'd like. Medium body with good carbonation. Decent, but not Russian River caliber.","Thorpe429","Aug 02, 2011"
3.95,1.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer is golden hued and mostly clear, with only a slight haze. The white head displays lasting retention and leaves some decent lacing in its wake. The aroma brings yeast, malt, hops, spice. Decent flavor, with everything in the aroma balanced equitably. The beer is slightly sweet, and could stand more hop flavor and bitterness. Coriander comes through quite a bit. Not as dry as I would like. Overall, a decent brew, but not the customary excellence one comes to expect from Russian River.","Huhzubendah","Jul 27, 2011"

4.38,12.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It is a fact that Vinni Cilurzo is among the best brewers when it comes to both Belgian-inspired and hopped-up American beers. (Argue with me on that and you're arguing against many thousands of others too.) He's one of the few American brewers who could go to Belgium and explain to the islanders how to cast their nets and he's also responsible for the highest rated hop bombs. Is it any surprise that a combination of the two would be among the best?","biegaman","Jul 08, 2011"
4.3,10.8,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this was a nice brew. The spice character really took control in this one (like a nice authentic Belgian Pale Ale), and the hops were second in line, but still very noticeable. Well done.","treyrab","Beers"

3.58,-7.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Medium bodied with dry, earthy hops up front which are countered by pale malt, phenol alcohol and esters/yeast that give of hints of light fruit.  Earthy and slightly grassy followed by sweet light fruit notes and subtle spice.  Hints of apple and pale as well as some grapefruit and orange peel.  Well balanced but just a touch too much alcohol toward the dry finish.  ","corby112","Jun 10, 2011"
4.32,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D - Very drinkable. The balance of the Belgian and American elements here is really spot on a present a nice hybrid beer.","ngeunit1","Jun 08, 2011"
4.12,6.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: Possibly my favorite beer of the day, bitter and spicy. Quite good.","akorsak","Jun 08, 2011"
4.18,7.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"O- one of the better of the style and so fresh and so green that you can almost feel the hops in your mouth.","oglmcdgl","May 28, 2011"
3.8,-2.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O- Not what I was expecting, not that I did not enjoy this, it was different. A lighter Belgian IPA if you will almost like a bigger redemption.","BARFLYB","Apr 14, 2011"
3.56,-8.2,4,3,3.5,4,4,"O: 'Twould be easy to drink. A LOT. Very smooth, and quite tasty. I approve, but it isn't the best I've had of this style.","mjyoung","Apr 04, 2011"
4.03,3.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drink- A very nice beer, I was thankful for this growler share. Its not as hoppy as I expected and this worked in its favor.","FosterJM","Apr 03, 2011"
4.13,6.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"O: Not usually a big Belgian IPA fan, but this was much more IPA than it was Belgian. A great example of the style.","womencantsail","Mar 29, 2011"
3.54,-8.8,4,2.5,4,4,3.5,"O: Super easy to drink and well rounded. Not the greatest of the style but I would definitely have this again.","scottfrie","Dec 10, 2008"
4.3,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall- Defenestration was a really great beer, I liked it all the way through with little to no faults, if anything maybe a little bit more balance between yeasty doughy bread and hoppyness.","dookiepower","Dec 02, 2008"
3.75,-3.4,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"D: Surely worth a try. Went down easy and paired great with the super spicy sausage platter at Magnolia. Not a favorite but would have if it were distributed.","marcpal","Nov 28, 2008"
4.17,7.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I love this style and this is a fine example of it.","sloejams","Nov 08, 2008"
4.27,10.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Taste & mouthfeel: Big floral hop notes with a complex backbone of spice, banana and cracker. The malt foundation is simple and dry, light in body, crisp. Drying in the finish, bitter enough to be an American IPA. I'm generally not a fan of this style, but Vinnie shows his talent for hoppy beers once again here. The yeast provides plenty of interesting fruit and spice flavor without overwhelming the hops, while the bone-dry malt base allows the hops to shine through in all their complexity. Beautifully done and incredibly drinkable.","largadeer","Nov 05, 2008"
3.63,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Fine in terms of drinkability. Probably won't get it again, though, only because of the myriad of other great beers to get at RR.","lhaqq","Oct 20, 2008"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability- Glad I got to try this brew. Not my favorite per style, but it's quite good. Worth a try for sure.","GClarkage","Oct 19, 2008"
4.67,20.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Defenestration is an exceptional beer. It's an interesting and delicious shoehorning of RR's gigantic IPA style into a Belgian. I would love another glass of this beer because there was a lot going on that I didn't catch from my initial time with it. The beer pours a bright gold with a nice head. The smell was more of RR's west coast hoppiness than I was prepare for. It looks like a Belgian but smells strongly of pine, citrus and floral hops. The hops come through in the flavor as well but there are also some earthy notes and a complexity fruitiness that is difficult to describe. There was caramel and bread in the balancing malt. I really should have bought a growler of it. That big West coast hoppiness in a Belgian is a fine treat.","popery","Oct 19, 2008"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"My overall impression was that this beer is good, but nothing crazy delicious.","waltonc","Oct 12, 2008"
4.22,8.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Served from a growler from RRBC, appearance a cloudy, golden hue with nice lacing, smells like Pliny and tastes like it too, delicisous with nice citrus and pine notes with a smooth belgian yeasty finish. Amazing flavor and drinks like Pliny. Enjoy some if you can.","BevMoPatrick1","Oct 12, 2008"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"An interesting IPA with the floral-ness from the hops. Definitely not a pine oil hop-bomb, but the hops are definitely still there. Overall pretty tasty brew.","abfraser","Oct 07, 2008"
4.13,6.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"The taste, though, is quite good. It's nice and bready with hint of toasted cracker, grapes, hints of raisin and buttery caramel, a hint of herbs and pine, plus citrus, mostly lemon and grapefruit. It starts sweetish then gradually morphs to a slightly bitter, mostly citrusy, finish. It's quite nice and holds up well.","Offa","Oct 01, 2008"
4.15,7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Another recommended beer from a great brewery.","jwolfie70","Sep 24, 2008"
3.78,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Cool aroma, some citrus, slight hop, and a bright fresh light golden aroma. Very drinkable, some wheat flavor. No Alc noticable. Sampled from a growler brought to the 07 Speedway BA Release. Got to sample a couple times. Refreshing brew ment for a hot day. Very drinkable, thanks for the sample for the beer knowledgeable guy who brought this.","paytoplay","Beers"
4.23,9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I put this one up on Beer Advocate as a Belgian IPA because this is what they call it. I brought it home Saturday (the 19th) in a growler and only got around to drinking it over the last couple nights (with some help of course). The color was a rich gold with a moderate white head and sticky lacing. Nose is very yeasty with banana, grapefruit, and there are hints of spices in there as well. Mouthfeel is excellent as are many RR brews, with moderate carbonation. Flavor is slightly sweet and as befits something called an IPA there is quite a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Overall an interesting brew that was easy to drink, and I am glad I brought home a growler.","rkuhnel","0"
