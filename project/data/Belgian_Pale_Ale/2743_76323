4.02,5,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Belgian goblet. This beer is inspired by Orval and is indeed alive with funk, more so than its more esteemed Trappist progenitor. I have yet to encounter so much head on a beer ... The entire glass is filled with soft beige bubbles and subsequent pours are just as billowing as the first. The head does calm down if you wait a moment and like Orval is savagely bitter if you wish to taste it alone. Color is a honey orange-amber, rather cloudy. Smells compelling. I get ample Brettanomyces funk, bubble gum, orchard fruit, banana, mixed spices, dish soap, leather, and citrus rind ... Very astringent, spicy, sour, fruity, dry. The number of flavor elements I register is quite staggering, although this takes some mindfulness and a willingness to brave the tannic dry bitterness and funk that pervades the proceedings from start to finish. There's a sweet sugar cookie and sour gummy candy malt backbone buried underneath 1) pie cherries, peach, banana, grape, watermelon rind, and lemon-lime fruit notes, 2) nutmeg, allspice, cardamom, and ginseng spice flavors, 3) floral rosewater and lemongrass, and 4) bandage and horse blanket phenolic/funk elements. Medium bodied with aggressive yet not prickly carbonation ... Beneath the head the beer is actually quite creamy and smooth. Finish is bone dry and the whole thing makes you thirsty, truth be told. This dryness is a hallmark of an Orval-style Belgian pale though. This brew is a polarizer, with some considering it the second coming while others decry it as overrated and crude. The truth is somewhere in the middle, as is typically the case. Rayon Vert is a personal favorite of mine. It is indeed jagged and coarse at times, lacking the Old World comeliness of Orval, but on the other hand, I can also appreciate the robust flavors and unabashed funkiness. Drink what floats your boat.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 24, 2014"

It bills itself as an Orval-inspired beer, and I'll say this: the heavy use of Brett and the fact that this beer is wonderful fresh or with a good amount of age on it definitely put it in the same company with Orval. However, to its credit, it is a different and interesting beer in its own right. Just a fantastically imaginative beer from GF and I can't really think of anything in the U.S. that is quite like it--or maybe quite like it and as good.","LambicPentameter","Beers"

Ale is a copper to amber color, slightly cloudy. Heavy lace. Excellent strong malt and bread like smell. Taste of sweet malt, mild hops and of sour fruit.

Aroma of light bready malt, both Belgian and wild yeast, Belgian spicing and a hint of citrus. Flavor is very light bready malt with a strong dose of Bretty wild yeast and hints of apple and stone fruit juice. Finishes with lingering wild yeast and light hops. Light bodied. I'm not a huge fan of wild yeasts, but enjoy a touch of Brett or wild yeast to a sufficiently complex ale; this one did not support the level of wild yeast to my taste.

Flavor is fruity, apple, lemon, honeydew and grain, some clay and a touch of strep mutans (maybe that's my mouth though). Medium bodied with now minimal carb and an off dry finish.

An impressive bouquet of aromas delight the senses with whiffs of lemon zest, spices, Belgian yeast and funk. Sweet malt flavors reminiscent of bread and caramel open the palate to more subtle notes of citrus and pepper with Belgian yeast and Brettanomyces funk underlining the entire brew. Extremely effervescent, this Green Flash brew is highly carbonated and medium bodied.","phishsihq","May 30, 2013"

Lots going on in the nose on this one. Flavors are roasty and sharp, with a caramel and bready backbone supporting a blending of spices, including all spice, clove, and lemon zest.

This was a pretty good Belgian Ale but it just seemed a little underwhelming/simplistic at times for me, although I did have to let it warm since the idiot bar I went to served it in a frozen mug and called it a triple. I am not excluding this fact as it may have killed off some of the more subtle belgian charateristics and ended up in my lower score.","clayrock81","Mar 16, 2013"

Poured at a good temperature with a colossal, off-white, foamy, uber frothy, billowy head that lasts a loooong time and some clingy lace. Color is a clear honey amber with loads of small bubble trails. Aroma is spice, herbal, yeast, fruit, malt, and very complex. Flavor's similar to nose; bitter and tang are predominant while not being overdone and still, with the other qualities, still enticing. Body is lively, a tad thin, but still good. Finish is like flavor, long, and in spite of boldness, quite drinkable. World class beer! Hope to try it on draft.","drpimento","Feb 27, 2013"

The scent was mostly the Brettanomyces funk, barnyard/horse scent, but also a very slight hint of Belgian yeast and pine. The flavor again, is dominated by Brettanomyces, a sour funk, there are also slight hints of lemon and tastes of piney hops on the finish and aftertaste. It's odd, but quite pleasant to the taste. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, but I don't feel that it detracts from the beer in any way, and rather, seems to help it. While I could due with a slight hint more malt flavors, it's still quite good and is a nice showcase of Brettanomyces and Belgian yeast which I enjoy the flavors of greatly. It's an excellent beer and I'd have it again.","Auraan","Feb 25, 2013"

The herbal, near mint tea, blends smoothly with the stubborn earthy grain for a somewhat unique mouthful of Belgian nuance. Medium bodied with a crisp feel, this is entirely loveable! Another nice Green Flash!","Durge","Beers"

As usual, the aroma carries into the flavor and they're very similar here. The yeast really stands out with it's mineral and leather character, but the fruitiness is pretty strong as well. Additionally given the fact that this may be spiced, it's hard to tell exactly what the yeast has contributed and what's coming from the hops and the spice. It's complex, but at the same time it's the same complexity all the way through. Still, it's an interesting and bold beer that you can't ignore - think Orval with west coast hops on steroids.","NeroFiddled","Aug 25, 2012"

Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, lime, herbal, pepper, pine, earth, floral, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, orange zest, pine, herbal, pepper, clove, earth, floral, light funk, toast, and yeast spiciness. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pepper, pine, herbal, floral, earth, toast, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Awesome flavor complexity and balance; very nice hop/yeast flavor balance. Quite crisp and fairly clean on the finish. Fairly high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian pale ale! A lot of nice hop flavors with yeast spiciness; a nice clean finish, and very smooth to drink. Great stuff.","superspak","Aug 25, 2012"

The citrus from the hops comes first on the taste, but this quickly followed by the Brett. The Brett brings that nice sour flavor. The malt profile is there, bringing some sweetness to this beer that I picked up in the aroma. The flavor profile strongly reminds me of Orval.

It has developed quite nicely over the last year; the live yeast taking on a more acerbic tone. The pineapple forward yeast definitely makes me wish that this was 100% fermented with Brettanomyces, ala Russian River's Sanctification rather than just bottle conditioned with it.

4.17,8.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Rayon Vert pours a nearly opaque burnt orange, lightening a fair bit along the edges when backlit. The fluffy white head tops out at more than four fingers worth of foam, and shows pretty good retention. Lacing is noticeably weak compared to some of its authentic Belgian brethren. The nose is both aromatic and complex. The brett quickly jumps out as I inhale, surprisingly potent for a relatively young bottle. There's lots of wet hay and lemon juice, with some light pepper and horse blanket present as well. Hops do a beautiful job of filling in the gaps, lending both herbal and light tangerine-grapefruit citrus aromas. The flavor manages to follow through on just about all the promise of the nose, delivering lots of funk buttressed by some well chosen hops. Those same hops though provide a touch too much bitterness, and it just becomes abrasive against the delicate balance of flavors otherwise present. The mouthfeel is superb, with a dry and crisp body and carbonation that's sneaky in how bubbly it is. Rayon Vert is a close domestic substitute for Orval, and that's pretty high praise.","axeman9182","Apr 22, 2012"

3.9,1.8,4,4,4,3,4,"This beer tastes almost exactly like my first attempt at brewing a wild ale. The style is defined here as Belgian Pale Ale, though with a brett yeast that asserts itself pretty heavily this beer is more than a pale. Dry, musty, musky, aroma and flavor. Woody, earthy, maybe some mushroom/mineral quality. Not a sweet beer at all for those of you who are looking for something that's heavy on malts. My only complain is that the mouthfeel is maybe a little thin, but otherwise for $10 a 4 pack at Whole Foods this beer is a steal. I've had Green Flash Belgians before where the yeast just didn't match the malt profile, but this one is spot on.

Cloudy liquid with a strong orange rust metallic coloration, perhaps a light brown tint while more yellow at the rims, loosely assembled but large bubbles rise swiftly throughout. Yeast, flowers, orange peel, wheat germ, apples and pears comprise most of the nose, some earthiness but not really as funky as one might expect, good density but lacks staying power. Full-bodied, here in the mouth it’s creamy and bottom heavy, sinks deeply into the palate. Develops a peppery kick as well as added grassiness, supports the tartness of the orange, lemon citrus and clove. Vague minerally aspect but, again, clean on the whole. Dry, the pear, peach, apple fruit feels cellar dried, most of the sweet juiciness gone. Manages to not appear overtly hoppy nor malty, minimal breadiness or doughiness. The citrus outlasts the rest.

4.32,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall, this is very good beer, and surprising in the potency and balancing effect of the hops, setting this brew firmly aside from most of the Belgian Ales. Personally, I find the hops a great addition, and think more beers of this style should follow suit. The beer is still well-balanced, even with the hops. The 7.0% ABV does come out a bit, giving the brew vodka-like alcoholic vapors, and the sourness is slightly strange, but for the most part this is great fare. Worth trying.","jondeelee","Apr 02, 2012"

Sadly, since I haven't yet tried an extensive variety of Belgian-style beers, I feel that the novelty of this beer (with its use of Brett) is a bit wasted on me.

Right now it provides a gentle tang and is beginning to roll over the mild caramel malt taste and Belgian spice. I mean it's clearly a Brett beer. There's the trademark horsey farmhouse funk, but it hasn't overun the ale yet. Very cool beer. Admirably balanced for an American craft brewer, I've had too many failed attempts at sours by domestic breweries.

It interacts nicely with the citrus hop profile often associated with an American IPA, without quite becoming the flavor mishmash often referred to on this site as a Belgian IPA. It's quite complex, with peppery and yeasty flavors contributing to the overall effect. The mouthfeel is extremely carbonated and goes down easily, and the drinkability is good.

I can’t wait to see how these age, but I wonder that the Brettanomyces character is already so pronounced; this can’t be that old yet, and the Brett is extremely noticeable already, young Orval is barely kissed by the Brett, so I will be curious to see how these age. My one worry is that the plastic character from the Brett will get a bit out of control as the beer ages. Visually this beer is about perfect, from memory it seems a touch darker than Orval, but I could be wrong, and the extensive, long lasting head is quite impressive. This beer sets itself apart from Orval in its use of expressive, fruity and citrus laden American hops; as a sucker for many an American hop, I can’t help but love this beer more for that.","Gueuzedude","Feb 17, 2012"

While not quite truly tart, it does come equipped with a driving acidity that strips the palate, ushering renewal with every well-carbonated sip.

Honey and citrus linger on the finish, but the blend of the honey and the Brett isn't particularly impressive right now, making this rather unpleasantly spicy. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this feels pretty decent on the palate, but still, a little too sweet.

The smell is fruit, slight hops and a very subtle hint of the brettanomyces yeast, not bad.

It might as well be the flagship beer for the brewery as much as any of their other offerings. Total quality, through and through. They remain one of the most consistently excellent U.S. brewers, and if the lack of constant new (bottled) offerings is frustrating, it's easy to remind oneself about the quality they continually offer, and then all is A-Okay.","Metalmonk","0"

Scent immediately reminds me of fresh Orval. Brett funk with nice hoppiness. Some citrus and floral notes nicely meshed with barnyard. Taste is ALSO very much like fresh Orval, wow, this can only mean one thing...I LOVE THIS BEER! Disclaimer, I'm drinking this one at room temp, and it's tasting awesome. Immediate floral hoppiness with some slight Belgian yeast flavors. Then you get tasty Brett flavors and barnyard funk. Finishes dry and slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is crisp and somewhat velvety...dry finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is just great IMO. I need to go buy more of this.","DovaliHops","Jan 17, 2012"

Brett complexity is big, but the wildness is reigned in. Orval-esque. Everything is pretty nicely balanced here. Cellaring this would likely bring out the funkier side of the wild yeast. A nice introductory Brett beer that i'll definitely drink more of.","emerge077","Jan 17, 2012"

Quite a bit of brett, vanilla, tart citrus fruit. Taste is not quite as impressive, and a little muddled: brett, moderate citrus and piney hops, finishing bone dry with moderate bitterness. More integration would go a long way. Or maybe the hops have just faded some and that's what I'm picking up; can't tell. Medium-light body and carbonation. Overall, interesting and quite drinkable. Pairs perfectly with spicy Indian or Asian food.","pmarlowe","Jan 14, 2012"
3.73,-2.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Spicy hops and spicier yeast is the motif of Rayon Vert. Leafy, herbal hops combine with Belgian yeast esters and a kiss of funk from the Brettanomyces. The 7% is well hidden until the end, where a hit of warming alcohol flashes across the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly with a dry, medium body. Overall, a fairly tasty beer, but I was expecting a bit more from Green Flash given the ingredients to this beer. Perhaps after a few months of aging the Brett will really start to shine.","wagenvolks","Jan 14, 2012"

There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like citrusy hops (lemon peel, tropical fruit), peppery spice, pears and some bretty funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy hops (apricots, orange peel, tropical fruit), peppery spice, bready malt and a bit of brett. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy and well carbonated. I think it's a good beer. I'll have to try and save a bottle for a while to see how it changes (or evolves as stated on the label), but that's going to be hard to do! The 4-pack was $10.99.","bluejacket74","Dec 21, 2011"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Slghtly hazed copper orange body with a bright white head forming thick and billowing above the rim of my chalice. Fine speckled lacing left behind in the glass. Aroma has a bright lemon/citrus nose with some wild barnyard floral notes as well, amplified compared to some other Belgian pale ales. The brett is really kicking in this beer, especially in the flavor with a bitter layer of earthiness, perfume, lemon zest, horse blanket, barnyard funk. Really unrlenting with the brett, either you dig this or you don't but this is heavy on it. Usually brett flavors tend to develop with age this one seems to have had some time in the bottle already to develop those wild yeast flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit rough with some moderate bitterness, noticeable alcohol, and unrelenting brettanomyces guided phenolics. Carbonation is effervescent much like an Orval with a medium body they really nailed the texture of the mother of all BPAs. Overall this beer lacks the finesse and diversity that Orval has but makes up for in true American style, with aggressive citric hops and noticeable alcohol flavors. Decent but I'm not sold on all of this brett.","WVbeergeek","Dec 20, 2011"
