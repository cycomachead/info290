It should be the same age as the other beers that came in that Belgian pack and all the other ones seemed fine, so this might be and off bottle and I will have to try it, but as it is my rating stands.

Aroma of sweet caramel malt, dried and fresh dark fruit, Belgian yeast. Flavor follows aroma, with dark stone fruit, milder dried dark fruit, sweet caramel malt, apple juice and Belgian yeast, finishes with mild grassy hops. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A pleasant, semi-sweet Belgian pale or amber that is slightly lighter in flavor than I hoped, but well made and balanced. This is somewhat old bottle that has held up quite nicely.","LiquidAmber","Oct 15, 2013"

4.82,38.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I picked this up as part of a six pack sampler of Belgian beer. Poured into a chalice. This beer had to be poured immediately lest the beer would have flowed out the bottle. The beer pours hazy amber with a large white head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice cap of head. This beer appears to be very carbonated. Plenty of lacing is left behind during consumption. The aroma is of sweet caramel and bread. The yeast also brings fruity esters (raisin) as well. It's such a terrific smelling pale ale. The taste follows the nose. It's bready, but also mildly sweet with caramel and raisin flavors. There's also some mild spices and a somewhat grassy flavor. The hop bitterness is low. The flavors aren't strong or cloying, but milder and very enjoyable. The body is light with high carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer. If you find this beer, you should definitely try it.","acevenom","Jul 25, 2012"

Overall this is a beer that I wouldn't mind coming back to if I wanted a flavorful light gravity beer, this is one of the better ones that I have had recently. This seems to be a fresh example of this beer, and I am sure that this particular one from the batch would last very long. I may go back and re-review the Piraat beer again from this pack because the last one I reviewed was a bit stale. Anyway, I would not deter anyone from trying this beer, and I hope that you get to try as fresh of as an example of it as I obviously am.","SkeeterHawk","Jul 03, 2011"

Not much in the way of hops on the nose.The body is better than medium although it breaks down into carbonation quickly on the tongue.

3.77,8.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I picked this one first from the sample pack simply because it was mid-day and it was the only bottle with an ABV less than 6%. Good choice. Nice (light) maple syrup color with decent carbonation (I also had the bottle foam over the top before pour). Malt and subtle floral hops in the nose. Initial taste was similar--very mild yet interesting flavors, though never any negative bitterness or off flavors. Nothing too complex but quite drinkable. I enjoyed it.","tugdriver7","Feb 28, 2011"
3.83,10.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a pale reddish amber, filtered, with a tall, highly retentive head. Mild aroma of caramel, grains, and light fruit notes with moderate to subtle complexity. Has a pretty decent flavor, similar to the aroma, with aspects of caramel, well balanced--with grassy hops and some clear candy's poking through. Moderately full bodied, like a traditional authentic Belgian ale. Smooth through the swallow with a slightly dry finish. Living up to it's namesake as a Belgian pale ale, perhaps lacking a bit in ester complexity, but enjoyable nonetheless. Worthy of a spring or summer's eve.","xodin","Feb 23, 2011"

Smells of malt, pear, apple, and more malt. Taste flavors of malt, and hops for the most part. Full and rich creamy feeling, very appealing.

Nose is decidedly in the style of American amber ales. Kind of malty nose, nothing unique in the hops to really sink your teeth into. Taste is about on par with a mediocre American Amber ale. From the bottle, I was hoping for an amber ale with Belgian yeast. It was definitely nothing that interesting. Congratulations Van Steenbredge, you've brewed a mediocre american amber and put it into a Duvel bottle. The only reason this beer is getting a B average rating on this site is the name of the brewery obscuring folks' taste buds.

Sweet caramel and bread malt balanced by a sharp bitter dryness, hints of grass and apple, light lemon, touch of spiciness from the yeast. Drinks a little more to the American Pale Ale side than some, but the yeast profile, while not dominant, gives it away. Moderate carbonation, more on par than many others in this sixer.

The mouthfeel is watery. effervescent with a thin spritzy body. The taste is kinda flimsy and a recap of the aroma. The bitterness is chemical in nature, non-descript, and pretty strong, overwhelming the other flavors.. Strong metallic flavor which overwhelms any subtle qualities of the beer.

The taste is pretty similar, holding notes of citrus zest, Belgian-tastic yeast, a small dose of saison-like funk, greenery, floral bitters, and a light background tinge of caramel.

I was pleasantly surprised as I poured it. A nice 3 inch head erupted from the bottle leaving some nice soapy lacing as the beer recedes from my glass. The nose contains a lot of pale malts, a slight hint of apples and just a little butter. No real spiciness. The flavor is dull. Once again, pale malts dominate the profile with just a hint of fruit. Not much more. Just a vague hint of yeast. No much in terms of adding to the flavor profile, more along the line of yeasty biscuits. The mouthfeel is dry and unassuming.

The taste, however, was rather sharp, and not really what I expected.

A massive layer of stickiness is provided by the Belgian ales malt complexity bringing sugary layers to the surface, a very nice table beer.

It pours a clear golden amber, with very little head and lacing on the glass, caused by my Goblet I'm certain. The smell isn't anything noteworthy, malts, yeast straight-forward. The taste again has nothing else to it really, very simple brewed beer. No need to mess with fancy ingredients like DFH here, no. The taste however is crisp and moderately sweet and Bruegel drinks really well. I finished the beer faster than expected just because you can tip it back and not really feel the effect of the alcohol or sit and focus on the different traits of the beer.

The sour and the sweet carries over to the flavor along with a noticeable bread dough. Finishes smooth and leaves a vegetable flavor like limes and celery. Odd, but rather tasty. I must say, that I kept thinking that I was drinking a Lager. Very strange, but not in a bad way. The mouth feel is thick with sparse big bubbles that are actually quite a bit of fun.

A subdued hint of hops over perhaps a hint of cheese or vomit, but not entirely unpleasant. Initial taste is buttery/fruity. Type of fruit is debatable: I say apples. A pointed lack of acid.

I have to pour a bit at a time or risk overflow. At least three fingers' worth. The aroma has that distinct belgian spiciness, yeasty and fruity, with a soft sting of floral hops. Musty belgian malt, candi sugar sweetness, and plenty of pear and banana. The flavor opens up muted, a bit lackluster. Muddled malt toastiness feels a little weak, moving aimlessly into a fruity middle, tinted with a bit of honeyed oxodization. Decent enough pear flavor, a little banana sneaking through. Some spiciness from the yeast, a bit of a phenolic cloviness, and a flicker of floral hops. Finishes watery and weak on the palate, with a bit of a banana peel bitterness way back in the aftertaste. Some cardboardy dryness, with strong champagne-like carbonation. Decent enough to try once, but nothing I'd go back to unless it were the local beer.

The liquid is polluted with bubbles; there is an insane amount of carbonation racing towards the oversized off-white head. I couldnt fit all the beer in the goblet due to the massive head (easily, there is three fingers worth of foam). In a moment the head faded to a moderate cap that lasted the entire consumption. There was tons of subsequent lacing, massive globs of residue. Overall the appearance is pleasant. The nose doesnt say much; all I get is lightly spiced marshmallows with some equally light fruity notes (tropical in nature). Hints of toasted caramel too. I like what I smell but I need way more aroma and complexity for me to deem this beer inviting. Simplistic. The palate is yawn inducing. I drink and I drink I think and I think. What do I taste? Anything of note? I sense some sweetness like marshmallows. There are some soft spicy notes, basically nondescript however. Orange peel. There is some bittersweet candy that ends on a dry note. There seems to be a very weak suggestion of caramel. Fruity flavors are characterless. Light bitterness. The modest level of alcohol is hidden, as it should be. Cleaner than Id like, where is the dirty yeasty funk? Basically this beer is a session ale, Belgian-style. That is cool I suppose but this beer doesnt impress me much. It is too bland for me to be compelled to drink more than one of. Maybe this beer would be better suited some other time, maybe not. The palate, on the whole, is fair. Medium in body, creamy, filling carbonation that produces a mouthfeel that is enjoyable but its nothing special. It does fit this beer well though. Drinkable? Sure, I guess. I mean why drink it? A session beer should have more flavor, period. A low abv is a must, done. A tasty quaff is a must too, not done. No matter how I look at this beer it is just okay nothing more, nothing less. Honestly, I dont dislike it yet I dont like it either. I was so unimpressed I finished my glass with a bologna sandwich. It is an average beverage.

This monster produced one of the biggest, most unstoppable heads of ivory foam I've ever seen. Just would not stop and it took nearly ten minutes to get it in the glass. The smell is great - yeasty and malty with a few caramel and fruit notes as it warmed. The flavors tend to be a bit tart and yeasty, decent enough, but not awe-inspiring. Somewhat thin on body and fairly drinkable. A decent ale to try again down the road.","AtLagerHeads","Jul 07, 2003"
2.97,-14.7,3,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"It's unique for the style and worth trying for posterity's sake. Nothing much stands out here except for the carbonation level, which can lower drinkability if you consider how many of those bubbles will be dancing on your head in the morning.","brewdlyhooked13","Jun 06, 2003"
3.23,-7.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pour very slowly, it was very foamy which had a hazy yellow orange color and loads of tight foam and heavy retention from start to finish on side of glass. The smell of yeast with a since of a brut champagne. The taste was not fruity but had an contemplative bouquet firm body, profound hop bitterness and a short, dry finish.","BeerManDan","Apr 02, 2003"
3.75,7.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I must of moved the bottle too much because it opened as a boy beer. Nice mix in aroma a yeastiness, slight malt and some phenol. (Jason noted Juicey Fruit which a caught a whiff of). Big full head Attractive appearance of amber with orange, mostly clear with some slight cloudiness. Flavor has many of the same qualities as the aroma, esp. the yeasty quality, banana with the phenol, enough malt backing, with a short slightly dry finish. Their is a thinness to it that's unusual for where it came from. Makes it easier to drink. Mouthfeel is improved with nice contribution of carbonation and softness. Nonetheless, enough complexity to qualify as a decent Belgian, just there are others that are much better overall. Still, several of these could make a fine evening.","garymuchow","Mar 28, 2003"
3.63,4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A clear, dark amber/copper body is topped by a full, pillowy white head that holds exceptionally well and keeps a thin creamy surface covering throughout the goblet. The nose is pleasantly yeasty, somewhat earthy and a touch fruity. It's light body is boosted by a vibrant carbonation. It's lightly zesty on the tongue at first, but becomes a bit creamier as you progress through the glass. The flavor is softly malty with a bitterness that makes itself known, but goes no further - perfectly balancing the beer and leaving a refreshingly dry finish! A good example of a basic Belgian pale ale that's easy to drink and refreshing; but one that may seem thin when compared to others.","NeroFiddled","Mar 10, 2003"
3.41,-2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a fierce head, took ten minutes just to empty the bottle. Head is thick and frothy but leaves little lace. Cloudy yellow color not at all amber looking. Quiet tasting, light malt and light hoppiness not bad but disappointing for a Belgian.","jdhilt","Mar 08, 2003"
3.35,-3.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"On my second visit with this beer, my opinions didn't change much. I discerned a fruitiness in the finish, found the palate to be smooth and refreshing, and complimented the balance. Moreover, I recognized the folly in my facetious remark, and realized the beer for what it is meant to be : a light ""peasant"" beer. Your party's over pretty quick if your beer is something like Gulden Drak, and same for your aspirin supply! Of course, they drank a lot of it, they're REVELLERS. At least they had better beer than you'd find at a contemporary American house party, where you're likely to guzzle on a High Life, or sumpin'.","feloniousmonk","Feb 20, 2003"
3.73,7.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A great looking beer. Pours a slightly hazy orange-amber color with a huge custard-like head. My daughter walked into the room right after I poured, saw the beer, and said ""ice cream!"" I keep a long handled spoon with an opener on the other end by my computer and she grabbed it in hopes of getting a spoonful on the head. Yeasty aroma at the front followed by fruity (apple?) notes. Smells a lot like a Heffe-weisse. Pretty light tasting, fruity with a slight bitterness. Cloves are present too, very hefe-like. Decent mouthfeel with good carbonation. Pretty drinkable, but not as complex as I was hoping for.","cretemixer","Jan 29, 2003"
4.45,27.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Monumental fruity nose dominated by fresh lime but carrying hints of berries and apple. The lime is hauled into the draught but is soon unloaded to make room for a pleasant malt and hop balance that lingers until you push your face into the glass anew. Charged, not choking, and strikingly unique.","inebrius","Dec 30, 2002"
2.77,-20.4,4.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a light copper/orange colour topped by a thick beautifull head. This beer has an excellent appearance but i think that that's just it. It's a shame really such a beautiful beer to be ""killed"" by the taste and aroma. Taste and aroma are average and maybe below average in comparison with other European pale ales. Brewery Van Steenberge is one of the best and most known breweries worldwide and i'm surprised that this beer comes under this brewery. And again this is just my humble opinion, i don't want to take anyone with me ;-)","ipogios","Dec 04, 2002"
3.74,7.5,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"True to its name, this beer is an extremely attractive amber in color.  Mostly clear, very well carbonated, with a medium-sized, slightly foamy head. The aroma is fruity Sweet and slightly tart.  Hints of yeast.  Flavor demonstrates good hop presence from start to finish.  Overripe strawberries and a milt malt sweetness come in mid-palate, with a slightly dry but balanced finish and a pleasant bready aftertaste. Effervescence gives this a medium-light seeming body.  I grow fonder of this beer the longer I let it warm, and by the end am quite ready for another.","mzwolinski","Nov 11, 2002"
2.69,-22.7,4.5,3,2,3,3,"A great looking beer. Pours orange-copper with a huge, creamy, frothy, chunky head. Lots of lace clings to the glass. Aromas of yeast, fruit and pepper. Light to mediu, body with a smooth-creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat bland flavor, not much too it. Has hints of tarty citrus and fruit with slight spice. Finishes dry and metallic. The metallic taste lingers for a while and makes you reach for something to help get the taste out of your mouth. Bit of a let-down after such a lovely appearance. Disappointing.","Lupe","Nov 03, 2002"
3.25,-6.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The color and it pours from the bottle unclouded amber with a planetary sized head that is creamy in texture and it slowly erodes a thick and sticky sheet of lace forms to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt with a nice hint of caramel and an over ripe fruit aroma also noticed. Start is lightly sweet, malt, top is slight, the finish is adequately hopped, acerbic, long lasting dry aftertaste.","Gusler","Oct 20, 2002"
3.08,-11.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Slightly above average Amber Ale. Thick lively head, orange/caramel color. Clean taste with a dry, somewhat bitter finish. I had trouble detecting much aroma in this. There are a lot of better Belgians out there.","Dogbrick","Oct 10, 2002"
3.33,-4.3,4.5,4,3,3,3,"Beautiful looking beer!  Orang-copper with a huge, creamy head.  Lots of CO2 apparent in the body - perhaps too much carbonation.  Nice aroma of fruit, peppery spice, and yeast begin to make my mouth water...The taste, however, isn't that great.  It's not bad, but like a few others, I was expecting a bit 'more' (for lack of a better word).  It's a bit bland, really.  Has a very light tart and fruity taste with a very dry, but slightly spicy and metallic finish.  All of that carbonation gives this brew a very rough and almost acidic feel on the tongue.  It's certainly a drinkable brew, but even if I had another I think I'd reach for something else.","Viking","Sep 15, 2002"
3.3,-5.2,4,4,3,3,3,"This amber/orange brew throws a nice, dense rocky head that is well retained.  Belgian lace is nice.  The nose consists of yeasty breadiness and herbal spices.  The mouthfeel is very carbonated, almost like a champagne.  Body is light to medium.  And the taste is very neutral.  I like the spice touch.  Seems to be spiced similar to a wit:  orange curacao and corriander.  Also get a slight toasted quality with subtle yeast tones present also.  The drinkability factor is pretty average due to the high carbonation.","Bighuge","Aug 12, 2002"
3.54,1.7,5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Bruegel Ale:  Great looking beer, with deep copper haze, and a huge, huge head  (three inches over the rim!)  Nice citrus/Weiss/yeast aroma, not overstated.  I liked this beer, had nice malt sweetness, with citrus flavors in the deep background, and a clean dry finish.","jackndan","May 18, 2002"
2.73,-21.6,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Golden abber in color.  lots of very small bubbles and a big white head.  Sweet yeasty nose.  The taste disappoints in relation to the appearence.  Not much body and it lacks the yeast character other begians have.  There is also a slight metalic finish to the taste.  This brew misses the mark.","frank4sail","May 02, 2002"
