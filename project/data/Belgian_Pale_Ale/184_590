3.5,-5.9,,,,,,"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18A). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 08:59 K17D14. AROMA: sweet and spicy aroma background with some orange notes. some perfumy and honey-like alcohol aromas. APPEARANCE: intense gold color and translucent but with deposit that may give a very hazy appearance. good moussy white head with good retention and lacing. TASTE: smooth flavours with light notes of sweetness, esters (orange like) and spicy alcohols. medium-low bitterness with a medium-sweet finish. no hop flavours noticeable. PALATE: medium-low body with high carbonation. smooth alcohol warmth. OVERALL: an average exemple of a classic belgian blond ale (altough La Trappe is brewed in the Netherlands).","titvs","Oct 28, 2014"

3,-19.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Poured from .33cl bottle into snifter glass. Pours a mild hazy light orange body with some sediments and a medium lasting fluffy white head. Aroma is citrus, spice, grapefruit, yeast and mild sweet grapes. Lightly sweet flavors, low bitterness and a distinct yeasty flavor. Earthy notes and picking up a little "cork" flavor throughout - not too pleasant for me. This gives a mild citrus and hay finish with a lasting orange and almost pepper-spicy aftertaste. Body is medium, medium carbonation and has a oily to sticky mouthfeeling.","CuriousMonk","Jun 05, 2011"
3.8,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its aroma. We found, here, inclusions of wheat and sweetening esters, which helped raise it from a standard, or dull beer, in this category. The taste, however, did fall a bit flat. It began nicely, but by the end of the sip, and even more so by the end of the glass, the taste became metallic and capable of overwhelming the palate.","TheBrewo","Feb 25, 2011"

Off-white head left behind some light, sticky lacing during the tasting. Scents of green apple, pear and alcohol. Taste consistent with nose but flavor profile, combined with mouthfeel, made this brew seem closer to a lightly carbonated aperitif/cordial, than a beer. Mildly effervescent mouthfeel fell somewhere between light- and medium-bodied. Finish was more dry than sweet.

Alcohol is somewhat detectable, felt a bit of warmth as I was taking as sip, just there in the aftertaste, where vanilla reigns. Would've liked something a bit more crisp and not quite so full in body. Usually I'd get off on a full body, but that coupled with lower carbonation just makes this low alcohol, sweet, and very unbalanced(as it should be-BPA, I mean supposed to be malty) ale not all that great in the mouth, a bit more carbonation would be nice as well. This is definitely one of the more unique Belgian Pale Ales I've had. I must say that this is one that I don't prefer over the others I've had. Though I am most likely comparing this brew to the likes of Duvel, it should still have a similar, yet toned down flavor...I just think that the almost cloying vanilla makes it hard to drink more than one of these in a sitting. All in all in my opinion this one is too cloying, I mean I got this with a gift set which included a goblet, goblets are for deep sips...I try that with this and almost gag because I find it too cloying.

3.89,4.6,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is a very pleasant tasting ale. Poured out a slightly hazed golden color with one of the most attractive heads of foam I can remember. Huge, rocky, dense and creamy. The aroma was slightly sticky sweet with candy sugar with some fruitiness. Taste was lightly sweet and sour, with some yeast. There was no hiding the alcohol in this beer  it came right through. On the whole, this was a very enjoyable and light Belgium ale.","pezoids","Sep 19, 2003"

3.95,6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Carefully poured, this blonde delivers a clear amber body with yellow-gold highlights. It's a little bit darker than might be expected; but its frothy off-white head holds rather well and leaves some nice lace before settling to a creamy 1/4" head. A sweetish, candy and honey-like malt resides in the nose - very mead-like in a way. It's not complex, but it is clean and nice. The body is medium/light; and it's gently zesty on the tongue before warming to become just lightly creamy with a very fine, median carbonation. The semi-rich honeyish malt dominates the flavor throughout, balanced by a solid bitterness and a light wash of alcohol; and it finishes dry with a mild note of fruity malt that lingers in the mouth. A nice beer that's straightforward and enjoyable although the alcoholtends to come forward a bit too much at times.","NeroFiddled","Jul 24, 2003"

3.66,-1.6,4,3,3.5,5,4,"This brew has a fruity floral aroma. It poured a nice long lasting head of small and medium white bubbles that left a good lacing. Its body is a nice cloudy amber brown color. Initial taste caught me off guard but later settled into something nice. Nice drinkable brew with a mellow subtle flavor.","TheDM","Jul 08, 2003"
4.5,21,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very pleasant coppery gold color. The head was light and short lived. The nose is exceptionally sweet and spiced malt with hop notes. The flavor is moderately dry malt and lightly hopped. There is some really unique spice notes here that are very difficult to identify. The taste is clean and the mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. Very good Belgian here  Try it  I highly recommend this one","AtrumAnimus","Jul 04, 2003"
2.76,-25.8,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Is this different somehow than the "old" La Trappe Blond? Seems quite a bit worse than the alter-ego, from what I recall.","cokes","Jul 03, 2003"
3.35,-9.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"Poured a bright golden color and was very high in carbonation, with a very large head. The aroma is very light and pleasant, mildly spiced and citrusy. The taste also was very soft and smooth, a tiny hint of malt sweetness on the front with a crisper finish. Both the aroma and the taste did seem a little cidery, very reminiscent of my first attempt at homebrewing. The head was around for the whole glass, and left a lot of lacing. This was my first trappist ale, and I was surpised. I had expected something a little stronger, a little sweeter - basically something just a little bit "out there" compared to what I am used to. So unfortunately I can't comment on whether this suits the style, however, the rating it currently has seems to state that it is not the best representation of a trappist ale, however I did enjoy it nonetheless.","nixhecks","Jun 18, 2003"
3.18,-14.5,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability/notes: I found this to be a pleasant and inoffensive beer, which I would characterize as Trappist Light. Its probably a good beer to offer to someone who is new to Trappist-style ales, although connoisseurs of true Trappist Ales will probably be disappointed.","Pegasus","May 12, 2003"
4.5,21,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy bright golden orange color with a very tall and pillowy white head that coats the walls of the glass as it slowly fades into a creamy lace. Nose is quite fruity with notes of fresh banana, clove, and nutmeg. Smooth and extremely creamy in the mouth and medium in body. Taste is dominated by creamy banana with additional flavors of fresh citrus, ripe peaches, clove, nutmeg, and vanilla. Very nice! Im surprised to see some of the low ratings for this beer as I found it to be a real pleasure to drink. Reminds me a lot of a Hefeweizen but a bit more complex.","Morris729","Feb 23, 2003"
3.07,-17.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Clear golden in color, with a full, frothy, white head. Nose is subtle, but still fruity, spicy, notes of butter, bubblegum, and bananas. More fruits come through later, primarily peach, apricot, citrus. Good hops on the sweet palate, but they lay low afterwards. An oily, slick feeling takes over. Malt feels insufficient, texture is far too thin, and watery, body is slight. Overall, a disappointment. This was never my favorite style of the La Trappes, but that one was never this bad. I could taste test them, as there are still some La Trappes hanging around, but that would mean buying another bottle of this!","feloniousmonk","Feb 20, 2003"
4.38,17.7,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I've had all the La Trappe beers, and I must say that I didn't know if this one would hold up against the other three. I saw "Blond" on the bottle and expected something wimpy. Of course, I should have known better. This beer was great. Maybe even my favorite of the four . . . ?","Quaffer","Feb 07, 2003"
3.8,2.2,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear deep gold, with a persistant white head. Aroma is musty and sweet and reminds me a bit of a barn... some hay in the aroma. Flavor of sour fruits... a bit of spice (sage?) with a touch of sweetness. Has a thin body and a velvety mouthfeel. Very declicate flavor, that didn't live up to what I expected after the setup that the aroma gave. A pretty good beer, but not one I'm likely to seek out.","zerk","Dec 27, 2002"
3.83,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Hazy peach color, minimal head in a La Trappe chalice. Laces downward in drips. Sweet smells, "circus peanut candy" banana-like aromas. Flavors follow the smell, senses of estery notes, a bit of cinnamon spiciness in the only slightly dominant malt. Medium-high carbonation -- light, but not fizzy, mouthfeel. I liked the hopping in this one, not a lot of flavor but a good amount of hot bitter sense to balance the brew. Nice beer, puts brews like Leffe Blonde in a back seat. Not a favorite in the overall world of beerdom, but a drinkable rendition of style.","ADR","Dec 19, 2002"
3.41,-8.3,4,3,3,3.5,4.5,"Brilliantly clear golden hue, covered by a large bubbled head that recedes into a spotty, but persistent thin layer. Lace is left. Light banana and bubblegum esters upfront in aroma, with secondary notes of phenol and herbal hops. Crisp, somewhat assertive bite of carbonation is perceived at first, then mellows sufficiently to allow mild bready malt sweetness and clove to dominate. Well attenuated and dry, with the light residual sweetness adequately balanced by the low hop bitterness. Crisp, lightly dextrinous mouthfeel conducive to good quaffability. Finishes dry and mostly clean, with continuing notes of fading clove. La Trappe Blond is a tame and understated Belgian pale ale. Its main strength lies in its refreshing nature and high drinkability. Quite enjoyable, but not outstanding. This was the 11.2 oz bottle.","marc77","Dec 10, 2002"
3.4,-8.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Gold color. Nice white head that is lasting. Hops and smoke in the back of your nose. Big alcohol malt flavor. Medium to light body. Slight smoke taste to the finish. Not a special beer, but an ok selection.","frank4sail","Dec 06, 2002"
4.08,9.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This beer poured a golden color and formed a nice sudsy white head with some nice lace.  Some carbonation.  Definate aroma of hops and some citrus.  The flavor was of hops and citrus.  The finish was slightly tangy, no doubt due to the carbonation and citrus.  A good beer.","Wildman","Jul 20, 2002"
2.95,-20.7,5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Notes: Gets better around cellar temp. as suggested on the back label (50-55*F). Not a bad brew but more of an acquired taste. The astringent / slight oxidized character seems to take over mostly. Oddly this brew is filtered and there is no form of secondary fermentation in the bottle which is totally associated with this style of beer hence the formation of oxidation and corkiness in the beers character.","BeerAdvocate","Sep 23, 2000"
