"Really didn't care for this one. Found it overcarbed and stale tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not for me.  Way too bready."
""
"Draught @ Monk’s Cafe: It was a lower lighting, but it appeared to be a fairly clear amber color. There was a big frothy off-white head on it that left some lacing. It has a nice nose. A fairly good amount of hops: mainly grapefruit and pine. A little bit of pepperiness and yeast. The taste is very good. It has a bit of a bite. Citrus and earthiness, some pepper, yeast and breadiness. Nice."

"Well rounded and balanced flavor profile with Belgian yeast running the show but not being out of hand. A good mix of fruity and spicy all while retaining a certain smoothness."

"O- Really pleasant. I enjoy the nice hop characteristic  in this. Good balance of the spice and hop."
""

"A decent Belgian-style ale that has ups and downs, resulting in a nice refreshing  beer, light, easy to drink, but not that interesting."

"Mouth is med bod, fairly creamy, lots of carb.4"

"Overall: Good for the most part, but the funk gets to you, not the kind of funk I like in a beer."

"Well made of great ingredients."
"Generous extra from a trade a while back with sarge27. Enjoyed from a lost Abby teku. The bottle had some funk on the to of the bottle by the cork but opened without incident. Brew poured a semi transparent orange with a generous frothy head Anne chunky lacing. Nose is a bit grassy with some fruity highlights of the apple pear family. Taste follows suit a this one is an earthy fruity saison. Easy drinker with prickly carbonation. Not mind blowing, but an enjoyable beverage as the weather starts to show signs of spring."

"Rich golden colored with great clarity. Brussels lacing. A thin layer of white foam barely covers the top. I smell pale malt and floral hops. The mouth is moderately carbonated and crisply refreshing. There's plenty of pale malt and floral hops in the taste. The Belgian hops really kick in on the fade."

"O-nice golden ale or pale ale more golden to me easy to drink its just not outstanding falla a tad short"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would have again; worth trying."
"A really interesting brew in how it's Belgian and also hoppy. A crisp beer that offers medium flavor that makes it an ""everyday"" type of beer."
""
"""Devotion"" is seriously devoted to delivering excellence in Belgian flavor, balance, complexity and palatability. Though the ale seems effortless, its painstaking recipe formulation and brewing execution does not go unnoticed."

"O: A very nice beer, easy to drink, but with something to think about. I can easily finish the bottle and could probably think about having another 750ml. Overall, a good beer that is definitely worth trying, would appeal to a wide range of beer lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An enjoyable Belgian style beer. Easy to see how this would be great for summer. Light enough to be thirst quenching but substantial enough for a bit of a kick. Beautiful body and enjoyable nose. Delicious biscuit malt finish. The dry hopping made it much more hoppier than I anticipated. The citrus notes were nice, but the more bitter hoppy notes were not as enjoyable. Though I imagine that's what walking through of field of noble hops probably smells like."

"Bit confused by this beer. It promised a lot, and my issue is that the flavour's actually a bit insipid. Feels like there's a lot in this beer but the flavour is not felt in any meaningful way."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was actually a pretty disappointing drop from Lost Abbey, who have genuinely done some of my favourite beers. This is reasonably pedestrian even for a standard Belgian Pale. While it's drinkable, it really doesn't bring anything interesting or exciting to the table: as a result I can't really think of when I'd choose to drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: I'm liking my first Lost Abbey selection so far. Half the bottle to go. It was not cheap at $9.50, but the bottle is hefty good quality as is the cork and cage capping, although I had to use a corkscrew to get the cork out, and it swelled too much and was too dense to go back in the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"This sounds stupid likely, but as soon as I drank this I thought of being back in Belgium.  Lost Abbey nailed this one.  Pours a light copper color and a small amount of lacing.  Beer retained its head for some time.  A very yeasty sweet smell hits you right away along with a nice balance of malts.  Nicely carbonated on a hot day, and it just tasted so damn good.  Another plus is the 6.3 abv...not overwhelming like many in this category.  Great beer"
""
"Pours a nice golden with a soild quilt of creamy, tortuous head. Smells of grain, yeast, a little clove and vine, simple nose. Flavor is grain, metal, some botanicals, a little yeast, a little something I can't put my finger on but I like. Medium bodied with soft carb and a wet finish. I like. I would like more in a 12oz bottle for $2 each ish."

"O: Refreshing and easy to drink with a lower ABV than a lot of other examples in the style and very well hidden alcohol. Pretty well balanced between sweetness, bitterness, and spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is also alive with citrus and pale malts notes, somewhat fruity sweet, and a lingering finish. A nice beer for review #1,200!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as much hop as expected from reading and looking at the label. It's a unique flavor that combines some elements of a blond and a sour. Try if you like cider."
""
""
"The body was very nice, smooth and even, with a nicely dry finish. Drinkability was very good, we were wishing we had another bottle to follow up with. Overall, a very nice brew. Certainly worth your time if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wicked BPA. Happy to be enjoying this beer on draft on a sad day."
""
"Hazy apricot pour, with a small layer of white head. Aroma of stone fruits, light citrus, yeast. Taste was similar to the aroma, notes of peach, apple, pear, essence of citrus, grassy, bready malts and yeast, with a slight herbal/citrus hop presence. Crisp and drinkable, about light-medium in body. A more ""Americanized"" version of a BPA, downplaying the blatant yeasty qualities a bit. Quite nice overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Pretty cool and not one of their $20 375ml offerings which is nice. The Brett wears on you after a while though."

"O: really good take on a Belgian pale ale - certainly one of the better domestic interpretations I've sampled"
""
""
""
"On tap at Capone’s. Served in a sample glass. Crisp and clean. Nice citrus and a bit of white pepper. A bit spicy. Light pilsner malt. Subdued yet complex. Light and dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Middling beer, but drinkable."
""
""
"Beer is light and sweet with a nice almost floral sense to it, a clean saison sort of beer with simple and pleasing flavors. Great finish. I'd have this again."
""
"The beer is hazy and straw yellow with a thick white head that coats the glass in lacing. The aroma offers funk, yeast, grass. Smells great. Nice and malty with a refreshing yeast character. Smooth feel on the palate. Solid."
"On tap. Pours a light hazy golden amber with a two finger white head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is earthy with a light mineral note. There is also a bit of pear and apricot. Not terribly complex, but quite nice. The taste is dry and earthy with light pear and a hint of green apple. The finish is dry and funky. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Solid beer."

"O: A brew in the vein of abbey ales with a nice California twist. As I drink this brew I imagine what life would be like living as a monk: simple, peaceful. and serene. This beer is all about the bringing a piece of monastery life to busy California."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is reminiscent of a Belgian pale ale, with a nice estery flavor along with some hop spice and bittering. I get floral notes, a bit of zestiness, and some hints of cinnamon too."
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear dark golden color with a thinnish bone white head that slowly subsides, but leaves a little stickage on the glass. Smells of sweet pomme fruits and caramel mostly. Spicy almost peppery aroma provides a nice balance to the sweetness of the malts. The flavor is sweet and malty with a little spicy but not much in the way of pepper that was hinted in the aroma. Very dry finish makes this one seem thin. Medium to thin body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Decent Belgian Pale, easy to drink but maybe a little boring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very approachable Belgian Pale. Some Saison qualities as well. I'd order or buy this again."
""
""
"Pours murky orange with large white head that stays around. Smells of apple skins, floral notes, slight funk, and honey. Tastes of apple skins, slight funk, honey, tart and some grassiness. Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. A sweet treat that goes well in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: An interesting take on a Belgian ale here, quite a bit musty and funky. Nothing crazy or too out of place, but compared to its Belgian brethren, this is just a bit above average."
""
""
""

""

"under 10 bucks for a cork and cage 750ml at argonaut on colfax. pours a really pale blonde, brassy color, very cloudy, with a half inch white head which fades to patchy foam on top. smells like subdued spice from belgian yeast and a lot of pale and crystal malt, on the lighter side. less hops in the nose than i anticipated. flavor though is much more hoppy, citrusy in profile and hitting up front and in back about the same. grapefruit zest seems the closest, but its not quite that tart or bitter. a touch of sweetness, and great big yeast flavors round this one out. mouthfeel is very bright on the carbonation with a roughly medium body, made a bit heavier by the sediment suspended within. overall this is refreshing and tasty, but well below the excitement i get from most of their other brews that ive had. still, a nice rendition of the style, especially for an american brew."
""
""
""
""
"From a corked 750 ml bottle, this is a hazy light-golden brew. It presents a bright white, firm head. The aroma is pepper, yeast, pale malt, and herbal-musty hops.The taste is balanced, but maybe a slight tilt to the dry side. Somewhat tart. A fruity, citric acidity comes out in the late tastes. Hop bitterness is present in the finish. The beer's body is a little lighter than expected. Overall, this is a fine beer."
"O: An excellent Belgian Pale Ale. Definitely at the top of the class."
""
"Overall this is really crisp and clean and very well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Overall an enjoyable beer but I found the mouth feel to be a bit lacking for me. A bit too across the board vs. uniform and the flavor retention just was a bit off to me. The yeast did a good job of tying things together but left me drinking too much water like I said."
""
""
""
"O - a very refreshing take on a Belgian pale ale."
""
""
"I liked this Belgian Pale from Lost Abbey. Not incredible, but quite nice."
"It's a little flat, which is a little disappointing, but the taste is nice. I've heard about problems they've had getting it right. It looks like I have one of those bottles. but it still tastes very nice."
"Mouthfeel is very light and lightly carbonated. Good beer- nothing exceptional."
""
""
"O: Overall you need not even close your eyes to imagine your in Belgium. Harmonic yeast and grain combination creates a beautiful drinking experience that is effortlessly smooth and polished from start to finish. The flavor really speaks of the craftsmanship here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great brew. Are we spoiled on high alcohol beers. They toned the booze down, and it works wonderfully. Very drinkable with enough complexity."
"Overall - Not a terribly complex beer but still one that tastes great and is worth the price. The fruit flavours work well with the spiciness and the hops really balance it out. I'd like to try this on fresh on tap."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, herbal hops, and some slightly funky aromas. Taste is very much the same. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is very refreshing and tasty."
""
""
""
"B"
"Pours a hazy orange hue with fluffy bright white head that recedes rather quickly. Honey suckle and apple on the nose along with sweet belgian candy. Floral hop presence rests beneath it all. Slick body and exceptionally smooth. Low carbonation. Tart apple and citric hop finish with a very bready malt body. Lingering subtle sweetness on the lips of honey. A complex yet subtle beer with pretty well blended flavors. Body holds up nicely through the entire sip. Pretty good."
""
"Overall: B. Fine, but would not seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, just not spectacular."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very easy to drink beer. Refreshing with a bit of a spicy note. Enjoyable overall."
"Overall: I find this beer growing on me. It's got a definite ""green"" feel to it, and as I said it reminds me of spring. I would need to be in the right mood, but I would definitely have this beer again."
"O: Very crisp and refreshing, the complexity makes me want to keep sipping. This is a fantastic beer for the nice Spring days like the one we had today."
"Overall this is a decent beer. It's got the proper elements, so I can't complain too much."
"Overall, this is another winner from Lost Abbey. Very easy drinking and well crafted. Recommended."
""
""
""
"The taste starts very crisp and lively with notes of grassy noble hops, grannysmith apple, and lemon. Extreme effervescence upfront quickly turns creamy smooth, opening up sweeter bready malt flavors, spice, and oranges. Towards the finish, this ale gets drier and has a bit of a yeasty band-aid funk / tartness to it mixing with more lemon. The crisp, light, highly carbonated mouthfeel of this brew makes it pretty easy to drink, and there is no hint of alcohol present."
""
"D- Very delightful beer and one that is a new favorite in my ever growing list of Belgian/Belgian-style beers. Recommended to those that like Belgian pale ales."
"A funky little BPA, but not overwhelmingly so, and I think that works in its favor. The hop profile plays well off the funk and other flavors/aromas."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy orange with a puffy head that lasted and left really nice lacing. The smell is like I am drinking this at a bakery. Bready and yeasty with some fruit flavors (apple maybe) and slight zest and a bit of citrus. Taste is a bit blander than the aroma but really nice and refreshing. Hops hit first but mildly and Still Bready and pretty rich for the style (MF comment) I can get some of those fruits and yeast as well with a grassy flavor at the end. Palate is great, soft and rich (as mentioned) so easy to drink. Overall, great example of the style and one I would like to drink more often."
"O - fantastic beer, the smell makes the beer. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"This really grew on me. At first I didn't think this was anything special, but I noticed the complex flavors in the beer due to the malt and yeast. This, combined with the strong hop flavor, won me over. The flavors of a Belgian Pale Ale and a dry hopped American Pale Ale blended very well, and neither stole the show. A great twist on an old world classic."
"This beer poured out as a golden yellow color, the head was white and left a decent lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer was typical, there were some grainy aromas along with some citrusy hop notes in there too. The taste of the beer had a good bitterness to it that left a sharp tingle in the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel was light and drinkable, good crisp carbonation with a dry finish. Overall it's not a bad pale ale, just not one I'd seek out again."
""
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with a big rocky white head. In the aroma, tart and lemon citrus with a small yeast presence too. In the taste, dry yeast and lemon like tartness. A small bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry lemon citrus in the aftertaste. A small tartness and lemon citrus, quite refreshing and I can dig it!"
"Overall: This was a very enjoyable brew. Typical to Belgian Pale Ales, this is a fruity, malty, somewhat spicy ale. Very easy to drink. This is my first time trying a beer from The Lost Abbey and I will probably be picking up one of their other styles at some point."
"This beer grew on me after a while. I’d give it another try. If I had to sum this up in two words, it would be orange peels."
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Very drinkable and a great belgian ale. Would definitely buy again, especially during the summertime."

"I'm loving Devotion, very complex for such a simple beer. With each sip you'll pick up new flavors and aromas that you didn't get in the last. I wish I had another 750."
"Medium body; excellent carbonation. Very smooth."
"O - Very easy drinking pale ale, characteristically Belgian."
"A little thicker consistency in the mouthfeel than I expected, but still very drinkable. Another solid brew from Lost Abbey."
"Overall: A refreshing and highly drinkable hoppy Belgian Pale Ale."
"O - I really enjoyed this one. Its my first from The Lost Abbey and I look forward for more. Its great to buy and share with the friends, especially those who'll say, ""Beers come with corks?"" Overall its a wonderful Pale Ale in general, I'd drink this just as much as an American Pale Ale. Be sure to pour this slowly as the head gets a little out of control. Stay thirsty my friends!"
" M – Fantastic smoothness on a medium bodied frame. The carbonation is a shade low for the style."
"Pours a pretty clear golden amber with a thick and fluffy off-white head. Malty aroma has a subtle fruity undertone and a hint of butterscotch. Flavor is malty and a little fruity, with a subtle note of butterscotch and a hoppy undertone. Texture is full-bodied, edgy and a little tingly, and aftertaste has malt, hops and just a teeny bit of tinniness. Devotion indeed!"
"Update: tasted 01/02/2011 also on tap. Has a Saison character but deteriorated into a bitter swamp. Harsh and unforgiving. Thin body and sharper as you taste. I was too generous the first rating."
"O: awesome beer! I love how different the spices make it from just about any beer I've had."
"Pours a dark straw color with a thick 2-3 finger, bright white head. It took a good while for the head to crawl back into the body of the beer. Leaves a decent along the sides of the glass. Smells of Belgian Yeast, a mild form of hops, and scent of fresh bananas. Taste is spot on for a good Belgian Pale Ale. Enjoy the clove, banana, and small hint of hops. Also catch a lot of the yeasty flavor. Mouthful works and and is an easy drinker. Overall a good Belgian Pale, not one of my top beers, but would drink again if the opportunity presented itself."
"Pours a murky golden orange color with a large white head that diminishes eventually. Scent is Belgian yeast with hints of citrus and clove. The scent seems to be like I'm about to dive into a well-balanced Belgian-style pale. Scent is not too misleading...Although not as well-balanced as I was assuming, the flavors are spot on with the aroma. Lovely citrus notes met with hoppy esters and Belgian yeast. Hints of clove, green apple, and banana cling to the palate along with a bit of bubblegum. Mouthfeel is light bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is high. Overall, I feel this is a solid example for this style. It is not one of my favorites from this brewery or for the style, but it is definitely something I would drink again."
"O: Very good Belgian blonde/pale ale."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass. Pours a lovely copper-tinged golden color with ample, white, lacey head. Aroma is floral, grapefruit and orange rinds, with just a touch of mild spice. Initial taste is surprisingly good considering the aroma, all light hops and malt, with a touch of old penny flavor. Good mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Overall, a pretty good effort."
"O: Just not a pleasing beer at all. The taste is all over the place."
"O - Not bad. A bit spicy for my liking, but was crisp and refreshing after a round of golf."
"Fuller medium body, slightly higher carbonation, a little creamy, pretty smooth on the tongue. Nice drinkable BPA, good flavor and refreshing on the senses, a little light on aroma though."
"O-this is a fantastic mix between a sour and belgian pale ale...leaning slightly more towards the belgian pale. this is a unique drink that i really appreciate. it goes down quite easily and i'm amazed by the fair price."
"Overall very pleasant for warm weather days. Well crafted, but not overly extraordinary."
"Overall- A nice summer beer. Its not to much of anything and seems well balanced. Nothing to crazy here. I think there are other brews out there to satisfy me if I would like this one again but at a cheaper price point"
"O: I really enjoyed this offering from Lost Abbey. If the price wasn't so steep I would stock up on this beer for the summer. It is light and refreshing with just enough going on to keep you interested. Cheers."
"Overall a very drinkable offering."
"Drink: Lots of carbonation, very light body. I liked it, and so did the wife. That is rare in our household."
"This brew pours a beautiful deep golden hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head that stays and leaves heaps of clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is belgian bready yeast,honey and pungent floral hops,it has a medium bodied averagely carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of bananna,belgian bready yeast,honeydew and is rounded out with a pungent floral hop finish that is quite dry and sweet and has no bitterness to it at all and for that factor its quite an easy drinking brew thats quite sessionable."
"O - A nice stab at a Belgian beer, but still lacks authenticity"
"Devotion ale in the glass looks pale like a Belgian ale, bright yellow with some lighter shades on the sides, nice amount of suds, semi stick. The nose is really spicy with a certain yeast strain and it is piled on with earthy aroma hops. a tight biscuit type malt as well. I get alot of spice with some small traces of tropic fruit, reminds me of a bigger version of Redemption. Pear and apple with some malt breads and a spicy finish. Feel is less tan medium with an OK drinkability. Carb is no problem since it's on tap, never a problem in that arena off the tap. I liked this but it fell a bit short for me."
"Overall: A quite enjoyable beer. Easy drinking and good tasting. Smell is what stood out here for me. I'm not usually a fan of blonde ales but this is a good one. Will buy again."
"Aftertaste is also very good. The flavor just bursts and vanishes. A very well done beer."
"this was my first Lost Abbey brew that I've poured from a bottle and to be honest, I was a little disappointed in this one. I'm sure these guys make something good, I just haven't found it yet."
"could use a tad more carbonation to make some flavors pop, for a corked and caged beer i was expecting alot more carbonation. still very good and worth trying."
"jd"
"NOTE: there was some confusion in the noisy bar as to what this beer actually was. It may have been Carnivale. Will check with bar and move review if incorrect."
"Maybe something was wrong with mine, as I had to use a corkscrew to remove the cork, and it looks like there were pieces of cork glued to the inside rim of the bottle. I did let mine warm up, but nothing really came through on this beer. I really love Lost Abbey, but I wont be getting this one again."
"D - Great balance of malt, yeast and hops making this very sessionable. Better on tap then in the bottle IMO."
"It drinks like: It's refreshing, it's thirst quenching and inoffensive. But for the style can I just have an Orval please?"
"Very nice and easy to drink."
"Very drink worthy."
"Overall this beer seemed rather one-dimensional for a Belgian of any style, although there was nothing about it that I found disagreeable. Not worth seeking out but not worth avoiding either."
"Overall a solid drinkable beer."
"This beer is quite drinkable with little presence of alcohol and a very refreshing spiciness. Great for warmer months and paired with fresh tomato bruschetta on crusty bread."
"Drinkability: fairly good, I wasn't crazy about this one but it isn't bad for the style."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer presents in a musky, golden color with no head. No strong or outfront smells to the beer, but some hints of malty notes. The beer has malty and fresh hop flavors, with a finish more similar to lagers. Oddly enough, the beer has a mouthfeel similar to a blonde; round and full in mouth. The lager-esque finish is very crisp, and while typical for a pale, it is very different following the robust mouthfeel."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"Overall: A pretty run of the mill BPA. Easy to drink with a nice hop presence but light on flavor and aroma. A nice summer BBQ beer."
"Not overly inviting to drink because of the taste."
"I'm not a huge fan of BPAs but this was very well balanced."
"D-I guess it is balanced but the hop presence is rather strong and I really like dry finishes on my belgian ales. the feel is a little messy and rough especially in the back mixing with all the biting bitterness."
"D: The drinkability was very good as I finished this bottle I was left wanting more."
"D: Good as a daily drinker but nothing outstanding."
"A very refreshing, dry and grassy Belgian that goes down very easy. Very fresh and very hoppy for the style."
"D: it drank pretty good but to tell you the truth the beer was more like a saison than a belgian pale ale IMO."
"Appears a pale hazy orange colored body with an off white head, which forms thick and fine bubbled. I was nervous after the decorking didn't leave me with much of a pop. Aroma hints of funky yeast notes, citrus herbal tones pale malt derivatives. A nice version of a BPA fruity undertones with funky yeast profile and hops equals perfection when done right. Flavor brings out a bit of band aid/horse blanket funkiness once the yeast is poured in, but more citric, herbal hops with spicy belgian yeast and pale malt sweetness equates to a good time. Mouthfeel is effervescent with carbonation medium bodied finish is a bit plastic/band aid just a touch but not enough to offend it actually works with the other flavors going on. Drinkability overall is effortless the 6% range is working for these bottle conditioned ales I wish more came in this packaging. I could finish this bottle off with myself without a problem, excellent American Belgian pale/blonde ale."
"D - A fairly average and unremarkable Belgian Pale Ale... However, that doesn't keep it from having solid drinkability... It's far from the cream of the crop for the style, but a solid offering none the less..."
"Overall a nice little surprise from Lost Abbey. After 600+ reviews, I really should know by now that you can't judge by other people's opinions. This beer is very good."
"Makes for a decent representative of the variety."
"D: Pretty easy to drink, decent flavors and relatively low alcohol, a little more carbonation would help things out a little bit here. Decent beer, but a little expensive for what you end up with. Not particularly impressed and I will pass on buying this again."
"tasty!"
"M & D - Soft and well carbonated. Delicious and very well crafted beer. Extremely drinkable."
"D- very nice bpa, and quite the enjoyable drink. Ill have to grab another bottle and toss some pairings at this soon."
"This is a very drinkable, well balanced beer. It is a great session beer as well as a great summer beer. Another outstanding beer by The Lost Abbey."
"D - A great example of the style - I found this to be pretty easy to drink without going overboard on the Belgian yeast phenolics allowing some hop flavor through"
"The Tettanger hops had a slightly sharp and interesting herbal flavor in addition to the spicy citrus background. There's a smooth grain and bread flavor with hint of subtle Belgian fruit esters. My only complaint is that the flavor can seem a touch muted at times. I suppose this is on the hoppy side of a Belgian pale ale, but it's still very drinkable. Check this beer out."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and easy to drink. The low alcohol content and good flavors make it a sessionable beer, particularly one well suited for the warmer months."
"D- Really interesting beer and a solid representation of the style."
"Refreshing, goes down easy and has a uniquely subtle finish to this very broad and, all too often, samey beer style. We could ourselves imagine sitting at an outside café, drinking this one with a plate of cheese and rustic bread."
"Drinkability: I like this beer a lot. It's not trying to be a light tripel, rather a fruitier and cleaner alternative. As much as I like the burst of phenols and yeast you find in many pale Belgian beers, this one is a different alternative."
"d - A pretty good pale ale. Would try again."
"Drinkability: Light body, crisp flavors aren't overpowering; moderate ABV of 6.25% = very easily and all day drink, especially in the warm summer months."
"The Lost Abbey Devotion Ale--2010 25.4 oz. Bottle. 6.20% ABV. 45 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) Belgian Ale--Saison--IPA. Rich dense lacy white head. Cloudy bright orange gold color. Dark sediment. Floral sweet fruit ester aromatic wild belgian hop front. Mild sweet complex refreshing clean mild hop resin Belgian fruit ester wild golden ale body. Clean hop citrus end. Saison IPA. Sampled 6/5/2010. 2 @ $9.99 Each."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a white head. The aroma is very fruity with peaches, oranges, lemons and apples. The flavor is apples and peaches with some spices and Belgian yeast. The beer doesn't taste as fruity as the smell indicates. The beer is pretty dry and as it warmed I got some oranges and mangoes in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Comments: This is my first from Lost Abbey. A good beer overall, but not exactly what I was expecting from this highly regarded craft brewery. As this beer warmed I enjoyed it more and began to see some of its subtle complexities."
"Overall- Good Belgium pale. Not what I expected from Lost Abbey. Not my favorite of their lineup. Drinkable but forgetable."
"Feel is moderate to full with the same citric flash on the finish. An easy drinking ale that would likely benefit from firmer carbonation to bring the yeast notes out a bit more. Drinks a bit like a spiced wheat ale as the yeast notes are largely non participatory."
"This is quite drinkable. It drinks lightly in mouthfeel and alcohol, but is also nicely spiced--like a good saison. It is not static, and keeps mixing up the taste sensations as one drinks, which is good in a beer. Well, however one wants to classify, it is drinking nicely and by now I have finished the bottle with no complaints."
"Tasted from 750mL bottle. Pours cloudy orange with a thick white head that quickly recedes to lace. Yeasty nose with orange peel and some clove and vanilla. Flavors on the palate are similar, but much more bitter. As expected, the carbonation is very high and the body is fairly light. Overall, this is a solid beer."
"d - Had this with a salad and a sandwich and it was perfect. Great for meals and I'm sure great to just sit and think about the drink."
"A thin cap of white head over orange hues. Aromas are mostly of citrus and grain. Very airy and refreshing on the nose. Flavors are very funky, with almost a bit of mustiness and farm. Lightly bitter orange zest topped off with a bit of spiciness. light body and heavy carbonation. Very easy to drink and indeed refreshing."
"this is my kind of beer. definitely drawing influence from a lot of my favorite classic beers (orval and popperings hommel to name a few), it pours murky, hazy, burnt-gold with a white head that holds well and leaves nice lace. only reason it doesn't get a five is because i have a 5 aversion and the head doesn't pillow/chunk up like some of the beers that spawned it's inspiration. nose is honey, a touch of biscuit/bread, grass, flower, apple, pear, lemon/lemongrass, caramel... it just does what it is supposed to and brings up images in my mind of a place that is a kind of ""heaven on earth", full of scents that i attach with awesome. taste is very well balanced mix of above with the perfect amounts of sour, bitter, sweet, mineral... great acidity. long finish that sits on the top of the palate and sings. goes down way too easy. bought a case yesterday for $90 (a good deal i thought) and i've already gone through a third of it without sharing. i'll get over my aversion for that and dole out a 5.0 for drinkability. highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Very good and complex brew. I like the caramel and fruit mix. At this abv I could have several. One of my favorites in the style and another winner from Lost Abbey."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light and has a smooth amount of carbonation."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly above average carbonation. Drinkability id good, I liked this beer more than I anticipated I would. I think the hop flavors really helped to give it some more character besides the Belgian yeast and spice."
"Pours a hazy golden-orange color, with a small to moderate white head. Some light hoppiness on the nose, along with yeast and spice. Flavors of light lemony citrus, pale malt and yeast. A good early summer afternoon refresher, nicely carbonated and dangerously drinkable."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours a clear dark gold with a creamy beige head. Aroma is peppery and grassy with some light bready malts. Pale malty with spicy accents and a little bit of a mineral quality to it. Low on esters though a touch of pear is present. Sort of an unassuming drinkable saison-like beer. Could use more complexity to be honest. Thinnish and quite drinkable."
"On tap at the Dive Bar, Worcester. Served in a tulip glass. Dark orange colored body. Not a lot of head, would have liked to have seen more. Smell was spicy like a nice Belgian ale should be. Loved the taste of this beer. Had that bready, yeasty, earthy flavor, almost like a nicely brewed tripel. Could also taste coriander and lemon zest. Mouthfeel was more like a pale ale, smooth and light. Would have guessed that the abv would have been slightly higher. Drinkability was very good, as it's a well brewed beer. Glad to see this on tap in the Worc area."
"D: This beer just seemed too heavily spiced for its own good. The base of the beer is overshadowed by these flavors."
"Solid offering from Lost Abbey. Give it a try."
"D: It gets more drinkable as you drink more of it. This beer is really starting to grow on me. On the other hand, I don't think I'd take it over any of my favorites."
"The beer is well carbonated but still has a bit of a silky mouthfeel, in hindsight it might be the peppery taste that gives a feeling of extra carbonation. Anyway the body matches the style to perfection, a very good achievement overall."
"Slainte"
"D: Fairly drinkable, though not a favorite"
"D- It's easy to drink and not bad overall by no means."
"Drinkability: Good. this is a unique and pretty hoppy take on the Belgian pale. the light mouthfeel and substantial bittering makes this easy to go through. I liked this one."
"D - aside from the carbonation issue, a very well crafted brew, though nothing out of this world."
"D: This is a nice complex Belgian style ale which I enjoyed. I would say the only real down fall was the intense carbonation, perhaps this was the intention of the brewer though"
"D - Very drinkable. I knocked out a 750mL with no issues whatsoever."
"This doesn't have the depth and bold flavors of many Lost Abbey offerings, but that doesn't make this an inferior beer in their line-up. I think it hits all the major profile notes of a Belgian Pale ale."
"Drinkability pretty high. This is a good Belgian golden ale overall."
"75cl bottle. Hazy gold with a thick white head. The aroma has lots of spicy hops augmented by spicy yeast phenols and some fruity esters that have some lemon, and vague banana and melon. The flavor is dry with some pale malt, spicy and bitter hops, and some yeasty fruitiness that mixes well with the fruitier, lemony side of the hops. Light bodied with smooth carbonation. Hoppy stuff for a Belgian blond ale, and the hops mix well with the yeast character, whith the bitterness never getting astringent or out of balance. As good as their special releases can be, these guys have a bangin' regular lineup for the most part."
"Overall I thought this beer was odd to me. The funky sour flavor is very weird to me and not all that welcomed. Not the best LA beer I have ever had."
"Overall - A decent enough Belgian pale ale although nothing groundbreaking... worth a try..."
"(D)- This beer had alot of promise. It is still decent, but really offputting due to the metallic minerality and grassy nuance that really conflicts and overpowers what would make this an otherwise great beer."
"75cl bottle. Pours clear gold with a small white head. Little lacing. Smells quite sweet and slightly yeasty. A bit of fruit and breadiness. Definite hop notes. The hops are more evident in the taste, lending some bitterness. Light fruit. Sweet overall, but with a drier finish. Medium body. Not much character, really, at least nothing that stands out."
"Wow. Never had a Lost Abbey that was less than good...until now. This is terrible. Looking at the other reviews I might have gotten a bad bottle. I hope so. Down the drain it goes."
"Good but not great..."
"Smells of light floral hop and candi sugar. Tastes of biscuity malt, sugar, and a sodden hop finish. Light and airy, this beer tastes like springtime."
"D-Tasty stuff with nice combination of fruit, spice and sweetness. Nothing over the top here but it all comes together to present a solid, easy to drink and flavourful ""light"" beer."
"Poured a nice light golden color with a huge white head, big carbonation, to much carbonation to be honest and it got annoying. Nose is spicy, belgian yest, hops. Taste is belgian yeast strain, spiciness, hops. Mouthfeel is a it warm, tingly, well done. Pretty good brew overall minus the obnoxious over carbonation issue."
"- Quite drinkable, and the carbonation was spot on... just not my favorite style."
"Fruity and sweet, yet crisp from the hops, this was a pleasant and easydrinking quaff (especially for the size)."
"The carbonation is dead on perfect, the finish is crisp and sweet. A really nice beer."
"D - Definitely one of my favorites from Lost Abbey. It's nothing crazy or over the top, but it's faily complex with a nice dry hopped character, which is why I think I enjoyed it so much. This is a beautiful beer in all of its subtle glory."
"D - The first sip of this brew, and I was excited. I picked up on peach and hop flavors, and it seem well-balanced. Then, it saw oxygen and warmer temperature, and (in my opinion) the flaws came to the fore. I wanted to like this beer because I like what Lost Abbey does, but this didn't do it for me. It feels a little rough around the edges."
"Excellent beer from Lost Abbey. Highly recommend."
"This is a solid beer, but didn't do a whole lot for me. Didn't get much IPAness. Of any variety. It was sort of like a wheat or pale or something. Certainly nothing to write home about."
"Pours a great golden yellow color with the head forming with a little work. Might of just been a bad bottle. Aroma was nice and mellow, carried with it a great floral aroma with a fruity backdrop. Taste was very nice as the hops came threw on more of a fruity/citrus combination for me. Flavor was well balanced but for some reason the brew just tasted a little dru for me...not sure why. Minor whine for a really good brew. Drinkability was great as this could be a brew to have during the hangout session. I have to say for Belgian Pale Ale this hit the spot. Will pick this brew up again. Thanks Lost Abbey!"
" Initial sweetness turns almost sour. Spice and pepper characteristics are obvious, but do not 'mesh' well with the rest of the flavors. Light honey taste is similar to mead. A little bland at times. Not a bad beer, just not what I expected (and there lies the problem, as I shouldn't have expectations for a beer I haven't tried)."
"A 750ml corked bottle shared with psycohops and brothercannon out on my patio. Poured into a trio of standard shaker glasses. The ale appears a hazed golden yellow color with about an inch of pillowy bone white foam. Nose and flavor consist of spicy peppery yeast, light citrus notes such as lemon and orange zest, mild caramel, grassy, earthy hops. This ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation for the style. Certainly worth your time if you dig a Belgian pale."
"The mouthfeel is dominated by the metallic/acidic finish and aftertaste of the beer. It is light and crisp, good body and style for the summer time, but the taste is lacking."
"Poured into my Duvel Tulip. Nice 3 finger head that dissolved nice and slow. Smell was very nice with citrus and wheat coming to the front. Taste was very good with a lemony crispness that makes this beers very easy to drink and mouthfeel was above average for a belgian pale ale. This was my first Lost Abbey brew and I look forward to trying more. I had no problems with under carbonation as many have talked about with Lost Abbey beers."
"Pours a hazy amber with a frothy beige head. Aroma is medium sweet with a good deal of yeast, light spice and orange. Flavor is yeast, orange peel, apple, grassy malt and light hay. Fairly dry and hoppy finish. Light to medium bodied. Overall a very drinkable beer but quite a bit different from the other offerings."
"Overall (once the head settled and a good pour was possible), the color was good, a nice gold and not quite clear though took care to keep sediment at the bottom. Smell was good, some light sweet notes, citrus, faint hop. Taste was similar, more citrus though typical pale ale style here. Mouthfeel was OK but took a bit to finally have a nice drink due to overcarbonation. This would be a nice drinkable beer but i'll need to test another as this bottle was just too overly carbonated."
"D - Very nice, will drink again."
"A nicely drinkable beer that I enjoyed."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Sam Adams pint glass (the new ones). Has a brillant glowing yellow with a solid 3-finger head, with swiss cheese lacing left behind. The nose is of citrus, earthy, spicey notes. The taste is on the dry side, with a little maltiness in the end that adds some sweetness. There is also the yeast/grassy notes that come through, almost like a saison. This was a great beer to drink on a hot day, a little on the dry side, but the lower ABV, makes it a great session beer, a little on the expensive side ($12) i think i paid for this one, still better than a bottle of white wine, looking forward to trying more from the lost abbey"
"Drinkability: A good example of a Belgian, with a definite American lean towards bitterness."
"Pours a cloudy golden head, a little flat looking, but still appealing. Citrus hops overwhelm the nose with a earthy, almost grassy backbone. The taste reminds me of a saison a bit for some reason. It is hop forward but there is that interesting melange of sweet orange and spice flavors that begins to take center stage as you drink a bit more. It has a light body and I really enjoyed this the further into the bottle I got. This is a solid beer worth picking up if you see it on the shelf but not worth seeking out."
"My first from The Lost Abbey a good impression; I will look for more from this brewery."
"D: Clearly this is a crap bottle, another in a series of bad ones from Lost Abbey. Fuck 'em. I have no desire to support their ongoing Fuck the Customer experiments. I will not buy LA beers again, especially at these elevated prices and downgraded quality standards. This is just appalling."
"Fantastic beer in one of my favorite styles - Abbey Single. In the mold of Westmalle Bier Extra. Light, refreshing hop note and a light, dry body make for one of the most supremely refreshing beers I can imagine, while still maintaining some of the signature yeasty, fruity notes characteristic of Belgian beers."
"Flavor is dominated by the odd orange peel and lemon bitterness. Yeasty funk really doesn't help. Not recommended."
"Very drinkable and solid Belgian Pale."
"Although I wasn't especially knocked out by the smell or taste, it was still pretty easy to finish the bottle. A refreshing beer, but not one I'd go out of my way to find again."
"Pours a slightly hazy sunset bronze hue with a quick two finger white head. A thin layer of stick holds on to the sides of the glass throughout making this a really nice looking Belgian ale. Smell consists of apples, honey, and yeast. A dash of pepper and some sweet pear in the nose as well. Hops play a very limited role in the aroma, but some earthy notes can be detected. Taste starts off pretty sweet with red apples, apricot, and white grapes. Midway the Belgian yeasts emerge with some spice and dry pepper. Aftertaste is fairly dry with some honey and lemon that linger on the tongue. Light to medium body with a prickly feel and a lively carbonation. Overall the sweetness is a bit much to handle, it's borderline cider. Not bad, but could use some balance. Looking forward to trying the brett version I received from Alex as well. Thank you sir!"
"Very easy to drink and enjoy."
"Feels light and good in the mouth, but it's a little too bubbly. Quite drinkable. My second Lost Abbey brew, and I've enjoyed them both."
"A good all-around pale ale. Some like it rustic, and if you do, grab a sample."
"Good, would have liked a bit more fruitiness throughout."
"D, notes: This is a very nice session beer. Mellow, nice balance, with a little kick provided by the bitterness."
"Very light in comparison to the smell. Incredibly thick, tart lemon, and smooth orange with a very grainy taste, and a slight amount of grapefruit on the finish. Slight hop kick in the center."
"D - It sure is a fun and drinkable ale. All-round well made."
"Pours a hazey orange and maybe a hint of rust. Very quick but nice head after the pour. Leaves only a thin ring of foam. Bitter orange peel and some chammomile and other good herbal toasted flavors. Herbal dry flavors, hints of lavender and some grains of paradise and orange peel. Plus some very faint, earthy hops. Bit of a talcey, toasty dry palate. Not enough yeastin the flavor given the amount of sediment in the bottle."
"D - This is a pretty good Belgian styled ale."
"D - Good, but a little overboard on the hops though."
"Drank pretty easy, the complexity doe slow me down a bit. One of the better Belgian PAs I've had in a while"
"Palate offers soft fruity flavors, gentle malt, earthy/grassy hop bitterness, and a suggestion of alcohol warmth."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"A golden straw ale topped with a massive fine bubbly white head that pours at least two finger breadths deep. The head settles to a rocky mass of foam. The beer is not a clear as the style should be. The scent is based on a toasty bread sweetness combined with a light pear aroma and whiff of mineral hop bitterness. The taste is well balanced and perfect for a session beer. Taste very similar to scent with the addition of a bit of spicy pepper to compliment the bread sweetness and pear flavors. The tasting ends with a mildly dry noble hop bitterness. Medium bodied, big time head retention, perfectly carbonated without being champagne-like. An amazing american version of a belgian standard."
"Bright gold pour with a big white head. Floral, spicy aroma with some yeast and bread/dough. Lighter tasting than expected. Oranges, crisp hops, honey,and a wheat-like tartness. Very dry. Felt like something was missing, possibily more coriander or lemon peel. It was still very nice."
"Drinkability- Maybe it was the cheese and drinking it with Mr. Arthur but I enjoyed this beer much more the first time I tried it. Now that's not saying I didn't enjoy it, I just didn't remember it being as bitter as it was (fairly bitter for the style). The yeast aspect is terrific and I love the dryness of this beer. Definitely a solid all-around beer though."
"D- This is a great, complex Belgian Pale Ale. It's really good and very drinkable. It has a moderate ABV so I wouldn't expect any noticeable alcohol and there is none. This one is somewhat heavy on the hop bitterness...but its so good. Really one of the best Belgian pales I have had. Can't wait to try other LA beers and I would definitely trade for this one again!"
"Damn good beer, keep em comin' Lost Abbey. Welcome to Chicago."
"D: Good. Lacks a little of the traditional Belgian ale yeast flavors that I really enjoy in a BPA, but this is a good showing."
"The body is a bit thin - almost lifeless. It's okay, I suppose, but lacks the effervescence that would make it more lively."
"Notes from 10/7/07"
"Drinkability was very good. Very light and clean finishing beer."
"D: The ale feels bigger than it is and the hops may completely dull the tastebuds after one bottle."
"Note: My bottle had what in tasting wine is called a 'corked' flavor. I don't know if this is a natural component of this beer or if it did indeed get a little corked."
"Overall impression: Interesting offering - highly drinkable."
"Overall, it was a decent beer but too dry and peppery to really enjoy. For me, it's one and done. Can't recommend."
"Mouthfeel is light as well, but a bit stinging and a little watery."
"D: Solid Belgian ale for sure. Not too complex, tolerable ABV to have a few."
"D: not my favorite from Lost Abbey, but a good brew for the style nonetheless. ABV is right on target. very nice and very drinkable."
"Lost Abbey, about Devotion: ""Yet, at the end of each day, there is a sense of satisfaction of reaping what you sow. The farmer swells with pride knowing his hops will find their way into beers from many differing nations"" ... this beer has certainly done the farmer proud."
"Mouthfeel is decently thick, could use a bit more carbonation, but overall a solid pale ale. Just a bit too expensive."
"Pours a very clear yellow with a lot of carbonation and a fizzy white head. Nose is of some grains and european hops. Alot of graininess and belgian yeast in the nose. A nice subtle hop flavor. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but ok. Drinkability is good, but nothing really incredible. An ok brew here, but probably not one I would buy again for that price. I am a big lost abbey fan, but this one didnt really do it for me. Worth a try. Give it a shot and see what you think!"
"I think I might like this a bit better on draught than I do out of the bottle and this years batch seems to be a bit better than last years. I like the spiciness that the mix of hops and fermentation character create in the aroma here. The flavor doesn't quite live up to the ultimate promise of the aroma, but it is still quite tasty. This is quite an enjoyable brew"
"D: Easily drinkable with plenty of flavor for the style. <3 LA"
"overall a great taste and enjoyable just lacking on the appearance and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - This is an incredibly good-drinking beer and I'd say actually that this is its strong suite. This ale is a bit quirky for sure and definitely not one to put in a style-driven taste test, but if you want an easy-drinking light Belgian ale this Port's for you."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with good steady carbonation. This one goes down easy and would be a nice drinker on a hot summer day. Quite refreshing, albeit on the mellow side flavor wise overall. Glad I sampled it."
"Drinkability is good. This is very nice Belgian Pale. I was a little dumb founded that she had to pay $15 for this. That is way too steep. Redemption from Russian River is just as good (probably a little better), and half the price. But even though this is pricey, it's also very tasty."
"Drinkability is fine, a bit too spicy for my taste, it leaves it a bit one-dimensional. This is the second Lost Abbey I've had, and I can't say I'm overly impressed considering their reputation."
"D: Nice light and refreshing even on the hottest summer night."
"Conclusion: Great brew and a good example of American and Belgian styles of ale. But for the price of admission I'd look elsewhere for this style of brew."
"Notes: The price on this pup would deter me a little from seeking it out consistently, but it's a nice treat and definitely worth a try."
"There's some fruitiness, some lightly sweet pale malt, with lemon-grassy hops. The mouthfeel doesn't jump out at me, and I imagine that a bottle-conditioned bomber would be an improvement there, but the carbonation is a hair flat. Otherwise, a strong offering, and a nice take on the Belgian style."
"This drinks clean and light-well made but not necessarily a standout."
"Drinkability: I'm with Watchnerd on this one. I like it and will happily finish the bottle. Given what else is out there, however (including other Lost Abbey beers), this wouldn't be my first choice. Still, at 6.25% you can at least make a straight-faced argument that it is a session beer - for a while."
"Drinkability is high on this one, and at only 6.25% it is not one that will leave you wishing it was a smaller bottle."
"D- pretty damn good"
"Don't drink and review."
"I know we're not supposed to comment on ""presentation", as it pertains to the bottle, artwork, etc...but c'mon, this thing is gorgeous to look at. Now, the beer. Pours a hazy, honey color, with a rocky white head, tons of lacing in the glass. Smells hoppy and spicy. I'm getting a ton of apple flavor out of this beer, with a crisp, dry finish. Really interesting taste, and definitely not like anything I drink regularly. I like it....don't see myself drinking a lot of this, but I'm glad I tried it, and would definitely like to try more from The Lost Abbey."
"Solid crisp pristin gold. Big poofy, fluffy white head of foam that leaves excellent lacing and has excellent legs and retention. Aromas of fresh baked bread, herbal metallic hops, zingey fruit zest. Taste is bready, nice biscuit hop malt. Hops are herbal, slightly metallic, and drying perfect for a berw of this style. A bit of fruit on the back palate (in the very back if you reach to the very very very back of your palate). Mouthfeel is great, zest, lively carbontion yet smooth and yeasty and perfect for the drying finish. A lot of flavor for a low abv style. One of my favorites really. Drinkability is exceptional, a great spring/summer sipper in the Belgian tradition. A great lunch brew teamed up with an artisan sandwitch as well. Really great stuff. Probably the best lost abbey year round beer."
"Overall, I'd say, for the high standard one should hold Lost Abbey to for its rarity and price, it's just 'okay'. I'd probably take a Fin Du Monde over this most days, and I can get that easily at the local super market."
"A good beer, not great. I love the whole line from this brewery! This one however is good...but probably the least favorate of the Lost Abbey line."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep clear golden color ale with a nice big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light brett with some Saaz hops. Taste is a mix between what appears to be light brett notes with some nice Belgian-type malt a dry noble hops finish. Medium body with some good carbonation. While I enjoyed that beer I have to admit that I will stick with DDC Dernière Volonté when I feel in need of an hoppy Belgian ale."
"Strange brew here. Not what I was expecting. No nose to speak of at first whiff, but it might be a tad cold. Poured piss clear into a large Piraat snifter. Taste was a bit shocking. I guess I was expecting more roundness and yeast. Pils and hops hit me hard. Hops galore here, with grapefruit pith and other bitter notes . Warming up now, much much better. sweetness coming through, with some nice spice and soft citrus. This is definitely an American interpretation of the the style, and I like it. I can't quite categorize it in my mind yet. I strongly urge anybody tasting this beer to temper it properly. The subtle notes that show off the brewers art cannot possibly be appreciated otherwise. I'm liking this beer more and more. I want my rating to be an A-, but I can't think of what to change. Oh well."
"Poured from bottle into delerium goblet. Nice hazy yelow / orange color. Good amout of cloudiness, can't even see through the beer. Nece 1"" cream colored head with tiny bubbles. Long -lasting. Slight fruity hop aroma, maybe some spice, too. Nice, clean flavor. Little bit of malt, but balanced after with a crisp hop bitterness that does not overwhelm. good consistency and mouthfeel that makes this a very good session beer. Seems like a really nice beer to have on a warm summer day. Refreshing. Even my wife liked it. ;)"
"Overall, very drinkable. I love bottle conditioning as it seems to make the mouthfeel turn creamy, almost smoothing out the ale. I'm intrigued in these ales and will have to try all of them now."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright golden color with a big stiff white head that fades slowing leaving wonderful lacing patterns. The smell is on the lighter side. Earthy Belgian yeast with a bright citrus fruit note. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated and creamy. Much lighter body than i anticipated. An easy drinker. The flavor is on the subtle side, but very good. The taste doesn't get much of a boost from the mouth. Light hoppy citrus flavor with a delicate sweet maltiness. In summary, understated with an interesting complexity. I could seriously drink this all afternoon; the ultimate compliment. Recommended."
"D: It is smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation, ABV and an interesting hoppy backside."
"Poured into a chalice a golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice small off-white head, basically no sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, hoppy, very slight yeast, and some spices. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, some malts, bitter, slight tang, and spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, not really impressed with this brew, so far it is the least favorable I've had from Lost Abbey."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer from Lost Abbey. I have been slowly working my way through their lineup and to be honest this is my favorite so far. It was so right up my alley that its not even funny. Such a great light profile and rich flavors, I am not sure how I could have not found this one earlier. This was just simply excellent and I really need to get more of it."
"Drinkability: Very light and subtle; a nice beer for the summer months"
"Mouthfeel - Light-bodied, slightly watery. Very active carbonation. Decent."
"The aroma was definitely the best part of this beer for me, and the appearance was pretty good as well. The taste was disappointing in that I have high expectation for Lost Abbey. I'll give this a pass and opt for the Red Barn instead."
"Pours a cloudy golden/amber, nice and hazed up, thin white head forms, leaves some nice lacing, solid ring. Smell is hay, spices, grass, honey and sugar, citrus, floral, wheat, very nice. Taste is wheat, spices, citrus kick through the middle, a little bit of tartness, lemony, floral, walnuts, spicy dry finish, light alcohol. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, very refreshing. Great beer, would be perfect for summer. Thanks Jay!"
"Pours a foggy golden brown with minimal head. Nose is earthy and almost like a raw sugar. Nice level of smooth funk there. Flavor is nice and consistent. Nothing showy or strange, but mature in its profile and completely even. Feel is smooth with a higher level of carbonation. This is a very good Belgian ale. If you have the chance to try it, I think you should."
"I enjoyed this, but to be honest, it wasn't what I was expecting. Maybe it would have been better to save it for another day."
"It did seem that the flavor got a bit better as the beer went along, but still pretty mild overall. A good get but nothing I'd go out of my way to find."
"This is a very nice, pleasant tasing, easy drinking beer. It's good, not great. I think I was hoping for more but I'm not upset."
"Originally reviewed June 20 2007. 750ml Bottle. Poured a hazed deeply hued gold, with a beautiful sheet of white lace cascading down the glass and floating like sea foam. Aroma was surprisingly subdued, even served at 55 degrees. Kept to some minimal peach and pale Asian fruit minglings. Flavor started as a lovely, soft bready malt flavor, backed with warm yeast notes and cacophony of quieted spices. Gentle and gliding. Crescendo into a furious clamor of syrupy hop flavor, that from the bottle has been heavily subdued. The taste from the tap was more of fresh, sticky hop cones, dripping with resin and a combination that propelled apparent European noble hops into court with the finest that Americas West Coast could show. However, here in bottle condition form the bombastic quality is more subdued into a calming amalgam of hop tea, sliding over the wheaty malt feel. Then, bad things happen. A distinct, harsh Styrofoam note cuts the hop loving short, with a thunderous clap. Infection? Yeast amok? Whatever, its incongruous and creates a biting acerbic quality that is alarming. Somehow, the beer recovers. The smacks sups long and pleasant as almond skins, warm toast and graham cracker caress the palate long after the fact. Further down the bottle, Lost Abbeys mineral yeast signature brighten up and give the beer a little break, with a long breath. Wonderful carbonation and delightful quaffable heft. Were it not for the disconcerting and marked Styrofoam, this would be a more heralded specimen."
"Cheers."
"The taste is complex. Lots of funk with peppery notes, a very pronounced hop bitterness, some malt sweetness in the background, and a tiny bit of sourness. It has a medium body and the carbonation is also medium. It finishes bitter and that dominates the aftertaste. This son of a gun, overall, is very bitter. Bitter in a way that say, La Folie is sour. It just dominates my taste buds and almost becomes one dimensional but I just can't help taking further sips. Good drinkability here? More than good.It kind of reminds me of De Ranke XXX only with more bitterness. It's like I'm drinking hop juice. I kid you not. Some may think this goes over the top and I *could* understand where they are coming from. For me, it's a hoppy delight though it should be consumed in moderation lest your taste buds be overwhelmed for a longer period of time than you wished. I favour it and recommend it. Only those adventurous need apply..."
"Highly drinkable. Seems pretty simple, but very, very good. Not much Belgian character, IMO, but I really didn't care based on the taste. Highly recommended, especially for warmer weather."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very refreshing. looking forward to trying more from these guys."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, lightly spiced, and semi-dry."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" white head above the bubbly, clear golden brew. Head maintains for quite some time, with spotty but resilient lace. Aroma is lightly of malts and spices, with the flavor replicating. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth, and drinkability is very easy. This one seems to be more saison than Belgian-style pale ale, but regardless, a crisp brew that makes me want tp keep finding my glass full."
"Finished the bomber myself at lunch, I was tempted by the relatively lower ABV. It was a good pale Belgian and unique."
"Very clear pour, color is pale orange and very clean, no haze at all. Aroma is light and floral with a touch of citrus. Flavor is a very smooth with a really clean aftertaste of green apple/honey/wheat/malt. Low in alcohol and very easy on the tongue."
"This bottle came straight from the brewery so it was pretty fresh. Nice golden color, hazy with a somewhat funky aroma. The taste was clean, a little funk, some tart fruity flavors also.The mouth-feel was smooth. I was glad my cousin popped this bottle because it wasn't on tap at the brewery."
"D- This is very drinkable in that it goes down easy but it isnt one i'd have more than once if there were other choices."
"Last swigs: Reminds me a tad of Orval without the funk. Quite impressive for an American Brewery to create such a spot on Belgian. Kudos to Lost ABeey!"
"D- Light and smooth belgian ale that is surprisingly hoppy for the style, but not for the SoCal location, like most all of Lost Abbey offerings, this is a very solid and worthy offering, I am a bigger fan of the stronger styles, but this is a nice hoppy Belgian offering that is not too overwhelming in terms of abv"
"Could drink a lot of this, and the one pint was definitely not enough"
"Pours a rich clear golden with slight orange tint, and an airy spider web-like head. At a fairly cold temp, earthy hops in smell, some pale malt breadiness. The taste has a lot of earthy hops, maybe a lot of that earthiness is from the 3 yeast blend. The taste also come across mineraly, though when it warms up substantially that mineral character goes away and you get a lot of sweetness with no bitterness. I liked this a little more from the tap at the brewery as that is probably a bit fresher, but this 3 month old bottle isn't too shabby at all."
"Minerally mouthfeel in a very good way. Thought provoking even at this ABV. Highly digestible. Balanced. Beautiful. I can only think of a couple American breweries that consistently impress me with their Belgian inspired brews (Russian River, Ommegang & Allagash) and Lost Abbey is certainly making a name for themselves in my book."
"Upon the swallow your mouth is left with the memory of the bitter grapefruit peel hops and a warming alcohol presence."
"Another excellent beer from Lost Abbey."
"Drinkability- Think this one should be labeled under the Belgian IPA category. A bit too much hops for me, but otherwise, drinkable and fairly interesting."
"I had a pretty good idea that Devotion would be good beer, I just didn't think it would be quite this good. It's still waaay too early to say for sure (let me drink the handful of Port offerings that are biding their time in my cellar first), but this brewery has a chance to be one of my favorite sources for Belgian-style beer in this country."
"There was a forceful pop when I pulled the cork, but no foaming. The beer was a hazy light amber colour with a full, off-white head of foam. Good retention and lots of fine bubbles clung to the glass. The aroma was mild overall, but more complex than I initially thought, particularly as it warmed. Hints of malty caramel and pears gave way to a pleasing vanilla aroma, lemony citrus, and earthy apple skins. Yeast character was very subdued, taking a backseat to the fruitiness. The flavour emphasized bready malt, along with a fresh grassy hop bitterness that rounded out the finish. Hints of fruit, lemon zest, and mild spice played in the background. Just the slightest bit of warmth followed the beer, which was just off-dry on the palate. Medium/light bodied, the texture was a mix of creaminess and lively carbonation. An excellent beer overall. Highly drinkable with complexities that were only apparent if you went looking for them. If you have an opportunity, definitely try it."
"Nice looking beer that poured golden with a huge fluffy white head that stuck around. Some clumpy lacing. The smell was less impressive- somewhat light. There was a light graininess with a touch of floral hops and the barest whiff of banana and orange. The beer is surprisingly tasteless. Somewhat similar to the smell, with floral hops and light graininess up front, followed by some light fruit. The flavors are a little brighter than the smell but lack an edge. Curiously bland. Mouthfeel is a little better, and the beer is smooth and relatively light bodied. It lacks a creaminess that would have been a nice touch. I'm not all that impressed with this beer, but I've liked the other Lost Abbey beers I've had."
"D: A great drinking beer, with a simple hoppy and herbal character, another great one from the Lost Abbey, very rustic, a great thirst quencher."
"Belgian bomber, caged and corked and w/o frashness or bottling info..Pours light hazy apricot, under an off white head, initially showing puffy retention then softening to a thin tiny bubble film, this one leaves nice tiny bubble webs of lacing. Tropical fruit nose, melons, honey, bananas. Another highly enjoyable Lost Abbey offering. More tropical fruits, white pepper, honey, yeasty spice, some light earthy mustyness and then a dry subtle hoppy finish. One of my seamingly many ""favorite styles"" and this one nails it. Bring on the salads, cheese, shell fish, crusty bread or just about whatever type of food you want and enjoy it with this high quality brew."
"(Only wish I could get anything this good around here...lucky San Marcosians!)"
"It is the 4th of July and even though it was a not so nice day outside I made it better by drinking this beer. Pours great with a nice head. Great golden color and awesome texture. Crisp and refreshing. Beer has many flavors and the mouth feel is great.Made my day much better."
"The beer is fine, but I can't say I was overly impressesd. It's qutie drinkable, and I guess could pass as a Belgium Pale Ale. A decent beer, but just not all that great when compared to some of the other offerings I sampled from Port Brewing."
"Not a lot of hubbub going on in this brew, I was hoping for more hops, alcohol, and funk. The bitterness lingers almost to the point of being a detraction without more hop flavor or funk to back it up."
"Drinkability: I find this one to be fairly refreshing, myself."
"Overall: I would like this beer more if it didnt have that off flavor. I have had it before, and I know that it is not just from a bad bottle. It reminds me of some of my homebrews that didnt got possibly slightly contaminated."
"Opening smell is light, spicy, and a bit of yeast in the nose. Good but not spectacular. Something a bit sour or off with it, which shows up in the taste. Malty beer with a winey, oily Belgian feel, a bit heavy, and full of spice from the hop but out of balance for me. The two didn't match very well for me, even a bit grassy or overwhelming in the hop. On the back that ""Rumor is that some of the monks love hops"" hints at a hoppy version of the Belgian single but this doesn't work for me. Good beer, well made, just missed the mark a bit."
"This is certainly pleasurable to drink to my tongue this is a nice ESB in a big Belgian Ale bottle."
"Notes: A beer on its own island. This doesn't reflect the norm of belgian pale and it teeters on becoming lagerish in smell and taste. Spices pull it together. Just ok for me."
"definietly a belgian ipa worth getting. i also wish i could get my hands on more. there was a 1 bottle limit when i made my purchase ... arg!"
"Highly recommended. Another good brew from Lost Abbey."
"D: Highly sessionable beer. Very nice with good balance. Would go well with Chinese food, I think."
"D- I think this is a very tasty brew. I wish I would of got more than 2 of this. I think it should be under Belgian IPA and not Belgian Pale."
"Notes: I was told this was a brew that was ""specially"" brewed for the Monk's Cafe back East. Also, it's being dry-hopped right now and won't be available in bottles until mid-May."
