"Simply amazing beer! Well done."
""
"3/26/15 (Bottle) - Very nice dark amber pour, solid carbonation and nice thick tan foam head. Aromas included citrus, raspberries, yeast and hops. Excellent taste matched the sweet aromas and included a nice dry finish. Smooth, strong and pleasant going down. Over all excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Heavy carbonation and the sour peppery flavors make this a craveable Trappist ale. At around $5, this beer is worth every penny."
""
""
"Although I had a (wrong) preconception that this is another fine classic Belgian ale, the funk this beer gives made it one of my favourite Belgians, and beyond that style."

"Not bad heavy carbonation like a volcano musty smell light citrus bread taste"
""
"Just not my cup of tea.."
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely carbonated and does a hell of an Old Faithful impression. I'm glad its on the lighter side and wont stain. Its got a strong tart flavor that mellows out later but its followed by a nice lingering, orange and bitter citrus finish. I'm not the biggest belgian fan out there but its worth the money."
""
""
"Very tart, musty nose followed by a grassy dry flavor with spikes of bitter citrus.  Finishes clean. Heavy on the yeast but brings a lot of flavors to the mix."

"Outstanding! Lighter than expected! Definitely a good one!"
"I like this beer and look forward to my next drink."

"Overall- Honestly didn't know what to expect with this and definitely didn't anticipate the Brett aspect.  Funky barnyard beers usually aren't up my alley, but this strikes a good balance with some funk upfront but fading to citrus and caramel combine for a crisp finish.  Good beer in my book and worth trying again, but this would probably be more enjoyed by those who like Brett influenced beers."

"Extremely pleasant beer with amazing evolution in tastes throughout..."

"Wasn't up my alley. Not Horrible though."
"Beer was ok, but the price was a little high."

"classic.  friggin awesome.  i know that this review doesn't describe my experience of the beer, but this is a great trappist ale.  it's a solid beer."
"Top beer. Like a cherry in the sky."

"Mouthfeel is interesting, somewhat light and efervescent."
""
""
"Orval pours brilliant copper to orange tinted amber under a moussey, finely bubbled 2” bone-white foam cap.  It has a funky, wet horse blanket lemony nose with a hint of mustiness. It drinks tart, lemony with a hint of pineapple especially as it ages with a refreshing bitterness and a long lingering tart dry finish with soft leather notes. The texture is soft and effervescent, like drinking a mousse. This is excellent fresh and even better as it ages."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice Belgium pale ale. Had out of bottle"
"overall - the flavor was not what i expected. however, the craftsmanship of this beer is admirable. i might have to age one and try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
" Unfortunately, the flavor profile isn't as impressive as the appearance or the aroma.  It is intense, lacks complexity, and is poorly balanced.  From the onset, phenols dominate and little else comes forward.  In the middle, a bit of biscuit sweetness is underneath, but you really have to ""look"" for it.  The finish is dry."
"first trappist. very good all around"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer.  Unique, and in a good way.  This one was bottled about 10 months ago, and can be cellared up to 5 years.  Would like to see how it changes over time.  Nice complexity of sweet, sour, bitter, citrus.  Very good depth of flavors here.  Great beer."

"Dark yellow-orange with a big foamy white head. Excellent smell of bubblegum! Tasted like candy with a mild bitter flavor.   Very bubbly body.  Not crazy about this one."
"Distinctive 11.2 oz bottle served in my new Libbey Belgian ale glass.  Bottled on 15/05/2014, best before 15/05/2019.  Peer pours mid amber in color, very hazy, with an enormous white pillowy head.  Aroma is classic Belgian golden ale, suggesting the distinctive yeasty note and caramelized sugar.  But this beer is both more dry and more tart than others in its category (BPA).  It has a really crisp, thin mouthfeel.  Surprising for a beer as high OG as this. The bottle conditioning has left this beer highly carbonated, which works well with the subtle tartness.  It's almost like a mild Gose, or even dry cider.  This beer is unique, distinctive, and impeccably balanced.  It reveals none of its alcohol (note: my label claims 6.9%, although that figure may assume a large amount of fermentation happening in the bottle), and doesn't tire the palate at all.  However being so neutral I do find it a little bland for my taste."
"2 year aged, a lot of Horse blanket in the smell.  Very dry, smooth and tasty.  Going to buy a few more to age longer."
""
"Farmhouse funk and wet dog pervade the nose and initial taste here. This is edging towards the sour end of the spectrum. The initial bottle pour unloads a vast foamy head that settles into a slightly cloudy, amber looking toned ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a peculiar one, though I can't say I dislike it. It's certainly interesting—crisp, flavorful, tart, somewhat fruity and sweet. The Brett though just makes me think of latex; and while it adds a unique dimension to the beer, it's taking some getting used to."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : ""Perfectly drinkable"" for trying a different taste, but too spicy for me. Looks can sometime be deceiving..."
""
"Not impressed after all the hype."

"Medium, not as heavy as say a tripel."
""
""
""
"Hazy appearance switch a huge lingering head. Tastes of hay and bubblegum. Very good cannot wait to drink again"
""
"O: Deserving of more samplings. This is my third tasting of it, and I can't quite nail what's going on exactly, possibly due to the widely ranging freshness of my bottles. Definitely a good quality brew, but I think the coolest aspect of it is bound to be the history, not the taste. Maybe it is my privileged 21st century palate or my over-worked/dulled 21st century palate, but as good as this beer is, I think the best in the world were first concocted within the past century."

"Poured into an Orval chalice. Foams out of the bottle a bit on opening. Pours a hazy coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and lots of pillowy lacing. Aroma of citrus, green apple, Bretty yeast, vanilla; floral. Flavor is semi-dry, light apple family fruit, light stone fruit, mild citrus, vanilla, Brett style wild yeast funk, Finishes with fleeting fruit and fruit dessert flavors dominated by the wild yeast funk and bitterness; lightly tart and earthy. Medium bodied with sharp, peppery carbonation. A very distinctive Belgian pale ale with a unique wild yeast component. I did not like this when I first tried it many years ago, but now having grown to enjoy saison yeasts and a light touch of wild yeast, I can see its appeal. Although the flavor is dominated by the funky yeast, there are a lot of interesting light and subtle fruit and spice flavors in the background. A bit too dry and funky to be a frequent choice, it was a pleasure drinking this again and understanding why it is a classic."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark orange color with a huge three finger off white foamy head.  There is quite a bit of carbonation and a good amount of lacing.  The odor is powerful, spices, cardamom, coriander, bread like, fruity, apple, pear, citrus, lemon, and malty.  The taste is crisp, spices, clove, coriander, pine, a little bit of apple, grassy, bread like, yeasty.  There is some bitterness on the end."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite beers of all time. When you poor the beer into it's glass it's an orange-esque hue, yet it's first tastes are one of a darker beer, but as you exhale you can taste the  hops. Man. Its one of those beers you have to try in your life time. love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Just don't get this one, and I get a lot of things.  Will wait another 35 years before trying again- or maybe not.  If I was on a beach, on a hot summer day and this choice was warm Orval or warm Bud- I would take the Orval, but under no other circumstances."

"I don't know why, despite being into craft beer for over 14 years, I never tried Orval.  I am so glad I finally got around to it.  Doesn't dethrone Duvel as my favorite Belgian pale ale, but it is a worthy brew in any estimation."
"Tastes bitter, has a refreshing touch, yeast, with a sweeter finish. Carbonation is pretty high, but not too present. Has a warm pleasant finish, gets into balance in the end (less bitterness). Smells much sweeter than it actually tastes. Bitterness is very present at the beginning, sweet yeast and spices add complexity which results in a very adorable mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is based on a 5 month old bottle, but try it aged by a few years for an even more unique Orval experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this one on a whim, and ended up loving it. Unlike almost any ale I've had. Smooth, flavorful, well balanced, not too heavy but substantial all the same. I do recommend, as the Brothers do, that you cellar this one for at least a couple weeks before opening. Enjoy chilled and in a frosty glass."

"Huge foamy pour nets 5 fingers of fluffy white head.  Head falls slowly to a skimcoat without leaving any lacing.  A rusty golden hue is slightly cloudy.  The aroma is distinctive with sour apple, medicinal, spicy Belgian funk, fruity, and some lemony notes.  The taste follows with the Belgian funk and medicinal, fruit, bandaid, also tart then ending with a surprising bitterness.  Not sure if it's from lots of hops though.  Maybe the yeast? Very unique taste.  Effervescent, crisp, light and refreshing.  I was surprised by the drinkability.  This went down the gullet quickly.  I tried this beer in the 1980's and poured it.  I liked Chimay but thought the Orval went bad.  Nowadays I fully appreciate unique Belgian flavors.  This reminds me of Rayon Vert which is good!"

"O – This is a very fresh, bright, spritzy, spring time in the hills type beer.  I really love the aromas, but the rest is not at the same level. A true Trappist beer, so it meets expectations and is very well crafted, but I don’t think it’s the best of that group.  Still a fantastic beer.  It’s all relative."

"11.2 oz. bottle from Bottleworks poured into an Orval chalice.  Solid amount of head, thick, which lasts a long time.   Golden hue, slightly cloudy.  Fruity aroma, some leather and mustiness from the Brett yeast.  Spice, apple and a little citrus.  Hits with tartness and some sweet in the front, with some hops bitterness, then finishes with sweet malt still with a little bitterness.  Light to medium on the tongue, medium carbonation, finishes fairly medium and fairly dry.   I am going to try cellaring a couple of these bottles for a few years and see what changes."

"O – This is very good ale for its type and will be a winner with those who like Belgian Pale ales. I must confess to not being a massive fan of this one myself but it is doing what it set out to do and it is doing it well therefore I have to give it a mark to reflect that."

"Banana on the nose and then malty goodness. The only thing about this beer I did not like was the massive head foam I got from the bottle like Triple Karmelliet. Otherwise, a great beer all the way around."
""
""
"Poured from bottle. Aroma of citrus with a hint of herbs. Appearance is cloudy amber with significant white head. Light bitter taste. Medium to light body, with a texture that is hard to pin down, and a dry finish. A very complex beer."

"Pours a hazy orange. The head is intense. Previous reviews of a stout head is understated. Tried to control the pour to limit head but to no avail. 4/5s of the glass was full of a thick, slow eroding head. The nose was of orange and lemon candy. Smelled delicious. Btw, the head still remains with impressive lacing on the glass. The taste was not what I was expecting. Not sure how to describe it. Malty and boozy. The finish was super dry, like a bourbon. Very good. Only wish I had another one."

"How do you rate a beer in a style you don't care for? This is very well made, very balanced, not funky or offensive. The head is massive and sticks to the glass impressively. It's cloudy, medium amber in color. Nutmeg and wet earth on the nose with a yeasty bread behind it. The taste has more nutmeg, some cinnamon and a light overripe fruit taste. Finishes rather dry, not at all sweet. Medium bodied with strong carbonation. A great example of a style I don't love."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a perfect classic."
""
""

"Overall: I purchased this Trappist Ale expecting to be impressed and I was. I would love to try this one a little closure to its origin. Two of these and I could see myself considering the monastic life…."

"15 or twenty minutes in, I find myself enjoying it, though I would like that hint of sweetness, which I find adds a different measure of complexity, as opposed to the sour, yawning complexity of this unusual, different animal."

"O- not really anything great about this beer. It's a bit of a disappointment with the Brett coming more as stale basement funk than anything exciting and interesting.  Between light oxidation, faded hops and the yeast derived flavors the overwhelming characteristic is ""stale""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours beautiful golden brown, pillowy 3 fingers of head that is persistent and leaves a spotty lace on the drink down. Nose is not overly assertive, bready notes, Belgian yeast prevalent. My first thought was that it was pretty boozy for a 6.9% beer, but I think the extremely dry finish contributed to that. Really clean taste, but not a lot of flavor if that makes sense. Bitterness throughout the drink makes it enjoyable. After it warmed a few degrees I'm starting to think that I wish this wasn't so expensive because it could be session material. Easy to drink, lots of carbonation, good summer front porcher."

"A good beer for the purist, very simple flavor and enjoyable. I may try again from a different source as my experience is clearly not in line with many others. Though very good, I fail to see this beer as being anything tremendously special."
"O: Great beer, very unique and interesting"
"Over carbonated. I took the cap off and heard a noisy champagne-like blop. The head is a big all-over-the-place cloud. Smells like a cigar butt that has been floating in a beer. It has other strong flowery aroma but not a good one. Flavor is very bitter with a really dry aftertaste. I got my first review straight from a Belgian store shipped from Belgium. I got my 2nd one from a local liquor store in Miami. The bottle is awesome but there is something wrong with this beer."
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 I wasn’t sure I liked this beer very much at first, but I came to really enjoy the funk and dryness. It is very well balanced with a very unique and enjoyable character."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice, crisp, clear copper in color with a massive, billowy, cloudy head that will not die and eventually leaves some nice lacing. The nose starts with some sweet malt, orange peel, tart lemon and musty yeast. On the palate, the beer opens up further and is much drier than the nose with lemon peel, and a slight tart funkiness to round it all out. The taste finishes with a pleasant floral hop bitterness. Orval is medium body with plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is a unique beer, very subtle and nuanced and stands apart from many/most of the other Trappists."

"Pours a cloudy amber with a root beer float head that lasts for days. Tons of carbonation. Nice aroma of fruit, hay and a touch of funk. Tastes of grapes, apples and yeast. The brett adds a lot. Medium light mouth with some crispness. Just a very flavorful and well-balanced beer."

""
""
"Oh dear - not a very enjoyable glassful. I guess this hasn't aged well or I've kept it for too long (probably both). Looks great, and the aroma is pleasantly complex with hints of brett and fruity notes. However, the flavour is deeply unpleasant - very harsh and dry with little of what you'd expect from a good beer. Body is also subpar; fizzy and too thin. A great pity, as I've really enjoyed Orval when I've had it before and was looking forward to a top notch brew. Most likely it's just too old. I'll try and re-review a fresher version when I get the chance. Oh well...."
""
"Pours a nice golden amber with a fabulous head. The smell is fantastic. At first, it smells like bubblegum. Fruity, fragrant, wonderful! Slight champagne smell. Tastes very good with a nice bitter finish. Not your typical beer and definitely not your typical Belgium beer. Great!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This beer is always an experience, because I swear it’s different every time I drink it. And, every time it’s delicious. Some common currents between all experiences: lightly tart fruitiness, vinous character, minerality, hay and must, clean phenolic funk, and light spice. Occasionally it’s surprisingly hoppy, occasionally the musty character is very pronounced, occasionally the spice and phenols are greater, occasionally the tartness is much greater, and occasionally the head is absolutely out of control. But every time—including this time—it’s delicious. It’s easy to scoff at the price for a single, but given the quality of the beer it’s always worth buying, at least every once in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-First time having this beer quite the standard for Belgium pale ale."
""
""
"Pours a murky brown color with a booming 3 finger white head. The smell is a light earthy aroma with an authentic Belgian spice. My first sip of this started with a fantastic tart and spiciness upfront hat literally explodes on the tongue with the fantastic carbonation. There are some funky notes in there also but every note plays off each other so well it leaves me wanting another sip. Halfway through the head is still a good cm and resembles construction foam, the taste becomes increasingly spicy and funky. Notes of fresh grass, lemon, and spicy banana. What an incredible beer, I get it now."

"[EDIT] With the hype about this beer from truly knowledgeable folks in the beer industry, I could not believe that I had such a bad experience to cause the review above.  I stand by that review and now attribute it to a bad or very old bottle.  Due to my disbelief, I decided to give it another try.  This time the bottle was labelled differently, with a manufactured date (almost two years old) and a best by date (almost two years in the future).  That puts this bottle right in the sweet spot.  This time I was thoroughly impressed with the beer and I see why it is so highly regarded.  My numbers are readjusted to reflect the second tasting."

"First sip is an eye opener. Sharp, concentrated flavor with a dry finish that goes for a victory lap on the palate. Lots of yeasty esters and an effervescence that coats your mouth. There’s some slight sour and funky notes that hang around and become more pronounced as the beer warms. Incredibly complex. I see why this beer has such a reputation and aura around it."

"Forceful carbonation almost popped the cap off when I went to open it. It pours murky orange with a huge four-finger head of white foam and there's still carbonation streaming up the glass. The nose is bready, tangy, and full of brett yeast, bringing barnyard funk and a woodsy characteristic. It smells unlike any other Trappist ale I know of, coming across like a high-quality sour. In past tastings I got a lot of spice from the yeast, but I get none of that here. There's a slight sourness and a seriously oaky, earthy quality with more of that barnyard flavor. It finishes dry and vinous, like a white wine. The body on it is pretty light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is fantastic aged, but I was bit impressed with it fresh... I honestly had written it off as a standard Belgian ale.. Don't make the same mistake."
"Overall - Terrific brew, a real masterpiece. This certainly earns its ranking as the yardstick by which all Trappist Ales are measured. Brett bottle conditioning, an excellent idea."

"No wonder i rated this 5 at first, it's absolutely amazing. Minus the bit of extra carbonation, but still up to its renown."

"Pours an orange amber with an inch of perfectly even bubbled light tan head. Good lacing, head has staying power, thick collar at the edges. Aroma is of aged hops, earthy funk, citrus, and some dark cherry. Very effervescent and bubbly on the tongue. High carbonation, light to medium body. Fun to drink. Taste is grassy and earthy in a dry funky kind of way, with some floral and earthy hops."

"O: this is my third time having Orval and I have yet to truly enjoy it to the level that I have other trappist beers. That isn't to say it is bad, far from it, but rather it is so different from what one might expect from a trappist beer. This bottle had a year of age on it, I would like to wait and try the next in another year."

"DATE TASTED: February 21, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay 125th Anniversary chalice... OCCASION: prepping for Will's 7th birthday party... APPEARANCE: dark cumulonimbus, Everest-like white climbing head--three-fingers edge out of the glass; medium amber body; hazy lacing continues throughout the drinking experience... AROMA: bright, sugary yeast wafts with slightly pungent, earthy grass and raison; grapefruit and pear are present...PALATE: light to medium-bodied; easily drinkable and lengthy aftertaste--one that is desirable...TASTE: sweet candied sweet hops pucker the mouth; pear and apple make for a perfumed blend, supported by a surprisingly hearty malt base--balanced and pleasing... OVERALL: alcohol adequately masked,, this Trappist deftly hits the bliss point---malty/hoppy/yeasty/fruity in equal turns; only regret is waiting nearly a decade to revisit and review the ""pearl in the fish"" labeled brew..."

"A classic, the sour flavours differentiate this from other Belgian pale ales. Well worth seeking out."
""
"O) obviously a legendary Belgian beer. Unless you dislike the bitterness for some reason, you will most likely enjoy this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm going to assume this isn't normal. The beer tasted wrong from the start, and too metallic and carbonated."
""
""
""
"Pedestrian in my opinion. It doesn't really have the Belgian characteristics like malt that I'm used to. I think I'll stick to Dark's and Quad's. Maybe it's the low ABV but this one was lacking to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Interesting trappist ale that showcases the effects of Brettanomyces quite well. Dry, a bit funky and bready. Nice one to sip on both a cold winter night or a warm summer evening."
"Belgian fans must."
""
""
"O: A nice beer although I like Chimay or Westmalle better."
""
""
""
"A deep golden ale that leaves a big bubbly head that fades after a minute or two. No lacing. Smell is earthy and funky. Tastes of pepper and blue cheese. It's dry and bitter like citrus rind with a bit of brett funkiness. Light, effervescent mouthfeel. Overall very nice."
""
""
""
"I enjoy Belgian ales, but I was very disappointed with Orval. It was overly carbonated. I was only able to get about 3 oz of beer in a 16 oz tulip glass, due to the heavy foam. Once I was able to try the Orval, I found it to have a very unusual industrial aroma. I did not finish the beer. The 'brewed on' date indicated that this bottle was nearly 13 months old, so it is possible it had turned."
"Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- unique. No other Belgian tastes like this. It's a sipper for a 6.9ABV. Warming brings out different aroma/taste qualities."

"Sinto dificuldade em analisar esse rótulo, por se tratar de algo único e de difícil comparação. A Orval é a cerveja mais original do universo trapista belga, ela é única e joga com suas próprias regras. O que posso dizer é que senti falta de complexidade e seu amargor intenso pode ter sido mal interpretado por mim. Espero revisitá-la um dia para rever minhas conclusões."

"this is a great example of the style, made unique by the brettanomyces"
""
""
"A dark honey body, almost like a light apple cider. Very voluminous head, long retention and mountainous foam on top. Good funk in aroma with classic Belgian influences including cloves, strawberry (thank you Brett!) and pineapple (?). Flavor is again a nice mix of Brett and traditional Belgian flavors. Spicy cloves, herbal bitterness (not too much). IMO, this is a notch above most Belgian ales and sets itself apart."

"Hazy dark orange with a massive head that won't go away before you finish drinking it--beautiful. Aroma is sour apples, barnyard, sour funk, noble hops. Velvety, spicy, and bubbly in the mouth. Carbonation really enhances the diverse flavors. Spicy, fruity hop bitterness. Tart and funky. Fruity and spicy (hints of black pepper). Orange and lemon. I could keep rambling but... a zillion contrasting flavors balanced perfectly. Perfect--yep, that's the word I'm looking for. Perfect."

""

"O-great malty flavor that starts this beer off right. It has good balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall as Michael Jackson has said this is a great aperitif. It is light and very easy drinking with a crisp and refreshing character. Interesting to see how this has developed."
"Overall: A tough one. I do like the progressive complexity, the not too in-your-face brett character with sour notes, but the carbonation is silly and gets in the way. Still a massive beer, definitely a must try - some old-school shit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: this is a very good beer but Duvel Belgian Pale Ale sets the standard. For the price I will probably not buy this beer again as there are better, more affordable options available to me."
""
""
"o: A fine Belgian with restrained fruity yeast flavor. Extremely easy drinking and enjoyable. However unless and until the price comes way down from $6 to $2-3, I probably will not be repurchasing. Too many American versions which are nearly as good, if not a little better."
""
""

"Overall: An absolute classic and truly unique experience. I always look forward to this beer, and it has yet to disappoint. This beer to me is greater than the sum of its parts. I would love to try this when it is super fresh someday."

""

"O- There are lots of subtleties in this beer. Nothing is over the top, but there is so much depth. Really a wonderful beer."

"O - well i finally got to try the trappist beer ive been waiting so long for. i feel like the anticipation of trying it may have ruined it a little for me, but i still enjoyed the beer a lot. i picked up a few bottles so ill be getting a couple more tries at this one. not my favourite trappist, but hey, its better than a lot of whats available in my area so i won't complain. a trip to the monastery in belgium might help me enjoy this one a little more ;) great beer!"
""
"O - My first run-in with Orval. Extremely satisfied. Highly recommend. Looking forward to try more Trappist ales."
""
"Orval has a storied history but it doesn't quite live up to the hype. Has a lot of complexities, but they're muddled and the flavors don't ""pop."" Hard to recommend over, say, Matilda."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth: More thin than expected, almost bordering on watery. Lacking significant body. Fairly heavily carbonated."
"Too much carbonation, an awkward mouth-feel and a taste that verges into an area of something bittersweet - this beer is a major trappist disappointment."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Amazing beer that has been an inspiration to many brewers all over the world. This pint is incredible, but it seems like some of the edges could be rounded out a bit. Considering the generous window of expiration, I would be interested in trying a bottle that had been aged for a couple years (4/5)."
""
""
""
"O- very good, I expected a lot more of the traditional coriander and banana. It is a very good, glad I finally tried it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is more like it! This is the beer I remember having so many times. Not sure if I just got a random off bottle that I ended up aging but the Brett and Trappist yeast balance here is something of beauty. Perhaps the greatest overall beer on the planet. Always available and outstanding... All hail the trout and the golden ring. So many moral problems with perfect fives nowadays but I have a hard time justifying not doing it. This beer is as close as it gets."

"Overall - Very glad I tried it, if was available at LCBO or TBS I would consider picking this up again, however it does not seem to be frequently available and at the price tag it comes with, I would rather drink other beers when out, or buy beer in a similar vein at LCBO and get 3-4 times as much. However, I recommend a try as I seem to echo some of the reviews in that this beer is tough to nail down and has flavors that vary from bottle to bottle."

"Probably my 2nd favorite Trappist beer, after Rochefort 10. Awesome stuff."
""
"O - Delicate Brettanomyces exists, in this beer! Restrained barnyard funk allows the dry cracker-like flavor to stay a large part of the beer while nuances continue to come out as it's enjoyed. The crisp drinkability of Orval suggests it would make for a fantastic session Belgian beer if it weren't near $6 a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An extremely unique, complex and delicate beer as only the Belgians can create. Someone with a sophisticated palate could find some quite interesting and satisfying food pairings with this brew. This classic trappist ale is definitely one to try if you are Belgian beer enthusiast or just love beer in general."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was poured into a pint glass and I found it wonderfully enchanting. This is one of those beers that you know you are going to love just from the way it pours into the glass. I asked the bartender at Brazil craft beer what his favorite was and this is what he gave me. At first I thought he had picked it to boost up my bar tab but after the first glance knew it was going to be special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a beer that seems to vacillate wildly from bottle to bottle and depending on age. I've had some that were overpowering hop bitterness and funk, others that were floral and slightly fruity, and still others that hint at the darker fruits of your classic Belgian dark ales and quads. It's an enigma to be sure. One that I always enjoy, but I lament the inability to find it very fresh in the U.S., especially after getting to have some that was about 3 months after bottling when I visited Brussels a couple years ago. No matter, as the weirdness and complexity of this beer is what always draws me back. More often than not, if I go to a bottle shop looking for a beer without luck, but don't want to leave empty-handed, I'll grab a bottle of Orval. If you don't like it the first time you try it, I still would encourage you to give it another try."

"Is Michael Jordan the best basketball player? It's probably not fair to say since there may be some undiscovered guy out there. And that's how I feel about this beer--in my humble opinion, it seems doubtful that there will ever be a better trappist ale, and yet who knows? What I do know though is that I enjoy the heck out of this--its amazing appearance (a huge foamy head that while receding quickly leaves great lacing) and a smell with complex floral notes and candy-like sweetness that is balanced by something (or everything) and keeps the smell so inviting. The taste is amazing--sweet, delicate, floral, balanced, intense, thoughtful, and beautiful. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, making it a beer to swirl around in the mouth for several seconds before swallowing, allowing the opportunity to absorb all of the flavors. And yet, even the mouthfeel somehow manages to seek balance with its crispness. Overall, in my opinion this beer is absolutely one of the best out there even considering its relatively high cost (about $4.25 per 11.2 ounce bottle). Some may fail to appreciate the beer because it doesn't have the high ABV of some Belgians or the bitter hop taste of some of their favorite IPAs, but for what it is, it's just about perfect, and I use that word as sparingly as I can."

"Poured from bottle, age uncertain but probably fairly fresh based on published taste descriptions of younger samples. A burnished copper color with a vast quantity of off-white lacey head. Aroma is a potent mix of pear, fermented white grape, citrus notes, some mild peppery spice. The head itself is acrid and bitter, tasting of burlap sack and wood char. Maybe let this settle out and then sip the liquid. The latter recalls lemon meringue pie, pears and apples, figs, a little white wine, aromatic brown spice like nutmeg or calamus, with a bone-dry finish that leaves echoes of barnyard funk and wine cask. Some complain of excess carbonation but I did not notice this. A complex and polarizing beer that stands apart from other Trappist beers and actually captures the monks' intent to create something that is not overtly malty or sweet. Some pine resin results from dry hopping but does not overwhelm the other flavors. Deserves its reputation and truly unique."
"o: Completely unique, on of my favorites."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Much better than I remember. When I can't get any Saison Brett, I'll probably turn to this for my Brett fix."

"Overall - this beer changed quite a bit as it warmed up. The off taste was off putting, but great smells"
"O- Great example of a trappist institution. Pleased to have found a bottle with some age on it. 10/10 would buy again."
"Poured from a bottle into a chalice, the beer is a muddled, hazy, amber-brown coloring with a tall, dense, chunky, off-white head that coats the glass and has a very decent retention. Aromas of coriander, all spice, plum, banana, cotton candy, and a bready backbone. More and more aromas come off as the beer warms. Flavors are spice forward, with a great blend of nutmeg, coriander, all spice, and hints of clove, with an old world fruit backbone both rich and sweet. Smooth, light body with a slight effervescence that keeps the sweet and rich flavors blended and drinkable. The aftertaste is a sugary sweet undertone with the spice blend still holding court overall. Lingering finish, with spices left dancing on your taste buds, waiting for another sip. This beer is a classic!"

"Just amazing. My perfect daily beer. Great with cheese or just as a refreshing beverage. It is probably where New Belgium got their inspiration for Fat Tire. I love and drink all the Belgium Trapist brews, but this I could drink to my satisfaction and still walk..."
""

"Overall: a good beer, but a bit disappointed because I feel this brew is over rated. 11.2 fl oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass, initially sharp, smooth and drawn-out finish. I would recommend this beer with slightly lower expectations."

"O: Not a bad BPA. Very interesting fruitiness with good sweetness and drying contrasts. Odd metallic flavor kinda detracts a bit, not sure what that's all about - possibly due to the age? Still, flavors meld together well and this is an exceptionally drinkable brew. I enjoyed it!"

"Pours a hazy orange with a huge white head that settles into a lacy cap. Complex aroma of yeast, caramel and funk. Earthy with a hint of hoppiness and some barnyard. Medium body with light carbonation starts and finishes bone dry. Super complex and superbly crafted, though I would expect nothing less from one of the worlds great beers!"
"Look, I know this one has a huge amount of lovers. Maybe this bottle is between ideal age? About 10 months old maybe another year makes it more sour or a bit fresher it is a bit more something? I don't know. Either way there's nothing really wrong. I have no idea what style you'd call this, it isn't a belgian pale ale as I've come to know them. So I'm not sure how to really judge it....a sour but not sour pale ale? Sorry I'll pass."
""
""
"Overall, not as complex as many Belgians. In a way, it is refreshing in how straightforward it is. Fun to drink, but the heavy carbonation makes it sippable, not gluggable. Never overwhelming; every sip is pleasant. The head is the most impressive I have seen. Not a nerdy beer, more of a back porch easygoing beer when you're trying to kick back and sip on one or two."

"O: Basically, it's an awesome beer. It's a good Belgian Pale Ale to introduce your friends to the wonderful world of beer. Anyone can taste the greatness in Orval."
"Pours hazy orange with a billowing head of resilient foam that finally dwindled to a rocky cap with dense, sticky lacing. A spectacular pour into a tulip. Nose is complex and kept expanding as it warmed. Sweet Belgian yeast, apples, floral, banana, some medicinal alcohol, a little caramel malt poking through all that bright fruit and brett funk and ultimately finds some spice character. Taste is superb. Relaxed, smooth, full without heaviness, some lemon, some hay and horse blanket. No alcohol on the palate at all. Drinks very dry and leaves a long bitter finish that isn’t tart or sour. It’s earthy and hop bitter. Very impressive, indulgent, full of traditional character and easily approachable for a session."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): Orval is legendary for a reason. It's a totally awesome beer and a great intro to Brett-infused beer. While it's not a particularly intense beer, it's very refreshing and certainly a unique take on the Belgian Pale Ale. One of the rare Trappist ales that isn't thick and heavy. It also features more obvious hop character than those beers. Great stuff that's certainly worth buying if you see it hanging out on the shelf. And fear not–Orval has quite a good shelf life. Dust off that bottle from 2010 and enjoy some vintage beer!"
"Fantastic overall beer. Very drinkable and a good representation of the style. My only letdown was that the flavor wasn't as good as the smell led on (but still fantastic overall)."
""
""
"Overall, I am not sure what to think since this is my first Belgian Pale Ale. It is definitely sweeter than an American Pale ale but the hops that come in on the backend are strong but not overpowering. I like it, I am going to try more of this style."
""
""
"Fantastic beer. Has everything that a beer needs. Every good beer characteristic (refreshing, warm, hoppy, malty, creamy, earthy, etc., etc.) balanced in a single bottle. Would actively seek it out in the future to try again."
""
"Overall a really interesting beer, nice Belgian characters blended with nice Brett like funk. This is not even a year old so the wild character is barely there, but I've had some quite aged ones and they are a lot funkier and awesome. Maybe I should re-review an old bottle sometime, but still a great Belgian beer."

"Bottled in July 2012."

"A Trappist Classic and a well deserving of this title. smells like dark fruits. Tastes like rasberries, blueberries, and dark flavors. Sweet, with a carbonation ending. Refreshing"

"This beer pairs very well with fish tacos, seared ahi, ahi poke, ceviche, and carne asada; I highly recommend this unique Trappist to anyone"

"Bottle from Total Beverage in Murfreesboro, TN. Vastly different from other trappist beers i've had. Unique Bottle shape. Poured into a tulip. Highly carbonated, huge head. Lot's of lacing. Pours very light yellow/orange, cloudy like a hefe as it's unfiltered, pretty decent looking beer can't lie. Smells decently hoppy, with other similaraities to a hefe with notes of citrus, subtle banana, and clove, with a splash of coriander. Drinks very smooth, with a subtle hoppy bite. Very distinictive belgian yeast taste, but with more bitterness than than sweetness, yet not overpowering. Lot's of carbonation. Has a sort of wine like aftertaste, but lacks the punch i was expecting for a 7% beer, i guess this could be good or bad. Very well balanced beer, will buy more, although I prefer other Trappist Beers, this one stylistically is very different stylistically from the likes of Rochefort, Westmalle, etc.."

"O: There seems to be a group of people who loves this beer and those who hate it. Personally I'm the latter. I just don't like it. Not that other people shouldn't its just not what floats my boat. I wish I could like this and it really seemed like something that I would. I'm typically a pretty big fan of anything with a Belgian yeast strain in it but this just didn't do it for me. I feel like I'm going to have to give this another go in the future."

"O: Definitely one of the finest beers to ever cross my lips. Hands down the best example of a BPA I've ever had. This was my first encounter with Orval, so I've never had a young version to compare with this one. I will absolutely be adding a few bottles to my growing collection and sampling them at various ages."
""
""
"Overall- Easy to review and grade. A+, no doubts about it. I have founded a new go to beer. This easily one of the top ten Belgian beers that I have had. This is much more exciting than a quad. It has the simplicity and perfection of some Tripels with the added positive of Saison messiness. This is a delight to drink."

I am enjoying it, but it's not at all what I remember it to be, or how others have described it here on BA. I will revisit this one with a fresher specimen when I find one."

"A quintessential trappist ale that fully lives up to its reputation. Bottle from the LCBO pours a hazy dark golden colour with amber highlights. It has an impressive large-bubbled and off-white head that leaves lacing down the glass. Aroma is Belgian yeast-forward, with the spices that implies, and a nice caramelized malt backbone. Flavours range from caramel and toffee sweetness, to hopped bitterness and coriander lemon rind. As that portfolio changes and gains depth as the beer warms, it is definitely a bottle to sip and savour."

"O: great Trappist beer simple straight forward label design which has an interesting story behind it"
"Overall- This is my first Trappist ale and it's not bad. It's a little different than what I normally enjoy but I like it."
"Overall, this beer deserves hight honors and it is one the highest rated beers in my profile. This beer has been sitting in my cupboard for a year, which really made it taste so good. It is a higher 6.9%, but it felt like a lower 4-5 %. I was quite pleased with the non-alcohol taste. I have a couple more in my cupboard that I will open next year, perhaps the year after. The date says they are good until 2017! Maybe I'll just wait until then to crack these babies open, eh!? The older the better! Cheers!"
"This beer is very different from what I expected. All these Trappist ales have been very on the sweet side. This beer on the other hand is very dry. Subtle hop and pine notes. Light apricot flavors and a very dry finish. The head on this beer is a soft, egg white, pillow like texture which is very similar to how it feels in the mouth. Smells much sweeter than it tastes though. You would expect a sweet, dark fruit flavor but one would be met by the opposite."

"Taste: Very, very relaxed. Sweetness permeates the entire brew, and absolutely none of the alcohol from the nose is apparent. Those floral hops play a much larger role in the taste than the nose would indicate, and it's entirely refreshing when enjoyed under the slick, wet mouthfeel that the brew supplies. Somewhat distinctive, if not generic yeast notes are omnipresent throughout the sip, but I'm not picking up the fruit notes that the aroma indicated nearly as much as I anticipated. Carbonation is medium and crisp. Pepper rings out strong throughout. I saw a review that mentioned a “fresh-cut hay quality”, and it's right on the money. The finish is a really sweet, organic banana note that makes itself known even after you've finished taking a sip. Overall, this is perhaps the most refreshing of the Trappist ales but certainly doesn't compromise in complexity."

"Overall: after all the massive hype surrounding this beer, I actually thought it fell short a bit. It is certainly fairly unique and quite decent, but I still reckon I could get a better beer - and far better bang for my buck - by going to something like a St Feuillien Tripel."
"I could see this with seafood. Octopus, mussels, or squid would be my choices."
"O-It seems that all of the flavours in this beer come to play in equal quantity. Nothing takes the lead and everything comes together at the right moment. Thoroughly enjoyable and well made beer."
"one of the best out there, and possibly my favorite of all the trappist brews. pours a sort of copper red color, brassy and thin looking, with a tall white head comprised of fairly large bubbles. the nose is a little bretty, kind of funky and wild, with some malt sweetness and a really robust Belgian yeast. the flavor is quite similar to the nose, rich in taste but not in feel, yeasty, with some brown sugar notes and quite spiced, more than the other trappists anyways. i had an infected bottle of this recently as well, and the brett notes of that were downright overwhelming, like a wild ale. i almost actually preferred this funked out version to the normal offering, and am wondering how i might obtain another. even the standard product has quite a bit of interesting yeasty stuff happening. carbonation is vigorous, and the body is pretty light. this beer has its reputation for a reason, and is the product of top craftsmanship. one of my favorite beers with a nice dinner too, very versatile and palate cleansing with its mild acidity. yum."

"O – This is a fantastic beer. It is beautifully complex, yet easily approachable and very drinkable. The combination of aromas and flavors is so unique and well-crafted that I had a tough time deciphering the individual elements of each. These Trappist monks know what they’re doing. Their beers are phenomenal."

"Pours orange with just a bit of quickly receding head. Smell of yeast funk, pepper, banana, and a hint of grapefruit. Light to medium mouthfeel. Effervescent. The flavor follows with a very dry yeasty spice, some sweet sugars, and hay. Simple and yet well done. Yay Belgium. Overall I liked this beer, but I think it is vastly overrated among my fellow beer advocates. Perhaps the simplicity is its charm."

"Pours into the glass a lightly hazy deep golden color with a frothy meringue head that persists forever. The label is correct about the fruitiness I get that in spades as soon as I pop the cap off the top of the bottle. Pepper, spice, yeast, and a bit of golden syrup round out the nose. The flavor is sugary sweet with a lot of orange and sweet dark fruits along with some pepper, a hint of hop and a touch of alcohol. Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly sweet mouthfeel. This is a really nice beer that's easy to drink, I can't believe it took so many years to try this."

"I am opening a bottle dated November 2011. Almost foams over when opened but it sticks to the mouth of the bottle without spilling. Pours nice violin-resin color with foamy head that falls to a thin layer at the top. Big sour and fruitty smell- a bit of herb but mostly light sour raspberry candy on the nose. Taste starts totally different with the malts bubbling on my tongue with the yeast and fruit coming at the roof and candie with sour dry aftertaste. The sour notes stick lightly to the roof of the mouth and sides of the tongue after but it's relaxing. That's a damn good one!"

"O. A very enjoyable Belgian pale ale that is very well balanced."
""
"11.2 oz bottle dated 02/29/12. Pours hazy amber with tall, foamy, long lasting white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of sourdough, Belgian yeast, candy sugar and earthy hops. Body is full and creamy. Taste is Belgian yeast, caramel malt, ripe fruit, peppery hops. Finish is long, peppery. I don’t think this bottle have aged well."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is fruity, yeast, alive with flavor. Taste is also big on fruits, some malts and yeast, lots of flavor here. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
"O- A great belgian pale ale and the earthy character makes this both different from others in the same style as well as providing it with a little more character. As a person who edges towards the funky/sour end, this is my type of beer, but likely not offensive to others who do not prefer funk all that much."
""
"O: Really unique and diverse, and at the end of the night I liked it. Definitely a sipper and something to enjoy as it warms and different flavors emerge. This bottle is around 10 months old, and I'm sure older bottles taste vastly different because of the Brett. Not something I would seek out again, but a good beer."
""
"O: this is a very unique and very tasty brew, really enjoyed this."
"O: A real quality beer, no doubt about that, but I found it too dry and bitter. Wouldn't be a problem if it were balanced accordingly but from my experience bitter hops in Belgians tend to stick out like a sore thumb. It's definitely an interesting beer however and I'll have it again."

"After having had it a couple times relatively fresh in the states, I drank an aged Orval while in Belgium. It was possibly the best beer I ever drank. The brett takes over and leaves the fruit and hop flavors in the background. It is funky perfection."

"Overall: Finally went for this classic, and it did not disappoint! Would love to see what a bottle is like near the 'enjoy by' date."
"I love this beer. The smell and taste are really good, and it has a nice carbonation that I like. It's nowhere near any other trappist beer though, it's closer to an IPA even, which is why I don't score the overall a 5. But wow this is a really really good beer."

"i like this but i remember it tasting a little different. almost bubble-gum-my, in the past editions. but i am grading it from a perspective of knowing this is one of my all time favorites. i rate this with the duvel and chimay, up at the very top. these brews can be very rich, but when in the mood, excellent. the only dings in this would be the small bubbly, champagne sensation on the lips and the unexpected vinegar-y smell i got from the start. although i do love those sours, also."

"The aroma is very hoppy, fresh with a touch of fruitiness (citrus). The taste is perfectly balanced between the hop bitterness and the fruity sweetness. The beer is also yeasty. This is by far my all time favorite. A true classic that can be drunk on every occasion."

"Orval is a pretty awesome trappist ale. I guess when you only brew one beer, you have more time to test, tweak, and perfect it, and it seems like the monks at Brasserie d'Orval have done just that. On most days I'd say that this is not my favorite trappist ale, although it always stands out to me as the most unique. The Brett and the dry-hopping really set it apart from the others and always keep me coming back to this funny, oblong bottle."
""
"Appearance is clear light copper with big rocky head. Smell is complex with notes of honey, light fruit, floral and herbal notes, a bit of citrus, and slight earthy and phenolic yeasty smells. Taste is bitter at first and then herbal with a touch of fruit and bit of wild yeast funk. Unlike anything I've ever had, although some American wild ales are the closest. Dry with a some bite in the finish and a nice lingering bitterness. Very well carbonated with a great mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Not one to gulp down, but take a sip and then you will quickly take another and another. Overall this is one of the big classic Belgians you pretty much have to try. (I can't believe it's taken me this long.) Unique and very good."

"O-everything was perfect...and then I was let down when the beer was actually in my mouth. Not bad...but I was disappointed."
"Nice honey color. Liked the foam a lot. It covers the full surface forever and I value that. Smells like typical Belgian Ale yeast - very very yeasty. Tastes a bit sour and yeasty again. Medium body. I think it's a food beer meaning it's better with food then just by itself. I am having it now with garlic mashed potatoes, rutabagas and roasted chicken and roasted garlic on top of watercress. Quite pleasant."

"O: A must try for any beer geek and one of my favorites in the world. This may be a desert island beer for me. I've yet to have a bottle more than about a year old, so haven't appreciated any of the higher level of funk that aging Brett will bring out. World class, indeed."
""
""
"Pours murky amber-brown beer with huge resistant golden head. Aroma of fruits and flowers: apricots, gueuze notes (i.e. horse sweat), pine resin and more. Awesome! Magnificent dry & rather bitter (belgian IPA?) taste. Yeasts and herbal hop. Warmth & bitterness, bitterness & warmth. Outstanding specimen."

"Pours a cloudy, maize color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of tart fruit, yeast, hint of hop, slight sugar, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. The feel is also dry and tart. Tastes of slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight hop, slight yeast, hint of alcohol, and slight tartness. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Chimay chalice. Pours an unclarified dark honey with a two inch creamy persistent head. Smell is a soury lemon that dissipates afer a few minutes. Predominant taste is that of hoppy bitterness. Mild carbonation that makes this ale go down easily. Pale ales not my thing and this reminds me of why."
"This beer was amazing. I'm sitting here looking at my last sips wondering when I'll pick up another. I think because of the age of this beer it may be more sour making it all the more enjoyable. I'd certainly like to try a fresh one but for now I am ok with small, humble and sometimes dusty (but not expensive)."

""

"I drank Orval roughly 4 years ago, and it stuck in my mind as being particularly interesting. Now, I am reaching the realization that this is even more complex than I once thought. This does not really taste like a Belgian Pale Ale. Yes, it has pale ale malts, but it's also very flowery, had some sour/funk notes, and kind of tastes like a white wine. Bonus points for uniqueness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drawn to this bottle for some reason. Bready boozy smell at outset. Cider-like color with thick lacing. The best part of this brew for me is the complexity. At first taste I do sense the yeast, the astringency is there as others will agree here. I may seem off a bit in this but vinegar comes to mind as a mouth sensation, if you can somehow picture that in a good way. I guess there is an odd abrasiveness that somehow ""works"". Yes it is quite dry, however I can't help, and can hardly believe, that I also detect fruit or fig in the taste. As I mentioned, this is all about complexity. The mouthfeel for me is most abrasive up front, but it is up front where i also smell the fruit-like bouquet as I am tasting it. For some reason and I can't pinpoint exactly how, but this is very drinkable for a beer with such a distinct character. Spices are picked up too. Unusual. I guess the reason i think Orval is so good despite some unusual characteristics is due to the expertise in the brewery of using their ""brettanomyces"" yeasts the way they do. Apparently in most beers these yeasts are considered contaminants. With that it's no wonder I also favor saisons. All good here."

"Orval Trappist Ale pours a bit of a dark golden color, with not much of a lacy head. The smell is a bit sweet and has come candy aromas, on a strawery backbone. The taste is much the same sweet candy flavors on a strawery backbone. I thought it was a bit too sweet, but had a nice flavor. Overall i found it an above average beer, a bit too sweet and overrated in my opinion."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy orangish amber with a two finger clean white head. Abundant lacing visible along the sides of the glass. Smells of citrus and flora with a hint of pine. Seems to be a medium-bodied brew at first but finishes light, very dry, crisp, and clean. Tart citrus rind and grass dominate with dry, fruit tones throughout. Fantastic dry Belgian pale ale. Definitely one of the very best available."
"overall: solid stuff, but this bottle isnt reminiscent of ones consumed overseas"
"Overall - I must first note that I let this age for about 4.5 months before I couldn't help it any longer and enjoyed it as a graduation gift to myself. A most excellent Belgian Trappist Ale. Very interesting and complex. I highly recommend this gem of an ale to be enjoyed during a light dinner or as a stand-alone. I had this by itself and it was most satisfying. Will buy again...when I can afford $6 for an 11.2 vase-like bottle."

"O- Has a quite unique, peculiar bittering profile that does not make it an easy drinker, though i would still consider this one as a quite refreshing ale.

"One of the most original and funkiest beers ever made! Drinking it makes me feel like I am walking through a hay field during the early harvest. Lots of cows grazing around in the fields, freshly pollinated flowers, and funky fresh smells all on the wind. Love the beer, have had it fresh (less than three months old) and aged (3+ years in bottle), and I love it every time. Every bottle is different but the funk and the pure farm freshness remains each time."
" Overall, it's a very distinctive beer and one I would recommend even to those who shy from trappist ales."

"Poured into a snifter, the aroma was an immediate pineapple scent. By far, this was the highlight for me. Giving a slight head, the ale was a pale yellow with a moderate degree of cloudiness. The first taste sensation was a mild banana flavor which did not last long. Of course, this was the Belgian yeast shining though. The banana was accompanied by a tart woody flavor with a lemon notes. In some ways, the lemon reminded me of a saison. The flavors were balanced on an earthy backbone with a slightly sour aftertaste. It became obvious that this was a pale ale at this point. This Belgian pale ale was a unique experience. While I enjoyed it, I found myself wanting more from the beer. The Belgian yeasts seemed smothered by the other flavors."

"O: A terrific beer with a completely unique flavor profile. The earthiness of from the yeast, hops and brett make for a terrific, in-your-face drinking experience."
""
"D/O- The first sip of this beer is like a kick in the gonads but in your mouth. ""What is this!?"" Subsequent imbibing produces a flurry of happy chemical release in my brain. Really like nothing I've had before. This is classic. Highly recommended for Belgian beer fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update: As I continue to drink it (it's been about an hour now), the yeast REALLY dominates the flavor; almost as if it's totally consumed the malt. Still some hops."
"O. A very solid Belgian pale. Sweetness and bitterness and balanced very nicely here and this is definitely a refreshing beer."
""
"O: Duvel with hops. A primo brew. A bit pricey, but worth a try. A great celebration sipper. Fill out your Belgian dance card with this old school flavor-ite."
""
""
"O - Featuring an old school character, an amazing appearance and a great taste, this beer is such an experience. Unfortunately, the mineral and acid flavors are not my cup of tea..."

" Orval either has a recent quality control problem, or they have intentionally changed their brew. In either case I'm unhappy. Bring back the old Orval, please."

"Overall, this is an excellent beer that was extremely easy to drink. It was smooth and crisp and a lighter body than most Belgian beers. Back to the beer store to pick up more. A must try for anyone who loves good Belgian beers."

"O-I have never had a belgian pale ale before. I have had a handful of other belgians though and this is much different. Not in a bad way though. I think this is a pretty good beer overall, nothing incredible, I would prefer an amercan pale ale, but this is still a very fine beer I wouldn't mind having at anytime."

"Looks gorgeous - ruby/pear with frothy dollops of off-white goodness. The first thing that I notice on the nose is some kind of white wine character - grapes, bitter fruits, etc. Plenty of hop presence with some estery goodness in there. Certainly is a unique tasting beer. Not quite as vibrant as I was hoping. The notes that build the aroma just aren't here on the palate. This one has a year on it, so I guess this beer might just be in an awkward phase because the look and smell suggest something greater and more pronounced. Perhaps my least favorite of the Trappists, which isn't saying much at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The most unique beer ever, simply a joy to behold and to drink."
"O: Truly a quality old standby. However, despite reports I've read to the contrary, I don't think the extended cellaring did the beer any favors."
"Drink- Truly a classic. A well rounded beer with large and balanced flavors."
"The aroma alone is intoxicating. The layers transform flawlessly. I waited until I got my hands on an Orval chalice before I reviewed this. It's a hard one to age because you just want to drink it. In a league of it's own."
""
""
""
""
""
"A true classic, dry-finish and wonderful washing-powder aroma, gorgeous off-white head, mouthfeel that is creamy and light all at the same time, I can't really describe it fully. You can drink one, or you can drink five (though it's quite a bit stronger than, say, your average pilsner and you do so at your own risk). All I can say is that it's the only beer logo I am considering tattooing on my body -- that's how much I adore and revere this beer. My favorite Trappist, hands-down."
""
""
"At first almost abrasive with carbonation. I stirred the carbonation out and I like it much more. Lots of yeast flavors, fruity and acidic. Pleasant booze character. Brett flavor lingers on the back of the tongue. Aftertaste is great. Has some body to it considering the sour fermentation. Really unique beer, and surprisingly refreshing considering the ABV. This is my first orval. I like it."
""
""
"O - I was impressed by the appearance, smell, and mouthfeel of this beer. The flavor had all of the elements I was looking for, but there was an additional astringent aftertaste I was not pleased with. I was a little bit disappointed with this beer, especially at $5.99 for an 11 oz. bottle. I may try it again at some point to see if the aftertaste is typical or not."

"This beer has an interesting combination of appetizing dryness and slight, acidic sourness. The sourness is not biting, but rather just a bit of a pinch to add to the finish and let you know it's there.

"D - Definitely feeling a little underwhelmed by Orval. While I'm a big fan of Belgian ales, this one wasn't really my cup of tea - or beer I suppose. It was certainly worth trying once, and maybe I'll even revisit it again with a re-review down the road, but until then Orval will sit comfortably behind the likes of finer Belgian ales out there for me."

"M - light carbonation with a smooth feel with a small bite right in the middle"

"Bought a bottle of this from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured it into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet. Amazing thick head that settles and remains for the life of the brew in a fried egg pattern with a thick yolk in the middle of the glass that thins out from there. The smell is the first thing that embraces me as I pour it. Amazingly strong and pleasant! The taste is equally wonderful: a strong barley base with fruity notes of apple and spice. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but still pleasant in how it foamed back up in the mouth a bit. Overall, another great Belgian trappist brew to add to the list."
""
""
"This was very mild. I can tell that there are complexities in here, but it's hard to coax out of the glass. I get more malt aroma with a good swirl, which showcases the grains well, but the yeast really doesn't stand out as much as I think it should. I feel pretentious saying how this beer should be brewed, one that has been brewed for hundreds of years, but hey, it's how I feel. I'm thinking this was built up too much for me and I wanted more complexity. It's a great Belgian Pale, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer - a very well done Trappist beer. I'm really glad this is available at the local bottleshop because I have and will continue to enjoy this beer. Nice complexity in the aroma and flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: Although this isn’t my favorite style, it is very easy to appreciate. Very complex and balanced despite the intensity of its flavors. The measuring stick for Belgian pales."
"O: Doing a formal review only confirms why this is a classic. It also reaffirms why one could argue that this is the class of the Trappist ales, and why it remains one of the best beers in the world. I can't believe I went a year or two without having it. This should be in both my refrigerator and cellar at all times."
"As I pour into my goblet Orval appears as a beautiful shade of clear copper, topped with a very puffy 1"" white head. The aroma is very rich and complex. I'm picking up spices, a yeasty 'farmhouse' funk, sugary malt, and various fruits- including green/sour apple, lemon and banana. What's nice about experiencing this beer is that the initial flavor and feel is crisp and peppery, with a subtle hint of hops, and the finish is a nice 'banana bread' aftertaste. Absolutely delicious and drinkable anytime. One of my favorite beers."

"11.2 ounce bottle into tulip, bottled 11/13/2008, best by 2013. Pours hazy deep orange color with a huge foamy khaki head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap. Some spotty lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation. Aromas of big brett character: tart apple, wet hay, funk, cherry, pepper, lemon, grass, bread, and yeast spices. Awesome aromas here, the brett did a nice job over 3+ years. Great complexity. Taste of big biscuit, pepper, grass, citrus, lightly tart apple, light cherry, and yeast spices. Fairly dry finish; but some lingering notes of biscuit, pepper, light fruit, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium boded; with a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable at 6.9% with no alcohol other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Belgian pale. Incredibly complex and balanced after 3 years of age. I will definitely pick up a fresh bottling of this to compare how the Brett transforms it."
"Served from a bottle into an Orval glass. Deep amber/copper color. The nose is slightly vegetal, but has layers of complexity which keep one sniffing. Fresh mouthfeel with layers of subtle meyer lemon and dried herbs. A touch of honey on the finish. A favorite."
""
""
""
"O: A beer for a reason. Pretty darn delicious and spot on."
"O: a pretty obviously high quality brew, apparently these ""trappist"" folks know what the hell theyre doing haha, not the best ive had for the style but its definitly top three, highly recommended"
""
""
""

"Overall- A great beer and a great example of a Belgian pale. Definitely one I will seek out again."
""
"Bottled 25/03/2010 best before 25/03/2015. Poured from bottle to NBB Globe. Pours a hazy golden amber with am impressive 3 finger white billowing head. Supreme retention and excellent lacing. Looks great. The aroma filled my office upon pouring, powerful sweet flavors and yeasty with a mix of floral hops, clove, apricot and banana. Very similar to the nose. Very balanced between the malty sweetness, yeasty fruitiness, and mild bitterness. Sharp and crisp. Perfect carbonation for the style. Overall, very good beer. Would happily pour another if I had one ;)"
"Poured into a chalice the head just explodes on this beer. I served mine at about 52F and it seems to be the near perfect temperature to experience the wonderful head. The appearance is a darkish orange with lots of bubbles coming from the bottom of the chalice. I did not observe any ""floating"" yeast. The scent is all apple and some dark fruit. This beer literally explodes on the tongue with the taste following the scent of apple and dark fruit, a bit of hops and bitterness and sweetness simultaneously. The carbonation is pronounced. I could easily drink this one as a session beer but for my taste it is too special to do so. One of the finest beers I have ever experienced."

"Overall - Ive been an avid beer drinker for a few years now and always read about how good this beer was. For some reason i couldn't bring myself to pick one up for 7 bucks a bottle. I finally did and WOW, this is easily one of my favorite belgian beers I've ever had the chance to try, so complex with a ton of nuances. I am a privileged man."

"Orval Trappist Ale is a very nice, occasional beer. In my opinion, other trappists have more to offer, but none are as refreshing as this."
""

"A great beer with more complexity to shake a stick at but at the same time easy to understand why some people, especially beer rookies, don't get in the first time around. Fine backbone with a glorious array of spicy herbal hops, this does the business and does so with dignity."

"Overall. What a great beer. Stands apart from most trappists with the light sourness and funk. Just beautiful."
"O: Good. Not exactly what I was expecting from the talk that I've seen and heard about it. Not nearly the Brett bomb that it's been described as. Good beer, a classic, but not sure that I'd drink another one fresh, I may buy another and sit it in the fridge for a couple years and see how it progresses."
"D - A remarkable and complex beer thats highly drinkable. From my limited experience with Trappist offerings, it's certainly unique. I'd love to age this one."
""
"Pours a nice rich mahogany with a ton of off white head that sticks all over the glass. Nose is slightly tart up front, with some fresh green apple followed with a funky woodsiness (I imagine a mushroom growing on a slightly rotted out log). I get just a little bit of a flowery soft scent, like lavender. The taste was good but I marked it lower than the nose because I am getting a harsh/flat bitterness like aspirin left to dissolve in the mouth. The mouthfeel was also very, very thin, combined with the very active and prickly carbonation, this felt more like a soda which really detracted from the taste. As I let it warm up the mouthfeel is improving and I am able to taste more balance but it is still not quite there for me. This one might just have a bit too much age on it (~3 years) and the brett has thrown it out of balance, I would like to try a fresher bottle to compare"

"O- Been hanging onto this for a little while now and looking forward to drinking it. Being that the NY Football Giants just won I am indulging. Excellent balance and taste to this. You can almost feel the history and tradition while sipping. Worth that ""World Class"" distinction."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"O- I have to admit that there are a lot of Belgian strong ales which I don't 'get'. Duvel tastes like overcarbonated Heineken to me. I don't see the magic in Chimay Red. But this one is different, it really balances all of what makes Belgian pales what they are, the complexity and unique flavors imparted largely by the yeast and fermentation, while remaining accessible and very drinkable (it just tastes good!)."
"O - Easily a top example of the style. Always amazing, and worth trying."

"O- This beer is like no other out there that I have come across. It’s definitely one of those beers that a certain percentage of people will not appreciate. It may even be said to have an acquired taste. While I find this beer a bit pricey, I do enjoy revisiting it from time to time."

"To me, this succeeds at being many things at once, but I don't feel it's really exceptional on any level. I've enjoyed the 5 month and 13 month old bottles I've had recently (which were massively different), but there are certainly better trappist ales, better dry brett golden ales, better Belgian pale ales out there. This is pretty notable in its transcendence but it's not straightforward enough for me, I suppose."

"The flavor is light and clean. It is a great example of a well made belgian beer. This is one of those great examples why everyone thinks so highly of belgian made beers."

"Strong fruit nose, strong sour apple but clearly the intended flavor. Balanced bitterness. Very clean mouth feel. No lingering after taste."

"Overall, a great Belgian Ale, there are few I have enjoyed more. It is my favorite of the Trappist Ales I have had, certainly the most unique. Perfect balance meets brettanomyces!"

"Hoppy (maybe a bit too astringent), fruity, spicy, sweet yet dry, just really interesting and complex. The brett is more subtle but present. What's not to love. Amazing beer."

"Overall, this is indeed a fantastic beer. Although it has failed to overtake Nocturnum as my favorite beer, perhaps it is unfair to compare the two. The Orval is definitely my favorite Belgian Pale Ale but I'm a sucker for Belgian Strong Darks. Overall an excellent beer and one I would recommend to any fan of pale ales."

"Had this last night after a LONG time without having one. $5 at Stoney's liquor store in Indianapolis. Great beer, I really enjoyed it. Has a nice sourness and dry hop presence. Poured REALLY foamy, had to let it settle 2-3 times to get the tall drinking glass filled. This is a classic, no doubt about it. I love the simple presentation of the label, and (rarely for me) the lack of a totally in your face flavor. This has a nice subtlety. Its hard to beat when it comes to Belgians if you're looking for something on the dryer side. Thanks for reading. Drink one soon."

"Served at cellar temp from bottle poured into wide mouth goblet. Upon opening the bottle it hisses a very healthy carbonation and smells of yeast, lemongrass and a very clean musty attic. A clean pour with no sediment shows just how very carbonated this beer is and results with a very large head that crackles and pops receding into a great bubbling lace. A minute after the pour I put my head close to the glass and the beer is still bubbling and talking to me. Aromas from the glass are pale malt and cream. Beer drinks very dry and creamy with a bit of a pucker at the end, but not in a sour way at all. Almost like hay, dirt, mushrooms, and a very very good bread of a type that I have never had before. I am not experienced with brettanomyces but I think that is what this is and is flourishing in this beer. The beer was bottled on 29/07/2009 and that would explain this. It is all very enjoyable and makes me ponder at the end of every sip and I very much like this beer. So very smooth with no noticable alcohol. I could chug this beer if I wanted to quite easily, but that is not what I want to do. Then it would be gone and I would be sad. This beer is forcing me to enjoy it and I am sipping it slower than any beer I've had in a while. The bretty flavor stays in your mouth long after last sip is gone and that makes this beer all the more valuable. A beer that keeps entertaining the tastebuds even after it's gone. Orval trappists you have created a truly great beer and it's no wonder you only make two different beers. No need to make any more when you nail one perfectly. A 5 out of 5."

"This beer gave me the impression that was much stronger than it actually turned out to be. While the taste isn't for everyone, this has a classic appeal to it based on the cloudy hue and flavors that might not appeal to the hophead or extreme beer fanatic. The complex taste and slightly sticky mouthfeel lead to a slow session that's every bit enjoyable from start to finish. Any lover of beer owes it to him or herself to try and enjoy this!"

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Dark brown colour, cloudy, 2 finger head. Had strong phenol smell, even got some hubba bubba. First mouthfull was very sweet but the bitterness increased with every sip. Tasted of roasted malts, some charcol. This beer didn't taste like other belgian beers I've sampled, I thought it was more like an ESB. Overall, looked like a hefeweizen, tasted like an english strong ale and smelled unlike any beer i've ever had. I bought a 4 pack and will lay down at least two before drinking again."
"Took me a while to find one in Spain but I am closing in on all the trappistes. Pours an orangish clout into my chalice with nice lacing and long lasting head of a light golden color. Smells somewhat cider like and not too overpowering. Taste is very good, some bitterness and tartness like a pear or apple cider and some phenol and medicinal qualities. Very quaffable. Body is medium with continuous carbonation but in a good way. I will definitely stock up next time I find this at Al Campo. Salud!"
"Overall, its really a good beer. I'm gonna age them more. This is a beer that shouldn't be taken for granted."
"O: Decent beer, not my favorite Belgian but by far not the worst. I would recommend this to an experience beer drinker, a novice would not appreciate this beer for what its worth."
"Overall, a very fine beer"
"The feel of this beer is complex but smooth as it goes down. There is a multitude of different levels of flavor and feel."
"As I stated I prefer this beer when the Brett shines through and I know what it can be. This fresh is still a tasty beer and a nice treat."
"Conclusion, a beer that is complex enough to enjoy the tasting, as well as smooth enough to follow with another in the evening. I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants to enjoy a fine example of a Belgian Pale Ale, and it ""feels"" a bit special, being one of the Trappist beers."
"Love it!!! But who doesn't? Great Trappist ale with a sweet finish and a very round mouthfeel. That cloudy amber coloring is classic with a bit of a citrussy, sweeter aroma. It's well worth stocking up your cellar to ""age"" some of it for later. If you've never had one, then please wait no longer!!"
"O: Very good"
"O: This is my first Trappist beer and I like it. Very easy to drink with a nice flavor to it. I'll be trying more."
"This bottle is about a year old. It has lost the fresh, herbal notes but has only just started to develop complexity from aging. Overall, a refreshing, classy beer, though not amazing to me."
"O - A classic belgian. The old mustiness combined with the tart strawberry is a beautiful mix. Great beer."
"Medium body, ridiculously high carbonation, prickly and sticky on the tongue. This has the potential to be great, but there's definitely some really obvious flaws."
"Started off looking and smelling fantastic but ultimately didn't live up to that initial impression."
"purchased this for the first time finally, mainly because of the bowling pin shaped bottle and because because the store had the orval goblet next to it for $4.99. also has a bottled on date of 22/04/2010. pours out a cloudy golden orange color with the thickest three finger bright white head i have ever seen. the head slowly settles to an uneven foam resting atop the beer for the remainder of the drink. smells and tastes of sweet fruits, yeast and a little spice also has a little funk to it, but not in a bad way. mouthfeel is a medium body with a rich creamieness that is overtaken by a slight hop bite with a dry finish but very minimal bitterness. i can see why this is one of the worlds best."
"Do I wish I had waited for this to age a little? No, I like to be able to taste what the base of this beer is before the bugs have there way with it. Do I wish I had a 2 year old bottle to follow this one up with? Absolutely, unfortunately I don't."
"Great beer, I can see why so many people like it so much. This makes for a nice sit-back-and-relax beer while still giving a complex tasting."
"Overall one of the best trappist ales out there. And my personal favorite trappist brew."
"O: I really, really enjoyed this. This is so complex but also somehow really well balanced. I'm going to get this again... and again... and again"
"O: Sometimes I feel like people in America assume that since a beer is from Belgium it must be good. There is no mistaking Orval; it is very good. The beer is balanced and elegant, and it easy blends a higher alcohol percentage. Lovely flavors continue to develop as the beer warms. It truly is a a winner."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. This is probably the most unique of all the Trappist beers. Orval is funky in a good way. Definitely recommend giving it a try."
"Overall - a great beer. Not what I was expecting, but delicious. It will definitely be showing up in the fridge again."
"Overall, this is a unique Belgian and a real treat!"
"O: A very beautifully built beer, with nice restraint. Not my favorite Trappist, but a unique variation among its brethren."
"Clean finish, crisp and refreshing. Flavors are really sharply defined and just excellent. I'd prefer this over the many saisons and other brett beers on the scene today. Does the trick in terms of taste and refreshment. A classic for a reason!"
"wouldnt mind having this again. this definitely has the potential to become a session beer."
"visit my blog at selfhatinghipster.com for more beer reviews, book reviews, music and more"
"D - Classic example of Belgian Pale with funk in my opinion."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this unique trappist ale and will go back to it."
"Overall: This is a very good Belgian Pale. The yeast spice was strong, but balanced well with all the other flavors. Very well done."
"its been a while since I've had an orval. This reminded me quickly that my next one should be a lot sooner"
"Food match: It is a challenging beer to food match. The boldness of the bitter/dry profile makes it a perfect match with bold cheeses (much like a red wine). Also venison and game meats would work well."
"O: I never would've imagined such a simple trappist ale could be so flavorful and pleasant. I'm quite surprised."
"It was a very nice beer. I'd recommend particularly to fans of saison ales."
"Glad I finally had this. I must say, didn't live up to admittedly very high expectations."
"EDIT: 09/24/11 Bottle aged 1.5 years. Strong lily notes have disappeared, much stronger barnyard aroma play through with a stronger finish on the palate. Not remaining hop aromas / flavours are apparent. Not as good as fresh."
"Gotta be honest, this beer underwhelmed me and was not worth the elevated price."
"O: not my favorite Trappist beer, although it's almost its own style. very refreshing, not too heavy, but it lacks a bold flavor. nice availability in my area, so I will probably pick it up again."
"D: This was certainly my favorite trappist beer; these monks know how to brew beer. Enjoyed with a cone of Belgian fries, this is heaven."
"O - I love this beer had it so many times before today with out reviewing it but finally brought a bottle home to review and each time I have it I like it more a complex beer thats easy to drink its going down great after a long day a of work"
"Man, the nose really had me going, but the taste didn't follow through. Bummed :("
"Overall Experience- This is an awesome beer and I will be bringing it to all social gathering. I'm sorry but if this doesn't make you want to drop that commercial beer and make the switch I don't know what will. The cloud like head, the overflowing floral aroma, the complexity, its all amazing."
"D: Pretty drinkable overall (or should I say 'orval'?), I like it a lot."
"Overall: Yeah, this beer does deserve it's high grades. There's not much out there, can't think of anything, that is like this beer. You have to at least try it, especially you're a fan of Belgian beer."
"Overall this is hands down one of my favorite year-round, always-available beers. Why don't I have a case of this at the ready at all times?"
"Overall: this is an amazing beer. Certainly one of the best of the few trappist brews and one of my new top favorites."
"Poured a 4"" off-white head. Hazy raw sienna yellow color. Smells of dried fruits and a little funk. Taste has the fruits, a little caramel, malt, and an aspect I had a hard time describing and I'm going to settle on almost a cola type flavor and sensation. Add a pretty long finish to it and you've got one classic beer."
"O- Some of the best beer period. Orval is amazing. Almost a sweet golden pale its just in a league of its own and will be forever in my mind."
"O. That's a quality beer, and no mistake. It's far too easy to keep going back to the glass for another sip, but at least it's not up there in the ABV. This one's going to be burning a hole in my pocket from now on, dammit."
"An excellent beer - great at 7 months - must try again soon."
"D: Quite enjoyable and complex, but in a relatively accessible fashion. This is a unique beer. I'm a bit embarrassed that I've never tried this (or many other Belgian standards) before."
"O: An extremely easy drinker. It would be tough to sip this beer because it almost beckons you to go back to it quickly for another sip."
"Fresh is unsurprising. And five years apparently isn't enough for the yeasts to do any thing remarkable. Other glasses of Orval over the past month have been equally unexciting. Not nearly as charming as I thought it was a few years ago."
"Just a beautiful beer and the benchmark for the Belgian Pale Ale style."
"O - the sum is greater than the parts; truly a classic"
"Overall, excellent, unique tastes that are definitely beer but not present in any other beers I know, if that makes any sense."
"O: A really nice well balanced beer."
"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will definitely be having it much more often. Great way to enter into the Trappist's."
"O- Textbook Belgian"
"This beer pours a nice slightly hazy amber color with a decent off white head. The smell is fruity and in irony with hints of Belgian yeast. The flavor is incredibly fruity with the first sip being full if rich tropical fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is light and has decent carbonation. Overall this beer is delicious"
"Truly a unique beer. A must have for any beer enthusiast, or any human being with taste buds."
"O- This is a nice beer that is very easy to enjoy. This seems to be getting better with very sip I take. I wish that it was as sour as the smell. Definitely will pick this up again."
"This is a beer that must be decanted super slowly not just to avoid stirring up the lees in the bottom of the bottle, but also because it has an inherent tendency to foam. Sure enough, over half of the glass was initially filled with dense, rocky eggshell-white foam. That was okay by me because it also allowed the funk of the strain of brettanomyces yeast that they use to fill the room. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity thanks to my oh-so-gentle pour. Nose had the Brett funk going, but not in an obtrusive way. I have long characterized Orval as Brett for Beginners, a way to introduce the heretofore uninitiated to the wonders of Brett without causing them to turn away and never want to try any such beer again. I think of Jolly Pumpkin beers in the same way. Mouthfeel was quite full, perhaps due to the large CO2 bubbles inherent in the beer, and with a bitter, funky flavor that is unique to this beer. I cannot adequately describe it, but do know that when I say ""bitter", I do not mean hoppy bitter, but more like a vegetable matter bitter. Finish was extremely dry, which is just the way I like my beers. I am not a sweet toothed person and bitter and dry suits me just fine. Do not pass up a chance to try this beer!"
"O- A great, refreshing summer sipper, with petite nuances that Trappist's are known for. Also, at 6.2% ABV, this one can be enjoyed without quite as much caution as some of the other Belgian heavy hitters. Defiantly a good choice, that I would buy again."
"Medium bodied with strong carbonation, this beer is as drinkable as it is delicious (which can be quite dangerous). Without being watery, this beer is easily sipped and gulped. The carbonation seems to be just right as it does not get in the way of the flavor but really helps to move this beer along."
"O: Why oh why did I wait so long to try this out. Without a doubt one of the most unique beers I've enjoyed to date. It's also a beer I'll be returning to with some regularity. To have such a fantastic beer on the shelf of every upscale grocery store is truly remarkable. Beer DOES NOT get any better than this. 5/5"
"Two fingers billowing white head, slow dissipation with significant lacing on top of medium gold clear body with multiple streams of carbonation rising quickly to surface. Damn hoppy for the style, just what I expected and a lot more, noble hops with some floral notes for good measure, pretty dry malt aromas. Taste is tres hoppy, a revelation for a trappist beer, absolutely unique, hops up front, a bit of malty sweetness in the middle, bready malts to dry out palate towards end, and a mild hoppy back end. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, happy mouth effervescence. I imagine aging will tame the hoppiness a bit, but relatively fresh, well, this is one world class beer. Exceptional."
"not a bad belgian, but there are better fish in the sea."
"There is so much at work here it's really quite amazing. All of the flavors blend together fantastically, and the dryness and range of fruity notes make this beer truly stand out. Not necessarily the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks of a Trappist brew, but very unique and surprisingly refreshing."
"I've been eyeing this beer for quite some time and I'm glad I finally picked one up. I'll probably get more in the future."
"D/O: I can see why this beer gets such good reviews. It's very well balanced, full of flavor, and easy to enjoy. It didn't hold up quite as well as I would have hoped as it warmed, but I could follow this up with another and be happy. I will be repeating. 4.5"
"O: Showcases the grain nicely. Good citrus and light fruit notes. Moderate bitterness, light and refreshing. Overall I'm not too impressed by this Trappist ale."
"O-okay, so while i was drinking this, i didn't realize its was a BPA. in fact, it reminds me of no other BPA i've had...its much better than the rest. this is just an amazing beer. it drinks so much quicker than any other belgian i've ever had. it also is so beautifully complex and the flavors are just great. i really love this beer."
"O - Really nice Belgian Pale Ale that was very refreshing to drink. Different from the other trappist ales and one that I am interested in aging."
"Exceptionally complex and interesting. I've never had anything quite like Orval."
"Excellent mouthfeel. More carbonated than your average beer. Starts medium heavy bodied from the malt but the dry finish helps to keep it a solid medium. Spicy flavor finish is felt in the mouth also. An excellent earthy BPA as opposed to a more dry, hoppy fruity offering like Ommegang's."
"Overall - Is this a farmhouse ale? Very different from the other trappist ales, this one is more sour and bitter, and hoppy. For a different twist on belgium ales, this is the ticket. Honestly not my favorite but worth drinking every few months for a nice change up."
"Not my favorite begian blonde. Lacking in some complexity and over carbonated for my tates."
"Poured from bottle, bottling date 2/2010. appearance is the color of caramel with good head. Very hoppy compared to other trappist ales. Very refreshing, highly carbed. I don't really get the brettanomyces funk that I was expecting, but not really overly familiar with this class of beers, so maybe I am just not sure what to look for. Overall very good beer, very refreshing and pleasant to drink."
"Good job, monks."
"O: A booming nose, exquisite taste, and superb look converge in classic style. Orval is swimming with history, and, as I have just learned, swimming with flavor, too. This would be a perfect dinner beer with so many different dishes – I may even consider cooking with it in the future. And, while it isn’t my favorite Trappist, you can certainly add this beer to my list of “Reasons to Visit Belgium.”"
"-Cheers"
"This was a good beer. I'm not a huge fan of Belgians, but this was very enjoyable. If it wasn't so expensive, I would drink this more often."
"Pours a dark, murky orange with a big, bright white, thick head. Great retention. Aroma of yeast strains, hay, lemongrass, citrus and spicy notes. Taste starts off with a musky yeast, barnyard and hay flavors. Citrus notes and a thick, sweet malt add balance. More yeast and grassy notes bring it home as well as a touch of Belgian spices."
"This is always an exciting beer, as I feel like every time i've ever had it, it's slightly different. This particular bottle was not quite as delicious as some that I've had (though still quite tasty), but smelled like heaven. A fantastic Belgian brew, endlessly intriguing and complex, and a favorite, for sure."
"Drinking the beer with a good amount of head will really help bring out the taste"
"O- All in all, this beer was still impressive. It's not my favorite Belgian pale, or favorite Trappist ale, but you can tell this is a quality beer that has been made forever."
"O: I don't have much experience with Belgian pales, but this one is very enjoyable. One I will definitely pick up again."
"This pours a hazy dull orange with a large foamy white head with large bubbles and a long retention. Smell is nice and fruity, some spices, maybe some flowers. Medium light feel with lots of carbonation. The taste is different from the way it smells, there is very little sweetness up front, maybe a little citrus fruit and malted wheat, a little peppery and lemon hints but its mostly dry / bitter on the way down with a little alcohol burn, very tasty. Overall an excellent beer, more bitter and drier than the few other Trappist beers I've had tastes like I love, its very good."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking hazy golden color, the head was big and needed time to settle before pouring out the rest of the bottle. The smell of the beer was a little spicy on the nose, had some good Belgian yeast aromas going on in there and even a little bit of flowers on the nose. The taste of the beer is a little sweet upfront with some yeast and spice in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had a good amount of carbonation to it. Overall I found this Trappist to be very good, I liked the different qualities it has which make it unique. I also find the bottle to be very attractive as well. Gotta try this one if you haven't yet."
"I have been chugging craft beer for about four years now and this is THE BEST that I have found.... yet. Spectacular in every way, Orval is what good craft beer is all about. Good complex taste, phenomenal drinking experience. They cost a pretty penny, so if I am having a bad day, or have cause for a mini-celebration... I'll grab one of these."
"Overall: A truly fantastic beer, and what I feel is a prototype for what a Belgian pale ale should be. The hops are strong and flavorful but do not overpower the taste of the beer. The amount of malts in this ale allow it to be a creamy and tasty experience. While it gives a nice little warming buzz after by the end, I'd consider it be an ideal beer to have during the summer. If I'd ever want a beer that is flavorful and dry yet not too intense, like a Duvel, I would pick this one up again."
"Overall: Because of the wild fermentation process, I always call this beer the geuze beer under the trappist beers. This beer is so unique, so perfectly balanced, on of the best trappist beers out there. I love it! For most regular trappist beer drinkers out of their style, which maybe explains the IMO the low average score this beers has."
"Overall, this is a pretty cool beer. I don't know whether I'd seek it out or not. Maybe that's just my taste though. It's certainly a very interesting beer worth trying."
"Smell was sweet and floral. I continued to get the image of baby blue skittles in my head when I was drinking this beer. It definitely has a candied taste that is hard to describe while having a spicy characteristic. Mouthfeel was excellent as with most trappiste brews. Sizzled on my tongue and went down smoothly with no carbonation build up in my throat. Definitely one of my favorite trappiste beers."
"Overall: This bottle is almost two years old and I'm not sure if that's what is affecting the nose on it. It's pretty good, though I'm not particularly fond of the way it hangs at the back of the throat. It really tastes like someone mixed dirt into the mash - doesn't ruin the beer for me, but I'm not sure I'd get it again."
"Light body with soft carbonation on this one. Overall one of the better Belgian Pales around. Great that this one is readily available. I'll be drinking more here."
"O- Definitely a tasty beer. For me the raisins and grapefuit are the main flavors and they combine well with the alcohol especially as the beer sits for a bit. Good bit of dryness keeps me wanting more."
"Oh well. Still a great beer, if a little dusty. Nice balanced body, pours beautifully; it's sweet, and memorably bready. That's the quality that sticks, and out of a draft, it's just great. If you're in the DC area, I'd recommend hitting L'enfant's happy hour to grab some glasses for $6."
"Overall / Drinkability: I had this before about a year or more ago, and I didn't get it. So now some time later and more educated, I find I still only want one and I'm done. So not very drinkable in that I want more, but a very ineresting beer to have due to the appearance and complex smell/taste combinations. Let's just say this beer leaves me challenged for how to define it."
"Mouthfeel: Rich, full and creamy. The carbonation is perfect. Orval goes down exceptionally smoothly."
"With the exception of Westy 12 and Rochefort 10, this might just be the best Trappist product on the market!"
"T: hop and belgian yeast, malty flavour, medium ligth body, perfectly balanced, you never get too much but neves too less"
"5.0 D: I've yet to have a bottle of this at any age that wasn't good, but it seems like 1.5 years is a pretty good place for it. Lots of funk without any hints of being ""stale"" or whatever you want to call it. Probably the best single out there."
"overall this is my least favorite offering of the trappists to date. surprising, as i had high hopes for this classic. not drainpour territory, and i can see where some would enjoy it, but alas it's just not for me."
"O - Overall a very tasty Belgian Pale ale and certainly a quality example of the style. I can understand why this is so highly rated. Some unique flavours and certainly worth a try."
"Man, this is one complex beer. Some very subtle notes hanging back in this to pay attention to. I can't say I loved every movement I went through with it, but it was all about the ride, & the ups & downs all added to up to a great outcome. This is definitely a once-in-a-while kind of experience, & I wouldn't want to overdo it, but I'll be looking forward to that next ""once-in-a-while."""
"Poured into a tulip, carefully decanted. Kind of annoying how much head comes from this beer, regardless of how gentle the pour. Appears bright orange with a gargantuan off-white head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Smells like crisp/tart fruit (pear, green apple), yeasty funk, hay, bready malts, and spices. The taste is very similar to the smell, bready malts and funk up front, followed by hay and an assortment of spices, tart fruit in the finish along with a dry serving of funk. Light bodied, heavily carbonated, became foamy in the mouth at times."
"Overall: This was enjoyable, I wanted to try something different and I don't drink many belgian style beers so this was an obvious choice. Glad i tried it, score is lower than average score because this is not really my prefered style of beer that I drink."
"Orval is a drink that can turn savages into civilized men. Although as a rule I avoid making dramatic and subjective statements, I have no hesitation in saying this is the most perfectly crafted beer ever. And I know for a fact that some of the world's best brewers wouldn't hesitate to agree. Drink it once, remember it forever. If ever I had to chose a perfect beer..."
"Pours a hazy amber / orange color with a crazy amount of head. The head is off-white and has pretty good retention. Smell is of light malts, some wheat, spice and yeast. Taste is very smooth. It starts light but comes in with strong taste in the middle and end of my sip. In the taste I detect a slight sweetness as it first touches my tongue, then I get a slight bit of funk with some light malts, in the end of the taste I get some pepper as well. The mouthfeel is tingly due to the strong carbonation, medium bodied beer. Overall this is a dang good beer, a favorite for me in this style."
"11.2 oz into a snifter...pours a big golden yellow with a monster head, even with a gentle pour...head on this is actually a bit much, even for the style. More hop character in the nose than any Trappist I've had before and more than most Belgian brews, with a sweet yeast funk that is quite enjoyable. The hops come through on the tongue too--definitely more bitter than most of its peers. I can think of a few other Belgian beers this bitter, but not under 7% abv. Mouthfeel is great. I really like this beer and recommend everyone try it at least once. As awesome as it is, it's still probably the least favorite Trappist that I've had (which doesn't really say anything bad about this beer, just a comment on the general superiority of the Trappist brews)."
"Prost!"
"Not my favourite of the trappist ales, much drier and more citrus than it counterparts."
"Thinking back over my history when Belgian pale ales, it's really all too evident how unique Orval really is. If I could name one enigmatic BPA, it would be this (much to the chagrin of my grading practices). Orval is immensely complex and almost, in a way, thought-provoking. This is one beer maybe not quite suited for the casual beer-drinker, but I highly recommend trying it."
"I'd get this again to have once in a while."
"Nice complex beer. A very special brew. High carbonation. The booze is present, but it only adds to the complexity and nice dry finish."
"This brew poured golden brown, with a hint of tartness and tart fruit taste. The hops are here but not over powering. The 6.9%abv is just perfect. This brew is mind blowing though. You expect alot from a trappiste and this brew delivers. I would drink this before all other trappiste. My hats off to all who have made this brew as they are deserving of a standing O."
"You can't go wrong with this trappist ale. Pours into a signature chalice, a golden brown with a nice finger or two of foamy white head. Retains well, with nice lacing. Tends to be a bit more on the fizzy side, but it's tolerable in that regard. Floral hops in the nose, and lots of fruit. Yeasty background flavor; up front is pears, bananas, allspice, white wine; grassy quality, with a bitter, dry finish. Medium mouthfeel, and very drinkable."
" Lots of carbonation, thats lively on the palate. Woody, stale hop character. Yeasty, bubblegum fruit. Orange citrus, white grapes. Some wildflower scented honey, lemon and jolly ranchers. Dried wheat, musty hay barn. Bone dry, with a crab apple tartness and earthy hop bitterness that lingers in the mouth. Soapy. Has a feeling of walking through a farmer's field at harvest time. A very old world, dry and rustic brew. That would pair well with cured meats, cheeses and simple grilled or roasted chicken."
"I have to give them credit: my first pour of the Orval filled the ENTIRE glass with foam. It took me four or five minutes of very slow pouring to get it right. One of the most impressive heads I've seen. I didn't pour it right afterward, either. If you avoid pouring the yeast on the bottom, the color is bright yellow with orange tint. Once the yeast goes in, as I did it, it looks deep and hazy. Oh well. I smell grass, grapes, and citrus - great aroma. The malt and hops work well together. The hops are assertive, but don't detract from the complexity. This is one of those beers where you can notice additional flavor as it warms a bit. Mildly tart and a little drier than other Belgian beers I've had."
" There is no doubt that this is a perfected beer, Bravo!"
"O - a very good beer."
"Taste is delicious! I get some tart orange, some flowery sweetness, and a light wheat-bubblegum-clove finish. A unique and wonderful experience. A great beer!"
"Overall it is a good beer. Not a great one. Frankly I am disappointed, but thats what I get by expecting the stars from every trappist brew I taste."
"Overall: This thing is amazing. Worth every penny. Truly special, and I wish I could afford to drink this regularly. Glad its something that I can find on a shelf instead of having to jump through hoops to get it."
"O- This was a good beer. Nothing over the top and I respect it for that. A nice trappist beer with a little something different than others. ABV didn't seem to distract me from drinking an entire almost 12oz's of this."
"What a remarkable brew. So much flavor packed in that sexy bottle. Pour this as an apertif in place of Champagne. This is as high class as beer gets."
"Pours w/ 2-2.5 fingers of shaving cream like head. This may be the densest head I've seen on a beer. The base of the beer is a coludy, deep honey brown/orange color. Smell is musky, almost like an old wine cellar. Solid dose of Belgian yeast and bready notes. Honey cloves are also fairly prominent on the smell. So far, very impressed with this brew. Now only if the head would die down, so I can jump in. Very dry and herbaceous on the mouth. A healthy amount of hops, much more than I was expecting. Clove seems to come through quite a bit on the taste as well. Overall, a great experience worth trying especially if you are into Belgian style brews."
"overall, this is top 3 trappist. i've had all the chimay, westmalle, orval, rochefort offerings (ie the widely available ones), and i would choose this over a lot of them many many times. damn good beer"
"O - Uncharacteristic bitterness and solvent-like mouthfeel made Orval a bad experience for me. I would try it again, but only because I wonder if I somehow got a bad bottle."
"D-Overall this was a very interesting beer. It has such a nice feel in the mouth and the flavors all went well together. I would love to have this on draft sometime and will get it in a bottle again."
"I know that's a strange statement but if you've tried a lot of other attempts at a beer like this.. you probably know what I'm talking about."
"Aside from the overbearing carbonation (took three aggressive swirls to tame the second pour) this is pretty enjoyable. Since it's readily available around these parts it might be interesting to see if I can find different bottlings to compare."
"(11.2oz bottle-bottled 5.19.2010). Pours a hazy apricot color with a chunky white head and active carbonation. Nice lacing. The beer is almost one year old and seems to have lost its hop aroma. I’m mostly getting some sour, funkiness with some berries. Taste is tart-not quite sour-but the hops are there, albeit faint. Medium bodied with creamy texture. Finish is bitter and dry. My tastes have changed a great deal since I last had an orval and I like it much more now. It’s taken a loooong time for me to get into sour (or sourish) beers"
"O: This is quite the interesting drink that will have to be spaced over time. I will go back to this one...definitely a ""one and done"" for a while..."
"Wonderfully complex taste as well. Bready, spiced pears, flowers. Sharp edge from the carbonation and maybe an herbal hop. Wonderful. Refreshing and fulfilling."
"Exceptional."
"Overall this was a pretty good Belgian Pale Ale the best and most traditional one I have had to date. The aroma and look of this beer was awesome and the flavor was subtle yet pretty complex. It wasn't as flavorful as some of the American versions I have tried but it made up for that with it's complexity and the subtle flavors and great body made this beer have some great drinkability, this would hit the spot on a warm summer night. It was a little expensive but I feel it is worth the price to enjoy this beer once in a while. If you like Belgians this is a must try, a great old school brew."
"Overall this is an enjoyable drink. It is a surprisingly easy drink and quite tasty. A very nice Belgian"
"Pours a three-finger white head that takes forever to fade leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is tart and woody, flavor is tart fruit with a lingering tart aftertaste, only an OK Trappist ale. Pricey at $5.99 for a 330ml bottle from Kappy's Fine Wine & Spirits Peabody, Ma. Bottled on 4/22/2010."
"O - Pretty good beer, though the aftertaste threw me off. Wont hinder me from drinking it again though."
"Roughly 18 months old. A golden copper color of a beer with a white frothy like head. Aromas of musty basement, barnyard, some spicy hops, and many other complex aromas. Full bodied beer with high carbonation. Flavors of spicy hops, white pepper, tons of Brett flavors. Fantastic beer."
"Overall - The legend lives on. Absolutely fantastic. Whenever I have a bottle, I wonder why I don't do so more often. Cheers,"
"O: The pour and aroma were amazing, and while the flavor was good, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. A very solid beer and I did enjoy it."
"EDIT: As promised, I gave this beer a second chance about half a year after the first review. Bottle was stamped 7/10/2010 and 7/10/2015 (I'm assuming those are the born on and drink by dates, respectively). The second time the beer was even worse, I scored it 4 / 4 / 1 / 1 / 1. The horrific fish and soy sauce characters once again return. Perhaps it's just the Texas distributor that's at fault. I'll try again in a different state. One last shot."
"O: Wow, impressive beer. The alcohol snuck up on me because it was so easy to drink. Initially it came on sweet but that quickly ended and it was a great belgian pale ale: grassy and bready. Cant think of anything to change!"
"Cheers!"
"Dry, frothy, and light-feeling. Light to medium bodied, firm-ish. Very pleasant, contemplative but not fussy."
"O - Decent beer, but won't come back for it again anytime soon."
"O: A very complex and unusual beer. I have never had anything like it, and for that simple fact, very good."
"This is one of the most unique beers around, and again, I strongly recommend buying the Orval glass so you can fully enjoy it."
"Overall - I can perfectly understand how this can be rated as a world class beer. I didn't give it a 5 overall, only because the color in appearance is a little off for my style of liking and the flavoring, although good in all aspects doesn't make me crave the tastes like other A+ beers I may have tried before. Excellent brew none-the-less and will drink this one as often as I can afford it."
"I give two Schlitz for Orval. Every beer drinker should experience this brew at least once."
"Stay away from this one, go for harpoon or ommegang for a good bpa."
"O- This beer is great. If you haven't had it pick it up. It is a very old traditional beer that is very refreshing."
"Notes: Pale ale is just another style that the Belgians seem to get exactly right. It's not too hoppy or too bitter, or too dry. It's everything you want in a pale ale in all the perfect proportions. It is also very refreshing, and it reminds me of Spring. This is the perfect time to have one!"
"Low B"
"Enjoyed at the Tigin Irish Pub in DFW airport. Pours a hazy orange golden color with a finger of off white foamy head that has good retention and a slight amount of lacing. The aroma is strong with banana, pear and orange notes. The flavor has hints of banana, clove, pear, orange peel and a slight amount of alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice and bubbly, but not too overboard on the carbonation. Overall a great beer and I'm amazed I found it in an airport bar."
"O- I liked everything up to the ending. When you factor in the price, for a non-happy ending I think I'll look elsewhere."
"Overal this beer is extremely drinkable but just not my cup of tea. Would like some more malt and less yeast flavor. The moderately high carbonation level also is a detriment for enjoying more than one of these."
"O- Too pricey for me to buy this again. Not going to spend this much money just for 3 1/2 inches of foam and a nice smell. Duvel is nearly half the price with just sa good a bouquet and two times better/more taste. Duvel does not have as much lingering foam which is probably why it laces better than this stuff."
" ~ This is certainly a beer to be sought out. While its not the most difficult to find it does carry a heafty price tag. My suggestion is that you pull the trigger on one bottle and then determine if more are in order. In my opinion, I'm thinking this one is enough for me."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. These Belgian Ales I am really enjoying lately. World class"
"Overall- I can't believe this is the first time I have had this beer! (Maybe it was the unassuming label) Instantly one of my new favorites. Probably the best Belgian Pale I have had."
"Good velvety mouthfeel. Overall a very feel good beer with excellent drinkability. Could drink this all night. My favorite trappist ale."
"Overall: Delicious. Dry enough throughout to stand up to stronger cuisines, but so lingering and complex that I'd hate to spoil this three-part overture with soy sauce on the side."
"First of this is not my type of beer. I do not really enjoy pale ales but this is one I definitely had to try. With that said. Golden brown in color with heavy lacing and strong fingers. Previous review stated a sea foam head and that is spot on. Used a New Belgium tulip and even with it being .47L to the mark and probably .5L full the head rose slightly out of the glass. The glass does have a laser etching on the bottom that may have contributed to the larger than normal head. Smell is consistent with a pale ale. Strong hop aroma. Not quite Challenger hop but earthy and very green like. Taste has a sort of consistent flavor from beginning to end hitting you at first with some strong belgian hops with a nice balance of hop/sweet middle and finishing quite smooth and not too dry for my palette. Very active on the tongue and mouth with a sort of brut champagne feel. If I want to drink a pale ale this is the beer for sure. A definite beer to keep around to pair with when I make more spicy foods or blackened fish/chicken."
"There's beer. There's Belgian beer. And then, there's Orval. Worth falling in love with over and over again."
"D: I just don't understand why my taste buds are so different from everyone elses. This is the second Orval I've had in the past few years and I feel the same. Wishing I enjoyed it as much as everyone else."
"D - This is so easy to drink and thought provoking enough to make you come back for more."
"I've heard Orval derives its complexity from the Brett yeast used at bottling, and it's no joke. It really does add a new layer to something that might otherwise be 'just good.' Once I have the means, I'll be cellaring a few of these."
"I don't like very much this beer because it's too much acid and so not many drinkable.."
"Wonderfully drinkable with a velvety smooth mouthfeel. Overall one of the best beers money can buy!"
"I drank at around 16 deg celcius, and was quite impressed with the balance of flavors and drinkability."
"D: I don't usually enjoy belgian beers but i suprisingly really enjoyed this one. From the appearance down to the mouthfeel it was great."
"The CPJ"
"Overall a fantastic Trappist Ale, I can see now why the Monks only brew this one beer."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a GIGANTIC 4 inch bone colored head. Chunky head is full of numerous bubbles and lasts a long time. Somewhat formed ring lacing on the drink down. Smells very floral, citrus notes, slight vinegar, and must/funk. Taste is of apple cider, lemon zest, grass/flowers, funk, and a bitterness that starts at the start of each sip. Bitterness is very herbal and is quite mild after each sip. The funk is from the Brett used in creating this beer. This beer is very carbonated and yields a huge head on the pour. The body is somewhat light but crisp and clean. Drinkability is good but this is a beer I can see myself only having occasionally. A very unique tasting and interesting beer."
"It's a very unique beer, and there's not a lot like it, and while I appreciate that, it doesn't blow me away. I feel like it's both overrated and under-appreciated. A good beer and must try but nowhere near the top of my charts."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a thick billowy head that lingers. The nose smells of clean farm yard scents and nice earthy notes. The flavor has a slight farm funk, but it blends smoothly into the overall dryness, and slight grain flavor, of the beer. The mouthfeel is fairly dry, but refreshing. This is quite a drinkable beer, if it were a bit cheaper."
"This beer is very crisp, clean and dry. In fact, even 30 seconds later my taste buds are still trying to recuperate from the dryness of each sip. My only complaint (and I have a feeling this is my problem) is that it doesn't sit very well in my stomach. If I could drink more than one, and it wasn't so darn expensive, I'd drink nothing but this beer. Orval deserves the ""world class"" title it has."
"There is a certain dry crispness to this that reminds me of a hefeweizen. This beer is extremely drinkable given the abv and moderately high carbonation level. The aftertaste is very pleasant too, I almost have a hard time *just* sipping on this beer because its so easy to down."
"Complex but easy to drink, I give this beer high marks."
"Overall, enjoyed it a bit more than the first time I tried it, but not something I am dying to have, even though it is incredibly cheap here in Paris (1.90Euro) about $2.50."
"CHEERS"
"D- If you like watered down Belgium pale ales, this one's for you. You could chug it with a well fat budget."
"Drinkability: An awesome beer and I will be buying more."
"D: Quite drinkable and refreshing. A very fine beer, though its taste is not overpowering."
"Because it's so non-overpowering, drinkability is pretty good, except that the foam would eventually get hard to deal with."
"The taste itself is dry and complex. Every bottle I've had has been slightly different and all of them have been good. Funky as all heck at times, but never overpowering. Somewhat hoppy, but never really bitter. Great carbonation, bright. Extremely drinkable and I keep wanting more. This beer is a classic and I'll never turn it down."
"Really a fantastic beer here, and one I could drink a lot of."
"Also on a side tried to open it with the lighter trick and hit myself the lighter trick and it was so pressurized i hit myself with the cap"
"Nice trappist ale, if a bit overhyped by some. Refreshing."
"Bottle. Dark gold pour with very abundant pillowy head. Aroma is strangely tart and funky, red fruits (cherries), some herbal hay-like and brett aromas, lemon rind and so on.. Taste is rather grassy, herbal with some good bitterness with a yeasty and citrus background. Lively carbonation, full bodied and dry finish gives a distinctive mouthfeel. I didnt like it so much at first but now I'm totally addicted. If there was one beer I'd drink on a daily basis, that would be it."
"That sums up this interesting brew. Good stuff."
"Whenever I need a funky, tart Belgian fix in the future, this is where I will go. It is so enjoyably challenging to my palate and brain. I find this to be greatly drinkable and I would drink it so much more if the price tag wasn't so high. But, I expect to pay for quality, so I am not complaining."
"If you enjoy the belgian-style ales then no stock would be complete without Orval."
"Pours an orange color w/ a perfect 2 finger off-white head. This beer has a ton of carbonation! The smell is very interesting- citrus, fruit, and hops all make their presence known. The taste is an acquired taste, but I love it. It's very unique. A lot of hops, some citrus, spice and a slight hint of alcohol. Very dry finish, and a dry beer in general. Mouthfeel is good. You can feel the carbonation in your mouth, but it's not bothersome. Aftertaste lingers for a while as well. I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these at a time, but it's pretty easy to drink. Definitely a great beer, and one I will continue to buy from time to time. Not for everyone, but that's more for me..."
"M - Just under medium bodied, decent carbonation."
"D: I wish I could live on a beer like this. Perfection in a bottle for warm spring and summer days."
"Pairing this beer with some aged cheese really helps this beer and the cheese. This is a classic and one of my go to beers when in doubt. If you never had it I suggest you try it when you have the chance and admire the beautifull appearance of this wonderfull drink. Recomended."
"D - It has decent drinkability. This beer was not at all what I expected it to be. Overall, I think this is a pretty good beer, and I think it is definitely worth trying."
"D - a pretty standout beer that doesn't follow the other routes of Trappists. I'd love to shake the hands of the monks that made it"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how unique it is for not only the style, but in comparison to the vast majority of Belgian beers. The use of brettanomyces yeast makes for a wildly inviting and different aroma than one might expect from a trappist, and goes even further in the taste, to change a standard pale into something entirely distinct."
"Pours a deep orange, 2"" thick white sticky head, sticky brussels lace that was perfect, I didn't want to wash it out of the glass...one of the best I've ever seen. Smells musty, yeasty, spicy, grain, malt, brett is wonderful here. Taste is slightly hoppy, funky, yeasty and grainy, good malt backbone. Nice mouthfeel, creamy, good carbonation that at times were leaning a bit on the high side. Drinks near perfect, this is world class no doubt, such a unique brew, very near perfect."
"D: Very drinkable. Nice flavors, interesting without being odd, and a good balance of satisfying and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is dominated by the carbonation, which never seems to stop. This lends it a nice creamy texture, but also does get in the way of enjoying each individual taste, as you kind of have to cut through the foam and bubbles the entire time. It is a very pleasantly weighted beer though. Drinkability is good too, as I wouldn't have known the abv was 6.9% if I didn't check the bottle. Finish is funky, which may be off-putting to some, but I enjoyed restarting the cycle of flavors each time. Very relaxing beer - this is the beer you want while relaxing in front of the TV after work."
"Mouthfeel is light and even a bit airy. Overall, Orval is a rather unique Trappist ale and one I would like to experiment with at different ages. I have a feeling though that I would enjoy this if it were a bit younger, like 6mos to 1 year instead. Still, not bad at all though and quite a challenge for the palate to comprehend."
"drinkability; superb and tasty, easy to drink with well blended flavors and smooth alcohol."
"Poured from bottle into a heavy trappist glass. Orange color, big white head; aroma of sour fruits and floral hops; medium body, smooth, lively carbonation; flavor is also of sour fruits like apples and citrus backed up by some delicate sweet malty tones still never stealing the show, which, by the way, has a pretty dry hoppy finish. Actually, this may not be the most complex of trappist beers, but what it has to offer is in just great balance as you would expect from the brewery making only one beer to public. And mine was still very young so I would be curious to find out what good would a little aging do to this."
"Pours nice orange-gold with an excellent white head that is textbook Belgian lace. It seems no matter how long you stand this beer up, or no matter how quick you pull back on the pour, or no matter how careful you are to watch the neck of the bottle for sediment, a slight amount of cloudiness is present. The smell is just outstanding, with a full nose like a bouquet of flowers that is unlike anything that is brewed in the universe. The flavor follows the same road, with a yeasty flowery flavor that is not the slightest bit cloying, sweet, or skunky. What a great ride down the gullet, with about the perfect amount of carbonation. Since it finishes so dry and complete, it's as drinkable as it gets. What a great, great beer."
"Orval pours a nice hazy golden color with hints of orange. The head is incredibly thick and frothy, and sustains longer than most brews. The aroma from this trappist ale is subtle and citrus-y with a bready undertone (rather yeast-like). The mash of sour and spicy aroma is both impressive and pleasing, without being overpowering. The taste is equally enjoyable being fruity and well balanced. The mouthfeel starts soft and sparkling, then finishes amazingly dry. Orval combines all the best features of belgian-trappist flavors with an immaculate dry finish that makes this ale superbly drinkable."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will certainly add it to my regular rotation whenever I am able to find it. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"D: Drink ability is pretty good on this one. Its a very interesting beer that is something out of the norm when you want to stray away from your core styles. Will be coming back to this one when the weather gets better."
"ÉcouterLire phonétiquement"
"This is a slow drinking beer in order to appreciate the extremely dynamic flavors found within. Overall, this was really nice and relaxing to drink and made for a nice birthday beer."
"Overall, just great. Wow, a real difference between having this now and for the first time almost two years ago, when I had never encountered brett and was expecting a typical Belgian pale. I'm glad I held onto this bottle since then, as I think the age has done it well. Unique among the Trappist beers and very good."
"Drinkability is fine, but a one-and-done for me, and most likely not a beer I'll seek out again with regularity."
"This one was bottled in '09 and had a best-by date of 2014. Light fruity esters, kind of acidic mustiness, and a reeeeaally dry aspirin-like finish. Pretty good and really complex, but too dry for me. I'd love to try a younger bottle. I've read that the Orval master brewer prefers his at 6 months old."
"D - Whew, I don't think I could handle more than one of these guys."
"D: Great beer that's light and the alcohol is completely hidden. A treat for sure."
"D: I love Orval. It may not be for everyone, but it's pretty unique among the Trappists, and among the best Belgians, for a very good reason."
"I'll give this beer another try later to see if the flavor is more robust."
"I'm all for unique beers but the smell reminded me of walking into a doctor's office. There was a faint smell of grapefruit but I mostly smelled what others have noted - hay, horse blanket, medicinal, and as one other reviewer noted, ""stale urine."". These are not exactly welcoming smells. Just because something has an identifiable smell (like horse blanket) does not mean its pleasurable. The taste was extremely sour and tart, astringent even, and was very dry. This was not a drinkable beer for me. I'm wondering if the high scores on BA are attributable to the reputation and history of Orval. I appreciate good beer, and maybe my palate is just not as evolved as others for a beer like this, but I can't put Orval in the same class as Rochefort or Chimay."
"Amazing, pretty much. Definitely hits its peak once it warms up some. The fact that this isn't in the top 100 with nearly 1,700 reviews is slightly disturbing. The price is hindering but I will buy this as a once-in-a-while treat, and probably a couple to cellar as well."
"D: a wonderful BPA that has a great history and wonderful attributes. Its one of the easier to find trappist ales. I'll defiantly be picking this one up again."
"This is one of those perfect beers. It is all around appealing; somewhat unique and extremely drinkable. This may be the universally appealing brew."
"D - Drinkable, but not my favorite. I'd drink this when offered but would not shell out the bucks for it specifically. An enjoyable beer."
"D: Not very impressed especially for large price tag, was hoping this one would have been better"
"Drinkability for me this is a blast, but I can see others having a lot of trouble with this beer and getting past it. Also this beer is not exactly inexpensive either which is too bad cause it is flat out fantastic."
"D: I could drink it the whole night! ;-)"
"D: Paid to much and was let down by this one, I might have to revisit it. Hoping my bottle was bad. Other option is this just isn't my style."
"The mouthfeel is right in the middle of light and heavy for the style; I guess I'd say perfect. Drinkability is off the charts; great ""pale ale."""
"I will try this one out again in a year or two if/once my palate develops more around wild/brett/funky belgian style brews. but for now, while this was certainly a worthwhile taste, at the price it's not something i'll go back to until i think it's something i'd appreciate more..."
"a lot going on in this one makes it a brew to savor despite the relatively low ABV. unique and tasty, something that I may revisit on occasion."
"This is delicious and one that I wish was a bottomless glass."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Really goes down smooth. Would be my preferred Pale Ale...but it isn't as readily available as some other, quality pales."
"This might be the driest Belgian Pale Ale or Saison (whatever it is!) out there. Nothing else like it. The perfect marriage of complexity, dryness and refreshment."
"Not the best Orval I've had. But most of them aren't. Still a great beer."
"Really glad I picked this up. Bottle was 2 years old."
"nice drinkability but not great. definitely different but the carbonation issue through me off here."
"A nice, lightly sour, and decently complex pale ale, when shed of all that Trappist lore. It hides the extra ABV oh so very well, and it makes me want to order some European appies in the here and now - y'know, pommes frites, or something."
"smells herbally fruity with a little black pepper - taste of dry fruit and spice, with a hint of that black pepper - sweet and dry at once pretty complex - above average carbonation puts a prickly tingle on the front of the tongue for the first few sips - goes down pretty easy -... oh those trappists..."
"D: Super enjoyable and delicious, highly drinkable, highly recommended."
"drank it slowly due to limited quantity. i wouldn't have more than a couple of these because of that sweet/fruity flavor. rich."
"Drinkability: A very pleasant experience."
"D - Extremely easy to drink, but price and above average ABV make this one for more special occasions. Meant to be sipped slowly and enjoyed."
"Sure, I could drink a few of these, but the desire is not quite there tonight. I plan on trying this once more after having a wider range of beers in this style."
"Drinkability: Bland and boring... I'd like to try a younger version of this. This has been a real disappointment."
"Excellent beer, I can see why it's thought of as so world class."
"Excellent high quality brew. To be consumed slowly and enjoy!"
"D -- Anyone who fancies themselves a beer drinker should indulge in at least one of these in their lives and several if possible. Just amazing."
"Personally my top of the Belgian Pale Ale, it is brewed with the Belgian’s magic. Complex yet achieves the art of brewing. This is a truly unique beer."
"a bar-holder and a freak in the style and out of it. really, REALLY good."
"Cheers."
"My first Orval, unique, definitely. I can dig it and now want to try a fresher one for some comparison."
"Refreshing beer that pleasantly hits every sense in every stage. Very enjoyable beer that works well in all seasons of the year and kept me wanting more. I would hurry back to get more of this."
"I can see people being confused and put off by this beer. It can't possibly be everyones cup of tea but I sure am enjoying it. The mouthfeel is sharply tart with a fierce dry finish. A fun bubbly, baby champagne like carbonation burns your tounge and just adds to an already pleasurable experience. A perfectly odd beer that might be exactly what your looking for or the worst you ever had. Either way it's a good find and one I wish I've tried sooner."
"An enjoyable Belgian Pale Ale. Heard a lot of good things about this beer and its readily available around me but I never tried it until now. Glad I did. Another solid Belgian... and the strong/pale ale styles are really starting to grow on me thanks to beers like this."
"It tastes like it smells. It is very dry, lightly hopped, and had medium-high carbonation."
"Recommended, just like all the others who've also reviewed. It wont disappoint!"
"Excellent Trappist Ale. The best that I have ever consumed. Great taste, smell, and feel. There is so much happening in this ale that you really need to avoid pairing it with any foods the first time you drink it. The initial presentation is excellent with a strong hoppy/sweet aroma. The taste starts spicy and ends with a great fruity finish. Wonderful drink for any occasion."
"Pours a very murky, dark golden-brown (almost reddish) color with A HUGE, I mean HUGE, fluffy white head that hangs around for a long time. Scent is EXTREMELY inviting. I love the smell! Definite funk with great tart aromas. A bit of floral notes along with lemon and some other fruits. There are some delightful spices as well. Taste is initially a bit tart lemon, followed by some awesome funk and leathery notes. Then the citrus and bitterness, followed closely by the Belgian yeast and unique spice blend. This is one fantastic beer! Mouthfeel is very complex with very crisp finish. Drinkability is high! I could drink this beer every day!"
"D Similar to US Orval. 3.5"
"D: easily downed this bottle with some great cheese."
"D: What can you say, possibly the most unique of the Trappist brew. It's world class. I would say this is on my weekly roster."
"Great mouth feel its super complex and its slightly different every time but its always great."
"D- Fairly high. This is well-crafted and really peerless in the BPA category. Very nice stuff."
"D - Complex and worth taking your time with. Once you get used to the profile it's fairly drinkable."
"Glad I tried it and definitely a beer you should try at least once."
"D: Interesting brew and very complex. I'll have to buy it again to taste everything it can offer."
"Drinkability: This is such an amazing beer and the hilarious thing is the bottle to me. I sat here laughing my ass off that such a powerful, complex great beer was in such an unassuming bottle. One of my beer guys at local store said, ""you like Belgian beers and you have NOT tried Orval?!!"" He literally went to the shelf grabbed the beer and said, "" you will thank me."" He was right on, trust me, try this beer!"
"Conclusion: This is one of the most complex liquids I have ever smelled or tasted, and certainly one of my favorite beers of all time. Orval takes the meaning of beer to a new level in its own way. Everything about this beer is interesting, including the bottle, which seems to fit the beer perfectly. I wouldn't be surprised if this beer's taste differs significantly between vintages because there are so many flavors that lead me to believe that this beer has a number of microorganisms that contributed to its fermentation. Drinking this ale reminds me why I love beer in the first place- no wine ever tastes this intriguing to me."
"When I pay $4.99 for a 11.2 oz ""treat"" I expect the trifecta of different, unusual and really exceptional (as in tasty). I'm finding I can't always get the trifecta ... and it's probably due to my preferences. After drinking the Orval, I read an A+ review by Jason Alström. I read other reviews, too, and noticed one beer advocate thought he got a bad bottle. That was the first thought I had after my first mouthful. I don't like beer that has a grapefruit taste in it. I've tried extremely hoppy beers, but they aren't my thing. I think I'll keep trying new things, but I'm leaning more and more to, ""If you can see through it, you might not like it!"""
"The complexities are big Brett, mild ripe fruit, and some dry European hops. It all very dry and yet very sharp, and most of all it tastes like it's alive. This isn't like anything else I've ever had before. The feeling is like when you visit a new, majestic physical place--and maybe you've seen pictures of it before, or maybe you heard about it, but that's nothing like *being* there*, and the newness of it all makes every little part of it seem especially vibrant."
"This beer pours a nice, deep amber clear. A decent rocky head that dissipated fairly quickly with minimal lacing. The smell is of strong belgian yeasts and it make it hard to pick up much else. Definitely some citric zest. The taste is typical belgian, yeasty, bready malt and alcohol. I pick up some of the fruits, orange peel, some apple. The mouthfeel is dry and medium. A good drinker but I think there are some better options out there. Decent beer though."
"Drinkability: This is an absolutely delightful beer- definitely a new favorite and a brew that I feel completely foolish for overlooking for so long."
"The taste is a tad sharp and I've always felt this way about Orval. It has all the usual suspects for the style, coriander, clove, star anise, but it also has a very sharp orange rind tartness to it that I believe detracts somewhat. The beer is a touch smoother than what is typical for the style, and it benefits by not having that yeasted up prickly mouth feel and coarseness. For a Belgian, this one is pretty smooth. The aftertaste has a bit of the lingering orange rind tartness, but for the most part the remains are mild. This is a refreshing beer too, substantial without being full bodied, a bit of ABV without being boozy. There is a lot to like in an Orval. It's not my favorite Belgian, and not even my favorite Trappist Belgian, but it is a fine beer nonetheless."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a massive white foamy head. The nose is sweet light fruits, bready malt, faint hops. Taste is familiar to a pale ale; a very grainy taste of wheat, well rounded malt backbone. A stand out for the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth. Great tasting and ease of drinkability being high makes this a well made beer. Cheers!"
"Maybe I just got an ""old"" bottle...either way, I can't see buying this one again."
"D: A truly unique beer that I'm glad I tried but probably won't pick up too often as I like a bit more sweetness and a more slick, coating feel to Belgian Pale Ales (more akin to Duvel)."
"heaven in a glass."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beverage. IF I ever see it, I'll buy it without question."
"O: Rarely is a beer both complex and refreshing. When it does, you know you have found something special."
"Served in a traditional Belgian goblet, the beer pours to a nice golden brown-yellow color with a rather dense head. What sold me immediately about this beer was the aroma. Wow! Waves of citrus, spices, and wheaty hoppiness fill your nose, and you know at that point this is going to be a good beer. The taste is nice and complex with lemon citrus and wheat hay flavor on the front end and nice clean hop bite to finish."
"D: This is a complex beer when you want a complex beer, but if you just want a good glass of beer to keep you company while watching TV or playing a game, then this fits the bill as well. A very drinkable strong ale from those crazy Belgians."
"D: Pretty phenomenal. Seriously."
"Hides its ABV very well, would gladly session a few of these on any evening, until of course I get knocked off my chair due to the 6.9% ABV. Many nice balanced complex flavours and a nice hoppy character and smooth finish."
"D - A throughly enjoy Belgian ale"
"Drink- not my cup of tea, but a solid beer."
"This is a light bodied brew with a bursting amount of carbonation that is both visual and prickly on the tongue. It gets more enjoyable as it sits and is swirled calming the carbonation level down to an acceptable level. I dont have all that much experience with drinking this brew a lot, but I could forsee this brew being something that could be aged and really develop into something completely different from this relatively ""young"" offering. With a best by year of 2015, I wouldn't mind securing a few more bottles of this and start trying to push that best by dating to see what older bottles are like. Throughout the entire experience, I never once felt like this was a brew that was close to 7% abv. Well done."
"Dated 28/04/2010. Served at 11c."
"Pours a hazy gold with a pillowy white head. There is nice lacing throughout the glass. Aroma is of spicy hops, citrus, and leather, and begs for you to take a sip. Flavor follows the aroma, with spicy hop flavors and a backgorund of graininess. This is a very dry and hoppy beer. The dryness makes this beer a standout, and also makes it very drinkable for 6.9% abv. Had it back to back with Goose Island Matilda, which supposedly is an homage to Orval. Matilda might be a little more complex, and is definately not as dry and hoppy. I give a slight edge to Orval."
"D-okay at best. Unique for sure. Probably a good food pairing beer but not one I might go to first."
"D: If not for the unpleasant finish, the drinkability would be pretty good."
"Bottle dated 4-1-05. Pours a nice amber color with a huge pillowy off-white head. Complex and strong aroma of wild flowers, banana, orange and coriander. Initial flavor is grassy and floral. Just a tiny hint of sweetness before a huge hop bitterness finishes it off. Very dry, almost champagne-like mouth feel."
"MD- Very creamy feel.This is a sipping beer for me. For the price I don't know if I would buy this beer again, but it had to be tried once."
"D) An excellent beer but the bitter & funky-pine hops (I believe) will limit it's appeal."
"D. This is a highly quaffable beer that falls short due to the taste being on the simple side. Glad to have tried this but not something I will buy on a regular basis."
"Full thick head that quickly diminished to a thin,solid head that lasted until the last sip. Cloudy dark orange color. Faint citrus aroma. Taste was crisp, dry with no aftertaste what so ever. Not as hoppy as I had read it would be. Very refreshing taste. I enjoyed this beer with some Cotswold cheese. Match made in heaven."
"M, D- Medium/light in feel, the drinkability is good if you enjoy your brews with this degree of tartness. Probably best with a careful food pairing."
"Was craving a Belgium and picked up this one. Nice orange color with a thick head. Smells wonderful and tastes very good. Its more fruity than spicey and the alcohol is very well hiding compared to some other Belgiums Ive had. I could drink several of these at one time. A little pricey though."
"Very good beer that was tasty and enjoyable, it went down very easy on it's own and complimented my meal as well; I will seek out again."
"Poured from fancy-cool bottle into a stemmed Belgian Chinmay beer drinking vessel. Monster head with whip cream-like peaks. Nice apricot color. Strong musty-fruity-spicy smell. Wild yeast and fruit-like taste, peppery and with a little hop bitterness. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel with a slight bitter aftertaste. Excellent Belgian brew!"
"All in all a very good Belgian Pale Ale,, I would buy this again. The taste hides the high 6.9 ABV very well."
"Mouthfeel is where this one excels for me. Very, very smooth and easy to drink. Unique offering that far exceeds its copies in my opinion."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer - funky, yet amazingly well-balanced and super drinkable. I'll never refuse a pour of Orval."
"Overall I'm a bit torn on this one. I really appreciate the uniqueness of this, but I expected a bit more from a Trappist ale. It's not as complex as some of the darker Trappists, and if given at a blind tasting, I'd probably assume this to be an American take on the Wild style. I'm glad to have tried it but not sure if I'd seek it out in the future."
"Drinkability - This is a beer i have had for awhile and wanted to give it a special spot. It is well deserving of the 50th spot in my beer adventures. I will want to stock this beer and share with friends. Such a good beer!"
"This is a lot different from other trappist ales I've tried. Others were all very malty but this is much smoother, crisp and I love the brett flavor. Definitely worth a try."
"Bottled on 22/04/2010, best before 22/04/2015. Let bottle warm slightly before pouring, Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle into oversized red wine glass. Still waiting on my orval goblet. Huge off white bubbly head formed almost overflowing the glass, as I let it sit it stuck to the glass and fell slowly on the sides leaving a large head in the middle, almost like a an egg. Dark orangey brown color. Very spicy aroma. Tastes exceptional, I detect some orange. Tart and dry. Not as strong as the smell might indicate. I've been told the beer should be at its peak right now, it tastes like it could use a little more time to mellow to me. Very light on the tongue but I can feel it starting to kick in. I wouldn't be able to drink too many of these, it is more of a treat or an after dinner drink."
"Easy to drink, that's really unique for a Belgian beer."
"Orval appeals to the types who like floral beers. As in, not me. Too floral, appeareance was cloudy with nice head. Taste was Floral, deep floral,mouthfeel was good, drimkabilty was alright, restricted by price and floralnees.i tried to steal the glass but thre barowner asked where it was."
"Pours a bright orange colour with huge cloudy white head with some mild lacing. Smells of sour grape with Belgian yeast. Flavour is both a mild sourness to go with bigger sweetness. Very complex and I'm sure I'm not doing the description justice. Big carbonation level. I'm glad the Control Board in Ontario finally got this back. I already bought 6 because it was all I could carry. I hope more is at the store in the next couple days when I go back."
"Very drinkable, I could definitely enjoy one or two more of these in a sitting. Overall an exceptionally well crafted beer and possibly my favorite Belgian pale ale to date. I'll definitely be drinking it again."
"D: if it wasn't for the price and ABV i could drink this all day. best trappist ale i've had so far."
"D: This is a lovely brew. Thanks monks!"
"d - I thought this was a pretty good pale ale that was very easy to drink. I enjoyed the brett and sour fruits in the smell a lot, but wish there was more in the taste. It was definitely a step down. That being said, the taste is still above average, and I would certainly try this one again."
"As far as I am concerned this the ultimate beer experience, it is a pale ale that is both crisp and moody. as I said before there is no beverage an earth like it."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a careful pour. Massive rocky off-white head that slowly recedes and never fully fades. Lacing abundant. Smell is a hint of mustiness and bubblegum. Taste is a hint of sweetness up front, followed by a massive herbal and bubblegum flavor. finish is dry, bready, and acidic. The aftertaste is quite tart and clinging. Mouthfeel is smooth, massively high carbonation from the bottle conditioning. Drinkability is good. I was quite pleased with this beer. I had not had it in a LONG time, and never properly reviewed it. The only downside is its expensive price, which means I wont be getting it too often."
"This is a slow sipping beer, not as up beat as some the Belgians. It's pale ale with a dark and mysterious mood, if that makes sense. I think this beer would be best enjoy once you've sampled many other brands first. This is a classic badass. you just know monks made thus.. old ones."
"D- Good mouthfeel, very smooth brew, can't really taste the alcohol. I let this beer warm a little, but I think its actually better colder IMO. Although I do have to say I like it more as I drink it."
"Update: previous review was for an Orval bottled 4/09/09. Just sampled another from 4/29/09 -- with around 18 months on it, the honey faded to almost nothing and the peppery and spicy notes emerged even more. The pucker on the finish wasn't exactly stronger; it was mostly the impression of dryness that increased. All in all, I preferred the balance of flavors in the year-old Orval over the 18-month version."
"I have been more than pleasantly surprised, I have been wowed by this beer. Now I'm not in awe, I've gained a respect for trappist beer. I'm slowly going down that Belgian road."
"Hoppy flavor with a good feeling in the mouth. Taste starts out a little bitter but ends on a note heading towards spicy. Keeps the taste buds entertained. Very good."
"This is one of those beers that exudes a relaxed confidence in its status as a world-class brew. Unassuming and subtle, it's both drinkable and refined."
"Overall, a decent beer. It is fairly bretty which makes it a bit harder to drink, but the light body makes up for that. I could drink this again."
"Unique from bottle to finish, this is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"This beer poured with a very tall, foamy head that took a little time to get into the glass. The head stuck around for a bit. Very lacey on the sides of the glass. It's a golden straw, not quite clear, not quite cloudy and fairly bubbley. The smell is warm with nice flowery hops and bit of pumpkin and a soft hint of malt. The mouthfeel is slightly bitter, slightly sweet, very easy with just the right amount of carbonation and very little warmnth of alcohol, full but not thick. The taste is fantastic with bread and grain, slightly sweet, a little banana. I could easily drink a lot of this."
"found this one in a hole in the wall liquor store in PEI, a little surprised I'd never reviewed this before I've had it several times. I like the funk and would recommend this to anyone, would love to try a vertical of this beer it seams different every time I try it"
"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay glass. Appeared brilliant, a hazy copper with a frothy head that lasted through the whole time in the glass. Bubbles kept rising from the bottom to the head. Aroma was pleasant with faint hops that mesh with clove and tart citrus. Palate was wonderful, just enough thickness and carbonation for the realization of it being a beer, but smooth enough to go down easily. Most notable were the citrusy hop flavors that lent towards peppery spices, malt, and herbs. Some alcohol presence towards the finish."
"Overall: superb beer. Extremely complex, unquestionable deserves its spot as one of the best beer of the world."
"D: By the time you finish one Orval, it leaves a lingering flavor in the tatse buds that eventually transforms into a yearning for another. Good Belgian Beer!!!"
"D - Although I thoroughly enjoyed the smell and taste of this beer, the level of carbonation it just too much for me to enjoy more than one or two of these."
"edit: really became 1 of my favorites, drinkability is great, so I upped the score"
"O - I'm heading to the store tomorrow to buy at least another handful of these. Need to have some around the house for everyday drinking. Highly recommended."
"Orval pours somewhere betwwen a murky gold and a hazy orange, depending on the lighting and the amount left in the glass. One of the best heads I've ever seen on a beer rises up, 4+ fingers of a frothy, rocky white crown. Crazy head retention, and the side of the glass I'm not drinking from has gobs of lacing on it. Possibly the easiest five I've awarded. I guess this bottle is old enough for the brett to really begin asserting itself, this Orval smells like 100% brett funk. Lots of musty leather and horse blanket. It's good, but it leaves the nose to be fairly one dimensional. The flavor is a bit more diverse, and really works well. There's a brief flash of pale apple sweetness, before the realization of how bone dry the beer is and the brett crashes the party. That distinct funkiness occupies the middle of Orval, and makes up a good chunk of the flavor. Right at the end though a brisk shot of bitterness serves as an entrance cue for a subtle lemongrass finish. All in all Orval comes together spectacularly, and I much prefer this to my other experience with Orval, which was a younger, less brett-y, and in my opinion less interesting beer. As one might expect for a beer so dry on the palate, the lack or residual sugars result in a very light (but not watery) beer. Orval is highly carbonated to give the beer a certain sharpness to it, but doesn't cross the line into fizzy, a nice balancing act by the brewers. Orval is just a solid beer all around, and drinks like it's a 4.5% brew rather than nearly a 7% one. My first bottle of Orval put me off a little bit, but this one has redeemed it and more, a fantastic beer."
"D- I truley understand why this is world class ale, each sip begged for another, then i wondered why i didnt buy two. The sour notes upfront balance nicely with the brett, and funkiness which i love so much."
"pretty good. such a unique beer that you'd probably pick up a different taste, even after having 10+ of these."
"D: I would say that this is a exceptionally drinkable beer, all around great flavors, spot on for the style and still goes down easy with the amount of ABV. Highly recommended."
"D-I come back to this more than any other Trappist ale."
"D - Quite drinkable, but the complexity really makes this a sipper."
"This one was a little surprising. Hoppier than I thought it'd be."
"Overall, a really complex and refreshing trappist ale. There is so much going on here, but the assertive hop presense paired with the fruit and funk is great. Highly recommended."
"Overall: Very nice! Hoppy and wheaty with fruit subtleties. This was my second meeting with Orval after a few years. My first time, I was more-or-less new to good beer. Now, I can say I am definitely a fan!"
"Drinkability - very light and drinkable, one could easily have several of these. I would have liked to have had more of a malt presence and some more yeast as well. I was so excited to try this brew and while excellent I'm still left a little disappointed."
"Orval Trappist Ale has nice yellow-orange colour and an excellent head that lasts. It smells like a wheatbeer to me, with a hint of yeast. This is a very unusual beer and is very spicy. The most prominent flavour is cloves especially in the aftertaste. Like all trappist brews, it feels great in the mouth and is very drinkable."
"As remembered, an absurd pour. Beautiful caramel color with a nice clarity. Poured carefully into a large wine glass, the head towers above the lip of the glass into a mountainy cone. Excellent retention and lace. Pretty much hits on all marks for appearance. Aroma is balanced, complex and simple all at once. Lightly grassy and hoppy up front with a nice bread and honey maltyness and light peppery notes, all wrapped up in a bit of funk. Taste again is simple, but deep. Nice base of pale malt and a slight sweetness, akin to a good tripel, topped by a grassy hop profile and a nice dry, dusty, peppery finish. The thing that takes this beer to the next level is the mild dose of brett, that slightest funky bite that sneaks up providing an array of oddball flavors. Pretty spectacular. Nice melding of a soft trappist feel and also a hoppy, funky, quirky ale with a prickly texture. A real treat to drink, anytime. I can't wait to see what happens to this beer in a year, or two, or three..."
"This is a brew with many levels. It is easy drinking, but you have to take your time and enjoy each sip to appreciate everything that is going on. Another fantastic trappist brew."
"Despite high alcohol and lots of astringent bite, it's actually pretty easy to drink. It's a quality beer and you won't want to stop with just one."
"O - a unique and interesting dry-hopped Trappist ale."
"Very surprising. It's quite tart and sharp with a nice amount of barnyard funk that sticks around. It's got a very interesting mouthfeel, it's a bit thin/watery but the carbonation is so huge that it makes up for it - never had anything quite like this before. Overall it's quite easy drinking but given the funk it's a slow sipper."
"An accessory, not a star."
"D - This is certainly a fine brew, but the drinkability is hampered by the cost. I'm not one that could quaff this all night even if cost was not a factor, as the spiciness would prohibit it. Certainly worth a try...this is a perfect example of the style."
"This would be a great meal beer as I imagine the pairings are probably quite limitless."
"O- Im not completely sure how i feel about this beer, it was very interesting though and I'd like to explore the style further."
"World class brew, wish it wasn't so expensive."
"Pours yellow-gold with a nice white head and a good deal of lacing. Initial whiff is earthy funk, hay, green apples, and lemon rind. Slightly hoppy. Taste brings the funk forward really well; nice balance with the hops. Mouthfeel is dry and well carbonated. Very nice and dry finish with a bit of bitterness. Overall, a really fantastic beer."
"Drinkability - I love this beer and could drink it almost any time."
"Great taste, lighter body, if you don't mind the dry-mouth (and the price), you could drink this all night."
"Verdict: An absolutely heavenly beer (literally!)"
"Big rocky white head. A cloudy golden color that I can still see through until I stir up the sediment and add it to the glass. The aroma is amazing. Spices, yeast, apple, lemon and a nice floral scent. The flavor has lemon peel with a touch of lemon pith, sweet, spicy while equally tart and bitter. Incredibly complex with various flavors becoming more pronounced as the beer warms. A thoroughly exceptional and enjoyable beer."
"D: I don't see myself drinking 6 at a time, but if I want to chill and have a Trappist, this would be it."
"If only this one was cheaper!"
"Just an amazing beer."
"Overall this beer is quite refreshing and dry with a wonderful complexity. The flavors of this ale are very unique and some of them are hard for me to place, however very enjoyable."
"Overall it's the standard if you're looking to showoff brettanomyces' potential in its rawest form. It's tough to find another beer similar, so it has a great originality to it and is great fun to drink. I can't wait to try the newest batch of Sanctification and see if Vinnie got a lot closer to Orval like he has openly said he wanted to with the new batch."
"D- A tasty beer and very drinkable. The alcohol content seemed to weigh pretty solidly for a 6.9% beer, but as light as it is in the body and as tasty as it is, it surely is a drinkable brew."
"D - Hell yes."
"Drink - Wow, one of the better beers I have ever had. I picked this one up without knowing anything about it, and apparently other BA's agree with me that it is really good. A fantastic beer that is a must try for all the beer lovers out there."
"Those with a patient palate will find that this beer offers a level of enjoyment few others can match. For me, it's so good it borders on ridiculous. There's really nothing to fault within this beer. Impeccable, simply incomparable. Highly recommended."
"D - one of the beers that really opened my eyes to what yeast is capable of. truly unique and one of my favorites to pair a light but flavorful breakfast with."
"Pours a murky, golden brown with some shades of plum and orange around the edges. Fantastic billowing head, soapy and sudsy with fat chunks of lace and supreme retention. Aroma is sweet, getting some light fruity notes (some plum) and a very, dry vinous feel to it as well. Taste is fairly similar, I'm getting a very dry vinous feel to it (although very, very muted in the vinous sense) with some relatively darker stone fruits (again, plum primarily) and some raisin as well. Still maintains a bit of sweetness amongst the dry nature of this. Slightest hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is relatively watery, drying. Good drinkability, but not something I'd reach for on a regular basis. A definite sipper. Very muted, simple and subtle in all aspects."
"Not knock your socks off in flavor or complexity, but a humble and subtle brew that is still outstanding. Very well-balanced, very drinkable, and very tasty."
"Atmosphere is great. Really great appearance with a rich, pure hue and a nice primary head which settles into a great secondary head that remains throughout. Nose is a great combination of grain, sweet, and spice components. Flavor is hearty and pure with a great balance. The sweet notes don't come out so much in the flavor making for a nice dynamic. The sweet notes tease the nose, but don't distract or cloy in the palette. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"D - Very drinkable: I don't want this beer to end! But, alas, it does, and I am left wanting more! I'll be sure to revisit this one in the future."
"I like this beer but at $4.99 it will be a nice treat."
"Notes: Quite the classic. Quite balanced and subtle on this incarnation, a classic reference not only for Trappist offerings but for Brett tasting. The least unexpected of Trappist ales, which always reminds that it is a denomination and not a style."
"This is a very interesting beer. It may not be my favorite trappist, but it's worth respect."
"The beer has decent body, but the carbonation is a little out of control. This doesn't need to sparkle so much - other trappists with the same sparkling carb have a better overall feel. This is just a bit distracting. I like Orval and it is a classic, but I like more modern BPA's more without the wild edge. I would and will drink this again."
"There's nothing exciting about it, and this has to be the only complaint. Surely, though, we don't want a Pale Belgian to be doing too much radically, so this hardly matters. 6.9 abv is precisely what it needs to be for you not to taste it and then to feel it nicely."
"Drinkability: Simply delicious, and can only fully be appreciated slowly. Although it takes me a while to finish this one, its only because I don't want it to be gone."
"Highly drinkable, and I would love many more of these. For $5 and change, this is a go to beer."
"D: One of the top beers, could drink daily."
"D: Style benchmark, and this is a very good beer, but overall not an everyday belgian pale."
"Bottled on 7/29/09, best by 7/29/14"
"D-Really nice beer with good drinkability."
"With all due respect the the other reviewer that compares this beer to Goose Island's Matilda, I completely disagree. I was anxious to try Matilda and recently purchased a four pack. I found the beer to be very bitter and nearly undrinkable. The other 3 bottles will sit in my fridge. Orval is a far superior and very different beer."
"D - This is really, really good. As someone who is a big fan of the funk this matches up perfectly with the pale ale."
"I'm not a big fan. It smells delicious, but it needs more sweetness and less bitterness to balance the tartness of the Brett, no fusels, less carbonation and more body. At $5.99 for a wimpy bottle, skip this and get some De Proef, De Dolle, Duchesse, Rodenbach, or Zoetzuur."
"poured into a tulip glass, the appearance is cloudy dark amber color, with a mountain of off-white head that reaches above the rim. looks great. the smell is somewhat fruity, tart. the taste is heavy on yeast, a little funky, and finishes extremely dry. I'm not really a huge fan of the flavor. body is somewhat thin and carbonation is high. not hard to drink, but probably won't seek out again. ."
"Notes: I enjoyed this one quite a bit but its not as good as I remember it being when I tried it a year ago. Stil a very good beer and I'll still try it again from time to time. The price tag makes it hard to go back to regularly for me though."
"D: Good, but not really my bag. I get why it is popular, and appreciate the style, but I think I would stick to the other trappist styles. This seems like an odd combo of funk, and a regular pale ale, and I can't get too into it."
"I've had this several times before and will definitely have it again."
"Notes: Really complex, unusual flavors but not in your face. A classic."
"Notes: Never seems to disappoint. A tasty beer. Really want to try the Petite Orval!"
"D: A good Belgian for all tastes. Uncommon at most bars, so when you find a place that has it, definitely try it out."
"The beer pours a brownish orange color. There is some head retention, but almost no lacing to speak of. On the nose I get very little, maybe a hint of lemon... not really sure. There just isn't much there. On the palate the beer is very tart and very dry at the same time. I guess this beer is trying to be some type of Belgium pale ale, but it really doesn't work for me. The beer tastes fairly light for a Belgium, and I guess with the abv. you could probably drink a few of these, were price not an obstacle. The mouthfeel is OK, and the beer comes across as fairly refreshing. The finish is rather short and crisp, but there are no off flavors."
"D: Very drinkable, but a tad expensive. I would love to drink a few of these with a good book."
"Overall I think it's a good beer but I'd stop far short of calling it fantastic. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and there's not much malt body to the taste."
"Magnificent effort, a subdued aroma meets a crushing flavor, and grand all around. Easy to pop down a few of these...if you can afford it!"
"D - Overall good appearance and enticing smell but flavor left something to be desired average but not worth premium Belgian prices. Wondering if mine was too young or too old."
"This beer is such a pleasure to take relaxed and slowly, but it's gone in the blink of an eye. The Orval Ale is perhaps my new favorite beer and one that I could drink every day for the rest of my life and be happy."
"A great brew, certainly drier and more subtle than the other Trappists, but very drinkable. Glad to have finally tried it."
"D: This beer is finding its way into my stomach rather quickly, fantastic drinkability. Everything about the beer was spot on for its style. Light, yet complex. Crisp and refreshing, with a bit of Brett funk. Perfect balance."
"Drinkability - Very very refreshing for a Belgian. If it didn't cost $5 for 11 oz, I could drink this stuff regularly. The ABV is pretty low for a trappist as well, which helps with downing it. So with price factored in, I don't find it drinkable, but if price doesn't matter for you, give this one a try for sure!"
"The famous Orval! I've had t his a few times and never really took the time to appreciate it. I would have liked more hops but this has just the right amount of balance. Delicious!"
"-notes from '07"
"This beer blew me away. A golden amber color with tight white head and little lacing. The smell is amazing: a bit medicinal, fruity lemon, granny smith apples and toasted bread, extremely complex. The taste is a bit drier with wet stones, tart apples and some hop bitterness. This is an exceptional beer."
"Served in a Chimay chalice. The beer pours up with a huge head that lasts a considerable time. Appearance is off the scale. Nice reddish color. A complex taste. Very different from other Trappist ales. A bit astringent but nice. This one grows on you and leaves you wanting another."
"I've been getting sick of overly sugared Belgians ales as of late and this beer is the perfect antidote. A great balance between flavors and so easy to drink. A flat-out masterpiece!"
"imo one of the best blond trappist beers out there"
"Notes: This is my first time trying this brew. It is a perfect beer; they do exist and this is one. But then again, when you have had as much time through history to discover the secrets of beer as these monks have, heavenly perfection is something you strive for; and in this case, obtained."
"In saying that, I'm not really that impressed by all the combinations. It's good, I would buy it again, but not one of the world's greatest beers, as some reviews might lead you to think."
"D: Off the charts. This is simply a great beer that goes down very easy while at the same time remaining intensely complex. I will be stocking up on a lot more of this one. Truly a world class beer, and my absolute favorite Trappist Ale by far."
"I love this beer, though I can see that there will be many who do not (my mother took one sip and was nearly sick...), but I think it's certainly a beer everyone should try at least once."
"Very good Belgian Ale. Has the distinct charateristics you are looking for in a Belgian. Warning: Very thick head, so pour slowly. This is one of the beers that is always in my fridge, and one of the few I don't have to check myself due to the alcohol content."
"D: An incredibly tasty beer. It's a shame this took me two tries to appreciate, but it's a good demonstration of how quickly a palate can evolve in 8 or 9 months. I have a bone to pick with the metallic flavor I get out of this thing, but otherwise I really enjoy it. Outstanding beer."
"Always love this, I like this beer to warm a little while drinking for sure, but but also think that it benefits from a colder temperature in the beginning. Love this monkfood fresh and aged, this one's sort of middle of the road because it's sort of in between the best ages."
"jd"
"D - This one is pretty good. I was expecting a bit more based on the rave reviews. Very drinkable and extremely tasty. Was pretty surprised by the bitterness, but really enjoyed this brew. Glad I tried it, not sure if I'll be looking for it on a regular basis though."
"D - Like a fine wine - sorry for the wine comparison on a beer thread - to be enjoyed in moderation."
"D: Not the greatest aftertaste on this one, although I really like the nose. I'm glad I got to try it, but I probably won't seek this out again. The flavors are very complex and good, but there are other beers I'd rather drink."
"D: Not something i would want to drink more than one of at a time but it is quite unique and enjoyable."
"Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. If it weren't so damnably expensive on this side of the Atlantic ($5.79 for an 11.2oz bottle), it would make regular appearances in my fridge; as it is, it's a delicious treat. It can easily be consumed in great quantity. For those of you who can afford it, Orval would make a great Summer beer. For those of you looking to break into the wide world of Belgian ales, this would be a good starting point because its flavors are fairly easy to pick out without being overwhelmed by the complexity and richness of the brew."
"d - great sipper and a classic BPA."
"D: Under 7%, but it felt like significantly more. So complicated as to be a sipping brew, so unique as to be desirable only every once in a while."
"The golden amber beer poured nicely into a small belgian stong beer glass. Nice white head that left lace as the glass was imbibed. There is nothing really like Orval. The fruit smells are nicely paired with the hop content. I let this one reach optimum temp. before drinking and it paid off. The flavors really compliment each other at the warmer end of the drinking temp. rec's. The mouthfeel on this is quite possibly the best I have ever imbibed. While I may personally prefer the more ""standard"" expectations of a Trappist bier; Orval is there to remind us that Trappist is a logo, not a style."
"Wow, can't believe this is my first Orval. What was I thinking? This is superb! Pours a massive head, this beer has a beautiful reddish hue. Aroma is distinctly fruity, pear and apple are evident and this is also true in the taste. This is a beautifully balanced beer with sufficient bitterness to offset the great savory flavors--something that I appreciate greatly. It also really has its own footprint, I've tasted nothing else exactly like this. The mouthfeel? What can you say, I want to swirl this around for a while. This beer is just plain decadent."
"Hazed, orange amber with tiny jets of bubbles risng to the surface. Big airy eggshell head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Nice brett and funky horsey yeast aroma with cherries and pear. Wow, where to start..citrus and cloves with white fruit and champagne. Forest floor qualities are solidly in the background. A very complex beer that clearly evolves over time as it seems different every time I enjoy one. I personally like it about where it is, around six months old. On the lighter side of medium bodied with seltzery carbonation. One of a kind for sure."
"Bottle pours a dark amber colour with an insane amount of foam and loads of bubbles floating up under the foam. Took 10 minutes to finish pouring this, using the duvel tulip glass. The taste is of bready, yeasty malts with dark fruits lingering in the finish. Its not a bad beer overall and it disappeared pretty quick."
"Mouthfeel is equally disappointing. Feels like water. Blah... I don't really want another."
"This is my fourth Orval. The first two times I had it, my palate wasn't quite 'there' yet. The third one tasted pretty good but tonight...this one was great!"
"Fairly light body with very active carbonation. I can certainly see Orval being an acquired taste, and probably wouldn't have liked it two years ago when I was first exploring new beers. Probably not something I'll be chasing after very frequently, but it's nice to know that it's always on the shelves."
"Notes: On 2011-06-17 I had this side-by-side with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. It was fun to compare and contrast these two fine beers. For a day-to-day brew, I'd prefer the SNPA."
"A lovely brew all around. Great yeast and spicy notes; and the Brett pairs quite nicely with the brighter acidic and fruity notes."
"This is my favorit Trapist beer to date; it, in my view is better than Chimey- but very different. Having triied in Chinese ""cafe"" for $4 out of a wine glass, of which I spent a few miniuites trying to explane why I wonted a glass and particularly that glass, It is by far one of the best beers I have triied. I wont lie, the Chinese air killed my nose and so I can just tell by every thing else that the beer smelled like heaven. The taste was very different, very oylde fashined and very not sweat and not bitter. It was light and crispy but also heavy and wonderful. I could sit and drink these for years."
"D- Really a great brew; the history behind the beer only makes it more interesting. Truly a great beer to try."
"D: This brew is incredibly delicious and has a great texture. Complex and satisfying, but clean and refreshing too. If I had to drink only one beer for the rest of my life I could be completely satisfied having one of these every day."
"D: very is about all i can say"
"The pop of the cap let out a rather loud hiss. This baby is highly carbonated, and poured gently into my chalice. The head is white and rocky with an assortment of bubbles small and large. The inside of the glass has beautiful lacing. Lacing that is only present due to the imbibing and not the fading of the head. The body of the ale is a beautiful copper and gold. My nose is being filled with floral hops, lemon, dark fruit and a yeasty warm bread. The high amount of carbonation tickles my nasal cavity and leaves me smelling lemon and flowers. The first sip is non aggressive and dry. The body is thin and inviting. Very low bitterness meets biscuit and dark fruit. Champagne like body and mouthfeel pave the way for this complex ale. Dry from start to finish. Orval has a very floral aftertaste with a dry fruit balance. In winter cold or summer sun this ale will fit the bill."
"The drinkability is above average. The alcohol is nicely hidden by the funkiness of this beer but the peppery spiciness is a bit much for me. I would also like a little less of the herbal/floral character in the flavor profile. With that being said, this is still a very good representation of the style."
"Slightly orangish in color, and slightly opaque. Big foamy head. Get aroma of spices, something that I wouldn't usually expect from this type of beer. Spices are also evident in the taste,as well as some fruitiness. Lacks the caramel taste of other trappistes. Has some hopiness that the others don't. It may be different from some of the other trappistes, but this is still an excellent brew. I'd definitely pay another $5 for a bottle."
"Drinkability: Perfect drinkability. It has undeniable potential as it ages achieving a wide range of profiles that will no doubt cover the quirkiest of tastes. You can't deny it's unique, interesting and complex yet accessible, PLUS it goes great with alot of different foods. This, in my mind, is what drinkability is about. Solid five."
"This had a pretty good mouthfeel, but was a little undercarbonated (given the huge head)."
"Definitely world class."
"Pours a beautiful dark golden to light amber with enormous white head that remains long, and laces well. Nose has the traditional barnyard/brett, but a lighter and more approachable take on that. Some ripe apples and candied nuts are noted as well. On the palate the wild flavors come through as well, with some suggestions of black tea, and a musty/musky old wood chest in the attic sort of flavor. Finish is musty as well."
"moutfeel is thin and light, the higher carbonation levels stops it from being watery.very refreshing. i could drink this all day."
"D-insanely drinkable, all sorts of things going on working in harmony, world class beer!"
"This beer is a delight. The aroma is very earthy and evokes a drive through the countryside. You inhale the hops from the dry hopping greedily as it blends beautifully with the bouquet the yeast imparts. The color is a light sunset and the beer is slightly cloudy, with a good foamy head. The taste is slightly acidic, with invigorating hop notes that work as well with the spice of the yeast in taste as they do in the aroma--a beautiful marriage. Orval finishes dry as you bring the glass up to your mouth for another sip. It's been said before, I think by Randy Mosher, but this...this is beer."
"Again, this brew is complex as hell and has a very refreshing quality to it thanks to the mouthfeel. However i am not sure that I really enjoyed the barnyard/hay/funky taste. It was sort of off putting. Honestly this just wasn't my thing. I had to force myself to finish the bottle."
"The taste was was very light all things considering. A very well balanced beer. It had a wonderful taste of yeastiness and citrus. I found it to be extremely refreshing and quite drinkable. Quite complex in terms of balance. I haven't had a lot of Trappists so I am unable to compare it to anything at the moment. But it's a style that I will be trying more of in the future."
"Wonderful looking beer with a massive head and lacing and citrus sunburst color.A light and lemony aroma, with a bright straw character on the pallete, light crisp fruits like pear,apple. The souring from the Brett is very slight and mild. thinner and crisper mouthfeel, with a tight champaign like carbination, and a refreshing dry finish."
"Feel is super bubbly and full of carbonation. Very light and lively at the same time. Good drinkability right here, just wish I had some more to enjoy."
"Very drinkable trappist with alot of unique flavors that can be detected after the tempature warms."
"Drinkability - Relatively drinkable. This reminds me of a mix of delirium tremens and a really funk saison. An interesting beer and am glad to finally try it. Not in my top beer list but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Overall this is a beautiful beer with a good taste and smell, but the mouthfeel killed some part of it for me. It was hard drinking it at times when it felt like there was no carbonation. Maybe it was just the bottle I had, but I did get this beer from Hi Times Wines Cellar so I doubt quality control was the issue. I guess I will just have to revisit this beer some time."
"Very very nice interesting beer and something that I will DEFINITELY be drinking again soon."
"Drinkability - I wish I had a dozen of these. Not too thick, but not too bitter."
"This beer is really interesting. I'd love to get this again for food pairing or age variations. I'm sure my review would be different each time I had it."
"e"
"D: very complex flavor profile that seemingly shifts throughout, definitely looking forward to aging a few of these and going back after a few fresh bottles"
"Wow, this is probably one of the easiest brett-forward beers to drink you could ever find. Sharp hops along with the brett provide a very dry, crisp and damn refreshing beer. Citrusy lemon flavors along with a spritzy carbonation accentuate the effect. Malts are there, lightly honeyed, but the main show is the brettomyces and solid hops. It has been a few years since my last Orval and like an old friend, I cant believe how much I missed it. I could drink this all summer long, but the price point is preventative of that. A very delicious beer and I cannot wait to taste the other couple in the cellar with some more brett coming to the forefront as time passes."
"Brewing Information: Malts are: pale malt beers: as Beauce, Gratinais, Unterfranken and Prisma and caramel malt, Cara Vienne and hop varieties are Hallertau-Herzbrucker from Bavaria and Styria, Golding from Slovenia, and the Dry-hopping one uses Golding from East Kent UK The sugar is kind of candy. Brother / Brother: Lode is brewing manager, Jean-Marie Rock-Maitre Brasseur. His predecessor was Roger Schoonjans. For his great salvation in one hop bitterness searches, 700 to 750g. per hectolitre production and another for the dry-hopping 360gr each brew is 106 hl and they use 350kgr.kandijsuiker. The dry hops remain three weeks in lager beer. It used Orval 5.2% but its fermentation, he sometimes up 6.9% on the new label, therefore 6.2% and 6.9% for severe Americas. Tests have shown that the brewery in a Orval up to 7.2% alc. Vol can go. There is a wild yeast found in Orval that we encounter in the lambic yeast Brettanomyces the fact that a wild yeast. They also have a canteen beer for home consumption that is called green Orval and has 3.5% alc. vol. Orval is 0.08% residual sugar and some sweet beers go up 3% Acid pure old lambic has even less ie 0.02%"
"Meh."
"If you've never tried this beer, GO GET ONE and watch your life become significantly better."
"So for those who aren't aware this is quite a complex brew. The above represents my second attempt to review although it may not be my last. For some reason I keep coming back to this beer and as such have reflected that in my ratings."
"very drinkable and very true to style, but i'd prefer a dubble or trippel over the pales. certainly worth seeking out, but given it's high import price, i probably won't be buying too many of these."
"Overall impression-- I can see how many American versions attempt to recreate this particular beer. This is arguably the measuring bar by which the style is judged. As well it should be. Those monks know their stuff!"
"For a beer this complex it is still refreshing and begs another, and another and another still. I wish I had bought more. Strike that...I WILL buy more."
"Orval has become one of my absolute favorite beers. The Aroma and flavor are distinct and fantastic. The brett character is perfect. Slight mustiness. Nice lemony zing. Bright, crisp, dangerously drinkable. Puffy white head, a constant stream of bubbles from the center of a Duvel tulip. Beatiful beer. Legendary. One of the best beers on the face of the earth. I can't really think of anything to say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Seek out. Worth every penny."
"D: It's unique, tasty, and a beer to sniff, sip, and savor. A must try for any beer aficionado."
"I'm definitely stocking up on these next time I'm in Montreal. I could drink this stuff all the time. I really like how this is a little lighter than most other world-class Belgians; at 6.9% you could have a few at a time. It seems to pack the flavour of a much bigger beer into it's relatively low ABV. I'm glad I spent some time working up to this one, I feel like I can appreciate this beer now whereas a year-or-so ago I'm not sure I would have ""got"" it. Possibly an acquired taste but this beer is amazing."
"A very ejoyable Belgian Pale Ale that I'll definitely have again. It's very flavorful and has a complex variety."
"Drinkability: I have to give this beer top marks. I've seen it on the shelf before, but I've always passed it by. I can safely say that that is a mistake I will not make again. This beer is fantastic, packing some immense flavor in a sessionable package. Coming close to 7% ABV, I don't think I could pack away too many in an evening, but I'd certainly give it a good shot. Definitely recommend."
"M: Light, almost no body, wish it were a little more full bodied"
"fun to drink, lots of complex flavor. i think i drank this too early. i can only imagine what this may turn into in 4 years or so."
"D - The drinkability is sublime - stellar, inspirational brew - I have a lot of respect for the method and humble brilliance the monks exude in the style w/ plentle of subtlety and nuance, yet vibrant, intense flavor. The experience is a wonderful taste, words truly can't express it -something I wish I had on hand all the time"
"Drinkability - A wonderful experience. Easy to drink, yet bursting with flavors. I will definitely be turning to this beer again and again... and again."
"It rarely disappoints although three is usually enough for a sitting. I am looking forward to those bottles I have put down."
"Drinkability - Every element of the flavor and mouthfeel compliment one another. Dry, musty, tart, prickly, spicy: it all adds up to a refreshing and satisfying beer. Truly an original."
"Drinkability: This and Duvel are by far the best Belgian Ales that fall on the paler side of the spectrum. Orval is a true original - refreshing and complex."
"D- Low abv, clean and crisp finish and not too heavy of a body makes this a really drinkable Trappist beer."
"Drinkability (3.5): Refreshing but heavy."
"D: I was happy with this beer but it did not totally impress me and I was looking for some more complexity but very drinkable and I would try this again and age some also."
"So much more to the beer than what I have written but one of the best if not the best I have ever had."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this, and like the style overall, and it's one that is just so dry I can only put down one. Granted, I enjoy it thoroughly, but I can understand those that don't like this."
"overall I love funky beers so this was good. Just wish it could be a little better."
"A great trappist, though not quite what I was expecting. Get you one!"
"Quite good at 57 months old."
"Overall, awesome Belgian Pale Ale! One of the classics."
"D: Orval's drinkability is low based on it's mouthfeel alone. The aroma and taste are very good, but I can't see myself having more than one of these in a sitting."
"D: Great beer for a summer afternoon. Don't know how many of these I could drink back to back."
"I love Orval. This bottle is just about a year and a half old and I really think the brett has come forward beautifully in both aroma and taste. Gonna crack another one at the two year mark and see what we got..."
"Definitely a nice beer, although a bit more hops flavor than I prefer. They floral taste of the hops actually made it nicer to drink than other beers that are high on the hops. No doubt this is a Belgian ale, has that Belgian character I really enjoy in a beer."
"A huge 3 fingers of pillowy white foam crowns this cloudy orange brew. The smells I'm getting are cider and raisin and who knows what else. It's interesting though. Wow, the flavor covers a huge range. Let's see what I can tease out. A big dry, sour wave carries apple hay and must. That sour/bitter taste sticks around. It is still well carbonated and refreshingly crisp though I believe this style is not for me. I'll leave more for the rest of you guys."
"D: Good. Not quaffable -- the sourness that lingers on the palate slows you down a bit -- but light and certainly flavorful."
"Notes: Bottled on 06/10/2009. Very interesting beer that is completely different from the other Trappist beers. Definitely had a funky Brett taste, I was just hoping for a bit more fruity taste to go with it. Not a bad beer, but i might get some getting used to. I did start liking it better the more I drank it."
"Wow! This one is peculiar."
"Medium light body. Complex and very drinkable. A top shelf brew."
"Very drinkable. A superb beer. The first time I had it... totally hated it. That was almost a year ago. Glad I tried it again. A seriously world class beer."
"D - An excellent overall beer, but I think it is this beers weakest aspect. Flavors are intense and very good, but tends more towards a sipper for me. Always glad to revisit this one, though I don't do it often enough. Excellent beer - one bottle in a sitting is perfect for me though."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very smooth refreshing beer, not too strong from the alcohol. How can you not love a beer brewed by monks?"
"D- Very easy to drink, the only thing that would stop me from drinking more is the price and a desire for a stronger tasting beer."
"D: It's easy to drink and rather refreshing, which is surprising for the level of complexity in the taste."
"D wonderful beer, extremely drinkable, the alcohol, with all the flavors and smells is almost undetectable"
"It took me a long time to learn to appreciate this ale, the first several bottles I had, I assumed were ""off"" somehow. The dry, slightly bitter, slightly funky, not quite sour flavor was not at all what I expected from a Trappist brewery (as if they were all the same). Considering the integrity and longevity of this product, I think the deficiency was likely with my palate rather than with Orval - but I still can't help but knock some points off the drinkability scale none the less."
"D- I feel like if I had the privilege of more than one of these, they could all disappear very quickly if it were not for wanting to savor them."
"D: Extremely refreshing, with complexity to keep every sip interesting and balance to prevent any one flavor from becoming overwhelming."
"D- Great refreshing beer, dry finish that leaves you wanting more."
"It poured a cloudy orange gold hue. It smelled like sour, tart apples, and yeast. It tasted sweet, overripe grape, sour apple, a hint of spice but left the tongue tart and dry. I actually preferred the smell better to the taste. The taste was a bit light, but I guess it is just a pale ale. I thought it was have more umph for 6.3%- guess not. It just wasn't my favorite. I don't see myself buying anymore anytime soon."
"Overall: Highly complex, lively, dry, very refreshing ale. The tartness isn't outright sour and the many flavors are exceptionally well balanced. I can see wanting to have some of these around at all times. This bottle is about a year old and the emphasis is really the dry fruity acidity and firm bitterness."
"Overall, will have to try this one fresh as I did not care for this too much."
"Drinkability: The beer was very drinkable and extremely refreshing. I really loved it and think it would be wonderful in the summer time."
"Looking forward to trying some other Trappist beers to see how they compare. For now I'm thinking some Lost Abbey with its low carbonation might be my next purchase."
"For a Trappist ale, quite drinkable. It wouldn't be hard to put a few of these away if they were cheaper."
"D: Exceptional drink. Light enough to finish a few in an evening, but a little too pricey to do so on my budget."
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable with a crisp dryness that leaves you wanting a next sip, overall a very nice beer one I would be intrigued to try with some time, overall a very unique complex beer with plenty of hops and that signature belgian funk, not the best trappist I have had but certainly good"
"A very crisp and dry mouthfeell."
"Aged approximately 1.5 years."
"This is a positive review of Orval from someone who really isnt a huge fan of Trappists to begin with. Orval is understated and refined. Certainly not something I want all the time, but enjoyable none the less."
"Overall, this lives up to the hype, and it's a great way to cap off my spring break. I'm raising my glass to all of my fellow collegiates who have consumed a huge quantity of terrible beer this week."
"Overall Impression: It's been a while since I had this beer. In fact, I had not developed an appreciation for Belgian's back then. I was not expecting much from this one; OH My ME was I wrong!!! This is what Begian beer is all about people!!! I see myself drinking this one very often. In fact, I may have to go get more this evening."
"Orval is one of my favorite beers. Unique, one-off flavor that is unmatched. A true trappist that blows the top off of the traditional Belgian style. Worth the Money."
"Overall, this is a classic and truley unique beer. I must try."
"D - This thing is highly drinkable. Great tasting and not overpowering with alcohol."
"My gf said it ""reminds me of Cuvee Renee, but not quite"""
"falls delightfully into my glass like a perfumed fat kid into a pit of balls, spewing forth odors and kicking balls up from the deep in a futile effort to right himself. the carbonation continues to flow up, bringing the smells. the sharpness of lemon, a little funk, a touch of malty sweetness, a twinge of earthy hops. the flavor profile is similar, a bit sharp and bitter, and delectable, but it feels a bit overcarbonated in my glass. i wait to let it warm up but some asshole finishes my glass so we can taste some homebrew. what a hard life."
"The successful combination of fresh and funk, new and old, depth and pizazz make this one complex brew. Orval may only produce one beer, but when that one beer is as good as this, why produce anything else?"
"D: not bad, but not my favorite trappist"
"On mouthfeel, maybe could use a bit more creaminess to it. Decent body for the style though. Far more drinkable than before, a quite delicious brew, actually. I'm glad I tried it again."
"Mouthfeel is light, ""airy"" and delicate, the carbonation is ""fluffy"" on the tongue and is slow to dissipate. Some people have put the body on the medium side but I think it runs closer to the heavier side of light, not quite medium. Drinkability is good, I dig the bitterness factor as I'm not used to getting that very often in a Belgian ale."
"D - Complex and flavorful yet fairly light. This would be perfect on a spring day."
"In the end I'm not really sure what to think. This is obviously a beer with a lot going on and one that a lot of effort has gone into. In the world of beer I would classify this as a pretty unique experience... but still I'm not sure there's anything to bring me back to it. Still, its certainly worth a try for any beer lover."
"Overall the beer looks and smells fantastic. It falls way short on flavor and drinkibilty."
"That makes the review as it is. I see and smell a good beer, the rest is average which is not good enough when you are an abbey product."
"Orval comes in a unique, vase-like brown bottle. It's unusual, but a pleasing shape nonetheless. Orval also has venerable historic origins -- I mean the monastary dates back to the Merovingian period (1100's)."
"The taste is also very complex and totally unique. Hints of lemon, vanilla, black pepper, apples, anise, and oak. It's sweet, spicy and sour all at once. Nice dry, bitter hop finish. A bit flat tasting but it's been my experience having drank several aged Belgians that most of them do taste flat. Alcohol is more evident than in the non-aged Orval but still well hidden. Truly one of the great beers of the world. Makes me realize how fortunate I am to have easy access to all I can drink!"
"Great mouthfeel, not too light for the style. Everything about this beer comes together very well. My only complaint is the price, but that's not a factor in this review."
"Drinkability - I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Overall, pretty different than most of the trappists but I like it pretty well."
"Slainte!"
"This starts mildly sweet, then you get a punch of hoppiness that I wasn't expecting, and then sweet again. I love the amount of carbonation too. Very drinkable and enjoyable!"
"Note: the bottle I drank was dated January, 2006 (4 years old)."
"The f"
"D - Could easily drink several at a sitting."
"D - Might be impacted by high carbonation but other than that very drinkable and pleasant."
"A pretty easy drinker for the most part. I feel as though it would be easy to sit down and drink 4 or 5. You will enjoy this beer better at a warmer temperature!"
"Pours a nice cloudy amber orange with dense, white rocky head that has some of the best retention i have ever seen. Smell is wonderfully funky, touches of doughy bread, faint citrus and candi sugar. Taste is mild in relation to the scent. Doughy bread throughout backed by touches of funk, lemon, juniper and sugar. Tastes its best as close to room temperature as possible. Medium bodied, dry and fully carbonated to begin, but feels somewhat thin and watery as the glass sits. A very nice beer with many extraordinary qualities, but lacks a little in assertiveness and body."
"Overall, the Orval is superbly drinkable, and only the price could stop me from consuming several in a night."
"Has a wonderful mouthfeel and amazing drinkability."
"Orval the bowling pin shaped bottled beer. Poured down the middle of a tulip glass and whoa did I get some head on this beer. Thick creamy awesome looking head, some real eye candy. The aroma is pleasant Belgian yeast smell. At first your taste buds are stimulated by the sweet yeast notes of this beer then it finishes long with a dry charred note. This is a beer you want to take your time with and savor not reccomended as a session beer. Relax and enjoy a fine trappist ale."
"Poured into a tulip glass the beer was a beautiful clear orange blonde color with noticeable effervescence. Nice off white head that dissipated quickly with no lacing. Slight hop aroma on the nose but that was about all I got. On first taste I got, beer, decent beer, but nothing near the complexities others have talked about. The beer wasn't, bad, just not as good as I was expecting. Maybe a product of over hyping? Don't get me wrong if someone offered me one I would drink it happily but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I've had other trappist beers that were better."
"Overall- amazing when fresh. tartness is great. beers like this inspire my home brewing."
"D-very drinkable and absolute pleasure to drink its dry finish makes the beer rather refreshing"
"D: drinks like silk, would love to have another this was the first time i have had this brew and i am going to pick up another bottle, the cost makes this a sipper but, could drink quite a few in one session. this is a great beer that would go well with many foods and could be a staple at the table. this is a great beer."
"A really great beer, so many subtle layers. Truly unique and a really fantastic beer."
"Mouthfeel - Light body, very dry with carbonation that fits just perfect."
"Pours a nice hazy copper with wonderful pillowy head. Lemongrass and flowers in the aroma. I am also getting a hint of clove and mint. Very clean taste with wonderful lemon zest and spicy yeast notes. Perhaps some black pepper in there as well, very complex. It has plenty of hop bitterness and some funky tartness as well, but as stated before it is very clean, allowing all the different flavors to play their part. Fairly dry finish and a nice light to medium body make it very enjoyable to drink. A very well put together and executed brew. Score another one for Monk's."
"Well done from Orval. This beer was notably sweet, and with a hearty sense of the hops. An initial clean finish with a sneaky aftertaste that kept the hops close to my conscience. Poured a yellow-gold, with yeast for cloud cover. The beer worked well within itself, in that it didn't shy away from acknowledging its complexity, but didn't overwhelm the palate with a kaleidoscope of various sweeteners that hinder other Belgians."
"D: Orval is light enough and very interesting, so drinkability rates very well."
"D: may I have another? nothing wrong with this beer."
"The mouthfeel is light, and the carbonation is tight and sharp, again, almost wine-like. Already mentioned the super dry finish. I'm still developing my palate as far as Belgians are concerned, but this is a darn good beer any way you slice it."
"This is a very good beer with a lot of interesting characteristics. The brett does some nice things for this beer, and it's quite complex. Despite the complexities however it ends up feeling just a tad bland. All of the flavors are somewhat subtle; the funk for instance was more pronounced in the nose. Not quite a great beer in my book, but certainly a very good one."
"D – An exceptional brew."
"Would have been really nice if the taste would have been more balanced."
"Drinkability: An often overlooked gem for me. I would say that this is probably my favorite trappist beer that is readily available to me due to it difference from Chimay, Westmalle, Rochefort. I just need to remember to show more affection to this baby more often."
"A very good beer which i would definately try again. A must try."
"At 9 months in the bottle Orval pours amber into a chalice with a voluminous airy head that clumps in patches on the edges of the glass. It opens with grainy malt, sweet and perfumy hops, citrus, and sea air. Further on, spicy pepper, tartness, hard mineral water, freshly cut hay, and notes of leather emerge. Hops and the mineral character leave a trace of bitterness at the end. On the palate Orval is extraordinarily dry, yet the ample carbonation gives a full sensation. A timeless beer that's unlike any other."
"Orval definitely stands out from the other Trappist beers with style all its own and a lambic-like character. Highly recommended."
"All in all, I think the word here is unique. It was my first Trappist Ale, and it was definitely worth the experience. The flavor seemed to grow and gain complexity as the beer warmed, so I think I would recommend leaving this one out of the fridge for a while before enjoying."
"D: Orval is a beer to approach with an open mind. Truly one of the more unique brews out there. I'm glad I finally revisited this one after many years away."
"Any serious Belgian beer fan will probably get around to trying most of the trappists but this has been my least favorite sampling of a Trappist beer so far. Its unique and I understand the souring of the beer. I'm impressed, just not my style yet."
"In all it has some resemblance to geuze (and that is not bad!)"
"Second review 2010.11.20 (improving A and D from 4.5 to 5)"
"Pours murky orange with a large white head. The aroma is lemon with some brett-funk. The flavor is quite a bit of citrus as well as some funk. The finish is quite a bit of hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation. This is a very unique beer that everyone that is into craft beer should seek out and try."
"But most of all its obvious advantages, the Orval is a beer that changes gradually as time passes (the alcohol level is changing quickly), making each taste a new discovery. A unique beer."
"This is a very lively brew showing a hazy deep amber color with a giant golden head with lots of gobby lacing. The aroma is sweet banana malt and lemon herbal hop, very delightful and complex. The taste brings an odd lemon malt blend that immediately grows on you if that makes sense. It has a soft corriander butterscotch blend with a spicey and very tart finish that shows some melon subtleties. The feel is a smooth mid-body with plenty of spritz. It's reasonably drinkable and a very unique option for refreshment and flavor. Pretty good stuff."
"In short, the beer does pretty much everything right and doesn't offend in any way...but the total package is somewhat unremarkable, in my opinion. It's missing that proverbial ""je ne sais pas."" Regardless, it's a good brew - just doesn't bring the ""wow"" factor."
"After seeing how highly this beer was rated I was disappointed after I got my hands on it. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it doesn't particularly suit my tastes. I wouldn't purchase it again."
"Sensational in refreshment and drinkability. Classic and inspiring. Yes, please."
"Rich mouthfeel. The carbonation lends a fullness to this beer that is otherwise greater than the body. Quite nice."
"Great drinkability, this beer is delicious, balanced great, and is so easy to drink it practically disappears. Will improve review later."
"D - The bitterness/tartness lingers. Still a drinkable beer."
"D - Drinks nicely. A solid brett beer with some good flavors. Could drink a couple of these."
"Perhaps I'll have to try again sometime, but i have to be honest."
"Overall, I'm extremely glad I finally got to try this. I get the impression from here on BA that there really aren't other beers like Orval, which is a shame because I'd seek them out."
"I'd recommend this one to any body. Good beer overall, best of luck in your finds. Cheers."
"D: I could drink a few if it were less expensive and more approachable, I will try it again when I have gained more knowledge."
"D: Very easy to drink. Clearly a complex beer, but it doesn't overwhelm you, which is good. Will be having another one of these hopefully soon"
"D: geez this is the great beer to drink straight up or with food and/or cheese its just out of this world. I can never drink just one and even at 5 bucks a pop I always buy 6. This is the one beer worth it, well as most of the Trappists are."
"pours a very thick doubled-height head that dissipates at a moderate pace at first, then slows to a crawl with great lace. Milky golden color. Liquid mouthfeel is bubbly! Faint orange taste with mild citrus notes, but nothing stands out too far. Quite a bit of bitterness"
"Mouthfeel is prickly, too much carbonation, but the body is fairly light."
"Note: absolutely do not drink this beer too cold. You may as well not drink it at all if you're not going to have it warm enough to unleash all its complexity. Definitely a beer that every beer drinker--regardless of preferred style--should try at least once."
"While it is a most complex and highly balanced beer, I would not consider having another in any particular session. The beer definitely held my interest in trying to decipher its complexities further, but after one my desire was extinguished. However a positive feeling the beer imparted lingered on... I like to consider this beer as a Belgian take on a bitter ale with a purposeful eye on balance."
"I would buy this beer again, the taste and price are right for what I got. I am fully satisfied and would love to share this with friends. The only downside to this beer is the head is a little to much, in my opinion."
"D: very easy to drink (but not fast)... the alcohol is completely hidden."
"D-A very good beer that I would not hesitate to try again. Would be very nice on a warm summer day in place of the usual American IPA."
"Theres a store here in Colorado that sells bottles for $2.49 a piece... might need to go buy a case, although i might drink it all in a few days. Seriously. Amazing stuff. I love these Cistercian monks, got to make it to the brewery some day. Soon."
"highly recommended from one of my local bottle stores and a great choice. I will try this again."
"Notes: Very unique, Orval has always been a standard for me, it may not appeal to everyone because of its distinct flavors, but I like its uniqueness. This is definitely a belgian classic."
"Drinkability: if you find this beer enjoy this one enjoy it for all its worth cuz its worth every penny"
"aging this beer turns it into a whole different beast. the turn this beer takes as it apporaches the five years out mark is remarkable if you like the flemish ale characteristics. this beer can go from a relativley bright and spritzy hoppy ale to a much richer beverage with deep complexity, both of which are delightful! i will be keeping a stock around to always have an old one on hand after this tasting!!"
"D: The dry feeling left behind makes me want to drink more."
"D: A must have for any fan of Brett, or anyone who is interested in seeing what farmhouse funk is all about. A world-class one-of-a-kind brew that is well worth seeking out."
"this beer pours a beautiful deep orange to copper, huge foaming head with brilliant lacing as you continue to drink. the smell is orange peels, cinnamon, vanilla, figs, pears, etc... quite a similar taste, it really is amazing like all trappist beers. pears and oranges are evident in the taste as well a hint of fine belgian yeast and spices. those monks really do know how to make a delicious brew!!"
"D- this is definitely an acquired taste. has a good taste but the carbonation makes it a little too dry to drink on a regular basis."
"Very light-bodied and generously carbonated. Crisp and clean the whole way through. Easily drinkable and quite tasty. A great refreshing Trappist brew."
"A particular brew that you'll never get tired of."
"A truly fine crafted Ale from those crazy Trappist dudes."
"Had a bottle in Brussels at Mokafe in the Arcade du Roi, with a ham and cheese sandwich and a small salad. Rich, ruby-red color with a dense white head that took at least five minutes to dissolve enough so I could get to the beer underneath. Nice. Lace everywhere. Surprisingly light aroma, but that was deceptive: there was a nice malty hit in the first taste and ever-so-little bite at the back. Tight, fizzy bubbles and a light texture-- lighter than I expected based on the color. Easy to drink, and the 6.9 ABV doesn't hit hard."
"Poured into North Coast goblet. Very thick and cloudy. Orangish in color. Created a very thick, two finger head. I actually liked the smell quite a bit, kind of a fruity citrus mixed with a bit of straw. Very dry mouthfeel, a little high on the carbonation for my taste. Slight hoppiness up front, a little bit of funkiness, nice and sweet. Very drinkable, I actually felt like the beer got better the more I had. All in all, a very good Belgian Pale, very unique citrusy flavor. Not my favorite style, but definitely one of the best, if not the best, of it's style."
"An excellent beer. Those monks know what they're doing."
"Cheers!"
"Overall - Drinks like a cross between a lambic and a saison with some pale ale thrown in. Sounds a little discordant, but it works."
"A lot of carbonation, dry, light to medium bodied and complex. Nice to drink, a bit tart, and there is also a hint of sweetness. Well worth trying, and having again."
"Drinkability: this stuff is pretty good, although it may be a little too flavorful and complex to really session."
"Overall, this is a tasty Belgian Pale Ale. I would pick this up again, but if the carbonation level is this high in all Orval beers, then I'll probably pass. Just too much to make it enjoyable."
"All in all, an interesting offering. Would I pick it again over other Trappists? Probably not. But I can appreciate where it's coming from."
"D- Excellent, well worth a try."
"D: This is a very drinkable Belgian; it goes down easily but also can be sipped on for quite a while. My kind of beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty interesting beer. Not as complex as other trappists, but pretty unique, so it's definitely worth a try."
"The taste however falls way short of my expectations. It is grainy bitter and sour and only the smooth mouthfeel can save it a bit."
"A unique Trappist with a clear orange and amber color, small white head with nice lacing. Aroma of coriander, orange peel, black pepper and faint vanilla. Tastes of citrus, orange and coriander. Medium mouth. Good bitter finish. Mellows slightly with age if kept well. Very nice."
"Drinkability - Complex yes but no big burst of flavor. Perfect for the person who enjoys a citrus oriented beer"
"Overall, not too bad. Again, it's dryer than I prefer but loses no points. Not a bad beer by any means. The smell alone is amazing."
"Mouthfeel- Highly carbonated, just shy of medium bodied."
"Nice drinkability. Probably the best BPA I've had, but not a beer I will rush out to have again."
"D : I would prefer to have this as an aperitif and a digestif - so basically I can keep at it"
"Drinkability: Not a high ABV, easy to drink, and a nice variety of flavors. A well put together beer worthy of being tasted by any craft beer drinker. The price isn't terrible, but it's not great either. I'm not sure how often this will end up in my crate though, even though it was an enjoyable experience."
"Taste was very good, but not my favorite Trappist beer. Again citrus by taste. Very easy to drink though."
"D: Epitomizes the Belgian Pale style for me: crisp, yeasty dryness, 'rustic' flavor, bountiful aroma, and, oh, that look. Do yourself a favor and buy some for now and for later...among the world's best fresh, even better with some age. I don't recall loving this beer nearly as much in my early days but now it's divine: A+."
"This is the best example of the style I've ever had. Hands down. This is also a style I typically do not like."
"The beer is perfectly carbonated and the alcohol isn't present in the flavors at all. The beer is light and crisp, something you can definitely drink more than one bottle of."
"D: They have been rocking this beer since the 1100s. And I pray they never stop."
"From a bottle that was bottled on 22/04/2009 with an expiration date listed as 22/04/2014. Sampled on October 10, 2009. I bought it warm and let it chill but maybe not long enough as the lightweight, cottony foamy head was about three inches thick on top of the glass. Still it poured a nice copper color with plenty of lacing and rather cloudy. The aroma was comforting with its milder sweet malt and light hop mixture. A full bodied mouthfeel. The taste was a fabulous sweet malt, vaguely wheaty, and dryly hopped experience. Overall, a very mild brew with a high ABV. This is top of the line stuff although the next time I buy it, I will let it sit around for a few more months before cracking it open."
"Unique."
"The pour from the Orval yielded more head than my goblet normally allows. Almost a full five fingers worth! The head was a nice white color and the beer is a sort of murky gold. The smell is really sweet, I really like it. It smells almost like a lambic, with the hint of fruits. Maybe some banana, mixed berries, a hint of raspberry and something else I can't quite identify. I took a couple of drinks before writing this, but before I get to taste I must commend the beer on lacing this goblet. This goblet eats all sorts of foam from any beer, yet Orval prevails over it - it must be a sign that their collaboration will be a success. The feel of the beer is almost dry, like a pale ale. The taste is really unique however, the scent of the beer is backed up in the taste, the banana, raspberry, malts and others and it's slightly sour, yet slightly sweet. It's different and tasty; I could definitely drink a couple of these in a night if it wasn't for the almost five dollar price tag. I could easily see myself picking these up occasionally for the rest of my life when I want to indulge myself a little. Try it if you haven't already."
"Overall cannot believe I let this one go so long. Cannot believe it as it is such a top not offering. One of the elite for sure I would have this any day."
"This is a very unique beer; direct comparisons are nearly impossible. I did recently review a beer that comes close though -- Goose Island's Sofie. I don't know why I'm sharing that information. Back on track: this beer is complex, drying yet refreshing, worthy of universal praise. Everyone should have this at least once."
"Pours a very nice deep amber (near coppe) color with fantastic head and lacing. Great scent, very deep and malty with wonderful fruit attributes (apple, cherry, and banana). Great deep malty flavor, nice hint of fruit; the aftertaste is complex, with a bit of hops and fruit and with a near cloying finish. Goes down thick, but nice and smooth. Not my favorite trappist, but really, really good nonetheless."
"Good light body with a refreshing carbonation."
"What a brew. Haven't had it or a while so it was great revisiting tonight. That complexity on the nose of brett, pine, potpourri, barnyard is quite unique. To then deliver something tart, slightly sour yet so palatable is pretty special. It looks great too, radiant orange with a billowing head. Fairly low carbonation and a finish that doesn't give up. This is top shelf stuff."
"Drinkability: Orval's taste is unique, the original and unreplicated. It's another one of those beers that you really have to have tried at least once in your life."
"- Very drinkable, and a fantastic imported style all in its own. Would certainly buy it again."
"Amazing stuff, not sure for how much longer I'd want to cellar a bottle of Orval. It must hit a peak before the flavor profile really mellows and it becomes somewhat bland and musty tasting. I'm happy I gave this bottle a nice second birthday party."
"D - Too much crazy beer. Exhausting."
"Overall, an EXCELLENT brew. By far one of the most complex beers I've had to date. Took me about 4 or 5 mouthfulls before I pegged down what I could in the taste. Things seemed to just keep popping up. The head seemed to rival Duvel, but paired with the magnificent orange hue, the appearance is unparalleled to anything else I've ever had. Highly recommended and would gladly buy another."
"I could keep drinking more than one of these, they have a good taste, as long as it settles before it hits my tongue. However, Does not compete with my favorite Trappist, Chimay White."
"Overall an excellent Trappist. I prefer the Farmhouse Saison when going Belgian, but I'll do this again...."
"Picked up this bottle from OTM in OB. Poured into a Maredsous chalice. Massive, beautiful lacey head from the pour, hangs around forever and leaves a lovely lace on the edge of the glass. As soon as I popped the top of the bottle I was met with the amazing sweet, sour yeasty aroma with lots of esters, one of the most appetizing smelling beers I've tried. The taste is complex and interesting with a lot of flavors from the brettanomyces coming through - leather, horsey on top of the blondey belgiany base. Really an enjoyable beer, definitely going to try again. This bottle was about 9 months from the bottling date."
"Taste is tart and funky, but not at all overwheming. Nice dry finish with each sip. One can imagine sipping more than one after it is all gone."
" (original rating) From a bottle in Lund, Sweden on 8-28-07. Pours a murky golden orange amber with a substatial head that stays for quite awhile in a tulip glass. The aroma is probably one of the best-sweet apricots linger with tangy lemon and spicy cinnamon. I was expecting a better flavor out of this, but something was lacking. There was a good mouthfeel with heavy carbonation, but an intrusiveness of alcohol lingered over it and ruined the flavor. The bitterness in the finish was definitely refreshing, but for a beer bottled at only 6.2% ABV, there shouldn't have been this prevalent of an alcohol taste. I'll definitely give it another try."
"PS- it is worthy to note, this was bottled on 04/22/09, so I will let my other bottles age for while, then revisit this one at a later date."
"An exceptional, unique beer. The beer pours a beautiful shade of burnt orange-amber, medium, with a slight haze. The head is white and rocky and dissipates at a medium pace. The aroma is exquisite. The sour barnyard funk is just precisely right and blends wonderfully with the underlying Belgian ale notes. One of my favorite aspects of Orval is the perfect dryness. This nature even comes through in the aroma. There are fruit notes, apricots, grapes, lemons, figs, and earthy complexity. The flavor is just wonderful. I'm a bit of a sucker for a dry, delicious beer, and Orval pulls this off this combination better than nearly any other. The flavor is somewhere between a gueuze and a Belgian ale. Orval makes me imagine how good Belgian-style ales must have tasted before modernity imposed sanitary conditions and end of the sour beer as the norm. Orval is a world classic and everyone should try it. I will be buying some bottles for the cellar soon and look forward to witnessing this beer's maturation."
"Perhaps the best example of a Belgian PA."
"Drinkability: A great beer. Get whenever you can. One of the most complex and tasty beers I've had."
"-Bye"
"Taste is cider-like with notes of apple, vinegar, mint, and a grassy, grapefruit-juice bitterness in the finish. I'm impressed with the slightly wild but very refined flavors. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and appropriately thin without being watery. Just a tremendous beer, well worth the price."
"D- Very good. Complex taste, but could've used more aroma."
"D - Very wine-like. This might be right up some people's alleys, but I was disappointed actually."
"Huge carbonation on this one; I thought it was high enough to detract from the mouth feel and drinkability. It was very spicy, sharp, and filling. The air settled down some toward the end of the glass."
"Drinkability: I first had this in a bottle and tasted much like rusty pipe water and was a drain pour. I figured I had a bad bottle considering the reviews on BA, so I thought I should give this another chance and to my surprise I did not find this to be enjoyable seeing that I personally started my craft beer journey with the Trappist selection and have enjoyed the majority of the 7 seven trappist breweries. This is definitely worth the try but I would not have another."
"Overall this is a fine Trappist ale, not the pinnacle but on the upper tier. It is the most unique and possibly the most complex one I have had so far. This is also beer #250 tasted for me, hoorah."
"This beer just tastes like an accomplishment. Incredible. So glad Trader Joe's was selling them at 2 bucks a bottle in the middle of Brooklyn."
"Pours a clear copper color with a large thick white head. Tons of carbonation bubbles in the glass. Smells very breadlike with some rich funky wood aromas and some spice. The funkiness is apparent in the flavor also. It's not a bad flavor, just a little twang. This beer really does have a great unique flavor. Some bready flavor, some spice, a little cork/wood (which is weird since there is no cork) and some fruitiness. The alcohol flavor is there too, but doesn't take away from any flavors. Mouthfeel is tingly and spicy and finishes dry. Awesome beer, I would never pass this up if it was available."
"A very good beer. I like the bitterness that it has. The alcoholic content is not so much that I wouldn't be able to enjoy 2 or 3 glasses. Very refreshing and tasty."
"3- Drinkability- I don't think that this is for most beer drinkers. This one definitely takes some time to get used to and to learn to appreciate it. I'd like to have a bunch more of this to see if I really like it or not after some more time with it. Even if I didn't, at least I'd be left with a bunch of cool bottles to put homebrew in."
"(D)- More hop presence than I was expecting, but a pleasant surprise nonetheless. A trappist beer that I would gladly return to over and over again due to its relatively lower abv (6.9%) than most trappist brews, not to mention the slightly cheaper price as well. I am sure this could age for even longer, but was absolutely fantastic right now."
"drinkability is very good but you want to take your time with this and that can be hard to do"
"This beer blew my mind-hole. Me and my partner both thought this was the most stand-out beer we'd ever had."
"D- I would definitely take a second bottle if one were available... don't know if I would consume more than two in a sitting though... ultimately I'd say this is very drinkable for a beer of this strength and complexity."
"This is very drinkable but I don't think I would want more than one and I'm not sure why?"
"J"
"Looks like a cider with a slightly light orange hue; the lead was a light beige and foamy. Smelled like a bunch of sweet apples. Taste was a good mix of sweet and bitter. The apple taste from the aroma was there as well as hints of bread and citrus. Going down you could taste something earthy, can't really think of another description. Mouthfeel was pretty good; right amount of thickness and carbonation, and the head just added to that. Goes down pretty easily. Overall a good combination of flavors, smell, and alcohol level, easily drinkable on any occasion."
"Verdict: Orval is a thoroughly unique experience, and one I'm to glad to have finally experienced. I've heard people refer to this beer as a challenge, and I can certainly see why, but it's a challenge worth taking (at least once)."
"FANTASTIC!"
"I think Orval is something really special in the beer world. It's the ultimate in refined craftsmanship; it's overall delicious and packed with nuances to be discovered; as well, it's light and incredibly drinkable. I would drink this all the time if it were more affordable, so, as it is, I will put Orval on a high pedestal and enjoy it on special occasions."
"This is my first review and I really shouldn't put it so far at the top of the scale... but... this ale is simply wonderful. It smells good, it looks great, and tastes simply divine. The taste is very distinct and leaves an aftertaste that keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend it."
"Light (relatively speaking) alcohol, dry body, spritzy carbonation - yep, it's quite drinkeable"
"This trappist brew has a quite different character from other trappists. While not my favorite beer of this style, it is one I will be revisiting again in the future."
"A compelling aroma with telltale leather from the Bretts, which hints of great, sour things. Reminiscent of a tart lambic or flanders red. The flavor which follows leaves much to be desired. It's thin, likely over-attenuated from the Brett. Not much perceptible sourness and the Brett flavors (leather and barnyard) are less apparent than in the nose."
"This brew pours a quite brilliant cloudy, orange/amber colour (when held up to light) and exhibits a bubbly, frothy off-white head with good retention and leaves some decent patchy lacing. Aromas of fresh apple, pear, citrus, pepper and spice all touched off with a hint of caramel arise from this beer. As it warms, I am able to detect a bit of salty cured meat as well (it brings prosciutto wrapped cantaloupe to mind). Taste is quite yeast and fruity up front yet very dry and it displays a bitterness from the hops that I have not come across in a Trappist so far. With those hops come along some nice citrusy and even some coriander notes like from a good wheat ale. The spice lasts through the finish and on to the linger with a dryness that is all too refreshing (especially for a Trappist ale). Mouthfeel is champagne like, medium bodied but with a ton of prickly bubbles that tickle the taste buds and leave my mouth watering after its bone-dry, peppery finish. Overall, this ia an achievement of a beer. So complex on the palate and so refreshing - not to mention, its relatively low ABV (for a Trappist, that is) makes it quite drinkable indeed. I have always enjoyed this beer and I will be enjoying it for a long time to come."
"I was looking forward to trying this after reading all the good reviews. My only negative is that I wish it had a little heavier mouthfeel to it."
"D - What a remarkable brew! I love the musty, dank, minerally flavors here. This brew would pair so well with food (cheese especially!) - ceviche, an aged natural-rind goat's milk cheese, or fried fish tacos. My very first Orval, but certainly not my last!"
"M/D: the carbonation is quite heavy and the brew is heavy as well with slight bitterness on the tongue. Drink this brew slowly and savor it's complexities."
"D- Very easy to drink, and very refreshing."
"Mouthfeel - light watery body and smooth. Well carbonated."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable, though not a beer I'd pick to have more than one of."
"Drink: This is ""binary"" beer, I like it, my good friend hates it; I would say it's a nice beer in the mix but not one for many in a session."
"I'd give this a B or B- overall."
"Jordan."
"D: Well, it's been a bit difficult to get down this glass, mainly because of the intense metallic flavor on the back end."
"D -- One of those beers that you sample first to get the unique style and character, but not one to quaff all night."
"D- A very interesting brew. I didn't use the redundant 'horse blanket' descriptor but I can see how that might fit."
"Notes: incredible, unique beer with plenty of complexity and variance. A true classic"
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy for something that seems so carbonated and it has a very dry finish."
"Overall, it's a remarkable beer that I would most certainly try again."
"Insanely complex, and every nuance is joy. Deserves the cult around it."
"D - A truly unique creation that is vastly different from all other beers that I've tried... Sometimes unfamiliarity can be fun and exciting, but in this case it is slightly off putting..."
"11.2oz. bottled served in my Bruery Tulip. Bottled on 13/11/2008. Poured a pale, hazy, orange-gold with a voluminous three-inch bright white head honeycombed with holes. Head slowly recedes leaving behinds delicate strands of lacing. Nose is mild - some light fruity esters (maybe some pear and green apple) with a suggestion of funk that is masked considerably in the nose. Taste is consistent with nose; however, roles reverse in the flavor profile. Fruity flavors are concealed by a bit of funky/skunky tartness. Mouthfeel is light and lively and finishes somewhat dry with a bit of acidity/astringency that lingers lightly. A really nice Trappist ale. Different from many of the Belgian Pale Ales in that it is markedly less sweet and more dry than most I've tried."
"An exceptional brew. That's for sure, but I wonder how an older Orval would taste like."
"This one starts and finishes very dry. Overall a pretty amazing beer that can truly be savored."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and very pleasing on the palate. Drinkability was great and alcohol was not noticeable at all."
"Interesting for sure...but underwhelming."
"D: Buy this one and enjoy!!! This is a fantastic beer."
"What a beautiful beer. Sour, malty, and dry. A truly world-class Belgian. Great carbonation (meaning it's balanced with the flavor, not excessive and not underwhelmed), highly drinkable, great tartness and just enough thinness in the body to go down easy. Pleasant in so many ways."
"D: geez this is the great beer to drink straight up or with food and/or cheese its just out of this world. I can never drink just one and even at 5 bucks a pop I always buy 6. This is the one beer worth it, well as most of the Trappists are."
"This is one unique brew, if you spot one, try it"
" Beau of Bama"
"D - a complex beer that would go well paired with finger food"
"D--For me, Brett will hurt the drinkability of any beer ever so slightly. But there is just no perceptible residual sugar here to turn me (that's what gets me with the Brett--the way the funk interacts w/ residual sugar). I could drink these until I got kicked out of the bar."
"D: One of the more ""interesting"" Trappist beers"
"D: Easy ale to drink."
"The carbonation is quite high and the body quite light."
"Over all-very good. This bottle is 1yr old, like to try 3-4yr bottle."
"Pours with a nice, creamy, off-white head that is absolutely huge - and continues to rise after sitting. Body is amber-orange and hazy. Excellent lacing...this is a perfect-looking beer! Great aroma as well; quite yeasty, with citrus tones. The first sip is excellent - lightly sweet and acidic, with a medium, creamy body. Fizzy carbonation. At 6.9%, you can taste the alcohol but it's hardly overwhelming... perfectly balanced. The head is fully lasting throughout drinking, and the finish is long as well. Excellent beer - one of my new favorites - and great that you can actually find in many places outside of Belgium."
"Overall, I would recommend that everybody try this one at least once... just due to the fact that it is so unique in it's flavor profile. I've never had anything else quite like it. Again, I didn't particularly like it, but it's uniqueness is something to be admired."
"Bottled on 10/14/2006. Big head that refuses to go away. Lacing all over the sides. Golden amber colored. Smell is slightly tart and sour, but mostly has smells of light fruits like pears and apples. Smell is tart up front then a bitter finish mixed with spiciness and the tartness. Very peppery in the end. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated for sitting almost three years in the bottle. Beer is rather dry in the end."
"A really fantastic and mesmerizing beer. I could probably drink a case of these in a day and not realize I was doing it."
"It pours what would be a nice shade of golden, but filmy. The head is enormous! One of the biggest (but not the biggest) head I have ever poured. It goes down slow with a thickness in the head. The smell is good. I bit fruity, but not to excess with what might be a malty background covering up some of the fruit smell. Taste is alright. Not fruity and not malty, but not much too it than I expected from a Belgium beer. Rather uneventful to some part, but the taste is there. No after taste. Goes down rather smooth. Verdict: try it and judge for yourself."
"A wonderful beer. Would drink several in one sitting if given the chance."
"I could drink a few of these, great beer."
"Pours cloudy light copper color with huge off-white head. Very good retention. Smell - somewhat sweet, raisiny, slight hoppiness coming throgh, some grassy aromas, some malts. Pretty complex aroma, very interesting. Taste is hoppier than smell, some citrusy notes appear, maltiness is all the way through, bitter finish. Very nice balanced brew, very smooth, alcohol is not noticeable. Very drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable."
"One can find the Orval experience a little unusual when first encountered perhaps due to the complexity and hefty pine theme, however you will be rewarded if you give it some time."
"Drinkablility: Certainly easy to drink. Truthfully, I like smelling it as much as drinking it. As fun and interesting as it is, I don't want another right now. Tomorrow, yes."
"Have been looking forward to sitting down and sipping this bottle, even ended up with a free Orval goblet to pour in. How authentically Belgian of me. Pours a hazy amber to orange color with beautiful dense white head. Following a few sips, I am extremely impressed by the lacing left around the glass. I am not a complete appreciator of the wild funk, but this definitely has it. The brett is there, as is some citrus hints. There is definitely a lot going on in the nose, and I guess I need to continue to explore these styles to fully appreciate it. There is a nice bitter and citrus balance in the taste, nothing too offensive. I have had some that are all sour, but in this case there is enough other flavors to balance it out. The funk (some call it barn) smell is there in the flavor, but is not too powerful. A very crisp and tart ale, with a fair amount of carbonization. In the end, I am enjoying each taste of this sipper, trying to pick up everything, but it is certainly a new realm for me. I do believe I'd like to pair this with some food in the future, alone you are left to ponder this beer too much, and I bet it is nice with some cheese and bread."
"I knew going into this that it would be different. I was kind of worried to be honest. I'm pleased that I at least could appreciate the product, and this intriguing brew will be in my fridge again in the future."
"UPDATE: Had a fresher bottle (01/06/10) tasted on 9/2011, the hop presence is much more prevalent."
"This one went down quite smooth and was really a joy to break down and review... as well as drink. Really my first honest example of this style (other than perhaps Leffe and some others that I didn't think were anything to write home about), it turned me on and hopefully more are in my (immediate) future."
"Edit: After having so many great experiences drinking Orval, I had to go back and give it a perfect 5."
"D- slow sipper. Would not drink this all evening."
"The mouth feel is full with carbonation, and has a slight refreshing edge to the drinkability. As the beer warms up a bit, it is actually quite smooth."
"very effervecent mothfeel, quite refreshing, very drinkable. orval more than lives up to its reputation."
"A really nice choice for Spring/Summer, Would love to cellar some to see how it ages, esp since these are dated to be good w/in 5 years."
"This to me is the epitome of drinkability. Keeps one guessing but is still satisfying until the last drop."
"Well no time to review this beer but I would say this is a great beer that is a bit overhyped, not as good as chimay so I will rarely get this without a boatload of disposable income, but a great beer nonetheless. Subtle and delicate flavors that would be lost if it were not the first beer, but still this is dissapointing, and definitely not the best trappist ale."
"D- great"
"Good, and unique - I haven't had anything similar. I'll probably buy this again."
"The aroma is very interesting, fresh, bright, and fruity and sweet. There's a strange quality to it that must be the brett. The taste is more of the same, a bit of a sour tartness to it, some grass flavors and some citrus. It's a bit over carbonated, but overall easy drinking."
"D--Very fine brew here, nearly flawless for the style."
"D - Refreshing and complex at the same time."
"This beer is not only a beer, but an experience."
"Poured from a bottle. Split between two 8 oz glasses. There is a significant amount of head with this beer, full of tiny bubbles. The head is reducing over time. You can see the bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, much more so than other beers. There is a floral, yeasty smell to this beer. There is noticeable carbonation to the mouthfeel, This doesn't seem as light as I remember the other Trappist beers being, but it is exceptionally drinkable. The taste is slightly alcohol with overtones of grass. Because it is a Trappist beer, you know it will be good. I recommend Orval to any beer drinker."
"Damn...this is hard to find here and expensive when I do see it...generally I prefer forking out for the darks and dubbels and tripels and quads. I'm content with Australian pale ales. But damn this was really really nice. Just wish it was more common and affordable."
"Drinkability is high for its enticing complexity - I want more just to be able to soak in its complexities."
"After my first try, I think that I will have to sample a few more of these, in order to accustom myself to the different taste. I did not feel it was ""dirty"" or ""funky"" as a few other reviewers thought, but maybe I will get those senses next time I drink it."
"Pours a bright golden color with a fantastic rocky, frothy, sticky head that retains unbelievably well. Mass amounts of lacing sticks to the Chimay glass. Smells of brett funk, yeast, vinegar, leather...tons of things going on here. Tastes of tons of funk on the palate, tart cherries, with a huge backbone of IODINE. Reminds me of a spirit ie single malts in it's crazy complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lots of carbonation, prickly on the mouth, and dry finish. Drinkable on the fact that you can't put it down while you're trying to figure out everything that is going on inside this extraordinarily unique beer."
"Solid, solid beer. Other reviews are spot on. If you are not into Belgian beers I suggest you try this beer first and it will change your mind. Lve the orange color and how the head retention stays through drinking. Mixed cherries with also a bit of straw (hey). Great pairing with seafood, like mussles!!! Only real negative is that it can be a bit pricy, very worthwhile to drink."
"This is a big leap from the kind of beer you can buy in a plastic cup at a football game, and I admit, I'd had a dozen of these before I could honestly say I unequivocally love it. But do persevere. God has a special place in his heart for the monks at Abbaye Orval. This is proof."
"This is definitely a good beer."
"This is a good beer, just not lighting my world on fire. I was so excited from the look and the smell, but then it just fell a little flat for me. A little oomph away from being fantastic."
"Always a pleasure, a beer I come back to and look forward to, undeniably classy."
"Overall a matchless brew. Happy to finally get around to reviewing one of my favorite ales. This one isn't for everyone I notice but definitely worth a taste. If you like the dry and mellow tart flavors as much as I do this could end up as one of your favorites."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable. Not too terribly priced either, if you find the right store."
"Overall this is a fantastic beer and the weirdest of the trappist beers I've had so far. The brettanomyces sets it apart, and it is easily the best Belgian pale ale I've had."
"Before shelling out the cash for a Trappist (they are expensive little buggers) I did a little looking. I'm only on ""sports and weather"" terms with many Belgian styles, so I looked around. The reviews of Orval promised something different. Well, I'm pretty impressed. Tart, a little funk. This is a damn tasty brew. I'd like a little more funk, which I may get for an older bottle."
"D: Allthough it's not too high on alcohol (between 6 and 7% abv on the label, it seems to vary), I think it's a beer for sipping. It also goes well with crackers 'n old hard cheese."
"Overall I was more than impressed. I heard this is a love it or hate it beer because of the brett, I personally loved it. Very good, very complex, great belgian and another great trappist beer."
"I'm looking forward to the next bottle I have in the fridge."
"Really drinkable, very complex, it takes more than one to even begin to figure this one out"
"Drinkability: With the higher weight it's a good thing this beer is so expensive. The large amount of gas made it very easy to drink, which could have bad results. Fortunately, it's got a built-in mechanism in being expensive, which prevents it from being drunk in excess."
"D: Not a session beer, but, acknowledging it is 6.9%, Orval is quite drinkable. It takes little effort to drink a bottle of it, keeping in mind it's the kind of beer you want to savour."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: That aftertaste is a negative here - it's a little bit cloying. Of course, this isn't a beer designed to be drank in quantity, so the fact that it would be tough to drink in quantity isn't a big downer."
"Offers a decent feel with a lingering finish from the combination of fruit and carbonation. Drinkability is held in check by both the carbonation and the price. Glad I sampled this beer but will I do so again? I doubt it, though there are certainly friends I could recommend it to."
"Overall a strange yet exquisite thing, to be savored slowly and delicately."
"Starts off with a wash of hay and lemon rind. In the middle, a grassy hop character mingles with a mild pepperiness. In the finish, bitterness becomes more medicinal, with notes of ginger and lemon (and anise too?) in a long, drying finish. Dry through and through."
"As a final note, while drinking this, I would have killed to pair it with some warm Brie cheese spread on top of watercress crackers."
"Lingering bitter aftertaste."
"A crime that it took me so long to give it a go with this masterpiece of a beer. Beautiful."
"Appearance is a golden/amber similar to honey. Cloudy with a huge off-white head that seems to last forever. Aroma is very mild malt with some sweetness, much less complex than I expected. Taste was also very mild, mainly corn, having no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a light body and high carbonation, not unlike seltzer water. This is an easy beer to drink, but not very arousing in my opinion. Not sure if I just got a bad bottle as I expected a lot more from this offering."
"M + D: Sparkling, foaming, rich. It's a very interesting style, and one of the better ones. It took far too long to finally get around to it, but glad to have done so now... with the lower alcohol, it's inviting to have another."
"D: This beer is incredibly drinkable thanks to is light wieght and big time carbonation. Overall, this beer works on every level. The flavors are complex but still remain light and delicate. I think that is the best way to describe this beer. It has some much going on but it still remains delicate. Just a beautifully crafted brew. Glad I followed the advice of whoever it was who told me to get a bottle of this to give a go. Just great."
"d- If i could afford it I would drink this beer everyday. This is near perfect."
"I finally get this beer. While anyone can enjoy it this is a beer that is very deep for newbies as the sophistication of it's construction requires an educated palate. While I have always enjoyed Orval for years, understanding it's difference and special place in the beer world requires patience and perspective."
"D - Drinking this was a job."
"Mouthfeel is very interesting. Clearly present carbonation that completely fills the mouth. It's assertive but not too prickly or strong, but actually rather soft. Overall, very drinkable, refreshing brew with enthralling complexity and richness or flavor. I can definitely see why this is considered the quintessential belgian pale ale."
"Overall: Great beer! I'll be picking up a couple more of these ASAP."
"D: Very nice beer with plenty of flavors. Complex beer but very drinkable."
"Drinkablilty:this is a great pale ale full of spices and dry grains ,i would think that some might not get it but try this beer more then once and you will.."
"D: This is definitely a unique brew that is completely unlike any other Trappist beer. If you like dry Belgian ales like Duvel and Saison Dupont, this will be right up your alley. The price keeps me from seeking it out too often, though."
"D= Pretty good. Not a bad beer at all. I was expecting a lot more just from what I've heard about it. I thought it was pretty basic. Good though."
"D- Tart, dry and highly carbonated makes this one a task to drink."
"Very nice taste here, heavier hop profile than most other trappists that I've had. Nice sweetness providing some lovely fruit flavors and butterscotch/caramel sweetness. Excellent depth here. Leaves the mouth quite dry, but still satisfied. Has a very creamy body to it/ definitely medium to full bodied beer here. Would love to drink a few of these."
"Overall I enjoyed the beer, there is quite a bit of complexity to it, maybe I need to revisit this when I'm more experienced with reviewing belgians - but for now I'm glad to just have had only a single bottle."
"All in all, a very good belgian ale, but IMO not in the same class with Duvel and Tremens."
"Definitely one of a kind. This is one of the light trappists, golden yellow. The smell I've pinpointed as new sneaker. I know that sounds gross, but there is an undeniable funk to Oval. But it is one of the most crisp and refreshing beers I've come to enjoy."
"I like it, I just don't know how often I'd seek it out."
"Had at Local 44 in Philly. Poured a reddish/brown amber into a chalice with a frothy, sticky cream colored head that stayed until the last drop. Smell was fairly average, a bit yeasty and bitter, earthy as well. The taste was a thing of beauty. It started out a very full, rounded mellow sweetness with medium/heavy carbonation and then turned to a dry, crisp, mellow Belgian-hoppy flavor. Truly excellent complexity. I could drink these all night, fantastic beer, lives up to its hype, will not disappoint."
"D. All in all not one of my favorit Belgians. Although it did tend to grow on me towards the end. This is my first tasting, but not my last."
"D- The great attributes make me want more. Its alcohol was well masked making it an easy drinker and it's a wonderful example of the style. The fairly heavy price tag is the only thing stopping me from making this a regular purchase."
"D- This is quite the complex beer. There's a ton going on in the nose and palate. This is the type of beer that broadens your palate."
"I don't know if I like this beer, so I guess it means it's ok. It's like those slices of pizza you dont really like, at least it's still pizza though."
"This one took a bad turn. Usually one of my favorites. Destined to be reviewed again."
"bottled on: 05.06.08"
" Aroma is a wonderful scent of spices,sugar and lemon,lighter notes of orange and a nice finish of yeast and hops.The flavor is a blend of spices & lemon, Light banana notes and fruity esters form the yeast, nice bready notes, a crisp refreshing mouthfeel with a very dry finish of hops and alcohol. Very complex and balanced.A very fun try ."
"Funny shaped bottle with no visible date anywhere. Massive white head and a dark cloudy orange color, looks cool. Smells like brett and tastes like it too, funky, dusty pineapple and malty biscuity flavor. This is an interesting beer and unlike any other trappist beer I've tasted thus far."
"Drinkability - Drinkable? Yes. So dry through that I don't know how many I could drink in a session. Probably not more than three."
"A strange brew for sure, and stylistically leagues apart from its Trappist brethren. I didn't 'get' this beer in the past - it seemed like a strange goose and on the knife edge between love and hate. Over time, taste changes and the palate develops. Orval is a beast of a beer, and a classic. Everyone should try it."
"I love this beer. It's pricey, and I don't drink it that often, but I never go too long between bottles, either. A classic, essentially perfect brew to be admired, and to influence others. A beer to try, then try again, then try again as your palate develops."
"D: For me this is a beer to be savored and enjoyed. Many complex flavors involved make this a slow drinker."
"Creamy, medium bodied with a sharp, biting carbonation."
"Seems to be a 100% representation of the style - not sure this is exactly my favorite style."
"Poured out of a 330ml bottle into a goblet. Huge foamy off-white head sits on top of a hazy, dark orange body. Lots of sticky lacing clings to the glass while drinking. This looks like a tasty-ass beer float. I'm impressed. Smell is poignant hay, sour candy, and yeasty aromas. You would think the barnyard smell would be a turnoff, but it's actually quite intriguing. Taste is lightly juicy and fruity malts followed by tart grapefruit and some bitterness on the palate. The overall flavour is mild but well-executed. Mouthfeel is smooth with a nicely carbonated bite and a balanced, dry finish. I have enormous respect for this highly drinkable beer. The funky farm-like character is definitely something I haven't encountered before. A perfect beer for enjoying the spring weather with, though Orval would make for fine drinking any time of the year."
"This is the most I've spent on a beer per ounce, and it is worth every penny. Whenever I have some extra in my pocket, this will be in my house."
"Were it not for the price tag, I would probably pick Orval up much more often. Five bucks for a 33cl bottle is a bit steep, but somehow upon finishing it still seems like a fantastic bargain."
"This is a great one and a fantastic example of what a Belgian should be."
"11.2 ounce with a bottle on date of 05/06/2008. Beer poured into an Orval chalice forms a 2 finger head that slowly disappears into a thin coat after 5 minutes or so. Beautiful citrus aroma hits my nose as I'm pouring it. Color is a gorgeous hazy orangish-brown. Lace drapes itself along the glass as the drink is consumed. Taste is nice and sweet initially and then hops come through in the finish. Hint of lemon, grapefruits and banana are there in the taste. A well balanced pale ale that is very smooth and refreshing. I highly recommend it."
"Not a bad beer, but not my favorite of the Belgians."
"D- easy to finish, and something i could see myself drinking more of in the future. not really something i think i could have more than one of in a sitting."
"Comment I liked Orval a lot. It is a very unique beer that is full of surprises."
"Overall: Of all the Trappist beers I've had so far, this is easily one of my favorite. I'm a huge fan of the whole banana bread and clove element of it. I will say it's maybe a touch too ""bubbly"" for my taste, but I can't really find a whole lot more to complain about. I'll definitely be picking up some more of these down the road."
"Nice blend of flavors. The feel was heavenly and it is massively drinkable. Not the best Trappist beer I've had, but its tasty, quaffable nature was a welcome reprieve from some of the heavier, knock-out beers I've tried recently."
"Exceptional and highly recommend."
"This is the best Begian pale ale I'e ever had... hands down!!!"
"D: A very drinkable brew, each drink seems to be better than the one before."
"I wish fine beers like this were more readily available in bars, pubs, and lcbo's in Canada."
"As attested to by the large head, this is a very carbonated beer, detracting only slightly from the mouthfeel. I also had to account for the large pricetag when I took away from the drinkability. If it didn't run $6 per 11.2 oz, it would be perfectly drinkable."
"D- I could drink this all night at the alcohol level without ever getting bored. I love brett infused beers and this is one of the leading examples. I had this once in my early drinking days and hated it. Now, I'm glad I revisited it, as this is a near perfect beer."
"Cloudy golden yellow color, Huge head lasted throughout the entire drink. Med Mouthfell. aroma was citrus, tasted of citrus and sour, tart apples, and some other fruit. This was a very flavorful brew, that was all over my pallet! i think ever crevice of my mouth tasted something unique. But that being said, it just wasnt really a favor im too fond of. To me this beer was just okay, after trying a few differnt ones, I guess im just not a fan of this particular style."
"Very drinkable. Went down extremely easily."
"Nice, refreshing, highly distinctive and absolutely gorgeous to look at, this is one Trappist ale that is well worth its lofty praise and honorable status. Watch out for the 6.9% ABV, though, as it can sneak up just as easily as the beer goes down."
"A nice, accessible Belgian ale and one I'll definitely be trying again."
"Bottled on 9/13/07. Poured into Chalice (gotta get a tuilp!). Poured a deep, dark yellow, almost orange. Slightly hazy, this beer is darker than most Pales. A big fluffy head of tight bubbles that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. A noticeable apple aroma with some spice tones, no apparent yeast scent. The dry, apple flavor follows the aroma without the acidity of cider. The spiciness is reminiscent of apple pie to a small degree. A full, smooth, balanced body. Very drinkable, I could have several of these in row with no trouble. A wonderful beer that is slightly different than most of the style."
"Drinkability: The operative word for this beer is ""complexity."" While the price might give me second thoughts I could drink more than one of these, but this is such a complex brew more than one might be excess. This is a beer one should revisit periodically both to increase one's appreciation and to refresh one's memory."
"Drinkability is really good. Very complex and tasty Belgian Pale. I could drink a few of these, but the price is a little steep for a small bottle."
"This is a very enjoyable, unique beer, but I doubt I'd want more than one in any given evening."
"I don't quite know what to think. Unique and drinkable, but not down right delicious like my favorite Belgians/trappists. I would like to try it again, but it'll be tough to convince myself to spend the $5 when I could get so many other great Belgians that I already know I love."
"This is one of the most drinkable of the Trappist ales and should be a favorite with hopheads; it's lightness makes it a nice thirst quencher and at only 6.9% ABV, you can enjoy a few."
"Orval pours a cloudy golden yellow with a beautiful white foamy head that lingers and clings nicely to the glass. It smells of citrus and malt. The flavor of this beer is complex and refreshing at the same time. The carbonation never overpowers the citrus and malt flavors, which leave room for a nice hoppy bitter finish very late."
"I had this at Isaac Newton's in Newtown PA.Poured from a bottle into a snifter.Pours a cloudy light amberish color with ridiculous white frothy heading that stays bubbly to the very end.Smell is very faint light hops light malt nothing to get nutty about.Taste is very sweet like a soda I took a sip and ended up with a mouthful of foam. I would have guessed this was a light beer but with 6.9% alcohol(stated on bottle) this kind of a heavy hitter. A very enjoyable beer if you like the champagne type."
"Bottle. Bottled on 24/01/2006, best before 24/01/2011. Pours an orange/amber, small white head, no real lacing to speak of. Aroma is flowery and spices, citrusy. Taste was rather mild, nothing really stood out to describe, I was surprised by how mild it was . Finish was slightly spicey and dry."
"The carbonation did result in a very nice mouthfeel, once it settled down."
" Dig them monks!!"
"D- A very interesting beer. Lots of stuff going on and very different from most of the other Trappist ventures. Quite hoppy for a Trappist brew, but very nice. Quite a nice Belgian pale."
"I liked it, but I'd be interested in trying a fresh bottle. I didn't actually know this one was so old. It's cool that it was essentially pre-aged 2 years for me, but I bet all that time affected the taste. I don't consider my taste developed enough to appreciate this beer completely. But for now I say B+."
"Picked up a single at Abe's Cold Beer for $4.50, not cheap, but not bad for a Trappist. The label says it was bottled 2/20/08, so this is about a year old. Upon pouring I can tell the Brett has taken over, but at first sip I see that it's also not fully developed. When this beer is fresh, it's a relatively hoppy Belgian, but thanks to the addition of wild brettanomyces it turns into a lambic. After a year, however, the tangy lemon sour aren't strong and rich enough to complete the beer. I feel like the malts and hops should come out a little more, but I'm left with a thin taste of sugar-covered bread."
"Overall, I enjoy this beer very much. A beauty to look at, a wonder for the nose, and a treat for the tastebuds."
"found a clone recipe, gonna start brewing this one really soon"
"This beer has an entirely unique flavor, my personal favorite of the Trappist Breweries, and perhaps my favorite Belgian beer overall."
"D - Flavor stays interesting and tasty throughout, with a not too intimidating amount of alcohol. A classic Belgian ale for a reason, as well as a great entry into funky, wild-yeast beers. A beer everyone needs to check off their list at some point."
"I only had one on me, but could have had several more. Great drinkability."
"Dare I say a session ale? Nah - too expensive and the abv is too much to be a session...but a fine brew nonetheless!"
"Bottled in September of 2008 with a best by of 2013. It poured a dark brownish color with not much head which little bit disappeared immediately. Smelled different than I expected but not something I can put my finger on other than light hops and some malt. Not a real great aroma for me. Taste to me was underwhelming and disappointing. Had a bit of sourness and some hop. Carbonation was ok although it didn't show in the head. Drinkability...not very to me. Maybe it needed more aging? Most likely won't try again. Very disappointing based on all the hype."
"Conclusion: This particular sample was bottled in 2008 and it says it drinks well until 2013; with this being a very fresh sample, I'd like to buy another and let it mellow in the cellar a bit. As delicious as this is, I think a year or two might mellow it out a little and take the edge off the hop and alcohol presence. That being said, this is a delicious Trappist offering...its spicy and floral characteristics remind me of a good Alsace Gewurtztraminer, and I think I'd actually prefer this one with food even more than on its own...perhaps some Camembert and crusty French bread?"
"Very well done."
"Overall I enjoy this beer, although am totally befuddled by it. I would try this again just to try to wrap my mind about what I'm tasting."
"Drinkability: Well, what can I say? Supposedly the classic example of the style, and while it displayed numerous subtle flavors, they were just too subtle for my taste. I can appreciate it for what it represents, but can't see myself hitting it up again."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. It pours an orange/yellow with enormous white head. The beer leaves lots of lacing and a white littlt cap on top. The aroma is of fresh lemons. The flavor is slightly sweet with a hint of phenol. The finish is crisp. The beer is medium body and IMO overcarbonated. The beer is very drinkable."
"Feel is creamy and slick but tingly from the carbonation. I would gladly drink more than one of these bowling pin shaped brews but i would almost feel guilty. So damn good."
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer with an original and unique profile. A true masterpiece from start to finish."
"Drink: This beer is almost too complex for one to have multiples. Though abv isn't very high. I like this beer. It's a special occasionier."
"Overall: One of the first brews introduced to me on my journey to beerdom- I couldn't recall the complexity of this beer. Not everyone will dig this. Me? I'll take this masterpiece anyday."
"Pours hazy orange, with a mammoth rocky head. Aroma is sour and horsey when cold, more perfume like as it warms. Flavor is very funky. The bottle I had was around 1.5 years from bottling. The wild yeasts in this one bring out the horsebarn, sour apples, and dry dry dry finish. Very interesting beer. My new years resolution is to try more of the ""wild type"" beers. This is the most famous user of brett fermentation, so might as well start it out here."
"D - I still do not enjoy the taste of this beer."
"My 50th review - I'm glad its on a good brew! This poured a hazy straw blonde, with a great head with great retention - all the way to the last sip. Aroma wasn't as interested as I've seen in other Belgian ales, but was nice. Taste is similar to Duvel, but I like Duvel more. Very sweet and smooth - that fantastic Belgian taste that it seems only the Belgians can get."
"Good brew and is one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Belgian Ale style."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Carbonation is great and the bitter aftertaste eases up as you drink it. Very crisp finish."
"D: High. What can I say that hasn't been said? This is an absolutely delicious beverage. The only thing stopping me from drinking this on a regular basis, is the almost $5/bottle price tag. Still, a nice treat every once in awhile. And, if like me, you try it, and don't like it, wait a year or two, and give it another go. It worked for me. I couldn't taste anything here 2 years ago. Just tasted bland. But now, well, I feel like the trout just returned MY gold ring. Cheers, and thanks to the brothers at Orval."
"D - Remarkably easy drink. Long time to wait for the head to subside, but a smooth and polishing beer."
"MF&D - smooth, crisp, the carbonation is great and makes me want another sip. feels like a good medium body beer."
"Very tastey, and obviously well constructed. ABV isn't absurd for this Belgian, so it makes a decent session."
"Poured into a goblet from a bottle, Orval pours a hazy amber, almost orange hue with an aggresive frothy white head that thins after a few minutes. The aroma at first is fruity and sour, with hints of banana and tart fruits. It is followed up by a spicy hop aroma. The flavor is immense. Fruity, with hints of spice, candi sugar, and that earthy, signature Brettanomyces funk. It finishes dry and clean, with great hop character that is unlike other Trappist ales. Orval is a medium bodied brew. The flavor only lasts from sip to swallow. Not much lingering on the palate. It is, however, very easy to drink. Not my favorite beer from the seven Monastaries, but definitely up there on the list."
"Drinkability: I surely enjoyed this one, and it deserves recommendation due to the flavour-to-scent resonance and overall high character- On a side note worth mentioning is the fact that it's very similar to a Biere de Garde, (or is it vice versa?)"
"Poured from squat 11.2oz brown bottle, bottled on 9/7/2008, best by 9/7/2013. This is the best dating system I've ever seen, bottled and best by dates. Other brewers please adopt this. Pours a hazy amber with huge meringue-like head. Smell: green apple, yeast funk, orange peel, lemon zest, ginger?, hay, grassiness. Taste: spice cake, honey graham crackers, green grapes, green apple, toffee, more sour yeast funkiness, what I'd imagine hay tastes like. Tangy, soft, medium bodied. This is one is insane, from the ridiculously large head to the ultra funky yeast and the complexities it brings."
"Poured this one into a La Fin Du Monde tulip. Upon a slow pour a huge head developed that stuck around forever whilst becoming rocky and wonderful. The head sits on top of a pale amber body with golden edges. It's only somewhat hazy as I left most of the sediment in the bottle. Aroma is of sour banana right off the bat, followed up by the famous barnyard funk and hint of apple cider. I've hadd this beer in the past but don't remember it being so sour and funky smelling. The flavor is not as in-your-face funktastic sour as the nose, but it does have that going for it. It's sour, but in a pleasing sort of way. Flavors of ripe fruits, Belgian candy sugar, light acidity, a bit of licorice, and it has a nice hop bitterness on the finish. Body is medium (I think) but it's hard to tell with so much carbonation, which gives it a drying champagne like quality on the tongue. I can't normally see my self drinking too many sour/funky beers in one sitting, but this is so delicious I could easily see myself drinking a couple of these in a night. This is probably the most unique of the Trappist ales and it's one that everyone should try at least once. I can see why some would not like, but I for one am in love!"
"Overall: I've put this one off for a very long time. I passed it over for years. I wish I hadn't. It's unreal. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this may be the best Belgium beer I've ever had."
"Drinkable? Oh yeah. This is what Belgian beer is all about. The complexity of this beer is mind boggling as each sip can bring out different elements in this brew. This is a must try for any Belgian lover (or beer lover for that matter). Truly an experience."
"Poured into my Chimay chalice. Pours a medium slightly hazy orange copper with a large off white head. Beautiful appearance. Very big aroma of spicy fruits. Sharp orange zest and hints of pepper. Flavor is tart citrus, yeasts, and mild malts. This is only the second time I have tried this beer. I tried it for the first time early on in my ""beer geekdomness"" and thought it was average. I am glad I revisited this. Orval is truly in a class by itself."
"Orval can challenge the craft beer neophyte, but guarantees to remain etched in your memory as one of the most unique experiences one can have with brew."
"As for drinkability, I would buy this again in a pinch if selection is limited, but would likely pass this over in most situations. It's good, but doesn't scream for me to come back to it immediately. On the other side, this would be a great starter beer for someone coming from champagne/wine."
"Very nice beer overall and quite unique. I'll definitely revisit this in the future."
"Drinkability is good. The flavors are challenging and the abv allows for more than one at a sitting. Very good"
"Drinkability- pretty good. This beer smells strange, to me, but it tastes good, it looks good, and goes down well. This is a very enjoyable beer."
"And one of the finest ales in the world. One couldn't say fairer than this destroyed the ""angel of light"" at his own game. Here... have a taste. Heaven and hell."
"taste is carbonated, sour malt, citrus, orange, sweet fruit, few hops in the end, and some spic, leaves the mouth on the dry side."
"Poured a cider-colored body with voluminous head that died slowly and was sticky and cloying on my glass. A sharp and somewhat pungent hoppy aroma w/ floral notes - for some reason it was a tad offsetting. A hoppy, springy taste on a medium-bodied and smooth, somewhat creamy beer. Fruits like orange, cherry and apple all seem to be fighting in there along with hints of sweet malts to balance it and a touch of spicing. Finishes with a bite on the end; this is the type of mellow yet enjoyable beer I could drink all day while relaxing and watching a New Year's Day bowl game or two."
"The flavor, for me, leaves a little to be desired. I am getting a lot of brett and sourness. Maybe some sour orange juice. There are hints of citrusy hops as well. The beer finishes extremely dry...like a Champagne!"
"Interesting flavors combine with an extremely light feeling body to make a really drinkable beer. I can't believe I had not tried orval until now, definitely a great beer."
"so drinkable, it's a shame they only sell these small bottles. also, quite expensive and not THAT outstanding to keep me coming back very often."
"Poured into an Orval glass. The Light Golden hue with the heavy carbonation and big fluffy head make this a beautiful beer to behold. The aroma is of meadow grass and a hint of the farm. The taste is a drying bitterness with a clean earthy tone. There is a sense of tartness, but without being tart. The body is light and airy. A beer that you wish could be drank everyday. A very unique flavor and aroma that I can't say I've had anywhere else."
"Overall. A very nicely balanced Belgium pale ale. There is a good malt with a delicate but well put hop flavor. The mouth feel is astringent and slightly powdery. The finish is bitter and it last. I felt that the beer finish was inviting me to drink more. The more I drink I felt that this beer had a 3-d complex coming to life in my mouth. I rather enjoyed this beer. I decanted it for almost 30 minutes."
"(rated Aug 21, 2007)"
"I'm a beer novice, and this is my first review here on BA."
"D: A fine beer. I admit that I may raise my expectations too high when I see the words ""trappist"" or even ""Belgian"" on the label. A fine beer, but it did not knock my socks off -- maybe I was expecting that too much. There are certainly examples of this style I like better. I am happy I tried it, and would never turn it down."
"I am happy that my taste has matured enough to really enjoy this. Several years ago I would not have enjoyed this as much."
"I wanted to like this beer after smelling it, but it just has an off bitterness and some tannins that make it less than desirable. I don't know if there are autolysis issues with the beer that lead to the off flavors, but this beer is only 1 1/2 years old and well before it's best by date."
"This is a highly drinkable brew, but I would keep it in mind as an 'alternate', not as my 'go to' for belgian ales. Extremely nice when you want something a little bit different."
"Drinkability: Not very sessionable in the fact that it's a little too bitter and sour tasting. Not that it's a bad beer at all, but not something I would drink all night. Maybe the carbonation is too much? Either way, a good stab at the style. Definetley good for a pre-gamer to start the night. Steep price tag for this (almost 8.99) but it's something that I would maybe consider in the future."
"D: I picked this as my 100th review over Pike Entire and Deschutes Abyss. This is an absolutely impressive beer. I really look forward to being able to try all the Trappist beers."
"Taste: A little tart with the flavor of lemon peel, and light hops. Pretty dry."
"Beeradvocate note: This was the 100th beer that I have rated -- numbering my be different on this website."
"Darker amber pour with a huge head. Malt and yeast dominate the aroma with some clove, spice, and yeasty funk. Soapy malt, peppery hops, spice, fruit, and earthy tastes. Lovely brown sugar/molasses-like sweetness that blends well with the yeast esters. Dry finish. Very nice."
"Out of bottle dragged across the nation from Phoenix this beer was a cloudy orange color with an expansive three finger head of golden Labrador-colored foam. The retention was impressive as the head turned rocky after a while and the lacing was equally respectable. The aroma was complex, ripened fruit, slightly sour yeast, sweet malt and spices. The flavors were unique and challenging. At first it was malty and slightly sweet, then it went bluntly sour and tangy with wheat and yeast. Further developments included musty grain, citrus as it warmed and a long hoppy finish that stuck to my tongue. For a Belgian Pale Ale I found myself perplexed; was it a bad representation of the style or so advanced that I was flabbergasted? The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation a little on the fizzy side and the body medium. After pondering I finally concluded I had to tip my fedora to this one; like my favorite type of woman it was wild and demanding but well worth taking home."
"Future outlook: I'm sure we'll meet again someday!"
"Update 12/3/08: Tried some of the 9/7/08 batch. Aroma of lemon, sour fruits, and a slight hoppy bitterness. Ah, heaven. Flavor is dry with lots of bitter hops. Not as fruity as the aroma nor the aged Orval. But always a fun treat!"
"D: By far one of the most drinkable beers out there."
"Poured into my Duvel goblet. Produces a massive fluffy head with a pale golden color. Smells faintly sour/tart. I must say, I cant pick much out of this beer. I can feel the alcohol heat, and taste a touch of funk, but what strikes me is that this beer is GREAT! I'll have to re-review this beer again in a year or more, when I can do a better job."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. The price is a factor but it is not insanely overpriced so I will grab one every once in a while. The tartness and funk might bother some but I say the monks did not take it far enough. They have been it for a while now so I will allow it. Great precursor to American Wild Ales."
"I realized recently that despite owning several Orval chalices, and having a lot of experience with the other U.S.-distributed Trappist beers, my only experience with this beer has been a horribly oxidized bottle in a shitty bar in Post-Katrina Baton Rouge. ...so...i decided to buy a bottle. Pours an orange-y brown, bright and cloudy. Big puffy white head that becomes creamier as it settles. Laces oddly, head slides around the sides of the glass along with the beer and doesn't stick to the glass at all. Weird. Smells tart, clove-like, withe notes of oranges, coriander. Flavor is similar to the aroma, though with a distinct malt base that's got a bit of caramel and the barest hint of chocolate. Small alcohol evident on the finish. Quite smooth, almost creamy, which is impressive considering the relatively low ABV. Drinks very well and interesting qualities. Yeah, i'd buy it again, glad i decided to finally try it properly."
"D- This beer is surprisingly easy on the palate and stomach. Doesn't fill you up instantly...which is actually unlike most trappist style ales. And with a modest 6.9% ABV, you actually can drink and appreciate each one."
"Drinkability - Very nice light-aged beer, very easy to drink, delicious"
"Will I buy it again? Probably"
"Not as good as I remember it...."
"(NOTE: an even more positive re-review is forthcoming - i love brett now, and this early review does not do the beer justice)"
"Body is light and dry with sour dried fruits such as apricot, orange and cherries. It is very vibrant and crisp, no underlying sweetness or lingering funkiness on the palate. Finish is short and leave you with some red apple flavors. A very tasty and refreshing beer."
"I had this at Monk's Cellar in Brookline, MA and was blown away. The taste was far more dry than many of the other Belgian pales and I really enjoyed it all the way through. There was a clear sour and fruity smell and this sour taste carried over into the taste in a good way. Overall this was a very enjoyable beer that seems like it would pair well with roasted chicken or lamb. Cheers."
"This is moderately carbonated, which keeps these flavors in check enough for you to sip or slug. I gave this a drinkability rating much lower than taste. I love Belgian beer, all styles, and have had it in country. This is one that is absolutely terrific, but after 2 I'd want to stop and move on to something else. You almost need a change (it is like gorging on Belgian chocolate -- delicious and complex, but you need to set limits). It is special beer."
"Afterthought... Make sure to swirl in all the yeast you can coax off the bottom of the bottle. It adds to the depth of flavor and helps quell the alcohol a bit."
"D: Mid to high. It's the aftertaste that kills a bit the drinkability."
"amber IPA color with quite a bit of murk that has a chestnut quality. medium head, very lightly off white light brown phlegm yellow. lace. smell is flemish funk??? strangely. pineapple musky wonderfulness. taste is every pale ale i've ever had. some butteriness, soft citrus fruit, pineapple, lemon grassy with a light dough in the murk. truly a beer that respects beer."
"Not sure why I never tried this, but here it goes. Pours a hazy cedar color with a nice beige head. Nose has citrus fruits, floral hops, musty oak and sour yeasts. The tart and peppery yeast strain come out in the flavor as well in addition to the sugary malts and fruity hops. Clean crisp body with delicate carbonation. A fantastic brew, glad I gave this a try."
"Pours a cloudy medium brown/red color body. Big white head, with good sized bubbles. Aroma of dark fruit(maybe plum?) , hops, and some sweetness. Fizzy, with a floral taste, slightly alcoholic tasting. Smooth taste. Slight bitter aftertaste."
"This is my favourite beer and if I could only drink one brew for the rest of my life it would be Orval."
"Aroma is rich and mainly fruity, almost more like a cider or brandy than a beer, except there is a little maltiness. Color is a hazy honey golden with a very thick and persistent head. Flavor is malty and has a strong apple overtone, plus some bitterness that doesn't seem like hoppy bitterness and is a bit unpleasant. Texture is smooth and just a little on the thin side."
"a wonderful beer."
"D= This ale somehow pulls off the neat trick of being very mild and subtle, yet deeply complex. So long as you can find it in relatively good condition, this is definitely a world class beer."
"D: this is a fine crafted beer, and it really should be enjoyed slowly, but i could drink a fair amount of this stuff, very easily. excellent beer. i can't believe i was hesitant on buying this."
" A must try for any BA."
"Extremely drinkable; goes down easy....along with Duval, what more could you want from a Belgian pale ale?"
"D - Very drinkable, and enjoyable ale. Right up there with my favorite Belgian beers."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth"
"This medium bodied beer has a fair amount of carbonation, which I feel actually accentuates the tartness of the beer. This is a delicious brew, and I look forward to my next Orval."
"This was a very easy beer to drink. Because the flavor was so mild, and there was no trace of alcohol in the taste, it was not at all difficult to throw back. I wouldn't say it was the best tasting beer ever, but certainly worth trying."
"I restrained myself because this is expensive and in relatively short supply, but I'd love to drink about four of these in a go. So dry, and that flavor keeps calling you back for sip after sip. A hyped beer, but lives up to it easily. I'm stunned that this is not a top 100 beer. A true classic."
"Remarkable complexity, so multifarious that I'm afraid I can't fully describe/appreciate this beer. Phenomenal."
"Overall Impression, I found it to be a refreshing and interesting beer with an emphasis towards the bitter and tart side!"
"Appearance is slightly cloudy and amber unless you let the dregs from the bottom of the bottle into your glass then it's abundantly cloudy. Very effervescent with a moussey off-white head that settles after a minute into a thin layer. Aroma is a mix of faint flowery hops, toasted malt, bubblegum, coriander, allspice, and some earthy mustiness that reminds me of an underground stone cavern. Flavor is very much the same as aroma, but I must say that I changed my marks for this beer for higher numbers as it warmed up. As it reaches cellar temp more complex and subtle flavors peaked through and the malt profile while nearly absent at a colder temp evolved into something truly sublime in its personality. I look forward to someday sipping this beer on site at the abbey toasting to the good monks who have cradled this beer recipe for centuries."
"Man, this is my all-time favorite beer!"
"Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. A little bit of a pucker in the finish. Good, but not he best Trappist I've had."
"D: Could drink this over and over again. If this is the belgian concept of a session beer, I am moving."
"This is my first time tasting such a unique beer. I'm glad I finally got around to trying it after hearing it hyped up so much. It really wasn't what I was expecting, based on other trappists I've had, but I did enjoy it"
"D: Pretty drinkable, despite its ridiculous character. Gets better as it warms."
"This beer pours a hazy amber color with a nice head with nice retention and decent lacing. The aroma is spicy and funky. The taste is floral spices, lemon, bubbly Great mouthfeel and nice carbonation with a dry finish. One of my favorite Belgians but really pricey which makes this a special occasion beer. I can't say enough good things about this beer."
"Orval Trappist Ale poured a very nice cloudy amber color, with a very nice large tan head. Showed very good lacing as well. Smell was fruity and hints of yeast and spice. Taste was full of fruit, but also some hints of spice, and sourness. Had a good bite in the finish of the beer. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkablilty was nice as well. Overall this was a nice ale. Thought it would make a good autumn ale."
"This is beautifully made & complex, & no wonder, a centuries old brewery that only makes just 1 brew - & what a brew (albiet dry)"
"Perhaps my favorite beer."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. A great flavorful beer, and you can't go wrong with an authentic trappist product."
"I wish this brew was more readily accessible. It is a beautiful example of monastic brewing and the Brettanomyces blonde style."
"Easy drinking, light on the APV. Just not one of my favorites"
"I won't be back for a third try."
"Pours a hazy light orange color with a bright white, long lasting head. Aroma has some nice citrus notes, along with a latent sweetness. Taste shows some of the characteristic Belgian spices, along with a bit of apple. Mouthfeel is very moist, not to fizzy, and just the right bit of aftertaste. Very drinkable with a low abv. Great beer."
"D: Very drinkable"
"Glad I tried this one. A perfect example of a Belgian pale ale"
"D - This one is very different from other Trappists I have tried. It's very smooth, quite refreshing, and immensely enjoyable. I'll definitely be having more of this in the future."
"Good nice beer."
"Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied. There's not a lot of carbonation, which works well in this setting, as the creamy smoothness goes unadulterated. This brew is a perfect medium between something new, and something familiar."
"This is one beautiful beer. Pours a slightly hazy orange-amber color with a bit over a finger of amazingly persistent dense off-white head. Wonderful aroma, some light Brett funk and lots of fruit esters namely sour apples with other indistinct fruits. Very complex, there is a certain harmony in the aroma so that no one portion is overwhelming. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma but with decidedly more Brett funk. This brew is a bit tart at first then becomes somewhat more malty. The funk really starts to come through towards the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium-ish body, meium-high carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Drinkability is ok, I really don't know if I could have more than two of these. The flavors are really quite complex and unique but I think that if I had this too often of in too large a quantity I'd loose my fondness for it. I'm really not a huge fan of Brett but this beer is just so intriguing that I'm sure to come back to it."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium, but the carbonation contributes to a light airy character. Very drinkable and a shame it isn't cheaper. Phenomenal and pairs well with good bread and fresh runny goat cheese."
"Drinkability - Good. Alcohol is hidden better than other beers of similar strength. A pleasure to drink - I could have two or three."
"Drinkability is surprisingly easy. This is by far and away the most drinkable trappist ale I've had even if its not the best. I could probably have 5 or 6 of these in a session before feeling too overwhelmed."
"Taste was just like I smelled, to me it was a little bitter at first then jus a hint of sweetness. Nothing to exciting like I hoped, especially for the cost. But still another good belgium beer."
"One of the best."
"I have had this beer many times before but never had a chance to review it. Bar none, one of my favorite Belgian beers. I am actually harvesting the Brett yeast dregs from this bottle to add to my current wild yeast culture. I will end up pitching it into a Fantome clone. The appearance of this pour is out of this world! I have never lacing like this before. A massive blanket of airy foam clings thickly to every inch of my Chimay chalice. A rusty copper body dances with carbonation. The aroma is spicy and is heavy with earthy, ""Wet cork"" overtones. The brett is definitely present as is the herbal dry hopping. The taste is slightly tart up front but spicy and sweet in the body. The slight acidity adds a sense of dryness to the finish. A nice hint of peppercorn makes a presence time and again. This may be a little too tart for those who do not appreciate a nice hint of Brettanomyces, but it is fantastic in my eyes. Truly a one-of-a-kind Trappist brew that has layers of uniqueness and satisfaction."
"Notes: I really struggled with this review. I was ready to be blown away by this beer since every other Belgian trappist totally blew me away. I do think that it is an exceptional beer but the quick shift to the aftertaste and the bitter taste were suprises. I can say that it is NOT my favorite trappist Belgian but it is a good beer. I do believe that I would like to try this again. I wonder if some of the qualities were due to some negative quality in the bottle that I got."
"D: Very, this one can be pounded or sipped, its one of my favorites."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer, another fine Trappist offering. Would definitely have this again."
"Pretty drinkable stuff I dare say, were it not so expensive that is."
"It wasn't awful, just not what I was expecting - so I will of course have another one to further hone my opinion."
"This is easily one of the top five beers I've ever had. Kind of acidic at first, then turns to a sweet and tangy taste that ends dry. The finish is so good. Phenols present, complex esters as well. So many other tastes I can't describe thoroughly. Bubbly in mouthfeel, medium in body. Simply pleasurable."
"Notes: I think this may have knocked Westies off the top of my ""Best Belgian Brew"" list. Plus, it's available in the USA to boot."
"Highly recommended!"
"Light golden color with a massive head. Bouquet of different, glucose-free scents including: lemon peel, pepper and herbs. The taste follows the aroma and ends up producing a taste similar to Perrier mixed with tart lemons. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and the alcohol is well-hidden, yet the finish is desert arid. Orval is unlike anything I have ever tasted, but to be honest, it just was not enjoyable. It's possible that I may try it again someday, but only to experience its profound uniqueness. I am a relatively new beer connoisseur, so I may be changing this rating as my palate continues its education in the world of beer."
"D: You could easily throw back a couple of these during a long session, but this one is meant to sip and enjoy. The complexity increases as it warms, so let it sit for a while in the glass. I probably should ahve let this one sit in the bottle for a while and get some age under it's belt, but it was too tempting."
"Bottled on 8/8/07. Pours a bright orange color, slightly carbonated, with a thick pillowy off-white head. Aroma is amazing; quite flowery, tangy, fruity, with some yeast and a perfume presence. Not quite as strong or balanced as the aroma would indicate. Tangy fruits, hard cider, fragrance, some yeast but not as much as I expected. Quite acidic as well with a dry and sour finish. Light numbing on the tongue. Very complex as it seems I pick something different up with each taste. An interesting and unique brew."
"D. Real nice beverage here. Great for sessions. Tasty. Drinks slow, a sipper."
"Very good mouthfeel with some lively carbonation."
"Crisp clean and smooth. Before the flavor is even picked up i am noticing the crispy cleany smoothness. Hops and malt mesh well. Citric zest kicks in, very nice job here."
"Orange color. Large fluffy head. Nose is very perfumey. A floral bouquet. Citrus aroma of tangerine. Wonderful sweet, tart, fruity and hoppy flavors. Very hoppy for a Belgian brew. Mild metallic flavor. Fruit flavor is tropical. There is alcohol in the nose but only a warming effect remains in the taste. Complex mix of flavors and aromas. Overall flavor profile is mesmerizing. Each sip brings more nuances. Becomes more bitter as it warms. My fave of the Belgians."
"Lovely beer, great that it's pretty easy to get to. You can order them at any Systembolag in Sweden."
"As stated before, crisp clean and smooth. Finishes dry. While above the sessionable abv, this is a very sessionable brew. Excellent."
"mouthfeel is amazing, crisp dry finish, refreshingly creamy carbonation, very nice!!!"
"D - I'm usually not too fond of these pale, phenolic, super-fizzy pale Belgians, but this is some great stuff. Expensive, but highly unique and not quite extreme enough to push it out of the realm of decent drinkability."
"D - Not a fan."
"D- Definitely a most drinkable Belgain. I will have a few more of these on hand in the near future for immediate consumption."
"D, notes: A great beer with a great history. This is essentially what beer geeks live for. Quite drinkable. This beer is a style unto itself."
"Hated it in my twenties, find it impressive now. You're never to old to learn I guess."
"Poured into a chalice and marveled at the persistent bountiful head. Outstanding aroma - the standard for Trappist Ales. Holy Sh!t, because this beer tastes phenomenal and needs no complicated review. Definitely give this a try."
"Drinks cleaner than I thought it would at first impression. Maybe not sessionable but very drinkable nonetheless."
"overall, this beer was a joy to drink. i appreciated it more this time around than i did the first time i had it. can't wait to pick up another!"
"Drinkability: Belgians are not usually my style but I enjoyed this one alot. Will buy it again."
"Re-reviewed with a fresh (month-old) bottle. Pours copper/orange with a substantial, clingy head. Nearly opaque, but without sediment. Smells of noble hops, but with significant fruity yeast character. Somewhat sweet and very floral. Flavors of earthy, floral, bitter hops are apparent along with yeasty spices. Crisp, dry finish. Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Fantastic."
"Very good, personally speaking not as good as some others but still very drinkable. Easily sessionable for a trappist because of the quality taste and low ABV."
"I'm drinking a bottle of Orval in an Orval chalice, and I just realized that I've never reviewed this beer. Despite having stopped at the monastery 2 years ago, despite having had it in many restaurants over the last few years, despite loving Matilda, etc. Well, here goes: Orval is possibly my least favorite of the Trappist beers, but it also has to be the most unique. The beer is copper colored and clear, maybe slightly hazed, with a thick dry-looking head. The smell is very complex, some grass, leather, barnyard funk, and hops (Belgian-style). The taste is everything from the aroma plus a little sour. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is a little thin, maybe due to a dry acidic after-taste. I think the drinkability is very good, as I'm interested in the complexity of the flavors. A great beer but maybe difficult to appreciate at first."
"There is alot going on here. I bet I'd find different aromas/flavors next time. A unique brew indeed. I can see both sides of the love/hate for this brew. I'm somewhere in the middle."
"D: I could pretty much drink and a lot - and think I will more regularly."
"Compared to most Yank Pale ales this one is very good and complex."
"D - Once I got past the flavor, I found this Belgian to be fairly drinkable. Maybe a tad heavy and a little on the heavy side, but nothing too overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Wonderfully complex and unique, low in alcohol, not sweet or cloying - what's not to love about this historical beer?"
"This beer pours beautifully! A very cloudy amber with a white head. This beer has very strong smells of spices and malts! YUM! The taste was incredibly smooth with flavors of malts and tons of spices, the followthrough of the flavor didn't knock my socks off but it was close to a 5. The mouthfeel was amazing, kind of like having a icecream soda in your mouth, it fizzed and was creamy! Not something I would drink all night due to a high carbonation level but a wonderful all around beer."
"definitely a staple of the belgian style all around."
"Served out of a 12 oz bottle into an oversize wine glass. Pours dark and golden with a foamy head that shrinks fairly quickly into a foamy film. Aroma betrays the brett, with citrus, cranberry, ripe apple. Faint spice of the sort you'd expect from a trappist ale. Mild but nice. Flavor starts off with tart fruit, again cranberry comes to mind, followed by a rise of some peppery spice flavors with a little bit of a leathery taste. Tartness comes back in the aftertaste. High carbonation in the mouthfeel. This is very drinkable, as it strikes a balance between being interesting and going easy on the palate, and the alcohol is pretty well-hidden."
"I would recommend this beer, just because it's an interesting melding of a Tripel and a Blonde. There are characteristics of both in this beer, and it's certainly worth trying."
"Overall, I'll look for this again for sure. A very pleasing brew that I really enjoyed."
"The quality of this beer is evident across the board, although I'd prefer the banana carry over more to the flavor to override the sourness of the yeast."
"This is definitely a strange brew to my American Micro palate. I couldn't have said it tasted good when I started, but it really grew on me. Regardless, is for sure worth the cost and the anguish just to live in a world of sensory confusion for a while."
"D - Probably too drinkable but would complement food nicely, especially pork tenderloin."
"D- 6.9% makes this a belgian I can partake in without getting overly tipsy. As odd as this beer was for me, I look forward to pairing it with some food. Chops?"
"Edit: Had to lower the taste score on this because after it warmed a bit it had an overpowering and offensive resemblance to nail polish remover; prominent in the smell as well"
"The beer went into the bottle with a rich, thick head that would not dissipate while I drank it. The color was like honey. A nice fruity flavor and taste, and I picked up a little hop flavor as well. The beer felt nice and fizzy on my tongue. I never noticed an alcohol flavor."
"Overall, it is a fantastic and unique beer. One of my absolute favorites."
"A must try."
"pours a deep amber with thin head. Slight hints of apple and citrus in aroma, though very faint.Some taste of apple, but more apple juice than cider, and also dry champagne with a bit of a spicey, tart finish. Very carbonated mouthfeel with about a medium body. Drinkability is fairly average, not a lot of weight to it, though not light either. Its good, but nothing to write home about."
"This trappist ale pours a nice frothy light tan head, with a hazy light copper color. Not a whole lot coming to the nose maybe some mild grains along with some citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is tart at the start and finishes a bit sour. Also some phenol notes in there. Drinkability is good for a 6.9% beer. Not one of my favorites but still enjoyable."
"Acidic bitterness is making this one somewhat hard to love. Overall character is good, but much sharper than I expected. the flavor is growing on me a little."
"Very nice brew. Certain to be future buy lists."
"Edit: The newer beer is perhaps a slight tad heavier, but not to the point that drinkability suffers"
"Wonderfully funky with a blend of melon, earth, fruit and fennel, this smells great! Some citrus, almost a whiff of cola, there isn't much clove present. The palate opens soft, fruity, mellow with honey, fennel, citrus and melons. A shade watery, the fennel note is particularly noticeable here. A touch smoky as well. Awesome stuff, this.4/4/4"
"Cloudy orange with a mountainous head. I always forget to take it easy with the pour. This is one of the best looking beers. Aroma of lemon and orange citrus, pine, yeast and very floral. The same comes though in the flavor. Sharp alcohol bite towards the end. Overall a delicious beer that went really well with grilled lobster."
"note: I bought a case at the Orval monastary which I would highly recommend visiting. It is the most picturesque of the trappist monastaries and the ruins of the old church is worth the price of admission (5 euros)"
"Dry, with a nice Brett taste. I thought the Brett would take it in a sour direction, but it did not. Hops kick into the taste and the finish is quite dry. Light in the body, very balanced. Zesty, crisp hop mouthfeel. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Dry, hay and medicinal is not what I am looking for in a beer. I know people love this, that is why I wanted to try it. Who knows, maybe I got a bad batch. :-("
"To sum: Orval is decently drinkable, if you like it. This is quite a sophisticated and erudite beer and reminiscent of a dry white wine or champagne. Not a good intro to Belgian beers, but it certainly fills a niche. Try Orval at least once."
"This is a nice sipping ale."
"D - I could have one of these everyday and still be happy. Those monks do their job well."
"Overall, very drinkable, but something to be savored slowly. A very nice, well rounded and interesting beer."
"M & D: Tingly carbonation but goes down smooth. I was somewhat underwhelmed by this beer. At first I thought everyone made this out to be more complex than it really is, but its mostly likely my palate cannot distinquish its complexities. Overall, still a great beer."
"Got this one at Tank's Taproom in Tampa. Pours a dark orange with a huge frothy head that lasts all night. Huge noseful of dark fruity esters. Taste has nice complexity of spices, raisin, plum, mild hops, sweet malt, yummy yeast. Overall the beer is very sweet with a slight alchoholic finish. Great beer for dessert."
"Overall, a nice beer that gets better as it warms and more has been drunk."
"D: This is like a fine wine and should be enjoyed one glass at a time. This is a special treat that I hold myself to once a month or less."
"D: This is definitely a drinkable beer. A little lighter than some other Trappist ales that I've had which would go towards having multiples in a sitting."
"D: Overall a beautifully crafted trappist with a great yeasty attribute."
"Drinkability- This beer would be so good with some cheese and a meal, one of the better beers for pairing."
"Pours a brilliant color that is somewhere between dark gold and orange. High carbonation, decent lacing. The aroma is incredible, sweet, sour, citrus, barnyard, with hop earthiness coming through in the constant effervescence. The first taste is dry but bursting with flavor. Great attenuation lets everything hit the palate: a dry, grainy malt backbone, sweet crystal malts, bitter styrian goldings, refreshing sourness, and pronounced but not overwhelming brett flavors of horse, leather, and even slight (but not innapropriate) band-aid. A fantastic beer."
"D: This is a great beer to have a few of in the course of a night. The drinkability factor is high for this one. It would be fun to have a few with a monk or two. The 7% alcohol doesn't make much of an impression, so that is good."
"I'm probably rambling... but try this beer... make sure it's the right temperature... try it with seafood, or spicy pasta...."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, and with a fairly moderate ABV, its not too much to handle. Another nice trappist beer"
"Pours out an awesome hazy, pale orange color with an incredible, fluffy, dense head that leaves a layer of lace on the glass and stays intact the whole way down. The smell is heavily of smoky light wood, lightly roasted malt and possibly some banana. Fruit, spices and malt overwhelm the palate, in a good way. Slight hops are very noticeable towards the end, and your mouth is left very dry. As for mouthfeel, the heavy carbonation gives it a nice, light quality that plays with the senses (b/c of how complex it really is). Awesome beer. For some reason I had avoided this beer and I don't know why (I'm guessing because of its easy popularity and my prejudgments against it). I am glad I finally decided to try it. Incredible Belgian Pale Ale!"
"Very drinkable and quafable, nice full mouthfeel, an excellent choice with food or not!"
"The mouthfeel is very light, and almost reminiscent of a hefeweizen. It's not my the best tasting or my favorite Trappist, but it may be the lightest and easiest to drink."
"Wow."
"M/D - Full bodied and super carbonated. Very easy drinking."
"D: that is a respectable beer, I do not think it was worth the $5.50 for the 11 OZ, but I had to try it, it is a complex beer a little disappointing because I though it could have a little more character, it reminded my of an American cousin the the ""fat tire ale by New Belgium Brewery"" this is not my type of beer I still have to respect the Orval name."
"This one had aged longer than I prefer. I like the fresh, hoppy Orval, however, this one was great too."
"After learning about Belgium beers I was told that this was a must try and I found out why. Although this not my favorite of the Belgium's I have tasted it certainly is a remarkable beer. I can now see why people of this site are such fans. Definately a must have again."
"Update: 2nd tasting, and I've been drinking a lot more Belgians lately. This deserves a modest bump in rating."
"11.2 oz bottle date 07/05/07 into goblet. Pours hazy orange with significant, but diminishing head. Smells of sugars and bananas,and maybe cloves. Very tart and dry. Taste is hard to explain for me. Very nice carbonation feel in the mouth. Light taste that cuts sharply. This was my first Orval."
"The taste at first mostly is sweet with an interesting blend of pine sap, juice, fruity wine, and a light herbal bitterness. It has a crisp, lightly sweet-tart finish with grain, toast, herbs and pine sap."
"A tasty Belgian pale ale that would probably taste even better were it a hot day. I could see it being quite refreshing on such a day. It's not half-bad on a cool, blustery afternoon, either. I'd buy this again."
"This is the perfect summer trappist!"
"The taste was right away spicy and held the way through. It was crisp and clean and had nice bitterness on the finish. Overall a pretty solid beer and will have to try again and not have the bottle shoot up at me like a champagne bottle."
"D - Definitely drinkable, if only it would fit into my glass."
"D - Drinkability is good. The fruity flavors in the Orval are great. Everything in this beer achieves a balance that is quite nice. This is one that I would have again, and again, and again..."
"D- this is an expensive beer and should be enjoyed once an awhile. This beer would be greatwith a surf and turf meal. Goes down with traces of warmth alcohol left behind."
"Drinkability is outstanding, with a 6.9% ABV a couple of these in an evening of conversation with friends would be just about perfect. An outstanding beer - worthy of it's reputation."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly cloudy, orange topaz color with a frothy, white head. The smell is spicy and slightly fruity and a whiff of alcohol. The taste is interesting; the alcohol is apparent and creates a warming sensation. The flavor is spicy and of dark fruit. The mouthfeel is light in body with a sparkling carbonation and a dry, alcohol finish. Drinkability is decent, not my favorite Belgian by any means but a decent beer overall."
"there is almost an overly yeasty aroma and taste taht i keep picking up on. i am not too sure. i wish i could be more insightful, but i feel the way i do..."
"Perfect appearance - orange and cloudy with an inch thick creamy lasting head and since I`m having it in it`s own glass it looks even better.The aroma is slightly sour and the tase is zesty and citrussy and instantly recognisable. Great Beer, I feel privaliged to drink it,wonderful!!"
"It pours a hazy golden with a fine white head that sticks around and leaves some spotty lacing. The aroma is slightly sour, a bit grassy and herbal, and has a touch of lemon and pepper in it as well. The taste is a complex mixture of light lemon, herbal hops, black and white pepper, and a dry, light astringency. Very nice. Smooth and slightly peppery mouthfeel make this a delight to drink on this hot day on my back porch. If it were a bit older and more sour, I'd probably edge the flavor score up to a five. Any way you find it, its worth drinking."
"Drinkability is high, great beer all around."
"D - Overall, a very tasty and complex beer that has a surprising note to it with its funk. This would be a beer that I would bust out with a cheese platter whenever I'm not in a mood for a Belgian Dark Ale. I would definitely reach for one of these again and really for the uniqueness that I haven't found in many other beers that I have had before."
"Overall not quite my style of beer, but it was still good."
"This beer is beautifully crafted with lots of care I'm sure. Although I don't know how often I would buy it, but I'm very glad I tried it."
"D - Not a bad beer, but I didn't care for it. Little-no estery taste and overdone on the Saaz."
"Classic."
"Overall, impressive. Very light, but flavorful in all the right places. I don't know how age would effect it, but it seems fresh even after 1.5 years."
"Edit: The more I drink this, the better I like it, hence the increased score (I started by giving it a 4.1!)."
"Taste is next to Godliness with a rich complex palate of malty cinnamon-spiced apple characters with a long finish of burgeoning hop flavours. It's not really a bitter finish, just a robust hop flavour that makes you look back on the long, winding journey of deliciousness you were just taken on and smile. This is a truly great brew, with pleasant flavours, a velvety smooth and soft mouthfeel and a delightfully complex character. Highly recommended."
"D: Very good, balanced representation of the trappist. I wouldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting, but it's a great beer for relaxing and openning up with friends. I'll come back to this beer."
"This one is a stands out from the other trappist beers that I have had. It pours a hazy orange/brown with a thick creamy head. Nice floral aroma with a funky yeast and citrus in the bouquet. The brettanomyces yeast imparts a wild and funky flavor. Sour and tart with a citrusy and floral hops. Unique and complex, refreshing and effervescent. Medium body and a smooth mouth feel. Tart dry finish that leaves you wanting more. Great beer with a big price tag [5 bucks +deposit] for a 11.2 oz bottle that I could drink a lot of."
"Medium-bodied with some nice carbonation, but I thought it made this a little hard to drink too quickly (which may not be a bad thing, but it's something I have to nurse for a bit)."
"While I liked this beer, I prefer a Chimay."
"The body is light with a very dry finish. Some sticky, yeasty finishes. Overall this is just a fun beer and does change over time. Hard to clone, gush city."
"This poured a hazy light orange-brown with fluffy off-white head. It had a wild yeast and potpourri scent with some hops added in. Its flavor mixed the citrus of oranges with the bitterness of hops and a slight aftertaste of bitterness, but had no malt. It had moderate carbonation, and had slightly thick body. This was pretty good overall, and tasted more like a real ale than any of the Chimays."
"This is the strongest tasting beer I've had to date. Clear russet brown in the glass with a creamy head which dissipated slowly leaving lots of lace. The nose had sweet malt and black pepper. A distinct effervescent mouthfeel which the tast was a strong hops bitter throughout with a flint flavour."
" This is a nice warm and fuzzy hot-weather brew that is complex and easy."
"They also say that Orval has been rumored to have some certain medicinal qualities? Can anyone confirm or deny this?"
"Drink by 8/8/2012 is noted on the bottle. Perhaps I should have aged it more."
"D: It is a bit full bodied and has a high ABV making this brew a poor candidate for a session beer. However, it is a pleasant enough BPA to enjoy with dinner or an occasional treat."
"S/T: Both so complex I hardly know what to pinpoint. Floral, herbs, a bunch of lemon. Super dry all over. Incredibly complex and delicious"
"Incredibly complex through the different yeasts they use, this is one to sit down and really think about. Fantastic beer that is truley amazing. Best of all, VERY drinkable, and for a Belgian, isn't too high in alcohol."
"D: Quite the ale. Why did I buy just one?"
"Drinkability - I think the monks feel asleep during this one, would rather drink a generic homebrew extract kit"
"Aggressive pour into a large goblet yielded an enormous cloud looking head about 2"" tall. Buried beneath the bubbles the beer looked an opaque golden amber color with very little if any carbonation. Unique sort of lemon citrus smell to it at first, later on detected a flowery sweetness and a grassy spice. Tasted a mild grape and apple sweetness with a little citrus bitterness and finished very crisp and clean. I would try another just to see the huge head form that was awesome!"
"Not one of my favorite trappists, but a good one none-the-less, I look forward to my next Orval."
"Overall, this is kind of a mixed bag. It's strong in many categories, but the bitterness of the taste throws it off kilter. Nonetheless, it's still fairly drinkable."
"A light amber color, with a rocky/puffy off white colored head. The scent has sweet spices, corriander, maybe some nutmeg, plus a fruity fragrance of peach. There is a sugary sweet, candy scent in there as well. The taste was very mild, I was expecting this robust, sweet flavor, but it doesn't even seem to leave any flavor on the palate. It does finsh with a strong hop bitterness, though nothing to harsh. The feel is almost like a lager, surprisingly crisp, and very dry finish from beginning to end. I am fairly let down by the taste, everything else was a surprise in this my first trappist ale."
"T: bitter at first, with a crisp, clean-as-a-whistle finish. Dry and more robust than it looks, the alcohol is present but not unsettling and makes for one of the most enjoyable mouthfeels I've encountered in a while."
"This is an amazingly complex, balanced beer, but personally I would enjoy this a little more if leaned closer to the tart or sweeter side than the earthy, citrus rind."
"This is something else. One of a kind brew, bravo."
"Appearance hazy copper in color two finger off white head that stuck around untill the last sip. Smell herbal hop aroma and earthy. Taste same as smell with warming alcohol and a dry snapy finish. Mouthfeel mediem body high carbonation. Drinkability a nice pre dinner beer."
"D - Solid beer to experece from time to time. One of the better agers from my experence. Can't go wrong with this one."
"D-Highly drinkable. Lots of flavor without being overpowering. Very smooth and tasty."
"I have had this sitting around since Christmas. It was worth the wait. I wonder how it would have tasted then. I don't think I've ever sniffed a beer so many times, and pondered so much after each sip. Quite an enlightening, thought provoking ale and a definite world class brew."
"Very nice Belgium pale ale."
"Drinkability: Certainly one of the more unique Trappist beers out there, I'll give it that."
"Drinkability: Other than the cost, I say drink up. But do savor it, because it's expertly crafted and worth a longer contemplation than any run-of-the-mill American or English pale."
"D- What a great beer. I enjoyed this all the way. I could taste the ""class"" in the beer."
"drinkability is decent. the alcohol shows even though it is only 6.9% APV. that being said, this is a brew about subtle flavors and character. overall a wonderful belgian"
"The carbonation was a little harsh, but otherwise it was nice in the mouth. It kind of coated the mouth. It's a good experience, but I wouldn't be enthralled to drink more."
"For the life of me, I cannot understand the low rating by some top reviewers. Great amber appearance into a Chalice, with gorgeous white head. Floral smell with some spice and sour. I think the way this beer transforms in our mouth from start to finish is unreal. There is a subtle Brett sour theme throughout the taste, but the other facets seem to change. Jason said it best; fresh cut hay, citrus, hops. Truly like walking from the barn to the orchard. The dryness of the finish makes you want another sip right away, making this a very expensive habit. Complex and Sensational."
"Ahh, the classic Belgian Pale Ale. Bright hazy golden-orange color with a really large and fluffy white head. Sweet banana and tart orchard fruit nose with yeasty belgian spice. Quite nice. Light, but hugely creamy carbonation fills the mouth with tastes of apples, bananas, and spicy belgian yeast. A classic and probably the most sessionable of begian ales I've ever had, even at close to 7%. Supremely tasty and hugely refreshing. Oh so satisfying."
"I had this for the first time the other night. It was poured straight into an Orval glass. It poured a nice gold color with a two finger white head. The smell was very herbal with hops and fruit coming through. The taste was astonishing, amost like candy. You could really respect the great balance between the hops, berries, and sugar. It has a nice dry flavor to coinside with the other flavors above. It is a crisp refreshing feel on the palate and carbonated as well to give it the extra umph! Very easy to drink, I had it with Nachos and they tasted great together."
"Drinkability: One more? Lets go!"
"Not one of the better Trappist ales I've had. Flavor is a little lacking. Has an odd bitterness which I couldn't reall get past and I'm not really used to in this style."
"7 months old when tasted. Orangey hoppy aroma with notes of sourness/vinegar aroma. Cloudy orange/amber color with a frothy off-white head with a lot of carbonation and light lacing. Flavor a complex mix of bitter, sour, hops with a noticable lambic-type (Brettanomyces) character and some slightly vinegary sourness. Slight sweetness noticable along with the other flavor components in the aftertaste. Effervescent mouthfeel, medium body with a medium length finish with a fairly long aftertaste. Very complex and very good."
"Not a huge fan of this one but I've been drinking more of the darker Belgians and they seem to be a bit more complex and better tasting. Still enjoyed it and glad I tried it."
"Bottled on 4/07, reviewed on 2/08. Expiration is 4/12"
"This is good beer. This beer has a wildness to it that I will have to delve into again."
"Pouring the Orval slowly into an oversized wineglass produced a full, billowing off-white head. The beer is a orange-copper color with some haziness. Spicy, malty aromas are released during the pour and picked up by the nose immediately. There's a pleasing peppery smell, along with some faint fruitiness. The taste is an earthy blend of yeast and a light, bready malt. A light sweetness is present, which balances the hop bitterness. A fruity aspect appears as the beer warms. The finish is somewhat astringent, but pleasant. Bottled 07/05/2007, labeled 6.9% ABV."
"There was a little touch of tartness to the flavor, maybe some of the citrus. I shall definitely have to try this one again and again."
"Orval Trappist Ale pours an opaque, copper orange, with a nice frothy one inch head. The smell is subtle, but pleasant of citrus and malts. Unfortunately, the taste seems a bit off to me. Tastes as though the bitter white of an orange rind was added while brewing. The bitterness isn't good, and is unlike anything I've tasted in any other Trappist Ale. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, but a bit high on the carbonation. Overall it does smooth out a bit at the end, but not a whole lot. This is a good drink and I like that its unlike anything else, but compared to other Trappist Ales this is my least favorite."
"There was almost a marble in its golden and amber blend in the glass with a white brown creamy head. It smelled citrusy and a little rosy, with some hints of maltiness. The first taste was outstandingly bitter and overpowering, with an acrid aftertaste. As I kept drinking, it became fruitier and more enjoyable, but I don't see myself getting this one again for a while."
"Carefully poured this lovely into my Chimay chalice. Mounds of head, about a finger ABOVE the rim of my glass. Color is a slightly hazy rich orange that is filled with massive amounts of carbonation. Smells fruity, bready, and yeasty. Tastes of complex fruitiness layered with some booziness and a touch of hop spice (minimal). Nice complexity and nice medium body. Enjoyed."
"D = A very good drinking beer, very complex, very enjoyable, not too heavy, not too light."
"This is damn near perfect. This is a pleasure to drink and makes any bad day much better. If I could freeze this and ice skate on this then drink it in spring when it thaws, I would. Excellent beer."
"Bottle brewed June 20, 2007 with 6.9% ABV indicated. My least favorite brew labeled Trappist that I have tasted thus far. Aroma was pretty nice but did have a slight off scent of sour milk or something similar (maybe chalk). Pours a beautiful amber-orange with a hazy, but still obviously sparkling content. Head is average size, rock, and only just off white. Flavor of mine was just salty and bitter, no real depth or character. Went down dry and metallicy at the end. It would take a bit of convincing for me to buy this again. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I do not see why this is such a highly rated brew."
"Pours a light gold in color. Plenty of huge frothy head sits on top. Probably over two inches. Smell is yeasty, spicy, and floral. Taste is pretty good. There are some astringencies coming from the hops. There is a huge burst of fruity, floral tastes midway through the palate. Then a bittering dryness on the back end."
"I'm more than willing to finish off this one, especially at a fin a bottle, but won't grab this, ever, ahead of Trappistes, any Westmalle or Chimay, or even La Trappe. I'm going to presume that this is an acquired taste. I'm also going to allow myself the latitude to acquire it at my own pace, which might come at the twelfth of never. Not my cup of trappistes, to be honest. While far different in style and taste, Chimay Grand Reserve, Westmalle Tripel, and Trappistes Rochefort 8 are far superior, as are a number of American Belgian-style offerings."
"D- A very nicely balanced beer. Easy drinking."
"A very interesting and flavorful beer but the cost and alcohol content does not make this a frequent drinker for me."
"Overall, another trappist beer that's definitely worth trying. I'm not usually crazy about pale ales, but I could definitely see myself getting this again."
"Drinkability: It's a Trappist a must try and yes I could drink a lot of these very easy"
"Overall: You have to love the Trappists..."
"This is a great beer any time of year. I can't wait to drink this on a summer night out on the deck. I'd be curious to see what more aging will do to this beer... guess I gotta buy a few more."
"Drinkability- Well worth trying."
"As far as I am concerned, this is the most mysterious of the Trappist beers in that it tastes like none of the others. Poured in to my Westmalle chalice a beautiful golden orange color, with an impressively sturdy white head. Aroma has lots of lemony zest, a bit of barnyard funk, and an almost salty character. Flavor starts off dry and carbonated, much like champaign, then has qualities of lemon, horse blanket, minerals, and a faint hint of pears. This beer is light to medium in body, and has a cool ability to scrub the palate dry with all of the carbonation going on within it. I would love to have more than one of these in a sitting, one of these days when i have the money I am going to buy a case. Inspiring beer we have right here. The complexity is endless with this one. I especially like the fact that it has some funk similar to some of the Lambics of Belgium, and the Wild Ales of America. Although they are all exceptional, Orval has jumped toward the top of the list for best Trappist beer. Cheers"
"Edit: I picked up a bottle of this finally. I'm so glad I did. I really like this brew. It's a tart, refreshing Trappist! I'm really excited about this brew!"
"This beer has a malty flavor, but is well balanced with the hop component."
"D - A unique experience overall and very drinkable if not for the elevated price. Found the texture to be overly thick and needing more carbonation to compliment the sharp flavors."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer has a very fluffy and light mouthfeel, exactly what the rocky head suggests. It is also high in carbonation and finishes dry. The beer is easy to drink, something that is definitely a sipper, but I don't think that I'll buy it again all that soon. I don't believe that it is worth the $4-5 per 11.2 oz bottle. This beer just doesn't speak to me, good but not something I'd regularly drink."
"I really disliked it first time I tried, guess I'm more used to those extremes aromas and tastes now."
"I've had Orval probably 8-10 times over the years and always tell myself I must cellar some... this time I will.. I hope."
"D - Very drinkable but a little $$$ at the same time. Despite the price I could see this in my fridge a lot."
"D- This in an incredible beer. One of my new faves. I will be updating this review when I have many more of these beers."
""
"Pours brilliant orange/amber, clear. Good-sized head, 2 fingers thick, lots of retention, tons of lace. Aroma is fruity sweet, caramel and apples present, some earthy malt as well. The flavors are huge and really jump out at you. No hops traceable in the nose from what I could detect. Taste reflects aroma, lots of fruit, apples, raisins, and some vanilla. So much going on here, it taste like a good Cabarnet. Hint of lemon. Finishes very dry with an alcohol that warms the stomach. Very, very dry. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and carbonated. Very drinkable, but so complex, one is fine just to take it all in. Excellent ale."
"Serving type: 11.2 fl. oz. brown bottle."
"This is a top-of-the-line Belgian pale. Enjoy."
"Time to cross off another one of the trappist ales. First I wanted to point out how attractive the rotund bottle shape is. The beer pours tons of beautiful white creamy head with a nice murky amber/red color. The beer smells sweet of pears and banana with just a hint of alcohol. The tastes follows suit with first hints of pear followed by some maltiness and alcohol and then finishing with a little bitter hoppy kick. The mouthfeel is really creamy and smooth with very little carbonation. This beer is really well balanced which is exactly what I expect of a trappist."
"Had a bottle of this poured into a Duvel glass last night at the Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell, NJ. If there is one way I can describe this beer, it is very similar to champagne in some aspects. The high carbonation and light body lend themselves to this description. It has a delicate flavor that goes with the light, ultra carbonated mouthfeel. All in all, I really enjoyed this beer. I should mention I am not a huge belgian fan, but I really enjoyed this beer."
"This beer is well balanced in both weight and flavor. The yeast gives it good body but it is offset well by the head and carbonation. I am typically a fan of lagers and darker beers but this is definitely one of my favorites."
"4.5/4/4/4.5/4"
"D - woo. Of course this is a great beer. Look at the other reviews or the fact that it is apparently the fabled Michael Jackson ""firing squad"" beer. If you haven't had it do so, and if you haven't caught up with this old friend in a while (like me), give him a call"
"Okay, so it wasn't what I thought it would be. But it wasn't a dissapointment either. I still want more, though at its price in the US, it will have to settle as a beer to have once in a while."
"An amazing beer. There is so much going on in the nose and flavor that it is hard to describe. I highly recommend this beer."
"From an 11.2 oz bottle copped singly from wine and more in west orange for about $4.50, this well-known trappist ale certainly lives up to its reputation as a world-class brew... pours ruby-reddish with a golden tint and an intense frothy head with staying power... smell is caramel, malty, bready with a lingering aroma... taste is wonderful... very rich and thick with full honey flavors that warm the palate... caramel and bready overtones with a distinct honey flavor... crisp, clear, clean finish.. easy drinkability with no bitterness or alcohol detected... excellent brew... slight banana flavor... definitely recommended..."
"Willy from Wanaque, NJ."
"Love me some Orval. This beer has grown on me quite a bit over time. Probably along the same way that wild ales have. Nice earthy and mildly funky tones on there. Robust and fairly thick. I always wish there was more of this beer when I finish off the bottle."
"D- too complex for a sitter but it ain't no quitter. belgium here i come."
"Deceptive mouthfeel - light yet seems fuller. Smooth and creamy, but not heavy. Great drinkabilty - lots of flavor and complexity, but not overwhelming or heavy. Very nice."
"Sour, fruity notes in the first taste pair with peppery spice, hops, and black liquorice. Not a full-bodied flavor by any means, but that's okay The body is of medium thickness, overly carbonated, and doesn't have much of a finish. I can't say this beer is worth the price or the hype, but it does go down easily enough and it posesses a decent amount of complexity."
"cette bière blonde passablement trouble, elle est doté d'une belle mousse blanche et épaisse, elle a un nez des plus épicé, ses bons houblons se font sentir, elle a un gout très houblonnée. piquant, elle se termine avec une belle longueur exemplaire."
"It was considerably hazy, and maybe I didn't decant it well enough, or it was bad. I'll try another later on and update, if need be..."
"Taste is pleasant. A mixture of sour fruit flavors accented with a slight hoppiness. Beer is well carbonated and the carbonation may be hiding the depth of the hop favors. Malt background is equally slight. This isn't a taste monster but rather refreshing."
"D - Only so-so, the beer is too complex to enjoy very much of, and the medicine taste starts to get to me after a short while."
"I would have given this beer a higher rating, but I did a vertical tasting of it and was not so impressed with the younger vintage. I had an 04 and an 06 in december 07. The 04 pours significantly clearer ( as expected ) than the 06. The 06 was fairly cloudy, decent head and malty and hoppy nose. But the O4 was much better. very vinous nose, with flemish tones, but not to strong. the sips proved hoppy and vinous as well. a pleasant sourness, yet a sweet finish with citrusy flavor. Store this one for two years or more for a noticable improvement. unique abbey ale unlike any other authentic trappist ales."
"D- I am probably harsh since this is a style that I like and it just didn't live as far up to my expectations. It is actually good and easy to drink overall but it doesn't stand out to me. I would it buy it much more often if it were more affordable."
"pours a really pretty cloudy amber color, with a big white head, now i may be absolutely crazy, but it smells like the crazy cat ladies house. everyone had one in their neighborhood, the lady who would keep cats all day long, it smells like her house, i could be crazy but thats what it reminds me of. taste luckily is different yeast and alcohol warmness are accompanied by malt and fruit flavor. mouthfeel is full and yummy, drink ability is average. maybe it was the delirium i had before this one that outshines this beer but its still decent"
"(Relatively) low ABV helps this along the drinkability road, but the dry, herbal complexities might be a bit much after a while. I love this, but I tend to want only one at a time."
"D-This is a very drinkable beer, I would consider this as a staple beer if it wasn't so expensive,so it is a great special occasion beer instead.I would love to visit this brewery and the country."
"This Bottle is about a year old, i dont know how i have sat on it for so long. Pours a hazy copper with a huge white head, that leaves all kind of lacing. The smell is slightly bread like, with hints of belgian yeast and alcohol. Taste is complex and extremely dry, starting malty but not sweet with a definite hop crisp to it, and some spices and warming alcohol to finish it off. Mouthfeel is a bit metallic, and the drinkability is good, but a sipper do to the complexity."
"Poured a bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a cloudy, hazy, golden color with a huge billowing white head. Left lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is yeasty with a little hops and a citrus background. Taste is hoppy and yeasty, coating your mouth with the taste. Also there is a slight metallic taste at the back. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Definitely a sipper."
"Drinkability: This brew provides a challenging spectrum of flavors to the drinker. It was enjoyable to attempt to sense everything this beer has to offer."
"Soooo... basicaly a very good trappist ale, more of these please!"
"Poured into my Duvel tulip very slowly. There is a huge plume of head that fills a full 2/3 of the glass while the amber beer sites underneath. The beer is amber/orange color and incredibly clear for having been bottle conditioned. The carbonation billows from the etched Duvel ""D". The head sticks with great lacing as it settles down after a few long minutes. I smell the head as it begins to fall and I smell a hop aroma (maybe Saaz) and metallic brett funk. As the head clears more I can faintly smell pale malt and peppery yeast. The taste is much more funky and bitter than I had anticipated. The sweet pale malt is almost entirely covered up with a literal blanket or warm, soft brett. The finish is then dry and metallic. This aftertaste and mouthfeel effect make the beer quite a unique offering, and although it has a seemingly one-sided flavor profile there is adjustment that can be made based on temperatures that the beer is served at. Very complex in that aspect. As far as drinkability, it is great. As far as affordability, it is not so great. I'll call this a special occasion beer; maybe to serve at a birthday or for New Years."
"The bottle is dated 7/5/07, making it four months old at drinking (couldn't wait). The beer pours a slightly hazy amber with a huge, billowy head, leaving remnants of lace. The aroma has a freshness to it that reminds me of the ocean, with malt fruitiness underpinning it. Orval's taste is of mellow black cherries and plums, not as intense as the American brewed Belgian-style Ommegang that I am more familiar with, but seemingly more balanced. The hops add some bite and the finish is quite dry.The intense carbonation does not bother me and Orval seems surprisingly drinkable."
"First time I've seen the stuff and now I'm kicking myself for only coming home with one. I could drink a lot of Orval, overall. Speaking of pitchers."
"I guess I'm in the minority, but this didn't really do it for me. Some complexity to the taste, but the taste itself kind of rubs me the wrong way."
"D: I didn't enjoy the beer as much as I thought I would, but will give it a second try down the road."
"Drinkability, for me, is quite high."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Very dry in the mouth, exhibiting both bitter and tart flavors. It's fruity, but not sweet at all - it has more of a sour, acidic fruit character. Ample hopping lends a pine-like flavor. Slick and oily on the tongue, with a long-lasting dry finish. This stuff is incredibly easy to drink, and by far one of the best Belgian beers out there."
"The first sip seems tart, and then warms into a more sweeter flavor, almost a sticky consistency, but finished quite dry. I loved it, but I don't know if I would have many more than one at a time. It is quite a beer!"
"Fairly light bodied, and dries the mouth out a bit. A pretty good sipper. I'll be nursing this one for sure."
"Drinkability : A Must ! (drink at cellar t°)."
"Overall: I've been waiting to try this trappist beer for a while now ever since I bought the glass to match it. The sourness is a little too tart for my tastes at the moment. This is a very subtle beer for a trappist but it's also quite different."
"Sure it looks fine, and the head is fine, but it just doesn't taste that good. It is earthy and flat, kind of burnt. There is no complexity and nothing notable."
"Although my scores may not seem to reflect it, this is by no means a bad brew. Just based on my taste I can't rank this one as highly as multiple other Belgian Ales I have tried."
"Pours a cloudy dark gold with a huge head that leaves just a little lacing. Smells huge of fruit and spice. Bananas, pumpkin, some musk and earth. Taste is the same, a bubbly, spicy, fruity concoction. Pretty dense mouthfeel, crisp and well carbonated. I served it a little too cold and it got much better as it warmed up. My first impression was not favorable. I'm glad I let it warm."
"While this is a really iteresting beer, I must say that I am disappointed in my own review points. I thought it would be higher, but the last couple times I tried it, it was after I had had a few other brews. My muddled taste buds aside, a very interesting brew that one could re-review with multiple tastings, which makes it worthy of the fame I has."
"The richness, color, lacing, mouthfeel, was what I'd expect from a belgian trappist... i also noticed the nice sweetness and spicy/raisiny flavors. But there was a flavor in there that absolutely did not agree with me. The closes I can come to describing it is a combination of tar and burnt plastic. I guess it's possible that I got a bad bottle, but if this is what this beer is supposed to taste like, it is an acquired taste that I shall not pursue. This was a huge surprise to me as St. Bernardus ABT 12 is probably my favorite beer in the world."
"Bottled on 7/11/06, Orval pours a cloudy orange/red with a thick foamy head that puffs up above the rim of the glass and stays put. The aroma is crisp earthy and almost metallic, with hints of hops and some dry dark fruit. As the beer warms I smell a nice farmhouse funkiness, what I assume is some Brett character. The flavor is dry, not a lot of sweetness left. I taste a nice lemony flavor, but different from the typical citrus flavors from hops. There nice dry toasty malt flavor with light yeasty funk, more earthy flavors. The beer is very complex and delicious, I'm not even getting past the surface on all the different flavors going on. The mouthfeel is almost gritty, like there is a lot of texture to the beer."
"edit - 8/19/2010... found a stash of these at my local harris teeter that are almost three years old. good luck finds them in perfect condition. i know the brewery thinks that they taste their best at six months, but these babies are awesome. real bretty funk and barn abound with a perfect balance of sweet, sour and bitter. really amazing. just had to add this: if i had to be stranded on a desert island with one beer, this would be it."
"Tastes of sour fruits, a good amount of hops, earth, grass and the "" horse barn"" aroma comes into play on the mouth and is actually enjoyable. Has a very dry finish. This is one hugely flavourful and complex beer, top notch."
"This is my first Orval and I'm really enjoying it, it's definitely not your run-of-mill beer. It makes me wonder why we're not all monks."
"The smell was good, not a lot of hops as this bottle is about a year and a half old but there was some fruitiness and some alcohol in the smell. It tastes dry, fruity with some alcohol, the hops on this have definately faded with age. I hear it is pretty hoppy when it is fresh. It is well carbonated and medium bodied. By the time i was finished, i just wanted another, but i only have a couple so i have to ration them."
"This is the first beer I've reviewed on here in which I did not particularly care for the beer, but could not deny the quality it exhibited. This is a fine Trappist Ale (is there any other?) that most would be happy to drink. It's just not my cup."
"Overall, this is a delicious and refreshing beer. It caught me off guard. Not at all like any other Trappist ale I've had. Highly recommended!"
"A major carbonation buzz going on in this one, medium body - crisp and refreshing. Great taste, this was incredibly unque and very welcomed."
"This brew pours a hazy orange-red color. The head is massive, billowy, firm, and creamy. Lacing is strong and lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of banryard, hay, leather, lemon, tangerine. The taste is of a bit more earty than the aroma with less of the zesty lemon and tangerine notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this beer is a classic, and I will certainly have it again."
"the bottle is quite cool, if a bit pricey, and interestingly sports a bottled on date and a consume by date of 5 years after...i had this particular one almost a year after the bottle date after storing in the fridge. poured into a goblet, this was a clear amber at first that got murkier as i got towards the end of a slow pour...i left most of the large amount of sediment in the bottle. huge, rocky white head that lasted quite some time as bubbles arose in a fountain from the bottom center of the chalice. thick, thick lacing. not surprisingly, this had a very complex nose of caramel, toffee, alcohol, stone fruits...and a lot of general funkiness. taste is mostly sour throughout...somewhat of a disappointment in this all-important area. just a tinge of hop bitterness. light to medium in body and effervescent in mouthfeel. this is definitely not a session beer, but a complex sipper."
"Pours a golden copper with reddish hues. It will be very clear if you pour correctly, leaving the yeast sediment in the bottle. However, I enjoy the extra bite provided by the sediment. I like it hazy and thick. A huge, rocky, foamy whitish head mounds over the beer; head retention is astounding. The head lasts forever, leaving a roadmap of lacing all over the glass. Aroma is very pungent of spicy hops and fruity esters. Taste is very strong and full of fruity esters and spicy hops. Very full and complex, typical of the Belgian Trappist brews. Mouthfeel is dry and thin, with a high carbonation tingling my tongue well into the taste. A very well-crafted beer, simply world class."
"d: Hmm. Definitely a sipper. I certainly would not want two in a session, in fact a couple of weeks in between sounds better."
"The smell and taste are somewhat citrusy. Unfortunately the smell is better than the taste. For a trappist ale, this beer is lacking in the taste & mouthfeel. Overall, I prefer the other trappist ales."
"For the top beer in its category on BA, I was not too impressed. I think Duvel was a much better Belgian Pale Ale."
" This beer was very drikable and aged amazingly well with no hints of oxidation."
"Though not overly strong, this is the rare brew where I find myself wanting to sip and enjoy, trying in vain to taste all that is there. A single bottle is very drinkable - I doubt I'd ever session this, but I'd be willing to give it a try!"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: Damn well balanced beer in every respect, not overpowering in any way, shape or form, just solid in the taste department every respect. It's going to be real hard to top this one."
"Nice presentation, great looking brew with aromas that were mouthwatering- earthy malts, sweet berry lambic sourness and a yeasty tang. Mouthfeel was an explosion of carbonation, very light and airy and tongue tingling. the taste was missing for me- after a hit of hop bitters all that i was left with was a bready yeasty bitterness, and some grassy, watered down malts. I was dissapointed, as the flavors could not even hide the slight ABV present- there are better belgians out there in my opinion."
"Not one I would be consuming regularly, however I would give it another shot, if only to see if the bottle I had was off/skunked in some way."
"bitter with a slight vinuous character. i think i'm drinking this bottle just in time. the malt profile is slight as is the moutheel. this one is reasonably refreshing, actually. i've heard this is a love or hate beer but i'm not sure that's the case for me. i dig it, though i'm not in love. i would love to try it on draft"
"Drinkability: I won't be buying one of these for a long time. I don't think I could have a second even if I had another one in the fridge. I'm struggling through the first one as it is... Perhaps it drastically improves with age, but I won't be trying it anytime soon."
"Bottled on 29/08/2006, it will be almost a year since bottling when cracked. Appearance has a hazy dirty orange with a real thick fluffy head. Smell has a dry citrus aroma along with some sweet spice. Taste is dry, slightly harsh,earthy and citrusy with a bit of hop and carbonation having a good mouthfeel, but nothing that really stands out. Not what I expected it to be in a $6.00 11.2oz bottle, but I'm willing to give it another try in a well aged bottle."
"I only tried an Orval once before at a beer bar. I enjoyed it immensely at the time, but it's even better now where I can concentrate and fully appreciate everything it has to offer. One of my all time favourites."
"unique beer on the whole and worth the experience. I may do some aged Orvals in future."
"A nice beer, but a bit too simple to compell me to always reach for a glass. It does keep its head above water, however."
"Mouth: Dry and sour, crisp and foamy and chewy. Strange hop bitterness in the finish. Bret is more present in the flavor than the aroma. Bitter melon rind taste. Mellows as it warms. Perhaps a dry bramble taste."
"I was able to finish it, though. I hope I simply had an old bottle and will try another at some time."
"d: aside from somewhat strong bitterness at the end, this is a fine ale that i'd gladly try again."
"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this Orval."
"D - For me this is a beautifully drinkable beer, the dryness and the tart, earthy flavors make it a wonderfully refreshing beer."
"Best Before: 29/08/2011"
"11.2 oz bottle, dated 27/06/2006. Pours a hazy amber with a huge, foamy, off-white head that is mostly lasting. Heavy citrus aroma. Initial flavor is citrus, finishes sour and dry. Light body, dry and thin texture, with soft to medium carbonation. Tasty but I don't know how many of these could be enjoyed in one sitting."
"I tried this beer on July 23, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe's' in Toronto. The beer was bottled on November 16, 2006 and was 6.9% ABV (as opposed to 6.2%). The beer poured a cloudy brownish gold with a head that lasted through the entire trappist glass. The carbonation was very evident in the glass. The aroma was spicy and fruity, not as yeasty as an Abbey Quadrupel. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with medium carbonation. The taste was not to my liking. The upfront taste was alright, but there was a lime-like bitterness on the back of the tongue. A very good beer, but not a great beer for me."
"I highly recommend this one as fresh as possible. I've had this beer at almost a year old before and it does not compare to like relatively fresh bottle."
"-Oelergud"
"D: A very drinkable beer among the Trappists, this beer is not as high in alcohol content and is very refreshing. Not as puckering as a geueze but just enough sourness to give it a subtle uniqueness vs other Trappists."
"A truely unique experience from start to finish, which is a rare find. The complexities in this beer are amazing, and it's ridiculously drinkable. This should be a mandatory addition to every BA's ""wants"" list."
"Unexceptional Trappist ale, not meant really to wow, but a timeless recipe and great for cooking and pairing. Try it with seared pork chops, garlic mashed potatoes and greens."
"D: At 6.2% alcohol, this may not be the ideal session beer. Down with that theory. This was great. The bottle was rendered empty before I knew it and I was left wanting another. Well worth the price and I will be buying two or three next time at the store."
"Pours a cloudy deep copper color with a big off white head. It has the aroma of a sweet yeastiness and hops, a small amout of citrus is in there too. It has the taste of hops, starts kind of sweet and ends dry. It is kind of yeasty, but light. It tickles your mouth as it goes down. Love the dry hopping and it hides its alcohol quite well."
"a unique and good beer, quite drinkable, the bottle is gone before you know it. dry almost to a fault though."
"Edit (6/2010) - Looking back 5 years almost since I first had Orval. This beer is King. At it's peak nothing can overcome. The complexities and flavours in this beer are just incredible, I don't know what could make it better. This beer is almost $6 now, and it's still the best bargain in the beer world. If there is anyone on the fence reading this, go for it, the $6 you pay will change the way you think about beer forever."
"D: Reasonable - I'd have another one or two - perhaps a bit overpowering to drink for an entire night out."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot more than I thought I would. Not necessarily a huge Belgian Pale ale fan, but tried this on a friends suggestion."
"Cheers!"
"The flavors match the aroma profile. Very pleasant; high level of alcohol warmth. A touch of candy sugar sweetness. Great body; relatively low carbonation."
"Light dry, and spritzy on the tongue rendering this is an easy drinker and a complex one at that. Classic and so unique."
"While i can't say i'd enjoy it as a session beer i do find it to be a good drinker. The mouth feel has a nice complexity to it, but i'm not partial to the dry finish."
"Orval is a very unique beer, from the bottle to the flavor - there's nothing quite like it. That said, as finely crafted an ale as it is, it's not for everyone. It's my least favorite of the trappist ales."
"At 6.2 percent, easily the weakest (by alcohol) and drinkable of the Trappist brews I have had thus far. Another world-class brew."
"D- Highly drinkable. This beer finishes so smooth that it leaves me wanting more and more. Exceptional mix of flavors that is not overpowering. I could certainly enjoy a few of these in an evening if it was not for the lofty price tag."
"Drinkability - This was plain and simple a joy to drink. An outstanding depth and crisp finish may this a wonderful ""no nonsense"" offering. As the last of the trappists for me to try, this indeed holds a place in the pantheon on great beers. One of my top 20 all time."
"Poured from the bottle a hazy orange color with a large head and good lacing, Nose of yeast and fruits. Sour taste and some citrus. Sour, dry and bitter finish. Very nice to drink and gets better as it warms u a bit, I enjoyed this one and will buy it again."
"The monks can do no wrong. At least that's what Orval has led me to believe. It will certainly be returning to my fridge in the very near future."
"Pours a huge head that looks like whipped cream w/ an orangish color. Smells like perfume. Tastes a lot like perfume -- prettier than it needs to be. Tastes a little thin for a Trappist ale. After you have one, you really don't look forward to another."
"D - An interesting beer that is worth trying. Good every now and then but I can certainly see why it wouldn't appeal to some."
"An OK beer, but nothing special. I more then likely will not be ordering this again any time soon."
"Rockin' Ry Cooder & Getz/Gilberto on the playlist. Poured a rusty-colored Orval into my tastin' glass and watched it take it's precious form. Great color, wonderful head, visible carbonation, and a swirling yeasty presence that reminded me of The Fog. Smell is simple, and sweet. A touch of watermelon and fine malt. Taste is conservative compared to some of the more over-the-top offerings found in the motherland, but refined and delicious. Subdued esters and a nice hop presence. Mouthfeel is perfect, leathery and substantial while maintaining is soft side. Leather and lace. I just realized that aside from the formidable price tag that would be involved, this is a session Trappist."
"D - This is a great beer. My only problem was finding a suitable pairing for it. I think if you match this beer with the wrong food, you're going to lose out on a lot of the subtleties of the flavors and aromas more so than your average beer."
"I'd like to try some fresh Orval sometime. I've read that they add the Brettanomyces at bottling so it's hoppier and less funky fresh and the Brett becomes stronger over time. The brewer said he likes it fresh."
"Orval Trappist Ale pours a light to medium copper color with a thick white head from a brown eleven point two ounce bottle. The aroma is complex, a bit winey even, but I also smell banana and even a little bit of barnyard. The flavor is all these things and more. Bubblegum, banana, wine, funk, it's all here and then some. Really a singular Trappist beer, nothing else is like it. I haven't had one in years, and it's not really my favorite beer, but it's a must try."
"Peppery taste sorda bitter in the after taste.Yeasty and very creamy head. Mouthful is delicate and heavenly very creamy head and perfect carb. and thickness.Good beer very enjoyable and worth the price.I drank it with the company of my beutaful girlfreind and a nice night on the back porch.I will look for this beer again but a fresher bottle."
"Bottled 30-6-05, best by 30-6-10, the slightly portly bottle a classic. Into a chalice, pours a lovely golden hue, lightening around the edges, with a bubbly inch of head to start with. After receding to a thick film, the head is brought back with a modest swirl, and lacing falls in sheets. The aroma, though not very assertive, pulls one into the beer, the hops take on a grassy feel, spice, and noble, fruity and floral but coaxing all the way to put it to mouth. And then it doesn't disappoint. There are spices aplenty, pairing well with the lemon, grassy, citric hops, loads of bittering involved, and are only magnified by the crazy carbonation. The body is deceivingly light, not so much for malts around here, but very refreshing, and the dry finish leaves you craving for either more Orval or more cheese (which I'm eating with it). In sum, while not my favorite Belgian, nor my favorite Trappist, Orval is a hands down classic and definitely worth enjoying every so often."
"Finally got around to trying this one. What took me so long? Poured a nice honey gold into a snifter leaving a short white head. Nice looking beer. Smell is slight hops, citrus...Some funk? Nice! The taste is hard for me to pin down. The hops stand out, but not bitter or overly tart. The funk is there, but stripped down. Not picking up as much citrus as I noticed in the smell. Some white pepper maybe. I like this a lot, and one bottle is not enough. Mouthfeel is full and prickly with carbonation. Drinkability is great. I really need a bomber of this. Does it come in bombers? A repeat buy for sure."
"A good, authentic Trappist beer. Certainly not one of my favorites, but worth trying."
"11.2 ounce bottle, bottled on 1/24/06, best before 1/24/2011. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an orange/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells fruity(lemon, orange, plum and banana), spicy (peppery and herbal/earthy) and malty. There's also other smells that I can't tell exactly what they are. The taste is pretty much like the smell but the citrus taste is the strongest. There's so much to this beer it's pretty hard to figure it all out, if that makes sense at all. Mouthfeel is light/medium, but it has a bit too much carbonation for my liking. Drinkability is decent, but if the carbonation was cut down a bit, it woud be much better. Overall, I'd still drink this again, it's pretty good."
"Fairly stunning brew that really makes a big impression. Too complex to be a regular but one to savour when sampling."
"Drinkability is good too, considering the lower ABV with the great other qualities exhibited."
"D: An extremely unique, interesting and complex beer. It's definitely something that I'll have again but will likely not be in regular rotation. The complex taste makes this a nice sipping beer but I couldn't see having more than 1 or 2."
"Overall, i'm not sure that extended aging (2 yrs.) benefits or hinders Orval. It's slightly different, but not enough to recommend aging for longer periods."
"Though unique, interesting, and one of the better Belgian pale ales I've had, I still can't quite get into it. It's a nice beer, and I'll certainly get it again, but it's not something that I'd want to have too often."
"D- I dont think i could drink more than 2, the citrus flavours really make this a sipper for me, and not something i could go a session on. A nice one for a summers evening where you just want one or two."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a dry mouthfeel from start to finish. The beer is very carbonated but is never becomes stinging. The body seems to be on the lighter side. This might be due to carbonation. This is a dam fine beer and was very easy to drink. I will have this one again."
"while not on par with other trappists beers, this beer is set apart from other beers of the style by the complex taste and originality."
"The first time I had this brew it seemed like I was drinking battery acid. The bottle must have been infected or poorly handled. This time around it was a much better experience. This BPA is a little more malt oriented than others, with esters being only a light addition to the background. The fruity esters are kicked up a notch with the addition of the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Recommended."
"The drinkability for this is as high as it gets (aside from perhaps the cost). The taste is great without being overwhelming, and complex enough that it will take me a lifetime to figure out. Wow."
"This is one of the traditional belgiums that is a must try."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable and truly unique balgian pale ale. Very floral and bubbly , complex and delicious!"
"Notes- A good beer but a little pricey. I will definitely buy it again but I won't buy it all the time."
"Drinks fairly easy, but the older this this gets the better it is. A little too prickly when young. I guess if I ever find this again I need to cellar it for 2 years minimum"
"Well, this was definitely an interesting beer. It's also a bit of an enigma, as I can't seem to pinpoint any definite taste characteristics. I know that Brett is used at some point in the making of this beer, so maybe that's throwing my tastes off. Anyway, it's certainly not bad and actually pretty good, but will be a rare purchase for me in the future. I'll recommend it as a beer to try at least once."
"D- This is pretty different for a trappist beer. Not really what I was expecting, but I am glad I tried it."
"D: Not bad, but not one I'd go out of my way for, especially considering the price. it just didn't do it for me."
"Orval pours a hazy amber with a very large (four fingers) rocky white head from its 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is medicinal with notes of licorice. The taste is also medicinal in nature with notes of licorice and yeast. Mouthfeel is very good filling the mouth with a snappy finish. Drinkability is good. This beer is a pretty good sipper. Recommended."
"Outstanding. Not for beginners."
"Even near the end when warming a good deal, the flavours locked in this beer stay just there - inside. With no body to ride on, it's hard to really taste much of anything. That said, I could sit and sniff this one all day. Smells absolutely brilliant."
"It's generally quite a bland tasting beer in my opinion, and paired with its overcarbonation isn't really one I'd be keen to enter a session with, but is definately something to try."
"Not my favorite trappist, but still an interesting brew."
"Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This beer is definitely an acquired taste but it's incredibly drinkable if you like it. I definitely could go for a couple more of these at the moment."
"drinkability? depends on how much of a weirdo you are. with a suitable pairing for the sourness (maybe a dessert), I could put away a few of these, but there's only so much brettanomyces that one human being can take. it seems to stand up pretty well to spicy food as well."
"D- It is kind of weird. Not to fond of it. To much carbonation. The only thing that I really like about it is the aroma."
"For me, this is truly the Burgundy of beers. Wild, gamey, dry, tannic, fleshy."
"This isn't the biggest, baddest, boldest, or even most extreme beer, but it satisfies in some of the same ways as those kinds of beers, yet it also works well with various foods and for quiet, contemplative sipping sessions. A textbook-definition ""Acquired Taste"" beer."
"This is the best pale ale I've had the pleasure to taste, and drinkability is way up there b/c of the bone-dry finish. It's thin, but I guess it's accurate for the style. Awesome."
"D: Drinkability is decent. To me, this is a beer that is crying out for more hops. The flavors and aromas are pleasant enough, but it's just missing something."
"Taste of Bretta and a slightly sharp acidity, which is a bit too sharp for me and it also has a medicinal taste. The typical Orval yeast is a strange animal that seems to be behave differently every time and over time. The hops quickly overrule the sharp taste and give the beer a nice (dry)hoppy taste that is resinous and spicy. Body is quite thin, but in style."
"Just a great beer. Loved it and will go back for more"
"D: I am glad I picked up a few cases of this. I would have trouble rationing just a few bottles. What a great, drinkable beer!!! My fav. of all time... Very distinct from other beers. This, in my opinion, is the greatest beer in the world!"
"Poured a dark gold color with a very nice head. At first had a light flavor with a taste of a slight banana yeast flavor. It had a moderate finish that hung around in my mouth for about 20 seconds. The mouthfel was good and had a decent carbonation that seemed to fit the beer."
"Looks great, in short. Golden in color, seems to glow when you hold it up to the light. The head is dense and creamy, with bubbles too small to see in places. Smell is sweet but with a bitter note in the background and something like cloves. Tastes peppery at first, but that quickly mellows to reveal the malt. That, in turn, yields to the dry, slightly acidic finish that is a very crisp, refreshing combination indeed. I suspect that aging would only benefit this one, though I've never tried it. Mouthfeel is very good, silky and oily, which makes a nice contrast to the crisp flavor finish. Drinkability is good but the dryness of the aftertaste usually means I only have one of these in a session. I haven't had another beer like this, its really a great, unique experience. Pair it with (as you can at the cafe nearby) a ham, potato, and cheese stew, cooked in the beer, and you've really got something!"
"drinkability is good. nice and light. enjoyable."
"Cheers!"
"Original Belgina IPA? Another one of my first Belgian beers. Still fantastic. I could drink a lot of these...."
"It probably needs another chance. I'll try this again at a later date."
"The bottle I got was bottled on 1/31/06 and I drank it on 12/27/06, so it was about 11 months old. I poured this beer into a Chimay glass and it fit perfectly. The beer was a slightly cloudy amber color and the near white creamy head filled the rest of the glass. As with most belgians, the head stuck around for a while and slowly fell unevenly leaving nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is sour smelling, which matches the taste. There isn't enough sweetness to entirely balance the sour as in some other beers I've tried, but the sour flavor isn't bad either. It is fairly smooth for the sourness. Overall, I'm not crazy about this beer, but I would probably drink it again if it was aged more."
"NOTES - It may be good for some. If so, go for it! But for me- I am glad I tried it, but no. No."
"The head was equally as huge as my first review but this time it left tons of lace. Along with the phenol and grass/hop smell I also pick up some lemon and tart apple. The taste is quite earthy and has a funky sourness to it. Apples and lemon are predominiate with some medicinal flavors as well. The carbonation seems smoother on this sample. Definitely a different Belgian brew which seems to change with age."
"First of all...what a classy looking bottle this came in (this beer was produced on 6/30/2005). It poured a cloudy light brown/tan color with a decent head and some lacing. Even though I poured carefully, yeast was noticeable floating in large clumps. The smell was floral and slightly spicy - very inviting. Where this beer took a downturn was the taste. It was bitter and floral, almost tasted like drinking potpourri. The mouth feel was thin and left a bitter coat on the tongue. I wouldn't consider this a highly drinkable beer, but worth a try as it might appeal to some taste buds."
"Haven't had this in a few years. It won't be another few years before I have another one. This is a nice transition beer for newer ""beer"" drinkers either to IPA's, wild ales, or other belgians. I recommend trying this to anyone. Haven't had too many beers quite like this. To me, it's like a toned down JP Oro de Calabaza....which is a good thing."
"Poured out a nice amber with a good thick, fluffy offwhite head. Nice lacing as the beer went done. Smelled floral, sweet, with a handful of straw thrown in. A sharp carbonation on the tongue that mellowed out a bit as the beer warmed up. There was some bitterness and some hop characteristics, but a typical sweetness to it. A little sharp in the mouth, but otherwise easy to drink."
"Served from a bottle (6/27/11 exp.) into a pint glass, a very nice dark golden color, with apples on the nose. Poured gently and created a huge off white head. At first it tastes very fruity, with distinct colors of apples, cider, and other fuits as well as a twinge of cinnamon. A very interesting after taste lingered after the first sip. The head eventually dissolved into a 1 finger constant, with lacing down the side of the glass. The beer is just carbonated enough, and not too overly done. Mouthfeel was great, the beer just rolled around, and did not want to go down. I would buy this beer again, I just hope the store I go to keeps carrying it."
"Poured from bottle into an oversized wine glass. Wowee zowee this has a damn fine head! It looks like I just made a root beer float! And it retains damn well too! Rocky and fluffy, almost cloud like...and the lacing is nice too. The head just doesn't completely go away! Amberish opaque color...Smell of light alcohol and apples and various spices and a mild hop aroma...somewhat reminiscent of a champagne? The taste is well balanced and subtle...I still can't put my finger on what exactly I should compare it to (apple/raspberry/boysenberry/pear?). The hops are nice and don't dominate but they stick with you to the bitter end (sorry for the pun). Anyways, this beer is light bodied with very subtle carbonation. Very nice, love it and would drink it again many a time!"
"A very unique beer, which I found enormously likable. Could easily have more than one. Or two."
"Drinkability: Tart with nice dominant Brett character."
"There was just something eminently one-dimensional about this beer. I could only taste that one thing, and it wasn't a fresh spiciness or 'complex malt character' or anything like that. It was just, well.. boring, and almost incomparable to anything else. First and possibly last tasting for this beer."
"Strong burst of carbonation on opening bottle. First pour gushes and foams, I wait and pour the rest in one smooth motion. Dense, rocky, off-white creamy head looks too beautiful. I dont want to drink it - just look at it. Light mahogany color with orange highlights. Aroma of sherbert and damp earth near the stables. Phenolic aromas and flavors of holiday spices and juicy fruit gum. Not very sweet though, with a little sour tang. 15 minutes later and halfway through the beer the head has finally settled down to a thin, soft blanket of melted marshmallow with persistent lacing. I used to not like this beer, but perhaps my pallette has matured beyond hasty expectations of big, overly candy-like dark, fruity tasting Belgian strong ales. I am humbled and exalted at the same time. This beer makes me want to eat something savory and earthy, yet not heavy or too rich."
"A fairly complex and interesting beer. It have always enjoyed Orval and would never turn one down."
"I originally had this during a tasting this summer, at that time I was not quite wowed in comparison to other trappists, but recently I thought it needed a try all on its own. Here goes: poured into a tulip glass rather haphazardly a huge foamy head like the top of mount Everest or something, with thick sticky white snow lacing all over. The retention is wonderful. Smells of pilsner malt, lots of nice citrus, hints of apple, light spice, and saaz hops maybe, first beer I think of in relation is Duvel, at least in the nose. Taste how ever is little like that Belgian devil. Taste is crisp and refreshing, bitterness is minimal on this, same with sweetness. I was expecting a little more sweetness toward the middle and finish, which this one does not really have, I think thus it lends its self to consumption in mass quantities, or at least more than one. I feel like I can really taste the quality of the water in this, more so than other trappists, something about its subtleness allows that element to shine through. I also heard that Orval makes some tasty cheese, which I will have to purchase along with another of these. All and all this is my least favorite trappist ale for just drinking, but I have a sneaking suspicion that with the right food it might do better than its other family members."
"D: Could keep it up all night. However, would prefer to drink a different beer now."
"Check out Orval's website while you're at it. It's really cool."
"A beer, that to me, lives up to it's reputation. I think it would have been even better had it aged a little because this bottle was a little on the ""green"" side. A must for any Belgian fan or somebody looking to get in to Belgian beer."
"D: This one is very tasty and goes down ridiculously easy with no hint of alcohol. I could certainly stay with this beer for quite a while."
"Drinkability/notes: Simply superb, one of the best of the Trappist-brewed beers, remarkable in its excellence."
"A classic, and the definitive Belgian Pale Ale. Thank you Orval."
"I liked the subdued but noticable taste of strong German hops. I would rate this as a good drinkable beer, but would like a bit more substance in the mouthfeel....The taste of this beer definitely shines above 50deg. Overall, I rank it second among the ales of the Trappiste Bieres!"
"An interesting, distinctive ale that manages to be both incredibly complex and impressively balanced."
"So I finally decided to try this one, after hearing the name occasionally enough to be interested. I found the appearance to be pretty nice, especially due to the beautiful white head. The amber color was nice, but standard, so the head really did the job of making it a beautiful sight. The aroma was great as well; very fruity and sweet. I picked up a good deal of banana, and maybe some brown sugar plum notes. However, the taste was way different; consisting of some light malts, overly intensive vegetable like hops and the occasional addition from the nose. The mouthfeel was overly bitter for my taste, but the consistency was nice and thin/smooth. I am not interested in trying this beer again, considering I expected much more and am fairly disappointed."
"Overall an amazing beer prhaps my favorite Trappist ive had, atleast over Chimay and Archel"
"This beer pours a nice orange, Autumn-inspired color with a big, fluffy, off-white head that slowly recedes into purdy lacing. Truth be told, there's still some head in the glass and I'm halfway through this sucker. The smell is niiice, reminding me of a rose garden, apples and perhaps a bit of citrus... lemon maybe... The flavor is complex as well with subtle tastes of apple, flowers and a bit of spice, among other things. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, slightly ""snappy."" Very drinkable, with the only thing keeping me from having at least a couple at a time being the price. Well done."
"Overall, a unique brew but not my favorite Belgian ale. And at $6-7 per bottle in the store and $10 at the restaurant, it is quite pricey. I won't buy this again."
"D-Drinkable yes, but as I mentioned, it's not for me. I'd never turn one away, but I'd probably try something different if I had the choice."
"Nose is sweet oranges, citrus, bready, and maybe even a little sour. The taste starts off tart and a little sour then almost turns into a hoppy pale ale. The beer foams in the mouth. Highly carbonated and finished dry. Light and refreshing even with the massive carbonation."
"The final pour with sediment: Disappointing. Leave it behind."
"I gave it a low drinkabilty mark because I dont like tart beers. Other wise a fairly sound choice. This just doesn't seem to be my favorite Belgian style."
"It's a wonderful sipping brew that I enjoy as an occassional treat. A true world classic!"
"If it had been a blind tasting, I would have said it was a rough Cider or a really poor Geuze."
"Hopefully after I have tried more Begian pales, I can make my way back to this one."
"Lots of lacing left on the glass and head retained until the last swig. But that may be due to drinking it quicker than usual; but I couldn't help it. Delicious. Can't wait to have another."
"Perhaps an austere hardliner among the Trappists, this beer is nonetheless one of the greats."
"Drinkability isn't all that great here because of the perfume feel in the aftertaste."
"D - I think it would become pretty neutral after two or three in succession. Overall though it is not bad."
"Ive heard people rave, and I've heard them trash this beer. For me, well, the first sip was an eye-opener, and then I slid into a very cozy comfort zone with it. It's sharp and fresh, and certainly drinkable, if you like it, that is. And I like it, and will again, when the mood strikes, which could be virtually any moment now."
"This time around, quite enjoyable. I like it as a summer / warm fall day beer. Adventurous, wide ranging and truly a belgian treat. Enjoy!"
"In short, it simply tastes Orval."
"I will be haveing more of these."
"Murky orange body with 5 or 6 fingers of head, typical of an abbey or trappist ale. Tons of lacing too. Smells sweet, citrussy, and yeasty. Rather complex flavor, tastes citrusy, spicy, piney, slightly sour, but in a good way. Somewhat peppery and alcolic as well... I like this beer. It definitely worth the hype!"
"Had a bit of a bite to it, more hops than I expected, finished with a dryness. A complex beer overall."
"D - I'm wondering if I got a light struck bottle. The aroma is wonderful but the flavor is just not I was hoping for. I'll re-review this beer later when I pick up another bottle. The place by my house sells these 11.2oz bottles for $4."
"6/14/2013 - upped some scores after purchasing an Amsterdam/Belgium ticket and cracking a bottle from Lost Dog"
"D:Overall a good drinkable beer. Great for a summer afternoon."
"I can't wait to try the other trappists..."
"This is one amazing, unique and uncompromising monster of a trappist ale. A world class offering and strongly recommended."
"Note: this is one fine ale. loved it from start to finish..just too bad its so high priced and very hard to find in my area."
"Opened our fifth and final bottle in September 2010. Like every one of them, bottled 1/24/06 and good until 1/24/11, although it doesn't seem to be holding up too well. Very foamy on the pour, with a consistent fluffy white head. Color looks darker and cloudier this year. Smells like apple cider vinegar. Tastes a little flat, like cardboard or wood; it's like a very weak wine. Mouthfeel is still fizzy and bright. This beer has about three months left in its life, but already it seems to be turning into nothing."
"Only some hints of Belgium yeast and orange. topped by sweet malts. But the taste  wow, just not there. A stringent and soapy blend of two not pleasant tastes. Dry and crisp, yeah, but the drinkability was off the chart, at a freakin $5 a 11.2 oz bottle."
"d: i may have rated the drinkability .5 higher than i should simply due to the sheer fact its orval trappist. in order to drink more than one of these i would have to take a half-hour belching break in between, the bloating effect is so high."
" Maybe the poor quality has something to do in the way the shop handled this particular shipment--but lightning has stuck twice."
"Orval Trappist Ale was amber in color with a large white bubbly head. The head had decent retention and left plenty of lacing behind. The nose is full of trappist yeast with a little malt and slight alcohol smell. The taste was fruity (mostly citrus) and lightly spicy. The body was medium to light with plenty of carbonation. Nice drinkabilily. Overall it is a good beer and I will purchase again."
"M&D: effervescent texture with a mouthful of creamy fizziness, medium-bodied and lots of flavours to discern with patience... Absolutely nice, NOT delicious, but very complex and worth one's 3/4 hour for slow sipping... Compared with my previous note, this bottle shows more bitterness and is not as fruity as the last bottle. Will review another bottle from the same batch in another six months~~"
"Overall, I'm somewhat dissapointed with this brew (although I was expecting a lot after having the other Trappist ales). This stuff definitely falls short of the other five Trappists, but overall it is still quite a good brew. Recommended at least."
"It poured a lovely deep reddish/cherry color with a frothy off-white head. Smell was sweet and spicy. The taste...so much better than how I'd remembered it. This was a damn fine beer. Sweet up front, but balanced out with a certain spicyness that balances things out nicely. A nice beer."
"Poured into my lovely Orval challis. It has a deep orange and light reddish/brown color to it. The head is outstanding, it looks so creamy. The head almost reminds me of soft peak egg whites, kind of like meringue. I smell a lot of citrus, and it also reminds me of the smell of a lambic. Tastes of toffee and fresh bread at first, then quickly moves to the citrus & spicy bitterness of the hops which lingers on the tounge a while after taking a drink. This beer reminds me of a lemon meringue pie. I am a huge fan of this beer and think people should drink more of it."
"[Edit]: The more of this beer I have, the more I love it. This last time, I paired it with the Orval Trappist Cheese and it was a magnificient combination."
"Drinkability - I don't like this much, so it's not sessionable."
"I hadn't had this beer in years and completely forgot what it tasted like. I really dig the flavor. Dispite it's young age, it shows it's greatness underneath. Worth cellaring a few bottles. Cheers."
"Drinkability: My least favorite of the Trappists I have tried, will not buy again."
"D - This is a great Belgian ale. I love the sour kick with is traditional Belgian ale taste."
"The mouth feel is medium in body and is nicely carbonated."
"The mouthfeel is full of body, a little sticky. Clean, with a little dryness in the finish. This was an amazing surprise and a real treat for me, The ABV being what it is, it's exceedingly drinkable, but the actual quality of the beer makes you want to save these for a special occasion. Also, I'd like to come back to it in a year or so, see what's changed. If you live in a place where this stuff is readily available, I'm so jealous."
"I wonder how this would taste closer to the ""expiration date."" I bought this bottle in the summer of '04, along with another, and drank one immediately. I thought the beer at the time too strong, so I cellared this one until now. It is a wonderful drinker, and I'm glad I waited!"
"after further experimentation with Belgian brews."
"This poured a copper orange head with a huge rocky head that clung to the glass all the way down. It smelled very tart with malty sweetness present, ripe fruit, spices, and slight hint of lemon. It tasted smooth and crisp, well balanced with a nice hoppiness to it, the hops gave it a slight bite which was nice. It had a nice crisp dry finish that made it very drinkable and enjoyable. This was a very good tasting complex ale that I would reccomend to anybody really."
"Certainly a nice looking beer, poured into its matching glass. Very little head unlike some of the other reviews. Bottled 4/1/06. Nice hop character and lasting finish. Citrusy, somewhat thin body. Extremely drinkable. I will let the rest of mine sit a while longer and try it then."
"Drinkability/Overall: certainly the most unique of the Trappists we sampled with the gueuze funk and pucker, and odd herbal notes. Not what I was expecting from a Trappist, but glad I tried it, though it's certainly a one-and-done for me."
"A great brew, glad I finally tried it!"
"This is an excellent beer."
"Overall this is a terrific brew. It's better slightly warm...if you order it, have the patience to let it warm up a bit (I prefer around 55)."
"Overall impression: Part of my continuing quest to sample all the classic commercial examples. This one was interesting, well crafted, and worthy of it's reputation. However, with the price tag, it won't be in the regular rotation. A nice Belgian Specialty Ale that was an enjoyable change of pace for me."
"Overall, I would recommend this beer. Very interesting."
"Notes- tons of carbination and a very nice introduction into the world of Beglum pale ales"
"At first, the taste is sweet, but that doesn't last long at all. A nice bittery hoppy flavor that quickly gets replaced by acidity that must be the result of the yeasties or mebbe bretts?? This one's also pretty carbonated. The first bottle I opened foamed big time! I liked the carbonation on it and found that it imrpoved the drinkability to a certain extent. I did not find this to be a very big alcohol bomb although that may be because We spent the whole weekend trying different Belgian style ales so we may have been used to it. All in all, a pretty nice ale and I'm glad I tried it. While it's not going to knock off othe Belgians that I prefer, this was a nice change from the norm"
"Drinkable, but sometimes comes off as too savoury and can be a bit harsh on the tongue."
"D: In a blind taste test this beer could pass for a saison, easy. This beer is a trip."
"A unique, intriguing, complex beer. I would love to try this fresh."
"D- Very drinkable, smoother than some of the stronger belgian ales, which can really be viewed as a plus or a minus I felt it complemented the taste, goes down lightly"
"Dry mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation."
"Overall: Definitely an unusual brew, and one that not everyone will enjoy. However, its well put together and definitely worth a try."
"This Trappist ale would be superb with broiled or bbq'd pork chops and a little apple sauce on the side."
"While I have been rating beers for only a short time, I have been DRINKING beers of all kinds for 35 years. The taste and finish was so good, that I refrained from drinking or eating for a long while after, to make it last. I plan to try another Orval some time soon to make sure I am consistent in my opinion, but as of right now, I have to say that Orval is the best beer I have ever had."
"D: Defnitely the most unique of the Trappist beers that I've had to date, and my favorite, I think. The carbonation is a bit rough on the palate, but otherwise, this is a fine brew."
"I've had this beer a few times and always enjoy it. Flavor is a bit different from other trappists but mouthfeel definately can be a little distracting. Still it is a trappist ale with a very nice flavor and aroma."
"CRUX: UNIQUE AND FASCINATING BELGIAN BREW HERE. Each bottle is an aesthetic experience: well worth the sample. I can remember having better bottles of this brew in the past, so I'm looking forward to my next encounter with this brew already."
"Very dry refreshing beer."
"Bottled in 2/2005. Pours an orange/amber color with a magnificant looking head that leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is floral, sour and bit spicey. Taste is dry and crisp that is highly carbonated, spicey, grassy and tart. This has got to be one of the dryest tasting beers I have ever had. While it is a good beer, I admit that it is just not my thing. It was just a little too dry for me and I didn't particularly enjoy the earthy/grassy taste."
"This is a good treat, but definitely not a session beer. Very dry and fairly high ABV. Overall I'd recommend it, but not more than one or two a night."
"Drinkability: I liked this one a lot. Many Belgians are too sweet for me, but this one was dry, had a real hop presence, and was overall very drinkable."
""
"Beer pours a hazy straw gold, with a thick, thick head. The head stayed with the beer throughout, leaving thick lacing on the side of the glass and chunks of foam on the bottom of the glass. The taste was good, but less than remarkable, slightly weaker than most trappists that I've had. Overall, it was an enjoyable beer. My only problem with it was the cost: I paid $5.50 for a 12 oz. bottle."
"Orval is certainly a unique beer, surprising in its flavor profile, and rewarding in its rapid evolution. I do suspect this is a beer that grows on you more and more..."
"This pours a clear amber with a large white foamy head. The smell is pretty strong with what seems like winter spices,coriander,cinamon, and also floral scents, lemon, and pepper. The taste has a almost sour spicy flavor. Coriander. pepper, lemon, and malt are all present in this beer. The m/f is light and all the numerous flavors mix very well. A damn good beer that shouldn't be missed."
"This is a complex belgian for sure full of all kinds of unique floral and perfume tones. This would be a great summer beer. Two years old seems to be a fine time to be drinking this. Good stuff!"
" Taste is dry, light, and complex. Initial fruit becomes extremely dry, giving way to dirty barnyard flavors. Some lemon. Fruit returns intermittently. Some hops are noted in the dry, clean finish. Mouthfeel is full while it lasts, sterile slightly bitter finish. Plenty drinkable, I must cellar some of these for several years."
"Awesome Belgian. I see why this brewery only makes two beers. I imagine the Petite Orval is great as well. Will need to have."
"D - I've had this once before and wasn't overly impressed. Having tried it again my opinion has changed. Very good beer."
"Interesting -- I won't wait 8 years between bottles."
"-SS"
"All in all a decent Belgian, but for a Trappist beer, I was expecting a little more."
"Ya know, I never liked Orval until this moment. Fairly fresh bottle for American standards, only about 6 months young. Attractive dark orange in color, with a monstrous white head that falls eloquently. Expressive, yeasty and hoppy nose, with hints of flowers, perfume and citrus fruits. Flavor is extremely complex, bursting with citrus fruits, exploding with hop flavor, while remaining very funky, somewhat sour, full of horseblanket and wild yeast flavors. Dry, lingering, incredible and oh so unique. Palate is smooth and bubbly and so fitting."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, with a nice bite and lower abv."
"Poured a beautiful yellow gold with an inch-tall head in my tulip goblet. The head remained a quarter of an inch tall throughout the entire session. Even at the end of the glass, tiny bubbles continued to rise. The beer smelled of fine grass, lemon, and hay. The beer had an earthy spiciness to it and almost tasted sweaty. (Horseblanket? I don't know, I've never smelled one). There was a perfect bitterness to balance out the caradmon, black pepper, and grapfruit. I attempted to pair this with a simple grilled salmon and roasted veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, and zuccini) marinated in a dressing made from Penzey's French Country Vinagrette spice blend. The meal and beer did not contrast or compliment each other and were therefore a push. Thus, I pulled out the gruyere cheese. This cheese was a little old and losing its nutty and toasty qualities, but the beer worked wonders on it. Again, it was not the perfect match, but the hard gruyere actually tasted creamy after sipping the beer. The fading nuttiness came forth, despite the lack of nuttiness in the beer, and the cheese helped flesh out some of the spicy earthy sweaty corners of the brew. I would definitely not try this beer again unless I had a good goat cheese, gouda, or aged cheddar to go with it."
"This brew has an very active carbonation while wielding a light to moderate mouthfeel. Almost arid in its finish, the flavor is citric and bitter with a lemon rind tone throughout the drink. I like it."
"Notes: Aroma is very unique, that brettanomyces really gives it a complexity. Not as sour as it smelled like it would be. Very interesting and good."
"Overall, a belgian classic. Alcohol not really noticable, and seems quite light, i think it would pair well with a nice light salad. good stuff."
"the mouthfeel is light, maybe watery."
"Overall: If you like Belgian beers, particularly the trappists, this is a must try. It is, however, definitely not a beer that everyone will enjoy. I did, but I'm not going to rush out and buy more."
"Final thoughts - forgettable. I hate to say it after all that worry about what I would finally think, but I really don't think anything. It's okay, but not exceptional."
"Drinkability: This is quite drinkable, but obviously no session beer. Drink late and drink slowly... it is exceptionally savorable."
"The beer poured a hazy brown color with a thick creamy tan head into a tulip glass. The head lasted for quite a bit of time. The smell I got from this one is a bit of malts and some earthy notes. Interesting but not overly complex. The taste is a bit sour but also a bit of a hoppy bit. The taste is fairly complex with the sour and the bitter and some sweet. Overall I really enjoyed my Orval and will enjoy a few more in the near future."
"The sour-dry finish is reminiscent of a dry red wine, like a cheap merlot ('sideways' comes to mind). Hops are definitely present, and yeast to be sure, but where's the malts? Its there, just under the sour layer of yeast and astringent hops. This is definitely a sipping beer. It kind of grows on you as you sip it - and the fruitiness (from the yeasts) becomes more noticeable to me. But over all, just doesn't agree with me very well (and I like Saisons - at least the few I've had). Good mouthfeel, light, but not terribly drinkable for the style, imo. One is enough, thanks."
"The mouthfeel is quite cleansing with a medium body. Overall, I found this to be a very distinctive beer that is nicely refreshing. But, as much as I like this beer, I'm not sure how many I could drink. Not really a session beer. The thing that I like about this beer, its complexity, also makes it slightly less drinkable. Not sure if that makes sense. I also think a food match would be challenging [a few cheeses came to mind, but not much else]. Anyway, a wonderfully unique beer."
"Poured with a huge, dense tan head that slowly faded to an island of foam in the middle of the chalice. Nose is earthy, grassy, really quite hard to describe, but I didn't find any off putting aromas in the smell. Color is a murky amber not unlike a darker hefeweizen. Taste starts with a slightly sour note but then turns into a hoppy, dry finish. There are other Belgians I prefer, but this is a damn good beer. A bit expensive at $6 for a 11.2 oz bottle. Because of the price, I would probably not buy it very often if at all."
"Once upon a time I was not a fan of Orval but as my taste buds and olfactory glands have grown to appreciate and even crave sourness in beer they have also learned to love this fine trappist. For me the aroma of Orval is perfect. It is very difficult to describe. The aroma contains a wonderful sourness that is surprisingly not present in the taste. Within that sourness are hop oils, phenols, a perfumed fruitiness and bitterness, quinine, lemon grass, hay, and so much more that I cant place a finger on. Orvals body is light and about as dry as it gets. It is well hopped, slightly bitter, and tastes of medicinal light fruits and leather. I prefer most of the other trappist beers to Orval simply because I prefer quads, dubbels, and BSDAs to Pales, however, I believe that this is the quintessential example for the style. Its certainly the best Ive had."
"After hearing nothing but raves about the orval I decided to give it a go. I heard so many suggest ways to drink i.e. 50 degrees in a glass to bring out the flavors and many others. All i can say is that I was extremely unimpressed for the hype. The head looked almost like that froth that churns up on the sea shore and just stuck to the glass. Taste was not overly great either. For $5 a beer i would say spend a couple extra bucks and get a decent 6 pack, you will be much happier."
"Overall a little disappointing. Probably my least favorite belgian pale to date."
"Pours a hazy light brown to copper color and makes a pale tan crown that fades into an island of cloudy bubbles and a thin halo. Satiny lace clings to the sides of the Orval goblet. Aroma has a sour twang, earthy barnyard funk, horsey. Very unusual flavor, earthy hop bitterness, peppery spice and bread yeast, nearly no sweetness, funky lemon-like sour notes from the brettanomyces, has many saison qualities. Light to medium bodied, crisp intense carbonation, super clean dry finish. These monks make a tasty beverage, will definitely drink again."
"The famous orval bottle with a bottled on date of 6/05 and a best by date of 6/10. Pours a slighly hazy medium amber with a good 2 finger head, OK longevity and OK lace. Earthy and grassy citrus smells with slight caramel and raisin. Very earthy and grassy taste mixed with a decent amount of hop flavor and bitterness - although its an odd flavor, not off, but odd. It is different from the other Trappist ales I have tried. It seems a bit harsh. I have one more bottle tucked away that I will have to try in a year or two. Its not a bad flavored beer, I just think this bottle is still too young."
"D - I don't think I could have too many of these. For me this is something to be savoured once in a while, and not more than one at a time."
"I didn't really care for this the first time I tried it, but I have come to enjoy Saisons and other similar styles over the last few years, so I figured I'd give it another shot. I'm glad I did."
"This was good, but for the price, I think I'll stick to the other abbeys. I would have liked a heavier mouthfeel and a little more malt. My girl friend thought this ale was fantastic...I gave her the rest of mine."
"Pours a dark amber with chunky, foamy lucious looking head. Aromas similiar to a heffe with some banana and clove, alcohol. Astringent on the tongue, has almost a soapy flavor. Alcohol also makes a strong presence in flavor, surprising for a lower ABV trappist. It's good to try another trappist, but I have to say this beer isn't doing much for me; much rather drink a NB Trippel or heffe."
"Initial tastes are surprising and really hard to identify. As I keep drinking and it warms, I really get into this beer, but I still can't identify specific flavours. Sourish... fruit-like... ""wild""... barnyard. Definitely some aromas I remember from living on or near farms as a kid. An incredibily unique flavour. Perfect mouthfeel and a very pleasant aftertaste make this an extremely drinkable brew, even at its ABV level. Looking forward to keeping a decent stock of this -- wish it was more widely available here!"
"Cheers2Beers"
"Overall: Not my favorite dubbel but a good selection."
"The appearance was bad but I did not have a good glass at the time... The color is a lite amber(orangish brown) and the head was very high and dissipated to a nice lacing shortly. The smell is flowery with a hint of cinnamon and citrus. Fumes of alcohol can be noticed as well. Tastes of lemon, spices, alcohol, a little malty. lacking in taste. mouth feel is descent and the carbonation is very good. drinkablitly is alright, this beer would be easy to drink because of no real flavors presented either good nor bad. Not one of my favorite Trappists, thats for sure."
"After not having one of these since I've become a better beer taster, I figured it was worth another shot. I am more impressed now than I was before. Of course, I've become a big Belgian Sour Beer fan in the meantime. Pours a prune juice color with a rocky foamstand that varies between eggshell white and amber-tan, sprinkled with spices. Aromatics of sourness, tartness, muskiness, woodsy, metalic, and oysters. Flavors boarder closely on the characters in the aroma. Low levels of barley (maybe too low) lends an overly sour flavor and astringency. Not enough sweetness remains to balance out the tartness. Some DMS qualities come through that reminds me of an ocean muskiness or oyster flavor. Fascinating, but very raw. The beer is well matured and complex. I enjoyed it although there are characteristics within that I did not prefer."
"- Adam"
"I remember I have never loved this beer but at 3 years old this is a very presentable beer and an enjoyable bottle on its own merits."
"D - If it is always like this, then it needs to be choked down. Not the beast thing I've ever had."
"The taste grows complex as the ale warms. The bready, nutty yeast flavors begin to dominate the fruit, and the alcohol begins to become evident. This is all complimented by a very phenolic - almost buttery - mouthfeel, with ample carbonation to offset the phenols. Moderately drinkable, though the cost is prohibitive."
"Overall, it's just not hit-me-over-the-head wierd enough. If I wanted an easy drinkin' beer, I'd grab a nice Deutsches Bier."
"Overall: Nice aroma, but so much pithiness on the flavor. could age to become dry and citrusy. This is less than a year old so the best thing to do is wait."
"This beer was served in a tulip glass poured from a bottle. An enthusiastic head greets you initially and stays throughout the drinking experience. It has a medium orange/red color and has a slight sediment that settles quickly. The smell only hints at the complex flavor that is hidden within. Each time I raise the glass to my nose, I get something new, lots of hay and other funky barnyard smells. The taste is dry with a flowery hop flavor that dominates the musty and yeasty undertones. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers, but its price and availability in my location make it something that I have to save for special occasions."
"I'd drink this by the gallon...if it didn't work out to be like $50 a gallon. I wish I could get this fresh too, as this isn't particularly fair as a stand-alone review."
"I don't like this beer much in the US but was told to try it fresh in Belgium so I did, and I agree that this is a good tactic. I found it better, more complex. orangeish color with big thick rocky head. smells of characteristic Belgian hops, dry and a little austere, also with some yeast. juicier and more complex flavors. good hops."
"The appearance is auburn with lots of head, however less head than many other Belgian beers. The aroma is vivacious and suggests grain. The mouthfeel is full bodied and the taste is very enjoyable. Wheat is evident on the mid palatte and the aftertaste is mild. There isn't any evidence of yeast after pouring the bottom of the bottle into the glass... I was a little surprised. This is a good beer and is fairly complex."
"Absolutely Excellent."
"This ale pours with with a very thick and creamy head and is dark amber in color toward the top and fades lighter at the bottom of the glass . Very hop-driven, fruity, spicy and the alcohol is very present. The taste is nothing that I have ever experienced from a Trappist ale. Good but not the best I have had. The mouthfeel has an acidic feel to it but overall this is a solid ale."
"My bottle of Orval has a bottled on date of 24/06/2005 (dd/mm/yy) and a best before date of 24/06/2005. Pours a cloudy orange red with a voluminous white head. That has fairly good staying power that leaves an island of foam in the middle of the glass. Aroma has some sour gueze-like notes with some spiciness and mustiness as well. Taste is bone dry and I mean bone dry - think of the driest champagne you've had, and multiply it by ten. Not sour tasting at all, but with a peppery finish. As it warms up I get some more fruitiness. Now I'm thinking that I've served this a bit too cold. Very highly carbonated. A one-of-a-kind beer."
"Notes: Creamy, consistent and just a pleasure to drink. I am sorry that there wasn't more when I was finished with the bottle. But every good beer is like that. Hopefully I will get to experience this great brew again."
"This beer poured a light amber color with a thick and foamy head. It had a good strong bitter aroma. The flavor supprised me, it as very complex, with hints of fruits and spices, over everything there was a very bitter and earthy taste that I found overpowering and which hurt this beer's drinkability significantly, not waht I expected at all. maybe I should try this one again on the chance that I got an odd bottle. im not certain what to make of this beer in general."
"I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. The mild, great flavor wont get old any time soon. Also, the alcohol content is low enough so you should be able to enjoy a few. Great beer. I will definately get it again."
"World class."
"D: It took me awhile to get used to this beer, but now I can definitely enjoy the tart brett flavor it presents."
"This beer pours a clear orange/amber color with a fluffy one inch head. A stream of tiny bubbles rise to the surface of my glass, which looks very inviting. The flavor is spicy and peppery with notes of lemon zest and hops. There was also a sour note to this beer that was not overwhelming at all, but that balanced the sweetness of the malt. I had this beer several years ago and I don't remember it being this tasty and complex. Maybe my tastes have changed. It's an original and is completely different from any other Trappist beer."
"D: A solid example of the style, with its unique hop characteristics and multi-faceted malt tastes leading to something I have not experienced before."
"Pours rich amber with massive head. Did not require an aggressive pour to create a thick blanket of foam. The aroma is amazing very spicy and kind of floral. The taste is drier than I would expect from the aroma but very pleasant. Inhaling the aroma while sipping maximizes the effect of the sweet spiciness. The taste is also kind of sour with a lot of carbonation. This is a drinkable beer but the cost will prohibit most people from drinking a lot of them."
"D - I liked Orval. Without the monster pricetag I'd probably buy it a lot more often. Went well with the moldy cheese I ate with it."
"Had the bottled version of this in a beer tasting event. It pours a creamy looking light caramel color with a good head and lacing. It has a musky nose. The flavor is a smooth fruity to fermented fruity flavor, maybe a hint of orange rind. It has an odd bitter finish to me. Something is missing in this beer, it seems a bit unbalanced to me. Not bad overall and I would drink it again especially with a good Belgian dish."
"Drinkability: I guess maybe I expected much more, considering it's a Trappist, and also that it's around $5 a bottle. Still really good, but I don't know if I'm going to be in a huge hurry to buy it again. Give it a shot, though. I'm glad I finally got to try it."
"A nice beer that is worth trying again."
"Drinkability- Because of the carbonation level it's a tad less drinkable for me, but not because the flavor was bad. Orval brings back nice memories as it was the first Belgian beer I ever had back in 2002. I remember liking it then, but I don't remember it tasting like this. Guess my pallete has really grown from 3 years ago."
"Has a beautiful thick head that resonates a hoppy sweetness. Has a nice caramel color with hints of amber. A very strong lacing. Tastes hoppy, but without strong aftertaste. A new taste for me. Can't figure out quite what it is. My first thought was hints of raisan. Has a nice frothy feeling to it, with fruity undertones of lemon and orange."
"Pours a fairly dark cloudy orange, very warm and with glinting sunlight coming through. The head is massive, and so thick that it almost feels like cotton candy. Leaves incredible rocky lacing all over the sides of my chalice, and maintains a thick covering over the surface for as long as the beer lasts. Aroma is insanely complex. Subtly alcoholic, which surprised me given its fairly modest ABV. Spices and breads are the dominant aromas. Lots of fruits, ranging from the very dark (raisins and plums) through the light and delicate (apples and bananas), with citrus and gloriously rich sweet malts. Incredible. Tastes bready, musty notes of brett and wild yeast. Spicy as well, cloves and pepper in the mix, with lots of fruits (banana and orange are predominant) as well. Long and sour finish. Mouthfeel is very creamy and nicely carbonated. Full and very warming, superb. Drinkability was incredible for a trappist. I wanted to keep drinking these all night. Nothing warms me up quite as well on a snowy night as Orval does. Gets better every time I have it, and is now one of my absolute favourite beers of all time. Flawless."
"Overall: As I stated above this beer was just too strong and bitter, which was surprising considering how sweet it smelled. Maybe giving it a couple of years in the cellar would have mellowed it out and made it more enjoyable."
"Pours a nice deep amber with little head and a little lacing. Smell is aromatic, smells like Oregano, interesting. Taste is smooth, little bitterness and an aroma of cloves. Mouthfeel is not too bad, a little alcoholic but still goes down alright. It's not something you want to take big gulps from, but it isn't too bad and is worth having again."
"Appears a murky orange brown colour with a foamy head and large bubbles. Aroma of cooked vegetables and spices, particularly nutmeg, some medicinal type aromas there too. Rather strange flavour, celery possibly, very complex. The vegetables, nutmeg and also five spice come to mind. But it's also fresh, hoppy, perfumy and a little salty. Fairly high carbonation, but not too much at this alcohol level and temperature. Overall quite an unusual taste, one is enough for me. I'm afraid to say I didn't particularly enjoy it but I'll still rate it reasonably well for its complexity and originality."
"Poured into an Orval chalice this was a gorgeous cider-like hazy burnt orange with an outstanding chunky white head which laced like crazy. Smell was unbelievable, absolutely mouth watering with a range of notes from bananas, freshly cut grass, generic citrus, and yogurt? (lol) anyways, really a beer that I would actually refer to as having a true bouquet. Flavors are refreshing and spicy, full of flowery suggestions, yeasty bananas, and plenty of orange peel. Delicious and classic, the only thing that holds down the drinkability is that I want to drink it faster than my wallet can buy it."
"D: a thouroughly enjoyable brew, flavorful, only 6.2%, makes for easy drinkin."
"I need to try another Orval to see if this is the way it is supposed to taste. I had great expectations but this brew certainly didn't meet it."
"Dull, hazy golden amber with huge rocky white head. Fluffy ringed lacing. Aromas of apple, yeast, coriander, mineral water, biscuity malts. Tastes spicy (indefinite), with bready malts, dull lemony citrus rind, and a biting yeast finish. Alcohol comes through solidly, too. Juicy carbonated mouthfeel, but quite dry overall. Very nice. Easy-drinkin' Trappist ale...can I actually say that?"
"Overall a very flavorful beer with a unique hop charater to boot."
"March 8, 2006: I've just had an Aug 29, 2005 bottle and subsequently increased the taste from a 4.5 to a 5."
"Mouthfeel features a burst of champagne-esque carbonation that streaks across the mouth with each sip. A mellow medium body allows for easy drinking but maybe the bubbles could be toned down a tad. Drinkability is really quite wonderful as it goes down smooth and each sip brings a new realm of taste sensations. I would not mind seeing this in 750ml bottles! Purchased this pre-cellared for me at Liquor Stop in Highland, IN...didn't even look at the date when I bought it. I will be on the lookout for a fresh bottle to try in the near future. Another testament to the wonders of the Trappist breweries of Belgium. This will go down as one of my new favorites."
"A lot of carbonation in this one, which I guess can explain the juiciness as each sip refreshes the tongue. As far as drinkability, this one is good, although the high price for 11.2 ounces of the stuff will probably steer me away unless it's a real special occasion. Judging it based soley on the liquid itself, it is highly drinkable and a real treat."
"I found it interesting that pouring the remainder of sediment in the bottom of the bottle into my glass really rounded out the flavor. So, if you find the flavor a bit disagreeable, give that a try."
"Cheers"
"The drinkability is pretty good, With most of my pleasure coming from what the small proportion of wild yeast brings to it in both the nose and taste. A thoroughly enjoyable brew."
"Poured this into a Watou chalice. Pours a golden brown with a thin head that slowly disappears. Little lacing. Smell is light and a bit fruity with a copper tone and hops. Taste is mildly hoppy, not much of a malt taste, slightly fruity (citrus), a little wheaty, slight hint of alcohol but well balanced. Mouthfeel is good on this beer, very smooth over the palate. Drinkability is wonderful... goes down very easy, very tasty suds, could drink this all night and day."
"11.2 oz. bottle, dated 17/09/2004, best before 17/09/2009, ABV is 6.9%. Pours a cloudy orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, huge foamy head, tons of lacing throughout the drink. Scents of hops, malts, somekind of citrus, floral. The taste is alittle bitter, and sourery, hard to describe really. Medium body. This is a very nice brew, my first Belgian Pale Ale I believe, so really nothing to compare to, but it's totally different than other Belgian's I've had. Would recommend for sure."
"330 mL bowling pin, bottled on 2/17/05, freshness date is 5 years later, 6.9% ABV. Pours into the tulip a slightly hazy amber/orange with 4 fingers of head to 3 fingers of beer. The head is white, very rocky, and sticking all over, leaving 1/4"" thick lacing on the glass at places - one of the prettiest heads I've seen on a beer. Smells perfumy/vinous with rubber glove phenols, cough medicine, and some lemon juice. First sip throws me for a loop. Tastes like a rubber glove. It's like I'm at the dentist. The next flavor is cough medicine, like Robitussin or something, and maybe other medicinal flavors. That's pretty much all I can detect. Maybe some perfumy hops. It loses a lot of flavor toward the end. The strong phenols may be the intent of those monks, but they rub me the wrong way and really affect the drinkability of the beer. I was looking forward to trying this one, but am disappointed. I'll try again sometime to see if it will taste different. Maybe it's better when fresh or when properly cellared for a while."
"A quaffable trappist ale. Poured out to a hazed orange golden hue with a nice white foam head and rigns of lace in the tulip glass. Higher level of carbonation. Aromas of herbs and spices, with some malt in the background. Taste was decent, but far from what I've come to expect from a Belgian Pale Ale. Flavors of hay, bitter malt and hops, grain and alcohol fill the palate. Somewhat of a bland character as well... can't put my finger on it. Mouthfeel was smooth and rather creamy. Overall drinkability is good enough. Nothing special here. There are better Trappist ales to be had."
"Mouthfeel is sudsy, very soapy. Full of bubblyness. Fairly drinkable, but... I don't know. The nose and certain flavors make me feel like I could really like this, but the metalic thing is turning me off. I'll have to hunt down an older bottle and compare."
"Pours hazy orange-amber with a dense marangue-like super persistant head; eventually dropping to a 2 or 3 mm. covering that leaves Belgian-lace on the walls of my New Belgium 0.4 L Rastal sniffer. Strong beading from high carbonation is evident. Dry-hopped with Goldings gives is a floral nose along with interlaced aromas of horse blanket along with medicinal phenols typical of Belgiums. Mouthfeel of champagne with strong effervescence. The play of aroma and carbonation leaves any thought of grains behind. Sweetness only in the aroma not flavor. Quite a feat! Ester flavors of dried fruits, and woody earthy hops and intense dryness, leading to acidic finish that suggest a fine dry wine. Changing with temperatures but best around 55° to room temp. Like all Belgiums crys out for a fine meal to be paired with."
"the legend ... pour this brew from the thiny bottle (which btw doesn't look anything but special) into a burgundy glass and you will know why ... actually the foam looks like the fermentation would be in full process ... besides the looks smell and aroma all in harmony and balance ... drink this one slow and taste how the aromas change over time ... unique ...."
"This is definitely different--I wouldn't make a huge habit of it, but it's intriguing to try a beer so similar to a very dry champagne. Neat stuff."
"Poured a dark orange/amber color into my recently acquired Duvel glass. Nice head retention and lacing. Nose is of sour apples. Taste is of the light fruits with a nice hop finish. Mouthfeel is lively and having the appropriate weight for the style. Overall dinkability is good. I would recommend one tries this brew once but it is a bit pricey to continue enjoying beyond one!"
"Body is between light and medium, alive with soft effervescence, and has a crisp, fluffy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Sessionable if you can afford it...$4.50-6.00 a bottle here in Charlotte."
"Overall, a good-tasting beer, but probably not something I will buy again. If I am ever in the mood for this style again, I would probably go with Duvel."
"I hadn't tried an Orval in a while but decided it was time. Seems to me it is a bit of an acquired taste. Could use a lilttle more sweetness to balance the sour."
"Notes: towards the end of the second glass I started eating some tater-tots and some store brought meat balls. This proved to be a good move cause it showed me how well this brew can go with foods. I wouldn't go as far to recommend anything, but the spicey bitterness went well with what I had."
"Overall, another world- class trappist. Those that don't love it just need to have it with food- that's when it really shines."
"For begin the first trappist ale, I would say not to bad."
"If you have the means, I highly recommend it."
"Drinkability is good enjoyed this one more then normal."
"Drinkability is only as good as taste here. I was truly optimistic about this, but overall I am a bit disappointed in the end. I was expecting more out of this one."
"D-This is a very soft yet complex beer that has a lot of nice flavors. However some of the flavors that are not as pleasant tend to shine through more that I would like. Very drinkable just a bit too much carbonic bitterness."
"Pours a very cloudy orange/brown, big off white head forms, laces well and the lace refuses to go away. Smell is orange peel, yeast, sweet and sour, spices. Taste is orange, lots of sweet malt, yeast, and a spicy bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel, high rough carbonation, tart sour aftertaste. Good beer although not my favourite trappist, although interesting."
"Loved the color and appearance of this beer. Nice orange color with plenty of head retention. Lots of tiny bubbles exploding to the surface. Very fruity smell, almost like a chardonnay. Couldn't wait to taste it. Taste was okay, but was expecting more based on appearance and smell. Not very complex and nothing that really makes you stand up and take notice. Mouthfeel was interesting. Felt very foamy, almost like it was forming a head in my mouth. Overall, a decent beer."
"Pours almost clear in appearance. Leaving a high foamy head. 4 fingers worth in the glass with big bubbles of carbonation. ARoma of grape juice and fruityness with clean crisp smell. Second pours reveals a more golden apperance but stiill with transperancy. A slight hint of orange and grape flavor. Kind of like champagne beer. A very light and crisp taste. Flavor is like a knife to the palate. Extremely drinkable."
"After finishing this bottle, I didn't want another. The weight of the beer combined with its flavor profile was too heavy, although the balance was excellent."
"Edit: ok, i've had a chance to drink this one several more times, and was trying to be somewhat conservative in my early reviews. But I simply love this beer, and see no reason to not give it perfect marks. Wish I had one right now...."
"Very good beer!"
"This beer tastes good, and it's fairly low alcohol for a Trappist, but I find myself actually wanting to finish this bottle and move on to something else. I'll certainly try it again next time I can get ahold of it, and this time I'll open it up when it's a few degrees cooler, but at this temperature I really don't enjoy it as much as I'd like to. North Coast Pranqster is much better, and much cheaper."
"One of the only knocks I could have on this beer is the carbonation is a bit spritzy...some may like it that way. I wish it was toned down just one level and it would have gotten 5's"
"Opinion: All I can really say is WOW! This beer is really amazing! I have had it on multiple occasions, but that was after quite a few beers. As my first beer of the evening, it really shines. There is a really complex flavor and aroma profile that is not done justice after you have already had something else to drink. This is one world class beer that you have to try all by itself to really appreciate. Excellent beer! I highly recommend it!"
"This is not my favorite Belgian ale, but it is still a pleasure to drink."
"Strong aftertaste takes a long time to fade."
"Amazing stuff. Solid orange in colour with a pillowy just-off-white head. Aromas of hops, lavender, and grapefruit. Flavorful grapefuit, complex floral, and belgian yeast flavors. It also has a long and sour finish. Perhaps not as complex as some other Trappist ales, but a real pleasure to drink."
"Overall: I guess by now you know I loved this ale. Love is a word carelessly abused and overused. I truly love this beer. Now I know why it's known for one name, and one name only: 'Orval'. Worth every penny. Maximum respect!"
"I've had quite a few that were left to age, and that made the voyage across the Atlantic and found them to be much more sweet and aromatic. The sweetness of honey, wild grasses, and jasmine all come out as the medicinal taste subsides over time. I like that the ""drink before"" date is a full 5 years after the""bottled on"" date. A really excellent choice, but try to catch one on the back end of those 5 years."
"Drinkability: Not your typical trappist ale, too much like an IPA for my tastes."
"What a crazy tasting beer. Seriously I dont know what to say, the most unique beer of the trappist family, a must try for certain."
"Overall  an amazing beer, unlike anything else. It certainly is an acquired taste !! One of my favourites."
"This is a funky beer, but if you've become acclimated to sharper-tasting beer, it's very enjoyable. I recommend it."
"Drinkability: Personally, if I spend nearly $5 on a trappist, I want a higher abv..this ""tame"" trappist pale ale at 6.2% is a lightweight compared to it's relatives. Overall, nice to try, but nothing I'll be running back to the store to buy again."
"I am very disappointed by this beer. It looks like a winner! The bottle is gorgeous. It pours wonderfully, with a sexy head the lingers -- nice lacing. But, I'm drinking beer for taste -- the looks are just part of the package. Without a doubt this is my least favorite Trippist to date. I'm glad I only have one,to be honest."
"Tasted in De Zolder bierceller bar Bruges, May 2005. Poured beautifully, perfectly presented in its correct chalice. Lovely head over amber to red-brown body. Smell is a wake-up call, reminded me of dank seaweed, very ""different"". Some would quake at this point, but I always wanted to taste Orval so continued. Thankfully it tasted better that the tough smell, in fact its taste improved as I drank the glass. Delighted to finally taste this beer, it is a fairly complex beer for connoiseurs. I am not quite in that category yet, but my apprenticeship continues. Serious Beer, respect!"
"D&N: Wonderful beer and a testament to the Monks who brew it. Very complex, a joy for all the senses."
"Overall a very nice beer. For the price I think I'll visit other Belgiums again before this one."
"Drinkable, but again if this is your thing."
"Not really my kind of beer."
"This is a tough one. After all of the glowing reviews I have read, I found the reality somewhat disappointing. Looks absolutely fantastic, glowing deep dark gold with a massive head, good retention, lacing, etc. Also smells promising, classic flowery, funky, dare I say ""horse-blanket"" aromas. Taste...well...the first disappointment. Dry then bitter, overwhelming anything else that might be present. I also found the palate a little watery, although there was plenty of carbonation, it was course rather than fine like some of the other Belgians I have enjoyed. Sorry, but while it is a good beer, I think it is unbalanced and over-rated."
"I could drink this all night with a great meal."
"Bottled on 1/20/04 and poured into a Duvel tulip. Pours a golden amber with an immense foamy off-white head and tons of carbonation bubbles sticking on the side of the glass. Smell is earthy, hay, apples, cloves, brown sugar, caramel, spruce, really complex---every sniff gives something new. Mouthfeel was extremely dry and tart. Flavor is very complex, with sweet sweet maltiness, puckering tartness, peppery spices, and a dry hoppy bitterness all coexisting. This is a good Belgian, much less sweet and more bitter than others I've tried, which makes it interesting."
"The finish is champagne-quality dryness with a residual fade of funky, yeasty goodness."
"Received in BIF18 from babydoc. Wow! Poured into the snifter a hazy orange with a huge rocky head leaving a entire doilies around the glass. Smell is barnyard and candy, lots of sweet farm aroma. Taste is spices (cloves?) and more farmhouse flavors with some candy sweetness and hops. This is complex and my palate language is inadequate to the task. Mouthfeel is full and there is some crispness toward the end. While this is not a session beer by any means it is easy to consume despite the complexity. Every now and then when working out you have to check your one rep max. Orval is an analogous experience. A must try beer for everyone."
"Not sure I really care for Orval. Definitely an acquired taste, IMO, and I like the sharp tartness of a lambic or Flanders red or the sharp bite of Brettanomyces. It just doesn't seem to work well with this beer. Maybe I'll age one a couple years and see what happens. But for now, I'm ambivalent at best about Orval."
"Finger licking good."
"Taste: The flavor is pretty clean in the onset then changes to a strange herbal bitterness. It was a flavor I was not prepared for. The aftertaste lasts for a long time - so if you like the flavor, you get to absorb it for a long time after the sip."
"Medicine-like phenols were very persistent in the aroma and taste of this brew. A little too much for my liking. I could barely finish the bottle."
"Poured with a huge tan head. I always have a little trouble fitting one of these little bottles into glasses that technically should hold all of the contents. Not just lace, but foam clings to the glass. The nose has a very unusual citrusy quality, strange I guess because it also smells somewhat like sour apple all at once. The malt is way beneath this citrus and pungence in the profile. The taste is different than what the nose suggests.. a warming, lightly bready malt body, citrusy at the end with a slight aftertaste which is alot like the original taste. Orval has a very versatile profile so the food pairings for this ale are almost infinite."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Bottled on 07.10.2004, best before 07.10.2009. Purchased at Green's in Atlanta, Ga."
"It is amazing that a beer can be this full flavored and complex yet delicate and subtle at the same time."
"Idiots."
"The taste was quite bitter especially the aftertaste it left behind which makes this belgian classic a bit more difficult to consume large amounts of. But still overall its a great trappist beer which I would recommend to all especially those who like bitter beers."
"Overall, Id pick Orval as my favorite Belgian Pale Ale. I usually prefer the darker ales, but this beer definitely stands out above the pale crowd! Those monks have learned a few things about brewing in the last 900 years!"
"Another beer that does not live up to the hype. Poured a pale copper. The head was thick and faomy, but oddly unappealling to me. Incredibly sticky and stubborn lace. there was nothing distinctive either positive or negative about the aroma. The malts were very mild, and the other flavor rearing its head was dried apples that came across as sour ""cider."" On the positive side, the overall mouthfeel was crisp. Overall, I was not very interested in this beer and found it kind of a turnoff."
"Murky, yeasty tanned amber. Big active head, exceptional looking white froth. Honey and floral lavender nose. Dry, herbal and less sparkling than I expected. Somewhat hot alcohol throaty feel but it smooths out fairly quickly. There is some residual slick feeling that then dies off quickly. Not too smooth and it doesn't strike me as being extremely versatile. It reminds me of Duvel, but I like Duvel a lot more than this."
"Delicious. Orval is a beer I wish I had tried before, and wish I had more of. Pours an amber/orange, with a slight haze. Large, fluffy, big bubble head that leaves sticky lace on the chalice. Smells of sweet malts, sour lambic-like smell, lemon, grass and butter. Taste has a subdued sweetness, with a blend of bitterness. Kinda generic. Basically, very well balanced, with bitterness leading. Sweetness from malts, butter, and a dry candy. Bitterness from grass, hay, lemons, the lambic sourness, and a bit of veggie. Mouthfeel is like a dry wine. An excellent beer. One I will be buying as soon as I find it again."
"Drinkability: Well, it's crisp and refreshing, I guess. I don't know, for all the hype, there's not much to this one. I don't know if I'll be back."
"Bottled 15/7/03, served in a tulip glass. Impressive pour, orange-amber, with a huge white head that held up well over time. Pleasant odor (tiny hint of citrus?). Complex flavor; more of a hoppy, bitter character than I'm used to with Belgians, plus a touch of sour lemon. Definitely a dry, clean aftertaste. Don't know how this beer is fresh, but it has stood the test of time in the almost 2 years since it was bottled."
"Nice medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This one has great drinkability, but the complexity compels you to sip it. The abv makes this one a decent session beer."
"Flavor is slightly sweet slightly sour with just a touch of bitterness on the finish. nicely balanced."
"This is a good beer, but keep your mind open when you try it. It isn't like other sweet Belgian beers. At all."
"This is really one of my favourite beers. And one of the best Trappist beers. It pours out a beautiful amber coloured beer with a nice head. If it is poured in the one and only Orval glass of course. The smell is quite unique. A very sour and malty smell. But that is not how the beer tastes. It has a very dry taste. I recognised malt and a sort of dry bitterness, not really sour. In all its simplicity, it is a very rich beer. It has a unique aroma. An aroma I cant recognise in any other Trappist. Although it only has an alcohol percentage of 6.2%, It tastes like it is stronger. And it can be very dangerous when over consumed. The Orval beer is a very distinctive beer. Not only because of the unique taste, but also because of the unique shape of the bottle. At the moment I am enjoying a crate of them and I just cant get enough of them."
"A medium bodied ale with an enjoyable dryness, and a unique medicinal taste (from the phenols?). Feels moderate to high in carbonation which lends to the dry finish. This beer became more enjoyable as it warmed up, and my palette adjusted."
"Had a much fresher bottle in amsterdam, was like a totally different beer. So much more flavour, tasted so fresh, was only bottled a month or so. I have heard of people aging this for 5-10years but I don't see the point to be honest, the bottle I had on my first encounter was pretty bland and a bit dull but the second (any many there after) was superb."
"Holy shit! What an amazing beer. The driest. So complex. It's been almost ten years since I had Orval, it's better than I remembered."
"Huge, schizoid, steroid-jacked plume of froth that sticks and laces in a grand way. Light orange to a tumescent amber hue with just a bit of haze and constant action. Orange peel, lemon zest, and cut grass notes on nose. Carbonation jumps on and all over the mouth, but followed by an almost vacuous tinny malt flavor with some light fruity undertones of chalky grapefruit and pear. Middling = over-carbonation takes points off."
"Very complex, but still extremely drinkable. One of my favorite of the Trappist beers."
"This is the beer I buy for myself and keep to myself as a special treat, because of its distinctive flavor, and the wallop it packs in alcohol content. Orval has a rich, thick head that you could almost recognize just by looking at it, without seeing the label. The flavor is dry, with extremely strong, somewhat fruity maltiness that borders on chalky (in a good way!)"
"Pours a light golden color with a large amount of head which takes much time to settle. The smell is pungent, mostly with fruits especially that of apricots. Like COASTERFREAK75 said, the smell of alcohol is also prevalent although it is pretty well covered up. The taste is fruity, but the alcohol taste takes hold as the drink goes down. This makes it much less smooth, and makes you take your time between sips. It also lingers for a long time after the beer is swallowed with the same alcohol-heavy taste. Any fan of a strong-flavored drink will enjoy this... especially the hops-heavy pale ale lovers out there..."
"All and all a good Trappist at best, still well worth a try but not the best."
"This brew is a sunset orange color, quite a sizable cream head on the top. Fair amount of lace. Sweet bubblegum on nose, bananas, hints of lemon. Fairly light bodied, sweet light malt front dusted with lemon, plently of a nice mix of spiciness and sweetness. Big hop presence. Quite a complex brew, certainly worth trying."
"Hazy copper to orange color with a thick off-white head. The head is composed of huge bubbles that give way to a clumpy head. The aroma is reminiscent of apples and pears. There is a spiciness there too. Mild nutmeg is backed by a light doughy scent. The flavor has more of the apples and pears. The spiciness comes through in the taste, but has more clove character. The fruit is still there, definitely pears now, and backed by grapefruit. A little bit of fig sweetness on the finish. This has a tartness and a slick mouth feel I wasnt expecting. Very nice, extremely drinkable."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours into my goblet a bright clear amber with a frothy head which sticks to the side of the glass. The aroma is malty but without the medicinal smell of many belgians. The taste is earthy, grainy, and very dry. It has a bitter astringent aftertaste, but no hop flavor or aroma. The flavor is phenolic as usual among Belgians. The mouthfeel is also a disappointment with very high carbonation and a medium light body. Overall I don't think this beer lived up to the hype around it, or even its appearance and good aroma. An interesting beer that is not so bad, but not all that great either."
"This beer has grabbed my curiosity for awhile, but I never fessed the loot to grab it in favor of IPA's...etc. Thanks to Tinustime for the well priced bottle. Pours cloudy straw yellow into my miami dolphins tapered mini beer glass. The head is huge and foamy and holds steady. Aroma is sweet & sour - full of apples, almost burning, but not in an alcohol way - more acidic. Very nice. The taste is very unique. Not alot of malt here, or even hop flavor really. There is a ton of hop dryness and bitterness. It's as if the beer dries up before I get a chance to taste it. This is the definition of ""clean"". mouthfeel is quick and dry, making this pretty drinkable....very unique ale...and quite refreshing."
"Really great, really tasty."
"A dry, dry, dry belgian. Pours with a very nice golden hue, with thick and lasting head. This beer almost glows in the glass. Good lacing as well. Aroma is slightly citruisy and peppery. Taste is dry, dry, dry. It's hard for me to pick up other flavors going around. I do pick up a touch of pepper in here as well. Mouthfeel is thin and overcarbonated. Tiny bubbles of carbonation rest on the head of this beer. Not one of the best beers out there, IMHO."
"This is such a subtle Belgian, I would recommend it only to those just starting out trying the style. Most certainly, I would recommend this as the first beer of the night because, it would be hard to appreciate it after a couple other bigger beers."
"Haven't had many Trappists yet and this is my first to review, so my palate is not quite yet accustomed to this style of beer. May have to edit review once I delve deeper into the Trappist family."
"A gorgeous beer, utterly unique and extremely tasty. I just wish it were cheaper."
"Comments: This has been my favorite Belgian for nearly as long as I've been aware of the country's beers -- I've delayed reviewing it for so long out of fear of not doing it justice. I'd just like to add that I would love to taste more hoppy beers which utilise wild yeast strains. Oh Brettanomyces, what can't you do?"
"The beer erupted into a large frothy white head regardless of the careful pour. The foam refused to subdue itself, but created little dimples in the surface. The smell was the first thing that hit me as I popped open the cap. It smelled and sounded like a sparkling champagne, even tasted a bit like one. Also in the smell was something that seems to be lacking altogether in many Belgians... hops! It is by no means a hop monster, though, as the malt character clearly shows through in both the smell and taste as well. This beer is perfectly balanced between maltiness and hoppiness, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is so incredibly smooth I can't wait to take another drink. The finish is slightly dry and reveals a bit of alcohol even though is not a very huge beer at 6.9% (according to the label). As I said before, drinkability is off the charts. If you ever get a chance, buy some. I can't believe this is one of the last trappist ales I've tried. If Westy 8 and 12 can live up to their hype, I think I will have reached beer nirvana if they are better than this."
"This is a great taste of history."
"This poured copper, with a thick head that retained and left soft peaks, yep, just as a fine meringue, beautiful!, smell was complex and fruity, lemon and other indistinguishable fruit, maybe some apple pie as well, nice crisp tart taste, again some lemon taste, rich and complex, smooth finish, fruity notes, mouthfeel presents as well carbonated, crisp, and a bit creamy on the finish, drinkability is Fantastic!, not a session brew, but one to be savored, truly a great beer, class all the way!"
"As part of a session tonight, this one stood out. This was such a simple, pure beer. Nothing about it was meant to be overboard or in your face, like most new school American beers. The balance achieved in this fine ale is absolute bliss for the senses. I only bought one, and I am kicking myself for it now. Brilliance. Sheer brilliance."
"11.2oz pours cloudy light brown with a big foamy tan head. Mix of banana and stale urine in the aroma. I don't even want to drink it, but I will. High carbonation and creaminess in the mouthful, taste is similar to the aroma, with some spices and noticible alcohol. Some stale sourness. Very rough. Is it possible I got a bad bottle? Are my tastebuds off tonight? I haven't read any other reviews of this yet - if I'm way off from others then perhaps I've got a dud on my hands. Either that or this REALLY isn't my thing."
"Pours a bright golden orange color with a huge frothy head that leaves a nice lace. It is quite clear from looking at this beer that there is a ton carbonation from this brew, as the bubbles don't stop shooting up. Aromas are a mix of citrus lemony tones, and acetic almost cat piss like funk. There is also some interesting barnyard aromas. Flavors start off very spritzy to this brew with an in your face carbonation that just explodes on the pallate. There's a heavy dosage of lemony citrus flavors with hints of spice. Following there is a yeasty estery like flavor that brings about quite a dryness to this beer. There is a decent acidic punch throughout this beer which just a light dosage of maltiness and a slight sugary sweetness. Overall this brew was very spritzy and citrusy but of all the trappists probably one of my least favorite."
"There is something mysterious and unreal about this beer. When I drank it, something made me keep on thinking of spiders. It had a creepiness that tried to scare me off. Then I had nightmares after going to sleep, which is extremely rare for me. I think there is some kind of a curse on this beer. Seriously."
"Good carbonation and light to medium body. I would have liked a little more body to this one."
"330mL brown bottle with bottled on and best before dates clearly stamped on the label."
"Mouthfeel is creamy but not heavy, slick but tempered with a sharp carbonation. Very drinkable for a Trappist. Bottle dated 10/24/2002, so just over a two-year-old sample."
"11.2 ounce classic heavy glass bottle. ""Bottled on 10-04-04"" "Best before 10-03-09"" Fantastic pour, leaves a huge head which slowly morphs to a rocky, puffy 1/4 inch irregular head, leaves truly world class lacing, at once wispy,puffy and very clinging. Orangy amber,cloudy. Nose is tropical fruit and a bit of pepper. Silky smooth, drying and light. Notes of pepper, yeast nuttyness, ripe fruits,anise.. Quite hoppy in the mid section and all along the finish. Dry with a pine undertone. Wonderful creation in brewing. The allmost 7% nowhere to be found on the tongue. Head explodes and slowly recedes, yet the brew is very soft and not at all prickly on the tongue. Wish I had more of this stuff, or the will power to put some away for a few years."
"When I was first told about a hoppy belgian brew i was very excited until i thought about how belgians like to use old hops in Lambics, and that got me to be a little worried. Still I bought one and tried it and it poured a huge effervescent head that subsided moderateky leaving some lace. The aroma was slighty fruity and had a malty dryness. The flavor was very strange as it had a strong flavor of hops but not like anything I have ever tried before. The hops were almost like juniper or some other astringent herb but stil retaining the smoothness of quality hops with no cheesiness or weird bitterness. The malt flavor was light and dry making sure that the hops were the highlight of the beer. The body was light and the carbonation led to a champagne like character as it fizzed all over your tongue during the first few drinks. An alright beer it seems pretty extreme to have one after another but if something interesting is needed this brew will certainly come through."
"this beer speaks for itself, if you like this style, you are going to get it, as it's a bit of a classic."
"I got a bottle that was 3 years old and I must say not held in the best conditions. I poured beautifully amber golden with a large puff of a head that became chunky a left the best lace I have ever seen. It smelled of sweet and spicey flavor be it hops or corn syrup and yeast I think a mix of all three. It is a little citrusy and horsey but pretty bland dashed with spice. Awful thin too. I will have to find some fresher stock and re-review later."
"Poured a cloudy, golden orange, with a soft, creamy head that was hard to control. Great looking beer, as I expected. Spicy aroma, lemon. Complex taste. Malt up front, with a strong hop bite. Lemon, herbs, grassy, alcohol, fruit. Very nice. Some tartness like a cider."
"Yellowish brown hue with a large off-white head. Citrus aroma. As it warms, funky farmhouse aromas are detectable. Many different flavors, such as apples, grapes, candy, and spices. Perfect balance between malt and hops. Hoppier than most Belgian beers. Finishes dry with an alcoholic kick. I would have thought the abv was higher than 6.2%. High level of carbonation. This is an amazingly complex beer, which I liked a lot more the second time I tried it.."
"Great beer. I put off trying this brew for a long time, but it has been on my list of must tries since I discovered Belgians. Try it if you haven't."
"Remember that terrible purple soapy-tasting gum that you used to get out of the machine at the local grocery store when you were a kid? Remember how there was always one kid who *loved* that stuff, and everybody else thought he was a freak? Well it tastes like that stuff. And it starts get a bit overwhelming as it warms. Which is really a shame considering that everything else about this beer is excellent."
"Was very pleasently surprised to see this at the LCBO, so picked up a couple. This Trappist Ale is one of the oldest apparently, and looks very good. It pours a coppery-orange with a fluffy, pillowy white head that laces and lingers and clings and clumps. Smell was very earthy and peaty, farm-like, with a hint of dark fruit. What appears to be an off-smell (horse blanket), becomes something I truly look forward with repeated sittings. Taste was a nice hoppy bitterness, dry, very earthy and peaty. It is pretty much exactly what I would picture medival monks drinking in a dank monastary. Nice creamy mouthfeel, almost a crispness to it. It would make a nice start to a night of Trappist Ales, and is slowly becoming my favourite of the bunch."
"this is a very good beer. i couldn't pour the 11.2 oz bottle into my glass without the head overflowing. the head is VERY thick and VERY creamy and leaves the most impressive lacing i've seen, thick chunks of foam stuck to the sides of my glass. Taste seems to be mainly of hops with maybe some spices i can't identify and alcohol--the alcohol taste isn't too bad though. It's a little bitter but overall good for the ABV. It goes down very smooth and the mouthfeel is just about right-not too thick not too thin. my only complaint is the drinkibility because of the price, 8.99 for two 11.2oz bottles, after tax that about 5 bucks a beer therefore i probably won't get it again. but that doesn't take away from it being an execellent brew."
"I like it, sucks that it is even more pricey then Duvel here...."
"For the type this is a very drinkable beer."
"At the end of the beer the lacing still very heavy on the sides of the glass. This would be one of my favorite Trappist beers if I were in the mood for something light and refreshing."
"This is a world class unique old school ale that sets the standard for complex taste and great drinkability."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a tall head that dies off fast and leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is odd - maybe some fruits in the back and a bready aroma, but I don't like this much. The flavor was quite odd too. Not to my liking. Some fruit is there, but it is very dry and the taste isn't something for me. I feel bad giving a Belgian a bad rating because it's my favorite style, but this one just doesn't do it for me."
"Orval is a full flavored somewhat complex beer. Flavors seem to grow as the beer warms."
"Overall though not real impressive or something I would drink on a regular basis."
"Bottled 15.07.2003, best before 15.07.2008. Huge, sandy head full of pits and craters fills half the goblet on the first pour, ""subsiding"" into boulder-like chunks while snapping, crackling and popping loudly. Clouds of head cling to the sides of the goblet and crust into eternity. A pillar of carbonation rushes through this hemisphere of polished bronze liquid with apricot highlights. Stinks lovingly of sourdough bread, tart green apples, sweaty armpits, curdled milk. Stench of rotting canned fruit cocktail soaking in London dry gin. Nosefeel is cool and sharply acidic, as of vinegar; the aroma practically fogging up the room. Before pouring the yeast this is dry enough on the tongue, with flavors of oregano and bay spiking through a mineral-laden palate and finishing with a twist of lemon. The yeast adds flavors of rancid sweet mint, bread, human feet, and gimlets splashed over a forest floor's worth of mold and spore before fading to a subtle aftertaste of dry herbs. Pinpricks of carbonation punctuate a mouthfeel that is almost airy with lightness and distributes effortlessly over the tongue. Drinkability is dependent only on one's ability to get over one's own senses. I can't write more without rambling pseudo-philosophically about this beer as a living, breathing organism; a metaphor for entropy; and the cyclical nature of decay and rejuvenation. Remarkable."
"This beer poured a copper orange color with a fluffy white large head. Carbonation was very evident upon pouring. The smell was crisp and citrus like. The taste was very interesing and different from anything else I've had. Very zingy yet light citron flavor along with a high amount of carbonation. Acidic and lively. Hops evident in the finish. The mouthfeel was a little odd to me. The carbonation seemed almost too high. I had the feeling off pop rocks going off in the mouth. It wasn't bad, just different. The drinkability was good but not great. The bitey nature would keep me from drinking too many of these."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber color. Beautiful thick, rocky, white head which leaves tons of lace on the glass. Very fragrant. Mostly floral and green apple smells with some spicy alcohol undertones. Some initial dry bitterness in flavor, but quickly develops into floral, and hoppy tones. Finishes very dry, with alcohol warmth. Highly carbonated and creamy mouth-feel. Slightly astringent and warming. A classic and very drinkable Trappist ale."
"Drinkability: It gets better as it warms, which makes me want another. Very drinkable for a Belgian."
"pours out a hazy copperish colour with a charged up sea foam head..lots of carbonation to support the lasting and sticky lace. musty green apple aroma...smells nice. odd but pleasant lemony flavour...lightly malted, a bit yeasty and rather dry. finishes with a bite of alcohol...lingering mustiness in the aftertaste. this is a nice, light on the palate belgian pale ale meant to be paired with a bit of cheese and meat. not my favourite style to drink...but worth respect and i would sample again under the right circumstances."
"For five bucks a bottle there are far better trappist brews."
"What else can I say? It is the worlds' perfect drink."
"As soon as I poor out this beer I get warm. Impressed by the fact that you can arleady smell this beer at a distance of 50 cm, which I never did before.... and what a smell! Old hops and the Bayanus yeast make this beer one of the most special one's in Belgium I think... and probably of the world! The taste is dry with a lot of hop and off course the great taste of the used (secondary) fermentation yeast. One that can't be missed in my (beer)cellar!"
"BTW in Belgian you can Buy this for 1.10 Euros in vending machines! (at least the HUGE indoor one adjoining the Golden Tulip Hotel on the north end of the Grand Place)."
"This is not what I expected but I love it. Very unique. The dryness and hoppyness makes this beer for me."
"I still haven't decided if I will order this one again."
"Note: I just took Jason's advice to pair this with a soft cheese (St. Andre, in my case) and what a difference that makes. Just a perfect compliment. The strong flavors of the cheese cut through the medicinal bitterness and, together the two coalesce in a way that I have never seen between a food and a beverage. On my third try, I paired it with an aged sharp cheddar; while it pairs nicely, it was nothing like the combination with the St. Andre; more recently, I paired it with a blue cheese and the flavors blended startlingly well"
"This beer amazes me in the way that it combines what I consider conventional and unconventional beer tastes in the same draught. It smells to me of a cross between an english ale and a wheat beer, (sorry to be so simplistiic). And in taste, perhaps the same applies but only in the most limited sense, there is SO much going on. I think I would describe it as mystifyingly good, its something you could drink quite happily but every time you stop and think about it - it just brings up more suprises."
"It poured at the start with a giant cream-white head, with very large bubbles, but still very consistent. After a few minutes, it became an ultra creamy small-bubbled covering on the liquid, thin but attractive, and leaving lace that looks like snow sticking to winter glass, or styrofoam particles. Intensely unique lace. The beer is clear, orange-red, chestnut brown. The aroma at first is warmly leathery, earthy oils and must. Smelt with the head still large and churning, a strong sweet-bread note, or fresh pastries, with fruity yeast. Some chemical-like smells. Phenols make their presence known, but there are also strong ripened fruits, as if the mould was already beginning to overtake them, which gives a very good aged feel to the beer, like a vintage wine. Malty sweetness in the background, some sugar, some sryup, and a very fresh smell I am having truoble describing. Lightly detectable hop; definitely enough to add even more character, though. More fruitiness than other Trappists, such as Chimay. The taste is delectable, with definite licorice, vanilla, starchy bread, sour acidic fruits, and it leaves a numb soapy clove feel on the tongue. The main difference I note in ageing this beer for 2 years compared to newer Orvals tried is the smoothness: the aged Orval is intensely smooth, creamy and oily on the palate, making it more drinkable. A strong leather taste, with nuts of different sorts, some sweet malt, and definite hop on the finish, making for an excellent balance of all 4 elements. The lees/sediment is very bitter, fruity, and obviously yeasty/fruity. Ageing has also made the beer more potent, more alcoholic, which is no surprise. The mouthfeel as mentioned is velvety, and very full. It is also quite drinkable, being so smooth and not overly alcoholic. Ahh, the life of a Trappist."
"Drinkability/Overall: Crisp and refreshing. Not my favorite Trappist, but still very good. Easy and rewarding to drink."
"a very satisfying and quenching beer. it's somewhere between american pale ale and a full-bodied belgian dubbel or trippel."
"This is a really good beer, and well worth a try if nothing else."
"ng"
"So carbonated, it expands in the mouth. Cherry flavor is still present, and lingers throughout. Finish is very bitter, almost sour. This is disappointing, and not worth the $5.49/bottle I paid."
"edit notes: the last few times i have had orval have been disappointing. i am not going to change my original review because i thought it was awesome, but the last two or three i have had have all been a bit fizzy and soda-water like, without a lot of flavor. very sad. i won't be spending the $5 to sample this beer again soon unless i can feel sure it'll be like it was in my first review."
"Fairly light in the mouth with heavy carbonation, much like a sparkiling wine. Dry and abrasive. Decent taste and a great nose. A good after dinner drink; nice and light, but still refreshing."
"Taste...is surprisingly bland. If Perrier came in beer flavor, this would be the result. Comes off like a very dry, simple white wine. Citrus bite in the aftertaste, little else. Not even an alcohol bite, which at 6.9% is surprising. I was unimpressed the first time I tried this, and remain so. This has nothing on Chimay's beers in my opinion."
"Orval is an excellent trappist ale, it is bottle conditioned for an extensive period before sale and gets better if you let it sit around. The beer pours an orangey-amber that is cloudy with taste and there is a relatively frothy head on it at first. The beer smells of oranges (probably peel) and various herbal scents (I'm picking up rosemary) and tastes amazing. Some I've been around felt it was too carbonate; however, I think this beer makes a goal of having a symphony of taste with no featured player. Each of the various flavors (spice, fruit, herb and alcohol) work together without any of them overpowering your mouth. This beer comes well recommended (esp. to trappist ale fiends like myself)."
" A bottle of '04 was very mild, with no real spiciness to it. It had a nice sweet malt backbone with some kicks of alcohol, but not a lot of complexity. I thought that if it mellowed, it would taste like nothing, but the '03 was much better. It had a nice spicy bite, and a big warming alcohol blast that was a bit too much at times, but didn't really hurt it. The carbonation is pretty big, but it smoothes out. This one didn't really do it for me as compared to others in the style."
"Mouthfeel is very effervescent and thin. Again, very dry beer. I have to say that this is quite drinkable. Would be wonderful with a meal. It calls out for crusty bread and stew or soup of some sort."
"Seved from a nice pear shaped bottle, my Orval poured out very well carbonated and buried in an avalanche of voluminous off white foamy head. This foamy mass took it's sweet old time melting away and becoming quite rocky in nature as it eroded. Buried beneath was a volume of hazy ale the color of early sunset orange. Aroma is yeasty, a bit bitter, and hint of orange peel and spice. Body is medium and almost refreshing while stil chilled a bit. Flavor is at first dominated by malt and funky bread flavors, with only a hint of spice at first as well as some lemon tartness. After a couple sips, more peppery tang and citrus flavors push through the malt and yeast to make them selves known. Finish brings out just a bit of alcohol warmth and is otherwise clean."
"Beautiful distinctive bottle, not unlike a bowing pin in shape. Amber-orange and slightly hazy color with a towering foamy white head sticking way outside the goblet and forming a peak. Insane level of carbonation keeps the head alive for a long time. The aroma is hoppy with lots of musty smells underneath. Taste is hoppy, acidic, and peppery. I am drinking this a year after it was bottled. At this point in time the beer is not very sweet or fruity. Quite refreshing with a light mouthfeel, but with a satisfying punch. I will have to get some fresh and see how it tastes at the time of bottling. Since the bottle label says the beer is good three years after bottling, Ill have to see one after it gets fully attenuated as well."
"This is my first in this style. It's good and I'd have it again but overall I may not pursue this style as much as others."
"This is a wonderful beer in so many ways that one cannot put it all into words. This is the beer to convert any ""wine snob"" to the ways of the heathen. Orval is a beer that is enjoyed in the company of a casual chess game or a formal party. One which should be respected, is respected, and always will be respected."
"Poured into a Rapscallion tulip glass, barely got the whole bottle in with a 2""+ head that snow-coned over the top of the glass. The head is thick and foamy, sort of looks like that foam you see at the ocean when a big storm is coming, or at the edge of a fast moving stream. Anyways, to continue on, the aroma is somewhat effervescent and fruity, raspberry, perhaps? Lacing over the honey hued brew is incredible as the head begins to join it's liquid brethren. Slightly sour flavor where the fruits come into play, and then rounds out a bit with the malt and slight alochol warming. An interesting Belgian, as most are."
"Tangy lemon aroma, a bit of grassy hops. Foamy yellowish tan colored head left a solid layer of lace as it faded. Hazy, cider colored beer. Light wheat flavors, a pinch of lemon and bitter grapefruit, Light body, lots of carbonation, barely bitter finish that warms the stomach. Too much carbonation keeps the light flavor from reaching the tongue. I let it sit for 15 minutes before I opened and I think it needs even more time to warm. Overall a fairly crisp and clean beer, but I was expecting more. I'll give it another try, but not in the immediate future."
"This one poured out a bit darker than i expected: a nice dull orange color instead of a clear golden. Smell is very spicy with hints of citrus fruit. I wish they made air fresheners that had this aroma. Taste seems a bit muted to me. Some citrus and spice came through as did a small small bit of hops but i sense no malt backbone. I just wish it had a little more balance. Mouthfeel is decent, nice and smooth. Drinkability seems pretty good too. This is a great beer, but to be honest I was kind of hoping for my first perfect score (well i do with all beers, but i thought this one had a chance). I'll probably buy a couple more bottles and revisit this beer at a later date."
"This came out with a blast of foamover and gunsmoke. It has a somewhat light aroma, and a muddy brown appearance completed by a thick, overwhelmingly soapy head. This has a weak, salty taste with a slightly slick mouthfeel to it, as if someone mixed beer with alkaseltzer. A little disappointing all in all. I'd expected more from this, it being a trappist ale and all."
"Another beer that must be sipped not chugged."
"This beer poured the most beautiful old gold I have ever seen, with a petit' white head. I could hardly wait to smell it. The fragarance was of malt and alcohol with some fruitieness in the mix. The taste was nice and sharp with a real alcohol bite to it. Maybe a little vanilla or banana on the end of it. This beer had a very smooth crisp feel. This is a nice beer with some bite that could be considered for regular consumption. Orval was a plesant experience, but was not quite up with Chimay Red."
"There is something exquisitely sublime about this beer. It has so many complimentary yet contradictory flavors about it, but I cannot find fault with it. It has a sharp, tangy flavor at first, but it goes down smoothly. Take a sip and breathe it in, there is a very unusual, almost hot pepper taste across your tongue. As it warms, it seems to take on a different face altogether. I liken it to an ex girlfriend, a bit offish at first, but yet unique and intriguing all the same. The more I get to know, the more I am drawn in, but just when I think I have things figured out, it changes/morphs into a completely different being. OK, I digress, but seriously, this is a beer that you should try for the sheer experience of it."
"It is light-oranmge with a slight haze and a big creamy head. There is a hopsack aroma and some esters (apple?). It is slightly funky from the use of the semi-wild yeast (brettanomyces). It is complex with floral and vanilla notes and some fresh lemon rind. The firm body is bitter and has some sour acidity in the finish. A real treat to drink and very unique."
" i almost wasnt going to review this beer thinking it had gone bad. however after reading a few posts here about it and doing some research, i learned that maybe that is the attraction of it. i can see why this beer is so liked by some people, it is definitely uniqe and very distinctive. its just not for me right now."
"Pours a very pale tea-like color with a massive dense off-white head with alot of carbonation. The smell is outstanding. I rarely get waves of smell from brew, but this one has it. It reveals a sweet fruit, coriander?, clove?, light hops, a musty yeast aroma, and some that I can't even explain. It smells complex and it made me antsy to sample this one. The taste is slightly less exciting than the aroma, but still one solid brew! It starts with the carb bite that slides into a light spicey fruit and yeast that tapers into a dry seltzer like taste. This is a light bodied beer that again has dryness that is in the entire second half of each swallow. A very nice Ale that is definitely unique! Op uw gezonheid!"
"This beer poured out a hazy orange with lots, and I mean lots of head that took forever to settle. Smell was actually fot floral with some fruits in there as well. Taste was very, very dry. But it was a good dry, if you try you'll understand what I mean. Some lemon in there with some sugar, but not much. Then it's like citric acid taste in the middle then some hops at the end. Quite complex. Aftertaste is very, very dry and it's quite longlasting. Let this beer warm up to room temperature and you'll get the full effect of this beer. Seek this out."
"amazing beer overall, not for the weak or timid."
"Pours a hazed golden copper with a volcanous off-white head in the authentic Orval chalice. Bought this case almost a year ago and down to a few bottles dated best before 8/10/06. Strange... the ABV on the bottle says 6.9%. Head stays around forever, leaving tatted lace all over the chalice. Intricate aromas, black pepper, hops, lemon zest, some barnyard and sweaty farmyard, but oh so beautiful. The taste is as equally complex. Never sweet, the whole experience is just a dry assault on the palate. Some grapefruit or other sweet/sour citrus, some barnyardy saisonishness, another part yeasty. Mouthfeel's spritzy and well-carbonated for a beer of such ABV. Wholly enjoyable (I guess the reason I'd fork over $90 for a case of it a year ago). If you're looking for a complex, drinkable -and exotic- beer, look no further. I love turning pseudo beer connoissuers on to this beer. ""Oh! You've never tried an Orval?"""
"Despite the ugliness of my description of the taste, it really isn't awful, just not a Belgian I'm going to reach for in the immediate future."
"Very spicy, floral notes emerge the second of the pour. Accumulates in a beautiful, hazy, dark amber with a gigantic, spumey, unsettling head. An undertone of vinegar is notable in the smell. The carbonation hits your palate hard, but the beer has so much flavor that this doesn't detract. Most belgian beers are somewhat shadowed by their carbonation levels, but not here. Sweet, tart hops followed by sweet darkmalts and alcohol. Spices do a good job blending the flavors together, adding a layer of complexity that is quite enjoyable to sort out. A must have for me on special occasions, despite the price."
"Poured from 33cl skittle shaped bottle with a bottling date of either October 2nd or February 10th 2003. ( I can never figure out the european dating) Pours a vibrant light orange with a huge barely off white head. The head doesnt seem to stick around as other belgians. The aroma is of Hops with a bit of candy and well that typical barn scent. This one has more horseblanket, barn scent than most, perhaps because it is so young. The taste is almost pale aleish. Very hoppy at first, then it gives way to a bit of candied fruit. Not very complex at this age. I will have to get a couple to see how they turn out. The carbonation is high, but the mouthfeel is still nice. I think the carbonation helps cleans the tongue and this would be good with some fatty foods esp with the high hops at this age. Drinkability is good, the alcohol is well hidden. I will have to get a couple of these to age as I feel once they round out some more of the character will come out of this beer."
"Orval Trappist Ale is different from the other Trappist beers I've tried, with a lower alcohol content and a flavor that reminds me of an American pale ale or IPA. Nevertheless, it's damn tasty, very affordable (at least in Paris), and the only Trappist I've had so far that could be a session beer. Not as good as St. Bernadus or Rochefort, but if you haven't already tried it, one to consider."
"I'm pretty certain that, no matter the age (from fresh to the 5 years of the 'best by' date) Orval Trappist Ale is not for me. If it's an acquired taste, then it's one that I will never acquire... because I won't be drinking any more of it."
"It's because of this ephemeral quality that I think Orval is one of the few beers that I could actually drink day in day out and never get tired of. At least, I hope that's so."
"Fantastic billowing rocky white head that never dies. Huge. Smell is of leather, spices, flowery esters, hops and barnyard funk. So complex, its hard to even describe. Taste is magnificent, bready, malty with notes of banana and spice. Big mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Overall, one of the better Belgians I have had. This one was bought while in Belgium, too, so it made it seem a little more authentic. :)"
"The Russian import label calls this simply: ""pale beer"". My goodness, what an understatement! Pours a lovely cloudy deep gold with hints of amber under a fluffy white head that starts thick, but settles to substantial film. There are only some spots of lace on my glass, but I'm tempted to blame the glass. The nose is magnificent: Cotton candy and flowers, and lots more sensations I can't quite describe. Sorting all this complexity out is one major nasal challenge! The mouth is heavily carbonated and surprisingly light. The taste? Lord have mercy! Candy, sugar, spices, lemon peel, and a thousand other things to confront the tongue, jowels, palate and every other part of the mouth. Then, the hops emerge. Rare for a Belgian, this beer is very well hopped. Good crisp, flowery hops that dominate the finish and leave a very tart bitterness in the aftertaste. Oh, yeah, I'll have another."
"A beauty. Pours hazy pale color with a thick, tall white head. Lots of bubbles continue to rise as the beer settles. Smells of lemony hops, musty yeast and fresh meadow. Tastes great, floral hop notes, crisp tangy malt profile, mild & earthy yeast profile. I could drink this beer all night. The mouthfeel was well balanced, what an easy drinking beer that really had tons of taste. May be my new favorite belgian?"
"The appearance of this strong pale ale was excellent. Hazy dark gold with an immense fluffy head. The smell was not really to my liking however, not horrible, just not my style. It hit me with musty yeast at first followed by something reminiscent of horse manure. I see one of the bro's used the term horse blanket in their review (as part of taste) and that's a pretty good description also. The taste however was leaps and bounds above the smell. Still very musty, but with a citrus hop bitterness. Defiantly yeasty, with some herby graininess. Mouthfeel was excellent as well, medium bodied and crisp. I found it to be very carbonated. Drinkability was good although, I really could not get over the darn horse manure smell, enough to say it was better than ""good," but to some the smell may be to their liking. Just a matter of preference. All and all though an excellent beer, and one of the legendary 6 true Trappist ales. Give it a go if you like Belgian beer and haven't already. You won't be sorry. Oops, almost forgot, my bottle said 6.9% abv., not 6.2%. Go figure."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color wit a thick overflowing white head. The aroma is good. It boasts of pale malts and lemon zest. The taste is decent. It is light and citrousy. It has a musty aftertaste, but goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is fair. It is a medium bodied beer with too much carbonation. It drinks well. I thought the taste was good. It just was a little too foamy. All in all, this was pretty decent."
"The taste is of smoothness, giving way to sourness and a hint of lemon that gives way to a bite with hoppy undertones. Good, but a little more maltiness would have been in order. The beer is light with just the right amount of carbonation and a hint of the alcoholic content in the aftertaste. In truth, I would love to drink this all night were it not for the price."
"It came out of the bottle a dark amber color with quite an impressive foamy off-white head that laced down the side of the glass but diminished greatly pretty quickly. The aroma was of a noticeable banana ester with a general floral hop smell to complement it. It tastes spicey, banana-y, and somewhat bitter. It isn't an overwhelming flavor, fairly mild. I really thought it was excessively carbonated, it really fills your mouth (and more) up with gas pretty quickly. ""burp!"" Overall not bad, not great, but a little overcarbonated."
"This is my first review, I chose to wait and review one of my favorite beers to start."
"This beer poured a very bright (almost flourescent) orange color with a lively white head. Lots of lacing around the glass. The aroma was strongly yeasty and slightly fruity. The flavor brought about a bouquet of fruits, mostly tarty and citric. Yeast, however, dominated my palate and was overwhelming at times. It was also slightly bready at times. The finish was extremely dry. This was a well made, well carbonated beer but it was nothing spectacular."
"To me, the flavor of this brew is unique in comparison to the other Trappist beers. Much, much dryer on the palate, similar to champagne or a dry white wine. Has a sweeter cherry fruit flavor that cuts the tartness in the finish. Very dry. The alcohol is pretty undetectable in the nose and taste, but sneaks up just a little and warms you nicely. Very dry, citrusy, and highly drinkable. Exceeded my expectations."
"Pours a golden orange with an enormous white, foamy head. Quite a site to see. I made the mistake of using a tulip glass - I think I needed something a bit bigger. Aroma is slightly fruity, and a little sweet. Very fizzy and crisp mouthfeel - kind of burns you on the way down. Light fruity citrusy taste, a little on the sour side, and also a good deal of spice. Ends fairly dry. I was expecting something with a bit more flavor. Overall a nice brew, but not my favorite Trappist."
"Pours a thick cloudy dark amber color with a huge frothy and creamy beige lasting head that leaves clingy sheets of lace in my glass, nice malty and sweet, spicy aroma. Sweet and fruity sugar flavors, nice and smooth creamy soft mouthfeel, full body with lively carbonation, finishes with a pleasant spicy aftertaste."
" I didn't expect to rate this one very high. Its appearance resembles a Duvel, which I like less than when I reviewed it. The Orval is a remarkable enlightenment for me, suggesting I give the Duvel another look, but no...I think it's just the superiority of this complex Strong Pale Belgian Ale. This one belongs in my personal top five. Fantastic all around. Wow!"
"Overall, acceptable but there are much better ones out there."
"Pours hazy, murky orange with big frothy head that left quickly. Left nice lace and of carbonation bubbles. Aromas of orange peel, coriander, champagne yeast and some sour apple are present. Flavors of sweet mild malt, thin spiciness and closes with some bitterness. Mouthfeel is extraordinary, very lively in the mouth."
"Them monks was spicy devils! Lovely slightly dark yellow appearance and friuty aroma. But a sip reveals the spicy hop flavor with a mild alcohol backdrop. Carbonation is tingly, fruit in the center and a clean dry finish. Good powerful stuff and something I look forward to enjoying again."
"Tasted at ""Bistro des Bières Belges"" on Montreal's south shore in a bottle labeled 6,9% rather than the 6.2% suggested here. While pouring the liquid, you come to understand what's with everyone talking about all the unique flowers in the aroma from this legendary trappist beer. Lilac is all over the place, your nose doesn't even have to be close to the nice graal-like glass. The numerous and regular bubbles escape relatively fast leaving just a perfect relatively small white head. The taste is very spicy with coriander, citrus and just so many I can't name. Bitterness steps in and dance in unity with those spices among the flowers. A nectar!"
"Overall- Decent but the sour medicinal aftertaste knock this 1 down a notch."
"Haven't made up my mind on whether I like that ""barnyard"" character yet. This is definitly an unique beer and certainly worth a try."
"Two years later, new stock of Orval. Bad Aroma not really there this time, but I am not the only one to notice how many skunked Orvals are about."
"Bottled on October 24, 2002, best before October 24, 2007."
"I couldn't afford to drink it all the time, but it's a great change of pace."
"Pourred an orangy brew with what I consider to be the most beautiful beige head. Head retention for Orval is what other brewers should aspire to since it is the longest lasting I have ever experience. Taste is of complex spice with great fruit aroma. Also, great wheat taste with a strong body. One of the best trappist in my opinion."
"Final update: Tried this one last time, after having given my palate a chance to adapt to Belgians such as Achel, Quintine, Westvleteren, Rochefort, Bink, etc... Also followed the suggestion of other BA's and made this beer my first selection of the evening. Net result, I no longer think is completely vile. However, the odd and rather unpleasant medicinal/orajel flavors noted previously remain, though being much more subdued than I recall. While it was more palatable on my third try, I still cannot recommend this beer. I upgraded my taste rating to 2.5."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"It has a very clean, refreshing mouthfeel with a lot of body and no watery tinges. It is a wonderfully drinkable beer that I might have given a 5 to for taste and drinkability except that I think there is still a beer out there that will be better. If you have a chance to try this one, you should. I wish the price was such that I could make it a regular thing."
"I do not enjoy the white wine quality of this ale."
"Beer #100. Pours a slightly hazy dark orange, about the color of iced tea. Magnificent gigantic voluminous creamy head that laces the entire glass for the entire beer. Smell is amazing. Sour, fruity, earthy, yeasty, and malty. Taste follows the nose's lead. Tangy fruits, followed by a touch of horse blanket, hay, touch of hops maybe?, then touch of complex malts. Finish is dry, smooth and refreshing. One of the most easy drinking Belgians I've ever had, as well as one of the best beers I've ever had. Amazing."
"Thisone was a beer-goal of mine for some time now. Found with the help of beerfly (Sydney, Oh). To send off a moving brother-in-law, we bought two at 4.79 each. We opened one, poured into non-orval approved glassware. The slight off-white head was huge, massive, if not in the way for it settled very slowly. What comes to pass after the head is very nice, thick rings of sticky lace. An orange/amber cloudy haze of liquid appears. The aroma is of citrus or straight lemon. The taste is smooth with a tart, hop bite. The body is mid to thin. The mouth is left dry, thirsty. Drinkable, yes. Knowing the history, the abbey, the monks. Very cool!! I'll keep the other until the brother-in-law returns to use the orval approved glassware that I have, so far unused."
"This is one to linger over and not put away by the bucket full. Good to imbibe as part of a beer and cheese evening."
"When I poured the yeast, the smell was of manure. I'm not sure why I decided to drink it, but I'm thankful that the taste was nothing like the aroma. The yeast was somewhat tart, with a bit of pepper."
"This remains a challenging/ characterful brew on this side of the Atlantic. When fresh it is quite a bit different; still good but in a fresh hoppy sort of way. I love that the Belgians still embrace ornery ""spoilage"" organisms in their brews, it makes for a much more colorful world."
"Drinkability: to me this is the most different from all the other trappists. obviously much mess sweet. decent drinkability alothough it is not nearly my favorite trappist. i'm suprised it ranks so highly. i wonder if this is b/c it is labelled a ""trappist""?"
"Pours an orange kinda tainted tone which reminds me of the sorta pale ale that sierra nevada has. And the product itself is very similar: a tough, bitter sweetness both in nose and taste that while being good is not all that great for my taste (les goûts et les couleurs ne se discutent pas!), But still is a nice refreshing malty-hoppy blend that works always. The trappistes at orval have passed the test."
"An absolutely stunning ale. Very complex and wonderful."
"This bottle was quite young, so the flavors were a lot more raw. A bit more bitter and hoppy than some of the older bottles I've tried. An interesting drink even if you get an old, beat-up, mishandled bottle. The balance between malt sweetness and the bitterness fluctuates a lot over time. As does the flavors coming from the bacterial profile. Swirling up all the sediment and dumping in the glass towards the end is always a tasty bonus!"
"after a session of several top quality beers, its awesome to finish the night with one of these just to put it all in perspective. its almost enuff to make me want to join a monastery."
"Overall Impression: A mild, but very complex flavor. A nice blending of spice, malt and yeast that gives an impressive, but again, milder taste. While this is obviously a well-made beer, it just didn’t strike a chord with me, which hurt it’s drinkability score in my book. One you should try once to see if it strikes a chord with you."
"This brew fits no specific style. It is truly a one of a kind experience."
"The beer poured a dark golden color, somewhat hazy, with a thick medium-bubbled head. The smell was spicy, fruity, and very bready/yeasty. A bit of banana in there, too. The taste was spicy - too spicy, really, like someone accidentally dropped a large container of white pepper in the batch. A bit of malt was hiding back there, and the finish was just as strong spiced with a tinge of clove-numbness. The overabundance of white pepper was just too strong to truly enjoy this one, but it paired with some roquefort cheese very well."
"Comments  Sorry, not my idea of the style. Pop a Pranqster or La Fin Du Monde to see what I prefer. Or, better yet, read TheLongBeachBums review of the Avec Les Bons Voeux."
"Overall it is a very good beer, but for the price I won't be getting it again any time soon."
"Bottle date 11/01/07 - Bright orange color, large head with staying power. Aroma is orange with a touch of banana and a little musty. Initial taste is vinous and very tart and sweet and sour. Very complex tastes, orange peel, grapefruit, malty and dry, champagne and salt. Flavors mellow as it warms. Incredibly complex beer. Definitely not for everybody, but world class. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"It didn't think it was that bad, but I was very disappointed. Especially considering the lengths I'll have to go through to get another to try."
"Judging from the awesome reviews, it may be that I purchased a lackluster bottle. I will try it again and see if it kicks my ass the way it seems to have others. Anyway, the head on this fellow was a virtual monster!! massive and foamy the head stays and stays! The beer pours a good copper blonde with some orange highlites. Aromas are ripe and fruit driven with flavors of grapefruit, citrus peel and fruitcake. The beer is medium in body with soft carbonation and a creamy feel. The taste is at once bitter citrus hopiness-veryredolent of citrus zest or oil. The whole emphasis in flavor seems to center on bright twangy citrus, and I, betting this is a fantastic food wine. I'll try it with some whitefish and potato and report back. I think I score the drinkability a bit low as this seems most certainly made for food vs simply sipping. I will try again and re review as needed."
"This is a good one. One of my favorites. I recently made a trappiste ale and the best one of mine that I tasted came out of the Orval bottle I used during bottling. Maybe its a monk-like sign. Fishy at the least, get it."
"(330 ml bottle, ABV 6,2%). This fine beer is cloudy deep golden with an enormous creamy head. It has an intense, overwhelming but lovely aroma of ensilage, horse stable, leather and spicy fruit cake. The flavour is complex and spicy, hops stand out, the aftertaste is dry but could have lasted a little longer. Still, this is clearly a world class beer. Definitely moreish!"
"Cloudy amberish color with visible floating setiment.Nice head that doesn't disappear quickly. An exquisite musty hoppy aroma, with just a hint of citrus. Nice classic complex hop taste which lingers nicely in the mouth. Way it coats the mouth may not mix well with many foods, but to savor by itself is great. Glob of head lasted till end. Glass smelled wonderful afterwards"
"11.2oz. bottle poured into an Orval glass. It pours a dark reddish-amber color with two fingers of head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is a mix of sweet malts and a little bit of cloves. The taste is spicy and slightly sour, a little weird, very unique. a bit of hops and nutmeg to the super dry finish. Fairly strong mouthfeel, a little bubbly. The drinkability is fairly good for being 6.9%."
"Quite a ride, with none others even remotely like it."
"11.2 oz bottle. Poured a dark amber/orange color with a massive cratered head that seemed to last forever. Aroma is that of citrus and floral. Kind of odd for a beer to smell like a flower garden. Taste is tart, and very acidic, with its medium carbonation, it finishes very dry. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, it doesn't really leave any aftertaste behind. Different to say the least. Will have to try this one again, just to see."
"This beer is a textbook example of how a beer should present itself. Huge carbonation creates a dense chunky head that rises in a column above the rim of the glass. The big carbonation also carries a great aroma full of bannanas with hints of spices and other fruit. The lacing is outstanding. As great as the beer looked and smelled, the taste was a bit disapointing. I thought it was a bit too bitter, acidic and had an unpleasant coppery taste. I'll drink it again, but it isn't something I plan to make a habit of."
"Pours a hazy golden, almost orange with a monstrous orangish-white head--WOW! Smell is sour, bitter, and floral; very interesting, like nothing I've smelled before. Taste is sour and bitter with a sharp, dry, yeasty, fruity, acidic finish. Is there alcohol in this? Ahh, the gentle warming half-way into this beauty says yes. This beer feels amazing: crisp, intriguing carbonation that just envelops the mouth. I would drink this regularly if it weren't $6 a bottle."
"This brew poured an extremely invigorated head of creamy white bubbles and a cloudy light orange body with carbonation rising from the bottom of my mug. It has a mild malty aroma and a flavor that is slightly fizzy with notes of spice and hops. It is very dry in its finish and has no lingering aftertaste. All in all, it is a very nice brew."
"A nice Belgian that would take a while to get used to drinking. Pours out looking very much like apple cider with a half inch head of off white froth. The aroma is mostly of fruit and sour at that. This follows through in the flavor which comes across as a sour fruit taste. No doubt this is a very complex with great complexity, if one is willing to get past the opening nose-wrinking smell and taste. There is clearly a great malt base and dandy yeast and hops at work here. Enjoyable? Depends on your point of view."
"Everything prior to the taste was great -- full and complex but finished with a medicinal flavor. I found it a little disappointing."
"Interesting. Enjoyed......alas, never to meet again!"
"This particular brew poured with a large white foamy head. There was carbonation observed rising to the top of my glass. The body was cloudy and an orangish color. This brew had a fruity aroma to it. This is one brew that I really enjoyed rating and drinking."
"Poured a very nice orange color with huge rocky head (I have yet to purchase a nice trappist ale glass),the aroma was slightly peppery and a little tart.Taste is pretty dry with a slight peppery tinge to it.I liked this more than what I thought I would not as sour as what I thought it might be,very well done."
"A fabulous, original beer and a true piece of history."
"The bowling pin bottle is great, and the freshness date had me good until the Fall of 2007. Colour is a murky mid-range coppery orange, and the foam on this bad boy is a sight to behold, big, thick and chunky, lingering the whole way down the chalice, and leaving behind an impressive amount of lacing. Nose is herbal and citrusy, some earth tones as well. Taste is tart/sour and flowery, with a tart lemon rind aftertaste. I'm not a huge fan of this style, but can appreciate it for what it is."
"The nose is slightly sweet, yeasty and a little fruity. Alcohol and spice give it almost a rum-like smell. The front is peppery, with some grapes giving it a dry wine-like flavor. Interesting. The middle goes slightly sour, with hints of apples. The tang is almost a little tonic-watery. The finish is a fantastic fresh, dry, bready experience with noticeable alcohol. There's almost a red wine aftertaste. Very dry. This is one of my favorites. A great, complex, original beer."
"The word ""trappist"" immediately imparts high expectations, and I cannot honestly say Orval lived up. It's a good beer, but it was almost as if I was witnessing a catfight between the yeast and the hops. They were both there, but they didn't achieve any sort of harmony. I've had it twice and I've made up my mind: it simply isn't a $3/bottle beer. The bottle is pretty cool and it looks great in my collection, but that simply ain't enough."
"This is unlike any other beer I've ever had in my 17+ years of enjoying fine craft beer. The head on this beer is unbelievable. I poured this beer in it's dedicated Orval glass and drank it slowly which lasted about 20-30 minutes. The head stayed at a peak the entire duration and even after the last sip, it was still hanging on to the side of the chalice for it's dear life. The flavor was so unique and complex that it will most likely require several additional samplings to accurately define what I'm sensing. Burnt sugar, stale fruit, earthy malty taste. I don't know, perhaps my palate doesn't possess the sophistication for this one. What I do know is that It was a most enjoyable if not a religious experience and I look forward to the next. Hmmm, beer as a religion. What a concept."
"($3.99 / 11.2 oz./.33L bottle)"
"I was not overly impressed by this offering, in fact a little dissappointed. It poured ok, the classic light color cloudy yellow I have come to exspect from the Belgiums. But after that, it just fell apart. The ABV was not balanced, IMHO, properly. Too much alcohol taste. The hops weren't very impressive, yes they were there, but showing up is only half the work. I felt they didn't blen well. It went down in a forceful way, each sip anticipating it's taste, not in a good way. I'll refrain from this beer in the future."
"I have to say that this was an interesting beer, especially for the aroma. You don't find many like this one."
"This beer has an angelic experience about it, the slightly hazed glowing amber body just lets the beer gods sing down on you. The head forms chunky like clouds in the heavans. Lacing is fine intricate Belgian style all day. Aromatics bring out the barnyard funkiness that makes this a new experience everytime I've come across it, again more zestiness sharp citrus appeal from the hops with a spicy pepper kick that just works so nicely here. Acidic nature waves in as well bringing out lactic acid notes and cider like comparisons in my brain. The more yeast that makes it into the glass the funkier it gets. Drinkability and mouthfeel are great, definitely a brew I will always cherish. Effervescent and drinkable but definitely needs to be enjoyed with a good meal."
"All in all, not my favorite Belgian, which surprised me given its high reviews."
"Pours an amber color with a large head. Citrus like aroma. The taste is citrusy and a little tart. I wasn't expecting the tartness, but it is definately welcome here. I have a feeling this beer could be paired well with a large variety of foods. This beer definately stands out from the other trappist ales. Unfortunately it's too expensive to drink regularly."
"This is a beautiful, active pour. Golden amber with a monstrous head reminiscent of a (root) beer float. Active carbonation on the way up and swirls of sediment on the way down. Subtle, clean grain smell with spiciness on the fringes. Eminently smooth texture with a complex palate that ranges from a sweet, malty start to a very crisp middle and dry, warm finish. A very pleasant find."
"I think everyone should try this beer and if it interests you,put a bottle or two away."
"Color is a really nice amber with a yellowy glow at the bottom and the head is silky smooth and tightly frothy, looks like fleshy silk and is about two fingers high leaving tight weblike lacing. Smells of light fruity hops and sweet malt, very smooth, soft, and fresh. Taste is rich, sweet malt, a bit tangy, and has a good dry hoppiness and a mild yeasty note. This is very silky smooth and drys slowly leaving a nice sweet tangy sense in the mouth. Easily drinkable and the flavor is just right."
"Liquid Belgian cobblestones and cobwebs. Deep amber crowned by a gluey cap of toasted meringue. Freaky nose of fresh basil, caramelized sugared pecans, rose petals and black water swamp. Unique, to me. It's sweet, I think, but leafy, in a bitter chicory endive fashion. Finish is profoundly earthy hop, like they brewed it with hop roots, not the flowers. Whoa...smooth, drainable, fascinating."
"Pours hazy orange in color, huge white head that lasts and lasts, leaving sheets of lacing the whole way down. Aroma is very strong, lots of yeast (barnyard, dough, some cheese), some perfume, flower, and grass from the hops, and some spiciness. Flavor starts with some of the perfume coming through, turns slightly sour, ends with some herbal grassy hop flavor. Body is medium, and ends dry as can be."
"Orange-copper color with a thick, chunky, off-white head that leaves excellent lacing. The aromas are of sweet candi sugar, fresh hay-like aromas, and a somewhat lemony, fruit aroma. The flavor is sweet up front with a medicinal, fresh hay flavors like a lambic. It flows to a dry finish. It is a medium-full bodied beer; very tasty."
"A very good Belgian brew. I came across this one on a recomendation from the barkeep at the Steelgarden, within the Bethlehem Brew Works. It is not a restaurant, it is an experience. Pretty much what a basic Belgian brew should be. It offers a balanced nose with a full-bodied, spicey, yet not too spicey bier. A very flexible bier to go along with just about any kind of bar food, even the really spicey stuff. Prost!"
"Tremendous work obviously went into this beer; I'm glad that I tried it, but it's not a beer that I would seek out."
" Of the Trappist I have tried this is not high on the list but not bad at all."
"It's awful perty, though."
"Not my favorite trappist. I will continue trying to make sure I have had the best representative of the brew, but nothinng new and it's been done better."
"Pours out red amber with a big head. Citrus tastes are strong as are other spice. The hops balance this quite nice and cut the flavors off when they should end. The aftertaste is quite dry making you want more more more! If you like Belgian ales, you'll dig this fine brew. So smooth, so good."
"Color is a pure golden, edging into orange. Head is full, and frothy white. Aroma is overwhelming and enticing from afar: extraordinarily spicy, very enticing and seductive, though I haven't even even brought this brew close to my nose yet. An arousing blend of the sweet and the sour, with some citric notes speaking up here and there. Loads of sugar and spice, and, well, everything nice. Fierce hops on the palate, and an excellent texture, great hop bite and play upon the tongue. Full of body and flavor. Long lasting finish. Delicious, with plenty of citric tang. Deeply satisfactory, very mellow and pacifying.This is a brew that tastes of the history it contains. A very unique, pleasurable and pacifying beverage."
"Very attractive orangeish/gold in color. Mostly clear with a massive lace-leaving head. Aroma is yeasty, fruity, and spicy, with hints of orange, grape, and floral hops. The flavor is incredibly assertive; I could detect almost no sweetness at all in the first sip. Lemony and acidic, the flavor profile is dominated by tart fruit and spicy tastes, followed by a big, earthy, floral hop finish. Overall impression in the mouth is very crisp, almost sharp. A bit harsh on the tongue for me with a very dry finish. I found that adding the yeast to the glass rounds the flavor out a bit and leaves a much more mellow beer."
"It pours a beautiful honey color with a foamy white head. It's a very nice looking beer. The smell is on the light side: citric with a hint of hops. The taste is also citrus and quite tart, almost sour. It's a very dry beer and leaves the sensation of disappearing almost immediately upon hitting the tongue. I must confess to being slightly disappointed."
"I really enjoy the tartness in this beer, lemony, spicy hops, then a slightly bitter and crisp finish. This beer is different than other Belgian's I have tried in that it's more tart and pungent. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and will definitely purchase it regularly."
"The aroma is very distinctive, lemon, and a least yeast smell. The taste is terrific, but damn hard to describe. Very nice taste, almost lemony, with a little bit of yeast, but much more so. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, with just a hint of carbonation. The aftertaste is pleasant, and very long lasting. I hear you either hate it or you love it, and I love it."
"And the taste. Goodness, I love it. I'm a big fan of beers with a bit of a tart edge to it, and this is just perfect. It has a sour, acidic quality to it while maintaining a high level of drinkability. While some friends of mine have described it as ""tastes like a horse's ass," I find it engaging and unrestrained. How can you not like a beer that combines sweetness with an almost poisonous natural, vinegar sourness?"
"A huge bitternes is makes itself at home one the palate after a sip, and it dares to stay there for a long time too! How nice of it to stick around. ;) However I don't think I can rate this one over Duvel like Gusler did, this one rates a little lower imho. In the end however it's a nice ale, everyone should try this if they can get hold of it. Oh, and I payed a little over $2 for this bottle."
"The beer pours a magnificent hazy deep orange, the head monstrous in size, creamy in its consistency and as it evanesces, leaves behind a satiny sheet of fine lace. The aroma of ripe bananas, yeast, sweet brown sugar with the malt underpinning it all makes this a real sniffers delight. Start malt and lightly sweet, the top slim in feel on the palate, biting in its acidity, the hops perky in their spicy bite, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. A real treat in all aspects and I prefer it to Duvel, and many other Belgians for that fact."
"Definitely the lightest (in body and in flavor) of the trappist beers I've tried. Almost perfumy, flowery aroma and taste. Smells kind of like a liquor. Spicy, sweet and tangy. Quite unique and enjoyable, but a little too light for a Belgian. 6.9% ABV. Absolutely worth trying, and I can see why some people love this beer. But for $4.50 a bottle, it's not much of a bargain (when I can get Duvel, Westmalle, Unibroue, etc. for less). Note; This beer is terrific with food, my favorite time to drink Orval."
"Drinkability: Very good. Clean and smooth. Though a tad more tart than I prefer."
"Carbonation just perfect: the beer has a milder form of 'Champenoise'-pearl forming, as made with naturally mildly crabonated springwater. Mouthfeel neither chewy, neither watery. No new aftertaste, bitterness lingers on. Drinkablility is second bar none: this is the ultimate Belgian session beer: it gives richness, depth and easy drinking, just as you prefer at the moment given. Unparallelled."
"A very good beer. Pours out to a cloudy, amber in the glass with a generous head. The aroma is the strong point of this beer. It combines essences of a fine liqueur with that of yeast and fruit. Taste is slightly spicy in the Belgium sort of way. Fairly high in carbonation. Finish is quite easy and invites another sip. Rather expensive, but a nice treat."
"Pours with a rocky, craggy, long lived white head over hazy orangey/gold liquid. The nose is ultra fruity, clean and inviting. Taste is a flash of sweetness before a huge surge of hoppiness mixed with yeast fruitiness fills the mouth. A crisp and acidic mouthfeel gives an impression of light bodiedness. Finishes dry and bitter, complex in it's taste. The reason I chose to delve deeper into all beers Belgian. THE Trappist ale...just wish it wasn't so gosh-darned expen$ive. One of life's great luxuries!"
"F"
"Dark copper color, huge white head, with larger bubbles that I am used to on a Belgian. Massive hoppy, and floral fruity aroma like guava; do they even have guava in Belgium? Someone else said botanical which is a brilliant description. Aroma was so amazing I could smell it from 2 meters away. Palate was totally different from the nose. Totally complex palate that was with earthy, spicy, yet creamy. Yet for all this complexity, I was surprised how thin this beer was."
"Complex stuff. Pours a reddish gold color, With a fat white head. A nice combination of wild yeast, malty body with a hop kick. Nice spiciness mixes with the yeastiness, and hopiness. An excellent beer. Belgian beers exist at a different plane than most beers I am used to, And this one is a personal favorite."
"This brew gains its unusual orangey color from the use of three malts produced to its own specification. Its character has some acidity and spicy sage notes comes from its own single cell yeast in its bottle fermentation."
"Hazy, coppery-tawny-gold hue, a splendid color really, the head is absolutely massive, easily three fingers (on a soft pour no less). What a gorgeous ale! The retention is fantastic, similar to meringue, the very definition of perfect. It laces it thick rings, organized, chucky. The nose is impressive, bubblegum upfront, soft orange wedge candy too, and then hints of grapes and green apples, dashes of pepper, oily hops, and undercurrents of a barnyard. There is a lushness in the nose that I find unique, it is obviously hoppy but so damn soft with the fruitiness. It is very impressive, good potency as well. Inviting. On the palate the hoppiness is assertive and bitter. This is coupled with an amazing dryness that allows a white wine vinous plus influences of apples, pepper, and mellow kiss of horse blanket. The palate is wonderful and akin to the complexities of the bouquet. It is very bitter but very soft. The mouthfeel is similar brut champagne, albeit with much improved carbonation. The finish is done-dry, which is very appetizing; the pepper and hops bitterness is long lasting. The body seems a touch thin but it is workable, the carbonation is high. This aspect of the beer has grown on me, Id didnt care for this feature on my first few bottles of Orval but now the mouthfeel is a welcomed attribute. I wrongfully compared this to Duvel and it never stood up in my mind that was my fault. Orval is too unique and too noteworthy to compare, it is a different version of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and in many ways better. I love Orval. Highly Recommended."
"Worthy of the praise. This is a very nice one."
"418"
"Pours an amber colour with a beautigul white thick head. Orval is one of greatest beers around. I must admit that the smell makes you not to want to drink this beer... NOT from the bad point of view but the good one. The aroma is PERFECT in every way so you could enjoy it by just smelling it. After enjoying the aroma, taste comes along and it's as good as the smell. One word could only describe this beer... ADDICTIVE"
"Orval is one of those beers that I just love to smell. Theres a lot going on in the aroma.clove, spices, fruit, citrusand very floral. The head is soft and dense, and produces considerable lace. Color is deep, shady amber. The beer is effervescent and light bodied. A nice, biting hop finish is in contrast to a tart and spicy foretaste. Small sips and deep sniffs are the way this beer is meant to be enjoyed!"
"Clear golden amber, with one of the most interesting heads I've ever witnessed... the head sprouted off in every direction... very odd and alluring. Aroma was sour and sweet... fruity and herbal. Flavor began with some sour fruit flavors... apple and pear maybe... became somewhat spicy and finished like an herbal tea. Light to medium body with a quite noticable alcohol presence. This is a beer that I'll need to try again... as it is with most well brewed Belgians, it's far too complex to fully describe."
"Golden coloring with a fine-bubbled pure white head--pleasantly thick and persistent. Active carbonation. Complex nose--barnyard, bubblegum, and Band-Aid aromas; quite sour-smelling. Effervescent in the mouth; light body. Band-Aid in the aroma, as I mentioned; and I don't profess to know what Band-Aids taste like, but if the smell is any indication, this definitely tastes like a Band-Aid would taste. There's a hard-to-define tonic-watery sort of hoppy bitterness present throughout. It has grown on me somewhat as it warmed, but to be honest I expected more from this brew."
"Big alcohol nose with some pale malt sweetness.  Huge off-white head with big airy bubbles.  Classic hazy pale ale look with lots og bubble action in the goblet (center).  The rocky head and lace is lasting.  This brew starts out on a good footing, because its look is almost flawless.  The initial taste is one of smooth malt sweetness then strong warm alcohol notes leads your tongue to a bitter hop/fruit finish.  The fruit most resembles bitter peach. Quite a complex and bold brew.  Medium to full mouth with a nice creamy feel and coating left in the mouth.  A truly crafted Belgian Ale!"
"Pours into my Orval chalice, where it is beautifully presented, an orange brew with a huge white head that retains very well.  Wonderful complex aroma, consisting mainly of ripe banana and clove.  It's like I just got a bunch of fresh bananas and peeled one!  Also detectable are fresh sliced green apple, dried fruit (maybe raisin or plum), and spicy hops.  Can't say how great that aroma is, it's just overwhelmingly good!  I feel like I'm in a fruit market.  One of the most aromatically pleasing Belgian beers I've ever had.  Cracked pepper jumps in with the first taste, then more of that fresh fruit that was in the aroma.  Clove also floats around sporadically.  Spicy hops are next, along with dried fruit.  Malt is most noticeable with retro-olfaction.  Very ""carbonated"" mouthfeel.  Sharp melon rind-like hop twang in the finish.  A medium body, but very fruity, spicy, and complex!  This beer is so very good!  It's well worth the $4.99 or so for the 11.2 oz. bottle in my opinion.  Trappist monks certainly know how to brew.  And I'm sure they get to drink this wonderful brew every day at the Abbaye Orval.  They even make cheese to pair this with.  I want to be a monk there now, where do I sign up?"
"May have been biggest head ever. The foam was very stiff and rose over the top of the glass about 1.5 inches and wouldn't have budged in a hurricane. I get Juicy Fruit gum in the aroma underneath which slinks a cigarette smoking man playing baseball with a big eraser in his pocket. To interpret that, underneath the juicy fruit smell and flavor was something that reminded me of cigarettes, wood, and pencil erasers (especially after you've just erased something.)"
"Orval's appearance is one of the most outstanding I've seen. Pours a deep apricot-colored liquid with a commanding, bubbly white head. Head retention is ridiculously good. Nose is of various fruit, brettanomyces yeast, and substantial clove. Taste is rather sour and dry, but not overly so. The acidic yet well-carbonated mouthfeel is appropriate. Drinkability is fairly strong for a challenging brew like this. Orval is certainly a unique Trappist ale, and one whose attention is well-deserved."
"Nice cloudy orange in the glass with a lacy foam that is constantly dancing on the top.  Strong aroma of fruit, perhaps citrus, and cloves.  Taste is a great balance of bitterness, fruitiness and spiciness.  Less pungent than I would have expected from a trappist ale, particularly of higher alcohol content, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Overall, a great beer."
"Cheers"
"I will probably try it again later, and with lower expectations this time, so I might see something I missed first time round..."
"Unique, Very Distinctive, and a One-Off Trappist that is quite ""English"" in a strange way."
"This beer had some interesting side components that I liked, but the taste is the thing."
"Very pretty color, and thanks to the head it took me over a minute to pour. Not the best beer I have ever had but it was definitely unique and I enjoyed it. Belgian Ales are still new to me but I always appreciate them. Cloudy amber color. Complex aroma with candy and grapes in the nose. Malty, vinous, spicy flavor that stayed interesting throughout. At $4.50 a bottle I probably won't be trying this one often but it should be on everyone's list. I had a pleasant buzz at the end too."
"Lunar-eclipse orange with a massive, stiff head. Another aromatic triumph. Pine needles, sourdough, orange peel and clove all take turns on the nose. There is a really medieval feel to the aromatics. This is the beer they drank in Middle Earth, all resinous, peaty and full of crackling wild enzymes. The flavors are pretty and refined, somewhat in contrast to the nose. Sourwood honey, nutmeg, and roasted starch appear. A dry beer overall. A very fine, powdery grain on the finish. One unique beer."
"This is my first voyage into the tremendous world of the Belgian Trappist tradition.  The bowling pin shaped bottles emanates a fruity strong aroma that literally fills the room.  The pour into the traditional goblet is slow and the creamy head is thicker than harbor fog on top of the deep orange-brown sea.  The Belgian yeast imparts a definitive fruity slightly earthy flavor character with a malty alcohol warmth tucked in deep.  The mellow crisp hop character leaves a clean finish.  A well rounded flavorful wonderful beer."
"One of the best Belgian beers I've encountered so far. Outstanding!"
"Pours a great sparkling copper color. The best part of this beer stopped there for me. I just did not like it. It tasted like a farm smells (if that makes sense). Something just does not taste right with this one. An unusual taste that I could not really figure out. Bitter but not in a good way. Like paint thinner would probably taste. I am sure I may stand alone on this one but I will not be trying it again."
"The first thing I notice about this brew is the high amount of carbonation present.  Need to pour this one carefully.  The second thing I notice is a very strong aroma.  Pretty nice.  Somewhat fruity and phenolic. Some leather.  And sweet candy.  This beer is a chill hazed amber and shows an incredible amount of carbonation in the body of the beer as well.  CO2 bubbles rising to the surface faster than I can remember in a beer for a long time.  A huge sticky and rocky white head tops this brew.  The taste is very forthcoming.  Raw leather.  Musty attic.  Some bubblegum esters.  Subdued fruitiness.  Earthy, herbal and spicy.  And fairly bitter to boot.  This may not be my favorite Belgian beer so far, but I do like the character that this one shows.  A light bodied beer that doesn't feel as carbonated in the mouth as it looks to be on sight.  This is no La Fin du Monde, but it's nice in its own way."
"Of all the Trappist beers, I feel that the Orval is the most distinctive and unique - and probably the most misunderstood (or disliked) of the group. It can be a challenging beer at first, but it has great character if given a chance. It pours a lightly hazy pale orange-amber with a dense rocky head that lasts; eventually dropping to a thin creamy covering and leaving a beautiful Belgian-lace throughout the goblet. The tiny bubbles rising quickly through the beer make for a delightful little floor show! The high level of carbonation that produces the strong head, also helps it to give off it's very perfumy aroma. Clearly, there are some earthy British hops involved, Goldings and possibly Fuggles, amongst other noble varieties. In fact, I think this is the only Trappist beer that is dry-hopped (w/ Goldings)! It's fermented with 2 strains of yeast giving it enticingly complex aromas of leather, mineral, and wood. Again, the carbonation gives the beer a spritzy mouthfeel, making the body seem a little bigger than it is. The flavor follows the aroma with lots of dried fruit, and a sometimes ""metallic"" and intense dryness, leading into a somewhat acidic finish that leaves you with a memory of the beer that is more refreshing than mouth-coating."
"One taste and I didn't like it. Everything up to the taste was appealing. After tasting it, it left me disappointed. In fact I couldn't drink the whole glass. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but if this is what I have to look forward to next time, I'm wasting my time and money on a no nothing beer."
"Thick, foamy head falls only in the middle and sticks to the sides of the glass. Deep golden color with reddish highlights. Slight alcoholic aroma. Hints of leather and sulfur in the palate. Dry finish with hop flavors and bitterness lasting on the tounge. Great apertif."
"Nutmeg color, upcharging bubbles, 1/2 inch head that lasts. Spicy aroma, very wine-like. Very tangy with bitter notes as well, causes a pucker without a lot of citrus. Light-bodied despite a good amount of bottle feremented carbonation working its way out. Finishes extremely clean. There's a vinous and bitter flavor that's not for me, Bretts not working for me here. Obviously an icon in brewdom, Orval Trappist takes the Belgian Pale style to the limit. I'll give it a good rating on smell and across the board 4s on the rest. Not to my taste."
"The head is absolutely formidable--  incredibly dense, rocky, thick and sticky.  Combined w/ the copious, lively bubbling and clear, light amber hue, this beer is vibrant and visually appealing.  The aroma consists of black licorice, pepper, green apple acetaldehyde and sweet orange candy - like notes, w/ just a hint of phenol in the finish.  The flavor is comprised of caramelized sugar notes, w/ a hint of black pepper.  Most striking about the flavor of Orval is the relatively assertive hop bitterness that prevents malt sweetness from becoming dominant.  When combined with the relatively light body for style, Orval is almost dry, and is thus very drinkable.  The finish is dry, bitter, and a bit tart. Although the flavor doesn't deliver on the promise of the aroma, Orval is still an intense and unique beer."
"Okay, this is only my second Belgian.  It has a wonderful light orangish amber color to it.  Creates a nice light head, maybe due in part to it's colorful bubbly nature.  This of course gives it a slightly fizzy taste.  The aroma is different a mixture of citrus and others that almost imparts(to me at least) a bubblegum smell.  It has a nice body to it and a good finish.  I am more a fan of stouts/porters, but still quite enjoyed this."
"Dark copper maybe broze, solid white head that holds. An amazing array on the nose, smell often and long... citrus, apples, soil. Very hoppy with citrus and spice on the tongue. Nothing unlively about the beers, feels very different at each stage of touching your tongue, flowing over, and going down. I was very impressed. Expensive as sin but I'll make it a annual thing."
"Brewed at the Trappist monastery founded in the 1100s, this ale is fermented three times with three different malts and two types of hops. Unlike most Trappist ales, Orval has a powerful hop presence. It is a bitter-orange color, with a fruity and slightly sour bouquet. A wonderful hop bitterness and long, dry finish. Best served around 60F with stinky cheese or seafood."
"Pours a cloudy bronze with an orange tint in it's appearance. Floral hop aromas among other things on the nose. On the palate there was hints of pears and apple peals maybe, tiny sourness to it hard to explain but I enjoyed it a lot.  Very nice alcohol kick but its not at all over whelming. Ends with a nice long lingering finish. I thought it was an excellent Belgian Ale. Very pricey though$4.99 for a single 11.2 Fl oz bottle...that's beat."
"I tried this beer based on the beer advocates reviews and was very dissapointed. Maybe I had a bad bottle, but it was very over carbonated, the head blew up into huge bubbles and poured over the glass. (I used a belgium glass-Corsendonk is the closest I had.) The color looked inviting enough, but the big citrus smell was immediate. The flavor was ok, but was overwhelmed by the carbonation. The freshness date was 01082005, which may explain the taste. Did I drink it too early ? In any event, it didn't live up to the expectations I had. Not a beer worthy of a National Championship game."
"Cloudy amber liquid with good head and retention. Spicey with musty oak aroma. Complex, sweetish, spicey, malty, oaky, faint hop flavor. These characteristics blend extremely well when the brew warms. Interesting beer."
"A very good trappiste beer. Dry, hoopy, elegant, bubbly and just f***in brilliant, great beer and an absolute classic, i'd love to visit the monastry."
"The true Nectar of the Gods!!! If I had to be stuck on Island this is the beer I would take with me. With it's golden amber color to the incredible white head. The taste is impeccable an absolute frenzy on the taste buds."
"Notes: The sheer complexity of this fine ale is mind boggling ... one of the originals. This brew is all old school ... dating back to the 1100's. If you are into Belgian ales this will be a sure treat. Some soft cheese and dark rye makes a perfect pairing."
"I've only had one and had to travel to California (from Texas) for that. It reminded me a bit of Chimay Cinq Cents, but a little smoother, fruitier and drier. Update 12 years later: long available in Texas, this remains a go-to classic. Love the slight barnyardy character."
"A legendary beer.  Drinking an Orval is a unique experience each time - the fruitiness, subtle maltiness and high alcohol make it one to remember.  Not many beers can do that, and no beer has been able to imitate Orval.  Orval has that aura that very few beers ever achieve."
"Definite aroma of pears.  Beautiful fluffy head.  Very snappy and sharp at the front, then settles down to a mildly fruity hops finish.  Most Dubbels finish too sweet for my taste, and the reserved sweetness in this ale is appreciated.  Very complex and smooth.  Hoo-hah!"
"Strong and wonderful."
