"It looks like a lambic or geuze, but is a bit darker with slightly more foam on it.  The taste and smell are also like a lambic or geuze, but the sourness is somewhat milder, probably caused by the blending with a flemish old brown beer. I was not a fan of sour beer in the beginning, but this beer has me started to appreciate the sourness."
"Cheers!"

"Flavours focus on a delicious tartness, a little oak, light elderflower and lemon rind."

" The tasteis very tart like a juicy grapefruit mixed with malt and carbonated with zesty lightly hoppy flavor and dry woody character with some mild tannin and gentle flavor from the barrel. The taste is slightly sharp with mild toasted flavor which I suspect is part of the blend with finish acidic almost like biting into a grapefruit rind. Overall very good-nothing bad about this but a bit raw and bitter fresh, perhaps a little aging may help some of the sour flavors conflict for me but very decent overall."

"It hits all the right spots perfectly, but doesn't really wow. Still very very good."

"O - A very well executed twist on the lambic style. I was fortunate enough to visit Cantillon during my trip to Belgium, and personally I prefer this beer over any of theirs as this one has a bit more intensity and a much fuller carbonation. Really wish this was easier to find in the states, I'd gladly keep a bottle or two handy for a hot summer day."

"O: Excellent drinkability. One of the best sour belgian ales I've ever had. Extremely balanced and smooth. 7% ABV that cannot be noticed. Masterpiece"

"O - The lack of tartness is refreshing at first, but then you start to miss that tart punch. This is a blend of aged geuze and fresh Belgian blond ale, I need to remember that. But a very refreshing, tasty beer. Not quite worth the price, though."

"Overall, very good. The sour and funk adds a nice twist to the Belgian pale."

"Solid sour from a brewery that never misses."
""
"Great drop. Complex and confronting, but deeply rewarding. Beautifully reined in."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright deep golden color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with light funky barnyard notes from the lambic. Taste is a complex mix between some sour and tart notes with light acidic notes, green apple notes, oak and some funky barnyard notes also perceptible. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well put together with great amount of complexity while retaining a good level of drinkability."
""

"Deep golden colour with a bit of orange in there as well, ring of white head and just a touch of lace. Smell has a big dose of lemon, wheat and pear, quite funky, wild yeast gives this an acidic smell, a bit of spice is picked up as well, more fruit especially as it came to room temp. Taste is tart up front, a bit of a grainy sweetness and a touch of honey, fruity with lots of pear, lemon and apple, acidic and puckering, nice sourness throughout. High carbonation, dry and acidic, medium bodied, a bit of syrup at points. Delicious and easy drinking stuff, quite dry and very refreshing, I could kill a 750 of this on a nice warm day easy."

"Highly enjoyable beer here. I was hoping for more sourness but got over that quick. Very delicious and easy to slug down which isn't good for the wallet."
""
""
"A solid sour ale. The lambic qualities are great and it comes together very nicely."
""
""
""
"This is definitely a solid sour. Curious as to what it would taste like 2 years down the road. But the level of funk after 1 year was very nice. Not sure if I'd let it ride for anything more than 1 additional year."
""
""
""
""
"A decently balanced sour Belgian ale, the blended 'fruity' lambic adding an extra oomph factor, without going all over the top. Weirdly drinkable, especially when your taste buds have gotten all pent up in anticipation, which I suppose is a good thing here. Now, on the flip side, the ABV has been upped, yet the inherent tartness is just capable enough at hiding it. Huh. It's always something, with these Low Country offerings."
""
""
"Overall very tasty beer and one that took me by surprise as being one of my favorites at our tasting."
""
"Pours turbid amber with etched whites atop with a solid rim of the same fluffed bubble. Nice apple, copper, acetic vinegar, hints of lemon and funky hay and soil. Nicely tart up front and with a bitterness I’d not anticipated and some metallic and astringent character. Some leafy, vinous character along some unrefined vinegar. Thin bodied with hi carb and watering finish. An okay beer, at an okay price ($17/750ml). Actually a very sessionable, approachable beer with a sour character and a lambic twist. I would enjoy this with a friend at lunch time over a couple sanwiches with a friend on a nice warm Spring day."
""
"o - nice geuze vibe, not worth the price of admission in my opinion, but rather tasty. pretty surprised to see that this is classified as a BPA."
"The mouthfeel is medium-thin bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is dry, sour and earthy but not overly so of either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The taste profile is good but I wouldn't mind the sour be turned up a notch or two. I realize this is labeled a Belgian Pale Ale, but it has some gueuze-like characteristics to it. An interesting take on a Belgian Pale Ale."
"Overall: I have been eyeing this bad bot for a while and happy to have gotten the chance to enjoy it. Might have to have some more of this stinky beer in Maine next weekend."
"O- very drinkable not overly sour tart and funky on the palate a pleasure to drink ages well"
""
""
"Overall just incredible and real easy drinking. with such a fruit bowl quality, I am at a loss for words. This is a beer to just dive in and get happily lost."
""
"bottle wrapper says best by 2015. pours a mildly hazy, glowing golden burnt orange (if there is such a color) with a white head that holds for a bit and leaves a little lace. nose is peach, nectarine, grapefruit pith, grapefruit, oak, earth, funk and just a touch of pale(ish?) malt poking it's head through. smells wonderful. displaying all kinds of scents that turn my gears. taste is expressed in sweet/tart fashion with tart winning a bit in this case. flavors of peaches, peach pits, citrus, earth, fruit groves, wood, pineapple cake, nectarines and funk... wonderful. unique and familiar at the same time. medium body. some sweetness, but finishes fairly dry. i am usually impressed by de ranke. extra impressed here. i really like this one."
"O: Wish this beer had been properly classified as a sour and not as a BPA so I wouldn't have wasted $15 on a drainpour. Be forewarned if you don't like sours!"
""
"O- A solid sour, nice funk. Definitely, will pick up again, seems to be like a cross between a nice gueuze and Orval. Very easy to drink."
"Hazy orange pour with a surprisingly present off-white head. Tart fruit nose; some grapefruit, lemon, and sour cherry. Good bit of wood and some barnyard funkiness. Overall, there was something too sweet/tart about this simply because there were not more complex flavors underneath. Felt like I wanted more depth in the flavor, but ultimately it was thin as was the palate. Decent, but admittedly a bit of letdown given my high hopes."
""
""
""
"A terrific beer, but a bit too sweet to be ranked among the absolute best, though I'd certainly never turn it down."
"O: I see this is already rated pretty highly, but why don't people talk about it more?! Deliciously tart and sweet, with just enough bitterness to surprise the palate and keep things drinkable, this is a beer I'll be going back to again and again."
""
""
""
"The flavor is also subdued, but again is really tasty. Certainly acidic, with big notes of lemon and some lime coming through. There is a touch of vinegar, before giving way to a lingering brett funk. Finishes dry. Light mouthfeel with prickly carbonation."
""

"O: Great aroma, I was definitely pleasantly surprised by this one, pleasant excellent brett, definitely a worthwhile beer."

"O - Freakin fantastic."
"25 oz bomber. Pours a hazed dark straw color, fizzy head and little lace. In the aroma, strong sour and funky hay aromas. In the taste, lemon rind, acidic bite, rounding out with a small bitterness. Tart, funky, sour, and a portion of wheat malt. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, lingering bitterness and tartness. Overall, a nice, deceptively strong sour beer from Belgium. Whats not to like?"
"Notes: Tasty, but not as amazing as people have told me it is."
"O: Being so heavily one or two sided I feel that perhaps this beer is young. I think given time it could develop into something special."
"I really liked it, refreshing and different, a new favourite of mine."
"This is a really nice beer, a refreshing one despite the higher abv."
"Some beers have the perfect description to pull you in. This is one of them. It poured a very nice orange in color with moderate turbidity and a half finger off white head. It almost smells like a gueuze yet also has a light sweetness to it. All I can really get from it is peaches, apricots, and fruit juice. It's very appealing on the nose. The flavors are surprisingly VERY sour and tart. I expected it to be sour, just not this much. It's very impressive. It is straight fermented sour peaches and apricots. It has a dry and almost bitter finish which is the only detractor but it drinks really well. To me, this drinks like a medium bodied gueuze with more carbonation than average. I really enjoyed this one, it's a very nice beer."
"overall a sublimly light and clean sessionable ale"
"7.2/10"
"The Kriek de Ranke is great, so it came as no surprise that this one was quite good too. A great blend of beers that is somewhere between a gueuze and a Belgian Pale Ale. I think this cost me $9.99 for a 750ml bottle, and I would call that a deal."
"Poored a rich light amber with almost no head. The aroma was tart and of sour apple and had slightly floral notes. Excellent level of carbonation for the style. Flavor was awesome. Very smooth sourness with a hint of oak. Could have had the whole 750ml myself, but that would be selfish. Wish I had more."
"pour is clear at first and cloud towards the end. golden orange. nose is sour funk and apple cider vinegar and the smell of tarnish wood and ash. a hint of grassiness but more so like the minerals of flowers without the perfume. palate cuts into anything like a knife with the lack of any trace of carbohydrates or sugars. herbal hints of bark and rosemary. very sour and feels like hypotonic solution that absorbs everything into itself but at the same time leaves a delicate finish of pollen honeysuckle bitterness and a wet saddle leathery note."
"Lighter body, with refreshing carbonation. Alcohol is hidden very well. Acidity adds a refreshing factor. Amazing."
"On cask at Moeder Lambic. Drinks like something between a straight, flat lambic (which it is not) and a fully effervescent mature gueze (which it also, is not). A lovely beer on a hot, humid spring night, as it warms up, you can really taste the grain complexity which is rare in any spontanteously fermented beer. Overall this beer is a thing of beauty. I would not be surprised however, if in a bottle, this beer metamorphosed into something either better, or worse. Time will tell. For now, drink up if you can find it."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one to be quite drinkable and will definitely seek it out. While I’m early in my exploration of sour beers I can already tell that I’m going to like much of what I find and this was a perfect introduction. (When lunch was served it also went quite nicely with the salad greens and Quiche I’d chosen.) My overall impression is that this is a very well made beer and truly a reflection of the art of the blender as well as the brewer (who may in fact be one and the same person)."
"O- I was a little worried at first but this one grew on me quite a bit as I worked my way through it. A fine brew, but probably not one I could have on a regular basis."
"Smooth and creamy body from the cask, this was heaven. Really a wonderful beer that I'd love to get again in this form. I'll pick up more bottles at home some time, but really the cask version is best."
"Overall a killer sour ale. I've just started getting into sours, and will certainly be seeking out more from De Ranke. Exceptional ale."
"Lip puckering sourness--similar to sucking a lemon. The beginning has pale malt dryness. The full body is matched with a higher than expected level of carbonation. The aftertaste is a continuation of the tartness. I detect no hop."
"D: A fantastic beer from De Ranke, their best in my opinion, the lambic is a great addition, just a beautiful tasty beer."
"D- Doesnt get more drinkable than this for a sour. Im shocked theres not more talk of this brew on this site. This is such an innovative and tasty brew thats definitely worth seeking."
"The body is light-medium and quite refreshing overall. Definitely something I'd pursue in the future."
"Medium bodied with a great balance of sweet, estery light fruit and tart, puckering sourness. Funky with lots of musty oak and vinegar flavor as well as some slight lacto mid-palate but this is balanced out by vinous, sweet fruit notes, especially apple, grape and pear. The combination of sweet fruit notes and vinegary sour/tartness results in a sweet, mouth puckering, tart finish that isn't abrasive or acidic. Recommended."
"4/4/4.5/3.5/3.5"
"Overall I was extremely surprised by this beer in a pleasant way. Give it a shot!"
"I must have passed this beer a dozen times or more without buying. Wow, what a mistake."
"The feel has a champagne-like quality to the finish... The bubbles scrub my palate and tickle their way to the finish. The finish is mostly crisp, but something reminds me of ginger-ale. Very nice beer. This was easy to drink-- all 3 of us liked it and would happily buy it again!"
"(D)- A good sour. Very accessible and an easy drinking one that would be a good starting point for someone first getting into the style. This would also be a great sour to have with food. However, there is nothing about this that makes me think of a Belgain Pale Ale when what I see in front of me is a nice light-bodied lambic or gueuze."
"D-Very nicely done. An approachable and wildly drinkable lambic. Plenty of flavour and tartness without going overboard. This is a wonderful beer to introduce those unfamiliar with the style to."
"Beer is light in body and effervescent in the mouth. It has a bright sourness in the midpalate and a mild, ever so mild, sweetness at the front of the mouth. The overall shape of the beer on the palate is nice. The funkiness is underplayed but complements that lactic sour late on the palate. The finish is clean and moderately dry but the beer does not dry out the mouth. I could drink a gallon of it. I love this beer."
"Taste is quite exquisite with really nice earthy notes and funk plus peach, apricot, and some lightly-tart berries. Maybe some cloudberry presence. Feel is slightly puckering and creates a really nice finish alongside some dry funk. Really, really drinkable. What a great way to end the night; I'll surely be looking to find more of this in the future."
"Thanks Nic, for giving me the opportunity to try a beer I never would have tried on my own (nor will again). Pours a light amber color, with a small white head. On the nose, this one is very acidic, sour and barnyard-y. Thin on the palate, acidic, vinegar."
"The sourness comes quick and then fades just as fast. It would go great with a meal."
"D - Great session sour. I will not have any trouble finishing off the bottle. Perfect for a warm sunny day. Would be a great pick to introduce someone to sours."
"D -"
"d - I really liked the smell of this beer. The taste was good but a step down. Would definitely try again."
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with large white head. Once popping the cap off this guy, I got huge aromas of sour funk! Love it! Great sour notes with apples and wood. I also get very subtle floral scents as well. The taste is delicious! Initially I get a lot of tart green apple flavor followed by some funky Belgian yeast flavors with even more delicious mouth puckering tastiness. I get a strong taste of wood from the barrels and finishes with a bit of bitterness. I know there's some other fruit tastes I'm not picking up that I should be, but my palate is still trying to get these sour ales down. Mouthfeel is nice and bubbly, but not too bubbly. Very full bodied and well-balanced. Drinkability is HIGH! Great beer!"
"D: The drinkability is silly - too easy and if I had another bottle I would be pouring one now."
"Overall I had this back-to-back with Cuvee de Tomme and the flavor profile on this was smaller in both depth and width. Still, an easy-drinking beer for the style with a decent amount going on."
"Bottle. Best before 04 2013, so a little early on this one. Pours a slightly opaque golden color with a nice 2 finger withe had that slowly recedes. The aroma is grapes with notes of sour, if you can smell sour ;o) with the addition of lemon. The taste is sour and tart with the funk. Sourness and lemon zest abound. Pretty puckeringly sour. Light/medium mouthfeel. A very good sour beer. The paper wrapping has to add to the taste, right?"
"D- I had no problem having two glasses of this. It drinks very easily. Nothing lingers on the palate, its just a total easy drinking and refreshing beer."
"The palate opens sour with a lemony tartness with some a bright lemon and citrus peel sourness, along with a moderate melon character. Great depth and balance on the palate, there's a mild sweetness present, but it is more fruity than plain sugar-like. There's a splash of vinegar as well, just enough to keep the palate bright without being overbearing. The bulk of the sourness is lemony, though, and almost whelms the funk. Drying on the finish with a lingering lemon peel sourness and a touch of bitterness, this beer is a hidden gem. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, the palate is a little slicker than I'd like, but otherwise, this is an outstanding beer. At the price point, it's hard to beat, really, I will be drinking a lot more of this."
"A nice hazy golden/orangery color with a great sour nose of citrus lemon funk. The taste is filled with lemon-tart-funk blended with a nice golden ale and some oak. The mouth-feel is pleasant and the sour hangs around a little as to say ""hey I was just here a moment ago I left something to entertain the next sip"". I just want to keep on drinking this cellar temp beer in this hot humid New England weather. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer it reminds me more of a gueuze than a belgian pale-ale. I really would love to see what the bugs due to the golden ale over the next few years. This is an outstanding beer."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is tart lemons with some oak. The flavor is more of the same with a lot of tart lemons mixed with oak, some vanilla and Belgian yeast. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice sour beer that I hope to try again."
"Poured at a recent BA tasting event. Pours a muddy golden yellow with no head. Nose is oak, pinot, and chalk. Taste is about 4/10 on the pucker-meter, tastes like sour apple cider. Barrel flavors are present and there is a nice complexity. Acidic. Light on the palate, quite drinkable."
"Brouwerij De Ranke certainly hit a home run with Cuvée de Ranke. It's my understanding that this is the base beer for Kriek de Ranke. No wonder it's so tasty. There's not much to complain about here. Eh. Maybe the nose could use a little more strength. Perhaps a little more body, too. But, I'm good with this as it is. Not too tart, Not too funky...just right. Highly recommended."
"Reviewed from my notes. A chilled bottle was split four ways between tulip glasses with the De Ranke logo. The beer is opaque, with a creamsicle/orange color. There is a thin, splotchy foam head. The bubbles are white and soap-like. The nose lets you know this is a sour beer. There's apricot and brett (or something that smells like a beer brewed with it) in there. I like the aroma a lot. The flavor is a good mixture of puckering sour and mildly sweet fruit. I can taste apricot and peach. It has a great musty and dry finish. It is ever so slightly chalky tasting, mainly in the finish. This is a very good sour beer. It has a medium body and a very low amount of carbonation. There is a slight coating of the mouth that tastes both sweet and sour. The first thing I jotted down about the Cuvee De Ranke's drinkability is ""oh so drinkable," and I stand by that simple assessment. Obviously it will turn off anyone not prepared for a sour beer, but a fan of this style will love this. If you see a bottle, definitely pick it up."
"D - I could just continue to gush and gush about this beer, but the bottom line is this: if you like sour beers, find a way to get your hands on this beer."
"Poured this one from its 750ml paper-wrapped bottle into my Belgian-style goblet. Immediately became aware of the strong sour aroma going on here, anticipation is built well before I can get my lips to the glass. The color is golden yellow, very hazy and opaque, with a good amount of head. Lacing is present and head settles down. The aroma, as said before, is riddled with notes of tangy sourness and wild yeast. The taste of this beer is comes thorough on the promise delivered by the nose, with lots of twang and lively character. This is one that I'll definitely be coming back to while its available, and stocking up on so I can enjoy it when its gone."
"D- Fairly high.. really enjoyable and impossibly drinkable."
"Nice to see a brewer make a balanced, drinkable sour ale, one you would want to drink on many an occasion or with a meal. Top notch."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. This is a nice beer, I've liked everything from De Ranke thus far. This beer is refreshing, its nice to get a sour sometimes that isn't over the top. Thanks Preric!"
"Thanks to ritzkiss for sharing this gem."
"Overall I like this. It is a bit of a mixed bag of sweet - sour - bitter. I thought it would be more like the Ithaca Brute (or the othe way around), but the sweetness is present that shows the Golden Ale side. It would be interesting to see if and how this will age."
"Notes: I am sure that I need to develop my palate more to understand sours. This one was just something that I would rather not drink. Having just had the Kriek de Ranke, I cannot help but compare. At least that one had the attraction of cherries with lambic (cherries can be sour tasting at times so it worked better). Next up is the Guldenberg."
"Quite an elegant beer, and a bargain at only £6, especially if you consider its classy paper packaging. I will buy this again - possibly as a gift."
"The beer fits the gueuze style much more than any pale ale delineation, and does so masterfully. It's a beautiful beer that's impeccably balanced, extremely clean, and earthy enough to appease the most staunch sour ale connoisseur."
"Perfect blend of a lambic and Belgian Pale Ale. Quite impressive."
"M + D: Bigger in body, but nice and dry. Not the most accessible, but quite easy going in the sense of style. The vapourous dryness is great, but it takes a little time to work with. Recommended drinking."
"A fantastic gueze style pale ale. Cloudy pale yellow with a white head leaving decent lace. Nice tartness, lots of complexity, some lemony notes, dry. Very spritzy, fine carbonation. Really want to get some bottles of this after having it on draught. As much as I love their noël, this might be my favorite De Ranke brew."
"D - wasn't worth it, really."
"Supremely enjoyable is you are OK with some sourness. Sourness, some lambic aroma, and transparent appearance, and some yeast and head. This was nicely malted. A tad less than median mouthfeel. Average mouthfeel. Not as dry as expected. Wonderful with lunch."
"Poured into my favorite Stone Levitation glass. Incredible honey gold color, with a wisp of a head, fades quickly but this is a ale lambic mix,30% lambic, so the characteristics seem right on. The smell is lemon and sour and maybe some honey. The flavor is incredible: a bunch of lambic sour and a hint of hoppy goodness. The mesh is perfect. Light lambic mouthfeel with a coating on the back of the throat. Can't get enough. Cantillion, JP fans will find this beer a bit of perfection."
"D: This was fairly expensive (>$15), and I'm not sure it was worth it. A pretty good beer but not an excellent one."
"This is a good, solid beer that has some room for improvement. I would like to buy one to age a bit longer. Cheers!"
"Another excellent beer from De Ranke. A vigorous pour stirs up a small bubbly head but it quickly fades. No consolation though, this is a borderline gueuze in my opinion. First whiff is full of crab apple, lemon rind, fresh grass, and a familiar wet hay funk. Much the same in the flavor - dry and musty yet full of fresh juicy apple and grass, almost cidery. A bit sour but no so much that it masks the other more subtle qualities of this beer. More complex as it warms. Light carbonation in the mouthfeel and really just more and more fun to drink. De Ranke can do no wrong."
"Glad that Kane has this at Roof Brothers in Paducah, Ky."
"Notes from: 08/13/08."
"You could have fouled me by saying this was a Saison of Gueuze. If this came from Fantome, it woudl be a Saison."
"8/4/8/3/15 (3.8/5)"
"Pours a beautiful clear golden amber with a decent fluffy white head. The strong, fierce aroma is more like a cider or a brandy than a beer. Flavor is quite strong, mainly fruity with some malty undertones. It goes down the pipes like a tiger on angel dust - fierce, edgy and sharp. Not for the faint of heart!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart yet balanced, with cherries smacking the tastebuds on the way down."
"750 ml bottle wraped in paper. Pours a nice orange amber with a good sized head that dissipates rather quick. Aroma is wood, funk, some fruits. Just a bit too woody for me. Flavor is sour, but not too strong. Acidic. Full palate feel. Finishes rather dry."
"750ml bottle $12.99. Nice dark, cloudy orange color. It smells deliciously sour. The taste is nice and sour, musty, old, some bits of wood (lambic?). The only problem I had with this beer is it seemed a little acidic and was kind of hard on my stomach. Good beer but I probably won't bother cellaring any."
"Palate is surprising, as the sour flavours come through assertively, including a gooey viscous component that accompanies the sour flavors. The finish gives spotlight to the carbonation and it retains a passion fruit, maybe mango fruit finish. Again, faint bile, but in a good way (if there is such a thing)."
"pours up a reddish peach color with a decent size white head. also sporting some great lacing. the nose has sours notes, subtle fruits, dark red fruits in particular. the taste is sour, oaky, slightly musty, red fruits. has a medium body, low carbo, definately a scrumptious beer"
"This is really extremely drinkable. I have minimal experience with sours so this is really a great intro to them, I would say, as the blending keeps the sourness in check a bit. I really enjoyed this. Recommended for sure."
"First and only drain pour so far. My expectations could not have been more off on this one. If you are into sours, you might enjoy."
"I wonder what the base beer for this is? There seems to be a fair amount of residual hop character, including a herbal hop flavor and it make me wonder if the XX Bitter was included somewhere in here. Just a fantastic beer, it is very sour and funky, but not really ""hard"" and it is significantly different from the typical sour Belgian varieties of Lambic or Flemish Sour. It doesn't have the malt depth of the latter, nor is it quite as funky/sour or pale (in malt character and fruitiness) as the former. A singular beer that makes me think of some of the new world sours, but it has a refined quality to it (perhaps it is the lack of overt / aggressive oak) that many of the American sours don't quite reach. I could drink a ton of this and actually wish I had more than this one bottle so I could age a couple (that 2012 best by date seems to be calling to me)."
"D - A real treat. A nice blend that ends up as a more mellow lambic with a touch more fruit/lemon flavors. Highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Fairly good all around."
"Mellow citric lemony sourness, similar to a Gueuze. The Lambic edge is taken off from the Blonde Ale blend, which lets the subtle woody notes of the Girardin Lambic come through. Long aftertaste, sort of woody with wet citrus notes present too. Mild pucker, not as sour as other traditional Lambics, but sour-haters should stay away. The more I drank, the more I enjoyed it. This creative hybrid sour ale is definitely worth trying."
