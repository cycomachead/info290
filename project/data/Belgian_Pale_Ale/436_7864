The foam finally fell to some outrageous thick lace. Nose is light, positively gay with brett, Belgian yeast and some apple. Malt opens up as it warms with a little nut, bread and grain. Slight vinegar smell at first and then floral. Taste is more malt than the nose with plenty of biscuit, bread and caramel beside a tart sour apple. Yeast takes a backseat, there’s a touch of booze and it’s chewy with almost no bitterness. Finishes wet and without much aftertaste except for a very mild slick hop resin on the tongue. Very light and delicate. Goes down very sweet and has a thin body. For some reason it just doesn’t feel like beer.","utopiajane","Jun 01, 2013"

Taste is much the same (sans minerals) with an alcohol kick on the finish with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

I began to regret not having donned the robes of Bro. Woody of the Order of Disorder as the singing of angels could be heard around me. The head slowly fell like a penitent to its knees, leaving behind a beautiful, sticky lacing that begged to be licked from the sides of the glass (as if I were worthy). The nose had a bready, semi-sweet, musty yeast-driven quality that I had to drag myself away from. After all, beer is meant to be drunk, not inhaled. Mouthfeel was medium with an intense yeast mustiness up front, like putting your tongue on the Guttenberg Bible, followed by a sweet cotton candy-like flavor before giving itself over to a slight grassiness. The finish was semi-dry, not bone-dry, but on its approach with a definite yeast-driven flavor. it was about as good a beer as I have ever had from a CAN. Do they allow coolers in church?

An apple cider colorish body, although you could throw in a little copper to the mix. A good smell made up of a sugary sweetness (something along the lines of caramel or maple syrup) and a dash of yeast and spices. A weetlike taste follows, but the body (thin to medium) is a little too syrupy for me. I don't mind a sweet beer (again, I would say caramel and honey) with a good hop kick on the backbite, but a little sticky/slimey for my likeing. The problem is, if you were to eliminate this syruppy, runny feeling, you either cut some of the sweetness out of the taste or jack the ABV up (both of these solutions only create another problem).

A thin, quickly moving stream of carbonation rises from the center of the bottom towards the top to support the settling chunky head. The head ends up blotchy and thin. The aroma is similar to baltika #3 with a hint of belgian yeast. Sweet sugar with white grape undertones give depth to the pilsner-like characteristics of the beer. The aroma has a good hint of what the taste is like. It is also sweet and grapey with a relatively smooth and thick body. Decent flavor profile, but it tastes a bit cheap IMO. Good hopping toward the end, good balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. It leaves a sticky film in my mouth from the residual sugars. A little more alcohol would cut down on this a bit.

Mouthfeel is light, even for the style, with fresh acidity and carbonation that fills the mouth but doesn't overwhelm. Overall, this is quite a nice little Belgian blonde.

People who got turned onto Belgians via Duvel and who still love Duvel are advised to fall in love with this one.

The taste is also just fine, sweet but turning dry (almost tart or sour even) in a flash, lots of spices, white pepper, coriander, clove, yeast, bit of fruits, citrus, sweet, pretty nice. The mouth had a good body, but too distractingly carbonated, a little too dry for me, and just doesn't give a good finish.

Cidery or apple flavors come through with the alcohol. Body is a bit flatter than I like in a Belgian Pale ale--carbonation may be too high. Spices and co2 numbs the palate, leaving a slightly grainy texture and flavor. Estery hops and alcohol gives off some clove-like and pepper-like flavors.
