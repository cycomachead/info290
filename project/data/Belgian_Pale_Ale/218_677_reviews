"05/30/12 At first blush, a pleasant tartness that was reminiscent of cherries but not at all sweet. Blind tasted I would never check off the Belgium box, but would the 'I'll have another' box."

"Had on tap while in Antwerp. Pours amber colored with a fluffy white head. Aroma is light bready malts, faint yeast, and a bit of grass. Flavor follows with bready malt and crisp grassy finish, bit of caramel, with very little of that Belgian yeast flare, and extremely low on the sweetness. Light plus body with medium plus carbonation. Seems like quality of a Sam Adams for Belgium. Not bad, but not sure why one would choose this when there are so many other options."

"Amber twist to a Belgian Pale. Follows the nose with apple and pear, but picks up some drier bitterness and herbaceous hops toward the finish. Tasty and simple. Mouthfeel is carb-light, but still good. Great swish. Drinkable as hell."

"This tap has been here too long without me partaking of its contents. Time to rectify that. It pours a hazy rusted tawny topped by a half-finger of faded khaki foam. The nose comprises rye bread, light ruby red grapefruit zest, Belgian yeast, a hint of clove, and a few drops of maple syrup. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some mild grass and flowers for the sake of it. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice little BPA, nothing to write home about, but if you're here and need a bit of Belgian-ness, it's here for you."

"Ordered on tap at a Calgary ale house (1600) and arrived in a genuine De Koninck tulip glass. This iconic Belgian pale ale is in fact a fairly dark orange to reddish amber hue, with a little white lacing left on the glass as one proceeds. Aroma is classic Belgium, fairly strong and redolent with sweet and fruity yeast esters, caramel malt, and bright floral hops. Everything is well-integrated although the floral/herbal hop notes from genuine Saaz are striking. According to Roger Protz in ""The Taste of Beer", Saaz is the only hop used and with a fairly heavy hand I'd add. The aggressive hops lead the way on the palate, evoking lavender and fresh perfume, layered over a fairly rich caramel flavor with a little vanilla creme and dark raisin. I also get some green fruit sourness and the body is fairly heavy with a lot of residual sugars. Satisfying. Finish is similarly complex, with a rich buttery character, lingering sweetness and some booze accompanied by a dry pepper spicy bitterness. One is left with an overall impression of sweet dough, dessert sugars, and bitter medicine all bound together in a way that works, although some might wonder about a clash between the latter two components. I like it, personally."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is slightly sweet, a bit phenolic, and very easy to drink. My only problem with it was the hops. I understand Saaz are inherent to the style, but I really struggle with this particular hop. I just don’t like it very much. Fortunately the bitterning was dealt with a very light hand and I was able to look around them for the most part. Overall, very nice (3.5/5)."

"O: Good drinkability. Nice brew. Traditional Belgian Ale"

"Pours a dark copper hued amber with a small beige head, mild lacing. Aroma is fruity, apples and pears, yeast with some biscuit malt and caramel. Taste same as aroma with some bready yeast flavors, fruity with mild tart flavors. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet fruity apple and pears, yeast and bready notes. The ending has a pleasant mild tartness, some light bitterness and a nice caramel malt flavor. Overall I found this to be a very good and tasty brew."

""
"I could have had more than one in a sitting, since I didn't feel any of the alcohol aside from the taste. While I only bought one bottle of this, it was enough for a sitting. I like Belgian beers but don't expect one to be of the ""lawnmower"" type. That's what this was and with so many better offerings out there, only a true aficionado of this style should give this a go."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer to help settle down with after a day in the hot sun. This is by no means a lawnmower beer, however, as it has much more to offer. A contemplative nature would also allow it to accompany afternoons of conversation."
"O= This is a solid brew. I was told that this is what New Belgium modeled Flat Tire after and while they didn't quite get all of the nuances in this beer I would say it was an admirable effort."
"Did not score A, S, T, M at that time; please disregard"

"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."

"O: A malt driven beer with some spice; it's like a British Ale rubbed elbows a Belgian brewer. It's an unexpected and little brewed Belgian style. If you approach this beer expecting a typical Belgian you might not be too impressed unless you get it not tap where it is truly sublime."
""
""
"Elegant and flavorful taste, balancing malt sweetness and caramel with a mild bitterness from its hops and a hint of condiments. Slightly dry and malty aftertaste that comes right a way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very interesting beer with nice hop notes and some interesting fruity notes packaged in a pretty dry dark lager. The aftertaste does get a bit bitey even though the hop flavor fades. There was no date stamp on this bottle so I will have to try this on tap if I can find it for comparison."
"Good beer, a bit too expensive for what it offers."
""
""
""
"A classic example of the style. Proof that you don't need massive amounts of hops to make an interesting and satisfying pale ale."
""
"Overall: Not a great beer once you have delved into Belgians, but a decent starter beer."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear coppery amber with a thin, fine white head that dissipates slowly to a thick film with lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, faint light fruit and hops, missing any Belgian notes. Flavor is biscuit and bready malt and light grassy hops, very faint Belgian yeast and spicing. Tastes very similar to a modest American amber ale with a tiny amount of Belgian yeast. A faint hint of Belgian yeast in the finish. Light to medium bodied. Very attenuated flavor. No off flavors, but not true to style. A surprisingly mediocre Belgian ale."

"On tap at Cheeky Monk in Denver. Pours amber with a short-lived white head and much lacing. Aroma is of fruit, caramel and cotton candy. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is fruit, caramel, some spices and cotton candy. Finish is short and dry. Nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's light-bodied with moderate carbonation, creamy but a little thin. All in all, it comes together pretty well though I can imagine the differences between this and the stellar ones."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A really unique tasting beer and easily drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"medium mouthfeel quite low carbonation."
"Too sweet and needs some more fizz to clear palate. A bit of a disappointment. Not horrific, but we can do much better"
""
"Overall impression - I just can't get past the fruity twinge with this one."
"Color is a burnt orange/amber hue. Initially has quote a frothy head but I found that it dissipated mostly. The beer is carbonated however. In the aroma I am picking up pear and apple, and apricot fruit flavors. As I sip, the flavor stays true to the aroma with ample fruit esters, intermingled with toasted malt. A touch of hops in the finish Very light mouthfeel, and very refreshing. I wish this was my 'everyday' beer!"
""
""
"Notes: Tasty drinkable and a nice finish. Cheers."
"O- I would like to try the other beers from this brew house, but won't need to try this one again..."
""
""
""
""
""
"D. alcohol is a little out of balance, feeling like more than 5%. still, an enjoyable beer."
""
"250ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Ruby/amber colour, clear, one fat finger head. The smell was described as ""homebrew bockbier gone wrong"" by a tester on biertestonline.de, was a bit strange but didn't put me off. Had a yeasty rasberry taste. A bit like a thin dubbel. Decent mouthfull. Overall drinkable but would probably be better on draught."
""
""
"O: Weird, not undrinkable but certainly not ""good."" Won't have again."
"I never had De Koninck before it was acquired by Duvel Moortgat, so I don't know if it has changed. The reviews don't seem to always be describing the same beer, though, which is never a good sign. Still, it had a lot of pleasant flavor. Not sure about the ... yeast. Or whatever it was."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice beer. I'm glad I found it on tap."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty nice, but nothing exceptional."
""
""
"OK, but not great. It seems unbalanced, with the grainy malt/yeast flavours too dominant and lacking in complexity. Also, the harsh finish is a let down. To be honest I have yet to try a beer from de Koninck that I liked, so I guess I'll keep searching."
"Clear gold/amber in color. The head is thin and doesn’t last for long, leaving minimal lacing. Unpleasant vegetal, mossy aroma with a bit of berry and spice. I am fairly certain that the beer was out of date and so I will try not to be too harsh. Light-medium body with a balanced carbonation. The aftertaste is crispy, slightly dry and soapy. I am jealous of those who were able to try it on tap."
"Overall: Tamer than I had expected. This is my first of the style so I do want to familiarize myself with it more. Taste and aromas are good but there isn't much about this brew that sticks out."
"O- I wish this didn't have the appearance problems, or this would have scored higher. I will try it again to see if maybe I got a bum batch."
"Overall: For the price this is a really good beer with that being said it does lack flavor but is really drinkable."
"Overall, this is a good amber from belgium: clean and well balanced."
"De Koninck tastes mild, as well. It's got some hop bitterness, but these are not aggressive hops, these are the world famous Saaz hops, which must spend a lot of their lifetime just chilling out, because they're very mellow. There's something else going on, but I'm not quite sharp enough to figure it out -- I'll leave it at a certain barely detectable level of funkiness. De Koninck is crisp, clean, and extremely drinkable."
"De Koninck surely will not be the best beer you have from Belgium, but it's a great intro lesson to their style of brewing. More tempered - but still pleasantly fruity, moderately sweet, sufficiently malty and somewhat spicy - this ale is apt to appeal to a large segment of beer drinkers, particularly those with developing tastes or newly adventurous palates."
"An interesting brew. 'Grainy' and 'tart' are rarely going to be adjectives that yield a positive drinking experience for me, but keeping style in mind, this was actually quite drinkable. (My wife, on the other hand, was really looking forward to that tripel, and was thus a bit disappointed...)"
"Overall. Good, well rounded beer with some hoppy bite."
"D-Easy to drink and still goes down smooth after a couple"
"Wow, I'm not sure I've had a Belgian beer that tastes like this. It's bland, mild and incredibly thin. While it's not actively unpleasant, it is not a Flanders Red Ale, not in colour, not in aroma, not in flavour, or spirit. Quite weak indeed."
"I would prefer a BPA with more of a funk and a drier finish, but this sweeter more full bodied ale is also tasty."
"An enjoyable enough Belgian amber ale, like something out of a baked cracker box. Not a lot of yeast or sourness stand out in this one, but that hardly detracts from the overall drinkability."
"D - Like it, but I don't know how many I would want at a time."
"D: I could easily have several of these in one sitting because of the beer's low alcohol content."
"The appearance would have been better if my daughter (yes, she's over 21) who brought it to me had not slurped off the head to keep from spilling it. But, I can't blame her for sneaking a taste, as it was such an enticing brownish amber in the De Koninck glass. This is a refreshing crisp ale, with perfect carbonation and a smooth palate, finishing with a lovely but quickly fleeting slight bitterness. Good full mouth that matches well with the subtle nose as you quaff. Overall, a good beer for year-round pleasure, but especially suited to cool-but-not-cold seasons."
"Drink- Was pretty tasty. Would like to try some of their other styles."
"If the flavor were better it would be pretty drinkable but it's just sort of there. I probably wouldn't by it again but I probably will by something else from De Koninck in the future."
"Beer poured into specialty glass . Amber red in color tight carbonation. Head sticks and laces the glass well. Smells of sweey carmamel malts and a grassy hop. The beer is very malty grains and caramel coming out. Some fruit esters with a a grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel is drying like a wine and moderate in body. Very drinkable beer. Solid beer all around."
"decent special belage"
"A solid beer that is almost always a good yet somewhat safe choice."
"Drinkability - Pretty easy drinking beer with enough complexity to keep things interesting."
"Mouthfeel leaves you a bit dry on the end. This is definitely a sessionable Belgian Ale, which is pretty refreshing considering most Belgians these days are one and done."
"Pours a semi-translucent amber with a loose, half inch, off-white head that quickly disperses towards the edges, leaving a bubbly band and a bull's eye dollop in the center. Nose is very subdued but suggests green apples (maybe a little vinegary), as well as Saaz hops and grains. Taste is big on earthy grains and malt with perhaps a trace of acidity. A biscuity quality lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, with a carbonation that starts off crisp and slowly tapers off towards the back, ending with a semi-dry finish. Decent and drinkable, but not much going on here and the doesn't particularly warrant a future purchase for me considering the price."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery. Drinkability is low because there is not much reason to drink a lot of this. I will probably pick up a Duchesse De Bourgogne to see ifthere is anything to this style. This beer was disappointing."
"Mass-produced and nothing special - just a good time sink inbetween better ex-beer-iences."
"This beer marks my first for the style and it didn't leave me impressed. Bland, unoriginal, and watery. I'd still give this style another try, but this one, never again."
"Easy drinking stuff, for sure. My kind of session beer."
"It's pretty drinkable, albeit pretty bland."
"Drinkability: I finished my bottle with relative ease, but I will not be buying another."
"D: At 5% abv, it is low enough in alcohol to be an easy drinker. The amount of carbonation makes it bloating, however, and the skunky part of the flavor makes it hang around and build too much on my tongue."
"Drinkability: A little light when it comes to flavor and complexities, but, considering it's just a mere 5% ABV, it ain't half bad."
"A nice amber ale, but not sure how it calls itself a Flanders Red. I get some red malt like flavors, but no Flanders sourness. That just doesn't make sense to me. Overall a nice mild amber Belgian ale though."
"D: Easy to drink. Not overpowering in any sense. Would never buy more than one at a time."
"D - This was a surprising little treat. Had never seen this one at a pub before, so was quite impressed with the amount of flavour this foreign amber ale had."
"Comments: A beer of the month selection. I am still curious about what I have read of this beer's subtle complexity, so I will definitely try it again."
"Amber colored with minimal carbonation and visible sediment. Smells of sour mash and fruity esters. My mouth is watering, so that must be good. Taste is peppery crackers, with a nice slight roast and a slightly dry finish. There is a little something hay-like in there as well. Very balanced, VERY drinkable. Mouthfeel is soft & a touch undercarbonated. Drinkability is fantastic. This is a bit high to be considered a session beer, but I wouldn't kick it out of bed. Very good in a very subtle way."
"Overall, glad I didn't this one. Drinkable but nothing really there to remember it or make you want another. Don't recommend. [N;N]"
"D: Not really a very good beer. Very watery and mild in terms of flavor, but I honestly had no expectations going in."
"D: Very easy drinking Belgian Pale Ale, but nothing outstanding here. Could drink a couple but would not seek out."
"Drinkability: taste is slightly above average. Pleasant, but not the greatest example of this style. If I was at a bar that specialized in Belgiums, I would bypass."
"Overall, this is a good beer. However, Belgian Ales are my favorite and I can think of a dozen that I would purchase over the De Koninck. On the other hand, I also prefer strong Belgian ales to Belgian Ales of this type so if you are looking for a Belgian Ale without a high alcohol content this may be a good choice."
"D - A terribly average beer drinking this makes me think of a macro that comes from Belgium its not bad but nothing really makes it stand out there are way better Belgian Pales to drink before this one"
"Interesting take on the style, and one I can see both love and indifference towards. I was expecting a Blonde, and I found a Brunette. Best by 05/05/10."
"A more than normal mouthfeel and a good drinkability."
"Overall this was kind of a lackluster Belgian. The metal threw it off a bit. Maybe I was expecting more out of his beer. I'd like to try it on tap if I had the chance."
"D-Worth trying and drinking. It has some redeeming qualities. I'd love to pair this with some Lemon-Garlic Broiled Mako Shark Steaks that I whip up every now and again...doesn't overwhelm the buds by any means...subtle sums it up best...."
"Not bad, and one of the few session ales from Belgium, but nothing really noteworthy here."
"This is a fine Belgian Ale, as good as any I've had."
"Good overall, seems very exemplary, almost quintessential, of the style. Tasty & complex, & I think 2 would just about do it for me."
"Had this on draught at D.B..A in Manhattan. It was suggested by the bartender and it was a good suggestion. Good dark color and very clear. Flavor was quite esthery but well balanced with the malt. I liked this beer a lot and will have it on draft again. I think better than the bottle version."
"Drinkability: Maybe not a noob friendly beer, but drinkable nonetheless. Its ""charismatic"" enough to warrant further attention although theres definitely better brews within the style."
"A nice, sweet, candied fruit mouthfeel with some slightly hopped, full-bodied structure and balanced finish throughout."
"Pours a clear, amber color with some suspended sediment. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, pale malt, slight roasted malt, and some hops. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, sweet malt, and slight hops. Overall, a weak bodied pale ale, but a great bodied euro light ale."
"A standard Flanders Red that shows moderate traits of vineous, woodsiness, grapes, cherries, and red wines. A fairly still look later allows the lacking carbonation to play too thin and dull on the palate. Solid browns show some hazy red highlights. Malt taste balances beer maybe too much. Definately a step below Duchese du Burgogne, Rodenbach, and Vignerone."
"Its a bit watery on the mouthfeel, could have used more body definitely, but the slight tartness gives the beer a refreshing quality. This is probably the only beer I have ever 'session'ed' with three pints in a row."
"Overall: I have to admit that I had this beer after drinking Bommen en Granaten and 10 commandments at home first. So for me all the flavors were a bit weak this time. But of course I know how it tastes from the previous times I had it, and how I enjoyed it! It is a nice beer, really similar to Palm Speciale beer. The only thing I really didn't like, is the metallic taste this beer often has...."
"Served on tap into a chalice like goblet. The apperance is on the darker side but i wouldnt call it dark. Sort of a burnt carmel color. Not too many aromas present on the taste. Tastes great, very creamy with carmel and molasses flavors, slightly malty. I like this mouthfeel, went down smooth and creamy. THis was a quality beer and i would drink it again."
"D: Highly drinkable. Although no one element of the beer stands out as exceptional, I found myself wanting another as soon as I was done. A great session beer."
"This is a very nice treat of a beer. I would reccommend this as a session beer if it were more widely available in bottled form. An excellent draft beer."
"Not a lot going here but still overall a well-made tight little beer. Not a lot of aromas coming out but I'm getting cherry malt(?). Carbonation is a kinda weak leaving the beer feeling a little syrupy. Some more malt action on the palate, not much hop-wise going on. Still, I don't dislike it at all, but it's not really blowing my skirt up."
"D- Despite the lower mark in the mouthfeel department, I must say that this beer is wonderfully drinkable (and a great follow-up to the Kolsch I just had!). Tons of flavor and a decent body all with relatively little alcohol!! I would love to have this on tap again!"
"De Koninck poured a nice amber color, with a small tan head, also showed nice lacing. Smell was of fruit, malts, hints of citrus. Taste was from fruity, citrus, nice malt. Good sweetness and Belgian yeast flavor. Mouthfell was good, and drinkability is very nice. Good session beer, nice flavors, for the price however, you kind find things on par with this beer."
"D: An easy-drinking beer that isn't anything special, especially for a Belgium ale. My first beer of this style, however, so not sure how it compares to other Flanders Reds. Still, definitely an agreeable beer."
"Really easy drinking and pleasant on the tongue. Don't think I've ever seen this on tap in America but it's quite ubiquitous in Amsterdam."
"Taste pretty much falls in line with an American amber ale with Belgian yeastiness. Flanders Red seems a bit of a stretch here. Yeast is pretty soft and has a white bread flavor. It is light bodied and well carbonated. Slick mouthfeel and quite tasty. I could drink a few of these. Good beer."
"Certainly goes down easy, and has more flavor than most ambers, but not what I was expecting. I'd get it over most macros or uninspired pales, ambers, or lagers, but I prefer most decent American micros over this."
"D - Okay. Nothing to write home about."
"When poured, the foam was a very light/white wheat in color, semi-creamy, a little bubbly and had small layer till the end. The color was deep amber with mahogany highlights. The smell was deep, rich, some lemony accents, some malt undertones with some light chocolate and molassis hints. The taste was a dominate bitter hops overtone with light chpcolaty highlights and wheat undertones. Mouthfeel - light-bodied and simple. Drinkability - at first seemed to be a nice complex beer, but had a general American lager feel and aftertaste - ok session."
"30cl bottle poured into a Westmalle Trappist glass. Pours a beautiful amber with miniscule head that disappears within a few seconds. Very light aroma of yeast maybe? I can't place it. Very light taste with a smooth palate. Not bad but not at all interesting. I think I'll pass on seconds."
"This is the first Flanders Red I can recall trying. It is certainly interesting, and drinkable, but not exceptionally so."
"Forms a one-finger thick head on top a clean body of amber. The head retention is mediocre. Aroma is....kind of there. Faint fruity notes (watermelon) mix with some dry cardboard notes. Tastes like...well there isn't much I can taste here. There's some light traces of Kool-Aid fruit punch. Some toast and toffee flavors emerge, but they are still relatively light. A dash of vegetables here. Oveall, it becomes tastier and more pleasant to drink as it warms, justifying a bump in the score. A nice little ""light"" ale to come from Belgium."
"Medium-light body with medium-high carbonation. A little chalky in the mouth and slightly astringent. The astringence I attribute to age and abuse along with the oxidized flavors, staleness and sourness. Thing is, it is still a very refreshing beer that shows its potential. Unfortunate that the long voyage has been so damaging, it just makes me want a fresh example that much more."
"Nice beer not one to seek out but not one to be turned down either."
"Dark gold color. Smell of malt. Taste was not what I expected, not Belgian. It was low on the taste of abbey scale. I'll say what my friend Butch said. It is kind of funny that its an ale and tells you that it is a top fermented ale. O.k. back to the taste. It was very good, just not quite what was expected. But yummy. It left just a little to mouthfeel, just not quite the Belgian. But still a really good beer. Really easy to drink since it wasn't like most Belgians, but I'd drink lots."
"easy to drink not much oohs and ahhs."
"Pours a nearly opaque light chocolate brown with a thick, fine-bubbled ecru head. Aroma is malty, hoppy and subtly chocolaty. Mouth-filling malty flavor has hints of molasses, chocolate, nuts, hops and spice. Texture is smooth, fizzy, and quite pleasing."
"This ale pours with an amber hue and a large head, that lasts well. Nose is really delicate, but shows a touch of spicy/peppery hop character and sweet fruity malt. Flavor is clean, dry and herbal. Better than almost every U.S. amber ale. Better than Heineken."
"Overall, not bad, but not great. Pretty middle of the road, with very mild flavors and aromas."
"D: Not very high in abv and a bit boring. An alright beer, but not my favorite of the style."
"D: A good pale ale out of Belgium. Very easy to drink, a nice beer that's not too expensive."
"I think there is definitely a dry licorice taste to it and is quite carbonated. The taste is mild, dry, but the carbonation makes it quite refreshing. Very good afternoon beer."
"D= Not difficult to drink, but the sum of the aroma and taste would not make me go out of my way to get another of these."
"All in all this was an average beer. Luckily it was rather inexpensive so keeping that in mind it's a fair deal for the money."
"Everything seems balanced alright could be a session beer just a different taste."
"Mildly drinkable, but the large chunks of sediment in the glass prove a bit unpalatable. Perhaps a different bottle would prove more drinkable, but this one suffers as it stands. Certainly worthy of another try, though."
"One of the best session beers produced in Belgium."
"Picked up a single at Syracuse's the Party Source. Appears a clear amber, no sediment, with a short white head. The aroma is surprisingly plain, with a just a hint of Belgian-spiced vanilla. The flavor does better, with a tart lemon undercurrent that builds as you drink. There's also a hit of apple juice, mild caramel and finishing peppery hops. The flavor is respectable, while the aroma leaves much to be desired. Worth a try for a sessionable Belgian."
"Poured a dark brown/red with little head of lacing. Smelled of sour bread and malt, no hops aroma. Taste was of a malt bomb with a touch or sourness; where are the hops? Tasted almost rusty or tinny to me in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkability for me was poor, as I'm not into that taste profile at all."
"Drinkability: This is an ok beer, and it drinks quite easily. It taste quite nice as well, but I can't help feeling that it falls somewhat short. But bluntly, it's a bit flat. However, considering the low ABV and it's decent overall character, I could see myself having it again. But I recommend serving this one in a glass with a more narrow body than a Duvel-sized tulip, considering the successive loss of carbonation."
"nice fruity nose of raisen and sweet malt. nice full mouthfeel feel to start but once carbonation gone seems to thin out. very underated flavor profile but it works. nicely carbonated. a bit sweet but very drinkable and overall quite nice. i would buy this one again. $2 single how can beat it."
"Definitely recommended as a ""try it and see"" beer."
"Easy enough to drink, but not really refreshing or quaffable. I'd have another one, but I don't see this as a must-try."
"Not good. Pours clear amber with floaties and a quickly-dissipating head. Aroma of stale malt and dsuty wood. The taste is acidic; some malt with yeast, but mixed together to form the dreaded sweaty gym sock. Maybe this was a bad one that left the brewer. Either way, I don't want to know. Avoid."
"D: Nice drinkability, easy going down. Wont wow you, but wont dissapoint as well."
"Pours ruby read with a ine-finger off-white, quickly fading head into a Duvel tulip. There is very little head retention. Smells a bit yeasty and spicy. Deep down some fruity notes are discernible. Tasted fruity and tart with a vinous essence. There's a sweetness involved that stops just short of cloying. It goes down smooth with a light to medium mouth-feel. This one's good for a change, but one is enough."
"	-Glen Yarbrough"
"For me this beer has some mystique about it - maybe the fact that there is a real local vibe about it in Antwerp, which by the way is a great place to visit."
"D: It's okay...reasonably complex, with some interesting flavors. A bit too metallic and thin for my taste. I'd drink it again, but not a beer of choice by any means."
"The beer is a decently crisp and is a decent brew overall."
"D 4.0 - Not my first pick, but I would drink this again to get more exposure to this Belgian style"
"D - Overall, a great beer. This could be a great session beer because of the low alcohol. Really pleased with this purchase."
"D - Watery enough to drink lots, but I won't have another."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and dominated by a pleasant malty aftertaste. Likewise, the drinkability is also above average."
"D- not like the flavorful belgians i'm used to, however its lightness and smooth character would make it a great brew to kick it with (ice cold) and maybe even straight out of the bottle... oh no !"
"the beer starts out promising, with your usual Belgian flare of banana and spices, but there is a bread-like aftertaste that's a bit off-putting. There is almost a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste as well, which is odd considering it's only 5%. Not to say it's a bad brew, but for the price I was expecting a bit more."
"A nice enough beer, but it will probably be a while before I order it again."
"Not bad."
"Crazy to think this beer has been around since 1833, I always see at BevMo and have never grabbed it, the sales pitch on the bottle says it is made with crystal clear water and top of the line feremented malt, only got one tonight mainly because it was the cheapest thing on the menu and it was low in alcohol because I still had to drive eighty more miles home, might drink again, worth trying"
"A solid, sessionable beer, but certainly not what I would typically turn to if I was jonesing for a Belgian. Pleasant enough, but nothing especially striking about this beer in any form of delivery, save perhaps the aroma. Glad I tried it, but it's a forgettable Belgian ale on the whole."
"D - This is a nice session beer, not too crazy, but clean and well done. The slightly toasted malts are highlighted quite well. It really reminds me of a Fat Tire to a certain degree but not entirely. Obviously, this brewery has been around much longer than New Belgium and I can't help but think that it might have been an inspiration for the recipe. Nonetheless, both said beers are still unique in their own way."
"An easy drinking Belgian. It has a nice malt/hop (Saaz) interaction. No candy sugar or adjuncts used here. One to grab for a ""sessionable", straightforward brew from Belgium."
"If this beer is a Flander's Red then some of the characteristics are right on, but the sourness/tartness is missing"
"Recommended..."
"If I didn't know this was made in Belgium, I would have thought this would be cross between a British Mild and an American Amber (low-hopped pale ale)."
"Pours hazy amber, not much head. Looks and even smells a bit like a marzen. Nice caramel and sweet fruity smell - hints of apricots and maybe peaches. Taste has all that and more. Taste is reminiscent of that style as well but obviously aley, more fruit and no diacetyl. Got to love caramel without diacetyl. Big malt presence for a 5% beer, mouthfeel exceedingly smooth. There's no apparent hop flavor (as there shouldn't be) but a balancing bitterness is definitely present. Amazingly balanced. The heavier mouthfeel doesn't take away from drinkability at all. It goes down all too easily. De Koninck may not be as big and bad (I mean good) as some of its Belgian brothers, but I think its a solid choice, and a bit underrated."
"A simpler beer than I had expected."
"A solid brew, but I prefer the fruitier Orval in this bracket."
"Drinkability: A great entry level Belgian beer; extremely easy to drink; somewhat interesting but not challenging or distinctive at all"
"Overall, a well-done beer. I don't know if its as good as some of its Belgian brothers, but certainly drinkable."
"Pours a medium dark amber with a quarter inch off-white head and slight haziness. Aromas of bright citrus, banana, clove, raisin, sour apple; almost closer to a Flemish sour style than a Belgian Pale. On the palate, I first get struck with a cooked vegetal flavor, followed by a concord grape tinged malt flavor. This finish just hints at a hop note, but no describable bitterness, just a bit dry. Overall, there's some interesting flavors going on that I'm not sure I like, it's not the cleanest Belgian I've had either."
"I'll keep an eye out for this."
"Not a bad beer at all, but it does not hold up to some of my favorite Belgium beers. Worth a try though."
"Poured a murky amber color with a foamy head that settled pretty quickly. This brew has very tart aromas, faint yeasty smell, musty wood. Taste matches the smell, not overwhelming, bt tasty, tart fruits come through. Light mouthfeel combined with the low abv make this a good sessions beer. I enjoyed this, a little pricy, a good enjoyable beer to enjoy throughout the day."
"This is a very pleasant beer. Very drinkable."
"Pours pale amber with with a thick, creamy head with excellent lacing. Smell is rich and bready with some touches of caramel. Taste is similar, primarily bready and yeasty with some light fruit flavors. Soft and light, and quite smooth in the mouth with a touch of tannins on the end. A simple pleasure."
"Pours a clear amber with lots of lacing on the way down. Nose is slightly yeasty and slightly sweet, though the environment I tasted it at was probably not the best for it. Flavor is smooth with a slight sweetness and a touch of mature bitterness. Mouth is smooth with bubble. Drinkable, yes. But still not the greatest Belgian brew I have ever had."
"Tastes of biscuits, toasted malt, yeasty spices and a fruity tang. The hops add a bit of bitterness for balance. Good drinkable beer."
"Review added 11-24-2007, translated from french 3-2-2008."
"Drinkability- Interesting beer with many good qualities. Would like to try a fresh one again to see if the sourness is standard."
"As good as a ""light"" belgian gets, a good summer or session option for belgian lovers."
"D - Nice enough but nothing that would make me rush to buy it again."
"Overall- Nothing spectacular here, but definitely an easy session beer."
"Not very tasty, but 11 ounces of this just goes down so quickly, that you'd hardly recall anything negative about it. Not worth the import price for something with such an inflated best by date."
"Drinkability - High, a complex taste that isn't too strong, the perfect choice for a session beer or for food accompaniment."
"Good but not great. I've had a few before this one, and it never blows me away. Standard stuff, but for Belgian beer that means it's at least still worth checking out."
"Overall a tasty and highly quaffable pale ale."
"A not bad Speciale but I am still puzzled over its classification as a Flanders Red Ale in BA."
"Drinkable, but not too exciting. Nothing offensive, but rather bland. Decent session brew, as I could see that drinking a bunch of these would be possible. But, the beer is lacking character to make it interesting enough for me to want to drink more."
"A very drinkable beer, pity about the aroma and head, otherwise we would be looking at a higher score and a true classic beer."
"Notes: Ehhhh...rather lackluster without much of an identity. Not my cup of tea but I can respect that it is a quality offering without any flaws other than it didn't fit my palate."
"Amber with a huge head and a bready nose this beer is a truly great example of a Belgian session beer. Malts are the main part of the taste but the hops also show up to create a great balance that makes this very drinkable. The beer finishes semi sweet with the nice yeasty tang at the end"
"It pours a amber color, and a sweet smell. In the taste I was kind of anticipating a bit more. Then I got it. It is just an amber. Light enough, but not to light. Easy to drink, and it pretty much is what it is... a standard Belgian amber, and there is nothing wrong with that, but not my style."
"Beautiful color. Would go nicely with sushi. High enjoyable brew."
"A decent, inexpensive Belgian for a warm Spring evening."
"There is nothing Belgian about this. Weak insipid mouthfeel, with flavors reminiscent of home-brew gone bad. Overly bready, and desert dry with medicinal hop flavors. More of an English Pale ale than a Belgian Pale ale. This is extremely disappointing, especially once cost is factored in."
"A nice Belgian pale ale, but nothing spectacular. Definitely worth a try if you're a fan of Belgian ales. No major complaints (except the lack of a head); it's just that it doesn't stand out. I'll most likely get this again as it's usually pretty affordable."
"Mouthfeel was a little thin but matched the taste in that department. This was not the best Belgian beer I've tasted, but not entirely objectionable. But I doubt I'd buy it again."
"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. ABV is 5.0%. Brown colour, low head. Moderate but pleasant fruity aroma, hints of spices. The flavour is spicy with moderate malts, not very sweet, pleasant to drink. Relatively high carbonation in the glass. This is not an ""extreme"" Belgian ale in any way, and no ""challenge"" for the beer enthusiast, but probably an ale that most people will like."
"Light amber color with a thin collar of white foam. Light aroma of toast and sugar. Flavor is a little sweet with light toasted malt accents, and a candy like taste common in many stronger Belgian ales, but not as pronounced. Medium bodied and travels well from sip to swallow. From previous experience I would recommend drinking this beer in Belgium as your session beer, because it's more interesting than a pilsener, and their other more famous beers will put you under the table - fast - if you try to make a night of drinking them exclusively. Pace yourself with De Koninck."
"Not a great brew. Pretty average actually, meh."
"Pours out a dark copper with a thin head and rings of lacing. Nose is mostly of a rich, bready, nutty maltiness with a heft of dried fruits as well. Flavor is of those rich malts once again and some fruity esters. I get a mix of both dried and fresh fruits. Dark sweet bread and apple finish this up. Mouthfeel is rather light and bubbly, but doesn't wash off of the palate too quickly. Decent drinkability, but it really doesn't keep me interested enough to make me want to drink more than one."
"Tastes like a yeasty American PA, which, I guess, is what it is. The hops came in at the end and bit fairly hard. Odd for a BPA, but good nonetheless. The biscuit and spice dominated the palate, caramel subsided. Easy drinking, I like this one."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is a little out of balance, feeling like more than 5%. still, an enjoyable beer."
"D: Drinkability is fair, but why bother. There are so many better Belgian Pale Ales to spend time with. Not impressed."
"The beer poured a deep orange, almost light brown color, forming a 1/2 inch head, that quickly faded, leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet, but somehow, reminded me of how a cider smells. The taste is sweet as well, very fruity flavor, maybe mild hops. The mouthfeel is light, and smooth. An interesting ale, but not one that I could drink more than one of during a session. A little too sweet for me, but still worth the experience."
"M&D - smooth and very drinkable, would make an amazing session beer, not too thick or heavy, probably one of the more drinkable belgians"
"Goes down easy, poundable even. But why waste your cash when there are much cheaper macro alternatives out there?"
"Taste is heavy malts with some caramel and some roasted malts. The beer leaves a dry feeling and is highly drinkable. There is some bitterness to balance all the malt. Balance is the key word here. In the end the beer is little sticky, but that is just very little."
"Very enjoyable, but I find it a bit watery."
"I just wasn't feeling this brew. I had it years ago on tap and enjoyed it. Has my palate changed, or is this stuff just not too great in the bottle.?"
"Overall, I would say this is a pretty decent, refreshing and drinkable beer, and I'd be inclined to get this one again to keep the inside of my fridge company in the future."
"Very creamy and quite drinkable."
"A decent drinking-beer, but there's little special about it."
"330 ml. bottle  color of amber , clear  small white head - nose of honey , jasmine , yeast , cherries , and yellow apples  taste of sweet fruit , floral , slight acidic grape taste , and malts , light  watery body , low carbonation  aftertaste low acidic grapes with some caramel"
"Great light rose petal amber with some hard to see bubbles amongst the hazy hue and ambiant lighting of the dining area. Good aroma of spicey amber malts and roses. Very intriguing. Roses. The floral aroma of this beer carries over well to the tongue. Like rose petals and sugar. This is a great floral beer mixed with the normal Belgian spices that those goofballs toss into their beers. Goes down easy but not a perfect session beer because of the rush of spice and flowers."
"Amber in colour with medium carbonation. Vanilla caramel and mild banana aromatics... perhaps a bit of corn syrup too. Flavor wise, the caramel evolves into more burnt toffee territory. Peppery yeast notes appear mid taste and evaporate into a slightly bitter and drying grain husk finish. Way more thin than I would have expected, considering all of the caramel aromas. Even though its intended to be a lighter style of Belgian ale, ""Light"" doesnt have to mean light on flavor or compexity. This one is a bit too ""light"" in both regards."
"Drinkability-- I hear that in Washington DC they have this on-tap at The Reef in Adams-Morgan, and it's known as De Chronic due to its popularity and addictivity."
"First taste is quite sour, then gives way to a soap-like taste, corn adjcunt seems to be there, and some sweeter candy-like malt notes. Very tart up front, very much like cherry cough syrup at times, and the underlying sweetness is a bit much. Finishes herbal with a taste like red wine vinegar being the dominant aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit warming, mildly carbonated, and quite dry. This is one Belgian I'm not excited about at all. I would find more than one to be altogether too much, no balance, muddled flavour profile, and a little cheap tasting if I dare say."
"Decent beer, very sweet though. Mine was on tap at a nearby restaurant.. I only ordered it after my first two choices were out. Served in a proper glass, at an appropriate temperature. My biggest complaint (besides the sweetness) would be the level of carbonation. I didn't think it was carbonated enough at all. Not sure if this is typical, or a product of the tap."
"D: At 5% abv? Hell yes. Incredibly drinkable. If you want your socks knocked off by huge flavor, this isn't your beer. But it's subtle, well-crafted, and enjoyable to the end. Recommended."
"It would go well with moules et frittes"
"The mouth is smooth and a bit oily. Easy drinker that is well worth taking for a test drive."
"This Belgian ale poured a nice , clear , reddish brown color , with a foamy tan head that left a nice lace. The aroma is fresh , toasty , earthy , some sweet fruitness and a slight hop spice. The taste is also fresh and full ,very smooth, some toasty malty flavors , bit of cinnamon , dusty , nice grassy hop bite in the back, and some yeast. The finish is slightly dry , imploring you to taste again. An exellent Belgian Pale ale. Very freah,smooth, and drinkable brew."
"I'd pick this up again if I saw it at a decent price in a six pack, but there wasn't anything really memorable, unlike a few other Belgian offerings I've had, that would make me actively seek this one out."
"Not a bad pale, but nothing really stood out."
" I think this may have been my first Belgian Pale Ale (I find that hard to believe, too). I enjoyed this greatly on tap. I will gladly drink this again."
"Pours a dark amber. The head shows its self only if it is forced and then runs away showing not a trace. The smell, however mild is probably the best thing it has going for it. This might be o.k. for some foods the way bland crackers are so as to appreciate the cheese more, but definantly not interesting for a solo drinking beer. I am sure I will never buy this beer again. Not the worst, but surely not even close to the best."
"D- Very nice Belgian Ale. Nice to find it on tap for a change. On of the few Belgain that could be a sessional and a darn good one too."
"D: Pretty boring and unassuming. One of the weaker Belgian offerings on the market."
"Had the pleasure of drinking this beer at the Sharp Edge. Medium amber body with a thin off-white head, but there were lighter amber highlights that almost seemed to sparkle. The aroma had a hint of malt and fruit, but nothing exceptional. The taste was smooth, perfectly balanced hops and malt with a nice bit of character that must have been from the yeast. Finishes a little dry, but this lends to its drinkability. Enjoyed the second half of this beer with dinner, and I must say it goes very well with food. Not a unique beer when compared with other Belgian ales, but a very solid, balanced, well-crafted ale."
"Mouth: This beer tastes precisely how it smells, with big berry flavors up front and a drier, sour/bitter hop finish in the back. It's very fizzy upon entering but smooth by the time it's ready to be swallowed. Leaves a gentle bitterness behind and completely masks the taste of alcohol. Very easy to drink!"
"I think this beer might be a decent session beer. It has a slightly graiting flavor, but with the relatively low alcohol, it is easy to drink."
"Due to it's odd finish, I wouldn't enjoy drinking more of it. If this is a belgian ""pale"" ale, it's one on steroids."
"Served in appropriate De Koninck glassware. Appearance was amber and very clear, with a fair size head. I did not pick up much from the aroma beyond the usual malt and hop mix, but neither seemed to predominate. The taste was well balanced, but hops seemd to come through more strongly. I picked up some spiciness in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium in body, with fairly high carbonation, and a drying finish. Very drinkable, as the dry taste keeps you coming back."
"Poured to a bright copper with suspended yeast, absolutely no head or lacing. It had a very weak aroma of some spice, may have been cinnamon. Flavor of cinnamon and hops, but had a dry, sour finish. I have three more, and will try these, but not real impressed with this one, especially for a Belgian Ale."
"Light body."
"Nice stuff."
"Pours a medium brown color with a medium off white head that looks like its going to stick around. Smells of malts, mild hops, and a bit of raisin. Highly carbonated and feels almost like a cider quite odd. Taste isnt really doing it for me, even though its only slightly above 5% abv I can still taste the alcohol, however it does have some pretty decent malt flavors and a smidgen of hops. I dont know just something about this Belgian Im not really digging too much. Oh well at 99cents it was worth a try."
"I could probably put down a lot of these on a night out clubbing in Antwerp, as it's certainly much more pelasing than an american macro, but not very interesting."
"Not one of the best Belgian ales I've had, but it's not bad either."
"D: Awesome! I finished half a pint before I knew it. This is a very refreshing brew."
"D - a very tasty, smooth drinking Belgian that doesn't overwhelm you with the candy sugar or fruitiness you find in a lot of Belgians. On the other hand, I was not blown away. A solid Belgian pale ale."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Drinkability and Overall: A classic. The perfect, easy drinking yet full flavored and full bodied Belgian ale. Definitly one that's perfect for a session."
"You need to sit with this one for a little bit but it's at the very least pretty good."
"I really like this one."
"Pours out a clear but deep ruddy copper hue, small fizzle of off-white head with little retention. The aroma is predominantly chewy caramel malt, with light notes of floral hops. Things get a little screwy in the flavour dep't. Metallic and grainy at first, never saw that coming, then there's more of a toasted malt profile in the middle, with some of that sweet caramel malt coming out towards the finish where some grassy, almost herbal hops make an appearance. For some reason this all just doesn't come together for me, it turns me off. The mouthfeel is fairly average, neither too watery nor very full. Perhaps this bottle didn't receive the tenderest of treatment from the brewery eventually to my glass, but assumptions aside I have to go by what I've sampled, and I found this to be an ale that does nothing for me."
"A bit of a disappointment in my books."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Very drinkable, and only 5% abv - nice to find a good Belgian that won't knock me on my ass after a few. I wish this was easier to find in my neck of the woods."
"Pours a clear amber. Little head. Light fruity nose, malty highlights. Mostly malt onj the tongue. a little bit bready , light spice. Some hop bitterness on the finish. Light mouthfeel, little to no carbonation. Somehwat watery. Too one dimensional, malty, for high drinkabilty marks."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep yellow color ale with a huge foamy dirty white head wit pretty good retention. Aroma of Belgian yeast with sweet malt. Taste is quite refreshing with some mild sweet malt and nice dose of Belgian yeast. Medium dry finish with a nice above average body. Very good take on the style."
"I found this at Merchant's in Dearborn. Too bad I can't find it in OH yet."
"Pours a crystal clear orange/brown, medium thick white head, some lace. Smell is honey, cherries, spice, citrus and grass. Taste is malty, with some iron, cherries again, citrus, alcohol and a bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonation, quite a refreshing beer."
"Got this on tap and it came a lovely golden brown with a thin small bubbled head. Smelled like cranberries! The flavor started like cranberry, but spread into brown malt for the sweetness, and a citrus sour. Finishes dry. Mouth feel is thin with a heavy carbonation."
"To the nose we get a ripe fruit (plumbs?) smell mingling with caramel, spices and some wet hay...but all reletivley understated...excellent nose. Medium-light body, creamy mouthfeel. Sweetish toffee-like malts mingle with fruity tastes from the yeast and some mild bittering in the finish from the hop mix. This is a light, but flavorful Belgian ale...very,very drinkable...I wish it were available here all year."
"I would not drink this in large quantities but would enjoy it as a one off or perhaps with smoked meats or pickled apperitefs"
"This is a really great Belgian Pale Ale, it would make an excellent session beer. All the flavors are well represented and nothing dominates. It should be bottle conditioned though."
"The flavor was ok, but it did leave me wanting more. It wasn't the freshest bottle, so this might account for some of my disappointment. The flavor seemed quite weak, not nearly as strong as other Belgian ales that I've had."
"330 mL, best by 11/23/05 - served lightly chilled in a tulip. Pours a coppery color with some stuff floating around, and it's topped with a 2 finger, light tan head that is creamy and leaves some lacing. Smells of malts (nutty/earthy/very toasty) along with spicy hops, yeast, phenols, and a bit of plum and chocolate. Lots of toasted/nutty/earthy malts on the palate along with some floral/spicy hops that leave a mild to medium bitterness. Some yeast, banana, and clove show up toward the end. It has a medium body with a carbonation that is a bit prickly at first but becomes smooth. At first it reminded me of an American pale or amber, but the phenols and yeast traits became stronger and let you know it is indeed a Belgian. Overall it is a delicious Belgian pale with a nice hop kick."
"Comments: This is a very nice complex beer IMO and I was surprised when I saw the overall rating it has received. I think this beer is oddly underrated here on BA."
"Competent, worth trying."
"This Belgian pours with a red/pink/amber color that made me a little nervous. The taste was okay, but the finish left me hanging-looking for so much more. It starts off allright, with a hint of cream trying to break through, but then doesn't. With the middle there was a bit of a bite and the finish just wasn't there. I probably won't go back to this one, because there are so many other Belgians of higher quality out there. However, I know the rep for this brew and would like to give it another chance along with their cuvee."
"Overall a good one, and one I would definitely buy again, this time checking the freshness dating, because if this is old, I'd imagine it would be awesome fresh."
"A very drinkable ale"
"Body is medium, slick on the palate, and quite easy to drink. A somewhat timid entry in the world of Belgian ales."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a thin tan head that recedes quickly. Aroma is caramel, candied fruits, bread and fruity ale yeasts. Taste is nice blend of sweet malty flavors (bread, candy sugar) and spicy hops bitterness and some funky yeast in the mix. Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonation is light and drinkabilty is descent. A descent belgian, nothing spectacular but enjoyable nonetheless"
"Golden amber colored with polite but noticeable lace. Fruity Belgian esters everywhere: crisp and filled with overripe pears. Vinous. Initially crisp on the tongue with slight pepperiness that leads into a wonderfully silky malt character and surprising, catch-you-off-guard hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is slight and almost biting, but overall this was one tasty ass beer that sort of showed up many Canadian examples of similar style and weight."
"poured a depp amber color with large white head that lasted thtought consumption of the brew. Smell is slightly of malt. Taste is slighly of malt with a background of a mild spice. Very smooth in the mouth with a lingering dryness. A thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"Overall Impression: Finally got to try this ""exclusive"" at a Wetherspoon's pub in Norwich. I'd been wanting to try it since I heard about it, a classic Belgian pale ale served from a cask. It wasn't a disappointment. If you like DeKoninck, you'll definitely like this. It's subtle flavors are, well, less subtle (i.e.- that cinnamon component is a little more pronounced and you get more banana esters). Pretty tasty."
"Pours a one-fingered white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Nose is sour plums. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Starts with a good mix of malt and hops, finish has some sour undertones. Not as harsh as American pales. $1.45 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Drinkability: as an intriguing and pleasant hybrid of English bitter and Belgian ale, I find it much sweeter and richer in body than its normal keg version, but still think the original version tastes fresher and more quaffable...especially when I tasted it on tap in Antwerp. So... give the handpump back to one of the few hundreds of micros which deserves more attention, please!"
"Clear coppery amber colour topped by an off-white head of fine bubbles that formed a thin lace. Good retention. Hop aroma was floral and a bit perfumy. Fruity aroma as well, mostly pear. Fairly complex flavour with a strong hop bitterness. Floral hop flavour and pear/plum fruitiness. Malt sweetness appears at the start, but this disappears and allows some light pepperiness at the finish. Light body with moderate carbonation and a somewhat creamy texture. Certainly highly drinkable, light and refreshing with plenty of flavour."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thin offwhite head that fades to lacing. There are lots of yeast floaties present. The aroma is decent. It has a nice, but weak pale and roasted malt scent with a slightly tart Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a very weak and watery pale malt flavor with an equally weak Belgian yeast finish. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a very forgettable Belgian ale. It's weak and devoid of taste. It's one and done for me."
"Pours a slightly reddish gold under a two finger white head that lasts forever, with good body and contour, but leaving just a few drops of lace. Sweet grainy malt with a hint of raspberry juice in the nose. The mouth is very prickly, slightly cloying but reasonably light. The taste opens slightly sour, perhaps cherry, which nicely complements the bready malt taste. A noticeable dry hops bitterness joins the party somewhat later, making for a fairly complex flavor profile. The usual francophone fruity twang is here, but the hops provide nice balance. The aftertaste brings back the sour cherry. A very pleasant, multi-faceted brew."
"What a weird looking beer, seems to be a suspension of small flakes on the inside, almost looks like a shaken snowglobe, wondering if this is a bad bottle. No Head on the pour. Definite diacetyl in the nose, with light carmel and hops in the background. Taste is not bad, somewhat smokey and bitter from hops, with nice maltiness. Mouthfeel is thin, but sufficiently carbonated. Weird beer, I may have to try it again with a fresher bottle."
"Hope to find this on tap someday. I have a feeling that would make a difference."
"Had agin there 1.5 years later, slow change of the lineup, and it was more drinkable, more creamy,less carbonated."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Bolleke"
"Taste is not exactly complex. Basically the same as it smells. Grassy and lightly bitter. Fruity and crisp. Body is a bit thin but pleasant. Nice character for a subdued beer. Bitter aftertaste. Crisp. Very drinkable, a good session beer. I have a soft spot for this one, drank plenty the last time I was in Antwerp. A different, more pleasing beer on draft but a fine, if not complicated belgian amber."
"733"
"Found by sheer accident in a Escondido, California (a long way from Antwerp!). Pours a clear copper/amber with a thin head. Aroma is sweet malty, generally clean and non-descript. Flavor is pleasant, malty, and wih a gentle slight hop bite. Not a complex beer, clean and simple. Nice drinkability and pleasant, but not a lot going on. I have heard that it is better on tap in Antwerp- I can't wait to find out, because this did not grab me."
"Not much whitish filmy head adorning this clear, darkish orangey-brown beer. The aroma is of peanuts, with a little sweet, flowery fruit. A spicy, dry, nutty start. Spice persists through the somewhat water middle. Not very sweet. Finish is nutty, dry. There is some lemon and pepper. It's not bad. Nutty, spicy, a little fruity. But a little thin, water. Good, but just underwhelming, I guess."
"A Belgian Bass but better."
"Clear copper in color with a fizzy, spotty white head. The aroma is lightly spicy and refreshing -- slightly lemony hop aroma with an ""outdoorsy"" character. Medium-bodied in the mouth with an understated carbonation, and dominated by a biscuity malt with an ever-so-slightly toasted character. The finish is grassy and earthy, with a light spice tingle. Not bad at all, easy to drink, though certainly not exciting. A good summer beer."
"Drinkability is OK, but I like stronger brews."
"This beer reminded me of ginger ale. Somewhat reminiscent of a kolsch, light, carbonated. Even looks like Canada dry. Certainly refreshing, and there is nothing unpleasant about this beer. Better than a majority of lagers, but not as good as most ales. Kind of a strange in between."
"11 oz bottle, freshness dating of 9-17-04 . Pours light almond, with orange tinges. Not much head and no lace. A bit of bubblegum and sweatness in the nose. Flavor notes include some malt, candi sugar,, bublegum notes and some spicyness. Seems a bit sour for the style. so so Belgian, not too exciting. Decent for an everyday quafer, but theres better stuff out there."
"Pours a deep copper to light amber with a thin, soapy head that leaves behind a touch of lace. Aroma is very light, with toasted malts, peppery hops and a touch of must. Flavor begins with some toasted malt, lemon, and some light bitterness in the finish. Has a medium body, low to medium carbonation, and a dry finish. All in all a very nice beer, but not one I'd go out of my way for."
"In respect of the on-tap versions, one word of warning... this beer can taste rough, acidic and sharp if you are unlucky. Some cafés don't sell enough of it, or maybe the stuff left in the pipes from last night doesn't get flushed out before they start pouring again in the morning, but just note that if your first one doesn't taste good it might not be your fault. Complain and they will will give you another."
"($1.49 / 11.2 oz / 33 cl)"
"Overall: One of the few Belgium beers that is distinctly better on draft then from the Bottle. A nice bottled offering and my marks reflect that I have an aged sample (though not out of date). A Bolleke of this in Antwerp served on Tap, with a swirl of yeast of course really does still take some beating. Maybe better when fresher in the bottle, dont leave it too long in the fridge or buy older sample of it would be my advice."
"Sampled on tap at an outdoor cafe in the Antwerp city centre (Reubans Section). This stuff is excellent. The appearance is dark golden with a lovely white head. The aromas are of alcohol, various spices, sugar, yeast, and hops. The taste is quite sweet up front, malty in the middle, and bitter (hoppy) on the finish. The mouthfeel is slick and nice and the drinkability is quite good!"
"Pours a hazy golden brown, with a weak head (and poor retention at that); yet it is lively and effervescent. The smell is of bread, fruit, and a grassy background. The flavor has a crisp start, sweet middle and a dry, spicy finish. The feel is smooth and slippery with a balanced effervescence and a lingering dryness."
"The yeast in this is pretty distinctive. It definitely carries a Belgian quality, but for stands out from others in its distinct fruity spiciness, creating a nice underlying profile of aromas and flavors that ties the different aspects of the malt and hops together with its own interest."
"This beer was ok, a fairly standard example of the Belgian pale ale style. Nice and easy drinking, but nothing to make me feel like I needed another one. Really not too much flavor in this beer, overall it is just lacking in those flavorful beer qualities. I quickly moved on to a duvel that I saw on the menu, you should too."
"Drinkability  This would make a good session bier, IMO. I didnt much care for it personally, though."
"For the price, this is a great beer - a couple dollars cheaper than most other Belgians on tap. Another one that I'd have one or two more of............just so sweet that many beyond that wouldn't be likely!"
"A good beer"
"Red-orange body topped by a uniform finger-and-a-half head, and dropping. Rich fruity nose, oranges, plums, and some candy notes. Unfortunately, the taste is less complex: sweet, but the aspects are much less defined. And there is an annoying chalkiness in the center of the aftertaste. A disappointment."
"Slight ripefruit (peach) sweet malt nose. Very carbonated hazy pale pink look with a slight white head. Light taste of candi sugar sweetness and a little white pepper. Medium to light body and mouth. A little bland on the flavor side and flat on the tongue."
"Nice amber colored ale with hop presence in the nose and the taste. Very light with a nice mouthfeel and smooth body that leaves a lasting head. Is good at any occasion but especially with spicy foods as the hop balance is more prevalent. Low ABV makes this a highly drinkable ale."
"Appearance: Pours a nice amber-ish color and is topped with a decent off-white colored head which fades fairly quick and then leaves some Belgium lace. On the nose the aroma is of spicy hops and fruits.The body is medium. The taste is of spicy hops, fruits. Fairly smooth mouthfeel overall a good brew."
"Fresh from the AOBF! This cloudy amber beauty is topped with an off-white foamy head and a thin trail of spidery lace. The aroma is citrusy and slightly peppery with a hint of spices. The medium bodied malt is lightly sweet and quite crisp. The citrus and spicy hops and in abundance. Lightly fruity with faint camphor flavor. Fairly complex!"
"Very good."
"Beer pours out rusty/amber with a decent amount of yeast globules hovering in suspension. Nice and creamy orange head dissipates within about a minute. Kind of a spicy hop/sour malt smell with a yeasty undercurrent. Delivers a clean yeasty taste with a decent supply of malt and hops in balance. It's kind of watery, but not without flavor. Therefore it's quite refreshing served cold. It's pretty smooth with a toasty finish. After finishing one, I can see myself enjoying another - maybe due to the 11.2 fl. oz. sized bottle, or maybe due to the slightly complicated nature of this refreshing ale."
"The appearance is nice-- pleasant amber color, clear, medium head with slight lacing. The mouthfeel was soft with a nice balance of carbonation. The aroma after the initial shot of Saaz hops was followed with a light malt and sweet water character. Taste had the similar sweet water quality, like a N/A. Some dryness and bitterness on finish, but not necessarily pleasant. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone interested in a trial of Belgian beers."
"I liked the nice dark gold/orange color with nice head,smelled very malty with some spiciness in there.First sip was sweet and as I drank more a nuttiness a appeared,it has somewhat of a dry finishGood well rounded highly drinkable Belgian-ale would love to try on tap sometime in the future."
"This ale poured an amber color with modest white foam. The smell was also modest: malt and some musty grape scent (characteristic for many Belgian ales). The taste was malty, with the tell-tale musty grape flavor, as well as some floral hop flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and clean with medium body, light carbonation, and low bitterness. The drinkability was good: very clean and refreshing."

"Pours hazy amber in color with only a trace amount of head that dissipate into a thin lace. Nose is sweet with notes of apple peel, dark fruits, spice, and is also a bit medicinal. Creamy medium-bodied brew with a complex flavor. Taste is lightly toasted sweet malts up front followed by a malty bread flavor. Middle has notes of doughy yeasts and lots of spice such as vanilla, clove, and allspice. Fruity towards the end with notes of ripe apple and a touch of plum with a dry finish. I prefer their Cuvee beer to this one, but this is still a very enjoyable brew."
"The beer has a nice crisp mouthfeel. Fruity and plummy flavors, and also very malty. It's remeniscent of many Belgian stong ales, but without the high abv. Overall, it's very drinkable and refreshing. It would make an excellent session beer. It would be even better on tap."
"Has a slight spicy yeast flavor that bubbles on the tip of the tongue. Extreme smoothness is accompanied by a fruitiness and a slight caramel taste as well. An exceptional ale, pairing well with my block of horseradish white cheddar. Mild and easy to drink, yet full of flavor and delicious. Worth finding."
"What can you say? This is just another fine Belgian beer. The fine blend of malt & hops is not necessarily exceptional but is noteworthy. They definitely know what they are doing. I prefer the Cuvee to this one but I still really enjoy the flavor. Very smooth and clean on the palate with an enjoyable nose to compliment the flavor. I had this with a chicken in pesto sauce & cheese which turned out to be a great combination. Again I will highly recommend this one to try and it will not be unusual to find it in my fridge at home."
"the taste is very simple. sweet malts followed by a welcomed hop bitterness, and a dry finish. there is nothing outstanding about this beer, but it is just good. i can't pick out exactly what i like, but i guess it is just the balance and the hops at the end. it is medium-bodied, and very smooth with some tingling carbonation at the start. towards the end, it gets a bit richer and more full flavored with nice spicy hops throughout balancing the malts at the start, and dominating the finish. this is simply a great beer"
"Pours a nice amber copper tone, and filled with a white frothing head that was short-lived. Some hints of some hop aroma, but the sweetness from the malt is more apparent. At first taste all that I could detect was the the vienna malts. After letting the beer sit for a little I noticed that this beer is very simple in flavor with some mild hopping, but what makes this beer great is that it's finish is so crisp and smooth that this beer is a satisfying treat to be experienced."
"First sip is malty with a spicy/peppery finish from the hops. Very well balanced. Reminds me of a blonde bock but not as strong. Goes down easy and will be trying to brew it ASAP."
"Pours with a firm just off-white head over an attractive coppery/amber liquid. Nose is of new-mown hay, very delicate aromas. Taste is malty, though not heavy-handed maltiness. Leaves a clean aftertaste on the palate. Very little hoppiness to speak of. Light bodied finish, makes a very agreeable ""session"" beer...if I found this on draught it would be very easy to put alot of this away!"
"Clear redish-copper in color with a whisper of white foam in the head. Slight spicy smell and color was the high light of this beer. Could not taste anything exceptional. Was disappointed with the flavor and after taste."
"Slightly hazy copper color with a thick and creamy off-white head that maintains superbly; sheets of carbonation rise up the walls of the glass.  The lace is quite good, leaving prominent rings in the glass.  Aroma has a pronounced medicinal quality with underlying sweet and spicy notes.  Taste begins with malt flavors then flows into a distinct apple peel taste accompanied by spices, among them cloves, I think.  Finish is dry with a hopped edge. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety.   An excellent beer."
"Clear, deep reddish-copper in color with an off-white head that holds OK and leaves a good collar with some whispy surface foam, and some good lace. The aroma is bold and welcoming with a gently dark fruitiness, a soft spiciness, some toasted maltiness, and a light suggestion of hops. The body is medium-light with a very fine, and somewhat limited, carbonation level. Very smooth in the mouth with a light caress on the tongue from the gentle effervescence. The flavor is delicate; with a toasted, biscuity maltiness from Vienna malts, a light spiciness (I think from both the yeast - or a possible spice addition - and the Saaz hops), and some medicinal phenols that smooth as the beer warms. Well balanced. The finish is short and dry with just a minimal lingering earthiness. This beer is very drinkable and continually beckons you to have another sip! Very clean and crisp. Quite surprisingly full of character (though not complex) for a beer that starts at only 11.8 Plato. This is what I think of as a standard Belgian artisinal ale. Well worth seeking out, and probably worth buying by the case."
"This is a beer I’d have in my fridge at all times, I have to work on how to get some in my local liquor stores … or even better get it on tap if that is possible."
"A very nice beer, easy to drink, nice and dry with hints of clove, cinamon, caramel. Great on tap, and great to have a lot of, good stuff, but perhaps a bit expensive outside of Belgium."
"De Koninck is being sold in gift packs with a bolleke (the glass it's traditionally served in). Warm malty aroma with visible flecks floating in the beer...? (This must be an old bottle. Still tastes just fine.) Yeast imparts a tang and spiciness to what otherwise feels like a soft malty British ale. Quite refreshing without being too vigorous. Comfortable and full of character - well balanced. I imagine this would be a good introduction to Belgian style."
"Had this on tap and a fine brew it is. Very smooth on the palate. Not as complex as some Belgian beers, but a real pleasure to drink. Amber colored with dense head, mild yeast spiciness and toasted/nutty malt flavors that blend into one another well."
"I wish I lived in Antwerp so that I could call this my local brew.  Good in a bottle, better on tap.  Nice golden color, good lacey head, a nutty, malty flavor and a dry finish.  I could drink a lot more of this if it weren't over $8 a six-pack."
"Notes: A great Belgian Speciale."
