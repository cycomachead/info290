"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a shaped pint glass. Pours semi cloudy golden color with a white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of sweet grain and Belgian yeast. Tastes of sweet grain with almost a taste of corn. Beer is heavily carbonated light bodied, nice finish. Overall, an above average beer."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A decent mix of character that I wasnt crazy about but the hops kinda worked with the yeasty spice since it wasnt too bitter."
""

" Overall a nice beer. Not the best of style but a very drikable beer."

"overall nice Belgian ale! recommended."

"This is a nice version of a fruity (esp. banana), mildly spicy BPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very nice BPA knockoff. Not quite in the same league as Duvel but a hell of a lot less money and just as enjoyable to drink. Another well made beer from NG."
""
""
"Overall, Stone Soup is my new favorite from New Glarus, (as the Alt isn't around anymore) and I can only hope that limited distribution brings this wonderful brew out west. Otherwise I'm going to need a bigger bag coming back next time."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy yellow with pillowy white head. Nose is spicy with strong Belgian yeast character, notes of lemon, cracker, clove and coriander all come through. Flavor is spicy and features plenty of Belgian pale characteristics. On point for style. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, pretty straightforward beer here. Not on the level of something like Duvel, but well balanced and flavorful nonetheless."

""

""
""
"O - excellent example of the style; refreshing and goes down easy. No complaints here, but there usually aren't any with New Glarus"
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a mostly smooth, slightly foamy mouthfeel that's not correct for the style (more carbonation for style), but fits with this beer well enough. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness on the palate and lips."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a lighter Belgian style ale. Good yeasty taste with some nice fruit and malt notes."
""
""
""
"O - Another great beer from New Glarus. I don't quite like it as much as Dancing man or the most recent thumbprint (Imperial Weizen), but it's very tasty none the less. Prost!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the closest thing to the real deal (as opposed to weaker pretenders, like New Belgium Abbey, or, egads, Blue Moon Abbey). This will hold a regular place in my fridge."

"Messy, too spicy and dry IMO. Instantly reminded me of smaller, home brewed version of Victory's Golden Monkey and that's never a good thing."
""
""
""
"O: A flavorful yet sessionable BPA with a yeast profile very close to that of a good hefeweizen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Man, I REALLY want NG to make a tripel!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a smooth BPA that isn't too complicated. Easy to drink, hits the yeasty notes with a small bit of honey sweetness and ginger bitterness in the background. Not the best BPA out there. It mainly could use a little bit more body and carbonation along with some more sweetness. Its a bit too one-dimensional with the dominant yeast here."
"Overall a nice refreshing beer. Not my favorite from New Glarus but it still is a decent beer. Glad to try another of their offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"Balanced, low-ABV, but crammed with flavor. A+"
""
"Mouthfeel is great, clean and crisp with a moderat carbonation."
""
""
"This pours a light amber color with a slight, white head. The aroma is mild with scents of yeast and banana. The texture is pretty full with a decent about of carbonation delivering a smooth, mellow banana taste. Very well made and a great co-release with Staghorn Oktoberfest."

"O - A very well done Belgian style pale ale. Is there any style Dan can't brew well?"

"Good stuff, will be drinking this all fall long, a lot of flavor for 5.3%abv, NG maybe you should brew a bad beer just so I know that you are not cheating! I kid of course!"

"O- A very good Belgian pale ale, Wish that it wasn't the last time I will probably be drinking this."
""

"Overall: Someone described this as a ""session Quad"" and I'd agree with that. They squeezed all those Belgian abbey flavour you know and love into this little beer. Really tasty stuff!"

"O: this is not the best version of this style I have sampled. However, NG has done very well. The essence of the style shines through and its extremely quaffable. Its damn good and you could have several."
"Overall this is an easy drinking version of the style that lacks a bit of the complexity some of the finer examples offer. Perhaps a fresher bottle would have more character."
"Overall: I thought this was an take on the style, but noting about it really draws me in or keeps my interest."
"A very enjoyable beer. Glad I picked up a few before this one was retired."
"Overall it is an average beer. Almost seems diluted - not much character"
"I can't think of a better beer to start with when first exploring the style. This is no Duvel, but it is a very balanced and drinkable beer that will leave one interested in seeking out other Belgian ales."
"Overall-- BPA's aren't a style I dink a ton of, but this is not one I'll plan on having again. It isn't terrible, but it is low on the spectrum of how I like the style."
"From the bottle, pours a clear orange gold with a thin white head. Aroma is malty, a bit fruity. The taste is lacking any real spice you might expect from a belgian, but does have a hint of bananas and cloves at first, followed quickly by a malty smoothness and finishes lightly bitter and sour. This beer definitely improved as it warmed. Decent while cold, I think this is a good beer, but not an excellent one."
"First chance to try and get a hold of the aroma yields a wonderful vibrant blend of aromas. Fresh grassy notes and a nice tart lemon smell start coming up right away. Very interesting and not what I expected at first, but very, very pleasant. Warming brings on almost a grape skin like note to it, just a touch of funk that blends in very well with the bright lemon that I am still picking up. Each sip now becomes more and more and exploratory effort into what can be done when you shed the constraints of a style and brew good beer, period. Smooth, subtle and building on the palate with each sip this lovely balance of light earthy hops, some notes of citrus, and light sour all blending as one. Nothing dominating here at all, just working together towards a common goal. It seems as if each sip is something more unique, more perplexing the one before. Prickly carbonation nips at the tongue, keeping the feel lively and fresh and allowing light flavors to penetrate every inch of the mouth."
"D- extremely drinkable. This beer is complex yet understated. However it is just a bit lacluster in the flavor from the amazing aroma. I could drink this all night if I didn't eBay to think about my beer. Delicious and quenching."
"overall, I dont mind this beer. Its another drinkable session beer from New Glarus. Nothing amazing or eye-opening, but a very drinkable beer that I would much rather reach for than any macro ever available."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a lighter but very solid Belgian style beer to drink for a long time."
"Pours a hazy light yellow-orange with a 2 inch white head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of Belgian yeast, spices (clove, ginger), banana, and some malt. Taste is of Belgian yeast, the aforementioned spices, banana flavors, and some wheat-like malts. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean due to a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good Belgian pale ale beer but not one of my favorite styles. I am still glad that I got to try this one from New Glarus."
"Mixed results here. I wonder how it will mutate further in the cellar as time goes on."
"This is a spicy, slightly sweet, mostly dry Belgian pale - a session beer as Belgians go. Reminds me a lot of the recent hefeweizens I had over the weekend for the smooth fruit candy character. There's touches of orange blossom and pale malt, but the yeast dominates here. I'd want a little more depth here, but it's a fine beer."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors for the most part are complex and work well together. The banana flavors and the spices compliment each other nicely. Felt like it could have poured a bit nicer and the aroma was a touch lacking."
"I'm extremely surprised this carries a B+ avg on here. It was one of the most disappointing craft beers I have ever had..."
"D: Not the one I would choose for the style, but it was ok."
"Poured into a pint glass. Hazy yellow with a good head that recedes quickly and leaves little lacing. Smell: banana and spice. Taste: more banana and spice against a sweet malt backbone, producing a flavor that reminds me a lot of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum, but in a good way. Medium mouthfeel. Crisp finish. A very drinkable and pleasant beer in a style I admittedly know nothing about. Goes great with pork chops."
"drinkability: forst beer from new glarus and this was not that great. an avg belgian pale. It's a intro to craft beer."
"Color is hazy yellow with good carbonation and a thick foamy head. Aroma of banana and yeast. Taste is creamy and fruity. Starting with a light to medium body that goes down smooth with a very creamy feel. Finish is a fruity yeast flavor with a nice banana taste and a faint bitterness. Smooth, but light in taste, for the style."
"Something to look forward to a comeback"
"D: Not my favorite style, but a solid beer. I wouldn't more than one or two of these in a sitting."
"D: Nice light flavors lead to easy drinkability. This is a tasty BPA at a decent price. Worth checking out."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color, with a small head that disapated. There isnt much of a smell at all. The taste is full of spices, and a strong organe flavor, very simialir to a belgian witbeir. Nice carnonation and easy to drink. Overall a good beer, but much like a belgian pale ale, but its still enjoyabe, I was expecting a differnt taste."
"Overall this is a solid beer from New Glarus. Give it a shot if you have the opportunity"
"D -- Becuase of its clean finish, the estery character in the flavor of this beer doesn't overpower the palate. This is a perfect summer-on-the-deck, lazy afternoon beer. I may have to reassess my rating after I study the style and finish the six pack. Other than color, NG may have nailed the style."
"This beer pours a cloudy golden orange color with a white frothy foam. The smell is strongly of Belgian yeast components a good majority of which is clove, orange zest and a touch of cinnamon. The cinnamon comes through on the taste buds as well there is almost a hefeweizen like taste to this beer and I'm surprised to find out that it was not. There is a lot of clove on the tongue and the wheat provides a bit of a smoother mouthfeel. This is a very pleasant beer for the spring and summer weather. I wish it wasn't so cold out right now I would have to go out and enjoy this beer outdoors. A very good beer overall."
"Poured into a pint glass a hazy dark golden straw color with a good amount of head. Bit of a citrus smell. A nice medium bodied beer with a good flavor including quite a bit of citrus. Nice smooth drinking beer, very good and easy to drink. I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer as I wasn't even sure of the style going in, but I really liked it and wouldn't mind having a few more."
"Pours a nice hazy golden-bread color with a nice white head and a good dose of lacing as it goes down. The nose brings forward some nice citrus with orange and lemons at the forefront along with a bit of grassy spice. Really nice. The taste is a bit of a fallback from the nose and the malt is accentuated a bit more for a bit of a bready domination. Good yeasty notes in the background though. Light, crisp feel. Really nice and drinkable and something I miss being able to grab packs of."
"Reviewed on 2/4/2010. Bottle thanks to SkyView. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a thick white head and lively carbonation. Aroma of Belgian yeast, clove, melon rind. Flavor of light fruits, sweet honey melon, Belgian yeast, and tons of spices. Smooth drinking, nice Belgian ale. Very similar to Crackd Wheat actually, with the sweet fruity notes combined with the clove and Belgian spices. Pleasant and tasty."
"D - Not bad, but I probably wouldn't drink it often."
"Lighter medium body, pretty lively on the tongue, slightly dry. Drinks smooth with refreshing flavor, a pretty solid Belgian pale ale."
"Drinkability is good. I really enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It's definitely one of New Glarus' better standard offerings. Nothing really stands out, but it's well crafted. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"Overall it's a solid beer and a good Belgian pale for one made in the US."
"A nice juicy pale maltiness with a salivating amount of spiciness and esters. Full on cloves followed by a slight bitterness in the finish. Sour apple and banana taffy present a lovely duet in the midsip with a semi sweet finish which is medium bodied. Pinpoint carbonation give this beer a creamy texture and a nice spritziness. I could drink this all night. I need more though."
"drinkability: smooth, delicate, fancy. pour that champagne in to the dog dish and give this a shot instead. toe to toe could kick the hell outta any french champagne at twice the price."
"Mouthfeel isn't bad, a little flat. Drinkable, but not exceptional beer."
"D: Having recently had RR Redemption, this one just doesn't compare. Not bad though... solid in every aspect of the word. Flavor just comes across as a little too sweet and unbalanced with spices that don't quite work together. Still, I'd reach for this one again."
"Another entry in the pre-interview extravaganza. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises clove, pepper, wheat, lemon zest, and coriander. The taste launches on a heavy banana and clove jag, coming down later with some pepper and cardamom. It may be pretty simplistic, but it is definitely effective. The body is a heavy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a prickly fluid feel. Overall, a very nice BPA, easily drinkable and readily enjoyable."
"I first had this beer a year before I really got into beer and I wish I had followed up on it then. This is comfort food in a bottle."
"A pretty good little beer here... This would have been better with a meal as I'm not sure I could drink these all night..."
"Drinkability: Doesn't seem like something I would pick up too often but has a few qualities that are appealing."
"Pours a bright golden yellow, white head good lacing.  Smell some banana, yeast.  Tastes are some yeast, light banana a hint of apple at the finish.  Good amount of carb. The drinkability is out of this world, what a great beer especially for a regular in their lineup. New Glarus impresses me every time."
"D: modestly high"
"Stone soup pours a hazy light gold with a nice foamy head that lingers in a fine layer. The aroma is fruity, with tons of esters and phenolic character. The beer is light, dry malt with more tart, yeasty character, and a dry, phenolic finish. There are tons of flavors going on in this beer, almost too much for its strength, but interesting overall."
"Thanks, ThomasHardy, for the opportunity"
"D: High. An interesting hybrid of ingredients to create a classic style, it's not too busy. It will turn off those who abhor banana beers, but overall it adheres to style, and is thought-provoking without being overly clever."
"Another solid, quality beer from New Glarus."
"Drinks well, but I have to give a lower score here because it's just not real close to the style. I seriously wonder if I got a bottle of one of their hefe's that got mislabled. Still a drinkable and flavorful beer."
"Thanks to UGABeerguy for sharing this bottle. Pours a very pale golden with a small head. Smells typically of Belgian yeast with some coriander and some late sweetness. Interesting flavors. Banana, wheat, coriander, and light spiciness. Not too sweet, as many American versions of this beer are. Crisp and spicy in the mouth. I enjoyed this- not mind-altering, but a bit different and quite enjoyable."
"True to style, but not somthing I could drink more of. Its seems out of place alone with no food. Not my kind of beer."
"D: Very drinkable yet not as complex or fulfilling as what I was expecting based on the smell. A second review without the yeast being poured into the glass seems to be in order."
"This is an interesting beer but it just doesn't really resonate with me. The bubblegum and banana flavors are not my favorite. A decent take on a BPA but not one of my favorites."
"D: This is the type of Belgium pale ale that I could session(and have), great flavors and a very light bodied, easy drinking ale."
"D - I had this with a grilled cheese and it was pretty damn tasty. I could see having more then one or two without a problem."
"Cheers!"
"Another incredibly drinkable beer by New Glarus, and a testament to their ability to brew any style with complexity and finesse."
"D: Nice and easy drinking, though lacking a bit on the flavor. I wanted the flavors to be just a little bigger to match what I smelled. Not a let down, but not the beer I expected."
"The mouthfeel was very carbonated and sharp, once again champagne-like. The carbonation tingle remained long after the beer was gone. If you like an assault of carbonation and a gang bang of spicy flavor... give it a try."
"A: Excessive head on an easy pour, quickly dropped to a centimeter of bumpy foam leaving no lacing or spotting, very light straw in color - 3.00, S: First whiff provides a nice crisp spiciness to the nose, slightly chalky and quite peppery, also some of table crackers aromas, faint fruitiness in the background - possibly pear - 4.25, T: Mild hop bite, a little astringent, I picked up the tell tale signs of candied sugars, there's a light fruity sweetness - possibly pear, quite biscuity and with a medicinal backdrop - 3.50, M: Gentle carbonation bite, medium mouth feel - 3.50, D: A good brew all around and a solid representation of the style - 3.50"
"D: I'm not in love with this one, but it's pretty tasty."
"Pours translucent, little to no lacing and head. Fills the glass with aromas of cornflakes and unripened green bananas, aged hops, and wheat cracker - has kind of a wit thing going on, some faint, and I mean faint, spice in the background. Mouthfeel was somewhat effervescent but that was the only thing average about the beer. As far as Belgian Pale Ales go, this sits at the bottom in my book."
"Another nice offering from New Glarus."
"d- interesting. not ng's best work, but dan can't hit it out of the park every time. worth trying, but i wouldn't say worth a 6 pack, given ng's alternative options."
"D: Drinks very easily."
"D- Pretty easy beer to drink. The pepper tastes that come with this beer change the drinkability, but opens up some opportunities for food pairings."
"D- This is a decent-above average brew-but R&D is worlds better than this. The nose is good-but the pale malt comes through a littl to much in the flavor for me which makes this a little bit more run of the mill than most brews I have had of the style."
"Drinkability -- Easily my favorite New Glarus thus far. Great balance and Belgian pale ale flavors. Coupled with the exceptional drinkability of New Glarus beers: amazing."
"Poured into a water glass...had a rich caramel color, with light carbonation and a small fluffy white head. Aroma was predominately malt, with caramel and honey overtones. Taste was slightly chewy, lightly sweet, with cane sugar and bananna followed by vanilla and a touch of citrus."
"D - Very nice and refreshing, and evidently well-crafted."
"While the stone soup may appear unimpressive I can assure you it is anything but. The more distinguished palates can pick up traces of vanilla and subtle hints of citrus amongst it's sweet Ginger overtones. It drinks smooth and goes down easy (that's what she said)."
"Nice solid everyday drinking beer."
"Notes: Eh. The after taste makes it not for me. For others though, I think it has good drinkability and is a good representation of the style."
"Toasted grains and some yeasty twang up front. Smooth, soft wheat malts follow, accented by notes of tropical fruit and melon. Mildly peppery, spicy hops follow as the malt gets breadier. Cantaloupe and fruity dough in the finish, with lingering peppery hop bitterness. Medium-bodied with a protein-rich feel. Not bad. Very wheaty. I wouldn't mind a bit more of a hop presence though."
"F: Some bitterness with orange peel, grassy and citrus hops, spicy and floral hop flavors lingering, pale hop flavors, most mild on the initial taste but seem to get a little astringent on the finish, but ever so slightly. More lingering Belgian sweet malts, but dries a bit as well. A nice tasty Belgian pale I have to say, I would have liked a little more of the Belgian malt flavor, and a little more hoppy flavor, but that's my opinion, and it is a nice tasty beer."
"Exceptional drinkability. Crisp and refreshing. A very good Belgian Pale Ale for the coming summer months. Cheers!"
"D - quality beer, almost saison-like, second beer from NG and another that I enjoyed greatly"
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with above average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it was an interesting beer with a mix of some good flavors. I wouldn't say that it was outstanding in any of the flavors though."
"D: A great summer beer. Everything about this beer makes it very drinkable."
"D-great drinkability even though not favorite style, nor my favorite New Glarus beer"
"Overall- Something like a cross between a Belgian blond and a German hefeweizen. Quite tasty and would be great with food! This is a fun brew and the fact that they use Wisconsin malt really puts it over the top for me! I could see this being delightful in cold or hot weather, and will definitely be stocking up on it next time I am in Wisconsin!"
"Smooth up front, a bit metallic to note, well carbonated, and the body is firm and medium. Has a full robust malt flavor in the middle, with a slightly dry finish, no bitterness as the use of hops here are minimal. Good sweetness as well, the flavor lingers and subdues your taste buds. It's a very easy drinker, not overly complex, a very sessionable beer, glad I found some more."
"Smooth taste, nothing really too bold or cutting edge. Makes it a safe beer for people to try or get into this style or craft beer with. Got some nice lemon esters that play a nice role in the nose and taste. Not really bitter, which I personally like, but there is a sharp bite to the hops. Good relaxing beer, but almost to full of a body to be enjoyed on a hot day."
"The taste is intriguing and unexpected, mainly it its bone-dryness. The brew has Belgian tripel flavors but the crispness and tartness is almost austere. Mouthfeel is light and sharp. The sourness in the finish is what takes this beer's taste, mouthfeel and drinkability down a peg, not fulfilling the promise of the nose. Probably one of my least favorite New Glarus offerings, could use some tweaking."
"D: This is a ok beer. I've tried to like Belgian pale ale but can get into them. Still a big fan of New Glarus!"
"D - Could be a good summer beer."
"There is something missing with this BPA. Its good, but I can't figure out what it's missing, maybe too much clove and spice and not enough sweet malt?"
"d - Thought this was a decent pale ale. Nice yeast and banana taste and very easy to drink. I'd try it again."
"This is one of my favorite beers from new glarus, it has a crisp taste with a light fruit note at the end. It is good for a cold winter drinking beer or a hot summer night. I have drank this beer served from room temp to ice cold and i have not found a bad time to have it. This brewing company only sells in wisconsin but it is well worth the drive to get it."
"I wasn't extremely impressed with Stone Soup. It was similar to other New Glarus beers I've had, but I didn't think it was as good as others. It pours a nice shade of gold. I thought the taste was alright, somewhat similar to a hefeweizen. I would recommend this beer, but I think New Glarus has some better brews to offer."
"Mouthfeel is good with some lively carbonation and a fairly light body. Easy to drink beer. Pleasant but not a lot a character."
"Pours a pale yellow and very cloudy. Head dissipates very quickly. It looks like champagne in the glass lots of big bubbles that explode at the surface. It smells like a clovey hefeweizen. Lemons begin the taste and then it finishes spicey. The is a whole lot of carbonation going on bouncing all over my tongue. This is my least favorite of the New Glarus beers I got to try thanks to Nick the Intern and his Father-In-law."
"D: I'd believe this was an actual Belgium-made Belgian Pale Ale, which is saying something. Obviously a lot of care and craft went into the production of the beer, although I don't think it's really an amazing stand-out example of the style. Still, I could drink quite a bit of this if I were in the place to do so."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow hue with a one finger white head that slowly falls to a thin layer of foam. Some minor stick here and there on the glass, overall a typical looking Belgian. Aroma consists of clove, spice, yeast, and banana...again, typical Belgian. Taste begins with the faint banana bread and some citrus. Midway a metallic ting emerges with pear and white grapes. Aftertaste is bready and grainy with a sugary sweetness that lingers. Pillowy soft feel with steady carbonation and a light to medium body. Just another easy drinking, full flavored ale from New Glarus. I'm not a fan of the style, but I could easily put a few of these down on a warm summer day."
"A slow pour from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass offers a nice head that sticks around for a bit. There's a little bit of lacing. It's a nice cloudy golden yellow color. This has a strong wheat smell. A typical Belgian that does nothing in that aspect to stick out from the crowd. The taste is about the same. There's a bit of bitterness with the grain taste, but it leads into a nice light aftertaste. This whole beer is light on the tongue which increases the drinkability. Fans of the style will probably drink a lot of these."
"The flavors mix together well and make this a very easy drinking beer. Would be a great one to open on a hot, summer day."
"Had a bottle of this at my brother's house in WI. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a very hazy light gold. Nice off-white head on top. Retained well, left some nice lace on the side. Very crisp body which is par for the style. I'm not the biggest fan of that feel. A little harsh. Big yeast scent mixed with some pineapple. Flavors of sour yeast, citrus, and a mild bready flavor on the finish. This was not as sharp as I expected. It was drinkable and tasty. Glad I had the opportunity."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a small white head. The smell is sweet with a large fruity component. Very nice. The flavor is heavy on the fruit and malty sweetness with bananas and cloves being apparent. There is also a Belgian yeast character. Nothing necessarily stands out in this beer but everything meshes together nicely. A very drinkable beer that I would love to try again when the weather warms up."
"Notes: I'm pretty unfamiliar with Belgian Pale Ales, but this seems remarkably similar to a hefeweizen to me. Not quite as bready, not quite as creamy, and a tad more fruity, but still has the major qualities of a good hefe. This is certainly not a complaint, and mostly just shows my ignorance of Belgian ""singles"". Regardless of all this, it's another winner from New Glarus!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer has a massive three finger white head and beneath it lies a light golden-straw color brew with a slight hazing and very active carbonation. Phenols are very apparent, sweet clove and banana. Taste has similar qualities but they seem to develop more. There are the initial phenols but they seem more reserved but the banana stays strong and at the end there is a sweet, slightly acidic light fruit note that is a mixture of pear, white grape and peaches. The mouthfeel is a light medium body with a velvety but active carbonation and has a dry finish. Overall a drinkable beer, another good one by NG."
"Fairly drinkable and rather pleasant. Another nice brew from New Glarus."
"Drinkability: this beer has some nice spiciness to it. Easy to quaff this one but it won't blow you away."
"Made the trip to New Glarus last weekend so I have a boat load New Glarus beer to review. The first is Stone Soup. This beer poured a cloudy amber with a small head that faded very fast. Also showed decent lacing. The smell was of spice and yeast. Taste was of light citrus flavors, spice and hints of yeast. Also hints of sour dough bread. Mouthfeel was good, as was the drinkability. Overall I found this beer to be very nice. Showed some fairly complex flavor notes. Wish i had bought more, and wish I didn't have to go to Wisconsin to get it."
"Drinkability is very good as the beer goes down incredibly easily with no harsh flavors or astringency."
"Served from 12 oz. bottle; Pours an opaque medium copper/golden with a moderate head that subsides leaving very little by way of foam and light/moderate lacing. Excellent aroma with yeasty, bubblegum characteristics. Yeast and bubblegum notes also come to the fore in the taste, which also shows off malty, banana aspects. Nice tight carbonation lends a good mouthfeel. Overall, a nicely drinkable beer, and a good representative of the style. Another winner from New Glarus."
"Part of a NG sampler twelver my friend Josh brought back from Wisconsin."
"Drinkability: This one started out weak, got a little stronger, but then ended weak as I got more in to it. It's not a bad beer - it's a New Glarus, of course, and all things NG are pretty fantastic. But some are less fantastic than others, and this isn't in the pantheon of great NG. At 5.3%, it's surely drinkable, but there are others I'd rather drink at this level."
"Drinkability: i think this is a very well done beer. not sure about how it fits the style, as it has some characteristics of a hefeweizen, but very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D - I think this is one of those beers I could sit down and drink all night. A fantastic beer that finishes well and doesn't get you hammered with a high ABV. There is a reason I love New Glarus...I haven't had a bad beer from them yet. take a look at all their beer reviews and you won't see one below a B-. Highly recommended."
"D - Very good, could pleasantly drink these all day."
"The taste is very neutral and simple but enjoyable and allows you drink a lot. Right off the bat you taste a little yeast, the middle is light, but then you have some sweet hops. This is a very drinkable beer."
"D - Nicely done beer. A good pale that smells, tastes, and feels great. An easy one to put back, I could knock a few of these around pretty easily."
"Would I buy more of it? - Maybe. Not totally sold on it...plus I'd have to go to Wisconsin to get more and I think I'd rather buy some of New Glarus' other beers instead."
"Though New Glarus takes a valiant and very drinkable attempt at this style, for me at least, it is becoming increasingly evident that the American brewers haven't harnessed the secret of Belgain ales as of yet."
"There just didn't seem to be a lot going on with this beer. It seemed almost bland and watery. It definitely went down fast, but there are better New Glarus offerings."
"This is pretty good, but I was expecting a bit more depth from a Belgian Pale."
"Light yellow in color with a bunch of carbonation bubbles and a nice head that receded slowly and left some lacing. Smell is highly concentrated mashed bananas with some light spices rounding it out. Taste is fairly light malts with small background hints of clove. Not really much in the way of spices. Medium to light mouthfeel with subdued carbonation on the tongue. Not bad, but not anything noteworthy overall."
"I'm not sure whether to think of this as an American, German, or Belgian beer, but any way you classify it, it's only fair in appearance. The head is white and on the small and fizzy side, though the body is a pleasant, dandelion sunny yellow with a slight haze. Nose is like a lovely mix of Hefeweizen and tripel, full of banana and clove as well as bright citrus (orange sherbet) and wild herbs (oregano and juniper). Tangy, spicy, and bittersweet, bubblegummy and full of banana, clove, rye bread, and orange. Delicate notes of champagne and lemon drops contribute to an overall fruity yet dry and spicy flavor, perfectly textured with round, rolling carbonation and a dry, citric finish. I have no idea how strong this beer is, but it is very drinkable - it brings that distinctive New Glarus Hefeweizen-like yeast to a Belgian style, with delicious results."
"D: A great drinkable Belgiany beer."
"I know this isnt everyone's favorite offering from New Glarus but I love it and it is my favorite one in their lineup."
"I'm steadily working my way through the NG lineup so here's another one in the books. The beer pours a cloudy golden yellow. The head is enormus and bright white. After it settles no lace is left behind. The aroma is very fruity. Clove and banana are right up front. Yeast and breadiness notes are present as well. The flavor is sweet and dry. Banana and spice are first on the list followed by lemon and a cracker like tone. The dry fininsh is rather mouth puckering. Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Overall not bad. I might pass on this one later on."
"Very tasty take on a Belgian single pale, very good drinkability."
"A crisp, refreshing beer. The carbonation really tickles the taste buds. Juicy in the mouth and low ABV, makes this a great drinkable beer."
"Pours a huge foamy white 3 finger head. The lace dissipates fairly quickly. Has a cloudy gold color. Smells of yeast, malt, fruit, and cloves. The aroma is not very strong compared to other Belgian Pale Ales. Taste is the same as the aroma. Banana is the strongest fruit flavor. This beer is slightly sweet, dry, with high carbonation, and somewhat thin. Good drinkability. Overall a decent beer."
"D- It's a great summer beer, but for me personally it is a bit too light."
"(D)- Damn crisp and refreshing! A great belgian style that surprised me in everyway. Good fruits and layering in complexity."
"Pours a lightly hazed yellowish gold, thin white head forms, settles to a thin ring, no lacing on the glass, looks okay. Smell is okay, apricot, some floral, biscuits, honey and caramel, peaches, creamed corn, banana, touch of spice, kind of interesting. Taste is similar, alcohol comes through, light banana, spice, very fruity, apricots and peach, wheat, peppery bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, quite dry in the finish. Alright, but doesn't do much for me."
"Pours a fairly clear gold. Nose is yeasty fruity goodness. Flavor is very nice. Nice balance. Yeast tones. Fruit edges. Noticed spices. Slightly thicker liquid body. Even a mediocre Belgian Ale used to be an accomplishment for an American brewer. Nowadays, I think that the bar has been raised and people are able to do some very nice interpretations. Very easy to drink. Very."
"weird..."
"A good beer - just not sure this adds up to anything that meets the advertised style. I could have easily confused this for a hefe - or perhaps even a tripel on an off day."
"3.5-4 it's drinkable and generally inoffensive, though lacking in character."
"Stone Soup is not one of New Glarus's most outstanding offerings. It needs more flavor, more depth and more complexity... all of which would be provided by more barley and more Belgian yeastiness. Dan Carey is a damn good brewer, but there's some room for improvement here."
"Drank really easy for the style, an approachable, yet fairly complex take on the style that is session worthy, when many others are just too damn potent. Yet another winner from New Glarus!"
"I went into this one with high hopes, but unfortunately really can't say I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability is great as well. Easy drinking and very smooth."
"D. A really good Belgian ale, great hop flavor, not too sweet. Nice hop bitterness. I will definatly have this ale again."
"D: This is very easy to drink. I might actually have two per session (if I had more than just one). Major congratulations out to New Glarus on this one. This is my favorite of the line so far. So far, that is. I still have three to sample."
"This beer poured with a 1 inch head and some cloudiness. Also some bubbles from the bottom of the glass. At first, the nose was lots of tart apple and/or pears. After the drink sat for a bit the nose became mostly bananas and vanilla. Taste is good with apples and tart citrus. The big discount to this beer is the lack of carbonation. I feel this beer should have some zing and carbonated bite. Then I would give it much higher marks. Still enjoyable and fresh."
"D - Interesting brew. Again, I think this is more of a hefeweizen than a BPA but it is refreshing none-the-less. Pretty decent beer but I liked the Fat Squirrel better."
"HV"
"D- Absolutley, very smooth, and I am generally not a big fan of belgian ales"
"This is a very average belgian pale ale. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"D: Relatively light. A good summer beer. Easy to drink, but this beer lacks a good reason to drink it as there are far better on the market. There is nothing characteristic in flavor or aroma. Maybe it would pair better with a light meal."
"Overall, this is an OK beer. Not one of NG's finest, but still decent. Too much carbonation for me. I could drink more, but I would choose to switch it up instead."
"Overall, this is a good beer. I have been excite to drink some New Glarus, as it's available nowhere outside of Wisconsin...I picked up a few other styles while I was up there, and am looking forward to trying them. Mostly, it's a good beer...drinkable, but nothing over the top or super exciting here."
"pours a golden yellow color like that of a pils color although unlike a pils this one is hazy with a nice fluffy cloud like head that does dissipate to a very nice looking fresh ring til the end the smell is typical belgium it has the clove the spice the yeast and the fruit..you know this ale will be good...yup its great it hits you with some nice yeast and clove with some apples and melons and cinnamon tastes nothing overpowering just very tasty..the mouth feel is smooth and velvety, creamy and delicious...if you like belgiums you'll love this one cause its so easy drinking..NG always puts out great brew styles in their categories they never disappoint... recommended for sure"
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow-orange color. The head is a solid half inch of foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is bubblegum, hints of anise, and light notes of other spices. The taste is of Belgian malt, bubblegum, anise, and spices. There is a lot of complexity here in both the taste and aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very nice Brabant stlye ale. I would certainly drink this again."
"I like this beer, but do not love it. Meh, you can only be so happy."
"Pours a cloudy, golden/yellow color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong yeast, sweet malt, and slight hops. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast cleanliness, hops, banana, clove, and sweet malt. Overall, a good blend, smooth, and slightly watery in body."
"Pretty good stuff, but I would take most all of their other beers over it. The taste just seems kind of funky to me. Not a bad offering though."
"German hops, Belgian yeast and English Malt combine to form a single beer with optimal traits from Europe's best ingredients. Although some might classify this as a ""summer beer," I think its versatile qualities make it a refreshing brew for any season or occasion. Highly underrated based on the reviews I have read."
"The cloudy golden yellow liquid in my tulip has an effervescent quality to it, some nice bubble action going on here. An appealing skim of head sticking around for the whole time is another positive. Hefe, hay and horse-shit on the nose...wait... NO on the horse-shit, I got carried away with the H's. But there is some yeast aroma, which is to be expected. Dominant wheat in the taste, some Euro hops and a nice stable malt foundation. Super clean finish, but so clean could be a little dry. I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of wheat beers but New Glarus is changing that for me. They make some damned fine wheat products, as this is a quite drinkable beer."
"Drinkability? It's ok as I'll have no problem finishing the 12oz bottle but it isn't something I'd turn to every day if it was available locally as it's kind of muted when it comes to taste."
"This was decent, but is lacking the little something extra. New Glarus makes some great brews, but this one was just average for me."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack Goblet. Stone Soups pours a super hazy, soft golden with a 2 inch white head that slowly melts into just just a bit of a lilly pad, sitting in the middle of the glass. A sharp carbonation makes sure that the lily pad never goes away. Only a subtle lacing occurs. The aroma is odd. Sharp notes of clove, bubblegum, and lemon zest come through. The nose is more reminiscent of a witbier then a Belgian pale ale. No hops are present in the nose. The flavor is much the same with clove, ginger, a bit of pepper, and lemon zest. As it warms sweet Belgian candy sugar comes through along with a lemon flare that cuts the sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharp carbonation. This is a good beer, easily drinkable, but just a bit odd for a Belgian pale ale."
"D-Probably one of my favorite offerings so far from New Glarus...doesn't hurt that I like the style. It's highly drinkable, refreshing, and plain good."
"Pours a golden straw with light, voluminous head--slow to dissolve. Carbonation evident. As noted on the bottle, you get ginger and cloves on the nose, but also with a grassy yeastiness, bitter orange peel, and alcohol. There is a hint of the macro sweetness there...oh dear... You can definitely taste the ginger, a tad of the bitter orange peel, and then it goes sweet, caramel and malts. The macro element was pushed at times, as was the bitterness, in my opinion. Nicely balanced mouthfeel, perhaps a tad too much carbonation for my taste. All in all, a decent beer. More of an ""interesting"" than a ""solid"" choice, though."
"Easy to drink, but a bit on the sweet side, a lighter belgian pale."
"Highly drinkable, the spice notes are very smooth."
"D= A sessionable Belgian ale if there ever was one. I really liked this one a lot and will seek out more once my supply is gone. It paired exceptionally well with the cheese fondue at the Glarner Stube."
"drinkability is decent. the brew is non-descript. there are no real defining qualities to call its own. a sub par abbey ale."
"Overall an ok Belgian style ale, but compared to what I am used to, nothing special. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but not a standout either."
"Huh....Or as they say these days, Meh."
"D: Low ABV is good, I can see putting a couple of these back to back. Would be a good beer with some sweet/hot BBQ."
"Stone Soup is nice and hazy gold in color, and pours with lots of bubbles and a light, foamy head. It smells sweet, bubblegum aromas. The smell is also lightly spicy, with hints of clove. It tastes sweet and fruity, a little bit tart, with flavors of green apple. It's strong at first, but soon mellows on the palate, and ultimately is ultimately a crisp, refreshing brew."
"The color is a hazey banana skin sunshine color.One finge head after the pour that recedes to a ring of foam around the inside of my glass. Just a little bubbling. A little white pepper, banana and cracked wheat aroma. Very yeasty smell overall. Taste starts with dry cracked wheat and pilsnery. This moves to some fruity yeast flavors. That finishes with some earthy hops and grass, and some gypsum dry malts. The palate is crispy dry, but yeasty and somewhat fruity. Good, flavorful, Belgian style session ale."
"Drinkability - A bit in the overpowering ""banana estery"" family for me. Nice to see a good Belgian offering, but the balance was a bit off. Not able to get New Glarus in SC, so I'm very much a newbie in reviewing their offerings."
"D: A very nice warm weather/cook out beer."
"Overall, good but with a better mouthfeel it could be great."
"Taste and mouth are both really nice, nothing spectacular, but its a damn good beer, eminently drinkable and refreshing."
"D: This is an awesome beer I wish I had more of. More importantly, I wish this is what the Smutty Star Island Single was :-("
"Can't see drinking this one on its own, it is most certainly begging to be paired with a lunch though."
"Picked up one of these in a mixed six pack. Another nice beer from New Glarus. Seems kind of similar to some of their other beers, maybe they use the same yeast on a lot of their products. Worth a try."
"This is lawn mower beer in every sense. While its not my favorite NG brew, I can appreciate the style and enjoy one every now and then."
"I was a little apprehensive about Stone Soup when I saw its overall score here. I'm pleased to report that it's better than it's scored. It's not exactly on par with some of the world's finest Belgian Pale Ales, but it's a nice take on the style. There's far worse choices out there. I'd recommend picking up a few bottles if the opportunity presents itself."
"Drinkability: good, enough of a flavor to keep u interested but not so much that it would keep you from going back for another"
"D - You could drink as many as you'd like, but there are plenty of better options than this one."
"Overall: Very easy to drink, good flavors, not too bold. A bit too tingly on the tongue but still a great beer!"
"There is so much that is right about this beer, but unfortunately the most important element (taste) is lacking. One of the rare ""disappointments"" to come from New Glarus. Far from a drain pour, but I won't be getting this again the next time I come through WI."
"D= Pretty good but I dunno if I'll be drinking much more of it. The wintergreen taste is really weird."
"Light end of medium bodied, well-carbonated-tight bubbles. Incredibly drinkable-an overall strength of New Glarus year-round offerings."
"Drinkable, but the high carbonation can get filling. I rarely expect a Belgian Ale to be a session beer. Pair this with some great cheese and maybe dried apricots. Quality beer from New Glarus."
"Drinkable but nothing about it made me want to have another. Overall a pretty tame offering."
"Pours cloudy peachy yellow with big white head which dissapeared faitly quickly. Smell - very yeasty, some fruit flavours - pears, bananas, some grapes, just a hint of hops. Taste - yeasty, bready, sweet and fruity, finishes sweet. Mouthfeel - crisp, flavourful, very light. Drinkable to certain extent. Good brew!"
"Not a sipper, this is a six pack beer. No maybe a case. But be warned this is filling, the carbonation packs a one two punch."
"This beer was a bit lighter than I thought it would be for an Belgium Abbey beer. Smell had a hint of being nutty or fruity. Smooth taste, finishes with a small hint of banana after taste, but not overpowering. No hoppy flavor whatsoever. A good beer, but I have had better Abbey's."
"Overall a good lawnmower beer but not something i would trade for again. Glad to try it though."
"Similar to Spotted Cow, but with a belgian twist. Worth checking out, but I think Dan could of done a little better."
"A very decent brew and I think my new favorite belgian pale ale. Appearance is a bit above average, yellow and orange colors swirl around each other. Abit of head and a bit lacing. Smell and taste are very similar, nice belgian candy up front with the zesty, fruity yeast that I have come to love. Mouthfeel is a bit weak but some decent carbonation. Drinkability is fantastic."
"Hazy, pale orange with gold edges, large white head that fellow slowly, nice cap ensues, light lacing. Aroma is yeaty, notes of light fruit and citrus, a bit floral and grassy. Flavor is lightly sweet at first, spicy, become bitter and grassy in the middle and finishes dry and yeasty. There's a decent hop bitterness in the middle but it's of the noble type. Crisp, easy drinking. I thought this beer was OK, but nowhere near the best I've had from NG."
"drinkability: good"
"Overall: Great mouthfeel, small bubbles of carbonation tickle the tongue with a medium body. The drinkability was pretty high, I could easily do a few of these. Very good overall."
"No hype here, just a good beer. I will drink this as long as I am able to find it. This is a fantastic (local to me) beer that I can keep in my refrigerator when I'm not looking for a Imperial Stout or IIPA. A solid beer. Cheers!"
"D- Goes down real easy. I really want another and another. Reasonable abv, pleasant and unobtrusive, subtle flavors really make this easy and pleasurable to drink. Great beer."
"Thanks to Taturbo for the brew."
"In the end not really for me but I know that many people really like a strong clove/citrus flavor in their hefe's. I was just really hoping tha the abbey side of this beer would have dulled that down a bit."
"Excellent beer in a kind of mixed Belgian/Hefeweizen style; I can imagine this being a huge hit on the back porch next to the grill in the spring. Winner!"
"Drinkability- This is a sorta odd duck. Abbey Ale? Hef? Its stuck somewhere between I suppose (leaning more Hef) but the bitter kick toward the end kind of changes everything. Its good and interesting but not my favorite brew by New Glarus (that's not even close to a insult considering everything is damned well done!)."
"A very refreshing beer, worth a try."
"I tried this a year ago and just now. It's not as spicy and big as I recall. Nice banana and clove action, great mouth feel; nice and creamy. Not the best I've ever had but highly drinkable nonetheless. A nice effort for a domestic brew... hard to pull off and I'm Belgian-spolied."
"M/D - Seems a bit overcarbonated and slightly too sweet for my taste. But overall not a bad brew at all."
"12 Oz Bottle via footy. Banana ester aroma, simple and straight, with nips of candied licorice and pale honey. Pours a clouded opalescent straw color, with a film of micro white head. Flavor is a consistent phenol and ester firework show, bold with more banana, light sugars, and perky with faint peppers. The yeast quality really seems like a German ale to me, but I know this was shooting for ""single"" style. Chewy sap dripping hops balance out nicely on the back end. Well attenuated and leaving nothing but lemon drops and herbal leaf on the tongue. The smack carries some more robust biscuit, wheat granules, and drops of candied raspberries. Wonderfully quaffable, nuanced and clean, but not exactly presenting the flavors I was looking for in the style. Although, further down the glass some of the more robust yeast products fade into the background and a nice balance forms between the gentle body and delicious German hop flavor. There are bits of DMS finding a home on the roof of my mouth. Kind of a ""meh."""
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" white head over the cloudy golden amber brew. Head dwindles slowly, with ample white frothy lace. Aroma is lightly spicy and clovey, reminds me of a white beer. Taste follows the nose. Mouthfeel tingly over the tongue, with a crisp close, and drinkability is good. A pleasing thirst quencher."
"Pours a bright, almost clear golden yellow with a puffy white head that dissipates slowly leaving a little bit of lacing. Smell is pretty standard for a belgian pale with belgian yeast and bananas and only a hint of spices. The taste follows the aroma with a subdued yeast flavor and a bit more spices. The mouthfeel is fairly light but very smooth with strong carbonation. This isn't the biggest or most unique example of the style but it's extremely drinkable, especially as a summer staple."
"Drinkability: It's alright for being a fairly mild Belgian ale."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little one-finger foamy white head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is slightly sweet, malty, yeasty, fruity/flowery, with a dash of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty/yeasty, very nice touch of fruits/flowers, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty Belgian Pale Ale, thanks for the extra Eric."
"A medium body is gassed with a frantic carbonation, which ultimately befits the scraping dry theme of the beer (and after several months of sitting, it seems more cohesive now). It's built as a drinker, and it succeeds. Tack that onto an authentic Belgian persona, and the result is something fairly unique Stateside. It's no mindblower, but it's more than agreeable in every possible way."
"Taste is a bit subdued compared to the smell, and I'm sorry to say that was a little bit offputting for the first sip. Aside from that, you basically have a solid and complex BPA--loaded with wheatmalt spice, light citrus nodes, and a wonderful yeasty twang--only without the alcohol burn of a bigger beer."
"Mouthfeel has a solid creaminess to it with good steady carbonation. Goes down smooth, making this an easy to drink brew. Overall it's pretty tasty, but it didn't blow me away. A solid offering from New Glarus as usual."
"Quite a nice beer we've got here. Fairly typical of good Belgian Pales. Pilsner malts create a base for a hazy strong-straw color, lots of airy carbonation and a froathy head that retained well. Aromas came across very Hefeweizen-like with the fruity esters (bananna, clove, and bubblegum), but with a heavier peppery quality and noticable alcohols. Flavors proved to be bolder with lots of candied sweetness, that replaces any heavy maltiness, with an increasing ester / phenolic flavors late. Pineapples, mangos, and appricots become more prevailant as the beer warms; but so do those phenolic characters. Comes across a bit soapy and a bit hoppy late (can't decide if it's more of a help or a hinderant) The finish bring some sweetness and dryness, leaving the mouth a bit tacky. Still alcoholic and phenolic in the aftertaste. Perhaps as good as American versions of the style get, but gets lost in the mix of good Belgian Pales overall. Thanks Clvand0."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a one finger white head that quickly dissipates to a thin cap. A trend I have noticed with New Glarus brews is the head retention. Not that impressive. I get the smell of cloves and ginger just like the bottle states. The taste is the same, spicey and peppery. It is light body and finishes crisp and clean. Very enjoyable to consume. If I had to compare this to another beer it would be a milder Cynic Ale by Surly. Being less intense it certainly is easier to enjoy."
"This is good on many levels, but if you're expecting it to compare to Belgians of the same style, you might come away disappointed. It does have the wild, farmhouse-y feel to it, and that raw, super-homebrew vibe some New Glarus stuff has. It's enjoyable, no doubt, but just a little below expectations."
"Mouthfeel is yeasty, citrusy, and light bodied."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy golden color with a very light, white head. Aroma of apricot and banana. Nice mouthfeel. Flavor is consistant with many Belgians. Flavor is also apricot-like with a nice yeast finish to it. Not really what I expected, yet a tasty offering from New Glarus."
"Pours a very hazy golden straw color. Big head that immediatly dies. Very lively carbonation. Smells of simple fruit, malt and a little spice. Tastes of fruit, maybe a little clove, some malt, a little citrus and a tiny bit of hops. Feels medium in the mouth with good carbonation. Very highly drinkable."
"D: Not overly enticing, but certainly drinkable."
"D: The beer is an easy drink, lacking the strong alcohol and bigger flavors of a tripel without giving up all flavor."
"overall this was a good beer, but nothing that I will probably buy again"
"The taste is also a bit nifty, a bit odd, and the mouth seems not to be holding up its end... it feels a bit thin and the carbonation could be a little more lively. There are some malts that want to be sweet, but fall just short throughout, the spices falling flat due to under-carbonation, some ginger in there brings that bit of nifty funk. I'd like it if the carbonation were there to liven it up, and if it were a bit sweeter, but unfortunately its just a bit... boring. In all, its not a bad beer, and one could probably sit down and drink quite a few of these with ease, but its just not all that interesting."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a golden color ale with a small bubbly white head with little retention. Aroma of light malt with some very subtle spices is blander then expected. Taste is a mix between some dry malt with some light spices and very little yeast in the finish. Body is about average with some medium to low carbonation. This is definitely not one of the most interesting offering from this brewer."
"It pours with a nice, full, enduring head, with good lacing. The color is kind of unappealing -- like diluted lemonade. Clovey aroma. Flavor is mostly clove, with a little ginger and pear. For me, this is just far too drinkable for the style. I always appreciate brewers who experiment, and if you have a few misses along the way, so be it. While New Glarus has some great beers, and they're always trying new things, it does seem that they've had more misses than hits lately."
"Moral of the story is... Don't be that guy, try Stone Soup!"
"Refreshing, quite nice, but not spectacular. Not a session beer, and not a big beer either."
"D - Not a session beer but a great beer to sit down and enjoy."
"This is a refreshing combination that New Glarus has concocted for when the weather gets warmer. I'm not sure of the ABV, but it is a light and easy drinker. Not as full bodied as I had hoped, but a nice brew nonetheless."
"Got in trade with jeffkrenner - thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system but new so know it's fresh. Was a hazy golden honey color. Had a small head that quickly went away. There was a constant carb geyser in the center of the glass. The aroma was very hefe/wit like. It had the clove and bubblegum smells similar to a hefe and also had a ginger spiciness. The only complaint is that the aroma was slightly weak. The taste was really good. It goes down smooth like a hefe with a little bite like a good saison. It's not knock you off your feet great but I found myself grabbing for the glass as soon as I'd put it down after each drink. This would make an excellent session beer. The mouthfeel was nice and balanced with great carb. Overall, another excellent offering from NG. Just wish I could get more of it. Highly recommend. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"D- has a good flavor and drinkability, the sourness is nice, but doesnt lend itself in my mind to lots of them in 1 sitting"
"Single bottle from Discount in Milwaukee. Looks like orangina...yellow/orange with a thin patches of bubbles on top. Sour odor, hints of cumin, yeast and oranges. Tangy, spiced mulled wine flavor with a citrus bitterness. Slightly more bitter than i would prefer, but still a very well made, almost delicate beer. Almost a surprise for me when an interesting beer like this comes out of the same style bottles as spotted cow or naked (not to knock those, they're just plainer styles)"
"Perfect throttled-back version of a tripel. Easy drinker with interesting characteristics. Great summer beer."
"Taste needs some more richness. I didn't think (and didn't know) this was a Belgian PA until this review. I thought it more of a Pilsner with some kick. Yet it's a bit think for a BPA, imo. It is easy to drink and doesn't have any bad tastes, just doesn't fit the style."
"Drinkability - Though I'm a big fan of this local brewer, this beer doesn't really do it for me. Tastes just a few ticks off. I don't expect to get this one again."
"drinkability is great. really nicely balanced. refreshing and enjoyable while sitting on my patio."
"Poured this into my brand new Coors Banquet pint glass. I love the juxtaposition of a good beer in a terrible beer glass. Stone Soup pours a cloudy yellowish straw color with a thin white head. It has a lemony funky aroma. Smells almost like a witbeer. The flavor is really smooth. It has citrus in the front and a yeasty background. There is some spiciness in there as well. It has a medium body and decent drinkability."
"I can drink it, but I would prefer something different."
"I recently sampled a Duvel, which I am using to juxtapose this brew. Stone Soup falls short against such lofty competition. I wonder if this comes down to inferior ingredients  Soup is made with Wisconsin malts, which dont seem to be as well-respected among the homebrew crowds as Belgian and other European malts. That comparison might be unfair, because the alcohol in Soup seems considerably lower. This one would be a good thirst quencher on a hot summer day, one with enough interest to ponder over briefly, but ultimately, it would not be difficult to walk away, leaving an unfinished glass on the table. The metaphor for making something out of nothing, ""Stone Soup," runs a little close to home on this brew."
"D: Theres nothing special about this beer. Just another farmhouse style on the market. Definitely not one of my favorite New Glarus beers."
"A solid brew from New Glarus. I've had some better in the past but this is an affordable highly drinkable brew. I think I'll crack another."
"Not a bad offering from New Glarus. I think the beer is a little confused about itself, and it never settles into something overly drinkable. Worth a try..."
"Tasty offering to say the least...well done."
"Pours a cloudy yellow, hay-like hue. Head was bright white and stayed. The aroma was ""hefe-bel."" I smell hefe yeast, with a bit of belgian scent. No hop smell. I taste spices and yeast, again no hops. Mmouthfeel is great. The beer is drinkable, but not quite sessionable."
"D-Unbelieveably easy to drink. I could definately put a sixer of this down at a Brewer tailgate!"
"D - Here's a tip: Let the carbonation let out on this one for a while and you can really taste the nuances of this beer. Once you are able to taste it, it's really good. Carbonation is a bit of an annoyance."
"This is a very drinkable beer and is great in warm weather. I would love to drink this beer when having a Caesar salad or a nice spicy dish."
"i would drink more of these if they were available. the sessionability of it makes the aftertaste acceptable as i don't dwell on it like i would with a bigger sipper."
"A tough one to put numbers to, but overall, something just wasn't doing it for me, I needed something more, what that is, I'm unsure. This is drinkable enough however - a decent standard of ale for a quick enjoyment, but quite possibly a bit boring beyond one or two."
"Different, but only ok."
"Drinkability: Well, the weather has finally turned warm around here, so a spicy, fruity, easy drinking beer is great for coming off of some yard work. Not the best example of the style I have had, but another solid offering from New Glarus."
"D-I'm impressed...a nice stab at a Belgian Pale Ale....Not the greatest one ever made but I would have no problem having this one in the fridge at all times..."
"Thanks to kmpitz for the birthday present that keeps on giving."
"The aroma is fruity and spicy with notes of lemon meringue. The mouthfee is soft like whipped butter; this is a very delicate beer. The malt has a pilsner quality and blends in a very subtle way with a very light spiciness. I detect a mineral-like quality to this beer, but maybe it's the just the name suggesting this to me. The dryness and slight tart character is very pleasant and makes this beer very sessionable. I'm thinking of it as Duvel lite."
"New Glarus should be commended for continually experimenting and brewing new styles."
"D - Not a bad beer, just too much candy banana flavor for my taste."
"New Glarus has delivered a really interesting beer in their Stone Soup. I was initially unsure of what it was supposed to be. Holding it to the light I found a cloudy golden orange body that looked like a Belgian witbier. Of course, most of New Glarus' beers have a haze from bottle conditioning, but this was fuller. The frothy bright white head settled slowly into a creamy dollop on top, and it left short walls of solid lace behind as I drank. The nose was perhaps the most interesting part right out of the gate, giving off notes of creamy vanilla, soft bubblegum, mild clove, and a bit of some sharper spice, perhaps ginger or all-spice. In the mouth it was light and crisp, medium-light bodied and gently zesty with a very-fine bubbled natural carbonation. The flavor was unusual. It was somewhat sharp, a bit fruity, candyish, and spicy. It came on strong, then softened, revealed some malt and candyish vanilla and clove, and finally faded away in a long-lingering caress of residual spice and malt residue. ... ... kind of like a Belgian tripel, but without the strength. It's complex, but not full or rich. You could certainly drink a lot of these based on the body and flavor aspects, but I'm not sure you'd want to. It doesn't quite have the soft and delicate nature of a witbier, and yet it's not big enough to demand your attention. Still, I found it quite charming, and as I tend to drink several beers in an evening, the idea of a light Tripel is quite enticing. Beyond that, I think I'd really enjoy this while camping, hiking, or boating/canoeing. Nicely done. Very well balanced. Refreshing and enjoyable!"
"Drinkability is fine, although a bit too sweet for my liking. All that spice, yeast and sweetness is too distracting for me. Then again, some of the big beers I like are distracting for others. This just moves in the wrong direction for me for normal enjoyment. Love the name, though."
"Took a bottle from the fridge and poured it directly into a clean glass. Pale to medium yellow, a little cloudy (which is no surprise since it's bottle conditioned), with a nice big white pillowy head. Not much of an aroma. Maybe a hint of citrus? Maybe it's my cold preventing me from smelling much? Lively carbonation. Taste was ok. Not bad. Not great. Almost a little hint of dryness. Hops and malt seemed well balanced, and I could certainly taste the cloves and ginger. Overall this was a good beer. I'll have no problem drinking the other 5 very soon."
"D- This beer has some nice yeasty tart flavors and a good soft grain and malt quality but the flavors are really covered up by the fizz. I don't taste the depth as described on the label and I was envisioning a totally different beer. Perhaps in a warm summer month I will try the rest of the 6-pack and have a different opinion. If so I will re review, but as of now I'm a bit under whelmed."
"Overall: this beer reminded me a lot of a hefeweizen, but with the banana and fruity notes toned back a bit and the spicy, clove and ginger more in the forefront. The carbonation was qutie sparkling, but I thought that it went well with the spicy and tangy nature of the brew, and kept it from being overly syrupy and malty. An interesting and original, and quite sessionable brew. Yum."
"Overall, I think this beer is a pretty good American version of the style. However, I think that it's slightly less bold in flavor than most in this class. Pump in a little bit more malt to this bugger and this would be stupendous."
"12 oz bottle. The beer is very hazy and straw colored in appearance. There is a 2 finger foam over top that falls rapidly to a half-finger. This is maintained by a constant stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Taking a sniff, I find a very strong clove ester along with a more subtle fruity ester layered over a candied-sugar sweet base with just a hint of an edge from a grainey malt. The first sip brings a dominant fruit and clove ester, followed by a mild sugar sweetness and a hint of lemon, finishing with a moderate kiss of noble hop bitterness and a second wave of clove. It is very complex and flavorful without being overpowering. Mouthfeel is on the thick end of moderate with a very solid carbonation, but without being biting. My overall impression of this beer is very favorable. I think the balance in flavor really makes this one a winner. I could easily see having more than one in a sitting as well. It is slightly thick, without being chewy and the carbonation really breaks it up and keeps it from sitting heavy as well."
"Hazy lemon yellow. Frothy snow white head. It fizzes away rather quickly. Lace is decent enough. Nice aroma. Bubblegum esters and clove and a little pepper. Almost like a hefe, but there's a little Belgian yeast contribution on the nose as well. Sweet candy like malts combine with slight bubblegum and Belgian yeast esters and spice to provide a nice little Abbey style ale here. Snappy carbonation, though not too gaseous. That's good. Light to medium body. Enjoyable beer."
"Good, but not too special. Pours with a nice white foamy head. Some lace. Hazyyellow gold. Very nice fragrant aroma more similar to Bavarian wheat than Belgian to me. Bananas, bubblegum and spice present. Fully carbonated and consistant with style. Don't pick up much alcohol. Nice balance, clean, nothing untowards all the way through finish. Sweet with some citric counterpoint."
"Additional note: I found this one to taste much better after swirling the glass to release excess carbonation. I would probably bump taste and mouthfeel up a bit after doing this, but I'm reviewing it how it came out of the bottle. Consider this a huge recommendation to let this warm and swirl your glass."
"It is interesting to watch New Glarus become more and more focused (and better and better at) Belgian styles, which many US craft brewers do not do very well. This is one of the better offerings I've had from this brewer."
"Pours a giant frothy head with a great lacing and a cloudy gold color. The head stays pretty thick and doesn't dissapear. The smell reminds me of a Belgian Triple with some banana like scents. The taste is very light and thicker in body than a triple. It has the backround of banana. The mouthfeel is excellent, the body is so thick and smooth and it goes well with a light flavor. Overall the drinkability is very good, it's something that's smooth down the throat, I love this because of it's thickness. I usually don't go for a lighter beer, but this is thick bodied and full. It's smooth, very smooth and drinkable."
"Note: I need to expand on this review after I think about this beer. My main thought is that it should sit for about 6 months so that the carbonation can mellow. It is really distracting."
