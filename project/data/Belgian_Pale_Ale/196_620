Lots of estery yeasty flavour bananas, soft stone fruit bit of alcohol warmth that is well hidden but definitely there. Nice that this is fairly easy to get hold of in London pubs with pretty much nothing good on offer, seems to have replaced Leffe in a lot of places.","WGO","Mar 27, 2015"

It pours hazy gold under a 3‚Äù off-white moussey head that produces thick lace. The palate attacks with traces of apricot, pineapple, orange and fresh white bread. The yeast flavors are rich and well developed with the balance towards the yeast. It is creamy and very effervescent and refreshing with a medium body.","pat61","Mar 13, 2015"

I agree, many beers should be warmed before serving, but this stuff seems to be looking for room temperature which is a bit too much in my book. It's still a good beer, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't rank this amongst one of the better Belgian's I've tried.","TheHammer","Mar 29, 2014"

Poured into a pint glass (unfortunate I know) with a golden straw color with very visible carbonation and a single finger head which left decent lacing. The aroma is of yeast, fruit and spices with a flavor to match. The yeast comes through very strong in the flavor along with the spices and only hints of fruit. I greatly enjoyed this one and will be looking for it at my local bottle shop.","Rhf9120","Mar 07, 2014"

Leaves lacing on the glass. Very carbonated mouth feel, makes your mouth pucker like you're drinking a sour but this is no sour. Very sweet with a fairly dry finish. Apple aroma & flavors are very strong. Finishes with a subtle, comfortable warming sensation from the 7% abv.

4.2,7.7,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"I realize this is owned by Heineken, but it's still a version of Belgian pale ales as it is full of flavor, heartiness, and enough thickness that it resembles the Trappist beers that it is attempting to emulate. The success of this beer owes to the yeast, which is both fruity and spicy here. I enjoyed this a lot, especially after a long, busy day. Also, could serve as a good gateway beer for people interested in trying Belgian ales.","magictacosinus","Jan 08, 2013"

3.96,1.5,4,3,4.25,5,4,"I wasn't crazy about the smell.. It didn't smell ""pleasant"" like most Belgians. It may have the best mouthfeel of any beer I have ever drank, though. To me, It has actually set the standard to which all other beers are compared. Incredibly smooth and creamy, almost slippery. For a split second, it tasted very light like a lager. Then you start to taste the ""Belgian"" origin, with its elevated, sharp alcoholic bite and sweet, citrus notes. It's a very mild flavor, and is gone quickly, only to return a few seconds later with slightly alcoholic aftertaste. Overall, very drinkable for 7% ABV beer.","dwagner003","Jan 04, 2013"

3.63,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours murky golden in color with palpable chunks of yeast sediment meandering through the brew. The head is frothy and white, but not especially substantial. The aroma is yeasty with noticeable hop presence (reminiscent of Saaz), along with some mild orchard flavors and a surprising dose of alcohol for the ABV. The flavor is very similar to the nose, with perhaps a touch of spice to augment the aforementioned elements. The carbonation is just about perfect, and lends an excellent mouthfeel. Despite that, I find the overall flavor to be only decent. Hops and booze just aren't what I look for in a Belgian ale, though I guess I can't exactly be surprised seeing as this is a strong pale. A little more fruit and/or spice to enhance the balance would be welcome to help elevate this beer from solid to special.","MaximalC","Sep 05, 2012"

Some good spotty lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big pear, apple, grass, pepper, herbal, coriander, clove, floral, earth, bread, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of pear, apple, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, earth, bread, honey, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, bread, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly crisp and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a vibrant clearish gold w/ two-finger fizzy head that died slow and left lace down the glass. Somewhat trypical Belgian aroma of yeast and orange citric, but I'm also picking up light sweet notes as well as some funky herbal hops a touch of fruit. Light, crisp body that passes easily and is lively on the tongue thanks to good carbonation. A touch of spiciness complements the beer, but it's mostly a balance of light fruit like pears/grape/apple(?) w/ a sour twist. Also some good sugary sweetness and bready/chewiness make this a pleasure to drink and overall a solid compact brew that is nice to sip on.","clayrock81","Nov 17, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, and banana. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, banana, dark fruit, and very subtle fruit hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Glad I got an opportunity to try this one on tap. I could imagine this one being a little different in the bottle, but that is pure speculation as I had it long before I was reviewing beers, so it is hard to say for sure, but this was quite enjoyable.

3.7,-5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Affligem Blond pours not quite crystal clear, but is a radiant lemon yellow. Three and a half fingers of head rise about as high as they could have in the glass without cascading out and down the sides of it. Lacing is almost entirely nonexistent, but that may in part have been due to my glass, so I can't dock it fully. Although no remains were left, the creamy white cap did stick around for an impressive amount of time. The nose is decent, but could stand to be a bit more powerful. Pale sweet malts dominate, there's just a faint hint of clove/peppery phenols (which for my money isn't enough). The flavor reminds me of a smaller version of Duvel. Apples and pears come through first, with just a touch of bready flavors present as well. The hop bitterness, while not high, is very noticeable thanks to its whipcrack brief nature. Clove comes in for the close, along with a slight herbal hop flourish. It's not bad, but I'd like a fair bit more of a contribution from the yeast if I'm drinking a BSPA. The mouthfeel is probably the best thing about this beer, the brewer nailed the balance between being light/nimble and having some presence to it. Carbonation is nice and expressive, but could stand to be ratcheted up even a little more. Affligem Blond isn't a bad beer, but I couldn't ever see myself buying it over Duvel if I was in the mood for this style beer, it's similar enough without being quite as good. However, I could very well see myself giving some to someone who was just starting out exploring Belgian style brews.","axeman9182","Nov 10, 2010"

It has a rich golden colour and a touch of cloudiness from bottle conditioning, I suspect. Smell is pleasant, yeasty and slightly fruity (maybe pears and apples). I like the taste, the alcohol shines through the flavours or pears/apples and some honey and overtakes the bread. Mouthfeel is light, warming, and effervescent. Drinkability is fine; and despite the nearly 7% ABV, I think I could have another. Too bad there are only two of these in the four pack! (But I did get a nice chalice)","jhtipton","Oct 16, 2010"

A touch of sugar-like sweetness is perceived. Definitely floral with a touch of fruit, this is good stuff. Drying and cracker-like on the finish with flavors of grain and yeast present, this tastes great.

The taste did yield more spice (mostly clove), as well as candi sugar and some plum. Very thin-bodied and very carbonated. When combined with the thin flavor, it almost seemed like they were gunning for the Belgian equivalent of a bland mass market American lager.

It definitely looks like a blonde: Poured into my Westmalle goblet, it produces a big frothy head that leaves behind considerable lace. There's a lot of sediment, but I've never minded that. The smell is pretty faint, but what's there offers a hint of hefe-like fruit along with the typical spiciness I expect from the style. Taste is much bigger, with clove and citrus, followed by a sharp spiciness. This really tastes more like a hefe/blonde hybrid to me. All-in-all, not too bad at all for something an American micro might experiment with. But the problem is that Affligem boasts itself as being one of Belgium's oldest abbey-breweries.

There's a brisk and clean quality to the nose, sharper overall than expected, peppery with only a pinch of sweet baking spices, herbaceous and grassy as well, dry and high-toned grapefruit and orange citrus, the yeastiness too appears dry and the banana, peach, apple fruit speaks in hushed tones, negligible softening at warmer temps. Medium-bodied, likewise firm unto stern and compact in the mouth, additional clove, cardamom and nutmeg along with the peppery foundation. The carbonation has a tight weave and does not do much to spread the flavors broadly. The grassiness persists, accompanied by unprocessed grains. Little yeastiness nor bready qualities.

It's a nice sweet nutty heavy-yeast type of aroma but it's kind of faint. It's got a very clean taste. No unpleasant bitterness. Just a kind of thick semi-sweet fruity and spiced flavor.

Quite bold and sharp up front as the alcohol bites the tongue, but then warms and the rich flavours come out to play. Sweet malt that shows a very quick honey bite, then fades very quickly. That was a neat trick! Some clove-like spiciness makes an appearance as well. Some bitterness from the hops before the alcohol and the honey-like sweetness do their encore.

Massive bubbles cascade from the bottom of the glass to the surface. Clarity is superb. The nose hits me immediately with a variety of aromas: fruity banana esters, sweet candied sugar, mild clove spiceyness, even a very faint undertone of light lemony zest. There is a lot going on here, but the sweetness is the overriding character that comes through. The first sip brings a blast of spicey yeast characters , along with a mild herbal hop notes. The sweetness and fruity esters that are prevalent in the aroma take a back seat in the flavor. I'm surprised at the hoppyness of this one, even having a little bite on the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light carbonation. It is slightly drying and a touch astringeny on the finish. This is a fairly busy beer, that delivers a vastly different experience in taste compared with the aroma, which I like. The hopping still just seems too prevalent on the finish to me for the style. I think this small format bottle is the right serving size for this brew. It is enjoyable.","kmpitz2","Jun 22, 2007"

The smell is wonderful: sweet malts, citrus, cloves, spices, coriander, some orange. The smell is exceedingly enticing and quintessentially Belgian. Unfortunately it goes down hill from there. The beer is sweet, a bit syrupy, moderately carbonated, a little on the dry side, and malty. It just doesn't taste nearly as good as other Belgian blondes. There is too much hop taste, there is too much alcohol notes, there is too much after taste of pepper, cloves, and hops. It is just not balanced that well, and worst of all there is this annoyingly tinny taste in the middle.

There's a myriad of fruity flavors all blended together, including crisp apple, a hint of pear, apricot and/or peach, and plum and cherry. There is minimal hop flavor.

But at the price I paid, it's not really worth your time unless you're a huge fan of the style (in which case, I'd suspect, you'll have had better).

Pretty clever, I think. And the head is massive, it billows straight up over the rim of the goblet and keeps going. A massive white spongy beast, one simply has to sit back and admire it. The body of this ale itself is a hazed golden honey with slight highlights of apricot, with a decent amount of carbonation action. The nose contains sweet malt and yeast at first, but a peppery spiciness becomes apparent very soon, along with some clove and banana. The mouthfeel is light and effervescent over the palate, contributing to the mild flavours to be experienced. Not much occurs until close to the finish, a medley of malt and honey sweetness blending with the spicy finish, touched with a little bit of citrus on the aftertaste to help cut the spice. The other samples I've had of this stuff seemed more complex at the time, but I was too busy drinking and enjoying them to really break it all down at the time. A decent Belgian blond, not very overwhelming, but I find it a nice ale to sip and relax with, I must admit that I've bought a great deal of these since they've become available in the local market.","IronDjinn","Mar 20, 2005"

3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Affligem Blond is picture perfect in the Affligem chalice glass. The head could be monstrous if you so desired, but even pouring intensely slowly I get more than ample soapy, styrofoam-thick head. A chaliced glass is the only drinking vessel from which to appreciate this. The foam is aspirin white, very consistent, and so creamy it appears solid. It crackles slowly and richly. The lacing is prodigiously viscous, leaving thick pockets of foam all over the glass. The liquid itself is honey with the slightest touch of orange; lightish brown, and almost white-looking in some light. A little hazy, but quite clear. I get pear and chalky-vanilla on my initial sniff. The aroma is creamy, sugary, and sour. From far above the rim I get a peculiar chemical, almost adjunct-type smell, like boozy malt liquor. Curious. In closer there are definite sourdough bread smells, and green apple. After that some light roasted notes, like salted bacon. I smell a great deal of salinity actually. Pasta, peanuts, and also fresh greens, such as spinach. The taste is exceptionally creamy, feeling more like coffee cream in the mouth. The carbonation is low, not making much impression upon the tongue. I did not really begin to taste this beer until it hit the back-middle of my tongue, because up front there is very little save a soapy wateriness. In the middle the malt and alcohol come in, and it leaves with syrupy fruit, such as tangerine. In the finish I get the salted taste, again, like bacon, or beef jerky. Some metal. There is also a fairly intense perfumed taste. At first the beer seems more sweet than dry, but after a bottle I found the reverse is true. The lees, a drudgy green-yellow, with large chunks of yeast, give a little less acidity to the beer. I think a crisper carbonation would do this beer good. Mouthfeel is full. I have tried more complex Belgian blondes, but this one is definitely worth a try at least once. Three cheers for the head on this beer, however. Wow. The creaminess and subdued taste make it quite drinkable.","Cwrw","Dec 29, 2004"

The thick creamy white head lingered throughout and clinged to the side of the glass till the end. The color in the glass was a cloudy medium golden. I think the cloudiness was was due to the fact that I did not let the ale rest after transportation and this ale is rich with yeast.

The flavor of this one reminded me of a Hefeweizen on steroids with its big bananna and clove flavor, but the aftertaste of alchohol changed things drasticly and reminded me quickly that I was not drinking a hefe!

I started by leaving the yeast in the bottle, and found this lead to a very pleasant crisp, slightly dry and slightly fruity (apples) taste. The carbonation and body enhanced the experience. Then I poured in the yeast. I would not say that it produced a nuttier taste. I would say the flavor was a bit more full, perhaps a bit spicier. Beyond that the flavor changed to something i can't describe accurately, I got stuck on the ""nuttier taste"" which I didn't agree with. Instead of determining how best to describe the taste change i kept trying to find the nutty taste. I couldn't find it and suddenly my glass was empty. This is in no way a knock on the beer.

Hate to steal lines from the bottle itself, but it states that the beer is wonderfully aromatic, gold with dense creamy head, honey and spice notes, and a velvety smooth finish.

4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a very solid brew from the folks at Affligem. It pours a slightly orange/copper in color with a thick creamy off-white, persistent head. After the froth dies down, a sticky web-like lace is left on the glass. Aromas are moderately spicy and sweet with slightly fruity undertones. Initial taste is somewhat malty, mixed with yeast, honey, and citrus fruit. A nice crisp zing of spiciness, possibly coriander, is left on the tongue. This is one exceptionally complex, yet balanced brew.","Scooter77","Jun 07, 2003"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A truly excellent beer, although at 7.0% ABV, it is quite potent. Not to be missed.","Pegasus","Apr 09, 2003"
4.5,15.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear golden amber color with a tall pillowy white head that dissipates in chucks leaving a thick and rocky lace that loves to cling to the sides of the glass. Nose is sweet and fruity with notes of yeast, honey, and spice. Medium in body and quite smooth. Taste is sweet honey malts and candied fruit followed by some nutty yeasts and some peppery notes. Some bitter hops and a bit of alcohol are present in the finish. An incredible brew and one of the best blonde ales on the market.","Morris729","Mar 28, 2003"
3.8,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall, this is a good, solid Belgian.","kbub6f","Mar 01, 2003"
4.92,26.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Anyway this pours more of an amber than a blonde. the head is thick and long lasting and creamier than shaving cream. There is a yeasty/nutty nose in this one with barely detectable hops. The taste is very complex with sweet and bitter and spice all mingled around the palate. The hops are more potent in the beginning and the sweet malt comes last. This is excellent.","AtrumAnimus","Feb 23, 2003"
4.25,9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours golden with a good lace. Smells of honey, some grain. Slightly herbal as well. This is extremely smooth tasting, fairly sweet with obvious honey, but gets a little spicey as well. Ends slightly herbal. Fairly warming due to the higher abv. I really enjoyed this beer. It kept me warm through a fairly cold night. Could only drink a couple of these, however.","Admiraldinty","Feb 19, 2003"
3.5,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours cloudy yellow orange color, huge frothy off white lasting head, leaves nice clingy sheets of lace down my glass. Sweet and malty, spicy yeasty aroma. Sweet sugary flavors of malt and spicy cloves. Light body and very carbonated, finishes light and crisp.","maxpower","Jan 12, 2003"
4.1,5.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"On the pour a glamorous golden yellow to amber color with the head modest in size and the lace a fine sheet to cling to the glass both are an off white color. Nose is malt, a little yeast also noticed, citrus like crispness, fresh and pleasing to the senses. The front is sweet, the top reedy with the finish pleasantly acidic and delicately hopped, quite dry aftertaste and a nice drinking beer that is worth the effort to find","Gusler","Oct 29, 2002"
4.73,21.3,4.5,4,5,5,5,"A rich golden color with heavy tight creamy looking foam that cling's to the sides of the glass. Complex in flavor with a beautiful balance of malts and hops to bring out the great flavor with just a bit of bitterness. It was creamy smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Wow, what a beer. This beer was pricy, but worth it!","BeerManDan","Sep 27, 2002"
3.5,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"probably the least interesting of the affligem brews, but still very nice, floral aroma, and nice soft palate finishing with a bitter bite, very nice, dangerously drinkable.","rastaman","Jul 22, 2002"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Just strong enough to cut the chill out of a damp fall day yet deceivingly light where I could drink more than one.","Jason","Jul 18, 2002"
4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. The closest comparison I can think of is probably Leffe Blond. I think this one is better though. Fuller bodied and flavored. Nice crispness with alternating hints of sweetness and hop bitterness. Prickly carbonation. A welcome spiciness is ever present. An excellent brew that's effortless to drink.","John","Jun 19, 2002"
3.83,-1.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"I have to agree, this beer formed a phenom of a head!  I thought I had an ice cream float for a few seconds.  It left some nice lace after it subsided.  It had the heavy carbonation aspect common to the Belgians.  A slight aroma of hops and alcohol.  Taste was of some hops and citrus.  Nice finish to it.  I just can't shake the feeling that I have had better of this style, even Ohio law limits my selection.  Worth checking out though.","Wildman","Jun 18, 2002"
3.81,-2.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Aroma right off is alcoholic and gives a warning what you're in for.  Taste is less strong than the aroma suggests, smooth and refreshing.  By the time you're at the bottom you feel the alcohol.","javier","May 16, 2002"
4.66,19.5,5,4,5,4,5,"My favorite ""blonde""! What a beer! Pours with a thick head...almost like whipped cream. Nice subdued flowery nose, goes down too easy, very deceptive when you consider the alcoholic strength about 7% I think. Another fine addition to my beer aging cellar.","beerluvr","Dec 03, 2001"
