"Distinctive taste with an attractive color and smell."

"I'm a big fan of Belgian style beers and what I can say about this beer is that it tastes good but its missing the wow factor. It is light or liquid in its mouthfeel which just doesn't make it feel like an iconic Belgian beer but its delicious and so easy to drink. I think this is the PERFECT way to describe this beer... It is the evolution of BMC (Bud, Miller, Coors) beers. If you know someone who likes BMC beers I can't imagine that they could dislike this beer. I'd venture that this would be the best beer they ever drank. That might sound like a weird way to describe the beer but it reminds me of a light beer like (BMC) but with the outstanding flavor of a Belgian beer mixed together. So it is light and effervescent but also flavorful. It stands at a nice 6.8% alcohol too. This would be great in the summer time or warmer weather. I was able to get it for about $2.50 per bottle, which is just too much for what it is. If it was offered for $1.50 per bottle (in a six pack) I could see myself buying this beer at parties for groups of people since I know everyone could drink it. From beer snob to a BMC drinker. The more I drank it the more I liked it. The first sip I wasn't blown away, but by the end of it I felt like a monk gave me his blessing. :-)"

"O: A decent American-made BPA (organic, as well) that doesn't stand out at all but is still a solid drinker. Pick some up if you're into the whole organic thing or enjoy the rest of Uinta's brews"

"Really really good for a newer brewery such as this. My only complaint which is hardly such, is that it isn't sold by the sixer, as much as Uinta tries to convince you that this beer deserves to be savored, that's so shit, it's not that special, but definitely out the glass sans bottle."

"12oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Pours a lovely tangerine-colored hue with a slight haze to the clarity and a frothy, 3/4 inch bright white head that eventually settles into a consistent slick.  Nose is very much akin to a witte - citrus and belgian yeast.  Taste follows nose; however, the fruit comes off a bit more candied in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light), with a pleasant, lively carbonation.  All and all, simple and somewhat clean, but quite pleasant."

"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Poured a gold color with thin white head. Smelled yeast cloves. Tasted citrus, malt, and slightly spicy, and sweet. Mouth feel was good, medium carbonation, medium body. Overall, nothing to particularly not, good but would get something else in the future."

"Poured into a juice tumbler. Translucent gold with a thin white head. Mild clove aroma. Taste and mouth much like Leffe Blond: clove, bubblegum, apple with sweet malt underneath. Champagne-like in the mouth, somehow delicate or fragile. Excellent. Uinta surprised me with this one."

"Overall: There is very little about this beer that demands to be called out. It’s very plain and kind of boring to drink. I didn’t hate it, but I don’t know why I would ever order another one (3/5)."

"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light fruit and clove nose, flavor is yeasty light sweet fruit and light hops. Good Belgian blond but Leffe is better. Bottled Jun 12, 2012, 12oz bottle from Gift Specialists Oceanside, California."
""

"As good as Leffe, not up to Chimay, but the most ""authentic"" belgian style made in America that I myself have tried. Organic. (bought at Whole foods with 6 other singles - a great policy - bravo Whole Foods!) I like it and would happily serve it again. (Check expiry date when buying singles, mine was 5 months old, but still perfect, but all the same, 5 months...)"

"Overall- I really liked this beer its quaffable, an understated belgian style. A beer doesn't need to be bold to be good. This beer everything is quite subtle and it works out nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, hits the spot for a belgian golden ale, and should be 8+% but only clocks in at 6.8 somehow. Otherwise typical flavors and characteristics."
""
"This beer isn't very complex. The yeast does all the work imparting esters some faint spicyness, but even those flavors don't keep me interested for long. Overall, this beer is a bit subdued and toned down. It was nice to try once, but I won't be picking it up again."
"Overall/Comments: A good Belgian style blonde ale here nothing spectacular but a good representation of the style. Picked this up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Classified as a Belgian Pale Ale at 6.8% ABV. Brewed on 9/7/12. Consumed on 12/23/12."
""
""
"The taste is semi sweet with a touch a bitterness. not much complexity. way to clean for a Belgian blond imo. not much to glean from this beer. its drinkable I guess but I would think the yeast selection along with the filterering just take out all the character of this beer. pretty disappointing."
"O- Starting to take the plunge into belgian ales. This one being on the ""lighter"" end of the spectrum I think is a great foray into the world of belgian golden/pale ales. Overall I was very impressed. I found the flavors to be very pronounced and bold and complex is a word which really describes this type of ale. Can't wait to sample more like this. Pick it up."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"What happened to the flavor? If this is what it's suppose to be, sorry, I'm not usually a fan of very dry beers."
""
""
"Meh - I am a bit biased being not that into Belgian styles in the first place....but this just lacked anything interesting. Not a bad drink but not one I would seek out again."
"O-I have another one of these in the fridge. I will drink it, but will I buy it again? Maybe. I have had better Belgian ales before."
"O: Very impressed with this Belgian pale ale. I would definitely get this again and probably will pick up a few 6 packs when I see it in a shop."
""
""
"A lot of yeast spice and a nice overall fruit feel. Drinks easily and brings strong Belgian influence."
"D - Such a beery beer. I would get this again. Quality. Unita is so underrated. Everything I've ever had from them has been solid without fail. And this is another good showing."
""
""
"This is a very clear beer. Nice looking though. Nose is super yeasty at first and then dies down to nothing quite quickly. Flavor is full. Heavy yeast tones again with strong bread character as well. There are tones of banana on here as well. A little thick in the mouth, but it works. Most Belgian ales seem to be a disaster, but I can appreciate this one. It could stand to be a bit more rounded on the profile, but I've definitely had some horrid Belgian ales out of the US; this is not one of them."
"Very dry finish and highly attenuated throughout, with just mild sweetness emerging as the beer comes to room temperature. The flavor goes with the faint aroma: light fruit--peach or apricot. Some grass and light earth hop. The dry finish reveals some mild bitterness and spicy yeasty notes. Finish is clean but over quickly. Highly drinkable but unremarkable."

"It is just really plain, there is nothing that distinguishes it besides its gorgeous appearance."
"From a 12 oz bottle...pours a cloudy orangish color with an off-white 1 1/2 finger head. Has a crisp smell with notes of light fruiit. The tell-tale Belgian yeast dominates the taste along with fruity tones. No booziiness. Nice consistent but thin mouth feel. A decent but not outstanding representation of a Belgian Golden. Very drinkable..."
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a puffy 1/2 inch off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grain/malt and some slight fruit and spice aromas. Taste is of grain/malt, honey, fruit, and some slight spice flavors on the finish. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is easy to drink."
"Overall: When the mouthfeel is the thing you like best about a beer, you know you are in trouble; in this case, I didn't really care for the malt beer and the kick of alcohol (particularly for such a low ABV beer); the hint of lemon in the finish was a nice touch but it didn't make up for the rest"
""
""
""
"Overall - Doesn't taste like anything Belgian to me. Rather disappointing IMO."
""
""
"I was pretty surprised at how bad this beer was. Quite pale, almost lager-ish in color. Smell is pretty simple, light but with some alcohol to it. Flavor is very starchy, with a stale cereal quality. Mouthfeel is a bit acrid. Overall pretty disappointing."
"Overall – not a bad-tasting brew at all, but not very complex or fun to think about."
"Overall I like the beer; the mixture of clove, spices, and malt is nice. The ABV is still enough to get the job done and the carbonation of the brew is different but not overpowering. (As a side note, the label on the bottle that I purchased is different than the label in the picture)."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours bright gold with a thin head that holds no retention and leaves no lace - looks like apple juice. Smells like apple juice too. Tastes like apple juice with some grape qualities - dry white wine perhaps, earthy, herbal hops, fruity, with a slight Belgian flare from the yeast. Mouth-feel is rather thin with no carbonation. Finishes dry like a cheap chardonnay. Alcohol is well concealed for 6.8%. Overall, I don't know what to think of this one. I see other reviews are giving this a higher score, but this wasn't any different than drinking a glass of apple juice mixed with some cheap white wine. I wouldn't recommend this beer."

"This beer taste great, has a little mineral quality on the finish that just completes everything. Easy to drink, and brings a smile to my face!"
""
"Overall: This was a surprise. A really good Belgian style beer. Like a Duvel light, and at a bargain price. I've been impressed with Uinta."
""
""
"D - Overall, not a bad drink, but not something I would reach for again; there are better Belgian Pale Ale's out there; needs a little more body and a more defined identity; I feel Belgian pale ale have a unique balance of spice, malt, hop flavor; this beer seems a little all over the place"
"a largely unremarkable brew, except that it is of very high quality. pours light lager color yellow with a nice 1 inch foam head bone white. smells mild hops and belgian sweetness. taste is much less hoppy than any american pale ale, but less yeasty and bright than a typical belgian. a sort of boring hybrid of styles, but again, very well made. mouthfeel is nice, super light and drinkable. a pretty good beer if your looking for something down easy, and with an elevated abv it serves its purpose..."
"Organic, quite tasty. Fruity banana like smell that comes out somewhat in the taste. The Belgium yeast is prominent, and gives the beer a nice subtle complex flavor. Hints of clove. Full mouthfeel. Finishes dry, but at the last second some sweet creeps in. Overall I like this and would get it again."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, maize color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, coriander, slight wheat, pale malt, slight dough, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coriander, slight alcohol, slight yeast, slight wheat, hint of hop, and a slight sweet malt. Overall, food aroma, feel, and blend."
""
"With the new-look label, clearly states bottled 10/12/11."
""
"Trying a bottle of Monkshine Belgian Pale Ale that was brought back from a trip our West by my Bro-in-law. The beer poured a clear pale yellow with thin white head that is not lacing. The smell light banana and clove notes there was a slight spice. The taste includes belgium yeast and sugar mixed with some nice pine hints. The mouthfeel is light body with good carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer."
""
""
""
"Overall the taste is unconventional but quite tasty. I will buy this again."
"Would've love to try this fresher to see if the hops are more prominent. Still a good take on the style that hits most of the right notes"
"Think of this as a Belgian-inspired ale and you might not be so critical."
"12 oz single from Roths Sunnyside market, S.Salem. $1.50 Slightly misty lookng golden beer with a very bubbly off white head. Aroma is slightly spiced some slight earthiness.weak clove, cereal and some slight earthiness. Taste is strange not like the aroma..semi-bitter..tasty..some black pepper and thats it. Its OK on the tongue the carbonation is OK but far from a great mouthfeel. Not impressed by thisn one..i guess its drinkable..but a dissapointing Belgian style ale"
"Pours a golden amber with a somewhat short white head that fades to a thin cap. Very light aromas of stone fruits and a touch of vanilla and citrus. Tastes a little harsh, with notes of spice, grain, stone fruit, and solvent. A little too carbonated as well, with a seltzery finish. It seems like the Belgian yeast notes haven't really matured here. I'd say back to the drawing board with this beer."
"Fruity, light spice, a wiff of nutty yeast. Delicate hopping, subtle Belgian characteristics. Nice summer time offering. Would be quite worthy with a meal of salads, cheese and other lighter fare."
"Overall I think I'd not recommend this drink to many, I find Uinta falling short on my list from what I've had from them, and this doesn't bring much either"
"Overall this beer is not bad, but not one of my favorite examples of the style."
"O: It tastes like a lightly hopped APA with Belgian yeast."
"O- Nice brew, i would certainly have again."
"-Light and sparkling. Slick and easy to drink. Surprisingly nice."
"O: Wasn't expecting much from this beer but found it to be fairly good."
"For a Belgian ale this really needs to have more substance to it. The beer pours out yellow and has some decent head on it. The beer itself is pretty bland in flavor, There isn't much other than some Belgian Yeast flavors in it. The mouthfeel is light. There just isn't anything standing out to me in this brew. I strongly feel that this beer could have been a lot better with some more time and effort put into it."
"Overall this beer is way too simple and devoid of all the upfront yeast character that is tradition in Belgian ales. It's pretty drinkable but I won't be having this again."
"Sadly this 6er was the first brew from Uinta that I have not really liked. The good news is it has a lot of alcohol (6+ %) and was pretty darn cheep at just over 6 dollars for the 6 pack."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smeel is alive with fruits, yeast, some spice. Taste is good, fruits and spice, slightly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"(12oz bottle). Pours hazy golden with chunky white head. Active carbonation. Aroma of belgian yeast, pepper, ripe banana, and some citrus. Taste is sweet with a definite, but smooth hop bitterness. Medium bodied with thick mouthfeel. Finish is bitter. That bitterness is pretty tame, but it seems to amplify the more you drink. The bitterness becomes distracting to me, but I do think its a well made beer."
"Pours with a nice, foamy, frothy, medium sized, off white head that lasts a bit and no lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is malt, caramel, yeast, and a bit of fruit which is alltogether mild as a whole. Flavor is a little bubblegum and white wine, a little fruity sweet. not too bad. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of short length; alcohol is hidden pretty well."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This has some decent notes to it but is lacking the classic Belgian mouthfeel."
"A worthy BPA, but could use more balance."
"D- I think this is a beer tailor made for people who enjoy the occasional beer. This isn't a beer I could see myself having more than a glass of, mainly due to the taste towards the beginning. This isn't a bad beer by any means, but more for occasions rather than a session beer."
"Light to medium on the palate. Some sweet pear, sweet apple, and tart apple provide a nice mix to the malt up front. Dry through the center. The finish has clove and spice. This is a balanced solid brew. The fruity yeast nicely complements the spice in the finish. I enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel is acceptable, a little metallic and jarring at first, but fairly creamy by the end. Not a bad stab at this style, which although it's not my favorite Belgian, is definitely underrated in the US. Brewers: make more of these beers!"
"I'm a little dissapointed by the metallic flavor and the low amount of tasty Belgian yeast characteristics."
"Drinkability: The thumb points down on this one. Many beers could benefit from tweak or two to get things back on track, others just need to be scrapped. This is a case of the latter."
"Pretty good drinking, but becomes boring after a bit. Don't think this one could handle food pairings of cheese or fish."
"M/D - good carbonation and mouthfeel, decent flavor that is easy to drink, pretty standard and nothing too amazing"
"Pours a sparkling golden color, with a good inch or so of fluffy white foam. Aromas of white pepper, Belgian yeast and candi sugar. A little biscuit malt on the palate, along with apples, pears and a little dark spice. A nice refreshing beer, enjoyable on a hot afternoon."
"Drinkability: this beer was pleasant but it grew a bit tiring on me as the glass emptied."
"M/D: light bodied didn't really pack a pale ale feel and drinkability. Almost feels and drunks like a coors."
"drinkability: cool name, cool bottle, but avg craft beer. not a big fan of the style but I have had better belgian pales."
"The mouthfeel is thin and highlights the sourness on the finish."
"Another brew from Four+ that was better than I expected. In general, if something's good enough to ship out of Utah, it's probably pretty damned good."
"Overall a pleasant and relatively full bodied pale ale."
"It has a nice apple taste, malty. Some caramel. Sweet. Very smooth with a slight bitter aftertaste. Vice nice, balanced beer."
"D- Easy drinking and pretty average. Nothing spectacular."
"D: fairly good, sharp and tight from the bubbly nature of the carbonation providing a nice crispness associated per style. Soft belgain yeasty attributes fit in well here, not over the top or will challenge for contender for Belgian pale of the year, but none the less a fairly decent attempt from a little known east coast American brewery. Stands the test of time and delivers so worth a try."
"Pours a luminous golden color with no haze and a modest sized white head. Nose has some alcohol punch on it with light fruits such as peaches/pears. Some bready esters are present also, as well as on the palate. Some resembles a few qualities of a tripel, but in a more drinkable format. Finish is on the sweet side with quite a bit of alcohol warmth given the relatively low ABV."
"Overall, I found this one to be rather lacking. It seemed to have a lot of alcohol taste for only 6.8%, and really lacked anything of substance."
"D - This is a pretty good brew. It's the only thing that I've had from Four+ and I found it quite drinkable."
"Monkshine is a pleasant surprise out of left field. Who would have thought that a brewery from Utah (Uinta) would be able to kick ass and take names when it comes to the creation of a Belgian-style pale ale? This is good beer if you have the opportunity to buy it or trade for it."
"This is a very good attempt at belgian style and I will definitely try again."
"D - Interesting beer, but I probably wouldn't want more than one personally. The flavors get a bit bland after a while and the hop character on this one is pretty minimal. Not a horrible beer, but pretty average overall."
"D: This is a nice little beer. The alcohol presence in the flavor makes it seem stronger than it is. It's not as complex as the best members of this style, but still a worthy beer in my book."
"Thanks to wasatch for this one via a recent trade. I think that just about does it for all the Utah beers I've had in the fridge this past month!"
"Future outlook: Very solid, accessible BPA that is probably pretty sessionable...but no matter, as I can't get this stuff here!"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. Flavorful and nice feel. Would have bought a six pack of this instead of the other one I purchased."
"Interesting label. Pours a clear golden body beneath a full head of dense bright-white froth. Head retention and lacing could be better. Fine bubbles can be seen rising quickly. Lots of clove in the nose. A note of vanilla. A bit of earthiness as well, and some minor sulphur. Sweetish malt. The mouthfeel is good. It's medium-light bodied and creamy smooth. The flavor is mainly sweetish and doughy golden malt and yeasty earthiness, spiciness, and clove and vanilla. Some leafy hops are present as well, but the sweetish, almost candyish maltiness is clearly the showpiece. Restrained bitterness. Long, lingering finish. 4% abv? I'm not sure about that. But it is from Utah, so of course it is, right? I said the same thing about their Wild Fire Extra Pale Ale... I don't think it will turn any beer geek heads, but it's a pretty good initiation to this style of Belgian beer for everyone else. I wouldn't turn it down :)"
"The brew is very drinkable, with a nice aftertaste. Very drinkable - just not spectacular. Very much case worthy."
"D: Beer was pretty smooth and not real filling, so in fairness, easy to drink. Just not much very special about the beer."
"Overall impression: This one has subtle flavors, but it is pretty drinkable .. not a bad beer."
"Immemorable, sums it up."
"D - High level of drinkability. Very sessionable. For me this is kind of like if Budweiser were a belgian ale, and I mean that in a good way. Seems like it would be a great summer beer to me. I can imagine one by a pool."
"D: I have really enjoyed this beer, and will probably go back for a six pack. This is an enjoyable beer. Lots of good flavors. Not 4.0% though. No way."
"Overall not a bad little beer. A bit light, but still very good. Nice use of light hops and not too heavy. I could see myself drinking this one again, no problem."
"Overall, A very poor resemblance of a Belgian pale ale. I don't think that they use corn to make it. I didn't not like this beer. I think it came from Budweiser."
"This is not an impressive beer and struck me as an amaturish effort. I'm thinking this is a beer and brewery to be avoided."
"O) Peppery, earthy, full of Belgian/Utah goodness. A well brewed piece of work."
"Pours a light golden orange with a decent white head. Smells of sweet and hoppy. The taste starts out smooth and crisp, then moves to hoppy spices but finishes with easy citrus flavors. Great mouthfeel, you get everything without the damage. Really drinkable."
"A totally competent rendition of a Belgian Pale ale, which is pretty impressive for a 4% ABV beer. Easily drinkable, and the low ABV lends itself to enjoying several in one sitting."
"This has a lot of fermentation character packed into it without being overly funky. It is actually much nicer than I was expecting, though I wasn't really expecting anything as I have no experience with this brewery."
"Mouthfeel is light and lingering and the drinkability on this is ok. There is a noticeable amount of carbonation as well. Definitely drink this one at proper temp and don't let it warm too much, it's best at the correct temperature for sure."
"D - Overall it's a nicely drinkable beer..just not a style I enjoy as much.."
"It is not terribly complex, but given the very low alcohol for such a tasty brew, I wish I had more of this around during summer- very few session beers taste like this."
"Body is a little thin and the finish is long, dry, and bitter. Overall, not a bad, especially at only 4% abv, it's very flavorful. Thanks, Geoff!"
"Bottle. Poured a slighly hazy golden color with a thick white head. Strong lacing. Aroma is fruity with a bit of coriander. Flavor is light but nice. It is fruity with a banana Now and Later taste to it. Coriander is present in the aftertaste. I imagine this to be a very nice summer session beer."
"Bottle smell is of citrus and spices. Poured into a tankard and it has a strong head that really foams. Color is a bright yellow. Lots of carbonation evident and the head is really strong. Taste is very unique. I didn't know what to expect from a ""Belgian pale"" but all the elements are there. Earthy Belgian flavors with the hoppy bite of pale ale.. Very interesting. I usually like these two styles independently but they are a good fit together in this brew. Actually the start is Belgian and in the finish the pale ale comes through with a very broad semi bitterness that lingers. Two beers in one! Salud!"
"Sampled from a complimentary bottle in the Delta Crown Room at the SLC airport. Pours a hazy light brown color with golden highlights, topped by a whispy, bubbly head that isn't much to look at. Nose is predominantly spicy Belgian yeast, with notes of coriander and allspice, along with some tangy European hops. Palate is a nice balance between light sweet malt and Euro hops, along with some subtle spices from the yeast. Mouthfeel is more foamy than creamy. A so-so interpretation of a good Belgian style. Wouldn't have it again, especially if I had to pay for it."
"This was my first beer from Utah and hopefully the rest aren't like this one. It started out kind of nice, with it's very fluffy head and super cloudy body. Then it just went down hill from there. The smell was pretty much average for the style, except it lacked the alcoholy hint in it. The taste was pretty much blah. Nothing really stood out to write about. The mouthfeel was more of a champainge than a beer. It was really bubbly and thin on the palate. Nothing to get excited about, but it's another state in the annols of beer reviews."
"12 ounce bottle, just purchased at Bon Vivant in Smithfield, VA for $1.75, best before 7-21-05."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, lightcrystal, and bisquit malts. It also has a fruity yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter and a bit earthy. There is some malt complexity here, but the dry, earthy finish diminishes the overall taste. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low/medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a different tasting Belgian brew. I like the complexity, but the overall flavor needs some work."
"Drinkability is good easy to drink goes down smooth, would be great summer brew. Overall probably wouldn't chose again if a better pale was available. Picked this up at the Vintage Cellar strange it only has two reviews prior to this one."
"First off, I cannot believe someone else has tried this brew. I guess it's a new brewery. Dated 10/28/05, I like this when a brewery puts a date. Pours a nice golden yellow with a real nice head which lingers alittle while. There's a nice trace of lacing left for the whole duration. Has a wheat/malty scent with a nice light-medium body. Never had a Belgian Pale Ale before, so I cannot comment on that, but it does remind me of a Hefe-Weizen. This is a very social brew."
"Maybe a slight haze, but mostly clear golden copper body with a thick, steady, off-white/cream head. Tangy Belgian malt aroma, with light sugar sweetness, spices (maybe some clove or nutmeg), and a sourdough yeastiness. Taste light crisp wheat malt up front. Faint candyish sweetness barely registers. Kind of grainy and tannin-astringent mid-palate, followed by yeast and carrot cake spiciness. Moderate bitterness with lingering tannin astringency into the finish. Not bad at all. Light-medium bodied with adequate carbonation. A little grainy, and thin, but not a bad Belgian-inspired session ale."
