"I ordered the palm because I wanted a carribean drink and all they Had was Red Stripe so I went for the Belgium beer that had a palm on it hoping for the best. What I got was thus ultra sweet beer that I would just have to say, was made for the ladies."
"Very smooth. More of an Irish beer taste than typical Belgian."
""
""
""
"Solid good tasting beer. Not the best Belgian but good stuff."
""
""
""
" The taste begins with a good malt flavor with light toasted quality with a slightly phenolic yeast with gentle fruitiness and slight spiced flavor with a dry and mildly medicinal taste in the finish. This is a simple amber -no frills yet easy to drink with some Belgian yeast character. I would drink this again, better than most amber ales in my opinion."
""
""
"Enjoyed from the bottle in a pint glass, this standard Belgian pale pours a clear light amber with a nice white head that lingers and solid lacing.  Rather clean nose of light caramel malts and light mild hops.  Flavors are sweet up front with a hair of bittering to the back.  A little light bread flavor comes through the aftertaste.  Good carbonation makes for a lively effervescent mouth feel.  A decent session Belgian pale, but nothing too exciting."
""
""
""
""
"Skunky, wtf did I just drink?"
"This dismal 'ale' was the only alternative to Heineken in Amsterdam airport - watery and tasteless - borderline drinkable, but would choose pretty much anything Belgian over this."

"Pours a clear yellow/orange with a fizzy head that doesn't leave trails down the glass. The smell was very clean with some malt and yeast scents but nothing too overpowering. The taste was well balanced between sweet malt and bitter hops with some bread flavors from the yeast. Overall a very decent beer that does everything well enough."

"A better version of Heineken. Still not all that good but totally drinkable."

"Yummy in my tummy"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium bronze amber with a thin patchy white head that leaves a thick ring around the glass and light patchy lacing. Aroma of bready and caramel malt, light overripe stone fruit, Belgian yeast, a hint of toffee. Flavor is a lighter version of the aroma with a similar mixture of flavors, but rather attenuated. Light to medium bodied. Hits all the notes for a Belgian pale, but the flavor is light and rather bland with the semi-sweet malt dominating the fruit flavors despite being light itself. I'll hope this is an old bottle, else this is one of the more underwhelming Belgians I've tasted. Satisfactory, with no off-notes, but nothing I'd ever try again."

"Overall – It tastes quite like I imagine the child of Amstel and Kilkenny would if they could have a child. It feels almost like a beer that has some growing up to do. Not a bad beer at all but at the same time far from the best thing to ever come out of Belgium."
"O: Is it a watered down Belgian or a glorified AA Lager??? I lean towards the later in spite of its classification and that way I am not disappointed.  Not nearly the gusto, flavour and impressiveness of others in this category such as Orval, or Petrus.  From that perspective it leaves much to be desired.  Its not as good as a De Konninik, also in this category.  However, I was expecting Labatts and was pleasantly surprised this went beyond that.  Worth a try but not too many accolades from me.  Would go well with pressed sandwiches that are still hot."

"Sampled a pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A light golden amber with a half-finger or so of white bubbles on top. Aroma largely fruity, apple, pear, and peach notes yielding a gummy bear-like effect that is accompanied by a light orange and lemon rind citric note. I am puzzled by the lack of spicy notes on both nose and palate. This is a Belgian ale, correct? Drinks light and fizzy like a lager or macro-brewed pale ale, bubblegum fruity and slightly floral. Semi-dry and almost no Belgian yeast phenols, although Micheal Jackson writes that the Palm yeast strain yields a dry orange character and I can certainly taste that here. Some of this citrus carries over into the semi-dry finish. Forgettable when compared to many other Belgian brews although enjoyable enough on a hot patio."

"Someone told me this is the beer that Fat Tire is based on. I believe them. The malt profiles are quite similar--and quite good--only Palm doesn't have any of that weird, burny dryness that affects the back end of most of New Belgium's brews. A very nice, malty session beer."
""
""
"I really enjoy Palm, it has a great crisp taste and stands up well as an accompaniment to food or as a solo act. It has a good clean aroma and has a nice golden sheen when poured. There is no aftertaste and pours well. It does not have the full body flavor of its neighbor Heineken but it is very satisfying."
""
""
"Even though I only had one of these, it would have been possible to down a few more in a sitting. No, this doesn't stack up well compared to the heavier hitters and Trappist beers that fall into this category but as a starter, this worked out fine for me. Some more spice and strength would have enhanced this nicely but I'll probably give this a go again soon, only because it's warm out and it's nice to have a ""light"" take on a style that can be quite heavy at times!"

"I am trying different brands of this style and found this to be almost misplaced. Although a nice looking amber ale, I found the taste to be out of the norm for the style. It reminded me of a hoppy version of Amber Bock, but with a little more complex ale flavor. The esters and fruitiness of traditional Belgian ale yeasts do not come through in this beer. Some may like it but I will pass for a Leffe Blonde any day..."

"a session beer indeed. with its higher ABV.. good party beer."
""
""
"Standard Belgium Ale lacking imagination. Bready, seedy with almost no hops aroma. 1 finger white head that dissipates slowly with no lacing. Lovely amber color. Medium body with oily finish. Very lager like with very little hops bitterness. Gets a bit more complex aroma if you let it warm up a little."
"D:Easy but unremarkable. I had to try it, glad I did, but now need to trade some of it away. 3.25"

"I want to call this Belgium's version of Budweiser but people would nail me to a cross comparing a lager to an ale. This golden ale from belgium poured out a solid amount of white lacing while not much bubbling appeared in the liquid itself. It was a yellow-ish dark golden color. Mild to sweet smelling, and doesn't have a prescence of high alcohol. No flavoring at the finish. This beer lacks in the taste department. A bit of a session beer with no distinct characteristics."

"DATE TASTED: November 16, 2013... GLASSWARE: Ommegang stem... OCCASION: celebrating the unseasonably warm afternoon of football, Christmas lights and fun with my sons... APPEARANCE: opaque, deep golden amber body with a soft, foamy thin white head that rings uniformly; lacing is cirrus cloud and ocean crest... AROMA: aromatic, fruity--sour apple and tart candy... PALATE: light, fizzy as cider; possesses some staying power in the mouth, but rather dry like champagne...TASTE: mildly tart and pleasantly crisp with little exchange of flavor in the exhale; an underlying hint of lager malts, but inevitably this is a clean basket of fruit with enough hops to hint at an ale...OVERALL: This has to be one of those handful of brews I have passed numerous times, always intending to try and never quite trying; its inclusion in the ""Great Beers of Belgium"" forced my hand, and I am pleased to find it a serviceable, light, cheaper version of Unibroue's wonderful Ephemere (which announces its apple right up front); a single notch below the Estaminet pilsner in the sample, and two below the Rodenbach--but beer drinking isn't really a competition, right?..."

"not sure why this is rated so low, I like everything about it. the pour is gorgeous, clear pale red color with an inch of white fluffy head in a proper palm globe. bubbles shoot up and tickle the nose like a soda pop. the nose on this is lighter than expected, not a high dose of Belgian yeast and rich red malt I expected, but rather an understated mix of both. the malts aren't sweet at all, gentle and earthy, and the hops are floral and subtle as well. the yeast gives this beer a great lightness of feel, and an easy drinkability. sure its not the most dynamic flavor profile out there, especially coming from the beer motherland, but this is a perfectly sessionable beer, far superior to so many American reds. its got a very clean feel and finish, refreshing. overall this beer probably deserves a little more respect, although ive never had the bottled version and the tap might make it a whole lot better."

"Had it at Trattoria Newbury that has a $3 draft night all the time. So I reviewing this considering it was cheap. Good start. Pours an amber color from what I can see. The smell is mass market lagerish. This was a beer that stayed well carbonated. Trying to stay positive. Taste is kind of yeasty, a little malty with a chemical kind of taste. This is a very poor beer that thankfully has Belgium on its name. Reminder to me. Stop ordering this!"
""
""
""
"Lighter in flavor than expected. The malt character dominates, but I anticipated more yeast contribution."
""
""
""
"Overall this is not a bad beer but it does not have me jumping for joy either. I don't hate it but I don't love it."

"Palm is a easy drinking euro style lager.  Has light body with good carbonation.  Poured clear with white head...not much lace.  The scent has a slight breadiness to it.  The taste was evenly balanced....overall...its decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost medium body, lightish effervescence. Neither warming nor especially drying, just middle-of-the-road. Won't search for it won't say no to a free one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a thin white head and copper color. Aroma is a pasteurized, played out mix of creamy malt and weak hops. Flavor is light and blah with balanced malt and hops. Mouthfeel is light and smooth due to muted carbonation. Doesn't feel like 5% abv. Overall, I am underwhelmed by the weak ass flavor. I've been spoiled by New Belgium. Pass!"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall this is a fine beer that won't blow anyone away, but that everyone should enjoy."
""
"Tough beer to buy because I never know how long it's been sitting on the shelves. Which is why I'm pleased to find it on tap. Even so it's pretty mediocre at its best."

"Clear orange glow with clingy and stingy bright white head. On the lighter side of medium bodied. Toasted hearty breads up front with an spicy and earthy hop finish. Hops cut up the malt bill a bit for a clean and pleasant lingering bitterness. A simple beer but with extremely clean and good flavors that I happen to enjoy."
""
""
"O: Good. Better than I had expected. Great for a warm summer day."
""
""
""
"Had on tap at McCoul's the other night.Poured an orange tinged lighter golden with a thinner white head atop.Aromas were really clean for a beer of this style,light yeast and lagar-like toasted grain with a hint of iron.Again clean on the palate with very mild yeasty spiced notes to mix with some grain and a little honey sweetness.You can tell this is a more mass produced beer, it lacks alot and is very average."
"I am watching DRINKING MADE EASY while enjoying this beer. GREAT show as is THREE SHEETS! If you have not seen these shows - look them up on youtube or do as I have and purchase the DVDs - they are awesome and HILARIOUS! All beer drinkers (or drinkers in general) should see them all!"
""
"This pours a clear, amber color with minimal head. The aroma is a cross between a grassy adjunct lager and a pilsner. The taste is a god awful grainy, grass flavor that tastes very similar to Red Dog. Thin texture, very little flavor, and cheap taste does not make this beer very desirable. I tried it once but never again."
""
""
"This is a review of the unfiltered version served on draught in a restaurant in Gent. This ale has the appearance of many unfiltered wheat beers. Cloudy and dark straw colored with a weak white head. Aroma and taste is a very nice balance of wheat and barley malt. Very slight spicy hop character. Extremely high drinkability. Haven't tried the filtered bottle version but this baby was solid. Recommended."
"O: Overall a great example of your typical Belgian Ale, nothing to extreme or awesome but good beer."

"Served at Bier Market in Toronto. Paired with chicken schnitzel and Belgian waffles. Very weak ale. Amber colored with a film of a head, just an average sweet malt taste. Would not recommend with a sweet food such as the honey drizzled waffles, however was a good match for the chicken schnitzel."

"The body and flavor are thin and lifeless. Head dissipates quickly , Arroma has a touch of biscuit but overall an insipid beer. Why would they do this to water?"
""
""
""
""
"Had on tap in a tulip glass. Poured to a nice biscuit head which dissipates shortly with little lacing. Appearance was a clear, amber to copper color. Aroma was light with hints of sweet malt. Taste was grainy and lightly hopped with hints of caramel. Mouthfeel was medium to light with a nice dry, bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""

"Overall I thought this beer was pretty disappointing and I don't think it's a good example of the style, the Belgian Pale Ale aspects that I like about this style were on the light side and there were just too many off flavors for this to be a decent beer. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down smooth and the body was on the lighter side, but the flavor didn't hold my attention and I was over it after the first couple sips, if I had to I could drink a few of these, but there's nothing about this beer that makes me want to grab another, so one is more than enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only aspect of this beer that I thought was fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the flavor and aroma, they both weren't good with too many off flavors and aromas. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's pretty easy to find a much better Belgian Pale Ale, it was pretty inexpensive and now I know why, not recommended to anyone. All in all I was pretty let down with beer, it wasn't what I expected and the added metallic and skunky flavors and aromas really hurt this beer. This was my first experience with Palm and it made for a poor first impression, I'm still down to try more of their brews, but after this one I for sure won't be in a hurry to. So far this is my least favorite Belgian beer, it needs a lot of work."
""
"Overall: Well, I have something of a soft spot for this one. When I went to Belgium last year I checked into the flat we rented and walked straight out to find beer. This was the first one I came across. Yes, it's like the Budweiser of Belgium, but you never forget your first. I like it in part for the nostalgia."

"Another Inbev disaster. Had this on-tap at an American wood-fired pizza venue. Decent amber color, but ultra-thin tasting. Nothing Belgian about this. No odor or nose to speak of either. I kept wanting a hint of flavor- but practically no grain and no hopping evident. Watery mouthfeel too. As the menu had no prices for drinks, I had to ask the waitress what I was paying for this beer- hoping it wasn't a $6 pint- she assured me it was only $3. You get what you pay for and I won't make the mistake of ordering this again. As a fan of Belgian beers from Gulden Draak to Maredsou to Kwak, this beer delivered nothing of the character or malty goodness of those- a bit of research online shows this to be another Inbev disaster which means to find it on-tap at a mainstream bar means this is Budweiser product. This one is to be avoided."

""

"Overall - not very impressive, I had never had it before today and I think I had higher expectations. Could be a pizza, burger beer - - something to not think too much about as it washes down the chow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle looks nice with the red, green and horse art. This beer is amber clear color, foamy head, hint of sweet honey, medium carbonation, bit dry aftertaste and slightly skunky. Notes of caramel, grain and light hops in taste, overall decent average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"A beer that could only be dreamed up in a lab after copious tasting panels and adjustments to ensure that it appeals to the market...which is to say...a lame market. Not something that I would ever buy, but hey, this is ""the finest of Belgium"". Ummm, ok. Not much above a drain-pour unless it's ice-cold."
""

""

"Overall a basic pedestrian ale with not much to offer flavor wise. Uneventful."

"Overall, I enjoyed this beer as an “alternative to pilsners and lagers”, and found it to be a pleasant easy-drinking beer that deserves more than a single try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Palm is a decent beer. I like pale ales, and this one's not too bad. Nothing sticks out that would make me go to a store and buy a six pack, but I still enjoyed it. Not too heavy on flavor or aroma, but very drinkable."

"Pours a medium amber with a creamy head, good lacing. Scent of grassy malt, a bit of oak, and some earthiness, with a touch of hops. Taste is somewhat weak for the style, tastes kind of watered down, with some light hoppiness and a sourdough taste. Light mouthfeel, the carbonation is somewhat strong and detracts even more from the taste. Has a sharp aftertaste too. Wouldn't recommend when theres so many more in this style that are arguably far better. There might even be a few mass produced beers I'd consider over this one."
"The beer appeared to be light copper in color with noticeable carbonation rising to the top of the glass. The beer produced a nice foamy, white head that was well retained that subsided into a nice half finger cap that lasted throughout the beer. The aroma was light, sweet malts mainly with an ever so slight earthy/grassy hop. The flavor of the beer followed the aroma, a light, mainly sweet malts and some yeast. The beer had a light feel to it, but had good carbonation. The beer was very easy to drink and was crisp and refreshing. Overall, a decent beer, and one that I would probably pick before your typical mass brewed American beers."
""
"Pours a dark golden/ copper color with about a one finger white head that reduced into a filmy layer. The aroma has just a hint of caramel malt with some grassy hop in the background, some earthy tones as well along with bread. The taste is smooth, nice and easy drinking with some more of that caramel malt and a hint of lemony hops, more bread and a slightly metallic finish. The beer is light/ medium bodied with nice carbonation and a slightly dry finish. I honestly thought this beer would have more flavor, it didn't but nonetheless it is a simple easy drinking beer that I could enjoy again."
"Served from tap into a tulip. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, earth, earth hop, and caramel hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, cream, and caramel hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. I had heard quite a bit about this one from numerous people, but I have no idea why they were raving over this one. The aroma and flavor on this one were very weak in intensity. There were some good notes in the aroma, but you had to work so hard to find them it was ridiculous. The flavor on the otherhand wasn’t bad, but it was definitely average for the style as nothing stood out at all. Worth trying, but I doubt I will be doing so again."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink, enjoyable, and sessionable. The beer has a very good appearance and I feel like I needed to review this one since I frequently review from my Palm glass."
"Final Grade: 2.63, an unmemorable C minus. To be fair, Palm's label admits that there is corn in here, so it was a bit doomed from the start. There are so many high quality Belgian pale ales out there to compare it to, and the ones I have tried all compare favourably to this. The relative blandness makes it easy to throw back quickly, but most people who bother will probably find it to be an almost completely forgettable glass of beer. I would drink this again if it were being offered, but I don't plan to revisit it."
"It's a decent beer when nothing else is available. It's certainly better than Heineken. Certainly better than the average American-adjunk offerings."
""
"O: very drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
"This beer is light bodied. Goes down easy. Makes me feel like I should be mowing the lawn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the grain with some toffee, honey and graham cracker notes. The flavor is similar, with the grain coming through the strongest. I also get some sweetness and a touch of toffee and bread. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Fairly bland, but nothing offensive. Easy to drink."
""
""
"O- Pairs well with food but is generally uninteresting on its own. Not terrible, but not worth the price."
""
"Not sure if they were going with a beer to compete against Stella. As a BPA, I find this beer to be extremely boring. I guess I am not digging the yeast that they used. Perhaps a good alternative to a Heineken or Euro mass produced lagers."
""
""
"Overall, a very average beer. No reason to seek this out."
""
" D+"
""
""
" Now, I like Palm and for a moment I thought it could replace my usual lagers and pilsners that I drink after a long day at work, but after having it continuously for almost a week, I find it a bit boring, to tell the truth. Still, a good beer to break the routine every once a while."
""
""
"This was an ok beer, I thought it was much too thin for the style and the flavor was lacking a bit."
""

""
""

"O: ""Average"" about sums it up. Wouldn't refuse another but certainly not going to seek one out."

""
"This is as underwhelming as it gets. There isn't anything memorable about this one. I'll pass."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain/malt, caramel, and some slight yeast aromas. Taste is pretty much the same and a bit watery overall. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer but at least it looks good in the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a stye I'd choose regularly, but a beer I've seen repeatedly and wanted to give it a shot. Glad I did, but am unlikely to purchase future bottles."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty generic Amber Ale with a great drinkability..."
""
""
""
"There is not much thing to expect, just average Pale Ale."
"Out of a bottle “Belgium’s Amber Beer” was a clear apricot orange color with a good amount of rising carbonation and a thin skim of off-white head. The retention was less than impressive and it only left small spots of lacing like far away stars. The aroma was mostly euro pale-lager malts with the typical strong emphasis on grains and a light undertone of adjunct grains. The flavors were, well, exactly like the aroma suggested. Not exactly Belgium’s finest. Still, it was not unpleasant in any way, just right down the middle and what it lacked in complexity it made up for in drinkability. Very well balanced and highly sessionable. The mouthfeel was average, the body light and the carbonation good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OK beer. For me it comes across as part light Amber Ale and part Adjunct Lager. For $9 a six-pack...there are better options."
"Pours a medium hued amber with a nice white head. Aroma and Taste is grains, some grassy notes finishes with some lightly toasted caramel malts end a bit of nutty flavor and bit of funkiness, some light bitterness. A nice light to medium body and crisp mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Overall a bit light for an amber style ale, not the worst but there are plenty better brews."
"O: An OK beer, but not one I'd seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very underwhelming beer, not much different than American Amber/Red Lagers I have had. Definitely will keep passing by this."

"O - This is a trainwreck that is okay at best, but there has to be better options. Don't expect much."

"Bright copper/amber body with a finger of off white head. Soda-like carbonation, nice lacing of glass. Scent is lightly citrus, fruity. Taste is sweet, apricot the barest hint of hops. No aftertaste or bitterness. A nice ""dessert"" beer."
"This is a nice glowing orange with a small tight head and very visible carbonation--all kinds of bubbles just rushing up and sticking to the edge of the glass! The mouthfeel is as watery and fizzy as this led me to expect, but the taste is really sweet. Sugars, malts, a bit of apricot? and some earthy hops in the end. But mostly sugars. Overall a quite one-note Belgian macro. Nice enough to drink but one was enough for me."

"O/D-Mediocre and unmemorable. Not awful. Just pretty bland. Could have been much worse."
"M: Sweet in general with some balancing points of hops basically but not to bitter balanced and with good medium lasting."
"O- Very drinkable, a nice blend of two styles (amber / belgium). Very smooth and mellow. This would be a great beer for someone looking for a smooth and malty alternative too the average ale. I would not look to this as a true belgian ale offering, but as a beer that is more interesting and has a wider appeal this is a great."
"Notes: This moderate-bodied beer has a very soft mouthfeel, and is quite easy to drink. It's not the most flavorful beer in the world, but it's still pretty good. A great session brew."
"Affligem still likely my favorite of the sessionable belgian pale ales but this is really good and drinkable. Nice scent which is belgian in style with the fruitiness but not too far. Meant to be a session beer and I agree…"
"O: updated: This beer was better than I remember the first time.  Initial review: Frankly, I was disappointed in this beer. It was well balanced but not very flavorful."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer is really strange. I really want to like it. It has some different qualities that make me like it, but on the other hand the off-characters are so prominent that I can't help but admit I can't enjoy it. It's really a chore to drink, and I would really never again try this in my life. But it's definitely interesting. It's entirely possible I just got a skunked bottle, because based on the other reviews, it doesn't seem like I'm supposed to be getting what I am."
"O: I liked this beer pretty well for its malt-slanted character, but I wish it had a little more malt complexity and maybe some Belgian yeast notes. All in all, I am glad I got the chance to try it and wouldn't shy away from it in the future. Palm would be a good gateway beer for people moving from BMC to better beer."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable beer here, albeit a pretty simple one. I'd choose this one any day versus most of the Euro lagers that I see in mass quantities when I go to the store."
"The beer leaves a little metallic aftertaste. Well carbonated, leaves me and my mouth feeling bubbly."
"D - Great drink; very enjoyable; low alcohol content, but packed with roasted malt and biscuit flavor; give it a shot, you won't be disappointed"
"Overall, for a Belgian Pale Ale this ale fails. If this was an English pale ale, I would give it an average score."
"O: A pathetic brew that doesn't deserve to associate itself with its great country. At least Stella, while light, is well composed. This brew is a mess."
" Not one of my favorite Belgian experiences that's for sure."
"O: too sweet for my taste buds, for a pale ale that is. It seems to me this is more of an Amber ale than anything. I thought at first I was reviewing the wrong beer but this is how it is titled so it must be right."
"Just didn't bring it. Too expensive to be part of a regular lineup. Glad I got to try it at SDIBF and not drop serious cash. Pass."
"I was really looking forward to this beer as I've been in search of a good summer session ale for a while. I'm very disappointed in it based on price and what could have been. For $8.50 a six-pack (11.2 ounce bottles), I expect something more than a thin, nearly tasteless ale. I was not expecting a flavor punch in the mouth, but what taste there was mainly came from a slightly metallic and sour aftertaste. Nice looking head, pretty amber color liquid, and decent amount of alcohol (5.4%) but totally blah when it comes to taste."
"Poured from a tap into a goblet. Color was dark red, almost brown. About 1 3/4 inches of head. Smelled fairly hoppy. Heavy smell, but rich and flavorful. Not too much carbonation. Pleasantly bitter and didn't taste much like the smell. It somehow got better as it went on. Very smooth taste for the high hops."
"Poured at the Sharp Edge Bistro On Penn, a crystal clear amber body with a white head fine even lacing. Aroma has a mild nuttiness with tame fruits, nice cereal grains with a pretty bland nose as a whole. Flavor wise is very much like any boring amber ale but with a heavy price tag in this case it was like 7.50 for a standard pour in a signature glass. Semi sweet grassy herbal hops a bit of caramel biscuit malt backing it all up let me down a very one dimensional snooze alert flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied light carbonation really no fireworks. Overall really not interesting enough to peak my interest ever again, a beer that is Belgian but the age of mass produced marketing campaign in Belgian ales."
"That theme carried over to the flavor which was malty sweet but kept refreshing by the fruity notes. Not at all complex, and I doubt I would drink many. Still, it was refreshing on an unusually hot day in Grand Rapids, MI. This tastes more like a malty amber style ale."
"D - Not terribly impressive, it looks good but it really goes downhill from there. The aroma is very lightly malty with a good dose of musty hops. I tend to associate this hop profile more with British ales, but it is not entirely out of place in a Belgian. The flavor is disappointing with a weak malt profile that turns a bit sour in the finish and hops that are, again, a bit musty for the style. Not a very good beer and not one that I would drink again."
"O - Forgettable and pedestrian, could give Belgian beer a bad name (Disclaimer, I expect any country/brewery/brewer is capable of making both awesome and terrible beers, but given the pedestal ""Belgians"" are put on this was a big dissapointment.)"
"Palm is a fairly inoffensive beer that isn't very interesting. It isn't worth the price I paid for it either."
"O: This is an incredibly average and totally forgettable beer."
"O/D - Not too bad but not overly interesting. A standard beer with more complexity than North American 'macros' but not a whole lot to go on besides that."
"This is a good beer for people that can't handle strong beer flavors. If you are a member on here; then this beer probably isn't for you."
"Overall - This is just another Euro macro style. Nothing worthy at all. Light watery flavorless and slightly skunky. Not worth the import pricetag at all."
"Palm gives you an idea of Belgium's rich, distinctive brewing culture only as much as Paris depicts the whole of France or, for that matter, how well you can say you know London because you had a layover in Heathrow. It is only ""Belgian"" at all in that it's brewed there and because it tries to emulate Stella Artois - and even at that it does a poor job. Definitely pass."
"From what I understand this beer is made with all European ingredients. It tastes very English, even though it's made in Belgium. This is one of the only amber-esque ales I have enjoyed. This is clearly a beer with a lot of work put into it, but clearly not as special as beers I am used too."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small dry roast and somewhat floral. In the taste, flowery, caramel, and just a hint of earth. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry earthy and floral like aftertaste. OK, quite flowery and nice caramel, but overall, eh!"
"I have no idea what this stuff is, but it does have some beery qualities, so drink up or pour it out, and let's have something better."
"From the bottle marked 06.10.11-3.24.2300. Sampled on May 9, 2011. The maber pour is clean and crisp as a whole with little head but a fine enough malty aroma. The body is creamy and medium. The taste is full of sweet caramel malts with an OK lighty hoppe ending. It tastes like it supposed to and is pleasant enough in its own way."
"OK beer,yeast and water.Belgian macro, Nothing special, a little toasty is interesting for a sip. LCBO bottle, pouring medium yellow hued body with lots of foamy off-white head. A tad funky aroma. Creamy, oily mouthfeel, heavily carbonated. Not super drinkable."
"Palm pours out as an amber colored brew with a tannish white head that had some pretty good retention. The aroma of the beer had some sweet malt and yeast in it. The taste of the beer followed the same guide lines. This beer had a decent amount of flavors in it. There was a sweetness in the beer that was pleasant and it had some hops in the background. This beer wasn't too bad but it wasn't the greatest Belgian beer by any means. It's an average brew to say the least."
"O - This is a fairly impressive big name belgian pale ale. Stuff is very easy to drink and I could put back large quanities of this."
"Pours a clean and clear golden amber color, minimal cap of white head, little retention or bready qualities hidden behind a lightly sweet pale malt and musty hops nose. Taste is quite clean, lightly sweet with a touch of musty earthyness comming from the hops, very light vegital like taste. Medium bodied, some slick oilyness to it. lower in carbonation, lightly dry. Joins Stella as no more than a light import to have in leiu of a BMC, not really somehting to seek out if your looking for a Belgian style beer."
"O: It's an average Belgian pale ale. It's like a sweet pilsner with a bitter bite. Tastes ok and easy to drink."
"O: This is a solid Belgian pale ale. The character comes from the sugars rather than the yeast, but it's quite refreshing and flavorful."
"Had this on tap at Finnegan's in Yorktown Heights. Truly the best offering they carried; as it was saddled up next to Bud Light, Stella, Blue Moon and a few other adjuncts. Actually, it was a pleasant surprise to see. Dark golden coloring, head had already dissipated by the time the server brought it over. Not a bad beer, but nothing really stood out. Carbonation was moderate and it went down smooth. If I'm back at Finnegan's it is what I will order, but other than that, I'm not searching it out again."
"Overall: This beer just isn't my favorite. I was told to compare it to fat tire by a representative, and it falls a bit short. The grape flavor and smell kept bugging me."
"i see by the reviews it didn't rate to high but sometimes simple and mild are better bold and in your face. that said my review. pours light clear copper in color with half inch off white head and a light lace. smells of sweet malt and a slightly earthy smell to it as well. sweet taste, malty, has a light taste of tea meduim body and nice smooth mouthfeel. very easy to drink and i would buy again."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- overall this beer was in offensive certainly and had some decent aspects to it but was really just to sweet lacking more other aspects, would be really hard to imagine sitting around drinking this beer all night because would really just become to much, its smoothness is its strong point but its sweet malt bombyness is for me anyway bit to much, didn't hate it but probably wouldn't buy it again"
"drinkability: A nice session beer. Not something I'll revisit often but an occasional addition."
"Pours amber and clear, with very good head. Scent of slightly skunky hop and malt. Flavor was slightly sweet with a touch of bitterness, and maltiness in the finish is nice. Great soft mouthfeel, not a bit unpleasant. But not for the sweetness, very drinkable. I'd recommend 1 or 2, but no more."
"Palm pours a totally translucent amber to burnt orange. There's no head to speak of, but that may be at least in part due to a bad pour. There's just a bit of bready malts in the aroma (not bad, but where are the pears and green apples), along with a pinch of clove and a noble hop herbal note Everything really struggles to come through at all though. The flavor brings more of the same. It's not awful, but the malt profile is wrong for the style and the overall impact is still a bit dull. The beer's got a little bit of body to it, just enough heft for the style. The carbonation's not ideal for the style, it's a little bit light, but it's still got enough presence to be serviceable. Palm's not a terrible beer, but were it not for the Cloverleaf's MBA program I don't think I'd bother ordering it."
"Pours a deep amber colour, 1/4 - 1/2"" white head nice lace left at the top of the glass. Looks nothing like the picture on the box. Smells of thin malt, corn, and a slightly sweet note come through. Taste is weak. Mild malt and little hops come through followed by a corn taste. Medium to thin mouthfeel, comparable to Beck's or Lowenbrau. I could drink one of these, but thats it. The best part of this beer is the way it looks in the glass."
"Wow - the most American styled (in a particularly unflattering way) Belgian offering that I've ever tasted. Not worthy enough, though, to actually recommend beyond the curio factor, as Belgium has so much more better stuff to explore."
"Beer is thin and grainy and sweet. It finishes with this slight acidity and huskiness then the whole thing goes to hell. There is a HUGE aftertaste that is 100% boiled corn. This was HORRID."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my DT snifter. 07-01-2011 indicated on the back label. Pours a translucent copper with a loose, effervescing, quarter inch head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually settles into a dollop and a band around the edges. A few spots and strands of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is nothing special - somewhat macro-esque with a suggestion of pale malts, a light citrus character and a skunky quality. Taste follows nose with some residual sweetness in the mix reminiscent of corn extract. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a little residual carbonation burn at the back of the throat. All and all, a fairly unexciting Belgian Pale Ale."
"12oz bottle. Pours amber color with a foamy, white head. Aroma is of yeast and fruit. Smooth, medium body, medium carbonation. Flavors are balanced between caramel malt and earthy hops. Refreshing and simple, very drinkable. This brew is not bad at all. ."
"I was disappointed with this beer. Not really what I expected. I most likely won't buy this again."
"D: It isn't that difficult to drink this beer given its low alcohol content and light amount of bitterness."
"330ml can, poured into my leffe goblet, 1 finger head. Looks like apple juice, clings on to the glass. Smoothish, slight manure smell, not in a really bad way. I can taste lemon, lime and some dairy. Aftertaste is bittersweet. In my past years before I discovered craft/real ale I thought this was the best thing ever and would plough through them, now one is enough. I still like it eventhough I've had much better"
"D: Odd, but not particularly great. Drinkable but I wouldn't jump to it."
"A bit of a letdown if you are expecting a big european taste. Very muted flavor but nothing bad which makes it drinkable. You could easily have a few of these in one session but you wont be blown away."
"Taste is clean, crisp, with a nice malt backbone. Less complex than a typical Belgian Pale, but solid drinkability. Drinks like a lager, tastes like an ale, all told, very nice."
"Not bad, but the fact is that there are an awful lot of pale ales made here in the states that are at least as good as this beer, and are sold at a much more favorable price point. Not sure I can ever see myself getting another glass of this stuff."
"Pours a sparkling amber in color and is well-carbonated. The aroma is bright, both sweet and tart at the same time. The beer drinks light, refreshing, with a nice slight caramel sweetness balanced with a slight, tart hoppiness. Very well balanced and proportioned. This could be used as a session beer."
"This was just brought into the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a golden orange colour with white head that dissipates rather quickly with small lacing on the glass. Smells of grassy hops and some Belgian yeast. Quite mild tasting, some bitterness and sweetness. Very smooth carbonation. A nice enough beer, but nothing to be excited about."
"Fairly High carbonation level works with this beer. I enjoyed it and though it went well with food."
"This is truly an amber ale, and definitely not a pale ale. Sort of like a slightly more refined Yuengling, oddly enough. Decent."
"Had a Palm on tap this past weekend at Brasserie Gaslight in the South End. Served in a branded Palm goblet. Dark orange color with a nice contrasting white head. Good amount of carbonation and some decent lacing. A nice looking beer when served in its own glass. Smell was a bit spicy, and had some grass clippings aroma also. Taste was good. The flavor had a great malt profile. There was also a nice bit of tangy hops at the very end of the sip. Mouthfeel was very crisp and smooth. I can see why this would be an everyday beer in Belgium. It is very drinkable and pairs well with food or can easily stand alone as a beer to enjoy. Nice to see Palm getting into this market. And at $6 for a glass, that easily competes with me for attention while out drinking."
"Pours a beautiful clear golden amber with a thick, frothy, fairly persistent snow-white head. Aroma is strong and mainly fruity with a malty undertone and a hint of hops. Crisp flavor is malty and just a little fruity. Texture is fairly fizzy, and finish has just a touch of hop bitterness."
"D-nice and pleasant. Very drinkable. I would drink this beer again."
"Overall I wasn't terribly impressed with this beer. It's not bad but it's also certainly not worth seeking out."
"D/O- I'm a fan of Helles Lagers and this reminds me of a Belgian version of those beers. It's nothing earth shattering, but I enjoyed this beer and could probably polish off a sixer of it rather easily. A great warm/hot weather beer. I'll probably purchase another six-pack of this before the Summer done. Cheers."
"I would try it again in case it was a bad batch, but after that, not unless there was significant improvement."
"Got a six pack of this - came in a cardboard box. The label I have looks similar, but reads ""Belgium's Amber Beer"" instead of ""special"". It pours out rather nice looking light amber, with good carbonation. The aroma is average. However, the flavor was highly metallic. I have had this problem with other Belgium brews (Stella). Too bad - I was more hopeful this would be nice, but it was not at all."
"D: Very drinkable, I liked this one a lot since it had a lot of mild flavors coming together and making it quite drinkable."
"Far from horrible, but pretty underwhelming for the more experienced beer drinkers. Better as it warms for sure."
"Will not revisit."
"D: A very average beer, nothing really interesting and it doesn't scream Belgian. Tasting it blind I don't know that I'd would think it was Belgian, pretty standard amber beer."
"I like this kind of a thick malty beer even though it's out of profile for what one would expect from a Belgian ale...malt is prominent and a welcome...a satisfying approachable ale. I'll be back for more"
"Mouthfeel:"
"D- Palm is a simple brew, lacking many of the rich complexities of most belgians. It is however well balanced and easily drinkable."
"Overall, this one could have been substituted with water for accompanying a meal. On it's own (before food arrived), it really didn't have much going for it. More intensity in the flavor would have helped. this was the featured beer on tap. I'll never have this again."
"Drinkability: Palm Not-Particularly-Speciale is a very simple brew, lacking many of the rich complexities, but it does excel at being well balanced and easily drinkable."
"Light bodied, prickly carbonation, pretty mild overall - I enjoyed it!"
"Smooth, allthough watery; I found this one a bit disappointing. It's not at all as complex as i had hoped."
"Served cold in a large tulip glass at Casa Dijanna in Watertown, CT this shows a clear copper color with a decent off-white froth on top and very nice lacing. The nose picks up a mild wheat and nutty clove, a hint of alcohol, and just a touch of citrus/pine hop. The flavor offers a smooth almond malt with bright lemongrass hop. It has plenty of tingly carbonation with a medium body plus feel. It's mostly grassy but with a nice neutralizing malt and a pleasant dry finish. An enjoyable option that is especially nice with food."
"cheers!"
"Served up a wonderful deep amber with magnificent parchment head that climbed up the sides of the goblet and left sticky lacing in its wake. The aroma was very malty with caramel, biscuit and some toastyness, as well as a light herbal hop bouquet. The flavor was quite nice, if not a bit bland. Malty caramel and toffee balanced against a firm bitterness and some floral grassy hops. Spice and fruity esters seem to be nearly absent. Though mild, it is well balanced and a great beer to have with food. The body was medium with just the right amount of carbonation and a very dry finish. Quaffable and tasty, but a bit on the boring side. It was the perfect beer to cap off a long day traipsing around Manhattan."
"High drinkability as this goes down very easy, but the flavor is not very exciting at all. The kind of beer I could drink all night. I have mixed feelings about this beer because it was good, but just so average that it was a let down. I will drink this again since it's quite easy to drink and refreshing."
"D: Limited drinkability, and limited appeal, one would definitely be my limit here, and I struggled even with that. Comes off as a macro attempt at a craft beer rather a true Belgian. This is what I would consider the BMC of Belgium. I would pass on this. A perfect example of mediocrity all around."
"D - Quite drinkable, but far from extraordinary."
"Bright and clear deep gold to amber in color. Big thick bright white foamy head. Not much comes through in the smell. Pretty bland. Very nice crisp and balanced flavors. Slightly fruity and citric mixed with a clean bitter hoppy finish. A good malty base holds everything together nicely. This is a very likable beer. Belgian beers intimidate me a little because of all the different exotic ways they can go. This is just a very nice, simple tasting beer. Simple in a good way. I call it beer flavored beer. I like it."
"I've edited this review to increase the scores after having the canned version. There seems to be more flavour and more aroma when this beer comes from a can - it probably deserves this higher score for the on-tap version too, strange that it always seems to me a little less impressive in the bottle."
"Good mouthfeel tastes a bit dry. This is a drinkable beer, especial with hot summer nights."
"This may be a macro beer but It does a lot more for me than what Stella Artois, Hoegaarden, or Leffe do."
"Drinkability: A decent beer. Nothing special but not bad. Worth a try if you can find it but don't go out of your way."
"Nose very malty, fruity as well, probably the Orange Curacao. There is also a touch of honey which shall end glass. On the palate, is highly aromatic hops and yeast provides citrus flavors. Finish fairly dry, a little taste of hops and lager in the aftertaste. Beer very sweet and refreshing. It's all."
"Pours a clear golden color with frothy white head that is quite thick. The aroma exudes grainy hops. Flavor has a bit of sweetness, balanced by a sour bitter finish. A bit of pear and other fruits are present, but not with any real strength. Mouthfeel is thin like a mass-produced ale, with light carbonation. Overall this beer is light and easy to drink, but lacks anything to truly draw you in."
"This is a Euro macro but a nice one. Worth a taste."
"At $8 for a tulip glass full I was expecting a lot more from this beer. It looked appealing when it was served with its amber color and creamy two finger head. However, it all kinda went downhill from there. The smell was nothing special - as a matter of fact I could barely smell anything - not much character. The mouthfeel was nice, with medium carbonation - taste was quite boring, with a bit of a metallic finish and an almost cheese-like aftertaste."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer. A good Belgian pale, I liked the way the fruit and the Belgian spices mixed. Very light, I could have two or three."
"I got through the glass, and then immediately switched back to the Brooklyn Lager. I can live with that."
"The taste is pleasant, if underwhelming. The taste changes noticeably with warmth. Malt is very prominent, with caramel, a sticky mouthfeel with significant carbonation."
"Light amber, one finger white head, quick dissipation, good lacing. The citrusy ester yeast dominates the nose, with a subtle hop presence on the back end. Taste is pretty citrusy, minimal hops, sweet malts, with a dry finish. Decent carbonation. A nice session ale, but nothing special."
"D: A nicely blnded beer that is low in alcohol, tasty, goes down easily and that one could sit with for a night."
"Update 3/19/11: Had on-tap a couple times since. Not grainy or rough, more of a fruity flavored beer. I bet that Heroe's was hanging onto the keg for too long when I first tried it, and the (presumably) fresher kegs since have shown this beer's true profile."
"D: This could be considered a session beer, but after awhile, getting past the smell could be difficult."
"Overall: This is a nice session beer. Not too complex. This beer doesn't cause a taste explosion in the mouth, but has a well balanced taste. Recommendable to start a drinking evening in the pub, or just together with a dinner."
"D: This beer is a very drinkable ale that I'll drink again."
"D: I'll finish my glass but this won't be on my shopping list next time around."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is also mild, a tad bitter, not a lot of flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a mediocre offering."
"Very nice ""gateway beer."""
"A decent amber color beer if that's what you're looking for but a bit of a disapointment if you want something more belgian in character. This beer has good amber color, a pale ale aroma and can be quite drinkable but you don't get the belgian quality you expect from this style."
"this peer pours a crustal clear golden color with a barely off white head that recedes to a ring of lace, without much adherence to the glass. the aroma brings a bit of yeastiness, pale malt, and a bit of hops. the taste is again just the pale malt, yeast and a bit of hop bitterness. the light mouthfeel and good co2 make this an easy drinker as is attested to by the condensation on the empty glass."
"A mild, well-balanced amber."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry pale malt scent with hints of low lovibond crystal malts as well. The yeast esters are quite low and the aroma is earthy and dry. The taste is average. It has a very plain pale malt flavor with a super dry finish. The esters are again subtle with little to no fruit character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbnonation. This is an average Belgian ale. There's nothing too exceptional going on here, just a solid well balanced beer."
"Excellent for sipping in an outdoor cafe and goes well with spicy or ethnic foods."
"11.2 ounce bottle, with best before dating on the rear label. Pours clear (no yeast on the bottom of this one) typical almond amber, quickly departing off white head, minimal lacing left on the glass. Bread dough nose. Malty brew, lacking the spicing/interest of other Belgians. Doughy malt theme continues. Slightly watery, I dont pick up spice, hops or much else...one and done on this one...with so many other more interesting Belgians out there I highly doubt I would ever go for one of these again..."
"Smell is not impressive. Taste is mild and malty, a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinkability is ok, but this is a pretty average brew."
"Tap @ Pizza Port SB. First beer from this brewer. Poured clear amber with a short ring of white bubbles. Decent lacing. Musty malt and caramel nose. Some apple and dry hops give it a floral feel. Taste is flat, watery. Biscuity malt with a fruity malt companion. Couldn't tell if the metallic bitterness was from the hops or possibly crystal malt, either way it was flat. Coincidentally, the beer was not. It was very carbonated. Overall, this tasted like a watered-down macro version of a Belgian pale."
"Where you would expect hops on the finish, this beer gives dark fruits, which I think it due to the yeast character. Interesting."
"Not a bad beer, just not good enough to recommend over a Delerium Tripel, say."
"I suppose that all those years of drinking Duvel and Chimay and Rochefort have spoiled me. I tend to expect alot of insanely complex fruit and spice in my Belgians. Palm doesn't have that; in fact, it has more in common with a British pale ale than it does with its bolder Belgian brethren. That said, it is a well-brewed beer which lends itself to drinking with dinner. Pretty good stuff."
"drinkability. this is an ease to drink beer almost like a lager to me,nothing special but worth a try."
"D- Extremely drinkable with low alcohol, making it even easier to drink alot. Palm tasted kind of bland to me fresh off the tap but 10 or so minutes in the flavor just came together making me smile. A good Belgian Pale Ale of which there are alot."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, it's a good beer but there are better Belgian ambers out there."
"Drinkability: I found this one OK for drinkability and could easily have had a couple more. It also paired well with the spicy shrimp dish that was lunch. However, that being said I'd probably not make any special effort to seek it out to have again."
"Color me unimpressed. Had a glass while watching Gent-Wevelgem in Ghent. This was a thin, but drinkable Belgian pale ale with less flavor than usual for the mass-produced Belgian-style ales. I was hoping for a little more, but alas. Watery white bread malts with a hint of caramel and Belgian spice. Not worth trying, but not a horrible option."
"$9 in a branded tulip glass at the brass monkey in nyc - not impressed with this one - thought it was a little flat - could've been the tap - thin head, no lacing, micro-carbonation, - tasted very biscuity and a little cloying - worth a try, but not second glass -"
"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.4%. Clear reddish amber colour, decent off-white head. Moderate aroma, some malts and caramel. The flavour has quite a bit of caramel with moderate hops, some grain and fruit. Hints of alcohol. Not too bad, but Palm Dobbel was more to my liking."
"M: smooth and creamy. medium bodied ale. carbonation level is higher than normal."
"wtf is this crap?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Alive and crackly, this beer's texture is really quite fantastic. While the pin-size carbonation sizzles the tongue, it also immediately pulls back and rides like foam in just seconds. If there were more complex, interesting flavors going on here, this stage would be set for a wonderful exhibition. Not a bad beer overall, just unmemorable and pedestrian."
"Pours a light copper with dense fluffy head and light lacing. The smell is strange, almost beefy, like a grilled steak. The flavor is light, malty and biscuity, a whiff of slightly sour floral hops, with a little sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeel is light and insubstantial. The beer is Ok, sessionable perhaps, but it's drinkability is hurt by the weird smell and a slight sour unpleasant aftertaste."
"Bought this on a whim and I loved it. A perfect session beer.. very crisp and refreshing with my lasagna. More light bodied than heavy bodied and well balanced, it has a nice kick to it and goes down smooth. I'm glad I picked this one up out of nowhere.. much better than any other generic import out there."
"This brew poured a lt. froffy tan head with good lacing. I got tropical fruit and roasted chesnuts. This ale looks great in the glass,it has a nice blood orange color and a nonstop flow of tiny bubbles. The taste has roasted nuts and caramel that quickly fades into a spicy hop finish. The mouthfeel is med. body and leaves a soft baked grain aftertaste. The drinkabilty has a high score due to the fact this ale is only 5.1% abv. and this pale ale is well balanced and mighty tasty."
"Notes: Very good beer. Sessions are o.k with this one."
"Drinkability : an good beer in the style Belgian pale ale."
"Easily drinkable. This was hard for me to slow down. A good session beer."
"Highly drinkable beer. Not your usual Belgian beer. More English or American in style in my opinion."
"Pours a very transparent orange brown color with a medium sized wispy white head that leaves some sticking. Some funk, not farmhouse funk but bottle/machine funk in the nose. Other notes include standard lager malt and grassy euro lager bittering hops. Fruity malts arrive upfront first moving into a crisp but mild and balancing bitterness. Again the funk comes in just after the dry finish and lingers long on to the aftertaste. Light bodied and extremely drinkable."
"I had this with lunch at a cafe in Amsterdam, poured from the bottle into a Palm glass. The beer was clear and copper colored, with a sweet malty aroma. The taste was more malty than hopped, kind of caramel sweet. It tasted like a maibock with a little light fruit. Very refreshing and perfect with lunch."
"Overall, this is not the most complex Belgian I've ever had, but it was quite nice. It may be one of the most drinkable, though. I would definitely recommend this, but there are plenty of other things that would take priority for me"
"D - I could definitely drink a few of these in a row."
"This used to be my daily beer, I prefer it out of the bottle as to on tap. Very easy to drink, fruity caramel flavors that don't linger for too long. When poored into the older style goblets it's easy to get a really nice thick head on the beer. Very common beer in Belgium, most of any bar you walk into will cary it so it is not the most complex beer out there but certainly worth a try. It is sold in cans also but I only drink it like this out of desperation. Customs seems to let cans of beer slide when they are in international post packages."
"I had this beer on tap this evening @ Once and for all in Patchogue. This beer poured amber, slightly carbonated with a white head. The smell was one a belgian Ale (I am not totally educated on belgian beers so I can not always place the smells) The taste was nice, nicely malted but imo a run of the mill Belgian, nothing compared to the Chimay Tripel I tried before it. This beer feels nice in my mouth, not exactally something I would drink all night but it was an easy drinking beer."
"Poured from bottle into a Chimay glass an orange dark amber color with light bubbly white foam head that reduced slowly and left some spotty lacing. Mellow grassy smell and malts on the nose. Tasted of malts, caramel and sweet spicy hops. Was very easy drinking light/medium bodied with a crisp finish. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"Good mouthfeel, although it could've been a little thicker along with a good level of drinkability due to the modest 5.1% ABV..."
"This beer was served to me on draft in a goblet style glass. It had a light tan color, with a very soft aroma. It had a very light clean after-taste. I would consider this to be a rather social beer. Very light head retention. This beer did not taste strong, or hoppy at all."
"My first impression of this beer was mass-produced Euro amber beer. I don't know much about Palm, but being from Belgium I expected a bit more. There's a sweet bread/corn flavor that is a bit jarring. As the beer warms some of the subtleties with spices become present, but it's too little too late for my taste. Overall a sub par Belgian amber. I would skip this one."
"D: Not overly complex in the flavour and the mouthfeel gives good drinkability, nice but easily forgettable"
"D: This is an ok belgian beer, far from anything special, but easy to drink and it would make a good session beer. I would drink it again if offered but I wont be rushing back to the store to pick up some more."
"D: Good on the drinkablity scale. Not a bad beer, rather light and refreshing."
"From my notes 6/4/2007 on-tap - one-finger off-white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Malty nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is a mellow caramel with hops in the background, clean finish. 3.25 ($4.45) for a 330ml glass from Three Sisters Pub Amsterdam, NL."
"tastes fresh but not as fresh as the off-the-tap Steam Beer at Brewerkz."
"I've travelled there 3 times now, and have had Palm on a number of occasions, and it's better than a lot of alternatives."
"d: Very - crispness helps motivate the palate for some more. A session Belgian..."
"One of my wifes favourite beers, I like it too."
"Multiple cups at the Palm Open House in Steenhuffel on 9/10/06."
"Overall - An excellent and very quaffable ale.... nothing groundbreaking but certainly recommended..."
"The beer is a good, cheap purchase in BeNeLux, but i think i'll stick to other belgians with more character."
"I don't think I'd be up for drinking this one nonstop all night, but it sure is nice for a few bottles' worth. Maybe I can try to find this stuff on-tap while I'm here."
"Quite drinkable and a overal pleasant brew."
"This is a bit like a Bass without that Burton taste. Non offensive, easily drunk... not bad."
"D: Overall a good beer, even for a Macro brew... I would not choose to drink this one after a nice dinner, however to quench my thirst in the heat of the summer its a great choice."
"Handsome dark amber colour, moderate head. Pleasant gentle maltiness, understated hops, some spice. Good for washing down whatever you're eating."
"Inviting beer, next one please!"
"Hello big audience, goodbye beerlover!"
"Swett and lightly roasted aftertaste, with some bitterness. Well balanced. Even a fruity note, and a light vanilla."
"Had on tap at a hotel I stayed in in Nijkerk Netherlands. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered, I just saw the offering for Palm Special and knew I hadn't had it before. This beer was served in a Palm branded brandy snifter style glass. The amber liquid came topped with 1/2 inch of thick white head, which died down in the center. It was sticky and stayed on the sides of the glass as I was drinking. The low malty aroma carried over into the taste, which to me seemed to be of refined grainyness. More maltyness than hops. I enjoyed the tiny bubbles rising in the glass."
"New to the BC liqour stores this beer looks Belgian but smells and tastes Scottish. The nose wafts malts and the taste is slightly sweet big malts with with a nice hop balance. I could see this being a great session beer and food friendly to boot. Not a classic but rather an interesting take on a Scottish ale."
"Through a rather convoluted set of circumstances, managed to get a bottle brought back after a native of Belgium made a visit home. I think this is my first Belgian beer that was not what I typically think of as ""Belgian"" in character (i.e. characteristic yeast flavors). To me, this hit me as ESB-ish, and was quite good. Nice, bold hops with sturdy, toffee malt marching along in step. Lively carbonation - very drinkable."
"Slight nose of sweet caramel. Slight amber look in the goblet with a sticky white lasting head that settles to a sheen. The brew is sweet to the tongue very flat tasting and one dimentional. Medium feel on the palet with some carbonation on the tongue. Clean finish. An ok beer, but it did not impress me enough to want to seek it out in the future."
"But it is a beer with more taste than Coors... And a beer i could drink alot of. It has a weak smell too. It smells a little of bread. This is not a beer i have seen in Sweden, but when i see a bottle again i will buy it."
"Overall Impression: An average-to-good beer. It falls in line with the Belgian Pale Ale style, but in my opinion De Koninck is the star in that genre."
"Drinkability - All night long. I could throw down 12 of these no problem. 'Course, they're only quarter-liter bottles heh-heh, but this is a wonderful session beer."
"Rich looking, slightly hazy, amber colored brew. Lightly roasted malt, fruity pear-like aroma. Sweetish, fruity flavor with hints of spice. Quite good served cold as it sweetens as it warms. Medium bodied on the palette. Smooth and easy drinking. A nice medium strength Belgian brew."
