"Very nice beer indeed! Super tasty and one I would think would go great on a hot summer day by the pool."

"Overall pretty nice beer, nice base Belgian pale ale, good malt profile, very nice yeast profile with good esters, etc, hops are maybe the only downfall a bit, as it gets too spicy hop flavor and too bitter in general, too Americanized, but still enjoyable."
""
"The taste is pleasant with yeast and phenolic lightly fruity flavor with subtle spice in the taste which could be yeast or hop derived with light ripe banana-like aspect and hint of pepper with some alcohol and hop bitterness in the finish. Overall I was pleased it is a pretty drinkable belgian but average for the style ...decent beer but on the spicy side for me-almost strong golden strength with moderately high alcohol level (tastewise)"

"O- A little too dry for me. But I enjoy most of the mild characteristics in this."
""
""
"Given the above, I utilized a very gentle pour, resulting in naught but a skim of white foam for head that quickly dissipated like sea foam. Color was a brilliant Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4-5) with NE-quality clarity and it was my pleasure to invite my pards, Midas, Mammon and Croesus into my kitchen for a Christmas drink. The nose was, indeed, fruity, but I am uncertain that I would have said ""tropical."" Pineapple, maybe, but more of a malty-sweet sort of a nose. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The flavor had a definite black pepper-like spiciness, undoubtedly from the yeast. Warming, I also began to taste a fruitiness, but not sweet fruit, more towards a light tartness. Finish was semi-dry, with the fruity esters blending and offsetting the peppery dryness. This compares well with St. Bernardus' Extra 4, which is more aligned with my standing in the Order of Disorder. I am Bro. Woody, but 6 is Pater (Father), 8 is Prior (Priest) and 12 is Abt (Abbot) and I am CANtent as a lowly supplicant in the service of beer."

"Notes: Hazy golden body. Limited head and lacing (probably due to a dirty bar glass, because God knows the place where your paying for a clean glass is actually the last place you'll find one!). Floral, grass/straw, gently candyish malt, yeast, and mild citrus in the aroma. Flavor is fuller with more fruit: apple, grape, orange. Solid bitterness leads to a dry finish. Medium bodied and crisp. Well balanced. Probably easy to overlook this beer in todays market where flavors are SO pronounced."

"Spicy, earthy, and dry. Tastes like a brash, peppery saison."

"Along with their Capital Trail Pale Ale this is their best offering. Their flagship beer that they knocked out of the park from the get go. If you're a fan of Belgian style ales this one should be on your list to try."

"O: This beer really surprised me -- I had not liked their pale ale or cream ale too much, but this was one fine beer. Reminds me of a saison a lot, a little less estery though. A very interesting yeast character with a solid, spot-on pilsner maltiness dominating but accented with moderately peppery phenolics without overdoing it and nailing the feel. Great work on this one and I will be looking to buy more in the future."
""
"Poured a cloudy deep gold with a short-lasting fizzy white head. Nothing fluffy about it. No lacing. The aroma claims tropical fruit and spices, which might be there, but in portions so small I can't detect them. It smells like ""Singel"" if that were a generic aroma. The taste is equally stereotypical, lacking in the complexities the label claims. There is a fair bit of carbonation on the palate and a decent weight to the body, not too heavy or light. All in all, this is a good take on a Singel. Nothing stunning, but certainly not terrible."
""
""
"O-Nice easy drinking and well crafted Belgian Ale."
""
""
""
"O- a refreshing, yet complex Belgian pale that has high drinkability. A great take on a classic style!"

"o - Overall a pretty good Belgian. Nice bananas and spices throughout, and easy to drink. Worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is clear and golden with a small white head. the aroma brings Belgian yeast, light spice, a hint of alcohol. Simple and easy drinking. Not too sweet. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. A nice American representation of an abbey single. A few small tweaks and they could be onto something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wish this tasted a bit more like the nose, which was quite interesting. It turns out to me to be a decent replacement for an imported lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow. The noticeable yeast on this is pretty high and there is also quite a strong bit of lemon going on as well. This comes across as something that isn't typical for the style. But it does have a smooth feel on it and it's easy to drink. Not too bad really"

"Overall this is a nice BPA, a good beer for Hardywwod, however, I would put this one in the middle of the pack of their fleet of beer."
""
""
"For the price, you could go elsewhere and get more bang for your buck. Just an average domestic belgian pale.Pear notes, crisp finish, light esters. I look forward to trying others from Hardywood, but this was definetly on the average side. Not a sink pour because of cost, but will certainly pawn off at holiday parties"

"Poured a light golden body with good and head and thin lace on top of a yeasty, spicy, slightly sweet and hopped up aroma. Beer is light and smooth and has a bit of yeast bite to it. Some tropical fruits seem to come out, some a little wild as there is a spicy bitterness to beer. Also a touch of bready and sweet malt. Crisp finish although a little haggard. The flavors in the beer are good but are too muted at some points."
""
""
"O-nice malts flavors and balance in this BPA, well done and reasonably priced"
""
"o: a solid singel style ale, the malts are a little prominent for my liking and leave kind of a toasty/grainy feel, but a nice drink nonetheless"
"Overall, this is taste wise an ok example with out any problems, but it's really indistinct and nothing to get excited over, I'd rather have something with a bit more flavor, even if it is just a Belgian Pal Ale."
""
""
""
"Overall: Hardywood just goes from strength to strength in my book, mastering a broad range of styles; another fine brew that I could have mistaken for an Allagash or an Ommegang"
""
"Overall Impression: A great selection for a bitingly tasty drink with ample thirst quenching ability. Displaying typical Belgian pear/orange flavor with Belgian yeast but with more of a sturdy pale malt backbone. Would definitely suggest this beer to others."

"O: This one doesn't impress at first...until you realize that 2/3rds of the bottle was finished in about 10 minutes. The focus on pleasant subtlety over chest-thumping aggressiveness is something I can really appreciate here."

"6.5/10"
"Looks as one would expect: pale hazy yellow, moderate foamy head, effervescent. Smells about as good as it tastes, which in my opinion is not that great. The lemony hops and pungent yeast is an off putting combo, adding a conflicting dichotomy of both sweet and sour, with neither really blending well together."
"Simple yet intricate, with yeast nuances ... perhaps too much so? That would be our only gripe with this beer. The yeast dominates. In fact, it's a yeast bomb. Some taming would push this beer into the exceptional range. Regardless, a good stab at an Abbey-style Blonde Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent belgian blonde that was a little bit different then I'm used to having, but fairly enjoyable asides from the aroma. While this wasn't my favorite blonde, I'd definitely try it again but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
"Really, a fairly tame beer that's good but not great; but what does one want from a Belgian pale ale? Good beer."
""

"Bottle thanks to Matt. Served in a cervoise. Pours a fairly-clear golden color with a short white head. Nose has loads of pepper and just a touch of background floral hops. Flavor is likewise mostly pepper. Interesting if they didnâ€™t use pepper in this, as they really got some crazy stuff out of the yeast. Medium body. Somewhat crisp and dry. Just okay. One dimensional."
""
""
"I drank my taster and then immediately asked for a pint of Gingerbread Stout to get the taste out of my mouth. I won't try this again."
"Thanks to Steve for this one!"
""
""

""

"D - not bad, there is an odd note in the aroma, but the flavor comes together pretty well. I don't love it, but it is drinkable and a reasonably credible example of an obscure style."
"Overall: I really liked how Belgian this one is"
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body and sweet on the finish, the overall beer is fine but bland, grainy finish, mildly astringent. Not a repeat."
"O- My first offering from Hardywood is not disappointing, but then again, I'm not blown out of the water. This beer is enjoyable, just nothing over the top good."
"O - Hardywood Park's Singel is a very good example of the Belgian Pale Ale style and is an interesting and unique flagship for the young brewery. It's not quite world-class, but a great start. I look forward to checking out their other brews."
""
""
""
"O: As far as flagship beers go, this is a good one. I'm not typically a BPA fan, yet this is flavorful, complex and quaffable. I look forward to returning to this one in the not-too-distant-future."
""
""
"Overall, except for the heavy feel this is a pretty decent representation."
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow-gold with a moderate white head. Aroma is very nice, Belgian yeasts dominate and with a little bit of banana and a bit of a fruity aroma as well. Flavor follows the nose, with the Belgian yeasts and banana really coming forward at first. It's got a light, crisp fruitiness and then a bit of a hop bite at the finish. Very refreshing and drinkable. Mouthfeel is thin-medium bodied and just right for the style. Overall, this is a very tasty Belgian pale ale and a great flagship beer for an up-and-coming brewery. It's not incredible, but I would certainly have this one again."
""
""
"D: my only complaint, of few, would be to play around with a belgian yeast that didnt dry this out so much. wouldnt hate for a more lasting bitter linger. otherwise, totally crushable and well-made."
""
""
"O: A solid Belgian pale here. Could be a little bit more malt balanced, as the sweetness from the yeast and the thin bitterness from the hops produces a finish that leaves a little bit to be desired. However, this is light, refreshing, and enjoyable. A solid effort from a burgeoning brewery."

"I also met the owners today, and they were really cool. Brewery tries to be as green as possible and form bonds with the community in which it lives (Richmond). That's good news for Richmonders! Seems like they're always open to suggestions and ideas about beers to produce or ways to run the business."
"Over all I would say this is a great flagship beer for both Hardywook Park Craft Brewery and those wanting to learn more about beer, but not sure where to start."
""
"O: Overall a very nice beer. As you continue to drink it the bitterness softens a bit and the clove and banana become more pronounced. Overall I really like it."
""
""
"Overall, though, not a bad start."

"Had a sample of this at Capital Ale in Downtown Richmond a while ago and then just the other night at their Illumination party. It's a fairly standard Belgian ale that's very drinkable. I'm more of an IPA and stout kind of person, but would enjoy this in the summertime. Comparable to an Ommegang or Allagash quality beer. Keep it up Hardywood! Glad to see VA get some more breweries."
"O - This is a unique choice for Hardywood Park's flagship beer, but they have done a nice job to make this an easy drinking and refreshing Belgian Blonde. Though it is 6.2% ABV, the lighter body and tasty flavor allow this to be a sessionable type beer. I look forward to having more of this beer, especially in the warmer months of the year."
"O: One of the better examples of an American version of a Belgian beer. Very easy to drink."
"I agree with the BA categorization of this as a BPA; somehow 'Singel' isn't consistent with what I imagine in terms of taste, nor alcohol content. It's not a 'B-IPA' though; if it were, I'm not sure I could forgive it, but pardon my digression, that's a dogmatic debate. Any hop character is in the finish. A good first effort for a new brewery; I'm curious to see how this recipe develops, and to try other brews by Hardywood."
""

"This new brewery (Hardywood Park) has just opened in my hometown, Richmond, Va., and I am looking forward to seeing their Singel proliferate and become the daily swill of our town's growing beer-smart public. It's very good beer."
"My opinion on belgian style brews is pretty uninformed.. but i really liked this beer.. call me a homer if you will but I thought it was a great example of the style and it is my fav belgian style thus far. the only other BPA I have had was from Ommegang"
"Overall, I'm very, VERY impressed with Hardywood Park Craft Brewery so far. Their Singel is a great beer and their Farmhouse Pumpkin is a wonderful example of what a pumpkin ale should strive to be. I'd give the Singel a 4.5 out of 5 overall, and I hope that people give Hardywood a try in the near future!"
"Overall I was very impressed and look toward to more from hardywood park."
"Overall, this is a very refreshing drink, would make a nice lawnmower beer, in moderation."
