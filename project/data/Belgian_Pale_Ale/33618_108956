Spicy, Belgian yeast notes on the aromas, with some nice dark fruit and even citrus notes shining through. Classic flavors of a Belgian pale from my admittedly limited experiences. Reminded me a bit of GI Sofie. The nice citrus notes and peppery bite on the finish had me anxiously taking the next sip. Nice clean finish with some of the lingering yeast notes fading away. A nice buy. US monks, supporting charity, delicious= multi-level winner.","Mikus","Sunday at 06:13 AM"

If this was an American Pale Ale expectations would be lower, but every other Trappist ale has been perfectly balanced with no bitterness on the finish. Considering it is a American brewed beer, the hoppiness and higher ABV is not surprising.  As a final insult, the bottle was only 11.2 ounces and cost $6. This is acceptable for an imported beer, but give me a break, it is brewed in Massachusetts, why not 12 ounces?","wattoclone","Mar 15, 2015"

Very cloudy, bottle stood up for days and carefully poured still yields a great deal of particulate in the liquid, warm red glow at the core but mostly a bright orange, color of pink grapefruit pulp, nothing remarkable about the visible carbonation. The nose offers biscuit crumbs, pepper, meadow grasses and earth, clove spice, the orange to lemon citrus pierces the nostrils well and allows for more flow in the attenuated apricot, apple fruit, definitely more lingering banana notes. Full-bodied, in large part due to the fluffy expansion coming from the carbonation. Lees, whipped cream, clove and caraway seed, dried honey, less peppery here. The citrus is indistinct in terms of flavors but a large presence nonetheless. Overall, the profile is too dry for you to get a lot of banana or bubblegum but they are there. Apricot, pear, green melon fruit of moderate ambition. The finish is tactful even as that active carbonation extends the mouth feel. Pleasant to sip.","farrago","Mar 03, 2015"

Aromas of banana, clove, cream, and toasted grains. Pretty simple, but impressively balanced. The flavors are roasted and rich forward, with banana bread notes, heavy clove spicing, some nutmeg notes, a sweet and tangy cream overlay, and a toasted grain backbone. Subtle yeast funk throughout, with some fruity esters, too. The body is light and dry, and remains crisp throughout due to the carbonation. Banana and spice blend in the aftertaste, with a short-lived linger, kept clean by the carbonation once again, providing a crisp, clean finish. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 24, 2015"

The smell was full of Belgian wheat giving the smell of bananas and herbs like sage. The taste was full of mint, sage, and banana giving a classic Belgian ale flavor that was very well done. The mouthfeel was also very nice with a medium body which worked with the flavors very well. Really enjoyed this one.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 06, 2014"

The experience was a rare treat. I was overwhelmed by the light yeasty aroma . I thought I could smell a light citrus or almost clove smell. A beautiful amber, cloudy color.The taste was superb- dry, and better than any other Belgian I've tried. I found my way to a local Spirits shop where I bought two cases to take home. This my friends, will be an ale that will be around for the ages.","Collins","Jul 14, 2014"

I first heard about this beer from a friend, so on a recent trip to Massachussetts I picked up a four pack from a store and tried it. I did not have the preferred glass, so I poured it into a pint glass which was, of course, a little big. The smell was pleasant but not perfect with a quite malty aroma, but what really hit me was how smooth yet robust the mouth feel was. It was a real pleasure to taste, and I found myself lingering on each sip before swallowing, trying to catch all the flavors, as there were quite a few I hadn't tasted in a beer before. Something in it reminded me of the peaty flavors of an Islay Scotch. In any case, a quite enjoyable beer, even for someone like me who's generally leans more towards the more hoppy varieties.","veryseldon","Mar 14, 2014"

This beer is not a bludgeon, like so many at this price level; and if you don't pay some mind, you might mistake it as too easy going for the expense paid.

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with this; I think I was expecting an abbey ale with deep red color and fig or plum flavor...I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. This is truly a unique beer that was crafted with care. The intense banana aroma and flavor are a testament to the particular yeast strain that they so graciously gift to us in the bottle. Will definitely buy again.","ThreeLions","Feb 08, 2014"
3.71,-7.9,3.25,3.5,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Summary: Compared to the other authentic Trappist beers I've tried, this has a more subdued flavor - it is not as rich or strong as say a Rochefort or the Gregorius, but that's probably because it is not a Tripel, Quad or Strong Ale. This beer fits my stereotype of a Belgian ale, although certainly better than most I have tasted. An immediate comparison to an Allagash White comes to mind, but again, this is much better. It has a sweetness to its taste with a smell of cloves and banana? (I really don't know what cloves smell like.) It is not a strong smell, but definitely fruity I guess. The carbonation is the strongest of any Trappist beer I have imbibed (that word courtesy of my more intelligent wife). It has a great finish and leaves a very nice lingering flavor, albeit a bit dry. Overall, considering it's alcohol strength, it is great for what it is. However, for what it is, the price of a 4-pack is steep. I do hope the Spencer Brewery comes out with other brews as it would be interesting to see them take on stronger styles.","kbrokhoff","Feb 07, 2014"
4.19,4,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Spencer Trappist Ale is a well-crafted rendition of a Belgian pale ale that had many similar characteristics to a stronger Belgian ale. Although I really enjoyed this, at $18 a four-pack I doubt I will be drinking it very often.","Damian","Feb 07, 2014"
3.88,-3.7,4,4,3.75,3.75,4,"Pours a short foamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. Golden orange in color with light carbonation. Smell is instantly recognizable as Trappist with a lot of pepper, clove and rock candy. Taste is surprisingly mellow compared to what the nose indicates. Light and fluffy with a just touch of pepper and clove. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. The body doesn't stick around long. Overall very enjoyable. This would be a terrific ale to sip on the porch on a warm summer night. However, the price point makes it a bit more of an occasional indulgence.","BastardFromABasket","Feb 07, 2014"

3.95,-2,3.5,4,4,3.25,4.25,"The beer pours a deep orange with amber highlights, like a morning sunrise. A head of gently-off-white bubbles forms above the beer, settling around a quarter of a finger’s width above the glass, and then quickly fizzling away to just a scrim. The bubbles leave a mildly thick lacing that draws its fingers up the sides of my glass, but I wish they would stick around a little longer. In body, the beer is opaque and hazy, with little to nothing coming through from the other side of the glass. There are, however, no visible particles floating around within the beer. On the nose, the beer is distinctly of Trappist origins, with the potential to also be considered a hefeweizen… Big fruity esters and phenols lather the nose in thick banana scents, like a banana smoothie; hints of pineapple can also be sensed, and touches of spicy clove and other phenols can be felt in the nostrils. Subtle bread scents do dance as ghosts in the background of the nose, but really this beer is all about the fruity esters and spicy phenols of the yeast. There does seem to be a touch of spicy booze as well, which may just be me mistaking the esters for booze, but if not then it is a little odd for the ABV. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and fruity with funky esters and spicy phenols, the middle and finish bring in a nice balancing spicy bitterness that mellows into herbal hops that are just a touch strong. Acidity also pops the mouth in the beginnings of the sip, leaving a light pucker in the lips. In flavor, the beer is again all about its yeast character. Spicy banana and pineapple smoothie molds into rich phenol clove, spice, and perhaps just a touch of Band-Aid. The finish brings out more herbal spices, mingling with herbal and grassy hops to give the beer a nice balance, though it still remains a touch too sweet, making the bitterness and spice a little harsh. The finish is a little quick for what I want it to be, but does leave a nice aftertaste of pineapple and banana esters. In the mouth, the beer feels rather odd. In body it is somewhere in the medium range, with a touch of watery thinness at its close, but in mouthfeel, the beer is thick and creamy with a touch of chewiness as well. There is a tug on the sides of the cheeks as the beer passes through the mouth, giving the beer a light grip, and the acidity certainly bites at the tongue, even after the beer has left, leaving the cheeks wet with spittle and the tongue slightly numb with spice and bitters. The mouthfeel still needs a little work in my humble opinion. Overall, I am intrigued and impressed. It is no easy task to simply step into the venerable ranks of the Trappist Breweries. Some of the highest rated beers in the world come from these breweries, but I believe Spencer has built a strong foundation to quickly catch up to its European brethren. They need to work on the head retention of the beer, for starters, and the mouthfeel and is bit off, which hurts the beers drinkability, though it does make it ideal for pairing with food. I also would like less harsh spice/bitters from the yeast and hops, and a little more of a blending of the sweet, spicy, and bitter characteristics. I wouldn’t really call this a table beer, either, as its ABV and overall body are a bit much, but it would certainly do well on a table. This beer is excellent, however, and I am just nitpicking because it is joining such an elite class of breweries. This is a fine start for the monks in Spencer, MA!","Maxwell","Jan 21, 2014"

This is the first authentic Trappist beer made in America, and its simplicity and understated complexity perfectly reflect the context in which it was brewed. The beer just exudes a sense of peace and tranquility. This is the perfect companion to a simple cheese plate. A nice tame Brie with apple or pear slices drizzled with honey and a slice of crusty bread. Sometimes it's the simple things in life that are the most rewarding.","ryan1788a5","Jan 20, 2014"

A high quality Belgian blonde, it pours with a nice head and a big scent of bananas. A little too much carbonation, but the malts and spices are blended perfectly. This ale is Christmas in a bottle, serve it with fish or chicken and enjoy.","Umbagog","Jan 20, 2014"

Like I mentioned before I have been waiting a very long time for this, and it's finally here, and is able to remind me of being in Belgium, so a nice beer at that. very drinkable, a bit too wheaty, but still tasty, everything well balanced, a nice spring or summer beer for sure. I hope they bring a quad or big beer at some point.","jlindros","Jan 20, 2014"

3.79,-6,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,"Got to try this early. It poured the color of hay with a nice, clean white head. The aroma and taste were what you would expect from a tripel: banana, clove, and yeast. It was more highly carbonated than I was expecting, quite prickly on the tongue. It was easy drinking and quite refreshing. I look forward to drinking it again when it gets released in just over a week. Don't know how much buzz there is about the first American Trappist beer but the monks at St. Joseph's have produced a swell little beer here.","TobiasG","0"
