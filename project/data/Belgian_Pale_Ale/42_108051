Aroma is bready with notable citrus and floral contributions from the hops. Mouthfeel is dry and somewhat watery. Taste is dominated by an upfront Belgian yeast character and followed by citrus hop flavored and a lingering bitterness. As a pale ale I would say this misses the mark, in the context of a Belgian inspired, dry-hopped ale, this is a good example.","grammodesguapote","Nov 17, 2014"

Aroma is a pleasant burst of fresh citrus, with grapefruit, orange and lemon zest, mango and a bit of grassiness and floral hops. You can nearly taste the citrusy goodness. The taste is similar, with some tangy lemon and orange zest and a bit of citrus hops. The yeast and wheat slowly poke their head in, revealing the interesting nature of this semi-crossover beer. The floral notes are quite noticeable, and pair nicely with the kick from the combination of zest and hops. Nothing too complex going on here. The citrus hops come through a bit more as it warms, creating a very pleasant sweet citrus aftertaste. Par for the style, high carbonation. A bit watery. Very easy to drink. Mouth wateringly refreshing. Overall all a pretty good brew from a brewery that I don't seem to be as big of a fan as everyone else. I hope this one will help me change that!","majorbase2","Oct 19, 2014"

Having lived an hour from Ommegang for quite some time, we always actively seek out every one of their new releases. This beer reminded us of just how incredible they are as premier brewers. The base beer is full, warming, and hearty, but what makes it fantastic is the thick layer of oily, organic hoppiness that they float overtop of it. The interplay between the decidedly Belgian malt bill and yeasty zest with the fresh floral and bitterly soapy hoppiness is both highly enjoyable and thoroughly refreshing. This was the best beer of a long night of tasting, and something we hope they will continue to stock. This is Ommegang’s most memorable in recent memory, and should encourage them to keep their hop game evolving.","TheBrewo","Jul 28, 2014"

Smells of strong citrus and grapefruit peel. Definitely smells dry-hopped and lives up to the "Hop House" name. The taste is a solid Belgian pale, with a nice yeasty spice and a strong hop character. Tropical and citrus notes. The beer is very crisp and refreshing. Really great brew and a bit different from the rest of Ommegang's lineup. Definitely has the core of a Belgian ale with the American hoppyness and I really like it. It is exactly what it claims to be and I have to give props for that. I would classify this more as an IPA than pale ale however.","benloho","Beers"

Just plain boring, bitterness not balanced well and the high hop content doesn't really mesh well with the other flavors in the beer. I honestly took two sips and poured it out. When Ommegang focused on a few solid beers, they were untouchable, but now they are trying to be all things to all people and I think their products are suffering. I'm sure they don't want to brew Hennepin or Rare Vos all day every day, but the difference with those beers and this one is they are delicious","SpecialPatrolGroup","Jun 25, 2014"

A big bubbly layer remains once the bulk of the head subsides. Sticky patches all around the glass.... Aroma is loaded with juicy grapefruit, lemon-lime, floral, banana pudding, and a soft dusting of coriander spice. Mouthwateringly forward fruit. Taste is very Belgian IPA. Sweet white bread grains, lemon, grapefruit rind, touch of passionfruit, creamy banana, zesty spice, and hop bitterness mingled with festive carbonation. Dry, brisk, very lightly resinous, and still creamy smooth. Overall a very nice Ommegang Belgian spliced with an IPA.

I get a whiff of brett, possibly. Flavor has some bready maltiness and toasty grains up front. The hops come in full force with long-lasting bitterness. Hops bring some herbal and grassy flavors. Overall more bitter than aromatic. Body is moderate, with lively carbonation. I would kind of like this to be lighter on the tongue.

Aroma has citric earthy herbal hops, bitterness is almost caught by your nares...expressive bready/biscuit malts to complement not much in the way of perceived sweetness seems like a beautifully constructed Belgian pale ale. Just a touch of citrus/mango juicy hop character going on here. Flavors combine nicely herbaceous herbal hops, bitter citrus peel, lemony notes with a spicy black pepper blast the yeast spiciness kicks hard I don't know how to keep the yeast out of this glass it seems like part of the dry-hopped BPA experience. Mouthfeel has smooth effervescent carbonation light to medium bodied a touch of slick hop oils all very enjoyable along with that bone dry finish.

Aromas of big lemon zest, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, pear, light banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, light bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, yeast ester, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, pear, light banana, clove, pepper, light bubblegum, floral, grass, bread, cracker, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spice and floral hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, pear, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of hop, yeast ester, and moderate malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian IPA. All around good balance and complexity of hop, yeast ester, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

I think people completely miss the point of a Belgian Pale and expect it to be an American pale, like Flying Dog Raging Bitch which is just an American IPA as there is no Belgian note at all in it.

The smell was hoppier than any other Ommegang beer I recall having, but not quite hopped up enough to be in IPA territory. There was a distinct yeast presence evident in the smell, and it was cleared in the taste in the form of banana, and white pepper. The hops were there in the taste, but more like a spice, than a dominating element. The body was however a lot thinner than I would have liked, as the hop flavors seemed fleeting due to it. What lingered in the aftertaste was candi sugar, and more of the yeast. Drawing properly from the Belgian tradition and American adventurousness, although it's a lot closer to the Belgian roots than others that have ventured this way.","rajendra82","Mar 09, 2014"

While I believe that Ommegang can do no wrong, I will quietly disregard this beer as an attempt to satisfy the misguided American palate which seems to believe that beer begins and ends with the advent of the IPA.","SoupKitchenBeerSnob","Feb 20, 2014"

4.02,6.6,4.25,4,4,4,4,"This Belgian pale ale shows a nice clear amber gold with a muscular snow white head and lots of puffy lacing. The aroma brings a clean grassy wheat hop that is very refreshing and hits a definitive floral quality as well. Delicate but sure. The flavor follows suit with a crisp grass but a gentle floral sweetness to balance this into something much more commendable than the previous reviews generally recognize. It's pretty simple but I love it. Born to be served cold and probably best enjoyed in the heat of the summer months this brew captures some bready grain with tasteful hops that will clearly satisfy the hop cravings of most hop heads like me. The body is pretty much light but it delivers a high carbonation that makes for a very refreshing, crisp feel. I really like this concoction and hope it will be available during the summer months ahead.","Durge","Feb 04, 2014"

3.84,1.9,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a pretty good example of a hoppy Belgian style Pale Ale, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style when It came to the aroma, but when I got to the taste I found it to not be as bright and vibrant as the aroma was. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little refreshing, not too filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these but I might want to switch it up after that and I think it would make for a nice beer to enjoy in the spring time. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very nice and i liked how fruity and vibrant it was. What I liked the least about this beer was that that the taste wasn't more like the aroma, it just seemed a little too light and dull after that really nice aroma. I might buy a couple more bottles of this, but i'm not in any hurry and I would recommend it to anyone who likes hoppy Belgian Style Pale Ales. All in all I liked this beer, but I don't think it had that special something to set it apart and make it really memorable. I like the idea of a hoppy Belgian Pale Ale and I think that the citrus hops can work really nice with the Belgian Yeast. This isn't my favorite Ommegang beer and It's not my favorite Belgian Pale Ale. Nice work guys, this beer was pretty solid, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Feb 03, 2014"

4.06,7.7,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a two finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of citrus hops, mixed citrus juice and tropical fruit, bready malt and hints of Belgian spicing. Flavor is biscuit malt, citrus hops, light stone and tropical fruit, light Belgian yeast and spicing. Medium bodied. An interesting Belgian / American hybrid, with the hoppy pale ale taking the forefront, but with nice Belgian yeast character in the background. An interesting converse of a Belgian IPA with the Belgian character at the fore. There is an interesting earthy, peppery flavor in the finish that is probably clove interacting with the hops. A very nicely made pale ale with interesting flavors from both inspiring styles. I enjoyed this a lot.","LiquidAmber","Feb 01, 2014"

The label offers a smattering of pairing suggestions, including pizza and burgers. I disagree. This is not a pizza or burger beer. At least not under normal circumstances. Some sort of creative 'artisan' pizza or burger maybe. I can see it meshing well with an arugula laden salad.","ryan1788a5","Jan 27, 2014"

The aroma was actually pretty good, but when I got the first sip onto my palate, it was defintely not for me. I actually picked up an overwhelming taste of cloves and I cannot stand cloves. It was such an overpowering taste that I had to give it away. If you are not a fan of cloves stay away. If you are a fan of cloves you might really enjoy this beer.","centurian62","Jan 26, 2014"

3.84,1.9,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Pours clear. yellowish golden with a nice white head. Aroma offers some cloves from the spicy belgian yeast, some citrus and its rind, and some cracker from what I figure comes from a decent dose of pilsner malt. Flavor pretty much follows suit but the general citrus is a more distinct lemon and orange I found. A crisp, light active mouthfeel. Overall, nothing innovative or unique about this beer. Just a very nice, well constructed, highly drinkable Belgian ipa. Would definitely drink again, I dug it.","denver10","Jan 20, 2014"

It’s exceedingly easy to drink, with an excellent aroma, appearance, feel, and very good flavor, but it feels like they dialed back the spice and yeast character of BPA and emphasized the hop notes, swapping noble hops for more American-ish ones. Either way, I really do dig this beer. Now I just want to try it super-super-fresh, and/or with an alternate dry-hop regimen.","fmccormi","Jan 16, 2014"

3.94,4.5,3.75,4,4,4,3.75,"This pours a handsome bright yellow with an amber depth. Hazy and has plenty of yeast floating around in it that settle to the sides of the glass. A luscious thick head of white foam that is slow to fall and leaves fantastic lace. Nose is bright and fruity. Tropical pineapple, orange and lemon. Citrus peel and a nice little bit of honey to sweeten all that a little more. As it warms a some spice notes come out on the nose. Taste is dry and delicate with a traditional belgian bearing. It has that farmhouse dryness but no astringency. The fruits are not as well defined on the palate and fall back to an overall fruity and floral character with a good spice that develops later in the drink. It finishes dry and palate cleansing with a nice long after taste and a surprising bitter. The bitter on this while it won't knock you down is surprisingly strong. This is a classic belgian style pale ale and the dry hopping has given it a keen lightness. Bit of pepper in the finish too. Very good.","utopiajane","Dec 22, 2013"
