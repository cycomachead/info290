"O:  hits the right notes for the style with a tart citrus theme augmented by a bit of sweetness here and there ... all the hop characteristics are in the flavor -- there's little to no bitterness.  a good brew and solid attempt at a Belgian style that can be subtle and nuanced"
""
"This is an easy drinker; low ABV by Weyerbacher standards. Open and pour and it smells like the Visitor's Center."

"07/25/13  On tap. At Rattle N Hum, NYC. Unique bittersweet pucker at first taste. Distinct pale ale characteristics. Some spice, but I can't pick them out of the line-up. Regardless this is a superb brew, mystery notwithstanding."

"O: not a bad beer, though not exactly what I anticipated... the more you get into it, the more you recognize a characteristic Weyerbacher flavor - in part that sort of nut-shell, toasted-wood thing that I just recently noticed in their barleywine... interesting enough to try out once (in awhile)"
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer."

"Taste starts with assertive and dry yeast, moving to white pepper and clove. Then banana, orange peel, lemon, and sour apple in the middle, with a dry, yeasty, slightly citric, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is light with very high carbonation, a touch of graininess."

"Overall: I bought a 6 pack of this beer and it took me until the last one to win me over. Yeast makes the beer here and it has a nice sweet taste. I would have it again."

""
"O: Another solid offering from Weyerbacher. They hit the basics bang on, but there isn't quite enough 'zing' to make this a stellar example of the style. Still, I'd drink it again."
""
""
""
"Overall: This poor bastard is yet another example of how poorly this style ages. I love that there are breweries out there making beers like this, but an “Enjoy By” date should be front and center. This embarrassment of a beer does not represent the style or the brewery with any class. It’s too bad (2.5/5)."

"O: Pleasant, aromatic Belgian pale ale with prominent yeast flavor. Somewhat displeasing bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer just doesn't do it for me. Leaves alot to be desired and is over powered by a Belgian yeast that I do not find pleasant. Over whelming in the taste and does not leave the mouth with a good finish."
""
""
""
"Nothing fantastic here, but a solid pale ale that is awfully easy drinking for a 6.9% ABV"

"O: OK for the style, straightforward. Tastes like a Belgian beer without the dryness or thinner body of a tripel."
""
"Lovely to behold in the glass with an head the color of aged plaster. Lots of lace on the sides and a decent retention and fade. A dusky orange fluid that has just a touch of cloudiness. Smell has lots of Pilsner malt and Belgian candi sugar, Hops are spicy and well developed but not overpowering. A touch of alcohol that leads to a spicy, peppery quality. Taste is superb with a big malt body that unfolds the layers of the grains in a delicious bready showcase. Candi sugar adds a refined sweetness and the hops are a wonderful surprise with an American persona. Feel is supple with a velvet carbonation and swallow. Superior drinkability makes me wish I had a bigger growler."

"Overall: A nice BPA in my opinion. The yeast strain is a nice characteristic to the beer."
"O: True Belgian quality and character (allowing for some American hops) in an ale from Pennsylvania. [4.25]"
"This pours a hazy dirty copper color with a lingering off-white head. The scent is sort of yeasty mix with bananas. The taste starts off kind of sweet with lots of malt and banana flavors. As the flavors progress it turns into this yeasty, bread taste that finishes a little chalky with hints of caramel left behind. Quite smooth and refreshing making this a pretty decent brew."
""
""
"Overall: this is a very good, almost great Belgian ale, very balanced and really tasty. I enjoyed the fresh growler fill more than I remember from the bottle. Belgian singles can get too yeasty at times ( in my opinion), this does a great job of being incredibly drinkable , and tasty. Give it a try if you find it. The Weyerbacher Tap Room is always a good place to taste it. "
"O: Solid Belgian Pale Ale."
""
""
""
"O- A very average beer. I've had it a couple times when it was around but probably won't go back again. Nothing terrible but nothing particularly good or interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured orange in color, but was not cloudy or hazy at all pretty clear. Nose is light coriander and clove notes, but not much else going on. Taste is syrupy and bitter, not hoppy or very spicy. Spices are trying to come out but they don't really make it. Syrupy bitterness lingers on in the mouth, not very refreshing. This may have been an old bottle."
"Overall: A damn good BPA. Very imaginative. Love the citrus and yeast. Really left a lasting impression on me. I will have this again for sure."
""
""
""
"Beautiful orange color; served in a glass. Not much of a flothy head. Wonderful aroma, nice feel and taste, a little bit strong aftertaste. Very similar to my favorite beer, Stella Artois however, packed with more flavor. Will buy this again. It was highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verboten pours a hazy burnt orange, with some gentle lighter orange highlights. There's only about a finger of bone colored foam sitting atop the beer. The nose is highlighted by some pleasant esters. Aromas of granny smith apples and white wine grapes waft out of the glass, offset by a dash of clove. The flavor profile starts off with a similar nice fruity notes. Phenols assert themselves a bit more here on the back end than in the smell, and unfortunately they move past clove and have a bit of a medicinal unpleasantness to them. The body is maybe just a little full for the style, but that's a minor issue. A little bit more of a concern is the noticeably dull carbonation, it's not nearly lively enough for a good Belgian ale. Verboten isn't anywhere near being an unpleasant beer, it just misses the mark a bit for the style."

"Not a bad beer, but a bit simple. It has decent flavor and drinkability. I probably won't pick this up again, but I'm glad I tried it once."

""
""
""

"The taste begins the same as the smell but doesn't have any staying power. There is a small bitterness towards the end. Light and easy drinking. Not great but good and I will be picking up more on one of my future visits to the brewery."
"This was a nice, well balanced, flavorful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a well-balanced beer that is quite drinkable. It has it all, bitterness, sweetness, and beautiful color, and just the right amount of spices to get you back for more."
"Overall: A nice representative of the style which seems to be sweeter than others I have had. Drinkability is good."
""
""
"O-The nose is great but everything after that is a let down. Still a good beer though."
"Notes: Not too bad it's very drinkable. Cheers."
"Pours a deep blood orange, with a thin lace head around the top of the glass. Hazy with a fair amount of visible carbonation. Smells of orange peels, banana bread, original flavored bubble gum. Light grain, banana, clove on the tongue piny hops, slight metalic taste on the finish. Crisp, and light ont the mouthfeel. Overall not too bad, nothing really too exciting either, highly drinkable."
""
""
"O: Liked this one a good bit actually. Easy drinking with a fruit forward flavor profile."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a reddish rust amber with a medium lasting tan head. Aroma and Taste of banana, biscuit malt, sweet spicy fruit, some yeast and citrus piney hops. Palate is medium body, crisp mouthfeel and good carbonation. Finish is biscuit malt, spicy fruits, yeast with a citrus piney hops ending. Overall a good, crisp and quality BPA."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a huge, long lasting white head. Aroma is of caramel, candy sugar, ripe fruit, yeast and hints of hops. Body is medium and smooth. Caramel malt, yeast, candy sugar, ripe fruit, and good amount of herbal hops fill the mouth. Finish is long, earthy. Not bad, but for some reason expected more from this brew."
""
"Quite drinkable. Enjoying this very much on a sunny afternoon."
""
"A nice tasty and fairly complex beer. No real alcohol presence and pretty enjoyable. I would buy again for certain, good without being over the top. A nice beer!"
"Strong aroma is fruity and yeasty with a hint of butterscotch. It pours a hazy, barely translucent solar yellow with a very thick and rather persistent cumulus-fluffy white head. Flavor has a fruity core, a mix of per and apple, with a firm yeasty tone and hints of butterscotch and grass plus a not exactly subtle bitter nip. Firm, smooth texture has well-rounded body and quite a bit of fizz. Don’t forbid this from your beer selection!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it was as expected for an American Belgium Pale ale and even more tasty if you can find a case which is under 30 bucks."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this brew is easy to drink but a bit too well rounded to make a point. Not a hop-head's dream Belgian PA. I won't call it boring because it's well crafted and gets more interesting as it warms up. There's a lot to be said for its easy-going drinkability, but it *will* be ""forbidden"" from future purchases, so I can concentrate on styles that are more my favorites."
""
""
""
""
"O- Very happy I grabbed a 6-pack. Not exactally my thing, but I'm sure alot will love it. Too much white grape juice for my liking. Nice and spicy and fruity tho. I'll try it again next year!"
"O: Perfect for the spring time, as well as in the summer, I'm sure. A solid American-styled BPA. Glad they made this year-round"
"Nothing incredibly exciting with this beer, but it is a solid and very drinkable Belgian pale. Very enjoyable on a warm spring day, definitely recommended."
""
""
"Pretty good Belgian effort. Served at a good temperature with a modest to small off-white head and some lace. Color is a slightly hazy brown amber. Aroma is close to a hefeweizen- spicy, bananas, bread dough. Flavor is like nose, nicely balanced as a result of carbonic tang and the the other factors. Body is appropriate and well executed. Finish is like flavor, has good length, and yields a desire for another sip. Good Brew!"
"O - I really enjoy Verboten because it has all the flavors I am looking for in a Belgian Pale Ale, while maintaining great drinkability. I have had just about every Weyerbacher beer and this continues to be the one I turn to most regularly. It doesn't have the highest ratings on this site, but I love the stuff."
""
""
"D: im really glad this brew is bottle conditioned. adds a zest to the fruity flavors that is much appreciated. the hops are there, but are slightly overwhelmed with the yeast. the malt body provides enough of a backbone to make it work. overall a pretty tasty bel pale."
""
"Pours a hazy blonde with a touch of sediment and a small white head. Nose is strong and a mix of bananas, Belgian yeast and citrusy hops. Flavor is surprisingly complex, front is mostly floral and bitter hops that come out strong, and the flavor shifts to banana and a funk/tanginess that goes well with the carbonation (which is quite high). Finish is clean and keeps a touch of banana lingering without over doing it.Another Solid brew from Weyerbacher"
""
"A simple easy to enjoy good and basic version of the style. Drinkability is fairly solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin medium body, slightly lower carbonation, feels a bit weak and watery. Drinkable and pretty refreshing, but there's definitely some better examples of the style around."
""
""
"Belgian flavors are there but lie beneath a rather unique hop profile. Big flavor for a smaller brew."
""
""
""

"O - This is a really tasty Belgian Pale Ale. Another great brew from Weyerbacher."

""
""
""
""
"Pours a cream, five-finger head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Almost clear amber color, with yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Pine hops and caramel nose and flavor is almost balanced pine hops and caramel but the hops win - too hoppy for a Belgian pale. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good pale ale. The flavors are very nice, especially as it warms. I would try it again."
""
""
"Fruity nose right when the cap is popped, and pours out a weathered golden hue with good lacing to boot. Herbal, salty and minty, with mango, musk and lemon zest in the aroma. Smooth yet bitty; creamy but with a bitter pull. Yeasty with a semi-pungent, phenolic herbal tone. Bitterness dials in pretty high. Fruity but dulled by the bitterness, the al- cohol shows a slight warmth. Phenols want to be on top; bitter semidry finish. Intensely complex with an in-your-face bitterness and a new flavor around every corner. Quite enjoyable."

"D: This combination of two styles I like is worked together in harmony and makes for an exceptional belgian pale ale. It is easy to drink and so flavorful yet not overpowering on the palate and a lower level of alcohol makes it easy to want a few in a row."

"Taste of a darker brew..maybe a quad. Tastes malty, sweet, a bit of hops. Lots of flavor. Its a very good brew. A nice ""session"" beer by Weyerbacher, who normally makes some high ABV brews. So it nice to be able to drink a few."
"Overall, I really like this brew, solid belgian style pale ale and one I'll look for again on draft."
"O - Overal, this beer wasnt that bad. Wish there had been a nice head to it or something but still, not bad."
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink and a good representation of the style."
"O- A perfect example of a solid BPA that's not too in-your-face. It's beginning to seem like these guys don't make bad beer or even subpar beer."
"This beer tries so hard to be straight out of the trappist books, and I'll have to say that it does a really good job. It just doesn't come full on as you'd hope. It lacks a little of the bready-yeasty flavor that really makes the trappist beers unique, but it's a great shot from something on this side of the Atlantic."
"O - This is actually the Zotten rather than the Verboten, which I randomly picked up at my local shop. I'm guessing this is aged about 2 years by now since it was recalled sometime early 2010. Not sure what flavors would fade in that time, but it's still very good. Simple, yet balanced, and varying between aroma and taste."
"I usually like the beers that Weyerbacher puts out, but unfortunately, this one is a total miss for me. I don't prefer the phenolic yeasty flavors in general, and this one dials it up a few notches."
"Overall: A good autumn to early winter beer. Well balanced flavors and mouthfeel provide an excellent sipping beer."
"Poured an amber color with a slight haze, and a moderately-lacing white head. Bready, yeasty aroma, with fragrant fruit notes, slightly phenolic, but tolerable at that. Similar taste: bready, spicy Belgian yeast, pears, apple skins, with a drying hop sensation following. Medium body, a bit chewy, and nicely drinkable. Not something I'd go out of my way for though."
"I can't really complain after trying this brew. The aroma had some complexity to it and then you take a sip and have a nice surprise from the unexpected finish. My only real nitpick if I must(and I must) is the appearance. The head just disappeared on me(which may be my own fault). Regardless, I can easily see myself getting another 6-pack or recommending this to friends."
"This is an enjoyable drink. Holds Belgian qualities in a lighter body and easier drinking drink. The rest of the bottles will be easy to consume."
"The aftertaste of honeysuckle, spices, and wheaty grains has a whisp of evaproative taste that extends into the next sip. All culminates in a sweeter and less complex Belgian ale than what's offered from authentic Belgian breweries, but this beer compares well with others brewed in the U.S. like Ommegang BPA or even Belgian brewed Leffe Blonde."
"d - very drinkable. refreshing, clean, high quality. very solid beer."
"O: All in all, this is an ok brew. Not much special about this one. I've never been a Belgian style fan. I think it's the fruity / bubble gum / clove flavor that really puts me off. Not my style, I guess. If you like these flavors, you will enjoy this one."
"Drinkability/overall- overall this beer would make a nice session beer to enjoy largely due to large amount of hoppiness that stops alot of the sweetness many belgians can have, I think though it creates good drinkability the only downside of this beer to me can be the hops are so dominate it probably takes away some the complexities lurking in there from the belgian yeast, and overall decent ale that would please a hop lover looking for slight belgian twist,"
"Final Thoughts: Although this is MAY be an older bottle, it still has plenty going on. I'm pretty new to the belgian pales, but this one tastes like a lighter tripel. Strong banana on the taste, boozy, etc. It was good, but this is me basing it off of only having two belgian pales before. If your looking for a lighter tripel, buy this, age it a bit, and boom."
"A really good example of the style, and reasonably priced as well."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a hazy golden color with a white foamy head that hangs around a while. The smell is a mild sweet smell with some orange coming through. The taste is spicy, i get some clove and coriander. I taste the yeast and some hops on the back of the tongue. This has a decent mouth feel with a little bit of a after taste. Overall this is a good beer."
"Nice blend of light malt, phenolic yeast and bright hops on the flavor with each playing a prominent role. Hops lend some lemongrass-esque flavors on the end that is delicious! Mouthfeel is light, but wonderfully creamy. Almost get some bananas and coconut as it warms up, kind of has an overall zesty, tropical vibe to it. Very good, I will seek this out again for sure."
"Overall, not a very smooth beer but good flavor."
"Overall: I absolutely love the Flying Dog Raging Bitch Belgian IPA so this is a step down from that. More mild in flavor than a Belgian IPA, but very drinkable at 5.9%. A perfect summer beer when your looking for something other than a Witbier, with a decent amount of flavor without the high ABV. A well done year-round beer from Weyerbacher."
"D - A very nice American interpretation of the Belgian Pale Ale style... Would gladly welcome a chance to drink this in the future and will likely invest in another six pack at some point in the future..."
"o-very drinkable. and at 5.6% it is something to keep in stock. it is bottle and keg conditioned so aging this would be a fun experiment."
"golden amber in color with a nig head of white on top that only slowly faded as the session wore on, dropping tons of lace up and down the sides of the glass. Richness to it that looked just fantastic as it warms up. Aroma of light fruit touches, hints of a light grassy touches, maybe pine. Apples and grape skin start to come to the front as it warms up and it gets a very complex touch to it. Smooth, even flavor here, really quite wonderful. Light and airy on the palate, the carbonation is spot on. Light touches of apples and bananas, hints of light peach and a delicate touch of grape are all coming out at me. Nice bready and grainy touch to it now as well, really again very well done."
"This is medium bodied with a creamy smooth texture. Light level of carbonation but easy drinking. There is not much alcohol impact by any regards which I think really boosts this one's enjoyment level for me. Unexciting and not bold by any means but I think that is what I like the most about this offering, worth a try."
"o: not a bad belgian pale ale. I liked it a lot when it was cold, but as the glass warmed, the alcohol and some harsh flavors came through. not bad, but not great."
"Overall, this is a pretty average Belgian pale. I'm not really digging the metallic notes and it seems a bit filtered for the style. Plus the ABV really shouldn't be as noticeable as it is. I wouldn't recommend this one."
"Cloudy, light copper pour producing a big, bubbly white head that leaves plenty of sticky lacing. Good aroma of stinging hops that lead to a very faint citrus scent along with musty yeast. The aroma is nice, but you gotta dig for it. Solid bitterness, medium bodied, very dry and it leaves a sticky sweetness behind. Dry wheat, biscuits, honey, mild citrus and some evergreen. Candy sugar and earthy yeast. Interesting bottle, I enjoyed it more and more."
"O - I picked this up off the shelf for a mixed six pack. Not an amazing brew, buts is pretty decent. It did hit the spot on this hot night as its fairly refreshing."
"This is a unique take on the style, was surprised to taste the hops in here. Really is a good sessionable brew that I will look for again. Really good stuff here."
"This is a very clear, pale golden colored beer. The head is small, and appropriately whispy. Moderate lace. The aroma has some fruit scents, orange and pear, and a little spice. There is some floral scents...dried orange blossoms? Estery, phenolic...not much malt and hop aroma though. The taste is a bit hot, despite the moderate abv. It's peppery and dry. The carbonation could be a bit higher, but the overall body is firm and resilient. All in all, this beer is just average."
"This is slightly darken golden brew. The appearance was great. You can't clearly see through it so its not a typical Belgian wheat. It is slightly fruity with some bitterness to it. I poured this brew from a bottle to a glass and there was not much foam associated to it. Even though it was fruity there was not much sweetness and there was a dry after taste."
"O - Probably the lightest bodied Belgian Pale Ale I've had. It's rather refreshing, and well crafted. The flavors are simple, but very well done."
"I love this beer. It smells sublime, and has an awesome taste to go with it. The wide variety of esters, phenols, and hop characters play wonderfully together, and come across as elegantly complex rather than as a garbled mess. Tasty, easy drinking, and easy to pair with food. Two thumbs up."
"I would absolutely buy it agian"
"Overall, this is just a good beer. The hops balance perfectly with the malt background and the Belgiany yeast notes. This could also be a great beer to blend with a Belgian lambic beer to create a heavenly fruity Belgian ale."
"D: Verboten is spot on for the style with an above average flavor. Would recommend to an avid Belgian beer drinker. Easy to drink, but want to savor to let pallet take it all in."
"Weyerbacher serves up a pretty decent Belgian pale ale with Verboten, but they put their own spin on in and, in my opinion, miss the mark a little."
"Not a bad not a great beer. my 3rd beer from this brewery and my least favorite."
"Loads of bubbles and snappy light flavors work well together. An unexpectedly nice beer."
"Overall very pleasant though not exceptional example of the style. The slightly strong hop presence gives away the beer's American origins."
"M: Medium-light body with low carbonation, a little thin."
"O- Its not bad and it is a nice brew to have while out a restaurant. I bought a sixer and i have them spaced out because it isnt something i was drawn back to drinking."
"Highly drinkable that absolutely looks and feels great. The flavor is a little tame for the style, but will appeal to the masses in that regard. A very nice and well rounded beer."
"The flavors are nice and clean, with some bitter after-taste. This is a good example of a belgian pale. It isn't examplary, but I reccommend picking up a six pack."
"O/D-High drinkability. Light enough to be a great warm weather beer. However, the flavor isn't too dulled down. I have kept my distance from most Belgians since I have not acquired the palate for it yet. I also hear American interpretations of the style are not always great. However, this beer may help to usher in the style for me."
"Overall (4.5): Although B+ is a good score, I thought it would score higher. It is almost has some characteristics of a saison it is so light and effervescent, but I won't hold that against it as I enjoyed it greatly. The aroma is excellent, and the flavors held up when it was a bit fresher. This is one I will revisit."
"O: Nice American take on the style. Easy to drink, but I never really see it around. Could drink 6-7 of these with the low ABV."
"O - a very enjoyable offering; refreshing and easy to enjoy. If you enjoy Weyerbacher's Blanche you'll enjoy this offering, too!"
"This beer has changed names at least twice and I'm hoping it is going to stay with what they have it named now. This beer pours out as a hazy yellowish gold color with a strong head on top. The smell is like a mix between and belgian triple and a german wheat beer with some hops mixed in. The beer tastes pretty refreshing. The flavors are of clove, wheat bread, spicy hops, and some soft fruits. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated and keep this beer alive."
"A very good beer."
"glad they brought this one back after the trademark dispute, a very good beer that is well balanced between spicy, hoppy, and sweet."
"Overall, an odd beer. Nothing too special. The pepper and spice really throw this beer off from making it something I may actually like. Not really for me."
"This is a very crisp, slight bitter, refreshing beer. It is a little prickly from the high carbonation."
"Pour yields a light copper-colored brew. Very, very short white head without much retention. Nothing else comes of the foam other than a very thin collar. The nose brings some light clove character along with a bit of bread-crust malt. The taste falls through with many of the same characteristics and then hit a bit of bitterness toward the end and in the finish. Fairly plain, other than the clove character. Bit of light floral hops. The feel is light and undercarbonated. Slight bitterness again in the finish along with a bit of alcohol. Drinkability is decent, though nothing too special here."
"12 oz. bottle, conditioned, with no freshness date. Pours golden amber, fairly clear, with lots of carbonation that builds up a two finger froth. The head settles to a quarter inch, leaves nice lacing, and the body loses carbonation rather quickly. In the nose, light malt and spicy hops yield to fruity/phenolic yeast. Tastes of toasted malts, spicy/medicinal yeast, and a firm bitterness from the green/spicy hops. It has a medium body, with lots of carbonation that quickly ebbs, and a lingering bitterness. They call this a Belgian pale, but it almost tastes more like a saison. Either way, this is an easy to drink brew that is well-balanced and definitely worth a revisit. An impressive offering from Weyerbacher."
"D: Forgettable. Worth a try. Nice as an extra."
"D: Unusual blend of hop bitterness and spicy yeast characteristics make this a difficult beer for me to drink. I can't appreciate the combination."
"Overall, reasonably nice flavors, but booze heat and really high carbonation detract here."
"D-"
"On-tap at the Hulmeville. Pours a hazy golden color with a nice thick off white colored heading. Lacing left throughout the tasting. Mostly toasted malts with heavy bread and an awesome spice of clove and a touch of honey. A solid medium bodied with a somewhat thick chewy mouthfeel. Great tingly bubbly action on the tongue. I am not a big fan of Belgian pale ales but this one saat very well with me."
"D: Although I enjoyed this beer, I did get it through a trade, so I don't see the likelyhood of having this beer again, or not for a very long time. If offered the opportunity, I would love to try this one again."
"Drinkability: A little too much phenol character for my palate, but this is a decent stab at the style for a domestic brewer, and one that verges on Belgian IPA territory"
"Good enough to continue with(at least until the growler runs out). Good beer that is just a bit too hot."
"I did not check my 4 pack of Heresy closely and a single of this beer was a stowaway, someone switched out a bottle at the store. Ok, another beer to try. It's pretty good, not really ""Belgian"" tasting. I suppose the black pepper finish gives a hint o' Belgian, but it was hoppier than I'd expect a Belgian Pale to be. Pretty good."
"Very drinkable. Nothing too extreme in any direction. Not very memorable, but would make a very nice session beer."
"I bought a whole case of this stuff back in Aug. Really good up until Oct., not impressed with the aging of this."
"Below average Belgian pale ale."
"Hazy golden color with a small head that hung on for awhile before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Quite a bit of hops in the aroma. Earthy and herbal. Nice yeast qualities give some spice. Pale malt lends some breadyness and sweetness. The taste is bordering on Belgian IPA territory with the hop presence. More bitter than sweet. Hints of grass, yeast spice, with a slight herbal, medicinal finish. Lighter body with lively carbonation that makes the flavors really pop. Not harsh at all. A different take on the style with a bit of the Weyerbacher charactor."
"The mouthfeel is light with low to medium carbonation. Verboten is highly drinkable and the relatively low ABV only adds to its tendency to have another one right away. I went through this 6-pack in less than a week. I'll get this one again real soon. Kudos to the wonderful brewers at Weyerbacher."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is citrusy hops, lemon peel, Belgian yeast, bananas, and coriander. It tastes like peppery spice, bananas, citrus, yeast and some grain. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. Drinkability is decent enough, it's smooth and enjoyable. Not a bad overall brew, I certainly wouldn't turn one down."
"This is a good combination of the hoppy crispness of a Pale Ale with the complex funk of the Belgians. Very drinkable as a beer to savor slowly."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are great and all the senses are excited when drinking it, but it kind of tastes muddled as it warms and isn't dry enough to erase the bitterness and alcohol after drinking most of the bottle."
"D: It is usually tough to expect much from American breweries when it comes to Belgian styles (except for Ommegang and Russian River) but this is way up there."
"I would not drink this beer by itself but pair it with a beef stew or something as robust in flavor."
"Drinkability: I'm in love with this beer. Lowish alcohol, lotsa hops, and interesting Belgian yeast characteristics make a great, drinkable beer."
"d- good, this is a nice offering from weyerbacher, i would pick this one up again."
"Drinkability: For a standard Belgian Pale Ale, this is very bitter and funky, but it is also quite crisp and refreshing. Very good, unique, summer seasonal."
"an orange pour with a nice almost white head of two finger. Nose is of zesty lemon and brown sugar. A bit of apple. Palate has an initial quality of cider. Nice apple tart that is only in the first moment. Then there is a honey and brown sugar pollen quality of malt. The sugar and hop quality isn't brisk one bit though. Hard of the gums as it doesn't sometun sit well. Good roasted meats quality for a blonde but i think the tension on the palate could make the abv very prevelent."
"This pale ale pours a warm yellow with great carbonation and head retention--a yield which maintains an inch with great lacing. The aroma is simple enough but enticing with citrus-aroma hops. Sweetness of pears and spices with bitter hop finish. A little too hoppy given its otherwise delicate flavors. Well carbonated and smooth except for a little puckering due to slightly excessive hopping. Not quite ""pale."" This beer is enjoyable and smooth. Unlike the vandal sneaking in to the temple grounds to learn of it, this truth is not quite verboten to the earthly; let's enjoy."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid pale malt scent along with good hop character and one hell of a yeast aroma. It's fruity/peppery; all of the above. The taste is great as well! I'm loving the bitter hop flavor compiled with a yeast character that's out of this world. It's dry and bitter and just plain good. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a Belgian pale that borders on a Belgian IPA. It's complex and super enjoyable. Great job Weyerbacher!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits and spices. Taste is good, fruits spices, a bit bitter at the finish, a lot going on here. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a high quality beer."
"Notes: Middle of the road for me, granted that I typically am not too fond of the style and this falls on the low end of that spectrum for me."
"D- Not my favorite style, but a very good, drinkable pale featuring some good subtle funk. Reminds me of west Flanders."
"single from some place or another"
"D: Stylistically satisfactory and on point despite the creative liscense and liberties taken by the brewer. A valliant effort, but well short of extraordinary."
"D - Really nice drinkability on this one, the missus and I blew through the sixer. This is a style that's growing on me more and more, and this Weyerbacher brew is near the top of the heap. Solid offering!"
"Overall-- I would happy to drink this if some one offered it to me or if I found it on tap, but I won't be asking Russ to send me another bottle."
"Light wispy head goes away quickly. Nice cloudy golden amber color and vibrant carbonation. Very fruity and bready to the nose. Very bready taste with a hint of orange peels and berries. Nice smooth mouthfeel with a nice bubbling on the palate. I could enjoy a few of these on a spring or winter day"
"F: It finishes a little sweet and bitter and lingers, makes you smack your mouth a little, not bad, but could be better I think, the two main flavors, Belgian malts and hops, seem to clash, not enough Belgian and too much hops IMHO."
"I will want to drink more of these."
"D: Extremely drinkable. I'll be sure to pick up another 6 pack of these next time I'm in town."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip pours an oh so slightly hazy and quite bubbly orange with a nice frothy two finger eggshell head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet fruits with lemon peel and mild spice. The taste is a nice spice filled amount of sweet malts and sweet fruits with a nice slightly bitter citrus hop finish. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing with smooth carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer to wrap up a hot Summer day."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not my favorite style, but pretty tasty. That being said, I was expecting this to be a little better. Not disappointed, but not wowed either."
"D - I enjoyed this after a nice jog...it went down rather easily but maybe Belgian pale ales aren't my thing...I don't know if they changed the recipe from Zotten or not but I remember I really enjoyed Zotten"
"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer. Note entirely to style but very crisp and well worth a shot."
"Hazed lemon yellow body. Thin off white head. Nice lace left behind. Dusty aroma. Some of that nice earthy farmhouse stuff going on without the funk. Bready and lemony aroma as well. Nose is quite complex. Sourdough malt base flavor with earthiness and tart, lemony accents as well. Complex, much like the nose. Spritzy feel and palate cleansing ability are both duly noted. Quite drinkable and good and unique. Chalk up another winner from Weyerbacher."
"Don't drink and review."
"Reviewed blind as part of the Blind Beers BIF. Here goes: It pours a hazy light amber topped by a nice finger of off-white fizzy foam. The nose is fruity: lime, grapefruit, orange, banana; yeasty; spicy: pepper, clove, coriander (maybe). Let's add a bit o' wet hay for the hell of it. The taste is heavy on the Belgian spiciness: pepper, cardamom, rye, clove; some sharp piney hops, some banana, and some orange peel finish things off. The body is pretty light, with an active-ish carbonation and a crisp finish. A very nice BPA, though the hops and spices don't seem to get along all too well, deciding instead to clash. Beyond, that, though, a solid offering."
"As a critique of the style, this is better than weaker wheat styles. It is a better Belgian style for me than others."
"pours a a nice golden peach color with a staying 1+ finger head..clinging lacing on side of glass..smell is musty with yeast and fruit along with some hops citrus lemon and pepper.taste was better then smell first up was some musty grassy hops followed by yeast and fruit like apples and pears..throw in some clove a little citrus peel and som spices..its very smooth..mouth feel is smooth and velvety with sweetness on the front and some bitterness in the back..its well balanced flavorful and easy to drink..ill buy it again and recommend it"
"Drinkability was really bad. This was damn near a drain pour. I was seriously tempted, I really was. But I hate to waste beer, even bad beer. Fortunately, I can down a pint in less than two seconds if I need to. With this one, I needed to."
"D: Very refreshing beer, great citrus notes for a BPA. Two of these would certainly be in order for a hot day."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of yeast, pepper, lemon rind, orange, leather, and earth. This aroma has some nice complexity. The taste has more barnyard qualities to it than the aroma does. There is some hay, horse blanket, lemon, pepper, and a hint of orange. Very nice. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with appropriately high carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very good Belgian Pale Ale that I will certainly drink again."
"I normally tire of 64oz of the same beer after a while but I had no trouble finishing this growler off. The low alcohol kept me in check and the flavor kept me coming back for more. This is very drinkable and than some. Great beer here!!!!"
"I could really enjoy this with some barbequed chicken, ribs, or steak."
"D - solid ""good"" all around. there are better BPA's but this one runs straight down the middle of the style. ABV keeps it pretty drinkable though the hops could wear after a couple. not bad at all."
"D: One of the better examples of an American-made version of a Belgian beer. Drinkable."
"O This is just a wonderful beer. The hop dominant balance hits perfectly in that high hop beer area without being ridiculously hoppy. I love the high hop beers, but when I want more than one, I'll be reaching for the Weyerbacher. Definitely do not miss this beer."
"Weyerbacher Verboten is an incredibly lively, hazy golden ale with a huge, dense, soft, pillowy white head that seems permanent. It has a fruity and spicy aroma with notes of clove, nutmeg, banana, pear and apple. It's pretty light bodied, very lively and quite smooth. It has a pretty clean finish. It tastes fruity, estery and a bit phenolic. A leafy, wooden bitterness zips up the finish. There's kind of an apple pie flavor in here. It's pretty complex, but it's not challenging. This is drinkable enough to be a session ale."
"This is a bit strong in mouthfeel and ABV% but it's not terribly present. While I'd prefer to have one of these beers that's been imported, Weyerbacher's done a decent job with this and for a warm summer night, this isn't a bad choice. I would like to see a bit more flavor in this, but at the same time, this didn't call for any food or drink to accompany it. Worth a shot once if you're into this style of beer."
"D-this beer is just off, plain and simple, extremely phenolic and soapy which i am not a fan of at all."
"Poured a reddish orange with a dense head that thinned fairly quickly. Very sweet Belgian malt aroma, with citrusy orange character and a hint of hop character as well. Nice smooth feel, very pleasant carbonation. Starts with a citrusy orange flavors followed by a the smooth pale malty character. Finishes with a nice hoppy/malty balance. Nice balance to this one. Very easy to drink, will definitely seek this out again."
"Overall: I found that this beer is for once a belgian mixed style that is actually what it is described to be, such as: Belgian IPA / Belgian IIPA, Belgian (insert some style here). This beer lives up to be a belgian pale ale. You've got a great belgian nose but the hops and malt to back up the pale moniker. No recommendations other than to try and have the head on this beer last a bit longer (Minor appearance defect). Great Job on this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, smooth, and sugary."
"Impression: Another fine brew in a style that's tough to do well by Weyerbacher, the brewery that flinches not."
"D - Got through the 12 oz bottle okay, was easy enough to do but I would notn call this a highly drinkable beer."
"Served from tap into a tulip. Pours a golden yellow-orange with a two finger white head that subsides to one finger. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of bananas, wheat, and malt. The flavor was of bread, bananas, apple, and malt. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a really nice and smooth brew. The fruity flavor is obvious throughout but is not overwhelming and made it quite refreshing. I will definitely be buying and drinking some more of this in the future."
"Notes: Glad that I found this interesting offering from Weyerbacher at Save-On!"
"d - A decent Belgian ale. There was a nice smell but a slightly metallic taste which was offputting and the carbonation was too high. Probably wouldn't seek out again."
"Drinkability: This has many qualities to make it pretty drinkable. There's the low-ish ABV, a reasonable take on the BPA style, fairly inexpensive and a nice mix of flavors."
"Drinkability: This is a very sessionable Belgian Pale Ale. Quite enjoyable, and won't dissapoint those looking for a hoppier example of the style."
"Overall - not a bad brew not remarkable but at the same time I don't find myself regretting buying or drinking it."
"MF/D: Decent feel to it, carbonation is smooth and inviting. Residual sweetness and a lingering spearmint flavor."
"D: The injection of hops seems to drown out the rest of the flavors and aromas of a beer that has potential. An interesting take on BPA's but a traditionalist might not find it as such. Drinkability-wise, my palate would be tired and confused after two or three. Worth a try, but nothing spectacular."
"drinkability: a nice belgian pale with higher bitterness. not bad."
"D - This beer displays a lot of promise in the aroma, but ultimately fails to deliver on it. There is a lot of banana and bubble gum as well as a huge, medicinal clove note. While there are some of the vanilla and soft fruit notes that would be more appropriate to the style, they are ground down under the assault of the other yeast flavors. The hops are also a bit blunt. There is a nice herbal note in the aroma and a similar character shows up in the flavor, the bitterness is excessive and exhibits a harshness that is amplified by the medicinal clove. Overall, the beer looks good and smells nice, but totally comes apart in the flavor. I'll finish this one, but I won't be drinking it again."
"D. Superbly drinkable. Sweet and interesting with a decent amount of hoppy bitterness to balance it out."
"The Zotten ale pours a hazy orange almost yellow color. A thin head quickly fades. Aromas of belgian yeast and sweet malts. Some citrus fruits and caramel are also present. Taste is much more bitter than expected with some sweetness up front. Lemon peels and malts round out the quaff. Pretty good tasting belgian ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. Will look to trade for more in the future when it is under the new name. Thanks again Arenbeer!"
"I've had better beers from Weyerbacher, but not many. Frankly, given what I've had from them in the past, I would never have guessed that they could make a beer like this. Impressive."
"I'd wish only that all this flavor could be achieved in a slightly lower ABV to make it truly sessionable. Still it is a great drink anytime, and I'll have to stock up unless they take this guy year-round!"
"Overall a decent Belgian Pale Ale."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a Delerium Noel goblet. I'm glad I was able to find a bottle of this discontinued beer on the shelves at RSVP. The beer has a golden tan color. It is extremely clear with a lot of carbonation rising. There is a big white foam head that has settled down to a finger thick layer of large bubbles. There is a little bit of lacing and plenty of visible coating left behind when I swirl the beer around. It has a great sweet malt aroma. I can detect figs, banana and toffee; it reminds me of a strong dubbel. I could smell the beer a little bit while pouring, but now that I've really taken in the aroma, I'm eager to take a sip. The beer has a big malt flavor. I can taste graham cracker, banana, alcohol and a slight astringency in the finish. It is a heavy beer with lots of coating properties. I can almost swallow a second time after I use my tongue to collect the film left in my mouth. I don't consider this a bad trait (although some might); I like a beer with a strong mouth presence. There is a good amount of carbonation; looking at the beer made me expect to feel more bubbles, but I think the heavy body tempers this quality somewhat. Considering the heavy body and ABV, I find the beer to be pretty drinkable. I would drink a number in fast succession, but I can certainly see myself working through a four pack in an evening. I'm glad this beer will be back, albeit under a different name."
"Nice enough, but one is plenty for me."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall, I really enjoyed sipping on this beer while doing some prep work for a nice grilling session. As Summer approaches and I get the desire for more mellow beers instead of Imperial Stouts I think I will turn to some Belgian style ales to quench my thirst."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D - This is a pretty damn good Belgian, for an American brewery."
"This is a well made beer."
"D - it's just average."
"This was OK at first but as it warmed a lot of alcohol started to show itself. Much more than I would have thought for an only 6% beer. The heavy combo of sweetness, spice, and warmth just didn't work me here the way that I had hoped."
"Pours a dark, clear orange or gold with a big fluffy, bubbly white head. The aroma is tight and perfumy, with allspice and light fruit. Flavor is direct and clean, apricot, wheat, all spice, with a sharp, nutty bitterness that lies across a surprisingly broad sweep of the tongue. The flavor is pleasant, but relatively flat, with an aspirin-like quality that actually accentuates the flavor. The mouthfeel is clingy."
"WOW! Randomly bought a 4 pack of this on a early spring Sunday afternoon from Shop Rite Liquors in Oakland, NJ (tremendous selection btw), and am loving it! Pours a sweet light orange, solid head, great texture, subtle bite, mouthwatering hops and amazing finish. Not much more to say other than I could drink this stuff forever. Too bad it's been discontinued, but apparently it's eventually supposed to be sold under a different name (so don't fret!!). If you get a chance to get this, DO IT, it's the real deal."
"Nice medium orange colour with a white, moderately dense head that almost comes across as creamy. Smell is grassy, outdoorsy, little barn funk. Taste is malty upfront and pleasantly bitter on the finish. Pretty solidly crafted Belgian Pale, actually. Mouthfeel was average for the style, and had very light, nearly non-existent CO2. Very drinkable at 6% with such light carbonation."
"D: Very good. Glass is empty fast."
"I have had this brew since before Weyerbacher was ordered to remove it from based on a legal outcome. With this being said I really hope that they do re-release this brew again and from what I have read it sound like they will. This brew was poured into a chalice, had a nice dull golden color, somewhat cloudy with a nice sized white head that had great retention. The bubbles in the head where reminiscent of champagne and I think this is what lead to the minimal lacing. The aroma is nice, pale malt with a nice clove and slight banana scent ... some additional fruit aromas, green apple? Hops are there and mix very well. The malt flavor comes across first and then the hop presence sets in and seems to mix well with the carbonation as it hits the side and back of the tongue. Hopes have a nice bitterness and are much more pronounced here than in the nose. Flavors of clove and banana from the yeast are there and go very well with everything. Love to find out what hop(s) they have used in this one. Again this was a very good beer and I really hope and look forward to seeing it out in the market renamed in the future."
"Pours a bright orange brown color with a dense tan head that settles into a light ring. Several shades darker than your typical BPA. The aroma is sweet and fruity. There is banana, apple, juicyfruit that goes along with some yeasty phenols, clove. Spot on for a BPA. The taste is more subdued and has more of a hoppy presence. While still sweet, it is more balanced against the bitter hops. There is still some yeasty flavors like banana and clove that remind you that this is a Belgian style brew but some hop presence that tell you that it was American made. The feel is light to moderate, fizzy and crisp. Finishes slightly bitter. An enjoyable BPA, a little off for the style but well made."
"Overall - My first good impression of Weyerbacher"
"Drinkability is definitely high. ABV is low enough to enjoy alone, and it pairs nicely with food."
"D) A well crafted brew. I would definitely drink another and another..."
"Pours from the tap to a brilliant orange-red color with thick off white head tha lingers to mid-glass with okay lacing. Nose is muted, but what is there is not the hoppy citrus I expect from an IPA, but does have the bread scents of a good pale ale. Mouthfeel fairly full and a little chewy, and the aste pciks up the bread and yeast malts of the nose, with just a hint of hops. Finish smooth and fairly long. Not a bad beer at all."
"Overall I found this to be an interesting beer that kept me identifying more flavors and subtleties as I drank it. I enjoyed the earthy/bready character to the citrus bitterness and wish that balance was closer. But I definitely enjoyed this as a diversion from a typical pale ale as well as a ""typical"" Belgian (if one can say typical and Belgian in the same sentence). I didn't grade it as high as some primarily because of the bitter bite toward the end of each sip. This, coming from someone who is obsessed with IPAs."
"Weyerbacher did a really impressive job with Zotten. It's not often that you find American takes on Belgian styles that are such a success. I guess this one deserves a bit of a footnote. The hoppy flavor is very American, but adds a great deal to the overall flavor. I love that aspect of it. The nose could use a little more muscle and the more body would help, but those are small gripes. Zotten's a fantastic beer that's well worth a purchase."
"D: Light body makes it very drinkable but the coarseness and carbonation is a little hard to take at times. As said, before, finishes very clean and that's a nice touch for a complex brew like this. Enjoyable and def. would try it again."
"Zotten was a hazy amber in color that had a one finger off white head and quickly dissipated to a collar. It had a spicy, fruity aroma and tasted like zesty pears. Speaking of zest, Zotten seemed to have a slightly soapy note to the tongue, not really displeasing though. This beer was medium bodied and had plenty of carbonation, reasonably good drinkability. Not my favorite BSPA, but a good one. Besides, I tend to prefer the BSDA's."
"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry hops with some nice light fruity ester and some grain is also noticeable. Taste is also a very nice mix between some cereal and dry hops with a light fruity touch in the finish - I very much appreciated the hops presence and this was somewhat reminiscent of DDC Dernière Volonté thought a notch below overall."
"Excellent."
"I'm not too familiar with the style just yet, and this one is certainly good enough to keep me interested."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I wasn't really sure what to expect with this beer but was pleasantly surprised to find that the spice content wasn't overdone and that this was a decent beer overall."
"Fairly easy drinking and sessionable. Overall, not bad. I'd probably reach for this in the summertime or use it as a ""gateway"" beer for non-beer geek friends."
"Wow this has to be one of the worst ideas in beer history. Trying to cross a pale ale with a Belgian and what you got is something that is a distant cousin to both. Instead of leveraging the style's strengths this beer doubles down on their worst attributes. An aroma that is pungent, a color taht is cloudy. A very hoppy tatse that fights like a strong ale. Not a fun beer and a true shame that it might discredit Weyerbacher's other great beers."
"This actually outclasses Bruges Zot, which I found overrated, but which is of the same style and shares a conceptual link. It may not outclass all authentic Belgians in the style, but it can sure hold its own. Another Weyerbacher winner."
"Pretty aggresively hopped for a Belgian Pale, and theres a whallop of phenols here. The alcohol is a bit strong for a 6% brew."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Nice subdued flavors, refreshing mouthfeel with a very moderate ABV, I could drink this all day."
"Hazed copper color with a finger thick light tan/off white head that dissipates to a thick ring and spotty film. Pleasant aroma of yeast and floral and citrus hops. Flavor is very rich, light, and complex. The floral, yeast and citrus notes dominate with little malt presence and linger with an earthy, citrus aftertaste. Creamy soft mouthfeel with high carbonation. Overall a nice balance of sweet (fruit and yeast) with spice and hop bitterness, an excellent summer beer that is great year round. Good job Weyerbacher."
"*reviewed on 10-25-2009"
"Best of both worlds. This is a gem."
"Poured amber/orange, with a thin white head and no lace. Smelled of sour yeast-funk, lemon zest, and bittersweet dark fruit, like green raisins and prunes. The flavor did produce some maltiness, raisin, and lemon flavors, but it also produced warm biscuit and evolved to crisp dry finish. Pleasantly surprised after the aroma. The mouthfeel was thinner than expected, but silky and lightly carbonated. Decently sessionable."
"Drinkability: A highly nuanced beer from the sometimes (though I enjoy it thoroughly) over-the-top Weyerbacher. Take some time with this one, let it sit, sip on it. This had some TLC involved, and I would bet that with the Pepsi challenge many wouldn't be able to tell that this is really a domestic. Bravo, again, Weyerbacher, for the addition to the already many times I've said it."
"D: Good, the hops seem to fade a little as I progress, very drinkable, but I am not going to rush to the store for it. Respectable, and a good change of pace."
"Well bodied. Tastes good, looks good, and is easy to drink. I could have a couple."
"Drinnkability: I would drink a lot of this brew. I think it is better now then when it was green & fresh. Bravo..err..Zotten!"
"Unlike quite a few American attempts at Belgian-styles, it's not overdone. Some may mistake that as lacking flavor, but that's off the mark. There's just enough malt to it, and it's a bit ""sweetish", but that's just one component that quickly passes before it moves on. Interesting. Intriguing, in fact. It keeps you looking for more! A unique ale!"
"D - A little too sweet but very drinkable."
"Not bad..."
"Pours a golden orange with a thin white head. Not much retention,but a decent lacing. Aroma is of Candy,spice and fruit. Body is medium with a little too much carbonation for me. Taste is fruity,with hints of licorice and peppery spices. Very enjoyable!"
"lively carbonation and medium body make this an easy to drink beer,especially with the moderately low alcohol."
"Taste is much more of the peppery spicyness flavor. Decent amount of carbonation. A lot of bubble gum flavor as well. Medium mouthfeel. This is getting old in the flavor pretty quick. Good beer though."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It poured a clear orange with a frothy whtie head. Belgian spices rule the aroma, also a bit sweet. The tongue follows the nose, sweet spices followed by a dry lingering finish. The beer is medium bodied, average carbonation. For me the beer is a bit of a sipper, overall a solid beer."
"d: Not bad, but not something I'd hurry back to. Kind of an odd brew."
"I'd say this is more like an American style Belgian IPA, which is an adaptation of the American IPA. Pretty good. Recommended."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Uncapped and poured into my Duralex tumbler. The ale appears a hazed golden yellow color with about an inch of dense bone white foam. Taste and aroma consist of candi sugar, spicy peppery yeast, red candied apples, grapes, lemon, orange, quite fruity, notes of bubblegum. Crisp, dry, medium bodied and well carbonated for the style. The best thing to come from their house abbey yeast strain to date."
"Pour produces a solid contribution of body under head. Perfect pour, consisting of about 1 inch of frothy white head over a copper colored body. Aroma consists of a strong fruit nose sustaining orange peel, coriander, & mild cherry notes. The maltiness of the Belgian style pale ale is definitely noticeable, among some toasted toffee complexities. Flavor contains an initial high carbonated bite of citris orange mixed among coriander and cherry. The fruit aspect of the beer is complex and evident. Finish provides lasting carbonation with the orange and coriander notes, but also accompanies a spicy herbal complex featuring some very mild clove notes. Aftertaste leaves a rustic coriander bite on the palate, as orange citris flavor and notes of hay and horse blanket rise up on the palate. Overall, this beer is extremely impressive, and at 6%, is very drinkable, refreshing, and flavourful. Nothing but outstanding!"
"A very solid new beer from Weyerbacher here. Pours golden with a classic White, tightly beaded head. Nice nose of clove and coriander and some crisp grain. Taste is somewhat similar, but much heavier on the coriander and lighter on the clove. Very, very herbal. Pretty smooth in the mouth with a peppery, herbal finish. Nice effort."
"D: Decent drinkability overall, a well hopped dry bitterness delivers flavor wise though other aspects of this beer are lacking a bit. Good for a few but that would be my limit."
"On tap pours semi cloudy yellowy amber, it lifts a tight khaki head, but then trails behind onlyminor lacing. Midle of the road Belgain pale in my book. Fruity in the mid section and then quite dry in the finish. Pleasant enough stuff, sessionable, would be nice with a warm weather lunch, salads, bread and cheese, but nothing to seek out or go nuts over."
"More dry than the smell indicates. Quite chewy. Very short aftertaste. Low level of hop bitterness. Still, it works in terms of balance. The swallow shows up a higher alcohol level than the ABV would indicate. In a word, I'd describe this beer as enigmatic."
"A bit to bitter for the style perhaps, but pair it with some rich cheese, a baguette and some fig preserves and you have a great picnic."
"Good brew, perhaps not traditional of the style in all aspects, but quite tasty. The flavor characteristics are borderline aggressive, but I would not complain."
"Active carbonation keeps the flavor going after the swallow. Not too bitter, more dry and white peppery. Very enjoyable brew that I will pick up again."
"Overall this beer is a tweener to me, but a perfect tweener. It's hoppier than a BPA, but not as hoppy as a Belgian IPA. It really is a great beer that is really enjoyable. Dan, this beer is wonderful, I love it. If you brew it regularly, I will buy it. A damn fine beer that is a nice mix between a Belgian and an American that is very enjoyable and drinkable. Good stuff!"
"On-tap at Mr. Goodbar's. Some yeast aroma. White soapy head on light orange body. Medium mouthfeel. Smooth, and spicey, corriander, a little cloves and pepper.A little bannana. A little hoppy and drying in the finish. An average beer overall, likely better with food."
"Notes: Not Belgian,but still a very good beer."
"Here we go again, another brew from Weyerbacher. This one is a Belgian Pale, which is a hit or miss style for me. Clear orange in color, with a decent amount of white head. Lots of bubbles are racing to the top of this beer. Musty smells start things off and stay throughout, with traces of fruit thrown in here and there. More phenols in the taste, along with some grapefruit-esq hops, and a dry finish. Medium bodied, this is one crisp and refreshing Belgian beer. Drinking it is pretty damn easy too. Here we have another winner from Weyerbacher. Keep up the good work guys."
"smooth mouthfeel, medium body. good carb. but just not the same as an authentic belgian. good drinkability."
"I think maybe the hops variety used and/or how much is used for bittering should be re-evaluated for this beer, as it otherwise has potential to be excellent."
"Good beer. I wasn't prepared to like it as much as I do."
"Drinkability is pretty nice. When they say Belgian Pale Ale, I think they mean, Belgian-influenced American Pale Ale, not Belgian Pale Ale as in the traditional Belgian style. At least that's my take on it anyway. Still, not exactly what I would call a resounding success - not every style is made better with a big punch of American hops. Leads me to wonder what a classic like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which isn't quite as heavy handed with the hops, would do with such a treatment. Compared to the classics of the style like Orval, though, this one isn't even close."
"I'm having trouble finishing this. I don't think it's bad per say. I read in BA mag that some people were claiming it's too young and I think I tend to agree. Never been a big fan of Belgian Pale Ales in the first place- the Belgians I really like are the Strong Dark Ales but I wanted to try this out. I'm going to save the rest of the 4-pack for a few months and try again."
"Overall, not too bad and certainly worth a try."
"Eminently drinkable."
"D: Easy drinking... overall the beer falters from its lack of sophistication and assertiveness... a solid beer nonetheless."
"Overall, a good session ale."
"Tastes a little out of balance and not as smooth as I would expect a Belgian style to be. The finish is the flaw for me. Worth trying."
"Very good brew. Glad to have tried another Weyerbacher experiment, & a successful one at that. Start sending some of these north!"
"Not an overly complex brew, but nice in certain aspects."
"D- Overall, I enjoyed this one. I think it is a great Belgian Pale Ale that is definitely worth picking up. Recommended!"
"The drink is medium in body with crisp carbonation and is quite drinkable."
"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. On draft. Pours a cloudy orange with a small head. Aroma is heavy, sweet, and lots of melon. Flavor of sweet hops initially with tropical fruits, bready malt (corn?) and melon and yeast in the finish. Not bad but I wasn't a fan of the aroma."
"d - verry enjoyable beer to drink. the 4-pack was just enough."
"This is light beer that is a nice representation of the style that it is creating. I liked this beer but it did not blow me away."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this one and will try it again sometime."
"D - A good belgian pale, but a flavor that didn't wow me. I wish it had mor malt & hops than yeast. The drinkability was average to me, I would try it again if I saw it on tap."
"This poured a hazy copper color with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like fresh wheat and wild yeast and lemon hops, with candi sugar and salty cloves and earthy caramel. It tasted like sour lemon and wild yeast, with copper and caramel and fresh wheat, along with a bit of coriander and clove. It was fairly thin with moderate carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this had a nice clean taste that started out a bit overly sour, but became richer and smoother as it warmed. It had a nice balance of spices, and decent body, so it was easy to drink. It seems like not many Belgian ales are offered for under 7% ABV anymore, but this one is a solid option."
"Quite a nice Belgian pale ale. Done well to style and certainly quenched my thirst for just such a beer."
"glad i had a chance to give this one a shot...nothing like investing in a 4 or 6 pack of beer to find out you don't like it...i'll be sure to pick up a 4 pack of this on my next trip to the liquor store....always a plus to find a local made beer that is worth coming back too"
"Drinkability: Why, that's generally likable! Plenty of flavors and complexity to keep me fairly well-entertained, but, thankfully, it's easy-going on the overall ABV. I do look forward the three remaining bottles!"
"I think i was hoping for a bit more sourness, but this was a good effort. It is earthy and and full of esters. The mouth feel is pretty consistant with th style but it isn't going to replace any imports in this style. Also, there is a bit of a soapiness which was a bit off putting."
"This is sweet and fruity/grainy turning (almost too quickly) to herbal (aspirin-y) dry. It has a certain character that gives it the ""American attempt at Belgian"". It's fine, for that."
"I highly recommend this, especially for any Orval fans out there."
"Drinkability overall kicks ass one of those OMFG beers that inspires me to try as many beers as I can. A case of this is in my near future I have to sit on these and watch them evolve, the best American brewed belgian style pale to cross my palate reminiscent but by no means a copycat of Orval Trappist."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The Belgian character is there, but there is also a unique fruit and hop character that adds to the complexity and enjoyment of the beer. Definetly worth a shot, even if you are not a Belgian Ale fan. Recommended."
"m/d - Nice and light though still a bit sweet like it's big Belgian Triple brothers. Much more refreshing but I'm still wary, I'm used to this taste having a sneaky alcohol punch to it in the end. Really drinkable, complex and a fun style I have not had much experience with."
"I like the breadyness of this beer."
"Not a pro with belgian pale ales, but i like this a lot. If you've had Quad by Weyerbacher (which I love), this tastes like a ""Quad Light"". I will buy this again, and paid $7.75 for a 4pk at Jonathon Ron in Brielle, NJ. Another quality beer by Weyerbacher!"
"drinkability: no, I'll pass. too sweet for me."
"Pours a copper-amber color with foamy off-white head. I was expecting it to be cloudier for some reason, nice head, though. Aroma is bready, citrusy with lemon zest and orange peel, a bit yeasty and certainly tons of banana and clove. So kind of typical. for your spiceir belgian pales.. Taste is pretty much same as aromas, yeasty, spicery with black pepper, etc. I would like it a bit sweeter. Mouth is moderate, fairly spicey with a peppery aftertaste/feel in the back of the throat. Overall its lighter in body and sessionable in that sense. The flavor is a bit off, though, and the spice is a bit much. I would enjoy it more with a bit more sweetness."
"Probably not one i will try again. Not that theres anything wrong with it. This just isn't my favorite style."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with thin foam white head that quickly settles into thin ring that leaves minimal lacing. Crisp light fruit aroma with subtle hops and apple, pear and citrus notes. There's also some nice citrus/lemon zest and peppery spice in the nose. Earthy hop flavor balances out light crisp fruit notes. Hints of apple, citrus peel, lemon zest and other peppery spices. Medium bodied that is smooth and easy drinking with a slightly tart, dry finish."
"A pretty sessionable offering, easily drinkable. Would like to see it in six packs rather than four packs. A solid addition to the weyerbacher lineup. I will definitely be buying this again."
"D - Goes down nicely."
"I'm kinda on the fence about this one, I'd like to give it another chance sometime. Maybe having one that's been bottled in a month might mellow out that oddish tase."
"Pretty drinkable beer. I think I saw some cases for less than 40 bucks; I might go pick one up."
"On-tap for $5 a pint at Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown. Appeared a hazy amber with a short head. This is an interesting beer, but I get some awful off aromas that really kill it for me. Still there's a relatively big, hoppy flavor with citrus and mild pine, while the aroma hits me with dirt and cleaning solvent - not cool. This beer needs some work, but it's not a good beer yet."
"An aggressive pour resulted in two fingers of rose-shaded head with good retention. Nose had a slightly perfumey accent, kind of reminiscent of Juicyfruit gum, definitely yeast-driven in its origin. The color was a hugely hazy deep-amber. The mouthfeel was full, thick, and bubbly with a very sweet bubble gum (think generic pink or Juicyfruit) flavor on the tongue. The finish lingered with that same bubble gum flavor. At 6% ABV and with its realtive lack of banana esters, I really see this as an alternative to Hefeweizen, which I dislike."
"Bottle Pours a clear goldenrod with a good off white head. The head is frothy and diminishing. Produces good lacing. Aroma is good like juicey fruit gum. Good sweet malts with a touch of hops. The taste is good. Good carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Has a good balance of sweet and hop. Not to sweet but sweeter than hoppy. Has light to medium body. A resiny texture. The finish is good with a quality aftertaste. I love these guys beers."
"About 7 0r 8 years ago I bought the Weyerbacher sampler case and sad to say I found it hard to finish. I swore I would not spend any more money on their products. Lately the beers I have tried, given to me by friends, have seemed much higher quality. I am happy to report that this may be the best beer they have made to date. It is hard to tell that this is not made in Belgium. I guess hard work and changes have paid off for this Brewery. As far as this beer they have nailed every aspect of the style. Congrats to Dan. And I am buying their beer again."
"On draft at TND in Wayne in 13oz wide beer flute. This is not an attempt to create a rendition of a true belgian pale ale, rather it is a ""tweener"" beer bridging the belgian and american pale ale styles. That said, this is a really enjoyable beer regardless of style. Funkiness of the Merry Monks yeast strain hits first then followed by a nice amount of hops flavor on the finish. The beer is zippy with flavor and carbonation and extremely refreshing. At 6% ABV, this beer is made to session."
"Overall: One of the better lower ABV offerings from Weyerbacher. Much welcomed addition to the lineup."
"Overall- Good spiciness. Slight metallic bitterness is a bit bothersome."
"Drinkability: this beer went down quite easily and after the second glass, I could have had another. Nice new addition to the regular lineup."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head. Lots of banana in the aroma right from the get go, bready yeast, clovey wheat beer like spice and a mild dosage of hops. Good flavor, definitely Belgian inspired, i like the serious malt structure here, bready again with just enough sweetness to match. IMO this beer needs more hops, i know they are going for a balanced Belgian/American Pale Ale here but a little added bitterness and crispness from another peppering of hops wouldnt hurt this beer any. None the less another solid offering from Weyerbacher and one im glad to have year round. The artwork and package design is great as well, i think this is the visual direction Weyerbacher needs to take in order to put their beer in more peoples hands."
"Honey orange with yellow flashes. Not much head, though a creamy collar remains. Bright, lively nose with big banana, clove phenol, and breadiness reminiscent of raw pizza dough. Flavors follow in lockstep with the nose except that it is punctuated by a pleasant tart yeast character and balanced by mineral water and New World hoppiness, all in bittering and flavor as well as some bubblegum late into the finish. I made the mistake drinking this out of the fridge too cold. Breadiness came out as it warmed. Overall, very good. It does a great job filling the niche of something interesting and sessionable that's not a lager or basic pale."
"D: Not bad, the folks in Belgium won't be doing back flips over this one, but it is pretty tasty nonetheless."
"M/D - really dry finish, but nice carbonation. A bit tart to me, not my favorite."
"D: A nice one-off offering that, at least for me, got lost behind Thirteen and Riserva."
"Finishes really dry and crisp. Somewhat oily as well. I actually enjoyed this one. Seems like it may be an American interpretation as the hops seem to be non tradtional and more citrusy (read: west coast USA). I really liked this, alot. Thanks again to Risser09 for this one."
"Thanks to afterexile for the opportunity to try it."
"D- This is a decent Pale Ale that is pretty easy to drink. Its strength is definitely the mouthfeel. Definitely not my favorite of the style but a decent example."
"Definitely characterful for a Belgian Pale Ale. It can be a bit too phenolic at times as the Clove character is a bit dominating. Not bad though."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color, with a off white head. In the aroma, candy sugar, and green apple. In the taste, sugary, green apples, and green grapes. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Good, but a bit sweeter than expected, and a nice small tart fruit note."
"Many dont rave about this one, but I do. Completely delicious."
"D-Interesting for sure...but something is simply not quite right. A good attempt that may need to be revised."
"My recommendation - definitely try a glass of this beer when you get a chance since it is so different though not positive you will like it enough to try a second, but you will be able to say you had a ""firkin""."
"D: This was a good experience from the firkin and though, at 6.2% ABV, not quite a session something that I would have a few of."
"Certainly an interesting interpretation of a style underrepresented in this area."
