"O- A great example of a well-made Brett beer.  I really want to try a fresh bottle of this since I could see the particular Brett character working well with the hops.  Alas, the bottle was this old when I found it on the shelf.  Hasn't developed poorly in the bottle since the Brett was able to let go over time but the hops sure have faded to almost nothing."
""
""
"Overall - Excellent, excellent, excellent. The brett really makes this pale ale shine. Perhaps more similar to a Farmhouse/ Saison than a Belgian Pale Ale, but nonetheless, it is incredible. Reminds me a bit of Orval, just not as complex and intense. I just wish could get my hands on more!!"

"Rating: A"
"12.7oz corked bottle. pours a golden orange hue with a medium lasting white fluffy head, good lacing. Aroma of Belgian yeast, ripe apples and pears and some mild spicy fruit esters. Taste is o f Belgian yeast mild sour and tart fruity flavors, ripe fruity notes and spicy hops bitterness. A medium crisp body with moderate lively effervescence carbonation. Has sweet mild yeast tartness fruity with some mild spicy hops bitterness on the end for balance. A very good and tasty brew"

"Kind of the opposite experience to what I had with Russian River's Temptation. Smelled tart, tasted sweet. Not bad either way, but I wouldn't mind a bit more cleansing tang or something on the palate."
""
"M - very carbonated, finishes quite dry"
""
"Pour is transparent golden amber with a tight fluffy off white head. Nose is lime, green apple, and tropical fruit. Taste is fairly clean, strong lime with some tropical fruit notes. Brett presence is faint, slightly Cobb webby, with a hint of underlying grain. Carbonation is fairly strong, body is pretty light."

"Overall this was very tasty and enjoyable, and much easier to drink than I expected considering it’s a funky brew. The fruity sweetness and floral hop additions to me allowed this to go down easy. It was a very hot and humid day today this beer was quenching, tasty and hit the spot perfectly."

"D: Outstanding drinkability. ABV is spot on. The complexity keeps it interesting and yet it all holds together extremely well."
""

"I cannot wait to try another from the lost abbey"
"MF – Smooth light bodied with a dry finish. Almost no aftertaste. 4.5"
"O: A memorable beer due to the addition of Brett. Drinks like a saison."
""
""
""
"O - An absolutely great Belgian pale ale. I wish LA would produce more of this one, like in 6 packs. One can dream!"
""
""
""
"O- This one was fun. The aromas blew me away, but you could tell every part was beautifully, and meticulously, crafted. My beer guy suggested I try this as a bridge into Saisons... Long story short, now i'm into Saisons..."
""

"Overall one of the better attempts at the style I've tried."

"O: A very nice brett beer. It's everything Brux and NB Brett Beer should have been."
"This is a very solid offering from the Lost Abbey, and for the price ($5.50), probably their best bargain if you're patient enough to lay it down for quite some time. I do think the Brett could produce an even more flavorful beer than this one here (as indicated by the wonderful aroma), but it's overall a tasty and good clean take on the style."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this was a very well executed beer. Think this is right around its peak, as I've had older brett saisons from Lost Abbey and after 2 years things begin to fall off fast."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice brett saison/ belgian pale. I could go for more esters on my saisons, but this one is certainly a quality brew."
""
"Another nice selection from The Lost Abbey. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, a nice and slightly funky beer. Probably priced a bit higher than it's worth, but otherwise worth a try."

"Saints devotion ale lost abbey, taste is a dry floral, mild yeasty mustiness barn hay, but restrained, tart wild apple, then a yeasty finish that goes on and on with a bit of a prickle, fair bit of carbonation and a coating tart prickle but a light enough body that is really drinkable. The nose is one of the most interesting and you get a bigger hit of the floral Brett character, the sourness is restrained on this but it balances sessionability and some nice Brett character. Recommended 3.75 4.25 4.25/4 4 4"

"Overall, it's really quite drinkable, but it promised more than it ultimately delivered. I still like it a lot, but I was expecting a new favourite from Lost Abbey looking at it, and so I'm a little bit sore that it didn't live up to its potential."
"Pours a dirty light mandarin hue with the frothiest three finger head just like Mr Whippy and clingy lacing everywhere,on smell it's typical funky Brett,mangoes,fresh fruit salad and a nice barnhouse funkiness that lets you know it's a saison,the feel is just under medium bodied and lightly carbonated and to be honest I was expecting a fuller feel and the taste is nice but nothing I'm gonna rave on about tomorrow it's bubblegum,funky Brett,honey and finished with a lemon herbal hoppiness and overall out of all of their range this is the most normalmest and borinest and even though its very sessionable I won't be back for seconds cheers."
""
""
"Flavors are a little one note though. Base beer perhaps lacks a little complexity. Some light breadiness And very faint hint of fruit on the finish,, but the flavor profile is dominated by the brett. Don't get me wrong, I like the brett just fine, just seems like it could have more there to compliment. Mouthfeel and carbonation are right on. Nice enough."

"Medium body and very over carbonated taking away from the mouthfeel and flavor.  Lots of dry, musty funk with the brett overpowering almost everything enjoyable about the base beer.  Nice to have a little of this complimenting the farmhouse yeast but it's way too strong for my liking.  Decent amount of bread/yeast flavor underneath along with grass, straw, faint peppery spice and light fruit.  Once the palate adjusts to strong brett presence, the yeast, spice, apple, pear and alcohol flavors come out.  Not a bad beer but overcarbed and a bit one dimensional.  "

"O - nice beer. Would be especially thirst quenching on a super hot day. I am interested to see how time will treat this one."
""
""
""

""

"O: Appearance and smell are great. Unfortunately, my bottle was undercarbonated. This gave the effect of drinking a ""watered-down"" beer that accentuates the bittering hops too much. I'd up the carbonation by at least 25% and provide more body to the beer so it doesn't taste so light. Additionally, I'd up the ""funkiness"" of a beer advertised to be Brett fermented."

"Overall - Decent beer that lacks the depth I was expecting. I would be interested to see how this would age."

""

"O-A good beer but the flavors didn't mesh perfectly and the musty-ness could have been improved upon."
""
""
"O - Overall a decent Belgian ale with a more fuller flavor profile than a saison. The Brett adds a tinge of tart sourness to the complexity. Overall quite enjoyable."

"M: Lighter side of medium. High carb helps with that."
""
""
"Overall a different take on a Belgian pale. There's an almost herbal quality I can't pin down. Good for what it is, but not outstanding. Still, an enjoyable spring beer."
""
""
"This isn't a terrible beer. And it's got some good elements. But the overcarbonation makes it impossible for me to enjoy it, and often makes it difficult to even find the good hidden behind that wall of fuzz."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light body and well carbonated, pretty refreshing, though with how drying the beer is on the tongue, it makes me a bit thirsty."
""
"O: Great brew from them boys over at The Lost Abbey, can't go wrong with their stuff, again being reminded right here right now. I was not expecting such a funky Belgian Pale, to me it reminds me of a funky saison from the Brett but bitterness gets me back on style. Fruitiness is nice but bitterness and funk seem to fight a bit for me but not bad at all, actually really good just not expecting it. A must try in my opinion, definitely will buy again."

"O: A very easy to drink and flavorful brett golden ale. Defintley enjoyable, would drink again."

"This poured out as a hazy golden color with a massive white foam on top. The retention and head are strong on this are strong. The smell of the beer has a decent amount of Brett on the nose. The beer smells more like a Saison to me than a Pale Ale. The taste is a bit on the spicy side, the malt is good there is a subtle bitterness as well. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall it's a good brew in my opinion."
"With more flavor, and less strength of dryness, this beer would flourish."
""

""

"Poured into a Lost Abbey Rastal San Marco Glass. Pours a quite hazy medium golden amber with a massive, half glass white head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy, pillowy lacing. Aroma of bready malt, slight dry white wine, hints of clove and slight wild yeast and funk. So far the funk level is just right. Flavor is much more funky barnyard up front with moderate brett, developing unusual sweet / dry malt, lemon citrus; slightly floral and vinous. Finishes with dry brett and light hop bitterness. Light bodied, but nice mouthfeel from active carbonation. I never know what to expect from brett influenced Belgian and saison type beers; I'm not a fan of intense funkiness, wild yeast nor sourness. This ale has a distinct funkiness, but all the flavors are nicely balanced and lightly influential, and I really enjoyed it. Lighter than expected, but well made and enjoyable."

"(O)- This is quite nice, not to mention finally a Lost Abbey beer in the small 375mL bottles that does not cost $17+ a bottle! The Brett is nice and dry without being medicinal and the citrus really livens this up. A welcome sight with the weather improving."
"Overall: I was really intrigued by the nose, I thought it was going to like Lost Abbey's answer to Rayon Vert by Green Flash, but it just falls flat; No malt backbone whatsoever, so it is very unbalanced; all you get is funkiness from the yeast and a hoppiness that is way too sharp and bitter for the style. I'm pretty let down by this beer, I as came in with high expectations, but this beer certainly didn't come close to meeting them. Definitely stick with Rayon Vert for an interesting American take on a Belgian Pale Ale hit with Brettanomyces."

"Hell, Raul is tired of this doggone review. Do not get this."
""
""

"Flavors of sage, rosemary, light black pepper, bitter fruit rind, coriander, crystal malt, grassy hops, funky yeast. Overall refreshing and challenging, compelling but not the easiest to drink...it's like a strong barnyard saison."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a fine example of a brett brewed saison. Would be perfect on a hot summer day sitting outside because it only gets better as it warms up."
"o: not the best beer from Lost Abbey (coming from a LA fanboy), and not the best Belgian Pale Ale - but this is a good beer. the brett is a nice addition and the sweet citrus really make this a nice tasting refreshing beer."
""
""
""
"I picked up a bottle of this mostly because it was ""only"" $5.49 and it had brettanomyces. The cork made a huge pop when it left the bottle and then foam began creeping out of the bottle neck. Appearance is orange and super hazy, cloudy, scant bubbles at the top. Aroma is sweet citrus, brett, sort of sharp and a slight bit of that telltale funk stink. Flavor is brett, bit of hay, citrus, lemon, touch of aspirin. This is a solid, enjyable beer. I almost wish it was a $10 750, i'd probably buy a couple. Also, Lost Abbey might as well just drop Devotion in favor of this."

"O: I really enjoyed this beer since it seemed to have the perfect amount of brett to complement the aroma and taste."
"A very simple Belgian Pale Ale with an added touch of Brett. Nice beer, but nothing over the top. I'd like to sit on one for 2-4 months to see how this Brett changes the beer."
"Pours a glowy golden orange. Quite cloudy. I avoided pouring some chunks into my glass, but there are lots of floaties at the bottom of the bottle. Very large puffy white head. Hard to keep it under control during the pour. The aroma has a big dose of soft funk on top of fresh grain. Very pleasant. It smells like a tropical fruit barnyard. Flowers, leather, mangoes, mushrooms and earth. Wonderful brett notes. Very mild medicinal character. Seemed a bit strong, at first, but it settled into the rest of the beer after a minute. The taste starts with fruity grain sweetness before drying out with funk and adding a touch of lemony tartness. Lots of funky, fruity brett flavor. Mushrooms, lemons, barnyard. I try not to avoid esoteric notes, but it sorta tastes like unripe kiwi. Finishes quite dry with medium to mild bitterness. Grassy hops. Effervescent mouthfeel at first. Definitely reminds me of other brett beers. Personally, I prefer it with a bit less gas, and the carbonation fades quite quickly. Pretty smooth feel after a minute, actually. Otherwise, it's light but full on the palate. Very well suited to the beer and style. No booze. Exceptionally easy to drink. Wonderful balance. This is the sort of beer that I would drink be happy to drink regularly. Surprisingly good price, too, particularly compared to most recent TLA bottles. Anyway, I'm quite impressed by this one. Great beer."
"sensational beer. I was never amazed with the regular devotion, but with the brett addition here the beer is entirely transformed. the pour is thick and hazy pale straw color with an inch of white head and amazing lacing. the nose is funky from the brett, not sour at all, but somehow very wild and farmy, summery, harvest time, I don't know, its fresh and its old world. pale malted barley and wheat malt, and a decent hopping, more than I remember in the regular devotion. the brett yeast really makes the flavors come together, tons of hay and cut grass, and a little citrus before the hop bitterness kicks in. awesome mouthfeel, really bright on the tongue, with very active carbonation and a lighter body that feels bigger than it is. I think this is so well in balance and so interesting, up there with red barn and carnivale and the other saison type beers they brew. this is an A."

"Overall not as complex or as enjoyable as I expect from a small expensive bottle from San Marcos."
"O - This is really a funky beer with lots and lots of funk. However, while there is a good amount of it, it does slightly overpower the rest of the beer"
"Sweet with a good bit of acidity, lighter side of medium bodied with brisk carbonation. Initial sweetness with notes of bubblegum and banana, tart acid around mid palate, faintly medicinal with an herbal bitterness and extremely dry finish. Vinous flavors linger in the mouth. Faint notes of vinegar apples and pears. Pretty good and very funky."
""
"O - Nice subtle hops behind tons of Brett. Should have aged this one a bit."
""
"O: I love regular Devotion and this is just as good if not better. Great yeast oriented flavours, pricey, but certainly worth a pickup on a single."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very interesting beer. Kinda gives you a blend of more than one style. Pricey, but tasty."
"OV: If the yeast didn't overwhelm the other flavours so much, this would be a brilliant brew. I would have it again and imagine this would pair very well with food."
"The smell is all Belgian, lots of funky Brett and yeasty esters. Very nice! The taste follows. Champagne like spritziness and barnyard funk. Tastes of mild spice and some fruity hoppy character balance with the pale maltiness of the beer for a really nice balanced taste. I'd drink this again in a heartbeat."
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a chunky cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Some interesting chunks of sediment sink to the bottom of the glass after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, citrus zest, pepper, and Brett. Taste is much the same with grain and Brett flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of citrus zest bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and some solid flavors."
"Overall: Pretty good offering from Lost Abbey. Its worth picking up a bottle, but I wouldn't go crazy trying to seek it out."
""
""
"This is really good, the aroma in particular is delightful. As far as how much it differs from their regular Devotion, I can’t say, but stands up on its own as a great beer. Gonna have to grab one more to throw in the cellar and let the Brett do its thing."
"O: The grape sweetness and funky, citrusy Brett mix quite well together in this beer. I really enjoy it."
"O: There is a certain amount of delicate complexity to the smell and taste of this beer that I can really appreciate. I really enjoy brett but it is a little too dominant in the flavor for me. Definitely a beer to enjoy and fairly easy to drink, I would get another one of these and it is available at a fairly reasonable price."
"A very nice easy drinking Brett beer. I'd definatly come back to this, a worthy beer indeed. I have yet to have a bad beer from LA."

"Beer is light and thin and very spicy on the palate, sweet at times but the base beer is completely gone leaving me with this overly Brett beer with few describable characteristics."
""
"The beer appears hazy and straw yellow with a thin white head that coats the glass in lacing. The aroma offers strong brettanomyces funk, malt. Smell and flavor dominated by brett. Very tasty. Light in body and easy drinking. A solid brew. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
"Overall: This is a very solid brett beer. Light and crisp, quite easy to drink."
""
"Clear light orange with a nice white head that has decent retention and moderate lacing. The nose has a brilliant Brett character with pineapples, tart fruit, spicy cloves, white pepper. I don't think I've had the base beer, but the Brett has completely covered it up. Some honey is present too. The palate opens way too sweet, almost like someone dumped some Splenda or Equal in this beer. Again, there's a blend of white pepper, clove and pineapple. Very highly carbonated, this beer is a little too spicy and a little too sweet for my liking. Decent."

"Thanks to Ken for this treat. Pours a crisp, light golden color, with a decent white head. Aromas of brett, funk, Belgian yeast, apples, pears and some nice spice. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, complex and refreshing, with bretty fun and flavors of freshly ground black pepper, crisp, juicy apples and pears, Belgian yeast and some candi sugar. ™"
"Thanks to Chad for sharing this! Pours a murky straw color with a small white head. Scent is a lot of Brett, Belgian yeast and pepper. Other spices as well. Taste is somewhat salty initially, followed immediately by Belgian yeast and slightly tart green apples. Then I get some orange and lemon peel. Lovely pepper flavors matched with Brett. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly drinkable. Overall, this is a better version of the original Devotion. I wish they replaced it with this."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and goes down with a nice drinkable feel. It is slightly refreshing and holds a funky character that stays throughout."
"D - Easy drinker for sure...on a hot summer day, this would be a welcome companion that I could stick with all day. It isn't overly complex or unusual, but it is still pretty tasty...still wishing there was more brett though."
"Drinkability is pretty good, with the nice dry finish from the Brett, and crisp ale and light pale hops. A nice drinkable beer."
"Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger of head and left nice frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The funky musty brett and belgian yeast aromas dominate the nose alongside some spice, slight citrus, faint grassy, and apple notes. The taste also has the belgian yeast character but the musty funky breet is not as potent but is well balanced with citrus, spice, and slight clove accents. Honestly the flavor leans more towards a saison with brett. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, spice, musty funky, and bubbly finish. It drank pretty good but like I mentioned its probably better categorized as a saison. I still was glad that I had the opportunity to try this beer and a variation of the devotion."
"Finish is a bitter grapefruit grassy green spicy character. Leaves you really wanting more."
"D: Utterly drinkable. The funk, with over a year and a half to settle in, really controls the ale. The dry body leaves a lasting impression on my palate."
"A light grassy brett beer, pretty refreshing, but a little light and tough."
"D - Perfect beer for a summers day and about eleventy-billion times better then regular Devotion."
"Interesting but not great. Very subtle on the sour aspects, glad I wasn't the one to pay for this."
"Pour is a hazy golden yellow with a large frothy head, nice rocky lacing. Aroma is of hay, lemon grass, and herbs. Very faint brett, but it is there (even though I accidentally sat on this one for a while). Nice belgian pepper/spice element, but not enough funky brett. A bit sweet. Very drinkable. Good, but nothing to scream about. I was expecting a bit more as this was a special saint's release."
"D: Very drinkable and pretty low ABV. Tasty brew."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle courtesy of brotherliam, thanks again for trading me this bottle Bill, drank tonight from my Kapittel goblet, color is a golden orange with some lighter tones, two inch fluffy white head that lasted a few minutes, appearance was nice except for the sediment floating around from the top six or seven ounces from the bottle, could have excused that if it was from the bottom but it was not, aroma consists of apples, yeast, caramel, herbal accents, lemon, orange, sugars, earthiness, mild funk, and grapefruit, taste starts off with dryness and is rather yeasty from the get go, some citrus in the middle but still very dry, finishes dry as well with earthiness and what seemed like hibiscus even though there is no flowers in here to my knowledge, warms up with green apples and sweeter funk with that same dryness, dry, flowery, and yeasty mouthfeel, medium bodied, tons of carbonation, gushed a little bit when the cork popped, taste lingered a long time with the dryness, could have drank the bottle probably but pretty filling considering its ABV, too dry with misplaced heavy sweetness at times, not the smoothest Belgian style beer out there, the brettanomyces will probably develop more as time goes on but it is already starting to really dry things out, Devotion is not one of my favorite beers to begin with but this helps a little bit in some areas, not too bad, worth trying"
"Decent brew, better than most experiences I had with LA, as this one at least has some carbonation, but the funkiness is not nearly where I expected."
"Pours a semi-cloudy sunset gold with a two finger bright white head that falls to a thin layer of foam. A decent amount of spiderweb looking lace holds on to the sides of the glass. Aroma consists of pear, apple, and light yeasts. A good amount of brett, honey, and grass as well. Taste begins crazy bretty with big musty hay flavors and dry farm blankets. Midway a touch of honey sweetness emerges but is quickly taken back by the sharp lemony hops. Aftertaste is pretty funky and dry with some zestiness lingering. Light fluffy body with a crisp feel and active carbonation (woo hoo!!). Pretty easy going down, I definitely prefer this to original version. I'd love to see what some age would do to the brett. Overall, good brew for sure."
"Brettanomyces tasted immediately and blends rather seemlessly with the lemon-wheaty malt and zesty hops. Nice little prick of carbonation on the tongue. Extremely refreshing and very drinkable."
"this one is easy to drink, downed the whole 750 in no time due to only being 6%. I think more time in the cellar to let out more of the brett character is in order though, it has, IMO, the possibility of getting much funkier. glad I picked up extras when I could."
"How much does spiking the bottle with Brett cost? This is much superior to regular Devotion, and I'd buy this regularly (unlike regular Devotion, which I only bought for A/B comparison purposes). Please bring this one back Tomme!"
"The body is moderate with a clean finish. A light carbonation. This will be very interesting to compare and contrast over a few years."
"Thanks go to RustyDiamond for sharing this bottle with a few of us Atlanta area BAs. Thanks! Pours a hazy orange/golden with a thin head that settles to a ring. Smells lightly lemony and grassy, and slightly metallic on the finish. This Brett is still young, and this should sour up and become more complex over time. Tastes quite bitter and somewhat funky with a nice earthiness and a little funky, but nbot sour at all. Smooth, bitter, and earthy in the mouth, with a slightly stinging bitterness that lingers. Nice, but will probably get better."
"Drinkability: A tasty upgrade to the standard Devotion. The somewhat more subtle Brett addition allows for some fine penetrating complexities without losing sight of the original beer or suffering from lack of drinkability."
"A springtime picnic with sharp cheeses, grapes, and pepperoncini would be a perfect match."
"I definitely like this a bit more than the standard Devotion, the Brett adds that little something extra to this nicely hoppy Belgian'esque ale. The sharp Brett notes actually compliment the hop character. I really wished I hadn't missed out on picking up a couple extras of this beer, one is simply not enough."
"7/4/8/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange color with a massive bubbly head that sticks everywhere. Smells of spicy Belgian yeast a bit of funk, lots of fruit. Tastes of fruit, berries. Spicy and peppery. Smooth as hell with a sour twang. The brett sourness is there, but not dominant. Nice in its subtlety. Mouth is smooth creamy body is medium to thin. Carbonation is medium. Very interesting brew, I enjoyed this bottle and look forward to the others after a little time in the cellar."
"Pour a slightly hazy yellow/orange. The aroma of sour fruit notes dominate to the point were I am smelling this beer for longer than usual. First sip is sour but does not make you pucker. With the sourness, some brett, Belgium yeast, and fruit notes are present but lacking in real complexity. Not bad...just not in the same league as my favorites in this category."
"Drinking it...smooth, sly, lush, and tasty. Blast of fresh and palatable, dry fruit, then loads of spice, dry and peppery...but it's all very drinkable, ..yum, funky, brett-y, zesty, ...what was that? Yum."
"Not the best I've had from Lost Abbey but a very, very drinkable beer that uses brett as a subtle, not overpowering element."
"Pours hazy gold with a small white head and good lacing. Wheaty, bretty funk in the nose. Taste was dry; sourdough dough with a rye-ish bread crust. Melons and wheat with light citrus. Very bretty. A nice improvement over the regular devotion; gives it that punch/flavor it was missing."
"Overall this was a good beer, not what I was expecting. I was wanting a little more out of this one, as it was just not as big of an experiment as it could have been. Still, a very good beer and not something I would turn a nose up at."
"I have to say this was by far the best perk of the Lost Abbey Saints Club. Probably the best use of brett that I have ever tasted. It was incredibly well balanced and integrated. The brett complimented the other flavors rather than overwhelming them. Crisp carbonation, nice hop character, a little bit of funk with just a hint of tartness on the buds and a wild horse blanket aftertaste made this one hell of a nice brew!"
"The taste is initially hoppy. Like the regular Devotion, Saints' Devotion is a well hopped Belgian Pale Ale, but there is an added layer of sour funk. Flavors of tart lemon, spices, and some coriander. Long bitter, dry finish with a final lingering tartness. The beer is not very sour but the Brett is definitely there. The carbonation is very good."
