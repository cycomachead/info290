I know the whole point of this beer is that it really fits no specific category but thats the flavor profile I'd compare this beer to. The spice flavor is dominant, a result of the belgian yeast and extra hops. Not at all a bitter beer though. Lots of different flavors blend together in this beer.","adman08","Jul 24, 2011"
4.12,8.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This ale pours fairly clear deep golden color with a sticky white head. The aroma is a burst of fruity esters, a lot of banana, as well as some citrus and hints of clove, inviting. The flavor is dominated by fruity esters, a lot like banana bread, with some cloves, and tropical fruits. These flavors are balanced out by some spicy hop flavor and moderate-low hop bitterness. The beer finishes slightly dry with just a bit of lingering yeast character. The body is medium and carbonation medium-full. Overall a nicely made beer, refreshing, yet still interesting, worth a try.","uwmgdman","Jul 18, 2011"

The smell has an average Belgian aroma to it. The taste has a decent bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side.

3.58,-5.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a bright peach color with a really nice two-finger white head. Good lacing as it goes down and a thin collar stays along for the ride. The nose brings some light bready malt as well as a light floral aroma and a bit of earth and spice. Flavor has mild malt sweetness plus a bit of a hop presence. Yeast kicks in with some mild spice toward the finish. Really light, yet creamy, mouthfeel that is the highlight of the beer for me. Nicely done. Thanks again, Andy.","Thorpe429","May 10, 2011"
3.8,0,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Good-the aroma is awesome, and the alcohol is expertly hidden. However, the flavor tastes like there's just a little too much going on.

Also some tropical fruits mango/pineapple character going on in there. Flavor blends a heavily spiced wit with a big Belgian golden ale, over ripened banana and pineapple juice with bitter citrus pith accented hops an heavy with coriander and a touch of anise. Pretty intense experience I can feel and taste the booze I would guess even a bit higher than the seven percent it actually is. Mouthfeel is a bit cloying at times between the layers of spices that stick to the palate between sips and the aggressive hop profile, it's just a bit sticky on the palate with some residual sugars. Carbonation is ample no complaints on that but those spices make me want to brush my teeth. Drinkability overall is decent a strong aggressive interesting hybrid ale another uniquely American take on a classic style, gotta love our no rules attitude when it comes to brewing.","WVbeergeek","Jul 10, 2010"

Scent is a huge whiff of peppery belgian yeasts and spices such as corriander, a light citrus and wheaty background round out the nice scent. The first sip is an almost cloying bite of the corriander and peppery yeast, the malts come across as quite sweet (almost bubblegum like) for containing such a large portion of wheat and a muddled citrus flavor is present throughout. Medium bodied, highly carbonated, dry finnish and a touch of burn. An interesting beer that tends to overdo some of its ingredients.","rfgetz","Jun 16, 2010"

4.19,10.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy golden color. Nice mix of yellow and orange, and I can't tell if it's chill haze, or just haze, but I think it's a bit of yeast haze, because it didn't really clear up throughout the drink, but I can still see through the beer. The head is thin and white, not very dense, but it actually stays around a bit and leaves a little lacing. Kind of normal for the belgian pale style. The smell has a few dominant characteristics, all of which are interesting. First, there's a kind of fruity, sugary, bubble gum flavor, partially from nice fruity esters, and partially from the candy sugar (I assume) that gets used in this one, but it's really powerful in the nose at first. That subsides to a deep spiciness, I mean really spicy, earthy and pungent, herbal, kind of leafy, almost like burning leaves, with a hint of grass clippings. You can really smell a bit of malty sweetness, not quite bready, but sweet, mixed in with a bit of yeasty tartness. The taste starts out like chewing on fruity gum, thanks to some esters and a bit of sweetness, but that falls back quickly into this sticky, earthy taste. The malt comes in, a bit toasty and crackery, but there's this uncontrollable earthy spiciness in there. It's just herbal, leafy, and almost burnt with the hops and the spicy yeast combining - the yeast is actully a bit tart as well as spicy, somewhere between Saison yeast and Belgian Pale yeast. The malt presence comes in at different intervals, like cookies, and also a bit like powdery, starchy grains in different places. There's also a bit of a burnt sugar type taste to it. Overall, it's really a great Belgian Pale, perhaps leaning the furthest towards that earthy spiciness of any I've ever had. The body is actually very sticky and full from the malt and hops combining. The carbonation is nice and lively, crisp, and accented by the moderate dryness of the beer. The only thing is that the earthiness can wear on you thanks to that dryness, but I really find myself enjoying it. Not the easiest to drink, it's actually a bit challenging, though thoroughly enjoyable. I would definitely buy it again, but could not make it a beer I drink often, despite how much I enjoy it. I would recommend to anyone.","taylorhamrick","Aug 12, 2009"

Taste is nice too, orange, sharp and citric, yeasty, lots of light fruit, toasted wheat, banana and spice, some bitterness in the finish, very cool.

3.72,-2.1,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy amber color with a small head and no lacing. Not much in the way of aroma on this one. A bit of candied sugar, some caramel, and a little yeastiness. Taste is on cue with the aroma. Candy sugar, a bit of apple, slightly spicey, and a dry yeasty finish. A bit thin on the tongue, carbonation was ample enough and overall pleasant to drink. A decent take on the style.","KeefD","Aug 16, 2008"
3.2,-15.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D: The alcohol is well-hidden amongst the Belgian spices but that is not enough to salvage a spotty flavor.","akorsak","Aug 10, 2008"
3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer very yeast-driven, in that most of the character is spun off the fermentation, not the grains and hops. In addition to the bubblegum are more spicy phenols plus red apple and white grape esters. The appearance is a hazy gold, similar to a hefeweizen, with a short white head. The body is also deceptively drinkable for a 7%+ beer. All things considered, this is a pretty good Belgian. Kudos to Furthermore, this stuff isn't easy.","tempest","Jul 27, 2008"

4.14,8.9,3,4,4.5,4,4,"A real good ale. I would of liked the lemon cut back a little to bring the other flavors out but it is still very flavorful. The high ABV cuts down on drinkability.","morimech","Jun 16, 2008"
4.35,14.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I though this was excellent. A style that is hard to master, but they proved they could do a damn good job at it. A classic in my book and I am very glad that I chose to seek this one out. Definitly a winner and I loved every minute of it.","mikesgroove","Jun 13, 2008"
4.32,13.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Nice cloudy orange color. An finger of lacy head that lingered for a while. Really liked the taste, more like a wheat ale on steroids. Like if Blue Moon had a bigger, stronger, hoppier brother. Good aftertaste with a little hop bitterness. Dangerously drinkable highly reccomend and will pick up again.","ceeman","May 24, 2008"
3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is nice and chewy, a little thicker than I was planning on, and it also has a nice carb. to it. I could have a couple of these, but the sweetness might get to me after that, but overall a good beer.","mnstorm99","May 22, 2008"
3.45,-9.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"D- This is an ok session beer with nothing to exciting about it. The hops don't seem to fit with the rest of the beer flavors and the dry malt flavor makes it a bit bland.","rhoadsrage","May 16, 2008"
3.8,0,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D- pretty solid, and its pretty cheap, not a bad option for a belgian pale fix","Atron67","Apr 06, 2008"
3.45,-9.2,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Golden copper orange. Fluffy white cloud of froth graces the surface. Lacing is more than adequate. Sweet candy like aroma spliced with some peppery spice notes. Some doughball aromas as well. Flavor is o.k., but lacks the character and complexity to make it anything more than o.k. Sweetly malty. Slightly alcoholic. Peppery. Faint yeast esters. Body is medium or so. On the high end of the carbonation chart, but appropriate nonetheless. This is a decent drink.","Bighuge","Apr 01, 2008"
3.87,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"D: Not a bad beer at all, this could be a very good summer drinker. It doesn't stand out though.","drseamus","Mar 11, 2008"

3.35,-11.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Thin in the mouth with light, prickly carbonation. Slightest bit of metallic twang lingering. Overall lacking in herbal character from hops both aromatic and in flavor, but is well-rounded overall.","Skidz","Nov 02, 2007"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: finally, I like one of the Furthermore brews. Easily the best of the group I bought from France 44. Good solid Belgian ale with an interesting and somewhat complex taste. Cool name as well.","FightingEntropy","Oct 14, 2007"

3.97,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The only thing to really point out that would ever need to be pulled back is the amount of yeast in this beer. Even decanting two thirds of the beer brought on the opaque look so swirling in the rest made no difference. All of the characteristics point right to Belgian White Ale even with the bigger bitterness here. All said and done this is an enjoyable Belgian-style ale with certainly more oomph (7.2% abv) compared to the typical Belgian White Ale.","Jason","Aug 03, 2007"

4.3,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - I'm quite impressed with this one. The brewers are doing everything right. The label simply defines it as a "Belgian Style Ale" with a bunch of other marketing fluff, so their intent is tough to pin down. I'd certainly pin it in the Saison / Belgian Pale Ale realm, if that's vague enough.","mjsarch","Jul 13, 2007"
3.71,-2.4,4,3,4,3.5,4,"D: Enjoyable for an American take on the Belgian Pale Ale. Went down leisurely and smooth. This was my first offering from Furthermore and I have to say I'm impressed.","Winter","Jul 07, 2007"
3.54,-6.8,4,2.5,4,3,4,"Probably not a true Belgian, but I'm choosing to think of this as creativity rather than inadequacy. The color is an intriguing translucent apricot, with a nice off-white head. A stream of fine bubbles rises throughout the time the beer is in the glass. It's "very drinkable for the style," which I put in quotes only because it's getting to be a common comment from me -- but usually it's a negative, and here I find it to be a plus. Some nice spice and fruit notes -- I almost think there's some apricot to the taste, too, unless that's just the power of suggestion. A clean, lightly hoppy finish. All in all, I'm a little surprised to like this beer as much as I did, but it does have a nice balance of interesting flavors and drinkability.","Flyer","May 30, 2007"

3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability/Overall: as others have noted, this is not a beer that strives for balance. Gobs of citrus, bubblegum and spice make for an intense experience, along with a seemingly hearty alcoholic content. Still a refreshing beer that felt pretty damn good on a hot, finals week May night.","Golden2wenty1","May 08, 2007"
3.92,3.2,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A hazy golden color with a small amount of very fine head, which dissipated quickly but left 2mm of very fine white bubbles. Aroma is slightly tripel-ish, with a fair amount of clove-iness (quite good). Flavor is very spicy and good...a lot of American Belgian ales taste slightly chemical-y or overdone, but this one did not. Mouthfeel was not flat, but was quite good and smooth. I really enjoyed this beer.","BeerBelcher","Apr 25, 2007"
3.62,-4.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: This is a little intense, very yeasty, somewhat boozy, and definitely hoppy. Its no balanced work of art. Thats for sure but it is a complex and exciting beer. I would think that age would help mellow it in a good way. At any rate, it is very strong and gives a great buzz.","DaPeculierDane","Apr 16, 2007"
