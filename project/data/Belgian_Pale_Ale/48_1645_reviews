"Excellent belgian ale. Unsure of all the shade towards it."

"Overall I think something was off with this beer, it seems similar to what some people have noticed, but mine seems to have more off flavors. It should be the same age as the other beers that came in that Belgian pack and all the other ones seemed fine, so this might be and off bottle and I will have to try it, but as it is my rating stands. Better luck next time guys."
"Very refreshing and easy to drink beer, being well balanced and not overly sweet. Don’t expect high complexity, it is a very pleasant beer that you could even session it with a great cost/benefit."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange amber with a one finger, off-white head that dissipates to a ring around the glass leaving lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, dried and fresh dark fruit, Belgian yeast. Flavor follows aroma, with dark stone fruit, milder dried dark fruit, sweet caramel malt, apple juice and Belgian yeast, finishes with mild grassy hops. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A pleasant, semi-sweet Belgian pale or amber that is slightly lighter in flavor than I hoped, but well made and balanced. This is somewhat old bottle that has held up quite nicely."

" The flavor is very good with a generally yeast fruitiness in the taste with slightly ripe banana and honey-like malt flavor which is sweet but not cloying and there is a subtle spice element with light bitterness in the finish. Overall this is a very good pale ale, a bit sweeter than most but the carbonation is high which makes it seem balanced and drinkable."

"I picked this up as part of a six pack sampler of Belgian beer. Poured into a chalice. This beer had to be poured immediately lest the beer would have flowed out the bottle. The beer pours hazy amber with a large white head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice cap of head. This beer appears to be very carbonated. Plenty of lacing is left behind during consumption. The aroma is of sweet caramel and bread. The yeast also brings fruity esters (raisin) as well. It's such a terrific smelling pale ale. The taste follows the nose. It's bready, but also mildly sweet with caramel and raisin flavors. There's also some mild spices and a somewhat grassy flavor. The hop bitterness is low. The flavors aren't strong or cloying, but milder and very enjoyable. The body is light with high carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer. If you find this beer, you should definitely try it."

"I liked this beer much more than I expected too. I think it has a tremendous amount of flavor for 5.2% ABV and it's true to its belgian heritage. Lots of caramel and raisin - balanced. I got it as part of a 6 pack Belgian beer sampler and initially rolled my eyes when I saw that one of the beers was this low in alcohol. But I'm a convert!"

"Overall, as I have been finding my way around ambers lately, this one was a delight. It's very Belgian in that it's complex in taste and smell. It's very good, and I could drink a lot more of these if it weren't for the price."

"Mouthfeel- Thin mouthfeel with good amount of carbonation."

"O: Pretty bland all around and not really what I was expecting or hoping for. Sort of surprised it's a Belgian ale at all, but I digress. At 5.2% ABV, it mirrors the ""Bud of Belgians"" for the ale category and would likely be accepted among that demographic of drinker."
""
"I smellt caramel but in a lightness I don't know from ambers. The taste was even better because of the bitterness I usually miss in ambers. Touch of vanilla and liquorice. Mouthfeel good. Overall: in this occasion it felt that the waiter was right!"
"Atmosphere is decent. Really nice, foamy head and plenty of spider web lacing. Nose is a little off putting. Very pungent and sour overpowering character. Flavor is light grains with a little sweet and a little bitter. Overall, this is a fair quaff."
"Overall, this is a fine, full-bodied beer, and brought an unexpected and pleasurable dark sweetness to the table."
"O: Drinkable, but not great."
"Tastes better than it smells. Loads of malt that ends super refreshing hops pop at the end. Licorice and caramel notes."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall, but I am not sure how well it fits into the Belgian Pale Ale category. If it was sitting next to just about any of the Ambree styles, it would be a serious contender, so that is how I plan to score it. Overall this is a beer that I wouldn't mind coming back to if I wanted a flavorful light gravity beer, this is one of the better ones that I have had recently. This seems to be a fresh example of this beer, and I am sure that this particular one from the batch would last very long. I may go back and re-review the Piraat beer again from this pack because the last one I reviewed was a bit stale. Anyway, I would not deter anyone from trying this beer, and I hope that you get to try as fresh of as an example of it as I obviously am."
"D – I hate to say it, but the mouthfeel kind of ruins it. If you take a sip and enjoy the taste for a microsecond and then swallow, it will be alright but if you stop too long and enjoy, you’re in for a bad experience. I couldn’t do too many of these. Too much mineral. Almost tastes chemically."
"Drink- For a free gift pack for dad's day. Ill take the chance to try some new beers. Probably will give it another shot in the future but may wait awhile."
"O - about average for style"
"Sampled on June 6, 2011. There is an amber-yellow pour with a puffy, long-lasting head, and a slight cloudiness. The aroma is malty but there is a melted butter type character that I cannot otherwise define. Maybe it was the yeast. Not much in the way of hops on the nose.The body is better than medium although it breaks down into carbonation quickly on the tongue. There is a weird bitter and buttery combination in the flavor with a slight hopped ending."
"An generally enjoyable Belgian amber ale, the expected sweetness mostly tempered by the inherent yeast complexities."
"Overall – It seems like a well crafted beer but it was a little harsh tasting. It seemed to get better as it approached room temperature but it still wasn’t all that drinkable. Another beer that falls in the category of ‘happy I tried it, but wouldn’t seek out again’."
"It's just too metallic to be a session beer for me."
"O: I'm pretty pleased with this beer. Though not a great beer it has a lot of the Belgian characteristics that i like in a might lighter, lower alcohol package. Very easy to drink, and won't sneak up on you the way some beers can."
"jd"
"O - Good session beer at 5.2%, and easy to drink. One of the best in the sampler pack from this brewery"
"Faint smell of yeast and malts. The flavors were similar but more intense. A nice feel in the mouth and at 5.2% would make for a great session beer, so high marks for drinkability. Not overly complex but enough there to keep me wanting to sip at it some more."
"I picked this one first from the sample pack simply because it was mid-day and it was the only bottle with an ABV less than 6%. Good choice. Nice (light) maple syrup color with decent carbonation (I also had the bottle foam over the top before pour). Malt and subtle floral hops in the nose. Initial taste was similar--very mild yet interesting flavors, though never any negative bitterness or off flavors. Nothing too complex but quite drinkable. I enjoyed it."
"Pours a pale reddish amber, filtered, with a tall, highly retentive head. Mild aroma of caramel, grains, and light fruit notes with moderate to subtle complexity. Has a pretty decent flavor, similar to the aroma, with aspects of caramel, well balanced--with grassy hops and some clear candy's poking through. Moderately full bodied, like a traditional authentic Belgian ale. Smooth through the swallow with a slightly dry finish. Living up to it's namesake as a Belgian pale ale, perhaps lacking a bit in ester complexity, but enjoyable nonetheless. Worthy of a spring or summer's eve."
"D: Drinks light and easy and is interesting, but I'd rather have an American Amber or Belgian Strong."
"Good, crisp and clean. Not my favorite offering from Belgium, but it still deserves some merit."
"Popped the top and a half second later the bottle started to spew. Lots of thick, stiff foam, with lace that would dry where it is. Color is a 9 on the SRM chart. Smells of malt, pear, apple, and more malt. Taste flavors of malt, and hops for the most part. Full and rich creamy feeling, very appealing. Nice change of pace, but a bit hard to find other than in a sampler. I would recommend it to a friend who likes more than beer from the big three."
"D- A pretty solid brew with a nice finish."
"11.2 oz small stubby Belgian style bottle into a snifter...typical amber ale color, not particularly impressive. Head is fine and appropriate for the style. Nose is decidedly in the style of American amber ales. Kind of malty nose, nothing unique in the hops to really sink your teeth into. Taste is about on par with a mediocre American Amber ale. From the bottle, I was hoping for an amber ale with Belgian yeast. It was definitely nothing that interesting. Congratulations Van Steenbredge, you've brewed a mediocre american amber and put it into a Duvel bottle. The only reason this beer is getting a B average rating on this site is the name of the brewery obscuring folks' taste buds. I'm sorry, but if your favorite American brewery had turned out this amber instead, you would be disappointed."
"Final Thoughts: I was very surprised by this one, it's been sitting in my fridge for a long time but I found it to be exceptionally good. It could use a bit more intensity but there isn't honestly much to complain about. Thumbs up."
"Drinkabilty - Its solid for a low alcohol amber ale. You could handle 4-6 of these but the weaker flavor doesnt do it for me. Its decent, id drink again but wouldnt buy or go out of way to get. Its a good starter belgium ale."
"D-it doesn't go down too harshly but for the style there are so many other acquirable beers I'd pick first. i imagine i could drink a few of these if i had to though."
"Easy enough to drink, but just very ordinary Belgian blonde/ pale character. It neither immediately gratified with refreshing character, nor invited cautious contemplation."
"drinkability; great session beer and tasty."
"D: The carbonation is a little high for it to be truly drinkable."
"Drinkability - This is a simple beer that brings a simple taste. Some nice aromas and easy to drink, there is nothing crazy about this beer."
"This is a simple, straightforward beer that lends itself to a lunchtime food pairing, going great with my apple, gargonzola, walnut salad right now. Sweet caramel and bread malt balanced by a sharp bitter dryness, hints of grass and apple, light lemon, touch of spiciness from the yeast. Drinks a little more to the American Pale Ale side than some, but the yeast profile, while not dominant, gives it away. Moderate carbonation, more on par than many others in this sixer. Hard to fault something like this for its simplicity, that's probably what the goal was and it's nice to have a quaffable ale at certain times."
"Decent enough. Fairly easy drinking and worth trying."
"Purchased as part of a mixed 6 pack. 5.2% ABV per the bottle. This is called an amber ale, but it is much lighter than expected. Pours out to a burnt orange, forming a voluminous poofy head which grows beyond the lip of the glass, like mousse. Carbonation is very brisk. Aroma of tropical fruit, spicy phenols, and metal. The mouthfeel is watery. effervescent with a thin spritzy body. The taste is kinda flimsy and a recap of the aroma. The bitterness is chemical in nature, non-descript, and pretty strong, overwhelming the other flavors.. Strong metallic flavor which overwhelms any subtle qualities of the beer. Despite these flaws, due to it's nice start and thin body, it's easy to drink."
"D - I could have this all night. Not something you need to pay too much attention to but it lends itself to session drinking and is quite refreshing and tasty."
"Light-bodied with sharp carbonation that makes this refereshing and easy drinking."
"Surprisingly very light in body. Well balanced between the sweet malts and the bitter finish. All in all a very drinkable brew that could be sessionable."
"Purchased as part of a 6 bottle brewery pack from the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a clear orange colour that starts off with big head that dissipates really quickly to almost nothing. Faint hints of lacing around the glass. Smells sweet, like a typical Belgian ale, but then also has some peppery spice. Flavour is quite dry, leaving almost no aftertaste. Aggressive carbonation, makes this a bit prickly to drink. An ok Belgian pale ale."
"D- Quite drinkable, and pretty light as far as Belgians go, but it didn't blow me away. While it didn't live up to my hopes, it still was considerably pleasant and I'd definitely drink it again. I'd love to see more of a ballsy version of this."
"Pours a copper color with a white head. Decent amount of lacing as it goes down. Nose brings some nice orange zest as well as caramel. The taste is mildly sweet with caramel and toffee. Some citrus and orange, though not quite as much as the nose. Feel is a bit light with good carbonation. Ever so slightly dry. Drinks pretty well and another good offering from Van Steenberge."
"Verdict: Not worth the price."
"Overall, a solid beer that I would buy again. Not sure I would pay a premium for this beer but it's still good."
"Drinkable, but have to echo the paring with food vs. session beer. Still nicely done and enjoyable."
"D: Very good, would like to drink this with dessert."
"I bought this in a sampler pack. Not the best of the group, but definitely worth drinking again."
"A very pleasant surprise, this Belgian Pale Ale is far crisper and cleaner than most Pilsners out there, and puts the majority of Lagers to shame. Wow. Definitely worth checking out if this is your thing, great hot weather beer."
"I don't like the looks of the peasant folk on the label. Windows up, kids! No matter, the liquidness inside pours a clear blood orange topped by a over a finger of white bubbly froth. The nose is kinda faint, comprising orange peel, hoppy florals, and that delightful Belgian yeast character. You know the one. The taste is pretty similar, holding notes of citrus zest, Belgian-tastic yeast, a small dose of saison-like funk, greenery, floral bitters, and a light background tinge of caramel. Bit heavy on the bitters, though. The body is a solid medium, with moderate carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. Overall, a nice BPA; a tad bit bitter, but smooth and tasty nonetheless."
"Drinkanility: Overall a good beer. Try it if you find it."
"Purchased this on a variety pack. Great deal. Pours red brownish. The head is fluffy white and as it drops it leaves some nice lacing. Aromas of light malts and some spices. Damp bread I would say. Starts off great and has a lingering bitter after taste. Quite appropriate forthis style. Enjoyable. Will go well with some fish and chips."
"nice fluffy head atop a light amber...smells of sweet fresh bread. mucho malts. though a 'pale' it still gives a yeasty, belgique sense. quite good, but nothing peculiarly weird or special. mouthfeel is nice and luscious. you could easily knock back a few of these quite drinkable ales. some pub food would definitely be in order."
"Watery, overly carbonated mouthfeel."
"This is a fun, interesting and relatively inexpensive Belgian beer, and drinking it was a unique experience. It does not at all deserve the reputation for mediocrity it seems to posess, in my mind."
"Softly carbonated up front with a strong spicy character that gives way to a malty center and long spicy dry finish. Hints of caramel malt, pepper, light fruit, cinnamon and brown sugar. It kind of tastes like a watered down Belgian interpretation of an Oktoberfest/Marzen."
"D: Rather complex blend of muted flavors a bit odd coupled with soury finish."
"A fairly sessionable brew, my first sampling of the Belgian Amber style. This was purchased in a mixed pack of Belgian beers. I'd drink this again."
"This is a solid brew that is a worthy part of the mix pack from this brewery."
"Bruegel Amber Ale Poured with a nice sized cream colored foamy frothy head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is malty, a bit yeasty and fruity. Flavor is like aroma with a little bitterness in the finish which makes it much more drinkable. Body is real full and carbonation is good too. Nothing real special for a Belgian ale, but better than most all other world amber ales that are trying to mimic this style."
"This bottle was left in my kegerator in December. I have no idea where it came from but I finally decided it was time to review it. Poured a stubby 11.2oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. When I cracked the cap, I only heard a faint psst sound as the CO2 is released and I'm thinking to myself ""Oh crap, its flat"". I was pleasantly surprised as I poured it. A nice 3 inch head erupted from the bottle leaving some nice soapy lacing as the beer recedes from my glass. The nose contains a lot of pale malts, a slight hint of apples and just a little butter. No real spiciness. The flavor is dull. Once again, pale malts dominate the profile with just a hint of fruit. Not much more. Just a vague hint of yeast. No much in terms of adding to the flavor profile, more along the line of yeasty biscuits. The mouthfeel is dry and unassuming. Overall, its just kind of meh. While BPA's have their place, its just not a style I really dig. Its a nice beer, but I wouldn't pick it up at a store."
"D: The combination of watery dried malt with the sour fruit finish and over light flavor with a bit too much sparkling water carbonation makes this a drinkable beer that I would have with a meal, but not one that I will soon buy again."
"Notes - With so many Belgian beers out there I figured there had to be mediocre ones and this is one of those."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts and fruits. Taste is good, malts and hops with some hints of fruit. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good brew."
"Beer is a little thin and light in the flavor department. There is a bitterness to it at the back but I was expecting a lot more up front in the way of some sweetness or other characters. I'm not sure what to think. Second taste, mild fruit flavors followed by the bitterness. Drinkability is OK, mouthfeel is a little too thin. Overall, its just OK."
"D - Very simple and light beer. Feels like it's too watered down and flavors are not as powerful as the should be."
"This beer could go overlooked because of it's subtility, but it's great balance makes drinking it, a great experience."
"A decent beer but far from being representative of Belgian brew. It's worth a try, but not something I'll be buying again."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer, very different from American and English pale ales that I'm used to. Very drinkable and, unlike many Belgian beers, this is good for sessioning."
"Feel and Drinkability: Medium in body with a good amount of carbonation, prickly and filling carbonation that cleans the palate after each sip and works perfectly with the drier finish that this one has. This beer is very easy to drink and would make a nice session beer. Very simple and straight forward. I like this beer, there is nothing real complex about it, its just very easy drinking. This is one that I'll be getting again. Definitely one I'd recommend if you need a break from real complex brews and just want something easy going and great."
"Pours a honey amber yellow color with a small peachy head. A nuttiness paired with a fruity Belgian yeast character sit in the nose. Candy sweet malt right upfront balanced nicely by a slight bitterness, other notes of apple and cherry. Light in body, well carbonated and very drinkable."
"The aroma is great, but the hop character is a bit aggressive for me in a belgian."
"Drinkability: A good beer and a great interpretation of the style. Not as good as Orval (my favorite Belgian Pale Ale) but still a very worthy brew."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color body, huge off-white head, pretty lasting. Fruity aroma, some hay and farm-like notes. Floral and Belgiany too, but those notes need to be inhaled deeper. Some banana. Clean taste, some pilsner like taste, corn or vegetable, but not in a bad way. Refreshing. Light taste, thin palate. Not very complex. A little bite, but not very spicy. Kinda bland. Not as good as a Sierra Nevada or Bass."
"(Bottle into tulip) Got this one as part of a 6 pack sampler from Brouwerij Van Steenberge. Poured a clear orange with a large white head that fell rather quickly. On the nose, you would think that this would be a very sweet beer, as the malt was heavy and there was a pleasant aroma that reminded me of raisins or dates. The taste, however, was rather sharp, and not really what I expected. There was a nice bite to it, and a little more of a bitter flavor, not near the sweetness of the nose, but not overpowering either. This was a nice crisp, refreshing offering and paired well with the spice I was having at the time."
"Taste is fruity and very Belgian. It has a distinct ambermalty taste that is a little sweet and has notes of honey. Some biscuity flavors which are a little like fresh baked cookies."
"Reminiscent of Pizzeria Uno Amber AKA Sam Adams Boston Ale."
"Refreshing, tasty, and *very* drinkable."
"The only loser in Van Steenberge's Belgian mixed six holiday pack, so I really cannot complain. While Bruegel is not so good, the value of the pack, at $16.99, was exceptional."
"Pours pale orange topped by a thick pile of foamy, white head. The fairly well retained head leaves behind a thick lace on the walls of my glass. Aroma of pear, funky rotting apple, mild caramel, and light herbal hops. I get the slightest whiff of alcohol from it. Tastes of pear and apple, finishes leafy and herbal; earthy and dry. Bitterness on the low side of medium. It somehow tastes rustic, or at least what I would imagine to be rustic. Medium bodied with a lively, fine carbonation. Satisfyingly simple; an easy drinker with down-to-earth charm."
"- an easy drinker"
"Yeah. Overall it's not offensive but there's nothing here that makes me want to go back for more."
"Pours a clear light amber/orange with more than a finger of white head that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Nose is a little yeasty and bready with a bit of clove and malt sweetness. Taste is slightly bitter both upfront and in the finish. Taste has some caramel notes to it and a bit metallic in the crisp finish. Medium to light feel with moderate amount of carb."
"Clear amber bodied ale, a large off white head forms thick with lacing surrounding my glass of ale without any problems. Aromatics offer up sweet caramelized alchol notes almost a butterscotch like quality, with a bitter dry leafy herbal quality. Flavor brings out pronounced alcohol and malt flavor combined with two layers of the typical Belgian style ale. A massive layer of stickiness is provided by the Belgian ales malt complexity bringing sugary layers to the surface, a very nice table beer. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a very dry herbal hop and caramel malt flavored finish...something that every drinker should expeerience at least more than once or twice. I love Van Steenberge and the Sharp Edge a local beer bar who got me into beer."
"D: This is a solid, paint-by-the-numbers version of a Belgian pale ale. Not entirely exciting, but it's tasty enough. Worth a try, but there are probably better options out there."
"Pours a clear, copper color. One inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, slight citrus, hops, and slight grain. Fits the style of a Belgian Amber Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of slight hops, citrus, yeast, and pale malt. Overall, a decent blend, but light in body."
"Pours a clear sopper color with a creamy slightly off-white head. Smell is of belgian yeasts, buttery bread and rasin/prunce like scents. Taste is slightly more agressive than nose, but follows same patterns... buttery bread, belgian yeasts, rasin/prune fruit notes. Creamy, nice carbonation, lighter side of medium bodied. Very good, lighter style Belgian beer."
"D -- Very easygoing, easily sessionable, enjoyable."
"This is not a Belgian beer out to kill and conquer, and it shouldn't be judged as such. Bruegel is your no-nonsense Belgian pale ale; eminently drinkable, likable, seemingly brewed with love, pure and simple. It's a typical example of its style, which is not to say it's average; it's just a fine, straightforward Belgian beer and that's that."
"Maybe someday I'll try it again."
"Conclusion: Not the best from this brewery by any means; the flavors don't really match up with the nice malty aromas, and the metallic twinge on the finish is kind of distracting/unpleasant."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable, but for the cumulative aftertaste of all that yeast. I don't know if this is just the bottle I got or if it is typical for this beer, but in any case it does detract a bit from the overall drinkability of this brew."
"I poured this beer before sitting down to reading Oliver Twist for my capstone. I was planning on sipping this beer for at least six chapters but I didn't get through three before I had actually finished the bottle! It's a very simple straight-forward Belgian Pale Ale. It pours a clear golden amber, with very little head and lacing on the glass, caused by my Goblet I'm certain. The smell isn't anything noteworthy, malts, yeast straight-forward. The taste again has nothing else to it really, very simple brewed beer. No need to mess with fancy ingredients like DFH here, no. The taste however is crisp and moderately sweet and Bruegel drinks really well. I finished the beer faster than expected just because you can tip it back and not really feel the effect of the alcohol or sit and focus on the different traits of the beer. It's simple and once more for emphasis, straight-forward. Not the most exciting beer in the world, I'd probably never purchase Bruegel again but I'm not disappointed I drank it either."
"this beer is excellent with a lot of earthieness to it! it poured off a nice crisping white head! and the the hoppy flavor came out but not as much as i would of liked! anyway i wont buy it again just due to the fact that its not really strong enough for me"
"D. What a nice find this is. A solid session ale here. Belgian pale ale, not really. More like a Scottish Amber Ale. The bottle claims it is a ""Amber Ale"" which I believe is more accurate. Whatever it is, its well balanced and pleasant drinking."
"D - Overall, this is average for a Belgian brew. I expected more flavor."
"Enjoyable and finishes in a well-balanced and predictably smooth manner. But the finish sums up and retains all the notable characteristics and carries them through to the end. Nice earthy, wood-laden suppleness to the back end."
"Not a bad brew but nothing special. Certainly drinkable but not a memorable experience."
"4 a pretty basic but enjoyable beer. seems more diginified than its marketing (thinking mainly of the flyer tucked into the six-box.)"
"D - It's not bad but everything just kept sliding down hill after the first few sips. Drinkability seems like it would be good had I got one that was fresher (I believe)."
"Yet another pale Belgian ale..."
"D: A tasty little amber ale from Belgium. One to pair, not to drink alone..."
"D - Easy to drink"
"BB June 5/09. Lovely one finger tan head floats over an amber red liquid. From the very bottom centre of the Chimay goblet emanate a furious string of bubbles shooting upwards. Good retention - covers the whole surface - although eventually retreats to a puffy marshmallow-like centre with lots of lace. Smell of toffee predominates, some caramel. Taste reminiscent of rye bread, caramel, nice bitterness at mid mouth with a malty finish. Good balance. Very nice overall and recommended; when I look at the other scores for this beer, I have to conclude it's seriously under-rated."
"Poured from the squat 11.2 oz. bottle. Clear amber with little to no head. Aroma is a bit clovey. Taste is weak and metallic. Some nutmeg and pepper; some grass. Watery and uninspiring. Would be best served ice cold on a hot day; then, this brew would be refreshing. Otherwise, a bit too much like a lite version of what it should be."
"M + D: Spritzy, assertive, and refreshing with a dry finish. Pretty easy drinking, and the lower alcohol content assists in keeping it that way. Not too bad at all!"
"Glad to have a chance to sample from the brewery sample pack of 6."
"This beer poured a light copper color with a single-finger head. The smell is bready malt with some candy-like sweetness. The taste start off with a mix of a dry cider and lemony citrus that gives way to a bit of spiciness. Not unpleasant, but a little one-note. The mouthfeel is a little watery with some moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just not going to blow anyone's mind."
"The second half of the beer complimented a slice of leftover pepperoni and onion pizza surprisingly well. I could definitely see have a good number of these (and getting a good buzz while I'm at it.)"
"Poured from one of the coolest looking bottles I have ever seen, a stubby 330ml with beautiful artwork on the label. Orange amber with a small,off white head that leaves some very fine lace on the glass. Smells like buttery toasted grain and honey. Tastes like buttered toast with an acidic bitterness in the finish. Lightly carbonated and lighter bodied. A nice beer that doesn't quite live up the the impressive packaging."
"Not the best beer, but drinkable. And hey, early pipes!"
"D - I don't know what to make of it. It doesn't seem like much, but I've had this before with food, and it was very interesting. It has the positive attributes of being light, dry and refreshing, not too high in alcohol - a lower-alcohol Belgian. Again, I don't know what to make of it. I suggest drinking it with food, pretty much any food."
"Notes: unfortunately the worst of any I have tasted by this brewer. All other brews by brouwerij Van Steenberge have been superb. This is from a sampler pack and maybe I got a bad batch. I would still highly recommend others by this brewer, including Augustijn, Piraat Ale and Bornem Triple."
"Drinkability: Pleasant and easily drinkable, but leaves you looking for a bit more."
"Pours a hazy gold with a small white head. Smells fruity, with a strong suggestion of plums and tartness. Taste is fascinating: big on the sour plums, green apples, hints of grapefruit, and some sweet malts whose sweetness can't quite break through the light pucker. It has a delicate tartness that I'm really digging. Medium body transmits and distributes the spectrum of flavors quite well. If tartness is not a quality you like in a beer then this one is not for you, but I personally consider Bruegel to be a very interesting, extremely pleasant beer."
"D- light and very drinkable"
"Mouthhfeel is kind of sour and ends on a dry note. Medium bodied, nicely drinkable."
"Poured a light amber color with little head or lacing. Smelled like perfume to me. The taste was sour, not at all what I expected from an ""Amber Ale"" as stated on the bottle. Sweet and malty as well, but more sour than anything. Moutfeel was average, and Drinkablility for me was not there, as I did not find the sour taste anything appealing. I'm glad only one of these came in the sampler pack I got for Xmas."
"11.2 oz stubby bottle slightly cloudy golden color with a short white head that faded quickly but left a lingering lace on the glass. nice aroma of fresh fruit. light fruity taste. light and dry mouthfeel with a slight tang finish. very enjoyable but only had the one bottle to sample."
"Notes from: 7/12/04"
"D: I'm mixed on this one. I didn't like it at first, but its sour flavor grew on me."
"Of the sixer I bought, filled with varied offerings from Van Steenberge, this is my least favorite. It's not a dud and is decent on the whole. Yet it lacks definitive characteristics, a ""gotcha!"" aspect. I wouldn't turn down one offered to me in the future, but I won't go out of my way for Bruegel."
"I got it in a sampler pack, so I don't know it's individual pricing, but I don't plan on buying it again unless it's cheaper than I expect it to be. I'm too poor to use Belgians as session beers."
"i believe this is my first amber ale from belgian, but who knows anymore, i'm almost at 300 reviews"
"This one is pretty drinkable and balanced not overwhelming in any direction of flavor."
" I really don't mind sour ale's, but i'm not sure that this is what they were going for!?"
"The sourness settles on the back and sides of mouth, give it a bit of a strange feel. On the front on the tongue, it settles more evenly. The low carbonation makes it more mellow in the mouth."
"One I may buy a few four packs of to keep around for company if they're not too expensive."
"Drinks okay, this one just seem pretty middle of the road for the style. More hops & malt base or both are in order here"
"Very good drinkability. I could easily enjoy a few of these both with a meal or on its own."
"Taste follows suit with moderately sweet malt flavors, a lot of carbonation, and a spicy finish with cinnamon and orange. Feel is OK though the high level of carbonation detracts a bit, and the drinkability is average. Good to try but a revisit is unlikely."
" Also, I agree with other's assertions that this is probably mis labled as a Belgian Pale Ale. To me it is a straight up Amber, as the bottle announces."
"Very watery mouthfeel."
"I enjoyed this beer, but not enough to go out of my way to have another."
"Medium-bodied with fine carbonation, the beer is drinkable, if decidedly unspectacular."
"This wasn't one of my favorites when I sampled it, the color was gold with a white froth head it kind of had a taste like apple wine with even less sweetness, smell was kind of like spoiled wine or vinegar. It had a nice clean bubbly feel and a crisp finish I liked. Unfortunately the overall taste was less pleasant and it made it less drinkable in my oppinion."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a damn tasty amber ale - just don't smell it!"
"D- With the other Belgies I've had, this I would not go out of my way for. Would not turn one down, but there are better ones out there"
"330mL bottle received as part of a Belgian gift pack at Christmas 2007 via the LCBO. Best before date in 2009. Pours a clear, medium gold with little head. Little aroma. First taste sensation is sparkling, although there is little carbonation seen. The sparkliness transforms into a moderate spiciness. A soft maltiness emerges as it warms."
"D - Not a fan. This was part of a mix pack from this brewery."
"Grade B/B-"
"D - Can it be? A low ABV Belgian with some pretty decent taste and sessionability? Yes, this is it! Very easy to drink and although there is nothing about it that smacks you across the face, it's very solid and well made."
"Note: This was part of the ""Global Beer Network 6 Living Flanders Ales"" 6-pack. Expensive, but an awesome opportunity. More brewers should do this."
"This beer is solid, but not one to rave about, perhaps seen in this quick review. As far as the Stubby Belgain Invite goes, there are two more beers remaining, and those should be the most fun. We'll resume play tomorrow night."
"Even with the late stumbles, the encounter was enjoyable. I'll give it another try, if only to provide an opportunity for redemption."
"I had to pour this one out half-way through the glass. I just couldn't get over the sour taste and the awful aftertaste left in my mouth. I would pass on this one if you expect more out of an expensive Belgian."
"Notes: Overall I really enjoyed this ale. It had a nice refreshing character that would work very well with a light lunch, sea food, mild cheese or fruit."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but it's not necessarily one that would be on my short list of beers that I would go right after."
"Got this one in a Belgian sampler and tried with fellow BAs Moxley and Hyland. I thought about nose greasing the head on this one, all 3 inches of it. When it settled it was a cloudy dark orange color with a musty dusty smell not too far from a wet attic. The taste was ""Eww, Nasty"". It was an acidic, overly carbonated, foul sour and dry combination that was really bad. It had too much carbonation and the flavor was strong and offensive. Maybe we just had a bad bottle."
"D- A good session beer due to its low alcohol if your into this sort of thing. Me im not a huge fan of amber ales but if i had to go with an amber, belgian would be the route i would take."
"MF&D- Too carbonated. Very dry. Overall not impressed by this one at all. Dont bother."
"Needless to say, I probably wouldn't have this beer again."
"Pretty average."
"Sort of a red/copper colour. Almost rusty, but not quite. Poured with very little head to speak of. First sniff seems a bit off. Musty, almost farm like smell. Reminded me of my grandfather's farm. I like it, but it seems a bit odd for a beer. Second sniff reveals more fruits. Citrus, red apples, and a bit of bread and honey. Very light taste. Sweet and simple. Some breads, malts, citrus and honey. No aftertaste at all. Mouthfeel is thin, light, and a bit crisp. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a bad beer. Perhaps average. Certainly better then, say, the offerings they have at the sports bar. But nothing about it shines, or pops. It's simple. It's something I wouldn't avoid, but definitely something I would not buy again."
"Drinkability : medium beer (style Belgian dark ale) brewered by Van Steenberge."
"Nothing too great, but nothing too bad, either. I'd have this again if it wasn't so expensive!!"
"d--I'm impatiently drinking this a degree or 2 above recommended range. Not finding too many flaws at this temp! Then again this seems like a simple, straightforward amber ale. Carbonation will make you burp, and it's a little filling for 5.2 ABV, but it's got an easy-drinkin' taste and is sessionable."
"A unique, tasty beer. This tastes alot like the very popular Fat Tire Amber - IMO."
"good drinkability, a good sort of middle of the road belgian pale."
"Bottle from LCBO as part of a Belgian mixed pack. Amber pour with a white film. Sweet, bready malts in the aroma . The flavour seems to be predominantly caramel malt, with a bready aftertaste. Not a beer that knock you over the head with extreme flavours, but a nice easy drinking session ale."
"From a short, stout, 11.2 oz bottle copped in a ""Six-Living-Beers"" Gift Set from Gary's in madison, this was the beer from the brewery with the lowest alcohol percentage... never heard of this beer or company before, but the price was right so decided to give it a shot... Pours a really nice reddish copper color with modest head... smell is fruity with hints of citrus and caramel... taste was good, very nutty with a rich, sweet, enticing taste that was smooth and not at all bitter... a relatively low alcohol percentage for the style, but a good brew nonetheless... easy to drink with a good mouthfeel, this would make for a decent session beer... Definitely worth a try..."
"I wouldn't come back to this one...unless it was in a big bottle (maybe)."
"And that's it. Try it if you get a chance, but there's better beers from this style out there."
"Overall, I wouldn't seek this out again, but it is a well done beer. Worth trying."
"Tastes similar to the nose, pale malt, yeast and fruits. Very clean and smooth."
"D: If this beer was any more boring, Id fall asleep drinking it."
" The full body holds the flavors well and puts forth a bit of creaminess - quite nice, actually. This ends up being a very drinkable ale. I'd get more if it were available in something other than the van Steenberge holiday package with five other beers."
"O: Enjoyable but not as complex as one would like... good for a few before getting bored"
"http://www.globalbeer.com/body_pages/pages-beer/Bruegel/Bruegel.html"
"D: Got this one in a sampler pack, so it's going to be hard to just get this individually. But, I'll try...it's that good, besides, anything from Belgium is worth drinking again and again."
"Tasty Belgian amber ale, very drinkable and smooth. Light bodied for a Belgian, recommended for fans of lightly hopped but otherwise flavorful ales."
"This is not the best Belgian I've had. In fact, I think it's probably my last choice. I don't know if the oxidized flavors and aromas are intentional or if this is a function of its age. Perhaps it would be better closer to the source (and fresher)."
"This is a brown beer  slightly cloudy, with a nice head that quickly dissipated. The aroma is of malt and caramel. The taste is unique. It is quite malty and has caramel overtones. There are some hints of spices and perhaps a bit of smokiness in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel is thin to medium. This is an interesting beer that comes together well, which makes it quite drinkable."
"Pours a copperish amber hue with minimal light-colored head. Aromas are primarily sweet, with a bit of candi sugar in there, plus some sour-fruit yeastiness. Not too interesting. On the palate, nutty amber malts and some doughiness remind me of a vienna lager or maybe a Yuengling, although there are more acidity and fruity esters here. A touch watery on the mouthfeel, with some astringency toward the end. Overall, a pretty mediocre beer. Not much in the way of complexity or one killer app. Bleh."
"drinkability suffers a bit on this one. after half a glass i feel like i've got heartburn. can't say i'll be going back for more."
"Overall: An interesting brew that displayed some unique flavor combinations. At times a bit too much going on. An average Belgium for me."
"Has a pretty neat taste, I must admit. Feels like it might be best as an autumn beer. But it also is neither dynamic nor amazing. Enjoyable -- something I'd be more inclined to buy to share with friends, than just for myself, the next time."
"Overall, I really didn't care too much for it. I wouldn't purchase again."
"Not much of a head, but did leave a ton of lacing. I'm more familiar with American style Pale Ales. Begain pale Ales are very different. This one is very good and very drinkable. Goes down so smooth with a great finish. Nicely carbonated .The color is gold and clear with no hazing or sediment. Has a refreshing finish that is only a touch of the bitter side. No hops in the taste or aroma. Taste is not too complex and either is the aroma.I prefer the American Style Pale Ale. This taste more like an Amber Ale. Other than very light sweet malts and a hint of a bread/grain taste there isn't much of a distinct taste."
"The Bruegal Amber is a good Belgian pale that came in a six pack sampler of Belgian ales. It pours clear dark amber without much of a head and a mildly sour, biscuity malt aroma. Based on the smell, I wasn't expecting much, but boy was I pleasantly surprised. This is a very drinkable beer that should appeal to a large variety of tastes. I cannot say that anything in particular really jumped out at me while drinking it. But by the time I was done, I was left hoping that there was another in my sampler."
"Poured a clear golden straw color with amber highlights, not much of a head, no lacing. The smell is of artifical butter, blah! The taste is buttery, caramel malt, no hop detected. The feel is light, almost watery, fizzy. This doesn't seem to be an amber ale (as stated on the label) at all to me. Almost tastes like a funky pilsner or macro. I have had this before and don't recall it being this poor. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"Drinkability- I don't care for Belgian ales. Having said that, this stuff is retty good. It has a nice aroma, the mouthfeel is right on, and the taste ain't half bad."
"Compared to its bigger cousins, this could be judged a little average - but it is a pleasant enough beer to quaff."
"Overall, this is a satisfying light refreshing and flavorful Belgian amber. Easy yet subtly mystifying."
"Could operate as a nice session beer (though is probably priced too high for that) or an introduction for the unitiated into Belgians. I could also see it paring well certain sharp cheeses."
"This is not a beer that I would drink often. For those new to Belgians, this might be a nice introduction. But for fans, I'd stick to the bigger stuff."
"This is actually quite an interesting amber. Let it sit for a bit."
"D: Very drinkable. Nice to consume and a solid beer for the style. Definitely have another, quite refreshing. Loved it."
"Poured an orange-amber leaving almost no head. The thin head there was vanished within a minute. Aroma was mostly malty sweetness -- some light fleshy fruits apparent in the nose. The taste was dominated by apples, pears and green grapes. Fruity to the point of almost seeming like a cider. Slightly dry finish, zero bitterness at all. Mouthfeel was thin and flat. Perhaps I served it too cold -- I imagine if I hadn't taken it straight from the fridge, there woudl have been more head and more carbonation. Definitely drinkable as a session brew -- goes down VERY smoothly and is quite refreshinng. But I'm not going to hunt for it either -- there are many better options to serve that purpose."
"Aroma dominated by the sharp twang of vinegar....off-balance in the mouth, too. However as the beer warmed this dominating flavor receded and became more of a nice background with caramel malt and mild hops in the foreground. However, sourness is definitely a defining feature of this brew. Fairly refreshing and drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light amber color ale with a big foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is a bit overpowering with too much sugar. Taste is also exceedingly sweet with no yeast characteristic and a light body that doesnt really hold up very well. I also didnt notice any bitterness as mentioned in the description. Definitely not something that I would seek again."
"Overall not too bad, certainly is worth a try."
"Poured out a clear golden amber color with good carbonation supporting a nice white head. Big time retention with competent lacing. The nose introduces some rich, buttery malt, and a hint of bubblegum. The taste is mostly a spicy malt, kicked up by a caramelized grain flavor. The finish is still sweet, bellied finally by faint hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, whisking away the cloying flavor of the beer before it starts to get on your nerves."
"Pours a cloudy brown/orange, loose off white head forms, settles to a thin layer with big bubbles, lacing all around, good retention. Smell is sweet, buttery, lots of citrus, some yeast and spice. Taste is weird, citrus acidity, some toffee, very weak finish, little bit of chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, acidic, some warmth."
"With this one I think ""creamy smoothness"". If you are in a non-bitter beer mood, this is one of the first ones you should try."
"Color of mud brown ; murky  good off white head - nose of sour grass , milk , fruity ( pears , apples , and apricots )  taste of sour fruits (apples (green and red) , pears , and apricots ) grassy , cereal , and spices - body is dry and lightly carbonated- aftertaste sour green apples , and apricots"
"Poured a decent golden color, with a moderate head. Smell was slightly fruity, with some caramel coming through. Taste was fuity as well, I'd say mainly apples, and maybe some pear too. There was a bit of a metallic flavor too, but not much. Very high in carbonation, which diffused as it warmed. I definitely enjoyed it on the warmer side though. I would try this again, but I think there are plenty others in this style that are better."
"11.2 fl oz bottle from a variety 6-pack obtained at Florian's in Auburn. Smells like butterscotch and band-aids... uh-oh... Somewhat murky yellow-red body with almost no head to speak of. Un-pleasantly astringent... Tastes like bad citrus mixed with diacetyl, or like cat urine smells. I must have a bad bottle... too bad too, since it's probably the only bottle I'll ever have. The first Belgian I've ever had to pour out... :("
"D - A little on the dull side if you ask me. Not a lot of complexity, not flavour in general, but what's there is inoffensive."
"Bruegel could honestly use a touch-up. While it may paint a picture as to what Belgian ales are all about it fails to capture the colourful, characterful artistry of most of that country's brewers. It's by no means that region's pièce de résistance, more like the high-school equivalent. Still, it proves that, as a group, the Belgians are one naturally talented group."
"Feels slightly creamy in my mouth, and that fruity smell comes through in the taste. Just a touch of hop flavor that's more noticeable once you've completely swallowed it...but you'll probably want to swish this one around a little bit before you do that. Very tasty stuff. I can imagine this going well with a slice of apple pie for some reason - or perhaps even a peach strudel."
"I would probably not waste any more cash on this one when there are much better beers staring me in the face."
"Taste is fairly sweet with a slightly odd metallic twang in the back. A dry hoppiness combined with a caramel smoothness that makes for an interesting trip on the palate. The nuttiness is there too, in the background. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but the carbonation isn't overbearing which is a big plus. On the whole a drinkable beer but not what I look for in a Belgian. A bit too mixed-up for my liking, too thin, too sweet."
"Drinkability is good for a warm summer's day."
"Medium amber in colour with average carbonation. Aromas of caramel and vanilla custard (an unusual combo, yet quite nice). More caramel and custeard in the mouth, along with some notes of dried fruit (especially banana chips), burnt sugar, and spicy Belgian yeast. Medium bodied, but on the light side for the style. This isnt one of those super complex high octane Belgians, but I still really enjoyed it. A Belgian session ale perhaps... if such a thing even exists?"
"(330 ml / 11.2 oz short squat fat brown bottle)"
"Deep brown look with a thick off-white head. Smelled a cidery, vinegar. Could taste a little caramel, apple, oak and a whole lot of cidery vinegar! I just may have gotten a bad bottle. But honestly I dug the taste! Overall it was good and I'd have another."
"-Oelergud"
"M&D: thin-textured and light-bodied... the beer is so uninteresting that it's way behind the standards of Belgian ales... I suspect its under-performance is to do with the over-chilled serving temp. But I still don't think it could be much better even it was served at the ideal temp. The balance and body are simply not there..."
"Murky desert sand in color. Ripe fruits, especially lemons in the nose. Fairly straight-forward flavor, very mild, not offensive, just not that good. Overcarbonated. Unnessassary acidity hurts this. Beware of this brewery. Van Steenberge is not very good."
"The Bruegel Amber Ale pours into the snifter as a cloudy amber color. There is minimal head presence. The smell is yeasty and malty, no indication of the hops. The taste mirrors the smell, in being yeasty (even though care was taken to decant properly) and malty. The mouthfeel is relatively crisp, with only a small residue sticking to the tongue. A tasty treat but not what I would consider a beverage with high drinkability. Give it a try!"
"11.2oz brown stubby bottle with no freshness date present. Pours a medium amber with a quickly fading 1 finger head and just so so lace. Good solid malt aromas. Earthy and some apple. Very malty tatse with a bit of a twang. Seems a bit watery. Not very hoppy. Just a very average brew. Not gross but nothing special either."
"I wouldn't seek these beers out or add it to my favorite list, but if they were around I could easily kick back and drink a few. This beer would probobly be pretty great with a meal, or at least better than it is on it's own"
"The carbonation is crisp and refreshing to the palate. Once again, I swear that this is a belgian Oktoberfest. It's good, but probably not worth its price considering there are some great [real] O'fests available for much cheaper."
"I got this as part of a 5-pack from the brewery for Christmas, and this is the first (and weakest) of the bunch. Looking forward to trying the others (like Piraat). I do like the Gulden Draak, so I'm optimistic."
"Reddish-copper, with a head that faded quickly into just lace and crema, but lasted for the whole glass. Mineral-water like carbonation that has a strong effect on taste. Starts off like a plate of honey and apples, finishes very quickly into a pepperey afterthought. Pretty light for a Belgian. Refreshing despite the thick, sweet, honey-like base."
"Clear, rich amber with a thin, cream coloured head. Some lace. Aromas of apples, brown sugar, yeast, and light spice. These carry over into the flavour profile, but with more spice in the finish. Balanced towards sweetness throughout. Medium to light body, strong carbonation, off-dry with astringency balanced by residual sweetness. Not bad and fairly easy drinking."
"Purchased at the LCBO in Sarnia Ontario in a mixed holiday 6 pack. Bright amber pour with very small wisp of a white head, carbonation level low. Malty nose sweet with syrupy overtones and some sweet flavor of honey. Crispness comes through in mid-section and finish. Aftertaste is medium length and inviting for more. Nice beverage."
"The beer-geek might wonder how this came from Belgium."
"A rather bland flavored Belgian 'amber'. Not enough going on here in terms of flavor to keep me interested."
"Overall = I don't have much experience with the style but this is pretty drinkable. I wouldn't want to make a session out of it do to the lopsided sweetness but drinking one is an enjoyable experience."
" A nice beer that falls short of being a great beer. Still this is certainly worth the ocassianal purchase. Nice ""first beer"" of the day. Also quite original."
"A non-descript beer really. Fairly subtle in flavor and feel, but pleasant enough. A worthy beer."
"This is a easy drinking amber. Although it isn't exceptional, the slightly unusual character of this brew makes it above average."
"Overall a nice and easy to drink belgian Pale, with nothing real special about it."
"This beer is light amber in color that keeps a nice thin head with minor lacing. I dont know if it was intended, but this one has a slight haze to it. It wasnt bottle conditioned, so Im not sure whats going on here. Smells a bit sour lie a Flemish with a powdered sugar sweetness. Maybe some coffee too, and some earth. The sour and the sweet carries over to the flavor along with a noticeable bread dough. Finishes smooth and leaves a vegetable flavor like limes and celery. Odd, but rather tasty. I must say, that I kept thinking that I was drinking a Lager. Very strange, but not in a bad way. The mouth feel is thick with sparse big bubbles that are actually quite a bit of fun. This is a very good beer, but its over all qualities are rather subdued. Nothing really stood up and got my attention, but good none the less."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a hazy amber with a small off white head that quickly disappears, leaves some lacing in my glass. Fruity, bready aromas, caramel and honey flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes a bit sweet, a bit above average amber."
"D - Well, it goes down easily. But the brackish bitterness and the slimy mouthfeel make for an awful aftertaste. At first sip, I thought I was in for a real treat, but that was hardly the case."
"11.2 oz bottle with no freshness date. Poured this one into my pint glass with moderate expectations. I am not a huge fan of Ambers, but I have not tried a true Belgian Amber, so I figured it was worth a try. Appearance was average with only a small 1 finger head that quickly disappeared. Smell was on the sour fruit side with minimal malt presence. Taste was initially lightly malt that quickly gave way to that unpleasant sourness that appeared in the smell. Mouthfeel was sharp almost puckering. I did not like this one at all, but I think it may have been sitting on the shelf a little to long; however, I purchased it in a Global beer pack and the rest of the offerings seemed to be plenty fresh."
"Bruegel Amber is an authentic Belgian pale ale. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good one. I do like it, but I keep expecting to like it more than I do. Just wait 'til it warms... just wait 'til the good stuff at the bottom of the bottle is added... just wait 'til... well, I'm still waiting. The bottom line: the masterpiece is on the label, not inside the bottle. Even so, it's still a drinkable, somewhat enjoyable version of an often overlooked style."
"Overall - An excellent ale. Very, very drinkable - well worth a try..."
"Drinkable and tasty. A very good Belgian Amber/brown."
"Tasted average to below average for an amber ale. I couldnt get over the aluminum taste . If that was gone it would be ok but I kept tasting bottle cap. super fizzy makes you have to cringe in the throat. sour finish. Not one I'll pursue again."
"From the Belgium sampler pack. 11.2 oz. Oddly shaped bottle. Pours a handsome, clear cherry red with a plentiful tan head with mixed bubbles that fades slowly. A very pretty color. No bubbles or visible yeast residue. Nose is hard to place. Definitely not a typical beer odor. A subdued hint of hops over perhaps a hint of cheese or vomit, but not entirely unpleasant. Initial taste is buttery/fruity. Type of fruit is debatable: I say apples. A pointed lack of acid. Rich, creamy mouthfeel. A very slight iron aftertaste. Quite drinkable, and certainly unusual. Overall, above average."
"Drinkability is very high with only 5.2% ABV and great flavor, blance and complexity.Sir! May I have another?"
"Bummer."
"Not surprisingly, this beer poors a hazy amber color with a sizeable cream-colored head. The smell is extremely faint and really not pronounced enough for me to even pick anything out... after practically dousing my nose with the beer's head I catch a whiff of brown sugar and yeast. It's subtle. The taste reminds me of sour apple or cranberry backed up by malt that hangs on the tongue as an aftertaste. Pleasant, not annoying, almost port-like. This is a new beer to me, so I'll have to drink a few more at one point or another. I'm sure I'll enjoy it."
"Very drinkable. I could see myself ordering a few more of these."
"Drinkability: Actually pretty good. I guess I disagree with the low rating overall from other people."
"Pours a muddied amber/light brown color with a fizzy beige head that subsides to a thin collar. A hint of sourness amidst a toasty malt base. Moderate fruitiness. Pretty smooth in regards to its light mouthfeel while maintaining an average body. Light suggestions of hard cider. About as tasty, if not tastier than De Koninck, but still lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. A nice ""light"" Belgian ale."
"Drinkability- My first of about 6 Van Steenberge brews I have waiting to try. Odd tasting brew that will take a few to get used to. Just plain different. Not bad though. I may try it again down the road."
"I guess a 3.5 overall does this beer justice. it's a fine belgian example, but then again, for the sake of a generic belgian style beer, there are better choices."
"A pleasant enough appearace, pouring out of it's stubby 330ml bottle. A bright, fiery copper, with an enormous eruption of ivory head. I have to pour a bit at a time or risk overflow. At least three fingers' worth. The aroma has that distinct belgian spiciness, yeasty and fruity, with a soft sting of floral hops. Musty belgian malt, candi sugar sweetness, and plenty of pear and banana. The flavor opens up muted, a bit lackluster. Muddled malt toastiness feels a little weak, moving aimlessly into a fruity middle, tinted with a bit of honeyed oxodization. Decent enough pear flavor, a little banana sneaking through. Some spiciness from the yeast, a bit of a phenolic cloviness, and a flicker of floral hops. Finishes watery and weak on the palate, with a bit of a banana peel bitterness way back in the aftertaste. Some cardboardy dryness, with strong champagne-like carbonation. Decent enough to try once, but nothing I'd go back to unless it were the local beer. It's possible my bottle was a bit old, but I got it at a reliable place."
"Aroma is pleasant, malty, slightly tart. Not complex. Flavor is sharper, more hoppy than expected, but balanced with slight sweetness. Tea-like astringency. Good beer, but not a knockout."
"A nice little belgain beer we have here. Pretty good."
"I had some pretty high expectations due to the bottle of this Belgian Ale, and I was kind of let down. Bruegel pours a clear dark amber color with virtually no head but a thin line of foam around the glass. I got this from the 330ml stubby bottle. The smell was wheat and malt with hints of honey, chocolate and nuts. The taste was similar, but no chocolate was detected. I felt there was too much carbonation in the mouth. I don't think I'll seek this one out again."
"Woww, first one from van Steenberge that pours out just fine. Enormous head and lasting. Bronze color makes the looks more then al right. Nose is litle malty but mostly sour and unpleasand. Taste is ruined by the ernormous amount of CO2. Sour en tasting like its been infeted by an high fermenting( no Brett) yeast. Hardly any hops at the end so just a sour taste hanging for quiet some time. Might otherwise be ok, but for tonight a pour out."
"Pours a amber/orange colour with a frothy white head. Good lacing. Body is clear. Some fruit and spice in the nose. Taste was alright. Some malty sweetness, fruit, diacetyl, hints of caramel. Finish is dry. Could use a little more balance, but overall a drinkable ale."
"Modestly hazy, amber-gold in hue with significant tawny influences. The liquid is polluted with bubbles; there is an insane amount of carbonation racing towards the oversized off-white head. I couldnt fit all the beer in the goblet due to the massive head (easily, there is three fingers worth of foam). In a moment the head faded to a moderate cap that lasted the entire consumption. There was tons of subsequent lacing, massive globs of residue. Overall the appearance is pleasant. The nose doesnt say much; all I get is lightly spiced marshmallows with some equally light fruity notes (tropical in nature). Hints of toasted caramel too. I like what I smell but I need way more aroma and complexity for me to deem this beer inviting. Simplistic. The palate is yawn inducing. I drink and I drink I think and I think. What do I taste? Anything of note? I sense some sweetness like marshmallows. There are some soft spicy notes, basically nondescript however. Orange peel. There is some bittersweet candy that ends on a dry note. There seems to be a very weak suggestion of caramel. Fruity flavors are characterless. Light bitterness. The modest level of alcohol is hidden, as it should be. Cleaner than Id like, where is the dirty yeasty funk? Basically this beer is a session ale, Belgian-style. That is cool I suppose but this beer doesnt impress me much. It is too bland for me to be compelled to drink more than one of. Maybe this beer would be better suited some other time, maybe not. The palate, on the whole, is fair. Medium in body, creamy, filling carbonation that produces a mouthfeel that is enjoyable but its nothing special. It does fit this beer well though. Drinkable? Sure, I guess. I mean why drink it? A session beer should have more flavor, period. A low abv is a must, done. A tasty quaff is a must too, not done. No matter how I look at this beer it is just okay nothing more, nothing less. Honestly, I dont dislike it yet I dont like it either. I was so unimpressed I finished my glass with a bologna sandwich. It is an average beverage. I purchased this bottle as part of a sampler-pack in Ames, IA."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3"" light tan head (sno-coning above glass rim) over the VERY effervescent amber brew. Head lasts a long, LONG, time, and laces with huge hunks of foam most everywhere. Somewhat generic spicy Belgian aroma, which isn't necessarily bad, but doesn't set itself apart. Taste is upfront a bit tart, fading to sweet malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability both excellent. SO drinkable once the head comes down to earth."
"Overall: Above average Amber Ale that drinks well. Good for what it is - essentially a Belgian Session Ale."
"Pours an amber with and off white head that has good retention but doesn't lace much. Aroma of caramel and some lighter malts, almost like an English Bitter. Taste was some malts, caramel, slightly tart, with a clean hoppy finish. Rather thin mouthfeel, again like a bitter. Rather good, I'd drink a few if I had them, but compared to other things this brewery has to offer, I'd rather move on."
"This is a finely balanced Belgian Amber which is really rather drinkable, on any occasion."
"Mouthfeel was a little thin, and the aftertaste was a bit too sour for my liking, although the hops really started to come out as it warmed up."
"330ml belgian stubbie bottle. This ale poured a reddish orange with a tight off white frothy cap that retains well. Fruity boquet in the nose...some slight sweet and sour effects. medium bodied...sweet without cloying and a distinct tart-peppery apricot tone to the taste mingles with doughy malts...finishes well going dry and a tad bitter...certainly one of the more drinkable belgian ales with a nice unique taste."
"Pours a copper orange color with a good head and plenty of lace patches. The aroma is malty with bran notes of all things. It actually kind of smells like Raison Bran cereal. The taste is also quite bran-like, with some caramel and diacytel as well. The flavor is a little bland with only subdued hop notes. The mouthfeel is full and very smooth with lots of tiny bubbles. This beer is ok, but a bit wanting in the flavor department."
"Wow! This little, Belgian pale surprised me. Absolutely lovable. Drinkability suffers a bit from the massive, overcarbonation, but the patience is more than worth the trouble. This has an excellent meld of flavors, and I plan to stock up on a few of these. Low hops and low alcohol make this a poor candidate for cellaring, but I could enjoy a couple of these every day."
"Very light amber with a gorgeous creamy head that last a long time. Light malt presence in the smell with some light fruity elements. Also, a bit of a witbier aroma was present. Taste is light with a smooth malt presence that ends in a beautifully dry finish that leaves a touch of bitterness that is refreshing. Very smooth on the drinkability scale. A very nice brew overall."
"A good beer. Comes in a .33ml brown bottle, part of a 6 pack sampler from Brouwerij Van Steenberge. Big pour on the head side. A true amber color. Wheaty and fruity smell. A sweet and dark beer, where hops has taken a back seat to the malt profile. Not light, but not heavy either. Give it a try."
"Beautiful color, burnt sienna. Standard Belgianish yeasty smell, nothing special. Taste is very acidic, very standard otherwise. Very, very foamy in the mouth. Not worth trying again."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice refreshing pale and crystal malt scent with a fruity Belgian yeast finish. The taste is good. It is light and goes down easy. The flavor is a little tart along with a light amount of sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a fine Belgian amber. The flavor and aroma are both good; a fine sessions brew."
"Orange-brown with quite a bit of long lasting head with good lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty. Flavor is malty without much sweetness. Bitterness is minimal, but provides a very crisp, dry finish. Spicy throughout, and the sensation is amplified by the strong carbonation. Mouthfeel is just a bit light, but overall the beer is very drinkable."
"This is a brown colored brew is cloudy with a creamy white foam head on top. Scent is slight candy sugar. Sweet malts, some hop bitterness. Some spicyness. A medium bodied drink. A very smooth beer. It doesnt really strike me as that good or bad, could be worth a try."
"Very drinkable, I will buy again."
"Notes: Wow this is a tasty little amber ale from Belgium. The plate of grapes, apple and mild cheeses went great with this brew. Certainly more of a pairing brew rather than a session brew."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy deep brownish-orange color with 4 huge fingers of head. There is lots and lots of lacing left on the sides of the glass. The smell is very sweet and fruity, with orange and banana. It is a good malty aroma. The taste starts sweet and malty with fruity esters, and some bread. The finish is slightly tart, not bad. Almost no hops present in the taste. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is also very good, at only 5.2%. Not a bad Belgian Pale."
"This beer came across as tinny tasting. There were some hints of what you would expect from a decent Belgian  a little spiciness, some fruit  but not enough to redeem the beer. Kind of a shame 'cause it actually looked pretty good in the glass."
"Light feel, crisp, an easy drinker."
"If a huge head, then a yummy root beer float. Some molasses in there? Second ferment in the bottle. An average beer from this world class brewery. Sweet taste followed on by tart and peppery spice and fruit, then long and dry aftertaste. Try just before meat dinner in lieu of wine."
"This sucker pours a massive head-looks like a root beer float-brownish amber in color. I can't tell much about the nose, as the head is so thick and dense, that the aromas can't break through. Clean and crisp in the mouth with only moderate levels of flavor-odd? I get some malt, a faint spice note, and some dilute breadlike flavors, but there really is not much going on here. There is very little in the way of hop character. A pleasant enough beverage but nothing inspiring here."
"Pours a cloudy light copper hue under a big contoured off-white head with great retention but not much lace. The nose is light and fruity sweet, while the mouth is prickly and light. The taste is classic francophone sweet, with fruits and spices that mask the malt and hops. (Masking out two of the core ingredients of beer is not a good thing in my book.) The finish is sweet, as is the aftertaste. Sweet, sweet, sweet. If I want sweet, I'll drink coke."
"Highly carbonated, hazy red-brown in color. Very big head that takes a while to go on. Smells of apples and a little alchol. Taste is very complex, but a little muted. Again, tastes a little like a cider, but more of a burnt flavor. This was in a belgian sampler pack, and if this is the quality of all beers in the pack, it will be well worth it."
"Opaque bright brown, a mountain of bottle conditioned rocky head in a Schell German Pale tulip glass. Lots and lots of lacing properties. Slightly lemony and estery aromas, background yeastiness and honey. Light body and effervescent carbonation. The taste leans towards lime citrus and considerable astringency...drying starts early and the brew finishes with its signature carbonation but relatively little flavor. Brewed at a low ABV, this one doesn't get me excited, sort of like a Lemon/Lime soda with alcohol."
"This beer is a mixture of a pale ale and a hefeweisen in taste. Not that great."
"Mouthfeel is almost violent with that fizzy attack on the sences."
"Drinkability  This went down in typical Belgian fashion. It was a little lighter than I had expected, but a good ale nevertheless."
"I'm disappointed with this beer. Great looking, not so in the taste department."
"Pop the top and you had better be ready with your glass on this one. It pours to a golden-orange color with a thick, rocky tan head. The aroma is clean with a smell of flowers and fresh cut hay. The flavor is clean and floral with herbs. It is herbal/medicinal in both aroma and flavor. It is very light and easy drinking. A tasty light flavored beer. A very good brew."
"This beer poured an amber color with a thin head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is yeasty and sweet. The taste was malty and sweet. The malts stick with you throught the aftertaste. Very nice beer. I would love to have this one again if I can find it."
"A nice, albeit fairly average, amber. What it lacks in its appearance and overall dimension of character ... it makes up with its drinkability. The crisp, refreshing and basic flavours are welcome."
"The Amber poured a light copper color with a haze. The head was lighter than expected, but remained constant throughout the sample and laced on the sides of the glass. Very sweet, yeasty aroma was strong for an amber. Thin malt flavor, but it lasted on the tongue. The yeast flavor was a little too strong even though I took care to not pour the sediment into the sample. Good carbonation. Overall the amber scored lower than expected, but I will sample again in the future."
"Medium amber color, large head. Aroma is nutty and sweet. A lighter bodied amber ale. Not very Belgian like. Lightly roasted malts, slightly hoppy. Somewhat spicy. Bright yeasts. Clean taste. Mild flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty."
"It drinks well. It is crisp and it finishes quite well. A bit too sweet for me."
"First of all - stand back from this bad boy when you pop the top, lest you be eaten by the blob. This monster produced one of the biggest, most unstoppable heads of ivory foam I've ever seen. Just would not stop and it took nearly ten minutes to get it in the glass. The smell is great - yeasty and malty with a few caramel and fruit notes as it warmed. The flavors tend to be a bit tart and yeasty, decent enough, but not awe-inspiring. Somewhat thin on body and fairly drinkable. A decent ale to try again down the road."
"It's unique for the style and worth trying for posterity's sake. Nothing much stands out here except for the carbonation level, which can lower drinkability if you consider how many of those bubbles will be dancing on your head in the morning."
"Pour very slowly, it was very foamy which had a hazy yellow orange color and loads of tight foam and heavy retention from start to finish on side of glass. The smell of yeast with a since of a brut champagne. The taste was not fruity but had an contemplative bouquet firm body, profound hop bitterness and a short, dry finish."
"I must of moved the bottle too much because it opened as a boy beer. Nice mix in aroma a yeastiness, slight malt and some phenol. (Jason noted Juicey Fruit which a caught a whiff of). Big full head Attractive appearance of amber with orange, mostly clear with some slight cloudiness. Flavor has many of the same qualities as the aroma, esp. the yeasty quality, banana with the phenol, enough malt backing, with a short slightly dry finish. Their is a thinness to it that's unusual for where it came from. Makes it easier to drink. Mouthfeel is improved with nice contribution of carbonation and softness. Nonetheless, enough complexity to qualify as a decent Belgian, just there are others that are much better overall. Still, several of these could make a fine evening."
"A clear, dark amber/copper body is topped by a full, pillowy white head that holds exceptionally well and keeps a thin creamy surface covering throughout the goblet. The nose is pleasantly yeasty, somewhat earthy and a touch fruity. It's light body is boosted by a vibrant carbonation. It's lightly zesty on the tongue at first, but becomes a bit creamier as you progress through the glass. The flavor is softly malty with a bitterness that makes itself known, but goes no further - perfectly balancing the beer and leaving a refreshingly dry finish! A good example of a basic Belgian pale ale that's easy to drink and refreshing; but one that may seem thin when compared to others."
"Pours with a fierce head, took ten minutes just to empty the bottle. Head is thick and frothy but leaves little lace. Cloudy yellow color not at all amber looking. Quiet tasting, light malt and light hoppiness not bad but disappointing for a Belgian."
"On my second visit with this beer, my opinions didn't change much. I discerned a fruitiness in the finish, found the palate to be smooth and refreshing, and complimented the balance. Moreover, I recognized the folly in my facetious remark, and realized the beer for what it is meant to be : a light ""peasant"" beer. Your party's over pretty quick if your beer is something like Gulden Drak, and same for your aspirin supply! Of course, they drank a lot of it, they're REVELLERS. At least they had better beer than you'd find at a contemporary American house party, where you're likely to guzzle on a High Life, or sumpin'."
"A great looking beer. Pours a slightly hazy orange-amber color with a huge custard-like head. My daughter walked into the room right after I poured, saw the beer, and said ""ice cream!"" I keep a long handled spoon with an opener on the other end by my computer and she grabbed it in hopes of getting a spoonful on the head. Yeasty aroma at the front followed by fruity (apple?) notes. Smells a lot like a Heffe-weisse. Pretty light tasting, fruity with a slight bitterness. Cloves are present too, very hefe-like. Decent mouthfeel with good carbonation. Pretty drinkable, but not as complex as I was hoping for."
"Monumental fruity nose dominated by fresh lime but carrying hints of berries and apple. The lime is hauled into the draught but is soon unloaded to make room for a pleasant malt and hop balance that lingers until you push your face into the glass anew. Charged, not choking, and strikingly unique."
"Pours a light copper/orange colour topped by a thick beautifull head. This beer has an excellent appearance but i think that that's just it. It's a shame really such a beautiful beer to be ""killed"" by the taste and aroma. Taste and aroma are average and maybe below average in comparison with other European pale ales. Brewery Van Steenberge is one of the best and most known breweries worldwide and i'm surprised that this beer comes under this brewery. And again this is just my humble opinion, i don't want to take anyone with me ;-)"
"True to its name, this beer is an extremely attractive amber in color.  Mostly clear, very well carbonated, with a medium-sized, slightly foamy head. The aroma is fruity Sweet and slightly tart.  Hints of yeast.  Flavor demonstrates good hop presence from start to finish.  Overripe strawberries and a milt malt sweetness come in mid-palate, with a slightly dry but balanced finish and a pleasant bready aftertaste. Effervescence gives this a medium-light seeming body.  I grow fonder of this beer the longer I let it warm, and by the end am quite ready for another."
"A great looking beer. Pours orange-copper with a huge, creamy, frothy, chunky head. Lots of lace clings to the glass. Aromas of yeast, fruit and pepper. Light to mediu, body with a smooth-creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat bland flavor, not much too it. Has hints of tarty citrus and fruit with slight spice. Finishes dry and metallic. The metallic taste lingers for a while and makes you reach for something to help get the taste out of your mouth. Bit of a let-down after such a lovely appearance. Disappointing."
"The color and it pours from the bottle unclouded amber with a planetary sized head that is creamy in texture and it slowly erodes a thick and sticky sheet of lace forms to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt with a nice hint of caramel and an over ripe fruit aroma also noticed. Start is lightly sweet, malt, top is slight, the finish is adequately hopped, acerbic, long lasting dry aftertaste."
"Slightly above average Amber Ale. Thick lively head, orange/caramel color. Clean taste with a dry, somewhat bitter finish. I had trouble detecting much aroma in this. There are a lot of better Belgians out there."
"Beautiful looking beer!  Orang-copper with a huge, creamy head.  Lots of CO2 apparent in the body - perhaps too much carbonation.  Nice aroma of fruit, peppery spice, and yeast begin to make my mouth water...The taste, however, isn't that great.  It's not bad, but like a few others, I was expecting a bit 'more' (for lack of a better word).  It's a bit bland, really.  Has a very light tart and fruity taste with a very dry, but slightly spicy and metallic finish.  All of that carbonation gives this brew a very rough and almost acidic feel on the tongue.  It's certainly a drinkable brew, but even if I had another I think I'd reach for something else."
"This amber/orange brew throws a nice, dense rocky head that is well retained.  Belgian lace is nice.  The nose consists of yeasty breadiness and herbal spices.  The mouthfeel is very carbonated, almost like a champagne.  Body is light to medium.  And the taste is very neutral.  I like the spice touch.  Seems to be spiced similar to a wit:  orange curacao and corriander.  Also get a slight toasted quality with subtle yeast tones present also.  The drinkability factor is pretty average due to the high carbonation."
"Bruegel Ale:  Great looking beer, with deep copper haze, and a huge, huge head  (three inches over the rim!)  Nice citrus/Weiss/yeast aroma, not overstated.  I liked this beer, had nice malt sweetness, with citrus flavors in the deep background, and a clean dry finish."
"Golden abber in color.  lots of very small bubbles and a big white head.  Sweet yeasty nose.  The taste disappoints in relation to the appearence.  Not much body and it lacks the yeast character other begians have.  There is also a slight metalic finish to the taste.  This brew misses the mark."
