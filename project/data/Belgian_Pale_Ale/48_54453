The alcohol is well-masked, and while the flavour profile is suitable and not at all offensive, this still strikes me as a forgettable Belgian pale ale. There just isn't anything jumping out at me about this one, for better or worse. I'd certainly consider having this beer again, and would consider it at least worth a shot - but don't expect anything more than a serviceable Belgian blonde.","thehyperduck","Dec 22, 2014"

3.33,-10,3.75,3.75,3.25,3,3,"Overall I thought this beer was ok at best and I thought it was an average at best example of the style, it didn't really have an aspect that set it apart from all the other average Belgian Blonde Ales and there wasn't any aspect about it that I thought was really well done. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth, very crisp, pretty prickly, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my interest, one is more than enough for me, I figured that out before I got half way through the bottle, the sweetness and super high carbonation would prevent me from even thinking about drinking another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they seemed to be the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness and the high amount of carbonation, they both need to be toned down a good amount. I wouldn't buy this beer and I wouldn't recommend it either, it's not hard to find a much better Belgian Blonde Ale. All in all I wasn't impressed with this one, it just didn't have what it takes to be a great example of the style and It was hard for me to get over how prickly it was. I think this is now one of my least favorite Belgian Blonde Ales. Piraat is still my favorite beer from this brewery and this now my least favorite. Better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me.","StoutHunter","Apr 22, 2014"

This pours a slightly hazy golden light brown color with a massive off white head which is slowly dissipating right now, this leaves a lacing. The smells are of fruity belgian yeast esters, a little citrus. The feel is medium high carbonination. The taste is okay, like many of the other beers from this brewery, it suffers from a high alcohol content which isn't well masked and gives this a certain boozy taste, under that you get some nice citrus like hop bite, a dry finish, not bad.","DavidST","Jan 07, 2013"

3.26,-11.9,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"11.2oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a translucent, golden-orange with a rocky, two inch, bright white head that slowly collapses in on itself. Head eventually settles into a frothy cap with thick, textured clusters of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses tangerines and a suggestion of candi sugar. There's also a trace of clove and a slight metallic quality. Taste is somewhat bland and also reveals a wet cardboard character as well as a bit of grassiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, palate cleansing carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, a fairly lackluster BSPA - not something I need to revisit again.","Jwale73","Dec 31, 2012"

Check your Belgian expectations at the fridge door and you'll do fine with this bottle. Don't expect much fizz (which is good); don't expect much bite (it could use a bit more) and don't expect to drink it quickly (because you have to wait for the dense head to dissipate). Do let it get warm, as that brings out the fruityness that is so remarkable about this beer. Not bad for a single.","gfreed","May 15, 2012"

It seems that there is too much yeast and it has gobbled up all the flavour to make that high alcohol taste which isn't being masked well enough by the rest of the beer. I'm gonna say you'll want to pass on this one.","TheHammer","May 17, 2010"
