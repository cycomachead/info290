"An average belgian ipa.  Not a lot of aroma.  Has a nice belgian yeast flavor to it.  About average overall."
""
"Pours a light amber with not a lot of head. The smell was very subdued but had some nice grapefruit scents to it. The taste was a bit mellow throughout with some hop flavors on the end, but little Belgian wheat or other flavors. Not bad, but I like a lot of their other beers more than this one."

"Overall- not a bad beer, my first  from this  brewery."

"DOB 11/18/14, 12 oz can poured into a pint glass, hints of Belgian flavors, subtle, unique flavors. Very drinkable and enjoyable from DC Brau."

"As A bros wrote  "" complex, this is not one to just knock back as each sip peels back another layer of flavor."" True. Upgrade!"

"Nice aromatics.  Malt dominant on palate, which is not what I was expecting from a Belgian pale."

"The malt sweetness and yeast hits right away. A little bit of honey and citrus aroma. Heavy but went down easily despite the 7% ABV. Mouthfeel a bit ""sticky"" for lack of a better word. Could have used a tiny bit more hopping for balance - I expect any Belgian-style to emphasize the malt and yeast more than the hops, but it was almost *too* sweet. I'd still buy it again, though."

"Thanks go to Treyliff for this trade!"
"Pours a dirty blonde color with little to no sediment. The beer is cloudy and unfiltered. The aroma full of Belgian candi sugar, bubblegum and clean alcohol. In the taste, brown sugar, candi sugar, wild flower honey and a fruity Belgian yeast kick. A little bubblegum is there in the flavor too. Medium bodied, medium high carbonation. Overall, a nice Belgian pale in a can."
""

"Prost!"

"Poured a hazy deep orangey-gold. Initially has a creamier white head that reduces down to slight presence around the circumference of the tulip glass. The aroma is mostly yeast with a hint of caramel. The taste has a nice tangy-ness to it, reminiscent of the way sourdough tastes. There are also some subtle fruit notes hiding in the back. There's a nice thickness to it and it's quite smooth. A very good Belgian-style pale ale."

"As some other reviewers have pointed out, the date on the bottom of the can is not helpful. Mine says ""Drink Me! 3/18/2014"" so does that mean drink by 3/18 or born on 3/18? I don't know. Bottom line, I was not impressed, and did not find this beer enjoyable in the least bit. Come on DC Brau, I know you can do better."
""
""

"Too thick, carbonation to low, sweet with some lime and pepper...but complexity and interest here on the low end of the scale...I believe this is my first DC Brau, and I'm not overly impressed.."

"Slight tart as when the beer started to warm, the fruit came out. Creamy mouthfeel."
""

"Thanks, Dave_Treat, for the opportunity"

"Overall Meh, syrupy candy malts, hops are not great, ester profile swings too far, just all around not so good."

"A very smooth BPA with tons of banana action."

"Too bad I have to end my DC Brau sampling on this one. I'd rather have passed."

"On the fuller end of medium body with tight carbonation, earthy hops and a prominent peppery spice presence that lingers over the bready yeast, pale malt and light fruit notes into a dry finish. Thankfully this beer tastes more interesting than it smells but the yeast presence is a bit too strong for my preference and it feels more like a wheat/witbier than anything else. Some zesty coriander and grassy, piney hops followed by sourdough bread, bubblegum and lemon zest. Slightly tart and somewhat refreshing but a bit watered down and pedestrian. As it warms, the ester-y light fruit notes start to show with hints of apple, pear and raisin. Still, this beer isn't very complex or interesting. Not bad by any means, but it just doesn't stand out. I'm glad that I only bought a single can."

"O- The yeast and the malt dominate this one. It's very different than almost all of the BPAs I have had, but not necessarily in a bad way. It's just different. I probably would not get it again, but I didn't hate it."

"Verdict: A pretty poor attempt at a Belgian Pale Ale from DC Brau. It has bad balance, lots of unpleasantries, and has few redeeming qualities. While I enjoy their hoppy beers, I might be staying away from their Belgian beers until further notice."
"O - Taste is not at all what I expected but I dig the sourness"
"This is a tough style to do well; especially given the availability of so many Belgian masters. Drinkable and refreshing but this one needs more work."

"Poured a cloudy yellowish gold with two finger head that stuck around a while and left a lace ring. A rather airy, nondescript aroma but I do pick up some spice and grain and touches of bready malt and citric. The yeastiness in this beer helps make it smooth and easy to drink without becoming watery, but I found that the sweet malts are minimal at best (don't expect alot of candi sugar or tropical fruit sweetness or caramel) and that the hops and fruit flavors mostly give off a slightly bitter or acidic crisp bite and offer up some decent citric notes but not too much else. Decent balance so it's not overly sharp or acidic but just one of those beers that seems ""watered"" down for more mainstream consumption and it was alright but not worth having again."
""
""
"At yeast we have our health."
"Not a game changing by any means and as someone said - the lack of bottle conditioning really harms the impact of this beer but don't let that turn you away. It's a great session beer that's perfect for a hot day or a bbq."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not great, unfortunately. There's little here to make me want to come back for seconds. All this does is confirm my skepticism toward canned Belgian-style ales - without bottle conditioning, what do you have? Not much, really."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with 1 finger of head. Aromas of Belgian yeast ever so slightly with macro notes...corn I guess. Taste is simple Belgian yeast that has been dumbed down...its so subtle. Meh, its ok, easy to drink and normal...meh. There is nothing amazing about this brew, its just a super sessionable BPA."
"Nice hazy honey colored ale with a solid sheet of fine whites atop. Smells like grain, sweet grain, pears, flowers, some grass and a little biscuit. Smells fresh, I dig that. Flavor is sweet initially with a good floral character with some juicy fruit, some grain and dough. Like the flavor too. A little fuller bodied than I'd dig, but with the softened carbonation, it has a nice feel overall and an unobtrusive finish. Nice beer, surprised and satisfied."
""
"Aroma is yeast driven, estery pear/banana and spicy white pepper. Similar flavors, some banana and pear sweetness, dry spice in the middle that lingers long into the aftertaste with some light residual bitterness. Creamy feel with ample carbonation, medium bodied and smooth. Overall a nice BPA, pretty flavorful and drinkable."
""

"Overall, I thought it was a very nice beer. Refreshing, nice flavor, and very drinkable."

"Not sure if it was the execution or just an odd collection of ingredients, but this one didn't really mesh the flavors well. Too many distinct flavors popping out on their own, seemingly out of place, rather than molding together to form a nice, coherent flavor profile. Far from awful, but probably not something I'd seek out again."
"Got this as a free sample from the boss, score! Serving it chilled. Poured this one in my Maudite tulip. Deep golden color with a nice white head. Smells of the tell tale clove, banana, biscuit, pear. Taste had a great tartness that really appealed to me. It was smooth and really drinkable. Notes of tart cherries, biscuit, yeast, and grass."
""
"Overall – A niceBelgian that has a taste profile in between that of a Belgian session and a triple. Quite tasty."
""
""
"o: I tend to prefer a drier bpa, a fine beer, but not a favorite from the brau"
"O: 4.5 - although I'm not crazy about the generally non-committal ""Belgian pale ale," definitely approachable and refreshing, especially as the temperature warms in the greater D.C. area; although not their best offering, this is a solid flagship beer from my favorite local brewery...Prosit!"
"Normally not a big Belgian Pale Ale fan, but this is pretty good! Nice ’n hoppy with a good Belgian yeast presence."

"A robust “Abbey” ale yeast strain created this brew, so it has the traits of a bigger beer without a massive amount of alcohol. Very complex, this is not one to just knock back as each sip peels back another layer of flavor."
"This is an easy drinking beer, light but tastes decent. The abv is hidden very well."
""
"A decent beer all the way around. That this is a flagship for DC Brau says a lot about the brewery. Worth trying and a real sessionable beer despite the rather high abv."
""
""
""

"O - The Citizen has a great opening aroma, boastfully showcasing it's Belgian yeast intricacies but it can't hold it's air and it's puffy chest deflates to reveal some imperfections which hinder it. Not entirely off-putting but present enough to draw attention away from the other great characteristics going on, The Citizen is a great start to what could become a fantastic brew."
""
"O- Not a bad beer and very easy-drinking, although I definitely prefer the Public and the Corruption."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: It is a bit on the thin side but the after taste hangs around very nicely well into the next drink and beyond."
"Overall a pretty mellow but enjoyable little beer. I honestly have no idea what style they were shooting for, maybe some sort of Belgian Wit? Whatever it is, it turned out pretty good."
""
"Mouthfeel: Lighter side of medium. It's a little thin but... it kinda should be. The carbonation level is a little high but this is an easy drinker. It's kinda crazy this beer clocks in at 7%. You would never know it."

"O: 3.5"

"Drink- I thought I would enjoy this more. I was thinking it would be a canned Stone Belgiuqe. It was tasty but wasnt blown away. Hopefully the other two I have are a bit more wowing."
"It pours with a white head that dissipates quickly, leaving a murky golden body. I can smell spicy hops in the nose, and something in the smell is reminding me of wine. The beer is strongly carbonated, a little too much. I'm new to Belgian pale ales, so the taste is unique to me. I know now why I was reminded of wine when I smelled it, there's a definite fruitiness in the beer. It's a very drinkable beer despite its alcohol content. The mouthfeel is thin, I believe that's the point since it's a Belgian pale ale. I don't think I like this style of beer, but I have to review the beer for what it is, and it's good for what it is."

"The Crack revealed another well-filled craft CAN as well as another beer anxious to get out from its surroundings, foaming up as soon as its CAN was cracked open. I allowed things to settle back down before employing a very gentle Glug so as not to disturb any lees. This still resulted in two fingers of foamy French Vanilla-colored head with decent retention. Nose was both fruity and musty, both yeast-driven and I was reminded of Juicyfruit gum along with a mustiness of old newspapers. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden yellow with lots of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Mouthfeel was full, kind of spritzy from the massive carbonation and the taste was immediately fruity, followed by a mustiness, and then a twang of grassy hops. The finish was dry, smooth, tasty and before I realized it, I had CANsumed easily half of it! At 7.0% ABV, that is something to bear in mind. This might be a dangerous beer to take to the beach ..."
""
""
"I prefer the canned to the growlered!"
""
"Woodychandler continues to come through with canned beers, thanks man. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some fruits and malts. Taste is the same, a bit of fruitiness, some malts and a touch of spice. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
""
"Finishes a tad dry with a fuller body than I expected and high carbonation. Overall it's not too bad, but it's not blowing my socks off either."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but a bit bland and watery for my tastes."
""
"D: definitely more of a sweet belgian blonde than a belgian pale in my opinion. need a greater hop presence to call this a BPA. not a bad beer, but the label is a little deceiving. i say pass and check out some other brews from dc brah."
""
""
"Of all their beers I sampled that day (every single one on tap), this was by far my favorite of them all. Perhaps it's my love for Belgian Tripels which this comes dangerously close to mimicking, but this is a nicely crafted Belgian Ale... in a can!"
"O: Overall, I agree with what others have said overall and I truly wish this had a bit more citrus. That TOTALLY would have made a difference at least in terms of drinkability. Still, I'll remember the smell of this one for weeks!"
"O-Overall decent Belgian pale ale although slightly pricey."
"The appearance is a cloudy orange to amber color, with moderate head. Yeast and clove aromas, which carry over to the palate with a mild hop profile. There was limited carbonation combined with a light mouthfeel that created a watery sensation. Pleasant enough to drink but not something I would seek out."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, I thought it was a pretty solid beer. It was light, crisp, refreshing and easy drinking. It felt pretty well balanced as well. It didn't completely wow me, but it's something I'd be happy to drink a few of on a hot day."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a 2 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A nice latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, yeast, and some light fruit aromas. Taste is very much the same with a delicate hop bitterness on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing that jumps out at you."
""
"o - kind of boring and definitely not memorable."
""
"This is an enjoyable beer. It's not going to blow anybody away, but if it were local to me, I could see myself drinking it occasionally."
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer. Not one of their best, but some nice wheat and citrus mixing, and easy to drink. Would seek out a few of their other beers before this one."
""
""
""
"overall i like this beer a lot and i am glad to see DC brau getting more and more distribution here in the capitol area, they deserve it imho"
""
""
""
"Notes: Nothing that remarkable, true. But it has a pretty nice flow and feels like quality. While not something I would eagerly repeat on my own often I´d love to show up socially with a growler of this now and then. I´d say it might be rather engaging for the early curious about craft brews, other styles, without offering a pushy beer."
""
"Hazy golden yellow with a nice white head. Sweet, yeasty aroma with a mild grain and hop finish. Flavor is also exceptionally sweet and yeasty with a mild bitter finish. Not much in the way of hops and a relatively thin body. I'll pass on this."
"On to the next one, Jeff & Brandon."
"Overall, The Citizen is an enjoyable beer despite its mediocre appearance. It's quite drinkable for its ABV (it tastes more like a 5% beer) and works well for the hybrid it is. I would have it again."
"The appearance is a cloudy orange to amber color, with moderate head. Yeast and clove aromas, which carry over to the palate with a mild hop profile. There was limited carbonation combined with a light mouthfeel that created a watery sensation. Pleasant enough to drink but not something I would seek out."
"The beer is a hazy, light orange hue with a half inch of white head that leaves plenty of lacing on the snifter. The aroma consists primarily of hops and yeast, with additional notes of grain, citrus, and bread. The flavor is OK. Nothing really stands out and takes charge. The hop character is underwhelming, and the beer is generally unexciting. Yeast and citrus flavors are there, but don't implore me to drink more. I'm hopeful this beer undergoes some improvements in subsequent batches."
"Overall its pretty mediocre. I'm kind of surprised because I had this on tap at the Argonaut in DC a few weeks back and quite liked it but this batch doesn't seem to be as good."
"Beer is thin with a mild sweetness up front with a little yeast in the middle. The finish is a little acidic from the grain and light on the palate with a mild aftertaste. Not my favorite from them but a solid little ale."
"Overall not bad, kind of distinct but also sort of unusual. Not a bad job I say."
"Pours a fairly-cloudy yellow-gold with a good white head and a good bit of spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings some light bready malt and a bit of grain. Faint spice and a bit of light fruit. The flavor has a moderate amount of yeast, more so than hops. Hops are more there with the bitterness. Faint Belgian spice and some light fruity esters. Medium body and somewhat chewy. Refreshing on a very, very hot day. Good beer, though not as good as the APA or IPA."
