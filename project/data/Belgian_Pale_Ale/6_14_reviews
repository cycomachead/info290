"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately cloudy golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, grape, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, clove, band aid, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with solid balance and complexity; a bit too medicinal. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, bread, honey, candi sugar, herbal, floral, grass, light clove/pepper, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, grape, bread, honey, candi sugar, herbal, grass, floral, light clove/pepper, must, and yeast earthiness. Nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Belgian pale ale. Good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Witkap Pater Singel ---4/5."

"Overall, it's nice, it's light, and it's refreshing, while still being tastier than most similarly light beers."
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-high intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that has light fizziness, quickly settling to a smooth and pleasant foaminess Closes quite dry, with little stickiness remaining on the palate and lips."

"Presentation: Packaged in an eleven-point-two ounce Euro-style brown glass bottle sealed with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
"O- This beer is bright and slightly dry with some nice subtle depth but it takes on a bit of a soapy quality as it opens which is a bit off putting."
""
""
"Although it is a mild beer (relatively to the Dubbels and Tripels) it has its own personality. Drinkability at its best, I could drink this all day. Complex but not bold. Higly recomendable."
""

"Enjoyable ale, it has a couple rough spots, but it has a really good complexity and flavour. Carbonation could be toned down, but flavour of the beer was quite impressive, try it out."
""

""
""
"Pour is a straw like yellow with a slight haze and tight white head. Nose is assertive lemon, light yeast, touch of banana and sweet phenol. A little watery compared to the nose, sweet lemon, zesty spice but faint. The finish lingers with lemon banana and a hint of a lacto aspect. Light body and creamy on the palate with low carbonation. More balanced and deep than the triple."
""
"O - A nice, refreshing beer if you ignore the chunks of yeast."
"4/3/3.5/4/4"
"There’s Belgian Dubbel and Tripel ales, and then there’s Stimulo, better known as an Abbey Single. Typically, that means a smaller beer; lower in alcohol and pale in color. And that’s what we have here. A very drinkable and flavorful beer that’s a nod to what the monks might drink on a regular basis. Drink like a monk? Sure, why not."

"On draft at de heeren, served in chalice. Light white head, medium retention. Clear blonde body. Aroma leans toward hoppy bitterness and a pilsner type malt. Taste is actually almost pilsner like with a nice yeast flavor.  Light taste, refreshing. Easy to drink. "
"nothing so special. a normal belgian ale and not so drinkable in my opinion."

"D - good drinkability, quite light, i could have a few of these."
"Poured light hazy pour with decent amount of head off the pour. Very sweet and almost more wheat or saison aroma. Very light and smooth with a clean finish. Very little bitterness at all in all a decent pale ale but not like many others. There is not many characteristics that make it compairable to other pale ales, at least in the states."
"Poured a white all head in the glass and took a while to settle down. Slightly hazy straw yellow body color. Really not a whole lot of smell but it does have some malt and dried fruit. Taste has a little less dried fruit, some citrus hints, and frankly it's rather sour. And there's not much of a finish. Kind of an imbetween beer, a little like a wit, a little like an Abbey, a little sour."
"Pours a somewhat muddled straw color, big soapy head with excellent retention. Aroma is very Belgian, with the typical yeasty aroma, straw, wheat, damp hay, etc. In the flavor, much of the same. Mild bready maltyness accompanied by a prevailing soft fruit yeast presence. Apricot comes to mind, but not as pronounced. Ghost like hop does just enough to balance. Simple, pleasant, and highlights the great abbey yeast strain of Slaghmuylder."
"O: 3.5"
"T- first thing that I experience was a slight yeasty spice at the back of my tongue, followed by a rounded citrus (orange) and a note of coriander"
"The first Belgian Singel I've ever had or seen. This pours out almost like a Wit beer, cloudy and pale yellow. Thin white head not much lacing. The smell is kind of citrusy but also a bit light also. The taste of the beer was kind of one dimentional to me. there was no transitions here. It tastes similar to a Weisse beer but doesn't really have much of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel was a bit too thin I thought. Overall, I'm glad I tried it but it's not something I'll be getting more of."
"Pours a murky pale yellow color with a huge 3 inch white head that fades to a small cap. Little spots of lacing here and there on the glass. Smells like this one might be infected, as there is a noticeable dirty socks smell coming off this beer. I am also getting some citrus. Taste is actually not half bad. There are some grain flavors, like water logged biscuits, with a lemony citrus finish. There is a citrus zest essence on the finish but without any bitterness. This beer is pretty flat and watery in the feel. Overall, I think there is something wrong with this one. Not too impressed."
"What a tasty refreshing treat we have here. Fruity, yeasty, earthy, light white pepper, star fruit, ugli fruit, lemon zest, citrus, orange rind, good acidity and backbone. Lively carbonation leaves the palate zippy clean. Seems much lighter than 6%"
"Sampled on April 30, 2011. It has a hazy, golden-yellow pour with lots of head and carbonation. It never really goes away. There are aromas of overripe fruit with a mor lemon-citrus note than anything. There are malts and yeast in the aroma as well but it really smelled like it came out of a dank, dark attic. The body is thin to medium. The taste is very sour with malts and yeast loitering around the citrus zone."
"Terrific on the drinkability meter - clean, tasty, and smooth."
"Taste was more of that honey dominant than anything, then some dried fruits and a little bit of basic malt character - again, not bad but fairly unexciting."
"jd"
"Drinkability is really great. This is more of a sipper though as opposed to a chugger. A beer of this magnitude deserves to be savored and enjoyed with friends. Definitely worth the price."
"11.2 oz., unfiltered and conditioned. After foaming up in the bottle it pours a lightly hazed straw, topped with two fingers of bright white froth that leaves immense sheets of lacing. Smells a touch vinous, yeasty, with a bit of sourness and perhaps some spicy hops. Similar on the palate, with notes of pale malt, a mild bitterness and a distracting cardboard flavor on top of a light and dry, highly-carbonated body. Certainly a passable pale, but I wish it had more character."
"D) This beer will appeal to those who like their beer a bit spicey & hoppy"
"D: Quite drinkable, but a little forgettable, but still good. An extremely light flavored beer, but still has some of the Belgian characteristics I love."
"An excellent example of the style. I'd recommend it."
"D=I like, could drink quite a few of these because it is so diffrent."
"Overall impression: not my favorite belgian but tasty for the style."
"Carbonation is too high by far."
"D: Very refreshing and lively brew."
"Drink this one cold and it will surprise you."
"I enjoyed drinking half of this beer for the experience. It's so pungent I laughed out loud. It's always fun to be exposed to a radically different flavor profile than you're used to. But this isn't a beer that's aligned with my personal tastes."
"Drinkability: this is a damn drinkable beer. Its interesting flavor keeps me going back to the well, and its refreshing character make me want to quaff a few more of these."
"Overall an average Belgian Blonde."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink; a great summer beer that is light but with enough complexity to be interesting"
"Notes - More bitter than I expected, but in a good way. This is almost like the Belgian equivalent to a kolsch. If it weren't so expensive I would buy it again because of its uniqueness, but it really isn't worth the price."
"Overall, it's not the beer I would trade for, but if you can have one on a hot day, give it a try."
"I had this from the bottle into a tulip at Hopleaf...The beer pours a cloudy yeasty medium gold with an unreal white head. It foams up at least five fingers, requiring three different pours to finally finish it off. The head is not only big but lasts several minutes and is very puffy and nice to look at...The aroma and taste are both nice, what you would expect out of belgian pale ale, nothing more or less. Easy drinker, but not going to knock your socks off."
"D: The beer is extremely drinkable and quite refreshing. It's a good beer for the summer."
"This was a pleasant surprise, I bought it for the interesting label."
"Received as gift. Thanks Todd."
"Overall, I am a bit disappointed in it. The texture was not good and the taste and smell brought nothing special to the table. I did enjoy it, just not as much as others in the style."
"Well, at least the beer starts out finishing good. There is a strong funk and woodsey taste to this beer. It is medium bodied and as you drink the finishing well dissipates. I don't know if there's an odd bitterness that is just growing, or my tolerance for the funk is going down. I did not enjoy, nor will I order this beer again."
"A single-serve bottle bought a few months ago, poured fridge-cold into a tulip glass. The beer comes on straw-colored and a little cloudy, looking almost like a wit, with a thin layer of creamy head. The nose was of straw and grass, a bouquet garnis of other herbs, some peach fruit and maybe some blossom with it. In the mouth, the perception was of immediate effervesecence, making for short-lived flavor impressions of peachy sweetness, coriander, maybe some other herbs arranged on a thin backbone of hops. The cleansing feeling makes this quite quaffable."
"The Witkap Singel pours a cloudy straw color with a thick frothy whitest of white heads that laces the glass. Smell is sweet and earthy. Some yeasts are also noticeable in the nose. Quaff is sweet up front with a musky yeast finish. The taste is also quite dry and has some notes of hay/grains. Mouthfeel is mildly creamy on the tongue as well as dry. Quite the different mouthfeel compared to other belgian ales. Drinkability is pretty good for this. Packs a 6% abv punch with a pretty good taste makes it sessionable to a lover of this style. The 4$ price tag diminishes the drinkability somewhat. Overall good belgian single that I am glad I could sample."
"Feel and Drinkability: Overall this is one simple and very drinkable beer. This goes down real easy and I could see myself being able to drink a couple of these, might be a good one to go with everyday meals. However, for what this retails at, around $17-18 a four pack, its not worth it. This one has a light-medium body and very low carbonation. It goes down real easy and is semi-dry. Glad I got to try this, but its definitely not worth the price. I doubt I ever buy this beer. Nothing special, nothing to brag about. Not really worth talking about anymore."
"Drinkability: A good one to keep on hand."
"D - This is another great Belgian ale. It was a treat to find it on tap at Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee."
"Easy drinking, not bad at all."
"Note: Bottle says the ingredients are, malt, corn, hop, yeast"
"D - Smooth drink and very drinkable."
"the drinkability is good, and sure to please fans of the style."
"Decent enough, easy to drink and inoffensive."
"eh, no thanks."
"All in all, this is a decent beer, but with so many other great Belgians out there I'm inclined to pass on this one."
"As far as singles go, this beer is of fair strength. I might lean towards others of its kind before picking this one up again."
"Drinkability: Not a bad Belgian Pale. I could see putting these away quite handily if I ever get to Belgium and this sort of thing is widely available."
"The metallic finish was a big turn-off for me. Sadly, it over-shadowed all other character."
"Overall I thought this was a crisp and well done Belgian Pale. Worth a shot."
"While thirst quenching, the flavor and aromas of this beer simply fail to impress me."
"Another Belgian I was disappointed in. Just not a beer I'd like to sit around and knock back with my buds."
"Nice decent head that sticks around. Light golden color. Very spicy with a strong lemon flavor. You can smell the Belgian style yeast on it, with very little hops to it. Oh there's also some lime. It's very interesting and quite good!"
"D: A weird beer, I was all over the place with how much I cared for it during the drinking experience, something to try out."
"33cl bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a fluffy white head. Nice lacing. Smells quite floral and citric, backed by notes of soft grain and honey. Spicy. The taste is slightly more restrained, with lemony notes playing second fiddle to a nice grainy malt character. Spicy yeast notes. Definite hop presence that lends not only good grassy notes, but also slight bitterness. The light body and effervescence work well. A really pleasant beer overall that is incredibly easy to drink."
"Poured into a Chimay glass from a .33l bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors in Worcester. It has a sizable head with nice lacing down the side. The color is very similar to that of Hoegaarden or any Witbier obviously being a very hazy form of yellow. The taste is unfortunately rather metallic and only segways into an even worse aftertaste. When eaten with salty foods, this beer could hardly be distinguished from the juice in a pickle jar. I am looking forward to the duppel and tripel."
"Had a bottle in Ghent. Appeared a hazy amber in the chalice with a white head. This was a nice chage of pace for the seemingly hoppy aroma or soft citrus fruit and mellon. This continued into the flavor along with a bit of Belgian spice and malt, making for an all together excellent Belgian pale ale. Very drinkable and tasty, give this a try."
"The drink is light and crisp with excellent carbonation, and were it the stuff that it smells and tastes most like, Witkap-Pater Abbey Singel it would easily be the most drinkable yeast roll-ale I have ever encountered."
"Tastes light, firm, and delicious. Solvent spices in back, lemon peel, nicely medicinal like some kind of homeopathic footrub. Refreshing, to say the least."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this beer was a hazy lemon-yellow/gold color. The head was an off-white color, two-fingers large, the retention good and the lacing in broken bands. The aroma was delicious, a true bouquet of floral hops, dry grains, citrus, coriander and a general semi-sweet spiciness. The flavors were complex, citrus hops notes first and some citrus rind bitterness followed by spices, white pepper, coriander and vanilla, then a wheat twang towards the end similar to seltzer water. The body was medium/light, the mouthfeel smooth and soft and the carbonation light."
"Drinkability- Good drinkability, but definitely not worth the 18 dollar per 4-pack asking price."
"No head on this one but the brew is highly carbonated. D in the bottom of the glass is producing a floating layer of foam but thats about it. Pale yellow in color, Belgian malts and hops on the nose. Fairly boring on the tongue. Not the best tasting I've had from Slaghmuylder. Tastes like carbonated water with just a little beer injected. Too carbonated if anything. I'd try this again, but only to make sure this wasn't a bad brew. After that, I'd surely pass on this one."
"I bought this at Beer Mania in Brussels and brought it home in my wooden leg."
"Pours a cloudy yellow/golden color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Lots of citrus on the nose, especially sweet orange with some floral notes. Citurs flavors also dominate: sweet orange and grapefruit, bitter lemon with some passion fruit and bubblegum flavors as well. Light body, medium carbonation with an extremely dry finish. The mix of flavors makes you crave another sip."
"pour a light straw lightly cloudy. a small head that quickly becomes a ring around the edge. grass and fruity cirtus. not the type one would expect with hops but with fruit sitting in the esters. taste is sweeter, but not too sweet. refreshing, light hop and note of tangerine juice. the fruit make it crisp, not dry. its herbal but not dense with herbalness and hop. it doesn't seem to have the bpa balance of floral hop, spice, and ester. the fruit give it a lighter body. has a very light malt flavor. very refreshing. will have again before summer is out. not a go to for belgian hoppiness."
"Alcohol well-covered, and a hit of the spiciness lingers for a bit. But overall, not much is going on here that would really make this shine. Plenty of better pale ales from Belgium out there, IMO."
"Pours pee yellow with white foam riding atop. Nose is very citrus heavy and refreshing. Goes down in giant gulps, with no alcohol burn you can really get into the flavors provided by the belgian yeast. I like it as a good summer beer or a good subtle intro into belgian beer."
"D: Good drinkability, refreshing but more suited as a summer quaffer and drank more like a blonde."
"Exquisite beer! Seductive array of flavors crept up on me and drew me in like the nectar of a siren. No negative side effects as of yet."
"Drinkable, not exceptional."
"Recommended..."
"D - Good drinkability...sessionable."
"Grapefruity/lemony citric aroma with some apple notes. Cloudy, golden appearance with frothy, short white head. Ample, very fine carbonation coming up through glass. Some lacing. Slightly acidic and peppery. A bit astrigent and dry. Light bitterness. Spicy, complex mixture of flavors. Citric fruity notes, reminiscent of mellow grapefruit juice. Medium-light body. Dry finish. Lingering bitter/sour aftertaste."
"Overall I'm smitten with this beer. I've dabbled and sipped this classic throughout the years, but never got serious to contemplate and formally review it. The delicate spice, ripe tartness, chalky dryness, subtle sweetness and kinetic ultra fine carbonation really do make this a sensational ale. I do believe I've found my perfect session Belgian ale"
"D, notes: A decent beer that is fairly unique. The big flavor characteristic is sour/bitter, which can't remember tasting in a Belgian pale ale - though the style is kind of a catch all."
"Similar to the smell but with a more sweet and malty flavor. Cinnamon buns, caramelized pineapples, pears, and clove. The flavor is subtle and smooth with a carbon dioxide overtone to the crisp drink. I feel like I can taste the raw water that was used when this was brewed. Very clean and mineral in character. As the beer warms I taste the more complex bready malt come through. This is an interesting beer. A little watery in the mouthfeel, but the carbonation helps a bit. Quite drinkable as well."
"Pours a cloudy straw/gold with a sizeable head that falls quickly and leaves a good amount of lacing on the way down. Nose is almost sour; possibly like a sweet sourdough. What an interesting flavor edge to it. There are many different things coming together here in an odd way, but not in a particularly light one. It is somewhat smooth, but definitely unfiltered. I get a bit of hearty yeast and a thick malt edge. Definitely a unique combination of flavors, but not something I would ever go back to. Feel is typical for the style."
"EDIT: Almost forgot to mention that my bottle was actually filled all of the way to the top. There was just the tiniest bit of air right under the cap. Thought that was a bit unusual, don't know if that is the norm for them or if it was an oddball."
"Overall this was a good bit above decent for a nice Belgian. Now it was nothing explosive or out of this world, but the again understated palate really showcased what a finely crafter beer can be like. I am not going to say this was the best thing I have ever had, but it was certainly no where near the worst. A very well crafted and nice little Belgian. I would order this again if I saw it."
"Drinkability : Mais on pourrait espérer mieux d'une abbaye , manque un peu de profondeur."
"Pours a pale cloudy color with a decent amount of foam. Aroma is nice and fruity, with hints of apple and raisin in the nose. Taste is very mild and fruity with a grapefruit-like aftertaste. Goes down smooth. A second sip confirms the drinkability of this beer and how balanced it is. A decent introduction to the style that doesn't overwhelm in any aspect."
"33cl bottle. Pours very pale straw with a head that its just not serious enough about to keep for any amount of time. Very odd looking for anything abbey, I'd have to say. The smell is apples, lemongrass, and peaches. Nice. Like a trippel with a hint of something rosemary-ish. The taste is crisp at first, then funky sour finish. Has a lambic-esque quality but not nearly so pronounced. The mouthfeel is tingly but slick enough to hold it together. Drinkability isn't bad but the odd sour but not like we meant it finish is the limiting factor for my limited palate. Definitely worth a try."
"I dont think Shakespeare had this beer in mind. Where other small beers lack flavor and style, this one keeps an earthy base while reaching for the sublime. Beer is ultimately clean and easy, a great session or pairing with fish or salad. I just wish it was a little easier on the pocket book."
"This beer poured pale and golden with a tall foamy head. The smell carried yeasts and light citrus accents. The flavor was light in intensity but moderately complex. its flavors were hoppy, yeasty, somewhat spicy(cloves) Mild citrus bittersweetness and very light malts. The mouthfeel was very light with good carbonation. Overall I found this beer to be light and refreshing with a reasonable level of complexity to the flavor."
"The carbonation pops in your mouth, the tang keeps you coming back...sort of light bodied too. It's good, but nothing I'd really try again. I could definitely drink more of these, but I wouldn't go get my own."
"Nice beer, though a bit pricy."
"It was decently drinkable and nice to sip, but although refreshing, it was mediocre at best."
"Yummy and easy."
"Taste is hoppy and bitter, not as bitter as I expected from the smell. The tartness is not there, I must have mistaken the tart smell for the dryness and hoppiness of the beer. A thin body fits the style Saison and fits this beer. A beautiful, spicy, light fruity, slightly phenolic beer with a great balance. Aftertaste is bitter and dry. Great stuff!"
"Witkap Pater Singel paired well with an aged white cheddar."
"D: Very refreshing! A fantastic summer beer that was a pleasure to try on draft."
"D - Pretty good. This is one of the nicest smelling beers I've had in a while, so I would buy it again just for that. The flavors just don't quite live up to the aroma though, and I think that the citrus aspects just don't mesh well with the sweet honey-candy flavors."
"M&D: slightly fizzy for my taste initially, but the mouthfeel quickly turns softer, while the palate is consistently crisp and dry, even a bit tangy for a Belgian pale ale... Overall, this is a good, reasonably complex-yeasty sample of this style, and quite a more-ish and quaffable one in warmer seasons to me~~"
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and zesty in the beginning and finished rather thin and smooth."
"A rather unusual-tasting Belgian ale, yet an enjoyable one. Probably for the more adventurous drinkers in general, but those who enjoy Belgian ales should definitely try this."
"Alternating sip to sip I either praised the refreshing qualities of this beer or cursed its funk. There is no doubt that this is an aquired or preferential taste, and well crafted. Admittedly I did not pair it with food, which may or may not help it. I've got a few more, I'll have to give it a go."
"This poured a very hazy blonde with a nice, thick head and good webbing in the glass. The smell is of citrusy fruits mixed with some spices. Light and enticing. Fruity in taste with a hint of a mellow souring combined with a slight spicy kick to compliment the flavor. Well balanced and pleasant in the mouth to create an exceptional smootness. A great beer to be enjoyed year-round."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into my snifter a cloudy orangish color with a big white fluffy head that leaves spots of lace around the glass. Smell is sweet with malt and fruits. Taste crisp with a short burst of pale flavors of malt and hops that finish clean with very little after taste. It is also well carbonated and very easy to drink. A very well crafted brew but a little to pale for my taste to make this a regular got to beer."
"Poured into oversized wineglass, two centimeter thick white head, leaving lacing. The body is a hazy golden with orange peach-ish high lights. Smells of pale fruit esters, predominantly pear, with hints of apple and strawberry, a little upstaged by clove, pepper and as it warms slightly yeasty scents. Taste is fresh with a crisp juicy pear character, there is a slight tartness and a dry apple or pear finish. Medium light mouthfeel and I assume that since it is a ""single"" like the refectory beer the monks ate with this would be a really nice food beer, especially with cheese and bread or crackers. I dig this, definitely not an evening closer, more of a lunch or even starting dinner drink, but just the same this is a very subtle easy going Belgian pale, Id buy again."
"Cloudy and yet transclucent golden with abundant and drinkable white mushroom cap of a head. Mild yeasty aroma. Medium mouthfeel, very easy drinking and a bit on fruity yeasty side. A bit drying finish. Bitterness and sweetness in aftertaste from malts. I could have this again. A good example of a Belgian pale."
"This is a unique beer that is well worth a try. The sour fruit notes really give this brew a different taste."
"beer poured into chalice at 50 degrees. Beer was cloudy and smelled like fresh bake bread with a little fruity background smell. Taste was yeasty,fruity and a little peppery. Twas a good Abbey, and if offered one I would take it, but I will still most likely not purchase again."
"Drinkability: Spicy and fruity, not overdone, very drinkable."
"Overall - A very good pale ale... there are better examples out there but it's certainly worth a try..."
"The carbonation is sharp and crisp, accentuating the beautiful floral hops. Very highly drinkable. I'm looking forward to the tripel, which I also purchased along with this. I think the real beauty behind this beer, however, is it's drinkability, which may be lost with a stronger style."
"A great beer! And I thought I was a hop head!"
"An easy to drink belgian ale that I would drink again."
"THis was a decent belgium, even though i dont like them this one was quite good. INcredible lacing if i must say. WIth some aged cheese, the tastes of this beer trully come out. Nice malts and overall aroma made it tasty. Never heard of a single from belgium so this is fairly interesting, definetly worth a shot."
"Draft in proper glass at Bierhuis De Brouwzale in Gent on 9/15/06."
"Hazy gold  frothy white head- nose of yeast, bananas, bubble gum, vanilla (very delicate nose) taste of orange blossom, yeast, hints of citrus and clove  light sparkly body  sweet banana laced aftertaste Hazy gold  frothy white head- nose of yeast, bananas, bubble gum, vanilla (very delicate nose) taste of orange blossom, yeast, hints of citrus and clove  light sparkly body  sweet banana laced aftertaste"
"Drinkability- Goes down pretty easy, but the smell and the taste are about average, which makes it hard to give this a higher score than a 4 here."
"Always happy to return to quality Belgian brews, no matter what the style. After drinking Duvels and La Fin Du Monde's for a while, it's hard to put mere-mortal Belgian Pale Ales in its proper perspective. Despite its lesser complexity and character, this beer is a wonderful summertime refresher. Balanced heavily on the malts, the beer tastes and smells very peach-ey, pear-ey, with a moderate estery / clove-ey spiciness. Hopped for a desicate bitter balance, the beer takes on mild earthy / herbally qualities. All the while, remaining lightly tart and twang-ey. Very smooth and crisp in the finish with a mild / tart fruit lingering. Nice beer."
"Poured into a New Belgium Globe Glass. This beer poured a hazy golden color with a big head and lots of lacing. The aroma was spicy, with hints of caramel and bread dough. The taste was of caramel and apples, with a tart and pleasant finish. The mouthfeel was good, although the body was a tad thin.A very enjoyable Belgian pale, indeed."
"Gold. Dull, slightly tart aroma of cereals, whole wheat, banana peel, sugars, peach and apricot. Strong, slightly sour and nutty yeast taste. Quite bizarre. Notes of clove, coriander yet I doubt it is spiced. So this is what is drunk during fasting times? I could get used to that."
"Witkap-Pater pours a magnificent pale yellow body with just a touch of orange from the yeast. Great white lacing. Aromas of honey, bread, cider, must, coriander like soap, and a cardamom sweetness give this one a palatable nose. Taste and mouthfeel are clean and crisp. Refreshing and slightly sour. Lavender like hops waltz with light diacetyl notes. Buttered bread adds to the body. This beer has character and liveliness to give but that doesnt take away from an extreme sessionability."
"Cold bottle erupted when I popped the cap. Hazy sunshine colored beer was poured quickly into a goblet. Big, foamy, bright white colored head faded slowly to a dense film leaving a few strings of lace behind. Sour lemon and a pinch of floral hops in the aroma. Flavor is pretty one dimensional. Mostly sour lemon with a bit of candied fruit. This beer is full of of carbonation resulting in a froathy mouthfeel. It tastes like something between a Saison and a Lambic. It's interesting, but not what I thought I was getting and not something I would drink again."
"This one is a unique beer, just too sweet for me."
"Overall: Its a rarely known bit of Belgiumbeergeekdom that Slaghmuylder (who are still family owned) can lay claim to producing the first ever Abbey Beer because the Witkap brews were first produced by an ex-Westmalle brewer back in the 1920s. Slaghmuylder first brewed the Witkaps in 1979 and now own the Witkap brand. There arent that many Abbey Singles, fewer worthy of special note, but this is one of them. Only cost me $3.49 for the privilege. Damned fine stuff!! Well worth seeking out."
"Body is a little thin but good nevertheless. I prefer other examples of the style. This would be a good crossover for someon I believe. Someone looking to get into Belgians. This would ease someone into the style."
"Drinkability and Overall: A very good single, with enough drinkability to be sipped on all day. Definitly recommended if you want a quality Belgian session ale."
" Back to the beer this is a unique smelling beer it took a few smells to pinpoint kinda reminds me of a barn, but the flavor which is smooth and green."
"Beer is good. Happy Belg pale beering."
"Overall, a decent Belgian, with some bonus marks for a unique flavor."
"The taste is a good balance between sweet fruit and some tart notes throughout. A very nice beer."
"A good mildly flavored Belgian beer here. This would go good with other mild flavors like raw vegetables without strong sauces or dressings. The low alcohol rating also makes this a super choice for lunch when you have to go back to work."
"D: Quite drinkable, but gassy."
"Witkap-Pater Abbey Singel looks fabulous, smells good, tastes pretty good and feels just okay. The long, slow slide is saved in the end by an upturn when it comes to drinkability. Despite my complaints, this is an impressively quaffable beer. They mow lawns in Belgium, don't they?"
"The carbonation is on high gear but the body is light to medium. The smoothness makes it very easy to drink but I would like to have more flavor. So but on your hoody and enjoy."
"A Pale with interesting flavors; just not as balanced as I would've liked. Nice to try, but one to avoid in the future."
"A sweet, fruity, almost cider-like flavor and aroma dominates, but the malt and hops are balanced nicely with everything in the foreground. The mouthfeel was pretty robust. Given the great depth of flavor here, plus the $2.49/bottle price tag, I could easily see myself returning to this beer many times again."
"Overall, a decent beer, but not that great and nothing I would seek out."
"Drinkability- Fairly easy drinking brew. Drink this one on the cooler side. Towards the end it starts to take on the taste of a watery green banana beer if that makes any sense at all."
"Spectacularly effervescent and light. Dreamy clouds float all around your mouth. Highly refreshing. Definately recommended."
"Clear gold in color, with a moderate white head and lots of tiny bubbles. Aroma is spicy, with some orange citric notes. Spiciness dominates the flavor as well. Heavy on the cloves, but with noticeable coriander and orange peel flavors as well. Bubbles dance on the tongue, giving the beer a light, tingly mouthfeel. Easy drinking."
" Flavors are light as well, nicely tart and citrusy with a wimpy malt backbone. Wimpy works here, and would make you question the 6% alc/vol as does the light body and mouth feel. Wheat notes blend well with the pale malt sweetness ( Im assuming there is wheat in here - if not , nice trick!). Dry, mildly hoppy finish with a tasty lingering bitterness. Now this is a session beer!"
"Average Belgian Pale. Not very interesting to me. Pours and it looks clear and yellow, like an adjunct lager, but with a good head. Smell is slightly spicy, but not much there. Taste is a touch tart, some spice, but bland. Mouthfeel is good for style, very carbonated but not overcarbonated. Okay, but not great."
"This beer is kind of a poor man's Duvel - less hoppy, less alcoholic, less head, but more expensive. So I guess it isn't really a poor man's Duvel. A good beer nonetheless, and worth a try."
"Drinkable."
"This is not a top level classic beer, but it is very tasty, and I really enjoy it."
"The drinkability is great could be a session beer since the aftertaste does not linger however the 6.0 a/v may limit the session."
"Feel is well carbonated with a fluffy medium body that plays off the dry crispness which seems to really keep a good hold without getting to strong like some wines or overly yeasty ales. A good little drinker thats smooth, dry, crisp, and fruity with just enough play of yeast and phenol things to keep you intrigued to continue 'til the glass sits empty."
"Personally I really like this beer. Not sure if I am getting the intended flavors but I still like it."
"Drinkability: very easy going!"
"A dirty, straw-colored beer, hazy. Cloudy on last pour with big dark chunks. Foamy, white head leaves arcs of lacing. Some tangy citrus and pepper in the nose. Taste is pleasant: yeasty, mildly spicy, some nice fruit. Finish is quite bitter, with buttery grains. It's very wit-like. A nice, pleasant, mild, fruity, bready Belgian."
"The taste was of strong, smooth wheat, slightly nutty. Quite well balanced, I must say. I wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but it delivered a memorable experience that I enjoyed."
"Pours a deep blond with a little orange tint with a nice sticky head that takes awhile to leave,get a nice big green apple note in the aroma along with a yeasty/spiceness wich was expected.Taste is fruity more citruisy than apple with a nice level of spiceness and pretty tart in the abrupt finish.A pretty nice beer very solid and will buy again."
"This Belgian, seems to be crafted as a Saison, or session ale. If you can adapt to the wool blanket yeastiness, you can enjoy several of these at a sitting."
"A nice brew with some interesting elements going on. It's Belgian alright, but it's not over-the-top and it's light body makes it a good crossover beer for those getting into the Belgian Lambics. Think of this as a cross between a Lambic and Abbey single."
"11.02 oz bottle, no dating noted. Nice monk on label. Pours cloudy, dull orange in color with a nice white, very tiny bubble head which reduces to a thin film and leaves a lot of intricate lacing. First tastes I get are a delicate, powdered sugar nose, and then interestingly, sourness on the tongue. Sweat and sour. Tastes of doughy donuts and sour cherries. Spices coriander,pepper, lemon, alot going on here! Funky Belgian yeast thang going down. ""only"" 6% so this one would be fairly drinkable, if it wasnt so complex....I like this beer, a good one to try on a Belgian newbie, cuz its got the Belgian flavors/yeast and complexity, but its not super strong. This would be great also with hearty/flavorful salads, breads, nuts and cheese.."
"Straw color, chill haze, a fine white rocky head and light effervescence. It has a sticky lacy and retains a fine layer after the head diminishes. The aroma is primarily of hops and some malt, but is also tart with a, bready background. The flavor has a slight sweet start with a tart yet spicy middle and a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium bodied with an astringent finish."
"Pours a hazed fizzy golden straw color with a bif white head. Mellow, yet spicey. Sweet, yet dry. Balance is quite right. Hops and malts are in check with each other. Yeast flavor is there too. Complex, but not overly so. A solid Belgian which I am glad is now available in VT."
"Make sure to decant the yeast with the bottle on this one or it'll seem a little bland. Murky pale golden with darker colored yeast in suspension. Effervescent foamy white head that'll dissipate promptly of you use the proper chalice leaving a nice lace. Peppery, citrusy, zesty and musty aromas are right in front. Even smells effervescent (?). Taste is a different story. Very tart lime citrusy tang mixed with some yeasty funkiness in the beginning going toward a musty drier finish. The only malt presence I could discern was a mild tea sweetness in the middle. I like this beer a lot. I've tried older bottles and liked those better, but, regardless, I guess I could say that I like this beer for the same reasons that I like Duvel or a saison-style or Orval. Very tasty."
"In goes the yeast -- The brew goes from the bubbly gold to a very light orange color, very cloudy, and the bubbles are harder to see. Nose remains the same, but the yeast gives this one a more complex flavor, no surprise there. Stronger citrus flavors and a creamier mouthfeel result from the yeast. Mmm...yeast. Pour the yeast in on this one. A tasty Belgian white indeed."
"big white head on an active golden liquid, very pretty with all this great lace, almost a five. very spicy scent with a cinnamon notable. flavor is also spicy and exciting with sage, corriander, clove, lemon zest slightly sweet grape and apple with wheat rounding it out on the bottom. an after glow of white grape, spicy, (cinnamon, sage, clove ect...see scents above) herbal vegetable balance and a nice bit of tart. mouthfeel is light and fresh feeling, filling and active. due to the balance of flavors and this beers' intreguing properties i have to say this beer is very drinkable, that drinkability score is just .5 higher because it's sessionable despite it's being complex."
"Poured a cloudy gold color. I has similar characteristics of a wheat beer when pouring. Very thin head that disappeared rather quickly. Lots of carbonation rising from the bottle of the glass. Not a potent hoppy smell, but present. Almost had citrus and grass smell. Very sweet tasting. Kind of suprising at first. Almost tart tasting. First thing that comes to mind is sweet tarts candy or red bull. The mouthfeel is nice and the drinkability is enjoyable. I can see myself drinking this beer on hot summer days."
"It is ridiculous how tasty this is! Golden orange with a big puffy wit head-1/2 inch of head stays through the whole trip. Thick and supple lace throughout. Aromas are citrus dominated, and quite sour-almost lambic-ish, and fade back and forth from lemon and tart orange. Delicious to taste with sourball, orange and lemon flavors, and some grapefruit zest. Hard to put down, as the flavors are so refreshing. Medium bodied with just right carbonation providing a rush of creamy foam moments after each sip. a citrus delight-damn near a lambic, and solid as a rock. I'll be going back to this one real soon."
"Pours with a very hazy golden color and a small semi-sticky head. Aroma is of hops and spices (clove and maybe some coriander) with some citric notes. Very slight hint of malt is also noticeable. Yeast settles quickly to the bottom making it necessary to frequently swirl the glass. The mouthfeel is light to medium and a bit fluffy from carbonation. The start is somewhat smooth, but then a tart, almost sour, nature takes over. Very tart citric dry finish that lingers for a bit. Lemon notes are quite prevalent. The spiciness is mild with hints of clove as well as a small amount of yeast. The malt in this brew is very subdued with almost no sweetness, but there is a soft graininess. This is a fairly drinkable brew that is probably a good summer refresher. The tart and sour character of this beer doesnt really do much for me though. This is the first Belgian Pale Ale (Single) that Ive had. It seems to me to be more of a Witbier."
"To sweet for my taste but a credit to its style."
"Overall Impression: A nice abbey single. Far superior to some of the ones I've tried from actual Trappist breweries and probably one of my favorites. Not watery tasting at all. Somehow it is similar to an Orval without the bacterial/wild-yeast element. Very tasty!"
"Pours a lightly cloudy golden orange, with a huge rocky white head that is sturdy and lasting, lacing nicely. Aroma is yeasty, apple, peach, slightly spicy, and some grassiness. Flavor is apple, some sourness, lemon zest, tart, acidic, and quite dry. Medium body, fairly bubbly carbonation."
"Yet another beer which is miscategorized. This is actually a wit beer. The name abbey single probably gets it placed under begian pale ales. Wonderful aroma in this, very citrusy with some other hints of spice. This spice 'hint' in the aroma is quite intriguing since it is a bottle conditioned ale. Supposedly, the coriander aroma disipates after a month or so in the bottle. I doubt that it is within a month fresh since I bought in the states. Nonetheless, the taste is quite extraordinary -- it zaps the palate with a bit of a cidery sour bite and finishes sparkling dry, which I found quite refreshing on a hot summer day a few hours drive from the mason-dixon line. Do I detect a hint of ginger in there?"
"So easy to drink, great with food. Remember, it was made to be drinkable as it was monks everyday beer. This would be my everyday beer."
"This is just a damn *good* beer -- and interesting to boot. Despite it's single status, it's got a good abv, which is discernable every so slightly in the zesty, spicy, peppery nose. Muted, cloudy yellow cream color with a pure white head. Starts with some apple flavors and progresses through a lemon zest tartness into a fairly dry finish. The flavors in this pretty well-carbonated brew are strong, which makes it more interesting. A slightly tart apple flavor mingling with the citrus and the aromas leads for a really cool sensation. It's a fun one."
"This beer poured a hazy gold color and formed a nice bubbly white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. Some carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, cirtrus, banana and cloves. A flavor of hops, sour apples and some citrus. The finish was a bit on the tart side. Not a bad beer, but the flavor threw me off a bit."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a medium head and some slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is very spicy and filled with citrus hints. The taste is very smooth for having such a strong aroma. The spices also come out in the taste. Not a bad beer, but very spicy."
"Much more subdued in the mouth, but still substantial. The malt and yeastiness dominate, but the spice and citrus add complexity. Excellent mouthfeel from this bottle-conditioned brew. Great length from nice underlying acidity. Simply a top-notch beer."
"Reminiscent of a White Ale, this Abbey Single Ale is light gold to straw in color with a fine little bubbly head. Trails of lace slowly slide down with some spotty stickiness. The fizzy effervescence hides the true malt body. Wild hoppy flavors abound with sharp bitter citrus, acidic and piney esters. Some noticeable yeasty clove-like flavors lasts throughout the glass. The brew slowly transforms as the lightly sweet malt sneaks into being, creating a mild fruity taste and smoother mouthfeel."
"Belgium Light. Bad choice of words? I think not. I think this is what the Monks drink in the summer. A good golden color, a taste alive with hops, citrius and other fruits. Not too heavy, a golden crispness, almost refreshing. I could handle more than a couple of these when the mercury hits 90. Mmmm, mmm, monk light."
"Appears a cloudy gold with a vibrant white two fingered head. Relatively no lace with a decent retention going on in my goblet. The aroma consists of a musty sour mash tone complemented with hints of bready yest. The tastes is definitely also a sour yeasty forefront to the flavor, along with a bit of an acidic ester with some sweetness trickling along the taste buds. The mouthfeel is a carbonated fizzy feeling with a high drinkability due to the pleasant but unique overall presentation of this Belgium classic."
"This beer is almost clear and golden. A skimming of a head is present. Frothy edging however. Aroma is fruity, musty and heavily cidery. Huge apple cider nose. Taste seems a little stale. Sour apple and vinegar come to mind. Not very drinkable. I wouldn't go with this one again."
"Pours a hazy yellowish golden color with a large white head. The smell sort of sour with a citrusy hints. The taste was of crisp mint, cedar and pepper with a slight hint of salt(?) with a moderate body. I thought it was very complex for a single ale. Very tasty!"
"Some sourness appears in the end, but doesn't destroy the enjoyment of this tasty brew. Thanks to Marc77 for bringing us together!"
"Hazy gold. Aroma is light and doughy accompanied by a light fruity quality. Flavors consist of a pleasant balance of pear, pineapple and tart lemon. Mouthfeel is light-medium, carbonation  effervescent. Alcohol is subtle and soft, enhancing a somewhat spicy undertone. A unique and drinkable brew. Paired well with a sharp, aged provolone. Excellent."

"Drinkability: Very good, refreshing. Not overly sweet."
"The pour a nice Chill hazed yellow-orange, with a splendiferous head, frothy in consistency and brilliant white in color with thick clinging sheets of lace. Citrus sour with hints of banana nut bread, accompanied by malt that underlies this most magnificent nose. The start quite tart, top is middling, the finish is persuasively acidic, pertinently hopped, dry aftertaste, with that lingering tartness to the last drop."
"A nice golden liquid emerges from the bottle. This beer pours a huge, pillowy head that retains very well. The nose is rather earthy with some yeast character presenting itself. The taste is tart and reminiscent of a Granny Smith apple at first. The mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated and is a bit prickly. Drinkability is quite good, but be careful -- this one can sneak up on you if you're not careful."
"Intriguing."
"Somewhere between a cider beer and a wine cooler. Straw colored. Fruity with an acidic aftertaste. Very different but not high on my list of things to try again."
"Very nice little brew, nice spicy yeast aroma. Quite light on the palate, and very smooth, lacks a bitter bite at the finish, and isn't assertive enough, however it is quite nice, and easy to drink, nothing offensive about it."
"The slightly hazy pale golden hue is topped by an impressive, thick, fluffy and persistent head-- very appetizing in appearance.  Tart fruity esters w/ light citrus notes in aroma, followed by a subdued mustiness & just a hint of phenol.  Lightly bodied w/ a crisp & pleasant mouthfeel.  Tart upfront in flavor, but a mellow & agreeable sweetness follows.  Yeast derived flavors are mild, but citric esters are perceptible and well blended into the flavor profile.  Hop bitterness is very light, but emerges in the surprisingly dry & clean finish.  The light, yet complex flavor lends Witkap Pater Singel superlative drinkability.  It's a Belgian ale I could drink all day."
"Good orangy and cloudy. Off white head, holds well enough. Bready and a bit of citrus on the nose. Light (gasp!) apricot on the tongue, really friggin' smooth. Doesn't have the normal bite I'd expect. I can't get over how smooth this beer is, I think it's the smoothest (or close too) I've ever had."
"Starts by pouring an orange / blonde in color, tiny bit cloudy, with a fat fluffy head. On the nose there is light orange peel aroma notes, that I picked upThe flavors that came through were a little sour, a little tart and also bitterness all the way through with notes of orange peels, malt evident, acidic, and cloves among other things. Pretty interesting brew"
"Nice gold/orange color.  Thick, white head that seems to stay forever.  Orange aromas that carry throught to the palette.  Finishes quickly and cleanly.  Very easy to drink... could easily see drinking this on a summer night or with a meal."
"Nice deep-yellow yeast hazy cast. Massive yeasty, fruity nose. Mildly malty beginning turns ultra-tart dry to finish encompassed by an insinuation of hop bitterness. All this flavor is mellowed with an alcohol afterglow that makes me glad (yet sorry) I don't have another one of these tasty beers handy."
"Persistent fluffy white head, it was still in my glass this morning.  I wasn't expecting this beer to be as tart/sour as it was.  Pleasant surprise.  More bitter than most Belgian whites.  Finished dry, quick and a little thin.  Took on chaulky character after the addition of yeast.  Overall it was extremely interesting."
"An interesting Abdijbieren (abbey beer). Golden/blonde in colour with a sticky white lace. Slightly malty and sour in the nose. Malt dryness, some sweetness then more dry and sour/bitterness. Overall, not too bad and worth a try for the exploring palate."
