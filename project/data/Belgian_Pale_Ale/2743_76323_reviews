"Effervescent and crisp. head dissipates quickly. orange/amber borderline in color. earthy, musty, hoppy scent. ""horseblanket"" brett'ey on the nose and palate. Very brett forward. Possible age on the 4 pack I purchased. Drinks very nice. Though, would love a fresh take on this."

""
""
"Similar to Orval but not as delicious. Much lower price point."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Came gushing out of the bottle despite no agitation. Has a dark golden color with several inches of head. Smell is of fruits, yeast, funk. Taste is funky, spicy, malts, some fruits, different but good. Feels medium-full in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"Food match: Hard to nail this one due to that odd funky orange sherbet note, it would however match Thai or South East Asian cuisine (the zesty flavours of which would become a match for it)."
"I almost gave this a 5 for appearance, except the towering fluffy head would be mare at home on a tripel than on a Belgian ale. Nice yeasty aroma some floral notes, a hazy copper orange body, taste is yeast and some mellow hoppiness. Overall a great attempt at the Belgian style."

"Rarely can I find a beer that successfully marries sourness with hops. As someone who dislikes hops in general, anytime a beer has a powerful hops flavor it tends to be overpowering. Rayon Vert, however, finds a way to balance a powerful sourness with a powerful hops flavor and does so with both finesse and strength. Well done!"

"We have a winner of the beauty pageant right here. Voluptuous off-white head that stays full and bouncy. Golden orange in color. Smells spicy with the yeast shining through the middle, accompanied by light fruits (apple, orange). Tastes of fruit juice backed with notes of grain and faint brett funk. Dry all the way through and just plain easy drinking. Session this, session that, blah, blah, blah, blah...session this!"
""
""
""
"What a bretty beast... Pours a murky orange with a huge bubbly head. Brett barnyard funk dominates the nose, with some spice and a hint of fruit. Those same things are fully present in the taste, along with coriander and even a bit of a cardamom. A bit astringent. Crisp medium mouth without a lot of carbonation. It's not as refined and balanced as Orval, but nonetheless good if you're a brett head."
""
""

""

""
""
"OVERALL- While this might be one of the best beers I've ever smelled, its flavor is a bit messy, despite having some very pleasing characteristics. If this is one to lay down, two years is either too long or some sort of awkward phase."
"Qualities of a pale with lots of brett."

"O: Would I drink this at cellar temperate along with my favorite belgians? Yes, not quite as round, or fruit intense, not quite as red-wine like, but all the upper notes are here, and then some original ones. Bravo. A must try. Not disappointed. Warm warm warm."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Belgian goblet. This beer is inspired by Orval and is indeed alive with funk, more so than its more esteemed Trappist progenitor. I have yet to encounter so much head on a beer ... The entire glass is filled with soft beige bubbles and subsequent pours are just as billowing as the first. The head does calm down if you wait a moment and like Orval is savagely bitter if you wish to taste it alone. Color is a honey orange-amber, rather cloudy. Smells compelling. I get ample Brettanomyces funk, bubble gum, orchard fruit, banana, mixed spices, dish soap, leather, and citrus rind ... Very astringent, spicy, sour, fruity, dry. The number of flavor elements I register is quite staggering, although this takes some mindfulness and a willingness to brave the tannic dry bitterness and funk that pervades the proceedings from start to finish. There's a sweet sugar cookie and sour gummy candy malt backbone buried underneath 1) pie cherries, peach, banana, grape, watermelon rind, and lemon-lime fruit notes, 2) nutmeg, allspice, cardamom, and ginseng spice flavors, 3) floral rosewater and lemongrass, and 4) bandage and horse blanket phenolic/funk elements. Medium bodied with aggressive yet not prickly carbonation ... Beneath the head the beer is actually quite creamy and smooth. Finish is bone dry and the whole thing makes you thirsty, truth be told. This dryness is a hallmark of an Orval-style Belgian pale though. This brew is a polarizer, with some considering it the second coming while others decry it as overrated and crude. The truth is somewhere in the middle, as is typically the case. Rayon Vert is a personal favorite of mine. It is indeed jagged and coarse at times, lacking the Old World comeliness of Orval, but on the other hand, I can also appreciate the robust flavors and unabashed funkiness. Drink what floats your boat."

"O: Mouthfeel and a bit too much bitterness tarnish an otherwise really tasty beer. Still somewhat recommended. I did like the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well, yes, it's a Belgian ale. Some mix of bitter, light sour and gueuze. Carbonation flew too high on this one, the funk is fun and dynamic, medicinal part kinda off but overall complex and interesting one."
""
""
"O: I bet this is even better fresh. Quite good for the probable year or two on it. Now I really can't wait to open my three year old Orval."
""
""
"O: The Brett has worked wonders on this. Complex in the nose and taste and it all rounds out to a relatively clean beer in the end. I'll get this again."

"O - I enjoyed Rayon Vert and have multiple since my review. It's a consistent brew that push the Bretty yeast across the palate in fashion. I'm not usually big on Brett, but for those who are this is a tremendous ale that does quite nicely at what its called for. You always get well crafted ales from Green Flash and Ragon Vert doesn't disappoint. A solid Belgian style pale. I can see why so many people enjoy this. Ill be running back to this one in the future."
"O: The odd astringent bitterness here sort of ruined the experience. Maybe I'll revisit again and hope it's gone."

"Overall, this is easily my favorite offering from Green Flash. It bills itself as an Orval-inspired beer, and I'll say this: the heavy use of Brett and the fact that this beer is wonderful fresh or with a good amount of age on it definitely put it in the same company with Orval. However, to its credit, it is a different and interesting beer in its own right. Just a fantastically imaginative beer from GF and I can't really think of anything in the U.S. that is quite like it--or maybe quite like it and as good."

"Poured into oversized stemmed tulip. Produced 3 inches of light ""root beer float"" cream colored head. Frothy meringue like head that lasted for entire serving. Ale is a copper to amber color, slightly cloudy. Heavy lace. Excellent strong malt and bread like smell. Taste of sweet malt, mild hops and of sour fruit. Mild cling of alcohol viscosity in the mouthfeel as expected from a 7%. Overall a pleasant ale that I would recommend and sample again."
"Overall, I can say this is a high quality farmhouse ale, and definitely one that is more experimental and funky as it can get. Great stuff, and I only wish it weren't as delicate. I definitely will pick some of these up and cellar them in the future - my only fear is if my timing goes wrong, that this will turn into a smoky band-aid mayhem rather than a progressively grassier result that it seems destined to become."

"Overall: Beautiful example of how well Brett works in a Belgian Pale Ale. The base beer is solid, and the wild yeast adds layers and complexity. I am very impressed (4.25/5)."
"O - The bottle's main descriptor, ""Belgian-Style Pale Ale," is a bit misleading. This brew drinks almost like a sour, thanks to the Brett, and is not for the faint of heart. If left to mellow for 10-15 minutes after pouring, it's really enjoyable - bitter-sweet and floral, with a faint vinegar presence lingering in the background to keep things interesting."

"O: Really decent brew, this suits me more than Orval did. There is a nice peppery, tart, fruity component."

"O - 3.75 - This is a good belgian pale ale. I'm surprised at how similar it tastes to Orval. I wonder if maybe they're using the same yeast strain or something? It has a nice off flavor (yea, I know it's contradictory) that reminds me of the beer my grandpa drinks."
""
""
""
"Poured an ounce or two into a pint... ended up with 1/2 inch of beer and about a 5 inch head. Far too much carbonation, IMO. Very spicy. Tingly. The first thing that came to mind about the taste was ""dish soap."" Really, not good. Big letdown from GF... I'm a big fan of their other stuff. I'll try it again... maybe it was a bad batch?"
""
"One of the most truly underrated beers out there. A very unique belgain pale ale. The closest beer it tastes like is Goose Island Matilda. Zesty and tart yet spliced with fruitiness. The only issue I run across with this beer is the carbonation. The poor resulted in an extra layer of foam. If you run across this, give it a try, a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer wasn't for me...the plastic like smell and taste drowned everything out to me..."
""
"Poured 2 oz. into my 12 ounce tulip and head overflowed. Kind of ridiculous. Took 15 min just to get the whole bottle intoy glass. Nice yeasty hop aroma with fruity floral notes. Clear golden orange once the fluff disappears off the top. A lot of funk on the flavor in a good way. I was expecting something very hop forward but this was closer to an effervescent farmhouse belgian. Very nice fruit, spice and yeast flavor with just a but of nice hop bite. A refreshing and well done brew."
""
"Mouthfeel was light and pleasant."
""
"Overall: A pretty nice spin on a Belgian style pale ale. Good zesty fruit flavors with a good dose of Brett tartness. Carbonation could of been tamed a bit."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: This is a very unique and enjoyable beer that allows that drinker to sample some obscure flavors in a beer. Very interesting and complex. Classified as a Saison/Farmhouse Ale @ 6.8% ABV. Consumed 8/8/2013."
""
""
""
"O: honestly, I am a little befuddled by this beer. It would seem that everyone I know who has had it has had a different reaction. I can't say I didn't enjoy this beer, but I can't say I did either. It continues to be an enigma to me."

"O: Is this beer supposed to taste like this or is something wrong? I don't like the sour apple hop funk taste."
""
""
"The Rayon Vert poured a hazy gold with a substantial off white head that speaks to the delightful effervescence. The aroma is all over the place with citrusy hops, some funky sourness, and a bit of Belgian yeast that sets you up for a dynamic flavor adventure. The taste is all over the flavor map in a good way with the citrus and bitter hops, some sweet fruitiness, along with some funk from the Brettanomyces that is all riding the wave of the Belgian yeast. Yes it’s all in there and it all tastes great. The flavors are delicately and deliciously balanced on a creamy medium body with plenty of that delightful effervescence that makes this a truly unique beer. I really dig this beer."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Amber hue, with a large head and some slight lacing. Nose is really piney, accentuated with citrus and other fruit notes, with a really floral character. Bitter pine and hay with a touch of fruit. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Funky for a pale ale. Is there some Brett in here? Whatever Belgian yeast Green Flash uses in their Belgian pales I'm not crazy about. Lightly tart. Fruity. Interesting. Ultimately, I don't think it's for me."

"O: Stronger in sight and smell than taste and feel in the mouth. Still, a strong member of the style. Green Flash definitely puts effort into their products."
"It was incredible!! Amazing and crazy flavor with a great nose. Although a little foamy head and a bit difficult to pour I absolutely loved it. There was something I couldn't pinpoint in the taste and that made it very interesting to say the least. Green flash has a phenomenal product in the Rayon Vert."
"The taste has an upfront toasted biscuit malt character at first which is superseded by a powerful peppery and mildly dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting beer, which I would likely have again. Certainly not a ""slamming"" beer, but one to take time and muse over. I have another in the fridge, and will likely try to pour it as slowly as possible, in order to try and avoid any cloudiness at all, just to see if it makes a difference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very foamy head with an aroma of bananas and other fruit. Slightly hoppy with lots of fruit flavor. slightly bitter after taste. There's some complexity in this brew that I have a hard time pinpointing but thats what makes it interesting Overall an interesting beer that I would have again. New to this review thing, doing my best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a semi-cloudy amber, orange color with a giant foamy head. The aroma is filled with yeast, citrus, banana, and other floral scents. The taste is quite citrusy with lots of sweet fruits with a yeasty finish. I will agree with a lot of people and say this is way too carbonated. Still quite smooth but there is room for improvement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - I typically like this style, but this one left me scratching my head. It is an odd combination of wet hay, fruit, spice and hop. I'll stick with a more traditional style, but this was good to try."
""
"Poured into a Great Divide tulip. Pours a cloudy medium golden amber with massive overproduction of foam; a careful pour was 80% foam and it took a long time to get enough in the glass for a taste; the massive head dissipated completely to a thin film, ring around the glass and pillowy lacing. Aroma of light bready malt, both Belgian and wild yeast, Belgian spicing and a hint of citrus. Flavor is very light bready malt with a strong dose of Bretty wild yeast and hints of apple and stone fruit juice. Finishes with lingering wild yeast and light hops. Light bodied. I'm not a huge fan of wild yeasts, but enjoy a touch of Brett or wild yeast to a sufficiently complex ale; this one did not support the level of wild yeast to my taste. It is light and overall pleasant, but too single note to hold my interest."
""
""
"Slightly hazy apricot with a huge, rocky head. Head settles down but maintains a definite presence. Clean, crackery malts with brett all up in the nose. Flavor: pale malts, BRETT, heavy bitterness in the finish. This is awesome. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and feels so light for 7%. Overall holy shit this is less than 10 bucks for a 4 pack??? Lollin at these low reviews. Have these people never tasted brett? This is fucking awesome."
"It has stereotypical ""Belgian"" characteristics with the bubblegum/cotton candy. It is not a Duvel. I thought it would be considered a Strong Belgian Pale because of the alcohol content and noticeable character. It is ""okay", but missing a Saaz character to balance it."
""
""
""

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a very good flavorful beer to drink for a long time"

"The flavor of this pale ale was the worst I've had from Green Flash. It was to bitter for this bitter ale and the flavor was over bitter with a vinal taste. The aftertaste on the palate was way to bitter with that vinal flavor. What happen to the aroma? The flavor does not match aroma!"
""
""
"Very bubbly on the tongue. Medium bodied and dry."
""
""
""
"-the taste is bitter and lemony with a huge wash of spices on the back end. this beer has a very eastern feel- it is very complex. i almost think that here is too much going on. i dont say this much but i feel like it is almost over done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweetish wheat malt up front. Soft candied tropical fruit notes fill in. Slightly metallic, minerally, herbal hop bitterness comes on toward the end. Somewhat-funky yeast throughout, providing a substantial ""Belgian"" twang. Juicier fruits in the finish along with pepper-ier, spicier hops. Dries out a bit. Creamy feel in a medium body that finishes with a strong undercurrent of carbonation. Nice."
""
""
"The brett flavor I get here is nice, but not quite the same as what I get from an aged bottle of Orval. Still, seeing as this is half the price and still pretty similar, it's a good option. Orval is possibly my favorite beer in the world, and Rayon Vert is a good homage."
""
""
""
""
"O: not a bad job at all! very drinkable, very nicely balanced.... i will hit this again"
""
"O: Rayon Vert matches the sweet orange scent and taste with the funky yeasts like a boss. The hyper active head is a layer complete and separate from the beer, like the icing on the cake. The combination of florals and fruits with just a little hint of bretta compliment the flavours calling out the best of each element. A delicious offering that I'll most certainly seek out again."
""
""
""
"Sublime aroma on this beer. It's like funky Belgian tropical nirvana. Hoppier than i thought it would be. The flavors seem to effortlessly marry together. This is my kind of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is not bad. It is just not what I was expecting given other reviews. It is a perfectly fine belgian IPA. But if you want a bretty IPA that smells and tastes funky, look for Anchorage Galaxy White IPA, Mikkeller Farmhouse Invasion IPA, or Grassroots/Mikkeller Wheat is the new hops."
""
"(EDIT) - I poured the dregs in halfway through and it was glorious! I would get a four pack of this beer and drink two with dregs and two without."
""
"O: Very enjoyable beer, better than I expected. worth checking out."
""
""
"So, I knew this would be overcarbed, but this was stupid. It took a pitcher to pour this 12oz bottle. Nice clear golden underneath. Retained none of the foam once it died down. Smells nice with raisin, pale belgian yeast character, some hints of grain and metal and a bit of bitterness; some green apple skins and meat come through as it warms. Flavor is fruity, apple, lemon, honeydew and grain, some clay and a touch of strep mutans (maybe that's my mouth though). Medium bodied with now minimal carb and an off dry finish. Meh, would like to try fresh because this didn't do well with the age IMO."
""
"Overall, this was tasty. It didn't wow me, but it was good."
""
""
""
""
"Rayon Vert pours a hazy, goldenrod color with the most massive head we have ever seen! The bottle conditioning with Brettanoyces creates a large amount of carbonation (especially when aged a year or more). This one takes time to pour, but be patient, the wait is well worth it. An impressive bouquet of aromas delight the senses with whiffs of lemon zest, spices, Belgian yeast and funk. Sweet malt flavors reminiscent of bread and caramel open the palate to more subtle notes of citrus and pepper with Belgian yeast and Brettanomyces funk underlining the entire brew. Extremely effervescent, this Green Flash brew is highly carbonated and medium bodied."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, cloudy, caramel color that is opaque and unfiltered. Tall, frothy, light, off-white head that laces the glass as the head recedes. Aromas of Belgian yeast funk, with notes of bubble gum, all spice, lavender, and strawberry. Lots going on in the nose on this one. Flavors are roasty and sharp, with a caramel and bready backbone supporting a blending of spices, including all spice, clove, and lemon zest. The palate is pretty dynamic, and there are more and more flavor profiles as you drink. Fruity and bready aftertaste, with a light, slightly filmy finish. Tasty brew."
"It's right up there with other top Belgian pale ales, and that's a pretty heavy-hitting list. A top notch beer in any category."

"O: as spring and summer comes on I start to move to the Belgian Pale Ales, Tripels and farmhouse ales. I just found this one here in Texas and thought I would give it a try. As long as I can get this one it will be a staple in these warm months. Every bit as enjoyable as some of the Belgian ales I enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a tough beer to rate. Did I enjoy it? Yes. I really did, but the carbonation was just too overpowering. It left the beer unbalanced and it became the focus with every sip. I really liked the beer a lot more once it warmed up. I'll leave the bottle out a bit before drinking the next one in fact. Overall, it's pretty good, but definitely not amazing."

"o: one of the better stateside belgian pales out there, great brett character and extremely solid balance with just the right touch of west coast hopping - standing out while fitting in"
""
""
"The flavor and mouthfeel of this bottle was just nearly perfect for the style. Extravagant, softly effervescent, sweet-and-tangy, and bracingly bitter in the finish. I have stashed several bottles in the cellar along with Orvals and other Brett brews, including many of my own making. I have no doubt this one will continue to develop more character and complexity for the next couple years."

"This beer tasted like it was brewed with dirty socks. At first it was okay, but the warmer it got, the more unbearable the taste became. It tasted more like some kind of strange, bitter hard alcohol than a beer... not something I plan on buying again."

"The beer is definitely more hoppy than your typical Belgian, which isn't bad at all but not my preference, but the rather piney, grassy hops mix well with the Belgian yeast and gives a pleasant drinking experience (a touch of sugary sweetness from out of nowhere helps) that ends with a crisp, refreshing experience. This was a pretty good Belgian Ale but it just seemed a little underwhelming/simplistic at times for me, although I did have to let it warm since the idiot bar I went to served it in a frozen mug and called it a triple. I am not excluding this fact as it may have killed off some of the more subtle belgian charateristics and ended up in my lower score."
"O: Overall I found the beer to be interesting and complex. I would recommend it to die-hard fans of Belgian sours, saisons, farmhouse ales, or just interesting beers in general. The carbonation seemed overdone, which makes it difficult to pour the beer (even for a highly carbonated Belgian beer). I probably won't be buying it again, but I don't regret buying it either."

"Overall - this is a great beer, I really enjoy it. I heard a lot about it from one of my friends, finally got a chance to try it thanks to liqour store in Branson, a little surprising. Condor recommended and approved"
"Very interesting beer. Must try for anyone looking for a readily available Brett fix."
"Far more Belgian (and wild) than San Diego, which I don't expect from Green Flash. Hops are just missing, really. Even as a Belgian pale, do I need quite so much Brett?"
""

"2nd pour was much more densely packed. definitely lemon meringue pie, non-moving, thick head. decent brew."

"Good Belgian, and easy drinking once the head receded a bit."

"Oh yes, I will drink this again."
"Amazing beer! Maybe GF should ditch the Cali hop bomb for Belgian Styles cause this little charmer rocks the house! Poured at a good temperature with a colossal, off-white, foamy, uber frothy, billowy head that lasts a loooong time and some clingy lace. Color is a clear honey amber with loads of small bubble trails. Aroma is spice, herbal, yeast, fruit, malt, and very complex. Flavor's similar to nose; bitter and tang are predominant while not being overdone and still, with the other qualities, still enticing. Body is lively, a tad thin, but still good. Finish is like flavor, long, and in spite of boldness, quite drinkable. World class beer! Hope to try it on draft."
"Poured a beautiful golden hue with plenty of bubbles rising through the glass with a large, fluffy white head that had to be left to settle. Gorgeous to look at. The scent was mostly the Brettanomyces funk, barnyard/horse scent, but also a very slight hint of Belgian yeast and pine. The flavor again, is dominated by Brettanomyces, a sour funk, there are also slight hints of lemon and tastes of piney hops on the finish and aftertaste. It's odd, but quite pleasant to the taste. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, but I don't feel that it detracts from the beer in any way, and rather, seems to help it. While I could due with a slight hint more malt flavors, it's still quite good and is a nice showcase of Brettanomyces and Belgian yeast which I enjoy the flavors of greatly. It's an excellent beer and I'd have it again."

"O: I enjoyed Rayon Vert more than I thought I would as I usually don't like Brett beer very much at all. I would still pick Flying Dog Raging Bitch over this in a head-to-head of American interpretations of Belgian styles (I like the malt and hops character a little more and body of that beer a lot more), but Rayon Vert is a brew I will try again as my palate continues to develop as it does serve up a wondrous number of aromas and flavors."
"Bottom line: good taste when you can get it into your mouth."

"O - A very pleasant beer balancing ease of drinking with depth and complexity of flavor. A nice bridge between hops and more wild grains, to move someone on from lighter styles such a witbiers to more interesting European ones. I really like, too, how the hops serve to accentuate and spice the other flavors (rather than overpowering them). Motion within moderation. Smooth transitions. Well crafted. Very happy."

"Overall: for AU$13 (2013) a bottle, I was getting ready for a quality Belgian ale. What I got was an exploding head that tastes like off yeast and dirt, and the distinct impression that I would have been far better off with a better and far cheaper alternative such as Leffe, Grimbergen, Kwak or Gouden Carolus. A truly unimpressive beer."

"Hazy amber orange, 3 fingers of white head, rocky with lots of lace. Smell is musty with a great deal of funk, brett, lemon, faintly acidic, a bit of yeast, moderatley hoppy as well, soapy/floral notes also there. Taste is funky with a great deal of musty brett, quite potent, yeasty and fruity the most noteable being lemon, quite substantial hop bitterness, dry initially with some lightly sweet points in there. Medium high dry carbonation,medium bodied. Nice stuff here, good brett and fruit flavours make this quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""

"O - Lots off flavor here. It is very drinkable and has a large amount of Belgian flavor. Almost wish it were a bit more simple... I must say though, I cannot see myself ever turning this one down."

"On the fence a bit with this beer, I like it and think it's well crafted but was expecting more complexity and a different Brett profile. The Brett funk shows some massive character, without it this would be very uninteresting Belgian Pale. Good summer beer, worth trying if for no other reason than to get acquainted with Brettanomyces."
""
""
""
""
"I'm kind of disappointed with this one. I'm usually very pleased with Green Flash, but this one just hasn't done much for me. It's certainly got the sour funkiness you'd expect, but there just isn't much else going on here."
""
""
""
"O- I actually enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Wasn't the holy grail of beers but one I will look for in the summer. Really drinkable and just a pleasure to drink (and look at). Bottles were super cool and retro feeling."

""
""
"Suds out the door after the pour on this one...astonishing! Pours a dark yellow orange, cloudy and great and big, too-long-lasting head. Smells terrific! Distinct notes of fruit and citrus and light flowers and bread and biscuits...very distinctive and very inviting. Tastes lightly sourish, slightly brett funky, and citrus bitter rind and grassiness near the end. Moderate sustain on the hops. Mouthfeel is fine and so is the carbonation, the foaminess only mildly irritating. Brett funk is here, but well balanced throughout. I think a good ale, the best part is the nose."
""
""
""
"O: An interesting West Coast Belgian which sports a melange of flavors that, for the most part, find a balance. At times the brew seems busy but settles to a nice smoothness as you adjust to the palate. More balanced than Green Flash's Le Freak, Rayon Vert transplants the heart of a Belgian into the body of a California ale transfused with several pints of Brett. With ample love and nursing this brew heralds the beginning of a new style of craft beers."

"Overall, I was expecting a lot more complexity from this beer. It almost reminds me of a poorly made Geuze. Might have to revisit this sometime."

"O- wow, I'm impressed with the flavor of rayon vert. Need to find some"

"In a nutshell: very decent Belgian style pale ale with brett that is quite delicious... when you can manage to get the beer out of the bottle and into your glass instead of on the counter."
"pour is a dark copper, mostly transparent, with an off white tight head. Nose is light leather, faint dust, strong lemon and citrus with a lingering leather in back. Taste is very good, dusty and leathery, bright citrus and lemon, rather bitter and semi dry in the finish. Carbonation is decent, would prefer high carb but not bad. Very balanced and tasty, solid depth. Winning!"
""
"Poured from bottle into wine glass at tap42 in ft Lauderdale. Pours an aggressive white 4 finger head on top of a golden color. Really nice brett funk...lots of grassy hay and belgian hops and yeast. Taste is farmhouse barnyard funk... slightly citrus toasty bread with some bitter hop finish. Nice budget brett. A bit over carbonated but easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is also a light with a fine champagne carbonation, adding to the sizzle and zest of the brew. Unique and tasty well worth trying. I remain not a huge fan of Belgian anything but this one was really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"San Diego swagger meets Senne Valley heritage, with predictable results - both hold up quite well, and I would proffer that the Belgian influence wins out in the end, keeping this offering from edging too close to IPA territory, Belgian or otherwise. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a nice addition to the Green Flash lineup. I am not much of a funk guy but this is well played!"
""
""
""
"It's overcarbonated for sure. It took three delicate pours to get a full glass. The hops are definitely forward which I see as a plus. There are some intense herbs throughout like sage and mint. I don't get any of the Belgian yeast funk that I would expect from the style. On the whole I enjoyed this beer, mostly for its hoppiness. I would have it again for sure."
"A good brett beer, but not a great brett beer. Give me a Matilda any day of the week, it has more balance and complexity. Still, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear amber with dense rocky white head that settles slowly to a thick cap and leaves big clumps down the glass. Smell: semi-sweet, lemon, pepper, green apple, Brett funk. Taste: spicy, slightly acetic and medicinal, mildly sweet then into a peppery finish. Medium bodied with active carbonation and a creamy feel. Nice, fairly easy drinking, use of Brett."
""
"After an initial reaction, simply due to being unacustomed to the barnyard Brett character, I developed a great liking to this beer. A very nice change from the IPA's and Oktoberfests I've been consuming mass quantities off."
""
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a light and refreshing pale and Carapils malt scent along with a mild hop nose and a wonderful yeast aroma. The yeast dominates the nose and provides a multitude of complexity. It has an earthy farmhouse feel with hints of black pepper and horse hair funk. The taste is good. It has a crisp, pale malt flavor with a touch of hop bitterness. It goes down smooth with no sign of an elevated alcohol content. It finishes dry and funky with tons of yeast character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a solid beer with excellent yeast character. It's complex, yet incredibly easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Worth the hefty price tag."
"CLOUDY ORANGE WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF HEAD ON A LESS THAT VIGOROUS POUR INTO MY STOLZLE TULIP FROM A SINGLE BOTTLE FROM FAMOUS IN LOMBARD. A BIT OF ANTICIPATION BRINGING IT TO MY NOSE, A LITTLE BISCUIT, A LITTLE CITRUS , A LITTLE UNFAMILIAR, BUT TO MY LIPS THE TASTE PUSHED IT OVER THE EDGE. ALL YOU BRETT LOVERS WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME DECREASING THE WORLD WIDE SUPPLY OF BEERS WITH BRETT . IT COULD BE TOP NOTCH BUT NOT WITH THESE FLAVORS. TRYING TO BE OPEN MINDED, BUT THIS STUFF SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT. DARE I SAY NOT A REPEAT. SORRY GREEN FLASH! AS I CONTINUE TO SIP IT, IT ISN'T GROWING ON ME. TO ME TASTE SAYS IT ALL"
""
""
"Pours amber orange with vigorous carbonation supporting lots of fluffy foam. Aroma is complex with biscuit malt, citrus and some classic funk, slightly sweet. Sweet malts and funky bretty orangey tartness are cut through with the high carbonation. It finishes slightly sweet and the funk lingers a little. The carbonation hurts the drinkability on this one, but it's still very good, and worth picking up. only a few months age in this bottle from when I bought it has already shown changes (i tried one fresh when I bought it) I'm tempted to pick up some more to age for at least 6 months or a year."
""
"That said, I still despise Brett."
""
"Although not always my first choice, I can see myself coming back to this one again."
"I really enjoyed this BPA. The Brett addition really makes this beer. It complements the fruity/spicy notes from the yeast extremely well."
"A delightful Belgian ale with hop notes and Brett. Well balanced and eminently drinkable."

"An interesting beer. Makes me want to explore this style more."

""
""
"Light to medium bodied, well carbonated, with a dry finish and citrus zest aftertaste. A really nice Belgian Pale Ale. I definitely need to try this again."
""
""
""
"Overall: this one is pretty tart and yeasty with strong herbal notes that dont get easier to drink as its consumed hurting drinkability."
""
"A cloudy light amber color with a big chewy pile of eggshell white head with loads of chunky lacing left behind. The aroma is a pleasant, polite herbaceous clove that fights back the hint of bubblegum sweetness. Intense grain and the herbal hop are a compelling marriage. The taste brings a similar effect with clove, bubblegum and murky rice/wheat/malt. The herbal, near mint tea, blends smoothly with the stubborn earthy grain for a somewhat unique mouthful of Belgian nuance. Medium bodied with a crisp feel, this is entirely loveable! Another nice Green Flash!"
""
"Light body. Dry; attenuated; slightly sticky finish."
""
"Firm and towering white head.... enormous tufts of lace and a milky-haze of yeast. Very attractive beer. The aroma is all Belgian: yeast, phenolic peppery spice and some background fruit. A bit grainy and some alcohol warmth in the taste. The beer is a little more bitter than expected, but the yeast character is pronounced and gives the beer a greater smoothness than I expected. Lingering fruit and hop finish with lots of Belgian character. Very enjoyable brew."
""
"D - Enjoyable and very complex, this is a great beer, though I don't know if it is appropriately labeled as a Belgian pale ale. The funky character is fairly strong, without any sourness, and it works well with the base beer. Very much worth trying."
""
""
"O - Wax dominates the profile and bullies some of the softer, more interesting fruit flavors in the brew."
"Rayon Vert - interesting name. 7.0%, ehh? It's very hoppy, which is to be expected from Green Flash. It's peppery and citrusy. There's also yeast and mineral. As usual, the aroma carries into the flavor and they're very similar here. The yeast really stands out with it's mineral and leather character, but the fruitiness is pretty strong as well. Additionally given the fact that this may be spiced, it's hard to tell exactly what the yeast has contributed and what's coming from the hops and the spice. It's complex, but at the same time it's the same complexity all the way through. Still, it's an interesting and bold beer that you can't ignore - think Orval with west coast hops on steroids."
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, lime, herbal, pepper, pine, earth, floral, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, orange zest, pine, herbal, pepper, clove, earth, floral, light funk, toast, and yeast spiciness. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pepper, pine, herbal, floral, earth, toast, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Awesome flavor complexity and balance; very nice hop/yeast flavor balance. Quite crisp and fairly clean on the finish. Fairly high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian pale ale! A lot of nice hop flavors with yeast spiciness; a nice clean finish, and very smooth to drink. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. THIS is the type of brew I love for summer. Full of flavor and character that demands your attention, yet it's refreshing and simple. If it had a bit more depth, it would be a home run, but I'm not complaining."
""
"Crisp and hoppy. A really nice blend of classic belgian sweetness and spiciness with a west coast hop profile. Nothing is overwhelming yet the flavors feel so big. Like a belgian style tripel with a west coast twang. Quite nice. Big yet brisk mouthfeel. Euro hop bitterness, slightly spicy finish. Tasty and drinkable. Little bit of alcohol heat but doesnt take away from the style much."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Another solid effort from Green Flash. Belgian Pale Ales are not my favorite style, but I can certainly appreciate a good one when I taste it, and that’s exactly what this is."
""
"O: Very refreshing and unique. Quite a bit of Brett character, yet a nice hop character as well. A bit too bitter for me, though."
"Really not a bad beer. Just does not hit any style buttons for anything Belgian as far as I am concerned. The four pack will be drunk, but this is not what I am going to reach for when I want Belgian anything."
"Overall this was a good beer, but it is a challenging drinker."
""
"Pours a hazy, copper color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, tart citrus, hint of hop, hint of pale malt, hint of spice, hint of grass, hint of alcohol. Fresh, strong, and pungent aroma. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of tartness, hint of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, hint of hop, and a hint of of citrus. Overall, good appearance, amazingly great aroma, but the body is greatly lacking in comparison to the strength of the aroma."
""
"And, on that note, give this beer a try."
""
""
"D - A very nice rather assertive Belgian IPA... A home run in terms of aroma... Solidly above average in all other facets... Definitely an American interpretation of the style... Tasty and something I would gladly drink again..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is a very nice brew. I do not have much experience with Belgian pale ales but I really enjoyed this beer’s hybrid qualities."
""
""
"Rayon Vert pours a bright golden-orange tone with a couple fingers of a bright white head. Its` nose comes across with citrus, brett and pine. A very nice smell to be sure. Sipping on this bpa and I taste lemons, belgian yeast, coriander and some light hops. Damn, this beer tastes good. Mouthfeel is medium, it has a rather lively carbonation to it. All in all, a very good beer that is well balanced and easy to drink. I have found it to be tasty fresh and also with a bit of age on it."
""
"O- This is pretty decent beer, very unique to say the least. I don't know how old my bottle is and if this beer is ""constantly evolving"" there's no telling here. I would be interested in trying a fresh and aged one side by side just to see the difference. As of now, i am not quite sold on Brett."
"dark golden color. great head. very bretty and funky aroma...oooh! taste starts out dry and then the funk of the brett hits you full force. wow! age has done this beer wonders. so much better than when it was fresh. medium carbonation and a mild body. great!"
""
""
"O: a well-made Belgian-style ale, but unique enough that it presents its own merits; slightly hoppier and less smooth than the Orval to which I have heard it compared"
""
"O- Fantastic! So full of Brett love, beautiful bright citrus, amazing carbonation and I'm finally glad I got around to trying this fantastic brew."
"Green Flash has spun gold with Rayon Vert. It is a simple yet shape shifting beer that offers a balance between delicacy and density. I wish to have been able to buy more bottles to track the changes this beer is sure to undergo with time, although I am mightily satisfied having tried it fresh. And I'd be mighty excited to try it again!"
"bottle"

"Very true to the style, nice bit of funk in this. This got better as this warmed, may have to revisit this"
"Poured into a chalice. Pours clear golden with a large, moderately dissipating white head. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom and side of the glass. There are citrus hop aromas as well as Brett. The beer smells sweet. The citrus from the hops comes first on the taste, but this quickly followed by the Brett. The Brett brings that nice sour flavor. The malt profile is there, bringing some sweetness to this beer that I picked up in the aroma. The flavor profile strongly reminds me of Orval. The body is on the lighter side of medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry. This is an excellent beer. I wish I could try this side by side with a fresh Orval for a proper taste comparison."
""

""
""
"O: This beer has created some heat in the BA forums lately, despite good but not exceptional scores, and it's clear why. Rayon Vert is an important American beer. Sure, it's not Orval's refined perfection, but it's a Californian take on a sort of uncategorizable Belgian style. It's also widely available for about $2.50/bottle, or about half the price of Orval and most other brett beers. I can't think of a similar American beer that's available in four- or six-packs."
"O - Fantastic BPA, and a new staple in my fridge. For a style that I think is very easy to mess up, Green Flash nails it. While entirely different, this is every bit as good as their West Coast IPA."
""
"Poured into a large tulip glass a hazed peach infused light golden with a sticky one and a half finger white head atop.Alot of citrus fruit in the nose with lighter yeasty spice and funk notes,the citrus fruit really jumps out.Fresh orange lemony citric flavors domante the flavor profile,refreshing and sharp,light phenols and funky brett are kept in check pretty well,the alcohol provides a little sweet punch as it warms.This is top notch and dangerous with its refreshing citrusy flavors,it's too easy to drink."
"I think this is a very nice beer, with lots of character. It throws a curb ball to the IPA fueled craft beer scene."
""
"Freakin’ excellent stuff. Balances the hops and brett funk perfectly. Incredibly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice Belgian Pale Ale. Really great yeast and Brett character and balance throughout."
""
"Overall – A tasty sour beer with probably one of the best aromas of a beer I have ever smelt. One I would go to again given the chance."
""
"Pours a light amber color with a huge white head. A really nice Brett character. Heavy on the fruit (especially apple), a bit of pear, lots of straw and grass, and a mild spice. Some bread and cracker and a light citric quality on the finish. The flavor is slightly tart and citrusy with lemon and lime notes. Light tropical fruit character as well as some pear and apple. Good bread and a mild spice note to it as well. Really nice."
"Taste. It appears the Californians can't control them selves with the hops. This is listed as a Belgian style pale ale. However the hops are really bitter and in your face. Not saying this is a bad thing. Actually, this is quite unique. Very tasty beer. Mouth feel is very bubbly."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great surprise from a producer of fine west coast hop nectar beverages. My wife enjoyed this one too. Very refreshing as the 12 ounces disappeared fast. I would recommend Rayon Vert to anyone who appreciates funky belgian beer. Kudos to Green Flash!"
""
"D/O- Was looking forward to this one but still very pleasantly surprised. Well integrated Belgian yeast funkiness with just enough American hop presence to know which country it was brewed in. Wouldn't hesitate to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have to freely admit that I have been under selling Green Flash. Everytime I revisit one of their beers, I am impressed. Now that they have found their way to the East Coast I'm going to seek them out. Rayon Vert is truly great Belgian IPA. If you dont like those qualities, dont drink it. But if you do, find it and see for yourself. This is a damn fine beer."
""
""
"Rayon Vert is what I drink when I am not in the mood for something as ""in your face"" as a west coast IPA. Another good beer from Green Flash. Golden color with a nice head (had this in a pilsner glass). Smooth mouthfeel with a little bit of lemon curd, grapefruit, and honeysuckle on the palate which is highlighted by a much more citrus driven hop characteristic than the West Coast IPA. Good solid beer for hop lovers that aren't looking to take a nap after putting down a big IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am very impressed with this beer. It is quite a bit hoppier than I would expect from a belgian pale ale but quite tasty. Color me a big fan of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- Very tasty beer. Would certainly by in a four pack again."
""
"A great beer if served warmer to bring everything that’s available in this beer. A nice sipping PA. It pours rather uneven and the feel is rather distracting at times, but the aroma is great and the flavor is very balanced and rewarding."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O- A really good beer, and worth trying if you like Brett. I would like to how this ages, definitely will buy this again!"
""
"One of the few beers that have inspired m to write a review in a while. Get some if you can!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This might be better than Duvel, honestly. The huge head (filled my glass all the way), but the body is that cloudy yellow I love. The smell is all lemon grass and lemon peel all the way. I get a nice hint of funk as well. It honestly reminds me of Sanctification. Very light body and very grassy with a hint of funk. Light body and very drinkable. I love this beer, and its my top BPA."
"Overall – Another brewery that can do no wrong. I've enjoyed every beer I've had from them and this one is no different. The mouthfeel is excellent and the flavours compliment each other well."
"O - A pretty good effort, like all the Green Flash offerings I've tried. It's a relatively uncomplex flavor, or I would have bumped up to an overall 4 instead of 3.5, but it's a close call."
"O- Would buy this again. A good one to try if you want to experience Brett flavor thats not overwhelming."
"O: I am a huge fan of beers that have brett added to them and this one does not disappoint. This is a great sipping beer and one that I could enjoy all evening long - I found this one real easy to drink and would happily get it again."
"O: This is a great example of an American brewery pulling off a Belgian pale with brett character. The brett doesn't overwhelm the palate or any of the other flavors of the beer. Solid job by GF here"
"O: This was a bit of a disappointment for me. It seemed too hoppy for the style and the intense carbonation made it a pain to drink."
""
""
""
"O: a nice beer, not the best beer, but a really affordable wild ale, just a bit too overpowering on the brett but nice and drinkable and complex, smell is awesome, taste is a little too repetitive though. Worth a shot if you have never tried it or are looking for widely available/cheap wild ales/sours"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm very much digging this beer. Will buy this beer again."
""
""
"O: Very impressed. Drinks very well with a nice flavor profile. The brett adds nicely to it. Might be one for aging."
""
"If this was available to me, it would be the kind of beer i'd by cases of."
""
"O: Decent beer. You have to appreciate an off-the shelf brett beer when you are in the mood for it. It's not my favorite, but I'd buy another 4-pack down the road."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a big white head that takes a while to settle and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is fruity with green apple and apricot, a bit of brett and some breadiness. Initial taste is some green apple and apricot. A bit of brett presence. Finish is bready and slightly drying. Quite nice. Light bodied. Medium carbonation. I'd be curious to see how this evolves, but not sure if I have the space."
"Will probably buy again, but mostly for the amazing aroma."
"For anyone who sees this and is thinking maybe I just don't like the style, I love Orval (just not the price tag)."
"O: This is a really pleasant beer to sip and savor and the addition of brett really makes the taste very interesting. No traces of alcohol are noticeable in the taste. I would definitely have this beer again and would even consider getting a large bomber or two to age."
""
""
""
"O. Very unique but a bit too intense. I appreciate the effort but this needs to be tamed."
""
"It's clean and crisp, but really, it does a poor job of the style, and even on its own terms it feels empty and pointless. No, not a great brew, overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is all about the brett, which is fine if you are into that sort of thing. There really is very little base beer aspects that are notable. Maybe a kiss of herbal hops on the finish along with a frontal granola grain aspect...and that is reaching. If you want a brett-bomb, this is your beer. I want to say that if you like Orval, this beer will appeal to you, but I don’t think this is as well put together."
"Tastes about the same as it smells, only the medicinal nodes are slightly more pronounced and there's a small hint of brett that wasn't present in the aroma. Fruity up front, lightly sour in the back, and then woody and hoppy near in the end. It's all great aside from that one off node, which makes the aftertaste a little offputting."
"Overall, I haven't really liked the Belgian IPAs, and this is not a great rendition of one (watery, subdued). I didn't pick up much brett - a little came out as it warmed."
""
""
"D - A very drinkable beer. THank you Green Flash!"
""
""
""
"O: It is what it is, and that's a solid no-frills pale ale with a nice brett infusion. The funk may require a little getting used to, but this is a great place to start for drinkers unfamiliar with brett beers."
""
"Tastes like olive brine, drain cleaner and perfume, all mixed together. Slight funk, probably from a souring bacteria or wild yeast, and a heavy phenolic presence I associate with infected homebrew. Those flavors combine with the massive hopping to create an artificial perfumey-chemical aroma and flavor. It's interesting, and tastes better if you keep trying and get used to it, but it never gets past 'horribly infected' to me."
""
"O- Unlike any Belgian Pale Ale I have ever experienced. Unfortunately, this won't be for everyone but for those wishing to expand their palate (or fans of Geuze beers), this is definitely one to seek out."
""
"o - really nice offering."
"O: So I came into this having had a few of their belgian offerings (grand cru and le freak come bo mind) but for whatever reason I wasn't expecting much from this. And now I know I was sadly mistaken! This is awesome!"
"O - A very interesting beer, not at all like I was expecting. Hard to ""classify"" it. Very good. I think I would enjoy it the more I have it. Will try it again..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An extraordinary American version of a distinctly Belgian style."
""
"O: A slow sipper for me. A solid beer, but not one I enjoy much or am likely to pick up again. I can see how others would like it, though."
"Overall this is a good beer that drinks well and combines funky and hoppy notes. Will be picking this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you don't like funk, you won't like this beer. Wild ale fans, seek it out."
""
"Had a very subtle taste of hops and a nice citrus appeal to it. Once again Green Flash impressed me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: fairly crisp upfront, frothy on the hold with a slippery texture and mid-range body. Sour musky fade. The brettanomyces yeast truly stands out and may not be for the faint of heart but overshadows what little hoppiness it has. Lots of barnyard funk and love the strong Belgian yeast, an aspect many American breweries tend to shy away from, this embraces it and doesn’t hold back. Youll either love it because of the yeast or be turned off."
"O: A fine BPA and one that has just the right amount of Green Flash flair with a hopped out profile and 7% ABV. Drinkable and flavorful, but not crazy about the ""horse-blanket"" aroma that I can't quite identify outside of the circus. Smell for yourself, but I'll breathe before I sip for now."
"O: I really like this, but could see it's not for everybody. Very enjoyable, but probably not all night drinker. I'm curious to see how this ages."
"Pours a murky golden copper color with a lofty, foamy off white head that kept growing, The aroma consists of some lemon, vinegar, nice and funky with some grassy notes. It tastes of bitter lemon peels with just a slight sourness, lots of citrus peel, grass a,d belgian yeast. The beer is pretty light bodied with a ton of carbonation and a dry metallic finish. I think this beer will really develop with some age, seemed quite 'raw' at this point. Still good though, dont get me wrong."
""
""
"This beer has a fair amount of minerals in the smell and taste. The sour background is like a ripening cheese. It's a beautiful beer with a fluffy crackling head."
""
""
""
"O: It’s appearance (right down to the stylin’ bottle) was its strongpoint for me, followed by the aroma. I found the taste a little bland, and the aftertaste phenol-ically clawing. If you like Green-Flash and you’re curious about their take on a BPA, give it a shot."
"O: excellent beer; I was surprised by this not knowing what I was getting into. Price point was about $3 per 12 ounce bottle where I go to get ripped off."
"I’ve had quite a few American takes on the Belgian Pale Ale style but this was probably the juiciest version that I’ve had yet, as I don’t really think that I gave those citrusy hops enough credit here in this review. The spiciness here wasn’t overdone either and helped add an extra zippy layer of attitude to this. Well done Green Flash. This is one that I will be returning to."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy golden color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of funky barnyard notes with dry hoppy notes with light floral undertones. Taste is a wonderful mix between some Brett notes with its characteristics barnyard notes which are well integrated with the dry hoppy notes with a solid malt backbone that is not overly sweet. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Great balance between the different aspects of this beer while retaining some very good drinkability."
"Overall: Seemingly Green Flash's take on Orval. Very refreshing with it's bright, tart funkiness. It has developed quite nicely over the last year; the live yeast taking on a more acerbic tone. The pineapple forward yeast definitely makes me wish that this was 100% fermented with Brettanomyces, ala Russian River's Sanctification rather than just bottle conditioned with it. This is still a wonderful example of a refreshing, funky beer. I'd definitely recommend drinking this on a hot day."

"O-this isn't quite what i was hoping for, but i enjoyed it and would maybe get it again at some point. if you want a good pale belgian, just get one from belgium"
"Rayon Vert pours a nearly opaque burnt orange, lightening a fair bit along the edges when backlit. The fluffy white head tops out at more than four fingers worth of foam, and shows pretty good retention. Lacing is noticeably weak compared to some of its authentic Belgian brethren. The nose is both aromatic and complex. The brett quickly jumps out as I inhale, surprisingly potent for a relatively young bottle. There's lots of wet hay and lemon juice, with some light pepper and horse blanket present as well. Hops do a beautiful job of filling in the gaps, lending both herbal and light tangerine-grapefruit citrus aromas. The flavor manages to follow through on just about all the promise of the nose, delivering lots of funk buttressed by some well chosen hops. Those same hops though provide a touch too much bitterness, and it just becomes abrasive against the delicate balance of flavors otherwise present. The mouthfeel is superb, with a dry and crisp body and carbonation that's sneaky in how bubbly it is. Rayon Vert is a close domestic substitute for Orval, and that's pretty high praise."

"Stupid good. For the price I think I have found my funky sour go to. Anchorage does it a bit better, but at this price I will be buying Rayon Vert 4 packs and passing by the $16 bottles."

"Ranks up there with ones from Belgium! Wow. Vigorous pour, loads of carbonation, creamy long lasting head. Nose is incredibly assertive with wild bready notes, Brett, and spices. Very carbonated and tickly on the palate with abundance of wild, bretty flavors. Incredibly silky smooth."
"This beer tastes almost exactly like my first attempt at brewing a wild ale. The style is defined here as Belgian Pale Ale, though with a brett yeast that asserts itself pretty heavily this beer is more than a pale. Dry, musty, musky, aroma and flavor. Woody, earthy, maybe some mushroom/mineral quality. Not a sweet beer at all for those of you who are looking for something that's heavy on malts. My only complain is that the mouthfeel is maybe a little thin, but otherwise for $10 a 4 pack at Whole Foods this beer is a steal. I've had Green Flash Belgians before where the yeast just didn't match the malt profile, but this one is spot on. Tastes like it should be drunk standing next to a wooden barrel, probably after stabling the horses."
""
"O - Very delicious beer with the perfect blend between funk and earthiness/fruit. This is a great take on Orval."
"A neat and welcome addition to the Green Flash Fleet--picked this up at Brawley's--particularly since the West Coast IPA went the way of wood left rotting with the pursuit of the 4-pack (anybody else feel similar slippage since they made that change--really, an ingredient difference?). Ive only seen it once on that most recent pilgrimage to Brawley's, but I'll definitely pick up another foursome if and when I see it again"

"This second one of the four is growing on me - not outstanding, but interestingly complex and fairly enjoyable."
"This beer is outstanding! Balanced with citrus, funk and malt with a lasting white head and a smell of floral, funky bliss. The body is crisp but still full for a brett beer. This is the perfect spring/summer/any time beer! In my opinion this is Green Flash's best effort! Well done!"
"Overall an interesting beer. The herbal musty funk reminds me of Orval, however I like this much more than Orval. Definitely off the beaten path. A must try."
"A nice American version of a traditional Belgian that is easy to drink and pleasant on the palate."
""
"This beer was a gift from a friend. I would seek this one out for sure. I enjoyed it!"
"Edit: had it three times since and I can say this is the greatest beer I've ever had. Genius conception and expert execution in this one. A beer to drop your jaw at."
"O - It's a good beer. Not my favorite, but good for the style. Not a bad choice to try. If you like Belgians, give this a try."
"Once I added the yeast sediment, a bit more flavor came out, pears, a bit of funk. But there was also some phenolic flavors that were somewhat offputting. Still too bitter for me."
""
"A good beer, and definitely the most affordable Brett beer out there. I'm curious to see how this one tastes in a year or two."
"O: A really nice blend of west coast American style with Belgian styles; really refreshing; great with lots of food and cheese; I will return"
"Rayon Vert is an good study in palate desensitization and/or acclimation. I started off hating it, then didn't mind it quite as much. Toward the end of the bottle I find myself tired of it. I wouldn't be inclined to drink this again."
""
""
"The aroma takes the mind to the country side, the feeling and smells of a farm come to mind and the rustic nature of the beer comes to life with earthy hops backing. The flavor is very much the smae as the aroma, I get hardy grain and spring pollen, a slight bright citrus lime flavor coming through on the finish. The mouthfeel is good but the over carbonation is covering up the body. Overall, this is an interesting beer to drink that keeps you guessing. If you like Orval you will like this. good stuff"
""
"Big head that initially fills a quarter of the glass, very fine and delicate foam of eggshell white, much better retention than expected albeit with minimal stickiness to the lacing. Cloudy liquid with a strong orange rust metallic coloration, perhaps a light brown tint while more yellow at the rims, loosely assembled but large bubbles rise swiftly throughout. Yeast, flowers, orange peel, wheat germ, apples and pears comprise most of the nose, some earthiness but not really as funky as one might expect, good density but lacks staying power. Full-bodied, here in the mouth it’s creamy and bottom heavy, sinks deeply into the palate. Develops a peppery kick as well as added grassiness, supports the tartness of the orange, lemon citrus and clove. Vague minerally aspect but, again, clean on the whole. Dry, the pear, peach, apple fruit feels cellar dried, most of the sweet juiciness gone. Manages to not appear overtly hoppy nor malty, minimal breadiness or doughiness. The citrus outlasts the rest. More interesting than pleasurable, little is casual about it."
"O: For me, this beer is controversial. It's complexity confuses. Others have mentioned this beer is a homage to the mighty Orval. There certainly are parallels, however it does not have the complexity of Orval. For this style, this beer truly delivers."
""
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very, very nice."
""
"O - A very nice take on a Brett beer. It's not as balanced as Orval but I like the way it is more hopped up both fruit-wise and bitter-wise."
"M/O - Medium body with great carbonation. The brett definitely turns this beer into something very good and Green Flash pulled it off well. Slightly velvet-like on the palate and finishes semi-dry but aftertaste fades quickly. For $9/4-pack it's not a bad deal an affordable brett-beer that doesn't suck."
""
"Light body with some expansive carbonation. Lingers on the pallet nicely. Overall this one is pretty enjoyable. A nice west coast take on some a Belgian style."
"Overall, this is very good beer, and surprising in the potency and balancing effect of the hops, setting this brew firmly aside from most of the Belgian Ales. Personally, I find the hops a great addition, and think more beers of this style should follow suit. The beer is still well-balanced, even with the hops. The 7.0% ABV does come out a bit, giving the brew vodka-like alcoholic vapors, and the sourness is slightly strange, but for the most part this is great fare. Worth trying."
"Overall - A good beer in a style that i haven't had much of. The flavor of the brett takes a bit to get used to but is enjoyable."
""
"This is a really fantastic beer and I'm beyond excited that it's year round. This is finally an off-the-shelf year-round beer that is worthy of sitting beside sixers of Two Hearted in my fridge. Bravo, Green Flash."
"O: If their plan was a homage to Orval, I think they did them justice. it's a solid brew for sure. Just like Orval, the earlier you get it the more hops you'll get. The later, the more Brett you should pull. I'd be interested to see what this one tastes like down the road."
""
""
""
"For me, this beer is almost like a hybrid between a pale ale and a geuze. It has a stony dryness that is reminiscent of Duvel, yet also has a slight sour Geuze-like note to it as well. The flavor is very appetizing and dry and the price is not prohibitive. Sadly, since I haven't yet tried an extensive variety of Belgian-style beers, I feel that the novelty of this beer (with its use of Brett) is a bit wasted on me. I shall have to try it again after I've had an opportunity to experience a few more beers."
"O- This is my second Green Flash beer. Either my taste buds are uneducated or something is a miss for me with this brewery. Could it be ""Brett""? Only asking as I have not had that style. There is an aftertaste here that I am simply not a fan of."
""
""
""
"Oh I should have bought more. This tastes like not fresh, but somewhat young Orval for the creeping Brett character. Right now it provides a gentle tang and is beginning to roll over the mild caramel malt taste and Belgian spice. I mean it's clearly a Brett beer. There's the trademark horsey farmhouse funk, but it hasn't overun the ale yet. Very cool beer. Admirably balanced for an American craft brewer, I've had too many failed attempts at sours by domestic breweries. I don't think this beer is at it's most complex yet, but still check it out, this is a very cool beer."
""
""
""
"O: I wish they'd bottle date; I get the feeling my bottle isn't really that fresh. That's probably the only thing stopping me from buying more in the future, probably by the case. Otherwise, this is drinkable, refreshing, and affordably priced."
""
"A real winner from Green Flash sure to appeal to fans of brett beers."
"Overall: A very nicely done Belgian pale with Brett. A bit too much hops bitterness detracts a bit from the flavor and the overall enjoyment, but very well done. I'll definitely get this again. Its also a good cheap way to show someone what Brett smells/tastes like."
"O: Crisp, refreshing and yeasty. Very balanced and flavorful showing some subtle Wild Ale characteristics. An excellent value. A 4-pack was about $12 in PA. This is just excellent for the Brett lover."
""
"O: This is fantastic beer as I've certainly come to expect from Green Flash. Really like America meets a Dupont/Orval collab, very well done. I liked this a lot. At $9/4-pack it's a true steal this day and age. I've seen a ton worse for $10+/750 mL that's for sure. This is just really good beer."
"Golden orange with a massive white head. Only slight lacing. A sweet and funky smell; sugary lemon, hay, and some pepper. Flavor starts off with some lemon and apple that leads into some tartness, some pepper, and sugared hay. Funky. Crisp, medium bodied to this. A nice brew for sure, the funkiness to this certainly adds a uniqueness to the style. They do it well but not sure I prefer this approach to the usual."
"The mouthfeel was very zesty on the tongue. Medium bodied with plant of carbonation."
"Overall: Really an exceptional beer. I can see why the brewers at Green Flash were excited to release it, and I hope it's successful. Will pick up more if I see it in Boston or NYC."
"I would like to try the beer again in a blind tasting; perhaps with an open mind, I might have a different tasting experience. But for me, it doesn't rank among the better Belgian Pales, and it certainly doesn't compare to Orval."
""
"O - Probably the most authentic Belgian beer that I have tried out of the U.S. and there have been so many let downs."
"Highly carbed & fluffy. Refreshing. A better Orval knock-off than say, Russian River Damnation. Something I will return to."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was very impressed by this Green Flash offering. The aroma and taste were phenomenal. It has the bite of a BPA, with a bit of saison funkiness/tartness. The flavors melded well, and it has an impressively refreshing character for a 7% beer. Great for a hot day. I will certainly get this again."
""
""
"Nice refreshing beer."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip. Even with a gentle pour, an enormous, fluffy white head forms immediately and lingers with the amber beer. The liquid is fairly hazy, even taking care not to disturb the yeast. The nose is brett: horsey, some hay. Brett and barnyard dominate the front of the flavor profile too, followed by a light pear or green apple. The finish is exceptionally dry, with a bit of grain. It's a light bodied beer that is quenching and very easy to drink. Very nice."
""
""
"O/D - Weird mouthfeel and less sourness than the aroma. If those issues weren't there this would be a really nice beer. Good but lacking."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is fine, I guess, for an IPA with Belgian tendencies. It's dry and lively with carbonation. It works. Overall, though, this is a beer in need of some refinement. It's reasonably tasty, but it mimics Orval without capturing it's true refinement and magic. It's probably the best American attempt at capturing Orval, for what it's worth."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. It really is not my favorite style, but I find the style very intriguing. There is a great deal of complexity in general, and this ale does not disappoint in that regard."
""
""
""
""
"Smells of pepper and spice mostly. Light hints of sweet honey like malt countered with grapefruit and zest. Taste is spicy with pepper, lightly sweet with honey like malt, lemony and citrusy with hops. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a fizzy syrupy chalky mouthfeel. Decent Belgian pale that I'm glad I got to try, but probably not something I would seek out again."
""
"Orange with some lighter browns scattered in the body. Fluffy white head with good retention and some splotchy lacing. Nose has some dill, underripe citrus/citrus zest, pale malts and some spicing that's somewhat sharp in nature. Good sweet balance however. Taste has more dill, citrus zest, some mild Belgian yeast notes/spicing. Grainy pale malts. Light flavour but subtle and complex. Drying, with a hint of tartness in the finish. Flavourful, gentle and interesting - a nice complex Belgian pale that's quite easy to consume. Something I'd revisit."
"Nice beer to drink, refreshing for hot days, enough going on to drink whenever. Seems to execute well what it set about to do."
"Pours a hazy golden hue which leaves a two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is a touch of farmhouse funk,peaches,blackberries,white grapes and grassy herbal hops and i find the Brett really dominates the aroma,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and abit overcarbonated with tastes of peaches,farmhouse funk,bready malts and finished with a bittersweet finish of herbal hops and candy and overall its nice and very drinkable but not really something for special occasions just a solid session beer for me cheers."
""
"O - This beer is well brewed and is a nice venture to a style not seen very often in the U.S. (that I know of so far). Coming from Green Flash, I wouldn't expect anything less - nicely done."
"Overall blown away by this. A really well-conceived Orval tribute and an instant classic."
"Coming from Green Flash I expected this to be much hoppier, not a complaint though. It goes easy on the brettiness and hops while still remaining interesting and tasty."
"Carbonation is a little full on for my liking."
"D - The brett yeast is a bit soft compared to what I expected, though I still enjoyed the aroma. Taste really didn't bring anything new to the table."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a massive white head. Steadily fades to a thin layer of foam with nice lace. Aroma has a soft funky brett presence with light fruit, Belgian yeast and spice. Enjoyed this after it warmed up and carbonation died down a little bit. Sweet fruit and malt blend with earthy and funky saison like notes for a refreshing, balanced BPA. Very exciting to see this year round."
"Overall - I think this one tastes a lot like boulevards saison-brett, which was one of my favorite beers this year and the fact that this is so available and you can lay some down to let the brett develop more is amazing. pair this one with some whole milk bleu cheese or gorgonzola and you are in heaven. This is fantastic. Top 5 of the year so far."
"Overall. Nice bold experiment here. The tastes don't work especially well togethe but I still enjoyed it as something different."
"O- this beer is awesome!! And I could see it being really awesome on a nice hot summer day, nice tart citrus funk, very well done."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a pretty solid beer. It had a nice balance between the Brett and the citrusy hops. It was crisp and clean with some really nice flavors. The Brett was well done as well. Very good beer overall and a very impressive American version of a classic style."
"Very refreshing. Definitely a great beer for a hot day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a tasty, interesting, and fulfilling beer. I'd have this again and again."
"Overall: A decent beer. Not terribly complex. Drinkability is high."
"Medium-bodied with medium carbonation allows this to be pleasantly fizzy, but generally smooth and clean. Finish is quite dry with slight stickiness from, perhaps, malt."
"Probably my favorite Green Flash beer. Layers of complexity, extremely drinkable, and super refreshing. This could be a regular in my fridge. Reminds me of Orval."
"O: A thoroughly enjoyable beer that's well made and drinkable."
""
""
"This beer pours a slightly hazy orange-yellow color with a comically big head, even when paired carefully. This, combined with the very high level of carbonation creates a fantastic looking beer, easily as good looking as a Duvel. The aroma is a solid amount of spice and Belgian yeast, with a bit of hoppy American backbone. The taste is solid, with the funky Brett contributing quite a bit to the flavor. It interacts nicely with the citrus hop profile often associated with an American IPA, without quite becoming the flavor mishmash often referred to on this site as a Belgian IPA. It's quite complex, with peppery and yeasty flavors contributing to the overall effect. The mouthfeel is extremely carbonated and goes down easily, and the drinkability is good. Overall, one of the better Belgian Pales I've had. I'm really not fond of the style in general, but I wouldn't turn this one down."
""
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, cinnamon and a fruity yeast. In the taste, green apples, and a cinnamon like spice. A spice bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry green apple skin and cinnamon in the aftertaste. Quite apple like, big cinnamon spice, yet very nice."
"O: A Great American interpretation of the Belgian Pale Ale"
"O: This is a very solid beer, but a ballsy move for Green Flash. A funky Belgian Pale released year-round in four packs? That is a swift departure from the hoppy west coast stuff that dominates the rest of their year-round portfolio. It takes most people a little while to warm up to funk. I love the idea of a readily-available and wallet-friendly funky Belgian, but it remains to be seen how the average American craft beer drinker will receive it."
""
"O - Decent beer, Would probably drink again. Not overly impressive but good enough to drink if i needed something differnt."
"This brew from Green Flash lives up to their standards. Nice pour with a beautiful head that smells of citronella and lemon. The taste also has notes of citronella and citrus fruits with a pleasant body/mouthfeel. This beer was perfect for an 80 degree day on the 1st of March 2012. (Good finish)"
"o - Overall I've never seen or heard of this beer, but liked it quite a bit. I thought the body was great and the taste was really nice, with a good mix of brett, citrus, and fruit. Glad to have another bottle of it."
"Overall not bad, but as I've said, it certainly tastes like an Americanized beer, with nowhere near the complexity of the brew I think its trying to mimic. That said, though, this is certainly a candidate for the cellar, and its ageability gives it a few extra points."
""
"Overall pretty good, I'm def impressed with the special belgian funky beers I've tried from Green Flash so far. Nice combination of great hops, light golden malts, and Belgian funky yeast combinations that blend really well and don't overpower in any category. Still very drinkable despite the big heavy yeast, hops that want to get heavy and never do, and the 7% abv. I could drink plenty of this."
""
"Rayon Vert is Green Flash!"
""
"Notes: Another stellar offering from Green Flash, a surprise maybe given the style and intensity, but not so much thinking of their average quality. A nicely hopped take on a brett Belgian ale, which sure enough draws a mental connection with Orval. This one might become a regular in the fridge selection..."
""
"This is pretty kick-ass. Glad to have landed a four-pack. Didn't mean to crack this one open at 4:30 in the afternoon, but I dropped it against another bottle and it hissed at me. Very enjoyable Belgian Pale (a style I must pay more attention/respect to). Recommended!"
"Beer is light and airy on the palate, heavily carbonated, strong beer overall, I like the finish, not too dry, yeast dominates the palate overall, a very strong funky beer. Decent I'd have it again. Much better than Treasure chest."
""
"O - A delightful surprise! Very well rounded! Delicious! Well done Green Flash Brewers. Highly recommended."
"If you like brett give it a try."
"Notes: Dam this one has a very dry finish and tasty as well. Cheers."
"O - A really nice offering from Green Flash, I'd be curious to see how it ages."
"O: The plastic flavor and inability to live up to its nose disappoints me. The aroma really pulled me in, but the taste let me down. I’ll try this again in the near future to double-check my palate."
""
"Overall this is pretty darn impressive."
"Drink- Overall, a good beer but not a great beer. Needed a bit more restaint and layered balance"
"O- A really nice interpretation of a belgian pale. I highly recommend this, especially to people interested in funky beers, but not ready for or desiring a punch you in the mouth sour beer."
"It is obviously a high quality beverage. It is stunningly beautiful in the glass. It is very fragrant, but the smell is the same as the taste, and I don't really like it. It was very expensive too. I do not intend to buy this again."
""
"I like this one. It is light and drinkable, with good peppery flavors."
""
"This is for sure a poor mans Orval. $10/4-pack or $5 a bottle. One of these days I'll do a side by side so I can find the difference. Until then I give the nod to Green Flash for copying Goose Island and coming out with a year round Brett finished golden Belgian Ale"
""
"Really liked this beer & will buy again when I'm in the mood for something Belgian-ish."
"12 pz bottle pours a deep amber with massive fluffy head. Aroma is earthy with lemon and a bit of alcohol. Taste is peppery and lemony citrus hops, and coriander. Fairly thick mouthfeel with dry finish. I'm typically not into Belgian styles, but I'm coming around and this one is very enjoyable."
"A well done Belgian pale ale. The Brett makes itself obvious, but still allows some other flavor notes to come through."
"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, a bit prickly and sticky on the palate. This had a nice combo of funky and tart with some other balancing flavors - definitely something I'd drink again."

"One can’t help but compare this to Orval type beers, this is far, far better than the latest incarnations of Matilda (the last really good batch I had was 2005), and even gives Orval a run for its money (though I wouldn’t put this on that level quite yet). I can’t wait to see how these age, but I wonder that the Brettanomyces character is already so pronounced; this can’t be that old yet, and the Brett is extremely noticeable already, young Orval is barely kissed by the Brett, so I will be curious to see how these age. My one worry is that the plastic character from the Brett will get a bit out of control as the beer ages. Visually this beer is about perfect, from memory it seems a touch darker than Orval, but I could be wrong, and the extensive, long lasting head is quite impressive. This beer sets itself apart from Orval in its use of expressive, fruity and citrus laden American hops; as a sucker for many an American hop, I can’t help but love this beer more for that."
"On the bottle it says continuously evolving, so I might try to get some for aging. This is a decent Belgian inspired Pale Ale, but I have had better beers by Green Flash."
""
"Overall this one is a winner. A hopped-up belgian pale with a nice combination of tangy flavors and high drinkability."

"Overall Impression- From the beginning of the pour, this was a strange brew! I'm not sure what a ""Belgian Pale Ale"" should be but this guy was abnormal! The musky finish, non-characterstical hop flavor, and unusual carbonation levels did not make any positive influence on my review of this one. Won't be going back to this one again! Thanks for the try Alex and if you haven't had this one yet, your not missing out..."

"Green Flash Rayon Vert glides into the glass easy like with a bright orange glaze with some golden specs and a lively frothy creamy bright white head that stays and sticks. Smell is very pungent and fresh with ripe fruit, Belgian yeast, floral notes, some flower, and fresh earthy scent. Wow, this smells inviting. The brett jumps out with some sniffs. Taste is just as fresh as the scent. This is leaps and bounds the best Americanized Belgian pale ale i've had in some time. Fresh fruity esters, bubblegum, fresh grass notes, lemon, orange, bready notes and more. Yum! A great Melange that works. Feel is at about medium with ample and sparkling carb. Flavor grabs ahold of the mouth and kicks it into gear. No sign of the alcohol, which is a tad high. This beer works, it kicks ass in feel and has alot of flavor. Im getting more."
""
"Overall I like it but am not wowed by it. I’m really curious to age this and see how it develops over time, so I will probably buy more for that purpose. Otherwise I think there are better brett beers out there, though maybe not this inexpensive."
""
""
""
"Note: this is a beer that REALLY wants to be served at the correct temperature (45-50ºF), and personally I think the flavors come out better the warmer it is so aim for 50. It'll make a very big difference."
""
""
"Very refreshing, balanced, and tasty."
"O – Overall, I find this to be an excellent beer…perhaps straying into a style other than intended by the brewer, but quite good nonetheless. Could perhaps use a bit more of a hop presence (anybody ever think that could be said about a Green Flash offering?) to bring it more in line with the style, but on the other hand, it might end up giving this a bit of a negative effect. Balance is good and flavors and aromas are well nuanced. Definitely give this a shot if you enjoy the Belgian yeasty flavors in your beer."
"O: You can check the box marked ""win", as Green Flash has produced a sure fire, everyday funk fix for those in need. I couldn't see myself knocking back more then one in a sitting, but it's none the less a well put together brew, and something I can easily recommend."
""
""
"Seems a little more bitter than the last time I tasted it. I was a little taken aback, as I thought it was perfectly balanced before. Will be interesting to see if it's evolving in the bottle with all the sediment and bacteria. Four-pack of 12 oz bottles from Barons Marketplace in San Diego"

"Very Good Bretty Belgian Ale, will be enjoying more of these in the future."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"nice orval homage here. burnt orange with an off white head that holds and leaves lace. nose is hops and spicy phenols with a bit of caramel and sweet grain giving it a backbone. tastes what the nose eluded to... us hops on top of spicy yeast and just barely sweet malt, all with just a subtle funk to it. medium body with a slight twang from the brett and slight tickle of strong carbonation like it should. not blown away by this one, but extremely satisfied, and happy to see a brewery attempt their own twist on one of my all-time favorites. bottle says, ""continuously evolving"". i am curious to see where this is in about 4 months."

"Overall Rayon Vert is a tough beer to describe - I want to compare it to both Russian River Temptation and Duvel. At times the bitterness is unwelcome, but I do enjoy Rayon Vert considerably."
"Overall a pretty good Belgian pale ale in a market that is crowded with better ones."
"definitely not for me. flavors just do not mesh well."
""
""
"Green Flash did a pretty nice job with Rayon Vert. It won’t be confused with the world’s finest, authentic Belgian Pales, but it is a nice take on the style. The use of Brett and hops works very well and doesn’t make it overly complicated. That was my fear. It’s good stuff. Grab a bottle or two if you see it."

"D/O: This beer stands out among high-volume, American-brewed Belgian-style ales in that it pulls no punches in its handling of brettanomyces yeast. While the standout brett notes are not unique to this beer, it does as good a job carrying the distinctive rustic notes as any American-brewed beer yet encountered. While not quite truly tart, it does come equipped with a driving acidity that strips the palate, ushering renewal with every well-carbonated sip. A telling move for Green Flash to add this beer to its year-round core lineup; it elevates the brewery above the middle ground of operations that make a decent IPA."
""
"Brings good yeast, citrus and floral flavors as well as some other things. It all balances out quite nicely and makes a very drinkable beer. The yeast profile makes me think of a nice Saison and a tad like Orval. I can see how this beer might take some heat trying to emulate Orval but not many American breweries make Belgian Ales this tasty."
"The palate is quite fruity with some citrus (ripe oranges), sugar and honey. The mid-palate is where the Brett is more expressive. Dry, earthy Brett with plastic and a little clove. Honey and citrus linger on the finish, but the blend of the honey and the Brett isn't particularly impressive right now, making this rather unpleasantly spicy. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this feels pretty decent on the palate, but still, a little too sweet. Decent, I will revisit this simply because it's so cheap, but I do wish they dialed down the alcohol to 5.5 or something. This definitely ain't no Orval."
"A solid Belgian Pale Ale. Highly carbonated with a massive pillowy head. Golden amber color. Assertive spicy phenolic yeast notes, calling to mind Orval. Lots of orchard fruit notes - pear and slightly overripe apple. Some pepper from the alcohol. A lot going on here - almost too much."
""
""
""
"Overall this is mild and pleasing beer but not an outstanding one."
""
"Bottle. Clear orange color. Nice, very dense and big and solid light tan head, that more or less stays put. Light carbonation, very smooth. Some dryness, good texture, sort of estery. Interesting, hard to describe aroma... Some lemon zest, also spice in the hops. Taste is some bitter, zesty sweetness, and some balanced spice. Good, interesting, tasty brew. A nice Belgian-style."
"Overall: (4/5) This is a beer with character and a beer for all seasons (though would be a great summertime brew in particular). It is refreshing, quaffable, tasty and–very importantly–a successful departure from the run-of-the-mill, formulaic Belgian-style pale ales many American breweries have produced. While perhaps few people would accuse it of being a rare delicacy, this is a beer that will please beer-drinkers of differing and diverse tastes. Green Flash has a solid beer on its hands–one that should come in six packs (not four)! This beer was a pleasant surprise and I will be buying more of it. Definitely recommended."
"its better than average, but its a weird brew. smells like a well hopped belgian yeasty pale ale, which it indeed claims to be, but the flavor is more akin to a wild or sour ale. very pungent yeasty funk going on, totally dominating in fact. good malt balance and hop accents underneath, but i think the balance is off. mouthfeel is way too carbonated here. or maybe just in regards to its medium to heavy body, which seems an improper paradox here. 7% abv is nice and works well, but this one could use a tune up. lots of potential here."
"This beer has an intense flavor profile, and if you like Brettanomyces I would highly recommend it. With the strong hoppiness I would label it more of a Belgian IPA really. I like the aging potential here, so I think I might buy a couple more bottles. Too bad I waited so long to try this. I guess I've been down on Green Flash lately, but this is a step in the right direction."

"Wow, this time around I really enjoyed it. Big smells and tastes of Brett make me think this was brewed in Belgium! All the other flavours I mentioned above are there and they *do* work together very well. Review score adjusted.."

"12oz bottle from a four pack that was $9 I believe. I've been avoiding Green Flash beers due to the lack of bottle dating, change to four-packs, and price hikes but this one sounded very interesting so I broke my boycott. Bright orange at first and then very hazy as the yeast makes its way into the glass. Little bit of head and a little lace on the glass. The smell is fruit, slight hops and a very subtle hint of the brettanomyces yeast, not bad. The flavor is a little fruity and then a hint of bitterness that reminds me of aspirin without being offensively medicinal. Sort of dry on the tongue too. Overall? good enough that after buying a single I went back for a couple more four-packs."
"D - Reminded me a lot of Green Flash Treasure Chest. It's fairly easy to drink, but the house brett strain produces some flavors I don't enjoy - too medicinal, with more plastic and band-aid than I like."
""
"Of course this beer is not the classy Orval, but is a classy diatribe of the original in its own right. Though it's not as complex or as dry as its mentor, it's a great substitute especially when considering the difference in cost."

"O - was really surprised at the quality and uniqueness of this beer. two just went down in the cellar. can't wait to see what it turns into over the years"
"I really like this beer and drink way too much of it..."
""
"Pouring gently produces a great head,, ecru, puffy, uneven, leaving lace behind. Smell is a nice balance of malt, honey, dry brett yeast, hops. The taste follows the profile perfectly. I'm picking up a dry smell of plastic or band aid-ness, butt nothing to deter from the enjoy-ability of the beer. Great beer, can't tell it's 7%"

"Overall I have had more balanced Belgium pale ales but this one seems to be a Belgium IPA since the level of hopping is kind of excessive. One and done."
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer has a crisp, clean swallow and dry finish. The body is a bit sticky and is definitely coating but is far from syrupy. The carbonation seems a bit weak at first but is definitely helping this beer's drinkability. A little more carbonation would be nice but isn't necessary."
"One of the more livelier examples of a BPA. Perhaps not as authentic but still a good way to go about business."
"O: Dang good beer for this style - well done GF"

"O- A good attempt at a Belgian Pale Ale, but it's lacking on overall flavor. Maybe I have met my Lupulin threshold. Enjoyed the one, but won't be seeking it out in the near future."

"I would like to award Green Flash an additional .02 for great bottle look. Labels are clear and simple and the bottle shape is fantastic."
"Brett, yeast, apples, pears, spices, and well....this is a pretty good example of American's doing a Belgian pale ale. The carbonation and body are both wonderful. Sadly I'm not a huge fan of these flavors. There's an almost scotch like element mixed in with fruity and sour notes. I don't like how this all blends as far as flavors go."
""
"A unique-tasting Belgian pale with the menthol so prominent. I like it but didn't love it."
"so, I'd have it again, but not if I were looking for BPA. Hoping for more depth out of the brett as this ages too..."
"Medium bodied with a slight creamy texture, zesty spicy musty, dry Brett and light fruit.  Pretty complex with dry funk that lingers throughout over hints of pepper, clove, apple, pear, bread and alcohol sweetness. The musty brett is dominant but really well integrated into the flavor of the base.  Complex but well balanced and extremely drinakble."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 3 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap. Thick chunks of lace stick to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of herbal and grassy hops with some funky Brett aromas. Taste is of herbal hops, some grains, and earthy flavors on the finish from the Brett. A quick band aid flavor comes and goes quickly. There is a mild bitterness and slightly funky aftertaste with each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation level with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is an interesting beer for sure. I read they might have been going for an American Orval but this one just isn't as good."
""
"Also, I'm curious to see how it will age and what it will taste like when the hops fade a bit, so I think I'll throw a bottle or two in the cellar."
""
"I didn't like this bottle, fresh from Pizza Port Carlsblad store. So if you disagree you needn't read any further. A light golden body with a white foamy 3/8"" head, lacy. Funky aroma - armpit sweat, menthol, my socks wt and used. The taste is comparable to floor wax, foot liniment, and pepper. Lots of menthol build up as I drink further into it, but it is not all that drinkable and I am forcing myself. Crazy stuff."
"Would like to see this with lover abv as I think it would be a great session beer, or aperitif"

"T: The brett is definitely there but it's nice and light and allows some light fruit flavors, grassy hops and some bready malt to come through. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Pretty good stuff though."
""
"overall: nice impulse purchase"
"Overall: This was a weird road on the BPA style. This is what I would be expecting out of sour beers. I love Brett, but not sure it works well with the style. Drank the beer, but GF might need to work on this one a little more. Brett overpowers the citrus and fruity notes that I am used to in most BPA's. Somewhat still enjoyable though."
""
"Of all the beers I tried at GF, this was my favorite. I can't believe it's year round. They really melded the best of the West Coast hoppiness with the Belgian Tripel spiciness. It's good on tap or in a bottle. The yeast still shows through when on tap. Not much else to say about this beer except that you need to drink it."
""
"Overall, this is certainly an interesting beer. I like it and would buy it again. It'd be interesting to compare this with Orval and other high Brett beers. Cheers!"
"I still get a hop bite but it’s all bitterness with a clean finish. While it doesn’t develop like an Orval I have no complaints as to its taste. A poor man’s Orval? I’ll still take it."
""
""
"Overall: A tremendous achievement for Green Flash; although I enjoy a lot of their hoppy beers, I had no expectation that this brewery could produce a beer like this one"
"The name, Rayon Vert, is appropriate, as Rayon Vert IS what Green Flash is all about. It might as well be the flagship beer for the brewery as much as any of their other offerings. Total quality, through and through. They remain one of the most consistently excellent U.S. brewers, and if the lack of constant new (bottled) offerings is frustrating, it's easy to remind oneself about the quality they continually offer, and then all is A-Okay."
"Pours a clear, golden orange color with a LARGE white head that has a slight orange-cream colored hint to it. Head takes a little time to go down. Scent immediately reminds me of fresh Orval. Brett funk with nice hoppiness. Some citrus and floral notes nicely meshed with barnyard. Taste is ALSO very much like fresh Orval, wow, this can only mean one thing...I LOVE THIS BEER! Disclaimer, I'm drinking this one at room temp, and it's tasting awesome. Immediate floral hoppiness with some slight Belgian yeast flavors. Then you get tasty Brett flavors and barnyard funk. Finishes dry and slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is crisp and somewhat velvety...dry finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is just great IMO. I need to go buy more of this."
"Tangy, dry, and effervescent. Lingering bitter root earthiness and dry herbal bitterness. Smooth with some wet hay and dried wildflower notes. Brett complexity is big, but the wildness is reigned in. Orval-esque. Everything is pretty nicely balanced here. Cellaring this would likely bring out the funkier side of the wild yeast. A nice introductory Brett beer that i'll definitely drink more of."

"Sparkling, deep gold color after leaving most of the sediment behind in the bottle. A nice, fat head crowns the top, dropping slightly to a clumpy, frothy covering. Lovely, funky Belgian aroma...spicy, bright lemon, herbs, pear, and leather. Flavors of clean, zesty citrus, grass, phenolics, light earthy hop bitterness, and dry, estery yeast. Funky with a mild sweetness. Medium bodied, slightly creamy, and a little drying. Good stuff! Pulls off the style very well for a US brewery."
""
"Overall a really nice Belgian IPA if you ask me."
"O - This is fantastic. It's my favorite beer of the year so far."
"Pours a clear, light copper color with about three fingers of white, whispy foam which slowly deflate. Good retention and lots of lacing. Quite a bit of brett, vanilla, tart citrus fruit. Taste is not quite as impressive, and a little muddled: brett, moderate citrus and piney hops, finishing bone dry with moderate bitterness. More integration would go a long way. Or maybe the hops have just faded some and that's what I'm picking up; can't tell. Medium-light body and carbonation. Overall, interesting and quite drinkable. Pairs perfectly with spicy Indian or Asian food."
"Spicy hops and spicier yeast is the motif of Rayon Vert. Leafy, herbal hops combine with Belgian yeast esters and a kiss of funk from the Brettanomyces. The 7% is well hidden until the end, where a hit of warming alcohol flashes across the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly with a dry, medium body. Overall, a fairly tasty beer, but I was expecting a bit more from Green Flash given the ingredients to this beer. Perhaps after a few months of aging the Brett will really start to shine."
"Good offering from GF. I would purchase this more often along with my regular Hop Head REd fix. Very good flavors a nice balance and definitely a nice take on the BPA style."
"D- Enjoyable and one that I find is worth sipping on to see how the beer develops as it warms. Not a bad example of an American made Belgian pale ale. I’d be interested to see how Green Flash develops this in future batches. Recommended to those that like beers like Orval and Ommegang BPA."
""
"Medium bodied. Dry. Nothing to write home about on mouthfeel."
"Good, but not quite as good some others such as Flying Dog's Raging Bitch or New Belgium's Belgio."
""
"O- A very unique tasting beer. I like it, but not sure how often I would go reach for a beer like this. I heard this is very similar to Orval, which I had recently and did not like. I notice some similarities in aroma and a little in taste, but I actually like this beer and did not care for Orval at all. I don't get the overly bitterness and salty qualities I got with Orval."
""
"Light with good amounts of carbonation. Easy sipping flavorful complex brew. Could very easily be my new goto summer higher alcohol beer."
"A very good interpretation of a Belgian Pale finished with Brett. A little over-carbed. Good Brett presence. I will be purchasing this again."
"A quality belgian ale. The wild yeasts add good complexity along with a real good feel."
""
"Nice Belgian inspired, San Diegoacized brew."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet, no date but fresh. This pours a nice amber color with a massive off white head which lasts for a while. The smell is pretty good, a little bubble gum, a hint of funk, lots of malts. The feel is medium lots of carbonation. The taste is good, a little funk, some barn yard, Belgian esters and a little bitterness, very good, I'm looking forward to seeing how this one changes."
"O - This was a good beer that i am happy to see come on the scene from an american brewer. Its not as good as Damnation and has lots of room for growth, but its a great first atempt. I'll give this a shot after a few months again."
""
"O- Not my favorite style, but drinkable and smooth."
""
"O: A pretty good beer, overall. There's a nice combination of sweet and funky, and it smells wonderful. I'd like the BPA aspects to shine through a bit more in the flavor and to have a drier body, but still it's a cheap alternative to the likes of Orval."
""
"Overall, an interesting take on what seems to be an increasingly popular style for breweries to take on. I like it because it takes the pale ale to different level...not necessarily a better level, just a place that offers some new flavors from a classic style. Green Flash does a pretty good job with it here."
""
""
"Overall - Really tasty and easy to enjoy. Not too sweet, not to bitter, and not too strong. Nice twist of the west coat hops to make this different from the rest. I find this really enjoyable and not as expensive as some of the other green flash brews. Will drink this oen again for sure."
""
"O - This is a really well balanced and very enjoyable offering from Green Flash. I would really like to see how this one continues to develop over time."
"I enjoyed this ale a lot. It's very well executed and a delight to sip. I would like to get a few more bottles to see how the Wild yeast vary."

"A very flavorful beer; nice hop profile. It could use more of a belgian yeast profile."
"Green Flash have said they spent four years developing this brew. Their efforts have paid off. This a great Belgian style ale. Light and refreshing with a good bit of heft. Their love of hops shines with out overpowering things. The brett adds just enough funk with out over powering. Reminds me of Orval in a way. It will be interesting to see how the brett changes and evolves this beer overtime. As is, Rayon Vert is one heck of tasty quaff. Props to Green Flash for doing Belgian beer right."
""

"O: I know I talked a lot about italian food in my review, but this beer tastes so much like a pizza or pasta. I wish it was toned down a little bit in the taste, but everything else in the beer is very awesome. Maybe I will age the other ones and see what this beer does with time."
""
"Overall, not bad, but room for improvement. It has bonus points for the aroma."
"This is probably the best BPA I've had. Pure winner from Green Flash. Try this stuff!"

"Overall: A very nice Brett Pale Ale. Certainly better than Treasure Chest. It lacks some of the harshness and astringency of the aforementioned beer (though those notes have mostly faded in Treasure Cheat). A great addition to the brewery's year round portfolio."
"I drank this by itself, but would love to experiment with food pairings. Can see this being a very versatile food beer. I have thoughts of steamed mussels, hard cheeses, and much more."
"This is a good brett beer but it is too straightforward. Nice for a brett kick but little else. This is far from Orval, make no mistake about that."
"This is a very nice brew. Pretty unique, and is reminiscent of Orval, as others have said."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with about an inch and a half off-white head that stays around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like citrusy hops (lemon peel, tropical fruit), peppery spice, pears and some bretty funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy hops (apricots, orange peel, tropical fruit), peppery spice, bready malt and a bit of brett. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy and well carbonated. I think it's a good beer. I'll have to try and save a bottle for a while to see how it changes (or evolves as stated on the label), but that's going to be hard to do! The 4-pack was $10.99."
""
"Slghtly hazed copper orange body with a bright white head forming thick and billowing above the rim of my chalice. Fine speckled lacing left behind in the glass. Aroma has a bright lemon/citrus nose with some wild barnyard floral notes as well, amplified compared to some other Belgian pale ales. The brett is really kicking in this beer, especially in the flavor with a bitter layer of earthiness, perfume, lemon zest, horse blanket, barnyard funk. Really unrlenting with the brett, either you dig this or you don't but this is heavy on it. Usually brett flavors tend to develop with age this one seems to have had some time in the bottle already to develop those wild yeast flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit rough with some moderate bitterness, noticeable alcohol, and unrelenting brettanomyces guided phenolics. Carbonation is effervescent much like an Orval with a medium body they really nailed the texture of the mother of all BPAs. Overall this beer lacks the finesse and diversity that Orval has but makes up for in true American style, with aggressive citric hops and noticeable alcohol flavors. Decent but I'm not sold on all of this brett."
""
"It's nice to see 4-pack bottles of this everywhere. This is the kind of brew you'd look for in a special release, but Green Flash graced is with wide availability. I'm sure I'll have many more of these in my beer-drinking career."
"Edit: New rendition is sickly overcarbonated as of Spring 2013. Brett is more evident in nose and taste however. Bottom line; if it weren't for these robust bottles this would likely explode in distribution. 4.0 to 2.0 on appearance/overall. Seek this one on tap in the meantime, rare as it may be."
"An interesting and complex beer, but a little too brett-dominated for me. I was hoping it would be more balanced, and was disappointed that the juicy fruit in the nose wasn't more prominent in the taste. Still good though. If you love brett you'll be more in to it than me."
"Overall, I find this to be quite good and anybody who loves Orval should check this out."
