"I'm mystified by the high rating for this beer compared to my experience. I'll look for it again as perhaps I got a bad bottle."
"American Trappist... all-right, I'll bite. Poured a clear, golden amber into my tulip. 2 fingers of fluffy white head and great carbonation. Spicy, Belgian yeast notes on the aromas, with some nice dark fruit and even citrus notes shining through. Classic flavors of a Belgian pale from my admittedly limited experiences. Reminded me a bit of GI Sofie. The nice citrus notes and peppery bite on the finish had me anxiously taking the next sip. Nice clean finish with some of the lingering yeast notes fading away. A nice buy. US monks, supporting charity, delicious= multi-level winner."

"Very nice ale, great flavor and aroma.  The Trappist label brings with it an expectation of quality.  While I'm not sure I would ever choose this beer over any of the other Trappists I've had up to this point, I can say that I think it earns its place next to them and does the label justice.  Definitely worth a try."
"I look forward to cellaring a few bottles...this stuff ought to age well."

"A very fine beer. At more than $5 a bottle, this is a beer for a special occasion."

"This is exactly what I am looking for when I go for these golden trappist ales light and delicious"

"Notes: I like what this beer is trying to do. Perhaps the monks at Spencer could produce one or two more offerings. I imagine that these guys are quite capable of hitting the bulls eye. Perhaps they should try a dubbel, or quad.... or (since this is an American monastery... the first Trappist IPA!!!)"

"Unfiltered with a cloudy golden amber appearance. The aroma is beer with some flowery hops. Taste is disappointing for a Belgian Trappist Ale. If this was an American Pale Ale expectations would be lower, but every other Trappist ale has been perfectly balanced with no bitterness on the finish. Considering it is a American brewed beer, the hoppiness and higher ABV is not surprising.  As a final insult, the bottle was only 11.2 ounces and cost $6. This is acceptable for an imported beer, but give me a break, it is brewed in Massachusetts, why not 12 ounces?"
""
"Not bad, but doesn't do a whole lot to stand out, really."

"Serving type: bottle"

"It is easy to focus a little too much on Belgiums and grow tired of the yeast. At least that's what I have done, unfortunately. This beer may pave my way back in. Different and very good."
"This patersbier exceeded my expectations. For a relatively light style, it packs some fruity, yeasty goodness with a nice bit of clove. A little pricey at 20/4pk, but it's worth picking up."
""
"Breads aroma, highly carbonated.  Good stuff."
"Decent initial head, very loose and wispy, settles down to a loosely arrayed islands of bubbles, tannish hue with an orange tint, for lacing you get minimal splotches with not too much stick. Very cloudy, bottle stood up for days and carefully poured still yields a great deal of particulate in the liquid, warm red glow at the core but mostly a bright orange, color of pink grapefruit pulp, nothing remarkable about the visible carbonation. The nose offers biscuit crumbs, pepper, meadow grasses and earth, clove spice, the orange to lemon citrus pierces the nostrils well and allows for more flow in the attenuated apricot, apple fruit, definitely more lingering banana notes. Full-bodied, in large part due to the fluffy expansion coming from the carbonation. Lees, whipped cream, clove and caraway seed, dried honey, less peppery here. The citrus is indistinct in terms of flavors but a large presence nonetheless. Overall, the profile is too dry for you to get a lot of banana or bubblegum but they are there. Apricot, pear, green melon fruit of moderate ambition. The finish is tactful even as that active carbonation extends the mouth feel. Pleasant to sip."
"Pours slightly cloudy with a generous head.  Decent nose,taste and feel."

"Sweet undertones and a strong banana smell. A good after dinner beer."

"Bottle of spencer ale drank,"

"Overall, this is pretty tasty.  Would love to drink regularly."

"Overall / Drinkability:   A solid Belgian pale ale, and in a way, an American take on the Trappist ale.  Easily drinkable and I would have had another one if I had not been distracted by other goodies on the La Trappe beer menu.  Went well with food (mixed green salad) and I'll have to see if I can find it again."
"Flavors are lightly bitter; fresh baked high quality sour dough bread comes to mind.  I really need to do a head to head with this and Orval. It would make for a happy trouble. Everything is very well balanced. While I appreciate that this is the only beer this brewery/monastery produces I would be excited to see them putting out more offerings."

"Straightforward Am Belg, crazy head"
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, vibrant, orange-gold coloring with a frothy, filmy, sparse, white surface coating of head. Aromas of banana, clove, cream, and toasted grains. Pretty simple, but impressively balanced. The flavors are roasted and rich forward, with banana bread notes, heavy clove spicing, some nutmeg notes, a sweet and tangy cream overlay, and a toasted grain backbone. Subtle yeast funk throughout, with some fruity esters, too. The body is light and dry, and remains crisp throughout due to the carbonation. Banana and spice blend in the aftertaste, with a short-lived linger, kept clean by the carbonation once again, providing a crisp, clean finish. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Was a serious effort to get a hold of this gem where I live, but man am I glad I went to the effort (and expense).  Easily one of my top 3 Trappist ales."
""
""
"From the 11.2 oz bottle purchased at Coit Liquors in San Francisco. Massive little bottles that ought to be refilled."
""
""
""
""
"Solid as hell. It's infinity drinkable."
""
""
"not digging this one, good attempt"
""
""

"Amazing. Just as good as any other Belgian I have had. Really a tremendous beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks amazing. Smells fruity. Tastes wonderful. Feels good. Overall authentic tasting Trappist ale."
"A real interesting Belgian pale ale here, really lively too on palate feel.  Not mind blowing but certainly delicious and worthy for another go!"
"12 oz bottle foamed vigorously when uncapped although rapidly subsided when poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass. Two finger head resolved itself within one minute to a splotchy film. Appetizing rich-amber color and haze look great on the table and in the hand. Nose is predominantly hay and pepper, not in a bad way. Taste is correct for the style, with just a whisper of funk on the finish. Excellent balance. Feels a bit light, almost weightless on the tongue, again not a bad thing. Overall, a downright excellent beer regardless of its provenance. Thoroughly enjoyed on this and past occasions. I'd love to try it on tap sometime."
""
""
"Disappointing. Weak for a trappist."
"O: I was simultaneously skeptical and excited about this beer. Even though I was ready to be bitterly harsh -- the skunk-esque nose didn't help -- I can't be. It's good. Damned good. Highly recommended, and I will be drinking again."
"I would and I will have this beer again. I enjoyed it very much and I like that it has a profile that can be paired with food, or just enjoyed by itself. This is a great Trappist Ale and anyone who wants to venture from say, pilsner's or IPA's and into the world of true yeast character would definitely enjoy trying this beer."
"Spicy banana aroma follows into the front with a short lived bitterness at the end. Pretty good, but I was expecting something special and this one just didn't quite deliver."
""
""
""
""
"the same rare taste like zundert trappist ale"
""
""
"O: Been waiting for a couple of years to get the chance to try this one... A very nice example of a Belgian Pale Ale and pretty cool that it coming from an American monastery. Enjoyable flavor that is pretty easy to drink with a well hidden alcohol."
""
"Not necessarily my style. Seems well made and put together though."
""
"Glowing orange color with a lovely large white head that fades rather quickly too a 1/4"" foam top. Aroma is soapy flowers, banana, coriander, lemon candy in the background... All the elements nicely working together. Taste is sweet, peppery spice, floral, zesty, bready grains, slightly tart, and creamy and fluffy in texture. Good stuff. I'm excited about the first US Trappist brewery!"
"Neat story.  Worth the try.  Def not a road soda..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden orange.  Drinking from a tulip glass at home, from a store-purchased bottle that is months old.  Straight from the refrigerator to the glass.   Some sediment is apparent.  Banana and clove aromas accented by a slightly yeasty and floral bouquet.  Malty flavors with essences of cloves and banana.  Highly carbonated.  Light mouth-feel, slightly bitter.  Fairly high alcohol but not boozy in taste.   Clean and refreshing taste.  Does not linger on the palate.  I know it represents a classic Trappist style but I'm not a fan.  Too bad because the monastery is close to me and the release was a big deal around here."
""
""
"On the front of the palate it is very sweet but the aftertaste has a bit too much yeast."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden orange hued body beneath a towering head of airy eggshell froth.  Bright aromas of Belgian yeast, doughiness, and subtle pale malts.  Dried banana, flowers, nuts, cracked pepper, earthy husk, and clove.  Flavor is equally delicate with fruity, spicy yeast, lemon, toast, earthy grass, and moderate phenolics.  Very fluffy in the mouth and pleasantly dry.  A nice, spicy, easy-drinking Belgian Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy dark golden pour with big off white head. Yeasty, orange, funk aroma. Citrus strong slightly dank. Some spicy notes, earthy hop flavors. Great, authentic tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice golden color with a nice white head. Aroma and taste had nice belgian yeast character with orange, banana, little clove, little candy sugar and a slight funk. Easy drinking and enjoyable, but the price makes a little tough to make this much of a regular."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: getting this brew by pure luck was nothing but joy for me. Cracking it open was the first step to a great brew. This is a traditional Trappist ale to the fullest. Delicious, complex, and full flavored. Everything I've pretty much wanted In a Belgian ale. Like a mix of wild yeast and traditional. I would totally try again (I received two bottles) and would totally recommend to a friend (if I'm willing to share). Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall: I'm a fan of this beer, can scratch the belgian itch without copious amounts of refined sugar or adjuncts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lucky to have grown up next to the St Joseph Abbey as a kid. Started off eating the Jelly and now I bring home as many as these as I can when I visit central Mass. It is a very nice beer with a lil bit of smokey love on the back end."
""
""
""
"O: I would drink this as fresh as you can find it... it's pretty easy to tell that this is one of those bottle-conditioned beers that dries out too much, losing sweet balance... nice to see an American monastery venture into brewing, however, this beer doesn't stand out much (maybe if they used De Dolle's yeast :)...)... make a darker beer, then get back to me"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good example of the style. This beer would not be out of place among its native Belgian counterparts. Here's hoping that the brothers at Saint Joseph's have started a strong Trappist brewing tradition here in the USA."
""
"This is a very solid, if unspectacular brew. The price will undoubtedly lead to hesitation (paid $18 for a 4-pack in NJ), but if it helps the Brothers succeed and expand their lineup, then it's worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Be careful when pouring the beer the carbonation is very aggressive in its initial foaming. I'm really grateful for the opportunity to try this beer. The monks did a very good job and it's great to see America's first Trappist brewery has the ability to succeed and thrive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer foamed when I opened the bottle.  I had quite a mess.  I poured the remaining beer into a chalice.  I like the amber color.  I like the smell, some bready notes, some spice, and some citrus.  The taste is good too.  Spice, orange citrus, bread.  The beer is easy drinking, there's no cloying flavors and it is a bit dry.  I'd rate the beer higher, but I was unimpressed with the beer foaming all over my counter when I opened the bottle."
""
""
""
"Its carbonation reminds me of seltzer, have to remember to pour it out of the bottle though. Back story is cool"
"Golden yellow, nice two finger frothy head, very nice lacing and retention. Aroma was top-notch, with cloves, banana, bready yeast and some wonderful Belgian funk. The flavor was outstanding, with some cloves, a bit of citrus taste and those wonderful yeasty notes. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, somewhat dry, nice carbonation. Overall, the monks at Spencer Abbey's prayers were answered- and likewise mine! To be able to brew one of only a handful of Trappist brews on the planet is quite an accomplishment!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"God heard the monks' prayer and delivered a heavenly brew - you can't tell this is from Massachusetts instead of Belgium."
""
""
""
"Pours a one finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving traces of lace. Hazy pale amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied.  Belgian yeast nose and flavor is yeast, cloves and bready. $2.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"Fantastic! What a great beer. Expensive but well worth it. With a light wheat-y base and notes of darker fruit in the background, this beer is awesome. I would highly recommend it and as a citizen of Massachusetts I am so proud this comes from my state. Hunt this down and try it, outstanding."

"11.2 oz bottle.  Pours hazy-orange with long lasting, foamy, white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of funky yeast, pale malt, and ripe fruit.  Body is full and crisp.  Funky, spicy yeast, bready malt, floral hops and ripe fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long, semidry and spicy.  Very nice brew, more hoppy than other Trappists IMO."

"I don't know too much about Belgian Pales but this is definitely one of the better ones Ive had. Has a ton of that spiciness you'd expect and Is very fizzy and dry. Taste a little orange and banana and some other fruit notes. Very enjoyable and very glad that America now has a Trappist offering!"

"Best Belgian from Massachusetts. The appearance was a nice hazy dark yellow, although the head was very fizzy. The smell was full of Belgian wheat giving the smell of bananas and herbs like sage. The taste was full of mint, sage, and banana giving a classic Belgian ale flavor that was very well done. The mouthfeel was also very nice with a medium body which worked with the flavors very well. Really enjoyed this one."

"During a trip from my native Philadelphia to Spencer, I had the opportunity to try Spencer Trappist Ale on tap at the Black and White Restaurant near Saint Joseph's Abbey. The experience was a rare treat. I was overwhelmed by the light yeasty aroma . I thought I could smell a light citrus or almost clove smell. A beautiful amber, cloudy color.The taste was superb- dry, and better than any other Belgian I've tried. I found my way to a local Spirits shop where I bought two cases to take home. This my friends, will be an ale that will be around for the ages."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - If not for the price, I'd say a great start for a new brewery. But at $5 for an 11.2oz bottle, why would I buy this again? Price is certainly a factor in my review; especially given it's only a bit less than Orval and a bunch more than Duvel. I'll try it again sometime down the road but I'm not in a rush to do that."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A flavorful example of a Belgian pale. The beer hits most of the notes I expect in the style. I have had better in the style, but this is certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
"This is a very nice Belgian ale, in the traditional style, that is in a class of its own. If you have had many of the trappist brews, many things about this one will seem quite familiar."
""
"Oh and nice website too."

""
""

"Feels appropriate for the favors, but there's a lot of carbonation that froths up in the mouth -- distractingly so. I'm a little picky about this one, but it really is lovely. Shocking to think it's from the states."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- It's a great beer. How they get that much flavor from a 6.5% ABV, I'm not sure. Brought over to a cookout by a good friend, it was nice to share. Not sure of pricing or availability out east, I'd probably pick up a bottle given the opportunity."
""
""
""

"o: Kind of pricey, but this is pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- enjoyable complex American Belgian Trappist"
""
""
""
"Slightly hazy orange colour with a fluffy beige cap. Good head retention, some lacing, looks nice. A lot of character from the yeast. Aromas of cloves and a bit of spiciness, fruity esters and bready malt, hint of citrus. Low bitterness with slightly sugary, fruity sweetness coupled with clove and spice throughout. Maybe a bit of toffee in the finish. Airy texture, lots of carbonation with medium/light body, good texture. A solid offering and one that I enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is hazed deep golden amber with a tight white head. Nose is Belgian yeast up front with a touch of spice and strong clove, candied sugar, and banana. Smells sweet. Taste is sweet but has a decent grain bill and notes of spicy Belgian yeast. Some clove, candied sugar is strong. Definitely sugary and a hint sweet. Lighter body with moderate carb."

"O- This was very good for the style and I'm glad to see Spencer making quality beers like this right out of the gate. However this didn't quite compare to the Westvletern Blond which had very similar flavors but a slightly better beer all around. If you like Belgian blondes this is without a doubt seeking out and probably one of the better interpretations out there."
"O- A well done belgian style pale IMO."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a translucent burnt orange with a rocky, four finger, bright white head with the consistency of frothy dish soap. Fluffy spots of lacing are revealed as the brew recedes. Nose is bright an light with a kiss of clove, banana esters and a light malt profile. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavors come off a bit dull and subdued. Finish is a bit grainy and I get a hint of wet cardboard. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively, bright carbonation that leaves a residual prickly across the roof of the mouth. Overall, a decent golden, but definitely does not warrant the price point for what it is."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice hazy orange-gold body, white foam that has some legs but the retention is average, especially when compared to others of the style. Candi spice in the flavor but minimal, very fruit forward with tangerines being prominent. Airy feel with some banana notes in the aroma. Quite good but doesn't quite reach to Chimay or Rochefort IMO."

"I very much enjoyed this beer I will have it again and it reminds me of what a fresh Trappist ale in Belgium must taste like"
""
""
""
""
""
"Why is it that a monastery can just up and pop out a trappist beer and hit the nail on the head while many other fine brewpubs have been serving up meh trappist style beers for years?"
"O: I made the mistake of sharing this between two glasses. Approximately 8-9 oz. in the first glass and the remainder in a second glass. The pours between the two were drastically different. The first glass was not cloudy in appearance and the second was translucent. The taste and smell were completely different between the two. After I combined the glasses, I was presented with a great beer. I think the goods settled to the bottom."
""
""
""
""
""
"I will be buying this often and can't wait to try their other offerings in approx. 5 years"
""
""
""
"11.2 oz bottle: This one pours a cloudy golden color. There was a bit of a frothy white head on it that leaves some lacing. The nose is good. Yeasty, spicy, peppery, faint wheat. Maybe faint citrus and banana. The taste is very good. Spicy, coriander, yeast, banana, wheat, slightly dry, faint bitterness. A lot going on here. This is really a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A very nice Belgian-style pale. While it may not hold up to the best of the old-world examples, I must admit I enjoyed the novelty of drinking the first ever American trappist ale, and it's certainly not a bad beer."

""
""
""
""

"This is my first Trappist Ale, and I have to say I will definitely be trying more. I first heard about this beer from a friend, so on a recent trip to Massachussetts I picked up a four pack from a store and tried it. I did not have the preferred glass, so I poured it into a pint glass which was, of course, a little big. The smell was pleasant but not perfect with a quite malty aroma, but what really hit me was how smooth yet robust the mouth feel was. It was a real pleasure to taste, and I found myself lingering on each sip before swallowing, trying to catch all the flavors, as there were quite a few I hadn't tasted in a beer before. Something in it reminded me of the peaty flavors of an Islay Scotch. In any case, a quite enjoyable beer, even for someone like me who's generally leans more towards the more hoppy varieties."
"Fairly clear light golden color with a decent off white head. Aromas of yeast, bread, lightly sweet sugar, clove and pepper with hints of light fruit. The flavor follows the aroma, lightly sweet fruit and honey like malty sweetness offset with some spice and pepper. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet light syrupy mouthfeel. I liked this beer, I’m glad I got to try it. The price point is horrible, I would never buy this for myself, I’m glad someone else shared this with me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is golden orange and mildly hazy with a quarter inch of off white head. The aroma offers Belgian style yeast, clove, fruity tones, bread. Nice tasting beer. Medium bodied. A tad sweet with light spice undertones. Some similarities to a witbier in that regard. I rather enjoyed this one and hope to revisit at some point."
"Really enjoyable"

""
"Overall - Well made, but nothing special."
"Had heard differing opinions about this one but I find it to be a pleasant experience overall. The yeast is quite flavorful but not overpowering and brings a great array of flavors."
"My understanding is that the monastery has agreed to brew only this particular beer for 5 years before they branch out. I am marking my calendar because I truly look forward to the day when I can taste a dubbel, tripel or quad from Spencer Brewery."

"Overall: The monks at Spencer know what they're doing! This is a solid first offering from their brewery, and I look forward to trying more down the road!"
""
""
"O: Thanks for the honor, Dave. Fantastic Belgian PA!"
""
"It is a pretty good beer overall. It is worth trying, but this beer comes with a fairly high price point which hinders my desire to buy more. In the bang-for-your-buck department a similar beer can be purchased for less money."

"I really enjoyed this, but I hope the price comes down so that I might enjoy it more often. Still, I'm always happy to help out the Trappists."

"With scent and taste the best thing is to leave you on your own. It is not weak nor is it strong. It is not light but it is not boozy and the 6.5% slides in without a ruffle of a feather. You'll likely find some of the things mentioned here, such as banana, coriander, clove, nutmeg and so forth. But you'll also find things not mentioned here that are just your own. And you'll find different things from sip to sip. This beer is not a bludgeon, like so many at this price level; and if you don't pay some mind, you might mistake it as too easy going for the expense paid. But given time and proper contemplation, if you'll forgive that choice of word, you'll be rewarded with a multitude of subtler pleasures. A brew that grows on you when approached with kindness."
""
"An interesting blend of pale malt, strong Belgian yeast and coriander. Classic Trappist flavors but this one is quite thin with an overly elevated carbonation level, almost like champagne. The finish is sour, yeasty remnant which dissipates quickly."
"Nice fruity finish, some hint of nutmeg lingering?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Fantastic, just fantastic. This is a highly underrated gem that even Allagash would be proud of."
""
"This experience has left me to contemplate leaving all my worldly possessions behind and join the monks in Spencer... Do you get free ale for living the simple life?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was eager to try the first American Trappist ale and it did not disappoint! As far as I'm concerned, this is a textbook example of a good...no, great...Trappist ale. Fresh tasting, clean, fruity with a bit of spice. Even the carbonation reminded me of little angels flying up to heaven. Too poetic? Perhaps, but this beer deserves a little poetry. Amazing offering!"
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this, and I really hope the price comes down. I stumbled across this at a local restaurant and ordered it immediately. Great choice."
"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Living in Massachusetts I had been anxiously awaiting the release of America's first Trappist offering and it was well worth the wait. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with this; I think I was expecting an abbey ale with deep red color and fig or plum flavor...I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. This is truly a unique beer that was crafted with care. The intense banana aroma and flavor are a testament to the particular yeast strain that they so graciously gift to us in the bottle. Will definitely buy again."
"Summary: Compared to the other authentic Trappist beers I've tried, this has a more subdued flavor - it is not as rich or strong as say a Rochefort or the Gregorius, but that's probably because it is not a Tripel, Quad or Strong Ale. This beer fits my stereotype of a Belgian ale, although certainly better than most I have tasted. An immediate comparison to an Allagash White comes to mind, but again, this is much better. It has a sweetness to its taste with a smell of cloves and banana? (I really don't know what cloves smell like.) It is not a strong smell, but definitely fruity I guess. The carbonation is the strongest of any Trappist beer I have imbibed (that word courtesy of my more intelligent wife). It has a great finish and leaves a very nice lingering flavor, albeit a bit dry. Overall, considering it's alcohol strength, it is great for what it is. However, for what it is, the price of a 4-pack is steep. I do hope the Spencer Brewery comes out with other brews as it would be interesting to see them take on stronger styles."
"Spencer Trappist Ale is a well-crafted rendition of a Belgian pale ale that had many similar characteristics to a stronger Belgian ale. Although I really enjoyed this, at $18 a four-pack I doubt I will be drinking it very often."
"Pours a short foamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. Golden orange in color with light carbonation. Smell is instantly recognizable as Trappist with a lot of pepper, clove and rock candy. Taste is surprisingly mellow compared to what the nose indicates. Light and fluffy with a just touch of pepper and clove. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. The body doesn't stick around long. Overall very enjoyable. This would be a terrific ale to sip on the porch on a warm summer night. However, the price point makes it a bit more of an occasional indulgence."

"This is my third bottle. Good, not great. Seems to me like it wants to be a little of several things. I would not turn one down but nothing really makes me want to go out of my way to have another. I'm saving the last one for a hot summer day. Maybe some time to develop will change my view, hopefully for the better."

"From the first batch - semi rough poor kicked up a one finger head that dissapated shortly after being poured, left minimal lacing. Odd aroma of dryer sheets and dirt with a bready maltiness. Flavor falls short due to typical (for US brewers of Belgian styles) overly phenolic flavor with no nuance. Tastes more like a hefeweizen than belgian single. Made me feel good, so there's that at least. Value is out of whack."
""
"O: Not a bad brew. Nothing earth shattering but this IS just a 6.5% BPA. It's fairly simple but balanced and refreshing. Lightly hopped, crisp citrus, pretty standard. Nice and fresh, which is nice considering the brewery/monastery is a whole hour from me. Quite authentic for a US-based belgian-style beer."

"Nice copper, golden color with soft, white head that dissipates quicker than I would wish. Smell of faint banana, some clove, yeast, bread. Taste is very nice. Clean maltiness, bananas, clove, bread, Belgian yeast. Very nicely balanced. Very soft and smooth, making it extremely drinkable. Not extremely complex but tasty and enjoyable. The dry aftertaste made me want to keep taking sips. A great example of the style. Brought me back to Belgium for sure!"

"Overall this is decent and I am happy to have tried it. That being said, I wished it was a bit more unique tasting."

"Good beer. Aroma is great and was hoping for a stronger flavor presence. It's gentle, mild and subtle."

"Cheers!"

"Overall: quite well done and a refreshing beer for dinnertime. Spicy, fruity, slightly bitter- perfect mealtime beer. Visit their web site for more details on the beer. http://www.spencerbrewery.com/beer/"
"The taste evolves from a toasted biscuit character to the ""meaty"" fruit character of apples and pear and the clove creeps on the back end to top it all. Very nicely done and reflects well on the original Trappist Ales from Europe."

"O/D-Pretty cool. You definitely pay for the Trappist moniker. Hey, long live the Masshole Trappists!"
"Golden Honey color. Light head and slight lacing. Heavy banana nose and taste. Fruit notes with a touch of spice. The mouthfeel gives you heavy carbonation up front with velvet finish. Pleasant aftertaste with an almost caramel finish. Split a bottle with ThreeLions."
"Overall very happy with this selection. Can't wait to enjoy the last 3 bottles."

"The beer pours a white and bubbly head that dissipates very slowly. The beer itself is a golden brown that resembles a dark honey. The beer is fairly clear with a bit of haze in it. The smell has strong bitter hop notes along with citrus fruits such lemon and orange zest. The bready yeast smell also has a presence with a bit of sweetness mixing with the citrus. The taste is slightly different from the smell. The taste a stronger bitter hop presence and the citrus flavors are not as pronounced. The taste also has that bready yeast taste. Medium bodied on the heavier side but goes down fairly smooth. Biting carbonation.Overall, a pretty good beer and worth getting."

"This poured a nice darker golden color with a small head and lasting lacing. Nice fruity smell was encouraging. The taste was very clean, with nice balance of yeast and hops - what stuck out was the carbonation. This seemed different than my recollection of the Belgians. Each taste though is so good - can't believe these guys just got started. I am already starting my plan to do a tour there - I heard they haven't planned on doing tours yet, so may result in a late night kicking in the door. No matter what, nice job. $20 for a 4 pack is a little on the high side, but it is worth it."

"o: I have seen this compared to Duvel, but I found it superior in flavor and body. Really nice to see something of this quality produced an hour away from me too. I will be more than happy to support it with more purchases in the future."

"O: Overall a great Trappist ale. I put another four pack in the basement to see if the flavors change or develop at all by summer."
"The beer pours a deep orange with amber highlights, like a morning sunrise. A head of gently-off-white bubbles forms above the beer, settling around a quarter of a finger’s width above the glass, and then quickly fizzling away to just a scrim. The bubbles leave a mildly thick lacing that draws its fingers up the sides of my glass, but I wish they would stick around a little longer. In body, the beer is opaque and hazy, with little to nothing coming through from the other side of the glass. There are, however, no visible particles floating around within the beer. On the nose, the beer is distinctly of Trappist origins, with the potential to also be considered a hefeweizen… Big fruity esters and phenols lather the nose in thick banana scents, like a banana smoothie; hints of pineapple can also be sensed, and touches of spicy clove and other phenols can be felt in the nostrils. Subtle bread scents do dance as ghosts in the background of the nose, but really this beer is all about the fruity esters and spicy phenols of the yeast. There does seem to be a touch of spicy booze as well, which may just be me mistaking the esters for booze, but if not then it is a little odd for the ABV. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and fruity with funky esters and spicy phenols, the middle and finish bring in a nice balancing spicy bitterness that mellows into herbal hops that are just a touch strong. Acidity also pops the mouth in the beginnings of the sip, leaving a light pucker in the lips. In flavor, the beer is again all about its yeast character. Spicy banana and pineapple smoothie molds into rich phenol clove, spice, and perhaps just a touch of Band-Aid. The finish brings out more herbal spices, mingling with herbal and grassy hops to give the beer a nice balance, though it still remains a touch too sweet, making the bitterness and spice a little harsh. The finish is a little quick for what I want it to be, but does leave a nice aftertaste of pineapple and banana esters. In the mouth, the beer feels rather odd. In body it is somewhere in the medium range, with a touch of watery thinness at its close, but in mouthfeel, the beer is thick and creamy with a touch of chewiness as well. There is a tug on the sides of the cheeks as the beer passes through the mouth, giving the beer a light grip, and the acidity certainly bites at the tongue, even after the beer has left, leaving the cheeks wet with spittle and the tongue slightly numb with spice and bitters. The mouthfeel still needs a little work in my humble opinion. Overall, I am intrigued and impressed. It is no easy task to simply step into the venerable ranks of the Trappist Breweries. Some of the highest rated beers in the world come from these breweries, but I believe Spencer has built a strong foundation to quickly catch up to its European brethren. They need to work on the head retention of the beer, for starters, and the mouthfeel and is bit off, which hurts the beers drinkability, though it does make it ideal for pairing with food. I also would like less harsh spice/bitters from the yeast and hops, and a little more of a blending of the sweet, spicy, and bitter characteristics. I wouldn’t really call this a table beer, either, as its ABV and overall body are a bit much, but it would certainly do well on a table. This beer is excellent, however, and I am just nitpicking because it is joining such an elite class of breweries. This is a fine start for the monks in Spencer, MA!"

"O: I have been waiting for this beer for a long time, and I am pleased to report that it is every bit as good as I had hoped it would be. This is the first authentic Trappist beer made in America, and its simplicity and understated complexity perfectly reflect the context in which it was brewed. The beer just exudes a sense of peace and tranquility. This is the perfect companion to a simple cheese plate. A nice tame Brie with apple or pear slices drizzled with honey and a slice of crusty bread. Sometimes it's the simple things in life that are the most rewarding."

"Grabbed a four pack at the package store on it's first day of release, I'm hoping the monks will have it for sale in their gift shop next to the jellies soon. A high quality Belgian blonde, it pours with a nice head and a big scent of bananas. A little too much carbonation, but the malts and spices are blended perfectly. This ale is Christmas in a bottle, serve it with fish or chicken and enjoy."
""
"Overall pretty good, nothing too crazy or amazing, but for a blonde ale pretty nice. Like I mentioned before I have been waiting a very long time for this, and it's finally here, and is able to remind me of being in Belgium, so a nice beer at that. very drinkable, a bit too wheaty, but still tasty, everything well balanced, a nice spring or summer beer for sure. I hope they bring a quad or big beer at some point."
"O: Overall, this comes off as a well-constructed (but poor tasting IMO) example of a beer in a genre which is, admittedly, not my favorite. The appearance and mouthfeel were plus, but taste was not enjoyable. Even though I didn't like it, I was happy to help out the 'locals' by making this purchase."
""
"O: Overall, delicious and easy to drink, very enjoyable."

"An easy drinking and Wildly refreshing Trappist ale that has the character and complexities in both aroma and taste, to stand up with it's sister beers from overseas. American Trappist works for me. Look forward to seeking this one out when it's in retail."
"Got to try this early. It poured the color of hay with a nice, clean white head. The aroma and taste were what you would expect from a tripel: banana, clove, and yeast. It was more highly carbonated than I was expecting, quite prickly on the tongue. It was easy drinking and quite refreshing. I look forward to drinking it again when it gets released in just over a week. Don't know how much buzz there is about the first American Trappist beer but the monks at St. Joseph's have produced a swell little beer here."
