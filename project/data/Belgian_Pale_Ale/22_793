It pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly off-cream foam.  The nose comprises light Band-Aid, Belgian yeast, a twinge of dry maple syrup, and light biscuit.  The taste brings in more of the same, with some light orange zest and a richer, less phenolic smoke (though it's still pretty mild in the grand scheme of this glass's things).  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a solid, lightly-smoked BPA.  Good times as usual from Unibroue.","TMoney2591","Jan 06, 2015"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Well this one was pretty much nothing like advertised on its label. It's rather light, refreshing and quaffable. Not really full bodied per say and hardly leaves an aftertaste. More importantly if you pick this up because you expect a smokey or whiskey like flavor you will be sorely disappointed as I don't detect those flavors at all. It tastes like a Belgian pale ale. Got a bit of that yeasty funk, floral and spicy notes like coriander or clove. Banana, bubblegum. It's session able and would make a great summertime brew. Picked this up in the bargain bin for $3 and its still in date and all. Nothing extrodinary but just drinkable, refreshing, and has a decent amount of flavor without being extremely complex. For what it is its quite good. I give it about the same rating it currently has going for it...87","LovingCup","Jan 03, 2015"

Pours lightly hazy deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of apricot, peach, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5.5%. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian pale ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 18, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and very subtle smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, earth, fruit, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Palate is quite similar, with sweet corn and caramel flavors, a tinge of smoke but no scotch ale in this regard, dry husks, pears and apples, maybe a touch of banana. Vanilla and some coriander or other mild citrus spice. All in all a fairly unique Belgian pale with Unibroue character. One of the more difficult Unibroues to track down, at least in these parts. Perhaps a bit undercarbonated. Finish is persistent, sweet and mildly acidic. Worthwhile and I am tempted to provide higher ratings.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 25, 2013"

Smell was a bit sugary and earthy. Taste was good, as I enjoyed the balance between the sweet malt and the tart Belgian yeast. The one thing that let me down was the real absence of the smoked character that I was looking for. The beer promises smoked malt, but it's not upfront. Instead, it's hidden way back in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was smooth and easy to drink. Raftman was a great Belgian style pale ale, but I thought it let me down on the smoked aspect.

4.5,16.6,4,4,5,4,4.5,"A dusky hazed golden orange with a quickly fading white head. Nice lacing as I consume. Smell is super. A melange of light bananas, apricots, pepper, some soap, Belgian yeast, light toasted grains, smoke and earth. Taste follws suit with a lightly soapy front that flashes the fruits and spicy pepper on its way to a dry grainy malt core. It lingers forever with large amounts of toasted whole grains, a light dry sweetness and hint of lemon. More dry than bitter the hops are earthy and mild. Finish is long and complex with notes of cinnamon coming through as weel as more toasted malt, light smoke and earth. Feel is light, dry, and quenching. Mild prickliness is spot on for this beer. A real winner here. I would dare say Unibroue's equivalent to Orval. Dry and super complex, it goes down like a thirst quencher but demands to be savored and appreciated. Great beer. Too bad it is not availible in any quantities here or I would be stocking up.","scootny","Jun 14, 2011"

4.03,4.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass is this lovely beer from our friends at Unibroue. This beer boasts a beautiful honey colour and a luscious inch of spring fed, long lasting head. A good quarter inch of fluff sustains itself through the entirety of the drinking session. The nose is distinctly house Unibroue with Belgian yeasty undertones and a sweet, somewhat spicy aroma on top. Smells wild and inviting. The taste is fresh and light with spiced caramel apple skin and chalky yeast tones and some crusty breadiness. The use of whiskey malt does not show up as an overtly conspicuous component nor does it create a definite uniqueness beyond the other equally great Unibroue offerings. If it weren't noted upon the bottle, this ingredient would likely not be identified by most palates. ""Whiskey flavour"" is generally a product of whiskey barrels, and this brew is bottle fermented not barrel aged in whiskey casks. You can imagine it if you like. At any rate, this brew has a great flavour. The mouthfeel ranges in around medium with the ample carbonation lending itself to a great consistency. The drinkability is good as this brew flows smoothly and is without any offensive or overpowing elements in the flavour profile. As well, the alcohol content is within a moderate range that would allow for extended samplings without threat of inebriation. Well crafted.","SupaCelt","Jan 20, 2011"

Made with whisky malt, this amber ale takes on the smoky fragrance and a hint of flavor of a nice highland Scotch trending to tart green apple and grass notes as it warms. That this beer is so crisp and lively on the tongue owes to the Belgian styles that Quebec's Unibroue is known for, a deadly combination if there ever was one.

It looks a little murky as I look through the glass. It has the nose of a traditional Belgian Abbey dubbel. Light and smooth with a hint of candi sugar. Faint malt, and complex yeasty smells. I smell sweet apples, grain husk, and a little acidity or tartness. It's a little dry smelling. The taste is very mellow and smooth. It doesn't have that citrus punch that most of Unibroue's beers have. Instead it has a sessionable ABV and a more subtle and tame style. The mouthfeel is very thick for the ABV because of the body being so full. The aftertaste shows a little bit of neutral hops that add an attempt at balance, but don't quite get there. This is definitely a predominantly malty beer, but doesn't wear on you like an english brown ale can with the sugary-sweet aftertaste some tend to have.

In a pure vacuum, almost all of their beers are solid, but because they brew in a fairly rigid style, the brews all compete with each other. Raftman is a nice light offering. I think they are overplaying the use of whisky malts though, as a single malt fan, I expect a more aggressive flavour when the whisky tie-in is featured so prominently. This isn't a bad beer by any means though and I'm still flummoxed as to why it's the one standard offering that isn't available in the US except in the odd little variety pack that has the Chambly beers and an Ephemere. One thing I'll definitely give this beer in parting: exceptional for only 5.5 ABV, and that alone would probably be enough to make it a semi-regular in my glass if it was just available in 4/6 packs in the States.","CortexBomb","Sep 12, 2009"

Aromas are of belgian yeast, clove spice, with a slight woody malty aroma, a fruitiness and a little bit of funk. Initial flavor is sweet, tangy, yeasty and full of cinammon clove spice. This inital flavor gives way to a more intense tang (citrus and sometimes a stronger almost metallic tang) with a more pronounced funk and somewhat fruity finish. I don't think the funk was parmesan cheese or stinky foot, but maybe a funky distant cousin of those two, if that makes any sense.

Something about it almost drinks like a rye ale (but when I ponder the Canadian --> whisky --> rye connexion, it almost makes sense). It really perks up with food! Try a good fresh fish or smoked/smoky meat. This would be a great counterfoil to smoked sausages when you don't want a Rauchbier.

A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Craft Ale House to-go for around $3. Poured into my nonic pint glass and after stirring up the yummies on the bottom of the bottle, appears a rather cloudy and murky honeyed apricot color with about two fingers of quickly fading, off white head. Nose consists of lightly smoked grains and is sweet and fruity. Flavor is of smoked green apples, spicy yeast, a touch of cracked pepper at the end.

The whiskey taste very slowly comes out in the flavor on the back end, after some more sweet banana and fairly firm, cookie-like malt.

Medium-bodied, while predictably smooth and creamy there's not much verve nor intensity to it. The clove, cinnamon spice is there, the banana, apricot, apple fruit same, there's even more thrust to the lemon, orange citrus. But it doesn't come together into a meaningful whole. The carbonation dulls it as well. Light white pepper and tea leaf flavors help. Unfortunately average.","farrago","Feb 16, 2009"

I got these flavors in the taste as well, a little mysterious but very tasty. The body is thick and full, very filling.

Perhaps I'm comparing it to their other offerings but nothing really jumps out. Dry malt and biscuit, yeast, some fruits, and some grass are all present.

Pours a clear dark golden almost amber color with a soapy white head that quickly settled into a thick ring around the glass, not much lacing. The aroma is faint, there is some apple skin, canned pineapple juice, light Belgian yeast funk and candi sugar. The taste is of pale malt, with appropriate candi sugar sweetness, the yeast flavors are subdued but I get a mild tropical fruitiness (pineapple), touch of coriander and pepper. There a stale hop presence to round out the brew. The feel is light and fizzy, and finishes dry. A Unibroue brew that is unique from their other offerings.

3.97,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyed last night at Pazzo's Pizza Pub, Lexington KY (a Pint Night offering). Don't think this beer is actually Belgian Pale, but it's quite a good beer, no matter the style. A very rusty colored, lightly viscous pour delivers a dainty head retention and light, creamy carbonation, which creame resists fading throughout. Moderate aromas of complex malts, aged hops, fruitiness, spicy esters, and a vineous, peat-ey / light smoke, musky scent sets the tone. A strong scent of metal and rust accompanies over-ripe fruits of peaches, dates, figs, grapes, pears, apricots, and mangos. Flavors hit on these same notes, but apply emphasis to a woodsy / musty character, a yeasty / bready flavor and texture; and strong, spicy / fruity esters. The textue is far lighter than the aroamas and flavors suggest; more Witbier-like than Belgian Pale. Very creamy textured, with light, powdery, cooling sensation. Alcohols remain light throughout. Waters a bit toward the end, but reamins very easy to drink.","BEERchitect","Sep 06, 2007"

Intriguingly the smokiness manifests itself more in line with smoked fruits than smoked malts, at least for me. My patience pays off, as the initially timid smokiness gradually tunes up, both on the aroma and the palate, and the finishing touch of smokiness is really rounded and nice, executed in a totally different way than Bamberg's smoked beer.

Aroma in my case was very attenuated, hard to pick anything in particular out. All I could taste with the first sip was smoke - if you could liquify a bushfire this would be it. Sure there were other flavours present, but I couldn't get past the smoke, which lingered for a long time in the aftertaste. Shouldn't be surprised of a smoky taste in a Smoked Beer style, however this lacked balance. The most disappointing of the Unibroues I have encounted so far. May need to come back and re-rate this as I experience more of this style.","hefevice","Mar 24, 2005"
3.95,2.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle courtesy of fellow Kentucky BAs, clvand0 and kmpitz2. I've never seen Raftman in a store anywhere, so have no clue where this one originated. ""Best before 04-04-03", sampled Feb 19, 2005. Pours a hazy, apricot body with a small offwhite head that retains for a few minutes. Sporadic film, patch, and some sheet lace noted. Aroma has tropical fruits, clove, white pepper, and some campfire smoke. Mouthfeel has a light medium body and some subdued effervescent carbonation. Taste is similar to other Unibroue Belgian pale ale stylings. Tropical fruit sweetness, spicy coriander and white pepper, and balancing bitterness from the hops and yeast. There is a noticeable smoked beef jerky component that comes from the use of lightly smoked whisky malts. Finish is clean and evenly balanced. Good drinkability from this Unibroue, even though it is apparently past its prime. The smoked malt character reminds me a bit of Germany's Bamberg smoked beers. Very interesting departure from Unibroue's always interesting line.","merlin48","Feb 19, 2005"

The smell was wonderful, but I was expecting a little more smokey aroma. The taste gave off a very interesting and enjoyable roasted flavor. It almost gives off a fruity smokness. This was the first smoked beer that I have sampled and I have to say that I am, once again, impressed with Unibroue.

The head retention was fair, after a moment or so it slithered to a fizzy cap and then a frail collar. There is no lacing, odd, which is disappointing. Still, overall, the appearance is attractive. The nose is weaker than I was expecting. Also, the aroma is distinctively Belgium with lots of yeasty complexities coming through. Vanilla, hints of fruit like oranges, peaches, and something tropical. Candied sugar. At the back is a suggestion of whiskey and peat. These smells are very faint; actually the fruitiness is frail too. No smokiness. The nose is boring, I like what I smell but what is it saying? Speak up! There is no invitation to drink. Ill be rude and take a sip anyway. Yum. There are the smoky flavors! On the palate, upfront are the characteristics of many Belgian Ales. There are flavors of candied sugar, vanilla, fruit (apples, peaches, oranges mainly with a hint of something tropical), maltiness sweetness that is pleasantly firm, and pepper. In the middle, the smokey characteristics are found, lightly meaty (fatty bacon, sausage), wood, pure smoke, and some whiskey flavors. Alcohol heat follows, more pepper notes too. The finish is very carbonated which does add a lot to this beer and the aftertaste is a good mix of fatty meat, smoke, and the skeleton of a light Belgium Ale. I am impressed at the complexities of a beer with such a small abv. It is very light drinking. Medium in body, light on the tongue but the carbonation is very big and lively; this adds great detail to this beer. The mouthfeel is pleasant. I could really dig this in the summer heat or even a cool winter evening. Id love to drink the more often, of course it is not available in Nebraska and I have not seen it in KC.

3.83,-0.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Raftman poured ever so beautifully, with as much head as you wish to pour, foamy, consistent and thick. The massive white head churns like butter or cream in the glass, making a noticeable crackle sound. Patchy lacing. The beer itself is off-ruby, with hints of orange, and it sometimes has the appearance of tomato-juice, but less red. Besides typical Unibroue spice and yeast smells, there is a very flowery, very herbal, and sweet aroma, smelling delicately like some whisky, even managing to give wooden, oak aromas. Every occasional sniff I smell a somewhat unnatural smell--solvent-like, rubbery, plastic. Hard to describe. Nectarines, plums, sour candy, delicate sweet malt, oak. Taste is much of the same, and this is probably the least vigorous Unibroue I have tasted for mouthfeel--it is very smooth, comparatively low-carbonated, and easy to drink quickly compared to most Unibroue products. (Not that I would drink this quickly, but it goes down with surprising swiftness.) Of course, the beer is only 5.5%. Definite wood tastes, with sweet malt, yeasty tones, and a sensational aftertaste of light malt, fruity esters, fresh pine needles, and floral, perfumy notes. Overall though, I wish they would give the beer more sweet whisky malt character, because mostly what I sense is the yeasty taste, which seems to overpower most of the other flavours. This is probably the most drinkable Unibroue I have had thus far, due to low gravity and lighter mouthfeel. Conclusion: this is another great product, but one which could probably improve from toning down the yeast or stepping up the whisky malt.","Cwrw","Jul 08, 2004"

Odor was subdued but interesting....musty-bready...slight accent of spice. Started mild then builds to a silky mouthfeel accented by malt body... slight wisps of smoke (like cooking toast) slight hop citrus tastes then a cleaner dry finish with an understated malty aftertaste.

Hard charging in the beginning followed by a just as hard retreat. I waited patiently for seven minutes for this beer to reveal it smokiness, but it fell well short. The slight waft of whiskey malt (beer is brewed in Sam Bronfman territory) was overshadowed by the fruit swril of apples and pears that lightened the 5.5% ABV.

A most unusual ale. Unibroue is most adept at crafting unique beers, and this is definitely one of those.","feloniousmonk","May 07, 2003"
3.74,-3.1,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Hazy apricot hue, topped by an intially thick vanilla white head that quickly fizzles into a thin, but tight layer. Devoid of any lace. Waft of buttery caramel and woody oak hits the nose at first, then is followed by a bright contrast of Unibroue yeast's signature ripe, juicy tropical fruit albeit at a diminished level compared to their other brews. Curious impression of grilled passionfruit topped with caramel syrup. Odd, yet enjoyable in aroma. Begins slowly flavorwise-- Doughy, flour like malt with a delayed sweetness intially in flavor lingers, and is ensued by citric, lightly acidic, kumkuat like fruit after a significant deliberation. Mild banana and peachy esters emerge mid palate simulataneously with lightly toffeeish caramel. Malt character ends rather abruptly, leaving the constituitively expressed, bittersweet non descript hop bitterness and residual sugar combination to dominate late. Moderate in body once the carbonation dissapates, revealing a functionally smooth, dextrinous mouthfeel. Mellow. Finishes with mild must and notes of candied citrus zest. Raftman is strange, yet enjoyable. It becomes much more balanced and mellow as it breathes and CO2 escapes. It's tasty, but lacks complexity; my least favorite Unibroue thus far.

(It reminded me of when Grandma would send me down to Pendergast's Bar to fetch Pop home for dinner, strictly a beer-and-a-shot kind of place in the Bronx. I can see where Proust was coming from...) Taste is also malt, whiskey, citrus, plus some caramel. A smooth, refined mouthfeel, with medium carbonation adding a nice tang. A smooth, malty sweet finish, with a small citrus tang finishes our whitewater excursion. Yum!","WaltTrombone","May 04, 2003"

The drinkability is pretty good, although the lingering yeast component could begin to wear on the taste buds during a prolonged session. But this beer has a refreshing quaity due to the effervescent carbonation and the quaffable ABV. I may end up drinking this beer more oftan than many of the other Unibroue offerings simply becasue it tastes very good, yet I don't need to plan when to have it due to the alcohol content. A very solid offering.","aaronh","Apr 19, 2003"
4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is perhaps the lightest of the Unibroue brews that Ive sampled. It was very crisp and refreshing. Poured a hazy copper/orange color with a medium bubbly head. The high carbonation level that seemed to keep the head alive the entire time I was drinking it. There was a small amount of whiskey malt in the aroma in addition to a bit of spicy clove and just a hint of smokiness. The taste is very enjoyable. Theres a kick of toasted malt on the initial taste followed by a subtle caramel and fruit sweetness. Theres a smoky taste left on the palate after finishing this one. It was very enjoyable. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone.","Scooter77","Apr 09, 2003"

4.16,7.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured amber in color with a small white head. The moderate to active carbonation feels great for this brew and adds alot to the experience. A soft floral and grape aroma fight for attention. Tastes a bit thin and sweet but some how it lingers for awhile. Raftman is very drinkable and is a good buy at six dollars for a 25oz. bottle.","paceyourself","Feb 24, 2003"
3.87,0.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The appearance is a golden orangish tone, with a white head along with a solid amount of lace lining the glass. The aroma has a nice apple fragrance along with some nice esters that arise to the nose. Very sweet flavors with the balancing bitterness arising in the finish, very mild smooth and refreshing. For Unibroue this one is lighter in flavor than most of their brews, but it is still a very solid selection that deserves a shot. It dances on the tongue with the high carbonation, but overall a lighter to medium body. Pretty drinkable, but the high carbonation would stop me from wanting to consume too many of these.","WVbeergeek","Feb 18, 2003"
4.52,17.1,4.5,5,5,3.5,3.5,"Excellent beer from Unibroue. The head is a nice light brown with big bubbles that settle fairly quickly. The beer is a deep golden to beige color in the glass. The mouthfeel is about average, but the smell and the taste just hit you head on. No that they're overly strong, but the whiskey malt adds a flavor and an aroma that are truly unique and very noticeable. Hints of smoke and an apple-like taste, with definite overtones of whiskey. A real pleasure to drink. I wouldn't be able to have too many because the flavor can get a little overwhelming after a few, but this is a very good beer.","far333","Jan 25, 2003"
4.25,10.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"All in all, a very enjoyable beer, that's certainly worth a closer look.

3.8,-1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Cork popped with no overflow. 750 ml bottle best before 11-28-2003. Pours dark gold with a slight orange tint. Large carbonated bubbles. Aroma is on the order of a Chimay. Taste is very dry leaving you wanting to take another drink to refresh. I don't know why I want to describe the taste as corky maybe this is a fault of this particular bottle. Actually I think this taste may be the yeast. Reminds me again of a Chimay. Doesn't have all the fruity tastes or lingering complexity of other Unibroue products still not a bad offering.","mjohn27603","Dec 20, 2002"
4.2,8.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Bright amber, medium head. Big apple cider flavor right off the bat, with twinge of spices and yeast, although mild compared to Unibroue's other offerings. Whisky-malt and smokiness is certainly present but obscured by fizziness and Belgian type yeast. Quite refreshing and a bizarre combination of flavors that works. I am getting a lot of wheat characteristics. Not being as awestruck by Unibroue's popular beers as a lot of people are, I was delightfully surprised by this. I was informed at the store that this is no longer available in the US? Is it a summer seasonal?","Thrasher","Nov 18, 2002"
3.7,-4.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Big strong alcohol quaff with some clean malt thrown in..  Lots of bubbles in  the hazy pale ale look.  Lasting white head.  Sweet smooth malt taste.  Not as complex as other unibroue offerings.  Smooth boddied malt base comes right at you.  Slight smoke/cinder finish.  As the brew warms the finish does also have a slight touch of floral aftertaste.","frank4sail","Oct 15, 2002"
4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazy (bottle conditioned) amber/orange in color with a full, dense white head that drops but keeps a decent 1/8"" of foam and leaves some minor lace. The aroma is fruity (citrusy... lightly lemon, and peach) and quite sweetish (candyish, even) with some noteable yeast character present. Very welcoming. The body is light but enhanced by a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation that gives it a fuller appearance and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is fruity and sweet, but backed by enough underlying bitterness to keep it anchored. There's soft flavors of light  & dark fruits (berries, peach, light citrus), a sweet & bready malt not unlike cookie dough, and a light peppery spiciness and some woody & vanilla notes from the yeast. Very nice. It finishes semi-sweet with a lingering sweet & fruity malt note. If smokiness is to be found in this beer, it's in the finish, and quite light. Well brewed. This would make a great apertif, or even a nice after-dinner drink paired with some lightly sweet dessert cookies or raspberry sorbet. Or, this would also make a great beer for a soft, lightly breezy summer evening as the sun goes down. Quite unique, and very enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 06, 2002"
4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy orange color and throws out a medium, dense white head that is well retained.  There are some subdued belgian yeast notes on the nose as well as a candy like sweetness.  The taste of this almost reminds me of the JW LEES barleywines, except this is a lot more subdued.  A dark fruit presence is noted.  Some yeasty doughy characteristics.   Whiskey malt?  I'm not sure what characteristics whiskey malt would add, but there is something a little unique about this beer that I can't pinpoint.  Probably the whiskey malt.  Maybe a bit of smokiness.  The body is light to medium.  Nicely carbonated mouthfeel.  And very easy drinking.  Another solid beer from Unibroue.","Bighuge","Sep 10, 2002"
4.4,14,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"edit: this needs to be expanded. The smokey overtones to this are very pleasant. I'm not sure if the whiskey malt comes through with any whiskey-ish flavours, but that sweet smokiness - akin to a campfire burning sugar maple, maybe - is all the result I need from the malts. The typical fantastic Unibroue mouthfeel is present. This would work well with old cheddar cheese, onion soup, or salmon. I have friends for whom the ultimate drinking beer is the Blanche de Chambly, for me it's Raftman.","the42ndtourist","Aug 16, 2002"
