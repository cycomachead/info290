"Exceptionally brewed, wonderful beer.  I would drink this quite a bit if it were available in my area.  Definitely worth trying."

"""A penchant for yeast," eh? There was such a pile of lees atop the kick that I was unsure as to how to proceed following the Pop!ping of the cap. Gentle? Mais oui! Certainment! But even at that, how could I avoid rousing the lees? Cue Cicerone (tm) CBS # 739! I began at a tremendous angle to the glass and poured until I saw the first bit of lees pull loose from the punt, at which time, I stopped the pour and let it settle back in the bottle. I used the bartender's trick to create a brief finger of fizzy, bone-white head that quickly reduced back to wisps. Color was pure Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity and my trio of gelt fiends, Midas, Croesus and Mammon appeared, fighting once again over who would get the first sip. I am deeply indebted to them, but I was not going to wait the outcome of their latest squabble. Nose had a Juicyfruit chewing gum odor, no doubt of the yeast. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was tart, like the lemon zestiness of the hops was in counterbalance with the sweet fruitiness of the yeast's esters. This was an experiment which needs tweaking, IMHO. Warming, I was getting black pepper and a mild funkiness, but the hops must have faded in the interim. Oh well. Finish was dry, tart and refreshing, but not really my cuppa tea. The final pour looked like murky lemonade. Nose was VERY funky! Taste was the melange as described earlier, but now more pronounced! Wow."

"Available on draft at the gas station down the street from my house. A strong, well textured beer that, to me, is almost perfectly balanced. Especially considering its potency. A must try for most beer advocates."
"Maybe I haven't had many beers with Belgian yeast strains lately, or maybe this became more potent with time. Regardless, this is basically bread splashed with fruits and vials of Belgian yeast. Interesting."
""
"Straw yellow body with a mild haze and a half inch of white head. Aromas of lemon, Belgian yeast, grain, Saaz hops? Initial flavor of lemon tartness quickly followed by sweet candies (lemonheads). Also notable is floral character with a healthy dose of Belgian yeast. Mild tartness in the finish with a nice helping of hops. Tasty."

"O: Solid, maybe should have drank it a bit younger, though overall nothing memorable"

"10/28...BCAA 2/12...pours hazy yellow, translucent, foam dissolves. Straw yeast nose. Slight citrus too. Opens tart, shifts into a hop bitter buzzed body. Tartness holds, but the bitter keeps poking through. Right on the edge of coming undone, slightly disjointed."

"An ok Belgian blonde, it really doesn't stand out much to me. I will say it's refreshing and enjoyable. Just not real great spice or hop profile for it to stand on its own. Just another average Beer Camp collab~"

"One of my last Beer Camp pack beers. Pours hazy, straw colored. Two inches of billowy white head that quickly faded to about a half inch. Nice lacing. The smell is grassy, with a little bit of yeasty funk. The taste is of coriander, a slight note of cloves and some nice Belgian funky flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty light, but it stays quite nicely on the palate, and finishes somewhat dry. This is one of my favorite beers out of the beer camp pack. Too bad it's a one-off beer. Nicely done!"

"Overall a very fine beer from two of my favorite brewers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More hoppy than some blondes out there, but pleasnt and fruity in flavour.For a one off, this is a fine collaboration."
"A refreshing Belgian blonde with nice balance between tropical fruit sweetness and hop bitterness."

"O: I'm not usually a fan of the Belgian style stuff, but this is pretty good."
""
""
""
"O- Decent qualities, but I think this one is just a little too hoppy for this style."
"Overall:  A very enjoyable BPA.  Need these guys to make more of these in the future."

"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with real mellow carbonation, a slightly bitter, funky bready finish that trails off almost clean yet leaves a lingering grainy sweetness residue. This was good, but I expected more from this collaboration of Northern California legends. If this was a regular rotation beer I would definitely have it again since it was tasty."
"I was anxiously awaiting a try of this, Russian River is like a unicorn in Western PA. Poured a nice, translucent golden color into the snifter, with little head. Big yeasty notes on the nose, a bit of nutmeg/allspice, and some citrus (as the brew warmed up). Hops were very faded (it was bottled almost 4 months ago, so I was expecting this), however with a little time, some grapefruit/citrus came through. Good, clean flavors though. Great mouthfeel. This was very good, even with my arriving to the party late... though I would say that the Allagash collaboration edged it out by a good deal! Still very happy with Beer Camp!"
"Has a big fruit nose dominated by orange over light biscuit with hints of peach and light banana. It pours peachy gold with a light haze under a  1” finely bubbled foam cap that quickly dissipates. A rich, creamy fruity attack features large pitted fruits, orange and a suggestion of tropical fruit but no banana. There is some spice in the background – maybe oregano. A very effervescent beer with a medium light body, Yonder Bock finishes sparkly clean and refreshing. While the beer is hop forward, providing an assertive bitterness on the finish, it in no way interferes with the Belgian yeast flavors and the hop flavors are refined enough to sneak by those who dislike hops."
"Pours golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma is sweet fruity notes, ripe fruit, biscuit malt some yeast. Taste same as aroma with some mildly spiced bitter hops. Palate is a medium body, moderate carbonation. Finish is mild sweet fruity ripe tart flavor with a mildly dry spiced hops bitterness. Overall this brew is good drinking and fairly balanced for the style, not the best but still enjoyable."

"Even though this isn't and IPA or porter/stout my two favorite styles this beer left me wanting another one of these, which is a pretty big thumbs up in my book."
""
""

"O=Nice, but not special wheat beer...would pair well with ham."
""
""
""
""

"o: A good Belgian blonde, very representative of the style. I imagine Ommegang or Allagash would be proud to call this their own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is not good."
"O - As mentioned above, the overpowering clove makes this hard to rate as anything above ""average"". A misfire."
""
"Bottle from the mix pack purchased at Tipples. Pours hazy but almost clear, light yellow, with a bright white head on top the recedes quickly. Aroma of banana esters, dried grass, barnyard funk, sharp dryness, sweet pears and apples. Very nice. Flavor is funky dry grassiness, some lightly sweet fruit, lingering grassy hop character on the palate. Dry, light bodied, and high carbonation. Not bad, pretty crisp, and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Glowing Blonde color with a thin fizzy head. The nose holds a peppery, clovey, doughy aroma with some grassiness and apple sweetness. This has a brash clove flavor which is not suited to my taste. There is a bit of apple and pear in the mid palate. Black licorice or anise with a perfumey floral hop finish makes this my least favorite of the 12."

"overall - it's alright, but I usually prefer my Belgian style beers darker."
""
""
"O-Another semi miss from the mix pack.  Not as good as I was expecting."
"A solid Belgian Pale Ale with a nice balance of Belgian yeast and American hops. The yeast is not overdone and doesn't dominate the beer allowing semi-juicy hop notes to come through."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I was expecting a lot more from this collaboration; tastes as though this has some Brett in it though I don't see any reference to that on the label; whether it does or doesn't, the flavor profile didn't particularly appeal to me"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The flavor has a similarly lemony-citrus characteristic to it, light and delicate and floral to boot. It tapers into a crisp, hoppy finish that’s clear and clean, inviting one sip after another. This was one of those beers I was so excited to share but at the same time wish I had another bottle to enjoy. Delicious!"
""
""
""
"A nice take. Starts off a bit rough and unpolished, but some time and air give it a bit of balance. Falls a little short on the complexity, but it's a solid bottle."
""
""
"Overall a really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't my favorite style, and I don't think it is necessarily a good representation of that style. But overall it is non-offensive and acceptable on a summer day.  This was my first sampling from the Beer Camp case, hope things improve."
"expecting more from this colab"
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Bottle: Poured a yellow color ale with a quite large foamy head good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of yeasty notes with some light citrus hoppy notes also noticeable. Taste is dominated by Belgian malt with some yeasty notes and a medium citrus hoppy finish. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Nothing to write home about but still very enjoyable Belgian ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smell is all Belgian yeast, a little citrus lemon, wheat.  Not much to say here beyond that.  The flavor is very clean, Belgian yeast, a little funk, grass and hay, tropical fruit with a citrus finish.  Very clean, simple.  It's good, above average, but nothing mind blowing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very enjoyable Belgian Pale Ale.  Nice Belgian yeast flavor that isn't overpowering.  Good body and hop flavor."
"O:  This Yvan wasn't so great.  Another Beer Camp that just didn't know where it was going."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very crisp from start to finish. Long lasting aftertaste as the flavor stick to the tongue. Superbly refreshing and a nice hoppy belgian styled blonde."
"O: A nice twist on a traditional Belgian Pale Ale with the addition of the citrus/lemon hop flavors and aromas. Enjoyable with well hidden alcohol and relatively easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decently made beer, just not the style I prefer.  Would have actually liked the hops to be dialed down a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As a saison, it's a solid one.  Not my favorite hoppy saison, but a good beer regardless."
""
""
""
"D:  A completely well balanced and sessionable Belgian style pale.  This was very good and I could see it as a real crowd pleaser.  Not my top pick from the pack since it doesn’t bring much wow factor but little flawed here and I could crush me some Yvans tell you what."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is excellent, people.  Otherwordly, almost.  I think maybe it's improved a bit aging for a couple of months."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This was a very easy drinking and quite enjoyable brew overall.  While it had a somewhat sweeter nature overall (which was quite nice I must say) it was still very crisp and quite refreshing making for a very nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid offering from Sierra Nevada and Russian River. Fruity, yeasty nose. Well-balanced taste & mouthfeel. The brett works in nicely with the malt backbone. I, like most people, probably expected more from this Beer Camp offering. However, it's a solid brew and would probably garner higher ratings in a blind taste test."

"Taste is crisp, clean, and fruity with some citrus from the hops coming in around the edges. I wonder if some of the happiness may be muted, as this was bottled over 60 days before it reached me. Nonetheless, this remains a delicious and thoroughly enjoyable Belgian-toned IPA."
""
""
" The taste is great -yeast driven with tangy saison-like vinous element and light fruity flavors from the hops as it warms with mild grapefruit and slight tangy herbal tinged taste with slight dry cracker-like malt with toasted and earthy hay like flavor w/ slight spice as the beer still finishes with mild hop and yeast flavor which cohabitate well. This is a very drinkable pale with a nice yeast and hop combo for 6.3% it has a nice complexity level...I expected nothing less from Russian River and Sierra Nevada!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy yellow with a medium head.   Flavor is similar to aroma except a much clear contribution from the hops (grassy and green and a small amount of fruit) in both flavor and bittering, which is  a little sharp.   Nice feel with softness from the bubbles and reasonably smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For this style, I either love it or hate it, so to think this beer is average is a good thing I guess.  I just felt like it was going to be a homerun and just came short.  An average beer from two amazing breweries.  Maybe they should have done a sour, or an IPA--two things that Russian River are known for."
"The beer pours very little white foamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a very yellow gold that is clear. The beer smell consists of earthy hops and the usual suspects for a BPA. The notes are a lighter than usual bubblegum note that is probably created by candied sugars and a bit of yeast that gives off a nice breaded note. The taste has a stronger hop note than the smell. No bubblegum notes but the candied sugars are noticeable as well as a bit of a yeast taste as well. The beer is fairly smooth with consistent and effervescent carbonation. Medium bodied but on the lighter side. A decent beer, and worth trying at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a transparent straw yellow with a wonderful shine and a fizzy head that didn't hang out. Nose is classic Belgian pale with sweet bubblegum notes and candied sugar.  Taste is solid as well with a nice brush of earthy warmth over the bubblegum and candy notes. Finish is a touch dry and this is a great Belgian pale.  A highlight so far in the set."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's pretty flavorful for a blonde ale. Slight mineral flavor in the finish that I find odd."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the tropical and orange flavors sold me on this beer. I thought it tasted awesome. One of the better beers from this style for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Belgian Pale Ale. Nice mix of fruit esters and spices with a solid malt presence."
""
"D - An excellent Belgian Pale Ale... Hands down my favorite Beer Camp Across America offering to date (out of 4 beers)... The mouthfeel is a bit of a bummer, but all other facets are solidly above average... I would drink on occasion if this were available year round... A very nice collaboration between two excellent breweries..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: One of my favorites from the pack so far, very well done."
""
""
"O - very easy to drink with some nice flavors, but for some reason I wasn't crazy over it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little on the lighter side which is almost surprising given the abv. This makes is very refreshing and quite easy to drink. Quite a nice part of the 12-pack"
""
"Overall a lovely beer. The first I've had from the Beer Camp pack. I look forward to more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in an Oversized Wine glass"
""
""
""
"Overall, decent, but pretty forgettable, IMHO. Pretty disappointing, cause I had high expectations for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent straw color with an inch of head. Almost no lacing. The aroma is very funky with some yeast, coriander, banana, apple and cloves. The taste is much of the same. Lots of sour yeasty funk upfront followed by cloves, coriander and banana. Bready with some apple near the end. Funk and clove finish. Peppery at times. Minimal alcohol presence. Lots of carbonation. I was hoping for more from the collaboration with Russian River. Overall, meh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste begins with a bready sweetness. Moves to the fruitiness from the yeast and finishes with a crisp spiciness. Lighter bodied and semi dry finish. Nice beer, but it seems the hops may have faded a touch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall a decent beer would have again"
""
""
"Overall, this is why I bought the Beer Camp case. Beer like this. This is a really tasty blonde and I would definitely get this one again. Its probably not what most people thought a Russian River Collab would be, but as a Blonde this is terrific."
"O: Decent blonde ale with good strong hop notes. Not very layered or complex but it works as a good hoppy lighter blond style ale."
""

"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Across America Yvan The Great ---3.5/5"
""
""
"O- Overall a pleasant beer and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: not a bad Belgian blond. well done, good flavors and aromas. not going to blow any socks off, but a tasty brew."
""
"This one is a winner. I wouldn't mind seeing Yvan the Great in a Sierra Nevada rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a one finger white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of saison style yeast, clove, light bready malt, apple juice; spicy. Flavor is Belgian saison style yeast, clove, hint of funk, then developing a lightly buttery, bready malt flavor for a melded malt and Belgian style finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A successful hybrid of American blonde and Belgian pale styles, combining the dry start of Belgian yeast and spicing with the lightly buttery blonde malt. Nicely done. Blondes tend to be a bit pedestrian for me, but I liked this combination of styles quite a bit. Another winner from this interesting Beer Camp box."
"Overall, this is one of my more preferred beers out of the pack, as the brewers at RR and SN have managed to find that sweet spot between the two quintessential characters of American and Belgian approaches--hops and yeast. And with both, they manage to infuse them without letting one overpower the other, so this stays firmly out of the IPA/Tripel hybrid that is the Belgian IPA. Instead, you have a much easier drinking, but nicely interesting beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I didn't really care for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Russian River. Pours a nice light golden color with a little head. Smells like a classic Belgian blonde, yeasty, citrus. Tastes also like a classic Belgian blonde. It's dry, lemony, decently smooth, lighter than expected, with a little dry hop bite on the finish. No one is rewriting the book on this blonde but its a damn tasty blonde. Kudos for making just a good example of the style. Could def drink a couple of these."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good Belgian Blonde with Saison qualities and light hoppy presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is on the lighter side of medium, with a slightly sweet finish. Drinkability is very good, if it were on tap, I'd probably order it a couple times. Overall, a solid brew."
""
"Overall - A nice beer, a little simple in flavor, nothing new to the style just solid and a easy drinker. Maybe a little more malt or hop profile to tame down the sour notes could make this one smoother and more balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a well crafted beer with tons of hoppy and Belgian characteristics."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty funky as it warms up. The sweetness seems to intensify. This is so far my favorite of the 2014 Beer Camp box, though it's not a casualy sipping brew."
""
""
""
""
"O- Reminds me a fair bit of Damnation but with more of a citrus kick to it. Very good stuff."
"The 2014 beer camp set was disappointing and I probably will not seek them out so enthusiastically next year. It certainly was a very poor value."

"Pour into Voodoo Brewing Snifter"
""

"O- Ok, but wouldn't go after it again if it were avalable regualarly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a graceful ale, bringing together Belgian and blonde characteristics effortlessly. This was a real pleasing beer - something I would buy again."
"O: This beer is a very good represention of the style and incorporates the citrusy hops rather well while still making it taste like a Belgian beer."
""
"This collaboration was a complete let down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this beer very much."
"O) It's okay... Not a style I go for on a regular basis in the first place. If I was going with a camp analogy, I'd say this was like arts and crafts day for me. I'm not miserable, but I'll be happy to move on to whatever is next on the itinerary."
""
"O. A solid blonde ale with a good Belgian yeast balance against sweet, vinous fruit notes. It's relatively easy drinking, with a deft touch that is balanced by strong flavors. Solid."
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. Very well balanced and very tasty. Too often I find the yeast flavor is overpowering in a Belgian, or else non-existent. This offering treads the line between too much and not enough with near perfection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall OK but nothing too special, not quite a Belgian pale like, light saison like notes with some phenols, spices, orange zest, little lemony, lots of generic citrus though, and some light hops but OK, nothing great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh. Looks okay off the pour; holds a bit too much clarity, I'd have to say. Nose is Belgian sugar sweetness. Flavor carries a good bit of the same. Seems somewhat thick and muddled. No real distinct defining character that sets it apart from others of its style. Bread tones and clear yeast are there. It's just kind of a punch in the mouth, with nothing showing more than anything else. For something from Russian River, I would expect something significantly more interesting."
""
""
""
"O-Relatively tasty but too flat and too boring. Hey, when you have two breweries putting their names behind a collab, sorry, expectations will be high."
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O: Nice blonde, and very light on the Belgian part, but I think that is what elevates it among blondes."
""
""
""
"O - This was a nice Belgian pale. Very crisp and refreshing. A nice summer beer."
""
""
"Overall: The second hopped up Belgian pale ale of the Beer Camp variety pack. Seems a little redundant, although I am not complaining, this is good."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting more from this. It's pretty good, but I think there are better examples."
""
""
""
""
""
"(Reminds me of my homebrew Ron Jeremy's Blond Ale I brewed a couple of times.)"
""
"SUBLIME; HAVE SOME!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is just a very pleasant beer to drink all around. Great balance, and very sessionable. Completely inoffensive in nature as well, it should be an approachable beer for everyone. It's great balance, soft approach, and sheer ease of drinkability make it the standout of the mix pack so far. I wish this were more than a one off-collaboration, because if they could get it in a fairly priced four or six pack, I'd drink more of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is rich with lemony hops, belgian yeast notes and a notable peppery coriander spice component. More lemony grain on the taste and with a spicy and smooth finish. Touch of coarseness on the finish arrives with warming of the beer. Offers a well balanced carbonation and body to give a full enough feel on the finish. Not too thin and yet not too much residual sweetness either. Easy drinking brew and nice take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice, mildly tart, yeasty blond. The belgian yeast overpowers other aspects of the beer a little too much for my liking but this is still a very serviceable and easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An enjoyable Belgian-style beer, but nothing really stand out for me."
""
""
"O - Strikes the right balance for me between Belgian and American Blonde styles."
"light alcohol warming, fairly low carbonation, no protein creaminess but not crisp and refreshing. Drinkability would be improved at a higher fizz, though it would probably over-emphasize theyeast character which is already high. Very solid; could be great."
"O: a good, relatively hoppy version of a style that is not among my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyed this brew, but nothing remarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I feel like this package is solid, but nothing spectacular has hit me just yet. I have been through I guess about half, maybe a little over half and so far what we are getting is mediocre beers from what has been determined to be spectacular breweries. I am not sure what that means in respect to this collaboration, but as I have stated before it was still worth giving it a try and maybe one that I do try will blow my hair back, as some people put it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it’s a nice medium to full bodied complex carbonation fine Belgian style golden ale with an American hop punch I’m enjoying it quite frankly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Let's start with the nose... oh my God what a nose, floral and soapy as hell. It pours a clear bright golden color, with little to no head... but the nose drives it all. The taste takes a back seat, but it's still a damn good beer. I've seen a lot of people knocking this Beer Camp series, but most everything is flirting with an overall 4."

"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a bright, crystal clear, blonde coloring, with a halo of white head. Nose of farmhouse funk, all-spice, oregano, and a bready backbone. Flavors are all spice forward and heavy, with a resinous hops character to follow, and a subtle sourness in the backbone, with hints of funk. Very herbal up front, with a rich sweetness to balance. Light and crisp in mouth, with a spiced and funky aftertaste. The finish is effervesced and clean."

"O) Exactly what a beer of this style should taste like. Never going to compare with the truly awesome IPAs and sours (obviously this is a personal taste thing), but very solid and I would buy this if available."

"Great fruit flavors going on here, and the bitterness is fairly subdued. Surprised this doesn't rate better."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, earth, spice, citrus zest, and Belgian yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a Belgian yeast presence that is a bit more dominant than the hop aspects."

"12oz. bottle served in a Perfect Pint. Pours a straw-gold with a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, 1/8th inch bright white head that quickly dissipates towards the edges leaving a dollop in the center. Nose expresses belgian yeast, coriander, citrus and a bright herbal quality. Taste follows nose; however, herbal quality is more pronounced as well as some spice. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but close to light) with a bright carbonation and a mild acidity. Overall - drinkable with a nice hops profile. Not something I could drink a lot of, but one in a sitting is quite pleasant."
""
"o: quite enjoyable. its mix of herbal spice, ripe fruits, and sweet citrus plays well together. definitely a nice Saturday afternoon beer with nice flavors"
"Overall a neat take on a Belgian Pale Ale."
"Pours golden color with finger width foamy head. There is moderate head retention and lacing on the side of the glass. There is a zesty, sour fruity aroma. Actually has a funkiness to it. That is probably the Belgian yeast. Malty taste up front with strong bitter, hoppy taste. At the end, you get the more sour Belgian flavor. This seems to be more of a borderline sour ale to me. It is good, but probably can't drink too many without starting too much of the dry sour taste."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/2/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, banana, pear, apple, white grape, clove, pepper, light bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, banana, pear, apple, white grape, clove, pepper, bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate yeast spice/hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, banana, pear, apple, white grape, bubblegum, clove, pepper, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a nice crisp malt/yeast spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian pale ale! All around good complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall (4.25): Honestly, this is delicious. As with the other beers I’ve had from this pack, I wish it were fresher but man it’s still pretty damn good where it is now. Fortunately, this is a style that doesn’t HINGE on the hop presence, and the beer aside from the hops is just delicious and very well-executed. I love a good Belgian Pale, and this one has a great structure, finesse, and superb drinkability. The appearance might be a bit disappointing, but everything else is very, very nice. Ugh, give it to me daily."
""
"O- This is a pretty hopped up Belgian ale, but even with the big hop presence it blends very well with the Belgian yeast and complements it. Very effervescent, dry, and almost champagne-like."

"The taste begins with the toasted biscuit and orange like the aroma suggests but there is a peppery spice character the finishes it. I enjoyed this and it is true to the style."
"Overall - pretty good beer. I like the smell more then anything else. Russian river makes some fantastic beers and I was hoping for a little more. Great spin on a hopped up Belgian style blonde though."
"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy straw gold color with a half inch white head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing at all. The brew smells like bready malt, cloves, lemon peel, and some peaches. It tastes like peppery spice, green apples, cloves, banana, citrus peel, bready malt, and apricots. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. I thought it was an OK brew, but I guess I was just hoping for something better. Still, it was nice to try this one."

"Mouthfeel is full and nicely dry. Clear simple and plain this is a solid beer that is saved by the solid dryness driven flavor."

"If one were to regard this summer's Sierra Nevada Beer Camp box through a lens of Neil LaBute works, it would not require an immense leap of logic to find parallels between Yvan the Great and Myron's Walk that exist across LaBute's own The Shape of Things and In the Company of Men. While both are aggressive to the point of discomfort and give little regard to conventional norms, Yvan (much like Company) proves itself less coherent (in motive and execution) in addition to being more broadly structured by a ceaseless incisiveness."

"From the new twelve pack, I was hoping for a RR IPA but oh well. Yellow color, slight haze, good head. Smell was weird, definitely Belgian but just sort of a strange bit of spice. Flavor was odd too, yeasty but weird, some hops, just an odd beer overall. Not sure I would ever revisit another bottle of this again though it wasn't bad at all."

"I'm with this beer. I really enjoyed it. It's far from a simple beer."
"Pale yellow pour with a thin layer of light foam that fades. Smells of pale malt and fruit esters and faintly banana. Taste is yeasty, lightly cloves, banana and a bit of bubblegum. Fruit esters. Some bitterness from a citrus pith flavored hop. It's a nice zesty flavor profile reminiscent of a light version of Stone's Cali-belgi. Body seems on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is bright. Tasty brew but no presence of nose."

"This is a pale crystal-clear gold with a head that quickly fades away to almost nothing. The aroma, however, is pretty nice, spicy-phenolic, hoppy, with a light fruitiness. The flavor is a nice change from the other beers I've had in the collection: this one is well-balanced and interesting, with a clean but stead maltiness, deliciously yeasty-spicy character that gives a little pepperiness (is there coriander in here too? It tastes like it to me, but it might be the yeast character), with light but very ripe fruitiness. This is a very well-done Belgian-style, that doesn't adhere to any particular style but which is interesting and very drinkable."

"i guess we all probably hoped for some crazy fruited barrel ages sour or something, given russian river, but we got a very simple and streamlined blonde ale. i get that this is less impressive than what the potential was, but lets call a spade a spade, and admit that this is a fine example of the style, regardless of the price or the makers or anything else. this one is nearly crystal clear, pale yellow, sweet honey colored, with a rising white head that fades as fast as it came up. its a little sweet, more malt middle than expected in the style, maybe could have stood a few more days drying out in fermentation, but i find it flattering here. while the beer is still light in overall stature, its all little more substantive than a lot of blondes, and i respect that. i also dig the yeast, its got some pleasant summer fruit esters that marry into the malt real well, while the finish is still clean. i dont know why all the labels of beer camp beers talk about hops, i didnt find any to be real hoppy, especially this one, which is a little grassy in the finish if anything, but has no bitterness or resins at all. good example of the style if a bit bland next to expectations."
"Cheers!"

"Pours into a small tulip glass a clear lemony yellow with a fluffy one finger white head that leaves no lacing as it settles.Citrus fruits and phenols in the nose,although not a fan of over phenolic beers this goes well with the big citric notes.A big hit of the yeasty phenols upfront but a big splash of lemon oils in the finish,it really hits the back of the tongue.Not bad and good for the warm weather,not a huge fan of the style but this one I kinda like."

"Overall 4.0: Excellent Belgian Ale. Light, refreshing and with many different delicious flavor levels, this baby is just a pleasure to drink. No hint of alcohol, but is pretty big (7%+) and is well worth the purchase of the 12 pack to try it out. Heartily recommended."

"O: Yeah. No. Considering Russian River's reputation, I want to blame Sierra Nevada for this one, but this beer is far more characteristic of Russian River's style than it is Sierra Nevada's. Regardless, it's a collaboration that appears to have brought out the worst in each."
""
""
"O: A pretty enjoyable beer, overall. A bit lacking in carbonation, but smells and tastes quite good."
"Peace!"
"Taste shows off some nice yeast complexity, dry and bitter in the aftertaste with some mildly phenolic pepper notes and mild herbal hop bitterness. Crisp and substantial in feel, though manages to be dry, light, and refreshing. One of the standouts from the 12 pack, which was largely average on the whole."
"Overall not the greatest thing ever made but if this was a seasonal if pick it up again."
""
"Overall- Solid, good beer to really good beer- pretty much in between. A good take on the style and the hops are well integrated with the yeast and Belgian notes. I would definitely recommend trying this beer."
"overly sweet. nowhere near as good as taras boulba!"
""
"A very interesting take with a Belgian style beer. The appearance was a nice pale hazy yellow. The smell was full of Belgian wheat and yeast, but with a lot of floral notes coming from the hops as well. The taste was very complex with first the mellow light notes of Belgian wheat and yeast, but opened up to flavors of mint, some herbs, as well as banana and spiced orange. Very interesting beer to enjoy and had a nice light mouthfeel which made for a pleasant drink."

"Poured a pretty clear golden yellow with a thin ring of white foam. The body looks fantastic, but a larger, fluffier head would make the appearance that much better. Scents of esters and phenols, big on banana and clove aromas, with notes of bubblegum and pear apricot with a faint sour tang and hints of biscuity malt faintly discernible I. The background. A very good aroma that captures the best of Belgian yeast. Taste begins with a nice hit of fruity flavors with notes of citrus and lemon peel with a moderate undercurrent of phenolic white pepper and clove spiciness and some biscuity malt keeping the flavor soft at the start. This moves into a moderately bitter middle with notes of pear and lemon peel and more pronounced phenolic spiciness with some floral and spicy hop flavors. Finish is dry with notes of spicy phenolic clove and white pepper yeast and lemon peel and a moderate level of hop bitterness and earthy hop flavors. Aftertaste is white pepper and clove with moderate lemon peel-like bitterness. A very nice, fairly complex flavor profile that highlights the best aspects of Belgian Pale Ales with an increased hop bite. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a slightly chalky, drying feel. Very nice, refreshing and easy to drink. Overall this is a good example of a Belgian Pale Ale that combines the best of Belgian yeast aromas and flavors with a nice, higher level of hop character than is normal and a refreshing mouthfeel to make a very drinkable beer. Very well done."

"Pours a clear gold, two fingers thick soapy white head, settles to a thin layer with a few dots on the glass. Smell: doughy, semisweet, coriander, lightly fruity, floral. Taste: semi-ripe nectarine, mild pale sweetness, coriander. Finishes dry, clean bitterness, soapy. It's...fine...not sure why the label references ""farmhouse ales."""
""
""
"Pours out a clear, pale straw with a thin bone white head. Crisp pils malt smell with Belgian yeast. In the nose, it reminds me of SN Summerfest with clove. Malt flavor is pils, honey, crusty white bread. Yeast is spicy. Hops are floral. Flavor is light and with active carbonation. Really solid beer overall. Really reminded me of a Belgian Summerfest."
"Overall - Good beer. Nothing particularly special, but it's a nice example of the style."

"The color is a golden yellow with a small head, minimal lacing. Good aroma, but my nose was stuffed and couldn't get too good of a whiff. Lots of carbonation and it stays with your tongue, I like that a lot. Flavors is bitter, but not overpowering with hops, some light citrus, lots of spice and yeast. Dry finish. Made it very easy to drink. Could easily knock back a few of these. Can put it up there in my list, unfortunately, it's a limited brew."
"Pours a clear glimmering golden capped by a one and half finger clean white head. Average retention, just a trace of lacing. Citrus, Belgian yeast, and a bit of bubblegum on the nose. Opens with ""Juicy Fruit"" gum, grapeskin, pear, and other mixed fruit notes, crackery pale malt midpalate. White pepper, mixed citrus, with mild citrus/citrus rind bitterness on the bone dry finish. Light slick and smooth body, moderate carbonation. Nothing groundbreaking but certainly a solid, tasty brew."
