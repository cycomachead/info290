Its a straightforward belgian pale ale if you ask me. It has that classic Belgian spice and yeast with some fruit complexity. One of the better American Belgian style ales iv had actually. Overall a solid beer in a style i normally wouldnt seek out","Bone53","Friday at 07:46 PM"

Highly carbonated in appearance and texture, which is juxtaposed with a creaminess that I found rather appealing. This beers maintains a thin but dense head all the way to the bottom of the glass. Little to no hop punch, this is malt and yeast forward beer to be sure. Not a huge fan of ambers in general but this is one of the better ones I've had, perhaps because of its departure from the style.","dd43","Mar 23, 2015"

I know they miss the mark on occasions with some releases, but their core group as well as some of their special releases are all top notch and for me this is the one that's overlooked at times. But I tell you, this may be Ommegang's best overall beer. It goes well when paired with about anything imaginable and is very drinkable. In fact, its one that could be enjoyed all day long in any season of the year. Here is my tribute to Rare Vos, the remarkable sly fox from New York's Belgian brewery.","BradtheGreat7","May 13, 2014"

To me, this beer is quite straightforward, but does a very good job of it. I got brown sugar and apples right off the bat, followed quickly by the belgian yeast, very clove like. Leaves a nice clove spice on your palette. Easy to drink, I could definitely have more than one. One of the better belgian-style beers I have had in awhile, I would definitely recommend it.","sloambbr","May 07, 2014"

The nose is dominated by caramel malts, orange, coriander, pepper, and Belgian-y yeasty funkiness. The mouthfeel is creamy, effervescent, and quite rich. The flavor follows the nose but with even more complexity, balance, and depth. This is a very good beer and an excellent introduction to belgian ales for those strictly used to American offerings.","lochef81","Apr 28, 2014"

A little fruity in the nose but the yeast takes the forefront here. Taste is more of the nice Belgian yeast and what was in the nose. There is a little fruity hops with a great aftertaste that includes a slight bitterness but not overwhelming. I really love the Belgian yeast so this is all win for me. Mouthfeel is really quite thick for the style which is hard to do and keep all these variables together in such a nice beer. Really a nice beer that I haven't had for years and really glad I tried it again.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 23, 2013"

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, but I don't think I could drink more than one or two of these since I think the carbonation would really start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was the fruit profile in the aroma and taste, it was a nice mixture of fruits that worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, I know this style is suppose to have a higher carbonation, but I thought it was a little out of control. I think I would buy this beer again, but not very often and I think it might go well with food and it's not too over priced. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian Pale Ales, even through it's not the truest to style it still has most of the key attributes that define this style. All in all I enjoyed this beer, it wasn't my favorite of the style, but I thought it was pretty nice and a little unique. Good job guys this is a solid easy drinking beer that's pretty close to a Belgian Pale Ale, i'm happy I gave this beer a try.","StoutHunter","Aug 29, 2013"

Smells spicy with black pepper & clove, notes of sweet citrus (orange peel), coriander. Spicy phenols persist after other aromas fade from the nose. Tastes sweet, yet finishes dry. Lemon & orange flavors with ample hop bitterness. Bitterness lingers and stings the tip of the tongue. Feels about medium full. Alcohol kept well in check. A delicious beer. Very well brewed and solid all around. Love the complexity and aptly priced for a Belgian made in America.","jwhancher","Jul 20, 2013"

However, being neither altogether crisp and refreshing, nor very satisfying and filling, it left a bit of an emptiness in my belly. Could have done with less of the citrus fruit. There's already so much going on, that cutting back on the oranges a notch may actually bring out more of that complexity.","BethanyB","Jun 21, 2013"

Taste of cinnamon apples, oranges and rind, honey, clove, and I aggressive but still noticeable booze. Big bodied but oddly, not that chewy, more fluffy. Easy drinkin' and flavorful.

Good lacing and the taste is smooth . Again Ommegang has the made the perfect dubbel in that you can taste no alcohol except a touch in the finish. Little pepper on the nose and it’s a little on the thin side. Sweet yeasty malty, soft on the carbonation with a slightly sticky, dry finish. Although the hops are not up front on the palate they balance nicely with the malt and this beer is very delicious without tasting too heavy. Ommegang never fails to delight and this is a superb and contemporary Belgian Pale Ale.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Pours moderately hazy and cloudy orange amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big banana, pear, apple, orange peel, light caramel, clove, pepper, coriander, floral, bread, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with malt and spices. Taste of big banana, pear, apple, orange peel, clove, pepper, light caramel, bread, coriander, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, orange peel, clove, pepper, caramel, bread, coriander, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with malt sweetness and spices; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, foamy, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian pale ale! Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink, even at high carbonation. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

I followed their pairing directions and have had it with pub food - pizza, wings, side of fries or onion rings - it really is a easy drinking, medium alcohol beer that is great at home or out at your favorite bar or restaurant. A nice introductory Belgian for newcomers to the various Belgian styles. The women in my family love this as well - a beer for everyone really and ranks in my top 10 favorite, ever.","CZs","Apr 21, 2013"

It is so great. The palate has a caramelized malt, not at all sweet, showing wonderfully expressed pepper-like tones. The high carbonation, and the hops, well balanced with malt and spices, is what we expect from the style. The aftertaste brings us hops and... pepper! What a wonderful beer. Perfect for a more intellectual conversation (I'm sure the 6.5 ABV would help...).","HabiMendes","Apr 05, 2013"

Pleasant aroma of clove, peach, pear and citrus fruit, light banana, enticing. Flavor is relatively muted compared to the aroma, with biscuit malt, caramel , finishing somewhat dry with a lingering dry caramel aftertaste with hints of hops. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. An unusual flavor combination that is well integrated so that individual caramel, light fruit and yeast flavors reveal themselves and fade away during the taste. I greatly enjoyed this ale, as I have all of Ommegang's offerings.","LiquidAmber","Apr 02, 2013"

Primary aroma was a yeasty smell, with a hint of pepper undertone. Flavor a peppery spice, with a finish of a slight hoppy kick. Felt reaonable in the mouth, a bit of kick on the tongue, with a bit of texture and chew.

The smell is somewhat mild but pleasant with peppery spice, belgian yeast esters and a touch of light fruit as the main contributors. Malt aromas a muted but a mild bready character is there as well. The taste is also largely dominated by the peppery spicy character with some definitive hop bitterness and floral flavors in there as well. The base of the beer is built on a solid, somewhat sweet caramely malt which provides good balance for the rest of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is also quite nice with just the right amount of carbonation, bitterness and a dry finish that leaves just a touch of the peppery tingle. Overall this is a very good Belgian pale ale, while I feel the smell could be a bit more assertive and the the taste may be just short of great, this is still pretty good.","fank2788","Oct 12, 2012"

4.08,0.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"A very nice offering from Ommegang. It's somewhat of a crossover Belgian/Amber - something I've been dying to try from a brewery like this. Ommegang showcases some excellent fruits and spices with just the right amount of Belgian yeast. It's a bit tart and finishes dry. The reddish orange hue is also quite nice. The uniqueness of this beer takes it to another level, for me. Very nice.","TheRealBigC","Sep 03, 2012"
3.85,-5.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a pint glass, decanting properly so as not to disturb the yeast sediment. Pours slightly hazy copper with a tall, soapy eggshell colored head. The head dissipates slowly. There are lots of noticeable tiny bubbles in this beer. The Belgian yeast aromas hit the nose first, delivering fruity notes of banana and apple. I can pick up some biscuit aromas from the malt. There's also a touch of citrus. The flavors follow the profile of a typical Belgian amber. The yeast brings the fruit flavor profiles from the nose like that banana, apple, and citrus. There's some mild spiciness. The malt provides a nice backbone for this beer without being too heavy. The shot of beer left at the bottom of the bottle really had some nice Belgian yeast flavor. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean. The drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Sep 03, 2012"

The crisp, sweet fruits and yeast spice dominate a little too much making it felt a little overly sweet and almost apple juice like at times.

4.03,-1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Taste/mouthfeel/drinkability - Banana and apples are noticeable right away. A sweet, medium-bodied, delicious Malt profile that compliments the light Belgian yeast front. Pairs perfectly with the bacon-bit cheddar burger that sat in the Brooklyn East IPA. The light spiciness does wonders to reset the palate from the burger and the smokiness of the spicy sausage wrapped in banana peppers. This ale is light as it spritzes on the tongue with a bit of acidity. Toffee-like malt is noted in the aftertaste. The taste of Belgian yeast conquers the fruity notes as the beer warms up. The ethanol is well-balanced and completely hidden. Not nearly as dry as some other reviewers have mentioned. It leaves me satisfied with every drink.","Jesse13713","Jul 01, 2012"

Smell is of very pleasant fruit and spice, cloves, perhaps coriander. Tastes of very pleasant yeast and malt without undue sweetness, and with a grassy and spicy character, not overbearing. Hops bitterness is most obvious in the finish, but is also very measured and perfectly balances the malt. Though not very high in alcohol, it's taste is quite noticeable.

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"D: A bit light to be categorized as a BDA, but the brewery bills it as an amber and that seems right. Lots of Belgian character, but in a balanced and rounded way. It is very approachable and drinkable. This would go great with a broad range of dishes.","SickGnar","May 29, 2011"
3.41,-16.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"See, there is a beer with ""Rare"" in the name that doesn't get blasted by many BAs. It pours a cloudy red-orange topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises clove, orange peel, black pepper, light nutmeg, wheat, and a plenty o' bread, which seems to smother everything else after a few sniffs. The taste tones down the bread in favor of the spicier notes, and the orange really shines through a bit more here. I think I get a touch of cinnamon in the background. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate (though kinda prickly) carbonation and a finish that borders on the refreshing. Overall, a pretty nice Belgian-style brew, but I think it's one of the lower points in Ommegang's repertoire.","TMoney2591","May 27, 2011"

3.83,-5.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A ""true belgian style amber ale"" from Cooperstown, NY. Apparently, rare vos is Flemish for sly fox. Sports a distinct, foggy orange honey color that looks as refreshing as it sounds and retains a ""rocky"" head quite well. Smell is typical of quality amber ales with sweet, but mellow, notes of cloves, bread and citrus. Taste is similar to smell, accentuated by a sharp (almost overbearing) shot of carbonation. There is a lingering bitterness as well as some buried caramel accents. This does get a little sweeter as it gets warmer and overall a very decent brew.","RashyGrillCook","May 02, 2011"

This beer smells of clove, spice, and has a earthy smell to it. The taste is nice, not too heavy, not too light. Has a outdoorsy, citrusy, spicy taste to it. This would be a great summer beer. I actually would like a little more alcohol in the taste, as I don't get any. For the style, this is a good beer. Maybe not world class, but on a hot summer day I'd pick it up in a second.

Malt and hops bring tones of crispy crackers, light caramel, white sugar and a touch of flowers and grass. The flavour is fruity up front with tones of citrus but there is also some notes of apples and apricots. Undertones of grassy bitter hops and toasted/cracker-like malt.

Often I have to put my nose close to smell the beer, but I could smell the aroma of spice, hops, fruit and yeast as I poured. I paired Rare Vos with Thanksgiving dinner (Thank you Beer Advocate). This was THE PERFECT beer to go with the heavy starches, poultry and gravy. The fruit, spice, hops and yeast balanced out the heavy meal. Every sip was pure heaven. It has a medium body with medium carbonation. This beer is highly drinkable with a low abv. My only regret is that I had only 1 bottle to go with dinner.","mweso2000","Nov 25, 2010"

Slightly tart nose, but fruity with pear, a touch of lemon, a light dusting of clove, and a bit of breadiness. Pleasant. The taste is even better. Beautifully balanced with nice spicebox and fruit notes balanced by some yeasty breadiness and a touch of caramel. More pear and clove, but everything is rather restrained rather than in your face. Subtlety can be a good think. The finish is harmonious union of the pear, caramel, and clove- without being very sweet. Slightly on the carbonated side, but with a creamy, soft fizz to it. Very nice with a cheese plate, and quite drinkable. Lovely.","Georgiabeer","Oct 18, 2010"

The wheat content of the beer makes it cloudy as is typically seen with other wheat beers but seems to be even cloudier than most. The smell hold citrus notes which helps the beer achieve a higher level of drinkablilty because it is not too strong of a wheat taste. When poured out of the bottle it produces a nice fluffy head which beatifully compliments the color of the brew.

This ale has kind of a tartness to it, but far from overbearing, and a good compliment to it's natural fruity tones.

A little candy sweetness lingers underneath among some slight phenolic activity. Tastes fruity and spicy up front with a bitterness that works in almost perfectly toward the end. A bit of tartness is noticed as well as some taffy. Disparate characteristics blended well to push the taste upwards to perfect, but not quite, as the finish becomes a bit weak. Mouth-feel lies on the full side of medium, and this one goes down a bit dry, with a modicum of alcohol heat touching the back of the throat.

No lacing is left on my glass as I drink the beer. This one is appetizing looking but doesn't have the lacing or head the style calls for. Smells of belgian yeast, belgian spices, malts and a bit of alcohol and maybe some citrus. I find the smell kind of weak and a bit overpowered by the yeast, it does however adhere to it's style. Taste is very similar to the smell but I feel like there is a better balance, belgian yeast and spices with some malts and citrus, not much hop presence if any. Mouthfeel is a nice creamy and medium body, has a lot of carbonation (a tiny bit too much for my liking), alcohol warming was not bad at first but took over toward the end of the beer and a nice thick coating on the mouth. All in all this beer is pretty drinkable, it has a great taste but the alcohol and spicyness might take over after a few, the price was not that bad either. I feel like this is a great example of a Belgian Dark Ale's taste but the weak smell and appearance keep it from being a great overall Belgian Dark, I would probably buy this one again as a solid Belgian Dark.","cbutova","Sep 13, 2009"

There's constant bubbling action radiating from the bottom of the glass and rising towards the top. The aroma is very limiting, in my opinion. I can only find the typical Belgian yeast strain odor and some hints of fruitiness - nothing more. The taste however, is completely the opposite. At first taste, you're hit with a subtle spiciness and orange/citrus lingering, topped off by the breadiness of the yeast and the warmth of the alcohol. The mouthfeel is very crisp and light. The bitterness from the hops lines the inners of your cheeks and along the top surface of the tongue - very nice. The drinkability is decently high.

Carbonation is spritzy and coarse. In my opinion the carbonation gets in the way of the beer's flavor....there's little enough of that as it is. To me it seems as if I'm drinking tonic water, the body is thin and the beer is close enough to flavorless that it bears a striking resembelence. This is one that I'll not be buying again. Not a big fan at all. This one does nothing for me. Dekonink has a real toned down amber as well, but that one is crafted much better than this one, the feel is right and its got a nicer flavor.

It smells very minerally, almost beachy, with light, fruity ethers reminiscent of apricots, and a pleasant, natural yeastiness. The fact that all of these aromas are present and yet all very subtle makes this beer very intriguing. I've become accustomed to Belgian-style ales practically smacking me in the nose and jarring my tongue with their intensity but this beer does none of those things. Rare Vos has a lot of finesse. Its flavors are complex yet gentle. Its fruity notes range from peaches and apricots to sour strawberries. Its bitterness is best described as unripened fruit rather than ""citrusy," ""piney," ""earthy"" or what have you. Finishes dry and leaves you excited for the next sip.

That might make no sense if I knew a bit more about brewing, but I can only report what I see, and I saw a head dissipate very rapidly. Anyway, the smell is spicy and Belgian. It's a little muted, but there are good notes of dough, coriander, earth and light fruit, maybe apricots. The taste is quite good and a bit of an improvement on the aroma. Some lemon flavor makes itself known, along with more spicing and some background caramel. The feel is sparkly and nice, but it gets a tad sticky in an odd way. The finish is just a bit watery sticky, rather than full sticky if that makes any sense.

The nice carbonation makes for lots of bite but leaves a smooth foamy mouthfeel after each swallow. Hops are just right.

Right upfront I get a tangy tartness that is not appealing to me in the least. Light maltiness never comes full circle and seems weak and underpowered. A subtle yeasty fruitness is underlying and is really the best part of this disapointing offering. Ommegang has impressed me over and over,this one just didn't do it.

The taste starts off with some sweet malt and gives way to a wide array of fruits including dark plums, grapes, and little pineapple and citrus. After that the hops and spices kick in, including some anise and coriander. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with medium carbonation that ends in a little dryness. This is not necessarily the most drinkable beer as far as quantity, but it's definitely one that will make you think about what you're drinking. The taste is constantly shifting, which is perfect for the large bottle I bought it in.

Taste is more of they yeasty and bready experience, but there's a slight metallic flavor as well. Not sure where that is coming from. Very highly carbonated.

4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This came across as a nice example of a Belgium Amber, even though I'm relatively new to the style this is a solid beer. Pour was an intense copper with abundant head and lacing, both of which lasted for the entire experience. Constant carbonation is visible. The aroma came across similar to other Belgian styles that I have had, in fact it smelled similar to a saison. I believe it is the yeast that produces this unique aroma and flavor. Somewhat spicy and hoppy, there was a definite presence of sweet malts, perhaps a touch of caramel. The flavor is good although a bit weak in my opinion when compared to the aroma. Malty with nice overtones of spices and fruits, there is a well deserved hop finish in the flavor that is especially nice. Tasty and complex a truly enjoyable beer.","kinger","Aug 01, 2008"

The color is a beautiful amber-mahogany, with a bit white head that settles down to about an inch and stays there. There's plenty of fruit in the taste, but the most striking thing to me was how smooth it was, and how rich it tasted down to the last drop.

4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I frequent the Ommegang beers more than just about any other brand. They are cheap, easily accessible, and about as close as you can get when it comes to an American brewery taking on Belgian styles (Allagash coming in at a close second IMO). Nine times out of ten I go with Hennepin, Ommegang or Three Philosophers, but rarely this one (or the witbier). The first time I tried it I don't remember being all that impressed, but with this new batch, I decided it was time for another visit. Poured in to my Stella Artois glass a very nice strawberry blond, with a large, foamy white head. The color is quite striking, giving off a sort of glow. Aroma reveals a melange of fruit such as orange, lemon, nectarine, and also a pinch of spice lingering in the background. Flavor begins with the citrus fruits mentioned above, with a nice yeasty finish. Malt is also worth mentioning, as it is well balanced with the light hops. Mouthfeel is lush, nicely carbonated, and very refreshing. Although the ABV isn't all that high, I could feel a bit of warmth after a few sips. I still could drink two bottles of this without too much of a problem. I am now quite happy I came back to this one. It seems like the most underrated of the beers from Ommegang.","jamie2dope","Feb 27, 2008"

My point on the ""dark"" characteristic is...if they're calling in news crews because we're 'drinking a dark' then I'm missing the boat. Duval is calling this an amber...OK, it's amber. How difficult is it to rate a beer when the swath of acceptable interpretation is so wide that you can drive a truck through it...what's the point. Again, Dr. Lew Bryson has a fitting argument about 'style'. Anyway, it smells 'wonderful'. IMO, when a beverage reveals that classic earthy Belgian yeast aroma then you're in for a treat. What's interesting to me about this one is that how malt presents itself in a toasted character. There is an aggressiveness that i would normally associate with alcohol, but at 6.5% ABV, this one may be deceiving me. The mouth feel is well carbonated and light. The flavor is earthy, creamy and has a maltiness that i personally associate with a lager. The mouth/taste combination is quite drinkable.

It's an absolutely out-of-this-world-smooth amber- more american brewers need to make amber's like this. It's the polar opposite of the Hopback Amber/Nugget Nectar-school of amber brewing, and is put together nicely enough that it's merits can be thrown up against Brewery Ommegang's other offerings; not an easy accomplishment when you are going against Three Philosopher's and Ommegang Abbey Ale, but this beer for a lot of people will eclipse the aforementioned beers. This is a beer that, if it were more widely distributed, could be like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, occupying the growing category of gateway beers that bring the drinker from generic American Macro Lagers to Craft Brewed beers.

Also there is a classic clove yeast scent that is just so good! Also a nice subdued spiciness. The flavor is very good, spicy on the back of the mouth reminds me of a peppery mix, sweet flavors from the malts almost a candy like flavor. Adequate hop and a nice semi-dry finish. Now I will admit that I am not the best at putting my thoughts down on paper so I know that I am missing a few things here but IMO this is a excellent brew, one that I have had numerous times in the past (being in NY) but not in a number of years.

The finish is oaky with a lot of tannins and an odd bitterness. Not bad, but not what I expected. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, nicely carbonated though. The drinkability isn't bad, as your tastebuds warm to it. The finish is pleasant and just dry enough to urge another sip. I like it, but not as much as I remember from a couple of years ago. Not sure if its changed, I have, or we both have. I'll have to give this another go to figure it out, I think.","roblowther","May 11, 2007"

Only a slight fruity aroma penetrated my olefactory senses, but the flavor is dynamite ... warming, yeast, orange rind, light spice.

Once you've sampled the rich, crisp, hoppy smell however you may kick yourself if you pour too quick. The head won't go anywhere on this slightly ruddy, amber brew. So pour with care and you can enjoy it right away. Start is malty smooth with a slightly sweet note. Settles full-bodied with a variety of flavors. Caramel, wheat, and a near-hidden fruitiness are the most distinct flavors i can detect. Finishes with a hop bitter edge and a long-lasting but not altogether unpleasant aftertaste. In fact, I dare say for those who like amber beers this is an ideal bottle. Especially when it's as fresh as the ones I picked up today. It has superlative character, flavor, and blend. Rare Vos is without a doubt the ""sly fox"" of full-bodied ales. In fact, I think I may have found a new favorite beer. Well, that's a tough call, but I am certain it is my favorite when it comes to non-vintage micro- or macrobrews. I only wish I could get a four-pack of this stuff in Texas instead of making the trek into the far north! Give it a try and I know you won't be disappointed.","theozag","Feb 04, 2007"

This ale is a smooth, complex, well balanced assortment of cloves, ginger, and lemons which compliment a soft maltiness. A nice peppery earthiness was detected through out. For such a complex brew, the finish is surprisingly dry and spritzy, with just some phenols lingering in the aftertaste. This has got to be one of the finest ales I've drank.

The smell is very sweet, with Belgian yeast, spice, and estery smells leading the way. Taste is similar, with the addition of some fruitier flavors such as banana and citric acid. A peppery flavor lingers towards the end of a taste, much like la Maudite. The aftertaste is dry and slick, as the sweetness of the yeast, malts, and fruits are offset rather aggressively (for the style) by hops. There is a lot of nice flavor here, and this is the first corked Belgian style ale I have had that isn't intimidatingly high in alcohol. This bomber will do me just fine. This is an interesting, exciting, and very drinkable take. In my parts, this is going for almost $9/bottle, rather than the $6ish it should be going for, so it is difficult to choose this over comparably priced Chimay.

The aroma is very phenolic right off the bat, with spicy yeast and a lemony zest combined with nutty malts, green/leafy/spicy hops, and notes of pear, apple, and melon. The taste is the same but adds cloves, medicine, banana, and a phenolic bitterness that eventually gives way to a hoppy bitterness, all on top of a body that starts prickly, but evens out to reveal a medium body that is quite smooth.

Taste profile is pleasingly light, yet very complex and exciting. Citrus offers a lively play on the tongue, encouraged in its performance by a worthy hop presence.

Pale malts lend a little breadiness to the aroma, which is well complimented by ripe bananas, a little citrous, and some grassiness and spice. Malts are thick and extreme in their breadiness. Citrous is cleanly bittering with lemons and bitter orange peel. A little graininess is there, and also some grass. Coriander, as well as other spices are present (a little clove?). Subtle fruit sweetness, considerably less than the nose would suggest. Mouthfeel is very full, but broken up by tons of carbonation. We damn near broke a light popping the cork out of this bad boy!

4.42,8.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle - cellared for roughly a year. Carefully poured from a long-standing, chilled bottle it's a perfectly clear orange amber beneath a big-bubbled head of white foam that holds splendidly and leaves some thin splatters of lace about the glass. The nose is lightly fruity (apricot, lemon rind, orange), a touch cork-like or musty, and subtly spicy. In the mouth it's light-medium bodied and zesty on the tongue due to its effervescent carbonation. The flavor is exactly as the nose suggets it might be with a bit more sweet malt, a touch more fruit, a sprinkling of delicate floral hops, and alot of peppery spice! It's well-balanced, but it relies more on its thin maltiness and peppery yeast to do that than it does hop bitterness. It finishes dry and refreshing with a quick passing of fruitiness followed by some lingering chalky dryness. The yeast pour brings out a little more character and lends the body a touch of girth; and I prefer it that way. Additionally, I don't feel that this beer really gains anything from cellaring other than to drop some of the yeast out of suspension (a rough, fresh bottle can be a bit much).

3.95,-2.9,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"750 ml corked bottle. Hazy apricot color with a large white head. The aroma is yeasty. There is also fruit, mainly oranges and strawberries, in the nose. Very spicy smelling. The flavor starts out sweet and fruity. This is clearly a bottled conditioned beer. I find the finish too bitter. It's not bitter like hops, but more like orange peels. While this detracts from the flavor a bit, the flavor is still very nice. A nice beer from Ommegang, but not their best.","beveragecaptain","May 26, 2005"

Went well with my salmon, lemon, taragon and pepper grilling concoction. Very drinkable, I had to pace myself or I was gonna finish before I was done eating.

Nose is nicely malted with light hints of spice and plums. The start is lightly sweet and the grain profile adequate, the top is moderate in feel. Finishing is punishing in its acidity, the hop delightful in their spicy bite, very dry after taste that lingers long, a good beer, but I sample only rarely.","Gusler","May 12, 2005"

Comes in with a slight banana note at the finish. I wish I could've keep this to cellar, but I went a little crazy at the store where I bought this, near our motel.

Solid lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is more faint than I was expecting, I'm picking up spices and traces of a juicy red fruit, like grapes or plums, also a bit of earthiness in there as well. The flavour also contains that red plum-like characteristic, as well as some grass, and on the finish I begin to start noticing some sweet malt blended with spices, mostly clove and pepper.

The smell is very... what is it? It's not light, theres plenty to smell. Its very straightforward in its subtleties. This could probably use a good aging, but I'm drinking it straight from the store. From the smell of this beer, I instantly remember touring the Ommegang brewery and seeing the sample of spices they use, because theyre in the smell, thas for sure. I cant put my finger on them specifically, but what I do smell is a figgy cherry fruitiness along wiht a spiced wheaty aroma, all of which smelled quite sweet. The taste is sour fruity spice, with an alcoholic malty flavor and the definately hint of the yeasts. There is a hint of the hops too, but not overpronounced. The mouthfeel is a bit too dry feeling for me, with the combination of the light body, the good amount of small bubbles and an overall dry taste. Besides that though, its a good beer definatley.","FranklinPCombs","May 10, 2004"

As soon as it began to lace the rim, I noticed a fruity banana aroma coming out of the glass. The first sip revealed a smooth body that left a slight tingle on the tongue. Its light and relaxed malty flavor, laced with spicy undertones is not as rich or filling as Ommegang's other brews, but (with its relatively low ABV) would make this a great session brew.","JamesBerry","Mar 25, 2004"

Aroma is sweet and fruity, including concord grapes, buttery yeast, and a bit of malt. The mouthfeel of this is over carbonated and really thins out the full flavors of the brew. Very fruity tasting, a little bit of spiceness from the yeast and hops, but hardly any malt flavor. I was rather disappointed, this is my least favorite from Ommegang so far.

At least not in the bottle I tried. It poured a clear amber with a white head that was short lasting with little lacing. The aroma was of malt, yeast, and a little hops. The taste just didn't have the unique, Belgian kick to it that I was expecting. It was a little thin, actually quite thin in the mouth, but that may be due to the low alcohol content. Come to think of it, that may be what is missing in this beer. At 6.5%, it was just thin, compared to Belgians at 8, 9, or 10 percent. In its favor, it was half the price so I could drink a few of these, but not as a Belgian substitute.","rdrummer","Jan 25, 2004"

Taste is sweet caramel malts upfront, yeasty breadiness, peppery spices, and a touch of bittering hops. Finishes a bit dry without any overpowering aftertaste. A decent American version of a Belgian Pale Ale, but it doesn't seem very strong. Seems to me, it's missing something. Maybe in the yeast strains they're using.

The foam that was produced was thick, rich, creamy, sticky, full and colored and off white in color. Lasting power was very nice. It produced a nice sticky lace on the sides of the glass. The aromas that this beer produced were of alcohol soaked fruits, big malts, some grains, plums, raisins and a banana, lots of spices (clove, nutmeg, pepper, licorice), hints of yeast and like a tree bark tendency. The tastes were dominated by all the spices that were noticeable in the nose: cloves, peppers, nutmegs, licorice, followed by some sweet malts and fruits (some dark sweet fruits, bananas and apples), then yeasty bread grains, and hints of alcohol. Aftertaste was of dry yeast, drier overall then I would have thought with the sweetness taking a back seat, and only emerging on occasions. But refreshing and a different view of the style. Not as heavy as I would have thought comparing it to others of the same style, more of a medium/light medium body. Decently complex in the nose and pallet. Good and would probably get again.

Sweet sharp malt tones with fruit phenols dancing along the palate what a great beer, same yeast profile just a tad peppery in the flavor profile and a mild bitter hop profile to go along with it. Just amazing that this beer wasn't brewed in Belgium, in my eyes the high carbonation makes this beer able to cut right through the flavors of a well done prime rib or any other lucious meat.

Mouthfeel is spritzy, with a watery thin body. Taste begins with florid carbonation, immediately fading into a thin bitterness with nary a hint of hop flavor or aroma...more of a tannic bitterness, like oversteeped black tea. There is a toasty note in the middle, a mentionable complete lack of malt body or sugar, followed by more chemical bitterness in the watery, thin finish. The finish reminds me of chewing a Tylenol. In the aftertaste, I tend to pick up roasted barley astringency and some isopropyl alcohol. As it warms, the alcohol becomes obtrusive and drys out the mouth.

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Slightly cloudy orange body, topped by a hefty big-bubbled white head. Head settles down to a half-inch topper shortly. A large snout of a nose, dominated by apples, lemons and oranges (not the grapefruit of cascade hops). Also a strong spicy character, peppery (not spicy like the dry spice of an overdone Christmas ale). All the characters of the nose are also in the taste: the spicy, peppery hops, a very apple/citrus fruity taste. Finishes surprisingly dry and clean. Could make a really fine ""relaxing on the deck in summer"" beer.","RonfromJersey","Apr 12, 2003"

Kind of a dry malt taste, with some noticeable hop bitterness. Medium-bodied and crisp. Dry finish and has a honey-like aftertaste.

Poured into a wide mouth belgian goblet as the bottle instructs. Off-white to beige head. Subtle smells of mulled spices. Cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg too. Taste was a bit oddly sweet, syrupy and full of spices. Hints of black pepper and sweet carmel malt, but nutmeg and cinnamon seem to dominate the flavors, but they don't balance and malt or traditional yeasty belgian flavors. Chewy full belgian feel fades as is the glass sits, and it turns into a muddled, spice filled, watery concoction. All beer and belgian flavors seem to fade into a wierd mess. There are present to start, but they fade fast. Seemingly artificial alcohol heat to finish. Watery, thin, and slippery feel linger. An all out search for positive flavors left on the tongue, comes up empty. Not one to savor, and honestly hard to finish the entire bottle. Maybe my taste buds aren't refined enough. This one was a dissapointment to me. My apologies to those that are a big fan of this one. I liked the other two from this brewery. I don't think it was past it's prime, I just didn't enjoy it like I hoped I would.","StevieW","Mar 27, 2003"

After the froth dies down, a sticky web-like lace is left on the glass. Aromas are quite yeasty with moderately fruity undertones. Initial taste is somewhat malty, mixed with yeast and citrus fruit. A nice crisp zing of spiciness, possibly coriander, is left on the tongue. This is one exceptionally complex, yet balanced brew.","Scooter77","Mar 19, 2003"

I was also impressed by the fact that the flavor didnt follow in lock step with the aroma, offering up some nice appley tartness that was non-existent in the aroma. I will take off points for the possible addition of Coppertone and cabbage to the kettle, but Ill be fair enough to recognize this beer strengths too","TXHops","Mar 18, 2003"
4.15,2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a well-balanced, though not overly complex, brew. It pours a cloudy, medium-dark amber with a light tan head which settles into a weblike lace. There is hoppy smell, but not much by way of spice. The mouthfeel is exquisite--cottony soft and a lightly fine carbonation. There's an initially tart taste--the hops--which fades deliberately into a slighly fruity finish. Very drinkable. I like everything about this brew and the brewery that makes it; they are clearly doing something right.","longpondbeerman","Mar 18, 2003"

Out of the four beers they brew this is in the middle of the pack, but for this brewery that still means exceptional. Vos poured a sweet orange color with a fair bit of cloudiness and sediment. The head was white and ginormous as a good Belgian should be. The smell was spicy with just a subtle hint of hops. The taste was full bodied with a sweet malted characteristic and some hops and pepper in the back. Seeing how carefully they attend to the brews only made me appreciate this even more. I can't wait for my 750 of the abby.","GreatPondBrewer","Mar 17, 2003"

4.23,3.9,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"Unibroue can't go wrong. This beer pours with an enormous fluffy head. The aroma is dark fruits, malts, sweetness, and a touch of hops. This has such a beautifully smooth mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation zing. It's sweet, a little spicy, some cloves and fruitiness as well. Not much to say other than buy this 750mL for the very far from objectionable price.

Ommengang stands alone in US belgian style beers, but this beer just fell a little short in my opinion.

I will definitely sample this one again.","BeerBuilder","Feb 24, 2003"

Yeasty but not bready--a creamy, smooth mix of light malts and hops topped off with the spiciness that shows up in the nose. Alcohol warmth shows up more and more as the beer warms up.

Medium-bodied, peppery, very well carbonated, malt and yeasty-must battle for supremacy on the palate but the sweetness and fruitness are not to be ignored. Complex, a true pleasure to drink.

4.39,7.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazy dried apricot color with a large foam that settles quickly. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of head retention, since Belgians usually have no problem with this. Complex aroma of grape (making it a bit wine-like), plum, a bit of citrus, a touch of malt, and a hint of Belgian spicy yeast. Flavor profile differs a good deal from the aroma, but is also very complex, and definitely tasty. Bread-like malt, smoothed fruity bitterness, and yeast character up front, with an underlying yet rich spiciness. Dark fruits appear at the back, the aforementioned plum mostly. Grape-like acidity is present throughout. Finishes with a more apparent hop bitterness and a touch more yeast. Medium to full-bodied. With another pour from the 750 ml bottle and an immediate taste before the head settles, the mouthfeel is much better and the spiciness created by that wonderful yeast is more apparent. This would definitely benefit from better head retention. However, this is quite a tasty, complex, unique, and extremely drinkable ale. Definitely worth a try. I'd love to pair it with some food next time.","hyuga","Dec 06, 2002"

The taste was particularly sweet and fruity, with a Champagne mouthfeel. A slight (very slight) taste of cider suggested that this had slightly passed its perfect age, but all-in-all it was very satisfying, and went very well with Thanksgiving dinner.","jackndan","Nov 29, 2002"

The taste IMO was somewhere between an Ommegang and Hennipin, less fruity the the O and not as hoppy as the H.  It was more of a malt taste with hints of subtle hops and fruit/spice flavor.

Coating mouthfeel, sense of fruitiness ranging toward apple and peaches with a simulation of an estery feel.  Attenuates mid mouth with an astringent (straying to sour) close and a somewhat dryish finish.

Slightly tart smell with some apples, peaches, and other lighter fruits.  Great starting fruitiness that has a nice refreshing tartness to it with some definite apple, raisin, orange zest, and some sweet candy flavors as well.  The sweet fruitiness is offset nicely by just enough earthy noble hop flavors.  The brew is slightly effervescant across the tongue and also rather smooth as well.  This is one very drinkable brew regardless of the time of year.  They just don't seem to know how to make anything that isn't excellent at this brewery.","Murph","Sep 11, 2002"

4.06,-0.2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Impressive off - white fluffy, thick and very persistent head.  Slight hazy copper - orange hue, w/ copious, effervescent bubbling.  Quite attractive in appearance.  The aroma is comprised of notes of peach & candied fruit followed by understated acetaldehyde w/ just a hint of phenol.  Caramelized sweetness hits upfront, but is immediately mellowed by honey flavors & sour apple as well as black licorice.  The high carbonation coupled with the relatively full and dextrinous body for style lend a spritzy (but not prickly) and enjoyable mouthfeel.  All around yeast esters are more mellow than the typical Belgian, but contribute more than sufficient complexity to this very drinkable brew.  The clean finish reveals hop bitterness on the back of the tongue as well as a light biscuit flavor and mustiness.  Alcohol warmth slowly emerges long after the sip is over.  The 750 mL bottle is perfect... it's drinkability makes 12 oz a tease.","marc77","Jun 19, 2002"
