4.5,11.9,,,,,,"Batch 012. Appears cloudy golden, with aromas of yeast and floral notes, maybe a hint of citrus. Not too much on the palate other than the expected taste of yeast and a trace of lemon and a mild bitterness. Very well carbonated and easy to drink. The finish is dry, but the yeasty flavor sits for a long time. Very refreshing. I could easily drink multiple bottles. I would say this is a good average Belgian Ale.","Robloc303","Sep 12, 2014"

It didn't blow my hair back, and maybe because of the hype surrounding the brewery this review isn't the most impartial. I think I did a good job though. However, for the difficulty of obtaining this beer, there are a dozen others that are just as good. Condor recommended, Condor approved.","TheCondor","Sep 04, 2014"

Seems like their wheelhouse is sour ales and types of IPA, both of which I love. Reminds me of Damnation in some ways, which I suppose makes sense, but whatever they do to increase the ABV of Damnation also imparts a bit more interesting components to the beer, as I liked it better than this one. There are several BPAs that I would drink before expending the effort to procure another bottle of this.","LambicPentameter","Beers"

Pours very hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, clove, wheat, pepper, coriander, floral, banana peel, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, clove, pepper, coriander, wheat, banana, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, coriander, wheat, banana, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast and malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian blonde ale. All around nice balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 08, 2013"

Remains smooth and maintains a nice dry finish. Extremely drinkable beer, goes quick, especially on a humid day like today. A very nice beer of a style I don't normally appreciate as much as I should but am occasionally craving. A well done beer.","AndyAvalanche","Jul 07, 2013"

These flavors, coupled with the lively carbonation lend the beer a very thirst quenching character. Belgian ""single"" ales aren't too common to find, but this is one definitely worth seeking out.","flayedandskinned","Jul 01, 2013"

Aroma of wheat, light malt, yeast and Belgian spicing. Sweet wheat flavor, almost reminiscent of a heffeweizen, light malt and Belgian spice. Finish is sweet wheat and then an increasing bitterness. Pleasant, but not quite as good as the best Belgian pale ales. An interesting ale that I will revisit.","LiquidAmber","Jul 02, 2012"

Prickly, fizzy, and slightly explosive, the carbonation fizzes when the beer is held in the mouth and foams up when the beer is swallowed. This, with the lighter body, can make it a little difficult to really dissect the flavors of the beer.","output01x","Mar 06, 2012"

Light bodied with a light leafy bitterness that only appeared in the finish. Before that, it was fruity (apples and pears) with a pale malt character, perhaps a hint of yeast.

The nose is definitely funk, apple, pear, lemon mustiness. Simply outstanding- this could totally be a beer from Belgium- and that's high praise. The taste follows suit, with Brett, lemon, malt, apple, pear all there. There's a slight sourness, but it's not over the top. Feel is a lemon tartness, with an nice malt backbone. Very full for the style, with only a slightly dry finish. Overall, this beer wowed me. I first got into craft beer through drinking Belgian beers, and this could totally fool me into thinking it was from there. Excellent job by Russian River, once again.

Got a smallish, frothy, sudsy, off white head that soon settled to a thin cover and a bit of lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber with loads of large bubble trails. Aroma has a lot going on with yeast, malt, citrus, apples, balsamic vinegar, perfume, wet grain. Flavor is similar to nose with the carbonic tang hitting you then all those other things & it's fairly dry. Body n carbonation are perfect for style. Finish is like flavor, plus it also leaves ""sweet spit", I guess as mouth's reaction to the acids. Clean and average length. Sipping beer and I bet it'd be a blast to cook with.","drpimento","Beers"

I feel a brew like this should be in a regular bomber for about $6. Perhaps a 6-pack of cans around $11. Yes, it's bottle conditioned, well made, and I am sure a tedious brew.. but this is 2011.

There is also some sour characteristic to the flavor, which blends with the beer very well. The beer is very crisp and light in mouth, and leaves a slightly sour and spiced aftertaste in your mouth that transitions into a slight puckering sour if you space out the sips long enough.

3.54,-11.9,4.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"D: Described on the bottle as an abbey ""single", this beer is a challenge to judge against others of that category due to their rarity. The practical alternative is to compare it to some of Russian River's other low-gravity offerings. Unfortunately it is found lacking--Gaffer's bitter, Little White Lie, or even OVL stout are all more worthy and interesting. This beer comes across as a very light saison, with little more character (and possibly less) than the Bruery's Seven-Grain saison. Ultimately it is a less than perfect comparison as Redemption fails to cross a threshold of appeal for that style. A curious choice for bottled distribution, to say the least.","beagle75","Dec 12, 2010"

Nose is style consistent - cloves, lemon rind and a trace of coriander. Taste consistent with nose - flavor profile is quite herbal with perhaps the addition of rosemary. Citrus character is a bit more subdued than suggested by the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and a dry finish. A good Belgian Pale ale; however, perhaps a bit too herbal for my liking. Nonetheless, a solid example of the style.","Jwale73","Dec 01, 2010"

A lot of salty and peppery soft cheeses and dough, with a hard stale bread wheaty-ness. very light and drinkable mouthfeel, not super crisp in the carbination dept, and this is more enjoyable as a sipper, but it's very easy to drink none the less.","ChadQuest","Nov 28, 2010"

Tastes are of biscuit, some sweetness, a little straw and grass flavors with a bitter hop finish. There is a mild fruityness mid palate. Redemption could use a bit more carb and body.

Flavors of yeast and light apple-pear fruitiness, ending pretty dry and with an assertive herbal, leafy hoppy bite. Drinks like a perfectly balanced Bohemian Pilsener, with the added complexity and fruitiness of a Belgian ale. If I could get this in sixers, I think I would be drinking this all summer.

Taste starts off with a nice citrus pine flavor of mainly grapefruit with a very mild bready tones. I expected much more in terms of yeast somewhere on the tongue. The aftertaste is even of hops but more in the pine department with a hint of sweet butter. I like this beer more because of the lack of yeast in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is a fluffy medium body with a good amount of carbonation. I was very surprised by this beer, in a good way. Seems like a pretty American-ized Belgian beer. Russian River once again proves they know what they're doing, even when it comes to a low abv. brew.","BeerTruth","Sep 27, 2007"

4.64,15.4,4,5,4.5,4,5,"The beer pours a light gold, almost lemony color. There is decent head retention and very good lacing. Pretty impressive looking for a Belgian Blond/Single (style). On the nose this beer is other wordly. Man, the cajones it takes to make a beer that smells like this. I get this incredible smell of honey and saurkraut, with enough funk in the nose to scare me (I'm not a fan of sour beers). However, there was nothing to fear, as this beer on the palate was moderately sweet and quite light on its feet. It's quite delicious and very refreshing. There are some sweet apple and cherry flavors, but they're not at all over done. There's just a hint of bitterness in the finish, and ultimately this is as drinkable a beer as I've ever encountered. A fine effort from Russian River brewing.","John_M","Sep 04, 2007"

It was a hazy golden yellow color with some yeast bits. I poured it slowly as the bottle advised but still got a good sized head. It stuck around for the entire session. Tons of carb and good lacing. The aroma was really good. It was malty and piney with some hops in there. It also had a spiciness that reminded me of a saison. The taste was pretty good but it had a weird taste in the back that left an slightly unpleasant taste on the tongue. It got better at the end when warm but kept this from being great. Shame cause the aroma really had me psyched for this one. Mouthfeel was also hurt by the aftertaste. Overall, a good beer but it just missed the greatness mark for me. Will have to try again when I finally visit the brewery though. (3.5, RB, T, O)","TexIndy","Jul 26, 2007"

It was slightly cloudy because some of the yeast got into the glass, but I like to drink the yeast anyway. The aroma isn't what I expected. It had a good malty body with some woodsy hop aroma. There is also an overall yeasty smell behind everything else. The flavor is fairly sweet but with some hop bitterness to balance. I can actually taste some hops as well. This is a good beer and I was pleasantly surprised.","drseamus","Jul 21, 2007"

Its really a mild astringency, mildly tart. I love the carbonation in the Russian River beers. They are full, yet refreshing. Very drinkable.

The initial taste was a bit of corriander and other spices, herbal and also yeasty with a good backbone of hops to round things out. After a few more sips I picked up some nice fruit notes which also helped to make this beer very well balanced and drinkable. Another winner from Vinnie.

I am a bit afraid that these are not going to last long, they are already incredibly carbonated, much more of it and the bottles are going to start exploding (though I did serve this on the warm side, about 58°F).

Appearance was a real bright gold, but very light looking at the same time. Head was white and lacing was good. After that it was all down hill.
