"O - Excellent beer and will most certainly buy this when I see it. Excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall - A rather poor blond. Definitely not up to par with the others in its class."
""
""
"Very refreshing beer,  can definitely drink more than one in a sitting.   From the bottle.   A very crisp,  light beer that hides what little alcohol is in it well."

"330 ml. bottle.. Pours a clear yellow colour, with a big head. It takes its time to fade and leaves some lace. Smell of apples, caramel and hay. Medium body, easy to drink. Taste of fruits, apples, apricots, candy and some spice. Sure you can have it any time, but it doesn't really offer anything to me. Just a correcto beer."

"Overall - really tasty and was considering a second one despite the outrageous price tag, a given with the Arc de Triumph, sitting prominently in the background, but definitely a good one and something I would buy if I ever saw it at home."
""
"On tap in Paris.  Served in chalice.  Clear golden/ orange appearance.  Head was creamy color.  Nose was fragrant with mild spice, floral.  Taste bread, malt, spice.  Light hop finish.  Mouthfeel smooth, lingering flavor.  Was surprised by refreshing overall experience with this beer."

"O: like a mildly maltier, less sharp-boozy cousin of Delirium Tremens... not quite as full as a Leffe Blond, a bit spicier than that, but otherwise very similar to it... I can't understand why these beers get lumped into the Belgian ""pale ale"" category - they're (blond ales) clearly a distinct subset with very recognizable, idiosyncratic flavors"

"O: a solid Belgian light ale."
"330ml bottle. Tulip glass. Brass color, crystal clear appearance. White froth creates a fairly good retention crown & leaves rings on sides. Citric, malty, yeasty & spiced aromas. Malty, sugary flavors & grape hues at first sip. Light to medium. Moderate to high carbonation. Sparkling & dried mouthfeel. Buttery notes, grapefruit hues & some biscuit in the middle. Sweet/slight bitter finish. Memories of Semi-dry Cava -champagne- on the aftertaste. ABV is well hidden."
""

""

""

"Bottle: Poured a light clear amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with limited retention and light lacing. Aroma of sweet Belgian malt with light peppery yeast notes. Taste is dominated by sweet Belgian style malt with a quite a bit of fructose notes coming through with a peppery yeast note in the finish. Body is light with medium carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Too much fructose notes coming though for my own taste."

"A rather contrived sort of feeling, is what I get around this one - seemingly true to style, but more than a bit too sweet at the same rate. Drinkable, sure, but lacking the integrated complexity of its brethren."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very tasty beer. Went fantastic with steak and green beans. I could easily have had another one and probably another after that - dangerously drinkable. Simple, but well done and tasty."
""
""
""
"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit; at this point, the best new beer I had on the trip. Nice nose full of bananas and smooth and easy to drink. Would have it again."
"Poured clear and brilliant blonde with a white head of creamy foam that stayed well. Bubbles streaming up this one’s a real looker. The foam finally fell to some outrageous thick lace. Nose is light, positively gay with brett, Belgian yeast and some apple. Malt opens up as it warms with a little nut, bread and grain. Slight vinegar smell at first and then floral. Taste is more malt than the nose with plenty of biscuit, bread and caramel beside a tart sour apple. Yeast takes a backseat, there’s a touch of booze and it’s chewy with almost no bitterness. Finishes wet and without much aftertaste except for a very mild slick hop resin on the tongue. Very light and delicate. Goes down very sweet and has a thin body. For some reason it just doesn’t feel like beer."

"Overall – This is a Belgian style blond I rather like. It finishes on the drier side with more triple like characteristics all while maintaining a relatively smooth but warming flavor throughout the taste. Quite tasty."
""
""
""
"O - This is a pleasant, well-made beer. It is not as complex as the best examples of Belgian pales, but it is simple and drinkable while having many of the tastes and aromas you'd expect."
""
""
""
"O - Very nice represent of blond ales,could drink it often."
""

"A decent Belgian Pale. Too many other solid ones out there to give this one much praise."

"Overall: not very special, but there's nothing wrong with this either. I'd expected a bit more bitterness from the description on the bottle, but this is a very run of the mill Belgian blonde."
""
"Overall, I liked it.... However, as much as I enjoyed this brew, it was not what I look for or expect from a Belgian.... Good beer, overall.... Just not by Belgian standards in my eyes."
""
""
"O: Can see why some would like this and some not. Balance of spice, floral and citrus makes for varied opinions. Definitely not a session beer."

"Pours a clear orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, yeast, and some light fruit aromas. There is also a slight mineral aroma that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is much the same (sans minerals) with an alcohol kick on the finish with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is easy to drink but I prefer the taste over the smell on this one."
"Overall: a refreshing and tasty Belgian pale whose character is right up my alley."
"OVERALL- Enough redeeming qualities to interest me in the rest of the brewer's line-up, but won't be revisiting this one any time soon. Reminds me very much of the ""Devil-themed"" Belgian Golden Strong ales, which aside from Duvel and a few US interpretations, I usually don't dig."
""
""

""

"Pours a clear yellow body with a tall white head. Aroma of grain, yeast, grass, mustiness, cereal, florals, and pepper. Flavor of yeast, grass, florals, herbs. The taste was fine, a slight tangy bite with some citrus fruits trying to get out. The mouth drys quickly leaving a metalic, citrus, unbeer-like feel within. A fairly strong alcoholic finish, surprising since its a tap beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear golden with an abundant frothy white head. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The head recedes slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of pale malts, spice, fruit, and faint yeast. It smells grassy. The flavor is malty and sweet with some some spice to help balance the flavor. It has a mild aftertaste that is spicy and sweet. The mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation. It has a crisp, dry finish. It's fairly easy to drink. Overall, this is a solid, unoffensive Belgian pale ale."

"o: a solid belgian pale ale, i like it a bit better than leffe blonde (about equal distribution here in spain). enjoyable, without being overpowering."

"3.5 D: Good beer. I like it."

""
""
"Overall, this is by no means a bad beer, but there is nothing special. It lacks a lot of the complexity that makes for a really great Belgian pale."
"O - Very smooth, excellent drinkability. This is a really good beer that's not too hard to find. The flavors work nicely together to make this an easy and refreshing beer that I try to keep a stock of on hand."

"O: I actually really enjoyed this. This was my first of the style and I thought it was great!"
"O: Certainly not like I remember it. Times change, and I guess so does my palate. Way too sweet and yeasty, which is made all the worse by the thin body. Bummer, dude..."
"Bought in Brussels in 2011. The color is yellow, very clear. Nice white foamy head on top. Typical soapy looking foam head. The aroma is dominated by yeast, not sure I like it. Some fruits, better. Light aroma. I bit disappointing. Taste is fruity with a very dry finish. Warm. Floral notes in the taste too. Taste is ok. A good beer. Nothing to call home for 'tho."
"O - A decent blonde, but in total not much to go for. I am missing floral hops and some extra sweetness."
"It's a pale straw-colored ale with a decent head and very nice lacing. The taste is nice, what you'd expect from a nice Belgian ale. I can't help but thinking, for the price, that Leffe is a better deal, at least for my tastes. Grimbergen is good but Leffe, in my opinion, is just a little better and more inexpensive for this general price range."
"This beer pours a clear, bold, gold color with thin, rapidly fading head. It's aroma is primarily fruity with a hint of pine. The flavor it fruity, with lemon and honey notes with caramel showing through as it warms. Initially it resembles a witbier but has a more complex, malty flavor. It has a medium mouthfeel, smooth and refreshing. Grimbergen Blonde Ale is a good beer, try it with pasta. Recommended!"
"Overall: This is a great Belgian pale ale that can be opened for any occasion as well as any temperature. It definitely is best enjoyed chilled, but as it warms up, its dry, spiced characteristics become more wonderful. It could serve as a great introduction to Belgian beers of this style, and anyone who enjoys good beer will most certainly enjoy this one!"
"O: Very good eye appeal and remarkable mouthfeel."
"This is a very good belgian pale ale. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy belgian's. Highly recommended."
"Anyhow, at $18 a 12 oz six pack, I doubt if I'll give it another shot."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, but not terribly complex in the taste, although not at all boring either."
"O: refreshing and easy to drink. Tame taste but not too bad overall. I am new to the Belgian pale ales but so far I am enjoying the genre."
"O: A great beer. Check it out."
"This is the type of lighter beer people that don’t know about good beer would love. It’s not too heavy but flavorful enough to make you think, “Man, I really am sophisticated.” Because you are sophisticated. You are."
"Overall: This beer is perfect for quenching your thirst. Not spectacular, but one of my favorites from the more commercial blond beers."
"Overall: An enjoyable, but not overly complex BPA."
"O overall, i liked this beer more than i thought i did. i guess that since i knew it was owned by in-bev it would be a less than quality product. this will be a go to in a situation where my options are severely limited. its also something i think ill have success with when i introduce it to non beer drinkers."
"overall - decent beverage, there are better representations of the style out there, though. Try it but dont go out of your way to get it"
"O (D) - Fine beer, tasty. nothing too exciting, nothing offensive. I would drink this again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"It's a bit sugary at the beginning and end, but also includes some nice apple, banana, clove and pepper. Sweetness is the predominant characteristic, with just enough spice and yeast to keep it from getting cloying. That said, the mouthfeel wasn't as full as I would have liked, and could have contributed to taking this from a so-so beer to a genuinely good one."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the interesting blend of flavors. Within this style there can be an overwhelming bitterness, without anything to calm or cut it. Here we found the esters to be a nice vehicle for doing just that. The other aspects of the beer were a bit dull, and stand to be refined to make some of the flavors and aromas more bold and desirable."
"250ml bottle, poured into leffe chalice, half a finger head, golden colour, clear. Yeasty smell, some berries. Tasted of slightly off apples, a lot like leffe blonde but a bit sweeter with a slightly wheaty aftertaste. Some fiz. A decent blond, could drink a few, a blind tasting with leffe blonde would be interesting."
"D - Another ""domestic"" Belgium beer that just doesn't seem to offer traditional style. Even though it was sweet the alcohol was kind of harsh and the citrus really didn't cover up the yeast. Still not so bad."
"Again. Not crazy about it."
"Poured a pale blond with lots of carbonation. Aroma was light and included some yeast, malt, etc. Maybe a little citrusy. Flavor was also light with a taste of belgian yeast. Like Stella but a little more interesting. This was a very drinkable beer, which I could have easily had many of."
"Foam with an attractive fruity aroma. The nose is rather fresh dominates, supported by both bitter citrus and fruity. Fat in the mouth, as unfortunately most pale ales industrial, but with a balance between fruit and the bitterness (although relatively mild) more or less successful. The finish gives it, the orange zest. A beer of its kind, a good positioning in the Leffe AB In-Bev, but it stops there."
"This is highly drinkable, and goes down nicely. The flavour is more involved than many beers, but not overwhelming. Worth seeking out to try."
"very light body, weak flavor, blond yes, a bit yeasty, a bit caramel, and other 'a bits'... just not good enough in my book. Won't drink this again unless it's this or a lager."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Light bodied and lightly carbonated but the carbonation is very lively. It has a bit of a dry finish. Not much of an aftertaste. I think thats the biggest knock is it just disappears from the palate."
" D- This beer has a soapy hop flavor that grows and that is about the only flavor. I didn't get any yeast character or malt flavor unfortunately."
"D: I had this beer about 4 years ago when I was first getting into Belgian Beer. I really thought this beer was amazing at the time. I have of course had many different, phenomenal Belgian ales since then. I had always passed this up when I saw it. For some reason, I started craving it again. Upon revisiting the beer, I still find it enjoyable. When comparing it to some other Belgian Ales, it isn't quite as exciting as I used to think it was. I still like it however. It is a simple, easy drinking, Belgian Ale. I will definitely continue to pick this up from time to time."
"jd"
"Decently drinkable. Simple and easy for an undemanding palate."
"Drinks very easily. Would drink even better with less of an alcohol kick."
"Very impressive beer - especially for the nose."
"The Crack & Glug was nearly religious in terms of its experience, resulting in well over two fingers of thick, foamy, bone-white head with excellent retention. I began to regret not having donned the robes of Bro. Woody of the Order of Disorder as the singing of angels could be heard around me. The head slowly fell like a penitent to its knees, leaving behind a beautiful, sticky lacing that begged to be licked from the sides of the glass (as if I were worthy). The nose had a bready, semi-sweet, musty yeast-driven quality that I had to drag myself away from. After all, beer is meant to be drunk, not inhaled. Mouthfeel was medium with an intense yeast mustiness up front, like putting your tongue on the Guttenberg Bible, followed by a sweet cotton candy-like flavor before giving itself over to a slight grassiness. The finish was semi-dry, not bone-dry, but on its approach with a definite yeast-driven flavor. it was about as good a beer as I have ever had from a CAN. Do they allow coolers in church? Maybe at the Church Brew Works ... I am not taking this to the beach or the mountains, however. This is a beer in a CAN to be savored. Seek it out and remember who turned you onto it. Let us be thankful ..."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into my affligem chalice. Wonderful light golden color with rich white head. Smells o, bananas and fresh bread. Taste is very good; taste the sweetness of bananas, with some mellowing tartness like pears, the belgian yeast, like a crisp spring morn. Mouth feel is light to medium bodied with some bubbles. Drinkability is good; I could make an evening of one or two of these. Time for some fish and chips now, Mate."
"D - Could easily have a couple. Not sure why I haven't come across this until now, but definitely one to revisit."
"A sharpish, clean yeast quality really meats the nose, with tropical fruit behind--banana I believe. I might wish for a bit more going on behind the yeast. On the palate, there is a bit of spiciness accompanying fruit and yeast. Fills up the mouth quite nicely, a fact that is helped along by the lively carbonation and crisp mouthfeel. Basic, but an an easy drinker."
"D- Pretty smooth and clean. Relatively easy to drink. Enjoyable though not extraordinary."
"D: A very drinkable beer. The flavor is sweet but not cloying and doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. If you plan on having more than one or two then this isn't the beer for you because it coats the mouth rather thoroughly."
"Light head of golden-brown, with malty sweet nose of fruit (strawberries?) and vanilla extract with a little spice. Light to medium bodied and a bit sweet with a lemony citrus flavor and hint of clove. Really enjoyable. I could have had a 2nd easily."
"Served in a .33L goblet. Kind of ""off"" tasting light honey brown ale. Tastes like it's turned or spoiled. Light foam film that disappears and leaves no head. Mild fruity candy malt taste but tastes a little off. Wasn't able to finish the goblet and wouldn't want to try it again. Maybe just had a bad pour."
"Drinkability: A decent sweet blonde belgian ale. To call it a Belgian Pale ale describes the appearance only."
"TASTE: Thick, bulbous mouthfeel upfront that gives way. Surprisingly dry throughout with occasionally (spicy) sharpness. In terms of flavor it's a bit one-note, earthy, yeasty? The flavor does stick around for awhile, which is nice but isn't necessarily impressive. A little sweetness develops, drawing out an essence of apples and bananas."
"Drinkability - very good, at 3.99 a six pack this stuff will keep you drinking it all day."
"D- very highly drinkable belgian! clean, crisp, and thirst quenching. drinks like a 5% beer until the barely noticeable alcohol kicks in. glad i picked this one up and i could easily have another."
"pours a golden color with a touch of tan..nice fluffy head that recedes to a very white ring..smell is fruit ,clove and spice..taste is light in fruits and spices with sweet malts and belgian yeast..mouthfeel is medium but not full flavored still a good blonde..tasty and drinkable ..reccomended"
"O: Medium drinkability. Strong Belgium character. Not bad"
"D: The beer is very drinkable; so easy to consume that I could definitely have more than one of these in a sitting."
"The Blonde offers many of the qualities of a trippel without the higher alcohol content, a bit lighter in flavor, too. It's a good start to the evening. I could see having 2-3 of these."
"The artwork is a bit gaudy on this 11.2 fl beer - some sort of hereldic eagle - but not too over the top. The beer pours a thick head, the beer itself a clear straw yellow. The predominant smell is yeast, but with a backing of fruity esters. The first thing you notice is the clouded, muzzy mouthfeel of the beer, thick and silty. It has faint taste of bananas, backed with a carbonated bite. There's a light citrus zip, but the overwhelming silt feeling still dominants. It's hard to drink anymore than a little of this at a time, before it feels like your teeth are being sandblasted - bring plenty of water."
"Taste, lemon, orange, coriander, zippy feel to it. Slight buttery aspect. Mouthfeel throughout leaves no surprises. Extremely expensive for what it is, plenty of similar beers (mothership wit comes to mind) for a lot less $."
"A worthy Belgian Blonde that could be much better if not for a couple flaws."
"Beautiful golden, yellow color with some nice lacing. Fruity, spicy smell. Taste is a nice combination of apple, spice and maybe a little banana thrown in. Mouthfeel--reminds me of a cider for some reason, surprisingly there's a fair amount of carbonation but it works. Overall it's about what I'd expect from a Belgian beer in terms of flavor and the crispness makes this a very drinkable beer."
"D: Very drinkable, nice amount of alcohol, flavor, and feel to it."
"The beer leaves the glass clean from beginning to end."
"Overall, a pretty solid Belgian Blonde. Simple, refreshing, yet it has enough flavor to keep me entertained."
"Had a few of these cold with dinner at a restaurant last night, and while they were enjoyable I must admit that I like this beer better served at 55 so the flavors can really surface as it warms faster. A very drinkable and enjoyable Belgian Blonde that I recommend as I really liked it and enjoyed drinking this beer."
"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers, that this was a reasonably good, moderately priced Belgian alternative for those on a budget."
"D: This is a decent Belgian pale ale, but nothing I would go out of my way to get again."
"easy to drink, great beer. i think i actually enjoyed this more than their dubbel, although that might just be a stylistic preference - the dubbel is very good as well."
"Value: Not a bad blonde, but at $10 per six pack at my shop, I'll choose lots of other beers over this one."
"Overall, I highly enjoyed the flavor but I think their double is better. I would have this again."
"Okay mouthfeel for the style, nothing remarkable but nothing wrong with it either."
"D- This was avery nice beer that I was glad to have gotten the chance to try. It is a easy drinker with it at times going down way to fast. Good beer for people who don't like a ton of hops but at the same time don't like a ton of malt either."
"Taste is slightly sweet of honey citrus and pear, offering a nice carbonation level, helping to provide a nice mouthfeel. Decent drinkability; enjoyable yet not too memorable either. I'll steer towards Affligem Blonde every time."
"D: This is the first of a six pack, and probably my last...at least for tonight. The ABV is slightly above average, so this isn't a session type beer, but it's a nice alternative for the price in comparison to the likes of any other BPA that might be comparable or of better quality. I'd have this one again."
"This was the first beer that got me into drinking belgian beers. A good and inexpensive beer to start off with!"
"Drinkability- Easy to drink, but nothing special."
"D: This isn't the best BPA I've had, but it's a nice beer on its own merits. The light body makes it an easy drinker. A nice pickup."
"Drinkability> Just not my favorite, but not too bad"
"D-Nice drinkability. Smooth with a full, charcteristic-Belgian flavor profile."
"Light malty sweetness, hint of hops, nothing overly bitter, decent carbonation. Good companion for food. Very drinkable. Nearly every café or tavern in Belgium will have this, very likely on tap even. Definitely worth trying."
"The body is light as is the carbonation. The combination makes the feel pretty slick. It's drinkable as a pub standard but is not refreshing."
"I wish this was a tad weaker in the ABV% but it doesn't detract from the taste or experience of this at all. I feel that this is superior to the Abbaye de Leffe and suits this mild fall night perfectly, since the apple and pear flavors fit in nicely with the season and there's no spice or smokiness here like in so many Octoberfest beers. One of the better beers I've had of late."
"D-Refreshing and easy to drink. An inexpensive quality brew that most people can enjoy. This is one of the first Belgian style beers I enjoyed when I was younger."
"Overall, this is a solid blonde beer. It produces a wonderful color, a very agreeable taste, and a great mouthfeel that hides the 6.7% ABV very well. Much better than the Dubbel in my opinion."
"All in all, it's fairly complex if you give it a chance, yet it's not overly rich, which leaves it remarkably quaffable. It offers everything it's supposed to - malt, yeast, and hops - and it's quite nicely rounded and interestingly balanced. Quite enjoyable!"
"T- Very crisp, wheat style beer. Has a very alcoholly after taste. High quality, but very filling. It's definitely worth a shot, but not worth buying a six pack."
"Tastes way too sweet for me, banana's again, malt and as it warmed up even some honey. Kind of a metallic taste too but well, it did come out of a can, and its shelflife was near its end. Not too lifely, borderline flat, the aftertaste was gone rather fast and I can't complain about that, I somehow remembered this being a lot better . Not bad but nothing to recommand to some one trying to get into Belgians."
"Drinkability: All the belgian yeast taste you'd want out of a tripel or Belgian strong pale ale but with lower alcohol making this sessionable. A bit low intensity and complexity but an overall decent Belgian pale thats widely available. Does taste a bit stale and musty when served slightly warmer"
"cheers"
"Overall: A bit boring. It is refreshing and lighter than i would have thought but i expect more from a Belgian Pale Ale in the taste department. Strictly average at best IMO."
"Pours a very clear and bright pilsner-like yellow hue. Great, strong column of bubbles in the center of the glass, thanks to my special Samuel Adams glass. Solid two finger head with some slow receding lacing and a thick film to boot. The aroma is of light toasted malts with a little sweetness. Prairie grass with a little honeysuckle to add a little herbalnote to the scent. The taste has more of the sweet toasted malts and some well indowed candi sugar, but the give off a too metallic twang on the finish. Great carbonation on the palate, but the great carbonation sometimes enhances the metallic twinges on the finish."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Slightly sweet nose. Flavor is slight fruit and malt, semisweet, smooth. $2.25 for a 330ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"The flavors are more subtle and subdued then the smell alludes. A very yeasty flavor and texture is somewhat distracting. Light orange tastes come out behind the yeast. Lighter banana tastes but more clove. On the dryer sides. A nice beer overall, but not as clean as I would have liked to see."
"Carbonation was a little low for a belgian pale, and the body was medium"
"A little body and some light carbonation, but just enough to keep a skim of head on the pint. Nice balance for drinkability. This is good summer beer and a nice representation of the style. Worth a try. Nothing within it is a standout, but no real off flavors. Very very smooth and thirst quenching."
"This beer pouts a clear golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of foam. The aroma is of Belgian malt, and leathery yeast. The taste is more yeasty than the aroma, but the is still a significant amount of malt. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with fine lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice Belgain Pale Ale that I could drink again."
"This is a style I'm creeping into, and this one was available at a nice sixer price. First of all, the bottle and pack holder are nice to look at, so they got my attention over some other newcomers to my beer stop. Pours as you'd expect, blonde, with a nice head which dissipates at a pace you can live with. The bottle tells me that it is fruity and malty, and I agree, as the flavors blend nicely, yet there could be just a touch more fruit to increase gulpability. If this were the case, however, it might leave BPA land and creap up on a dubbel or something else. All in all, this is tasty, and something that I will pickup when I can. In fact I'm going on sixer number 2..."
"This isn't bad, it's certainly a decent blonde, but it's not delicious. Mouthfeel is nice and full, but smooth and not sticky. Exactly what I would expect. Oh, and this is about a 4% taste, no hint of the 6.7%. Good job."
"Although it looks great and tastes nice, the high ABV (for me, anyway) lowers the drinkability. It's one I can drink on occasion, but it would never become a staple beer of choice for me personally."
"When poured, Grimbergen Blond had an impeccable clear, golden yellow color with a thick sudsy white head of foam. Tastes of bready malt, pear like sweetness, tingly spices, mineral water, and a hint of earthy hops. A nicley balanced Blonde Ale that was a very pleasant surprise!"
"This one's very drinkable. An excellent brew."
"OVERALL: I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did. Looked great, felt great, but just the weak nose held it back a little. Definitely a great drinkable Belgian blond. Probably the best of Grimbergen's starndard four offerings. Recommended."
"The taste is nice and similar. It has plenty of grain with bubblegum, raisin, grape juice, wine, hay, and breadcrust, again the same witbier-malt-liquor mix. It's similar to Leffe blonde but a bit drier."
"Pours with a yellow golden color and a large, frothy head that lasts well. Aroma smells clean, but resembles more of a Pale Lager, not a Belgian blond. Flavor is very sweet, fruity, malt liquor-like. Watery texture. It's not like it's Marten low carb, but this beer basically sucks."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. The flavors mixed well and there was no separation of flavors like I sensed with some of the other ""blondes"" I have sampled. I found it very easy to drink with a nice head and flavor. I would definitely rank this near the top of the Blondes that I have tried so far, but certainly not a ""tip top"" blonde. I don't find myself wanted to go back to this beer as much as I do some others."
"A beautiful golden color makes the use of ""blonde"" an understatement. The nose is soft with fruit, equal to but not quite better than other belgian ale. Taste is fruity, stronger malt and light sourness that lingers on the palate but in a good way. There are better examples of belgian ale but overall a very drinkable beer."
"D 4.0 - I like the semi sweet profile, and a fine brew for sure."
"Overall/notes: The foaminess of this covers the overall taste. But I feel like I could drink this one all night because of how light and smooth it is. B/B+"
"12 ounce bottle from Eddie's Liquor right down the street from my house along with the Dubbel, consumed both on 2/4/08, reviewed from notes, poured into my Duvel tulip glass, color is a golden yellow that is pretty pale, 1/4 inch foamy white head that disappears quickly, no lacing, aroma is made up of bready malt, honey, grassy accents, very light hops, and unknown fruits, taste is a lot like the smell in that is has some weird fruit flavors, lots of honey too, was looking for a freshing light Belgian but got a sweet fruit attack, needs some more hops to dry it out some, sweet, slightly dry, and fruity mouthfeel, body is too thick for what it is, pretty much no carbonation, taste did not linger long at all, could not drink too much of this stuff, this serving was fine, heavy for what it is, too sweet overall, probably would not drink again, might be worth trying"
"Pours a clear golden color. 3/4 inch head of a solid white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malts, some tart malt, slight fruit aroma, and some slight hop characteristics. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a very high carbonation level. The high carbonation hinders the drinkability a little. Tastes of sweet malts and tart malt up front. Slight hop bitterness is noticeable, but not hop flavors present. Some fruity qualities are fairly strong throughout the brew. The finish is not dry or overly tart, so that is a big plus. Overall, not a bad brew and worth a try."
"Drinkability: Pretty enjoyable, very similar to some other Belgian Pale's yet this one hits the mark. Not too drawn out, yet not too reserved. Recommended."
"I do enjoy that this comes in a six pack instead of a bomber."
"Pours from an 11.2 fl. oz. bottle no. 1607RL1985A. Sampled on Feb. 7, 2009. It pours a golden tone with a fizzy white head that is about an inch thick that dissolves downward but never fades entirely. The aroma is a bit malty, bready, and yeasty and the fermentation was well sealed into the bottle. Very good mouthfeel. The flavor has the same yeasty and bready taste as the aroma."
"Beer is a dark, golden and light brown color with about a finger of barely off-white head but no lacing to speak of. Smells of sweet malts, clean hops and even some light fruits and honey. Tastes overwhelmingly of sweet and sour apples and honey--almost reminiscent of a cider. A slightly bitter hop shows up in the sip but only briefly. Well-balanced taste, light body and medium carbonation (and lack of intense complexity) make this a very drinkable beer. I really enjoyed the apples, though I was waiting for a different flavor to push through but it never really did! I would recommend this for folks into ciders. This is also a good beer to wash a burger down with!"
"Notes: The palate is really loose and watery, making for a seemingly cheap mouthfeel. Could see this being better right from the bottle. Might retain more carbonation and therefore mouthfeel."
"D: Oh yes. I can just see a abbey full of monks enjoying this out of chalices, and having a great time. This is worth picking up a sixer or two.. This is a great introduction beer for belgian styles, something that isn't so powerful it'll alienate new people to the style."
"Minutes later, it's still there, bouncing about like a mouthful of jellied marbles - one of the better Belgians I've had."
"This is an easily drinkable brew, although it just lacks something which keeps it from being among the elite Belgian blondes."
"Biggs. It smells flowery and yeasty. It reminds me of a few homebrews I botched. It has that same off smell of alcohol and is medicinal in taste. It does have a fruity aftertaste and is refreshing. It looks nice in my free Fat Bastard wine glass I got from a buddy. skip this one."
"D: nice beer with not too high of an alcohol content; good drinking beer"
"D - Very good pale ale, clean and crisp with much drinkablity"
"Overall it is a good Belgian pale ale. I enjoyed drinking the 6 pack."
"Out of a bottle this beer as a bright yellow color with a tremendous off-white head. The retention of the delicate cap was terrific and the lacing prodigious. The aroma was yeasty, and spicy (mustard seed in particular!? odd) with some background of floral hops. The flavors were not as good as the appearance, sadly. It started on a semi-sweet malt note which then faded into a grainy, wheat dryness with some hops behind that. The finish was long and tangy but a little metallic. All rather odd for the style. The body was medium/light, the mouthfeel smooth and semi-creamy and the carbonation perfect. It looked great, felt great and smelled good but the taste just wasn't what I wanted."
"Goes down easily enough. Crisp and refreshing. Seems to be more like a pilsner than a pale."
"D: filling due to rich taste and carbonation, saturizes like a Hefeweizen which makes you drink it slowly, thus I would not have more than three in a row. Otherwise you're full, round and can roll to bed."
"D - This beer is highly drinkable. Definately seems like a good warm to slightly cool weather beer for late spring/early summer or early autumn."
"Pours clear golden with a frothy head that falls quickly. Smell is pleasantly strong, lemony and spicy. The flavor is less robust than the aroma, but still lemony and grainy with a little spicy sourness at the end. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thin and slightly carbonated. A good drinkable Belgian ale."
"Not the most complex stuff but good for a restaurant not known for its beer. An enjoyable gateway offering."
"This beer pours great and looks great, but the rest of the beer isn't up to the same standards."
"another beer that i cant find in ilinois had to get it at one of my favorite beer spies pours a nice golden cider color with a pure white head, smell is very yeasty as it should be nothing beats a wonderful belgian yeast smell. taste is good has a nice balance to it doesnt have a wow factor but still is a good all around beer"
"D: Much better examples of the style out there. There is a reason Duvel is a house hold name."
"This is a blond (with a small brownish hue) beer. It has a discreet and well balanced aroma that is better explored when served in a tulip or oversized wine glass. It's taste is a bit stonger than you would expect, and will leave a sour/metalic aftertaste. It will accompany decently smoked fish or fruit, but will can also enjoy it alone. Although a good beer, I wouldn't have a third in one session, because the ""metalic"" aftertaste becomes irritating after a while. A good beer nevertheless."
"Overall I think this is a good beer and worth the price I paid for it.$1.95 for a bottle.Tasty"
"overall, this is a very enjoyable beer, im glad that i can get it"
"Drinkability is pretty good, nothing too exciting, it goes down very easy, tastes more like a session ale, but has that extra punch of alcohol that can get you in trouble."
"I was pleased with this blonde but I think I like their dubble more."
"D- Pretty good."
"I grabbed this one as an afterthought but it ended up being an enjoyable beer. Clear light orange color with a nice off-white head that did taper down pretty quickly. Some lacing sticks. Aroma is of citrus fruits and some yeast but faint. Pretty easy drinking beer here with some of the lighter fruits coming to mind, orange, mango, banana. Sweet malts, actually the whole thing is a touch too sweet but good. Compared to the Affligem Blonde this was a little sweeter with a touch fuller mouthfeel but still a bit of a bland finish with a very faint sour almost metallic aftertaste. Good beer but not a great one."
"Lightly hoppy in the nose and very attractive in the glass, with a fluffy thin head. Very bright tasting with some straw and lemon, maybe a little honey. Slightly bitter, somewhat malty as it goes down. Nothing distinctive, but not bad. Can't say that it inspires much beyond that."
"Pours a clear golden color with a big two-finger eggshell white head that encompasses huge bubbles and leaves behind nice patchwork lacing. Could have used a little more haziness. Nose is a bit sour, and bit like apples. Taste is similar. Apple spice, slightly sour and tart, followed by some pale malt sweetness, and a dry finish. Good carbonation, medium bodied, and crisp. Just a bit too much sourness for the style. Maybe an old bottle, but not bad enough to drain pour."
"Drinkability: Although this isn't at the peak of the Belgian, it drinks nicely and is more refreshing than many of them"
"D - Pretty easy drinking, partly because it's not exceptionally flavorful. Price is probably comparable to Duvel, not as good though."
"Taste doesn't let down either, I really enjoy this beer. Full and hardy, nuts, dates... feels smooth and creamy, totally satisfied with this beer."
"A fine Belgian blonde. Really easy going, and at 6.7% ABV, quite sessionable as well. I didn't get to drink this for several months after my sister brought it back from Belgium with her last October, but it held up remarkably well. Still strongly carbonated and very fresh. God bless the Belgians."
"Impeccably clear, gold-yellow color with a one finger thick sudsy white head. Smells of sweet sugary malt, banana, clove spice and yeast. Tastes of bready malt, pear-like sweetness, tingly spice, mineral water, and earthy hops. Moutfeel: A rather light-bodied and thin beer with just a slight oiliness that presents itself as it warms. Spice and carbonation seems to lessen after a short while. Very drinkable... Not a punch in the face with flavor but it is satisfying with its timid nature. Satan gold was better... but this is certainly more available."
"Overall this is like a ""tripel light"" if there is such a thing."
"D: This is an easy drinking, approachable Belgian ale, great for a hot summer afternoon."
"Won't last long."
"nothing spectacular"
"Ultimately this beer lacks in complexity, and the sweet tang becomes too cloying and gets tiresome. Nice try..."
"Introduce this to a wine lover,I did and they were amazed."
"The taste is pleasant, and not overly sweet. There is a stern bitterness, but very well balanced. Maybe a little earthy. Not overly carbonated and not too coarse."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into standard pint glass. This is the second Grimbergen I have had and I have yet to be disappointed. Vigorous pour yields one finger snow white head. Minimal head retention with some lacing. Beer is straw colored and crystal clear. Smells of clean belgian yeast with hints of fruits, apple and banana. Taste very clean, slight fruit but not overly fruity, candy sugar compliments the light malt character. Very taste beverage with a clean finish. Beer is highly drinkable, and refreshing, perfect summer brew and at 6.7% it lets you know you are drinking it."
"Poured into a small tulip glass a light golden with a fluffy white head that had decent lasting power,aromas of lemon and toasted grain with some yeasty clove as well.Flavors are pretty yeasty up front with some bubblegum and clove phenolic flavors melding into some citric and toasted tones.Decent but a little to phenolic and yeasty for me still not all bad."
"D: Ok drinkability, a decent presentation overall but really didn't excite me in the process."
"Overall - This is the second Grimbergen product I've had and I'm very pleased with both. I like the Dubbel slightly more because I'm partial to darker beers but this Blonde abbey style ale is definitely a winner. Great as a nightcap or an after-dinner conversation companion. I bought a 6-pack of this on sale for about $8 (usually it's around 11.50 per 6 pack) so this was a steal! Will buy again."
"Overall, quite smooth."
"Not my favrite style of beer but this had a light amber color, clear with a small white fuzzy cap and minimal lace. I picked up an herbal, medicinal hops and wheat bread aroma, a bit sharper than I am drawn to for most beers. It's medium bodied with a nice grape-wheat hops flavor. It has a pleasant background of nutmeg and brown sugar. It's lightly carbonated, smooth and pretty easy drinking. Not bad and definitely worth trying."
"Mouthfeel was light and thin with decent carbonation, and enjoyable. Easy to consume. I would have a few of these in one sitting."
"11.2oz brown bottle from Tiger Town in Gardiner. Pours a beautiful golden yellow translucent body with a good half inch of off-white head. Smells really fruity and pleasant, like a fresh peach or apricot. Tastes very fruity also, with apricot and apple playing huge roles with some malt notes toward the finish. Just the slightest hint of alcohol in the flavor and mouthfeel. Fairly light on the mouthfeel, but makes this surprisingly drinkable for the abv. Really very delicious, one of the best examples of the style I've had. Really hitting the spot tonight."
"a good beer but not outstanding , I would have again if available but I wouldn't go out of my way to get."
"$3 bottles at the Palm Tavern on Kinnickinic in Milwaukee; price was right. Along with $1.50 Huber Bocks at Comet, this has to be one of the better bar bargains in Milwaukee."
"Poured this into a tulip glass and received a strong, foamy one-finger head that stayed with the beer due to constant cabonation. An apple cider colorish body, although you could throw in a little copper to the mix. A good smell made up of a sugary sweetness (something along the lines of caramel or maple syrup) and a dash of yeast and spices. A weetlike taste follows, but the body (thin to medium) is a little too syrupy for me. I don't mind a sweet beer (again, I would say caramel and honey) with a good hop kick on the backbite, but a little sticky/slimey for my likeing. The problem is, if you were to eliminate this syruppy, runny feeling, you either cut some of the sweetness out of the taste or jack the ABV up (both of these solutions only create another problem). A good beer, but I wouldn't session this."
"D-not bad I could have a few whit the limited choices here in my buisness trip to Paris"
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours clear gold with 2 cm foamy off white head that is slowly diminishing. Aromas of orange, spice and yeast are balanced. Initial flavor is mostly citrus. Dry and slightly bitter aftertaste that is moderately lasting. Good lacing, light carbonation, light to medium body, and light hints of alcohol. Drinkable but better available options exist."
"Pale golden in color as it sits in my Duvel tulip. A thin, quickly moving stream of carbonation rises from the center of the bottom towards the top to support the settling chunky head. The head ends up blotchy and thin. The aroma is similar to baltika #3 with a hint of belgian yeast. Sweet sugar with white grape undertones give depth to the pilsner-like characteristics of the beer. The aroma has a good hint of what the taste is like. It is also sweet and grapey with a relatively smooth and thick body. Decent flavor profile, but it tastes a bit cheap IMO. Good hopping toward the end, good balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. It leaves a sticky film in my mouth from the residual sugars. A little more alcohol would cut down on this a bit. Overall, I like this beer. If it is on sale maybe I'd buy a 4-pack. It could also be used to ease a friend into more complex and wilder Belgian blonde/strong ales."
" Body is full and rich, lightly creamy without being foamy. This beer is a pleasure to drink, although it is a bit lacking in the flavor department. With the body and nose it has to offer, I'm slightly disappointed in the mild flavor."
"Light to Medium in Color this beer is easy easy to drink - not to over the top with flavor."
"Duvel still has the angle in this style, in my opinion. The Blonde is good, but I still prefer Grimbergen's Dubbel. A nice representation of the style, so I'll give it its due."
"Pours just a slightly hazed gold with little head that leaves a lot of lacing. Nose is the typical sweetness with a citric edge. Flavor is actually fairly mild. At the start you don't get anything immediate. But after you do get that slight citrus and sweet flavor. Overall though it does not seem to be very substantial. The feel is good. Nice bubble factor on the tongue. Drinkable? Sure. This is a mild and smooth Belgian that is good, but I would prefer to move on to something more uniquely interesting in order to expand my horizons."
"A definite hard-to-find in my area, out of the many liquor stores in my location, only one place had a sixer of this that ran me about $11 bucks... from a 11.2 oz decorated bottle, pours a nice, golden straw color with a minimal head... Smell is very fruity with almost a wheaty essence... some carbonation present... wonderful taste exploding with creaminess... Fruit flavors dominate the palate with a vanilla aftertaste full of spices... Mouthfeel and drinkability are likewise great, and even at 6.7% the alcohol is hard to detect behind a flavorful combination that is amazing... An awesome example of the style which is definitely worth a try... A crisp and refreshing brew which deserves recognition... too bad not more widely available..."
"11.2 oz bottle into tulip glass. A: Only slightly cloudy golden/amber, very light, white head that retains to a caked on film. Decent lacing. S: Candied sugar, caramel, some spice, maybe some citrus and banana. T: Lots of sour fruit up front, very sweet on the finish--like candy corn. A little tropical fruit in there as well. Lots of nice flavors, but a bit too heavy on the sweet fruit. M: Chewy, but not too thick. D: All in all very drinkable. And pretty unique, too. Definitely worth a try, if not two."
"poured into a tulip glass an opaque golden color with a three finger white head with a easy pour. frothy head settles to a half inch cap and holds to the finish with a fine webbing of lace. nice fruity nose. taste is sweet, malty, and fruity nicely balanced. mouthfeel is light to medium and very smooth, carbonation is very good. very enjoyable i'll be looking for more."
"Poured into my Brigand glass. Presented with the color of pale straw. Beautiful frothy white head dissipated into a thin skim with little bubbles adhering to the surface. Consistent thin cascade of belgian lacing throughout the tasting. Strong scent of belgian yeast, hops and a subtle floral aroma. Taste similar to the nose with additional flavor of citrus at the finish. Somewhat lively on the tongue with a pleasant feel of carbonation at the presentation. Left a strange aftertaste at the finish. Not a bad brew, but there are better representations of the style out there."
"tasty but uninspiring"
"D - This beer certainly has its good points, but I can't say I am overly impressed. It is fairly easy drinking, but it is a bit cidery in places. The finish reminds me of a German pils, which is pleasant, but maybe a bit off for the style. Overall it is just a bit bland... kind of a Belgian style Miller lite."
"Review translated from french 5-24-2008."
"d: this is a very well balanced beer w/ great fruity spicy flavors; highly enjoyable and highly drinkable"
"Drinkability - Could be a dnagerous session beer at 6.7%, quenching and esy to consume. A nice starter for those just getting inot the Belgium styles."
"The beer decamps the stubby bottle a slightly beclouded coppery color with a magisterial bright white head that settles slowly, the lace forms a concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose has an apple like fruit aroma, malt and bit of sour dough bread. Front has a tangy sweetness, with the malt adequate, hard apple cider comes to mind and palate, top is medium to light in feel. Finish is desert bone dry; hints of hops and the hard cider last to the very end, not what I expected, not bad, but not that good either, drinkable but a disappointment as I love most all their beers."
"D: It's not as bad as I'm probably making it sound, but there's just not enough of what I like for me to get past the spice. It's ok, but..."
"Overall: very nice abbey beer. Well balanced and highly enjoyable. Looking forward for another one."
"D - Excellent. I will definitely buy again. I was awed by Grimbergen Double over a year ago. I saw the blonde and had to buy it. I love it too. I will no seek out more from Brouwerij Alken-Maes."
"I know the importers characterize this as a ""starter Belgian."" I think they are right on and this would be a great beer to have someone try who is attempting to get into better beers."
"D: Very easy to drink, especially on a warm day or with a meal. Given the alc content, it really goes down incredibly soft and smooth."
"Drinkability: It would be easy to down several of these in an evening. They aren't filling, and the flavor is enticing enough to attract you to drink some more."
"D: Medium. Tasty for the style, but I can't drink a lot of spicy blonde ales."
"Particularly good value for the price. At $10 for a six-pack, it's a tremendous bargain. A good couple bucks less than Affligem for a relatively comparable experience."
"Pours with a very pretty dark gold color with fairly little head and strangely perfect clarity for the style. The aroma is light, with some pale grain notes in the background and bright, apple juice and yeast on the top. Light, uncomplex, but pleasant. On the palate there's a flash of fruit at first, before a yeast note rises to prominence. Things finish fresh with a dose of acidity. Mouthfeel is light, even for the style, with fresh acidity and carbonation that fills the mouth but doesn't overwhelm. Overall, this is quite a nice little Belgian blonde. It's a bit light and insubstantial compared to some heavies of the genre, but for its price and intended purpose it's great."
"Taste is a continue of the smell, a Belgian fruitiness with anise, clove, caraway and coriander notes. Also some fusel alcohols and a minor oxidation. The beer is dominated by this spiciness and although there is some malt presence, this is pushed away by the spices. To me this beer reminds me of the terrible Leffe blond and to me this tastes like an exact copy of it."
"Above-average pale with lots of initial head on cloudy yellow, some lace, basic yeasty and wheat aroma. Medium mouthfeel, drying aftertaste. Yeast, a tad of fruit in the bannana characteristic. Cloves dominant spice, also salt and white pepper. Not very complex. A pale than a tripel."
"This is a nice beer which I would recommend with light food, such as a salad or sandwich, or on it's own on a hot day. It's was in the upper 80's in NYC today and this definitely hit the spot."
"The image of Michael Jackson is giving me a toast, with a backdrop of gold, with a head that can best be described as ice-creamy. Smell is crisp, Belgian, spicey, and somewhat reminiscent of sour fruit. It's this sour fruit character that overwhelms the taste buds, especially on the aftertaste. Sure as hell ain't bad though. Mouthfeel is bubbly and pillowy, and drinkability remains significant."
"Poured this ale into a Chimay chalice which presented a 1/2 finger head and had some lacing but not like a typical tripel style blonde. This beer is also the cleanest I've seen out of this style, perfectly clear. I do pick up sweet candy and bread in this aroma. There is quite a bit of sweet fruit in the taste, bananas with some lemon citrus. It has good mouthfeel, seems chewy about halfway through. However, this beer is quite filling, which will keep the drinkability lower than some. Not complaining though, but all in all it is a decent beer."
"Grimbergen Blonde is an odd beer. The label informs me that the Norbertine monks have been brewing it since the Middle Ages and that the recipe has been 'carefully guarded throughout the centuries'. After drinking this bottle, I can't imagine that anyone was interested in stealing it."
"As far as Belgian abbey style ales of the blond variety go, this is just wonderful stuff. The beer is medium bodied, and chock full of chewy spices, malts, banana/citrus flavors, perhaps a bit of coriander, and lots of candied sugars in the fermentation process. I just love this beer and it is just a great representation of the style. If you are into the style, you must stop in here for a taste. The head, retention, smell, and mouthfeel are all just great. This one won't disappoint. L'Chaim."
"A lot of the pleasant flavors I usually associate with belgian ales, but not so heavy or filling, a better summer brew although still not suited to be a session beer."
"Pours with a huge white head that dissipates quickly leaving lots of lacing. It is a light orange hue. It smells spicy and of sweet fruits. Tastes of sweet fruits, banana and finishes very clean. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and very carbonated. It is refreshing and the taste was fairly good so it was pretty easy to drink."
"looks nice and smells nice. not a bad start. pick up some slight fruit notes, almost a slight bananna bread flavor. definitly a little clove. kind of a saison-like funk in the aftertaste. really nice though. one of the more sessionable belgians i've tried, not offensive in anyway. i guess i'd just prefer something a little more kicked up, but to each his own. very good beer, would definitly try again."
"Perhaps a nice transition to the bigger pale Belgian ales, but the wow factor of a Duvel might be a better tactic."
"Very nice appearance - clear golden color, nice columns of bubbles, big white head. Smell is yeasty with a little grass, clove, and citrus - excellent aroma. This is a delicious beer. Very dry finish and very refreshing. I'm really impressed, especially given the very reasonable price. I'll be buying this all summer."
"First Grimbergen beer and a great start. Pours a nice golden color with good thick head that decipated for the most part but did stick around for the remainder of the glass with slight traces of lace. Smell has a sour, hoppy sense to it, unique to my nose. Taste is great, malty (but very well balanced) with fruit tones to it as well. Somewhat creamy feel to the beverage in part due to the lower carbonation. This beer hides the fact well that its a 6.7% brew. Overall this is a great beer, very drinkable and recommended!"
"DA: I'm very impressed with this one, i always love the CLEAN feel you get from Belgian ale's especially if there's a good complexity of flavor like this one has...not exactly a session beer 6.7% but a six paxk is not too much to put down with say one other person who will enjoy this brew too."
"This one pours like a macro-lager; very strange, really. Minor head disappears quickly. Nose is better; some sweet fruitiness and a touch of wheat. Taste is excellent. Actually not particularly complex, but full of flavor. Wheat, cloves, some apple and fruit too. Feel is medium bodied, tasty, good carbonation. I don't know, I have a weak spot for Belgian Pales; the flavor just blows me away, so I have a hard time being objective about these. Very tasty one that I'll try again, although I honestly can't say if it's better or worse than other Belgian Pales (I've only tried the Leffe Blonde, which I also thought was excellent)."
"BH."
"Pours a golden yellow into my pint glass with a huge white head that takes a few minutes to dissapate. The taste is simple and classic, nothing too fancy-and nothing too surprising. The body is light and a little too easy going. It finishes refreshing and light with not too much aftertaste. It's easy to put away a sixer of these, but costly."
"While its a very good beer, it certainly has not bumped my favorite Belgian's down the list any... worth a try but not really earth shattering. Nice in that the ABV is somewhat low when compared to, say, a Strong Golden Ale or similiar."
"The flavor isn't quite how I remember it tasting at the Raleigh beer fest (2 weeks ago). Some lackluster wheat, pear and citrus round it out. The blonde is well carbonated and crisp with a light body. Not much of an aftertaste, but that's not much of a downside for the style as it helps the drinkability. Overall this thing is good, but just not in the same ballpark as the Grimbergen Double (one of my favs)."
"Enticing aroma of the Belgium yeast and sugar cane, followed by a sweet malty start, finishing dry and acetic. What a nice Belgium session beer  even at 6.7%"
"Poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The beer was sour smelling with a big pretty head and actually had great lacing. A slightly smoky flavour made the beer taste interesting at first but then started tasting a little sour to me and after drinking a Grimbergen sour as heck double ale before this one might have been the problem, but I just don't think I like these beers. Will not buy again."
"Not a particularly inspiring beer, but it's a nice Belgian pale ale. It lacks some of the interesting funky-ness of similar beers, but it's still solid and I'd have it again (the affordable price sure doesn't hurt either)."
"The flavor doesn't necessarily blow me away, but the overall experience of this beer just about does. The drinkability is insane. Flavorful but not heavy, with a sensible ABV, it goes down in a completely agreeable way. People who got turned onto Belgians via Duvel and who still love Duvel are advised to fall in love with this one. But with all the comparisons to Duvel, don't get me wrong, Grimbergen Blonde is its own beer, less crisp and dry than Duvel, and probably sweeter and slightly funkier. Great stuff."
"Into a pint glass, pours a lovely goldenrod with a slight amber in it, lovely white head that leave lacing in rings, streaks, and spider-webbing. The aroma is nicely sweet, yeasty and spicy in that peculiar Belgian fashion, and just a zip of zest. The taste is also just fine, sweet but turning dry (almost tart or sour even) in a flash, lots of spices, white pepper, coriander, clove, yeast, bit of fruits, citrus, sweet, pretty nice. The mouth had a good body, but too distractingly carbonated, a little too dry for me, and just doesn't give a good finish. Its a bummer too, cause I've always liked this beer, its just lost its favor for me. But, in all, a good beer."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer and it is really clean and easy to drink. I like how it glides across the palate and finishes really refreshing. I could drink this beer very regularly if it were available in Texas and was affordable. As it is, I will drink it when I get the chance."
"Poured an almost clear golden color, with a medium white head that left some rocky lacing. The smell is not particularly strong, has a bit of a peppery, Belgian yeast smell. The taste is not very bold but is distinctly Belgian. Has the Belgian yeast taste, a bit peppery and sweet. It's on the light side for a Belgian, almost crisp, but goes down easy. This is a very nice light Belgian, one you can drink lots of. Definitely a step above Stella for all those wanting to move up in the Belgian world."
"There was an astringent spicy flavor not uncommon with Belgian blondes; cloves and coriander, combined with a definitive banana flavor shaped most of this beer's taste. There's a musky, warm alcohol finish to the beer. Mouthfeel was clean (perhaps a bit too much), and this is a drinkable Belgian. Not bad, but not the best I've had for the style. But I'd certainly have it again."
"Would make a good session beer."
"Sampled off tap, rather enjoyed the full pint. A solid inch and half of head, off white that sat over a hazed golden body. Aroma yeasty with spices coming through quite present. A smooth, flowing mouthfeel. Flavours are gentle, roll off the tongue nicely. Spices and peppery notes, slight ester. Nothing much in the means of complexion but my impression was a good one. Tasty. Easy to enjoy."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquor, Tucson AZ"
"Mouthfeel is about right for a Belgian Pale, a good job here, and the beer is very drinkable. Would be ideal on a hot summer afternoon, but is every bit as quaffable on the autumnal equinox."
"Poured a lovely golden color with dominating white puffy head. Superior lacing from a head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is tripel-like, with strong notes of bananas, candy sugan and yeast. Taste follows through on the taste with bananas and other fruits present. Finish is somewhat ordinary, with the taste rapidly disappearing from the mouth. A good, easy drinking beer, but nothing spectactular."
"D: Yeah, I could drink this. It's kind of straddling a line between a blonde and a wit, and I'm not exactly sure how to rate it. It's not true to either style, obviously, but that doesn't mean it's not tasty. If I had another one in the house, I'd drink it, but I don't."
"Not sure I would buy this beer since I'm not a huge fan of the style, but if offered one again, I'd go for it. Belgians like these tend to go much better with some cheese or some food than all alone."
"Flavour of complex malts, candy sweetness, with a touch of tartness too. Alcohol evident. Lingering malt flavours, some wild character again. Light bitterness."
"A refreshing easy drinking ale. A good summer party brew as would probably be enjoyed by the masses."
"Kind of ho-hum. Its a pricey beer, and i expected more."
"Nice foamy white head that disapears slightly leaving little lacing. Strong malty/hoppy smell. Great taste.Sweet with slightly bitter aftertaste. Wonderfull mouthfeel. Strong enough alcohol to notice some warmth. The main downside is price which isnt extremely high but like Duvel makes it not an every day beer."
"Body is medium, slick, and slippery with a fluffy texture and smooth mouthfeel. Nice to see for 10 bucks and change at my local Lowes."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Solid egg-white head, rather frothy, a little more than a 1/2 inch thick. Quality lacing lasts the entire beer. Color is a clear oranginsh gold. Mild bubbling. Smell is slightly sour like some wheats can be with some honey/malt sweetness added. Taste is mildly sweet with definate orange peel flavor. A little bit of spiciness in the back. Mouthfeel is juicey with a crisp carbonation. This was a good deal, I'll definately be stocking up on these while I can."
"This slightly hazy golden ale initially gushes from the bottle, but calms down pretty quickly and is generally well-behaved as I pour it into my glass. The carbonation dissipates and the beer almost goes flat. The aroma is very herbal and accented by lemon. This beer has some very pleasant citrus flavors and a sugary sweet character to it that is well-balanced by bitter hops. A tasty, drinkable Belgian ale."
"Poured into a Trappist Westvletren glass. Pours with a nice, full and chunky head that leaves heaps of lacing. Smells sweet, like candy. And fruity and fresh. The taste is sweet, too. And If I have any complaints, it's that it's a bit too sweet. The relatively low alcohol is well hidden, and this is one tasty and drinkable brew."
"Very drinkable as it has a relatively low alcohol content and with such a clean finish it makes a good beer to begin a session."
"Last night, I had three and by the third, I was becoming bored of it. So, I had one today to review it. Overall, it's pretty good, but - IMO - there are better Belgian ales out there, for about the same price, and just as easily - or even moreso - accessible - that are just as good - if not better. Nothing special enough to seek out more than once in a while, but nothing to turn down, either."
"Drinkability- pretty light only hindered by the fizz"
"This is a real bargain at $1.99 per bottle in Columbus."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Poured into a tulip glass producing a one finger head that produced great lacing throughout the duration of the drink. A fruity aroma of apples, cirtus and alcohol. Taste is delightful! Mouthfeel is full of carbonation. Taste is sweet and crisp much like the smell. This is my first time trying this wonderful brew and I will surely get it again."
"Overall, this is a nice brew, but not one I will go out of my way to pick up again. Since it tastes more like a wheat beer, I would prefer a Hoegaarden or a Weihenstephaner Hefe to this."
"Pours a clear golden color with a frothy, white head. Smells pretty much like apple juice with a slight yeasty background. Smells good but not very interesting. Taste is, at first, nutty and fruity malts with a slight alcohol edge. Slowly, the hops come through around the middle, with a swelling bitterness and spicy and grassy flavor character. Finishes slightly dry with a lingering malt flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-light with lively bubbles. Drinkable, but not interesting enough for me to want a whole lot more of it."
"Overall a nice drinkable blonde ale. I recommend this one."
"Drinkability- Quite a quaffable brew. If it just had a bit of oumph behind it. Taste doesn't last as long as I would like. Still very good though."
"Very interesting. Smooth, medium bodied and easy to drink. Definitely worth a try."
"I was at an ""Irish"" pub, in France, with an Italian, a Brit (who only drank Vodka), a Frenchie, and two other Americans. They spelled the pub's name ""O'Brian's"" not ""O'Brien's."" And it had Guiness logos everywhere, but no Guiness. A truely strange expericence, but a good beer."
"An OK beer but not remarkable in anyway. Think of this as a Duvel knock off that isn't nearly as good. But this isn't a bad beer just rather boring and unremarkable for the style."
"It's a fairly drinkable beer but I don't know that I'd sit and drink it all night."
"Overall, this is ok. I am enjoying it, but i dont think i will have a craving for it in the future."
"I probably won't buy this ale...but my girlfriend will....and I'll drink some of hers !"
"This beer is very easy to drink. If the alcohol was lower Id call this a Belgian session beer but, I cant. There is too much booze in it. So, when do I drink this beer again? It is not as good as Rare Vos or Orval (duh! What is!). I never heard of this beer before I seen a few bottles in Lawrence, KS. I am happy I picked up a sample but I doubt if Ill drink it again. Overall, it is a solid Belgian Pale Ale there is a thin line between good and boring with this beer style. I need more to be impressed."
"I order two 83 oz giraffes (because Im so stressed from the anti-Americanism and dog crap). I sit down and set about consuming the brew but it's different. I taste apples, nasty, rotten fermented apples. That is all. That is all that is going on in this beer. It is terrible. My friends and I finish our nasty brew and leave. All of us come down with a horrible case of that stuff thats all over the sidewalks. I wont be revisiting this one anytime soon."
"Tastes very nice. Good sweetness, not too strong. Very sugary, a bit too sticky. Not much spice, but generous malt variety makes up for that. Mouthfeel is tough, especially at first - big sharp bubbles. Beer is a bit too sticky here too. Drinkability is good. Not overloaded on alcohol and a good but mild taste make this one a winner."
"I had drank Grimbergen before and wasn't keen on it. Figured I'd give it another try, and glad I did. This Blonde is exceptional. Very light and floral on the nose, no hint of alcohol, and packs a good punch in the Belgian style. Very yeasty, fruity taste on the palate, great mouthfeel and extremely well balanced flavor. A crowd pleaser."
"Tasted this beer again in a day and I must say that I do appreciate it's taste a bit more now. I think that I'll probably buy it again buy it wouldn't be until I've tried many other types of beer first, that takes priority. For me this isn't one of those beers that just gives me the impression of ""Wow can't wait to have this again!"""
"Nice brew at a nice price. $4 at Sean Bolans in Baltimore. Blondes (the beer, not the girls) have never been my favorite style but this one is pleasent and very drinkable. Candied sugar abounds in the aroma. Crisp, slightly sweet taste with a little bit of hops and a nice dry finish. Good carbonation. Very drinkable, would make a good session beer except for the ABV which is on the higher side."
"I put off purchasing this one for quite some time, due to the cost, $10 a 6-pack. Thinking on it, it's much cheaper by volume than other Belgian ales, but considering the middling quality, you also get what you pay for. 72 ounces of this passable pale for $10 vs $8 -12 for 25 ounces of far Superior brew? That's the choice we have to make sometimes, but I believe, when on a budget, I'll choose this one again."
"Overall, I like it. Good light tasty beer with depth. But it has some issues with overdoing the lightness and introducing some substandard/weird flavors."
"A pretty good beer, but some small flaws. Opens up bright straw in color, with a loosely knit and well laced head. Smells honey and fruity sweet with some spice, sourness and hop aromas. Tastes sweet of lemons, oranges, pineapples, and to a lesser extent, mangos and apricots. Cidery or apple flavors come through with the alcohol. Body is a bit flatter than I like in a Belgian Pale ale--carbonation may be too high. Spices and co2 numbs the palate, leaving a slightly grainy texture and flavor. Estery hops and alcohol gives off some clove-like and pepper-like flavors. Finishes a bit powdery or chalky, but still light. All in all, a good beer, but there are better Belgian Pale Ales out there."
"D = A bit pricey. Better beers for less money."
"Pours dark golden amber with a rich foamy head, two fingers, good retention. Lacing creates rims in my glass as I drink, very nice. Nose consists of malts, yeasts, citrus, and a good amount of spice (coriander at least). Taste is very good, what a summer Belgian ale should taste like with a good balance of malts and wheats along with not too sour yeasts, citrus, and good spice flavor (usually the spice isnt spicy enough). Smooth, crisp, and refreshing. A solid beer."
"Drinkability: not a bad offering and is fairly good value in the store. Was surprised to see it on the shelf (Molloys off-licence, Dublin), but I would prefer to pay more for a better beer."
"Overall, a really good Belgian Pale. I would definitely have it again."
"A clean golden pale yellow beer. Has a big fluffy bright white head and a good brussels lace. The aroma is lightly sweet with a strong apple character with hints of orange peel and spices. In the taste the apple character melts to a honey note on the sides of your tongue. Towards the end there is a nice spicey hop snap before the return of that light candy sweetness on the finish."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Pours a beautiful amber-orange. Small head develops then drops to a lingering film that leaves sparse lace. Smell is nicely balanced with orange, banana, spice and malt notes present. Taste is more of the same, orange, banana, spice and malt with hops showing up around the edges at first and increasing with the temperature. Fairly smooth with a hint of a hop bite. Medium-full body with a fairly light finish. Very drinkable with a good balance a decent complexity overall."
"Pretty good brew. Pours pale gold, with a thick and foamy head. The aroma is sweet and syrupy. The flavor is all in the malts. There is honey and syrup. A bouquet of flower hops towards the back end of the flavor. The mouthfeel is slightly high on the carbonation, but not in a bad way. Very full-bodied beer, but in a soft way. Very smooth and easy drinking, this beer does not pound the palate and it is very simple to drink a couple of these."
"Nose is old and muffy with lots of koreander and partly oxidised malts. Taste is not that fresh either, hanging bitterness however not that disturbing cause low dosed. Fruity sournotes cause of coreander and maybe the ascorbic acid. Unfresh, tasted it more often but skip it if its not for a blind tasting...."
"Not overly complex and definitely not an ass kicker, but still a nice beer. I think I even like this one better than the dubbel."
"Poured a clear yellow color, think white head that quickly dissipated. Fairly pleasant odor, a little yeasty. The taste was fairly light, lacking much complexity, and didn't linger too long on the palate. Other than a touch of bitterness on the palate, the flavor quickly disappeared. Not a terrible Belgian, but definitely not in the upper tier (and definitely not worth the $11.99 I paid for the six-pack!!!)."
"The smell was a fairly good combination of light malts and citrus tones. The taste was a bit lighter than expected, with those same flavors present. The mouthfeel was definitely too light. This beer just needs more substance."
"Feel is weakened and thinnish, borderline watery with only a small nudge of dryness, fruityness, and carbonation which gathers a bit of strength as it gets past mid way and developes more but decreases again in the finish. This is an appoachable brew but lacks a bit of ompff and character; I think I'll skip it over in future buying sprees."
"Overall a solid beer that I would have again."
"Poured out a golden color with a ultra fluffy, filmy head that just stuck to the glass. There was solid and constant bottom carbonation. The aroma is very reminiscent of a belgian wit with heavy wheat tones. I can pick up a little clove as well. The taste is pretty solid with a tart beginning and a crisp finish. The semi-high ABV is nicely hidden but noticed when it warms your stomach. This is a very nice anytime beer at a resonable price!"
"11.2 ounce bottle, nice label, with an eagle and sort of stained glass looking. Pours clear, light and golden. Not much head, lower carbonation, tiny bubble film light and wispy lacing. Nose is pineapple and some yeast. Notes of bublegum, more pineapple, lemony and fairly refreshing. Would go great with a warm waether salad. Ffairly light bodied and a tad thin. Less complex then the top notch pales also lower in alcohol. Less interesting then hoped for, still a tasty and pleasant drink."
"Clear (I was expecting bottle conditioned) darker yellow with a nice head of 1/2 of an inch. Laces well, spidery with good cling though. Aroma is lightly astringent, unripe pineapple with some yeast and lime. Flavor starts decently full, adequate body and carbonation, with sense of esters, some sugary sweetness, and citrus fruit. The brew loses an impression of more sturdy malts about halfway through the mouth and settles into an overly sourish quality, with a loss of texture at the close. Somewhat quaffable but it loses its drinkability at the finish, not settling great with me at the end."
"Akin to a Tripel-Weissbier cross. Too bad that bottom fell out. I liked this quite a bit up front."
"50cl can: This beer has a dark golden color to it, with maybe a hint of orange. There is a strong white head. There is a somewhat sweet aroma, with hints of yeast and spices. The taste is along the same lines. A bit of citrus also. It is a bit more than medium bodied. Comperable to Leffe."
"The taste is enjoyable, fruity and sweet, with grapefruits getting more present in the end. Very citric, zests of lemon. Wheat is fairly noticeable too. I had problems to define the aftertaste that's kind of spicy (pepper?). After reading other reviews, I have to agree to a certain extent with the winy apple flavor that one person mentioned. I thought this took off from the beer's drinkability, but the way the hops appear in the beer is still interesting: the bitterness is enveloped in a fruity wave. The mouthfeel is very round and smooth. A good cheap beer here in France."
"I was expecting a lot out of this beer and it just about lived up to my expectations. Pours a light yellow color with a moderate head and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is not too strong, but it has a spicy and wheaty feel. The flavor is very smooth and has hints of pepper and a strong wheat character. I enjoyed this beer."
"Somewhat disappointing for the style and for the taste."
"The taste in itself is very soft and the predominance within is of the wheat which gives off a weiss-like base for the sweeter brew which in turn has no nasty aftertaste or many hops to it either. its nice though, but not top notch."
"A very solid Abbey Blond. Light in body with traditional characteristics and very good drinkability. Best served at cellar temperature. This brew appears filtered. I wonder what it would be like bottle-conditioned? Drinking it here in the States takes me back to Europe. Damn, they've got it good over there!"
