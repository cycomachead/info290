Aromas of toasted grains, subtle banana sweetness, nutmeg and clove spices, bready notes, and a subtle butterscotch sweetness. Flavors are fairly smooth and balanced, with a rich and sweet caramel and butterscotch blend forward, laced with light clove and nutmeg spices, toasted notes, hints of Belgian yeast esters and funk, and some sweet banana characteristics. The body is mid-range, but the carbonation keeps it crisp and slightly dry. The aftertaste is more of the roast and banana characteristics. Smooth, dry, somewhat crisp finish.

Taste is all of the above and pleasantly refreshing. Very easy to drink down and not overly yeasty either. Bell's did a good job with this one...","tastybeer","Jan 25, 2015"

Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like pears, cloves, and some wheat/bready malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some apricot and white grapes noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Overall it's an OK beer, but there's nothing about this that would make me want to buy it again.  I expect better from Bell's, but this was just pretty meh.

The palate opens with a dry, crisp, snappy cracker malt character and a wonderfully complementary hop flavor and bitterness, a blend of earth, lemons and green grass. The mid palate has some of the yeast expression, spicy and mildly phenolic. Drying and crisp on the finish, this beer is light in body, highly carbonated and has lingering flavors of crackers, earth, lemon and a little floral character.

Specifically how clean and crisp the beer tasted.  It also did not have the traditional Belgian yeast flavor that I expected. I can see how if you were going in expecting a more traditional Belgian this beer would be a disappointment, but for me it was the opposite.

Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, light banana, wheat, bread, cracker, pepper, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and light earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, wheat, bread, cracker, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%.

3.32,-5.4,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Taste/feel: Medium feel with a moderate/low carbonation. The taste is much like the smell. Faintness all-around with clove being at the forefront with a little bit of banana, and then a little bit of corn-like adjunct flavor. Finishes clean, but overall ""bleh."" It tastes rather light (as I'd expect given the ABV) and isn't at all blowing me away like I thought these Planet Series beers would -- Mars did, but both this and Venus have been let downs. Anyway, the taste is light with no real intensity, it's just loaded with subtly. That's not normally a bad thing, but this is just a ""meh"" beer that's the very definitely of decent. Not only did I expect something fantastic from Bell's, I anticipated something pretty much earth shattering, since it's the Planet Series. I could deal with Venus being one of those adventurous beers that couldn't quite make it, but this is just a ho-hum Belgian Pale Ale that I paid $3 for just because of the label. Oh well. Like Venus, I know not to buy it again. This series is turning out to be a disappointment so far. I think this beer (and probably Venus as well) would score lower had they not been Bell's Planet Series beers. This beer should've just been called ""Bell's Mediocrity.""","Alextricity","Dec 19, 2014"

3.61,2.8,3.5,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours yellowish golden with a slight white head that quickly recedes. Some coating on side of glass remains. Aroma offers some strong cereal grain sweetness, herbal tones from some hops, and spice from the Belgian yeast. Flavor is reminiscent of the aroma but the grains tend to dominate a little more in flavor, expected though given its low abv. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, I enjoyed this one a good deal and easily my favorite of the Planet Series releases so far. Would be a really nice session ale if priced more affordably. Offer this in six packs at $10 or less and I'd be a happy customer. Current price point will keep me away from buying this one again though and I did dock points from it in overall due to affordability.","denver10","Dec 17, 2014"

The mass produced Leffe blonde is much better than this. I love Bell's, but this beer is a joke compared to what they can do. I think Bell's is exploiting the marketability of the Planet Series with this one. What a shame.","yannimou","Dec 13, 2014"
