Pours hazy gold with a thin white head that produces good lace. On the palate, citrus and melon, rich malts, over ripe fruit and moderate bitterness with long lingering slightly bittered malt after tastes. medium high carbonation, medium full body.","pat61","Mar 14, 2015"

Color was an oh-so-slightly-hazy golden-yellow (SRM = 4) and it should be of no surprise to anyone that Midas, Mammon and Croesus were champing at the bit to try some. The nose had a yeasty mustiness to it that created a cheesy, slightly flowery/perfume-like scent. Mouthfeel was slightly full, thanks to a huge effervescence. The taste was slightly sweet, absolutely driven by the yeast, kind of fruity, kind of perfume-y. The bottle mentioned spice, but it was difficult to parse where the spice began and the yeast ended. Was the addition of spice a case of gilding the lily? Overall, it was a decent beer, but it was not mind blowing. The finish was semi-dry and I was again wondering whether this was a by-product of the yeast, the spice or both.","woodychandler","Beers"

Citrus aromas. Lemons, oranges, and passion fruit. Crisp mouthfeel. Full citrus nose with oranges and lemons. Some wheat and barley. Good crisp mouthfeel. Not too dry, not too wet. Just right. Passion fruit, kiwi, and wheat mid-palate. Lager hops subtle but solid in the background. Creamy orange juice and grass on the back palate. A little more hops. Grains of passion and Belgian yeast. Aftertaste is clean and crisp. Lingering lemon drops and Skittles. Malt and citrus. Insanely well balanced for a Belgian fruit beer. Most of the breweries try to overdo the fruit notes making it into girly drinks or liquid candy. Headaches in a bottle if you will. But this is a more serious Saisson varietal homage. A true session farm beer. Very well done. Still a beer and highly drinkable. 3.6 out of 5. Very good.","digitalflood","0"

Taste is sweet malt with lots of dough and caramel and hops follow the nose all the way. Bubblegum, floral, banana, sweetly juicy with orange and lemon citrus that isn’t sour or tart, and a little pepper to take it into a sweet finish . No real aftertaste, very light body, almost thin with a little carbonation to gently remind you this is beer. Pretty nice.","utopiajane","Jun 09, 2013"

The liquid is a shimmeringly bright yellow, fully transparent, only a few bubble beads but these are highly active. Very expressive nose of banana, strawberry, apple fruit, clove and cinnamon, bubblegum and all kinds of general yeastiness, undercurrent of powdered milk chocolate, here too it is pure and unblemished, preferring a spring to its step than grounding itself firmly. Light to medium-bodied, fluid with a sort of metallic ring to it at first which makes the attack somewhat bitter. The carbonation churns steadily and agitates more than let’s the underlying creaminess take hold. White pepper and lemon peel beat the clove, nutmeg, allspice to the punch. Eventually turns more resinous in feel which brings out more yellow apple, peach, banana, melon fruit. That cocoa maltiness persists. A lot going on retronasally. Lower yeast presence, more unbaked dough than bread or scone, etc. and certainly outpaced by the grassy nip. Overall, it’s pleasing to quaff, guileless and simple to the verge of innocence. You’d lose interest after a couple of dates.","farrago","Mar 03, 2013"

The name liquid gold comes from the color of the beer though it's not a clear beer. It is translucent but cloudy. On the nose you smell aromas of raisins, sweetness, & a hint of honey. Our first taste does not disappoint us with its complexity. A very malty flavor with a hint of bitterness that is very subdued but helps clear the sweetness. The beer is substantial but not full-bodied. A very good drinking beer.","angelogarcia3","Nov 28, 2011"

What I could detect was rather wheat-beerish: some cloves and bananas, maybe some lemons. Decent light-amber color, too. Very nice taste, with spicy oranges and other citrus ambling arm-in-arm with light bananas and some hay. Lemons came to the fore, especially in the aftertaste. Lightly carbonated with zing, not sting. This was a nice find on the AAH list, and I would definitely have another. Of the American BPAs I've had, this was by far the most drinkable: not overly bitter or ham-fistedly hopped, but nicely balanced and quite drinkable.","gfreed","Apr 23, 2010"

A whisper of some herbal/grassy hops. The taste has some residual sugar but is mostly composed of prominent yeast character contributing this prominent spiciness and floral component over some graininess. A nice moderate level of carbonation hits the tongue and creates a certain crispness to this brew.

The aroma is pleasant clove and light lemon bread. Nothing real provoking, suggesting a Belgian style. The flavor brings a strong herbal hop married to heavy clove. This is a pretty heavy constitution, spicey, tangy with a dry hop finish at the tip of the tongue. Just a slight overtone of bubblegum that gives way to biscuit wheat grain goodness. Fairly drinkable depending upon your partiality for the style.

3.61,-5.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,5,4.5,"Edit: Going up & down with every batch, the jug I had before last(February) was exceptionally juicy & mildly carbonated, while this recent tasting(April) was much bigger in the hop department & similar in acidity to my original review. A 4.3 & 3.65 if I wanted to jot down some ratings here.","PEBKAC","Sep 06, 2007"
2.51,-34.3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,"Poured from a growler that was acquired by a good friend a couple of days before sampling. Slightly phenolic aromas mixed in with soft malt aromas, light carbonation kicked up a whisper of foam when poured. Super light color reminiscent of a massed produced german lager. Up front clove and cinnamon flavors dominated which were overtaken by biscuity malt flavor on the backend and cleaned out by hop dryness. Didn't get any belgian aspects to the alcohol flavors except phenolics - no fruity esters or spicy alcohol which makes me wonder if a belgian yeast strain was used at all. Not very drinkable to me due to the phenolic character dominating the flavor profile.","Longstaff","Sep 01, 2007"

4.45,16.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"M/D- this is the first time I have actually really felt that a belgian could be a response to a pils...Although heavier in the body than a pils. This is a great beer, and for the alcohol (although not too high) very light.","jameaterblues","Jul 01, 2007"

4.2,9.9,4,4,4,5,4.5,"Not sure why, but I mistook this for CL's tripel at first. The body was thick enough, though the flavor was a little mellow for a big abv beer. I guess that makes a good belgian pale with some body to it. The flavor was subtle and the kind that went on far through the aftertaste. The aroma was Hennepin-like with funky barnyard aromas and grassy hops. The taste started with a clean, sweet candi flavor, followed by a complex mix of spice, make that hot spice, with some pale grains coming through at the end. Finishing with a nice lingering bitterness. This is a well-made beer. Go forth and drink it.","tempest","May 23, 2007"

4.47,17,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very impressed with the Captain, as usual. I have had this one multiple times so it is quite nice to sit down a review it and still be amazed. These Belgian Pale Ales / Golden Ales are a real favorite of mine and this stands up ....","gpcollen1","Nov 02, 2006"

4.27,11.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4" white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head recedes at a moderate pace, never really goes away, with a heavy coating of white lace. Aroma is light of sweet and spicy, not overdone, just right. Taste follows the nose, finding a nicely balanced road through the center of the Belgian-style pale neighborhood. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent, very smooth, and one of the most drinkable of the style that I have experienced.","ppoitras","Aug 24, 2006"

4.3,12.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Fresh growler, picked up at the brewery today. Pours light golden almost clear with a slight but long lasting tiny bubble white head, leaves minor splotchy lacing after a vigorous swirl. Nose is of limes, pepper and Belgian yeast. This is an easy drinking, Belgian single/golden inspired ale. Notes of more citrus, especially lime, quinine and pepper. Crisp and refreshing, packs a punch at 6%. Moderate hops till a subtle dryness arrives in the finish. A delicate, complex, and well crafted ale from the newest player in the NY craft beer scene. Looking foward to trying other styles from Capt. L.!","Billolick","0"
