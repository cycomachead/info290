"Yeah, that's a nice one."

"This one was another great beer from La Trappe, an excellent offering with a very good balance that made it an easy beer to drink with a nice, crisp finish and plenty of carbonation; a good beer and one that I'll not be afraid to pick up again."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18A). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 08:59 K17D14. AROMA: sweet and spicy aroma background with some orange notes. some perfumy and honey-like alcohol aromas. APPEARANCE: intense gold color and translucent but with deposit that may give a very hazy appearance. good moussy white head with good retention and lacing. TASTE: smooth flavours with light notes of sweetness, esters (orange like) and spicy alcohols. medium-low bitterness with a medium-sweet finish. no hop flavours noticeable. PALATE: medium-low body with high carbonation. smooth alcohol warmth. OVERALL: an average exemple of a classic belgian blond ale (altough La Trappe is brewed in the Netherlands)."

"Very nice blond beer / pale ale. Good character and body."

"O: More or less a clone of Val Dieu blonde or a number of other Belgian blonde ales, it’s nice and has no unique features, but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing."

"O: An agreeable blonde with a sophisticated aroma but questionable texture and average taste."

"On-tap. La Trappe Tasting chalice glass. Bright golden color, clear appearance. White froth, close crown showing modest retention. Aromas of Belgian yeast, pale malts & floral notes, hints of bread, slight citric, alcohol, nectar & hops to the nose. Gentle & crispy upfront displays delicate citric, spiced & brown sugar flavors rounded by fruity touches. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Dense texture, light spicy & sparkling palate. Low hoppiness & phenolic hues in the middle. Sweet/soft bitter finish lingers into the aftertaste. Easy drinkable & refreshing despite of being a real Belgish Blond one."

"Overall, pretty decent. But there are so many examples better than this, and some examples that are significantly better. Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed."
"O: It's nice but fairly plain."

"Very good, refreshing beer and easily drinkable."

"Medium bodied with delicate carbonation.  Really crisp with a spicy, floral hop bite up front that lingers over the pale malts and estery yeast notes into a slightly dry finish.  Bready/biscuity with some apple, pear, raisin and grape.  Subtle spice presence.  Well balanced, light, refreshing and easy to drink.  "

"Overall: such a nice drinking Belgian ale. Top marks."
"Simple but attractive and rewarding."
""
"Food match: Tastes of brassiere food would go well with this."
""

""
""
"O/D - Carbonation makes it hard to taste much. Nott a bad blonde, but nothing really special."
""
""
"Not a real pronounced smell to this. Taste is somewhat wheaty spicy and sour pear. Mouthfeel is medium bodied fairly carbonated. Overall a decent strong blonde ale but not my top Trappiste or blonde."
""
"All round balance, it keeps steady character and persistent pace throughout the drinking journey. This is something I can savor all night long. Maybe simple is the best."
"O- while this is not my favorite blond, it is a very good example. I would definitely drink this one again."
""
""
"Quite an easy drinking style but not a lot happening flavour wise."
"This is a good brew. It has plenty of flavor and can be drank in large quantities."

"O: 4.5"

"O: For beeing a Trappist beer, not very exciting. But for a standard Belgian Pale Ale, not too shabby."
"A decent blond ale that is good on tap, but not really a Trappist recipe that stands out like others. I hope to try other beers from this brewery in the future, and with luck, even find them on tap. I have this feeling that this beer is better on tap as it brings out a more desired sweetness, but I definitely wouldn't revisit it any time soon – especially if the bottled versions aren't bottle conditioned. Worth a try, as it still manages to be a modest beer for what it is."
"Carbonation is perfect, I think, and it feels good. It's a good beer overall, and mostly pleasant, but I'm not keen on the metallic bit. Liked the Orval better."
"O: Probably my least favorite Trappist beer thus far. Nothing about it really impressed me, but it wasn't bad. For the price, I have no problem with it, but would probably opt for something else though."
"M: It is a pleasant sensation, maybe could be a little more complex because of some bitterness that doesn't exists it good and follows the style."
"Poured from .33cl bottle into snifter glass. Pours a mild hazy light orange body with some sediments and a medium lasting fluffy white head. Aroma is citrus, spice, grapefruit, yeast and mild sweet grapes. Lightly sweet flavors, low bitterness and a distinct yeasty flavor. Earthy notes and picking up a little ""cork"" flavor throughout - not too pleasant for me. This gives a mild citrus and hay finish with a lasting orange and almost pepper-spicy aftertaste. Body is medium, medium carbonation and has a oily to sticky mouthfeeling."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its aroma. We found, here, inclusions of wheat and sweetening esters, which helped raise it from a standard, or dull beer, in this category. The taste, however, did fall a bit flat. It began nicely, but by the end of the sip, and even more so by the end of the glass, the taste became metallic and capable of overwhelming the palate."
"D - pretty fresh and very easy going down the throat.. be careful about the higher ABV"
"Body is not as strong as I thought, in the mouth is just as the smell: spices, clove, fruty, honey and some bread. Good beer, but I expected to be more complex."
"D - Probabbly my least favourite trappist beer this one."
"If you want this ""style"" of Trappistbeer that´s lighter, Westmalles trappist (dubbel or tripel) is more complex."
"Berkel Enschot in the south of Holland where the monastery is is a good place to visit."
"Just easy drinkable."
"D- Doesnt look the part neither smells or tastes it to be honest. Didnt enjoy this one really boring with no character/flavour/complexity. Pass."
"This is easily my favourite of the La Trappe primary four. A delight to drink and the soothing honey flavour grows on you very quickly - something you could genuinely expect Trappist monks to enjoy as one of their lighter beers."
"Good quality Trappist beer. Not a Rochefort or a Westvleteren but even though, worthy."
"*= ideas from fellow taster"
"Aroma is pale malt sweetnes with suggary notes, honeyish alcohol and peachy, citrusy esters. Aromatics include also banana and bubble gum. Flavor is pale malt sweetness with slight alcohol warmth and mild spiciness towards the medium-dry finish. Esters add a tinge of citrus-like fruitiness to the overall sweet flavor. Medium-light bodied and quite smooth, with moderate carbonation. (330 ml, freshness date August 2012, into tulip.)"
"D-- Strength is the mouthfeel. Quite nice how the taste lingers. Smell is faint but mouthfeel makes up for that. Very sessionable at 6.5% and cost wise it is quite reasonable. A 4 pack in Australia is almost half of what a 4 pack of others like it. Very much worth trying."
"Taste is rather complex - fruits & yeast with strong malt ending, a hint of hop, middle carbonation, noble & refreshing beer!"
"Not nearly as sweet in the taste as in the aroma, but still thereabouts. Bit of candied sugar and a very light yeastiness; not very complex and pretty straightforward with the light fruitiness...back to the white grapes, and perhaps a hint of passion fruit. Hops are AWOL, and the MF is very light verging on thin with subdued carbonation, but still syrpupy somehow. Not really great drinking, not as refreshing as hoped and certainly on the sweeter side for the style. Not my favorite from the brewery."
"This is remarkably similar to a hefe. Really refreshing."
"D - Good drinkability, just as expected of this blond beer."
"A good beer and worth a try but it's not divine."
"Overall a decent beer although it didn't feel like a blonde beer."
"M&D - Light to medium body with a nice mellow carbonation. I found this very easy to drink and light on the palette. It went very well with the salad and fish we had for dinner."
"drinkability it goes down well"
"This is a drinkable beer but it lacks the punchy flavours and complexity of many Belgian and Trappist beers diminishing its appeal."
"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a pair of basic snifters. Shared with brothercannon. The ale appears a hazed muted straw yellow color with about an inch of fluffy, fading off white head. Nose and flavor consist of grassy biter hops, light candi sugar, fruity, sweet buttery candy, slightly spicy yeast. Decent mouthfeel, about medium, and the ale is amply carbonated as well. Their quad is quite good, this one, not so much."
"Arguably the weakest brand of the Trappist group, it isn't necessarily a bad beer by any stretch, just a little unispired when compared to it's colleagues. This beer fulfills it's label promise of being a trappist blonde. A good bright orange with a healthy head. A sweet yeasty and familiar nose. Follows on palate with a sticky (not-too)sweet, slightly warming mouth-feel. A little awkward in the finish but still very drinkable. A decent beer that is just unfortunately out of it's league with the other trappists."
"Not as good as La Trappe Dubbel, but still worth trying. I would choose this over a Leffe Blond due to its lower level of sweetness."
"Pours a golden clear yellow, slightly fizzy. Good sized head, diminishing, foamy. Sweet floral aroma, some dark fruit, typical Belgian ale aroma. Thick syrupy initial taste, light taste, fizzy & slightly bitter aftertaste, with some fruit sweetness on the end. Very floral taste. Decent, but a little plainish."
"M&D: very light in carbonation, medium-bodied, slightly weird in flavour and not very drinkable due to the sickly-sugary sweetness that disturbs the balance. My previous notes of the On-Tap version seems to be much better, and the only thing I can think of blaming for this bottle is perhaps the expiry-date issue. I don't mind trying the bottled version again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Refreshing beer, good example of the style."
"It was a very easy ale for sure...although I found it lacking something - just not enough bite to invite me back again...needed a little more body & complexity."
"Overall - Falls a little short of the best BPAs."
"Thanks to RomanW70 for the opportunity to try this one. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a cloudy amber from a caged/corked bottle. Off-white head left behind some light, sticky lacing during the tasting. Scents of green apple, pear and alcohol. Taste consistent with nose but flavor profile, combined with mouthfeel, made this brew seem closer to a lightly carbonated aperitif/cordial, than a beer. Mildly effervescent mouthfeel fell somewhere between light- and medium-bodied. Finish was more dry than sweet. Drinkability is fair, but this one is not for everyday consumption; well worth a try though, in my opinion."
"Excellent all-around brew... As one of the Trappist Beers, this is definitely world-class stuff... top-notch with a superb appearance... cloudy, hazy, with a foamy, frothy head with some staying power... smell is complete with bright, fresh fruits and a sweet, caramel taste that bursts through and truly satisfies... slight carbonation visible behind a warming palate of floral, sweet, candied goodness... goes down as smooth as water with excellent mouthfeel and easy drinkability for a 6.5% ABV... no alcohol detected at all... light, cotton-candy flavor with a wonderful aftertaste... no bitterness present... all sugar and sweet malts... Defintely recommended..."
"D: Light and drinkable."
"belle couleur ambrée tirant sur le orangée pale, la mousse blanche et mince disparait très rapidement, nez d'épices agréable, la bouche est épicée, piquante, très longue et bonne. j'aime le petit coté agressant en bouche."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: For a Belgian Pale Ale this is definitely fuller in mouthfeel than I expected. Almost velvet-like, very nice. Alcohol is somewhat detectable, felt a bit of warmth as I was taking as sip, just there in the aftertaste, where vanilla reigns. Would've liked something a bit more crisp and not quite so full in body. Usually I'd get off on a full body, but that coupled with lower carbonation just makes this low alcohol, sweet, and very unbalanced(as it should be-BPA, I mean supposed to be malty) ale not all that great in the mouth, a bit more carbonation would be nice as well. This is definitely one of the more unique Belgian Pale Ales I've had. I must say that this is one that I don't prefer over the others I've had. Though I am most likely comparing this brew to the likes of Duvel, it should still have a similar, yet toned down flavor...I just think that the almost cloying vanilla makes it hard to drink more than one of these in a sitting. All in all in my opinion this one is too cloying, I mean I got this with a gift set which included a goblet, goblets are for deep sips...I try that with this and almost gag because I find it too cloying. I'll most likely not purchase this brew again."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a deep orangish gold color with a minimum of bubbly head that fades away rather quickly. Smells very floral and yeasty and sweet, not bad at all. Tastes very sweet as well, some fruitiness. a little passionfruit, a little apple/pear as well. The mouthfeel is very heavy, and also tingly on the tongue. Finishes very dry. Overall, it's a very drinkable belgian. Not the best belgian blond I've had, but not the worst either."
"Recommended. A nice Belgian blond."
"Pours with an airy off white head. A clear but dark body, an unattractive hazed bronze colour. A simple aroma - yeast and Belgian malts. Some suggestion of spice and a slight cider like component. The alcohol, though not outright is suggested in both aroma and flavour. The mouthfeel is damp and quenching. A heavy malt base with very low bitterness. The flavour mimics the aroma - Belgian style yeast and bready malt bill. Distant hints of fruits (peach, apricot) and a little bubblegum taste as well as slight zesty note that last in the aftertaste. This is simple and quite forgettable in all regards, but it quickly grew on me..."
"bottle corked and caged. poured medium honey with a off white smooth head that some nice lacing. aroma nice light fruits come out nicely with the hops and malts taking a close second, some sourness. nice full mouth feel smooth, a little syrupy Flavor floral oranges, malt, and some yeast spices like cloves and weak cinnamon. after coming in from mowing the grass in 80 degree s this was a nice refreshing beer to have."
"On the whole this is fairly bland when considering other trappist beers. Not a patch on the dubbel from La Trappe. Bit underwhelmed by this."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. A slighty hazy copper color with an average off white head that left some spotty lacing on the side. The smell is almost non-existent. Disappointing for a trappist. The taste is similar to that of fizzy apple juice, not much in the way of Belgian spiciness/funkiness. The feel is light and crisp but not watery, finishes very dry for the style. A decent drinker but not any better than Leffe. Worth a try but won't seek out again."
"Sadly, I have to report this is the worst Trappist beer I have ever had, and I've had almost them all. I have another which I will stash away, but this is not what I wanted, or expected."
"Poured more of a dark pale than a blonde with a nice head that left lacing on the side of the glass. Right when I cracked open the bottle I got a hint of caramel but that left leaving a spicey sweet smell. Tastes like sweet apple juice slightly spiced with cloves, then the cloves take over and the beer finishes bitter. Not very full, this feels thin after the first rush of sweetness. A hint of alcohol in the back that warms, but is thinner than expected. Really, this beer was a let down. I love their quad but this is just so/so. I'd drink it again if given to me but I wouldn't go hunting for it."
"Pours darker than expected, less blond than amber, although on the light side of that. Frothy white head that leaves nice, chunky lacing on the sides of the glass. Very phenolic aroma with tons of banana notes and cloves. The palate is very sweet, too much so really, and features a creamy clove flavor that is a bit off-putting. A substantial bitter edge comes up at the finish and saves things somewhat, but overall this beer is just average for a Belgian blond -- it has little in the way of fresh fruit aromatics, the mouthfeel is too thick and heavy, but it's not terrible or anything. Just enh."
"($4.99 / 25.4 oz. tall brown wine-like bottle, corked, and caged)"
"Drinkability: Solidly drinkable, good hoppiness."
"Taste is bitter and malty, with some stickiness which is moderate. The light caramalt gives the beer more body and mouthfeel is a little too thick for me. I also am not fond of this light caramalt taste. The bitterness is strange, rather a pilsener-like bitterness, not very hoppy or resinous, just straight forward bitter."
"O: Great beer, with a reasonably high ABV for a Blonde/BPA."
"This beer, poured from its criminal 30cl eurobottle, creates about 2 cm of head. Mostly small bubbles but some large ones. This slowly disappears into a thin, persistent layer with still some large bubbles still in it. It wants to be cold, served from the fridge it's at its best. The color is a nice clear amber, with lots of bubbles rising. Strangely enough these fail to make an impression in my mouth. There is not much smell, nor taste. It slightly resembles Weizenbier. The relatively low ABV (6.5%) makes the alcohol almost unnoticable. In its style a nice, unassuming beer."
"I recommend to skip this in favor of the Tripel."
"I do not taste the sweetness everyone else is talking about, rather a more upfront robust taste in the middle of the tongue. There is, however, a lot of effervescing going on both in the glass but especially in the tongue. The first sips are a little ""off-putting"" but like most beers as you become accustomed to the taste it becomes a little too easy to swallow :)"
"Koningshoeven Blond pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Aroma is somewhat fruity, sort of grape like. Taste seems to start with a candy sugar type flavor then some fruit like tastes, as above kick in. Interesting, but not really my thing. Definitely worth a try though."
"Overall - A good pale ale.... Maybe a little lacking in something but still worth a try..."
"Drinkability: Probably not the best Trappist beer, but I still found it quite enjoyable. Not bad for my first Trappist beer."
"taste is sweeter than expected from the aroma. medium-high carbonation with a light mouthfeel. honey sweetness with a cleansing, slightly tart, slightly bitter finish. drinkable, but i'd prefer a little more strength and flavor with a little less drinkability."
"Fair, but I expect more from Trappist Breweries. has good spicy ann citrusy tones in the aroma and flavor. Light malty sweetness/ perhapse some honey added for a soft character. Alcohols hinge on fusal, but remain sweet. A hint of graininess / huskiness show up in the finish where the hop bitterness should be. Otherwise a good beer, though there are far better Belgian Pale Ales out there."
"It isn't my favorite blond, but it's interesting and mellow, which makes for an enjoyable sip."
"Small bottle from a gift set box, which included the nice glass I'm sampling from.No freshness indication. Pours clear (until the final yeasty pour) light honey golden amber, raising a regal almost white head, slowly dissolving to a spotty foam, moderate stringy and spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is of cloves,ripe fruits. Very pleasant BPA, notes of more cloves, vanilla, light brandy, maybe bubble gum, Belgian yeastyness. Fine everyday type Belgian. Love the style, great when you want something Belgian, but dont to be knocked on your behind after one beer. Well worth a try."
"Bottle: Poured a deep golden/orangey color ale with a huge foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of floral malt with candy-like sweetness, which is very enjoyable and reminiscent of the other beer from this brewery. Taste is also dominated by the candy-like sweetness and big malt. This beer does the same thing that Christophel did for me for Pilsner if you see what I mean."
"This brew pours a clear golden orange color with a one-finger creamy white head. The aroma is rather large. Orange peel, citrus fruits, grapes. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than medium bodied, dry, and smooth. Overall, this is a very drinkable brew."
"The taste starts out on the same path as the nose, but that's as far as it goes. Malt starts out but peters out rather fast followed by biting carbonation, a ghost of lemon zest. The yeast flavors are pleasant but not enough to bring this one back on course. The mouth, however, suffers from the carbonation. A bit harsh. If I were drinking in this style or even price range all night, I would order something else for the next round."
"Is this beer drinkable? Yes. Highly enjoyable? Not so much. Flavor is lacking and somewhat disappointing. So many better beers of this or a similar style are out there. Not bad, but no where near great."
"Notes: I got this at Wegmans Liquor and they store select bottled beers in a special wine display which is sideways. It looks good and I'm impressed they would bother, but this is not optimial storage for many corked brews. For example, the cork broke as I was trying to remove it from the bottle. Not cool. I had to resort to a wine opener to finish the job. Another time I got St. Bernardus Abt 12 and once I took the cage off I the cork popped. Again, not cool."
"Nothing to scoff at."
"Mouth feel is nice, a liiiittle watery. Very drinkable. An overall tasty beer."
"Drinkability - tasty stuff at a tasty price."
"Sure, this beer is drinkable but equally forgettable. I know this beer will get overlooked in my mental Belgian Beer Rolodex, there are much better beers then this one. I probably wouldve passed on this beer but the 750ml was on sale in Parkville, MO for $3.00! Good deal. Worth a try."
"Taste is fruity but very carbonic unfortunately, some banana flavours, acetylic too. Not very great"
"Overall a decent brew. Nothing special but OK."
"Pours a good-looking golden color with a rocky tan head. Smells of sour grapes and cherries, slight lemon, molasses and brown sugar. Tastes like dark fruit, with a distinct lemon peel flavor towards the end. A little more hop bitterness than I expected. Finish is slightly sweet and fairly clean. Mouthfeel is not quite as good as is expected for a Belgian: a little on the thin side. Drinkability is a little above average, because this is not that complex of a beer. Not a bad Belgian, a good middle-of-the-road beer."
"taste can best be described as a young version of the triple. crisp and fruity, as expected, with banana subtleties. upset i never tried this before- would love to try it in a 750. drinkable, a good session beer."
"I really need a girlfriend..."
"Very enjoyable to sip. I like this one better than the dubbel or tripel."
"Pours with a nice, tiny-bubbled head, which is expected from the style, slow to disipate. Smells of fruit, kind of like pear, nice aroma. Tastes crisp, even taste some pear or apple, with a nice hoppy bitter finish. Very nice mouth feel and very drinkable, although drinking too much might knock you on your butt."
""
"Taste is very smooth and not overpowering. Spicy in the beginning and sweet and tangy in the end. No real alcohol notes are apparent. Kind of reminds me of a weak triple. Very easy to drink just lacking a bit in flavor. I would try this beer again."
"Another stellar product from this brewery. Great aroma from yeast. Fruity peach and secondary citrus taste, easy drink. Good 1st or 2nd beer. A great pale. Hoppy too. Honey malt and nice malt and yeast aftertaste. Opaque orange, alcohol creeps up on you."
"IMHO: No brouhaha here. I am partial to Belgian beer, but this one is not very remarkable and poorly balanced."
"This one comes out of a gift set, including 4 beers plus a nice goblet with the brewery logo. This beer pours a hearty golden color with a finger of head that falls to cover the beer with an eighth of an inch of foam. The nose is lemony-orange with a nice sweet malty background. The flavor is nice and sweet, with minimal carbonation to get in the way of the malt. There is a bit of an orange undertone in this as well wih a slight hint of a hop in the finish. The aftertaste is really pleasant. There is a nice sweetness that lingers and entices me to drink more. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth; a moderately thick beer that is easy drinking. Overall, I like the beer. I'm anxious to try the other 3 I have from this brewery."
"There's a small, almost white, fizzy head leaving runny spots of lacing. The beer is a hazy orange-gold. Nose is faintly fruity (almost apples) with a little caramel. The front is syrupy caramel, but not too sweet. A very malty middle turns bitter to finish; alcholic, very bready and tangy dry. It's a good Belgian blonde. Solid, tasty."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a huge, thick head that sticks around for a while. The aroma was fruity and citric with some maltiness. Extremely smooth flavor - surprising for a Trappist. I see most reviews are poor for this beer, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I agree that it doesn't totally fit the Trappist style nor is it strong enough or yeasty enough for the blonde style, but I found this surprisingly smooth and enjoyable to drink."
"I suspect I got an old bottle, some of whose carbonation may have been lost after being stored upright too long. I've had the blond ale in years past, and I remember enjoying it more than this. Or perhaps the recipe has changed. Disappointing."
"I've had the complete set now and this was my least favorite. Past the appearance there was a lack of character that was present in the other three Koningshoven's."
"This one starts off sharp, but mellows by midsip to reveal an herbal/fruity bouquet on the tongue. The flavors never really come together though. While this is not a bad beer, it is not what I have come to expect from the Trappist Monks."
"Very nice."
"The taste is very smooth - highly drinkable. There is a fine compliment of bitters and semi-sweet flavors. It is not a very heavy or thick beer, and it goes down easily. The taste reminds me of a sour malt and a sweet hay."
"I found the smell very winy, with grapes and maybe some other red fruits. The taste is very citric, still with this winy aspect. Wood too. I wouldn't have thought about honey unless I hadn't read it in the description of the beer on the label. The beer is also pretty floral, maybe with a hint of liquorice. The hops are powerful but elegant and not overwhelming, very controlled. The persistence of the head contribute to the smooth mouthfeel. The slight iodated aspect of the beer makes it refreshing, but I don't think I could enjoy several of these in a row. probably one of the least interesting beer among the trappists."
"Sampled 12/31/03"
"A decent beer, but not impressive as I remember the LaTrappe. Drinkability is hampered by it's syrupy sweet mouthfeel, heavy-handedness and off-alcohols. Lightening and cleaning this up a bit and it would be a winner, but not a very good representative of a Trappist Blonde."
"It is a slight orange gold color with a soft head. The aroma is fruity and yeasty. It is slightly sweet with some fruitiness and a spicy finish. There is some winey notes and tastes of orange zest as well. It is complex, but lacks a certain depth that many Belgian Abbey beers possess."
"Koningshoeven version. Pours hazy golden color with some brownish-orange highlights. Frothy beige head that's sticking around for a while. Good lacing and adherence to the side of the La Trappe snifter. Toasty malt and candi sugar aroma and bit of mustiness in the nose, too. A bit on the higher ABV side for a blond. Malty profile that's a bit nutty and diacetyl-like. Finishes a bit carbonated and lingering alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich for a blond, in my opinion; but nonetheless good. Overall, a solid beer. Because of it's richness for a blond, I can't say I could drink many back-to-back."
"An amber pour with slight clouiness and a small white head that slowly fades down to a mere ring. The nose lightly malty with a touch of raw sugar. The taste is semi sweet and slightly bitter and the caramel finish lingers nicely and quite long. The mouthfeel is lively and medium bodies. Overall, there are better blondes and therefore the drinkability isn't ranked very high."
"The nose is fruity and malty and this sense follows in the flavor. The flavor is quite strong and gives a sweet malt sense that is quite fruity and full of banana. The feel is clean and full. Very satisfying and drinkable."
"Sadly the finish is flat."
"Picked it up as part of a four pack sampler. Here's hopin' some of the next three are a little more interesting."
"I think I got suckered in by the packaging here. Large brown bottle with champagne style cork --- as if I'm not going to finish this in one sitting... Although I must say I've learned that this is the perfect amount of beer for me on a weeknight to get a good grasp of the brew and form an opinion. The color was deep golden, slightly cloudy. Poured with a nice off white head that held up for most of the glass and created a nice lace down the side. The smell was sweet, almost sticky with an appricot overtone. The taste was pleasant and understated but a bit too fruity for my taste. The mouthfeel was a bit heavy, but not overbearing. I thought this was decent but I'm not too familiar with the Belgian style (hope to be someday) and I don't think I would drink more than one of these 1.9 liter bottles --- also, a little expensive in my opinion."
"Upon pouring from the bottle a golden amber color with a nice modest sized head that is bright white in color, creamy in texture and the residual lace a diaphanous sheet to cover the glass. Nose is citrus crisp with nice malt sweetness, lightly floral, refreshing and pleasing to the senses, start is malt laden, somewhat sweet, top middling in feel. The acidic finish is astringent, the hops bountiful but not overpowering, droughty slightly tart aftertaste last long after the swallow. A quite nice Blond, as this is not a favorite style with me, but this one does hit the spot."
"This is a very pleasant tasting ale. Poured out a slightly hazed golden color with one of the most attractive heads of foam I can remember. Huge, rocky, dense and creamy. The aroma was slightly sticky sweet with candy sugar with some fruitiness. Taste was lightly sweet and sour, with some yeast. There was no hiding the alcohol in this beer  it came right through. On the whole, this was a very enjoyable and light Belgium ale."
"Fruity aroma.This beer poured a big, creamy long lasting head.This beer left a good lacing on the sides of my glass.The body was cloudy with an amber hue.The nose of this beer was fruity.I found this beer to have a smooth, sweet and fruity taste to it.It didn't taste bitter or have an overwhelmig aftertaste to it.I would drink this brew again."
"Carefully poured, this blonde delivers a clear amber body with yellow-gold highlights. It's a little bit darker than might be expected; but its frothy off-white head holds rather well and leaves some nice lace before settling to a creamy 1/4"" head. A sweetish, candy and honey-like malt resides in the nose - very mead-like in a way. It's not complex, but it is clean and nice. The body is medium/light; and it's gently zesty on the tongue before warming to become just lightly creamy with a very fine, median carbonation. The semi-rich honeyish malt dominates the flavor throughout, balanced by a solid bitterness and a light wash of alcohol; and it finishes dry with a mild note of fruity malt that lingers in the mouth. A nice beer that's straightforward and enjoyable although the alcoholtends to come forward a bit too much at times."
"Not the most complex or best example of style, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"This brew has a fruity floral aroma. It poured a nice long lasting head of small and medium white bubbles that left a good lacing. Its body is a nice cloudy amber brown color. Initial taste caught me off guard but later settled into something nice. Nice drinkable brew with a mellow subtle flavor."
"Pours a very pleasant coppery gold color. The head was light and short lived. The nose is exceptionally sweet and spiced malt with hop notes. The flavor is moderately dry malt and lightly hopped. There is some really unique spice notes here that are very difficult to identify. The taste is clean and the mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. Very good Belgian here  Try it  I highly recommend this one"
"Is this different somehow than the ""old"" La Trappe Blond? Seems quite a bit worse than the alter-ego, from what I recall."
"Poured a bright golden color and was very high in carbonation, with a very large head. The aroma is very light and pleasant, mildly spiced and citrusy. The taste also was very soft and smooth, a tiny hint of malt sweetness on the front with a crisper finish. Both the aroma and the taste did seem a little cidery, very reminiscent of my first attempt at homebrewing. The head was around for the whole glass, and left a lot of lacing. This was my first trappist ale, and I was surpised. I had expected something a little stronger, a little sweeter - basically something just a little bit ""out there"" compared to what I am used to. So unfortunately I can't comment on whether this suits the style, however, the rating it currently has seems to state that it is not the best representation of a trappist ale, however I did enjoy it nonetheless."
"Drinkability/notes: I found this to be a pleasant and inoffensive beer, which I would characterize as Trappist Light. Its probably a good beer to offer to someone who is new to Trappist-style ales, although connoisseurs of true Trappist Ales will probably be disappointed."
"Pours a hazy bright golden orange color with a very tall and pillowy white head that coats the walls of the glass as it slowly fades into a creamy lace. Nose is quite fruity with notes of fresh banana, clove, and nutmeg. Smooth and extremely creamy in the mouth and medium in body. Taste is dominated by creamy banana with additional flavors of fresh citrus, ripe peaches, clove, nutmeg, and vanilla. Very nice! Im surprised to see some of the low ratings for this beer as I found it to be a real pleasure to drink. Reminds me a lot of a Hefeweizen but a bit more complex."
"Clear golden in color, with a full, frothy, white head. Nose is subtle, but still fruity, spicy, notes of butter, bubblegum, and bananas. More fruits come through later, primarily peach, apricot, citrus. Good hops on the sweet palate, but they lay low afterwards. An oily, slick feeling takes over. Malt feels insufficient, texture is far too thin, and watery, body is slight. Overall, a disappointment. This was never my favorite style of the La Trappes, but that one was never this bad. I could taste test them, as there are still some La Trappes hanging around, but that would mean buying another bottle of this!"
"I've had all the La Trappe beers, and I must say that I didn't know if this one would hold up against the other three. I saw ""Blond"" on the bottle and expected something wimpy. Of course, I should have known better. This beer was great. Maybe even my favorite of the four . . . ?"
"Pours a clear deep gold, with a persistant white head. Aroma is musty and sweet and reminds me a bit of a barn... some hay in the aroma. Flavor of sour fruits... a bit of spice (sage?) with a touch of sweetness. Has a thin body and a velvety mouthfeel. Very declicate flavor, that didn't live up to what I expected after the setup that the aroma gave. A pretty good beer, but not one I'm likely to seek out."
"Hazy peach color, minimal head in a La Trappe chalice. Laces downward in drips. Sweet smells, ""circus peanut candy"" banana-like aromas. Flavors follow the smell, senses of estery notes, a bit of cinnamon spiciness in the only slightly dominant malt. Medium-high carbonation -- light, but not fizzy, mouthfeel. I liked the hopping in this one, not a lot of flavor but a good amount of hot bitter sense to balance the brew. Nice beer, puts brews like Leffe Blonde in a back seat. Not a favorite in the overall world of beerdom, but a drinkable rendition of style."
"Brilliantly clear golden hue, covered by a large bubbled head that recedes into a spotty, but persistent thin layer. Lace is left. Light banana and bubblegum esters upfront in aroma, with secondary notes of phenol and herbal hops. Crisp, somewhat assertive bite of carbonation is perceived at first, then mellows sufficiently to allow mild bready malt sweetness and clove to dominate. Well attenuated and dry, with the light residual sweetness adequately balanced by the low hop bitterness. Crisp, lightly dextrinous mouthfeel conducive to good quaffability. Finishes dry and mostly clean, with continuing notes of fading clove. La Trappe Blond is a tame and understated Belgian pale ale. Its main strength lies in its refreshing nature and high drinkability. Quite enjoyable, but not outstanding. This was the 11.2 oz bottle."
"Gold color. Nice white head that is lasting. Hops and smoke in the back of your nose. Big alcohol malt flavor. Medium to light body. Slight smoke taste to the finish. Not a special beer, but an ok selection."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed a nice sudsy white head with some nice lace.  Some carbonation.  Definate aroma of hops and some citrus.  The flavor was of hops and citrus.  The finish was slightly tangy, no doubt due to the carbonation and citrus.  A good beer."
"Notes: Gets better around cellar temp. as suggested on the back label (50-55*F). Not a bad brew but more of an acquired taste. The astringent / slight oxidized character seems to take over mostly. Oddly this brew is filtered and there is no form of secondary fermentation in the bottle which is totally associated with this style of beer hence the formation of oxidation and corkiness in the beers character."
