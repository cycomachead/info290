Very well balanced, perfect fitting carbonation, which leads to a smooth, fresh mouthfeel. Clove is big in this, without being too present on the tastebuds. Results in a warm, yeast supported, pleasant finish.","aleigator","Saturday at 08:29 AM"

So Ian built this one up for me as an amazing beer and to be honest I was sceptical about a Belgian blond. However it is a revelation and took some of the shine off my crates of Westy 12, as I suddenly wanted some of this to take home too. Gives me something to look forward to next time. Very bright amber and fresh looking beer. Up close there’s tiny specks of grain in the hazy beer. Bright head is medium to full, and fluffy and light. Nose is a big burst of fresh citrousy lemony hops, with citrous acidic, pithy lemon and satsuma, crisp yeast. Taste is a big burst of lemony hops, crisp Belgian yeast. It’s light, effervescent and leaves a tingling lemon citrous bitterness on the tongue well after sipping. Lovely finish. There’s also a little bit of lemon curd creaminess to it. Light as a feather and bursting with citrousy hop. This is a great beer and probably the best Belgian blonde beer I’ve had by a long way.","EdKing","Apr 10, 2014"

I guess it WAS a long ride, but I did give it a few days to settle. head simmers to just a fine layer. very nice and very beautiful on the pour. the sediment is very excusable considering its journey. mild hops in the taste. almost a pilsner kind of hoppiness to the taste, but otherwise pilsner-like. smooth and very refreshing, this is a wonderful brew. some green apple, some hay. reminiscent of a run through a field in Nebraska (I have never been anywhere near Nebraska- maybe it's all the movies?) my vocabulary isn't nearly as refined as some of these other reviewers, but this is very special. it's not overwhelmingly rich and sweet like some of the 'wannabe' American Belgians (or even some of the other Belgians) and they have just got this one simply right. the shipping was a bit extraordinary, but worth it considering I always wanted to try these brews. this would be the PERFECT lawnmower beer if it were available around the block!!! licking the yeasty sediment of the bottle it's very sweet! alright, I admit, I French licked the bottle. not to be gross but there is a huge amount of flavor on the inside of this bottle neck! mouthfeel is above medium in heaviness but feels really good and satisfies almost as if I had eaten a small meal. I may be starstruck due to the celebrity, but this gets very high ratings from me. if it were of the same difficulty in finding as Pliny, I would say this one would get my attention a little bit more. for awhile, at least....","pkalix","Feb 15, 2014"

It has all the lemony, hammy, salty characteristics but at a lower ABV that doesn't leave much of a burn behind. Nice foggy-yellow color, and the light fizz is a bonus, too. Plus it has-- I say this in a good way-- the aroma of Murphy's oil soap. Admit it: *you*, too, inhale deeply when when you open the Murphy's bottle.

The bitterness was fine but something was not quite right. This was purchased from a specialty shop and could not find a best before date and that could be the problem.

Grassy, spicy hoppiness with a kiss of citrus, specifically lemon, and just a hint of yeasty bread. And absolutely no sweetness, and none of the sourness that was so present in the nose. Crisp, smooth and dry as a bone, but oh so refreshing. The balance is perfect. This is as close to the perfect Belgian blonde as it gets. I'm not big into Belgian pale ales, but this stands out from the pack. Perhaps my next beer run to the abbey will be for a couple of cases of blonde!","beerdrifter","Jan 10, 2012"

4.1,-3.5,4,4,4,5,4,"Hazed sunflower gold with an ivory meringue white head that retains fairly well. On the nose there are pumpkin seeds, roses, carnations, coriander, and lemon, with an unexpected tropical undercurrent of pineapple, passion fruit, and papaya that's matched, kinda weirdly, with a musty cellar/fermenting dough character. The flavor is all fruit punch and mimosa, reeling with pineapple, orange, kiwi, and banana, with hints of apricot and mirabelle, and coriander, dandelion and yeast around the edges. I think I detect something fennel-ish as well, and some sweet cashew nuttiness. The texture is spot-on for the flavor, light and soft and cloud-like, but not insipid or thin. A very tasty and interesting pale ale, as you might expect from a brewery of such stature.","soulgrowl","Nov 21, 2011"

Belgians are too boozy or also too sweet. I don't like sweet things, so the citrus provides a perfect refreshing replacement for sugariness. I love hops, but have never had a beer this light, refreshing, and balanced with enough hoppiness. Drinking this made my eyes water like when I read a great poem or see one of my favorite paintings in person. I doubt I'll ever have another blonde this good. Well worth every penny.

3.11,-26.8,4,3,3,3.5,3,"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. This is a tricky one. It certainly is very easy to drink, but that could be more in part due to the surprisingly lack of boldness in the nose and flavor rather than an eagerness to quaff it on my end. Just a bit too bready for my liking and certainly doesn't resonate on the same level as the 12 and 8 by Westvleteren. Those beers are world class and unique, while I feel this beer is rather pedestrian, and even moreso considering the pedigree behind the name. I'm not slamming the beer's score just based on who brews it, but I can't help but feel it is in a separate realm compared to the 12 and 8. Maybe a fresher bottle would preserve some of those flavors better, but as it stands, I will stick to the other two Westvleteren beers.","nhindian","Aug 30, 2011"

4.42,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The flavors are complex and separately distinct at first gulp, then begins the harmonious blending and mingling. Resinous Belgian hoppiness, citrus rind, caramel malt and spiced rum form as one and invite large gulps and noisy lip-smacking. The candi sugar sweetness is the unifying factor here.

3.96,-6.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4," The flavor is malty with some light dry cracker-like tinges with some herbal almost bitter flavored with strong yeastiness and minty element from the hops which gives a nice contrast to the grassy and slight fruity yeast. The malt doesn't taste like the smell leads you to believe it will, just basically dry and the yeast adds a minor pear accent to the mild tannic tinge the hops create. The yeast and hop cohesion is very pleasant and the dry essence makes this a nice sipper, welcoming additional tastes. I enjoyed this a lot, but overall it was not what I expected. I found it to be saison-like in a good way and the very dry malt is what I was not expecting. This is not the best of what this brewery offers but it has a high drinkability quotient so do try it if you enjoy saisons or hoppy belgian pale ales.","Slatetank","Jul 12, 2011"

The flavor is very nicely balanced with good hop flavors up front and at the finish, and a doughy/ yeasty flavor with some malt character in the middle. The mouthfeel is creamy, with a lively carbonation pricking through. The finish is dry. A very drinkable beer, I had to force myself to slow down and savor it.","gamwich","Feb 13, 2011"

Interesting yeast interplay is the first thought upon sipping. Kind of reminiscent of an aged De Dolle offering. The yeast is too heavy at times for my taste. Soft lemons creep around, but can't really shine through the yeast. There's a purity and freshness to this brew. Quite a bit of citrus fruit, like grapefruits, oranges, and lemons. This is interesting, definitely very good, with a really refreshing quality.","JAXSON","Jan 26, 2011"

I learned that the Westvleteren Blonde is the basic beer for the monks' own consumption, since 1999, when the former 6° dark ale (red cap) was finally discarded, after the 4° had already gone that path. I had the Westy Blonde (6) on self-proclaimed "Westy day" 01/06/11 with a craft beer aficionado first prior to tasting a Westy 8 and then a 12. This beer was bottled in 2008 (with date 19.10.11 stamped on cap). The beer poured a cloudy blonde and faint bubbly appearance. Retained nice carbonation throughout. This is an unique style - taste buds were immediately challenged initially turned from "fire to ice". Noticeably tastes better from cold to just above room temperature. Smell was wheaty and perhaps hints of banana for a blonde beer like this. Definitely hit the top of my palate. This beer left nice laces throughout and is a very drinkable beer. I would like to try this beer again in the summer if acquired again.","CuriousMonk","Jan 11, 2011"

The bitterness from the hops is evident throughout but rather than overpowering the other flavors, they compliment them adding complexity and balance.

The lemony citrus is the first thing to hit the tongue, followed by a mild undercurrent of yeasty twang, and a finale of dry sweetness. The texture is the star more than anything, though, with an initial effervescent punch to the tip of the tongue that somehow seems to disappear into an unexpected smoothness as the liquid explored my mouth.

4.97,16.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"33cl bottle with the signature ring around the neck, green cap. Thanks to Alen for the trade. I was told this bottle recently came from the source in Belgium so it is a fresh sample, for what it's worth. Beautiful golden hue, slightly yeasty after the second pour, large sticky white head lasting a while. Smell is all soft honey and milk with a nice bit of yeasty bread and a good bit of dry herbal hop bouquet in there. This is phenomenal. Wow, I really didn't expect this to be so hoppy. I assumed it would be more "blonde" as the name implies but I guess I didn't notice that it was categorized as a Belgian Pale. While it does share an excellent crispness and pale malt with something like a blonde German lager, it also has a great dry, bitter, spicy and herbal hop profile. Really great and unexpected. So subtly complex but what makes this beer great is that it's just so simple and tasty. Delicious. Smooth, substantial, and crisp on the palate. Utterly quenching and refreshing. I will have to go to Belgium one day and drink many of these. One is not hardly enough. To quote my lady: "This beer is beyond awesome."","twelvsies","May 12, 2009"

The spices were notable in this beer in the taste, and the base taste in this beer seemed to be like a sour apple. Overall, this beer was mild, but it tasted great.

I am 2 days away from it's so called expiration. :) But anyway, it's like I am just done with a whole load of academic crap and I was deciding what to drink for the night; posted something on BA to poll for opinions and in the end thought I would chill out with a light one.. away from all the big beers for today. :) On to the beer, This one smells citrusy, grassy, malty and yeasty; the yeasts took a stronger stand after the pour but before the pour, off the opening I had nice sweetness admist the malts and minimal yeast. The pour again yielded one of the best lookers though I am pretty sure this one is murkier than my previous Westy Blond (probably due to the age and dark sediments) but I just love the way the creamy head develops; very nice... It comes up nice and after the pour it continues to grow in a very nice way leaving a smooth looking creamy head that you almost feel like touching it to feel it. The entry was a refreshing scent of yeast mixed with malts and grassiness and as we move towads the finish the malts take over. There was a slight malt sweetness throughout which made it pretty pleasant. The finish was dry and slightly bitter leaving a nice bready nose and a very lasting after taste made up of malts and grapes. There was also some breadiness in the after taste as well. Interesting that after sitting around for a good 5+ minutes, the after taste feels like pears. :) Body is somewhere between medium to thin and the carbonation goes in strong and its smoothness is water like with a slight creamy touch; not fantastic on the smoothness as illustrated in my last tasting. Perhaps the carbonation was a little too high on this one though it is wierd as this one's older. Nonetheless, a great blond for someone like me who ain't really into blonds. This one ranks up there with Duvel if not going beyond the Duvel. I think I enjoyed it more the last time but I can't be too sure. Perhaps fresher is better for this one. :)","basica","Nov 21, 2007"

If the mug is dirty, then it will not. As for the beer... I usually review wines, but for this special beer, I was utterly impressed from start to finsh. The ullage was great, and the brew poured with a distinctive thick head. Having not partaken of any ales or stronger brews in awhile, this jumped off my pallate like a springboard.

It was much hoppier than I would have expected with both hop bitterness and flavor. It had a bit of spiciness to it as well and then finished with a malty finish.

Light, bready body and a mild hop bite, which falls off to a gently sweet, grainy aftertaste. Fresh mountain spring water is evident everywhere in this ale.

Palate is complex and encompassing, with sweet malt and some terrific citrus notes. A perfect hop balance keeps this beer from being cloying in a masterful way. Relatively dry finish and the taste gains complexity as it warms. Spiciness lingers on long after you swallow. This beer has an absolutely incredible mouthfeel that is thick, but not heavy.

The head settles down to a thin, though still persistent, lace which clings to the sides of the glass. The taste...fruit followed by an earthy undertone from the yeast, with a hint of a metallic aftertaste that is just enough to counterbalance the initial sweetness. Suprisingly dry finish given the fruit upfront. Mouthfeel is silky and just a whisper too thin if I'm splitting hairs. Drinkability is only limited by the rareness of this gem.

Taste is so well balanced it is hard to pick out individual flavours, maybe some orange peel over the malt background, with a little light clove spiciness. Finish is nicely balanced with crisp refreshing bitterness from the hops, but beyond that there is no hops flavour dominance noticeable. Mouth was light and fluffy, but not watery. Complemented the flavours nicely. Very drinkable on a hot day (which it was when I visited). A pity I was limited to only one as I had to drive back to Paris.

4.09,-3.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured out a cloudy lemon yellow with a ton of yeasty chunks floating throughout. Very thick and creamy white head that was only a thin, but nice and consistant layer. Wonderful scents of saisons, belgian yeast, bananas, chardonnay, and spices. Dry and slightly bitter at the edges. Black unsweetened tea. The flavors get better with each sip. Good amount of carbination, but yet it is not too much. Bit of foaming up over your tongue, but nothing too extreme. The feel is just right for the style. Light feeling, it just flows through your mouth. Very easy drinker, but not one I would pick for a regular drinker -if it was one that was just normally sitting around here and there that is.","shapudding","Jan 01, 2005"

4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle at the Moan and Dove. Nice pour. Its a mysterious cloudy golden, obviously bottle-conditioned. The nice lasting 1cm cover of moon white head makes the westmalle chalice looks particularly attractive. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy, Im first striked by a wave of floral goodness complemented by grassy undertones. Definite champaign qualities despite the big malty sweet components. Candi sugar is not used with moderation for a 6% ale, malt is honeyish, pilsner malt? and imparts coconut and bready aromas. Very yeasty palate all around, dry all the way. Spicy (pepper, mint, sage). Delicately flowery. Balancing mild tartness, mostly on the citric lemon side, salty finished with very restrained bitterness. Youre welcomed in my glass anywhen my dear. A good dose of various herbs is always a pleasure to taste as long as its more of a complement than the unique focus. No alcohol is noticeable in there. Thats their session beer? It just made a monk out of me.","Rastacouere","Oct 12, 2004"
4.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Taste: A slow malt start, but with a nice dry finish and mild hop bite to it. Mouthfeel was obviously less present than the 12, but I thought it held up really well and I regret not bringing some back with me from my trip.","Goldorak","Oct 11, 2004"

Taste is very refreshing with the malts coming out first followed by some hard to distinguish spices followed by a sweet ending. Body is medium with great carbonation and alcohol is not detectable. Wow! This is one great light Belgian ale. Too bad I cannot get my hand on this stuff more regularly.","Phyl21ca","May 03, 2004"
4.06,-4.5,5,4,4,4,4,"Sharp hop nose with some earthy and grassy overtones. Golden champagne look in the goblet with lots of tiny bubbles and a very dense and lasting snow white head. Great lacing as well. Peachy juicyfruit taste upfront on the tip of the tongue initially. Then the brew morphs into a rustic earthy slightly barnyard grass finish. Medium to light on the mouth. Very attractive beer, with great complexity in its taste.","frank4sail","Apr 23, 2004"
4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12.11.04 on the cap. Lots of yeasts sediments in the bottle, a big chunk and smaller sediments. Light and slightly creamy head on an impressive complex golden color. Nice movement of bubbles in the middle of the glass. Some lemon in the smell. A very clean and yeasty smell. Less fruitiness than I expected in the taste. A malty complexity, with enjoyable nuances of tart. Very smooth. The powerful hops at the end leave a long-lasting and thick mouthfeel. A really good beer. Complex. I wish Id be able to detect more elements to describe it. Maybe next time","tjd25","Mar 22, 2004"

As I let it warm to room temp. the flavors of the fruit and pepper came out so much more! My beer had a head on it the entire 45 minutes it took me to finish this 11.2 oz. bottle.

4.52,6.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Overall: The Westvleteren DNA is definitely present in the latest offering from the St.Sixtus Abbey. A replacement for the often raw Special 6 (Red Cap), this is a much better beer in my opinion and adds a genuine low(er) gravity quaffer to the Westie fleet. This is a very good, high quality; extremely drinkable beer that is the base offering from the St.Sixtus Abdij. Its true to say that it is not up there with the 12, or even the 8, but it is really not that far behind either.","TheLongBeachBum","Oct 28, 2003"
3.8,-10.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall Impression: If I'm not mistaken, the water down in Westvleteren is quite high in carbonate hardness (similar to Orval's water). Could be the reason for the minerally mouthfeel and accentuated hop bitterness. This is my first taste of Westvleteren and I have to say I'm not blown away. I'm going to withhold judgement until I've tried the whole line. After all, who can ignore the constant raves about 12?","GreenCard","Oct 20, 2003"

Taste is crisp, super spicy, and matched up with a very pleasing toasted graininess. Bitter hops yeilds to a peppery almost hot cleansing finish. Full of fresh flavors, and medium bodied.

4,-5.9,4,4,4,4,4,"After a string of high-alcohol Belgian offerings, this lower-horsepower ale was a treat, and something of a relief. Soft aroma of candy sugar and bready yeast. Flavor was a bit more malty than other Belgian blondes, but nicely balanced with reserved bright yeasty fruit notes. This one does not try to go over the top, and focuses instead on being a quality mild ale. Thanks to BelgianBum for the sample.","Brent","Feb 16, 2003"

It poured a very foamy, bubbly light gold color and formed a foamy head that left a fairly thick coating of lace. A good deal of carbonation and sediment was present(but due to the foam, I probably poured too much of it from the bottom). An aroma of hops and grain with a slight hint of clove. A flavor of hops, grain and a bit peppery. The finish also hint at the pepper. A good beer.","Wildman","Feb 14, 2003"

Malt dominates the nose, hints of citrus, somewhat sour undertones also present. Start is nicely malted, and slightly sweet with the top lanky. Finish has a penetrating acidity, the hops delectable and pleasing in their spiciness, very dry and somewhat tart aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, clean and spritzy comes to mind when I describe this beer, good but the least favorite in this line of beers.","Gusler","Nov 18, 2002"

Herbal hop aromas mix in with pear like fruitiness. Slightly sweet at first then becomes drier when the earthy / herbal hop flavors come into play. Finishes dry but not overly drying. Could have used a little thicker mouthfeel for a more refined drink, but this is not the prurpose of this beer. Its a delicate, drink all the time type beer for the monks.","Longstaff","Oct 07, 2002"
