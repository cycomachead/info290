"A really good beer from Allangash which never disappoints.  I would buy this year round if it were available in my area."
""
"3.87/5.00"
"Not sure why the average BA score is only an 82 as I thought that this was very tasty, light, crisp and enjoyable. If this was a yearly production this would be a great session beer and I’m glad I tried it."
"Once more, there were so many lees that even the slightest movement of the bottle would rouse them. This was going to take a skillful, steady hand in order not to screw it up. Now, where might I find such a thing?  I pulled it off, but given the resulting wisps, I decided to again employ the bartender's trick. This resulted in a finger of fluffy, eggshell-white head that slowly fell back to wisps. Color was again a solid Gold (SRM = 5) and when coupled with its NE-quality clarity, I had a return visit from Midas, Mammon and Croesus, all wanting a sip and all squabbling about it, as is their wont. Nose held a peppery, spicy funkiness, leaving no doubt that it was some sort of Belgian-style beer. The hops may have fallen off in the interim, but I was not really unwound. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was kind of muted in comparison to the nose. It had a lemony-citrus flavor and a light pepperiness, but the promise of the nose was simply not met. Finish was semi-dry, but I just felt like it lacked any Ooomph! like the nose had led me to expect. Final pour: Some nice murky mud in terms of color. Nose held a pronounced funk. Flavor was only slightly better."
""
"I thought that this beer was too hopped up with not enough fruitiness up front. It just seemed too bitter. But, maybe that's just me."
""
"Poorly done attempt at the style. I was looking foward to this one in the pack, but it was just another flop. Pair it with a cream of roasted carrot soup. I give it a 75.5/100."
""
""
""
""
"OK collaboration on tap at City Taphouse in Philly along with other Beer Camp collabs."
""
"This is a pleasant beer that screams Allagash. It's not really remarkable in any way, but it's mellowness is refreshing. Definitely worth a try."
"Taste-Piney hops meet spicy Belgian yeast leading to a white grapefruit bitterness in the finish. Very well-balanced and tasty. Like a  liquid walk through a Belgian hop farm."

"11/25...BCAA 8/12...pours orange rusty color with fast fizzy white foam that climbs up the side. Wheaty nose, chalky with coriander. Smooth clean crisp taste - the flavor wraps a clean center. Overall taste is subdued. Good."

""
""
""
""

""
"Nice mix of hoppy and spicy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice and light. The coriander isn't strong but rounds out the flavor nicely. Will be a good beer in a hot day."

"Golden honey color with an inch of white head and creamy lacing on the glass.  Aromas are subtle.  Light citrus and pine with some fruity Belgian yeast notes and a touch of spice.  Taste brings some citrus and piney hop flavor with fruity notes and a slight cracker like sweetness mid palate and fades to a floral and spicy finish.  There is some surprising body here which I'd call medium.  Medium carbonation goes creamy mid way and finishes nice and dry.  Overall this is interesting but the thing is it isn't a great Belgian beer and it isn't a great pale ale.  The components are there but it falls short of great, but is good."
"Another average beer from this collaboration pack. An ok spice profile and has a light Belgium flavor. As with every other beer in this pack. Way to light and watery~"

"Well done."
"Hazy straw golden body with a soft, white head. Belgian yeast, light spice, floral, citrus, earth. Pretty good."
""
""
"Hazy, dark golden, hazy. Two fingers do fluffy white head with nice retention, good lacing. Aroma is malty, spicy and earthy, with some citrusy notes. Taste is kinda piney, with some subdued malt notes and some spicy peppery notes and bright citrus on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium light, kinda creamy, with a nice aftertaste. Overall, pretty good."
""
""
"3.75 | 85 | B"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent colab.  Very tasty for a lower abv brew.  Well done"
""
"O- Pretty nice. Flavors are mild enough for such a delicate beer, and the hop character isn't too over the top."
""
""
"O=I envision this to be more appealing to drink in the summer, on a hot day, but paired with food.  By itself, this beer is a bit annoying.  I wouldn't buy again, and probably wouldn't drink a bottle again if offered to me."
""
"O: I'm generally not into Belgian style stuff, but this was interesting, especially when the tropical fruit notes shone through. I wish they made that more of the dominant hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer.  Definitely fun to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is very herbal with slight phenolic flavor carrying over from the aroma with slight tangy tropical fruit element with nice malt support adding dimension and cushioning the bitterness slightly with tangy yeast adding an interesting contrast with light floral element and resins from the hop giving a subtle complexity in the finish. Overall I think this is pretty great as far as drinkability goes, a nice hop forward Belgian pale not intense but bitter to the point it verges on Belgian Ipa, just not quite there - I really like the yeast flavor even if it is on the dry side"
""
""
"Nice flavor, not too hoppy, very reminiscent of Tripel Karmeliet."
""
"Overall:  Nice take on the style and I like the subtle notes and simplicity of this beer.  Hope there is a return to production with this beer on the future."
""
"I was really pleased with this (and how well it held up), as I just got my hands on some Beer Camp bottles. Pored a cloudy, golden hue with little to no head. Looked inviting. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, banana/funk, light coriander, and the classic SN bitter note (that I love). Tastes of fruit cup (yeah, that fruit cup), and some orangey citrus. Light Belgian yeasty profile, and nice balance. Classic SN job of absolutely nailing the mouthfeel for the style, and leaving a nice aftertaste. This was my favorite of the Beer Camps I tried. I'd jump on another if I found it."
"Brewed with coriander, Myron’s Walk offers up a faint banana nose, a suggestion of orange, light fruit, spice, malt and a hint of hops. It pours a slight hazy gold under a grand 2” stiff white head that produces classic Belgian gothic window lace. The flavor profile begins with a slight sweetness, banana, faint orange, hints of bubble gum, some biscuit notes and then it dries out with a little yeast funk and an assertive hop bitterness that lingers well into the aftertaste to conclude with a crisp, dry, flavorful finish. The exquisitely creamy, moussey texture gives the beer a satisfying medium to medium light feel."
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a medium white head. Aroma is sweet citrus fruity esters, citrusy hops, mildly bread. Taste is sweet zesty citrus flavor, some spice citrus hops bitterness, yeasty and bread notes. Palate is a medium body, crisp with good carbonation. Finish is sweet fruity flavor, mild zesty spiced citrus hops, yeast with a mild dry hopped bitter ending. Overall a very good, crisp and refreshing brew."
""
""
""
""
"Packaged on date read 6/3/14. Pours mostly clear gold with massive white head and a fair amount of suspended particles present. Smells of lemon, orange peel, and coriander. Some spicy noble hops seem evident. Wheat malt Aldo in nose with some white bread character. Tastes just like the nose with an upfront sweetness that finishes dry. Easy drinking and somewhat easy bodied. Nicely done beer and one of my favorites in the Beer Camp mix case."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just ok"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts out bitter then, becomes tropical and sweet. Just a hint of coriander. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent and somewhat refreshing, but too much coriander which somewhat overpowers the other elements. Not something I would grab on even a semi-regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A nice Belgian, fine with our spaghetti dinner."
"The nose is a combination of perfume, floral and herbal hops, caramel malts and some fruit elements. The hop flavor seems more prominent with a floral perfume accent. The coriander is obvious in a spicy fruity tone. Some bitter herbal notes longer at the end. There is an underpinning of caramel malt. Very drinkable very approachable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very centrist version of the style."
"Solid BPA but comes off a bit abrasive at times with the spicy yeast and added coriander combining together. I do like the fruit flavors they get out of the yeast but it just doesn't come together as a whole in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Very well done to the style with a tip towards the Belgian attributes.  A touch sharp at times making this far from my favorite BPA however everything is well in its place.  Meaning another finely crafted and enjoyable Camp brew with great balance to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  The dominating spice flavor ruined the beer."
"Mouthfeel is very good a little warming and full feeling  on the tongue, then dry and cleansing with lingering spice and light malt flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a nice cross cultural beer - not quite a Belgian IPA but certainly verging on it; very drinkable"
""
""
""
"Pours a bright yellow color, clear. Foamy white head, good head retention.  Aroma of earthy hops and a bit of funky Belgian yeast. Pale malt, a bit of herbal flavor in the taste, very dry aftertaste.  Medium body and carbonation."

"Mouthfeel is great anf overall a darn good beer."
""
""
"This pours a light golden color with great foaming atop it. I enjoyed the hop blend they used for this beer. I found it lightly hopped, with a tropical fruit note that leads into a honey dew/melon finish. It tastes pleasantly topical as well, with some of the melon and honeydew mixing in with the hop profile. Interestingly, I found a touch of bicarbonate on the finish, and a taste of malt. This kept my interest and I hope to try it again."
""
""
""
""
"Taste and drinkability - Very refreshing to the palate. Light, crisp; a good summer beer. Very heavy with banana and spice. Tart and fruity."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, maybe the best represented beer so far in the Beer Camp collab thing. Def not my fav style, but represented fairly well. Nice mild esters, coriander is good without going overboard, decent mild hop background, lemon, plenty of nice wheat and grassy like malt flavors, enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from the mix pack. Pours hazy deep golden colored with a half finger creamy white head. Aroma of pears, apples, peaches, light spice, funky barnyard yeast, some grassy hops. Flavor is a peachy sweet honey combo with some pears and very, very light spice. A bit of funky yeast as well. Juicy medium body, medium plus carbonation. Really not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Unfortunately reminiscent of the Alt Route, an old world style that didn't benefit from new world hops. Unfortunately because I usually love ""White IPAs""  This one just a miss for me... (3.65)"
""
""
"Crisp from start to finish. Long lasting aftertaste. A decent brew worthy of a try."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a quite large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing.  Aroma of coriander and spicy yeast notes are dominant with light notes of citrus hops. Taste is also dominated by coriander with some spicy yeast notes with some light Belgian malt and some citrus hops. Body is slightly under average for the style with good carbonation. Very enjoyable beer but hops profile was not as evident as I would have expected."

"This is really good, I like it."

"Another nice Belgian Pale Ale from the collection.  Great yeast profile with with pale ale body and flavor.  Quite nice."
""
"The hop presence is quite large here in flavor, bitterness and dryness.  I like it."
"Overall: Solid beer overall. Not quite as good as I'd expected from Allagash and Sierra Nevada, but definitely worth a shot."
"Overall: I'm not a fan of American hops and Belgian beers as a general rule.  That being said, this is the best one I've ever had.  It manages to blend the character of both styles with a perfect balance.  Well done!"
"Overall a solid offering!"
""
""
"Very good..would love to have this more often"

"Sensational balance unique flavor.  Had at kings head in portland."

"At 38 IBU this beer had me wondering where its flavor profile was going to come from.  Bam!  there it was.  This brew exemplified its collaboration - hops from Sierra Nevada and the wonderful Belgian yeast from Allagash.  There's a wonderful peppery note in this beer that makes me think grilled steak or salmon.  I didn't drink this beer out of glass just straight out of the bottle so no notes on color or lace etc."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a soft bubblegum BPA with hints of bitterness on the finish.  Nice enough BPA but nothing earth shattering! But tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  What you would expect from a hoppy Belgian pale ale from Sierra Nevada and Allagash.  Good beer."
"O- Kind of an average belgium ale"
""
""
""
""
"Nothing particularly unique or interesting, but crisp, balanced, refreshing, and just wonderfully brewed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a weak one. Reminds me of budweiser. No thank you."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of caronation. Not a beer im a fan of and would avoid in the future. The character of this one seems quite clashing and conflicting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would have liked more fruit in both the aroma and flavor;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Another solid camper... No duds from my perspective yet. Not sure I'd buy a sixer of this brew, but it was enjoyable."
""
""
"O:  This Walk just doesn't really go anywhere.  Kinda meh."
""
"Poured a nice cloudy golden body with a half finger of white head. Quite nice looking, very true to style. Scents of lemon zest, coriander, spicy phenols, including white pepper-like aromas, hints of tangy orange, fruity esters reminiscent of apricot, a faint note of bubblegum and a tiny bit of clove. A very nice aroma that is fruity and spicy as a Belgian Pale Ale should be and is quite appetizing. Flavor begins medium-dry with notes of white pepper, coriander, lemon zest and a slight pine flavor with faint tart citrus adding depth in the background. This moves into more pronounced spicy phenolic flavors, focusing on white pepper and coriander with lemon zest present and a slightly higher bitterness with hints of tart citrus continuing in the background. Finish is medium-dry with notes of white pepper, coriander, clove, spicy Belgian yeast phenols that are less determinable and lemon zest. Aftertaste is dry with notes of lemon peel, clove, coriander and white pepper, with a hint of cracker-like malt. A very spicy and dry flavor profile overall, not completely true to style, but still quite pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied and drying with moderate carbonation keeping it light feeling on the tongue. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable. Overall this is a good Belgian Pale Ale that doesn't stray too far from drier examples of Belgian ales in aroma and flavor. It's refreshing mouthfeel also make this quite the excellent Summer beer. Interestingly it reminds me most of drier examples of saisons."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
"O - A solid Belgian pale ale, but not anything different from what so many other breweries, including Allagash, have done better. Still, a good summer porch rocker."
"Hazy dark straw color. Lots of coriander both in smell and taste, too much for me. Comes across as very dry, more balancing sweetness to cut the yeastiness and coriander."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum NYC. Not quite what I was expecting. Methinks Sierra Nevada took the lead for this collaberation. Nice copper color, minimal head, Chantiily lacing but barely an aroma. Hints of grapefruit that wait to hit the palate & even then they are distant....mere hints. Nicely done. I aschew hoppy brews so this was a nice surprise within a surprise. More of an IPA than a Belgian, but in this case, that's not so bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavorful and holds its' own in this mix pack."
""
""
"Overall: A very solid take on a Belgian style Pale Ale. Good juicy kick of hops with some good spice and wheat."
""
"Overall a fine beer and another winner in the Beer Camp Across America pack."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy straw colored body with frothy white head. Citrus, pine & fruity aromas. Light fruit, coriander & Belgian spicy peppery flavors."
""
"I truely enjoyed this brew, pricey but REAL good."

""

""

"O: This beer has a nice presence of brett without the flavor/aroma being overpowering. I found this one to be quite enjoyable and easy to drink and recognizable as a collaboration with Allagash (whom I think highly of)."
""
""
"O: An enjoyable beer, overall. It's got some nice funk going on as well, though the bitterness is a little off-putting."
""
""
"Taste is light and somewhat simple with pale malt, yeast, and coriander comprising the main source of it's flavors. Tiny bit of bitterness in the dry aftertaste could be hop derived, but again its very subtle. Crisp, clean, and effervescent. Slight phenolics from the yeast. Overall it was quenching with no flaws, and paired well with food."

"12oz bottle. Pours a hazy brownish straw color with an inch of fluffy white head. Lots of lacing. Funky aroma with some coriander, cloves, and light citrus hops. The taste has more hops than the aroma indicated. Citrus with some light tropical fruit notes. Funky yeast, coriander and cloves as well. Finishes with some citrus peel, yeast, and spices. Creamy mouthfeel with a large amount of carbonation. This was better than I expected and with much more hops. Overall, pretty decent beer. I may even have this on tap since it is the Allagash collaboration and I believe it has been making the rounds here in New England."
""
""
""
""
"O. It's very very very ""OK"". So one note, though, that the finished product comes off like the brewer was aware of the standard notes a Belgian Pale should hit (e.g., slightly fruity, dry, phenolic, yeasty) and mailed it in to the extent that every note is aggressively checked but none of them are very well-integrated. The result is a beer that fits the style but does so in unimpressive fashion."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit muddled between wanting to be hoppy and being an actual Belgian beer. Easy enough to drink, but a bit difficult to discern where this was actually going. Solid, but a weaker part of the 12-pack"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not really digging this collaboration much, way too bitter and all the flavor is derived from the spicy yeast strain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was fairly typical for an American IPA. Drinkability was OK, it wasn't really my cup of tea, but others folks will like it. Overall, good for what it is, and often find that hops and Belgian-style yeasts don't play well together. YMMV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad overall, just nothing memorable; I had hoped for more given the collaborating breweries"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall easy to drink, enjoyable and leaves you wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured hazy, light amber color with finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing is mild. Yeasty aroma typical of Belgian brews. Bready with slight coriander and orange peel as well. Pungent Belgian yeast on first taste. Hits you hard. Slight hoppy finish as the end with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Again, slight coriander and orange peel with the taste. Good beer. Would enjoy again but probably wouldn't seek out"
""

"O: Refreshing and easy drinking."

"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Across America Myron's Walk ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is easily drinkable and solid overall. I will say that as you drink the dryness really builds and becomes the dominant factor."
"D - Solid appearance and aroma give way to a bit of a disappointment in terms of flavor and mouthfeel... Overall, a bit less than a sum of its parts... It's hard to believe that two excellent breweries like Allagash and Sierra Nevada could be responsible for such a disappointing brew... There are a plethora of other Belgian Pale Ales that I would give the odd to before recommending this one..."
""
""
"Taste is a wonderful and refreshing citrus/fruit/spice collision, light enough to session yet packed with a metric ton of flavor. Yes!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a Oversized Wine Glass"
"Overall, this is a really nice Belgian pale. The bitterness is low, which improves drinkability and the use of coriander seems to play surrogate for the citrus presence that you will often get from hops in an American take on pale ale, which makes the fruitiness softer, less pungent. I'd say this offering sufficiently meets what I would expect from a collaboration involving American-based Belgian-style heavyweights Allagash."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer. Not overly complex and surprisingly easy drinking. Nice general fruitiness from the yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really love the elements that went into this beer. Myron's Walk has a wonderful citrus and piney flavor complemented with rich Belgian yeast that offers tones of spice and fruit. I really respect how well balanced this beer is and the hoppy notes it has. right up my alley!"
""
"O - I'd prefer a toned down clove and coriander profile and a little fuller body. Easy drinking but forgettable."
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly creamy head that dissipates almost immediately. The beer itself is a clear light copper with gold notes. The beer smell has some strong banana yeast notes with coriander and mint notes. However, the coriander and mint notes are slightly faint. The beer also has a slight metallic smell to it. Regarding taste, the beer has a metallic taste to it. The Belgian yeast is noticeable as well as the coriander and mint notes that are there. The overall flavor that comes from it is fairly metallic. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and a little bit watery with biting carbonation. Overall, an okay collaboration but nothing to write home about."
"This is my second beer camp beer, certainly more interesting as a collaboration than the Torpedo Pils...still waiting for my first ""blow your socks off"" Beer Camp beer."
""
""
""
"O - good fusion of styles"
""
""
""
"Appearance is a hazy yellow with a fizzy head. The smell has the coriander and other herbs, I thought I smelled mint. The taste had a great herb beginning and end, while having light belgian wheat and mint in the middle. Thought it was very tasty. The mouthfeel was nice but a little too fizzy for my taste. Still an excellent beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty enough. Nicely quenching, good flavor balance, bitterness and dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light malt and quite effervescent. The body, though, is decently above average. Here's a definitive sage-like spice in the swallow. The aftertaste is short but bitter. Again, not much ""Belgian"" to this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's good, but a bit too much coriander for me - I feel like it somehow overshadows any other flavors that might be in there..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a modest Belgian pale with a modest bitterness and abv - easy drinking, distinctly Belgian."
""
""
""
"O- One of the better offerings in the BCAA 12-pack. Would definitely consider buying this again if the opportunity were offered."
""
""
"O: This beer has a nice dose of brett that is neither too strong nor too overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I now believe this to be my favorite of the Beer Camp 12 pack. In fact, I wish I had 12 of these. I'd love to be drinking a few while barbecuing or sitting on a boat. This brew needs to be made again and again for summers to come!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: enjoyable. a little bit more from the malts would have been nice, but the mix of spices in here works well together and doesn't become too much. refreshing and tasty"
""
"An interesting beer but less drinkable than anything like a Belgian Pale Ale. From the 12 oz bottle as part of the 2014 Beer Camp box, purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach."
""
"O - better than I expected. Solid flavor profile, complex, and well crafted."
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/3/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, tangerine, pear, melon, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and citrus hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, pear, melon, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of yeast spiciness/light hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, pear, melon, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and citrus hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy Belgian pale ale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and citrus hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall it is an outstanding brew, but that's just boring! I expected more. I guess blind faith of Beer Camp is a thing of the past."
""
""
"O - This is a decent Belgian pale ale. A nice mix of Belgian yeast and piney hops. A crisp refreshing beer."
""
"The Verdict: Good. An interesting blend of a yeasty Belgian ale and an IPA, but ultimately falls short of most of the other Beer Camp offerings. Quality ingredients, but the combination somehow just doesn’t excite the tongue."

"A tasty, well done Belgian pale ale. Pleasant balance, with a full body and solid malt base."

"O-A solid mixture of Belgian and American aspects coming from two US breweries that I respect very much. Belgian Pale Ales are slowly growing on me."

"Overall: Normally Belgian Pale Ales are not my favorite beers, but the Belgian yeastiness is turned way down on this one. The hops shine through and make this very interesting and flavorful!"
"O: I can't believe there were two BPA in the Beer Camp. This is the superior one. Sorry RR."
""
"O- A solid BPA, not a bad beer by any means."
"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Allagash. Pours a nice golden with minimal head. Classic Belgian nose, yeasty, coriander, orange, with a nice dose of hops at the end. Smells like I might enjoy this one. Taste is peppery, dry, yeasty, with those same coriander and orange flavors on the nose. Mouthfeel is light and dry, but not unpleasant. I actually really enjoy this beer. Simple flavors, well made, pretty tastey for the genre. There isn't much to complain about but also not much to stand up and shout about. Overall, glad I got to try this one!"
""
"Overall - Ehh, ok I guess, but not he best balance, or flavor. Its drinkable, but nothing id want again. It lacks a solid hop backbone that could work a lot better with the spices. Thanks allagash and sierra Nevada though."
"Overall a pretty interesting brew, but doesn't seem to hint at much of the advertised piney-citrus and fruity spice notes as advertised. Decent pale ale, but nothing really different, unique, exciting, or anything new brought to the table here."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I’m a bit perplexed by this beer, one of the weakest out of the twelve pack and I’ve had many better Belgian style ales from both breweries. I don’t get it."

"Aroma of light hops and some Belgian yeast character, which shows itself not so much in strong esters but in an earthy pungent and bready malt character. Aroma gets more complex with warming with deep muddled aromas. Taste is spritzy with carbonation and flavors of bread, lemon and spice. Coriander notes increase with warming and blend well with hop/yeast notes. Finish is full if a bit uneventful as a flash of citrus exists but nothing lingers on the close. Overall pretty good and quite different than Yvan the Great, which I prefer to this one."
"Overall, a solid Belgian pale. I like the hop / yeast combo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Over spiced Belgian pale. Not well balanced. I was hoping for more in light of everything else in this box."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours out a clear brass with thin head. Smells of spicy Belgian yeast, lightly toasty and bready malts, and resinous hops. Flavor is crisp, light, refreshing: reminding me of a great example of a Belgian blonde beer. Yeast is subdued in its spiciness. The coriander doesn't stand up well against the strength of the hops. Definite PNW hops profile. Finishes clean. Mouthfeel is moderate and easygoing. The carbonation is refreshing. Very solid beer."
""
""
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a dull orange hue with a slight haze to the clarity and a tight, quarter inch, bright white head. Nose expresses citrus, light floral aromas and a hint of yeast. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a bit of spiciness, some citrus zest and a light, earthy/herbal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that leaves a residual bite. Overall, a very drinkable and flavorful Belgian Pale Ale. Almost comes off as a BPA/BIPA hybrid. Sad that this is only a one-off."

"O - Another interesting collaboration brew representing a meeting of the minds between a Belgian Pale Ale and an IPA, which walks the tightrope between the two without falling off. I don't go out of my way to seek out Belgian-Style Pale Ales but I'd be glad to find this in my glass again."
""
"faint spice-based astringency and warmth, surprisingly low carb for the initial pour but remains at least medium. medium body and just a bit of protein creaminess; well short of crisp."
""
"It's the first of the box that feels more the other brwer than Sierra Nevada. It's not a bad thing, but the Allagash Belgian yeast dominates."

"My 7th or 8th selection from this series of Beer Camp brews. Everything is rating close to a 4, ambitious and incredibly fresh. Pours golden in hue with minimal lacing. The nose is wonderful, floral and soapy... but the taste pales in comparison. Good oily mouthfeel. Very nice beer."
""
""
""
""

"O: A quaffable and harmonious beer. All flavors play well. The coriander starts strong initially but settles in step with the rest. It pops and has some charm to it. I wouldn't say no to another."

"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer pours a hazy, gold color, with a frothy, clingy, bright white head. Nose of subtle coriander, nutmeg, and basil spice, with a grainy and subtle hopped backbone. Flavors are spice and herb forward, with a very green feel throughout. Subtle yeast funk throughout, with a buttered bread backbone. Light and smooth, with a spice blend and herbal aftertaste. The finish is light and effervesced. Flavorful and drinkable."

"O) Looked and smelled good, but didn't come through. Disappointing since Allagash is capable of delivering one of these."
""
""
"Interesting combo of hop and yeast profile. The smoky note is slightly offputting, but a characterful brew."
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden-yellow with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, earth, spice, Belgian yeast, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, earth, spice, and Belgian yeast flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with lots of nice earthy aromas and flavors."

"Overall (4.25): Well, I think this is my favorite one, so far, from the Beer Camp 12-pack. True to style without sacrificing innovation, well-built and extremely balanced, and generally speaking the most enjoyable one to drink so far. This is (and the Russian River collab) are what I want to drink during the summer. Pints and pints of it. This would also be a great candidate for some light wine barrel aging, too . . . ahem, Sierra Nevada and Allagash. C’mon guys. You know you want it. (And so do I.)"

"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch white head that stuck around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice but light, the brew smells like pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops and some coriander. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some bready/grainy malt and peppery spice. Luckily the flavors aren't subtle like the aroma is. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, worth a try if you've never had it before."
""
""
"Overall: Number 3 out of the pack and from a brewery I had not tried before, and not really had heard all that much about prior to trying this. I was impressed by what I had and I will search out this brewery again."
""
""
"Nice golden pour with a light foam cap. my second beer from the Beer Camp series. Light piney, mild hop taste but too light for me. Definitely a summer brew that can be enjoyed on a sunny afternoon.  Nice aroma, nice color and perfect in a tulip glass. Very excited to see what else Sierra Nevada has to offer in this one time only package."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light tight foam over a pale gold beer. Smells of faint biscuit and hay. Taste is light grain, very very faint banana and spice..which may be coriander but I don't think so. Really not getting much from this beer. It's not bad, but where is the flavor? It's got a lighter body with fair carbonation. There is a sourish after taste."

""
""
""
""

""
""
"Its fast-fleeting finish scrubs the thirst from the palate as a texture and minerally taste of seltzer water allows ""table beer"" Belgianesque character to assume. Dry in finish, a slight tang and carbonic bite closes the taste with echoes of fruit and spice hovering above."
""
""
""
"Well-crafted beer, as I'd expect from Allagash, but it doesn't really stand out. The Belgian character is too slight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I know a lot of people are hating on the Beer Camp stuff and I really think the 12 pack is a great idea, even if the beers aren't all rated 90+ but I do think this beer is very sub par. I have had better beers from brand new breweries so I am not sure how Sierra Nevada decided who made the cut to be in this. This was the worst beer I have had from the 12 pack so far, the others have been pretty good."
""
""
"im sick of hearing people say how big of a let down beer camp has been, and that its overpriced and all hype and all of that, well, i disagree sincerely. 2ish bucks a bottle for some very cool stuff, relax people, its still a good deal. this is one of my favorites from the box so far, a belgian golden type, loaded with coriander. i like that its the coriander without all the citrus that usually goes with it, it can get really samey all the time, these type of beers. this is straw colored and quite clear, average inch of white head on top. the nose is herbal and dry, like a dry heating of spices for an indian dish or something, its fragrant from the coriander, and a little from the yeast too, ever so slightly fruity and sweet. the taste is way cleaner than the nose, super easy drinking. pale honey malt base, a little heft in terms of body, and a middle sweetness thats gone by the finish. coriander continuously ramps up to be rather prominent in the finish, and with the belgian yeast instead of the usual dried orange peel, i think its a nice new twist on a familiar style. critique it for not being the most inventive box of beers, fine, but dont critique it on quality because they have all been fantastic so far."
""
"Overall: this is a satisfying and drinkable beer. I feel like I could quaff this all day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall 3.75: Very hoppy Belgian Golden/Pale Ale, maybe the hoppiest I have ever had. La Chouff puts out a Belgian IPA and this brew reminds me very much of that beer. Maybe that would be the way to market this one if it is ever brewed again: Belgian IPA. Good beer, but the hops take it way outside the guidelines for the style."
""
""
"Overall - Yeah, not the best way to finish off the mix pack. I understand it's a blonde but jeez, some interesting flavor outside the yeast notes would be nice. So yeah, the beer's okay in a 'don't mind drinking it' kinda way, but don't expect much of anything from it."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a golden orange amber with a one finger white head with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of orange, tangerine, grassy and citrus hops, coriander; floral and estery. Flavor is mixed orange and lemon citrus, light saison yeast, coriander and clove, Belgian yeast, citrus hops. Finishes with lemon citrus, grapefruit rind and citrus hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good peppery carbonation. I guess if I had to guess what a collaboration between Allagash and Sierra Nevada would taste like, this would be it. Nice Belgian yeast and spice character, but flavorful hops complementing the spicy bitterness. An aromatic, spicy, citrusy ale that pushes the envelope for a Belgian style, but pulls it off, there are elements of American pale ale, tripel and Belgian pale ale in here and they play well together. Tasty. I felt like a friend had left me abandonded at the side of the road when Allagash left the Seattle market, but I'm glad to have a small taste of them again and wish them luck. I'm 3 for 3 now for nice ales from this great twelve pack."

"This is a nice Belgian Pale. Mellow, light, and easy going. The coriander helps to give it a Saison feel."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""

"What's doing most of the work here is a Belgian Pale base that is more than content responsibly puttering around in a Volkswagen Golf with the windows up, all fuzzy steering wheel cover, all minding speed limits. Meanwhile, the hop profile is putting 15's on it's '88 Supra Turbo. Weaving through traffic, doing burnouts, hella road rage. Ultimately, not bad, just too piercingly unbalanced to coalesce into anything noteworthy."
""
""
""
"O- This is fantastic. A quintessential Belgian pale ale in my eyes. I guess I wouldn't expect anything less from the brains behind Allagash."

"Slightly hazy golden pour with a one-finger white head. Mild citrus aroma. Taste is very bready with flavors of biscuit, spice, and yeast dominating. Medium bodied with a good citrus flavor that comes through in the middle and finishes with a nice resinous bitterness."

""
""
""

"The taste consolidates breaed, toasted biscuit, citrus, and spice into a well-balance experience and then catches me unawares with the clean, crisp finish. 1 down and 11 to go."

"Pours a mix of straw yellow and light amber accents topped with a fluffy clean white two finger head. Excellent retention, thick, coating lacing. Light citrus, Belgian yeast, coriander, and clove on the nose. Opens with light lemon accents and mixed fruit. Coriander and fruity yeast mixed with clove and a very light note of banana follow. Finishes with white pepper spice, citrus rind bitterness, and just a touch of pine. Light body, smooth with a hint of creaminess; moderate carbonation. Really excellent brew. One of my favorites so far in this year's Beer Camp pack."

"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp event at PreFunk. Pours a hazy golden, lazy carbonation. Nice yeasty, sourdough, coriander. Thick , creamy body with small silky head. Sharp hops bite on the finish. A true Belgian, spot on for the style. The best of the lot so far."

"A nice spiciness to this beer. You can taste Belgian yeast. A very good, and slight citrus taste, but huge banana notes in this Belgian style. It was fruity and bready. One of my favorite's so far in the pack. I have 8 more to go, but this may hold as the third best."
