"Very mediocre representation of this style. Kind of tastes like a watered down triple."

"O: Easy to drink and very clean, good overall but nothing epic."
""
""
"Spicy, citric, floral, acidic aroma.  Tropical fruit flavor.  Hint of acid. Leafy, citric hop.  Fresh flavor overall.  Very well balanced."
""
""
""
"Would have again; worth getting ahold of.  (3.75)"
"Poured from bomber that was ice cold, flavors didn't change much as it warmed. Overall a good but not amazing beer. Rich gold color, typical Belgian flavors, very easy to drink....but also easy to forget."
""
"Overall: Its not a very interesting beer, glad I had the opportunity to try it but I would not seek it out again."

"A fairly average Belgian Pale Ale. Pours a hazy copper/amber color with a small white head and average retention.  Aroma and taste are mostly light fruit and Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is fairly rich and smooth, not much alcohol presence.  A pleasant enough drink, but nothing outstanding."

"O-Not super sour but just enough tartness to add character to a solid BPA base beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lively, expressive, crisp, and a touch of funk. Ripe exotic fruit ... dragon fruit. Cracker maltiness, nutty yeast. Some musty funk within. Hint of warmth from the alcohol. Great use of brett, like that there is still a hint of sweetness here though I wonder where this brew would be after another 6-12 months of cellaring. Glad I had it now though."

"I was hoping for a greater Brett influence and a drier beer. Not bad. Comes off as a fruity, semi sweet tripel."
""

"(O)- I like the Brett addition this has. Perhaps a bit richer with the malt bill than I expected, but I like being surprised."

"Overall eh."
"O - Overall the taste and nose were rather mediocre. I think it was the wrong base beer for the approach, unfortunate."

"a near perfect beer for thanksgiving. a little brett, not too funky or wild, but definitely more complex than your standard holiday swill. hazy light amber color, copper tinted, with an inch or so of thick white almost nitro looking head. the nose is as much Belgian yeast as it is brett, mostly very light malts, pale, and herbal on the hop front with a distinct spice on the back end. the flavor is basically the same as the smell, but the Belgian yeast and brett do some outstanding tandem work in fermentation. its a little bigger in body than I thought it would be, and has very lively carbonation. its fruited and spiced in at first, and the slightly tannic wild side comes out just in the finish with maybe a splash of vinegar, nothing harsh or abrasive. overall another beauty from perennial. maybe not as interesting as some others, but its a good potential gateway wild beer, given its noticeable but approachable brett characteristics. good stuff with the turkey!"
""
"Does hide the booze really well, though."
"O: For $13.99, I expected much better."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good pale ale, that was more saison than anything with brett."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and Brett aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and Brett flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of Brett bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice Brett presence that is slightly better in the taste."
""

""

""

"*Edit* - I will say this for the beer, I was probably a little harsh on it when I wrote the review, because as it warms it opens up immensely, and brings out a lot more earthiness."
"this is a fairly average beer, a very subtle mix of flavors. nice, but i don't think it's worth the price i paid ($13).. nice to try it, but no specific quality of this beer stands out."
""
""
""
"MF – Medium light bodied, medium dry finish."
""
"Overall - I don't get the brett at all. Generic maltiness and yeast flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great summer sipper. Recomended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dry and effervescent, spicy and yeast forward, but not all that funky. Lightly sweet and spicy, again not really funky at all. Medium bodied, peppery and dry in the finish. Overall okay, not really all that much Brett even after 6 months of cellar time, but drinkable nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden with a bit of reddish highlights. Minimal carbonation. Effervescent carbonation. The nose seems to be a battle of Brett and coriander. I'll give the Brett a slight advantage. The taste is again a struggle between the Brett and coriander and this is a much tighter race. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. I just don't know that this blend of flavors really works well together."
""

"This is a little less than I was hoping for, after trying several brews from Perennial. The beer is thick with the kind of profile for a Belgian ale that seems to be prevalent in a lot of American interpretations. Thick and somewhat clogged. I think the use of Brett here kind of adds a little complexity and pulls it away from being a one-track brew. I guess it softens things up. An alright Belgian ale. But it could be something so much more."
""

"O: a very soft, juicy, lush drink - perhaps off-putting if you're expecting something dry and musty, or very pale, but I found similarities to Piraat in both color and flavor, as well as to Belgian tripels in general, with their lush fruit character and solid body. Totally recommended."

"Overall (3.75), while there are definitely some elements to this beer I positively love, I have to dock the score a bit for the gushing and for the fact that the flavor just isn't as vibrant as I feel it could be. It's strikes me as  one of many Orval-inspired beers, but just doesn't quite recapture the magical funky weirdness of the original. That said, it's an excellent beer that can be found on the shelf at pretty much any time without needing to worry about freshness, given the style. I'm sure I'll find myself drinking it again in the future."
"Funky and malty with some off flavors but pretty tasty nonetheless."

"I hope it's something from ""Rigoletto""... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a short finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises dry corn, light Brett funk, mild caramel, and a kiss of booze (you know, like that just straight-up bombed chick you've been eying for a little while, noting the number of shots o' tequila she's been rocking, who then comes up to you in a minor careening stupor and plants her tongue right in your throat...we've all been there...right?...). The taste holds notes of mild orange zest, mild caramel, light grass, and a firm stranglehold of Brett (in a good way). The body is a lithe medium, with a moderate carbonation and a bone dry finish. Overall, a nice enough Brett-infused BPA, but the smell leaves plenty to be desired, and the Brett doesn't mesh entirely well with the rest of the flavors."
""

"The beer pours a rich looking copper color with a thin white head that loosely blankets without lacing. The nose is relatively funky with a slight honey sweetness and a touch of spicy ethanol. The taste is definitely more farmhouse than belgian pale presenting great initial yeast/funk, mild honey and malt sweetness, balanced spice and fruit. Although the honey is present it's overpowered by the yeast until the beer has warmed well past cellar temperature. The spicy hops sit well on the palate and complement the beer's funk and sweetness. This is definitely a drinkable, age-able, balanced Belgian-style beer, but also presents a great depth and character and funk."

"The brett really makes this beer complex. There is a lot going on here. Did not expect the grape and they are pushing the funk."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep golden with heavy amber accents. In fact, this brew is nearly bronze. The thick, fluffy two finger clean white head has slightly above average retention and leaves behind some thin, delicate lacing. Grassy hops, mild pear, and general light earthiness. Grassy notes, very light hints of apricot, pearskin, and some accents of honey. Finishes dry and earthy with continued grassy hop notes. Light to light medium bodied with smooth, silky mouthfeel that feigns slightly heavier as the brew warms. Abundant, yet gentle carbonation. Subtlely complex and incredibly drinkable Aria joins Hommel Bier as another Perennial Belgian Pale Ale masterpiece."
""
""
"A nice sessionable beer that tastes nowhere near its ABV. This is dangerously drinkable but overall, the malt body is too much for me here. I'd revisit this one but its by no means one of the better offerings in its style."
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, somewhat higher carbonation, dry yet smooth on the tongue. Again, I tried about 5 of their beers in a row this evening and was impressed with every one."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy, light copper color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, slight floral hops, wet hops, sweet malt, spices, and slight dark citrus. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of spices, hops, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, great hoppy and spice blend in both aroma and body."
"I had high hopes for my first Perennial ale and was pretty disappointed. I’ll definitely try more by them though."
""
"O: A very approachable though rather simplistic beer. Flavor is sweet, yet under-Bretted (if there is such a word). Drinkable, but not worth the price."

"O - not something I'd purchase again at $12/750ml, but it was decent to try once. Too mild for me and it lacks complexity. If it was a $6 bomber, it would be a good value."
""
"Flavor of fruity belgian yeast...some slight noble hop and malts, but mostly belgian sweetness. Its an easy drinker, but like i find with lots of belgian pale's..they get heavy as they warm. Its a great belgian pale...not amazing but solid. Others mentioned some funk...i dont pick that up at all...wish I did; but nope. Still a nice brew, well crafted and solid. I just wouldnt pay the perennial price for a bomber of it...sorry."
"o - Overall a decent beer but I was disappointed. It was listed as a wild ale so I was expecting more funk and brett, but the brett that was there in the nose didn't mix great with burnt and roasted malts. If this is as expensice as some of their other 750ml bottles I'd say pass on it, but if you see it on tap it might be worth having once."
""
"Verdict: A very palatable Belgian Pale Ale from Perennial. Light and refreshing, easy to drink with an easy finish. It's not the most earth-shattering beer out there, but a well made beer that anyone who enjoys Belgian beer would like."
"A tasty Belgian Pale for sure and one I'll definitely have again."
""
"Pretty good BPA. I enjoy the heavier fruit notes slightly balanced by some earthy funk. Pretty refreshing and yummy brew."

"O - This is a very nice Belgian-style ale. Glad to find it on tap at 44 Stone in Columbia, MO."
"Overall: not impressed here. It's pretty plain. So far I am. It sure if the prior reviews of this brewery are up to par with what I am expieriencing."
