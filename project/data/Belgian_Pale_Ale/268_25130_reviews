"I'd like to try this a little fresher, because I pretty greatly enjoyed each bottle after the first—which was really just exorbitantly chunky sans straining—and each time I drank one, between intervals of months, I was surprised how well this beer had weathered the time since it'd been breweed."

"I expect much more for an artesan belgium beer. Too acid."
"After experiencing the amazing beer on tap at the Huisbrouwerij De Halve Maan, we tried it bottled in several restaurants in Bruges. Unfortunately the beer we'd tried was not available anywhere other than the actual brewery, and the bottled product, while very good, couldn't compare."
"Tons of carbonation making for a difficult pour and spritzy taste/feel. Pretty bland compared to other Belgians and slightly sour."

"Overall: If there's such a thing as a Belgian 'session' ale then this is probably fairly close. It sits slightly on the high side of average - worth a shot if you've not tried it before, but compared with the myriad other beers that Belgium has to offer there's not really much to single it out. The 'farting fool' labels are pretty cool, though."

"It pours into a nice head and amber color. Medium carbonation. No significant aroma or flavor other than a tiny bit flowery. At room temp the carbonation is gone and smells like a pilsener Urquell. Tastes like an Urquell but not so dry. Drink it while is cold and forget about it."

"Overall: A very good tasting beer. This is a spicy, sweet beer, with just enough hops to balance it out. The carbonation is like many Belgian Ales, not just  bubbly, but foamy to the mouth."
""
"Overall: a pretty decent Belgian Pale Ale, with plenty of quality Belgian yeasts and some fruits and spices. The only real detractor is the truly catastrophic price of AU$150+ for a case of 24 x 300mL (2013), which is pretty close to the most expensive of the 600 beers I have had thus far. I can probably run a list of at least 50 beers that are better than this and cost 30 - 40% less."

"330 ml. bottle. Deep golden colour, almost no head and vanishes quickly. Smell of fruits, spices, vanilla, apples. Round tongue, soft fruity palate. Taste of fruits, spices, liquor. My bottle is next to the expire date, so I guess I'll to taste another one, specially because of the poor head."

"Straffe Hendrik is a brewer from which you can expect both quality and consistency. Brugse Zot (""fool of Bruges"") doesn't joke around - it is a well-brewed, textbook Belgian Pale Ale that, having had the fortune of trying it so fresh from draught minutes from where it's brewed, I enjoyed so much so that it may be my personal choice for quintessential example of the style."
""
""
""
"The body was, as expected, on the light side of medium, a bit sticky in the middle, and had medium dry finish. Drinkability was pretty good, I could easily have several of these, but this is a style I like in general. Overall, a nice example of the style, worth a try if you see it."
""
"A rather lovely brew that goes down all too easily. It looks great, and the aroma/flavour are balanced and satisfying. Earthy, fruity yeast esters and subtle hop notes mingle to produce a solidly crafted Belgian pale ale. The body is spot on. Very drinkable, and if I lived in Belgium I could easily imagine this becoming a regular fridge beer. Well worth sampling if you come across it (though I recommend trying it in Bruges)."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep golden hue with a medium slowly fading off white head. Aroma and Taste is of biscuit malt, yeast, bread, some citrus and fruity notes, grains and a bit of grass. A medium body with mild carbonation on the palate. Finishes with a sweet biscuit malt, yeast, some fruity notes and some light bitterness on the end. Overall a good drinking session ale."

"Overall nice beer, cross between blond and wit with the better characters of each coming through, nice taste, dry finish, juicy center."
""
""
"Overall: A gentle but complex beer, with many nuances of aromas and flavors. Recommended."
"O-This is not a bad beer, but not a great one, either. The looks and mouthfeel are high points, but it is a touch sweet and cloying, and could use a little more hop for balance. Still, I err on the sweet side sometimes, so I wouldn't turn this down if someone offered me another."
""
""
"Asides from the above average smell and the beginning of the taste profile, this beers over abundance of unfiltered matter makes it feel like our drinking orang juice with extra pulp; I don't enjoy eating my beer. However, if one can get over the immense yeasty foreground and unfiltered matter, this beer will be The incarnate of God himself"
"Not much of a Belgian classic, but more of a Bruges classic. Some sources say that it's the only beer to actually be brewed in the city, and believe it or not, is actually lagered."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, candied fruit, and some subdued spice aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grape juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid fruity aromas and flavors."

"330 ml bottle, poured into a tulip glass at home. Beer is refermented in the bottle. ABV 6%. Colour is deep orange golden, with a big head on top. Three fingers of it, white and sopay with good retention. Nice aroma, fruits, mostly peaches, some bubblegum and yeast too. Taste is sweet upfront with lots of fruity flavours, again bubblegum but not as intense as on the aroma and some hops too. Aftertaste is bitter and slighty metallic. Lots of carbonation on this one, while medium thin on the body. Overall very refreshing beer, very drinkable and tasteful. Could be even better with a bit les carbonation, but nevertheless, very enjoyable."
""
""
"O- This beer is a nice crisp dry beer with the esters adding some perceived sweetness that gives this nice depth and it is still very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Surprise Belgian beer I never heard of before. Pours a slightly hazy light gold amber color, bubbly white head. Aroma is yeasty, malt, banana, cloves, lemon, and pear. Flavors suggest the same - along with malty, bready and nice light yeast notes. Cloudy medium thick and sticky mouthfeel. An enjoyable quaffable pale ale for the Belgian style."
"It's not terrible, but it's not something I'd want to try again either."

"This is an excellent Pale Ale. Seek it out. A good amount of flavour and complexity, nicely balanced in keeping to the style. Drinks very well."
"O- a nice beer, though not my favorite Belgian. The Czech hops and low esters make it come of more as an imperial pils than a Belgian blonde. It was nice to try but I probably won't search it out again."

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Caracole small snifter. Pours orange amber with a thick white head with attractive uniform bubbles, completely fills the glass and looks nice. Massive lacing. Light sour fruit aroma. Very mild, almost wheat-like start with very light malt and distinct yeast. Semi dry middle with some spice and a dry abrupt finish. Slight hops. Very subdued. Nice for a change and worth a revisit."

"Overall: Nothing remarkable here, move on."

"Pours clear and yellow with a medium head. Everything you expect from a BPA. Relatively low in alcohol, but not weak in taste. Bitter and robust, simply yummy. Recommendable to anyone who enjoys a nice pilsner or a Pale Ale. A beautiful marriage of both, it seems."
""
"O: Easily drinkable with a nice body."
"Overall, this is a fairly refreshing, easy drinking beer. There really isn't a whole lot going on but it is pleasant to drink."

"Poured from 33 cl bottle into La Trappe chalice. Love the artwork on bottle. A gift from Sully's road trip to Belgium. Poured a fluffy white light almost white ridged head. Abt 2 inches. Light golden and mostly clear consistency. Slightly sweet taste with hints of wheatiness sugars and some spiciness. Smell is somewhat phenolic and wheaty. Mouthfeel is light and carbonated and dry. Overall a nice Nelgium pale with mild dry and slight grassy tones"

"Far too active to do anything but knock back in the summer. A cafe table beer, which I suspect is the purpose. Good in context, but you can get more out of your Belgian PA."

"An eh beer from an otherwise trustworthy brewery in my favorite Belgian town. This one has plenty of aroma but very little in terms of taste. In fact, it has virtually no flavor when cold. I heated it up on a radiator for about 30 minutes; when warm it gained some cloves and a little fruit. Overall, the low levels of Belgianness would, if amplified several times, amount to a really nice beer. In its current state, however, it's just dull."

"Served from bottle into a Bell's stemmed tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, wheat, and a subtle floral note. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, fruit, floral, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. While this a was a good brew it wasn't very memoriable. I would have loved to see this one have some more complexity to carry it to a new level. The flavors present were nice, but they definitely needed some other components going on to make them 'pop'. Worth trying if you are a fan of the style, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so again."
"O: Not a bad Belgian Pale Ale ,very drinkable, a little on the pricey side, Worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"Fragrant nose of both hops and slightly bitter citrus. The mouth is powerful, slightly alcoholic palate with a fruity syrup and sorbet recalls peach. In the aftertaste, there are drought, with a touch of hops, but still in the cold. A beer strong enough, with many flavors, which is a model of its kind."
"Overall: Nice drink"
"Notes: Definitely has a unique, hard to describe character that makes Belgian's wonderful. Definitely not to a 'style'. Its oddness and the metallic dryness hurt drinkability a touch for me but its flavor combinations, while not dynamic, are very interesting. You particularly get the feeling with this beer that the brewer's really don't care what I write about this beer…. And I like that."
"O- A nice refreshing and quaffable beer. It's overall sweetness is probably too dominant and gets quite boring after a while"
"Some beers do age well. Unfortunately this bottle, for whatever reason, has not."
"Pours a bright clody gold, rich white froth and some lace. Aroma of peppery belgian yeast, candi sugar and some flowery hop. Tastes like a clean blonde, slightly sweet, lemony/herbal touch, little to no bite. Belgian yeast adds a subtle fruityness. Alittle sweet, but mellow and easy drinking for a decent sized beer. Semi dry mouthfeel. Consider it a nice blonde."
"O: Good beer. Recommended"
"O: Not my cup of tea"
"D: I cannot recommend this beer. Perhaps my bottle is a bit off, or it's not to my taste, but I didn't enjoy the experience. I won't be repeating it. Still, it's not *bad*."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink but I'm not sure if I would try this again because the taste wasn't very interesting."
"Drinkability: a step down from a triple. This could be a much better beer if bumped up a bit on the abv."
"Pint at Belgos. 1 finger head, paler than other beers I know from belgium, clear. Smelled of belgian yeast. Had the same slightly sour berry taste that other belgian pale ales have, there was also some wheat . The body was smooth. This was the most sessionable belgian beer i've had so far. Not overly complex but good"
"d - highly drinkable and decent beer."
"D - Great beer. Very drinkable, goes down easy but with some nice flavors. All the notes are subtle but still appreciated."
"Drink- I'll have this again. I liked it a lot."
"Very good choice for a sessionbeer. In a bar."
"D - A nice little BPA; one I wouldn't mind having again."
"Light malt flavor with a definitive yeast bite. Warm swallow, but not really strong on the alcohol. Full bodied with a predictable level of carbonation. Only demerit is a short aftertaste without any notable hop flavoring other than for balance."
"M/D: Well carbonated, medium body, smooth. This was a nice brew, although I was expecting more for the money."
"From tasting notes made September 2009."
"D: Goes down very easily, quite tasty, this is a perfect warm spring or summer day beer."
"D- Very drinkable. Goes down very smooth. Could drink this all day on a lazy afternoon."
"belgian yeast really plays well in every aspect from the nose to the throat. bready, spicy, fruity and gets along with the other kids, malt and hops. recommended."
"This was a good light pale ale. There was still some malt body on the tongue, despite the light taste. The bitter aroma was in the nose, but less yeasty than the Tripel of this brewery. Unfiltered, and the wheat that is used in the recipe comes out with the twinge of light sweetness."
"O: too much honey sweetness"
"Taste is not bad and I think I can get past the plethora of floaties, we shall see upon subsequent pours. Taste is light and delicate. Hints of green apples and overripe plums. Well carbonated and goes down pretty easily. Yeast does most of the work for this beer and the esters it produces are pretty pleasant. Malt is light and a bit grainy, but pretty neutral overall. There is a noticeable hop bitternes and even a bit of flavor, but keeps it on the down low despite playing a significant roll in the beer. If it wasn't for the chunks of sediment I can feel passing through my lippage gateway, this would be a fine Belgium beer."
"D. The drikability was excellent. After a few days of tripels and quadtruples this beer was a pleasant hiatus. But at 6% it goes down a little too easy so beware."
"Serving type: 33 cl bottle"
"Not a bad beer, and one I'd be happy to visit again."
"the beer pours a cloudy gold, with a good head but no lacing. The smell is passive, with hints of apple, bread and Belgian yeast. The taste is but rather refreshing with fruits (apples & orange) and kind of a bread malt flavor and a hint of hop. The mouth feel is very light and packed with carbonation. With the lightness and the carbonation make this beer very quaffable. I could drink a few more"
"D: If not for the great selection at Cafe Bruges, I'd have stuck with this mild pale ale."
"I enjoyed this one - its a nicely made and easy drinking Belgian beer. Well worth a try."
"Taste - This is a very below average Belgian Blonde. Slight taste of apricot, not good."
"D - Pretty drinkable and complex for a beer of this strength. The yeast character is nice, though the bubblegum character is a bit much."
"I was a little disappointed...was expecting more from this belgian."
"Notes: Great to have it unfiltered at the Brewery in Brugge. You simply cannot find it better than that!"
"Drinkability: so-so, except when you calculate the price. I expected something exciting for the $22 ($24 with tax)."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice sour-style beer that is worth drinking for a while but there are others that I would pick first."
"D - Overall a great quaff. I'd probably reclassify this as a Belgian blonde due to coloration and subtle hop characteristics."
"D: This is a light, drinkable beer. Not overly complex, but sweet and easy to drink."
"a off golden with a bit murk. sweet lemon odor. no musk really. at first smells quite crisp with a nice tight head of bubble that dissipate. taste is a mild lemon hop with a bit of mint and lavender. not very assertive. light drink but nothing special for the price on this side of the water."
"On-tap in Ghent. Another tasty Belgian pale ale. Appeared a pretty gold in the Zot semi-chalice. This had a medium-thickness mouthfeel like you'd expect for a 6% beer, but the flavor was lighter and seemed to lift the beer up to a more drinkable standard. Typical, but fresh, Belgian malt and spice flavors. An excellent standard of a beer."
"The aroma is fruity and metallic with malt, spice, and yeast. The appearance is golden with a large head. The flavor has bananas, cloves, malt, spice, and grass. The palate is thin. Overall an interesting but average beer. I thought it had a couple of nice qualities but it's not something I want often."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, but just not my type of thing. Overall, pretty plain and not a whole lot going on."
"It poured a slightly under ripe peach, with some visible floaters and some mild carbonation. The head was initially large, and held well; spotty lacing. The nose was yeast, spice, and a hint of alcohol. Taste was straightforward Belgian pale ale -- noticeable spice, Belgian yeast, and a nice bit of hop bitterness. The carbonation was mild, and at 6%, very drinkable. Overall, a solid BPA."
"Poured into an oversized wine glas a slight hazed golden with some peach color hue,a nice 1/2 finger sticky white head atop.A mix of spice and some mineral-like aromas I thought the fruity notes were subdued but were noticeable.Flavors are tilted to the spice as well but a decent herbal hop smack comes thru in the finish.Not overly complex,pretty straight forward but not all that bad."
"great beer. in the same vein as delirium but more drinkable. great head and just enough carbonation. amore is wonderful, sweet fruit-based overtones. vanilla smells. too much sediment for me. get more interesting on each sip. would recommend this beer and would down one again any time. It is marked as a 6% much feels more like a 8%. pleasant acidic dry alcohol after taste."
"M/D: Nice, active carbonation. Highly drinkable, but best sipped to enjoy its complexities."
"Date consumed: 20 July 2008"
"Not bad - but, a bit too metallic and crackery for me to really enjoy. Carbonation just a bit too inconsistent overall. Still, it does have some nice qualities - a good balance, interesting fruitiness. Pretty good, but with so many great Belgians out there, I probably wouldn't choose it again, though glad to have tried it."
"This one's very drinkable. And you can get a 33cl bottle in Bruges grocery stores for less than 1 euro....!"
"750ml, corked, caged, and canned for good measure. It forms a VERY agressive head, thick and soapy white over a clear effervescent pale gold. The smell is soapy (power of suggestion?), sugary, and full of clean grains. The taste is pleasantly chalky, with a sharp hop note at first and then a pleasant malt back & a bone dry finish that hints of oranges and floral hops. The mouthfeel is not as carbonated as it looks but certainly not lacking. It is slick but light. Drinkability is good, not too assertive to have a few. All in all, a nice pale ale & a good alternative to Duvel, albeit in a much higher price range. It is subtle but well-crafted."
"Pours a clear blush/ light amber color with a very thin head that quickly dissapears. Bland aroma of light crisp fruit and subtle spice notes. Very watered down with light fruit flavors( apple, pear) and slight spiciness.."
"Pours a cloudy gold with orange hues and a 3 finger white extra cloudy head that settles to a 1/2 finger head that remains with patchy lacing. Aromas of cloves, banana, lemon and honey. Light body, medium high carbonation this is sweet and dry beer with orange, vanilla, sweet malt and an earthy hop flavor. Good drinkability, the balance of the hops keeps the sweetness in line."
"D: Drinkable but for the price there are definitely better Belgian options out there. Can't say that I'll be having again."
"D: It was a complex beer that may have benefited from a bit more aging. The aggressive carbonation was a turn off but the flavors were spot on and it was a nice light and low ABV ale that could go long into a session."
"this beer pours up a nice golden color with a small white head...the nose consists of grains and slight honey, pretty straight forward...the taste is of sweet pale malts, crisp hops, honey, medium body, very spritzy carbo..."
"Taste is a bit watery at first, but it settles in nicely. Good dry and spiciness, and the carbonation cuts thorugh and tingles. Dry powdery chalk is kinda in there, but it's not prevailant. It's a damn fine beer, good sour/bitter qualities, and as it warms up (and de-carbonates) I get a lot more nuances."
"the drinkability is a solid 4, with a very quenching quality, but also a lot flavor. this beer keeps it pretty simple, but it works very well."
"Poured into my St. Bernardus Watou glass a nice cloudy dark yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus white fizzy/foamy head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some spiceness and pears. The taste is sweet, malty/yeasty, some pears, and spices. Medium body. Drinkable, this is my first from this brewery, and it's a nice one."
"I got this beer as a present in a huge decorated can with a 75 cl corked bottle inside. Ignoring the ""fris opdienen"" (serve cool) directive I opened the bottle at room temperature and was rewarded with a loud ""pop"" as the cork all but flew off. After pouring it in a Westmalle chalice (horror!) the head that formed was very thin but persistent. The color is a nice crystal clear yellow. It's got a lovely sweet and fruity smell. The taste has a hint of bitterness in it, and has the same sweetness (honey?) as the smell. I found it very pleasant. There is quite a bit of carbonation which could be due to the high drinking temperature."
"D- I don't dislike this beer, but not on my session list. I would like to try more Belgian Pale Ales. The only other I have had has the JP Firefly. Gotta expand my tastebud horizons."
"D - Refreshing summer beer, made for better weather than Belgium offers."
"Enough lighter than a BSPA to be just about right, still pretty good thickness and overall heft. Plenty of hopping, which is nice. Well attenuated and quenching to the palate."
"Pours a clear pale golden color with huge fizzy white head that resists fading. Kept alive by visible effervescence, spotty patterns of Belgian lacing in its wake. The smell is an earthy yeast with banana and harvest fruits. Tingling fizzy, the mouth feel is light. The earthy banana flavor is strong and complemented by a fruity pear character. At 6% ABV it's session-able. Nice holiday tin. Take it for a ride."
"This is a good Belgian but not a brilliant one. The beer pours a fairly cloudy yellow with clumps, and I mean clumps of free floating yeast. This isn't yeasty bits but quite significant pieces from its unfiltered bottle fermentation. I'm not sure if that is such a good thing. The smell is typically Belgian in that you get the sweet candied malts, some florals, and some rind. The taste is all of the above with quite a yeast effervescence, some spices such as clove, and a slightly sourish malty taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and it balances well with the carbonation. The beer has quite a frothy white head that lingers throughout. The aftertaste is modest as is its ABV. This isn't a strong beer nor an overly complex one, but it is good drinking. L'Chaim."
"Oh, and at$6.75 a bottle, I won't order one of these at Brewhaus again!"
"D-this one is good for a single glass at a time,nothing super going on here,but pretty enjoyable as well,give it a try"
"Decent, but not quite what I was hoping for."
"Mouthfeel is typical as well with nice carbonation."
"D: A nice BPA, though the flavour profile overall was too light for me at times, definitely worth a shot, I'd definitely drink it again."
"Not sure the classification is correct, as I would call it a Belgian Blonde, but since we don't have that category, 'Pale Ale' will have to do. Taste even veers towards a witbier. Golden color, medium head, funky aroma of yeast and phenolic and more yeast. Decently carbonated and easy, easy drinking, the 6% ABV being undetectable. I'm probably going to suck down this whole 750 ml bottle myself tonight!"
"Mouth feel: Rich and full, quite excellent."
"Drinkability- Quite nice."
"Pours a clear yellow with slight orange colors, a peachy slight haze and great white head that leaves good lace. Nose is vinous and sour. Taste follows the nose and is quite sour with some almost white wine notes. Some spices here and some apple flavors on the extremely dry finish. Almost sour on the finish but in a good way with granny smith tones. Mouthfeel is good but sour. Drinkability is good, but the sourness detracts from it just a bit."
"Pours a hazed straw gold with a bright white head that does not stick around. Nose is like soap and light yeast. Flavor is sweet and smooth with a fruity tone to it. Strong sweet character. I really like the mouthfeel on this one. At first the carbonation was so alive that bubbles were bouncing on my tongue. Very drinkable. An easily sessionable beer...if not for the price."
"Flavor is underwhelming. Not much in the way as to the style described. Just some sweet malts. Rather light. Change the yeast and we'd have an al-alt lager I think. Probably a pretty good one too but as a BPA this beer is missing some flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and light bit the carbonation is a bit too much. Drinkable because it is nice and light but not a particularly memorable beer."
"Review added 11-10-2007, translated from french 1-27-2008."
"Being easy to drink is what this beer excels at. Not overly complex and it is a bit pricey but it is worth a try."
"This is decent, but nothing special in a world of Belgian beers that kick its ass. Certainly easy to drink, I'd never turn it away, glad I tried it, but there are more convincing examples of the style out there."
"Flavor is a different story. Bananas, pears, apples and clove spice. A touch of pepper spice and some nice sourness round everything out. This is spot on for the style and offers everything I want. Mildly wheaty with a noticeable amount of hops, noble perhaps? Light and crisp body. Clean. Well done and highly drinkable. Very well balanced."
"Sweet, light spice and sessionability is ok. Not my idea of highly drinkable, but passable and I would try this again. Overall a bit dissapointing, but still better than average."
"Source: The Belgian Shop. Expirey 2009. Immediate horse blanket that of course overwhelms taste. Lots of creamy foam on a light beige/golden body. some sweet yeast. Nothing exceptional, a poor Belgian. Medium or lighter lagery mouthfeel, suitably carbonated."
"Bottle, at Zot Restaurant, Philadelphia. golden amber, with a moderate sized off-white head that declined fairly quickly. Aroma of wheat, yeast, and citrus. Nicely balanced flavor; yeast, herbs, anise, citrus, malt and floral flavors complement each other very well. tasty and refreshing."
"Pours a five-finger+ white pillowy head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Murky cloudy amber color with a lot of chunky bits. Slight spicy/grapefruit nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is spicy and slightly sour. Clean finish. $4.39 for a 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"This is a summers day drink, there are so many very good Belgian ales out there, that this one is just above mid-table in my opinion. The better ones can be taken all year, not just in the warm weather."
"The bottle came in a big golden can, reminiscent of a fine scotch, so my expectations were rather high. Inside the can, was the bottle, corked and caged, as most self-respecting blondes are wont to do in Europe. It pours a nice vigorous head, dissipating very rapidly, leaving behing a very cloudy-looking (yeasty?) golden brew. The smell is very faint, if anything, a bit of citrus, perhaps. The taste is strikingly similar to the great ciders of the north and northwest of France, with a mixture of well-balanced blonde Belgian beer. I'm not certain how they brewed this, but great brut cider apples are definitely an outcome of the flavor, and if these were not somehow involved I'd be rather amazed. The mouthfeel is nice, generating carbonation on the tongue, and the drinkability is exceptional, as this goes down without any complaints from the tongue or throat, leaving a nice aftertaste of...well, cider. Overall, I'm not sure whether or not I've just had a cider or a beer. I would not call this a great blonde beer of Belgium, since this would have to stand on its own merits alone and pound its chest as a blonde. But not bad at all!"
"D: Perfect for a hot summer day/night. Pretty low ABV @ 6%, so ya, this one is fit for a session if you can handle a sweet brew all night."
"The beer tastes lightly, well not it is fairly sweet, but it is deceptive as it is quite light on the palate. The flavor is grassy with notes of hay; these notes seem to be derived from both the malt / grain character as well as the particular hop choice. This beer has a really nice, pale malt character to it; the combination of malt sweetness, biscuit notes and touches of soda crackers really compliments the grassy hop notes. This tastes like a cross between a malt accented, yet still quite hoppy, pils and a Belgian ale, which is I suppose quite what the brewer was attempting. It is very easy drinking and I can definitely see quaffing a few of these on a seasoned Summer day."
"M+D: Very good beer, nice bitter bite and well balanced. Great for pretzels with spicy mustard. Would def. be a great session beer."
"Drinkability- Refreshingly balanced brew. Could use just a touch more spice. Definite session pale if there is such a thing. Recommended for sure."
"M&D - drinkable, yes, mouthfeel, good, a rather impressice belgian, im not talking high high levels, but still hig quality and a good drinking beer"
"Drinkability: so-so at best. From a drinking standpoint it is easy to quaff, but the flavor profile is just dull and unexciting. Personally one glass was more than enough for me."
"Pours attractive golden straw with a small but superbly creamy head and lace. The beer is very active in the glass and has a touch of yeasty haze. The aroma displays lime, green grass, hop, and earth notes. Flavor never really comes together. Begins with rounded honey-like malt, develops a shallow hop and grass center, and finishes with an unpleasing metallic sourness. Light-to-medium in body. Some chewiness balances the too-gassy carbonation. Great looking, but mediocre tasking."
"Overall Impression: Once Im past the metallic note, I enjoyed the beer. A nice reminder of Brugge."
"Drinkability: Very appropriate for the style. I enjoyed the beer but at the price point I don't think I will be drinking this much."
"Drinkability: Not a bad choice Nothing really crazy going on with the beer fairly balanced."
"...whichever you pick will do a lot better than my mistaken purchase!"
"D: I found this to be very drinkable. Take the aromas and flavors and mix it a rather low abv and you end up with quite a refreshing BPA. Don't let the low score (82 when I reviewed it) scare you off. I found this little beer to be complex enough and satisfying. Would be a perfect session beer for sipping on all day, while doing work around the house, when you actually need to complete the tasks at hand (try doing that with Duvel or Delirium!)"
"Tasted like a cross between a Duvel and a Delerium. Highly drinkable - I finished two with dinner at a local Belgian restaurant. Poured a good-looking golden brown, with a decent creamy head. Fairly low in carbonation, and very refreshing. Despite the 6% ABV, I found I to be quite light. Defintely worth a try if you come across one. Neat looking bottle graphic too."
"D: Interesting beer. I bet there's some people out there who really like this one. For me, its a bit unbalanced and I don't find myself enticed to drink it. For each their own."
"Online purchase, poured in tulip golden and with a very nice white lacey head. Light sweet fruity smell with some mild spicy overtones. Very typical of a Belgian blond ale. Mouthfeel was a tad thinner than I would like, but hey its a blond! No regrets except that they're gone. Pricey, but I don't remember the last time I found a Belgian on this side of the ocean that wasn't!"
"Drinkability: Crisp, with a light fruitiness and some nice hoppiness."
"Overall a good beer, but not up to some other similar (but far superior) beers from that wonderful corner of the world."
"Notes: First time I've seen this brew and I got it at a high priced shop so I'm sure they got a pretty nice profit at $4 for 11 ounces. A good beer that I would need to find cheaper to have anytime soon."
"I wasn't too impressed by this beer, too sweet and sticky with too much gas, which really slow down drinkability."
"Draft at De Halve Maan on 9/14/06, called Brugse Zot Blond there."
"Mouth is spot on for style. Enough body and carbonation to show balance. A beer this tasty and complex can only be very drinkable. I'm giving it a five as it all comes together nicely."
"Brugse Zot (fool of Bruges) is one of the better Belgian pales ales that has entered my glass in quite a while. At $3.49, it's a bit expensive for regular consumption, but I'm glad that it's available locally and that I can grab a bottle whenever the mood strikes. Good beer."
"I liked this brew for what it was - a simple, highly drinkable session beer. Did it blow me away with complexity? No. But ya know what, it wasnt meant to."
"Big carbonation initially that settles down towards the finish, medium in the body and quite easy too drink. It's worth a try, but a bit pricey for what you get."
"Drinkability: A subtle but complex beer; the blend of sweet and herbacious bitter flavors is well-executed"
"I would say this was a lighter than in color than I expected, with the slightest bit of haze. Initially I noticed the spices and honey that came out from the foam. There was plenty of tiny thick foam bubbles which lasted longer than I expected and left a nice lace around the glass. The taste was a bit fruity peaches, pears, and apricots, spices like pepper, coriander, orange-peel could be tasted, and malt made a bit of a presence but did not steal the show. The mouthfeel was silky smooth, leaving behind a bit of an alcohol presence that seemed fairly strong for the taste. Strength and alcohol seemed to increase as the glass emptied. The finish left me a little less satisfied than the I anticipated upon the initial sip."
"A new offering by Pazzo's Pizza Pub here in Lexington. Predictably Belgian Pale Ale in character; beginning with a lightly hazy, brightly colored yellow hue and spicy, honey-like aromas. Overcompensation with the head retention and carbonation, leaving a loosely knit foamy head. Tastes typically fruity (peaches, pears, pineapples, and apricots), spicy (pepper, corriander, orange-peel), and malty (pilsner, honey-like). Fairly smooth, rich texture with an alcohol that seems more than the labled 6%. Finishes a little on the dry and alcoholic side, but satsfying nonetheless. A good comparison to Duvel; just not as bold or melded."
"Mouthfeel is a little light for this style; the bold carbonation helps give it a little more substance, but its a little weak. Weakest of all is the flavor. Or, perhaps its delicate? Dried bananas and perhaps some green veggies come through (peas?). The flavor is overall unimpressive and as the Belgians say, un peu plat. Its very drinkable, and I would replace it as my keg beer any day, but unless it costs 1.50 euros or less (which I purchased it for at the marvel known as the supermarkets in the Lowlands) I would skip this one. There are thousands of brilliant examples of Belgium craftsmanship, and this is not one of them."
"Brugse Zot? Erm, Not!!"
"M&D: the mouthfeel is quite refreshing, without too much influence of sugar and overly strong flavour like quite a few Belgian strong pale ale counterparts. But this advantage of being simple and light is somehow played into the other extreme of tasting rather dull, watery and lack of depth. Overall, not a bad beer, but much more boring than their own Straffe Hendrik--a dumbed-down version perhaps??(sheer guessing, no offence intended)"
"BB may 07. Presentation is overwelming; opening the cage was enough to let the cork fly out with quiet an explosion. Nice and good head, overwelming but not lasting that well. Nose is malts and a litle sulphuric sharp edge from yeast. Very clean but not much arome overal. Taste is strong alcoholic, tard, bodyless and uninspiring. Very dry and watery caracter and also missing hops and bitterness. Mouthfeel is also empty and IMO too high carbonated. Drinkable but very average and uninspiring."
