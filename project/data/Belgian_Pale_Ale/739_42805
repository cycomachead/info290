The taste and smell are also like a lambic or geuze, but the sourness is somewhat milder, probably caused by the blending with a flemish old brown beer. I was not a fan of sour beer in the beginning, but this beer has me started to appreciate the sourness.","Wanne","Dec 27, 2014"

3.9,-7.1,,,,,," The tasteis very tart like a juicy grapefruit mixed with malt and carbonated with zesty lightly hoppy flavor and dry woody character with some mild tannin and gentle flavor from the barrel. The taste is slightly sharp with mild toasted flavor which I suspect is part of the blend with finish acidic almost like biting into a grapefruit rind. Overall very good-nothing bad about this but a bit raw and bitter fresh, perhaps a little aging may help some of the sour flavors conflict for me but very decent overall.","Slatetank","Aug 15, 2014"

The flavors are surprisingly VERY sour and tart. I expected it to be sour, just not this much. It's very impressive. It is straight fermented sour peaches and apricots.

There's a splash of vinegar as well, just enough to keep the palate bright without being overbearing. The bulk of the sourness is lemony, though, and almost whelms the funk. Drying on the finish with a lingering lemon peel sourness and a touch of bitterness, this beer is a hidden gem. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, the palate is a little slicker than I'd like, but otherwise, this is an outstanding beer.

I just want to keep on drinking this cellar temp beer in this hot humid New England weather. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer it reminds me more of a gueuze than a belgian pale-ale.

4.22,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Reviewed from my notes. A chilled bottle was split four ways between tulip glasses with the De Ranke logo. The beer is opaque, with a creamsicle/orange color. There is a thin, splotchy foam head. The bubbles are white and soap-like. The nose lets you know this is a sour beer. There's apricot and brett (or something that smells like a beer brewed with it) in there. I like the aroma a lot. The flavor is a good mixture of puckering sour and mildly sweet fruit. I can taste apricot and peach. It has a great musty and dry finish. It is ever so slightly chalky tasting, mainly in the finish. This is a very good sour beer. It has a medium body and a very low amount of carbonation. There is a slight coating of the mouth that tastes both sweet and sour. The first thing I jotted down about the Cuvee De Ranke's drinkability is "oh so drinkable," and I stand by that simple assessment. Obviously it will turn off anyone not prepared for a sour beer, but a fan of this style will love this. If you see a bottle, definitely pick it up.","ToasterChef","Mar 21, 2010"

The aroma, as said before, is riddled with notes of tangy sourness and wild yeast.

The finish gives spotlight to the carbonation and it retains a passion fruit, maybe mango fruit finish. Again, faint bile, but in a good way (if there is such a thing).","yemenmocha","Aug 24, 2008"
4.88,16.2,5,4.5,5,5,5,"pours up a reddish peach color with a decent size white head. also sporting some great lacing. the nose has sours notes, subtle fruits, dark red fruits in particular. the taste is sour, oaky, slightly musty, red fruits. has a medium body, low carbo, definately a scrumptious beer","stumac","Aug 14, 2008"
4.32,2.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is really extremely drinkable. I have minimal experience with sours so this is really a great intro to them, I would say, as the blending keeps the sourness in check a bit. I really enjoyed this. Recommended for sure.","number1bum","Jul 05, 2008"

4.7,11.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I wonder what the base beer for this is? There seems to be a fair amount of residual hop character, including a herbal hop flavor and it make me wonder if the XX Bitter was included somewhere in here. Just a fantastic beer, it is very sour and funky, but not really "hard" and it is significantly different from the typical sour Belgian varieties of Lambic or Flemish Sour. It doesn't have the malt depth of the latter, nor is it quite as funky/sour or pale (in malt character and fruitiness) as the former. A singular beer that makes me think of some of the new world sours, but it has a refined quality to it (perhaps it is the lack of overt / aggressive oak) that many of the American sours don't quite reach. I could drink a ton of this and actually wish I had more than this one bottle so I could age a couple (that 2012 best by date seems to be calling to me).","Gueuzedude","Jun 14, 2008"
4.22,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - A real treat. A nice blend that ends up as a more mellow lambic with a touch more fruit/lemon flavors. Highly drinkable.","brewcrew76","May 21, 2008"

4.45,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mellow citric lemony sourness, similar to a Gueuze. The Lambic edge is taken off from the Blonde Ale blend, which lets the subtle woody notes of the Girardin Lambic come through. Long aftertaste, sort of woody with wet citrus notes present too. Mild pucker, not as sour as other traditional Lambics, but sour-haters should stay away. The more I drank, the more I enjoyed it. This creative hybrid sour ale is definitely worth trying.","emerge077","0"
