"Good representation of the style."
"So,  I may be a bit biased because I got twelve packs of this stuff for $9.99 on clearance in early summer of 2014.  Didn't expect much but really hit the spot, typical belgo pale flavors nothing stood out but a good warm weather quaff."

"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, with a slightly sticky finish. High levels of carbonation finish this off. Overall, it's a decent brew but not something I'd reach out for again. Fairly laid-back and one dimensional, but refreshing."

"O- Pleasant light summer ale. Good working in the yard kind of beer. Nothing crazy about it, but just a good kick back after work and relax kind of brew."

"Huge, dense white foam head, like three fingers, but fades quickly. Bright and lively in the glass, surprisingly clear for a Blegian-style. Golden straw with tangerine highlights. Smell is a creamy doughiness, grassiness, hoppy florals. Quite aromatic and appetizing. Taste is right up there with what you might want in a spring-seaon ale; crisp, clean and simple. Pale malt bill right upfront with a not-to-bitter hop finish. Not much else, but quite good. A nice reminder that simple beers can be great, too."

"O-A boring bland beer. Not much good. I guess not being awful is a good thing."

"O - New Belgium's Spring Blonde might not have a ton of malt flavor. Its also light on the hoppiness, though floral aspects emerge. It doesn't even come straightforward with its Belgian yeast nuances but, what Spring Blonde does have is exceptional balance among these attributes. The finished product has just enough flavor to command interest but not enough to make multiple beers a chore - this one is a crisp and refreshing for an easy drinking, well-crafted experience."

"Got a free bottle of this one from my beer guy, not something I'd normally try. This offering pours a very clear golden hue with a foamy white head that leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is that of sweet belgian yeast, lemon juice, and biscuit malts. The mouthfeel is light and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Flavors follow the nose with Belgian yeast and lemon upfront. It is a very light and refreshing pour, especially for the adv. Drinks like a light beer at best. This is a refreshing enjoyable summertime beer but lacks complexity or depth. Good but overly simple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –While a bit light in the Belgian spice, the Belgian malt was quite nice and made for an interesting and overall nice drinking brew."
""
""

"This beer pours a nice golden color and has a pretty solid taste. For me it was especially tasty on a recent hot day. It is very refreshing and I would encourage those that enjoy Belgian blonde ales to give this one a try because it is one of the better ones that I have had. New Belgium does good stuff and this one does not disappoint."
""
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, with a nice little one-finger creamy white head, leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes. The taste is also yeasty and malty. Medium body, with a slightly dry/bitter finish. Overall a nice summer brew."

"This ""Blonde"" tastes like a Pilsner with a higher ABV. Strange - I had it on tap initially and enjoyed it, in that form the alcohol was evident but it was refreshing and sweet. In the bottle, Pilsner sneak attack. Blech. A real swing and a miss from New Belgium."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by May 18, 2014."
"for what it is, it's one of the best you're ever gonna find under 1.50$ a bottle."
""
"The taste of Spring Blonde was overwhelming...and not in a good way! I struggled through the first bottle of the six pack, hoping it would grow on me, and then dumped the rest down the drain. What a disappointment...I would highly recommend that you DO NOT try this beer! I have been extremely happy with all other New Belgium beers that I have purchased but this one seems to miss the target...so disappointing! :("

"OVERALL: a very drinkable beer, a good Fourth of July beer, I could serve this to any beer drinker and it would not offend anyone, solid but not spectacular."

"O: Another good brew from New Belgium.... Good ABV and great flavors makes this a beer worth looking for."
""
"This beer is really a great beer. Although it lacks super strong flavor, what it does have is better than average flavor that I love. It's like Samuel Adams Boston Lager a little watery. It's the perfect beer to introduce your idiot friends to so they know what real beer should taste like."
""
""
""
"Overall I found this and a few other ""New Belgium"" ales at Vintage Estate. This one was good but not as good at Fat Tire or that ""Lips of Faith"" beer I had."
"Thanks for the brew, Kirk!"

""
""
"D: Not a bad beer but pretty simple and uninteresting. Its burpy and can satisfy on a hot day in that this is refreshingly crisp."

"A decent beer, pleasant taste but the flavors seemed a bit muted, and had nothing particularly memorable."

"Pours close to a straw-yellow with about a half finger white head. Some spotty lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of grains with a hint of lemon peel. The taste is a bit more bold than the aroma with lots going on but easy to drink with a good taste. Goes down easy with no harsh or bitter aftertaste. A great new spring brew introduced this year."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a light clear gold with a thick pillowy white head. The head has great retention and last throughout the beer leaving nice lacing. The aroma is mild, with some light notes of grass and green apples. The taste is also mild, but a little more forthright than the aroma, with a pleasant biscuit flavor balanced against some fruity sweetness and a slight earthy hops lingering in the background. A little thinner on the palate, this is an easy-drinking but nicely flavored spring ale."
""
"Overall, a decent thirst quencher but this beer is severely lacking in aroma and flavor. It just isn't that interesting."

"12 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, best before 5/25/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, cracker, bread, light honey, clove, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice and pleasant flavors with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Belgian blonde ale. Good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
"Pale color with a slight haze.. almost like a wheat beer. Smell is lemon..cracker.. bread yeast.. wheat.. pale malt.. the taste is lemon cookie/cracker.. sweet with a bitter finish but not hoppy. The body is medium to slightly thick. I like this beer.. perfect for spring.. nice body to match the cool weather"

"O: This one's slightly better than I anticipated. While the Belgian yeast is almost a non-factor, it's still a decent beer thanks to the mild bitterness and easy-drinking nature. It's not amazing or complex, but it'll get the job done. Worth trying."

"This was a very surprisingly good beer. I am always wary of beers that are bitter, such as IPAs, as this one claims to be bitter. Well, it was just the right amount of bitter and everything else. Great golden color with perfectly white head. The head goes away, but it has very nice lacing all the way down. The only disappointment was the smell - there wasn't much there to distinguish it from other beers. The rest though, taste and mouthfeel was terrific. A very bold, crisp feel over the tongue to go along with the bold, crisp taste. Very nice offering from New Belgium."
"Appearance has a light golden yellow supporting a white head slowly dissipating leaving fair lace. Smell is very light of Belgian spice from the yeast and a notable malt aroma. Taste is again light in the Belgian spice and having a nice balance with the malt and hops. Mouthfeel is medium light with good carbonation. A nice easy drinker for the upcoming spring season."
"Overall- Just above average but a little off for the style. Nothing special but you might want to give at try."

"Pours a pale straw color with thin white head. Nose features some mellow Belgian esters paired with bready malts and some sourdough character. Taste has notes of lemon, light spice, and a light malty finish. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Not a bad easy drinker but nothing too exciting here."

"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a Belgian style ale. Good pilsner like biscuity notes with some fruit presence."
""
""
"Definitely an adequate blonde ale, and well enough rendered at that - however, this, like Fat Tire, is only tangentially Belgian. A small point, sure, and a hard one to refute for this broad style, I know. Worthy of giving a go as the weather starts to warm the hell up."
""
"O: a solid beer overall. More like a pilsner than a Belgian pale ale, but still enjoyable."
"It's crisp and light on the palate with a crisp bite accompanied by a soft fluffiness even into a slightly slick but gently nipping finish."
""
""
""
""
"O - easy to drink, completely unremarkable."
""
""
"A good light blonde ale, excellent color with slight head. The smell is mild as I would anticipate with a beer of this make. I enjoy the taste and mouthfeel of this good early springtime beer. It is very refreshing and I feel the beer is underrated.."

"Overall this was a pretty average Belgian Pale Ale. It really tasted more like a solid Pilsner. Whichever way you would classify it, New Belgium put out a fairly light and refreshing beer."
""
""
""

"Pours a clear yellow with a nice foamy white head. Smells like lemon and yeast. Taste is subtle lemon and a very strong grassy flavor. The grass throws off the whole beer for me, reminds me of dirt. Overall it’s okay, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for another."

"Low B-"
"O- This is an unusual, and uncharacteristically pedestrian outing for New Belgium. Due to buzzwords like ""Belgian"" and ""Ale"" I expected something very different... but I wasn't disappointed at all. If you like biscuity beers, and don't turn your nose up at the occasional pint of lager, then I would certainly give this a try!"
""
""
""

"Poured into a pint glass. Average blonde looking beer with little head. This beer is average at best and i was kinda disappointed with this beer. Usually New Belgium doesnt disappoint me but this one dead. Taste is week as well as the mouthful and the smell is again average not something i havent had the nose for before"

"Pours a straw color with a nice fluffy white head that is sticking around quite nicely... very bright and clear. Smell is of bright citrus slightly sweet I bet this is going to go down easy and be quite refreshing... Taste lemon slightly sour some bitterness... slight biscuit note very refreshing... Only thing I don't like about this beer is I'm drinking it when it's like 30 degrees out lol Would be much better suited in the warmer spring/summer months..."

"Well, a new NB... they rotate out almost all their brews constantly these days. This one is a very pale light gold color,, crystal clear, with a thin topping of foam. The nose has a nice crackery malt scent and a light dusting of hops. The flavor profile is extremely clean, with light malt, but a pleasant amount of bitterness for a generic session beer. Yeast character is mostly neutral--maybe a hint of fruitiness. Light bodied. In general, completely unexceptional--the type of light beer every microbrewer had at one time. Inoffensive. NB should bring back their Porch Swing Single, which was light but had lots of character. It's becoming a brewery with no particular character itself."
""
"Poured into a glass, has a nice billowy white head, and a pale, straw colored appearance, completely clarified. When I first poured it I was getting some aromas like that of NB's Trippel, which is one of my go-to's, and I wondered if it was going to be something like a Trippel Lite. Closer inspection revealed a weakish lemony aroma, and some corn-like malts - not bad but not what I would call stellar. First taste, to be honest, I could barely taste anything. I had my wife taste it and she called out the lemony, tart front end and the bitter finish, which is pretty much how the label describes it. As I got through the glass, the tartness up front and bitter back end became more apparent, but the mouthfeel is pretty light and watery. I compared it to a Coors Light, which I have nothing against, just not something I drink/buy/think about with any regularity. It does have a little more going on than a CL, and the airy mouthfeel could be considered refreshing. The abv is low enough that you can have a few without getting totally smashed, but do you want a few? Just a question to ask yourself. JSYK, I am really hard on Belgian pales in general, but this beer did not stand out to me whatsoever, and my wife used the word ""pointless"" to describe it. I actually do like New Belgium and buy their products quite a bit, but don't need to get this one again."

"At first pour, this Pale Ale doesn't look fairly distinct in appearance from others of the style, but then the head begins to die down leaving invitingly luscious lacings. Malts with a touch of coriander contribute to a light, airy nose. This beer is refreshingly creamy and perfectly smooth in the mouth. Lightly sweet, with blends of caramel malts and butternut squash, the brew is highly drinkable and perfect for a warm day outdoors on the porch with a book. Perhaps, a bit of pre-1960s folk is playing in the background. ""My Creole belle... I love her well..."""

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and lemon aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt, grass, and citrus flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is crisp and refreshing."
"The Verdict: Pretty good. Very well balanced and quite refreshing. I wouldn’t mind making it a regular session beer this spring."
""
""
""
"The dry yeastiness finally takes over the taste buds but it's still an odd sweet and sourish combination. Rather bitter aftertaste with the candy hints. Attractive golden color with a very persistent foam in the glass. Faint aroma of cornmeal. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at a Von's supermarket."
""
""
""
"O: a good if hoppy version of the style."
""

"Overall it is a mild easy to drink ale. Just don't expect it to be Duvel."

"Overall I rate this beer good Would definitely buy again but in the spring. Not really the season for it, once the snow goes, good beer."
""
""
"O- no where close to anything Belgian tasted more like a Kolsch or a pilsener"
"Doesn't drive in the lanes of the style completely, but a nice beer none the less; a nod to subtle"
""
""
"Perfectly sessionable. Easy drinking but not very complex. Beer does pick up quite a bit as it warms. Just an easy drinker that would be great on a hot day at a ballgame."

"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Snifter. 1/21/14."

"Taste is a distinctively Belgian pale ale style, with a sweet malty and slightly spicy presence up front, and a tinge of floral hops just below. This is a lovely and well-balanced ale that remains faithful to the New Belgium name and the company's more distinctive label ""re-invention"". Liked it!"
""
"I was ecstatic to see a new Belgian/Blonde ale from NB and picked it up immediately. I have loved everything I've ever tasted from New Belgium until today. As I said, I'm not certain if I received a poor batch, but I'm incredibly disappointed with the quality of this beer. I'm amazed that a craft brewery (and such a good one too) could have brewed what I just drank."
"A good brew here. I'll enjoy the other 5 bottles."

"Pours translucent light golden with a white head and effervescence bubbles rising to surface. Aroma is lemon poppysead bread, a little pepper, and apple. Flavor is similar with a grassy mildy bitter finish. This one definitely leans to the sweet malty side of things for me. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, meh. What I generally have come to think of most NB offerings. Not bad but not one I will bother with again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is slightly sweet, with hints of lemony citrus and sweet barley. Once poured, the beer is a beautiful golden color with a thick head. The first taste explodes with sweet barley and subtle yeast flavors that are quickly drawn back by an inviting bitterness. The after taste lingers in the back of the mouth with a refreshing feel. The body is perfect for this style of beer. This is definitely a go-to beer for me."
""
"Perfectly done, and distinctly Belgium, Well done New Belgium, Well done indeed!"
