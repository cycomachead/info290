"Verdict - the younger the beer the more vibrant the fruit flavors are and the head lasts longer the younger the beer is. Even at 2 years it is a very drinkable beer but it is better fresh."

"Batch 012. Appears cloudy golden, with aromas of yeast and floral notes, maybe a hint of citrus. Not too much on the palate other than the expected taste of yeast and a trace of lemon and a mild bitterness. Very well carbonated and easy to drink. The finish is dry, but the yeasty flavor sits for a long time. Very refreshing. I could easily drink multiple bottles. I would say this is a good average Belgian Ale."

"Overall - This is a good example of the style, and a good beer. It didn't blow my hair back, and maybe because of the hype surrounding the brewery this review isn't the most impartial. I think I did a good job though. However, for the difficulty of obtaining this beer, there are a dozen others that are just as good. Condor recommended, Condor approved."

"Overall, this is a really nice Belgian blonde.  It manages to keep the trademarks of the style (yeast, lemons, cloves, etc), while tweaking them slightly to make it a bit more interesting."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite style but much less cloying and sweet than other Belgian styles-- drier and crisper. Well-made."

"Pours a hazy straw with a small quickly fading white head. Lacing was excellent. Smells of lemon, clove, and banana with hints of light sourness and yeast. Grassy, earthy hops with hints of lemon and sourness. Medium light bodied with high level of carbonation. Overall, a supremely drinkable sour pale."

"O: Far from their best beer, but still delicious just about sums it up."
""
""
"O: It's right up there with the best examples of this style with that distinct Belgian yeast character of moderate spice and fruit that dominates this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really solid Belgian, especially for the price"
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasure to drink! I didn't expect a lot from this beer but it delivered great complexity without weight. It reminded me a lot of drinking a gently brett'ed saison but with a Belgian twist."
""
""
"Overall - Exactly what I'd want during the warm spring/fall months here in Florida. It's incredibly light, smooth, refreshing and tasty."

"(O)- Overall, simply a pure joy to drink and goes down very easy. An ideal beverage for summertime."

"O: Strong beer for sure, would have preferred to have had this on a hot summer day but it is still fantastic now, another beer well done RR!"

"The taste lacked depth and complexity, but it was still an enjoyable drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A good Belgian Pale Ale from Russian River, but a far cry from a beer like Damnation or some of their other Belgian Blondes. The beer is just too simplistic and grain heavy and it doesn't come across as light and delicate, which is what I was really hoping for."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent ale and one that I would drink more often if I could."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Just a really good easy drinking blonde from one of my favorite American breweries!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's easy for me to say this is my least favorite offering of Russian River's that I've had so far. Seems like their wheelhouse is sour ales and types of IPA, both of which I love. Reminds me of Damnation in some ways, which I suppose makes sense, but whatever they do to increase the ABV of Damnation also imparts a bit more interesting components to the beer, as I liked it better than this one. There are several BPAs that I would drink before expending the effort to procure another bottle of this."
"Overall: Brett in a Belgian Pale ale is a really great compliment. I dig it alot. As always Russian River makes another outstanding beer."
""
"Overall nothing remarkable here but its solid. Good Belgian pale. You could down a few of these in a hurry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
"O- very enjoyable session able beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid and well-crafted BPA, but nothing more. A good but unremarkable BPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid introduction to the style at hand, although at this point, I've become so entrenched with the hoppier, wilder pale ale offerings from Belgium to the point where this makes me nothing more than nostalgic to the time period that I was first discovering this style. Absolutely recommended for people wanting to get into startup offerings in the style, and very tame overall. I wish I could have tried the Brett version back in the day, though!"
""
""
""
"O: Nice, gentle and refreshing and easy drinking. Start here."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/4/2013. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, clove, wheat, pepper, coriander, floral, banana peel, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, clove, pepper, coriander, wheat, banana, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, coriander, wheat, banana, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast and malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian blonde ale. All around nice balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"Never been a big fan of most Belgian styles, but I think Russian River knows what it's doing with this style. Really a light bodied beer and soft but not too gentle. Remains smooth and maintains a nice dry finish. Extremely drinkable beer, goes quick, especially on a humid day like today. A very nice beer of a style I don't normally appreciate as much as I should but am occasionally craving. A well done beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, refreshing and super flavorful; The orange forward hops(I'm guessing Styrian goldings?) really meld effortlessly with the fruit forward and spicy Belgian yeast. These flavors, coupled with the lively carbonation lend the beer a very thirst quenching character. Belgian ""single"" ales aren't too common to find, but this is one definitely worth seeking out."

"O: a solid, pan-appealing blonde ale... nice ""session"" opener"
""

"Pours a cloudy gold with a thin white head. No lacing. Smell is pleasant, almost floral. Hints of honey, clove and citrus are evident. The mild floral scent comes out in the taste as well, almost like a jasmine beer but not quite as intense. Very pilsner-esque both in appearance and flavor, but with more body and more well balanced. Expensive. $4+ for a 12 oz bottle in Seattle."
""
"If I could drink this every day I would. Many subtle flavors come together to create a delicious and complex beer that is also refreshing. Nicely crafted and a benchmark for belgian pale ales in my book."
"O-A very enjoyable belgian blonde ale. Love the aroma of the beer and the drinkability of it especially being only 5.2%. Wish RR would start supplying more of their beer to PA!"
"Overall: This was my second non-IPA offering from Russian River. It's a very enjoyable rendition of the Belgian Pale Ale style (at least if I'm right in thinking this is a BPA). Looks great, tastes great and it is definitely an above-average example of the style. (4)"
""
""

"Overall: Not my favorite style, but when done this well it is delicious."

"O - disappointed in this. Would not buy again."
""
""
"O - This is a great representation of what is an often-overlooked style. Low in alcohol, complex and full of flavor. This is the perfect lunchtime beer, and can easily be paired with tons of different foods without dominating the meal. Now if only it was a little less expensive..."
""
"O: good belgian pale ale overall, very drinkable, pretty tasty, and not overly spiced or too yeasty. It's nearly $9 per 375ml bottle here in Philly, so I'll forget about having it again."
"O: This is a far more approachable sour or funky beer than many others, easily appeals to people that are just starting to explore those styles/characteristics. The overall sourness/tartness is light but this is still quite tasty. Alcohol is very well hidden even though it is quite low in ABV - definitely another quality beer from Russian River."
"O: This beer is quite easy to drink and the subtle sourness from the brett lend some complexity to the beer. This would be a good choice for someone that is just getting into sours."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: This is only my second Russian River beer and first out of a bottle. I was very impressed! Very good beer from start to finish. Highly recommend! Classified as a Belgium Pale Ale at 5.5%. Batch 12. Consumed on 11/20/2012."

"O: The thing about this style is that it's never going to set the world on fire for me. I do think, however, this is as good as a Belgian blonde ale is going to get for me before venturing too far into either the IPA or the sour side of things. The balance in this brew is amazing, with little hints of everything. Interesting stuff, highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good Belgian-style Blonde or Pale Ale. Not a style I normally seek out, but someone generously gave me this bottle and I’ll never turn down a chance to try a Russian River brew."
"Pale golden beer, clearish, with a fluffy white head that retains well and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Lots of trub and floaties if you're pouring it from the bottle. Citrus and yeast in the nose, fruity esters and floral hops. In the taste: pale malt sweetness, bready yeast, pear and banana notes, citrus zest, floral and slightly earthy hops. Light-medium mouthfeel, generously carbonated, quiet pleasant overall. RR rarely disappoints."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well crafted, simple beer. But not much going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-one major problem. It's the price. Well I got this in western PA, so I'm pretty sure I overpaid. The truth is I dream about a pale Belgian ale with this much flavor, kept at a very drinkable abv. I just wish it wouldn't wreck my wallet to get a case of this. It definitely doesn't have the flavor of the stronger pale Belgians, but it still has an awesome rawness."
""
""
""
""
"The label stated that this was a sister beer to Damnation and I'd guess it is the ""weak sister."" Far more subtle and smooth, this blonde ale was not nearly as complex as Damnation but was nice enough. It poured with a very thin head and was very notably blonde. The aroma was lighter in fruity notes and gave me the impression of pears. The taste was smooth and fruity but much softer than Damnation. Overall it's enjoyable but not quite its sibling."

"O- This was a decent beer that I enjoyed drinking but wasn't overly impressed. I definitely enjoyed Damnation (the base beer) more and there are plenty of beers from RR that I would choose over this. I would drink this again, but definitely not pay the price tag on it or seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely dryer than I was expecting, leaving it a bit flat flavor-wise. Pretty refreshing though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I liked this beer for its balance and drinkability (almost a session beer), but for 6 bucks I felt like it was just a bit too subtle when compared against some of its Belgian pale ale competition."
"M: quenching, snappy, very refreshing beer, highly drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I know I should grade this on the style and not on my personal preference and I did but I will tell you here in the after notes that I hate everything this beer and brews of it's style are. I hate the smell, color, taste, popularity. I find it so hard to believe that so many BA's seek out this style of beer."
""
""
""
"It goes down soooo smooth and easy. If it were on draft, id order about 10234253."
"Upfront, Redemption is a tad tart and brings on lemon, grain, and bread like no other. The finish actually does remind me of a sourdough loaf. Very tasty, and quite refreshing, albiet almost sessionable. It has a lot of carbonation with a sharp, medium body. Satisfying me right now."
""
""
"This pours a cloudy straw white color. I get a delicate aroma with hints of coriander and orange peel, full of yeasty esters. It is a delicate and light drinker, with a slight “musty” estery finish along with the coriander and orange notes. Pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An exemplar of the style. Highly recommended. Will be drinking again."
""
""
"Overall this is a very drinkable, smooth and creamy beer. Very pleasant."
""
"O- Wish I had another bottle of this. It's an easy drinking, refreshing, BPA. Another solid offering from Russian River."
""
""
"O: Refreshing and not overdone, a really solid BPA and a good drinker."
""
""
"O: a solid BPA overall. The watery body holds it back a bit, though."
"O- Really well done, but I'd expect nothing less from one of CA's top breweries. Perfect for this hot summer night. Crisp, clean, tart, funky, grassy, grainy and fruity! Excellent!"
""
"D: A really nice example of this style. I am torn on my ratings. On one hand, this is a great example of the style...one the other, it's $4-5 for a 12oz bottle, which is going to set my expectations higher. It doesn't serve it's purpose very well at that price point."
"I have to be honest in saying that I was a bit disappointed by this at first, but the further I get into it, the more I get and appreciate what is supposed to be going on here. Really nice beer for a rare style, although for the price point, I'd rather pick up a Damnation 99% of the time. Still though, a solid offering, Cheers!"
"Overall, yes it's good. It's light, truly Belgian in style, and drinkable. But it's not that complex, and has a few things that I'd personally change."
""
""
"Overall: I don't know what to make of this beer. Its pedigree promised so much more than what it delivered, but what it delivered wasn't bad. This was *the* perfect beer to drink, coming in from the pool on a hot summer day. It was absolutely refreshing and the beer yelled ""SUMMER!"" from the top of its foamy little lungs... but I expected a lot more depth of flavor and aroma than what was delivered."
"O - A really fantastic summer beer. It would be so nice to live in Santa Rose just to drink beer like this on tap every chance one could get."
"O- Very good BPA. More complex than most, but very drinkable."
"O - Very easy drinking blonde. Glad I tried this but not a beer I would seek out. A bit overpriced for what you get in my opinion but another quality beer by RR."
"Overall: Very nice beer, Would love to have another bottle but Its a bit pricey. I dont drink beer just to get a buzz but a little alcohol would be nice for the price."
""
"Overall - A smooth, lightly flavored, easy drinking brew if not a bit to it's own detriment. Probably not worth the asking price, lest one is at the brewery and/or getting it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"Complex and tasty, bright and refreshing. Definitely a well crafted example of the style and worth the buy for sure. Would like to have a few of these on standby for those hot summer days."
""
""
""
""
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a pale golden amber. Light head leaves a ring around the glass, slight lacing. Aroma of wheat, light malt, yeast and Belgian spicing. Sweet wheat flavor, almost reminiscent of a heffeweizen, light malt and Belgian spice. Finish is sweet wheat and then an increasing bitterness. Pleasant, but not quite as good as the best Belgian pale ales. An interesting ale that I will revisit."
"O - A great Belgian style offering from Russian River. Highly drinkable and seems like it would pair well with meat & seafood."
"Very nice Belgian Pale; super balanced and extremely easy drinking. Would make an amazing session beer, even at 5.5% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - All in all, the beer is very smooth and enjoyable. The expected sourness is still present, though it is toned down just a bit to let the Belgian properties shine. Perfect for a summer night. The beers complexity, however, leaves a bit to be desired."
""
""
"Not bad...an average Belgian Ale. I am spoiled though, I just got done living in Europe for the last few years, so I had regular access to Belgians beers and other European greats! Anyway, this is my least liked caged and corked beer (this and damnation) by Russian River. Straw/pale yellow beer, good carbonation. Very average on taste, a nice hoopy bitter flavor, but not much else in the way of flavor. Not a lot of depth. Overall a very average beer...."
""
"Moderately light bodied with medium carbonation; manages to feel both smooth and crisp at the same time. Easy drinking and refreshing, with a lot of flavor for a lowish alcohol beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky orange with a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight bitterness with each sip that quickly fades from the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that make this one quite easy to drink."
""
"Pours a shiny, cloudy golden color. Nice yeasty aroma. Good mouthfeel, citrus and yeast in the taste. Had this in a beer session with some higher ABV so this was a welcome, laid back beer. Nothing too fancy about it, but it's well balanced and refreshing with a clean finish. Not every beer has to be extreme, and this is a solid offering from RR."
""
""
""
"Overall I freakin love this one. It might be my favorite pale ale, Belgian or American style. It's just the perfect blend of flavors and is extremely refreshing."
"Overall: the balance is wonderful. The flavors mesh very well and the flavor is almost light."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very crisp and refreshing. Good balance of flavors and it never feels empty."
""
""
""
"A nice light colored beer with a dense white head. Not a big smell, but a veryeasy to drink pale ale. I have been into Belgian beers lately and this is one of the better ones- although lower in alcohol than some of the others I have been drinking. I enjoyed the carbination-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pear and apple with subtle spicing and beautiful Belgian yeast notes. Balanced and delicate. Man, does this go down easy. This is a perfect Belgian Pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Man, this is a beer that I drank and thought to myself, wow this is actually not a stellar showing from RR. But that was my own immaturity. After drinking another sip I realized that this is a Belgian Pale Ale, not an American Wild Ale, not a DIPA this is supposed to be reserved, delicate and beautiful. And guess what? It is! Bravo to a brewery that frequently pushes the envelope to use some restraint and craft and delicate and delicious brew."
"Subtle, elegant, and clean. Corked and caged 375mL bottle poured a light straw color with ample white suds on top. Lighlty grainy, fresh sourdough bread accented by the fruit and spice of Belgian yeast. Mild bitterness and a fragrant blend of flowers and herbs on the nose. I could drink this everyday, save for the price."
"this is something different from russian river. at first taste i declared, ""this is my least favorite russian river beer ive ever had"". after reading the label and hearing it described as a belgian single (huh?!), i decided i like it quite a bit. pours cloudy and very light straw yellow color with a very bubbly white head that fades out but leaves some lacing. smells like wheat malt, sorft of hefe yeast mixed with monk's yeast, and some light herbs, corriander? flavor is very light, wheat malt type base, germanesque for a second, before relaxign into a balanced light ale with tons of great yeast happening. feel is nice, more than nice, like all of their beers, its bubbly and foaming and expansive and clean. i love the feel. body is light light light, but it works with this flavor profile. again, this aint to supplication, but its a nice drinkable blonde ale."
""
"O/D- I enjoy this for its clean feel and crispness. Almost seems to be lacking in some area which may just be the result of such a simple, refreshing beer."
"Very different than anything i can remember. Would have again. Thanks stupac2!"
""
""
"O: This is just a solid Belgian pale ale. No other way around it. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable pale ale with the added Belgian yeast tinge."
""
""
"O: This is a beer that I will drink again"
""
""
""
"O: Very, very good belgian pale ale. I'm sad that I only bought one bottle when I had the chance."
""
"O-A really nice, well put together beer. Definitely tastes Belgian."
""
""
""
"O: Overall excellent beer, but not sure it's my favorite style."
"O- crisp pure golden pale ale with fruit and spice"
""
"Overall: Definitely a solid take on the style. Loads of mild flavor. So much going on, but you have to work for it. Very easy to drink and doesn't seem like it needs any age to improve. Easy drinking, but not a blockbuster from Russian River."
""
""
"Overall Impression- A very nice brew from Russian River but not my favorite from them. Just good all along the ranks. I would definitely grab a sour from them before enjoying this one again. Very close to style. Thumbs up brew."
"4.5 D: Very tasty beer. RR is a good brewery."
""
""
"O - Good beer, would really hit the spot on a hot day."
""
""
"O-a delicious blonde ale with a great blend of flavors and balance"
"If you are looking for an excellent summer Belgian, this might just be it. Well done, once again, Russian River!"
""
""
"D - Highly drinkable and high quality. If you're a fan of the style, definitely worth a try. Too mild for me, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is perfection as far as blonde ales go. the belgian yeast is very noticeable and you keep getting hints of grass and citrus.. like a witbier. perfect for the summer, i really hope to get more of this."
""
"The body is light and refreshing, never becoming coating or sticky. It provides for a very easy mouthfeel but does seem to get bullied by the carbonation. Prickly, fizzy, and slightly explosive, the carbonation fizzes when the beer is held in the mouth and foams up when the beer is swallowed. This, with the lighter body, can make it a little difficult to really dissect the flavors of the beer."
""
""
""
"Would be a good beer for the warmer months. If I didn’t know, I’d guess it to be a lager and not an ale. Not really what I was expecting."
""
""
"O- Overall a very solid Belgian ""single"". Refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clean, lightly toasted bread notes up front. Mildly sweet powdered sugar fruit fills in, briefly, before peppery bitterness and faintly citric acidity take over. A little hay and yeast into the dry finish. Moderate body, with a lively, lilting feel. Refreshing and complex. I like that."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer but at $9/bottle would expect something a little more remarkable..this would be a great summer session brew if the price was right."
""
"Cheers."
"O: Decent BPA. Pretty simple, drinkable and tasty."

"Overall: So impressed with this beer. The flavor is so unique. I will definitely be purchasing again."
"4, 4, 4, 4, 4"
"Clear, very pale yellow with a white cap that started out fizzy, but settled into a thin skim and collar of fine bubbles. Notes of pale malt grain and pears in the aroma, slightly floral and spicy with a bit of apple apparent as it warmed, faint lemon zest. Light bodied with a light leafy bitterness that only appeared in the finish. Before that, it was fruity (apples and pears) with a pale malt character, perhaps a hint of yeast. Carbonation was moderate, but felt slightly aggressive, which worked in this beer and kept it lively. Overall, quite good. I really liked the aroma - refined and complex without having the kitchen sink thrown in."

"Not quite on par with its Belgian brewed counterparts but still a solid beer."
"I don't have a lot of experience with this particular style. Overall, this was a thoroughly enjoyable drinking experience. I wish I could easily get RR beers. Living in Kentucky, I'm forced to acquire them via trade. Definitely worth the effort."

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: With the Westvleteren Blonde having sold me on the drinkability of this beer style I was looking forward to this one and to seeing how it would compare to my 10 month old memories of that beer. I was not disappointed. The Redemption is a clean, crisp, easy sipper with one sip following another easily and comfortably. My overall impression is that this beer would show well in a side by side tasting with the Westvleteren Blonde and that I’ll be more than happy to be finding and drinking this again."

"O- I like this beer. It is very drinkable and I like the text on the back explaining the style. I get a root beer type flavor which reminds me of my youth. RR does it for me again!"
"D: Not bad, but not something I would buy again. Certainly my least favorite Russian River offering to date."
""
"o - overall, unassuming. nice BPA, but not an archetype for the style, but certainly a non-polarizing beer. seems like a safe take on the style since it is so soft it is almost like drinking a flavored water. enjoyable, but not something i'll be ISO'ing for swap."

"DOA"
"from notes - split with my nigga D! pours an opaque blonde with a decent white head that falls quickly leaving solid lacing. the aroma is a lemony zest with the most subtle tart you can imagine. the taste is....something you really have to search for but it delicately tart with the same lemon as in the nose not real yeasty and alcohol is not present. the mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is moderate, i will say this is easy to drink but this beer is just lacking it. overall i didn't even finish my glass and i will not be revisiting this. i thought this was par, ok maybe this is what they wanted to brew but not for me. SDUB it son!"
"O: Really easy to drink, but a bit pricey for me. I prefer it's brother beer Damnation."
"O: A nice beer, but one better suited for a hot summer afternoon than a winter day when it is snowing. I would say that this beer is above average but does not stand out."
""
""
""
"O:Not bad. I'm not a huge fan on Blonde Ales so I'm not sure what to be looking for in one."
""
"Very good beer this Redemption is, light and easy drinking."
""

"Pours a hazy yellow color with an excellent one finger white head. Outstanding lacing on my CBS snifter. One of the better looking beers I've seen in the style. The nose is definitely funk, apple, pear, lemon mustiness. Simply outstanding- this could totally be a beer from Belgium- and that's high praise. The taste follows suit, with Brett, lemon, malt, apple, pear all there. There's a slight sourness, but it's not over the top. Feel is a lemon tartness, with an nice malt backbone. Very full for the style, with only a slightly dry finish. Overall, this beer wowed me. I first got into craft beer through drinking Belgian beers, and this could totally fool me into thinking it was from there. Excellent job by Russian River, once again. This beer has all the makings of being world class. Cheers."
""
""
"O: A nicely flavored and refreshing beer. There is nothing in the flavor profile that stands out, but it is well balanced."
"I smell pear, and I taste pear, and has the dryness that comes with it. Spices and funk; a very subdued drink. I could drink a lot of this, despite still being on the fence with this style."
"O: Very easy drinking for a Belgian style beer. Wouldn't have guessed it that low in abv either. Could drink this one all day and see it pairing well with food too."
""
""
""
"O- Not as good as other offerings I have had from RR, but not a bad beer. I am not a huge fan of the style, so it is hard for me to decide whether I am not big on this beer, or if it is just that I am not into the style. I keep trying to like BPA's but can't get into them."
"D: [DRINKABILITY] Very easy to drink but the lack of complexity keeps my interest from being too high."

"Redemption is easily the best Belgian single I’ve had (though it might be the only example of the style I’ve tried), and even compared with Belgian pale ales it rises near the top of the pack. It might not be the most flavorful beer ever, but its drinkability is outrageous. If it were available in Arizona in the summer, I’d buy it by the case."
"O: Not sure what RR was going with this."

"Pours a bright golden color with a fluffy white head that has nice retention and leaves rings of lacing. Very fruity aroma, more so citrus than yeast, with pale malt, banana and mild floral hops. Flavor is similar to the nose, citrus and ester sweetness over a light malt body and a hint of floral hop bitterness in the finish. Nice light texture on the palate with medium carbonation. My favorite of the regular rotation non-BA -tion beers."
""
"O - A quality RR beer for sure. Definitely worth a try. While I enjoyed it more than its ""sister beer"" Damnation, I find it inferior to some of Russian River's other offerings (e.g. Temptation, Consecration, Supplication)."

"O: Overall, I found this underwhelming. I was lucky enough to get my hands on 5 RR brews on my west coast trip, this is the 4th of the 5 and so far is it by far my least favorite. It’s enjoyable but it’s nothing special. I also think I drank this too warm. I usually prefer my beers at slightly higher temps than recommended but I would suggest to drink this one quite chilled."

"This is a nice beer and would be wonderful if billed as a saison, but as a Belgian pale ale, it didn't blow me away, but it was still rather nice."

"Lightly toasted and unmalted barley comes together with a fruity Belgian yeast that gives off some ripe apple and tart blackberry nuances. I could drink this all day. Smooth, and somewhat grassy palate. This beer has flavor and spunk, but not the alcoholic punch of most Belgian style beers available in the USA."

"Overall – It really does taste like a hefe and the flavours are very fresh and vibrant. I enjoyed every sip and I could honestly drink this beer every day. It would work especially well on a warm summer day. Another fantastic beer by RR."

"Overall: To be completely honest, I felt a little underwhelmed drinking Redemption.. only because my expectations for my first beer from Russian River were through the roof. I do however understand they're highly revered for a reason, and perhaps I should've chosen another one of their offering to drink first. Don't get me wrong though, Redemption is still a quality brew."

"Batch # 10. Once again, these RR guys hit the ball out of the park. I let the bottle warm some out of the fridge, then poured according to label. Got a smallish, frothy, sudsy, off white head that soon settled to a thin cover and a bit of lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber with loads of large bubble trails. Aroma has a lot going on with yeast, malt, citrus, apples, balsamic vinegar, perfume, wet grain. Flavor is similar to nose with the carbonic tang hitting you then all those other things & it's fairly dry. Body n carbonation are perfect for style. Finish is like flavor, plus it also leaves ""sweet spit", I guess as mouth's reaction to the acids. Clean and average length. Sipping beer and I bet it'd be a blast to cook with."
"*Batch: 008"
"O: Not a bad brew, thanks RR!"
"O -- Really enjoyed this and would definitely get this again."
"O: Refreshing and very drinkable. Starts off great, but goes down hill as it warms up an looses carbonation."
"Batch 8, poured from 375 ml bottle into a SA perfect pint glass, hazy yellow pour, very big white head. The aroma is floral, lemony, fruity. A very fruity beer, lemons, some bannana, apples, the finish is dry. The body is light, high carbonation, very easy drinking. A nice, easy drinking, sessionable brew."
"How I would describe this beer in one word: delicate. It is balanced well with lots of light flavors. Lemon flavor is strong, but hidden by the clove and other yeast characteristics very well. I think I need to try this a few more times to get some other complexities out of it, to which I look forward considering its session alcohol strength."
"O: Definitely very drinkable fresh, and with some nice aging the Brett will definitely show through very nicely. I really enjoyed the herbal hoppyness that came from this blonde ale. A lot of blonde ales tend to be overly, malty sweet, but this hits the mark with some great hoppyness and balanced maltiness. Definitely, a great beer that is very well done."
"Solid, lighter Belgian ale with a good light fruit profile. Good interplay between yeast, light fruit and spice."
"Medium bodied with some soft carbonation up front. Funky with and earthy/bretty flavor along with light fruit notes, faint hops and alcohol sweetness. The Brett is complimented by an earthy hop presence and is nicely balanced by the ester/fruit character. Hints of apple and pear followed by some pale malt that lingers into a slightly dry finish. Well balanced and very quaffable."
"O: A well designed Belgian Pale Ale. Another success by RR. Would certainly drink this again!"
"O- a fairly straight-forward session Belgian pale ale. Very refreshing and enjoyable. "
"O- Its good, and extremely well balanced. Maybe too balanced."
"Dr: It's very drinkable, suiting the style. I could certainly down it all night, but at its high price point and limited quality, I wouldn't want to. I think in fairness, Russian River did what they could within the style, but it's just not up to snuff compared to other beers I've tried from them."
"Overall a really great, clean Belgian pale ale."
"A very nice Belgian Pale, well worth drinking if you are in to the style. Very flavorful and well done."
"Really good, enjoyed the clean maltiness with just a touch of phenolics. Would definitely have again."
"Overall - Very nice. Really hits the spot on a hot afternoon. I'd drink this again, but probably not at the prices I've seen it for."
"Tasty but not my favorite. Duvel and Damnation trump this for the style."
"Drinkability: A very good Belgian Pale Ale that I wish I had more access to. The flavors are nice and funky, a bit soft, but blend really well. I could have a couple of these."
"It wasn't exceptional, but it was enjoyable. If I saw it on the shelf, I would probably pick it up from time to time, but wouldn't trade for it."
"Light and rather mild, but not too much there for me to pick apart. But I think my sense of taste may have been off that evening."
"O - Overall a great brew. Ill be picking up some more if I see it around. I'd definitely drink this over similar brews like Festina Peche. This beer resembles everything good about Hefes, Saisons, and Berliner Weisses. Nice hop profile that doesn't shine until your half way done, nice Saison style yeast, as well as that BPA alcohol burn. Excellent brew from RRBC."
"O. This is my first try of a Russian River beer. Maybe I expected to be blown away. Sorry I had such high expectations. Very good beer but not worth $5 for a 12oz bottle."
"Russian River has wowed me again. I don't love this brew, but expected to hate it as I do most Belgian pales. Not their best sour, but very easily drinkable."
"Pours a light golden color with a thick fluffy cloud like head with unbelievable lacing. Great aroma of citrus, slight banana and sweet malts. Taste follows the bitterness of the hops cuts into the sweetness of the malts produces a crisp refreshing beer that I could get used to drinking"
"Overall, I am thoroughly disappointed in this beer. A- my ass. This beer only receives the reviews it gets because it is a Russian River beer. If this beer was made by a lesser known brewery, it would not be getting the scores it has. Just another over rated beer on this site."
"Worth at least one try."
"O:"
"D - A very solid offering from Russian River... Not exceptional, but definitely more than worthy for fans of the style... Loaded with complexities... Sophisticated... A sipper, even given it's low ABV..."
"The bottle states this is a Belgian single which is typically not brewed for market, but historically brewed by monks for themselves as a mealtime brew. I like to think of this as Belgian Strong's easy drinking little sister. Which I had better access to RR."
"A really tasty ale with yeast notes that almost don't match the appearance. Very tasty."
"overall: strong american version of the styl"
"poured from bottle into RR tulip. The color is a faint golden yellow with just a faint head with faint lacing. Very effervescent and bubbly. Can taste the wine and a very slight sweetness, easy to drink, just a little bit lacking in flavor for my tastes. Slight tartness with an after taste of sweetness. Not my favorite, but my wife loves this beer. So if you are wondering why this is on my want list, because happy wife, happy life."
"pour is yellow golden with a white head of very tight bubbles that disappear and leave a film of carbonation.... this is in waves much like something that would have a much higher FG. nose is grassy and brisk. the quintessential hop note that least such a nice dry feeling on the tough. similar feel to another favorite the derank... but more lemon grass. zest and light bodied. nice feel and very easy to drink on a hot day. this is my mowing the lawn beer perfection."
"MF- Nice moderate body with a lot of carbonation which lets all the flavors bounch around on the palate."
"Overall, the beer is decently crisp and refreshing, but not a beer I would go crazy over. Certainly one of the lowest reviews I've given a beer by RR!"
"I picked the perfect time to drink this and I really enjoy this. Well done!!"
"O - A nice belgian pale, RR does it again."
"O-So far the least impressive of the RR beers. Still a decent beer but there are better BPAs out there. Ommegang's comes to mind."
"A great authentic tasting American Belgian pale ale. Subtle complexity, great yeast and zesty flavors. Something I wish were cheaper and in a six pack around me. I could drink this by the pail."
"O- A pretty solid beer. Really refreshing for my first BPA. Wasn't aware RR even brewed this guy so I'm glad I got to try it."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and I really wish I could get more Russian River. Please distribute to northern New Jersey."
"O- this is NOT a beginner sour...very abrasive tasting, and a total sipper"
"Overall - a good beer for a hot summer day. Very drinkable. It may be the first time I've tried this style, and I just find it a little mellow."
"QUITE NICE, WORTH A TRY!"
"Rating the beer alone, this would probably be a B/C. Rating to style, this is an easy A for me."
"Overall this isn't something I would normally seek out, but would be happy to receive as an extra. A very high quality Belgian Blonde."
"O: Really straight forward beer that is easy to drink and extremely refreshing. Would love to spend a warm summer night drinking this on tap."
"It's incredibly rare to find Belgian-inspired ales with the same levels of quality and character being brewed outside of Belgium; while Santa Rosa, California is in another country - and is a story of different worlds as much as different beers - somehow it produces finer Belgian ales than many of those from within the country itself. Redemption is certainly one of them."
"O: All day long. The price kind of sucks but it is a really solid beer. Glad I finally got to try it."
"Poured a 375 of batch 10 into a tulip, thanks to womencantsail. Cork came out, but it took some work. Carbonation was light but present. Very small amount of tiny bubbled head formed on a light clear blonde brew. The nose is nice malty sweet with a little earthiness. The taste is sweet with a creamy mouth feel. Lighter touches of banana and melon and spice with a little yeasty malty funk. I really love this style pale, low hop profile, big malt profile, very balanced and drinkable. I enjoyed the complexity and drink ability but would caution others about the overt sweetness."
"Overall I was really pleased with the flavors from this one. Coming from California I was surprised at how fresh this tasted. I'm looking forward to trying more of what Russian River has to offer."
"The nose is full of Belgian aromas, lots of yeasty spicy clovey goodness. Also some lemon and floral notes. The taste seems to be the exact opposite of the smell - the earthy / floral / lemon aspects are much more in the forefront, some hops too, and a bit of a dry spiciness in the finish. Its got a nice mouthfeel, lighter bodied and the above average carbonation isn't a distraction."
"Bright and a a couple shades lighter than golden. Pours with a white, two inch head that settles into a nice surface covering of bubbles. The nose is spicy, herbal and fruity with notes of black pepper, lemon and red apple most prominent. Faint hop aroma and yeast detectable. Belgian malt and yeast character is spot-on with an agreeable tartness. Mild bitterness in the finish with a subtle funk giving it some character. The body is light-medium with prickly carbonation yielding to a creamy mouthfeel. A great example of a rare style, and one of the most drinkable Belgian-style ales I've ever tasted."
"Poured from a corked and caged bottle into a wine glass. (it was all I had, and preferable to a pint glass in this case) Hazy bright yellow with one finger of bright white frothy head. Lemon, grain, floral, yeasty, stale hops on the nose. Malty, lemony palate, dry finish. Fine, creamy carbonation. This beer is extraordinarily drinkable and has enough going on to keep things interesting and leave me wanting more."
"Pours golden with a nice white head with good retention. Nose is yeast and spice. Taste is yeast, spice, and mild fruit. Carbonation keeps it light bodied; very refreshing. Overall, a good beer. It sucks that I had to go clear across the country to get my hands on RR."
"O- A great, very drinkable beer, the bottle describes it as a ""single," I've never had one before but this is definitely a beer I would drink again."
"D - pretty solid BPA here. Nice depth and very refreshing taboot. Usually I can loose interest in this style rather easily, but this was well done. Thankfully I have another bottle."
"O - I really enjoyed this one and wish I could buy more bottles of it locally."
"Final thought - price is high $4+, low ABV 5%. But all in all, I enjoy this beer quite a bit. If I made a lot of money, this would be my daily summer beer"
"D - Great sessionable, summer time beer."
"Overall: a refreshingly light beer with a satisfying complexity. If this beer were just a touch heavier, I think I would love it all the more. Still, this beer is a very pleasant quaff."
"Understated for sure. Redemption let's not quality stand out too far. Another excellent if less eye-popping offering from the good folks at Russian River."
"Pours a hazed golden straw color, moderate cap of bubbles of varying sizes, minimal retention save for some edging and center spot. Scent is muted... Combines notes of sourdough, mild earthiness with lightly tart watery fruit. Taste is quite straightforward and follows scent... Earthiness is quite muddled with an odd metallic/bitter tone. Lighter side of medium bodied, dry finnish, slightly under carbonated. Good beer but not up to the same standards of some of RR's other offerings."
"O: Perhaps the only balanced blond ale I have had. Not too sweet or spicy, but not watery. The resulting mouthfeel is perfect for this style of beer. I have a theory that they use several yeasts to produce this beer. Unlike a lot of sweeter blond ales, which tend to be good before or after a meal but not during, this would go nicely hand in hand with many foods. I verified this by heating up some left over Thai spicy catfish to accompany the last of my glass of this beer. Wow, this is heaven."
"Batch 005: Pours pale gold with a thick chunky white head. Great fruity nose with some definate clove aroma. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Very clean Belgian-typical flavors. A great belgian blonde from a great brewery. Leaves you wanting more."
"O - I was redeemed. Delicious."
"Overall, a solid beer that I would enjoy again on a nice summer day."
"Overall I enjoyed the beer but I wasn't blown away by it. The style isn't at the top of my list and if I ever get another chance to get some beer from Russian River there are several others that I would go for first."
"D - Amazing; one of the best beers I've had from Russian River, and a good reminder of why RR is considered to be a world-class brewery (and they totally deserve the acclaim.) This is not supposed to be a stunner, is it? No pre-release hype clamoring for a BPA? Shame, with a beer this good there should be."
"O: This is a great take on a Belgian table beer, one that I will surely revisit."
"This is a, tasty, but light-bodied beer. It is bright gold with tiny bubbles, and a huge white head that slowly shrinks down to a permanent thin head that’s creamy and leaves some foamy lace. The aroma is tropical fruit, banana, a hint of pine, generally rather sweet but light. The taste is light and sweet with a lot of light fruit, citrus, hints of pine and herbs, and some yeast. It has a light sweetness with a balancing bitterness and a very faint yeasty sourness. It’s light and crisp, refreshing and easy to drink, very satisfying."
"D - Great sessionable, summer time beer."
"Overall, I enjoyed this guy. A fine example of the style and easily quaffable."
"That long finish and complex mix of flavors are balanced artfully by the medium-light body and gentle carbonation. This is a well crafted beer! One of the beers to me that the sum is greater than the individual parts."
"I don't typically drink this style, and wouldn't go out of my way to have this again, but for what it is I really liked it."
"Bottle. Batch 008. Poured into a tulip galss a cloudy golden yellow straw color with a bone white head that quickly settles. The aroma is rather subtle with notes of; bread, wheat, lemon, and a slight brett like funkiness. Medium/light mouthfeel. Slight sweet start with notes of white fruit like peach, some wheat like notes, and a minimal amout of bitterness in the end. it’s pretty decent."
"Pours with a large white billowy head which leaves some lacing and awesome retention. Even with a long rest in the fridge and a careful pour this one is a bit cloudy. Aroma is quite nice with fruity light almost lemony quality. Taste is very refreshing. There is a nice Belgian yeasty quality which is clean and refreshing. There is a mild hop bitterness bite that is pleasant and mildly lemony as well. Very well carbonated and light bodied. Very good light Belgian beer."
"O: While this wasn't my favorite Russian River Brew by a long shot, it was still very nice. I consider this one a craft beer geek's summer beer!"
"O: Refreshing and very drinkable. Good flavor and balance. Moderate ABV."
"Pours a light golden yellow with a 1/4 inch of foam that quickly faded to a layer of fine bubbles. Aroma is light bready grains, cloves and a hint of citrus. Very faint aroma overall. The taste is big lemon zest, clove pepper and slight grains. Very light bodied and crisp mouthfeel. Nicely carbonated and very easy to drink. This could be a nice hot weather beer. Very enjoyable"
"375 ml bottle picked up somewhere in Denver"
"O: An excellent version of a single belgian pale ale that is true to the style. Redemption is very light, refreshing, and enjoyable beer."
"This is a great belgian table beer that is smooth and refreshing. It isn't particularly complex but it doesn't need to be. I need this in a 6-pack."
"O: I enjoyed Russian River's Redemption more then I'd expected to. It drinks like a lemon mimosa - it's light and really quite a pleasant sipper. Though I typically find the Belgian Pale style to be quite blasé, this stands out. Very well done and something I'd certainly return to."
"Pours a pale yellow, almost lemonade color with a small bright white head. The smell is citrusy, lemons maybe a little banana or clove, not too much alcohol up front. The taste is a little disappointing to me. While this maybe a good session beer there is nothing that really stands out to me. The mouth feel is a bit thin. Honestly, the way it looked was the best thing about this beer and i really like Russian River. I got this in a trade but the sticker on it says $6.99. If I paid that much I'd be a bit disappointed. If it was a six pack that cost $9 or $10 not so much. Maybe I expect too much from Russian River."
"Overall: My first Belgian single and it's pretty much the perfect summer beer. If this stuff was half the price i would constantly drink it all summer long. At 5.15% abv. it's extremely sessionable."
"Light and airy - dry and fruity. Not sweet, but grainy. Hop character really adds a pleasant bitterness on the finish. Biscuity and delicious for such a mild mannered brew. Good stuff, this is more of a beer that I would like to see sold in 6-packs for 8-9 bucks than a single, expensive bottle though...Id drink it every day if I could!"
"O: Really a nice beer, great flavors, very refreshing, but still low in ABV. Unfortunately it is definitely on the expensive end of the spectrum for the beer. Which hurts it overall. Still a nice beer though. If and a big IF RR were to put beers in 6 packs, this would be a prime candidate."
"Lighter medium body, higher carb, tingly and refreshing, dry. Really nice example of the style, great flavor, another hit from RR."
"Very drinkable brew, but a bit high-priced for the experience which is not much different than PBR"
"D: Quite, this beer is very drinkable, as intended by the style - half at lunch, the other half at dinner."
"Pours hazy straw blonde with a fluffy white cap, fine carbonation creeps up the side of my pint glass (ya thats right, I disobeyed the instructions on the cork deliberately, my tulip is sitting dry tonight!) Smells kind of like a bock, sort of metallic, slight hay, sulfurous aromas, not very appealing for me. Taste is bock like, but with a pleasant bitter twang to offset the metallic sulfur notes. Sligh grain flavors, followed by delicate hop presence. Mouthfeel is light, if this were more slick like SN Glissade I'd end up dumping it. Carbonation is medium and prickly, overall not my cup of tea but I'll finish it. Not sure I'd revisit it though. If it werent for the dry bitterness, this beer would be undrinkable for me."
"A lovely blonde ale. Crisp, rather dry, and quite flavorful."
"Still overall no complaints, it's actually really interesting take on the style. Neat, I think I really like it."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Not to many thing to knock this brew but not a ton of standout either. Light mouthfeel and crisp taste would make this perfect for hot summer days when I need something to quench my thirst."
"D - Very easy to drink. Nice job."
"Overall: This is a very tasty, easy to drink beer that RR has done a nice job in replicating in style. Expensive but recommended."
"M & D - very refreshing, crisp, finishes very well. Good balance. One of my favorite Belgian beers thus far. Very good."
"Overall: The only problem I have with this beer is that it tastes and feels a bit watery. The flavors balance very well, I just wish there was a bit more."
"Overall, love Russian River and pretty much everything they do. This doesn't disappoint."
"- Overall: (3.5)(Price, and packaging do NOT affect my judging of a beer one bit)This is one fantastic blonde Belgian brew. Well carbonated (almost too much), well balanced, and very robust in it's wheaty, grainy, and zesty approach. This is a light alcohol, full flavored brew. A beef of mine is its price and packaging. I feel a brew like this should be in a regular bomber for about $6. Perhaps a 6-pack of cans around $11. Yes, it's bottle conditioned, well made, and I am sure a tedious brew.. but this is 2011. There are many of these around.. in greater quantities, for much less money."
"D - Drinkability is high. I found myself drinking this very quickly without realizing it. It has an addicting finish that makes you want to drink more and more... would be a problem if it weren't for the low ABV!"
"Pours a bright but hazy golden color with a bone white head. Head is thick and fizzy, recedes slowly, and leaves some nice lacing. Scent is spicy and citrusy. Taste is a nice balance between that funky belgian yeast flavor, a nice spiciness, and some faint hop notes. Clean and crisp and a little fuller than I expected. A solid brew that I would have again."
"O - A fantastic take on a Belgian Pale Ale, and at around 5% ABV this could be wonderfully sessionable, if only it were easier for me to get!"
"O- First RR Belgian and was very pleased with it. Will have to get another one sometime."
"D: Lovely beer! Sipping this reminds me of what the monks would drink while eating their bread. Very balanced, soft, and delicate with great earthy musty notes balanced with spice and yeast and rounded out with pears and soft green apples."
"Overall I really like this rendition of the style. One of the best I've had."
"Overall, this is a solid Belgian Pale. Russian River has executed the style flawlessly. Not overly complex, but damn drinkable and great flavor. One of my favorite Belgian Pales to date. Wish I could pick this up NH/VT."
"drinkable - yep."

"This beer is an example of when I'll miss the drinkablility scores. I can see why this Belgian Single or Enkel style was created by monks for their table beer. It won't overpower any meal and quenches the thirst very well. That said, this beer really has no wow factor at all and is pretty light on flavor."
"TASTE: Starts off unassumingly dry and flat then flavor seems to build in the BACK of your palate slowly billowing forward as a the beer's unexpectedly thick mouthfeel lingers - causing multiple swallows. All the components are expertly balanced, yet strikingly separated through the wonderfully extended tasting process. The flavor is pronounced, but not overwhelming and still plays perfectly with the carbonation and slight tartness. That tanginess makes it exciting and is probably most defined by a grapefruit-like citrus flavor."
"This is a very nice beer, and a good example of the style. Nice and mellow, some good fruitiness and grains. I really like this beer, and am glad to have it, but not going to the effort it takes to get it typically."
"Many thanks to AugustGarage for the chance to taste this long time want. Poured into my Dfh snifter, pours a very light yellow hue with a little bit of head that forms a top layer of the beer. Smell- some white wine flavors, tart blonde scent. Taste- big carbonation hits the front of the palate- light, airy, refreshing. The white wine flavors are there, this is unlike any blonde ale I have ever had. Very refreshing, I would seek this out again for sure."
"This beer was completely worth the wait. A perfectly balanced light Belgian single. What makes it so unique is that it gets at citrusy/floral notes really easily, but isn't too lightheaded. It balances those tastes with some really nice medium body that's both smooth and sweet. I hear in California it goes for $5 a bottle, and that's a great price. I got it here in D.C. for $15, so I don't think I'll have this again soon, but I can't wait until I can."
"O: I really liked this beer. I also like that they chose to brew this as a single, a very unrepresented sub-genre to the BPA style. Subtle, delicate, and delicious."
"O - Overall this is a solid representation of the style. Easy to drink with low ABV and good flavors but not crazy intensity. Solid offering although not one of their Home Run beers."
"This is a delicious and quite drinkable beer. Subtle, complex, and yet still very accessible. Yum."
"Not my favorite Russian River brew (that's some tough competition!), but there was a nice complexity of flavors in such a ""small"" beer. Really refreshing and easy-drinking."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is on the higher side. Drinkability was good, it was a good beer overall and went down very easy this evening. It had a lot of bright flavors to it, but manged to stay relatively balanced. Not one of my favorite styles, but one of the better ones I've had. Very solid beer overall."
"Style ambiguity-This beer is listed on BA as Belgian Pale Ale while the bottle is labelled Blonde Ale on the front, and Belgian Style ""Single"" implying ""single abbey ale"" or (AKA monk's table beer) on the back label. To my knowledge and looking at BJCP style guidelines, blonde and BPA are different styles. It would not surprise me in the least to learn that this beer is a Belgian style Singel made from second runnings."
"Haven't had a RR brew in years cuz I can't get it in CT. This is just great and I can't wait to try more."
"This was $6 for the corked and caged 375ml bottle. Served at room temp, in a pint glass. Hazy straw with a thin beige head. Nose has some light Brett, candy malts and not too much else. Lacks depth. Taste is way too big for the style. Over malted and way too boozy. Not very sour, Brett is quite subtle, but the one thing that is on target for teh style. Medium body way thick for the style. Not a bad beer, but don't brag about being a single when it's not even close."
"Thanks to my buddy Brian for picking up two bottles of this down in Philly. He brought them into the office and I almost popped one open while I was having my tuna salad sandwich at my desk...but I did the prudent thing and waited till I got home. Gorgeous color after pouring most of the bottle into a burgundy wine glass. Reminds me a little of an Absinthe louche. Bready and sweet smelling. Head has mostly dissipated, leaving just a fine whiteness on the top. Taste is clean and very refreshing. I like this. Carbonation is great, not too heavy. I have that second bottle calling my name..."
"The flavor zips across the palate with a dry, crackling biscuit malt body with a hint of honey, spiced citrus, and floral hops. Light, bubbly body fills the mouth with ample carbonation. Mouthfeel is thin, but crisp and well carbonated enough to add some substance to each sip. Overall, a tasty ""Belgian Single"" from the seemingly unlimited talent at Russian River."
"Golden, clear, lots of tiny carbonation bubbles. Head quickly disappears. Left in its wake is a film atop this beer with what's left collecting at the edges. Aroma has green apples and spice (cinnamon?) in it. Light up front with a light middle that has apple and light smoke characteristics. Very light finish with subtle bitterness. Light body and very drinkable."
"Drinkabilty - This aint for me. Too bland and flavor easy for my taste. I didnt care for the sour aftertaste or the yeasty wheat flavor. Tried once, wont bother again. But as far as drinkabilty, its only 5.15%, if your a fan of this style, you could drink it all night im sure."
"D - A surprising offering for Russian River in some ways. It's a little below the radar, low ABV. But there is something special about it; it's simple in some ways, yes. But it is well done. Nothing wrong with that."
"Flavours come together making this blond very drinkable in a warm day."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass, there are immediate scents of honey and lightly toasted cereal as the beer pours. It is a slightly hazy, vibrant straw-yellow coloring with a nice, thick, big bubbled head. On further nasal investigation, you get some citrus highlights with some underlying coriander spice. Smells really good! The beer is spicier than the smell lets on, with a strong coriander (and a bit of clove) flavor sliding along the slightly lemony-citrus malt flavor. There is also some sour characteristic to the flavor, which blends with the beer very well. The beer is very crisp and light in mouth, and leaves a slightly sour and spiced aftertaste in your mouth that transitions into a slight puckering sour if you space out the sips long enough. The finish is smooth and clean, and the lingering tastes are pleasant. This is a good drinker."
"to be fair, this was consumed after Younger, Elder, and Sanctification, so there's a great chance it was underwhelming in comparison to those strongly conceived flavors. if anything is delightfully subtle in this beer, it was probably lost due to its placement in the tasting. sorry, redemption, it wasn't planned that way. we shall meet again. you shall receive your namesake."
"D: For the style, this is above par. Drinkability is definitely notable, just can't put my finger on what is missing here. Something seems to be lacking."
"Redemption is refreshing, light on the palate, nicely carbonated, and crisp on the palate. The dry finish adds a nice capstone to an enjoyable beer. Easy to drink, this is a very solid BSA."
"D - Pretty good. I enjoyed this one but it wasn't mind blowing by any means. Solid stuff none the less. Glad I finally got to try this one."
"Poured from bottle (batch 008) into snifter glass. Pours a slightly cloudy golden blonde color along with a solid white head and good lacing throughout the session. Dry aromas, sweet malts, and pale. Picking up some honey, biscuits, with a light flowery hop aroma. Definitely tasting some honey like butter and honey on a biscuit. Wonderful pale malts. Lightly hopped, with notes of apricots. Slightly dry mouthfeel, very clean and crisp along with decent carbonation throughout."
"D: This is my idea of an amazing session drinker. Still delivers very complex flavors while remaining light and refreshing at the same time. This is a great beer to introduce people to belgian styles."
"Very well done another score from Russian River. I really have to make my way out there to meet brewer."
"Drinkability: This falls under the radar of the other beers in the Russian River line up but is a very well crafted beer. Easy to drink and full of flavor."
"beer was poured on tap in traditional tulip with very little head. Color is golden and clear with some carbonation. Smell is of belgian yeasts. Very inviting. Taste is similar. Hard to describe, but definitely sweet and fruity with nice belgian yeast flavors. Mouthfeel is traditional belgian...lively. Nice drinkability. This beer is one that I would venture to call very sessionable. My only wish is that this was Summer right now so I can sit on the porch and drink several of these."
"Drinkability was good. Very light."
"D - Wow at only 5.15% this one is an all nighter (if you can afford it). I'd drink this all the time if I could get ahold of it easier."
"Overall I was actually a little underwhelmed by this beer. In terms of BPA their damnation is better. I know they are meant to be different, but this one just didn't ""wow"" me like most of the RR stuff does. It's almost trying to be a sour and a BPA both at the same time and never quite is either. Still a solid drinker and I'm glad I got to try it on tap."
"Full disclosure, I'm still developing my palate when it comes to sours (though this is classified as a Belgian pale ale) but of the ones I have had, this one was very accessible in terms to drinkability. It was light, with unique characteristics, dry and would make a good summertime beer."
"Very light bodied and zesty. A light spicy character as well. Finishes kinda dry. This is refreshing and carbed nice like ALL RR products. Very drinkable and I can't wait to get pints of this stuff."
"D- this is a great bpa. One of the best I've ever had in fact. I'm guessing this is the base beer for some of their barrel aged brews. I tossed some killer cheese at this and wow what a great pairing. Russian river never fails."
"Another necessary tick for my RR -tion Quest! Big thanks goes out Estocker and Kshock for allowing me to have multiple bottles of this one! Batch 008! Served from bottle into a Bell's stemmed tulip. Poured a slightly hazy pale yellow with a three finger pure white head that subsided to one and a half finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wheat, and spices. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, dark fruit, wheat, grain, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. This one honestly reminded me of a Hefe on the aroma in a way. On the flavor, it felt more like a cross between a Belgian Pale and a Saison. This was nice as it basically kept me guessing the whole time. Pretty nice flavors going on here though and the aroma was quite excellent. An absolute must try without doubt."
"D- This is a solid beer and I wish I could buy it near me. I found this very enjoyable but would not want to drink a lot of it. I got this as a extra in a trade and am very happy about it!"
"Drinkability: This a nice beer with some delightful qualities but I would probably opt for a a slightly heartier beer in exhange."
"overall this is probably the most dissapointing RR beer i've had"
"Crisp and bright with effervescent bubbles fade to a warmer, chalky ester/yeast feel. Lingering palate coating yeast and tart with mild bitterness. One of, if not THE, most complex renditions of the style I've had. When it comes to sours, it's hard to top Vinnie and the folks a RR."
"D: Finishes wonderfully clean and dry so that you can't help immediately desire another sip. I could drink this one after another."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light and kind of fluffy, but that's to be expected. Lots of prickly carbonation dances around on my tongue. Drinkability is definitely high on this one, it goes down nice and easy. This would make for a very refreshing summertime beer, I guess I need to stock up on some since the warm weather is coming...."
"D: high, with the light mouthfeel & complex flavor profile, I could definitely session this one"
"375 ml bottle batch 8. Pours a cloudy yellow straw colour with a one finger finger head and soapy lacing. Nose- lemon, lime, very slight spice. Taste- lemon grass, lime leaves,pepper, bready yeast and moderate hopping for nice punch of bitterness. Very crisp mouthfeel and refreshing as hell. A fantastic belgian style session ale."
"D: This kind of beer just isn't my personal preference."
"D: This is a superb summer beer. Gotsta get me some more."
"D- Goes down great, will definitely drink more often and put into the ""rotation""."
"Drinkability: This beer is super solid (and yet I still used the word ""delicate"" twice above...) and has a nice light body that doesn't feel like it's going to weigh you down, and an ABV that's very moderate at just over 5%; nice flavors with quite a bit to think about keeps it from being boring as well. If it was readily available to me and affordable, this could become a staple."
" The beer was almost too carbonated for me. It was also pretty light."
"Amazing beer, but not what I expected. The golden pour with a slight to medium head. I was anticipating a sweet golden ale, but this is a much more bland, pale ale with a slight tart nose. Described on the bottle as a beer that is enjoyed by monks 1/2 bottle with lunch and 1/2 bottle with dinner, this beer is very drinkable. Carbonation is much more prevalent on mouthfeel. Things coming to mind while drinking this are gym socks, lagerish, lavender and malty. Would recommend this beer for the price, but probably will not buy again."
"Taste, refreshing and light spice to it, doesn't do the odd spice or belgian clove taste, even better. Really crisp. One of my favorite summertime beers, right up there with Bruery's hottfordavidleeroth."
"An all around delicious beer. Not as complex as other russian river offerings, but i don't think it's trying to be complex. Straight forward beer."
"A delicate, well-executed beer. I can see it having strong appeal for fans of witbier and saison."
"Drinks like a champ. Each sip leaves me wanting another. This isn't typically a style I seek out, but this is a very nice beer."
"A solid offering from this great brewery. Recommended."
"D: The low abv and fairly benign taste give this moderately high drinkability."
"Drink is pretty good, low abv, delicate and tasty, the bitterness and zest gets a little heavy at times, but otherwise pretty nice."
"All around, a very drinkable beer any time."
"The CPJ"
"Taste is very mellow and tame, there's not a lot of character here to me, it's a bit light and forgettable. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and creamy with good carbonation. Finish is crisp, clean and leaves a yeasty flavor."
"Quite an impressive beer here. No flavors are too strong, but they're all there. Glad I gave this a try!"
"Easily drinkable, and very light on the palate, with each sip dancing around on the tongue. Carbonation was less than expected, but very noticeable still and pleasant. (Batch 002+, don't know which one exactly)"
"Very nice for the style. So crisp, and surprisingly complex. Thanks, Eric."
"Overall, this is a great beer. The mouthfeel is nice, dry, and crisp. Perfectly carbonated. This is a great sessionable beer by Russian River."
"D: It's a decent beer, but cannot compete with every other Russian River beer I've ever had. However, it was 1/3 of the price, so it has that going for it."
"drinks rather well. a bit more tartness would be welcome, though this drinks fine as is. Russian River continues to impress."
"Served from 375ML to tulip"
"Overall, a well-balanced ale that doesn't pack a lot of punch; rather perfect for a nice mid-afternoon aperitif on a hot summers day. Oh, and I didn't have a proper cheese to pair it with at the time, so I consumed with fresh banana and kiwi and the combo is dessert-like and tasty. I'm thinking future pairings with a fruit-tart/custard would be appropriate."
"Anyway, what a beer. It'll be one of my favorites for the foreseeable future."
"D: Excellent. This would be a big hit as the daily beer for any monk around. Light on the palate, refreshing, full of flavor."
"D= This may be the most drinkable beer I've ever had. This is awesome and reminds me a little of Westy Blonde. If I could drink this everyday I would. Amazing beer."
"Lovely stuff. On par with many of the other Russian River offerings."
"D-Very drinkable indeed. I'm not a huge fan of Belgian ales, but this hits the mark nicely."
"D: Can Russian River do no wrong?!? The best brewery in America hits another home run with Redemption."
"D: Described on the bottle as an abbey ""single", this beer is a challenge to judge against others of that category due to their rarity. The practical alternative is to compare it to some of Russian River's other low-gravity offerings. Unfortunately it is found lacking--Gaffer's bitter, Little White Lie, or even OVL stout are all more worthy and interesting. This beer comes across as a very light saison, with little more character (and possibly less) than the Bruery's Seven-Grain saison. Ultimately it is a less than perfect comparison as Redemption fails to cross a threshold of appeal for that style. A curious choice for bottled distribution, to say the least."
"The mouth is firm with ample carbonation and a dry finish. Not too spritzy, as some others of the style. Nice mellow sweetness with a citrus background. Mild breadiness comes through, and just a touch of bitterness on the finish. Wonderfully executed. Should I expect less from these guys? Drinkable? All-day-long. Great beer."
"Overall this was a excellent session/table beer that I could drink all day. The light subtle flavors are amazing and it really makes this beer extra fun trying to pick apart all the little nuances going on here. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys light bodied crisp Belgian beers or to someone who maybe is on the fence about craft beer and looking for a good gateway beer. If you get the chance to try this beer or trade for it, be sure to snag it up because this is a real winner."
"Redemption 375ml bottle, batch 008, listed as 5.15%, opened with a pop! gentle pour into wb tulip. still created huge white head, it dissipated but stuck to the glass. Beautiful orange color with golden highlights. Nose of grass and hay, like a unfiltered farmhouse ale. I don't think there is still brett in these batches? Not too funky but a little musky. Not off putting at all. Taste of yeast, citrus, biscuit with some spice. Refreshing, even though a little dry. Dry and slightly bitter ending."
"D - This is really easy to drink, and thankfully doesn't have medicinal quality I get from some Belgian Pales. However, it doesn't ""pop"" (flavor-wise) in the same way that Westvleteren Blonde or Westmalle Extra do. I'm curious how different the Brett version was."
"Bravo."
"D - Goes down super easy since its not too sour...great thirst quenching brew."
"Nice bitterness through the malts. Strong alcoholic flavors followed by sweet fruits. Sour apples that have been rotted mildy. Very nicely carbonated, dry and smooth. Well above average drinkability. Very complex and interesting brew. Would love to session this one."
"D - This is an alright beer, but nothing I would call profound. Something just seems to be missing from it, a bit bland. Granted, I am not a fan of this style, but it seems stuck between being a light beer and a full on triple, would rather it just pick a direction."
"375ml bottle courtesy of GRG1313. Batch#8. Served in my ST tulip. Pours a light, hazy, yellowish-orange with a loose, half inch white head that quickly dissipates into a loose skim with dense dollops dispersed across the surface. Nose is style consistent - cloves, lemon rind and a trace of coriander. Taste consistent with nose - flavor profile is quite herbal with perhaps the addition of rosemary. Citrus character is a bit more subdued than suggested by the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and a dry finish. A good Belgian Pale ale; however, perhaps a bit too herbal for my liking. Nonetheless, a solid example of the style."
"Large volumous head, very clear light light light golden body. The nose is an odd strong crushed white pepper aroma, musty brett, but not at all in a leather/horse style, not at all. The flavor is very unique in an indifferant way, three are alot of interesting flavors, but they arn't super apealing flavors, but not bad in any sort. A lot of salty and peppery soft cheeses and dough, with a hard stale bread wheaty-ness. very light and drinkable mouthfeel, not super crisp in the carbination dept, and this is more enjoyable as a sipper, but it's very easy to drink none the less."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow, with a big white head. In the aroma, quite yeasty and hints of fruit. In the taste, fruity and a dry to small tart yeastyness.A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice fruit presence and nice small tartness, almost saison like."
"D: Pretty good. Just makes me think of something that one would drink at a barbecue. It's good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one. I could drink a number of these since it's light and not too filling, but I wouldn't really want to. It's a good beer, but its just not that special."
"D-easy-drinking, could drink A few of these. But it does leave a little bit something behind in the mouth"
"overall - very solid beer. I could drink a lot of this, especially in the summer. amazingly drinkable. i have to restrain myself from chugging it."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a vrey light pilsner malt scent along with a hint of musty farmhouse funk. It's extremely light and earthy; very nice. The taste is good. It has a quaffable pilsner malt flavor with a slight hint of Brett in the finish. It not overly complex, but it's damn drinkable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an extremely drinkable beer; complex yet easy drinking."
"D- This is an interesting beer. The flavors are a little weak but still good. Very good mouthfeel. I would be interested in trying this if brett were added or if it were aged in some kind of wine barrel."
"Slightly hazy, milky yellow color with a white head. Delicate lemony and spicy phenols in the aroma. Light lemon pepper flavor, yeasty with a bitter herbal hop finish. A great beer to have a few of. Packaging is very dramatic for a beer like this though."
"Belgians are not my favorite and I have not tried many but I am a fan of this beer. Russian River never disappoints."
"D - This truly is a sessionable Belgian-style ale that is absolutely delicious."
"D - definitely drinkable, only 5% abv and delicious might I add. If these were common out east, I might have a new session beer."
"Overall a very good version of the style. Hopefully it will be available in bottles (in Colorado) soon."
"Drink- Very light and clean. Would be a great session beer in my opinion if not for the cost per bottle."
"Citrusy in flavor, some hoppiness to it too. The finish is some wheat grains and the esters come out in the middle a lot. The beer is relatively light in body (although next to the Sanctification its not that light) and the carbonation is appropriate in the mouth. Its not distracting at all, just really present. It drinks easily and I really enjoy it. I'd have ti again. Maybe I'll pick up some bottles of it."
"The beer tastes pretty much like it smells. Lemon, yeast, pepper, and oranges, which I did not pick up in the aroma. Light to medium bodied, highly carbonated, smooth, and easy to drink. I am glad I was able to get this from South Bay Drugs before they ran out."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The beer pours a very light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is lemons, wheat, oranges and Belgian yeast. The flavor is yeast, citrus fruit, pepper and bubblegum. The beer is very juicy tasting. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not incredibly complex, but a nice, flavorful Belgian single. Glad I got to try this one."
"D: This is a light and far too easy to drink. A perfect entry level beer for those new to Belgians and a well crafted brew all around."
"d - I thought this was a very drinkable Belgian Pale Ale. The low ABV and light body made me think I could drink a lot of this. I would have liked more citrus than pepper in the taste, but a good beer I would drink again."
"Overall, a pleasure to try. Thanks Charlie!"
"Had this one on tap up at the Oskar Blues Restaurant in Longmont, CO. Pours a bright golden color with a big white head. Light peppery hops on the nose, along with bananas and a little Belgian yeast. On the palate, this one is crisp and light bodied, with earthy bitterness, herbal hops and a crisp finish. Overall not bad, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"D - I can't see myself getting this one again."
"D-A very easy drinking beer with a surprising amount of flavor. Great job Russian River."
"Redemption pours a pilsner gold color (although not a pilsner). It has loose carbonation that is about one finger high and fades rather quickly to some floaters and a ring. This smells more like a saison to me than anything-I get straw, hay, grass and just a touch of light horse blanket. Aroma is on the faint side. Some noble hops too. Tastes are of biscuit, some sweetness, a little straw and grass flavors with a bitter hop finish. There is a mild fruityness mid palate. Redemption could use a bit more carb and body. Its a little watery honestly. Drinks really really well despite disappointing mouthfeel. Highly sessionable. Glad to have a few of these as I will be aging them for some time."
"Light body beer is easy to drink and would make a nice session beer, but it doesn't stand out with any notable qualities."
"D: Solid BPA, the regular unsoured Belgian style beers from RR haven't impressed me too much, but I did enjoy this bottle."
"D - I easily fnished the 375 mL bottle and could have drank more...not that it was the best beer I've ever had, but I could have drank more. It's got nice flavor for a light ABV beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the carbonation was playful and not over the top. Extremely drinkable. I put this one away and was definitely left wanting more."
"Overall and awesome beer that I wish I could keep around my house on the cheap. 6ers of this would be awesome."
"D: Russian River is one of those breweries that seems to do everything right and Redemption is no exception. Perfect body for the style and just the right amount of complexity and flavor to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a try along with all of their other offerings!"
"Pours a clear light golden/yellow color with a bone white head. Aroma is intense Pilsner malt. Very malty and clean. Cereal, crackers, fresh barley on top of some subtle but noticeable fruity esters. The malt stands out more than the yeast character though you can tell this is a Belgian style beer - it's just cleaner than normal. Taste is crisp, super dry, thirst quenching. Fruitiness is in the taste as well but it is subtle and not intense. Quick, bone dry finish. This is very quaffable. I like this style of beer and this is a good example...."
"Bottle, most recent batch. Pours a light, clear honey gold with a large white head. Nose is heavy on Belgian yeast, banana, maybe some lighter fruits. Something kind of earthy in there as well. Flavor profile is a bit thin and flat. It seems to have not yet fully matured to the point where the flavor can really express itself. Of course heavy on that abbey yeast, some musty banana, maybe a little bit of spice. Thin and not that interesting, not really up to par for the style either."
"Not bad, pretty one sided beer, a bit boring, but I guess that is the style they were going for..."
"My last beer of the night at Russian River. Poured a solid gold with a frothy white finger of head. Smells spicy, Belgian yeasty. Tastes floral, spicy, a bit of citrus and a punch of Belgian yeast to the tastebuds. Creamy, and full of tiny smooth bubbles. Very drinkable. Another winner by RR."
"D - One of the difficulties I have with some of the better Belgian style beers is the high level of alcohol and related heat. This beer shows a flavor level and complexity that to me rivals some of the better tripels out there, but doesn't have the associated burn factor that makes them such sippers. This is truly drinkable...only 5.15% alcohol, no burn. This is a great Belgian session beer. Looking forward to more of this...in the near future and with a bit of age on it too."
"D: I was thoroughly impressed when I had this on tap at the brewery, but the bottle is letting me down a bit. This is still a great beer that is crazy drinkable and impressively complex for a fairly low alcohol brew, but I'd still prefer its Belgian counterparts."
"quite light and easy with a great combination of flavors that come together well."
"D-A damn near perfect session ""wild"" ale, absolutely! This stuff is simply amazing! So light yet so flavourfull this brew could not get much better. Another exquisite concoction from the mind of Vinnie Cilurzo."
"D - Light, crisp, refreshing, easy drinking, this is beer is pretty good. Very clean but the light body lends to making the flavors a little muted."
"Truly amazing complexity for the low alcohol content. A seriously delicious beer."
"D - I find this to be a really session-able Belgian. Its a complex beer that you would think has a higher alcohol content but at 5.15% ABV its very drinkable."
"Drinkability - Extremely quaffable. Honestly, not a beer I would pick up all the time, but definitely glad I was able to get some of these for the future."
"An awesome session beer and a solid offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"jd"
"D: it drank really good and was a good interpretation of a belgian style pale ale. I'm glad I still have a couple more bottles of this in the cellar."
"Batch 008 from 375ml corked bottle. 5.15 ABV. Pours a very pretty, slightly cloudy golden color with a medium sized white head. Very bubbly. Scent is very strong on the Belgian yeast with hints of lemon, maybe a bit of orange peel, a bit of meat, and a slight hint of funk. Very nice, complex smelling beer. The taste is a little hoppy with a nice clean Belgian finish. Great lemon zest flavors with coriander and other delicious spices. Lots of lemon. The beer has a great mouthfeel with a very dry finish. Drinkability is EXTREMELY high. I'm very glad they bottled this right before I stopped by the brewery last weekend."
"D-Among the best non-sour ales I've had from Russian River."
"D - I could drink quite a few of these. Very drinkable."
"The bottle calls this a ""single", meaning a monk's table beer like Chimay Doree or Westmalle Extra I guess, and in that way this approaches every sense with a light touch. The beer tastes a little citrusy and crisp, with just hints of the horse blanket or barnyard or whatever you get from Bret. The sweetness is really light too, making this a delicious beer to sip through an entire 750, nearly perfect again. Light bodied and low alcohol, this is what drinkability is all about. I will never hesitate to buy this again when I see it, highly recommended."
"So drinkable, this beer is exceptional. I recommend to any and all."
"Drinkability- Very light and thirst quenching. I find myself gulping more than sipping."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: A tasty, refreshing beverage the likes of which I sadly overlook most of the time. I should get more of these. A very well-crafted ""single"" ale, although at $8 to $9 it's not something I'll pick up often."
"D: A great table beer that is easy to sit back and enjoy a few of"
"An excellent ""table beer," light in flavor, but very well balanced."
"Haven't had a Redemption in at least 18 months. It's a really flavorful Belgian style beer that is low in the abv department. An ideal session beer if you love Belgian styled beers."
"Overall, not a bad beer at all. My first RR that isn't a sour and I dig it. I'd rather have had this in the summer, then I think it would be superb. Still, a well done beer."
"This has a lighter body but the carbonation engulfs the mouth so thickly that it almost feels heavier than it is. This is definitely a very nice beer for the style, although score-wise it is handicapped from the get go."
"D: The taste on this is slightly muted in comparison to the nose, but a fantasticly blended beer that if this were distributed my way, could potentially be my new session beer."
"One of the best Belgian style beers I've had in this ABV range. It's drinkable, and mild yet reasonably tasty. Worth trying."
"D: This isn't really my favorite style, but Russian River never really seems to disappoint. This beer has some good flavors and a nice light mouthfeel."
"I am having a hard time savoring this bottle. Redemption is easily a beer that is more than the sum of its parts, hence the 5 for drinkability. Together it just shines bright. A manageable abv makes for easy drinking. Would be a great lunch time beer, quenching, light. Highly recommended. Russian River is a brewery without many peers."
"75cl bottle, batch 005, thanks to larryLSB for picking this one up at the brewpub today. Golden body with a big rocky head and lots of visible carbonation. The aroma is a little fruity, with pear and lemon, some spice and honey. Light to medium bodied with a clean scrubbing feeling from the carbonation. Goes down light but super smooth and drinkable. Flavors of yeast and light apple-pear fruitiness, ending pretty dry and with an assertive herbal, leafy hoppy bite. Drinks like a perfectly balanced Bohemian Pilsener, with the added complexity and fruitiness of a Belgian ale. If I could get this in sixers, I think I would be drinking this all summer. Very light and refreshing, but not lacking in flavor and complexity."
"Overall: I can see myself buying a bottle of this and enjoying it a hot summer day, but won't go out of my way in acquiring it. Cheers!"
"D: Very drinkable and a great example of the style."
"Light crisp fruit (apple, tart pear, etc.) and a lemony honey thing going on in the finish and aftertaste. Creamy and light mouthfeel and overall a really good beer. It's totally too light and mild compared to the rest of my RR adventures, but this was a really good brew!"
"Drinkability: High, not my favorite for the style, but I very much appreciate the low ABV."
"Thanks again ipa247, I'll be back again."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my trusty Duvel tulip. This bottle is Batch 003. The ale appears a clear golden straw yellow color with about two fingers of foamy white head. The head leaves a minimal lace on the inside of my glass. Aromas and flavors consist of fruits such as pears, white grapes, apples, beautifully toasted grain and caramelized malt, a great balance of sweet and bitter. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Mildly pungent/sour/bitter finish and a little spicy as well. Killer drinkability and worth seeking out."
"D - Drinkability is very good. The low alcohol makes this one easy to quaff and the overall flavor just keeps you picking up the glass again and again. The alcohol is almost completely masked behind the delicate Belgian flavors. 750ml? No problem. This is a brew that I could work on for an entire session. Overall, this beer is great and an exceptional take on the style. Highly recommended."
"I'm not sure that Vinnie and crew had anything in particular that needed to be redeemed, but if they did, this more than does the trick. Redemption is a top notch Belgian Pale that fits pretty squarely within its style guidelines. The use of Brett here works wonders. It complements its Belgian Pale characteristics wonderfully. There's no question that Russian River brews wonderful beer and Redemption is no exception. Do yourself a favor and find a bottle...now."
"I could and would drink this all night if I had access to it. At 5.65% this beer isn't hurting anyone. The look, aroma, taste, mouthfeel, finish, and drinkability make this an amazing beer to drink. I would love more of this one. Time to check out the trading forum."
"Redemption is a very good beer. I don't know if it's heresy to speak so of a Russian River creation, but after just a few sips of this I was ready to go fire up the lawnmower. Nice summer sipper."
"Drinkability: Redemption is beauty and glamor and mystique and intrigue, all with a supremely high drinkability and level of refreshment."
" Aroma of light, spicy Belgian yeast, slightly sweet pale malt, a touch of citrusy hops, and a faint whiff of coriander. Palate is well-balanced between mildly sweet malt and the sublimely sweet, fruit hop profile. Notes of honey and coriander are detectable. The lively, effervescent body subsides into a smooth swallow, followed by a dry finish. A pleasant, drinkable offering that I would definitely seek out again."
"Another in the long line of solid Belgian style brew from Russian River. This one is very drinkable and, while not the most complex of their brews, makes an extremely good session beer."
"Overall this is a very nice beer from a style that doesn't have a whole lot of entries. Certainly worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel is beautifully creamy but light. God but what I wouldn't give to have this beer widely available enough to be my go-to summertime beer. A beautiful example of one of my absolute favorite beer styles, the underrated and underrepresented abbey single."
"9/4/9/5/17 (4.4/5)"
"Bottle from a liquor store in Napa. Pours a cloudy orange/yellow color with a strong dense white/yellow head. Big sticky lacing. Smells of spicy hops, sthanol and oranges. Noticeable fruity yeast on the nose too. Reserved, yet complex flavor. Nice citrus tang, muted and slightly cotton like. Fruity and spicy with a good malt base. Soft ethanol on the finish and a hop bitterness too. Smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied. Drinks very nicely. Perfect at the end of a long day and after a good homecooked meal."
"D - One of the better American brewed Belgians and at 5%, a very nice session beer."
"Malt and herb flavors. A hint of sweet carmel, funk. No Brett? Yeast strain must be wild as it has a very odd complex funk going on. Creamy texture is nice. Could of told me it was belgian and I'd believe it. Reminded me of other beers but I can't put my finger on exactly which one. Could see this improving with bottle age, though this was from Keg at O'Briens 15th annv."
"D - So much flavor for a beer with a lower ABV. A lovely highly sessionable beer."
"A very drinkable, well-balanced creamy Belgian-style pale with a soft, pleasant floral aftertaste. Very well-done!"
"D: Could drink a lot of this."
"Not bitter by any means, but some hops are noticeable along with the fruit flavors. Once again with some yeastiness- a little estery and peppery. Alcohol not present at all- as it should be with this low ABV, sessionable brew. As I stated in my Damnation review, I would choose Damnation over this. To boot, from what I understand, Damnation is much more readily available throughout CA and even PA. Makes it a clear decision for me."
"Batch 5. It's not a great looking beer, but that's one of the few less than entirely positive things that I'll say. The color is nice. There's little head. It looks a bit like apple cider. The nose is sweet and earthy with notes of citrus, cardamom, nutmeg and farm. The flavor is spicy and very full for a 5% abv beer, even a good Belgian 5% abv beer. It's crisp and cleanly Belgian. There's some lemon in the front and some interesting and light malt through the middle. The beer ends with a lingering bitter finish. The feel is sparkly and spicy. It has a lot of flavor and fullness even for a Belgian Pale Ale. On top of everything, it's a very drinkable beer, easy on the palette, the stomach and the head."
"Tap @ Stone Beer Gardens. Pours clear gold with good carbonation and a frothy white head. Yeast esters, banana, clove, and spice fill the nose. Light mouthfeel compliments the taste. Banana, lemon, breadiness up front with malt and spice in the back. Like a Belgian Pale crossed with a trippel. Yum."
"M/D - Light and clean in the mouth. Very crisp and incredibly easy drinking. An exceptional beer that enjoyed more than its big brother, Damnation."
"D-This is a very good Belgian Pale that could be quite sessionable. The execution of this style is done well here by Russian River. A beer that I would trade for again. Looking forward to trying more Russian River brews in the future!"
"Drinkability: Extraordinarily drinkable, with plenty of complexity; I like the way it stays dry throughout"
"D: Pretty good for drinkability, but not terribly high abv."
"D: This whole 750 is disappearing way too fast. What a drinkable beer!"
"A beautiful pour that is shimmering golden and quite clear. Great steady carbonation and a creamy white head that has unbelievable retention. It remains through the entire 750ml bottle and leaves sticky lacing down the glass. A refreshing smell that is light and airy but very complex. Soft and sweet fruits. Pear, orange, green apple, lemon. A light bready yeast and just a slight sour tinge in the end. Taste is excellent. Some sour up front along with the fruit. Slightly earthy as well with the slightest hint of funkiness and spice. Light grain and bread with a drying finish. In the mouth it's crisp and extremely smooth. A nice dryness in the finish with a tingle on the tongue, perfect carbonation. This is a memorable beer for sure. One that I wish I had on hand at all times. Complex, refreshing, and very approachable. I owe younger35 a big, big thank you for sending this as an extra many moons ago. I didn't know what to expect but what I got was pretty amazing to say the least. One of my favorite brews in recent and long term memory."
"Pretty drinkable beer, another good brew from Russian River."
"D - Very drinkable. There is a nice offset between the malts and the hops."
"Drinkability- My favorite of any of the brews that I've had so far from Russian River has been Temptation. It's a barrel aged Blonde Ale and absolutely delicious. This is a simpler version of that and I don't want to say I like it better, but it's exactly what I was hoping for. I love the drinkability and how well crafted and ""simple"" this brew is (I use simple as a description of the deliciousness, I know this brew is far from simple to make). A ridiculously awesome brew that I wish I would have grabbed a case more of."
"D - wow, that was a great beer! I could drink this again easily!"
"Drinkability is OK, a pretty simple little beer, not really my taste, I'd prefer fruitier esters or more brett funk, which is very subdued at this point. I have another bottle, and am in no hurry to open it. Maybe it will funk up a bunch in a few years, maybe it will fall apart...either way, this was boring enough that I'm willing to wait and see."
"For the flavors this beer represents, I enjoyed it. So, if you are a fan of the style, I'd definitely recommend. Personally, I probably won't be getting this one again."
"The beer pours is a beautiful, effervescent, straw golden color with a substantial frothy head and great retention. Redemption smells of lemon and spices. The taste is bitter up front and spicy. There are some mild citrus notes and the finish is dry. The mouthfeel is creamy and the beer is well carbonated."
"Pours a clear light amber with a creme head. Nose is doughy funk. Citrus is quite present too. Flavor is nice. Smooth with a bit of an edge that's mostly funky. Bit of an acidic bite to it. The most consistent flavor character is an earthy dough. Feel has an attacking carbonation that seems to linger on the tongue. Liquid is thicker and a bit sticky really. A nice drinker. An earthy BPA, but a nice one to drink. Another tasty RR production."
"This is now my favorite session brew of all time. It is great on a hot day and I would love to be close enough to make this one of my session brews."
"A very well crafted low alcohol beer. Great session, although I prefer to take it down very slowly to enjoy all its nuances."
"Overall, Redemption is another fantastic brew from Russian River. I am falling in love with this amazing brewery."
"Drinkability is excellent- I could have a number of these any time of the year- suitable lightness in character for the summer but deep, complex, and warming for the winter."
"Thanks to Andy (jgaston) for sending this back in May; I may have to hit you up for another at some point for a re-taste!"
"Notes: Got this from Largadeer in my second trade and finally delved into it. My first RR turned out to be a tasty example of their craftsmanship. If anything, I'm even more stoked to try the other offerings in my cellar. Shit, my mom liked this."
"This is an easy drinker, tasty and interesting but not overdone."
"Overall I thought this was an excellent beer. However with that being said, has to be my least favorite of all the Russian River offerings I have tried. Just something about it was not right, or a little off. Oh well though, still better then half the other offerings out there. Definitely go out and try this one. It is a great thing for the hot weather."
"750ml batch 004 bottle courtesy of either KingG or swnicholson, thanks! My bottle lists the ABV as 5.65% if that matters to anyone. The color of this beer is a beautiful, mostly clear golden with a large white head that laces the glass pretty well. It smells slightly medicinal, minerals and a hint of fruit in the back. The taste is nice, subtle, and hard to describe. This reminds me of a true Belgian but i can't think of which one. This is a very easy beer to drink and something perfect for the summer"
"D: Only 5%? The alcohol never stood but I never thought that it would be that low. An excellent offering with a spicy flavor that will please."
"The taste has qualities of a lighter take on an ESB blended with a hefewiezen, very fruity with light grain, citrus, hints of herbs and pine, a little yeast. The finish is a mix of of grain, fruit and herbs. Lightly sweet, it is balanced with light bitterness and a very faint yeasty sourness. Light, crisp, refreshing and easy to drink, it still has plenty of flavour and well-rounded character."
"Drink ability: This is just simply a Belgian session beer for me. I could drink this guy damn near all day and be just fine with it. Smooth, tasty, easy drinkin."
"Redemption is yet another good beer from Russian River. They never fail to disappoint. They hit the nail on the head with a style that's tough to come across. I wouldn't mind another bottle or two of Redemption."
"IMHO a damn near perfect session beer... I could drink this all night.. unfortunately this was my last bottle."
"p.s. if it isn't clear from the reviews, this beer is no longer refermented with brettanomyces (not since batch 001, this was an 004)."
"D- This is a great summer drinker, very sessionable. I really enjoyed this one, and makes me think of summer- I love summer."
"Drinkability is also good, nice light and refreshing, easy to drink but the carbonation makes it a bit hard to drink really fast. Overall another quality brew from Russian River. Perhaps more mellow in flavor than most of theirs but I expected that going in, afterall it's a blonde ale, but it's well executed."
"D: Tasty, but less than I expected. I wonder how this bottle would change with more days/weeks/months/years cellared."
"Taste is spicy/hoppy/eathy with pepperty floral notes, and a sweet biscuit malt finish tinged with bittering hop metal. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is good. A great trappist style Belgian single."
"Pairs great with food, it would compliment, not overwhelm it's pairing very good beer, just wish it wasn't so difficut to come by in Minnesota."
"Thanks to Uncle Mattie. This is the batch 002 with no bret. It is all about yeast and a touch of funky aroma after the initial glass. Very drinkable and sessionable but not that complex. Soft on the tongue, this is a changeup for the RR brews I have had to date. Cloudy and lace."
"Pours a cloudy golden/straw yellow, nice thick white head, settles down to a decent layer, lots of lace spots on the glass. Smell is nice, honey and wheat, floral and citrus, yeast, a bit grassy, really fragrant and enjoyable. Taste is similar, honey, wheat, biscuits, nice solid malts, apricot and grapefruit, grass/hay, very fresh flavour. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium to high carbonation, very refreshing mouthfeel, I really enjoy this and could drink it all day on the patio. Thanks Jan!"
"My least favorite beer yet from Russian River, very bland for something from this brewery, did not taste like much of a Belgian to me, not enough brettanomyces either, not recommended compared anything else they produce"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, and I would have it regularly on-tap if it were available, but it's not. I would pick it up again."
"Batch 002, aged in my cellar for a while. I'm a big fan of all the Russian River beers and this was no exception. In fact I think this is drinking so well right now that I really think its one of my favorite of theirs. Pours a hazy golden with a nice big head, but not overcarbonated at all. Settles to a medium cap that sticks around. Aromas of floral honey, as well as lemon, and orange blossoms. The barest hint of sour on the finish. Beautifully integrated nose. It just keeps getting better. The taste is slightly sour up front, followed by beautiful lemon, orange and floral flavors. Amazingly integrated as a harmonious whole, it turns slightly sweet on the end, and a tinge of bitterness right at the very finish. The mouthfeel has just enough carbonation. It's crisp and delicious. Another great beer from Russian River."
"This beer is great. Buy it."
"Notes - It would be foolish to underestimate this beer because of it's low ABV and lack of flash or hype, as it's a truly fantastic brew."
"drinkability is great. good balance and very interesting."
"Thin bodied but full of fruity flavors and prickly carbonation and brisk acidity. Light buttery brett flavors with a nice yeasty dry finish. Very drinkable. The same stone fruit flavors but without the citrus aspect. An easily sessionable brew."
"I enjoyed this brew quite a bit. It was a good Belgian for someone that doesn't drink a lot of them. It was smooth and much cleaner than I expected. I'd definitely recommend it and wouldn't mind having this one again."
"This one pours a murky bright straw-yellow hue with a two finger super pillowy ultra white head that slowly dies down to a nice layer. Stickiness is very good, holds on all over the sides. Smell is strong floral yeast notes with a powerful citrus aroma. Big lemongrass scent with a hint of white bread. Taste starts off with a nice citrus pine flavor of mainly grapefruit with a very mild bready tones. I expected much more in terms of yeast somewhere on the tongue. The aftertaste is even of hops but more in the pine department with a hint of sweet butter. I like this beer more because of the lack of yeast in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is a fluffy medium body with a good amount of carbonation. I was very surprised by this beer, in a good way. Seems like a pretty American-ized Belgian beer. Russian River once again proves they know what they're doing, even when it comes to a low abv. brew."
"I really like this beer. Even though this beer won't ""wow"" you with big flavors or complexity, I really enjoyed it. I don't think I have enjoyed a beer this much that is this ""small"" and subtle in quite some time, as I tend to gravitate towards big beers. This one would be great in the summertime. Another winner from RR."
"Cheers!"
"D - Such a great Bel Pale. I found it to be a great session strength Belgian w/ lots of flavor. There were plenty of citrus and light fruit notes. The taste is what makes this incredibly drinkable."
"The beer pours a light gold, almost lemony color. There is decent head retention and very good lacing. Pretty impressive looking for a Belgian Blond/Single (style). On the nose this beer is other wordly. Man, the cajones it takes to make a beer that smells like this. I get this incredible smell of honey and saurkraut, with enough funk in the nose to scare me (I'm not a fan of sour beers). However, there was nothing to fear, as this beer on the palate was moderately sweet and quite light on its feet. It's quite delicious and very refreshing. There are some sweet apple and cherry flavors, but they're not at all over done. There's just a hint of bitterness in the finish, and ultimately this is as drinkable a beer as I've ever encountered. A fine effort from Russian River brewing."
"D- Delicious but a bit complex and not the most drinkable session brew but none the less it went down pretty easy."
"Taste is belgian yeast, some light fruits, and a hint of lemon. Almost hefeweizenish. Delicious, drinkable, I want more."
"Beer poured a cloudy yellow with a white bubbly head that is leaving lacing in my Duvel glass. Nose is classic Belgian, spicy and citric-very nice, Taste has hints of sour apple and citrus with a bit of coriander. Finish is with a llight apple hop. Mouthfeel is very effervescent, light to medium bodied, Beer glides nicely across the palate. Drinkability is exceptional! This is definitely a world class blonde/pale ale!"
"d- An interesting ""belgian single"" that is very drinkable, the 5.3%abv is very well-masked and this could well be a session beer if only there was a bit more complexity to the taste, would be nice on a hot summer day and could pair with a whole range of entrees (fish, chicken, etc)."
"<edit - Funny, I thought I liked the first batch better, but reviewing my original review shows I rated it just the same. Interesting...>"
"A very light and drinkable belgian style pale ale. The type of beer you could have a few of and not get overloaded with aggressive flavors."
"Batch 003. Got from my buddy who went to RR last month and got a bunch of RR's. Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into my NBB snifter. It was a hazy golden yellow color with some yeast bits. I poured it slowly as the bottle advised but still got a good sized head. It stuck around for the entire session. Tons of carb and good lacing. The aroma was really good. It was malty and piney with some hops in there. It also had a spiciness that reminded me of a saison. The taste was pretty good but it had a weird taste in the back that left an slightly unpleasant taste on the tongue. It got better at the end when warm but kept this from being great. Shame cause the aroma really had me psyched for this one. Mouthfeel was also hurt by the aftertaste. Overall, a good beer but it just missed the greatness mark for me. Will have to try again when I finally visit the brewery though. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"Did a side by side tasting with this and Damnation. This one pours a light amber straw color with a bit of white head. It was slightly cloudy because some of the yeast got into the glass, but I like to drink the yeast anyway. The aroma isn't what I expected. It had a good malty body with some woodsy hop aroma. There is also an overall yeasty smell behind everything else. The flavor is fairly sweet but with some hop bitterness to balance. I can actually taste some hops as well. This is a good beer and I was pleasantly surprised."
"I would drink this every day if it were available."
"Originally reviewed March 31. 2007. Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. On tap. Nose of light candied Belgian phenols, yeasty and bready alike. Clear gold pour, with soap in white. Rich, spicy peppery tooth with a hint of sweet lemon, rounding full grain flavor and a satisfying light malt body over an amazing drinkability. Lemon thyme crispness curls balance in the back end. A truly satisfying beer in every sense."
"From the corked and caged 500 ml bottle purchased from the brewpub this poured a cloudy yellow gold with a nice sized white head that left average lacing. Big nose of fruit, with banana first, but also touches of apple, pears, and apricot. Mouthfeel is rich and almost oily. Yeasty flavor and a dry finish. Nice Belgian Ale."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for the generous sample."
"The 4.8% abv on the bottle isn't at all apparent, making for an exceptionally refreshing session ale. Now tracking down more is my new task..."
"This is a beer that treads lightly both in colour and taste but don't get me wrong , the lightness is still complex and funky. Considering that this based on what the monks drink for lunch I took awhile to appreciate the underlying fruit notes and the yeasty complexity. The finish was a little short but I never lost interest in the beer."
"D: A very easy drinking, smooth and enjoyable beer. The ABV makes it a definite candidate for a session beer. My first single and I really enjoyed it."
"Another RR beer that doesn't disappoint."
"Overall a dry refreshing beer with a definate Belgian character. Eminently drinkable"
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a nice easy drinking Belgian Pale Ale. It is simple, but tasty."
"For my money, Allagash and Russian River are the only two American craft breweries that consistently release world-class Belgian-style ales. Energetic mouthfeel or not, Redemption has no need to seek redemption from me. It's an outstanding version of an often overlooked style that is improved immeasureably by the inspired use of Brettanomyces. I'm a Russian River fan for life."
"This beer was amazingly drinkable. You don't normally get so much flavor and complexity out of a beer just under 5% ABV. I could see making this my go-to session beer, if I only had more than this one bottle... Thanks to BeerBeing for shipping this all the way out to the west, it has traveled cross-country and back, and it is just fine..."
"Vinnies Orval?"
"D: Strange brew indeed, I was expecting much more from this one. Awesome in the apperance and mouthfeel catergories however was extremely lacking in the others. Would be interested to have this from the source to see if it was more flavorfull. Thanks to GClarkage for bringing this one up to MT this past summer."
"Body is fairly light, but very airey and fluffy in texture. Awesome mouthfeel, and easy to drink."
"I enjoyed several samples of this tasty brew at the Bluezapalooza beer fest @ Mammoth Mtn, in the Sierra, reviewed from notes (yeah I was that guy at the fest taking notes.) Poured cloudy light yellowy amber, with a wispy, fine, active near white head, and leaving plenty of fine lacing. Spicy nose and flavor notes, yeast, coriander and tasty Belgian spice. Love the style, so it was a treat to try this highly drinkable brew fresh on tap and have a chance to chat with some of the friendly RR servers. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp and dry with plenty of carbonation as well. Goes down easily and is quite refreshing. I could easily see myself drinking mass quantities of this brew if it was readily available. The low abv combined with the wonderful flavor makes it a no brainer. Another solid brew from Russian River. Thanks to Callenak for sending this one my way!"
"Thanks to Stonecrusher for clearing this one out of the cellar."
"Thanks to the King of Bums for some more RRBC."
"D: Very good. Go get some."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Jimbowood): Poured slightly hazy yellowish ale with a super huge foamy head with great retention. Perfect aroma of Brett is very nice with dry hops and some floral malt. Taste is mildly sour at first with some nice floral peak and ends with a dry finish. Body is quite full which kind of surprise me because of the low ABV I was expecting some light beer. Overall, this is a truly wonderful beer and I very much appreciated the fact that even though the alcohol is low enough the taste and body are reasonably strong."
"Light gold in color and very hazy, topped by a big chunky egg-white head. The nose has biscuit and bread dough, a light lemon citrus, mildly spicy, white pepper. The flavor is builds. Biscuit bread up front followed by the citrus. The citrus has a bit more orange than lemon in the flavor. The finish has a tartness that is difficult to place. Its really a mild astringency, mildly tart. I love the carbonation in the Russian River beers. They are full, yet refreshing. Very drinkable. Its great to see an American brewer succeed with this style."
"750 ml bottle, batch 001. This beer poured a nice golden color with an immense fizzy and fluffy head. It took quite awhile for the head to disapate but once it did I got a nose of spice and yeast and a bit of hops. All very pleasing. The taste was equally pleasing. The initial taste was a bit of corriander and other spices, herbal and also yeasty with a good backbone of hops to round things out. After a few more sips I picked up some nice fruit notes which also helped to make this beer very well balanced and drinkable. Another winner from Vinnie. Can't wait to open a few more bottles of this...they are lingering in my basement."
"Drinkability: A miracle of flavor and low abv; you'll want to drink this all night and guess what? You can! Too bad it's not more widely available, because this could be a wildly popular beer if it were. Very highly recommended."
"After several months, the brett character has come out more strongly in this batch, and I'm much pleased by that. A little more brett was all this beer needed to move from ""okay"" to ""pretty damned good..."""
"overall an amazingly good drinking beer. dry, light, complex and delicious."
"Bottle, thanks Ernest. Light blonde color. Medium-sized white head, which lasts well. Lovely pineapple and mango brett infused aromas, with hints of lemon, as well as a hint of toast. Really nicely balanced and it certainly achieves a lot from a little. It has a lot of full fledged fruit flavors, that are not typical in any beers out there. I suppose this is great, considering the style and a.b.v., but truthfully, I dont find it all that exciting."
"Russian River never disappoints."
"750ml bottle from batch 001. Quick erupting big white bubbly head over a cloudy golden orange color body. Good sticky lace was left coating the glass. Light yeasty funkiness with a good spiciness filled the nose. A bit of citric scents as well as some sweetness from light fruit notes. Light fruity notes with some of the expected funky yeast notes. Light peppery spice over some fruit. A bit bready and herbal peak through towards the end. A milder flavor but still packed with plenty of taste. Lighter and crisp in the mouth this seems like a perfect fit for a lighter beer like this. Extremely easy drinking stuff too boot."
"This is an amazingly complex beer for only 4.8%. I would drink this all the time if I could - it is the perfect ""session"" Belgian style. I can't wait to try the Damnation."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking but the yeast is off putting after a while. Pretty one dimensional but well crafted."
"Muchas gracias to cmaruschak for sharing. Batch 001: Cloudy pale golden color with a medium off-white and foamy/fizzy head that dissipates steadily. Spotty lacing does not stick too much. Sweet aroma of cloves, hay and yeast. Light-bodied and soft on the palate with flavors of tropical fruit and sweet spices, along with touches of earthy malt. Citrus zest is apparent at times too. The finish is dry and zesty at first, and leaves a lingering yeast flavor. Straightforward and clean, its not the most complex RR beer I have tried but works well for what it is."
"I am a sucker for these light, yet full flavored, Belgian-inspired beers. Especially with a touch of Brett; in fact the Brett really makes this beer. I don't need all that boozy alcohol, and in your face malt and hops, give me complexity and flavor in a light refreshing tipple and I will be a happy man. I am a bit afraid that these are not going to last long, they are already incredibly carbonated, much more of it and the bottles are going to start exploding (though I did serve this on the warm side, about 58°F). I will definitely cold store these from here on out, hopefully I can eke out a couple months more of age."
"Overall, this is a very good session Belgian style ale. I recommend it."
"Drinkability- Yet another well done brew by Mr. C at Russian River. This would be a great summer brew."
"..WTF!? youre kidding right Vinnie!? Seems like a No-Brainer to me!!!"
"Drinkability: slight funkiness in finish has me coming back for more. A lot like Damnation, which was another fine brew."
"Pours a pale, hazy yellow body, with a foamy white head, good retention. Aroma of banana, spice and yeast. Taste was very light, refreshing and full of malt sweetness and some fruitiness. Pretty one dimensional though. I much prefer the Damnation over this beer. Finish is dry and clean. Good drinkability."
"Drinkability  This is a great combination of fluffy carbonation and exceptional Belgian flavors."
"Tap@Russian river Brewpub. Tastes half American influenced and half Belgian. Belgian yeasty lemon and apple, with some piney hops, not too bad, but doesn't quite work in my opinion, still its a very drinkale beer, nothing offensive or anything, pleasant..."
"No surprises here, the drinkability goes up when the rest of the beer is toned down."
"The beer pours translucent amber with a generous white head that spumescent in texture and the lace a satin sheet to cover the glass. Nose has a nice malt sweetness, a hint of banana or maybe its pineapple, also seemed to be a hint of yeast, fresh and clean to the olfactory senses, start is sweetly malt and the top light to moderate in its feel. Finish is hop spicy, the acidity prickly and I found it to be a good drinking beer."
"I know I'll probably get a lot of ""why do you review Belgian beers"" I made a real effort to like them today, getting totally ripped sampling Russian River Brewings impressive line up. This was one I really could not get. This is advertised as a Belgian single. a style that the monks like to have half a bottle of at lunch and the rest at dinner. Appearance was a real bright gold, but very light looking at the same time. Head was white and lacing was good. After that it was all down hill. The aroma and taste profiles were like nothing I have ever come across, it was almost bubblegum like. I'm sure Belgian beer lovers will love Vinnies interpretations, if only for the fact that I don't."
