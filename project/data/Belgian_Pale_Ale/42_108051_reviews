"Overall - A very good beer, but I never know what to expect from a Belgian IPA (meaning it's hard to compare against others, and hard for me to judge to style).  3.75 paws."
""
""
"Good taste and feel. Pours nicely great color. Solid pale ale from a solid brewery."
"The taste is also nice and toasty, malty, yeasty, and biscuity. A hint of orange peel and a mild  bitterness to finish.  I mean this really does a nice job hitting the mark for the style but still a but less vibrant."

"O- not bad overall just more of a Belgian pale ale with tons of the Belgian yeast dominating."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is light, some floral hops. Taste is hops, citrus, some bitterness, not really what I am used to from this style. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a decent beer, but not up to the quality I am used to from this brewery."

"Medium bodied.  Grainy texture.  Harsh carbonation.  Dry feel."

"Really dissapointed with this one. Kind of tastes like underboob sweat..."
""
""
""

"Tastes good in an earthy-herbal-peppery way of resfreshment."
""

"O: Overall nicely dry hopped, good dose of american hops and belgian yeastiness, fruity with a good complexity, yet softly balanced in harmony. Lingering bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"It doesn't have quite the slap that some Belgian-style hoppy pale ales do, but the trade-off to that is that its balanced refinement leaves it just that much more drinkable: it's complex without being overtly full in flavor, and that keeps your interest as you progress through it, continually looking for more subtleties."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, copper color.  1/2 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and good lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, hint of pine, hops, hint of yeast, slight floral, and a hint of alcohol.  Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, Belgian yeast, hops, slight floral notes, hint of alcohol, and a hint of spice.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."

"Packaged on 3/10/14, 12 oz. bottle. Beer is a nice light golden color with a classic Belgian cloudiness. Head is large and white, beer is well carbonated. Aroma is bready with notable citrus and floral contributions from the hops. Mouthfeel is dry and somewhat watery. Taste is dominated by an upfront Belgian yeast character and followed by citrus hop flavored and a lingering bitterness. As a pale ale I would say this misses the mark, in the context of a Belgian inspired, dry-hopped ale, this is a good example."

"Pours into a small tulip glass a hazed apricot-like color with a big blooming white head that sticks like glue to the glass as it settles ever so slowly.Some citrus and yeasty spiced notes in the nose but it's pretty light.Bright citrus notes up front on the palate with some peppery notes in the finish,quite dry.Not bad,quite tame compared to many of the style."
"O: A well-exectued hoppy Belgian pale with enticing flavours and aromas. Drying, spicy, and fruity, just like a good BPA should be."
""
"Pours a murky light orange color with a big white foam head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice, thin level head with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is a pleasant burst of fresh citrus, with grapefruit, orange and lemon zest, mango and a bit of grassiness and floral hops. You can nearly taste the citrusy goodness. The taste is similar, with some tangy lemon and orange zest and a bit of citrus hops. The yeast and wheat slowly poke their head in, revealing the interesting nature of this semi-crossover beer. The floral notes are quite noticeable, and pair nicely with the kick from the combination of zest and hops. Nothing too complex going on here. The citrus hops come through a bit more as it warms, creating a very pleasant sweet citrus aftertaste. Par for the style, high carbonation. A bit watery. Very easy to drink. Mouth wateringly refreshing. Overall all a pretty good brew from a brewery that I don't seem to be as big of a fan as everyone else. I hope this one will help me change that!"
"Overall - great Belgium pale ale, I'd have it again."
""
""
"Overall: Not sure why the rating on this one is only 3.75, as this is a really solid dry hopped pale ale. I would get this again and would recommend it."

"Good hoppiness with strong Belgian yeast finish.  I tend towards IPAS and really enjoyed this beer at first.  Halfway through the bottle and the hops went away.  Style is great but not my preference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fairly enjoyable drink, but likely wont look for this one first on the racks of Ommegang."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden yellow with a large long lasting white fluffy head, some lacing seen. Pine citrus hops and fruity notes fill the senses with some spiced fruity flavor, yeast and pale malt. Palate is a medium body, moderate carbonation, crisp. The ending is sweet spiced fruity notes, yeast, pale malt with some good dry hopped citrus pine hops. This is a nice session style, good drinking and refreshing brew."

"I do not enjoy the sourness.  The zest character I think is what I dislike.  If I am in the mood for a Belgian Pale Ale, I go with St. Bernardus."
""
"Bubbly, darker shade of gold topped with marshmallow head that floats around. Aroma of sharp tropics, citrus rind, zest, and grass. Tastes of pine, grass, lemon skin, sour pineapple, wildness, and a faint flavor of sea salt towards the finish. Finishes surprisingly clean. Medium bodied with high carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy bright golden body with a white foamy head with good retention.  Aromas are Belgian yeasty, a hint of bubblegum and tropical fruit, but largely subdued and uninteresting.  Taste is surprisingly sour (I expected sweet, based on the nose) and yeasty, with hints of unripened pear and apples.  Very dry.  Overall not bad, especially if dry Belgians are your thing."
"Overall, the first sips were just stale hops and earthy notes, but as I finished the bottle more sweet fruity notes came out that were nice."

"Overall, we’ve been trying to get this one under out belt’s for over a year now. Having lived an hour from Ommegang for quite some time, we always actively seek out every one of their new releases. This beer reminded us of just how incredible they are as premier brewers. The base beer is full, warming, and hearty, but what makes it fantastic is the thick layer of oily, organic hoppiness that they float overtop of it. The interplay between the decidedly Belgian malt bill and yeasty zest with the fresh floral and bitterly soapy hoppiness is both highly enjoyable and thoroughly refreshing. This was the best beer of a long night of tasting, and something we hope they will continue to stock. This is Ommegang’s most memorable in recent memory, and should encourage them to keep their hop game evolving."

"Beer pours a light orange copper color. Clear but you can see little ""floaties"" in the beer. Finger of head. Looks like a Belgian Pale Ale in the glass. Smells of strong citrus and grapefruit peel. Definitely smells dry-hopped and lives up to the ""Hop House"" name. The taste is a solid Belgian pale, with a nice yeasty spice and a strong hop character. Tropical and citrus notes. The beer is very crisp and refreshing. Really great brew and a bit different from the rest of Ommegang's lineup. Definitely has the core of a Belgian ale with the American hoppyness and I really like it. It is exactly what it claims to be and I have to give props for that. I would classify this more as an IPA than pale ale however."

"I hate to do this because Ommegang is fairly local to me and I am a big fan of many of their beers...but this isn't one of those. Just plain boring, bitterness not balanced well and the high hop content doesn't really mesh well with the other flavors in the beer. I honestly took two sips and poured it out. When Ommegang focused on a few solid beers, they were untouchable, but now they are trying to be all things to all people and I think their products are suffering. I'm sure they don't want to brew Hennepin or Rare Vos all day every day, but the difference with those beers and this one is they are delicious"
""
""
""

"A pleasant pale ale, somewhat atypical because of the dryness. The aroma, appearance, and palate are all good, but the monoflavor becomes rapidly boring."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy dirty yellow/beige color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of dry floral hoppy notes with light rustic malt notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by dry floral hoppy notes with some rustic malt and some bitter notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. I actually quite enjoyed the mix between the Belgian ale notes and the hoppy notes."
"I need to try this from a bottle as I can't imagine Ommegang would put out a beer this bad and lacking any true flavor."
""

"O- This offering by Ommegang stands out as one of their best IMO. It nails that Belgian richness of flavor and aroma while being accentuated by the increase in hops. Great stuff."
"If it were a tad higher in alcohol, the beer would easily meet the criteria for Belgian IPA; it probably does already. But with its slight strength, the beer delivers high complexity but in effortless sessionability."
""
"Another really nice, well-balanced beer from Ommegang. This is a pretty ""Belgian"" beer and is most certainly worth your time. Hop heads and Euro-dorks alike. Pretty dusty straw color with good head. Dry and hoppy this is a creamy easy drinker with a dry finish. On the whole there is a very herbal hop flavor but the main characteristic this beer has is ""even-keeledness""."

"Another spectacular looking beer from Ommegang. Giant chunky pile of white foam atop a lovely light orange colored beer. A big bubbly layer remains once the bulk of the head subsides. Sticky patches all around the glass.... Aroma is loaded with juicy grapefruit, lemon-lime, floral, banana pudding, and a soft dusting of coriander spice. Mouthwateringly forward fruit. Taste is very Belgian IPA. Sweet white bread grains, lemon, grapefruit rind, touch of passionfruit, creamy banana, zesty spice, and hop bitterness mingled with festive carbonation. Dry, brisk, very lightly resinous, and still creamy smooth. Overall a very nice Ommegang Belgian spliced with an IPA. Fruity, perky, warm, and welcoming with a nice amount of (far from overwhelming) bitterness. Good stuff."
""
""
"Slightly hazy solid gold color with the standard huge, lumpy Ommegang head that billows up over the rim. Aroma is a blend of hops and yeast for the most part...fruity grapefruit, lime, and peach, herbs, grass, and flowers over a pastry-like sweetness. Crisp, dry hoppy Belgian flavor. Lemon, herbs, peppery yeast, floral hops, citrus rind, light cracker-like grain. Dry, refreshing, and easy to drink. Tasty! Should probably be in the Belgian IPA category if we're going to recognize that as a style."

"Easy to drink, but was hoping for more in-your-face hoppyness, not sure how old this is. No discernible dating code on the bottle I can see"

"I have seen this many times but never gotten despite normally being a fan of Ommegang. Finally picked one up as part of a mixed 6 from Ye Old. Excellent looking beer, cloudy with a great head that stuck around and grabbed the glass. Smell was outstanding but no overly strong. Mixed feelings about the taste. Did not have the bang of an IPA but smooth and drinkable without the overwhelming bitter aftertaste that can turn me off. Overall I enjoyed the beer very much, but not enough to buy regularly unless I could find it at a good cost."

"Overall this is a nice Belgian pale. You can tell this is a clone if true Belgian ale, it has a distinguished taste and follow through."

"Taste-White grapefruit and pear, herbal hops. Well-balanced and almost Saison-like. Very nice food beer."
"Overall: I like this beer a great deal. Someday I'll have to try it side-by-side with Fleur de Houblon, which I loved."
"Overall - Underwhelmed by this one. Very basic Belgium pale ale, no special flavors or twist on the style. Flavor is bland and this isn't even a good take on the style. Nothing special here or anything I want to try again."
""
""
""
""
"A decent nose on this ale, prevailing with citrus, hops and a hint of the Belgian derived esters. The palate comes across as dry, but smooths out with an initial hop bitterness, and clean, crisp flavors and effervescent mouth-feel. Hints of pine, subtle resin and mint, finishing with citrus, are present in the lingering after-palate. A pleasant drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out an apricot body with a bit of haze. Head starts off huge, but dies down. Strong, earthy, grassy hops in the nose with light yeast esters and grain body. I get a whiff of brett, possibly. Flavor has some bready maltiness and toasty grains up front. The hops come in full force with long-lasting bitterness. Hops bring some herbal and grassy flavors. Overall more bitter than aromatic. Body is moderate, with lively carbonation. I would kind of like this to be lighter on the tongue. Solid beer, but doesn't hold a candle to some of the great hoppy Belgians."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Kind of an odd one here. Definitely Belgian in character, but the hops are kicking in on this. Seems quite earthy overall with that almost clay tone I pick up off some of these hopped Belgian ales. Could really stand some smoothing out. But it's a nice enough drinker. Always fine with trying something from Ommegang."
"I couldn't taste the alcohol here either and I only felt it once I finished off this bottle. If it were possible to create a new style of beer that combined the taste of a BPA with the strength and more aggressive hops of an American counterpart, this would be a good start. Not strong, overly bitter, or potent, this beer would please both Ommegang fans and hopheads alike. This new direction on a standard was worth the effort."
"O - Bitterness seems out of place with hop flavors lacking a bit."
""

"Beautiful hazed orange apricot appearance glowing in my glass clouded off white head forming thick looks like a dimpled biscuit sitting afloat on the body of this beer. Belgian style lacing all day, looks great and a name like Hop House from Ommegang I was sold off the bat. Aroma has citric earthy herbal hops, bitterness is almost caught by your nares...expressive bready/biscuit malts to complement not much in the way of perceived sweetness seems like a beautifully constructed Belgian pale ale. Just a touch of citrus/mango juicy hop character going on here. Flavors combine nicely herbaceous herbal hops, bitter citrus peel, lemony notes with a spicy black pepper blast the yeast spiciness kicks hard I don't know how to keep the yeast out of this glass it seems like part of the dry-hopped BPA experience. Mouthfeel has smooth effervescent carbonation light to medium bodied a touch of slick hop oils all very enjoyable along with that bone dry finish. Overall I can't get enough of a well crafted easy drinking complex ale with moderate alcohol, and high flavor this will get better and better as it warms up outside."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid flavorful beer to drink for along time."
""
"Unmistakeable Belgian character from the yeast blended with a higher hop load than a typical Belgian IPA but lower than an American IPA. Mildly bitter. Some coffee sneaks in the in the lingering aftertaste."
""
"an excellent example of a belgian pale, but i hope the rumors arent true that this is replacing bpa. this is less distinct to me, not as yeasty and farmy, more in line with convention, although i love the grassy and bitter complex of the hops here. more body too i think than bpa, although the two beers are cut from the same cloth. a bit more of a copper color as well, equally pronounced white head with ring lacing. more grassy than floral, but summery in nature on the nose, some wheat malt may be in here as well. im missing yeasty haze, and although this beer is dry and has a very recognizable belgian yeast character to the finish, it simply doesnt stand out the way fresh bpa always has for me. i know the two beers are minimally different, but i prefer the original."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I'm very impressed with this beer. Very well done and if there was a such thing as an American Belgian India Pale Ale, I suspect this would be the benchmark for the style. It definitely has aspects of a Belgian Pale, but the full hop flavor is all AIPA. Dangerously drinkable - wish I had bought a six pack."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If I were in an IPA mood or an abbey ale mood, I wouldn't go for hop-house. However, as a middle-of-the-road, every-day beer, it's a tasty and unique choice. Nothing earth-shaking, but more enjoyable than your average fare. I'll likely buy again."

"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy-golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of apricots, bready malt, yeast and spices. Body is full, creamy and tangy. Citrusy hops come through on the palate, while pale malt, ripe fruit, yeast provide some balance. Finish is long and dry. It’s not my favorite from Ommegang."
""
""

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 1/20/2014. Pours fairly cloudy bright golden amber color with a 3 finger dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon zest, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, pear, light banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, light bubblegum, cracker, bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, yeast ester, and moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, pear, light banana, clove, pepper, light bubblegum, floral, grass, bread, cracker, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spice and floral hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, pear, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of hop, yeast ester, and moderate malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian IPA. All around good balance and complexity of hop, yeast ester, and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The yeasty spice and hoppy bitterness clashes a bit slightly reducing the overall drinkability in my opinion but overall it is not bad. Thanks Matt for sharing this with me."
""
""
""
"Overall great, this is exactly what I want in a Belgian Pale, nice floral grassy citrusy hops that aren't overpowering and just destroy the beer, a great Belgian yeast addition with esters, fruit skin, crackery notes, floral, etc, and a nice mild base malt to blend it all together, with a great effervescence. I think people completely miss the point of a Belgian Pale and expect it to be an American pale, like Flying Dog Raging Bitch which is just an American IPA as there is no Belgian note at all in it. I continue to love what Ommegang is doing and glad I can get regular access to most of their beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, spice, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, chalk, and Belgian yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a better combination of yeast and hop qualities in the aroma."
""
""
""
"I liked this but it doesn't seem as good as the ""Fleur de Houblon"" hoppy BPA that Ommegang released as a seasonal previously."
""
""
"Cloudy body was amber colored, with large head forming, at over 3 fingers thick. The smell was hoppier than any other Ommegang beer I recall having, but not quite hopped up enough to be in IPA territory. There was a distinct yeast presence evident in the smell, and it was cleared in the taste in the form of banana, and white pepper. The hops were there in the taste, but more like a spice, than a dominating element. The body was however a lot thinner than I would have liked, as the hop flavors seemed fleeting due to it. What lingered in the aftertaste was candi sugar, and more of the yeast. Drawing properly from the Belgian tradition and American adventurousness, although it's a lot closer to the Belgian roots than others that have ventured this way."
""
"This is a clear, golden brew. The tall white head is brilliant. The smell is hoppy and clean. There is a bit of a Belgian yeast scent, but not a lot of fruit scents. The taste is drying, with a pleasant hop bitterness. Clean and fairly quick finish. Refreshing and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was glad I tried this, but probably would not recommend this unless it is something you need to try - it is okay, but has some things I would change to make it more drinkable"
""
""
""
"O: It's a good enough beer, but I'd like some more hop character. This comes out with bitterness a swinging, but not lot of flavor from the hops, and I don't know if the base beer is solid enough by itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Sort of a Belgian IPA, but more like a hoppy Saison. I have had a couple of attempts at hoppy Saisons before, and, while tasty, they were a little muddled and confused. This is not; this is superb and underrated on this site IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this brew has traits of both a BIPA and a saison"
""
""
"A good beer either way you look at it."
""
"Man, I absolutely love Ommegang's beers. They truly believe in making a world-class Belgian here in the U.S. and it shows. If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll notice that I'm not a fan of hop-based brews. This, unfortunately is a brew designed to accommodate the hop-heads in America. I bought one solely on the fact that Ommegang made it. While I believe that Ommegang can do no wrong, I will quietly disregard this beer as an attempt to satisfy the misguided American palate which seems to believe that beer begins and ends with the advent of the IPA."

"Poured to a Sam Adams glass with a nice full and thick head developing, tan, with good retention and lacing. Appearance was a hazy with a golden color. Aroma had strong notes of citrus, yeast and some floral accents. Tasted floral and grassy with some hop notes. Medium, bubbly mouth feel with a slight bitter aftertaste, almost metallic."
""
""
""
"This Belgian pale ale shows a nice clear amber gold with a muscular snow white head and lots of puffy lacing. The aroma brings a clean grassy wheat hop that is very refreshing and hits a definitive floral quality as well. Delicate but sure. The flavor follows suit with a crisp grass but a gentle floral sweetness to balance this into something much more commendable than the previous reviews generally recognize. It's pretty simple but I love it. Born to be served cold and probably best enjoyed in the heat of the summer months this brew captures some bready grain with tasteful hops that will clearly satisfy the hop cravings of most hop heads like me. The body is pretty much light but it delivers a high carbonation that makes for a very refreshing, crisp feel. I really like this concoction and hope it will be available during the summer months ahead."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a pretty good example of a hoppy Belgian style Pale Ale, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style when It came to the aroma, but when I got to the taste I found it to not be as bright and vibrant as the aroma was. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little refreshing, not too filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these but I might want to switch it up after that and I think it would make for a nice beer to enjoy in the spring time. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very nice and i liked how fruity and vibrant it was. What I liked the least about this beer was that that the taste wasn't more like the aroma, it just seemed a little too light and dull after that really nice aroma. I might buy a couple more bottles of this, but i'm not in any hurry and I would recommend it to anyone who likes hoppy Belgian Style Pale Ales. All in all I liked this beer, but I don't think it had that special something to set it apart and make it really memorable. I like the idea of a hoppy Belgian Pale Ale and I think that the citrus hops can work really nice with the Belgian Yeast. This isn't my favorite Ommegang beer and It's not my favorite Belgian Pale Ale. Nice work guys, this beer was pretty solid, keep it up."

"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a two finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of citrus hops, mixed citrus juice and tropical fruit, bready malt and hints of Belgian spicing. Flavor is biscuit malt, citrus hops, light stone and tropical fruit, light Belgian yeast and spicing. Medium bodied. An interesting Belgian / American hybrid, with the hoppy pale ale taking the forefront, but with nice Belgian yeast character in the background. An interesting converse of a Belgian IPA with the Belgian character at the fore. There is an interesting earthy, peppery flavor in the finish that is probably clove interacting with the hops. A very nicely made pale ale with interesting flavors from both inspiring styles. I enjoyed this a lot."

"O: A little more bold, bitter, and rough than Fleur de houblon, and a little bigger all around too. The label offers a smattering of pairing suggestions, including pizza and burgers. I disagree. This is not a pizza or burger beer. At least not under normal circumstances. Some sort of creative 'artisan' pizza or burger maybe. I can see it meshing well with an arugula laden salad."
"I have to rate this beer based on my preferences. While others may like this one, I found it to be horrendous. I couldn't even choke it down. The aroma was actually pretty good, but when I got the first sip onto my palate, it was defintely not for me. I actually picked up an overwhelming taste of cloves and I cannot stand cloves. It was such an overpowering taste that I had to give it away. If you are not a fan of cloves stay away. If you are a fan of cloves you might really enjoy this beer."

"Clear with heavy lacing. Great hops. Citrus peel. Bitter. The taste is engaging and interesting. Citrus heavy, with good carbonation and a Belgian-y finish. Belgian yeast is floral, spicy, and vaguely sweet. Finish is clean and lightly grainy. Very strong effort. Will have again. Highly recommended."

"Pours clear. yellowish golden with a nice white head. Aroma offers some cloves from the spicy belgian yeast, some citrus and its rind, and some cracker from what I figure comes from a decent dose of pilsner malt. Flavor pretty much follows suit but the general citrus is a more distinct lemon and orange I found. A crisp, light active mouthfeel. Overall, nothing innovative or unique about this beer. Just a very nice, well constructed, highly drinkable Belgian ipa. Would definitely drink again, I dug it."

"A very good Belgian IPA. Good balance between the hops and yeasty phenols. It could be a touch lighter in the malt."
"O: A great"
"Overall (4.25): I mean, generally speaking this is really my kind of beer. I love Belgian Pale Ales, I love Ommegang, and I love deft dry-hopping. It’s exceedingly easy to drink, with an excellent aroma, appearance, feel, and very good flavor, but it feels like they dialed back the spice and yeast character of BPA and emphasized the hop notes, swapping noble hops for more American-ish ones. Either way, I really do dig this beer. Now I just want to try it super-super-fresh, and/or with an alternate dry-hop regimen."
"Reminds me of a homebrew I once made and some of the hoppier Stillwater offerings. The yeast seems in the French Saison range but not quite as spicy in a way."
"Nice with a cheese plate with figs. Wouldn't be bad either with NY style pizza or a good burger."

"Well worth a try if ya like Belgians and ya like a well hopped pale ale with a nice citric and yeasty snap to it. I'll get a sixer (or a four pack - boo) next time..."

"Overall as Ommegang says this is a Belgian American love child. Does have a nice bittering flavor that sets it apart from other belgian pale ales on the market."

"This pours a handsome bright yellow with an amber depth. Hazy and has plenty of yeast floating around in it that settle to the sides of the glass. A luscious thick head of white foam that is slow to fall and leaves fantastic lace. Nose is bright and fruity. Tropical pineapple, orange and lemon. Citrus peel and a nice little bit of honey to sweeten all that a little more. As it warms a some spice notes come out on the nose. Taste is dry and delicate with a traditional belgian bearing. It has that farmhouse dryness but no astringency. The fruits are not as well defined on the palate and fall back to an overall fruity and floral character with a good spice that develops later in the drink. It finishes dry and palate cleansing with a nice long after taste and a surprising bitter. The bitter on this while it won't knock you down is surprisingly strong. This is a classic belgian style pale ale and the dry hopping has given it a keen lightness. Bit of pepper in the finish too. Very good."
"I'd recommend for anyone who likes the occasional IPA for the hoppy taste but isn't a religious IPA drinker."
