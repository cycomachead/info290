"Brew pours a golden-honey in color with a small white foamy head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that slides back down the glass. The aroma is of Belgian yeast along with some light fruit, maybe pears. The taste pretty much follows the nose with some light foral hops in the mix also. Very smooth and goes down easy. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Lighter bodied with medium carbonation. Overall a tasty brew."

"one of the first beers that got me to really enjoy beer. I moved on to other beer but I will always think fondly of this beer even though I've realized it's a little too watery for my current tastes."

"Ok for what it is. Certainly a watery forgettable beer. Nice to find at a value, which I did as part of a 'Sumner Variety' pack for near $1 a beer. Has an ok spice presence. Probably a nice 'gateway' beer for beginners~"

"OVERALL: this is a good beer, solid beer but nothing too special. There are probably better Belgian ales, but this is a solid beer to at least try once."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is a good beer but nothing to write home about, it has a lower alcohol content for the style, which is appealing to me but, there are better Belgian ales so I would probably not seek this one out again."

"Belgian Session Brewed by Boston Beer Company with an ABV of 4.3% This brew pours of a dark amber color with a nice white head. Samuel Adams Belgian Session is a filtered brew you can see right thought it. The smell is rich with grains and some bitterness. So far this brew is doing well. Now for the taste; it is smooth real smooth and light. It is crisp, but you do pick up on some spices in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice an refreshing and clean. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Samuel Adams did a nice job with this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew 4.5 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

"O: Really nice, perfect for a hot summer day."

"Single bottle from a mixed pack poured into a tulip glass. A dark golden honey color with around a half-inch of firm white bubbly head. Rather effervescent brew with a nice look. Aroma is unassuming, however ... Faintly malty, with a little brown sugar but nothing overly robust, along with some apple and a pleasant but again subtle hop spice, floral and citrus notes discernible here and there. Flavor is somewhat more robust but still low key, some nice brown spice (cinnamon and nutmeg) notes flitting in and out, breakfast cereal malts, and tangy faintly floral and fruity hops. Very downplayed Belgian yeast character although the latter is certainly present. Does develop more of a honeyed sweetness as it warms. I get the notion here and this is indeed a solid sipper to session out on the deck all afternoon. No real off-flavors. Personally, I am not afraid of more aggressive Belgian flavors and would choose a Belgian pale right from the source before seeking out this again."

"O: Probably a wonderful beer to drink on a hot day. I'd almost go as far as to characterize this as a really good light beer, but I don't think that's what Boston Beer was going for here. It's a really meager beer but it has no unfavorable flavors or notes so it's hard to call it a bad beer, it just doesn't have enough flavor to make it a good beer. I'd like to try it on draft with a hearty meal after a hard day's work... that's what this beer is made for."

"Belgian Session is a very good beer. form the first pour it has a strong golden color and aroma that is inviting for the first sip. That first sip is not going to disappoint. a crisp flavor that makes this a thoroughly enjoyable summer brew. I used a pint glass and it hung to the sides nicely. I would recommend this beer for any summer event and to go with a good old southern BAR BQ."

"Sam Adams really didn't put any effort into this beer. Not worth getting again."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a pint glass."
""
""
""
"Very clean and crisp with a hint of some cloves I think.There is a ton of carbonation and a little bit of a citrus hop bite. A slight bit of fruit notes are in there not sure which ones. Finishes off with a caramel malt smoothness. Perfect summer Sunday afternoon on the patio beer. Would definitely try this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I get the conceit here, which takes (or precedes, I dunno) the idea of 'sessionability' from the IPA world, and applies it to the typically boozy Belgian strain of pale ales. Agreeable enough, for the most part, but kind of plain, and somewhat boring once upon bottoms up. Meh, maybe it's time to admit that, for me, by far the best part of most Belgian-style ales is indeed their alcohol quotient."

"Sam Adams Belgian Session - another great beer from the micro brewer that started it all. Across the board the beer is simply outstanding. A great mix on the odor of the beer with that burnt toffee smell to go with the hops and malts. The taste matched the smell (a big plus for me) and was smooth and crisp going down. The only knit was the appearance - although it coloring is appealing, the head has little to no staying power. Otherwise, really a great beer."

"Came out of left field. When I got the summer variety pack, (which is the only way I could find this beer) I wasn't too excited by this beer at first glance, but it turned out to be my favorite beer in the pack. Light yellow color with nice head. The smell was bananas and citrus peel . The taste had great Belgian wheat flavors and a nice clean finish. I thought this was a great beer and would love to see it on it's own one day."

"This is not my favorite style but I am trying to branch out more. I actually expected a different yeast profile that is typical in Belgian style beers. This is more like Belgian for people who really don't like Belgian."
""
"This pours a clear, golden amber color with a thick foamy head. The aroma is yeasty with banana and lemon. The texture is fairly decent which is more than I can say about the taste. This is surprisingly bland and simple. This is basically an extremely thin and young version of a yeasty Belgian ale. One of the few Sam Adams beer that I can honestly say could use some work."

"My 100th beer review!!! Love this beer lots of taste to this beer Not the best but the toffee sets the tone for this beer. I love it in the variety packs want to find it outside the v paks as i do with a lot of sam adams beers i havent seen in six packs but i guess that is normal since Boston Lager was my first delve in the craft world"
""
""
"O - This was too much of one note - pretty meh and bland. I will not have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a yellow color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of sweet Belgian style malt with some zesty and dry hops notes. Taste is also dominated by lightly sweet Belgian-style malt with some dry and zesty hops notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Easy drinking Belgian ale with a little hops twist."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent beer from Sam Adams. The fruity belgian notes are interesting, but the mouthfeel just doesn't do it for me. It is a session beer, so I do give them credit for that."

"Overall this is a decent little beer. It is brewed very well and serves as a perfect beer after coming in from a 100 degree afternoon in Phoenix. I recommend this if you are looking for a decently flavored session beer."
""
""
"O: Not bad. Good mix of flavors as it goes down. A good entry to the Belgian style without being to overpowering with the sweetness or alcohol content. As the name says, it is a good session beer and nice representation of a Belgian beer."
"This is my favorite from the mix pack. Not a bad shot at a Belgian pale ale, could use a bit more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Light tastes, light alcohol. But that was to be expected."
"T - Apple, bready malt, banana, lemon citrus. Even a hint of honey. Not bad as a sessionable Belgian beer. I've had better, but Sam Adams makes so many beers, but this wasn't a miss. It's not great, but it wasn't a total disappointment. I read that some thought it was watered, but I didn't get that effect from it. This was one of the best in the summer variety pack."
""
""
""
""
"This would be good to get the foot in the door for turning someone on to craft beer. Super refreshing with a lot of the great notes that Belgians are known for, but not as in your face. Good summer beer. Not sure that it can compete with many other Belgian pales, but I'm not sure that it's really supposed to... I'd drink it again."
""
""
"O - Not bad as a sessionable Belgian beer. The flavors are light but the beer is extremely drinkable. It's just a bit too watered down, which diminishes the tasty Belgian aspects of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is just strange and awkward. It never really seems to come together. The lack of assertive malt and hop flavors allows the spicy yeast notes to become overpowering. As a result, it was hard for me to determine whether I was supposed to treat this beer as a Belgian pale ale or as a saison. The fact that the carbonation is so over-the-top also prevents this beer from being sessionable. Instead of being like drinking water, it's like consuming a meal in a bottle. All in all, the brewers at Samuel Adams just didn't pull it off with this one; in fact, they never really even came close. I mean, what is the point of brewing a session beer of which many people may find difficult to get through a single serving?"
""
"O - Not bad for a Belgian--pretty typical. Belgian ales just aren't really my thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad brew. I probably would overlook in a six pack to get a better Belgian, but I won't turn it down in the mix 12 pack. I bought the twelve pack warm, and I might not have given this enough time to truly chill (I got impatient!)"
""
"D- disappointed in the summer sampler. Boston lager saved the day even though the blueberry hill was a surprising underdog that came strong for the win. Porch rocker? Nix that shit. Send it to wherever Great Lakes sent grassroots ale... This one isn't horrible so I won't be sending jim Koch any mean emails... This year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Drinkable but pretty plain. It's not that far off from a basic lager taste wise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, straw-yellow coloring with a tall, frothy, clingy, white head. Lots of carbonation action throughout the body. Aromas of bread and butter initially, with floral highlights, some honey sweetness, and a blend of coriander, clove, and all spice. Flavors of caramel in the backbone, with a roasted grain overlay, some light spicings, and a touch of hops at the end. Decent cling along the glass, and the body is light and bubbly. Spiced and tangy sweet aftertaste, with a frothy, slightly lingering finish."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark golden slight amber, but clear and pale. Head leaves a slight ring all the way down with just a slight lace. Theres not much more then just a generic beer smell with a slight yeast spice. A little bubble gum, yeast and that's about all. Bitterness comes in really no where with maybe some citrus but not bitterness from the hops. Its pretty smooth a little watery but it is a session beer I guess. I think it's decent and would be great to give somone with not much beer experience. But it doesn't come close to tasteing what a Belgian beer should taste like to me so it gets a ok rateing."
""
""
""
"Cold 12oz bottle, best before December, served in pint glass. Beer is a very pale amber, almost yellow, color, with a medium white head. Crystal clear with only a few bubbles disturbing its clarity. Aroma is pleasant and reminiscent of an authentic Belgian blonde ale: sweet candi sugar, floral yeast notes. Flavor-wise the first thing I notice is that it's a little bit spicy -- but only a very little bit. The whole thing is very mild. And the carbonation is fine and low, yielding an almost creamy mouthfeel, which works pretty well with the mild flavors. Secondary flavors are earthy and bitter, with a final hint of something fruity. Is Belgian ""Session"" the lowest ABV Belgian ale in the books? (no, not quite) Is it sessionable? Quite possibly. Doesn't seem interesting enough to bother finding out based on this one. It's ok, but these flavors really are best played at high volume."
""
""
""
""
""
"O=Not bad, a gateway to other Belgian ales, perhaps. I think they could use a name upgrade."
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer. I think it’s a good offering from Samuel Adams, especially for summer, and I hope it becomes a permanent summer offering."
""
""
""
"O - I understand what they're trying to do, but it doesn't work. It's watered down to make it sessionable, but there's just not enough character left. I'd rather session an American pale ale. Kudos for trying though."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Nothing substantial to report. The beer went south the more it sat in the glass. Had to drink it quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes a little yeasty, but It is missing something. Taste stays in your mouth a bit after drinking, but it doesn't make a memorable impression."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a serviceable Bekgian style ale. Sessionable and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
"Samuel Adams describes this as a session beer, and it is easy to see why. It is milder than most other Belgian- style beers and its taste is easier- going than what you anticipate. The mildness might be too much for some, but I can agree that this beer makes a good choice when you want a little Belgian brew but want something a little tamer than the norm."
""
"O - this was a fairly decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad thing to have laying around for the summer time, I can easily drink the 2 bottles that came in the variety pack, albeit at different times. Wouldn't want to session these back to back for 24oz."
""
""
""
""
"I'd drink this beer again if given the opportunity, I found it very enjoyable. I often find it hard to find much fault in a session, and this is no different. The taste is what really sells me; very nice and easy to drink! Take this to a Summer BBQ, you'll score some points with the ladies!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its aroma. Compared to the flavoring this aspect was a bit more robust in the end, giving brighter components and more authentic Belgian blend. Actually, this is one of the most floral beers we’ve ever smelled. We lost points through the taste, however, with things becoming overly watered and washed out by the end of the sip. The spice and fruity yeastiness was there in the start, but faded before our eyes. This is an interesting offering from Sam Adams, and certainly an attempt to keep up with the surge of new styles, but this one just seems a bit rushed and incomplete."
""
""
""
""
"This is exactly what it aims to be. A very easy to drink sessionable belgian pale. And it does an excellent job. it's clean, crisp and refreshing and has enough flavor to remain interesting. Very well balanced. I would buy it again and would recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Meh, it's alright, did not cater to my expectations for a belgian style beer, was expecting a lot more yeast, but yeah not that great. Not horrendous enough for me to never drink it again but not good enough for me to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Summary - I had my doubts about this when I saw the ""Belgian"" on the label of a Sam Adams product. I like a bunch of their stuff, but a Belgian is difficult to do correctly, it seems. You can, and should, do much better by getting something else. I suppose you could get it as an entry-level idea of the Belgian style, but I wouldn't buy it on purpose."
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and peppery aromas. Taste is much the same with spicy grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some spicy aromas and flavors that I wasn't expecting."
""
""
"O: Not impressed. Sam can do better (and often does)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's easy to get sh*tfaced drinking Belgians. This; however, provides a Belgian flavor profile with a lighter ABV; hence the ""session"" label. A bit hoppy for my taste. Overall mediocrity."
""
""
"Overall this is my second one in the variety summer case and it taste like what they were trying to accomplish a full flavored Belgium pale ale with a session able ABV. May buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - This is a quick review because it's a quick beer. Solid when it's warm out and you're in the mood for an easy drinking belgian. It's certainly not better than the bigger belgian brewery's better offerings, but it's perfectly acceptable."
""
""
""
"Not a bad brew. Nothing special, though. Easy enough to drink with a light ""Belgian"" character."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very refreshing and drinkable belgian for the summer! Well done BBC."

"Samuel Adams Belgian Session ---3/5"
""
""
""
"Bright citrus at first --> then toffee caramel-->then spicy Belgian yeast to finish. The flavors progress across the palate so beautifully I could write it like a Phish setlist. I did. Unfortunately that lovely flavor train breaks down into a dull, monotone heap. A bit mineral/steely like most SA ales."
""
""
"Wish that aroma translated more to the flavor profile. Carbonation is too high for my liking and really shortens the flavor enjoyment."
""
""
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. The beer pours clear copper with a finger and a half of white head. There are lots of visible tiny bubbles rising in this beer. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There's a lot of banana on the nose as well as some lemon. I also pick up a hint of spice. I get some of the malt in the nose as well. Those fruity notes in the nose are present, bringing plenty of banana and lemon the party along with the solid malt backbone. The clove spice is there as well. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the beer is refreshing to drink. This is a good beer."
""
""
"Aroma offers some pleasant yeast notes along with some floral and lemony hops. Not much malt depth but then not expected given the ABV. Bit hard to garner overall. Taste follows with a light malt character and a flowery spicy finish. Touch of harsh grainy bitterness at times. Feel is adequate for the beer, light and easy with enough body and carbonation to match the delivery. Not watery in nature but not far from it either. Drinkable yet simple, well done for what it aims to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing, not bad for what it is, I prefer my BPAs a bit more hoppy & stronger, but could do a few of these any time of the year"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good brew to sip on, it mellows as it warms while still tasty."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours golden with short lived, thin, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of citrusy hops, ripe fruit and funky yeast. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is of spicy hops, funky yeast and fruit. Finish is long and earthy. I would not buy this brew by itself."
""
""
""
"Served in growler, clear golden in color with a nice white head and good lacing. Strong clove aroma which tends to be a trademark of Sam Adams, taste is alot like smell, a lot of cloves and a hint of grass and almost no hops. Not very complex, I don't really like the flavor. Not much there on the mouthfeel. This is my first Sam Adams Belgian Session and I am sort of disappointed. Maybe these summer ales are not supposed to be strong. I probably would not buy this again."
""
"A thick head to start the quickly turned into a small thin head. It does bubble up after sipping and the head dose stay but its a thin head. It dose have a citrus taste of oranges maybe lemons as well overall it wasn't that impressive. Not there best one but it is worth trying"
"O - Wow, this is a muddled mess. Not horrible, but lacking severely in so many areas. And it certainly does not taste ""Belgian"". SA is off the mark on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but a long ways from a true Belgian. It will remind you of a Belgian, but falls short in complexity. The best Belgians have layers of flavor, this one is more one note and a bit thin for the style. It is a nice beer for a warm day, but not something I'd by a 6 pack of either."
"I served it in a tulip glass and was thinking I enjoyed using my new glass more than I enjoyed drinking this beer. It definitely doesn't stand out on it's own even if I am not trying to compare it to other beers in the style."
""
"Another initial review harkening back to a previously-tasted brew, this time one that brought some decent joy in the midst of a Lucky Monk burger on the patio. It pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises ripe banana flesh, light clove, light cinnamon, flowers, and some mildly-bready toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, but it's all o'erpowered by a general fruitiness led by oranges and mild lemons. Part of me wishes the flavors echoed the smell, but it still works, so I'm not gonna spend too much time fretting. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish that borders on crispness. Overall, an enjoyable little taste of relatively-low-ABV Belgian-ness. I could easily see drinking a few of these on porches and patios in the coming warm months."
"I've had this beer countless times, and can't believe that I am Bly reviewing it now. It is a clear, straw-gold color. Its smell is spicy, with clove and bubblegum, lots of yeast and some malt scents. Sweet smelling. The taste is not as sweet. It is grass and hay-like. Drier than expected. Malt and spice dominate the flavor. The finish is light and peppery. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Modest malty taste with a light body. The real flavor is with the yeast. There is a distinctive clove spiciness just like a Hefeweizen. I didn't taste any banana until it warmed up, along with a hint of orange. Certainly well-made in the lighter style, though I got tired of the cloves. From the 12 oz bottle. Now Albertson's supermarket in San Diego has random singles to make up six packs from."
""
"The very first smell reminded me immediately of a Leffe, and this made me quite sad. However, the smell did have some citrus in it so that was nice. The taste is only ok. When it was cooler, the banana, bubblegum, wheat, and light citrus were the most pronounced. Then as it warmed, the floral aspect took over with the remaining banana and there was a slight tangy aftertaste.. Oddly enough, the taste really began to disappear as it neared room temperature. I would not get this again."
"Overall - A decent brew from Samuel Adams. IMO, a little too watery, but the flavor is respectable. Decent summer brew, but I'd grab the Firestone-Walker Solace 10 times out of 10 over this."
"O: interesting attempt by the boston brewing company. enjoyable, but not a masterful brew. pretty mild. i would drink it again, but i wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- verry sessionable and good for a hot day. Just enough flavor to keep you coming back."
""
""
"Overall- A decent, drinkable beer but not my favorite from Samuel Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a clear color color with a white head on top. The retention is decent but hardy any lacing. The smell of the beer is yeasty, there is some citrus and a touch of spice. The taste of the beer is bready with some spicy citrus. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good carbonation. Overall it a decent beer, drinkable dry, not too bad."

"O: This truly is a session Belgian. It has most of the qualities of a good Belgian but ridiculously easy to drink. Would drink again, but won't be hunting it down. If you are a Belgian fan and want a beer you can knock down, this is your beer."
"Taste-Faintly spicy orange peel, a bit watery and thin-bodied. Slight metallic note-quickly fading flavor. Not terrible for a session ale, but much better examples of the style are out there."
""
""
""
"Overall: Actually a really nice beer. Nothing flashy but it’s a good basic beer for this type of beer"
""
"O: As its name implies, this beer is very sessionable, especially given its low alcohol content."
"Admittedly more enjoyable than what I expected. The yeast lends nice fruit and spice notes while malts balance it all out with just a touch of hops. Not a blast of flavor but I think it delivers what they advertise here."

"An agressive pour yielded a white head barely a finger width and dissipated quickly. Beer was pale gold, honey color with visible carbonation and clear. Aroma had a spicey/citrusy flavor similar to a Belgian wheat. The taste had a slightly fruity flavor with a slightly spicey bite. The beer finished very clean with no real lingering flavor. Definately a session beer with the low alcohol and clean finish, but it seemed to fall short to me on flavor."

"Overall: It may not be perfect, but it's definitely easy to drink. I don’t know that I would buy a six pack of it, but I certainly won’t throw away the four that came in my mixed case."

"Hits the spot on this summer night. Doesn't go to my repeater list; that said, I am still enjoying this one."
"Darker than I expected. Amber with some gold mixed in. Fizzy head rises nicely but fades fast. Caramel and toast aroma with a hint of spice. Taste like banana toffee bread. Not bad, pretty good. Thin mouthfeel but for a summer beer that's not necessarily a bad thing. Good sessionable ale. Nothing really noteworthy but it's a good beer for the beach, pool, or cook-outs."

"O-An easy drinking summer beer however the are so many other options in the style."

"Average across the board. Poured gold tinged with caramel. Overall reserved in the Belgian yeast profile, but enough to provide a distinctive Belgian character. Funky note went a bit medicinal at the end, throwing the flavor profile out of whack. One of those ""I'll drink it because it is in the mix pack, but won't buy a six-pack"" sort of beers."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark golden color with a nice fluffy off white head that left a filmy layer. Smells of fruity esters with some caramel malt, banana and clove. The taste is big on clove and banana with some sweet bready malt. It's medium bodied with soft carbonation and a refreshing finish. This is a well done beer, very enjoyable."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Belgian Session is a golden peachy-orange color with a soapy white head. The nose is lighlty sweet with white fruits and malty grains and just a hint of hefe-spice. The taste initially is of a hefe like spicy clove/banana note that is blended with white grape, pears and lightly toasted malt balanced ever so delicately with just enough hops to make sure the sweetness is not cloying. The mouthfeel is light in body with a thick, creamy carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer of which I would expect nothing less from the BBC."

"Overall, a pretty average beer ... it lacks a little bit in flavor, but it's definitely refreshing."
"Poured from a brown12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts and fruits. Taste is the same, malts, a bit fruity, a touch of spice. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking session beer."

"O-an average belgian pale, but easily drinkable"

"The taste does not come on as strong as the aroma but it is a fascinating array of smoky malts, orange peel,and low hop bitterness. But in the end it is entirely drinkable."

"Belgian Session pours a hazy copper color, with not much head. The smell is sweet, lots of candy aromas, with strong hints of banana. The taste has nice hints of the Belgian candies, but is not overpowering, and finishes with a nice dry taste. Flavorful yet mild. Overall i found this one a bit different, but very good, I really enjoyed the dryness after each sip, and everything blended nicely, nothing was too overpowering."
""
""
"Served a bit on the warm side, but it still worked at that temperature. Nothing disagreeable. The body gave the quenching feeling of cool water, while having an appropriate thickness. A little simpler than I'd hoped. Might be more interesting colder."
""
"Overall – not a bad brew, pretty interesting to think about."
""
""
"This is probably my least favorite from the Samuel Adams label."
""
"O - This is a very light beer and I could easily drink a couple of these in one sitting. I prefer this over the Summer ale for the hot days, but if they added more spice/flavor it may bring it over an average beer."

"Overall impression: Fresh, light, and straight forward. Nothing extreme but solid for the style. Don't know why it hasn't rated better here."

"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a gold color body with a fizzy head that quickly disappears to a thin lace. The smell is swwet and spicy at the same time. The taste has a nice spice taste up front, then it has a sweet taste to it with some hops coming through on the finish. The mouth feel is nice good carbonation and overall is a average beer but a good summer drinker."
"O - I am a fan of this beer, at least if I was looking for something light and sweet. Could use a heavier flavor, deeper spice would add a lot. Certainly good for the summer months."
""
""
"Had this at a pool party. Nice belgian candy sugar sweetness upfront, some spiceness and phenols as well. Had that yeasty belgian character, yet clean tasting. Very little hop prescence. Very refreshing and light. A true session beer and perfect for a summer seasonal. Another seasonal winner from Koch."

"Sam Adams accomplished what they were going for. This is a nice light and easy drinking Belgian pale with some of the traditional BPA flavors. Worth a try."
"Glad I got to try this one as part of the summer 12 pack."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely others in the style that I would choose first."
""

"Taste is much better than I thought after the sniff test. I get more of the malt and hop flavor than much contribution from any yeast esters, but that ends up being just fine here as there is plenty to contemplate. All the while it maintains an excellent refreshing quality. The hop bitterness is low and the body light, but there is a certain richness that is quite pleasing. Even though I disagree with the first half of the name they have come up with for this beer, its one of the better Sam Adams beers I have had in a while...Id like to see this one in six-packs. Good beer, bad style classification."
"Crystal clear gold with a fleeting white head that settles down to a bubbly sheet. Sweet-ish grain, lemon, mild honey, and spicy Belgian yeast aromas. Grain, coriander, orange, pepper, and light phenolics. Pretty light and crisp. Clean and spicy with some sweet floral notes. Not too shabby really...simple and sessionable enough."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a rather tasty Belgian beer in my mind because I was never one to enjoy the over powering spice and yeast flavors that most Belgian give off. This is a very light bodied beer and very easy drinking making it a beautiful session beer just like Sam Adams wanted."
"o - Overall a decent beer, but an average Belgian pale ale. Nose is very nice but the body is a little thin and the taste is just a lot of wheat, and doesn't have as much as the nose. Not my favorite Sam Adams beer but getting 2 in a mixed 12 pack isn't bad and not a problem to finish."

"This is a decent Belgian offering from Sam Adams. It has decent flavor and good drinkability. It won't satisfy the hardcore Belgian fans, but it will introduce a few more people to a wider range of beers."
"Taste holds in line with the aroma -- sweet and spiced, with a light herbal hint. Very easy to drink and faithful to its intents as a Belgian-style, but light and easygoing. A winner, and one of my recent Sam Adams faves."

"nice addition to the summer 12er. pours hazy but bright. with all kinds of head. thick and tall, retaining. some sediment resting. smells like christmas a bit, gingersnap cookies on the malt and spice and dried fruit and caramel on the yeast. buttery and rich, but light and drinkable all in the same glass. flavor is all yeast, bit of sweetness and spice with the fruit smells long gone. feel work, thicker for a session brew in terms of body, but very lively carbonation make it down easy. its not as belgian as you want it to be, but the feel is there, just seems to be a bit weighty for a session. overall i like it in the summer box, good with food on the grill too, so that helps. not belgian quality, but american well done."
"Taste seems a bit watery at times even with all the flavors, clove tends to be a bit much although the orange and coriander helps, assertive high carbonation."
"O - Perfect for a Sam's sampler pack. This is fun to try one, enjoy it, and move on."
"O- Hard to see how this would be sessionable given the sweet, unbalanced profile. Hard to get through one let alone trying to drink several."
""
""
""
"Pours out a yellowish orange hue with a thin whitehead that has some nice lacing on the glass and some nice retention. It has an aroma of wheat, yeast, citrus and spices. The taste starts out with wheat along with yeast with a toffee and sweet caramel taste in the back and finishes off with hints of citrus. While it is easy to drink, it has a chewy taste that leaves the mouth dry and overall a pretty good tasting beer to enjoy on a nice summer day. I do hope they will in the future sell this is 6 and 12 packs and not just in the summer sampler package."
""
"Overall – This was a decent beer. Nothing remarkable, if I hadn’t taken notes I would not have remembered it, but not every beer can be outstanding. I would drink it again, I don’t know if I would buy it again though. If I am looking for a pale ale, I think I will stick with the American or Indian styles, the Belgians just don’t do it for me as much. Worth trying though."
"Notes: To think that this beer is the same style as Orval should show you how far removed from that level of greatness that this beer is."
"Overall: sessionable but the hop character is muted which makes this one more red or amber ale like than session hoppy like. Certainly very drinkable."
"Overall: A pretty nice session ale. Nice Belgian yeast flavors and the hop spices play off it well. A good light option."
""
"overall i'm a bit underwhelmed, even though i'm thirsty after a day of labor. i wouldn't make a point of revisiting this."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not exactly was I was expecting. Flavors of spicy and then the flavor just seems to hit a bring wall and stops. Also, the dryness is a bit more then I anticipated with an ABV as low as this one. Not a terrible beer but i'd like to try it on tap."
""
"Popping the top yields a classic Belgian smell of both earthy and zesty hops and a very sweet maltiness. Pours to a orange-yellow color with a big bubble head with a semi creamy top. Taste is a light up front bitterness, immediately followed by a sweet malty banana flavor with a hint of clove. Finish is a transition of the banana flavor to a zestier sweetness that has a flat bitterness in the background. A tasty brew that is good on a hot summer day. Good flavors without being as lethal as your typical Belgian so the name fits. Part of a case with 6 different Sam brews."
""
"O - This is a pretty nice beer from Sam Adams. It has all the qualities that a Belgian pale ale should have, but they’re just watered down a bit too much to give this a higher score. Still very tasty, drinkable, and totally sessionable. This came in the summer seasonal pack that I got, and that is the perfect place for it. Great summer session beer."
"The session-ish (youre welcome DING) nature makes it drinkable, but doesnt lack in flavor one bit. Very well done Sam Adams."
""
""
"O- It was a fun attempt for Samuel Adams, but not particularly well executed. Will pass on it in the future."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Pretty good BPA. The balance is pretty good and the finish is nice and crisp."
"Overall I thought that this was an Ok beer and a pretty average example of a Belgian Pale Ale, it seemed like this beer was going in the right direction, but when it got to the taste it ended up falling a little flat. This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth, but the flavor doesn't do a great job at holding my attention, I could drink one or two till I would want something different and more flavorful. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both nice and fairly true to style. What I liked least about this beer was the slightly bland taste, it seems like by making it more sessionable they lost some of the flavors that define this style. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, but I don't dread finding this in the summer pack, it's worth a try, but don't expect an awesome Belgian Pale Ale. In the end I just wish this beer came together better, if the taste matched the aroma it would be a solid beer, but the focus on drinkability takes away from the flavor, I guess I wasn't impressed with this beer, but I didn't hate it, just thought it could be better executed, better luck next time guys."

"This beer pours out an orange color with a tiny head. The aroma is of citrus and Belgian yeasts. The taste again is dominated by the slightly peppery Belgian yeast. There's some bready malts and wheat on the finish that go a long way to balance things out, along with a light touch of mild hops, and a bit of citrus too. The mouthfeel is crisp, and the drinkaility is actually good. As someone who's not too fond of BPAs, this one is pretty solid. I could imagine someone who can't get enough of that peppery yeast being let down, but it's just enough for me."
"Overall pretty good, certainly nothing outstanding but works as a nice light session ale that's very easy drinking with a good flavor profile. A good addition to the summer mix pack, I hope to see it return."

"Drinkability is awesome on this beer. A very refreshing Belgian that is great for the summer time. An awesome selection from Sam Adams that I would suggest for anyone."

"O: This beer is definitely easy to drink and quite sessionable. Seems like a beer that is intended to drive BMC drinkers to better styles of beer - a gateway beer. I might try this one again but not anything I would go out of my way for..."
""
"O) An okay beer, not one i'd return to frequently."
""
""
"Pours a bright gold color, whispy white bubbles, low retention. Scent is mild and muted, faint mutsy grain backed by citrus and grass. Taste brings light bready and moderate citrus, faintly grassy. Light bodied, moderately bubbly. Passable light bodied and flavored beer."
""
""
""
"Pours light gold/copper with fluffy white foam. Some stickiness. Belgian yeastiness in the nose, some citrus. Sugars too. Light crisp refreshing taste. Lemony. Well balanced and very smooth. Good. Like a low grade Duvel, but good enough to keep the summer mix pack interesting."

"(lightly revised with fresh bottle in July 2014)."
"Nice, and good for lunchtime in Summer with a relatively low ABV."
"It almost seems as though Boston Beer is trying to make a bunch of beers that would appeal to a bud light drinker - gateway beers. This is one of those, but it is a nice easy beer to have for refreshment."
"A poor candidate for aging."

"was at a party and saw these in bottles so have out a try and was pretty impressed. poured somewhat amber.smell was rather unimpressive, but the flavor was pretty nice with soft bubblegum and banana notes. very drinkable and great for the warm weather. I will revisit this."

"For a Belgian pale ale, it's pretty so-so."

"Overall: not a bad beer, and I appreciate its session strength, but it's just a little too soapy tasting for my taste."
"The beer pours a yellowish color with a white head. The aroma is fairly fruity with a lot of orange and lemon notes, with a little bit of malt and some yeast thrown in. The flavor is similar, with a nice wheat malt backbone, with some grain and some orange also present. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Fairly straightforward. Nothing offensive, but nothing really stands out."
"Pours out a hazy golden beer with a fluffy white head. Has the typical belgian smell (esters?)that i can never describe. Beer is moderately carbonated. Taste is very mild,dry tart, and pretty good. Mouthfeel is average. I wouldnt quite call it a real belgian but its a pretty good brew"

"O: Pleasantly surprised. Lots of flavor for 4.25%, BBC did well with this one."
""
""
""
"Great head, as is the norm with Samuel Adams products. Honey-gold color, good clarity, and ample carbonation. Laces nicely in my Sam Adams glass. Nose is floral, tropical fruity, dough-y, and some tea notes in there too. High carbonation on the palate, lemon citrus, light caramel malt, and a suggestion of funkyness from the yeast are there. Overall light, easy drinking yet flavorful."
"Overall a basic BPA, but it does sacrifice some flavor. Can see its use as a lunch beer."

"It's ok; pretty good for a session beer (which it is)."
"Tastes a bit of spiced fruits, caramel and a hint of lemon from the hops. A good drinking beer!"
""
""
"Overall –A rather interesting beer. It has a beautiful look and smell, although the taste is a little too peppery for me. While it is peppery it is still very drinkable and very fitting for a session brew."
"Pours a yellowish orange with a frothy off white head that sticks around for a bit. The yeast is the dominant smell, with some banana, sweet, malt, and citrus notes coming through. The taste follows suit with a subtle pepperiness that starts the flavors, the yeast comes through in the middle with a hint of lemon, but the sweet malt notes round out the end of the beer. A nice medium mouthfeel, the flavors could have more depth, and a better mix, but overall the beer is good. This could be a nice intro to belgians for those not used to them because the malt comes through strong at the end to balance out the yeast. Overall a decent beer, not one that I would buy outright but a nice addition to the summer mix pack."

"An impressive inclusion in the Summer Sampler Pack, although my girlfriend picked this up as a single at a local bottleshop. A pleasant surprise. If they fill a whole case with this stuff, at a reasonable price, I might bite. 4.0"

"O: Not too bad...sort of an Americanized Belgian pale ale. The flavors are good and as the name says, it is sessionable."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"O. It's not a bad beer, but it just lacks a solid flavor that you would traditionally hope for from a Belgian or a wheat."

"The flavor is pretty simple. It isn't bad, but there is nothing about this beer that stands out. It does fit the bill as a session beer. I could drink these all afternoon... but I really wouldn't remember much from the experience."
"OVERALL: Not too shabby, the name says it all, its a simple Belgian pale ale. Definitely a welcome session beer."
""

"Nothing special. Aroma is very promising but flavor is disappointing."

"Overall: Not the best BPA, but definitely not the worst. It is great for the buy, which I grabbed in a Sam Adams variety case. Try it for yourself, Salud!"
""
"Really liked this beer and I say that with a bit of surprise. Smooth and drinkable. A good Belgian Ale."
"O: I think they succeeded in creating what they intended. This is an easy drinking, Belgian-style ale. Unfortunately, the flavors are light and not assertive. An appropriate addition to the summer pack, however."
""
"Overall, it's a good summer mix brew but I would never buy a six pack of it were it available. Just not enough flavor. The Harpoon version has a lot more punch to it."
"O - I didn't like the tart level of the beer, just a tad too much for this soft tasting brew. Overall it tasted alright to me, I got a general Belgian yeast flavor throughout, and the abv is low enough to have a few of. So not bad but nothing great to me."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium with medium-high carbonation. Overall, light and refreshing but a bit too grainy and the slight mineral-y nickle-y quality shaves some points as well."

"O: Pretty refreshing overall. Session is not my most familiar variety, but I'm sure I've had better. Regardless, great for a warm summer in the sun."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by August. Pours a clear yellow orange, with a half inch of white head that leaves behind some lacing. Smell is banana, clove, bread, pepper, and grass. Taste is lots of clove and banana, with some pepper in the finish. Body is what you would expect from the name, nice carbonation, little dry, and drinkable. This is not exactly my favorite style, but for me it was pleasant and perfect for the summer mix 12."
"This thing knocks the socks off of Stella and has a lower ABV. A really nice BPA that you can have a few of and still remember your name. Not the most flavorful belgian but I wouldn't mind seeing more of these in the market."
""
""
"Looked and smelled good but there's nothing to taste."
"O: After the look and smell, this certainly goes downhill in terms of being a Belgian pale. The taste has way too much bread and buttery malty notes and not enough of the yeasty 'umph' that Belgians usually have. The feel is also off, most likely from the lack of bottle conditioning. At least it's easy to drink and enjoyable overall. Just not really to style aside from the nose"

"Overall, this beer is not what I expected at all, but generally, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It could be just a bit sweeter, but it really doesn't need to be, it's just my preference."
"Overall - This is a pretty good Belgian ale.. I recommend it. As long as you like spiced beers."
""
"O: Overall a pleasant surprise and I could drink many more of these. By itself it is worth picking up the summer sampler. Nice brew Boston Beer Co. Infinitely better than any ""Moon"" beers."
"Overall - one of the better crafted and more flavorful Sam Adams beers I've sampled. Jim and gang did a good job with this one. Its definitely a step up from many of their other bland offerings."
""
"I'm a sucker for anything new from the pseudo craft brewery. Belgian Session is a great addition to the Summer Mixed Pack (Finally they eliminated Sam Adams Light). Poured into my Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Nice head and light color. By sight you can tell this is going to be a delicate tasting beer and when it hits the taste buds that's exactly what it is. Very refreshing with a hint of citrus. Obviously this beer is sessionable (It's in the name!) but it really would get quite boring after more than two of these. Nevertheless, still a great beer for the warmer days of summer. Not offensive, but not mind blowing either. That's sort of the Boston Beer Company's creed."
"It's a take on a BPA, I get that with the first sip. But it's like Orval light only hints of that classic Belgian character makes it into this summer variety pack Sam Adams offering. I can actually deal with that, because I understand what their doing making a ""session"" version of a beer like that with some of the flavor profile. Appealing pour wtih a pale copper body, bright white head forms thin speckled lacing across the sides of my chalice. Aroma has some spicy yeast components, citric, with herbal mint and a bit of underlying ripened fruit tones. Flavor wise, pretty enjoyable light bodied spicy phenolic character, hints of pepper, ripe fruit with minimal sweetness finishes rather dry. Mouthfeel has a nice light aspect with hints of lingering spiciness, effervescent carbonation for an American BPA. I get what they're doing and I actually enjoy this, not something I'd buy in number but an interesting beer to break down there's a bit more going on than your average new beer addition."
""
""
"O - I love the attempt at this style. I homebrew this style from time to time and really enjoy it. Sam Adams did right with the phenolic profile. I would like it to be dryer than it is. Either with a higher attennuative yeast or more bitterness to balance it out. I would buy this in a sixer if it was available."
""
""
"Overall - A solid, if underwhelming, Belgian Pale Ale. Not quite a dud, but it's the least interesting in this years Summer Mix."
""
""
"O- This beer wasn't bad, however it could have used a lot more flavor. It tasted more like carbonated water with a little bit of a fruity flavor more then anything. Was definitely lighter then I was expecting. Not a bad beer in a mixed 12 though, easily session-able."
"The Sam Summer Styles case caught my eye when I saw this Belgian Session was inside, and it was on sale for $12.99! Poured into a Unibroue Tulip. Decent collar, but faded fairly fast. Classic cloudy light maple coloring. Great nose with the textbook yeasty biscuit aroma of the belgian style. A nice mix of spices, perhaps some cinnamon? I was a little dissapointed in the ABV, but maybe I'm just ued to this style being potent. Overall a good brew, a shame the pack only came with 2. Prost!"
""
"Not too shabby. Reminds me of some of the first basic Belgian Pale Ales I had in my early beer geek days. No frills, but it's got some flavorful and quite drinkable. Wish it was a tad bit cleaner on the finish though."
