"This feels weird to type...this is the first Ommegang product that hasn't blown me away. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it tastes a lot like a handful of other summer ales I've had. It's not something I'd feel confident being able to pick out of a crowd. That said, it's still crisp like a summer ale should be and it's worth buying again when it's actually summer. I have no earthly idea why it's available in February in Pennsylvania."

"Hazy yellow gold with a billowy white head that needs time to settle. Lacing on glass. Smells bright--lemony, floral, herbaceous. Same in the flavor, with the floral aspect most noticeable. Seriously, my dry mouth feels like I've been eating flower petals...but in a good way. Not a lot of complexity, but it is a summer offering. At almost 7%, it's not wimpy, and has stood up to a couple of seasons gone by."

""
""
"O- I love the flavors that Ommegang can create, but their yeast always falls short on mouthfeel... too harsh. Luckily, Fleur De Houblon is a little more subdued and sophisticated."

"O: 4.0 - Very well-crafted beer, though it doesn't stand out as a favorite among their very high-quality line-up. It's still very good."

"Poured into a trappist glass, a hazy golden yellow with a large long lasting white fluffy head. Aroma is of ripe fruit, Belgian yeast, light floral notes. Taste is of ripe fruit, pears, some mild spiced fruity notes, a bit of sweet alcohol, yeast. Palate is crisp medium body with lively carbonation which sits well on the palate. The finish is ripe fruit of pears, mild spice fruit notes, Belgian yeast, has a slight dry sweet alcohol ending with mild bitterness. Overall a very good, flavorful and pleasant drinking brew."

"A well made BPA.  This stays away from heavy so it drinks quite well.  My only complaint is that Ommegang seems to have a bunch of BPA's and they all kind of taste the same."

"Very disappointed with this brew. Taste and aroma were akin to dish soap laced with Pine-Sol. I would sometime like to try this one as a draught, just to compare bottle and tap. Perhaps the 12oz bottle I I sampled was off. I am a huge fan of hops, but just seems that something went wrong with this one. Would be willing to try again, but at this point, I would hardly recommend this beer."

"Pours bright yellow that tarnishes and with a thick fluffy head of foam. Rich floral nose, fresh meadows. Taste is a balanced oily hoppy taste, very dry finish. Slightly sour. Loads of Belgian like goodness. Quite interesting."
"Another very good beer from Ommegang"
"07/23/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Finding some taps left from a Belgian promotion I tried a taste comparison of this & d’Achouffe Houblon Chouffe, which is a triple. Due to circumstances beyond my control, (sort of), like limited funds & being dramatically close to my self imposed ABV limit, I ended up with the Ommegang. No regrets but I will be looking out for the Chouffe. It's robust flavor, body & alcohol were impressive but not of the moment. Not out of place by any means, just bad timing. It's even usurped what started a glowing review of the Ommegang. I'll be looking forward to both, equally, in the future."
"Notes: In my opinion Ommegang just keeps on hitting home runs and this is no exception!"

"O: A very good beer; my third enjoyable beer from Ommegang. This beer is a wonderful example of how an ale can be full of big hop flavors. Lots of well balanced citrus and sweetness and a nice light toasted malt feel back this one up. A beautiful, easy to drink beer with no glaring faults."
"I found it real enjoyable."

"O: The bottle and label including the name evokes Belgium to me, especially the Poperings region where hops are so celebrated in summer. The taste stands up to the style and name. Got this at Whole Foods in Boca Raton, drank in Deerfield Beach FL, July 18th, 2014."

"O: I found this beer to be a really nicely constructed summer brew - a nice combination of a traditional Belgian Pale Ale with some heavier flavors of citrus and a touch more hops than usual. Easy to drink and refreshing with well hidden alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Outstanding! So much going on with this beer and great for the Summer. Another masterpiece from Ommegang and a top shelf Belgian pale ale. I will need to get more of this fine seasonal offering."
""
""
"O: Yum, this is delicious. The mouthfeel could use a few tweaks here and there, if nothing else. I'd have no trouble killing this by the 4-pack, shame I only bought a single. Need more of this..."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of yeast, some fruits. Taste is malts, yeast, some fruitiness, a bit of hops, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a smooth and enjoyable beer."

"A slightly cloudy pale straw in the glass, and if you look close what appears to be fine suspended yeast. Noticeable medium carbonation makes this an attractive and inviting looking beer. The nose is immediate and strongly of clove. Crisp and refreshing, it tastes of clove and maybe a hint of vanilla and wheat. A truly original experience for me."

"A pretty solid Belgian ale."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a good example of a Belgian Pale Ale, I thought the extra hops worked pretty well with this beer and I thought it lived up to being called a Summer Ale. This beer had very good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, very crisp, slightly fizzy, not filling, refreshing and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a few of these in a row with no problem, especially on warm day and I think it makes for a good Belgian Style Summer Ale. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability, it was very good and I liked how refreshing it was, it's just what I look for in a summer time beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing that I disliked or would change about this beer, but do I wish it was just a little cheaper. I would for sure buy this beer again and I wouldn't mind keeping a few bottles around throughout the summer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes Belgian style beers. All in all I was very happy with this beer, it satisfied my urge for a nice summer time brew and I thought it really hit the spot. This isn't my favorite Belgian Pale Ale or my favorite beer from Brewery Ommegang, but I think it's very solid and as far as a Belgian Style Summer Ale this would have to be my favorite. Great job, you guys really know how to make refreshing and easy drinking Belgian Style beers, keep up the great work."

"Overall - I don't know belgian style brews that well (yet!), but I really enjoy this beer. This is my second time trying it."

"Belgian style beers are not my absolute favorite but I am truly enjoying this beer. A refreshing summer brew with a nice alcohol kick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, the aroma was the best part. Hops and body a bit too high to make this an amazing beer. Not entirely sessionable, which it should be for this self described ""summer ale""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light gold and a bit hazy with a bright white cap. Decent head retention with a bit of foamy lacing. Aromas of lemony citrus, straw, a bit yeasty/bready, quite floral. A bit sweeter than expected, moderate bitterness that lingered. Citrus and floral, a hint of spiciness. Lively carbonation, light bodied, off-dry and quite drinkable. Really nice balance and well constructed. I'll definitely pick this up again."

"Pours a cloudy light orange body with massive head and lace that dies quick with some lace. The aroma has a little bit of yeast but mostly a floral hop presence that isn't just citric but gives off touches of grape or sweet apple and I swear there are some other sweet fruits in the aroma. Beer is smooth and sweet and real light, definitely designed for hot summer days, the floral hops give off a crispness that complements the smoothness of yeast and some other fruit (not quite tropical but more like pear) sweetness for a well balanced and composed beer."
""
""
""
""
"An amazing beer. It pours a light golden with a small quickly fading head. It smells of hops with balanced malt and notes of lemon and herb like back ground. The taste is beautifully balanced with excellent malt leading into clean hops. A perfect transition. The mouthfeel is similar to champagne with a very light body and complex small bubbles that would be perfect with shellfish or other light preparations of seafood."

"A very nice beer. It has Springtime written all over."

"The Rest: Another solid beer from Ommegang. A nice, funky change-up from the typical summer ale"
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A very refreshing, yet complex summer ale. The balance of spicy yeast and hops aromas is well crafted. One of the better summer ales I've tasted."

"O: I absolutely love what Ommegang has done here. A pleasantly hopped golden ale that flaunts its effortless balance and complexity. Fleur de Houblon is a fun and easy beer to drink, well-suited for summer, but delicious anytime. The new seasonal lineup has been fantastic thus far."
""
"More bitter than most of Ommegang's offerings. Again, there's a harsh yeast bite geometry hop in the background, but it's not prominent. The aftertaste is better on the hop bitterness, but this still the tale of a strong Belgian yeast flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a superior hop driven Belgian Pale."
""
"O - Hands down, the best summer brew or Belgian Pale I've ever had. Might give 3P a run for its money as my favorite Ommegang offering."

"O-very refreshing brew that is easy drinking"

"A very tasty, citrusy, lemony, flowery brew. Very refreshing and crisp, excellent for summer but also complex enough to satisfy year round. While the hops may be substantial, they don't seem to overpower this beer in any way. I wish I hadn't waited so long to try this and instead started drinking it first thing in the summer (or when it was available). Really nice and solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's got a big head but isn't over carbonated. Light dry and crisp but has a nice floral nose and taste, along with apples, pears and a hint of citrus and even some minty cilantro notes. There's definitely some Belgian backbone but it has good hop presence. Very unique."
""
""
"O/D - More of a Belgian IPA but it's all pretty similar. A nice hoppy Belgian blonde. Very drinkable for the ABV. Liked it alot."
"Serving type: bottle from a carton of 4"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"It was one of the best tasting beers I've enjoyed with punch that didn't upset the palate or my head but I knew it wasn't a session beer or some junk I used to pound in college. I wanted another one after my first and that is usually my mark of something I feel strongly enough to leave a review for. Plus it has been a while."
""
"NB: This is not a personal favorite style. I reviewed it as a representation of what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, pale, golden-yellow coloring, almost opaque, with a tall, frothy, bright white head with huge bubbles and good retention. Aromas of pineapple, honey, pepper, biscuit, lemon, and subtle resiny bitterness. Flavors are spice forward, with a lemony sweet and tart backbone blended with biscuit notes. Hops bitterness and spice creep in at the tail end of the palate, with a more robust spice bouquet also present. Bitter and tart citrus blend into the aftertaste, with grassy and cedar notes. Light, effervescent body keeps the palate light. The finish is light, frothy, and clean, with only a hint of citrus linger. Very drinkable, and a great warm weather drinker."
"Overall – This brewer can do no wrong, another winner. A fantastic summer beer with more than enough flavour to stay interesting throughout the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Simple, layered, tasty, drinkable. Exactly what you want from a pale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy dark yellow into my pint glass. Giant head that is slow to dissipate, a variety of bubbles and ends up with thick beautiful lacing. Floral scent, but noticeable maltiness to it as well. Taste is of a lighter floral hop with a respectable substance to it, balanced with just a bit of malt. There is a certain spiceness to it too, both in flavor and mouthfeel which makes this a unique brew. Mouthfeel is like that of a carbonated mineral water - heavier and spicier though. Aftertaste is more yeasty with a hit of floral hops but quickly fades and doesn't continue to develop. Overall recommended."
""
""
"O- I rather enjoyed this. A light and refreshing brew with enough hop kick to keep things interesting. The aroma was especially pleasurable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great expression of pure green hops in a nicely balanced summer brew. This one is two cuts above the rest and hits it out of double day park. Really in a league of it's own when it comes to summer beers, my favorite by far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" I'm not a fan of the phenol, so this is a tough one for me. I like the other flavors and aromas, but would much prefer it without the bubblegum and bandaid characters. Fairly complex beer, with enough bittering to counter the esters, but not overwhelm."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Price Point - $10.50/ 4pk 12 oz bottles"
""
"The flavor is much like the nose but there is a bit more of a citrus bite and a slightly lingering peppery finish. This has jumped top the of my summer ale list."
"Overall: the perfect summer ale! Not heavy and filling, but very good flavor and smoothness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I should stock up on six packs of this stuff. It is hugely quaffable despite its ABV and it just suits my palate very well."

"Overall, an amzing enjoyable beer. I don't believe I have had a bad beer from this brewery and this one is just perfect for summer."
""
"on tap at the source, this very light Belgian summer beer is just what the doctor ordered after a long drive through the eastern new your countryside. it pours a pale golden color, more yellow really, with a fair bit of suspended sediment and a huge creamy white head that is continually rising rather than falling. I smell grassy hops, very light wheat malt, and the slightest spice kick. the taste is quite herbal, with the hops giving more flavor than bitterness, and the malt being light enough to allow this awesome Belgian yeast to be prominent. the finish is really clean, and the alcohol is very well hidden. the lightness in feel of this beer impressed me the most, and the floral and herbal profile of the hops is a nice seasonal touch. carbonation on par with the rest of the ommegang lineup. this is an excellent summer drink, also really fantastic with a splash of the fruitesse raspberry beer that's also on tap at the brewery. ommegang can do no wrong."
"B-"
"Ommegang is stepping out of their comfort zone with this one- they just don't do hoppy beers- but I'm liking what they did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice Belgian pale ale that is easy to drink and very refreshing on a hot day. Good balance of flavors."
"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with medium to medium-high levels of carbonation, which are appropriate for the style. The carbonation pushes towards fizziness, but never arrives there, leading to a softly effervescent, then foamy and smooth mouthfeel that goes well with this floral and mild citrus-leaning beer. Closes semi-dry, with fairly substantial stickiness lingering on the tongue and lips."
""
""
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, fresh hops and a touch of lemon zest. In the taste, fresh hops, with a minty burn, with a lemon zest sweetness. A hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer fresh hop and notes of lemon citrus in the aftertaste. Nice hop presence and quite refreshing with lemon zest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ommegang never fails to delight and this is a refreshing and well made summer ale that will quench your thirst and delight the palate. Elegant yet earthy. The citrus makes your mouth water and then the apple quenches your thirst. The hops are gentle to the drink and accentuate the fruit , especially the lime. Imaginative and airy."
""
""
"Overall: very good beer that took me by suprise. It's smooth but ridiculously strong in flavors that it might overwhelm you just a but you will appreciate it. A beer best served well done, Salud!"
""
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised"
""
""
""
"O/D-Was not expecting to like this beer so much. Very unique flavor. I enjoyed this more than most BPAs from Belgium. Cut more in my mold."
""
""
""
""
"This is exactly what I want in a summer seasonal. It hits all the refreshing notes needed on a hot day, but shows tons of complex character as well. Very impressed, but certainly not surprised as Ommegang is consistently good."
""
""
"Taste-Floral hops, spiciness, clean, dry finish. Refreshing and complex. Reminiscient of a fresh farmhouse ale or a young saison. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from tap into pint at the lumberyard in Georgetown ct. Nice slightly cloudy golden color pour with a finger of head. Nice floral hoppy mixed with spicy peppery saison aroma. Similar taste...floral hops, a bit of fruitiness, and spicy saison yeast...really well balanced. Nice maltiness and perfect mouthfeel. Really a hoppy saison to me and its really nice."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O-A very enjoyable and highly drinkable BPA from Ommegang. Its one of those beers I could enjoy drinking outside all day. I highly recommend it!"
"O - I really enjoy Ommegang brews. This summer offering is a well craft Belgian pale ale and one warm weather fans could add to their arsenal of summer style ales. I'm not sure id drink this over Hennepin, but it is a very good ale given its characteristics and style format. Definitely something a bit different and hits the phrase summer ale on the head. If you like the literally flowery hopped brew then this is for you. It's bright and beautiful and every drink reminds you of bright floral occasions summer time has to offer. Nice clean brew."
""
""
"Overall (4.25/5): This beer is somewhere between Hefeweizen and hoppy saison. Excellent, extremely drinkable beer that I wouldn't mind having in the winter. I'm very impressed at what Ommegang has done here. They have really struck a wonderful balance between flavors (hoppy, yeasty, wheaty), strength, and body. Wow! A pleasant early summer surprise!"
""
""
""
"A really solid Belgian Pale. Nicely hoppy too. Really enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bring on the salads, cheese and crusty bread. Well worth a try"
"Overall not bad, decent for a summer beer that doesn't get too light or fruity but still brings a nice hop character and without getting too powerful for a summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Great sour beer, pardon me, BPA, refreshing and very well balance in all senses. Highly recommended."

"Pale golden body was hazy, and a large four finger thick head formed rapidly, despite me pouring the beer very gently. The look reminded me a lot of Duvel, but the floral hoppy smell was evocative more of an IPA. Besides the hops, there were spicy, dusty smells imparted by the house yeast strain. The taste was a great combination of typical Belgian Pale Ale flavors, of banana, papaya, melon, and white pepper, and a distinctive hop character. The finish was somewhat tart, and spicy. The body was light and alcohol well hidden. A very easy to drink beer with a refreshing take on the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty sweet summer ale. The ABV is on par with an IPA and it has a pretty constant hop presence. I would get it again but I don't really see it around. I believe I paid $3.39 for the single which is pretty high for repeated purchase."
"The body is pretty light and it's quiet a refreshing beer. It's a nice summer Belgian IPA style beer."
""
""
""
"A beautifully complex brew. Summer Ales are ostensibly 'simple' and 'light'. But this one is sublimely bitter with an enduring aftertaste without being heavy. Boasts a 6.8 ABV but still feels summery. Has that distinctive Ommegang tingly mouth-feel."
""
"Poured into an Ommegang flute glass. Pours a hazy, light golden amber with a two finger, white head that slowly dissipated to a thin film, leaving light lacing. Pleasant aroma of biscuit malt and fresh citrus hops, light Belgian yeast. Flavor is semi-sweet biscuit malt, citrus hops, light lemon citrus, light pear; finishes drier with the hops, Belgian spicing and peppery herbs coming to the fore. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A nice melding of American IPA hops and malt with classic Belgian components. Great with dinner. Ommegang continues to be a consistently fine brewer of Belgian inspired ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: one of the most enjoyable beers (besides their main lineup) that I have had from ommegang in a while. very balanced, refreshing, just a well made beer that fits the BPA style nicely. doesn't even drink close to its abv."
"Good spice forward Pale with good a good hoppy edge. I forget how much this goes for but I might have to pick up a pack of it. Very good balance of yeast and hops in a beer that drinks about 3 percent lower than the listed ABV but delivers as much flavor as it should. Well crafted."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very floral and slightly fruity pale ale. The detractor to me is the carbonation. Too full and hits the mouth too much. It's nice, sure. But it's not quite where I'd want to be for the style. Always nice to try something different from Ommegang."
""
""
"Pours a perfectly clear golden color, white short lived topping that recedes to a ring. No lacework to speak of really. Aroma of rustic Belgian yeast and hop flowers. Bread, wildflower honey, pale malts. In the taste, solid funk, good earthy herbal bitterness and a refreshing tartness that really ties everything together. Light to medium bodied, dry as hell. Enjoyable, very Belgian summer beer for people of taste."
"I only had one in in a sitting but I could have easily downed all 4, since the alcohol was well hidden and there wasn't any lingering spice after I finished off the contents of my pint glass. This was a solid offering from Ommegang and would quickly enter my Summer rotation, if I wasn't going to finish the rest of them off in a matter of days."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer has great appeal for the style and is precise in balance and the taste is super fresh and thirst quenching. Another great beer from Ommegang!"
""
""
""
"This is a damn fine BPA and a refreshing addition to the summer lineup. This may well be in the fridge for months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fine, fine summer brew thats very good and refreshing and has nice depth of flavor."
""
""
"I've tried a couple Belgian IPAs previously and found I didn't like the combination of Belgian yeast and big IBUs. Fleur de Houblon was more to my liking, with a strong hop citric hop presence that did not overpower the BPA flavor."
""
""
""
"O: This is a solidly made, well done beer. Ommegang continues to be one of the more consistent breweries out there. Drinkable."
"Overall: This is a great Belgian pale ale. Admittedly I haven't had too many Belgian pale ales, but this is exactly what I'd expect from one. It has all of the complexity of a tripel without the strength of a tripel. The only aspect I'd like to see enhanced in this beer is the hop character. It would be interesting to see this pale ale with more late addition hops that add similar spicy notes as Bravo (like Saaz). But it's a beer that will quench any palate on a warm summer day. In fact, it might be the perfect beer for that purpose."

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 3/13/2013. Pours cloudy golden straw color with a 3 finger dense and fluffy white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, light banana, pepper, clove, bubblegum, wheat, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of hop and yeast ester notes. Taste of tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, pepper, clove, bubblegum, light banana, floral, grass, wheat, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, floral, grass, wheat, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop and yeast ester flavors; with moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly cream, smooth, and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent hoppy Belgian pale ale! Great balance and complexity of hop and yeast flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
"O: Really nice complexity. A quick favorite summer time brew and a nice change of pace from traditional one dimensional summer brews."
"Overall: Refreshing and likable."
"O: Sort of bridges between being a Belgian Witte with strong yeast and hops profiles and a BPA with some wheat character."

"O: I was really surprised by how much I liked this beer, but I shouldn't have been because Ommegang has been making Belgian-style beers really well for sometime; they must have like a ""proprietary"" yeast that they use, because it is present in most of their beers - it works better for some than others, but it is spot-on in this beer. At times, fuzzy and rich enough to suggest a tripel, but then it lightens as it dries like a very nice Belgian pale - from a little known ""region of Belgium beer-brewing"" called Cooperstown, NY. A must for fans of the style, obviously, but a beer anyone would enjoy."
""
""
"The beer pours a straw yellow with slight golden hue, clear with some hazy sediment, and a huge pillowy white head that laces. The nose is rather potent with big notes of lemon rind, a slight bubblegum, fruit cocktail, and a bit of yeast. The taste is way more potent than expected packing in the American IPA citrus hop punch to the jaw (and residual hop breath obviously), with great yeast presence and a spicy finish. The mouthfeel is relatively light bodied and drinkable with a hoppy (but not bitter), yeasty (but not bready nor gum bally), slightly floral, semi-dry, tangy aftertaste that leaves me wanting more. I can't get past how drinkable this beer is. This is all that I want in a session-esque DIPA (minus the body/sweetness) mixed with an approachable Belgian golden ale. Very lovely beer and will likely not disappoint those looking for hops, yeast, or a delicious hybrid."
"Overall - As usual with ommegang, very tasty. A nice mix of Belgium pale ale, a wheat ale, and a sour ale. Easy to drink, nothing is over the top or strong. Alcohol is masked well, smooth and easy to drink. A winner."

"The local Tap House Grill and Bar had the Ommegang Fleur De Houblon on draft. The beer poured a slightly hazy yellow with creamy white head that left some lacing. The scent and taste were bolstered by the typical belgium style ales....sweet, etc. There was some hop presence and the lower ABV made the beer very drinkable. The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a decent belgium pale ale."
"Pours into a tulip glass a lightly hazed light golden color with a large blooming white head that left two broken rings of lace as it settled.Aromas of toasted grain,white grape skins,honey,and light medicinal hops.Lemony with just a hint of tartness on the palate,a little phenol spice,and a more pronounced herbal/medicinal hop profile in the finish,quite alot going on but it's on the lighter side.A refreshing but not a ""small"" beer in stature,not bad."
"Overall (4.25): This is a really nice beer. I always like a good Belgian Pale Ale and Ommegang, when they do them, do them well. The fact that this is moderately hopped with whole-cone Bravo hops makes it a perfect beer (to my taste) for the summer. The hop character, while not as fresh and clear as it could / should be, is still present and adds a nice dimension, even now. I’d love to see this become an annual (seasonal) release."

"O- Went into this one with no expectations and it really blew me away. BPAs are not one of the styles I seek out a lot, but this one was fantastic."

"I don't know how this beer has escaped my radar, but at least it comes to an end now. It pours a hazy straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises flowers, light greens, light black pepper, very light clove, and a hint of artificial Easter candy. That may have sounded negative, but the combination somehow works pretty well. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some cracked wheat, some lemon zest, more clove, and a pinch of coriander. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice little BPA, nothing truly special, but something pretty darn drinkable."
"An outstanding summer beer,"

"O: A nice, crisp, refreshing beer for the summer. It is definitely an American take on a Belgian beer, but it is very well done. It is a very approachable, aromatic, and drinkable summer beer."

"Pours a brilliant, happy yellow color crowned with an expectedly huge, frothy, pure-white head that fills up my tulip to the top with rocky, foamy goodness. Aromas are initially grassy and floral with a doughy sweetness, clove, and peppery yeast. Funky lemon, bubblegum, and increased dried fruity esters as the head dies down. Spicy, herbal hops, yeast, bright orange zest, hay, and lemon. Really well done. Creamy, not particularly effervescent, but dry and still quite refreshing. Excellent!"
""
"Bottle. Pours a hazy darker yellow color with ginormously thick white head on it. Nose is a little hard to get at with the huge head, but I can get some of the spice elements to it. Taste has the same bit of spiciness to it, and ends up being just a tad sour and dry. Nothing special to me."

"Overall, not a bad beer, but there are just so many BPAs that I like better. I may seek this one out in bottle form, to see if there may have been a tap issue involved."

"Great appearance, huge creamy white head, that held for a long time, and has great lacing. The smell was citrusy and earthy but that's about it. Taste is interesting. Heartburn after 4 big sips. Very lithely hoppy, tons of citrus, and a nice yeasty character. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, and mildly efflorescent."
""
"Mouthfeel-Once again, very much of a summer beer that is reminiscent of Summerfest or Porch Rocker. Low hop profile makes it an easy beer for afternoons at the beach. Little carbonation ensures it goes down smooth and easy."

"Easy to drink, not a great example of the style, but pretty good, was hoping this would be hoppier, Might buy this again, not convinced that I would in most cases..."
"Bready, yeasty, and floral. Nice hop character throughout. Light and refreshing with plenty of flavor. Alcohol presence is minimal and unobtrusive. A solid example of the style."
"Beautiful beer pours a brilliant golden orange with a hazed yeast suspension going strong, bright slightly off white head forms thick like a mousse, cloudy textured pillows above the sides of my Piraat chalice. Aroma has spicy black pepper notes, herbal green fresh cut grass, citrus rinds, a nice mix of green summery hop components Fleur de Houblon is flower of hops. Finishes each sniff with the house yeast spicy aspects that are almost like a candied bread dough, very festive. Citrus bursts with green hops, sweet fruitiness hints of tropical fruits and blue agave tartness, spicy yeast presence kicks in the finish with the spicy herbal floral hops crashing with each sip wonderful summer ale for sure. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with effervescent Belgian style carbonation this is slick and oily with hop oils as well, lingering bitterness is a match between the house yeast character and whole Bravo hop additions. I really really enjoyed this Ommegang offering unlike anything I've tried recently homerun for complexity and refreshment."

"A rather approachable BPA, especially in this format. A four-pack labeled 'Summer Ale'... the people that are going to spring for this are going to be pleasantly surprised, and hopefully, turned on."

"A nice smack of hops with a modest bitter aftertaste. Some bready flavors with that fragrant hoppiness, and a restrained drying yeastiness. A very satisfying lighter sort of beer with a pleasing Belgian character. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Olive Tree Market in Ocean Beach. I'll get a six pack if I can find one."

"O: This is a really solid summer beer. It's light, but complex. It's sweet, but spicy. It's Belgian in style and super drinkable. I might be drinking quite a bit of this beer this summer."

"Poured into a Duvel tulip. The beer pours hazy golden with lots of visible tiny bubbles and a thick white head. Plenty of lacing is left behind on the side of the glass. The aroma is of pilsner malt and lots of floral hops with some citrus in the nose as well. I also get some peppery notes with clove and maybe a bit of a tropical fruit note. The flavors are quite complex and live up to the bright nose. I get the floral hops, citrus, tropical fruits, pepper, and bready pilsner malt along with the banana and clove flavors from the yeast. It has strong saison like characteristics in the flavor and everything comes together excellently. The body is medium with strong carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry and this is a very refreshing summer beer despite clocking in at near 6.8% ABV. This is an excellent beer."

"Overall: A very solid take on the Belgian Pale Ale. Crisp and easy drinking for summer but still packs a good punch. Solid fruity and grassy taste."

"The beer gave off a yellow, hazy, yeast color with white head that just stood up. Upon first smelling the beer, I thought that it was a combo Belgian and Hefe...it had that sweetness you would expect from the Belgian, but with a banana, pepper and clove and a hint of citrus. The taste followed the nose really well and I really enjoyed the taste. Perhaps combining two of my favorite styles. The beer had a lighter feel than expected, but this did not detract from the beer as it still had a nice smooth, almost creamy feel. It had a clean, dry finish. Overall, another stellar beer from one of the best in the land."

"O: Bought it on sight, laser beam style. Having not known of about it, I hoped for the best, based on my faith in Ommegang; expectations exceeded. They're inventing a kind of Belgian triple mixed with a hoppy summer ale, almost like a 668 from NEBCO."
""
"A sublime, well hopped Belgianesque beer. Straw coloured and hazy. Enormous klingy head. Earthy, haylike hops with lemon and black pepper notes as well. Sharp hoppy attack up front, lemon zest and soft bready malt in the middle. Finish is dry, with a pleasant bitter, black pepper flavour. This beer bears more than a passing resemblance to Saison DuPont. Subtle malt, citric hops, faint black pepper and bitter dry finish. Well done Ommegang, I'm a fan."
""

"Overall: Very nice hoppy ale from Ommegang. While not like what most craft breweries do, this is their version of a Belgian IPA, and I like it."
"Hazy gold, big build of white foam that deflates into random clumps. Sharp but unique hoppiness - prominent lime, spring flowers, clean herbal spice. Malt is simple - clean, crisp pale malt, crackery wheat. Some light spice and fruit from the Belgian yeast but it pretty much stays in the background and lets the hops shine. Bitterness is smooth despite the bright hop flavors. Dry. Really dry and crisp. A really tasty beer for warm weather drinking. Bright, juicy hops combined with the clean and dry finish lend superb drinkability."
""
""
"Ommegang's first real hoppy beer is Belgian at heart. Even with slightly muted Belgian-esque character, the hops elevate with all that rustic earthen charm that those hops allow. Its a seriously drinkable ale with a bitter cloak."

"I really liked this one. A delicious Belgian Pale in an easy-to-drink 12 ounce bottle that I'll definitly have in my fridge.. Bring on Summer and bring on the Fleur De Houblon!"
"O: Outstanding hot-weather stuff. In the upper tier of Ommegang's expanding lineup of Belgian pales."

"O- On the better side of the summer wheat style. Complex. Another solid Ommegang offering."
""
"Pours a hazy light gold with a super foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with floral and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a really nice balance between the hops and the Belgian aspects in the aromas and flavors."
"D - This beer screams summer. Complex and one of the better beers I have had this year."
"Pretty good BPA. I enjoy the good hop notes in this brew and the Belgian style background is well crated as always by Ommegang."
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid offering from Ommegang. It's a great spring beer and one I'll look forward to having again. It's not overly hoppy as one would think by the description on the label. It's kinda like a mix between a saison and a Belgian pale ale, with added hop notes. A nice blend of malt, tart, hay, funk, and hops. Not overly doing it in any category."
""
"This is a really nice beer. This would work great in the hot whether. I personally think I've enjoyed other BPA attempts by Ommegang a little more, but this is no slouch at all and well crafted."
"O- Take a hopped up wheat pale ale, ferment it with Belgian yeast, bottle condition it with brett. It does'nt make a ton of sense but it is different, well done and delicious."

"Overall: The subtitle “summer ale” says it all. This is a very good BPA from a brewery that consistently produces solid beer. Given that there were no reviews up for it, I took the chance on this one, and I do not regret it in the slightest. The beer is very balanced and very refreshing, and it is perfectly suited to drinking on the porch on a warm day; the problem is that I would like it to be less balanced and more hop forward in order to live up to the name and the hop that is the logo. The 6.8% is a bit high for what is essentially a quaffer, but you do not taste that at all. Give this a shot, if only to have another nice summer beer with a bit of a different flavor profile alongside the typical pale ales and weizens. 15.5/20"
