Even at six months past it’s best date this was tasting great. I haven’t ventured too far into the Belgian Ales just yet but this one comes across as done right. Just really well constructed with some brilliant simplicity is all I can say. Will definitely be checking out more from these guys.","Nugganooch","Jun 06, 2014"

4.08,2.3,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"O - is it special? Probably not to most. But for me, this is a real gem from Ommegang. We live in a world where hops, massive amount of abv, and huge stouts rule every inch of our country. This offers something everyone can enjoy. Lighter beer drinkers will appreciate its generously fruity palate, there is some hops there for the everyday hop head, the belgo freaks get a traditional Belgian style all the while those looking to expand their hop palate will find this a great beer to gradually bring you to those gifted places. All in All, BPA is a fine little ale and a part of the Ommegang family of fine American- Belgian ales. This is the perfect spring time beer. I know it'll be in my fridge when we start seeing green in nature again next spring.","BradtheGreat7","Oct 18, 2013"

It was caramel colored in the glass, very rich looking with a fair head. Smelled of citrus with wheaty overtones. Very smooth taste, wheaty but not too bitter. My only complaint was that at the final few sips the citrus was a bit too much. Great beer!","USArmySteve","Oct 07, 2013"

None of the flavors jump out and hit you over the head, but there is enough going on in there that you are highly motivated to finish the pint. I really enjoyed this beer and have ranked it among my favorites for the style (4.25/5).","mhaugo","Sep 29, 2013"

3.69,-7.5,4.25,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Overall I thought this was nice Belgian Pale Ale and an above average example of the style, but it had a couple flaws that held it back from being as good as it could be. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and not filling, the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think the carbonation would really start to wear one me if I had more than one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, I thought they were both good and pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was just a little bland and it didn't really live up to the good aroma. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's pretty pricey and there's a few other BPA's that I like much more than this one, I would recommend it if you really like the style but I don't think I would recommend it to any of my friends. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, it wasn't bad, but it for sure wasn't on the same level as some of the better ones of the style and it doesn't come close to being as good as my favorite Belgian Pale Ale which is Orval, I tend to prefer a Belgian Pale Ale with a slight bit of funk to it. This made for an ok first impressing of Ommegang, I got a few more of their beers to try so I can get familiar with them, but so far i'm not really impressed, but we will see how I feel after I try some of their more popular beers.","StoutHunter","Aug 17, 2013"
4.11,3,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Cool that it tastes like it came straight from a brewery in Belgium rather than a North American brewery adding some Belgian yeast to their PA. The head is huge and rocky with a slightly cloudy dark gold colour. The nose is pure brewery with a yeasty tang( plus the hops of course). I really liked the way the beer tastes like a fresh beer straight from the keg, all yeasty and thick in the mouthfeel. Unlike any pale ale I have tried. At times it feels like an English bitter with the taste of the hops and the slightly under-carbonated mouthfeel. Great beer","canucklehead","Aug 17, 2013"

Combines the best of a Belgian style ale with the best of a pale ale creating a refreshing beer that is lighter than a normal pale ale while retaining its classic characteristics.

Aromas of big pear, apple, lemon, pepper, grass, hay, earth, bread, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of lemon, pear, pepper, grass, orange zest, apple, hay, earth, clove, herbal, bread, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, grass, herbal, earth, pepper, clove, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; no cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian pale ale! Very well balanced with nice complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink.

Lemon, yeast, orangey citrus, bready notes, apricot, mango, and some grapefruit. The yeasty/bready flavors are the most prominent in the long haul. Those really stick around while the citrus from the dry-hopping move in and out quickly. On the back end mango floats back up onto the palate and out through the nose.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, fruit hop, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, fruit hop, spice, earth, and earth hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. This was a fair example of the style, but nothing really stood out at all on it to me. I went back a second day and accidently ordered the same brew as I forgot I hadn’t ticked it the day before and immediately got upset with myself. While this one isn’t bad, it just wasn’t my cup of tea as I really wanted something that would wow me. Unfortunately this was not it… Worth trying for yourself to give it a shot, especially if you are a fan of the style.","thagr81us","Jul 28, 2012"

The head was a white mixture of bubbles varied from tiny to midsize giving the visual character of soapsuds. The nose was citrus-like and maybe a bit floral.

It had all the drying, bittering wheat one could hope for, with a nice dash of clove. We would have liked to see a bolder feel, with a thicker body and more punch from the paler side of the malts.","TheBrewo","Feb 14, 2012"

Being a homebrewer, I would have tried to smooth the pepper hop profile and balance the noble hops a little better. Not bad, just not one of Ommegang's better beers.

Aroma is a strong combination of orange and caramel malt along side some mellow, but balanced, earthy yeast. Tart flavor from the yeast upfront which gives way to the caramel toasty malts. That soon gets washed over by some fruity orange and lemon similar to the nose. Finishes with a earthy yeast bite along with some other character, most likely from hops, I can't recognize. Smooth malty body all the way through with a lot of yeast and hops working together nicely.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 28, 2011"

It pours straw yellow with a murky, cloudy tone and a bit of sedimentary deposits floating about. The aroma is all encompassing sugar sweet, fruity, and hoppy. The body is bold but also smooth. The taste is also quite sweet with a bit of berries and a clearly dry hopped finish. This is another fine brew from Ommegang.","puboflyons","Aug 20, 2011"

3.53,-11.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a bright yellow color w/ a nice two finger off white head. Good carbonation and decent lacing on this beer. Smell is that of malt, grains, clove. Smell is definitely on the weak side for this style. Taste is the same profile, and there's just something missing in this brew. It doesn't meet the best in the style for sure. Mouthfeel is on the thin and dry side for this style. It needs to have more substance to it to score higher. Overall, this beer misses the mark on the style. It's not bad, but you can find a lot better examples to drink. Pretty sure I won't pick this one up again. A disappointing beer from a really good brewery.","jayhawk73","Aug 12, 2011"
4.2,5.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at The Bulldog in Minneapolis. Served it it's own glass. This beer arrives a clear orange-gold color. The head is a firm half inch in height, and recedes very slowly leaving nice lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of lemon and orange peel with a hint of barnyard funk. The taste is a lot funkier than the aroma, but not over the top. There are also some nice citrucy notes in the back ground. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice refreshing Belgian Pale Ale. I will happily drink this beer again.","KarlHungus","Aug 12, 2011"
4.25,6.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This pours a yeast hazy light orange color with a foamy head. The smell is semi sweet, I get some banana, cloves and a little bready malts. Feel is medium, lots of tingling sensations and high carbonation. The taste is pretty great, I get a load of fruity sweetness and some bread malts followed by a very nice dryness and a little bitterness. This is a might fine tasting beer and I'll get it again. This is my type of summer beer.","DavidST","Aug 11, 2011"
3.53,-11.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The palate opens with an unanticipated Bretty clove flavor. This beer has none of the other characteristics you'd expect from a Bretted beer - it didn't gush, there's still some heft to the palate - but that spice character is quite noticeable. Further sips and gulps allow the grapefruit to come to the forefront, along with the chalk to replicate that clove Brett character. Apart from the clove and hops, this beer does have a mild honey flavor before drying out on the finish, leaving flavors of clove, citrus hop and grainy bitterness and just a touch of alcohol. Adding the yeast to the pour adds a little heft to the palate, and increases the spiciness here. Ultimately, this beer is medium-light, crisply carbonated and has an enjoyable finish. Solid stuff, but for the money, I'd rather buy a Duvel.","DefenCorps","Aug 10, 2011"
3.48,-12.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"O- Thought it was a decent beer but girlfriend couldn't stand it. She wanted to start a profile to describe her feelings for this beer.

4.15,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The pale ale taste is subtle but interesting. It has a hoppy character along with the mild belgian yeast taste. I would never refust one of these but I will not necessarily seek them out either.","schoolboy","Aug 05, 2011"

4.18,4.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Estery with a pillow for a bubble cap. Hoppy nose, bottle says, ""Cascade."" I'll take their word for it. Dry, bitter, metallic and with a bit of raisin on the tongue.

3.87,-3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O - The scent and appearance are extremely good on this particular BPA, but the mouthfeel seems to mute some of the tastes that I think would otherwise be more apparent, and I was a bit disappointed that the yeast and malt didn't play a bigger role.

4.15,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O- Another expertly crafted brew from Ommegang. At 6.2% abv, this beer is sessionable; and, so far as the taste and medium body are concerned, it would be great for just about any food pairings.","MVotter","Jul 31, 2011"

Flavor is crisp, more fruity than malty, with a woody overtone, and both bitter and sweet hints that balance each other nicely.

The hoppiness lingers just enough to keep all the flavors together, making sure it's not too bitter or too sweet. Nothing I love more than a that perfect balance of sweet and hoppy.

The retention of the head was good and the lacing impressive in bands that streaked like curtains all the way down my glass. The aroma was of candi sugar, spicy hops, some floral notes, caramel malt, crystal malt and a touch of honey. The flavors were excellent for the style and very much like the aroma in every way. Sweetness from Belgian candi sugar first hit me but buried beneath that was caramel malt, spices, complex Belgian yeast all leading up to a definitive, yet not heavy handed, hoppy finish. Clean. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation light.","thekevlarkid","Dec 26, 2010"

Into a stemmed Stone IPA glass, it poured a translucent, highly-carbonated golden copper, with three fingers of white, that retained and laced well. Smelled of apple and pear; fragrant, but not very bitter or herbal at all. The taste was very floral in nature; big apple flavor with a thin dry bitter finish. Very thin, highly-carbonated feel.

Pours a beautiful slightly hazed glowing golden amber hue. Bright off white head forms large bubbles nice and thick four finger depth with chunk scattered lacing. Aroma contains sharp citric, deep floral, and tropical fruit juice. Dry acidic note tickles the nares along with spicy yeast layer, pale biscuit malts bring some mild bready edges. Overall flavor is excellent, I don't think Ommegang does much wrong. Fruity citrus/mango infused mix of hop notes, dry bitterness rules but spicy yeast and biscuit malt with a hint of caramelization balances enough to make this incredible. Mouthfeel is effervescent, dry finish ample sturdy bitterness throughout a beautiful experience that I plan to experience again.

A little bit of spotty lacing, but this wasn't long lived. Spicy and phenolic aroma initially, but this mellowed quickly to let other characters come forward - malty bread and yeast, grapefruit, pears. Crackery as it warmed with additional citrus. Moderate bitterness with juicy citrus, sort of a combination of grapefruit, lemon, and orange. Bready, wheat crackers, a bit of tart fruitiness. Mild clove spice and peppery tingle in the finish.

Mouthfeel is crisp, medium-light in body, and almost too carbonated, but bubbly enough to kick in some zest to the palate. BPA is an easy sipper, and one of the better Belgian Pale's I've come across in recent memory. Distinctly American, but holds true to its stylistic roots. Goes great with a rice dish...recommended!","wagenvolks","May 12, 2010"
3.68,-7.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Tasted from 750mL bottle. Pours a cloudy tan orange with a thin beige head. Hoppy nose with that signature Belgian yeasty smell that always reminds me of lemon and biscuit. Palate is super mellow with the hops taking a back seat. Lemon zest, biscuit, black pepper, and light hops flavor round out the palate. The carbonation is very high with a sticky texture and a rather short finish. This is an easy drinker that will go great with foods.","wedgie9","May 11, 2010"

Held up the window (trust me, it's sunny out), the lion rampant or turns a sable against a light, hazy, sunset-like tenne (ah, heraldry). The bright, seemingly ermine suds leave a lovely halo etched along the rim while the liquid drains beneath it. Plenty of smells comin' offa this guy, including some banana, cloves, wheat, damp straw, a tiny bit o' soap, flowers, and sweet woodruff. The cloves, woodruff, and soap stage their vengeance on the tongue, along with a hint of pepper and a splash of citrus peel. A bit of spice drfits on into the distance. It's all pretty light and breezy, fitting nicely with the sunniness outside and in the glass. Currently the top of the BPA heap right now.","TMoney2591","May 10, 2010"

At first I was struck by the delicate bready malt and candy character, then I was amazed by the citrus and apricot hop flavor. That's quite a pairing of malts and hops in a Belgian pale, but the flavors are expertly balanced and sublimely subtle. Find this beer. It's not quite like anything I've tried straight from Belgium, but there's no doubt about its heritage.","tempest","May 09, 2010"

I can't see this standing up if a lot more of these get made though. As it is though, I am thoroughly enjoying this beer. My biggest complaint is that the malt seems to muddle things a bit; it does add complexity, but seems to get in the way of the crisp hops and interesting yeast character, though it does add extra complexity, which isn't really needed in a beer chock-full hops and yeast character. This would also be a bit lighter and more refreshing without the extra malt character; and I don't think that would be a bad thing.","Gueuzedude","May 05, 2010"

Wow, what a serious hop flavor. It's dry and bitter with a serious amount of yeast character. The malt bill is relatively simple and it acts as a base for what is a terrific example of hops and Belgian yeast compliment each other. The mouthfeel is fine.

Smell follows suit with a melange of tropical fruits especially banana, grainy malt goodness, yeasty breads, bubblegum, and peppery spiciness. So much fragrance going on you could spend the night sniffing. Citrusy hops and light caramel notes. Taste is a follow through of the nose with a touch of vanilla, tart green apples, pears and grapes. The dry hopping gives a clean and grapefruit tinged finish with a dry quenching feel. A crisp and prickly carbonation adds to that quenching aspect and really brings this one close to perfect here as there is a creamy fullness to what is a medium light brew. Drinkability is also close to perfect and I may revise my score in that direction after I acquire a few more of these for the near future. What a great brew!

Aroma is citrus (tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel), yeast, pine hops and a bit of cloves. I think the taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some candi sugar and peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth, refreshing and very easy to drink. It's a good beer today, and would be even better on a hot day.

Medium body with a soft and delicate mouthfeel, holding some tangerine, navel orange, banana-like phenols, finishing with the slightest prick of hops. An interesting take on this version. Ommegang sure is one of the best, if not the best, at domestic Belgian replications, and this is a solid offering. Best way I can explain this is that it has the esters of a Tripel and the phenols of a Witte. I would have liked for this to have been a little cleaner. The label boasts that it's been dry hopped with Cascade, yet there's not a whole lot of citrus or pine on the end, which is a bit disappointing. I get brewing in subtleties, I would have just like to seen a bit more bite here.
