Smell: floral, big not quite ripe nectarine, a little spice cake. Taste: peach and lemon, lightly acetic and herbal, more dry stone fruit and coriander, very lightly bready backing, finishing dry with more peach skin and lemon tea. Wee bit of goat cheese and woodiness, nice. Light-medium bodied with very creamy carbonation. Not a lot going on - very tasty and easy drinking though - it would have been great for the summer but this bottle stamped 3/14 just made it to local shelves.","babaracas","Jan 22, 2015"

Flavor: bone dry, tart, hint of balancing bitterness, actual spices and spiciness from the yeast fully in control, bready malts in the background, floral/grassy hops.  Mouthfeel: light, crisp, effervescent.  With such excellent head retention, you get fluffy head in every sip; kind of like with a Coke float.  Truly excellent beer.","goochpunch","Nov 29, 2014"

4.02,-0.5,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a little Belgian Pale Ale like to me and I think it's a good example of a lightly funky and pretty drinkable Jolly Pumpkin beer, I don't think the spices added that much to this beer, but they certainly didn't take anything away from it. This beer had pretty nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, dry on the finish, not filling, slightly refreshing and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, this is a nice bottle to split, but I don't think I would have any problem drinking the whole bottle especially on a warm day in the summer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, nothing was too overpowering with this beer and it seemed like all aspects were kept in check. What I liked the least about this beer was that spices didn't come through a little more and a little more citrus in the flavor wouldn't hurt either. I would buy this beer again, at over $13 it's a little pricey for what you get, so I don't think I will be buying it that often and I recommend it to anyone who likes sessionable funky beers. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I like it a little more than I did when I first tried it. It went down pretty easy on a warm first day of June. It's not my favorite Jolly pumpkin beer or sessionable funky beer, but it's pretty good in it's one right and I enjoyed it. Good job guys, this was a nice warm weather beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","May 30, 2014"

I know this beer comes out in June, but two Junes ago? Ruh, roh. Can a 6.5% alcohol beer survive 15 months? Well, I bought this beer from the refrigerated beer section at Whole Foods and I think the proper storage environment has treated this beverage well. I’m guessing the bottle conditioning chipped in as well. I actually really like it. To me it tastes a little more like a Saison than a Belgian Pale Ale, but it’s on the darker side and maybe not quite as dry. Very nice (4/5).","mhaugo","Sep 16, 2013"

Aromas of big tart apple, lemon, pear, pepper, clove, coriander, grass, hay, funk, floral, herbal, light leather, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity, funk, and spicy notes. Taste of tart apple, pear, lemon, pepper, clove, coriander, hay, grass, light leather, and earthy spiciness. Light earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, coriander, pepper, clove, grass, hay, light leather, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes with funkiness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish.

Not sure if this is aged in any sort of barrel but some wood accompanies the pale ale, some floral aspect. Fruity in the middle with apple orange and coriander. A bready finish with yeast.

Fresh green tea, grass, flora, spice, and pleasant fruit including pear and light orange notes carry throughout. Finishes dry with coriander and white pepper joined by citrus blossoms and slight bitter grassy hops. Medium carbonation, heavier light-bodied to light medium bodied.

I love the citrus. It's both lemony and has a nice tangerine side to it. The flavors are nice and light. The citrus character is the first thing you notice, followed by how soft everything is. The oak is perfect! It really does drink like a light barrel aged saison. This is definitely one of the most impressive Jolly Pumpkins. The mouthfeel is very light yet also velvety smooth.

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured this into a tulip. Lots of head on this one that looks like a big pile of mashed potatoes with really drawn out retention. More head than beer in the initial pour so it's kind of frustrating but it settles eventually leaving a nice hazy straw colored beer with a bit of sediment sitting on the bottom. I probably should have been more gentle on the pour. The beer also has big thick chunks of soapy lacing. Orange zest comes to mind on the aroma and there's a bit of funkiness to this one. With that bitter hops are present as well. The taste is slightly tart to begin but it seems to mellow out after a few sips revealing a candied citrus sweetness and slight bitter finish. The mouthfeel is relatively light with ample carbonation and kind of a dry finish.

Dry, dry finish, in the middle of the palate I get some of that lemon and pinapple. Drinks well, like a pale ale.

Good level of funk, but hasn't quite hit the level of complexity I like and am used to from Jolly Pumpkin beers. Taste really reflects this, as it's somewhat one dimensional, although still tasty. Just doesn't stand up to pillars like Orval and Westy Blonde. Mouthfeel is a nice touch--light with good carbonation.

I have only seen this once in Southern California but if I were to come across it again I would instantly pick it up.

The finish is a touch fruity/sweet and a touch sour, but not puckeringly so. Somehow it remains dry in spite of all this. Surprisingly smooth considering the tart brett character.

4.16,3,5,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer came in a 750 ml. bomber with a very artfully done label. The Belgian style pale ale came out cloudy, deep golden, and bubbly, and readily formed a rocky two finger head, that kept rising up until it was sticking above the glass in a volcano shaped cone of bubbles. Havent seen a display such active carbonation since the last time I cracked open a Duvel. The nose was classic Jolly Pumpkin sour, with a clear note of Brettanomyces, which undoubtedly was lurking in the crevices of the barrels this beer was aged in. The taste was dry, oak-influenced, and earthy, with the Brettanomyces showing up rarely as band-aid. The spices were quite muted, and hard to pick out above all the other flavor influences. The band-aid off flavor and the Brett character faded as I let the beer breathe, and Luciérnaga became sweeter and mellower. Pleasingly medium in body, this was also quite warming for a 6.5% ABV pale ale, which was probably due to the fact that I was gulping this easy to drink beer down fast. In my opinion, this was one of the best uses of barrel aging I have run across for a while, and quite fitting the term Artisan Ale that is proudly a part of the name of this brewery.","rajendra82","Aug 11, 2006"

Of ascending church steeples and descending bodies in genuflecting waves going up-down up-down. Some bedraggled saint has his face pressed against the stain glass crying knowing that the earth will never suffer as it has sewn. And so being a lit fool is said to be the worst way to review a beer but I disagree.

Firefly is no different, upholding the classic brewing principals and modern artistry that we all should be demanding of our beers. Very lemony and oak-ey aromas exploding from the bottle. Pouring a diry peach color, a rocky head forms even before the beer hits the bottom of the glass. Spicy, peach and pears soon follow up in the aromas and transfer a moderate sweetness into the flavor. The wood aging really rounds off belgian yeast twang, overbearing spiciness, and alcohols. Very woodsy, musty, nutty, with a bold date flavor without the fruity sweetness. Very dusty and earthy throughout with overripe fruits. Not syrupy or sweet. Well matured and formulated. The oak may get a little dominant, and where I may criticise this in one sip, I'll applaude it in the next. The beer improved as I swirled the yeast sediment into suspension, then decanting into the goblet, then gulped it down. Amazing how I can pour 3/4ths of the bottle into the glass and the carbonation still pushes the foam from the top--it's quite magical. I really appreciate what Jolly Pumpkin does.

Anyway there were some floaties as you can imagine. The color was hazy orange-yellow with a tremendous head that became chunky and flecked with yeast. The smell was spicy and sweet with a alcoholic burst countered with a citric swirl. The taste is earthy and funky with a citric sword slicing open my stomach, the peppery dryness in the finish is nice and I really enjoy the aftertaste.

The beer had a nice sweet, tart aroma of grapes, maybe apples. The taste is toasty, malty with a bit of a hoppy bite that is enjoyable. The beer is not overally complex but is drinkable and another good beer from Jolly Pumpkin.","ggaughan","Jan 29, 2006"

A bit of barnyard funk too. The flavour's slightly tart and fruity with an earthy, woody quality underneath. Quite dry, maybe a bit salty. Spice hangs in there through the finish along with leafy bitterness. Light body, high carbonation, a bit of slickness, but mostly dry. Fairly complex, but tasty and quite drinkable.","DrJay","Jan 25, 2006"
4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Aroma is funky and spicy with a soft sweaty (not musty) tinge..like a womens sweat not sharp, greasy man sweat. Pour was the most Belgian-like I have ever seen from an American made Belgian style. The look of Belgian ales when being poured have always had an appeal to me so that alone earn points. Pale amber color with a frothed up, two finger thick, creamy, lasting white head. Fore is very herbal and spicy with lots of mashed vegetable/herb notes. Almost has a stewed zuccini flavor to it. There are some sweeter soft fruits beneath, but the spices and herbal notes dominate. Lot of funky, overripe flavors in the finish. There is so much going on here and yet it still stays soft and fun to drink. A very interesting beer.","Jredner","Jan 23, 2006"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: The drinkability is good. The hop character that makes this unique lessens my compulsion to rapidly pour this down my gullet.

3.65,-9.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"750 ml bottle. Jolly Pumpkin's Luciernaga has a slightly hazy amber color with a small head of white foam. The aroma is tart apple skins, orange peel, coriander, and pepper. The flavor is fruity and spicy. It starts out with a dry malty flavor. Fruit comes in with a strange combination of apples, peaches, grapes, and melons. Finish is spicy and a little hoppy. Some medicinal flavors get in the way of what is otherwise an interesting, complex flavor. It may be the hops I object to, but I'm not quite sure. The beer shows promise, but the recipe needs just a little tweaking.","beveragecaptain","Dec 27, 2005"
4.13,2.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability & Notes  An interesting take on a golden Belgian ale, with less bitterness, but great yeast character. It has the complexity of a beer of 8% at only 6.5%, and retains that lower alcohol drinkability.","OldSock","Dec 26, 2005"

The beer tastes of corriander and Grains of Paradise layered on top and behind a solid Belgian yeast base. Bitterness in the finish gives this beer the ability to perfectly match with peppercorn pate and sausage. Overall this is a very complex beer that opens up new nuances as it warms up. Very well done.","canucklehead","Dec 13, 2005"

3.6,-10.9,4,4,3,4,4,"This one pours a light amber color with a medium head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is comprised of a little spice, some floral hops and some citrus (lemon). The flavor is very similar. Quite a bit of the floral hop flavors along with a bit of peppery spice and a caramel malt backbone. Interesting flavor here, but I don't care much for the hop and spice combination they used. Tasty, just not my thing. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good.","clvand0","Dec 04, 2005"

4.27,5.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a ton of puffy foam over top that is maintained by a huge cascade of bubbles. Head falls pretty slow. Nose is really nice. Great balance between zesty lemon, noble hop floral character, light spun sugar sweetness, and very nice spicey esters. Wow. Lots going on there. There is a nice zing to this beer. Medium tartness and lemon flavor with a moderate spiceyness and a medium residual bitter that just plays on the sides of my tongue. After things fade, it leaves a light sugary sweetness with nice light spiceyness. I really like it. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Highly drinkable brew. Nothing to get in the way. I will have this one again. Another good brew from JP.","kmpitz2","Nov 29, 2005"

4.05,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Broad and big in the mouth up front, but it generally dissolves into a lightly clingly waifness. The product is wider than it is deep. The flavors it chooses to manifest are bright and neon and boardering on gaudy. For this reason it- despite its overall tastiness- is not as drinkable as it would appear. Though it is special in that "one-hitter quitter" sense. And of the JP's I've had thus far, its the only one I'd actively try to revisit.","cokes","Nov 25, 2005"

In anycase... this brew poured out to a cloudy copper color with a huge foamy head. Almost like fluffed marshmellow. High levels of carbonation a lace laden interior of the glass. Aroma was very yeasty, with hints of citrus and malt. Taste was unique; flavors of mildy sour malt, yeast, dough, candied sugar, and fresh raw veggies kept the palate busy. Mouthfeel was medium light bodied making the beer very easy to consume. Drinkability is pretty good. Not an everyday beer, but this would compliment cheese and crackers very well.

Fruits stand out quite a bit with apples and pears being most recognizable. Nice spicy earthy hop tones and a tad bit of yeastiness round out the aroma. Flavor starts with a bit of sweet fruitiness with more apples, a light pepperiness and earthy hops. Yeast is in the mix. Ends a bit dry with a fruity notes and spice. Lighter, crisp and clean mouthfeel and it is quite refreshing. Very drinkable stuff. Something I could have a few bottles of.","meathookjones","Jan 24, 2005"
3.93,-2.7,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours a pretty, honeyed gold, topped with a healthy white froth. Nice and hazy with the yeast pour. Sticky rings of lace. The aroma conveys a rich malty fruitiness, sticky with cidery sweetness. Plenty of pepper and solventy phenols. Dry, woody, floral hopping adds a rustic undertone. The flavor opens with an interesting, spiced sweetness. Perhaps some cinnamon? Tons of fruit, showcasing apple and melon sweetness. Toasty malt eases into the finish, meeting a strong phenolic burst of clove and plastic. A bit of peppery spiciness, probably from the yeast. Rather dry in the finish, with plenty of spicy tang and a bit of saccharine metallic phenol notes. Mild hop bitterness, mostly woody, with some floral notes. Rather dry in the finish, with a phenolic aftertaste that makes itself at home on the tongue. Good stuff. Something like a cross between a tripel and a saison. I seriously enjoyed trying this.

4.62,14.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Slightly hazy orange. White, soft, sticky head boasts more than honest lacing. Never heard of aroma, cedar juice. What are those hops? They feel german in a way.. theyre a pure pleasure, a treasure. Very woody, subtle, elegant. Sprucey orange juice uncovers a spicy medley and a shot of vanilla. Minty, musty, earthy. Enjoyable belgian yeast, dry (pencil shavings) and bready. Original leafiness lasts and lasts in a straw-like bitterness, sandy and earthy. Yum. Incredibly mellow palate, superb carbonation, soft medium body. Unique and tasty, Jolly Pumpkin has become in no time a serious rival to any farmhouse beers producer and trying those beers is mandatory for any amateur of the genre, a complement to beer culture.","Rastacouere","Jan 14, 2005"

4.45,10.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a frothy 1 1/4" slightly off-white head over the murky light amber brew. Head lasts well, leaving delicate, if not substantial, lacing throughout the drinking experience. Aroma is spicy and lightly tart fruits, with some oak notes apparent. Taste is upfront the fruity tartness, quickly fading into the spicy malt character, and ending with a building magnitude of barrel notes that multiply this brew's complexity many times. Mouthfeel is a bit busy, and could deter one, perhaps, but the drinkability of this brew is excellent. An enjoyable entry to the world of Jolly Pumpkin.","ppoitras","Dec 29, 2004"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Despite all I have said, this is currently lacking that certain... something, that would put this over the top, but given Jolly Pumpkins stated goals and practices, I have a feeling that this will become more complex and challenging (this is definitely a good thing) over time. And please don't let my statement make you think that this beer is not superb, this is a beer that demands to be contemplated, quite the tasting brew, and I am enjoying the complexity that is inherent in this tasty brew.

Aroma is slightly musty with a hint of caramel and a spicy hop note. Flavor is odd. Very spicy with a cedary finish. Malt is present but not pronounced. Piney and grassy hop flavors mix with the spiciness and provide a complex taste if not a very enjoyable one. Mouthfeel is quite good except for an oily sensation I generally find in very hoppy beer, not quite appropriate for this one. Carbonation is full and lightens an otherwise moderate body. If not for the queer taste I would consider it a very drinkable beer. If you like the taste this beer would be a gem.","Sixpack595","Nov 11, 2004"
