"Reviewed from tasting notes. A spicy, malty orange nose with a little Belgian barnyard and a suspicion of smoke. Pours hazy gold with a thin white head that produces good lace. On the palate, citrus and melon, rich malts, over ripe fruit and moderate bitterness with long lingering slightly bittered malt after tastes. medium high carbonation, medium full body."
""
""
" The taste has a mild spice flavor up front with a tropical type dried fruity flavor with a woody dry earthy and  nutty malt taste with light sweetness after the swallow. This beer was one that just did not do it for me in overall enjoyment -not the belgian style I was looking for perhaps -not bad but nothing about it stands out, worth a try I guess."

"The funk threw me off at first but grew on me by about hallway through the glass. Spices are quite prevalent, low alcohol is kinda nice as there is no boozey taste whatsoever. Good for what it is."
""
"Pretty good tasting ale..I would buy again."

"O: Overall dry spicy belgian pale with the warmth and alcohol contention of a tripel. good try."

"Finally, a good Belgian under 8%"

"Overall- This being my first beer in the Belgian style realm, i liked it a lot. It's not that heavy of a beer and very drinkable. That being said, it isn't too complex, which I believe makes it good for those who want to get into Belgian style ales."

"Got to try on tap fresh from the brewery the other day and I thought it was very nice. The appearance was a hazy yellow with a decent head. The smell had a lot of wheat and banana to it. The taste was similar with great notes of banana, and even a little bit of spice. The feel of the beer was a little light but refreshing in the heat. Would definitely get again."

"A little bit of a miss here from CL."

"O-Overall a fairly good version of a Belgium pale ale. Could drink all day along on hot day."

"All in all a decent beer, nice to find another Belgian style ale that I can go to."

"My pour created a finger of dense, bone-white head with great retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly-hazy golden-yellow (SRM = 4) and it should be of no surprise to anyone that Midas, Mammon and Croesus were champing at the bit to try some. The nose had a yeasty mustiness to it that created a cheesy, slightly flowery/perfume-like scent. Mouthfeel was slightly full, thanks to a huge effervescence. The taste was slightly sweet, absolutely driven by the yeast, kind of fruity, kind of perfume-y. The bottle mentioned spice, but it was difficult to parse where the spice began and the yeast ended. Was the addition of spice a case of gilding the lily? Overall, it was a decent beer, but it was not mind blowing. The finish was semi-dry and I was again wondering whether this was a by-product of the yeast, the spice or both."
""
""
"The aroma and taste of this beer make this a beer a really nice sensory experience. As a pale ale the ABV is not as strong as a double or tripel style Belgian so its a bit more easygoing. That said, its so full of flavor that I tend to sip rather than guzzle this relatively light bodied brew."

"Captain Lawrence Brewing Company Liquid Gold (2013) - 6% ABV. Very good head foaming. Solid lacing. Highly active carbonation. Brilliant golden color paled and hazy. Citrus aromas. Lemons, oranges, and passion fruit. Crisp mouthfeel. Full citrus nose with oranges and lemons. Some wheat and barley. Good crisp mouthfeel. Not too dry, not too wet. Just right. Passion fruit, kiwi, and wheat mid-palate. Lager hops subtle but solid in the background. Creamy orange juice and grass on the back palate. A little more hops. Grains of passion and Belgian yeast. Aftertaste is clean and crisp. Lingering lemon drops and Skittles. Malt and citrus. Insanely well balanced for a Belgian fruit beer. Most of the breweries try to overdo the fruit notes making it into girly drinks or liquid candy. Headaches in a bottle if you will. But this is a more serious Saisson varietal homage. A true session farm beer. Very well done. Still a beer and highly drinkable. 3.6 out of 5. Very good."
"Pours a hazy gold with a small white head. Good retention and little lacing. Fruity aroma - mango, peach, citrus, with faint floral notes. Flavor follows nose, lots of fruit up front. Not much in the way of bitterness. Finishes dry. Light to medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall, a decent drinkable Belgian-style pale."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of Belgian yeast, pale malt, banana and spices. Body is full and crisp. Biscuit malt, herbal hops, spicy yeast and banana fill the mouth. Finish is long and bitter. Overall it is tasty brew."
"Overall – A decent Belgian Pale ale with a bit more grass and grain and a bit less banana and spice then the typical. Overall it is a bit drier in nature and a rather nice Belgian Pale ale to give a go too."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a huge fluffy white head that persists forever. Aromas of banana and clove with a hint of pepper, sweet sugary malt and a hint of citrus. The flavor follows the aroma. Yeasty bready sweet citrus clove and banana with a hint of earthy tartness that I wasn't expecting. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick bubbly mouthfeel. Decent brew but nothing horribly exciting."
""
""
"This bottle has quite a bit of age on it. Had it fresh and loved it. This happens to be a bottle i had sitting in my fridge for a while.crystal clear golden color a finger of white head. Nice sweet belgian scented nose, banana and clove, still some earthy hop presence. For being pretty old, pretty clean still. Sweet malt, prickly carbonation, fluffy light-medium bodied. Belgian yeasty nuance, just enough hop to balance things, faint lingering bitterness with some lingering sweetness and a touch of alcohol probably from the age, Still drinks really great."

"Back to Liquid Gold.. got a happy buzz, can't deny its the magic in beer talking now"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The spices bring a fun and fascinating twist to this BPA, although they seem slightly out of place in the absence of hops. In the end, however, this is a tasty, enjoyable beer that I would never pass up."
""
""
""
"O: Liquid Gold is a solid and then some Belgian pale ale with a good balance of yeast, hops, and malt character to provide an interesting brew."
""
""
"Amazing light beer - served 9oz at Victorie in Rochester, NY. Great mouthfeel and can't say enough about how beautiful the head is in the sunlight - the attention to detail with the apple subtleties is striking in a good way. I loved this beer - please try it if you can find a good tap!"

"Pours hazy yellow with a small head of foam the fell fast and left a thin ring. Starts with some soapy lace but that disappears. Nose is plenty of yeast, banana, clove, pepper, bubblegum, hay and lemon. A nice touch of lemon all around and all over in fact. I really like this. Malt is caramel and bread. Taste is sweet malt with lots of dough and caramel and hops follow the nose all the way. Bubblegum, floral, banana, sweetly juicy with orange and lemon citrus that isn’t sour or tart, and a little pepper to take it into a sweet finish . No real aftertaste, very light body, almost thin with a little carbonation to gently remind you this is beer. Pretty nice."

"Overall, a beer that I will not revisit again. It is only a difference in opinion here, but the herbs and spices that they used are a bit overdone, and the yeasty quality, hops and malts are lost underneath them."
""
"On tap at the Blue Monk. A lighter Belgian ale. Pours deep yellow to golden colour with a minimum head. Carbonation bubbles. Yeast is the characteristic, as it warms I can distinguish a tad of funk, spiciness featuring clove. True to style, but Something needed to distinguish itself in this style?"

"O: Very, very nice beer. Already planning on a six of this in the summer. Can't wait. Why'd they filter it? Only real ding against this beer."
""

"Pours a fairly thin head of bone white, mostly tiny bubbles which dissolve off swiftly, the lacing likewise close to nonexistent. The liquid is a shimmeringly bright yellow, fully transparent, only a few bubble beads but these are highly active. Very expressive nose of banana, strawberry, apple fruit, clove and cinnamon, bubblegum and all kinds of general yeastiness, undercurrent of powdered milk chocolate, here too it is pure and unblemished, preferring a spring to its step than grounding itself firmly. Light to medium-bodied, fluid with a sort of metallic ring to it at first which makes the attack somewhat bitter. The carbonation churns steadily and agitates more than let’s the underlying creaminess take hold. White pepper and lemon peel beat the clove, nutmeg, allspice to the punch. Eventually turns more resinous in feel which brings out more yellow apple, peach, banana, melon fruit. That cocoa maltiness persists. A lot going on retronasally. Lower yeast presence, more unbaked dough than bread or scone, etc. and certainly outpaced by the grassy nip. Overall, it’s pleasing to quaff, guileless and simple to the verge of innocence. You’d lose interest after a couple of dates."
""
"Pours clear see through golden hued. Very little foam remains. Belgian yeast strain nose. Light fruit. Taste is smooth, yet bitter. Firm hoppiness throughout but balanced into the mix. Firm carbonation in the mixture. This is a good beer. Deceptively simple."
""
""
""
"Not a lot of flavor coming through. I just don't pick up the Belgian in this one."
""
""
""
"Clear pale golden with no head. The nose is pure bubblegum with a hint of hops and artificial smelling fruity esters. The taste has a honey sweetness and of course bubblegum, some white grape. This is a beer that definitely improves as it warms. The mouthfeel is light bodied and drinkable, slightly bitter with a honey sweetness. This beer was a bit of a disappointment and drinks like a strangely flavored lager."

"Overall another tasty Captain Lawrence, been impressed with everything from them so far. Recommended to any belgian fans."
"O: A pleasant and crisp beer for those looking for a lighter version of your favorite Belgian Ale. Not risking much, but hitting the mark where it tries, I'd say give it a whirl and don't expect the world."
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good example of a BPA. Crisp and refreshing but the mustiness is throwing me off."
""
""
""
""

"This brew is out of balance and could use refining. Recommended, but not over the top. Glad I tired it, but I believe CL would do better on their next brew.."

"A most impressive American-made Belgian Pale Ale that soars above many others in its complexity and subtleties. I so badly wish I had at least one more of these to enjoy when this one's finally kicked the bucket."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer isn't that difficult to drink and has a nice mixture of Belgian yeast and fruit flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice beer, blending the better bits of witbier, saison, and belgian pale. Glad I got a chance to try this one."
"Actually quite an excellent crack at a Belgian-style ale. Poured a clearish golden-yellow color with a small wispy white head that receded to a ringlet, leaving a few wayward streaks of lacing on the glass. Smell was loaded with Belgian goodness, yeasty, spicy, floral. Taste is simliar, bready, yeasty, notes of banana and stone fruit, peppery spice, floral hops, sweet honeyish malts...lots of flavor here. About medium in body, smooth, well-balanced, well-flavored, quite drinkable."
""
""
"O- Very pleasureable ale and very drinkable. I look forward to my next one. The most pleasantly drinkable Belgian ale I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is certainly not a ""typical"" Belgian Pale, but the style is certainly very variable... This is a nice combination of Belgian yeast and what tastes like American hops. Nothing dominates, as this is nicely balanced, and it's very drinkable. Greater than the sum of its parts, and I'm glad I had a chance to try this."
"Bottle beer recently introduced, much better than many highly ranked competitors. Beer has excellent aroma, clarity, and overall taste performance. New bottle design and sale of beer in grocery stores is a huge plus since had to go to brewery in the past to get this beer."
"O/D-All of Captain Lawrence's six-pack line are exceptionally well crafted but they do not crack the 'Awesome!' stratosphere. This actually is my least favorite of the group. Its a nice little Belgian-inspired brew. Its the epitome of 'good but not great'."
""
"Overall: an interesting Belgian style ale. I find it is more like a French saison, so ... perhaps it's a Franco-Belgian ale? In any case it is quite good."
"for a blonde ale this is pretty fantastic! feels a bit heavier than most but goes down so easy it's like drinking... wait for it.. LIQUID GOLD!"
""
""
""
"Drink- It was a nice little beer. The ABV sat about right but was more prevalant when the beer warmed."
"M&D - lively, effervescent on the tongue, the yeasty/spicy-ness will offer a lot of flavor to those who enjoy craft beer but are turned off by big hoppy bitterness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not very impressive. Seems kind of like a mess as its overtly sweet. It just leaves a really long and lasting syrupy sweetness that gets nauseating really quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice and refreshing, but I prefer their kolsch as a summer beer. Would like to try this a little fresher."
""
"O-If the palate could have lived up to the nose this beer would be phenomenal."
""
"When I took my first sniff I thought I'd be drain-pouring this one. However it's flavor, and mouthfeel were pretty decent."
""
"O - I have always liked this beer. The first time I had it was at the brewery itself. My first reaction was ""wow, more than just a hint of banana"" (and I loved it!). I've never gotten the taste of banana since then (but I was also in the hot sun, drinking other CL brews, and eating some very good BBQ. So who know's how that may have played on my palate?). However, there is a lot going on here, bit yet it is very refreshing."
""
""
""
"O: A delicious American take on the style. I gotta try more Captain Lawrence, the beers I've had from them have been outstanding."
""
""
"This is a flavorful BPA but it has too much coriander presence for my liking. I rather the yeast come through more."
""
"O - A good Belgian pale ale...lots of good yeast derived flavors, spicy and fruity...good balance. Good to see this in 12oz bottles now."
""
"Overall – Actually I enjoyed this and I’m not a huge Belgian beer fan. I like the almost over spiced quality and that this took precedent to the Belgian yeasts. The fruity esters and flavors were also quite nice. An enjoyable beer."
""
"o - overall not as magical as i remember but still quite good for an american take on a classic belgian style. worth checking out and i'm sure this won't the last 6'er of this that i pick up. glad they released this."
"Seems run of the mill for this style. Other better beers."
""
""
"O - Perfect beer to ring in the nice spring weather here. Good, but nothing I'd seek out."
""
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink. I would and could enjoy multiple of these in a session. I really like the white pepper hints in this beer a lot."
""
""
""
"Overall I do enjoy this beer, but...I feel it is a little too spicy for the style and the finish is a bit to long and not dry enough. It is almost more like a blond then a pale. Still it tastes good, just not as ""to style"" as I like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): Very nice, straightforward Belgian pale ale. Others aiming for this style should use this as a reference point. Also, I think that this is one of those rare beers where you can really get a sense of what Belgian yeast does for beer, taking what would otherwise be a relatively plain, straightforward beer and making it a really winning BPA. Lovely beer, and I’ll be seeking this out in the future."
""
"O: a nice take on the style, not the best but definitly drinks smooth and bright with a nice clean finish"
"M: leaves mouth feeling dry. nice carbonation, light body. "

"Nags head in Huntington pouts this in a tulip glass. It pours with a creamy white one inch head. The name liquid gold comes from the color of the beer though it's not a clear beer. It is translucent but cloudy. On the nose you smell aromas of raisins, sweetness, & a hint of honey. Our first taste does not disappoint us with its complexity. A very malty flavor with a hint of bitterness that is very subdued but helps clear the sweetness. The beer is substantial but not full-bodied. A very good drinking beer."
""
"I remember trying this at the brewery the first time I went there but didn't get a growler fill. I kicked myself in the ass when I got home. Now that I got myself a growler fill, I'm glad I did but it tastes better on tap. The only problem with this brew is, the immediate taste is wow but then it begins to dull down a bit as the consumption continues. I would have given a higher rating. Otherwise a tasty solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This is a strange beer. Its almost a Belgian single/cream ale/English pale blend with a bucket-load of clove. I'll give it props, its original as hell and I certainly wouldn't mind having this in sixers."
"Pours a straw yellow color , slightly opaque, thick head that dissipates leaving nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Has a fruity nose with tones of yeast and spice. The flavor is bittersweet lemon citrus with a lot of spices and some malt, very well blended together, has a lingering sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light, despite the creamy head, not to carbonated either. A very unusual beer with a unique and excellent flavor."
"Serving type: on-tap/growler"
"Overall this beer is very good and enjoyable, I'm glad I didn't overlook it like I did yesterday and grabbed a growler for $15, which was a few ounces over the 64oz marker. I would purchase again. Cheers"
"If you're chugging this beer, then you are clearly a., drunk, and b., not paying for it."
"As a reviewer, this made me question whether I should grade it worse because this shouldn't be called as a pale type. I liked it, so it received good grades."
"O) A decent brew. I might have another one."
"overall a sublimly light and clean sessionable ale"
"O: Pretty good, nice Belgian golden malts, bit of yeast on the nose doesn't help, nice light hop flavors, and nice Belgian flavors overall."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a good white head that sticks around for awhile and then leaves some lacing on the glass. The nose is slightly sweet with some bready malt and also a bit of banana and clove. Yeasty spice is mild, but present. Flavor again is pretty good, but doesn't really do it for me. Mild fruit and bread. The body detracts from the taste, as it's really too full and a bit too sweet. I'd like this one thinner and dryer. Pretty good, but didn't live up to my expectations."
"D- so if this is only the beginning... Where will captain lawrence take us next? This is a great thirst quenching bpa. The ""hybrid"" approach with styles makes this an incredible taste experience. I will be coming back for more!"
"overall, i enjoyed it. went very well with my bacon bbq burger. i would definitely try again, i feel like having it a second time would enable me to dive deeper into the beer and pick out more distinct flavors."
"D - Extremely drinkable. The fruit flavors are very refreshing and well balanced. Very nice flavor and feel."
"Drinkability- this beer paired excellently with my steak sandwich in nyc and was extremely enjoyable overall, even though this is a beer I am unable to get a hold of in my area it did spark my interest in trying more from this brewery when I have the opportunity again as this was quite a well made belgian style ale"
"D-tasty and easy to drink. balanced and enjoyable. not a huge fan of the yeast strand and would like a drier finish but still tasty."
"This is a BPA I really like. It has the look, aroma, and smell I look for in the style. It's got a good golden color, but the head isn't quite as tall as I had hoped. Retention was good as was lacing. Smells just as expected, spicy and earthy yeast with the obvious malt aroma. Has plenty of that spice come forth--cloves, pepper, and even coriander come to mind. Medium body and decent drinkability overall."
"D: Probably my favorite beer of the day. I was able to take it home in a growler, so hopefully it holds up for a day or two!"
"drinkability: high"
"This is a very solid and drinkable offering from Captain Lawrence."
"Served: at Rattle 'N Hum"
"I enjoyed this on-tap at Trinity Grill and Bar. I believe I'd had it at Waterfront Ale House before, or perhaps just heard good things about it. I found it to be so delicious as to be elevated above most of the beers I've ever had. It was golden-brown, and quickly gone."
"d - A pretty good Belgian style beer. Some nice banana in the smell and taste. Would try again."
"Drinkability: All day and all night!"
"As I watched the guy behind the bar pull this from the tap, my heart leapt when I saw he stopped when there was a two-inch head on the beer. Then my heart sank as he resumed pouring, letting the head run down the glass until there was about half an inch left. Sheesh. So much for aroma. What I could detect was rather wheat-beerish: some cloves and bananas, maybe some lemons. Decent light-amber color, too. Very nice taste, with spicy oranges and other citrus ambling arm-in-arm with light bananas and some hay. Lemons came to the fore, especially in the aftertaste. Lightly carbonated with zing, not sting. This was a nice find on the AAH list, and I would definitely have another. Of the American BPAs I've had, this was by far the most drinkable: not overly bitter or ham-fistedly hopped, but nicely balanced and quite drinkable."
"Very easy drinking, with a dry finish."
"D: I love this beer. I have some great memories associated with it. It is a really great example of the style. Just drinks like a champ in the summer. Only got this because they were out of the DIPA but this beer is a winner."
"I had the opportunity to have this on draft immediately after the Freshchester and, although it's not as good as the pale ale, it is interesting and has very accessible belgian qualities that could be a good gateway for some. The color is also an interesting cloudy peach that i enjoyed this time."
"Liquid Gold must be drinkable because I finished the growler myself. I wouldn't reach for it for a refreshing, summer day beer as it does have some strength, and the yeasty nose got tiring towards the end. Still, I'd like to get another fill of this soon."
"Growler from Brewery: This one pours a clear, golden yellow color. There was a bit of a white head on it that dies off rather quickly. It leaves a little lacing. Grassy, citrusy and spicy aroma. The taste is a touch light. Slightly spicy (coriander) to the taste. Some malts and extremely faint hops. Just a very nice, lighter beer."
"Aromas are of belgian yeasty spiciness, lemon rind and bready malt. I could say lemon pepper but that might be pushing it, as Nick noted. A whisper of some herbal/grassy hops. The taste has some residual sugar but is mostly composed of prominent yeast character contributing this prominent spiciness and floral component over some graininess. A nice moderate level of carbonation hits the tongue and creates a certain crispness to this brew. Pretty approachable and a solid offering, I will continue to fill up my growler with this brew to share with friends in the summer months."
"Had no idea what I was getting when I tried this one, actually thought it was an IPA at first because of the great hoppy flavor, but realised that it was so much more after a few sips. Really smooth and complex flavor with an excellent aroma and delicate head."
"draft at Bierria Paradiso, DC"
"O: very drinkable and nice."
"D: It's a little too sweet to be an every day beer for me, but it's complex and solid."
"The Pony Bar, Manhattan: poured a nice semi-hazy gold into an American pint glass, with a very thin white head, but decent lacing. The aroma was fairly standard mix for a Belgian golden beer; banana, clove, and allspice. The taste was a much more magnified version of the aroma, with also a hint of lemon and grains of paradise. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but since this was packed with flavor, I'd certainly be open to sessioning this beer. Well done."
"Drinkability: A solid, fresh, and tasty version of a BPA. Good flavors and highly sessionable. I'd like to get some more."
"Happy Thanksgiving."
"D: Goes down easy and very enjoyable. This is a great summer beer to sip on these last warm days."
"Notes: Very good,but too sweet to have more than one. I am not saying it is a sugar bomb,but a bit different than some others I have tried. All in all an easy beer to drink."
"Notes: Eminently drinkable Belgian pale; nothing amazing, but no complaints whatsoever; definitely the tastiest beer available by the half-yard at Richter's."
"D: Cpt. Lawrence is a good brewery, so I won't knock the goods, but I wasn't overly impressed with Liquid Gold. It's an interesting, semi-tasty brew for an American version of the style, but I wouldn't agree that it's the best representation of it out there. Give it a shot and see for yourself."
"Found this happily at Rosie Tomorrow's in Danbury, CT on tap and poured cold into a pint glass. This is a hazy yellow/gold color with a modest white cover with good lacing. The aroma is pleasant clove and light lemon bread. Nothing real provoking, suggesting a Belgian style. The flavor brings a strong herbal hop married to heavy clove. This is a pretty heavy constitution, spicey, tangy with a dry hop finish at the tip of the tongue. Just a slight overtone of bubblegum that gives way to biscuit wheat grain goodness. Fairly drinkable depending upon your partiality for the style. Not really my favorite though they seem to have come up with something that is a slight compromise to those of us that don't feast regularly on the Belgian faire. All in all, pretty impressive."
"T- Good bitter beer. But it's balanced well with malty undertones to it. The spice is really good, peppery (?)."
"Drinkability is excellent. The refreshing nature and clear wonderful flavor of this marvelous brew make it superbly quaffable."
"D- Low in ABV, the growler was easy to finish although I could of used some help & I love to share. I Just wish there was more to this. Im going to try the xtra gold and see what that has to offer."
"D- This is a great brew. Easy to drink, I love the frutiness to it. I think of Stone VE 08 with the fruity characters. Excellant job."
"Drinkability is good. The yeast was a bit dominating when I tried it, but it's still a better than average beer by all accounts. Nicely done."
"Overall, a very interesting brew but accessible and nicely drinkable. Great stuff, and highly recommended."
"D: What a nice beer! Poured on 3/21, FedEx'd to me, and enjoyed on 3/25 with nary a hint of oxidation. Thanks Joe!"
"Looking forward to more indeed."
"on tap from rattle and Hum NY. not sure what to think of this one. A slightly cloudy light yellow color. Absolutely no head whatsoever, may have been pour, not sure. Very active carbonation though. Very slight smell of hops. Thick consistency to taste, almost syruplike. Malty sweet with a little hops bitterness in the finish. Not terrible, but not my favorite either."
"D: Very drinkable beer, I liked this one a lot as all the flavors blended together very well."
"D: Def. a session beer, like hoegaarden with some muscles. Easy drinking, would love to pair this with some food"
"i just bought this on tap at the great bobbique in patchouge . it looked gold like a miller high life but boy it aint no light lager . the place has a great beer list but i stuck with this . just so tasty and real drinkablility f@@#%k you bud light you couldnt taste this good unless you put a 20 in every bottle . seek this stuff out"
"Great Job Captain Lawrence!"
"Another update 8/6/08: Another growler from Big Z (I can't get enough of this beer!). Got a lot of melon (melon rind, honeydew, cantelope) from this one. As well as more citrus. This beer has become my ultimate session beer; it is that awesome. In fairness to this exquisite brew, I must bump its rating yet again. 8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Notes from 11/29/07"
"Oh, and by the way, this growler has been in my cellar for just over a month. Scott Vaccaro has done the world of beer a huge service with this one. Thank You!"
"D- The spice is a little strong, making it a bit of a sipper in spite of its nice light appearance."

"Been in NYC all weekend and just have really been digging this beer. So fruity and glyceryl on the palate. Floral, spicey, belgian yeasty as hell. Usually I don't like an over the top belgian yeast and spicey brew but this one has something different to it. Love the character and refreshing quality this beer contains. Flavors are what the nose suggested. A great summer beer."
"Overall- A good spicy sipper. refreshing yet full of flavor. Another good warm afternoon beer!"
"D_This is always nice to have on tap and is probably the most common of the Captain's offerings around NYC."
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Mrbendo kicks ass!"
"D: A bit high on the ABV for a session beer but the carbonation keeps it light enough on the tongue to foll you into thinking it could be a session beer."
"D- Some may say this is a bit high ABV for a session beer but I think the flavor is that of a god session. Very drinkable glass after glass!"
"Pours a clear gold with some head. Nose is nice and sweet. Flavor is equally as good being consistently sweet and never dropping off to anything sour, metallic, or negative at all. Feel is nice and smooth on the liquid with a bit of a thicker touch. Right level of bubble. Extremely drinkable. I kind of feel like this beer could be a gateway beer for people who are wary of Belgian brews. It is also my first trip into the world of Captain Lawrence, and I want more. Beautiful."
"D-Tongue feels really dry after two, probably from the carbonation, but I'm prolly going to finish this growler after this. :) I'd drink it again fresh or from the bottle to compare. Not a bad beverage."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, easy drinking, mildly estery, and based in a light drinking Belgian brew. I hardly noticed the 6% abv. Went down nicely."
"Pours an ultra light yellow color with less than a finger white head that fades quickly. Nice lattice lacing. This ale has less color than any beer that i have ever experienced...including Mich-Ultra. The smell is aggressive and classic Belgian yeast, spicy coriander and pepper. Light bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated and complemented by a nice hop character. Full flavored, the taste is lightly sweet, lemony and earthy yeast. Finishes slightly dry with a lingering spiciness that is appropriate. Quite drinkable and at 6% ABV its on for this session."
"Edit: Going up & down with every batch, the jug I had before last(February) was exceptionally juicy & mildly carbonated, while this recent tasting(April) was much bigger in the hop department & similar in acidity to my original review. A 4.3 & 3.65 if I wanted to jot down some ratings here."
"Poured from a growler that was acquired by a good friend a couple of days before sampling. Slightly phenolic aromas mixed in with soft malt aromas, light carbonation kicked up a whisper of foam when poured. Super light color reminiscent of a massed produced german lager. Up front clove and cinnamon flavors dominated which were overtaken by biscuity malt flavor on the backend and cleaned out by hop dryness. Didn't get any belgian aspects to the alcohol flavors except phenolics - no fruity esters or spicy alcohol which makes me wonder if a belgian yeast strain was used at all. Not very drinkable to me due to the phenolic character dominating the flavor profile."
"Very good. Easy to drink and most enjoyable on a hot Baltimore summer evening."
"M/D- this is the first time I have actually really felt that a belgian could be a response to a pils...Although heavier in the body than a pils. This is a great beer, and for the alcohol (although not too high) very light."
"Update: Went back for seconds and it pretty much tasted the same."
"Not sure why, but I mistook this for CL's tripel at first. The body was thick enough, though the flavor was a little mellow for a big abv beer. I guess that makes a good belgian pale with some body to it. The flavor was subtle and the kind that went on far through the aftertaste. The aroma was Hennepin-like with funky barnyard aromas and grassy hops. The taste started with a clean, sweet candi flavor, followed by a complex mix of spice, make that hot spice, with some pale grains coming through at the end. Finishing with a nice lingering bitterness. This is a well-made beer. Go forth and drink it."
"Overall an enjoyable and tasty ale. I would not have guessed it was a BPA though."
"Very impressed with the Captain, as usual. I have had this one multiple times so it is quite nice to sit down a review it and still be amazed. These Belgian Pale Ales / Golden Ales are a real favorite of mine and this stands up ...."
"Drinkability: superb. Easy to quaff, great flavor, and clear session beer. This is a beer worth seeeking out. Glad to see this in NJ."
" A very well made beer and an interesting take on the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head recedes at a moderate pace, never really goes away, with a heavy coating of white lace. Aroma is light of sweet and spicy, not overdone, just right. Taste follows the nose, finding a nicely balanced road through the center of the Belgian-style pale neighborhood. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent, very smooth, and one of the most drinkable of the style that I have experienced."
"A very good Belgian style ale ! Had a couple on tap...would definitely order this one again."
"Notes: Very similar to Sixpoint's Sweet Action - which I prefer slightly. Still, another fine offering from this brewery."
"Very nice! Liquid Gold is not over-done like so many others. Superbly balanced and quite drinkable!"
"From a brand new brewery, all I can say is this is a great start - if better is to come then we'll be spoiled rotten..."
"can't wait to try the Pleasantville Smoked Porter!!!"
"Fresh growler, picked up at the brewery today. Pours light golden almost clear with a slight but long lasting tiny bubble white head, leaves minor splotchy lacing after a vigorous swirl. Nose is of limes, pepper and Belgian yeast. This is an easy drinking, Belgian single/golden inspired ale. Notes of more citrus, especially lime, quinine and pepper. Crisp and refreshing, packs a punch at 6%. Moderate hops till a subtle dryness arrives in the finish. A delicate, complex, and well crafted ale from the newest player in the NY craft beer scene. Looking foward to trying other styles from Capt. L.!"
