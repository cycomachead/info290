I'm not a huge fan of Belgian ales in general but beers like Leffe prove that it is possible to appreciate any style. The nuances in Leffe's flavor make all the difference. Would I drink it again? Sure.","JamesMN","Dec 14, 2014"

Ultimately however, it did not have much bite to it. A pretty plain beer and nothing special. I first had this beer in Brussels of all places many years ago and thought I was being worldly. Sadly, this was before I got into craft beer. When I think back on all the amazing Belgian beers I could have enjoyed on this trip, I kick myself.","Gajo74","Dec 11, 2014"

Still, the second glass is a lot nicer than the first, which I put down to the strength numbing the taste buds, so if you plan on drinking this over a day it is not completely awful. It is well spiced and probably a good example of the style but it is not to my liking. Sorry to the people at Leffe!","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 11, 2014"
3,-15.5,,,,,,"This is a drinkable but not outstanding beer and as a lighter beer is susceptible to handling issues. When fresh, a decent alternative to industrial lager. When old, which is often, it picks up wet cardboard flavors which dull the fruits.","pat61","Sep 11, 2014"

The colour is amazing, is darket than a regular lager, is thick that's present. Taste delicious, very malty, honey straight away, sweet some lemon aftertaste, I can't describe that amount of shapes and surfaces on a drink. I makes me, I don't need more, maybe an hamder average but it stills ok is 6.6% wowww. Very drinkable beer with the propper belgian flavour and carbonation, never say no to this trendy choice!!!

Aromas of bready sweet pilsner with a touch of floral hops and a solid shot of pepper and yeasty esters. The flavor is rich and sweet with hints of orange and sweet bread. Peppery yeasty with a bit of spice rounds out the flavor quite nicely. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a spicy bubbly mouthfeel. That is a pretty nice Belgian right there, I'm surprised I haven't tried this before.","johnnnniee","Jul 11, 2014"

3.78,6.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/17/2015. Pours lightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange peel, pear, apple, banana, honey, biscuit, bubblegum, herbal, floral, clove, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange peel, pear, apple, banana, honey, biscuit, bubblegum, clove, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Light amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange peel, pear, apple, banana, honey, biscuit, bubblegum, clove, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of pale malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great yeast/malt flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian pale ale. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of pale male and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 30, 2014"

3.69,3.9,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. I was initially greeted by a massive amount of light beige head threatening to billow over the top of the glass, although this settled down quickly to reveal a dark gold liquid with light bronze highlights. Smells buttery, nutty, with some low-key Belgian yeast spice and vinous fruit top notes. Less assertive aroma than other Belgians but has the right characteristics, with some saison and tripel like features although more mellow than either. Palate is quite sweet, light, and fruity, again with middling spicy phenols and heavy carbonation. I get sweet shortbread and butterscotch coupled with faint carbolic wine, orange or perhaps unripe peach or apricot, banana, pear, and a decent dose of subtly minty, grassy, palate-cleansing hops. The bubble gum taste that others detect isn't up front to me, although I do start to notice this effect later as the fruit flavors start to meld together. Thin-bodied and moderately boozy. This would make a great ""starter Belgian"" or introduction to the style for beginners. While it is less bold in flavor than many, there's enough complexity and Belgian yeast character to adequately convey the style and provide an enjoyable experience.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 01, 2014"

This was before I had investigated many styles and was even willing to try some beers. Upon a second reflection and reevaluating this beer, I come to recognize that it is still a very tasty beer, just not as good as good as others in the style I think it's the overall sweetness of the beer and lack of counterbalancing that creates this effect. However, if you're looking for beers to offer to friends to try to get them to expand their horizons this might be an option.","DenisKolkin","Jul 12, 2013"

Malty sweetness on the tongue with Belgian yeast and a tad of booziness. A little bit of a smoky, woodsiness in the middle. Quick bitterness on the back and dry to slightly sweet aftertaste. Lacks the level of bitterness of other Belgian blonds like Duvel or Piraat. Light to medium mouthfeel and fairly carbonated. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.","jgurley","May 05, 2013"

One of ""The Brothers"" has this beer rated at a 2.2. That is worse than Budweiser. I find that ludicrous.","tastybeerinmybelly","Dec 26, 2012"

This isn't my favorite BPA it lacks that Belgian yeast/funk flavor and its slightly too sweet for my taste. This could be due possibly to the fact that it's brewed with corn.

I have no idea why this is classified as a ""Pale Ale"" as there's nothing pale about this full-bodied beauty. Pours a nice golden hue into a Duvel tulip-glass. A bit heady which dies down much too quickly with light lacing. Smell is tart, bright and slightly clovey like a German Weizenbock. Mouthfeel is mellow carbonation and no trace of alcohol even though it's 6.6% alcohol. Tastes slightly sweet with a nice interplay of sweet yeasts against tart hops, leaning more sweet at first sip, almost like it's a Weissbeer with identify problems. Finish is smooth and you can't wait to take another sip. Now that Leffe is distributed everywhere these days (even my local WalMart has it), it's a great value for those seeking a nice, slightly-complex golden Belgian on the cheap.","Bayern1971","Sep 18, 2012"

3.78,6.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall I thought this was a goof beer and an above average example of the style, it was full of flavor with the Belgian yeast really dominating all aspects of this brew. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but the higher amount of sweetness and stickyness would prevent me from having a bunch, three in a sitting is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was it's appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good with lots of nice head and a pretty bold aroma. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness and the slightly sticky mouthfeel, if the sweetness was a toned down a little it would for sure improve this beer. I would buy this beer again when looking for something cheap and flavorful but I don't think I will be keeping it in the fridge that often, I recommend giving it a try, it may make for a good gateway into the style. All in all I thought this was a good beer for what it was and it was a much better choice then all the other beer available at that store, this is one solid Belgian Blonde.","StoutHunter","Aug 26, 2012"

The aroma is quite good--very pronounced bubble gum. I like that. The initial taste is good. Very good fruit flavor--reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum. The aftertaste is the problem. It is definitely a little funky. I can't quite put my finger on it. It has a great fruity start, a pretty pleasant bite in the middle, then a funky aftertaste that brings to mind artificial sweetener. The aftertaste sticks around for quite a while, so it makes you forget the better aspects of the beer. It gets better as it warms up, but it still retains that peculiar, bitter, and slightly metallic aftertaste. I will try this beer a couple more times. Perhaps pairing it with some cheese will help.","enbotellabuey","Aug 07, 2012"

I am glad I bought this as a single, because while I could probably drink 6 of these, I could also easily find better beers to spend that money on. Due to the fact that Leffe Blonde is balanced, not complex, and has an agreeable flavour, I might actually recommend this to a newbie looking for a relatively easy-to-find BPA - but I wouldn't count on this stuff impressing a lot of seasoned BAs. In short - it's worth a try, but not something to go out of your way for.","thehyperduck","Jun 15, 2012"

It's very easygoing with a full, sweet and maltiness flavor with a light bitter to give it some more depth and balance. It's the sweetness that's leading though.

The aroma is light but pleasant, with a musty yeast character at first that gives way to a combination of light biscuity malts and some bright grassy/floral characteristics. The flavor is similarly a combination of biscuits, grass, and dried herbs. The medium body and light, fine carbonation let this one linger in the aftertaste longer than I'd prefer, though.

Excellent lacing and retention, but I typically prefer a more translucent bottle conditioned appearance. Unmistakable traditional Belgian smell. I could make out a bready malt aroma with hints of citrus, clove and spice. This ale has a well balanced complex taste full of citrus, spice and sweet malt with very low bitterness present. I really enjoyed the soft sweetness, and crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Medium to full bodied and very filling with medium carbonation. The finish is spicy and sweet. I could see how some might find it too sweet, but I really liked the variation on the style.","BryanRex","Jan 08, 2012"

I broke out my Leffe glass (yes, I really do have one) for the occasion. Once poured, the Leffe is a perfect golden color, with a very thick head to it. The classic Belgian aroma sweeps over you: yeasty cinnamon rolls and gumballs. You know what I am talking about. The flavor is the same, strong up front, not too sweet and fades to a dry finish. There is a lightness to the Leffe Blonde that belies its Belgian origin. A great entry point to the Belgian experience.","iSip","Dec 12, 2011"

It is definitely ""European"" in character but I don't think I would agree with the label's claim of it being ""Subtle""; it's smooth but certainly electrifies your tastes buds with the yeast and sweetness. It's still pretty light and refreshing though, especially when compared to other Belgian heavyweights.","MadeInOregon","Oct 16, 2011"

Carbonation is fairly high here and quite prickly to the point where it almost stings the tongue a little, med body, med weight.

This is especially impressive for such as a mass-produced InBev offering. But it's not all about the Belgian penchant for protein control that makes this a pretty good beer. The smell is classic Belgian as well, full of bubblegum and clove with a nice crystal malt backbone to work off of. Those yeast byproducts appear in the flavor as well with some evident hops presence and a nicely apparent nuttiness. The bitterness starts at the back of the mouth, but moves forward and reaches the tip of the tongue as the beer warms. The caramel in the nose turns to honey on the tongue and leaves the beer a bit sweet, really muddying the wash and leaving a mouthfeel that was not impressive. This one made a promise of a refreshing beer and fell short by turning up the sweetness. If they could dry this one out a little it would be really nice. As it is, it is decidedly NOT one of the best Belgian pales, but I still like it better than Stella Artois.","Naugros","May 07, 2011"

3.77,6.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the aroma and the kick at the very center of the flavor. The notes in the nose were not exclusive to the style, per se, but rather seemed to be included from a variety of different, but similar styles. If it had to be summed up, the aroma could be classified as the union of a Belgian Pale, a Weizenbock, and a Hefeweizen. The alcoholic, pepper-laden kick usually doesn't come in until the very end, or the aftertaste, but here it came early, for a nice surprise in the middle of the tasting. Otherwise, the beer looked decent, and was fairly simple and standard all around.","TheBrewo","Feb 27, 2011"

Definite sugar water and cotton candy are present, and there's a light hop character present as a mild bitterness. Spices appear mid-palate, and linger into the finish along with sugar.

While the pseudo-parchment label hints at an ""abbey ale," and has thinly veiled affectations of a true Belgian beer its mass produced qualities too easily shine through.

Clove, malts, and thin hops are the key sensations in the aroma, which is quite typical of a Belgian Abbey Ale like this. But it it not quite as pungent as some. The mouthfeel falls in the medium category with a likeable creaminess. The taste has all the right characteristics of clove, coriander, hops, and wheat typical of a Belgian Abbey ale.

But there's a lovely bouquet of bananas and yeast, and an attractive column of bubbles that rise rhythmically from the bottom of the glass. Not overpowering in taste, but a respectable amount of the flavors you expect from this style: bananas, bread (but not banana bread...), some citrus.

I am open-minded when it comes to trying new or exotic beer styles, but a ""clove-dominated"" beer is really not going to be on my repeat buy list. I'm not going to put down the beer, as it tasted fresh, very fresh, to be shipped all the way from Belgium and be sitting in the Supermarket for who knows how long.

A hint of cloves and coriander is also apparent. The taste is more spice from the yeast rather than fruity esters. Spicey finish as well. Light body with a nicely paired carbonation. A good pale ale.

It smelled sweet and malty and possible had some citrus notes. It seemed heavier on the malt and the hops were drowned out. Carbonation was present but not overpowering. The smell convinces you the taste will be smooth and on the sweeter side. This is not a heavy ale but its look is deceiving. It was filling but was an easy pint to finish.

Dulce de Leche provides a sweet bed for a drop of vanilla. A nice deep spice that counters the caramel syrup. Possibly a touch of bourbon? Take the advice and drink a tad under room temp to put the esters in full overdrive. A cold one brings out grape reminiscent of plum soda and the carbonation is a bit too sharp.

There is so much wrong with that concept. Anyways, this beer may get a bit of bad press because of the macro tarnishment, but it is still nice to see Belgians getting into hands of people even if it is in this way. Color is bright gold with a very nice airy white, soapy head that leaves very nice lacing along the edges of the glass. The body is extremely clear with no yeast sediment to be found. This was a bit too clean for me, but others may prefer it. Aroma is slightly floral with a biscuity profile and decent yeast presence. Taste is crisp when the beer is cold. As it warms, the sugars come through but are overtaken by a corn-like vegetal flavor. A bit grainy at the swallow and dry with a slightly synthetic feel. Not a bad beer and one that I would definitely get in a restaurant if faced with few options, but not what I would call truly Belgian. It bit too polished and clean.","ALESwhatCURESya","Mar 15, 2008"

The nose is rather mild, with sweet fruity notes, but nothing noteworhty. The flavor is mostly sweet malt with a touch of spices. No noticeable hop flavor. The finish is kinda syrupy sweet, not exactly to my liking. The mouthfeel is pretty average. As far as drinkability goes, I don't think I would want to have more than two.

On the palate, the spices continue to come through, though it has a nice firm malty, toasty flavor. The hops are evident in the finish with a slight bitter note; the floral sense presupposes Nobel varieties, maybe Saaz. A medium high carbonation delivers a nice fluffy, creamy mouthfeel, medium low body and a nice phenolic finish.

The nose is disappointing--a good deal of wheat comes forth but dominates. The taste is more complex than the smell indicates, thankfully. The wheat is still strong, but I also detect some orange and a faint honey taste, quite nice. I thought the carbonation might be overwhelming, but this wasn't the case.

On the palate, the sweetness is a bit overplayed and the yeast notes a bit cloying. What's pleasing are the spices, which build in the second half, and the hop bitterness in the finish.

Carmalized sugar and apricot with a solid malt base and a bit of alcoholic bit to hold back the sweet flavors.

A bleach white, bubbly foam with lace hanging on for dear life along the sides of the glass. Very clean appearance. Golden yellow with some carbonation. Aroma is loaded with bananas, both ripe and aged with notes of vanilla, coriander and camamille. The taste more or less reflects the nose. Bananas and vanilla rule the day with some citrusy wisps in the background. Only a whisper of alcohol in the finish accented by camamille. Moderate mouthfeel with continued light carbonation.

Stupid me thought it was actually the style of a blonde given the name. Not a fan of blondes and compared to that style I rather liked this one, though I thought it quite a bit off style. Coming here I find its a Belgian Pale Ale. Suddenly it all makes sense, and also Im suddenly less impressed with this beer.

A little ways down notes of unripe green banana, and fermented oranges, and vinous notes become more apparent.

Rich, clear golden color with massive, foamy head that lasted and lasted (and then laced the glass all the way down). The spicy clove/banana hops hits your nose immediately, but subtlely.

Here's a fabulously frothy (bigger bubbles) Belgian (ex-original Abby), with the qualities that I'm beginning to think are common for a Belgian Double or a French Farmhouse Ale. The appearance and smell are delightful. Smells of fruit and spring, like Saison Dupont, but the taste is heavier, more malty and less crisp than the smell would suggest. It's not a hugely complex taste that many Belgian's have, but in a blind taste test you could easily be fooled into thinking this was a much more expensive pour.

Green apple finish with a rough edgy belgian yeast character. Homey and lightly colored belgian candy sugar. Wet sweet carries thoughout, but seems lacking in some complexity. Dry finish and a bit more sharply carbonated that I would have expected. A malt wet sweet with a yeast funk edge. Md body that rolls into the mouth light.

Aromas of grains, yeast, and apricots seem to dominate. The taste is typical of this style with a fair amount of bitterness that is complemented by sweet fruity flavors. My biggest problem with this brew is it's unusual aftertaste that just lingers on and on. The aftertaste is a bit like swallowing a slightly stale loaf of bread; just not very appealing. The drinkability takes a hit because of this as well. I would rather follow this beer with a glass of water than to have another one.","jaluria","Dec 08, 2005"

It is very syrupy, almost tastes like robitussin. Not that it is all bad - i myself love tussin. Anyway, an adequate beer, but certainly not something I would go out and purchase. Very fruity and way too thick for the style. I would like something a bit more summery (not that that is really a word with any meaning, but anyway).

The flavor is equally crisp and slightly tart with a light touch of pepper and a hint of cinnamon. This is a fairly standard Belgian pale, but its a high standard. Its authenticity as an abbey ale however, is stifled by its contracted Interbrew origins.","RedDiamond","Dec 03, 2005"

Peppery spices, clove and sweet banana are dominant in the flavor, however there's a bit of metallic in the background that is not so pleasant and perhaps a bit plastic. Nice medium palate that finishes dry with crisp bubbly carbonation. Halfway through this and the metallic flavor has seemingly diminished quite a bit, though the plastic remains. While this brew has a couple of strong points, the weak points are dominating here, I don't think I'll be drinking this one again for a while. One thing I noticed here is that this brew isn't bottle conditioned, which seems to be pretty standard for the style.

It was different from the other great English draft ales that I had been drinking. Back in the USA, I noticed that it was available at Taco Mac in Atlanta. Fortunately I had to return to Europe on business this spring and got to drink Leffe Blonde at Heathrow Airport, Amsterdam, and best of all in Brugges (Belgium). There is an Irish pub next to the Crown Plaza there that had Leffe Blonde on tap and it was truly excellent. My associates and I sampled many different trappist ales while in Belgium, but Leffe Blonde was available in most bars and we loved it! Some people are voicing negative opinions about this beer because it is now being distributed internationally by a large cartel. If that enables me to enjoy it more often in Atlanta, then I can't view that as a bad thing. Try Leffe Brun-its even better!","rudyarmand","Jun 19, 2005"

Extremely clear with phenomenal styrofoam-white large-bubble head, that bubbles like soap lather and sticks stubbornly to the glass like thick plaster. The reason I enjoy the appearance so much is because of the hue of the liquid itself, rich and darker than many others. Though the smell is excellent, I was expecting more complexity, or perhaps I was anticipating more yeast. There is definite musky yeast, with the malt extraordinarily well balanced with it. Nuttiness in the smell, along with apples and peaches. The aroma could have more complexity, but it is very well balanced; i.e. it does not rely solely on yeast. It is much the same on the taste. You can sense the malt very well on the front of the tongue, and even some hop in the finish. Of course, the yeast still is the dominant force in the flavour, giving phenolic tastes and dry dusty fruits. There are indeed grassy hop feels on the finish. Very dry aftertaste. Gaseous carbonation, burning on the tongue, very akin to many other Belgians, and perhaps not so good as some. This is not the most complex Belgian beer I have tried, but it still tastes so much better than the best of some countries. It does not excel only when placed next to its country's own beers, and it still is one of the better beers out there in its own standard.","Cwrw","Jul 18, 2004"

I don't know if they use lots of cane sugar in the brewing process but whatever it is, it is overdone. For the first time in any of my reviews I will use the adjective ""cloying"" to describe it. Once the wave of sweetness passes you get some grapefruity citrus and the peppery spice, some rounded alcohol flavors and hints of honey. This is a bold tasting beer, it definitely asserts itself on your palette and is sticky in the finish. Problem is it's way too sweet and not nearly complex enough to pull it off.

Its a nice mix with some light hops, finishes pretty strong with a big fullness on the palate and some fruity dryness with peppery notes. The feel is well carbonated with a slightly small start but grabs hold quickly and becomes quite full with a nice subtle dry finish thats crisp and dulled of citrus and spice.

Close as I can describe it is a flat metallic taste, which I’ve experienced with a hop bitter in the aftertaste before, maybe the spices are covering it there. Perplexing. I better sample another 15-16 of these to figure it out. Will have to be in several sessions, this beer is filling and isn’t quite a session beer.

The carbonation of this brew seems to just go on and on, a very nice touch! Smells cool and crisp, perhaps a honey aroma in there? Taste is bold and hoppy, sweet and refreshing.

The start is smooth, with the malts and fruitiness coming forward first. Theres a mild hoppiness towards the end, with not much of an aftertaste, although some sweetness does linger a bit. Leffe seems to be a bit thin in the mouth unlike the suggestion on the back of the bottle that this is a full bodied beer. Carbonation is moderate on the tongue. Alcohol is completely hidden for the most part, but does become a bit more apparent as the beer warms.

Widely available at even the smallest dive bar in Belgium, so much so that I often find I heavily rely on a Leffe Blonde at 4am in the morning after a serious day on the beer. Despite the tendency to knock this beer for its mass-appeal, I will most certainly refrain from doing so. At the end of the day this is a Blonde Ale, it is no Westie 12, merely the equivalent of a session beer that happens to be produced by Interbrew. That said, it is still leagues ahead of most other Countries session beers IMHO. A decent, solid, Blonde beer that has enough restrained flavors to convert macro drinkers, whilst having enough character to retain some loyalty from seasoned drinkers. I still occasionally enjoy this beer, and will continue to do so. Far better on draft than from the bottle I find.","TheLongBeachBum","Jul 20, 2003"

This is a fairly tame Belgian though, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get into the style... also is a ""major"" brew of sorts (yeast and spiciness of the clove do stay to the back enough to be a transitional beer).

Fine bubbles race to the surface and maintain a thin layer throughout the beer. Nice Lacing. Smell is Sweet and ""perfumey"".... Typical belgian sweetness gives way to a nice hoppy bitterness (Almost champagne-like). These are nicely balanced to create a very drinkable blonde. Took a break from the tasting to let it warm up and more of the flavor that I fell in love with when drinking this beer on draught is coming out. Orginally, this was my first belgian beer and I have been waiting for months to try it again. Last time it was on draft and had a tad more character, but nonetheless, I was very impressed with the bottled version.

The aromas that came from the glass and bottle were of malt, fresh hops, grass, fruit (pears), bananas, bread, and spice (black pepper). The tastes that rolled across my tongue were of sweet malt, fresh baked bread, bananas, fruit (pears), hops (floral, herb), a slight alcohol and I swear cocoa, very slight, but I swear I tasted it. The aftertaste when first poured was drying on the tongue, but as it warmed, it became creamy and a banana flavor emerged. Decently carbonated and medium bodied (decent mouthful) was this beer.

Initial taste is banana-juice all the way - quite sweet, with a little spice in the end, possible a hint of alcohol. Overall a fantastic and consistent brew.","goz","Jan 20, 2003"
3.67,3.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"the beer is lighter in body than most belgians, but it does not really hurt it. it is silky smooth with a little bit of tingly carbonation and just a slight warming out of the pretty low alcohol content. it is very sweet, but you will get some nice spices in the end. there is not a lot of alcohol, so there is not a lot of alcohol flavor. overall, it is a pretty good brew that you should try if you want something different.","ElGuapo","Jan 14, 2003"
3.25,-8.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Leffe Blonde: Poured in a Leffe Goblet. Nice looking amber beer, with a surprisingly mild apricot aroma. The taste was sweet with a significant alcohol warmth and taste. In fact, I was surprised that the alcohol level was not as high as many other beers I’ve had. In other words: mild taste brings out the alcohol.","jackndan","Jan 04, 2003"
2.97,-16.3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Mostly clear (why is this beer clear?) dark gold color, big-bubbled white head of 1/2 an inch. Laces tend to decompose a bit. Slightly estery aroma, touched with some lemon. Reserved spicy malt flavor, some sense of clove and a more silky quality that's somewhat honey-like. Medium carbonation mutes hop senses, and the brew finishes with an overall lightly-browned toast effect. Overall, there's not much sense of alcohol, but also lacks major flavor distinction. It can tend toward the cloying side, as well. I also didn't expect it to be as transparent as it was.","ADR","Dec 15, 2002"
2.15,-39.4,3,3,2,2.5,1,"a little to sweet so much as I don't think I could drink another. A little to much alcohol flavor, almost like whine.the fruity sweet flavor was too much in the end not the best blonde IMHO!!","Kwak","Dec 02, 2002"
3.23,-9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"My only concern is with drinkability, it would seem to me to be a little to much constant sweetness for continuous consumption.","Shiloh","Nov 21, 2002"
3,-15.5,3,3,3,3,3,"A translucent gold color on the pour, the head magnanimous, frothy texture, the lace in pertaining sheets. The nose dominated by the malt, hints of citrus, fresh and clean. Front is malt and cloying sweet, top is lean and lanky, the finish has minimal carbonation, adequately hopped, but does Ring By Beer Bell!","Gusler","Nov 20, 2002"
4.9,38,5,5,5,5,4.5,"Pours a beautifull deep golden colour topped by a huge white creamy head. This beer has a sweet aroma and sweet taste. Aftertaste is sweet and it's quite long lasting. It's one of my 2 favourite beers. I like sweet beers. If you don't like sweet beer then i wouldn't reccomend this one...","ipogios","Nov 14, 2002"
3.14,-11.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a very lovely rich golden color with a creamy white head that clings to the sides of the glass as you drink.  The aroma is sweet and almost syrup like.  The taste is also on the sweet side with notes of honey and cream.  A nice beer, especially for a beginner whos just starting to sample Abbey-style beers.","Morris729","Nov 09, 2002"
3.68,3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I found that I like this beer for the fact that it is not so overwhelming as most of the Belgian Abbey-style ales, but it will seem too understated for Abbey-ale purists.","Pegasus","Oct 18, 2002"
3.9,9.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Anyway, this is a great Belgian for both a beginner or one early in the game. The first time I had this beer, I had maybe one or two Belgians under my belt and thought this was a bit too busy for me. After having had some 25 different beers in the past month, then trying another Leffe, my taste has developed into a much greater appreciation of this beer. So if you don't like it first, drink around some other tastes and come back. I'm fairly certain this one will grow on you.","brewdlyhooked13","Oct 16, 2002"
3.79,6.8,4.5,3,4,4,4,"Crystal clear, deep golden/amber with a hugh foamy & rocky white head that holds extremely well, buoyed by a very fine and effervescent carbonation. The tiny, slow rising bubbles add to the enjoyment of the appearance. Extensive lacing is created throughout the serving. The body is medium/full with an exceptional creaminess in the mouth from the very fine carbonation. The aroma is softly sweet, almost candyish, with a light citrus fruitiness and subtle phenolics. The flavor is a gently fruity (citrusy... orange?), and sweetly grainy malt that's lightly backed by hop bitterness and gentle spice. It finishes softly dry with some gently lingering peppery spiciness that's very nice and helps to keep the sweet malts from becoming cloying. Well balanced, firm and round, but somewhat limited in character. An excellent crossover beer into the world of Belgian ales.","NeroFiddled","Oct 07, 2002"
3.4,-4.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Too processed and clean for a Belgian blonde, sweet to the point of almost being syrupy on the palate. There are other Belgian blond ales that are far superior to this one. Perhaps worth a try if you appreciate the style.","Jason","Jul 22, 2002"
3.78,6.5,4,3.5,4,3,4,"The beer is a golden/tan color. Upon smelling it, I noticed a slight hop smell and a strong fruit smell. The fruit was one of the first things i tasted on my first sip, afterwards, the hoppy bitterness hit, but this was pleasant. This beer is very good, and very light and refreshing . It is something i could drink easily in the summer time.","usualpulp","Jul 08, 2002"
2.96,-16.6,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Tannish in color, and clear with a large thick head, foamy even, but evaportated quickly. The clearness of the beer was striking. Mine smelled somewhat harsh, stale almost. Tasted rather sweat, lots of syrupy, sweet, and citrus. Very smooth gong down but not thin. Overall it had some flashes of being a great beer, but the harsh smell seemed to dominate this one. I bought this as a single bottle of a pack, maybe is was old, that's why is what sold that way. Anyway, I am kinda glad I only had one to drink....Whose next ?","StevieW","Jun 10, 2002"
3.65,2.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Huge off white head with tight carbonation.  golden amber color.  great complex aroma, slightly spicy.  deceptively pale and drinkable.  some vanilla and mixed fruit flavor.  somewhat spicy. little to no hop character and leaves beer unbalanced.","Andy","May 16, 2002"
2.98,-16.1,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Its Ok, but i don't think its anything outstanding, but i don't think its meant to be, a bit sweet, and one of the more commercial Abbey blond style belgian ales.","rastaman","Mar 27, 2002"
3.45,-2.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I thought this was an enjoyable beer. Mildly sweet with subtle fruit and spiciness. Hazy golden appearance. Limited complexity when compared to other Belgian triples/pales. Could easily knock back a few of these. A good entry level Belgian brew.","John","Jan 21, 2002"
3.73,5.1,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Can't agree with the reviews. I thought it was a snappy, fruity Begian Single. Not as big or complex as the Trippels, but a tasty beer none the less.","QXSTER1","Jan 19, 2002"
2.22,-37.5,4,2,2,3,2,"You should also make serve at just below room temp, as the flavours seem to get better.","Todd","Nov 21, 2001"
