"D: This was a decent Belgian ale. The scent and taste were fitting for the style but didn't do anything to stand out. The body was a little weak, but the finish was smooth, so it was pretty easy to drink. Not a bad drink, but entirely forgettable."
""
""
"O: Overall a pretty tasty beer, but slightly less interesting than I would have imagined for a special release."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Very bland and flavorless.  Hopefully Bell's doesn't sue me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" In any case, this is a very drinkable belgian. Great golden haze. Moderate Sweetness. Clean crisp finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy pale straw yellow golden color with white fizzy head. Lots of light fruit notes with a little spice on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a little sweetness."
""

"A beautiful pale straw beer with a bright white head. As someone who doesn't really enjoy Belgians, I was very impressed with this. The malt was able to shine through the pungent Belgian yeast. This would be a great beer if you wanted something a little different on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing about this beer really reminded me of a Belgian style pale ale other than the coriander notes. Some other reviewers hit the nail on the head... ""Midwestern influence"".... ""reminded me more of a euro lager than a Belgium pale""..."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a rather enjoyable Belgian pale. It is a great example of the style and displays the Belgian fruit characteristics and a touch of hops to go along with the musty malts."
""
""
""

"The taste is quite bitter for the style, perhaps the bottle very fresh, the beer tasted green to me.  Not particularly bad but the grains and choice of hops aren't agreeing with my taste buds.  Light fruit, pungency and spices get lost in a wave of earthy hops. It tastes as though the ingredients cancel out and leave me with nothing but a slight bitterness. Not particularly drinkable but a decent American take on the style.  More impressive were all of the other planets thus far. I wouldn't by any means call this a terrible brew, just average which I usually don't associate with Bells."

"Summery, tasty and worth a try."
"Pours a hazy deep gold with particulates producing 1.5 fingers of somewhat lasting, while, frothy head that leaves a nice webby wash of lace. Aroma is pale & pilsner  (?) malt, wheat (?), mineral, thin banana, clove, caramel & dried apple/pear with a sour hint that is slightly off putting. Taste is pale, bready, pilsner (?) & wheat (?) malt, more intense Belgian yeast fruity esters of banana & clove than in the nose, thin hints of coriander & the same soured hint. Little Belgian funkiness. Spicy/peppery finish with a some bitterness & mineral. No hop presence outside of the bitterness. Malty, yeasty soured aftertaste is mildly astringent, slightly bitter & shortlived. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, prickly, dry & mildly astringent in the aftertaste."
"Poured into a Stone flute. Pours a medium dull golden amber with some white particulates and a thin white head which dissipates to patches, light lacing. Aroma of bready malt, light stone fruit, apple Belgian yeast, clove and coriander, hint of sulfur. Flavor follows aroma with bready malt, light stone fruit, apple family juice, moderate clove; finishes with clove and Belgian yeast, hint of hops. Medium bodied with good mouth feel. A spicy, bready take on a Belgian pale ale, clove forward. Malty and less Belgian yeast inspired than traditional, still a pleasant, enjoyable domestic Belgian ale."
""
""
""
"Taste-Spicy Belgian yeast, fruity, light-bodied and refreshing. Would make a nice warm weather quaffer."
""
"Straw appearance with a two finger white head. Gives off lots of carbonation bubbles. Lace nicely too. Smell reminds me of the grains found in good German pilsener. The taste sort of reminds me of Hoegaarden - clean and crisp with a hint of wheat, citrus and spice. Light bodied with good carbonation. This would be a great summer beer - light and refreshing. Too bad I am drinking it on a day when it is bitter cold outside."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad though I wish the sweet/spicy notes were a bit more subdued to let the malt/hop notes come through more"
""
"I don't typically like things with Belgian in the title with a few exceptions. This one is added to the exception list. It was pretty tasty. Somehow it reminded me of fresh nugs. A ""grassy"" taste I guess you might say. I'd drink it again for sure."
""
"It has a light, estery floral aroma with a touch of funk on the tail end. The beer itself is delicately flavored, with a light floral character and a touch of grassy hay from a gentle hop profile. Easy drinking and delicious."

"It's nice, but it's a little bland"
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a one time deal, get over it, they are trying something different and there is this new thing where everyone is shitting on Bell's but honestly this beer is not that bad."
""
""
"Not up to Bell's standard.  Not as bad as a Heineken but it does remind me a bit.  Just not with the skunk.  As it warmed toward the end the bitterness came out more and was not a pleasing aftertaste. Has an lingering alum taste.    More like a Euro lager in taste than a Belgian style anything.  Is this what Bell's intended?  Or did something go wrong?"
""
""
"Enjoyed this beer and the Planet's."
""
"It looks fine  but it's a little dark from yeast. Otherwise golden.  Only fine wisps of head remain after a pour.  Nose is tempting with peach and wheat and a powdery bit of yeast.  taste is weakly metallic int eh finish. You can taste the   a small metallic bite as you swallow.  Not a lot of fruitiness on the palate but a dry malty sweetness.  Some pear develops. Earthy and sour in a way.  Mouth feel is a little flat.  Almost phenolic. Finished slightly bitter and with a strange bit ofmalty sweetness."
""
""
"Packaged 12/4/14 so was probably best consumed fresh rather than nearly 2 months later. Pours a very light head that dissapates quickly (odd for this style). Nose was a lighter bready yeast that reminded me more of a euro lager than a Belgium pale. Taste was a huge let down as it had a skunkiness and profile more similar to a Heineken. The biscuity malt and forward floral dry hops I enjoy in a Belgium PA were missing almost completely. A real dud from a well respected brewery"
""
"Bell’s doesn’t miss often, but this is a big cut at a curveball in the dirt. Not undrinkable, but not enjoyable, & I’m really happy I only seized on a single. Sub-mediocre."
"O- spicy, earthy and musty, loaded with plenty of flavor for 4.8%."
"Deep golden hue with plenty of sediment suspended within the body.  A fingernail of off white head covers the rim and the majority of the top.  I detect coriander,orange peel,and light malt.  The taste is initially coriander,but then the light Belgian malt takes over and there is a light sweetness that appears.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and dry."
""
""
""
""
"Very similar to New Belgium Sunshine. V ery wheaty"
""
""

"One of the worst beers ive had from bells"
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, and a tall, fluffy, bubbly, white head that settles out fairly quick. Aromas of toasted grains, subtle banana sweetness, nutmeg and clove spices, bready notes, and a subtle butterscotch sweetness. Flavors are fairly smooth and balanced, with a rich and sweet caramel and butterscotch blend forward, laced with light clove and nutmeg spices, toasted notes, hints of Belgian yeast esters and funk, and some sweet banana characteristics. The body is mid-range, but the carbonation keeps it crisp and slightly dry. The aftertaste is more of the roast and banana characteristics. Smooth, dry, somewhat crisp finish. Not bad."
"O - It is a light, easy drinking, Belgian pale ale. I like it. I could definitely see myself downing this any time the mood strikes for a Belgian pale."
""
"My least favorite of the series"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not bad but just not overly good. could be more refreshing and the mustiness takes away a bit on it."
"Gold colored beer with suspended floating bits throughout. Head is large and fluffy for a short while before it turns to a thin patchy sheet and a ring. Aroma is spicy, with floral and fruity esters. Lightly phenolic... Banana cream pie, flowery, a little farmy, pizza doughy, with slight lemon/wheaty tartness. Taste is all of the above and pleasantly refreshing. Very easy to drink down and not overly yeasty either. Bell's did a good job with this one..."
""
""
"Not very good should have listened to the reviews nice try bells still love you guys for black note so it's all good!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Not my type of brew. Didn't like the sour smell or taste."

""
"O:  Limited complexity but no bothersome flaws.  More enjoyable than Bell's Venus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a very impressive beer. It drinks like an under-carbonated pilsner."
"O - I wasn't crazy over this one. I expect more from Bell's. I'm not sure if I'll continue with the series. I thought Mars was amazing, Venus was a flop, this was a step up from Venus, but nothing special by any means."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, Batch 13722, packaged on 12/04/14.  Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with about a half inch white head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like pears, cloves, and some wheat/bready malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some apricot and white grapes noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Overall it's an OK beer, but there's nothing about this that would make me want to buy it again.  I expect better from Bell's, but this was just pretty meh.  Glad I just got a single of this."
"Judging by many of the other reviews its possible that production was inconsistent.   Either that or its possible that wholefoods somehow stored or transported it improperly. Strange, off, yeast flavors, but perhaps just not to my preference."
"O - This is the first of the series I have tried. This was ok, nothing spectacular, not sure if the single price (4) was justified."
""

"Cheers."

"Second offering I've tried from the Bell's planet series.  First was Venus, which generally seems to be hated.  I found this one almost repulsive - reminded me of baby food."
"Part 3 of 7 in the Planet Series.  Unfortunately missed out on part 1.  12 oz bottle poured into a snifter style glass.  Nice Belgian flavor, very light and drinkable."
""
""
"Pretty let down on this one. Was expecting much more out if this. Smell is lacking substance and the flavor is just weak. For the price and the hype I had going into this, I will not be purchasing this again."
"It just smells kinda awful, thought it was my glass it's just funky.  Sulfur aroma."
"Outlier review: BAD BAD BAD"
"There should be no outlier detected. This beer is just awful."
""
"The aroma seems a bit off but for the most part the taste is true to form for this style."
""
""
"Drink this one too cold and you're in for a disappointing time. Opening it straight out of the fridge led me to believe it might have gotten skunked.  Let it warm up, though, and it becomes considerably less objectionable. Tastes like a fairly average BPA. Not terribly exciting, but if they still have a few at my local beer place next week I might pick another one up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The aroma is off, but the taste is decent.  I wouldn’t buy this again, but certainly there are worse beersd out there.  Worth a one time try as part of the series.  3.25"
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes like hotdog water... Very disappointing. Bells brews some of the best beers around. They missed the mark on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yikes, things have fallen off fast since Mars. At least Venus took a swing and missed, but this one simply brings very little to the table--just not worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: If you're keeping up with the series thus far, this is one of the better ones, so check it out. If not, it's definitely passable unless you're a huge fan of Bell's."
""
""
""
"Tasty Belgian, I liked it."
""
""
""
"Not very enjoyable.  Lacking a defining taste"
""
"O: Slightly disappointed in this offering from Bells - I have higher expectations than was delivered here. There is something slightly off in both the flavors and aromas - skunky is the best way to describe it. Not sure I would go for another of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mostly clear golden color with a huge bone white head. Big aromas of Rhino farts, bready yeasty malt and touches of lemon. Rich bready malt flavor with all the yeast derived flavors I expected. Decent brew."
""
""
"I love Bell's beer and it's one of my favorite brewpubs to visit.  But this...  Well, Mars was much, much better than Mercury and Venus. so maybe there's hope for the larger planets."
""
""
""
""
"t/m/o - fairly meh.  malty, grainy.  pilsner like with hints of belgian sweetness.  more pale ale than belgian but fairly forgettable.  medium body, fizzy carbonation...not bad, just nothing special...maybe some soft melon notes on the nose and taste but other than that...run of the mill.  makes sense that these one off's aren't anything crazy, if they were they wouldn't/shouldn't be one offs...a cool tick none-the-less, i'll be sure to spread the other bottles around so others can enjoy the taste."
"Light bodied, little sweetness on the finish"
"I actually enjoyed this one a lot. Some distinctive stuff going on (at least from my previous experiences). Poured a straw-color from the 12oz into my snifter, definitely unfiltered, definitely very little in the way of head. A hint of pear, and a ton of white grape/white wine aromas on the nose. Just a hint of the yeast, clean and subtle. Bit sour on the front of the sip, with some surprisingly bright notes emerging. Refreshing. Just a hint of warmth on the back end. Crisp and dry mouthfeel, and the bit of lingering aftertaste was very style-appropriate. Very different take on the Belgian to me (I am used to mostly trippels and quads), and very glad I picked this one up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know exactly what's off about this one, many things though.  It is weird and not for me."
""
""
""
"Another letdown from the Planet Series.  Very off smell, not much going on with the taste.  A boring beer for a boring style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy gold with a thin fizzy white head that settles quickly to a thin ring, with one, count 'em, one splotchy ring of lace sticking as we proceed down the glass. Smell: floral, wheat cracker, coriander. Not much happening here. Taste: same, and soapy to boot, with a little husk and even less orange peel. I imagine that filtering a mediocre wit would put you in Mercury's neighborhood. Venus was an adjunct-overpowered mess, but Mercury is just plain underwhelming and boring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but for for a one time brew, it was a tad disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice enough Belgian Pale Ale...some light breadiness (I prefer a bit more punch here), along with some mild spicy notes as well as fruity notes of apples and pears..the fruity notes provide a slightly tart finish.   Slightly above average for the style with the spicy aroma being its strong point."
""
""
"O - A tasty low abv belgian ale.  Easy to drink and would be awesome in the summer time."
"Light golden body with a mild haze and a quarter inch of white head. Aromas of clove, Belgian yeast, banana, fruity esters, alcohol, wheat, lemon. Flavor is not on par with any of the respectable Belgian ales of a similar ilk. A bit brash and harsh, lacking subtlety / nuance. Fruity yeast with a lemony hop finish. I was hoping for more, considering the brewery and the fact that this beer is a special release."
""
""
""
"O:  A decent beer overall, though nothing particularly special about it."
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent Belgian Pale Ale and worth trying. I only wished this came out during the summer so I could enjoy it more."
""
"These Bell's planet series beers have been great, this one especially -- a drinkable, low-ABV, malt-forward Belgian with tons of Midwestern influence and flavor to the max!"
"This is a pretty solid pale ale."
""
"Big bells fan and a big fan of this beer. Thankful for getting to try this."
""
""
""
""
""

"Better then the venus one"
"Light yellow with a thin, white head with decent retention and lacing. The nose is rustic with bread, mild honey, moderate spice - pepper and mild phenols ,- and a great hop character, earthy and mildly lemony. I do get a mild orange peel and grains of paradise character as well.  The palate opens with a dry, crisp, snappy cracker malt character and a wonderfully complementary hop flavor and bitterness, a blend of earth, lemons and green grass. The mid palate has some of the yeast expression, spicy and mildly phenolic. Drying and crisp on the finish, this beer is light in body, highly carbonated and has lingering flavors of crackers, earth, lemon and a little floral character. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a delicate and easy-drinking, but fairly complex and excellently balanced beer. It may not have been my best choice on this subzero Minnesota day, but that is hardly the beer's fault."
""
"Overall: A very solid session Belgian Pale Ale. Nice mix of yeast, fruit, and spice flavors that would make you think it’s a heavier beer."
"Bell's Mercury -----3.5/5"
"This beer was better than I expected. I'm not usually a fan of straight Belgian ales, but this really reminded me of North Coast Pranqster.  Specifically how clean and crisp the beer tasted.  It also did not have the traditional Belgian yeast flavor that I expected. I can see how if you were going in expecting a more traditional Belgian this beer would be a disappointment, but for me it was the opposite.  Light, golden, clean, easy drinking, good flavor, wasn't the heavy craft beer that I expected from Bells.  This is something I could easily drink all summer (even though it came out in December)."
""
"I want to keep trying this planet series. I want to keep liking Bell's, but goddamn it! Make something good! Mars great, let's not speak of Venus and now Mercury, it's like a Budweiser-Belgo-Session. At least I can finish this one. Light very light, probably wouldn't be so critical if I didn't expect more from Bell's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too much cereal and grain in the nose. Nice estery profile on the palate and very drinkable without being too thin. My favorite of the series thus far."
""
"Not my favorite style, but I like the fruity esters. A little too earthy and bitter for my palate."
""
""
"O - This is the second sub par effort from the Bell's planet series. It's a decent session beer, but nothing more than that."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden yellow with some suspended yeast particles and topped with a nice milky white head.  Smells of moderate Belgian yeast spiciness, grass, pears, and a honey-like malty sweetness.  Simple, but pleasant.  Flavor is a little spicier, but mostly follows the aroma with bready grain, straw, peppercorns, and a slight citrus acidity.  I like it.  Light, crisp, and very drinkable.  Not sure what other people were expecting, but this is a well-made, sessionable Belgian-style beer."
""
"Truly sub-par brew. Nose is promising, citrus, pear. Taste does not follow at all. Very watery, nothing(y) up front, some kind of cereal, mild Belgian taste on the back. On par with something you'd find in a Dundee craft pack, nowhere close to normal level of Bell's excellence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good Belgian pale ale, but really nothing terribly special. Solid all the way though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really dug this beer, it's not amazing or that complex but it is very refreshing and an interesting offering from a big craft brewer. I liked this one much more than Venus."
"What is Bell's doing besides putting out below average beer in this Planet Series? This beer has no smell or taste worth note. The only thing I taste is some Belgian yeast and malt, nothing worthwhile. I think I am done with this series"
"With that said.  I drank 6 of them and thought it was a very good effort, crisp, lively,  even refreshing."
""
"O - Pretty decent Belgian style, but nothing like Duvel. It was nice to drink and fans of this style MIGHT enjoy it."
""
"I think bell's did a great job on this beer.  The mouth feel is amazing for the low abv.  I could see myself drinking this all summer if it was available."
"Final score: 3.56"
""
""
"Pale, so pale! Smell is a bit underwhelming, but the taste is superb for me, not too heavy on the belgian side, but a great balance. The mouthfeel is pretty standard. Overall a strong offering for those like me, that enjoy a belgian, but do not want to be manhandled by the flavor!"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/4/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, light banana, wheat, cracker, bread, pepper, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, light banana, wheat, bread, cracker, pepper, clove, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness and light earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, wheat, bread, cracker, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a very nice Belgian pale ale style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"a really good beer and cant wait for the others in the series"
"Light, crisp, refreshing. Earthy hops. A light Belgian yeast strain. Dry. Some spices. Cloves. A very simple beer. Nothing too complex. Hoppy and bitter with some bready malts."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm embarrassed to say how much I paid for this."
""
"Overall, Bell's need to re-evaluate this recipe (IMO)."
""
""
""
"The unfiltered part of the beer makes this beer pretty great!"
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: Medium feel with a moderate/low carbonation. The taste is much like the smell. Faintness all-around with clove being at the forefront with a little bit of banana, and then a little bit of corn-like adjunct flavor. Finishes clean, but overall ""bleh."" It tastes rather light (as I'd expect given the ABV) and isn't at all blowing me away like I thought these Planet Series beers would -- Mars did, but both this and Venus have been let downs. Anyway, the taste is light with no real intensity, it's just loaded with subtly. That's not normally a bad thing, but this is just a ""meh"" beer that's the very definitely of decent. Not only did I expect something fantastic from Bell's, I anticipated something pretty much earth shattering, since it's the Planet Series. I could deal with Venus being one of those adventurous beers that couldn't quite make it, but this is just a ho-hum Belgian Pale Ale that I paid $3 for just because of the label. Oh well. Like Venus, I know not to buy it again. This series is turning out to be a disappointment so far. I think this beer (and probably Venus as well) would score lower had they not been Bell's Planet Series beers. This beer should've just been called ""Bell's Mediocrity."""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, clean and leaving the palate highly refreshed, the beer trends bitter and spicy lingering with hops and grain remnants. Light alcohol plays delicately on the back of the throat while echoes of honeysuckle return in aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Pours yellowish golden with a slight white head that quickly recedes. Some coating on side of glass remains. Aroma offers some strong cereal grain sweetness, herbal tones from some hops, and spice from the Belgian yeast. Flavor is reminiscent of the aroma but the grains tend to dominate a little more in flavor, expected though given its low abv. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, I enjoyed this one a good deal and easily my favorite of the Planet Series releases so far. Would be a really nice session ale if priced more affordably. Offer this in six packs at $10 or less and I'd be a happy customer. Current price point will keep me away from buying this one again though and I did dock points from it in overall due to affordability."
""
"Decent belgian pale, not much to say here. Golden straw with fizzy white head, smells of vague fruitiness and grainy malt, belgian yeast. Tastes light, belgian yeast, hay, bit of sweetness. Light mouthfeel, medium effervescence, would recommend this to fans of the style"
""
""
""
"Pours clear straw golden yellow in color with a thin white head. Smell has bready malt forward with some light straw notes. Light Belgian esters with a herbal noble hop aroma clean almost lager like yeast finishing aroma. Taste follows nose with Belgian esters first to hit the palate and followed by bready malt, herbal hops and a clean finish. Mouthfeel is light crisp and refreshing."
""
"Overal I was extremely pleased with this brew. Perhaps it's just due to me finding a new style I like which I don't have a lot of experience in, but I really loved the taste of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"As most have noted, this was decent Belgian pale ale, but nothing that blew my socks off..."
"Overall, a rather average interpretation of this style. Can't really recommend it when there are so many superior and authentic Belgian examples within easy reach."
""
"It's not disgusting, but totally ordinary. It tastes a lot like a Czech pilsner rather than a BPA. Totally a disappointment. At least Venus was trying to be unique. The mass produced Leffe blonde is much better than this. I love Bell's, but this beer is a joke compared to what they can do. I think Bell's is exploiting the marketability of the Planet Series with this one. What a shame."
