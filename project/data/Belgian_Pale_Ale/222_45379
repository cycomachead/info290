3.96,1.8,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"O: So they tweaked the Duvel recipe for draught. I guess I kind of get it, the bottled version of duvel does not lend itself to the tap lines, mainly due to its strength. So they take the abv down a little, lighten the body to make it more sessionable, and make it noticeably more hoppy for good measure (this is America after all). It's still a very good beer, just not the Duvel I know and love. It feels just a little dumbed down in all respects compared to its bottled counterpart. The real problem is the name. Putting 'Single' on the bottle in a Belgian context will lead people to believe that this is modeled after an abbey single. Certainly not the case at 6.8% abv. Maybe they should just make a beer more akin to an abbey single for draught. The market is trending in that direction these days anyway, demand for true session offerings is on the rise.","ryan1788a5","Nov 27, 2013"

I feel it at the back of my mouth. Sits very light and feels clean. It feels like a euro lager. All the flavors are there, but when you finish you drink, all the flavors fade insanely quickly.

Bubblegum notes come through upon a second take. Tastes of apricot and apples, with an afterthought of malt. Dry and light to medium bodied.

Well, there it was under another name: Duvel Single. They changed the name as Green implied being green (saving the planet kind of thing), or being of a green colour and there was a lot of resistance from people. So they told me. Anyhow, I tasted the Duvel Single and it is all that I expected. It's a Duvel in a smaller package. Less alcoholic, more refreshing, like a everynight after work kind of beer. I truly enjoyed it. A nice alternative to a Leffe or a Stella which I tend to get a bit bored with at times.","beauweaver","Sep 07, 2011"

This version of Duvel is much lighter in seemingly all facets: appearance, aroma, flavor, and body. That said, it's a nice, light, crisp, refreshing beer. Drinkability is high.

4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is full of biscuit malt with a lot of spices and some grassy hops. The beer smells much hoppier than regular Duvel. The flavor is also quite hoppy for a Belgian Pale Ale. I get some yeast as well as some spicy, European hops which compliment the bready malt very well. The alcohol is more well hidden than in regular Duvel. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

The odd part about the flavor is the odd perhaps off putting aftertaste. The flavor I found to best equate it was steamed carrots. Which I like for dinner, but not in my beer.

The nose comprises flowers, grass, wet hay, and a rather light vein of lemon peel. It all combines into quite the olfactory blast. The taste holds notes of earthy hops, pepper, clove, banana, orange peel, and lemongrass. It's all kinda one-sided, even if it's enjoyable. The body is a medium light, with a light carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, this is pretty good, but I don't think I could really drink all that much.

Still it left extremely impressive thick rings of sticky lacing after each sip. The nose isn't as strong or complex as Duvel, and neither is the flavor. There are a lot less spice and yeast flavors. The body is closer to the light side of medium rather than full and thick like Duvel. Overall, this is a very drinkable light beer, and for what it is, it deserves a good score.

Taste is yeast, spice, pear, grass. Carbonation and alcohol taste toned down very much from the regular, I like. Nice dry bitterness. Very drinkable and refreshing.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but this one really blew me away. It seemed to share little in common with the original Duvel. Instead of the soft vanilla candy and clove notes, this was hoppy with almost sour lemon rind and big (for a Belgian) grassy hops. That was wonderfully balanced against mild biscuit and bread crust malt flavors that ran under the yeast and hop character. Heck of a beer. Find it and drink several.","tempest","Mar 10, 2010"

Underwhelming. I expected so much for a relatively rare & anticipated beer, especially from Duvel. Perhaps this is an attempt to win over the summer/hefe beer crowd who like lemon wedges & dancing ponies. The pour was a bright yellow with full white, fluffy head that left some good lace, with an aroma of crackery yeast & lemon-pepper. The flavor was a bit of a Hefe-Blond mix, not horrible if that's what you expect, but simplistic I thought. Yeasty with some spice & lemon, the drinkability was good, nice smooth & crisp. Definitely better for a nice summer day rather than fall evening. All in all, I'd rather save a couple bucks & have an Allagash white.","selecter70","Oct 05, 2009"

Tasted like a normal Duvel also. Crisp and sharp on the palate too. The abv is a bit lower, which is what the brewery was presumably going for. It is actually noticeable, which not a bad thing. If they are trying to make an even smoother-to-drink Duvel, they have succeeded. It went well with a plate of BBQ food.","morebeergood","Oct 03, 2009"

It's a light, refreshing version of Duvel that I enjoyed, but it's not something that I would seek out. The wide distribution and relatively cheap price of Duvel are pretty incredible for such a world class beer. I appreciate the brewery's attempt to make a light version, but the magic of the original just isn't there for me. This beer pours a clear bright yellow with a decent head.

As a stand alone beer this would be a good offering but I am handicapped by the fact that this is under the Duvel name and because of that I automatically assume some stuff about the beer.

Bubbles drift upwards rapidly from the apex of the tulip. The smell was a bit different from the regular Duvel. It had a bit more hop presence and more fruitiness of a Belgian pale ale such as Heylissem or Grimbergen than the pilsener bite of Duvel. Also, the nose was indeed a touch weaker than expected. Very similar to the smell came the taste. Flavorful but not overly so. I didn't think much of it actually. Light and refreshing with very crisp carbonation dancing on the palate.

The taste is somewhat like a Duvel light, but the lingering finish comes through nicely and leaves a great balance of sweet malts, citrus hops and mild spice. The beer is quite light, crisp, and refreshing, much more drinkable in the summer than its bottled brother.
