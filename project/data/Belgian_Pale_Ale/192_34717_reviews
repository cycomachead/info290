"O: An enjoyable beer great for a cool Spring night or to refresh after an early season ride. I like the balance on the spice and fruit additions, there is enough to let you know it's there but not so much that it obscures the underling beer"

"Pleasant surprise! Great summer beer - very refreshing but still very flavorful."
"overall...i would say that that a better name for this beer would be ""puddle jumper"". especially when some spring time snow/slush is involved. as a seasonal it just mashes up the spring time into a force du jour that straddles fences and frustrates the drinker into dysfunction."
"O- Average. That is the best way i can describe this beer. Quite refreshing, but nothing worth seeking out."
""
""
"O: a unique and interesting fruit/herb beer well worth trying. Lots of subtleties in this one."
""
""

"Light grainy yellow with a soapy etched top. Smells sweet, grassy and fruity. Some honeydew, some corn, some apricot and belgian yeast with a touch of clay. Tastes sweet and floral, some more honeydew, some canteloupe, a bit of edible flowers, just a cut of gut alfalfa. Pretty flavor. Medium bodied with tight, moderate carb and a watering finish. An interesting beer, something that seems it would be nice on occassion, but not full time, a real winner for a seasonal. Not much belgian about it to me, which is not necessarily a negative, but something of note for the style."

"I was a bit disappointed as I had higher expectations, but it was an OK beer."

"O: What’s a Goji berry? And schisandra? Who knows, but this beer (apparently) nails those flavors. One of the many lawnmower beers that satisfies cravings for interesting, complex taste – delicious."
""
""
"Just interesting enough. Not gonna go looking for it, but its not a bad beer. Probably meant for drinking in the month of April and May."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nicely spicy and fruity. There's a well-balanced melding of hoppy citrus and biscuity malts. Enjoyable and well-done session ale here, and I wish this were available more widely."
"Descent. I enjoy the fresh flavors and aromas but lacks complexity."
""
""
""
"O - Overall i think this is a refreshing brew to drink on a warm day, similar to a Pilsner or something like that. I'd drink it again but nothing wowed me about it. I think this is just a refreshing, balanced, approachable, quaff-able brew. Cheers!"
"o: This beer has no faults other than coming off a little acidic but due to the simplicity of it. Refreshing and nice, a bit too plain though."
"Overall this is a decent brew and although I drank it on a damp chilly winter night I imagine it to be a great refreshing summer beer. I'm glad they included it in the sampler 12 pack."

"Thirst quenching and unique. Not the best thing I've had recently, but worth trying for the unique ingredients. I would drink this again in warmer weather."
"Interesting wheat beer with a sweet berry twist. Almost comparable to Liney's or the like, but slightly better."

"Not the best beer from New Belgium and actually just barely worth trying. Get a single if you can."
"Pours a big head with big bubbles, somewhat lasting head. Beer has a very clear football beer-ish color, very fizzy. Very malty aroma, inhaling deeply - floral aroma. Football beer-ish aroma, not appealing. Light taste, malty aftertaste, but more flavor than typical football beer. Good dry malty taste on the tongue. Reminds me a little of Sam Adams lite. Odd combination of flavors, malts somewhat tempered, but not all that appealing an overall flavor."
"Poured a pale yellow with a white half finger that melts to very sticky lacing. Nose is faint Belgium yeast and sweet malts. Taste is surprising on this. A balanced mixture of pale malts, citrusy hops, definite lemon and Belgian yeast. Good brew by New Belgium"
"Drinkability: This is a great all around beer."
"Where is the nuanced malt profile? Feels like New Belgium decided, ""throw some crazy herbs in that beer, man, and age it in oak, and put a wave of snow on the label. Extreme!"" I drank the other five before this, so not awful, but this is an attempt to push the style that fell short. Throw in the inflated price and I won't be revisiting it."
"New Belgium may never blow you away with their beers but they constantly make quality session beers and Springboard holds true to that philosophy."
"D - I like it. Light and crisp, but not lacking in character. Very drinkable."
"Opinion: This is an alright beer. I am not too find of the balance. I like the blend of fruity flavors and how it mixes with the hops...but the malt to back it all up was lacking. I would think that just attenuating it a bit less would do the trick, but perhaps an adjustment with Dextrine malt would be preferred. Anyway, I would like a bit more substance."
"D: One of my favorite offerings from New Belgium though it didn't start off that way. Well balanced and very very drinkable."
"Good drinkability."
"I do like the mouthfeel it has, there's plenty of budy to it so you definately don't feel like you're drinking a lame fizzy yellow beer. It's a clever yeasty beastie."
"Overall a tasty ale. Good drinkability."
"It seemed surprisingly wheaty, and didn't have that strong New Belgium malt flavor that seems to be the same base for all their beers."
"Lovely springtime ale, this. I had a 6-pack without reviewing earlier, I drank it so fast. I could like this a lot."
"Thanks to rysberg01 for tossing this beer in as an extra in a recent trade. Pours a slightly hazy pale golden- the color of straw. Really short head that sticks around as a thin cap. Smells fresh and grassy and somewhat herbal plus aromas of lemon and wheat. The taste is similar but with an additional surprising herbal bitterness that lingers. Crisp mouthfeel and lingering bitterness makes this somewhat different and refreshing. Interesting and pretty enjoyable. The additional herbs really come through."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and, how shall I say, ""pleasant"" for lack of a better term. Not knock your socks off good, but all in all drinkable and definitely one I will give another try."
"overall, this was an enjoyable beer but i dont think that i will buy it again"
"D - Not too complex and kindof one-dimensional. Nevertheless, it is still flavorful and very drinkable."
"1 1/2"" white head, good retention and lace. Hazy pale yellow like a wit. Nose full of spice, wheat, grape skin and pepper. Wheat follows through in the taste. Apples, pepper, a hint of hops. A ton of crazy stuff that I would not know without the label follows -- unique. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Decent drinkability."
"Drinkability is decent on this one. The carbonation and spices might keep me from drinking a whole 6-pack, but this beer is unique and enjoyable. Light and smooth. I enjoyed it a lot."
"This reminds me alot of their other Belgian pale ale. A good beer, but nothing amazing. A clear yellow color with a tan head. Light aromas of fruit and peppery yeast. The flavor profile is also a bit dull. Good for a pilsner. The body is ligt and fizzy. A decent brew."
"D - Pretty good. A nice brew. I bought a six pack of this and I am happy to drink all of them. A nice spring beer from New Belgium."
"I wouldn't have more of this beer. I couldn't completely finish my 16oz pint..."
"Overall a rather drinkable concoction from our friends at New Belgium. First time I tried this and it was a pleasant surprise. I'd revisit this one again."
"This is a pretty nice beer that is very drinkable. It doesn't feel too heavy, which is a very nice touch. Good job, New Belgium!"
"This was a pretty good beer. Was expecting a something different, however this surprised me in a good way. Glad I picked this up..."
"Good brew."
"This beer poured a nice golden yellow color with a huge, fluffy white head. The smell was nice and hoppy with great citrus notes. Also had a nice spiciness to it. The taste was a very refreshing bitterness with a nice maltiness in the front. The mouthfeel was light to medium body with medium carbonation. Overall the beer was nice and refreshing. Great beer!!"
"Poured into a session glass. I like the way this looks golden, but more on the yellow side nice carbonation and head retention about a solid 1/2 inch after pouring. The nose is initially malty followed by some nice hop spiciness, even some really faint citrus notes, and then piney hop notes....good stuff. The taste is good follows the nose, first malty sweetness, then the hops kicks in followed by a weird kind of bitterness, wormwood. The mouthfeel is unique...dry finish with a strange bitterness. I really like this offering."
"Golden yellow - 1/2 inch of white head, lots of bubbles and nice retention. Smells of floral hops and bits of lemon with clusters of cloves, coriander and fresh yeast. The taste is pretty spicy, slightly oaky with some pine, hops, lemon zest, oranges, cloves all coming together into a well-ballanced and unique flavor. There is a moderate amount of carbonation, a medium body and a dry finish. This is my kind of session beer - highly refreshing and still with unique flavor. Good beer."
"Medium body and a bit on the silky side. Finishes crisp with a spicy kick. Easy drinking and brings the thought of spring to mind."
"D: This is a pretty light beer from New Belgium, its easily drinkable, and goes well with a warm day. I can drink a fair amount of this stuff as well. Pretty good overall, but not one of their best."
"D - I really enjoyed the Mt. Hood hops. Very thirst quenching and not a bad session beer at 6.2."
"Overall: this beer is very light in color, almost alarmingly light but the head looks great and redeemed the appearance a bit. This is a good session beer, sweet, refreshing, crisp and drinkable. Did the oak aged portion, use of oats and herbs make it a CRAZY good session beer? No. Would I buy it again? On a hot day I would certainly consider it."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Nice beer."
"D- Good for warm weather, not great for taste this time around."
"This would be a nice drinker on a hot day. Just better than average but it is inexpensive and readily available in a lot of areas."
"This beer pours a clear pale golden color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into decent lacing. The aroma is of lemon zest, floral hops, lavender, berries, and a hint of caramel. The has more caramel than the aroma, with only hints of the berries, lavender, and floral notes. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a very high level of carbonation which seems to get in the way a bit. Overall, this is a decent beer that I could drink again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"D - Overall I say that this is a pretty good beer worth checking out sometime very easy to drink and it has a good taste too"
"The beer pours a yellowish color with a lasting big head. Mostly transluscent and thinnish looking. Smell is wheat and spices and somewhat witbier like. Taste is light malty, wheaty and mild with unique earthy spices. Not bad, really, but just decent."
"A nice white head with medium to large bubbles. The liquid is a very light and a tad cloudy yellow with a smallish amount of micro-bubbles. The aroma it gave off was a pleasant beery smell, not heavy on any particular ingredient. The first taste gives forth a nice body and a nice smooth taste. Not overbearing in any degree. This beer is similar, but not quite, to others I've had from New Belgium. The feel in my mouth was one that left my tongue wanting another sip, ever so slightly dry. This is a nice well rounded beer with all of its assets in place and not overstated. It's smooth, flavorful and has ""beer"" written all over it. The head didn't dissipate, and hung around 'til the bottom of the mug along with the bubbles. This beer is great all the way through the sixpack."
"I don't know that I'll seek this out, but it was interesting and drinkable."
"D- I'd definitely have another. Nice thirst quencher for nice weather."
"This was aninteresting beer as I think it is a well crafted beer per the appearance and mouthfeel but I didn't care for the flavors they added."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pours a brigt sunshine, hay, banana peel mixture wih a consistant rush of bubbles and great thick lacing thathlds tight to the glass throughout he whole beer.The aroma is a dry blgia maltwith a slight herbal hint. Along with a yeasty start. The tart is a slightly sweet, yet dy pale malt with a spritz of lime and herbs. The finish is a bone dry hoppy splash mixed with that swet Belgian malt flair. A pretty bitter Belgian pale ale. But I love it. This is a great beer. And I love the mixing and blanding of herbs in this brew."
"A pretty good beer, I think it would work well as a summer quencher also. Nice little funk notes give it something different than your general blonde or pale ale."
"D: very good, easy drinking beer and enough happening to keep interest. Overall, I enjoyed the beer but wasn't outstanding and probably not going to seek out again."
"D: This one is not for me. More of a personal preference than anything else, I think. The herbs just do not agree with me."
"Glistening with a bright white head of one-finger's width, the color is that of an early harvest lemon, a tinge of green atop a haze of cloudy yellow. Pronounced lacing, a light fresh smell. Smooth mouthfeel with just enough crisp carbonation to liven the senses on a warm spring's late afternoon. No strong flavors, a touch of citrus, very drinkable but relatively unremarkable."
"D. A good beer with many likable traits. Clean & fresh on-tap, east to consume. One I've had on a few occasions; pretty simple but very tasty."
"do a little magic with it- Springboard was a real treat!"
"Perfect for a spring day in the sun, and enough alcohol to make you feel good about it."
"To me, this beer lost the great aspects of either a good Belgian or a Pale Ale. At the cost of a typical craft brew, I won't be getting this again unless I hear they've gone back to the drawing board with the recipe."
"Looks like a wit. Pale creamy white body with dim lemon yellow shades. Pure white cap of froth on top. Lacing is sufficient. Aroma has some wheat tang characteristics and a little lemon. Flavor is pretty lifeless. I'm not getting it here whatever ""it"" is. So this beer is brewed with Wormwood, Lycium, Schisandra, oats, ancient Chinese herbs, Mt. Hood hops and 2% of this ale was aged in Oak Barrels?? Why 2%? The flavor is gritty and dirty. Not very clean or refreshing. A weird kind of dryness lingers. This is not for me. Glad I only got a single."
"In the mouth is was well carbonated and left a slight bitter mark. It is a very refreshing beer that could easily be a session on a hot day."
"The beer settles in a chalice a lovely cloudy blonde, but with a short head that goes away. The aroma is made up of assorted spices I can't put my fingers on. Kind of tart and soury. As for the taste, it's refreshing and tastes...um...like springtime. Herbs and spice are alive in the flavor and are melded well into the beer. So then why I am drinking this inside my house? I'm stepping outside for a few minutes where I assume I'm enjoy this beer even more...yeah, it was a little more enjoyable. I even picked up on bubblegum notes too. This gets my recommendation."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow/gold colour. Slightly hazy with an airy white head (with little retention). Has a light yeasty aroma with a bit of wheat and unidentifiable light fruits in it. Taste is quite similar. Light-bodied with minimal carbonation. Good ABV and quite drinkable. But like most beers from N.B. it fails to catch my attention."
"Poured an extremely pale gold with a thick head. After a vigorous pour, it dissipated slowly and lacing lingered. Smells of floral and herbs. Taste is watery, but complex, not that that's a good thing. More herbs than beer. No bitterness to note, and a light bodied smooth beer that makes me think this is more a herb infused domestic light beer than anything worthwhile."
"Drinkability- easy. Try to get this beer on tap, it's pretty good."
"D: Not a bad offering from NB. It's hard for me to rate this because I haven't had much experience for the style, and thus I can't really compare it to something like Orval or Leffe. I could do with a bit more depth of flavor personally. I like the fact that they didn't go overboard with the hops. I guess my overall impression is that there's nothing offensive about this beer, nothing I particularly dislike, but also nothing that makes it stand out for me."
"Very light yellow and hazy. White head. Aromas of citrus/ coriander but not quite. Bitter spices/ herbs. Flavor is a mix of Belgian blonde and witbier. But with a mild and unpleasant bitterness on the finish - like my primitive instincts are kicking in telling me that I have poison in my mouth. The mouth feel is decent, and although the crazy poison taste is not always present on each sip, it shows up enough to mar its drinkability. Maybe this could be a hybrid east meets west crazy cure for a disease I hope never gets discovered."
"This beer poured a hazy, pale, gold with a nice snowy white head. Its nose wasn't strong at all, but I did get notes of lemony citrus poking through, but nothing too prominent. The beers' taste definitely had a grainy taste, with herbal notes in the back, finished a little dry and tart. Mouthfeel was crisp. Not a bad beer by no means, but I was expecting a little more flavor up front."
"Hazy gold with a big, fluffy head of bright white foam. Lots of sticky lacing and great head retention. Spicy hop aroma, a bit yeasty and earthy, fruity peach, a bit of cereal. Mild flavour with a bit of fruit up front, malt sweetness, floral hops kick in, finishes with peach and spicy hops. Very mellow. Creamy carbonation with a light, airy texture. Not very crisp, but good mouthfeel. A bit drying. Really tasty and very drinkable. This beer has a nice balance and refreshing flavour that I quite enjoyed."
"Drinkability: This beer is above average and crisp, but it doesn't do enough for me to want to drink more."
"Very herbal, especially for a Belgian Pale Ale. Bright lemongrass and a bit of oak/wood. Extremly refreshing and bright. Great for a camping trip in the summer or a nice spring drinker. Don't save this one until winter, drink it now!"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass which I had to warm by hand, stupid iced glasses. The color was bright white-yellow and reminded me of their wit beer, hazy. It had a funky, yeasty smell to it. The flavor was odd, herbs, no oakiness which is not surprising given that only 2% was oak-aged. Interesting beer and easy to drink but I think one serving is enough."
"Thanks, younger35, for the opportunity"
"I greatly appreciate this site, and have had several of new belgiums beers, but this one isn't doing much for me. Tastes like detox tea. Maybe it would go good with sushi?"
"The body is light and finishes a touch dry. Some silky or wheaty characteristic for a smooth finish. Carbonation is a light for style but still helps the orange zest finish. Overall it's a bottle conditioned New Belgian beer. Kind of like a spiced up unfiltered Sunshine Wheat."
"Crisp and mellow, easy to drink but your ""mouth"" doesn't ""feel"" much going on."
"Overall, a good beer, and worth the 9 bucks for the sixer. Perfect for one of those spring days, when the weather is warming up, and you're like ""Damn, it's hot today!"" even though it's only 70 degrees."
"Overall: I am usually excited to try something new from New Belgium. Since Fat Tire was my gateway beer, I guess I just have some respect for the brewery. I was happy with this one. I will buy it again."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into New Belgium snifter. Poured a pale straw yellow color with a haziness, with a thick head with lacing. Smell is off lemon, spice, and slight yeast aroma. Taste is medicinal spiced with lemon zest, earthy overtones, and a slight tannic flavor. Mouthfeel is light body , crisp and dry. With a mild carbonation level. Pretty easy to drink."
"Taste: this is a fun drinking beer. The spices and yeast add a complexity to the candy sweetness and hop bitterness. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Maybe not the best representation of a Belgian but certainly a good brew."
"A nice aroma of fuit sweetness, mineral, bready maltyness and fresh spring water. Flavor is quite interresting, it first seems simplistic as it hits of with a very traditional malt flavor followed by a hop bitterness, but then it takes of with a lingering biterness that is not quite like hops, more like a herb, kinda like ""pissenlit"" stems without being overwhelming. It ends on a fruity note that invites a new sip."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, modeled after the Westmalle bottle."
"A very unique, highly drinkable pale. I don't think I've experienced a sub par product from New Belgium in my life and this is no exception. Definitely my favorite session beer as of late, almost as un-filling as a commercial light lager. Very recomended."
"Nice clear golden amber color on the pour from the 12 ounce bottle, the head a good two fingers in size and a creamy bright white, retention is good, with the resultant lace a fine velum like sheet. Nose has hints of earthiness linked to the sweet malt, crisp and sparkling, fruit like tones, Id say peaches, start has a sweet malt front with a pleasant tangy bite at the back, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has a sparkling acidity, the hops pleasingly spicy; the dry long lasting aftertaste seals the deal, another fine beer from a superb brewery."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, good representation of style but seems to lean toward the Witbier style, good kick, nice beer to drink for an evening, but despite the qualities that make it different, I still might look for something else after a while."
"Would drink more if I found them"
"Didn't start out that well but a good beer overall."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. I don't get anything too compelling in this beer. The flavor seems absent, and certainly isn't complex or distinctive by any means. Safe to say I won't be picking this one up again."
"Not sure about this beer. Doesn't really have much flavor going on and leaves a ruddled gritty film on my tongue on the finish. Grassy light melon flavors thin mouth. Light spice and herbal quality, slight belgian yeast flavors. I guess these could be good on a warm day but otherwise something I'm not diggin."
"This beer was a little unique, it poured nice and light golden colored with a thin head. The smell was faintly of wheat but I focused more on the citrus, malt which was distinct for me. The taste was OK with no off flavors but overall a little light. There was some orange citrus along with some yeast and grass flavors. Drinkability and mouthfeel were good. This is a decent beer but nothing simply outstanding about it."
"All in all a good beer that I would gladly have again. Hey you pass me down that bottle!"
"drinkability is good. a simple and enjoyable beer with no noticeable flaws. went great with my burger and fries."
"Like I said, def. not for everyone, but I really did enjoy it. Very interesting, yet appropriate for spring seasonal. Kudos on a well-made beer and for trying something this adventurous!"
"Tastes great. Extremely light, finish closes pretty quickly with a grainy dryness. Not a lot of flavor in here, but incredibly drinkable. Herbal infousion flavors aren't very dicernable by my palette, but i think they are playing a big part in balancing this out given how little hop flavor is present."
"Thanks to Talisker for the extra! Pours a very pale straw yellow with a thin head. The aroma is of some pale malts and berries, but somewhat weak. The taste is almost like a Hefe-Weizen with slightly stronger hop presence. The berries provide an interesting aspect, however. The beer is light and crisp and you'd never guess it was 6.2%. This is a unique beer to say the least, just nothing spectacular."
"Went down smooth and easy. I recommend this on a hot day. Refreshing and tastey!"
"Slick mouthfeel with prickly carbonation. A little too complex for an all day/night affair. Interesting beer."
"D- The flavor is interesting and smooth but there is not really much character. The hops have a nice pungent musty hint that would be nice to taste more of in the finish."
"Mouthfeel was light. Medium/thin body."
"Good cold and would be a good session beer. Not the best from New Begium but not bad at all."
"D: I didn't care for this beer too much. It had an interesting taste but not one that I really could say I enjoyed."
"D: I bet this beer is down right downable on a hot summer day. Bit too sweet though for major pounding, think could really only do three or four in a sitting."
"Pours a light golden color with a very thin quick fading head. Not a lot of smell, slight citrus notes with a little bit of wheat/malt. Tastes a little sour up front with a lime flavor followed by the crisp wheat. Reminds me a lot of the new Spring Ale that Bluemoon/Coors is making. This beer is lighter and the flavors blend better. Not a bad beer but I much prefer their Wit over this."
"Kudos to New Belgian for making something interesting and creative. I wouldn't go out of my way to have this again, but I am glad I sampled it, and I can appreciate it for what it is."
"I had this on tap at the Denver airport. It was served too cold to get a good smell, I picked up bit of lemon. The body was cloudy yellow with a nice fluffy white head that left lacing all down the glass. The taste was tart, lemony with some orange and a herbal hop flavor to finish. It finished very dry and refreshing. It had a smooth creamy body. A very refreshing beer."
"The area where this beer really shines is in the drinkability department. This is light and easy to drink and an excellent choice for a brunch beer or a light lunch."
"Nice golden color with white head that leaves thin white lace from beginning to end. Smells clean and yummy. Fruity, citrusy? Nice clean taste, fruity and a bit of citrus. Very refreshing. Feels nice and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. Another fine beer by New Belgium. Wish I could get this here in Florida, I would love to enjoy it more often."
"This is highly drinkable in the sense that it is light and refreshing with a clean finish. However, the ABV is higher then you can taste, and it's not so tasty that you just can't get enough. Nice hot day bbq beer perhaps, although we don't really have those yet out west in the springtime, so for the season, I would've liked more umph."
"Interesting, but not one of NB best efforts."
"This is OK, I don't think I would get it again."
"This is sessionable, a little better on tap, not too tasty but easy to drink."
"Taste is sour and stale. Some hop bitterness at the end. Light in body and mouthfeel. I was very disappointed with this one since I like most other New Belgium offerings. I say pass on this one."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best before date on the label. Was a light golden color with very small head that quickly went away. The smell was very off-putting and had me worried. It's an exotic brew with Goji berries, Wormwood and Schisandra. Not sure which one dominated the smell but it was not good. The taste was horrendous. Again not sure which one is the culprit but disgusting. Very bitter and acidic from start to finish. The acidity actually gets worse after you drink and keeps on building. I don't mind bitter but acidic and whatever flavoring(s) are dominating ruin this. I love almost anything that NBB puts out but this one is terrible. I can't think of a single positive attribute to this one. Drain pour. Highly, highly don't recommend. (0, NA, ML, N)"
"D: Typical of the New Belgium Brewing traits that run throughout most of their brews. Quite tasty once you get used to hoppy flavor. Nice."
"Drinkability- Perfectly acceptable brew put out here from NB. Pretty much to style and very easy to drink. One of the better seasonal ones I've had."
"Overall, visually a dud for me. Scent almost resulted in a drain pour. Taste a bit better, but not something I'll be back for. I could be talked into trying it again, but...."
"Drinkability - This is an easy drinker no doubt, but I wonder how it will treat me near the end of my session... only one way to find out!"
"Mouth: Peach and cherry, cool bitterness that doesn't taste at all like hops, something I can't place, but similar to the skin between grapefruit sections. Probably due to one of the bizarre flavorants of this beer... Good malt body, some toastiness, pretty interesting. Goes down easy, but not too great. Mouthfeel is nice and carbonated, enjoyable."
"Drinkability- Perfectly acceptable brew put out here from NB. Pretty much to style and very easy to drink. One of the better seasonal ones I've had."
"A whiter shade of pale with a bountiful head. Nose is citrusy and very springlike and outdoorsy, with belgian esters aplenty. The taste is very saisonal and pleasing, but where's the gogi berries, and all the other Chinese spices that were supposed to be present? I would have given it a 4.5 otherwise... The mouthfeel is smooth, and the drinkability very high."
"Notes: Another odd beer from a brewer that seems to use a similar malt type in almost all of its offerings. This one I could enjoy partly because there is a delightfull fruitiness that is interesting and its crisp enough for a hot day. That being said its a beer I'll pass on."
"New Belgium always has some solid brews, this is just another example to add to the list. Recommended."
"Overall Impression: Definitely a different kind of beer. A nice one to sip while waiting to Spring Forward. New Belgium took a risk with this one, and I dig it. Not going to be my favorite beer, but Ill have no troubles with the 6 pack. Give it a shot!"
"I've been looking forward to trying this beer for a while, and finally picked up a bottle. Pours a bright cloudy straw yellow color. Little white head that setttles quickly. Smells a bit fruity, but not excessively so. That could be the Goji Berries perhaps? Also seems to have a bit of non hoppy sourness. Feels a bit thicker in the mouth than the color would lead you to expect, but that may be due to the oats used in the recipe. All around, this is a very drinkable, not overly sweet or sour, or bitter. A very well balanced brew. I'll have to definetly pick up some more of this. It's quite good!"
"Pale lemon gold with a slight haze. Chunky, bright white head that transforms into a puck of big bubbled foam, depositing bands of fine lace. Slow moving tails of carbonation rise. Aromas are light and of white fleshed fruits, a bit of lemon and a touch of spicy hops. The taste starts a bit sweet with a soft, smooth body. Some ripe pear flesh fills in the middle and an gentle herbal hop element carries through the finish which has a nice crispness that makes this highly drinkable. A lemon-citric tartness that is also slightly medicinal becomes evident as it warms slightly, further increasing the drinkability. Medium-light body with fine carbonation. The label indicates that Goji berries, wormwood, and schisandra were used, and while I have no idea what they specifically taste like, they worked well. Super sessionable."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poures a light straw, forming a very thin head, and leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma is a hint of light fruit, followed by the citrus aroma of the hops. The taste is exactly what I imagined the style would taste like. There is more of a sweetness to this style, with less of a bite from the hops. I makes for a smooth fruity citrus finish. Light mouthfeel. This is very enjoyable! I wouldnt mind having a few of these in one night. Definitely a style worth exploring."
"D: This one is fairly drinkable and it reminds me of a malty witbeer. The only thing I don't like is the very grainy finish after each sip. Nonetheless, it is a quality brew, and it's too bad it doesn't come out in the summer."
"Just picked up a six pack of Springboard at M&R Liquor in Carpinteria, CA USA and boy am I glad I did! Good good stuff! It's got a pale, hazy yellow body with not much of a head. The nose has a strong lemon scent. You'd expect a sharply sour acidic taste from the smell of it, but the flavor, while being heavy on the citrus side is not sharp or bitter at all. It's very smooth, like a grapefruit juice without the bitter tangy taste. Goes down super easy. Nice clean, crisp, refreshing drink. Great for the summer!"
"The taste of mild hops with a hint of grains was all I got out of this ale. It would have been better tasting, but, it was a little flat with hardly any bitterness. It lacked balance, for a pale ale. There was just something missing, but I can't put my finger on it!"
"Bright yellow in appearance with a 1 inch head. A slight tart or lemony smell with the usual smells of a lighter ale or lager. At first taste you get the flow of sweetness and refreshment that is Springboard. Next sip you get the complexity of this beer. It kinda fools you because each taste thereafter you get something different. Good lacing throughout. I was just thinking how much I enjoy the seasonal beers that are put out by NBB. FC is the place to be..."
"D: I wasn't a fan after the first bottle, but the second was a lot more enjoyable. I really liked the way the beer went through 3 distinct stages (tart to grainy to dry) over the course of each mouthful. Though I was wishing for a bit of sweetness at first, I came to realize that there just isn't any room for that in this beer."
"From a 12 oz bottle purchased from the North Coast Coop in Eureka, CA. Poured a cloudy light yellow with a large and very foamy white head that diminished fairly quickly and left moderate lacing. Nose is mostly hops, with a little citrus that seems mostly lemon or grapefruit, spices, and flowers. Body is surprisingly rich and flavor is a combination of hops and some odd spices I cannot identify. It is supposed to contain wormwood, and maybe that contributes to the sligthly bitter touch that does not seem like hops that shows in the finish. This is a very unique brew and if you approach it with that expectation it is OK. Basically this is a decent brew with a very unique bouquet and flavor . You have to give New Belgium credit for experimenting."
"Ill stick with the NB Saison."
"D - light and springlike, but not especially tasty or sweet, perhaps a good palate cleanser"
"Had a chance to sample this at a tasting at the home of Phatz and Grace. Poured from a 12oz. bottle a slightly cloudy pale yellow with a finger of white foam. Smells of spicy ginger root, coriander, and lemon. Tastes of lemony hops with a spicy, yeasty, mildly alcoholic note. Crisp and dry in the mouth with medium to moderate carbonation. Not really a beer I would hunt down, but worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a lively carbonation, and this is one easy to drink beer. Right now this is a pretty good brew. I think this beer would be better in the summer, especially after mowing the lawn/doing yard work."
"Drinks very easy, an interesting if not dead true style take on belgian PAs. A one they want to consider as a summer seasonal (vice skinny dip) as I believe this would go down like water during summer"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Good. I was very shock that I loved this beer so much. The first swallow was kind of odd. After a few more I realize that this was a prize winner in my eyes. I have already purchase more of this seasonal wonder."
"Crisp finish. Not a bad brew. Perhaps released a bit early in the year. I'd wait until the weather is a bit more constant (warmer, that is)."
"Drinkability: This beer isn't bad, for the style though I don't see where it was going. To me it's almost like a hoppy lager, like Sam Adam's Boston or something like that. Not a lot going on."
"Doesn't really stand out as far as drinkability goes. It's interesting, but in an...interesting sort of way, not an exceedingly tasty way."
"Hazy straw colour in the glass. Thick, fluffy and foamy white head, dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles. Pretty heavy lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is a mix of straw, yeast and pepper aromas. Grassy, lemon and spicy flavours. Pretty full mouth-feel. Finishes very dry with an odd lingering and bitter aftertaste. Worth trying, but probably won't be drinking a lot of it. May be better as a thirst quencher on a hot summer day then an early spring seasonal."
"D - A very tasty beer and unlike anything else I've ever had."
"This isn't the tastiest beer I have ever had, but I have to give credit to the amount of creativity in this beer that creates good complexity. It's a sweet and malty beer. Recommended."
"Highly recommended."
"Light/medium body with an effervescent feel. Easy to drink and refreshing."
"An exceptional beer, complex and refreshing. Nice dry finish. Great head and retention in the tulip glass. Nice yeasty aroma, banaa phenol. Taste is nice and has a lot of underlying complexities that are well balanced, a little cloviness. Good crisp mouthfeel and easy to drink."
"Neat beer. Kindof average all around, but the herbs in this beer aren't for the first time drinker, nor for those who don't like random herbs. Prost!"
"Pours out a hazy gold with tons of carbonation in the body, a thick, fluffy, eggshell head that forms plateaus and dips, and thick, raised lacing on the glass. Smell is a mix of pale malts, spicy yet subdued Belgian yeast, light stone fruits, lemon, and grassy hops. Taste is crisp, pale malts, some grain, some light fruit, herbs and spice. Finishes dry and the aftertaste is cracker-like. Mouthfeel leans toward full, which I guess could be attributed to the oats, and the carbonation is soft. Solid drinkability, but I don't think I could make a session out of this."
"I thought this beer seemed light and easy to drink. It was simple without being boring. In a way I like the way New Belgium are approaching their seasonals: not overpowering, easy to drink brews. Unfortunately I have yet to be truly ""wowed"" by anything they have come out with recently either. Definitely worth trying..."
"Last swigs: A little too spicy to be a session beer, but makes for a great beer to go with a spicy chicken or pork, I would imagine. A welcome change-up beer. Thanks to IntriqKen for the gift!"
"I'm not sure what this is...sort of a American Macro crossed with a Belgium pale. Strange. Not bad...just strange."
"""Ale brewed with Wormwood,Goji berries and Schisandra"" Well should be intresting as I have no earthly idea what these things taste like! Well the appearance is rather limp. Pale yellow with a frothy white head. Aroma is more livelly , with some ginger aspects, citric in character, and some fruity tones. Very balanced and unexpectedly ""thick"" flavours ,given the appearance. I suppose the oats lend to the slickness, and the herbs certainlly leave a strange medicinal/bitter flavour underneath. Weak hopping, though they do show up in the after taste. Rather odd and full on the palte, low carbonation. A rather strange beer, but I liked it. Quite drinkable. Actually reminded me a bit of ""Mateveza"" by Butte Creek, it was brewed with mate yerba."
"Purchase: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Best Before 15Jun07, so its good for quite sometime. Pours a slightly hazy golden color into my New Belgium globe glass. There is a huge white head that has good retention and good lacing. Aroma is of fruity yeast, sweet bananas, and a little spice. Taste is of sweet bananas and that Belgian funk, this gives way to a berry flavor, perhaps the Goji berries this is brewed with, although I am unfamiliar with this berry, also known as the Wolfberry according to my research, and there is a spice present throughout. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, although I would prefer a little less carbonation. This is definitely an easy drinker. Pretty soild effort from New Belgium."
"Bottom line: This is a very interesting and very drinkable example of the style that I (know* I'll drink more of. I recommend it!"
"12 oz. bottle- color of hazy yellow , with a frothy head - nose of I have no ideal what a goji berry smells like , however it has a crisp wheat nose  taste of wheat , hay , dry straw , lemon zest , and citrus hopps - body light , medium carbonation , and acidic  aftertaste of sour , and acidic long lasting"
"Overall Impression: Complex and layered, yet very drinkable. This beers flavor profile goes up a staircase of aromas, flavors, mouthfeels, and body  its like taking an amusement park ride! The beer mimics a journey through Spring  it starts out in front of a warm fireplace and ends up in a green fresh meadow. Heavy enough to drink in Feb, yet light enough to enjoy in April."
"Overall impression: Well balanced and highly drinkable - this one is a bit dangerous with session beer drinkability in a 6.2 ABV. I went through a growler of this one before it was released in bottles, and will probably make it through quite a few bottles this spring. When NB announced they were revamping the seasonals I was a bit worried - but so far they have impressed."
"Big thanks to gbontrag for this one!"
"Easy to drink, but the aftertaste is a bit unsettling, I don't know what it is, but I'm guessing it's one of those unique ingredients. Cheers to NB for going out and doing something different, and I'll probably have this one again, but I'm not 100% sure why."
"This is a drinkable beer. I don't know much about the style, but this beer is OK. Not the best of the New Belgium line I'm afraid. ABV is a little high is to be sessionable."
"Nice yellow edges and a center that was just slightly hazy in the glass. Head was big and bubbly but not too thick. The smell was light and refreshing with hints of apple, dried fruits, and almost a nutmeg. Mouthfeel was light and real wet but it begged to be swallowed quickly. It was hard to not drink the whole beer in one drink. Tastes are real mellow and hard to miss with the drinkabilty. Fruit is the first thing I can think of. It almost has a metalic taste to the back and it all blends well I supose. Another seasonal from New Belgium. I don't think I buy this beer but for the style I supose it is ok. Be careful - slow down - don't swallow the whole thing."
"Definately worth trying, but get a single instead of a sixer."
" Palate is light and herby. Up front a little bit of sweetness, imparted perhaps by the goji berries. Light herbs - wormwood (I guess), a little thyme - come through before the swallow, with a light citrusy finish. Body is rather spritzy and very refreshing. Wasn't sure how I'd like something like this, but I think it may be a great springtime thirst quencher. If only the weather would warm up a little while it's still on the shelves."
"D- It is very tasty and will probably buy a 6-pack of this when it comes out. I really wish I could taste all the things in it individually so I have a better idea of the flavors going on. All in all its a very interesting beer that is really easy to drink."
"Md body and mildly carbonated."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/foamy head which lasts alittle while, nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of malt, hops, yeast, and spices. According to the bottle ""Ale brewed with Wormwood, Goji berries and Schisandra"". The taste is crisp, slightly bitter, yeasty, spicy, and hoppy. Slightly dry finish. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice Belgian Pale Ale, would recommend."
