"As with Omer, it just doesn't seem to be my style."
""
""
"The first time I tried it I hated this beer. But than I tried it again and allowed myself to enjoy it slowly. Thats how I saw how tasty it is! It's as if in each bubble of carbonation there is a spice hidden inside"
""
"Full of flower all floor."
"Sensational... strength... taste... quality... Trappist sensibilities... Why the low marks people??? C'mon... This is amazing... I can taste a 1000 years culture in every sip..."
"Overall:  I enjoyed this beer.  I thought it was a good, somewhat commercial form of a typical Belgian blond."
"Brings back good memories of vol du nuit"
"Overall, not a bad beer by any means, but I prefer Duvel's slightly sour maltiness to the sweetness of this one."
"Overall - a tasty beer, though the Blonde label seems misplaced. Very drinkable, but not terribly complex"
"Rather ordinary Belgiam. Good, drinkable but nothing memorable."
""
"Nice and golden, frothy head. Taste is slightly off, smell's not too special. Nice carbonation."
""
"One of the best representatives of Belgian beers, but became too POPular in my country. There are much more better blond ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lite gold. Bright white head. Baked flowers nose. Clove taste. Overall, corporate Belgian meh..."
"Tastes rather blend. Nothing spectacular."
""
""
"Really didn't like this beer. It tasted a little off to me."
""
""

""
"3/9/15 (Bottle) - Blonde golden pour, mild carbonation, slight head build up. Citrus aroma dominates with hints of caramel and floral hops. Very sweet beer, perhaps too sweet, at least for my taste. Medium body with a smooth texture."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wife works for bud and brought this home from work..... hate it but I'm not much of Belgian guy anyways more of a stout and sour type guy. Though it looks great and pours good, it lacks a lot of quality"
""
""
""
"On tap. Had a nice golden color to it, but the beer is just way too darn sweet. Tastes too much like candy banana. Very sweet smell as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : Fresh and tasty, but a little too much for a pale ale, taste more like a wheat beer or tripel."
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
"Golden with nice head retention. Taste is bubblegum toothpaste, a little spicy like a winter ale but that Belgian yeast is overwhelming in this one"
"Tried a bottle of this a year ago and hated it but kept it around to see if age did anything. And this could be my palate changing but it isn't half bad. Nothing special here but a decent clove with a slight banana flavored beer. I remember the aftertaste being unpleasant before but now it is very smooth and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent lager. Great flavor. Not over powering.refreshing. Such a superior choice over run of th mill domestic. This is what the big breweries need to survive against the onslaught of craft breweries out there. This import competes nicely against local craft. An excellent beer. Readily available almost anywhere in major cities in the USA. Great go to choice when craft is just not available."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had high hopes for this Belgian beer...started out well with nice foam and good smell in the glass. Initial taste was good as well, very similar to a Chimay but not as refined. The aftertaste has something with it though, just can't tell what it is however. Certainly not as smooth on the finish at the initial taste though. Overall, I'll finish this 6 pack and chalk it up to experience."
"simply the standard Belgian beer"
""
""
""
"Nice foam head that stays, good amount of carbonation.  I detect a flavor of clove and a bitterish aftertaste.  Lingers with a semi sweet flavor.  Flavorful ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But smooth going down!"
"Beautiful blonde pour with fruits & spices on the nose.  Strong fruit & spice flavor reminiscent of a hefeweizen but with higher carbonation & bitterness."
""
""
""
"Not a fan but my wife really likes it!  Have been trying to get out of my HOPPcentric ways.  Seems to affect how beers w\o hopps taste and sometimes i'm to negative to them.  Now i've decided to just drink more of the styles at a time to compare.  Cheers to more tasting!"
"This beer has too much residual sweetness for my taste.  There are a lot of flavors but they don't meld well and the unrelenting sweetness is a distraction."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not good. At all."
""
""
""
""
""
"I Pop!ped the cap and gave it a good pour into a chalice (although not a Leffe), forming two fingers of dense, eggshell-white head with great retention. Color was Amber (SRM = > 7, "
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a beautiful, crystal clear, bronze color with a full, soft white foamy head.  Nice aroma and a slightly sweet, intensely floral taste.  Pairs well with a light pasta."
"Pours with a large foamy head. Yeast and bread on the nose, with banana, bubblegum and clove right across the palate. Would have to be a small beer list for this to be my first choice though, doesn't show a great deal of quality."
"Looked pretty good smelled great but taste was ""meh"" a little sweet for my taste and didn't taste well with a burger. All in all I wasn't a fan it was just too sweet for a blonde and I are a burger with it and the taste still lingered.  Tasted like I was drinking a weak perfume."
""
"Not terrible, not my favorite."
""
"Solid begin blonde. It was priced well."
""
""
""
"Starts off nice with subtle sweetness.   Nice aroma.   As go on sweetness becomes a bit to much.   Works when drinking one or two when paired with food."
""
"Overall: The overall experience feels too clean and processed for a Belgian blonde. I would not recommend this one."
""
""
""
"Ok beer kind of flat"
""
""
"Definitely not a great, not a nice taste or feel."
"I prefer beers which dont have that strong malty taste and this is a good example of that.  Thin lacing, soft and pleasing aroma, an easy to drink beer that goes down without much of a ""Bite"" on your tongue."
""
"How have I not reviewed this beer years ago?  Readily available, cost effective, and delicious.  11.2oz bottle served in a chalice.  Best before 19/02/16.  Aroma is mild but hints of Belgian yeasty goodness.  Color is brilliant gold in color.  Flavor is on the sweet side of balanced, with a distinctly Belgian Candi sugar note.  Secondary flavors are of grass, ripe fruit, and of course clove.  But all are subdued.  This Belgian blonde is more drinkable than it is complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, a little strong on the clover (or whatever the spice is).  It's Christmas in a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Honestly, this one sat in my fridge for several months before I finally pulled the trigger. I'm not a huge fan of Belgian ales in general but beers like Leffe prove that it is possible to appreciate any style. The nuances in Leffe's flavor make all the difference. Would I drink it again? Sure."
"04/24/13 At home. In bottle. Full bodied Belgian. Substantial flavors. The yeast are bready & the finish is citrus. Not for everyone, so there'll be more for me."
""
""

""
""
"I had this immediately after giving a poor review to Stella Artois. By comparison, this one was much better. At least it had a sweet taste and aroma that was pleasant enough. Ultimately however, it did not have much bite to it. A pretty plain beer and nothing special. I first had this beer in Brussels of all places many years ago and thought I was being worldly. Sadly, this was before I got into craft beer. When I think back on all the amazing Belgian beers I could have enjoyed on this trip, I kick myself."

"Overall: Decent Belgian ale. There's a lot of great Belgian beer available domestically these days, which makes Leffe seem a little unremarkable, but it's a decent beer for a fair price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty solid taste"
""
""
"Of the major Belgian expert beers, this one is very approachable. Though the Belgian candy sugar does give it a sweet savor, it tastes dry enough to be good with all but the spiciest foods (at which point it vanishes into the background). I get a little nuance of orange peel and coriander, and it pours with a respectable head."
""
""
""
""
""
"While not a remarkable beer by any stretch, Leffe is quite a good beer.  It's not going to make you forget Duvel  any time soon, but it's certainly pleasant and easy-going.  Could also be a good baseline starter example for someone just starting to explore the Belgian Ale family, for just those reasons."
""
""
""
""
"Leffe Blonde is a beer for a wide-range of palates and enjoyably drinkable. Cheers!"

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18A). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 49 20:02. AROMA: sweet malty background with spicy aromas, reminiscent of honey-like or caramel. faint orange notes. no hop aromas noticeable. APPEARANCE: gold color and translucent. large creamy white head with good retention. pronunced lacing. TASTE: smooth light sweet malt background. low bitterness in the aftertaste. finishes semi-sweet. no hop flavours discernible. PALATE: creamy and medium body. high carbonation. OVERALL: a belgian blond ale without much complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a gold translucent color; 1.5 inch foamy head; slight lace on glass. Retention could've been better. Smelled like coriander, banana and clove. The taste consisted of banana, sweet malt, spice, coriander, and a dominant clove aftertaste; dry aftertaste. The body was on the moderate side, with a seltzer water feel which made it somewhat boring, but it was okay for a mass produced Belgium beer."

"Really mediocre for a beer that ought to have been perfected by the only country to have been brewing it for literal millenia, but alas, there are better Belgian Blondes out there."
"Creamy and long-lasting foam, protecting the trail of scents and allowing sipping liquid interesting effect. Different hops, but the cost-benefit in Brazil..."
""

"Overall kind of ""meh"" for a BPA"

"Overall – The after taste is very sweet and it does tend to linger a lot longer than you would want it too. Still, the second glass is a lot nicer than the first, which I put down to the strength numbing the taste buds, so if you plan on drinking this over a day it is not completely awful. It is well spiced and probably a good example of the style but it is not to my liking. Sorry to the people at Leffe!"
"This is a drinkable but not outstanding beer and as a lighter beer is susceptible to handling issues. When fresh, a decent alternative to industrial lager. When old, which is often, it picks up wet cardboard flavors which dull the fruits."

"So would I recommend it ? Absolutely YES !"

"Mouthfeel: Medium slightly syruped body. Medium to medium high carbonation. Some dryness to the mouthfeel. No flavors or even the mouthfeel last for that long."
""
""
"Today I had a glass of Leffe with pasta, with red sauce and chicken breast. Surprisingly, it paired amazingly well. The sensation and aftertaste were absolutely great. I'll definitely try to repeat this combination."

"Served into a medium glass from a 330ml bottle. There is a lot of foam, lacing, stays for a long time... The colour is amazing, is darket than a regular lager, is thick that's present. Taste delicious, very malty, honey straight away, sweet some lemon aftertaste, I can't describe that amount of shapes and surfaces on a drink. I makes me, I don't need more, maybe an hamder average but it stills ok is 6.6% wowww. Very drinkable beer with the propper belgian flavour and carbonation, never say no to this trendy choice!!! Njoy"
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a decent sized bubbly bone white head that slowly dissipates. Aromas of bready sweet pilsner with a touch of floral hops and a solid shot of pepper and yeasty esters. The flavor is rich and sweet with hints of orange and sweet bread. Peppery yeasty with a bit of spice rounds out the flavor quite nicely. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a spicy bubbly mouthfeel. That is a pretty nice Belgian right there, I'm surprised I haven't tried this before."

"A bready and slightly malty beer. Pours pretty clear with an average head. There is a slight offness to the taste and I cannot determine what it is. Overall a good beer that I would drink but not buy. Give it to me and I will drink it. Not bad overall, slight fruit comes around ever so slightly over the bready, yeasty taste"

"I really like this beer. It's a light golden Belgian with a white head that runs pretty quick. The smell I liked a lot with a lot of wheat and sweet smells. The taste was what I liked the most. Flavors of banana bread and a little bit of mint from the Belgian wheat. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, even for a Belgian white but I still really like this beer. The availability and price arn't too bad either."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very popular (or marketed well) in Belgium. it is served in almost every cafeteria or restaurant. I had these before on-tap, and in my memorie they are better that way, a more coherent and fresher flavour. I don't like the thickness of this brew."

"This is a Belgian light beer, very crisp to the taste. Strong smell of cloves. Very nice aftertaste, clear and just bubbly enough, feels nice going down. A great beer for conversation and slow burn. One of my top 5 Belgian beers, my first choice being Stella."
""
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/17/2015. Pours lightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange peel, pear, apple, banana, honey, biscuit, bubblegum, herbal, floral, clove, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange peel, pear, apple, banana, honey, biscuit, bubblegum, clove, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Light amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange peel, pear, apple, banana, honey, biscuit, bubblegum, clove, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of pale malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great yeast/malt flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian pale ale. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of pale male and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: A very pleasant and clean beer. Many seem to call it ""simple", but this beer has a lot of character for a ""blonde"". There is a harmony of subtle flavors at play--not easy to pull off. In that respect, it's far from just ""simple""."
""
"O: I wish that this beer was available on tap in more of my local bars, because it would be my constant go-to beer. It's a light, belgian blonde with some quality elements of the big players but a lighter taste at an awesome price. I'd recommend this one also to anyone new to this particular style of beer. It's a great everyday beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Good in pinch."
""

""

"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. I was initially greeted by a massive amount of light beige head threatening to billow over the top of the glass, although this settled down quickly to reveal a dark gold liquid with light bronze highlights. Smells buttery, nutty, with some low-key Belgian yeast spice and vinous fruit top notes. Less assertive aroma than other Belgians but has the right characteristics, with some saison and tripel like features although more mellow than either. Palate is quite sweet, light, and fruity, again with middling spicy phenols and heavy carbonation. I get sweet shortbread and butterscotch coupled with faint carbolic wine, orange or perhaps unripe peach or apricot, banana, pear, and a decent dose of subtly minty, grassy, palate-cleansing hops. The bubble gum taste that others detect isn't up front to me, although I do start to notice this effect later as the fruit flavors start to meld together. Thin-bodied and moderately boozy. This would make a great ""starter Belgian"" or introduction to the style for beginners. While it is less bold in flavor than many, there's enough complexity and Belgian yeast character to adequately convey the style and provide an enjoyable experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"The color is deep golden with a thick white, creamy head. The smell is nearly nonexistent. The taste is acceptable but very mild with subtle hints of orange and cream. The mouthfeel is tinny and carbonated. Overall it is a decent, but forgettable beer."
"O: Not to bad. Better on a hot day. There is a good deal going on with this beer as far as smell and flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Nice and decent, although not my favourite. Luckily plenty other Leffe beers to try."
"Grew on me a little as I had a few more but still not something I would buy again."

"While I haven't tried nearly all the beers of this style, I can't imagine them being much better than this one. To me this beer has a near ideal balance of sweetness, light hop bitterness, esters, & spiciness flavor. The smell is banana, clove, & bubblegum while the appearance is a clear, medium gold. I must admit that I find this beer to be better than most that have reviewed it, but that is OK as it is staple in my refrigerator."

"Overall: A tad simplistic for experienced drinkers of Belgian styles, but remains flavorful, refreshing, and true to style. Something simple that I would recommend to a ""beer newbie."" Sessionable and easy to find on the shelves--something I would pick up on my way to a spring or summer group picnic."

"Pours a crisp clear dark yellow with a frothy white head. Smell is yeasty and light, subtle sweet. Taste is as crisp as the look, clean and yeasty, some sweetness, a nice balance of flavors, very nice on the palette. Nice smooth medium mouthfeel. Overall a well balanced beer, a bit sweeter then what I like, but still very tasty. A well done beer."

"Easy to drink, flavorful Belgian beer. It's fruity but not over the top. I wouldn't mind drinking this all the time. Smooth as hell with some flavor. I don't need much else. Well played. Moderate carbonation and fairly dry. Clear and dark yellow in color."

"Very yeasty with a slightly sweet finish. Very full flavored with good mouth feel. Nice bubbles. Alcohol at 6.6 is very well hidden. Somewhat like a wheat beer. Very good beer for the price.

"find the cheapest, nastiest malt liquor. Pour some in an open bucket. Get a dead mouse. Drop it in. Catch 6-8 live cockaroaches. Throw them in. Stomp and kill 3-4 more cockaroaches. Throw them in. Let this sit out in 90 degree heat for 5 days (cover if rain approaches). Pour it back in the bottle, being careful to spill as much as possible, and put it in the refrigerator. Never ever drink it. Give it to the beersnobbiest person you know and tell them it's the newest high dollar Belgian thing. Just watch and listen. They will swirl it around, think for a moment, and tell you it's much like Leffe Blonde, only better."

"I found myself enjoying this one less and less as I drank more and more. A lot of welcome Belgian characters to speak of, however, I think they could have been executed better. Worth a try, so long as you are away of the sweetness within."

"Overall - I know it seems like I'm bashing this beer a bit, but my memories of he first time I had this beer were amazing. This was before I had investigated many styles and was even willing to try some beers. Upon a second reflection and reevaluating this beer, I come to recognize that it is still a very tasty beer, just not as good as good as others in the style I think it's the overall sweetness of the beer and lack of counterbalancing that creates this effect. However, if you're looking for beers to offer to friends to try to get them to expand their horizons this might be an option."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite beers. Mostly I was surprised by how much flavor it had for such a light beer. It's a clear honey color, can smell a little hops but it smells a lot like banana. It has a light wheat and banana taste. (I know there are no bananas in it) The fizz on the tongue is refreshing. A good summer beer."

"Sparklingly clear gold with a small, creamy looking white head that settles to a bubbly topping. Clean, sweet grain, honey, Belgian yeast and pale dried fruit aromas.

"Tastes a bit malty or doughy with banana, clove and some pepper spice. Perhaps a bit tame for such a brilliant aroma, I still find it wonderfully coy.

"O-I like sweet, fruity, Belgians as much as the next guy, but this brew lacks hop balance and the mouthfeel leaves a little something to be desired. What one gets is a slightly hot, fruity sweet jumble of flavors that don't seem to integrate with one another. Are the worse beers out there?Definitely, but with so many great Belgian pales/blonds, this is not one that I would seek out again."
""

"Poured into a tulip. Deep golden color and super thick, off-white, foamy head. Smell is belgian yeast with a hint of banana peel. Lace sticks around thickly. Malty sweetness on the tongue with Belgian yeast and a tad of booziness. A little bit of a smoky, woodsiness in the middle. Quick bitterness on the back and dry to slightly sweet aftertaste. Lacks the level of bitterness of other Belgian blonds like Duvel or Piraat. Light to medium mouthfeel and fairly carbonated. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
""
""
""
"Pours a five finger white head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Honey and clove nose, flavor is flowery, honey and cloves. $7.99 for a 6-pak 330ml bottles from Market Basket Concord, NH."
""
"Overall - Yes; I know this is an InBev product (I knew something was up when I saw it on tap at a recent Angels game). Regardless, I like this beer. This beer has that Belgian sour flavor that we all love so much (and at a price mere mortals can afford). Lets refer to Leffe as ""Belgian for Beginners."""

"Overall- A well balanced, good tasting beer. The flavor reminds me of a cross between wit and a hefeweizen."
"Light golden colour with pretty good head retention and lacing, smell has some fresh apple, yeasty and lemon notes, banana bread. Taste has a clean feel, sweet apple, and stone fruit, light plum, lot of crisp malt, a firm bready yeastiness, a touch of warming pepper on the finish. Balance is pretty good but not much depth here. A refreshing yeasty bite though. Mouthfeel is full with a fair bit of carbonation, light mild bitter finish, finish is a bit messy. Overall its a refreshing easy drinking Belgian pale, fresh and fruity, but not that complex, not inspiring but drinkable."

"Excellent cost benefit, especially speaking about Brazil given Ambev scale and reach. Even compared to some nationals that tried to produce Belgian Ales, this one likely has a better quality and with half price. Unfair if compared to the top Belgian range, anyway try it in blind tests compared to the low or even medium range, so keeping aside the prejudice we have against the big companies (including myself once they usually contribute to a bad beer education)."

"Lots of carbonation obscures the flavor profile at first. Is this a belgian? Weird yeast and carbonation thing going, herbal tea. A sweeter malt taste finally hits back against the different yeast and herb mouthfeel. Tastes like fusel alcohol too. Could use more two row just to beef up the body, there's too many different flavors that come across as just unconventional (to put it nicely) to ever enjoy this, especially at its relative high price point. Totally meh to me."

"Overall very quaffable, and well crafted despite being a touch on the sweet side. The middling characterless nature of the ale is not surprising given the involvement of Anheuser Busch, though it is tasty despite the lack of bottle conditioning."
"(3.25) D: Leffe was my gateway beer into belgian styles, and into good beer in general, and without that experience who knows where I'd be now (in a ditch somewhere?). It’s interesting now doing a review of it. It’s a decent belgian strong and a great introduction into the style."
"I'm growing to love this beer - it may not be as complex as many other examples of the style, but at £4 a 4-pack it's definitely one of the best-priced beers available in UK supermarkets, and in my view the most enjoyable."
""
""
"This beer pours up a medium gold with a wonderful foamy, fluffy head, legendary retention, and lacing the likes of which is not often seen. The smell is kind of yeasty and maybe a little putrid. Taste is very yeasty and dry with apple notes being the predominant flavor. Mouthfeel is simple and inoffensive. Nothing awesome here, but hardly the worst beer ever brewed."

"I drank this straight from the bottle. The smell is light and fruity, appealing. It has a light feel to it with a strong taste on the way down. Definitely strong fruit taste. It is well carbonated and was a quick, refreshing drink. This is above average but not something I would drink regularly."

"update: yep, it musta been around christmas. i cant say the taste is a 4.5. let's drag it down to a 4.25 and leave it at that. it looks pretty in my glass, but i'm not sure i should have given it a 4.5 there either. i AM very generous with my ratings, however. if it's decent and gets me there, i usually dont deduct a whole lot. and that makes my ratings top-heavy. but it's too late to go back and change them all now. i've had some good ones and my preferences change, but usually after a few (or a bj) i get soft and the whole world is just good. i cant help it...."

"Very crisp, clean, and refreshing beer. I usually like some darker Belgians, but this is a nice change of pace. It has the standard fruity Belgian taste with a decent amount of carbonation that leaves a somewhat spicy aftertaste. There are better Belgians out there, but this one is not bad at all. One of ""The Brothers"" has this beer rated at a 2.2. That is worse than Budweiser. I find that ludicrous."

"-Overall 4.0: A very good golden ale that is readily available and relatively cheap (I paid $7.99 for a six pack at Publix in Atlanta). The flavor profile is comparable to Belgian ales that are only available at specialty beer providers and are much more expensive. This is a wonderful find for fans of Belgian beers who are not willing (or able) to invest in an expensive bottle of Belgian master-brewing, but want that delicious Belgian taste."

"This is a Belgian Pale Ale , a collaboration between Inbev and the Abbey De Notre Dame de Leffe. If it matters to you whenever you purchase this ale (as with all abbey ales) some of the money goes to the monks who brew it. This isn't my favorite BPA it lacks that Belgian yeast/funk flavor and its slightly too sweet for my taste. This could be due possibly to the fact that it's brewed with corn. The flavor is a lot less complex that one would expect for a Belgian. Its a great drink none the less (especially for its price a bomber was $5). I recommend it, above average but not great."
""
"Leffe Blonde, my gateway into the wonderful world of golden Belgian ale. I have no idea why this is classified as a ""Pale Ale"" as there's nothing pale about this full-bodied beauty. Pours a nice golden hue into a Duvel tulip-glass. A bit heady which dies down much too quickly with light lacing. Smell is tart, bright and slightly clovey like a German Weizenbock. Mouthfeel is mellow carbonation and no trace of alcohol even though it's 6.6% alcohol. Tastes slightly sweet with a nice interplay of sweet yeasts against tart hops, leaning more sweet at first sip, almost like it's a Weissbeer with identify problems. Finish is smooth and you can't wait to take another sip. Now that Leffe is distributed everywhere these days (even my local WalMart has it), it's a great value for those seeking a nice, slightly-complex golden Belgian on the cheap."
""
""
""
"O-A run of the mill BPA, nothing offensive, a decent beer to give to someone who doesn't care for beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my first choice at all, but credit were due. I personally don't care for the overwhelming clove flavor."

"Overall I thought this was a goof beer and an above average example of the style, it was full of flavor with the Belgian yeast really dominating all aspects of this brew. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth, but the higher amount of sweetness and stickyness would prevent me from having a bunch, three in a sitting is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was it's appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good with lots of nice head and a pretty bold aroma. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness and the slightly sticky mouthfeel, if the sweetness was a toned down a little it would for sure improve this beer. I would buy this beer again when looking for something cheap and flavorful but I don't think I will be keeping it in the fridge that often, I recommend giving it a try, it may make for a good gateway into the style. All in all I thought this was a good beer for what it was and it was a much better choice then all the other beer available at that store, this is one solid Belgian Blonde."
"O - A great Belgian beer. Sweet and just what you look for to compliment that yeast. One of my go-to's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Booooring. This is like a macro Belgian that has mass appeal by being very basic and inoffensive. It's yeasty and crisp. Mild fruity notes, etc. I see this beer featured in Belgian Beer classes at the Total Wine over here and I guess it should be there because it is famous and a decent introductory Belgian, but for me, if I'm looking for a Belgian, I'm looking for a bigger one. If I'm looking for something lighter, I'm going with a lager or something I can session. As such, Leffe doesn't work for me."

"Golden with some white sheet and excellent clarity. Smells like standard belgian yeast with some metallic tones and a bit of banana and petunia. Pretty uneventful nose. Flavor is buttery with banana and some soil along slight coriander and bits of belly button lint. Medium bodied with mild carb and a slicking finish. Not impressed with this and will likely not visit again."

"This beer is not too bad. It's certainly not the best Belgian pale/blonde I've had, but I would say that it is a average to above average for the style. The head is good. The aroma is quite good--very pronounced bubble gum. I like that. The initial taste is good. Very good fruit flavor--reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum. The aftertaste is the problem. It is definitely a little funky. I can't quite put my finger on it. It has a great fruity start, a pretty pleasant bite in the middle, then a funky aftertaste that brings to mind artificial sweetener. The aftertaste sticks around for quite a while, so it makes you forget the better aspects of the beer. It gets better as it warms up, but it still retains that peculiar, bitter, and slightly metallic aftertaste. I will try this beer a couple more times. Perhaps pairing it with some cheese will help."

"Great brew, citrus with a nice sweet hops taste. Aroma is amazing. Super refreshing and easy to drink, great for Texas summer entertaining. If you are after a great and very consistent summer ale you found it here. I travel a lot through Europe and this beer is always consistent. Even back home in Texas a 6 pack of bottles tastes as expected and I have had several Leffe's in Brussels. Something you can't say about all Europeans beers."

"O: A nice beer. Enjoyable and different than mainstream macros and the usual craft beer selections. However, I do truly hate that this beer is now owned by InBev. While I like it, I think I'll probably avoid it for the most part. I give most of the credit that some Belgian brewery came up with the recipe only to later be bought out by the evil giant."
""
""
""

"I purchased both the blond and the brown at the same time, and again was impressed with the straw clear color, and healthy white head that left lacing all the way up the glass. The citrus and carbination made this a refreshing beer. I preferred it over the brown- which suprised me. The beer is one of the cheaper exports from Belgium, and while not amazing, is pretty good."

"Final Grade: 3.41, a serviceable B-. This is a decent brew, but not an exceptional one. I am glad I bought this as a single, because while I could probably drink 6 of these, I could also easily find better beers to spend that money on. Due to the fact that Leffe Blonde is balanced, not complex, and has an agreeable flavour, I might actually recommend this to a newbie looking for a relatively easy-to-find BPA - but I wouldn't count on this stuff impressing a lot of seasoned BAs. In short - it's worth a try, but not something to go out of your way for."

"Overall: It's probably not the most exciting beer out there, nor is it my favorite one. But it's a beer i can easily drink any day. It's very easygoing with a full, sweet and maltiness flavor with a light bitter to give it some more depth and balance. It's the sweetness that's leading though. The biggest problem might be it's too full tasting to be a refreshing beer, and lacks depth to make it a really interesting one. But very enjoyable and easy to drink nonetheless."
""
"Been a while since i tried this but i thought why not give it a shot and pours a clear golden sunset hue which leaves a creamy three finger head and lacing all over the place,the smell is spicy cloves,bready yeast,a touch of bananna and fresh peaches,the mouthfeel is light bodied and lighter than i expected but easy enough to knock back and has tastes of bready belgian yeast,cloves,herbal eartrhy hops and finished with that bready belgian yeast that dominates and overall the vieux temps yeast used definately dominates and its abit sweet for me but an easy enough session brew."

"Starts off dry, with light toasted malts. Apple and powdered sugar malt follow. Yeast comes in, bringing some more dryness. Slightly spicy, peppery hop bitterness as well. Lingering mildly sweet apple and waffle cone. Some residual yeastiness and bitterness. Moderate body with a not-quite-bottle conditioned feel. Not bad; kind of like a Duvel light, but not nearly as good."

"Nothing I seek out. I prefer it on-tap at the Sharp Edge in its appropriate glassware. I also prefer the Brune. 3.5"

"This beer does lack the balance of softness and firmness that is the beauty of Belgian beers. It's too spritzy at first, which eventually calms down. It is lightly crisp and after time gets smooth, so that while for some beers this could be a pretty good mouthfeel, it's nothing special here."

"O - This is an excellent introduction to BPA's for those who have yet to explore the realm. There is much that one could improve with this beer, but I may find myself purchasing a few more given the proper time and place."

"Like others have said, it's a good way to introduce people to the world of Belgian beer, but compared against the rest of the plethora of Belgian beers, it falls flat."
""

"This beer looks great after the pour, with a golden, light orange-yellow color beneath a massive, fluffy, meringue-like, eggshell-colored head. The aroma is light but pleasant, with a musty yeast character at first that gives way to a combination of light biscuity malts and some bright grassy/floral characteristics. The flavor is similarly a combination of biscuits, grass, and dried herbs. The medium body and light, fine carbonation let this one linger in the aftertaste longer than I'd prefer, though. Overall, this beer is light and drinkable yet has some substance."

"Could have used more zest, flavor, or smell. It's pretty mellow. Not much exciting about this beer but it's not a bad one to try."
""
""
"Decent and a standard to be met."
"The finish is rather slick on the palate yet clean. If you are familiar with Belgium ales, they tend to be unfiltered and more pungent in the fruit aromas. Either way, this ale went down easy, but I have had much better."
""

"Overall this beer was semi sessonable and cheap for its style. There were some off flavors that detracted from the enjoyment of the beer and that prevented it from obtaining a higher score."
""
""
""
"Flavor is sweet at first, but smooth, and followed by a peppery, almost fruity finish. This is a subtle and tasty brew, and a solid middle-level introduction to the wonders of Belgian-style ales."

"Well, there's really nothing interesting to say about Leffe. It's definitely better than most of the crap that's out there, but compared to other Belgians it's not that great. Its a more watered down, 'Americanized' version. The head is almost non-existent, which is not at all characteristic of this type of beer. I smell lots of yeast, some malt, not too bad I guess. The taste is watery. Thumbs down there. Overall, I can say I will buy this again, but only because there won't be anything else to choose from."
""
""
"A okay take on the style, always liked the darker leffe better"
""
""
""
"O: overall not bad, though for a Belgian ale this is not one of the top tier from that country. I'd drunk it again if at another restaurant abroad that has a meager choice, but wouldn't recommend to be sought out."
""
""
"O-nothing special here, too sweet and overall not a stellar example of this style"
""
""
"Started off decently but the sweetness grows a ton. Just doesn't do it for me because the fruit and yeast flavors are decent but don't get past the cloying sweets."
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes of banana bread with a lighter flourish of Belgian fruity esters and a garnish of earthy / spice noble hops blending together quite nicely. Actually, the flavor is slightly weaker than I would have expected from the intensity of the nose. Body is somewhat thicker than expected as well, a full round medium body with -just- not quite enough carbonation to keep the body from feeling heavy and tired in the mouth. A few minor tweaks to body and flavor and this beer could become absolutely stellar."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable beer. While lacking in tasty deliciousness, the smell and mouthfeel of the beer alone far make up for this. It's not that it tastes bad, just not as superb as other belgians. I will buy more."
""
""
"O - Priced at $2.50 for a 750mL from the local Albertson's, I bought 2 bottles and enjoyed them while working in the yard. A solid, all around beer and one that I sue as a suggestion for those lookng to graduate into a Belgian style beer. A good choice for those looking to moe from a good lager or blonde ale into a Belgian style."

"O - At a high abv, for me, this beer is very easy to quaff. I enjoy the flavor because it has complexity yet is not overpowering. Could easy drink a few of these. It's not an amazing beer, it's a more sessionable good beer."
"O: Ok, will try again when it's fresher and colder."
""
"D - A nice Belgian ale that's simple and easy to drink. I remember having a bottle of this back when I was first getting into craft beer a number of years ago, and being rather put off by it. I'm happy to say this was a much more enjoyable experience."

"Drinking it in Lebanon, and was poured into a typical beer mug. Great light golden colour, creamy white head that did not last very long. Hints of fruity goodness in the aroma. Nice light feel on the mouth, not over carbonated, and sweet taste. No overly bitter after taste."
""
"An okay belgian pale ale but was hoping for a bit more."
""
"O-This is nice drinker with some nice flavors to it. Bought a single and am glad I did. Not sure I'll ever buy it again though with so many other options of Belgians out there.."
""
""
"I bought this beer because I was attracted to the looks of it. The head on this beer was a light color that wasn't very thick, the smell on the other hand was fruity and rich with a sweet taste. The mouthfeel was very fulfilling with a kind of fizzy bitter aftertaste."
"Overall: This isn't as bad as I originally thought it was, but it is still a wildly divergent and almost mass-market version of a cool very belgian style. Not recommended"
""
""
"O- pretty nice beer, a fair bit on the smell that you get when you taste it, but on the taste it comes through a bit weaker."
"Had tons of these on tap in Brugge, as it's served there like Budweiser is here in the States and I really enjoyed the hell out of it - drinking glass after glass throughout the afternoons moving on to bigger beers in the evening, but man this stuff does not translate the same in the bottle. Too sweet and spice ridden and it only seemed to get worse as it warmed up. I think i'll wait till the next time im in Belgium to revisit this one."
"Gold and very yellow in apprearance. Smell is quit typical of you ero brews. Mouthfeel is very champaigeny with lots of bubbles. The taste is very typical of a Belgian Pale Ale, one that is average. Very wheat and yeast heavy in taste. Overall this a good Belgian if that is your type of beer, although we have had better."

"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of Belgian yeast, grain, spices, and some banana. Taste is of grain and banana up front with spice and yeast flavors coming through more on the aftertaste. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a light carbonation with a crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice light flavor that is very easy to drink."
"A full flavored BPA for sure. It's sweet but not cloying and well rounded. I really like this. Recommended."
"Poured, from a bottle 300 ml. Gives a deep yelloy colour, with a two-finger head.. Aroma is fruity and quite pleasant,something between bananas and ..bubblegum? As carbonated as it is needed. Taste is fruity also with a bit of alcohol and leaves you with a bitterness. Overall, a quite nice beer."

"Orange amber in color with medium thick white head with decent retention, it gradually recedes then left plenty of lacing patches, medium carbonated. The smell is caramel malted, honey, molasses and lightly toasted hint. Caramel malted and molasses sweetness also appear in the flavor with alcohol fusel touch through palate and some kick of hop bitterness to balance. The body is medium with smooth mouthfeel. Overall, on tap is still good and enjoyable with more balance between sweetness and bitterness portion than in bottle."

"a little thick which isnt a bad thing, looks can be decieving"
"o: very drinkable and enjoyable, especially on sale for 1 euro, but it has an eventual blandness to it that I don't get from other Belgians of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought it was ok. Smell was better than the taste. Taste was only as good as the head. The rest of the beer had too much sweetness for me. I think this beer would do well to reduce the beta rest temperature or if they use decoction maybe pull a thinner portion of the mash...just a thought. Wouldn't be likely to buy from store."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with a fluffy white head that resembles a marshmallow. Excellent lacing and retention, but I typically prefer a more translucent bottle conditioned appearance. Unmistakable traditional Belgian smell. I could make out a bready malt aroma with hints of citrus, clove and spice. This ale has a well balanced complex taste full of citrus, spice and sweet malt with very low bitterness present. I really enjoyed the soft sweetness, and crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Medium to full bodied and very filling with medium carbonation. The finish is spicy and sweet. I could see how some might find it too sweet, but I really liked the variation on the style."
""
""
""
""
"One finger white head over deep gold body, quick dissipation with acceptable lacing, multiple rising streams of carbonation. Nice nose, coriander and orange peel. Taste mirrors nose, medium sweetness balanced by good dose of coriander. Medium mouthfeel, good effervescence. Enjoyable, just not that memorable."
""
"Overall- A well-balanced and highly enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"O- I guess my palate is not refined enough to bash this beer. I found it to be tasty and delicious. There are Belgian beers I favor over this one, but this is still a good beer and worth a try. Some reviews make this beer out to be as bad as the mass produced crap found in the US or Australia, but I think they are dead wrong. It may not be a trappist beer, but it’s not too bad on the palate"
""
""
"This beer poured out as a hazy golden color with a white head on top. The smell of banana, spices and grains on the nose here. There might even be some citrus in there too. The taste of the beer was a little off in my opinion. Whatever it was it just wasn't working for me. The mouthfeel was decent, it was lightly carbonated, light bodied and smooth. Overall this beer was decent but the flavors just weren't all that good to me."

"Taste is much better than the smell. A little bit of Belgian spice, not too much. Some malty sweetness, but again, not a lot. This is a pretty smooth beer. It's not offensive, but also not spectacular. There's not really a lot going on. I'm not an expert on Belgians but this is certainly near the bottom of the list from the ones I've had, though, it's not bad, either. It's better than Stella, that's for sure!"

"I enjoyed this at first. The more I drink it, the less I like it. The sweetness builds on the palate and the yeast gets to be old. If It's this or a beer that ends in ""Lite", then I'll take this. Otherwise, give me something else."

"a great belgian blonde, slightly overpriced here in the states, but a worthy brew. pours clear and shiny sun colored, with a lcy white head a few inches high. smells yeasty, golden fruity like raisins or white peaches. taste is a little sweet but very delicate and balanced. no discernable hop flavors, but thats okay in this style. mouthfeel is pleasant and quite light. excellent with seafood or fine cheeses. also very sessionable due to its unique flavors and light mouthfeel (and small bottles). still prefer the red to the blonde though"
""
""

"Overall- A totally nice beer. A little muddled, and no longer a favorite, but pretty nice. Often able to find it in bars without much selection, and a perfectly reasonable port in a storm."

"Leffe Blonde: I have had this beverage many times in Belgium, but that was too long ago, so I did pick one up at a store just to center my recollection. I broke out my Leffe glass (yes, I really do have one) for the occasion. Once poured, the Leffe is a perfect golden color, with a very thick head to it. The classic Belgian aroma sweeps over you: yeasty cinnamon rolls and gumballs. You know what I am talking about. The flavor is the same, strong up front, not too sweet and fades to a dry finish. There is a lightness to the Leffe Blonde that belies its Belgian origin. A great entry point to the Belgian experience."
""

"O- Not bad but I would prefer to spend the extra money on something like Orval, disappointing compared to other Abbey Ales."

"Crystal clear golden colored with a massive sticky white head, excellent retention. Herbal aroma. Smells like one of those health food stores that sales all of the herbs and stuff. Sweet flavored, almost too much so. Hint of bananna and some herbal flavors. Medicinal finish. Thick sticky mouthfeel. Overall good beer just not one of the top beers of the style. Good to have when there's nothing else better."

"O/D-At $4 for a 750ml, this is a bargain. It is a decent beginner's Belgian Pale Ale. I am surprised it took me so long to try it. All in all, its not bad, but if I was going to get someone to try their first Belgian, Duvel would take the cake here. I do enjoy the 750ml though."

"O: Its drinkable, its got flavor, but its not anything unique."
"O - Very sweet and sugary. A little too syrupy. Great fruity esters and a fun bubbly texture."
"Overall, it is a beer typical of the style, yet not a great example of the style. Everything that should be there is there, but none of the elements are great. A distinctly average Belgian beer."
"O: Sweet, thin, slightly spicy beer with a Belgium spice finish."
"Overall: this was my first foray into Belgian style ales about five years ago. I've never forgotten the surprise and delight at the discovery. Having one now instills my delight at this under appreciated taste. Leffe is a great stepping stone ale for those seeking the Belgian upgrade."
"For a Belgian, this beer doesn't get the best marks but I found it to be imminently drinkable....sweet and spicy, it goes down very well."
"Cheers!"
"O: Very sweet beer - unique - but nothing I would grab again."
"O: A really good belgean beer that is both delicious and easy to drink - A little heavy on the sweet side, but otherwise very good."
"Overall: It aint politically correct (this being InBev and all), but I have to say, this is a solid Belgian single! It has its mistakes, but it hits the right notes and makes for a simple, tasty brew."
"Overall a ""go to"" for wheat beers."
"RJT"
"CONCLUSION: After having Leffe Blonde a couple times in the past, and recently on tap, I again found it to be interesting, light yet complex, and very easy to drink. It is definitely ""European"" in character but I don't think I would agree with the label's claim of it being ""Subtle""; it's smooth but certainly electrifies your tastes buds with the yeast and sweetness. It's still pretty light and refreshing though, especially when compared to other Belgian heavyweights."
"O: No complaints here. If you want a refreshing beer that is relatively easy on the palate look no further. Not anything special but definitely not bad by any means."
"clear golden blonde, one finger of white head, dense and sticky, good lace, decent retention. Smell is spicy and yeasty, clove and light banana notes, light lemony hop, lightly sweet. Taste is more subtle than the nose, still lots of spice present, yeasty with some clove, light candy sweetness, light fruity/banana quality, firm malt presence. Carbonation is fairly high here and quite prickly to the point where it almost stings the tongue a little, med body, med weight. Aside from being over carbonated this is a pretty nice belgian pale, nothing super complex but enjoyable and something worth revisiting from time to time since its fairly inexpensive and readily available."
"Overall / Drinkability: Nice and tasty. Simple and straightforward, and a great looking beer to stare at while savoring. A solid good beer and I could easily see myself having another one."
"Overall pretty good! Not among the best Belgian ales out there but worth a pick up if you run by it."
"O: Nice beer for the style, but the sweetness keeps me from drinking more than one."
"72."
"O: Not a bad Belgian beer, but certainly not my favorite by any standard. It seems a little too clean compared to other Belgians and lacks some depth. Not a bad one for someone new to the style."
"Really mellow, smooth, and malty. Great Belgian yeasty flavor. Big head with a good mouthful of carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Spicy and aromatic. Flowers and candy are the flavors, but it has an acidic touch, which along with the modest alcohol makes it perfectly drinkable. The beer is fairly sweet, which is a plus for me in this style. Medium body."
"While there isn’t anything here that raises this ale above the norm it is an enjoyable drink. I may not rush out to find a case, but if you are buying I will drink this all day."
"D: Bland, nothing special with this beer, good with a burger."
"Overall: Good taste, smooth finish, great crisp beer, excellently crafted. Tastes better the more you drink."
"This being my first review I wanted to try something Belgium, the most underated beer. I think leffe blonde had a hefeweizen look and taste which was good just unexpected. I enjoyed the smooth flow from the bottle and will continue to try the leffe brand."
"The flavors are all there, but this beer just isn't bold nor full enough for my liking."
"I used to like this beer, and now it just tastes like a bad version of a Belgian. I can't help but think that this beer didn't taste like this when it was invented. Disappointing."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a pillowy delicate white head which slowly dissipates leaving a nice clean white lacing down the glass. Smells strongly of yeast, citrus fruit like aromas and ethyl acetate. Delicate on the tongue; pear, isoamyl acetate, citrus, and spicy phenolics to finish. No bitterness, light mouthfeel, crisp and very drinkable, especially in the warmer weather. The flavors as a whole seem a little discombobulated, there is also something in the background lingering that seemed a bit off, maybe not balanced perfectly to suit the style, but still very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Not alot of love for this Beer, but it is very solid in my opinion. Just not extremely complex like others."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick pillowy head. Lots of carbonation rising to the top. Scent is strong in dry malts, yeast, and slightly remind me of bread. Taste is rather bold but trickles off. Really hits the taste buds with lots of yeast and malts with decent volume but slowly disappears. Lots of flavor but nothing too unigue. As to be expected from one of the largest Belgian brands."
"Overall, an OK beer. I'm a little more partial to the hoppier American interpretation of the style. But this is OK. Nothing spectacular."
"A good Belgian beer, but not one of their stellar examples. But what a welcome relief in beer-forlorn Bulgaria."
"O: A little better than average, but expected good."
"but i have to say that the taste disappointed me maybe because i was expecting too much from it because of the aroma ...."
"Overall: Solid beer. Not favorite because I am not a huge fan of the sweetness that presents itself. I like the softness of this beer and if I was in the right mood I would try again."
"Overall very nice beer for a very nice price. I would recommend this for a hot day, and for beer drinkers of all palates. Not one part of it could be offensive"
"I poured a glass of leffe blond and and there was a small amount of head... As I logged on to beeradvocate to review this beer, when I looked back there was a full 2 inches in the glass. Just thought that was worth mentioning. But back to the beer- the smell is like a spicey german beer, the taste is very spicey and complex. I love trying to place all the aspects. I can only compare it to a spicey holiday cake. This is over all a pretty nice european styled beer, and with the gold foil around the cap it feels real fancy."
"O: The harsh over the top sweet taste just drags this down. It is unpleasant to drink, I will not be purchasing this again. Yuck...Drainpour time"
"O- Not an overly complex beer, but really easy drinkability, definitely enjoyable on a hot summer day."
"This is a great daily beer. It tastes especially good with soft pretzels and land jagers."
"Overall, though there is nothing particularly remarkable going on, this is a well made and balanced beer, refreshing, and enjoyable to drink."
"Okay, I'll come clean: I've never liked this beer per se, but this was a present and I wanted to give it a fair shake. The poor drinkability really did me in, though. Despite being a big fan of dark Belgian ales, I'm starting to realize the paler versions just aren't for me. Still, a decent introduction to what makes Belgian beer different, though it comes with the sobering possibility of scaring someone away from it forever."
"Leffe pours a crystal clear golden color. Right away you notice some carbonation dancing throughout and the foamy white head that sits on top. The head quickly fades away to leave delicate lacing around the glass. Off the aroma yeast and cloves jump out at you, but hints of fruity bubble gum are just below. Leffe has a great malty sweetness rounded out with cloves and light bubblegum notes. Leffe is a smooth beer that is very enjoyable. The aromas and flavor profile may sound odd with the bubblegum notes - it's a good beer."
"O: I don't know why I've ignored this beer for so long. Maybe cause its crowded with the import macros."
"T: Smooth and malty with some belgian yeast notes and a slight earthiness on the finish. It's not great, but it's still pretty decent."
"A good sessionable beer but nothing out of this world."
"O/D- A good beer to drink on the patio of a Greek café while techno music pounds in the background. I enjoy it. Great relief in the heat of a Chicago summer."
"O- critics will point to more characteristic Belgian Pale Ales as the ideal which this beer fails in measuring up to. However, the drinkability and approachability of this beer can't be understated. Others beers just don't substitute for this as a session ale on a hot Summer day."
"Be that great v"
"D: Pretty bland - not bad besides lacking balance, but it lacks any really distinct or outstanding characteristics. It's just putting in hours, as the saying goes."
"Pours a copper color with a huge bright white head. Pear aroma with a some floral in the mix. Not digging the taste much. Tastes like I am drinking a rose. Much too floral in the taste with some light hops on the swallow. A way long bitter/floral aftertaste that does not agree with my palate. Extremely thin mouthfeel. Overall I didn’t enjoy this beer very much. I had a tough time downing a single bottle due to the flavor."
"O - Very tasty Belgian Pale Ale, though it is a bit weak on the hop character. Easy drinking for a Belgian and as such easily sessionable."
"I picked up a sixer of this at the store on a whim because I've experienced few belgian beers. At first, I was enthralled with it due to the stark contrast it offers to the types of beer I usually drink. However, for around $10 a six, I expect better -the head retention was poor, there was too much hop and clove flavor which seemed to conflict, and the mouthfeel was too foamy. Not a horrible Belgian, and I may go back to it since its available in town, but surely I can find better."
"D: Why has it taken me this long to drink this beer? Probably because it seemed so commonplace and I’ve seen one too many a hipster drinking it. But, it’s good. Not mindblowingly good, but good, solid, all around a nice thoughtful beer for warmer nights."
"Paired wonderful with a nice ""Hangar steak""!!"
"Notes: While the nose is nice, its not crisp nor refreshing and has a few unpleasant flavors."
"O) I enjoyed this beer. I could drink 1 or 2 of these, but it would not be the sixer I show up with for game time."
"Poured from a bottle and served in a pint glass, the beer was a pale, blonde-yellow color with a ton of bubbles and a thin, foamy, clingy white head. Light nose of honey and toasted oats. The flavor is honey-sweet, with a slight sour tang, and a bready foundation. The aftertaste is all honey sweetness, with a tart, but dry, finish. Awkward brew all around."
"This is one of the least exciting Belgian ales I have had, but it is also very well made with some great flavors. This would be a very good BBQ beer, or would also work great as a lunch time beer in the hot summer months. I really enjoyed it, but I am not sure how often I may seek this one out in the future."
"Overall, a nicely put together, straightforward ale that is a perfect substitute to a pils on a hot summer day here in Arkansas. Cheers"
"Food match: Desserts all the way. I would not recommend savory with this as you're liking to end up with a battle between food and beverage that food could not possibly win."
"D - Probably best suited for meals, very light on flavors; looked great but lost some points after taking a few sips for lack of nice spiced notes and not much body"
"O- Not a bad beer. However, as a lover of all things Belgian- this is at the bottom of the Belgian totem pole. This is the beer that's generic enough you can get your friends into Belgian beer/craft beer. It doesn't offend anyone, yet holds the promise of, ""Yes, beer can taste good"". This has been my bridge beer for several friends getting into craft brew. It's a decent intro beer, just not great for the style. Still, worth picking up because of price, and to have a six pack laying around of something decent..."
"You know a beer is bad when you think you'd rather drink Budweiser than one more gulp. This beer looked like apple juice and was just as sweet, sickly sweet. Could not taste anything else. After 3 swallows the rest went down the drain. Absolutely horiible and easily the worst Belgian I've had."
"O- its just average its drinkable and moderate in taste a great segway to a belgian pale..but in the end its aveage"
"Poured a beautiful golden, clear color with tall, frothy head. Aroma was banana-like and yeasty. Medium sweetness, smooth to drink. Medium body, ave carbonation, with slightly bitter, lasting finish. A good Belgian abbey ale, at a good price. Taste to price ratio is high."
"O-doesn't exactly stand the test of time. i had 2 in a row and the tastes seem to deteriorate over time. its definitely still a good an easy drinking Belgian that i enjoyed."
"This is not my preferred style, but I must say that it's not bad (given the warmer weather)."
"overall; this is a good beer, not the best but a good value. This is a session variation of a non-session style."
"Bright, clear golden color with an initially thick creamy head that slowly fades to a foamy layer that sticks around and leaves solid creamy walls of lace. Smell is faint but complex and fruity. A nice sweet caramel underneath with a sweet clove aroma upfront followed by ripe pear, banana, and bubblegum. Spice and toffee, nutmeg and even vanilla hints. A bit watery, but nice spice notes with hints of herbal, spicy hops, bubblegum, caramel, banana and black pepper. Nutty notes with a vanilla hint in the aftertaste. Complex but watery. The mouthfeel is creamy on the front and clean and watery on the end. Easy to drink. Faint and subdued. Commerical version of the style, but well done, well balanced and semi-complex. Tasty."
"Overall, this is a nice beer. It's been in the cellar for about a year and a half and technically past its ""best by"" date. I like this beer a lot and it does just get better with age."
" And I was wondering why this 6-pack was so cheap!?"
"overall - better than average, not great."
"Dr: Conceals its mouthfeel very well. A delightful beer, but not worth seven quid (probably a result of its being offered in Salthill)."
"O: This beer is a little all over the place. Definitely worth a try, would be refreshing as a lawnmower beer."
"I don't recommend this beer... unless it is one of a limited set of options."
"Overall: Close to a very good mass-produced Belgian."
"Overall, I'd give this beer a solid B. I've had better, but it's a great beer to drink when you don't want to break the bank for a Duvel or Chimay, or when those beers aren't available. Tastes great, it's smooth, and the price is the same as Heineken for a much higher quality beer. You can't go wrong with Leffe."
"O: not bad, the fruity character grew on me as it warmed."
"O- I'd call this a gateway beer to the Belgian styles. This is essentially the Miller Lite of the Belgians. It tastes pretty extraordinary to people who are used to American adjuncts. However, compared nearly any other traditional Belgian offering, this fails to impress. If you have friends that you're trying to introduce to the Belgian styles, then I'd suggest this one (it's better than Stella...but not by much.) Otherwise, I would not recommend it."
"O: A very crisp and refreshing blonde ale, and while I usually don't go crazy over Belgian ales, this one is by far one of the easiest drinking ones I've had."
"On tap in Sweden/Denmark. Bottle in US!"
"D: seriously solid drinkability, which is just really refreshing."
"This beer's appearance is like an elite power forward and you have to give it props because it can get its head above the rim. This is especially impressive for such as a mass-produced InBev offering. But it's not all about the Belgian penchant for protein control that makes this a pretty good beer. The smell is classic Belgian as well, full of bubblegum and clove with a nice crystal malt backbone to work off of. Those yeast byproducts appear in the flavor as well with some evident hops presence and a nicely apparent nuttiness. The bitterness starts at the back of the mouth, but moves forward and reaches the tip of the tongue as the beer warms. The caramel in the nose turns to honey on the tongue and leaves the beer a bit sweet, really muddying the wash and leaving a mouthfeel that was not impressive. This one made a promise of a refreshing beer and fell short by turning up the sweetness. If they could dry this one out a little it would be really nice. As it is, it is decidedly NOT one of the best Belgian pales, but I still like it better than Stella Artois."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a bit of bubbly head that laces fairly well but leaves little retention. The aroma is somewhat skunky with some grassy hop notes. The taste starts with some malty sweetness and the moves to some flowery and earthy hops. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and finishes clean. A great summer beer."
"overall this i would say is the standard of belgian pale ales....great beer"
"This is a world famous beer, but I was not impressed with this at all. It is way too sweet, especially with food. The color is yellowish copper, and the smell is not so great. I don't taste much hops in this beer, very malty. I definitely won't be trying this beer again."
"Cheers!"

"A decent mass-produced belgian beer that I enjoy drinking. It's a bit too sweet and lacking in complexity for a traditional belgian blonde, but not bad. Worth sampling if you've never tried it and makes a good introduction to belgian beers."
"O: Very good beer. Would be easy to drink a few without any issues."
"Overall - Was very impressed with this was thinking I'd get a more mild brew glad I got it and would get it again. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"Medium-Full, creamy, and a dry bubbly feel,"
"O: A delicious and accessible blonde. I've had a lot of luck using this beer to introduce novice beer drinkers to the style."
"O- I think this is a nice beer that I'll return to on occasion, but it doesn't have a defining characteristic for me. There won't be an evening where I think ""It's a Leffe Blonde evening"" but if it's available, I'll drink and enjoy it."
"Good beer."
"Overall Drinkability - The only reason I'd ever have this beer again is just to make sure it wasn't a bad bottle. I suspect that's not the case though. Best before end 26/05/12. Numbers below that are 4922:22."
"O: Easy enough, a stereotyped, approachable interpretation of the style but nothing distinguished"
"Overall-A very decent beer,after a few they do catch you though!!"
"O - This would be a very light session beer or a thirst quencher in the summer."
"The liquid is clear and golden with a thick white head that stuck to the glass. It smells mostly of clove and banana with hints of grass. The taste is mostly clove, Belgian spice, some sweet bread and an aftertaste that resembles hay. The beer feels a little syrupy at first until the soft carbonation fills the mouth. It finishes slightly dry. I don't know why the bros gave it bad reviews but I thought it was right up there with you're average, quality, Belgian Blonde."
"11.2 oz bottle. Part of a 6-pack from Grocery Outlet, Salem.$7.59 Light gold coloured beer,huge white frothy head on first pour. Nice aromas orange,clove,hay, dough ,fruity Sweet taste, candy sugar, clove though breaks it up,green apples, a little ""barn"" funk. Ok on the palate, the carbonation helps preven this from becoming too cloying Overall i liked it. NOt bad at all, given the horrific treatment this has probably been through."
"Appearance is a golden amber with a thick head that dissapates slowly leaving nill lace. Smell has a light belgian spice aroma, earthy and light fruit. Taste has a sweet spiciness with a zest of lemon or grapefruit that settles out into the subtle hops and finishes dry. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Not a bad belgian blonde, but I think I could only handle one or two at a time."
"Notes:"
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of zesty spice, sweet crisp light fruit, earthy hops, alcohol qnd bready yeast. There's a very prominent spice character up font with lots of zesty pepper, coriander and lemon zest that lingers throughout. This is countered mid-palate by a strong bread/yeast character that adds cmplexity and fullness to the body. Hintsnof wheat, banana, and lemon peel as well as some faint apple and pear. Decently balanced and easy to drink especially in the warmer months but not something that I would regularly seek out. A nice introduction to Belgian beers."
"Pours a somewhat hazy golden-blonde color with a great looking white head and plenty of lacing as it goes down. The nose brings forward some light peach followed with a large banana presence and a bit of clove and bread. The flavor profile is quite similar, though the banana and bread are the most prominent here. The body is light and a bit chewy. I wasn't expecting much from this but it was quite good."
"Poured a clear dark yellow with a large white rocky head that was mostly diminishing and had poor lacing. The aroma of straw malts, a grassy hop and a moldy yeast. It tasted bitter-sour at first and progressed into a yeasty full bodied flavor slighty hinted with honey. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture. Overall a nice yeasty belgian brew."
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the aroma and the kick at the very center of the flavor. The notes in the nose were not exclusive to the style, per se, but rather seemed to be included from a variety of different, but similar styles. If it had to be summed up, the aroma could be classified as the union of a Belgian Pale, a Weizenbock, and a Hefeweizen. The alcoholic, pepper-laden kick usually doesn't come in until the very end, or the aftertaste, but here it came early, for a nice surprise in the middle of the tasting. Otherwise, the beer looked decent, and was fairly simple and standard all around."
"This beer would be my choice for a young lady who isn't used to quality beer, or as a type of 'desert' beer after a large meaty meal and a couple stouts or heavier pale ales. Something I would refer my sister too more than a fellow Beer Advocate. I would certainly drink Leffe again and I encourage others to try it as well."
"I always have one or two of these laying in my fridge. Since Friday night is pizza night around here Leffe Blond makes it to the diner table quite often. While I would not suggest to seek this one out for the beer geeks out there I would suggest to drink have this on hand if you live on my side of the pond. This can also be the gateway to better beers for the regular beer drinker."
"D_It's well made beer, just nothing that appealed to me. I won't bother with this again. The aftertaste was the final ""straw""."
"The thing is, I didn't remember this beer being so... boring. But it's an OK beer anyway. Worth a try."
"D_This is a well made beer. Not Earth shattering but a solid choice. The alcohol % is surprising considering how easy it goes down."
"D- This beer is average to me. Nothing really screams out for me to drink more than a glass of it. The ABV is in the middle range but doesn't seem like it. The alcohol seems to pop out more like a 9 or 10 percent beer."
"from my notes: had this beer many many times and now it is time to finally review it. Poured into my de molen sniffer. The beer pours a yellow colour with a clear thick white stable head. Smell is yeast, sweet and a bit spicy. The taste is overall too sweet for the style, but it has some nice spicyness in it.also yeast seems too much present. Mouthfeel is good, biit thin but the carbonation nicely tickless the tongue. Overall an easy beer to drink when one is thirsty. Bit too sweet maybe and it lacks depth"
"M - smooth but bubbly, with a slight creaminess on the tongue and a slight dryness in the finish."
"Every time I review a Belgian white style, I continue to be disappointed. I should know by now that I just do not prefer the style. I know that I used to like Hoegaarden, and I have one in the fridge right now that I am hoping I will enjoy. Leffe Blonde reminded me of all the things I don't like about Duvel. It has a plastic-like yeast taste that I just cannot get into. I find that yeast presence very dominating, and it makes the beer hard to finish. The appearance was a nice golden color with a bubbly head. It does have an almost ""slick"" smoothness, but the taste really cut down on the drinkability for me."
"Finises kinda boozy."
"Drinkability: Average. I used to think this was a great beer but after over a hundred different crafts & imports...I now see this for what it is...an average at best, commercial version of much better beers."
"I would think 1 of these at a time would do me , as it is not particularly I style that appeals to me"
"D: Nice light refreshing hot day beer. Not too thick like most Belgian abbey's but a 12 pack drinker at that!"
"M/D) Medium body with lots of very fine bubbles. A very crisp beer that crackles in the mouth. Very drinkable beer. Unlike many other Belgian ales, I could go for more then one of these in a session."
"D. A really enjoyable Abbey beer (even if it is a commercial one) and along with a couple of other lighter coloured beers is a great summer thirst quencher."
"Beer was brilliantly clear with no head to speak of. Smell and taste was of banana and bubble gum. Body was thin with no real sense of hopiness. A good vehicle for great Belgian yeast flavors without any bells and whistles."
"D: Solid, not amazing. I have had better of the style, worth trying. Could have more than a few."
"D - I have managed to drink a six pack of it before but I normally just like to sip on it and note how the flavors change as it warms up."
"Drinkability: If there are no other Belgian ales around, I could drink this without complaint. However, I would prefer many other examples. Moderate drinkability."
"Easy enough to drink. If it weren't for the overly bitter finish this would be an instant favorite."
"D-ok, glad I tried it, but may not be quick to search it out again"
"A fine brew"
"D: Too sweet. No thanks."
"D- Very drinkable, theres better examples of the style but this is a good solid option that you can always find."
"A fine example. I would rather have a Chimay or even a Unibroue beer, but cost-wise this is much less. I bought this serving as an individual bottle from the Jewel, a big grocery chain here in Chicago. For $2 per 12oz. not the worst."
"Drinkability - great beer to have and to share. this is a good ""go to"" type of beer for friends and poker nights!"
"I really don't understand why some people hate this beer, it's perfectly fine for what it is. It is also very common and inexpensive and easy to drink."
"Poured into pint glass (I usually drink out of the 12oz bottle however). Pours a clear amber/golden color. Head is small, fizzy white with fair lacing and is fully diminishing. Light grain note for the malt, light to moderate perfume for the hops, light soap for the yeast and hints of wine, clove and wood. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly acidic. Palate is light to medium, watery with a lively carbonation and lightly alcoholic finish. A little simple for a Belgian Pale Ale, but the interesting spiciness makes this a unique Belgian Ale."
"Pours a golden/yellow with a nice lasting white head, good lacing. Aroma of sweet pears, some bannana and sweet spice esters. Taste is sweet fruitiness, dominated by pears and bannana with some slight hoppiness. Palate is nice med bodied, with good carbonation and nice crisp mouthfeel. Finish is sweet fruityflavors with some light hops bitterness for balance. Overall a very nice well rounded and refreshing brew."
"Bottom line, if you see it on tap, have two!"
"D- The only thing you need to think about when drinking this one, is when should I take the next one out of the fridge to warm up. It's so simple and delicious... goes with so many different foods... Chinese, Thai, fish, grilled pineapple/chicken skewers, desert... Mmmm..."
"Leffe blonde appears clear and golden hued with an inch of white fluffy head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of fruit, yeast, and alcohol. The flavor is good, and distinctly Belgian. The alcohol is more noticeable than I would like. The feel is medium bodied with plenty of carbonation and an alcoholic finish. This is a decent Belgian brew."
"D: One is enough for me, this is interesting but not one I'd buy another 6 pack of."
"Crystal clear, golden, nice lacing on the glass with a decent head formed after the pour. Smell is of grains, lemons, and tobacco, slightly sweet as well with a hint of yeastiness. Tastes much like it smells...begins with a malty sweetness, slightly bready with a bit of spiciness. As the taste develops, a light citrus flavor makes its way onto the palate, followed by a dry, unwelcomed musty tobacco taste. There is that traditional belgian yeastiness in the flavor, but it becomes muffled out by the aftertaste of this beer. Mouthfeel is light, perhaps a bit watery, carbonation is on the high end. An easy drinker, but one that I will not likely purchase again."
"Admittedly I usually am not a fan of Belgian beer, but I liked this one better than most."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with a foamy, long lasting, white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of Belgium yeast, pear, some banana and some spicy hop notes. Flavor is similar to aroma. Medium, crispy body. Long, dry finish. All around solid brew."
"Me like it!"
"D: This was a very easy beer to drink. The low Abv makes it a great session beer that you won't get sick of."
"D - no reason not to finish the 6 pack, but I was hoping for a little more. I was hoping this would show a little more than ""a mass produced and marketed Belgian"" but I can't really give a better explanation really. the steps taken in the name of cost and uniformity can be detected easily. however, it's head and shoulders above a lot of other beers, and honestly, when I don't feel like putting down almost $5 a bottle for Duvel or the various available Trappists, this will do nicely for a quick Belgian fix"
"Tried this beer at a bar, although a friend had ordered it, initially, I did not really like the fruity taste of it. It reminded me of a tomato. However, after ordering the beer on my own and giving it a try I would have to say that by the appearance and unique taste it really isn't that bad. The fruity taste that the beer has at first may be off putting, but it is what places the beer as very different from others. Its not a personal favorite, but not horrible."
"Poured this beer from a 12oz bottle. Malty smell. Very clear, golden in color. White frothy head, Excellent Head Retention- It was a very nice looking beer. Too nice. This beer was filtered to the max and the last time I checked, a Belgian Ale should be unfiltered. This is a commercialized version of a Belgian Pale Ale- there are much better examples on the shelf. The taste was poor it had a heavy syrup taste, it was overly sweet. I would avoid this beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable."
" It was somewhat light, easing going down and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes Belgian Blondes (not the females, but the beers)."
"Drinkability - This is probably the best ""Blonde"" that I have had thus far. I'm not a real big fan of ""Blondes", ""Wits"" or ""Hefes", but this beer was excellent in my opinion. Most are way too spicy and overdone with sweetness for my liking. This was more subdued and gentle and made for a very pleasant experience. This would be great during the Summer around the BBQ. The high ABV might sneak up on me however."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an oversized wine glass. The pour is pale orange and a big, fluffy white head erupts, nice lacing. The aroma is full of sweet fruit and very spicy(cloves not chillies). The beer is sweet and has a ton of clove, that dominate the flavor. The beer finishes as it starts, sweet fruity clove. The body is light/medium and it is very well carbonated. It is easy drinking and I kind of liked it, but the yeast strain may not be for everyone."
"Overall, very interesting beer with a balanced diversity of tastes, and the lightness of it makes very drinkable. Would definitely recommend."
"Mouthfeel begins with a sudden prickled feel from the carbonation, but smooths out completely afterwards. Not much coating in cheeks or tongue. Easy drinking. I usually see these in the supermarket and I'd say it's a decent alternative to your usual BMC."
"Mouthfeel is decent, slightly watery, but tolerable. Drinkability is pretty high for my tastes. Overall not bad. Tastes very nice even at an age of 1+ and beyond the ""expiration"" date. From what I remember when I got it fresh, the taste is not much different so it seems like it can be lying around for a while and not suffer badly."
"Drinkability - THis is definitely a beer I could drink several of in 1 sitting (and get in trouble with the higher 6.6% ABV than the light body would dictate). I very much recommend this beer for its easy drinkability and very distinct and unique taste."
"There is potential here. It just needs some TLC."
"I will be polishing off this brew over the Christmas holiday, I'd call this one very drinkable."
"Overall, a near excellent beer that is certainly worth your time."
"D - Easy to drink this. Not overly complex but quite nice and I could see myself sessioning this."
"D: smooth but not worth the time. A bit of an effort to finish this one just because the taste was so unusual. will easily look past this one from now on. Had to try it - bottle looked great."
"Overall this lacks some depth. Clove and a grainy malt characters are about all I get from this Belgian Pale Ale. A little bit of hot alcohol in the finish but this is otherwise a fairly nice pale ale."
"D - goes down easy but a bit sweet for more than 1 or 2."
"The feel of this beer has a bit of a smooth body but a complex aftertaste that is in the middle and at both ends, a bit interesting."
"Drinkability is below average. It's ok but I won't seek it out again."
"Drinkability: A decent Belgian ale that I could have several of. I have certainly had both better and worse. I would consider picking up a six of this."
"It's a nice beer, a bit disapointing to anyone who likes Leffe Brown (Best beer EVER). It doesn't feel as expansive as it should. It ain't rich, it ain't full of flavor and it doesn't go down very smoothly. It's too basic - a good competetor for something like any other slighty flavored Pale beer. If you want a Leffe, get another one."
"awful would never have again well maybe on tap but i think my reason for why i didnt like this beer are clearly stated"
"D - I don't have a ton of experience with Belgians, but from a pure beer flavour enjoyment perspective I really liked this, and will definitely be sampling again"
"drinkability. its alright, but...this is not like the one in Europe for sure. Theres a big difference.Maybe freshness of the product. usually it have a full body, malty and refreshing. this one seem its from with corn and other ingredients..im disapointed here"
"*Not in an autolysis way, but in the sink-your-teeth-into-it way."
"Drinkability: Interestingly complex flavor for a light beer, but the spicy fruit of Belgian ale is simply not my thing."
"This beer poured to be an amber/golden color which was poured into a goblet. It had an aroma of spice and fruit which was quite strong. It was very sweet-tasting with a bit of a bitter after-taste. It was moderately carbonated and medium-bodied. It had good drinkability."
"Leffe Blonde was a very clear bright golden color. It had a towering white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was full of yeast flavors and spices. The taste was light malt with some light spices and some yeast flavors. The finish was dry and lightly peppery. It was medium bodied with just over medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a good beer and worth a try."
"33 ml bottle, poured into my leffe goblet. 1 and a half finger head. Looks like apple juice mixed with soda. Smells of berries, can taste wheat. The after taste is on the sweet side of bittersweet. Goes down well, would like to have this as a session beer but I only get to a french or belgian supermarket once or twice a year & it's to expensive to binge on in GB."
"Drinkable, but a bit cloying for my tastes. Despite the promising aroma, the flavors seem too one-dimensional."
"Pouring amber with a thin, white with decent retention and lacing, this is solid. Initially, this is a little too cold, resulting in the nose being muted, but as it warms up, I get some cotton candy, sugar water, a little honey and a moderate spice. The spice character is some blend of clove and nutmeg The palate replicates the nose. Definite sugar water and cotton candy are present, and there's a light hop character present as a mild bitterness. Spices appear mid-palate, and linger into the finish along with sugar. Light in body with high carbonation, this feels soft and gentle on the palate, wonderful. Quite enjoyable, this, though there are many beers I'd pick over this."
"D - Light flavored but complex at the same time. The ABV is hidden quite well which makes it a pretty drinkable beer. I'd definitely drink it again."
"It was pleasant trip down memory lane with a solid beer that I enjoy and will drink again in the future."
"D: This is one of my favorite Belgian beers. Honestly, I am not much of a Belgian beer drinker, but I think this one is great!"
"D- It's an easy drinker. I could put back a couple in a sitting. The sweetness might take away from the drinkability just a bit. Maybe it isn't as authentic as the true Monastic brewers, but it's a solid commericial effort. I like that it's something I can share with my wife. Nice on its own or with a cheese platter."
"D - Not as good as I remember it but a pretty easy drinking Belgian Pale. Gets better as it warms."
"D-Very drinkable indeed. And I think the best of the ""Beers of Belgium"" gift pack I received. This may be one of the best ""macro"" type beers I have enjoyed. I am surprised this is not rated higher. Of the three ""Beers of Belgium"" I liked this best and would buy it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied sweet but not cloying. Carbonation is solid and spritzy with a yeasty finish."
"good stuff!"
"D: I could drink these any day. I get smile at the end of this beer. It is smooth and has a taste the gets the taste buds coming back for more."
"I taste sweet orange rind with a peppery lemon spice finish. A bit of tartness. Good effervescent carbonation, but if you're not into heavier carbonation it might be kind of like a soda. Paste on the aftertaste, which is disappointing. This is tasty in it's own way, like a weird lemon dessert cake with an odd frosting on top. Not ""bad," but nothing special to recommend."
"Pours a golden bright brew, along with a nice beige and creamy crown that lingers around. Sweet malts on the nose along with some ripe fruits and floral hints. Very near the smell. Sweet malts, fruits. Nice body with good balance with a nice bitter hints that do not overpower the brew. Great drinkability, good brew for any time."
"Drinkability- Delicious and light. Very drinkable. Try this with fruit and a mild cheese and cracker plate."
"Lots of cloves. My brother, who loves Belgium beers, bought this. He loves it. Not my cup of tea (or beer should I say). I went with another wheat beer for my next. Might be heading to the store for so e seasonal American ales!!! Overall, I give this beer an average rating. I like Belgium style beers, but not with this much clove taste."
"d- i guess its an acceptable beer but i wont bother with it again"
"D-Very drinkable beer. Light, but rich in flavor."
"Bright golden yellow in color with a slight haze. Thick, rocky white cap after the pour that sustains for quite a while. Yeasty, sweet malty aromas, along with strong hints of clove and light hints of banana. Medium body with a creamy smooth feel. Classic yeasty, sugary sweet and malty Belgian flavors, with clove and spice. Very tasty, but somewhat forgettable. Easy to drink, but I would try another BPA if it were available over this one."
"In short: liquefied sweet corn with clove staring in the face."
"Overall: Not a very good taste, avoid, if possible"
"Mouthfeel is creamy, slick and smooth, with light carbonation, a light to medium body, and a refreshing feel to the whole experience. This may not be the most complicated Belgian Blond, but it hides the ABV well and is always enjoyable to me; a great session beer that I recommend trying."
"My brother brought home a sixer o' this (I'm becoming proud of his recent purchases) and allowed me to join him in partaking of the Belgian-ness. It pours a bright golden straw topped by a thick coif of white foam. The nose comprises clove, wheat, banana, pepper, and a touch of cardamom. The taste is pretty much the same, only with a touch of orange peel and a bit more wheat, along with some Belgian yeast. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a very nice Belgian blonde, tasty and easy to drink."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice rich appearance, and great balanced nose. Flavor is not complex, but does have a nice fully bittersweet malt. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"jd"
"Cheers!"
"Not a very complex brew, but pretty tasty and refreshing. A nice session beer for BSPA fans."
"The beer had a nice colour and a slight head. The smell was strong and malty, almost smokey in nature. This is a very malty beer and if you're in to that, then you'll probably like this. I found it to be a very interesting beer and I enjoyed drinking it."
"Drinkability is so good except the price. thats pretty much it."
"D - Its not a hard ale to drink. But it doesn't leave the best impression on the palate."
"A good beer I will buy again,but perhaps lacks the world class spunk of a Belgian ale.Belgian ales are my favorite types of beers,this one is good but there are more magical ones out there."
"Overall: This beer gets knocked around by critics quite a bit, but I personally found it more than adequate. Perhaps it's too commercial for many? I would like to refer to this one as a ""craft beer geek's lawnmower beer."""
"D: Crisp and refreshing, a classic blonde, would enjoy any time."
"Cheers!"
"It wobbles my mind a bit that this is what some people think of as ""just a beer"". At least, I would like to think that this is the case. I know that Stella Artois is the Bud of Belgium but I can trick myself into thinking that there is a land where this is as basic and accessible as it gets. A man can dream, yes?"
"kojkiojkiojk"
"drinkabilityi so so since there are so many better belgian pale out there"
"All in all, a quality ale (billed as a ""blonde""). Nothing too extraordinary, but still one of InBev's better offerings."
"Drinkability: pretty light and refreshing for a decent Belgian beer. Some of the flavor is not my favorite, but overall it is quite a pleasurable experience."
"T: In a very light flavor, slightly crisping on the tongue, with slight bitterness, final discreet, but is seen chewing a bit of waste. Very refreshing despite the amount of alcohol"
"d: I almost scored this higher overall, but I needed something to dry this out a little. Solid overall though."
"This is supposed to be a Belgian ""macro"" or widely available. It is pretty drinkable and beats our macros all day long."
"Nonetheless, a pretty good beer, very sweet, and extremely drinkable. Very light for a Belgian beer. It has to be served pretty cold, the taste disintegrates a bit, when the beer gets warmer, which is a bit of a disappointment in my book."
"D: Certainly not world class, but this is a perfectly acceptable, accessible Belgian pale ale. A nice crowd-pleaser, just a bit lacking in excitement. I'd be interested in trying an unfiltered version."
"Worth a try if curious, but I wouldn't rush out for another six."
"D - Easy enough to imbibe, but again, a little too sweet for my liking."
"Overall not a bad brew, the candy-like flavors make it a nice treat. It's just not the type of beer i'd commonly seek out."
"Tapped into its own glass. One and a half finger off white head. Lots of fine lacing. Nice clear light reddish amber. Spicy malty smells. Nice round flavour. Malty taste up front. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Pretty drinkable for a Belgian Pale Ale. I could have had several."
"Poured into a chalice like they suggested. Clear golden with a tone of orange. Slightly off-white head is superfine. Smell is biscuity at first, with a whole bunch of yeast and herb notes. Tastes spicy and continues into an almost cough medicine-like bitterness. Finishes sticky and hot. Not very impressive. This is an odd beer, unlike anything I've tried, but I'm not a fan."
"D- Like a summer beer. Dank this while grilling, and had one alone. I don't consider it a beer to taste, it's more of a beer to drink. I would choose this over many other beers, if I were at a macro BBQ."
"Pours a golden beer with no head and lacing. WTF? I expect more from even an MGD. The smell though is enjoyable, a sweet malt and lightly funky belgian smell including the normal clove. The body comes through with more of the same. Mouthfeel is crisp, but could have been more carbonated."
"D: I could polish off a sixer and still feel like drinking. A good example of the style, and I would buy again. Not my favorite, but an interesting take on belgian blonde."
"Goes down smooth, a very good example of the style."
"Very smooth mouthfeel and fairly well balanced."
"the pour is on the side golden yellow and clear with a weak head for the style. nose is of belgian sugar cane. palate is that mostly. with a bit of fruit and straw. its consistently the same flavor aways. the yeast has a clear quality but but of a high market in the world of blonds. its seems like its a typical beer to appease. it seems to be geared more for first time appeal instead of solid recipe in a market of great beer. i like this style a lot... i don't like this beer though. its too close to the over sweeten european strong lagers with a good yeast gone to waste."
"Mouthfeel has a crisp zing from the carbonation and alcohol. Drinkability is fine. Maybe a bit much on the alcohol hit and lingering aftertaste to enjoy much more."
"D - Very drinkable. The first blonde I've ever really liked and am glad I bought a bottle to try. I'll be back for more of this one!"
"The reason I am so shocked is that I used to LOVE drinking this beer until it became too pricey for me about three years ago. I came back to try this beer and was shocked at how bad it was. I am sure this review will change as I am really sure that this bottle was just from a bad batch."
"D - Makes a good session beer and recommended"
"D: i can drink one of these and time to move on to something else, i get the feeling of a sugar rush if i had one too many of these, not my favorite style."
"D - I liked this beer but it wasn't great. Not as savory and delicate as others I've had from the style. More of an everyday Belgian Pale IMO then when I'd get excited about."
"Good beer. I wonder if a pint in the states will be as charming."
"This is an easy drinking blonde. It is mostly a bready flavor with just a hint of spice but it has a nice refreshing carbonation and is pretty well balanced. The hop bittering is light and slightly unpleasant but is masked by the yeast and carbonation."
"Very drinkable I could easily have a few of these on a summer day, good refreshing brew."
" Supremely drinkable. The flavours & aromas are there but they're a little bit hidden and difficult to access, but overall still a pleasure to drink."
"Although not as good as its brown counterpart, this beer is still well above the commercial beer average. If you think that in Belgium it is marketed as mass beer, you get jelous of these lucky bastards. OK it's not the kind of beer you would store for special days but I would choose it above any other mainstream beer."
"This is an abbey beer of the highest order. Supremely drinkable. The flavours & aromas are there but they're a little bit hidden and difficult to access. If they were a bit more prominent this could be a truly great beer, but overall still a pleasure to drink."
"Leffe is a good entry brew into Belgian Pale Ales. Worth a try if you like the style."
"Overall, a simple pleasing beer."
"D - I haven't had many abbeys. The fact that it is commercialized should make it worse but it's ok in my book. Pretty drinkable brew"
"The beer had a lighter feel than most of the style, but the beer was very, bordering on extremely, easy to drink. The beer was smooth, crisp and refreshing but less carbonation than expected."
"D: No off flavors, the ale just isn't terribly exciting."
"The beer has a good mouthfeel with this soft taste and is very drinkable. Because the beer is so available in Holland it has so many fans."
"Medium body with good carbonation."
"Overall, a decent Belgian Pale Ale but far from my favourite. This one seems well suited as an intro into Belgian's. I'd pick up Leffe's Brune before this, but still worth a try."
"I will reiterate (and I know it's like beating a dead horse) Leffe falls apart as soon as it warms. The flavors become insipid and even downright disgusting, and the thick, buttery mouthfeel noticeably changes into something syrupy and unpleasant. Surprisingly, for something put out by Inbev, this is remarkably decent. Unfortunately, economics of scale dictate that it must be filtered -- and therein is the greatest folly. While the pseudo-parchment label hints at an ""abbey ale," and has thinly veiled affectations of a true Belgian beer its mass produced qualities too easily shine through. Some consumers will undoubtedly pick this up because it looks like it could be a true Belgian Pale Ale -- and indeed it has a few admirable qualities -- but I can't really recommend this to anyone who has tasted an authentic Belgian Pale Ale."
"O: Good drinkability. Despite of being an ImBev, I still recommend it as a belgian classic blond ale"
"Taste has a pleasant, slight grape-ish overtone to it. There is a definite small spiciness to it as well. Sort of reminds me of a ""light dopplebock."""
"Review may be biased as I spent all day working the yard/ garden, and this really hitting the spot. Perfect context for this beer."
"D: A very ""public"" Belgian. This could probably work as an introduction to better beers. But for beer-connoisseurs, it's still a nice beer."
"From an 11.2 fl. oz. bottle marked 19/01/11-4322:48. Sampled on March 27, 2010 and served about 45 degrees. The pour is a cloudy yellow-orange with a short-lived off-white head that diminishes to a thin ring around the glass and a thin coating at the top of the beer. Clove, malts, and thin hops are the key sensations in the aroma, which is quite typical of a Belgian Abbey Ale like this. But it it not quite as pungent as some. The mouthfeel falls in the medium category with a likeable creaminess. The taste has all the right characteristics of clove, coriander, hops, and wheat typical of a Belgian Abbey ale. This is a beer that is a delight to drink but really does not stand out from other Belgian Abbey ales out there."
"D: This is one you should not gulp. That being said, it's easy to drink. Not a brew that stands out from the crowd though. Not bad, but don't go out of your way to get it."
"I had this beer on tap when I was in Belgium for work. I ordered a Duvel as that was the only Belgian beer I had had at that point. They were out of it, so they suggested Leffe as an alternative. Wow - I immediately fell in love with it. It's got a nice round, bold taste. I especially enjoy the drinkability - it is very smooth in the mouth and then goes down very easy."
"overall a nice beer, delicious but not overwhelming, and nce on the tongue.."
"D: Not my favorite Belgian, almost feels too macro. But that makes it accessible."
"D: Could definitely drink several of these in succession if I wasn't feeling guilty about supporting In Bev instead of craft brewers."
"Drinkability is good, mouthfeel is fine, the beer's flavor overall is a little light. There is a malt backbone but generally there isn't much there. Not a lot of esters or anything too interesting. I'm bored again. Not my favorite by a long shot. Its just OK."
"The sweetness puts this beer out of the thirst-quenching domain, better to go with spiced food or as an appetizer."
"D - This good blonde has outstanding drinkability due to it's fantastic balance and very well-blended flavors. A bit of everything comes out without one thing being too much."
" Something about this beer feels pretty different from any beer I've ever had. I've had sweet done better. Happy I tried it again (as if I wasn't going to) Will buy it again. Can't wait to try the Brune."
"Pours crystal clear, golden-amber, with a light head. Quite pretty! Aromas of banana, cloves, anise, juniper, with floral notes. Body is sweet with a tangy and quite spicy finish. A pleasure to drink and one of the best examples of the style, (and quite cheap and highly available in Belgium)."
"Not outstanding, but drinkable. Definitely had worse."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability go hand in hand. Light and refreshing, with a nice shot of carbonation up front. Though a little much the taste leaves you wanting more. Its warming and alluring."
"D – As I intimated, this is one of my least favorite Belgian beers."
"Might be a little on the sweet side but I could drink this all night. Might be a little too clean for a Blonde."
"Store bought at LCBO in a bottle. Great smell has a hint of caramel, and roasted malt, 2 finger head. Had it in a bar in Ottawa, in a nice Leffe glass. Looked very nice! Would recommend this beer to a friend! Worth every penny! Goes down easy, with a refreshing taste and smell!"
"Overall, this is a good bier that it a pleasure to drink and enjoy. I recommend this bier without issue. Prosit."
"Had this after a black and tan. Xebec is definitely not a beer destination."
"D: Nothing about this beer is off putting, but that's where it ends. The price is not justified and it it a sad attempt at a belgian style."
"D: Not a spectacular beer. Without a great taste or complexity and a strong sweetness, I would probably get sick of this beer after another glass."
"D-It's fairly drinkable, but all in all, I was a little dissapointed with this one. I'm not a big fan of belgiums, but I can appreciate a good one and this just didn't do it for me."
"this is what budweiser would taste like if they used a belgian yeast."
"As stated above, this one confused me. It wasn't a bad beer, but the aroma was so good that it became a let down with each and every single sip I took thereafter."
"Its not a oomplicated beer but that doesnt mean it isnt really good. I enjoy a good Leffe when I can get one, especially on draft."
"Sante!"
"Yeah, I've been able to down 4-6 of these in a night before. The booze is dangerous, due to the light body and smoothness. No one will claim this is a legendary Belgian, but it's really pretty cheap, and no one in the US makes a beer quite like this at $9 a sixer or less. It is about as simple as a Belgian can get, but I still like it, and it turns up at some bars and liquor stores with little more to offer."
"The feel is smooth and lush but the flavor just aint there. The carbonation was light and maybe a boost would of made some sparks in feel, otherwise this was flat as a pancake, but not completly dead. Medium bodied. I'm not a fan of this beer, I found out when I noticed the small sips I was taking, I usually down Belgian pales, but not this one. I dumped the rest out."
"Pours a clear gold with a finger of fluffy white head on top. Has a typical banana and clove Belgian profile with hints of clove bubblegum and pepper. Smell is pretty restrained, but I did notice an almost adjunct lager sweetness in the smell. Pretty light taste as well. Clove, bubblegum, pears, banana, and a slight medicinal hint. Creamy feel...this goes down quite smooth. Has a very crisp and clean finish. I'd prefer the flavors to be more pronounced and maybe some yeasties floating about, but this is still pretty good and I can't really ding it for being too clean."
"D: An excellent belgian beer, you can easily take several like ice cream peach."
"still much better then our big name beers but something tells me this may be leaning towards the macro side for Belgian standards, then again I could be wrong. worth a try no doubt but I'm sure there's better one's out there in the same price range"
"The nose gives off a sweet aroma of alcohol fairly typical. The entry on the palate is soft and round although a little fat, there also detects the cloves, the flavor is very nice but the finish, although somewhat caramelized, has an artificial bitterness. It is refreshing when drunk slightly hit. An abbey beer, considered by many as a standard, but that seems a little too conventional to be among the best in its class."
"Not a super-good beer by my estimation but it isn't bad, just not great."
"I enjoyed this."
"Pours a crystal yellow color with a frothy white two finger head. There is some lacing to be seen. The aroma is of clove, spice, and a slight fruit smell. The taste is of a sweet malt. There is also a taste of banana faintly and some clove. The mouthfeel is a little stingy and moderately carbonated. Overall you could have more than one but nothing to make you want to have a sixer."
"Not a bad Belgian Pale Ale but not as good as a good old American Pale Ale. Sweet taste out of the bottle, notice the malty banana taste and can taste and feel the alcohol. It pours nicely into a wine glass and laces a little. The were sent to the base post exchange in Korea for the troops and at a fairly decent price. They sell at about $12/six pack in Korea and under $7 on the base. Wouldn't call this a session beer but don't mindhaving two at a sitting."
"I feel this would go well with Spanish food."
"This beer seems like what a Belgian pale would be if Bud/Miller/Coors got a hold of one. What am I going to do with the rest of these?"
"so this is what i'm reduced to! drinking belgians in my parents' home! how horrid the life! pretty golden thing, perfect carbonation, a swift and constant rush of bubbles, perfectly clear. a little clove and banana on the nose and a bunch of banana tongue. thought this was around a 5% until i took a closer look, tastes smooth and easy but even still, i don't think i could drink this one all nite."
"Drinkability is decent. Not a bad Belgian pale ale but not great not worth seeking out."
"Served from a bottle with a thick, creamy, lingering head. There is a subtle, hoppy, herbaceous aroma which nicely complements the malty character of the blonde. There is a big malty character which is actually quite drinkable- more drinkable than I find most malty beers. While not terribly complex, this is definitely a beer that I will enjoy again..."
"D: Easy beer to drink. The spices in it make it enjoyable for the nice spring or fall nights. I will be drinking this beer frequently."
"D. This beer is not as drinkable for me as some of the other Belgian Ales that I have tried. At 6.6% abv it doesn't hide the alcohol as well as Duvel's 9%. A couple of these boozy beers is ass that I can take, which is weird because I usually love boozy beers."
"D: This one is somewhere between a session beer and a sipper. It has a slightly higher than average ABV, and it also has that Belgian funkiness that is expected, but can be tiresome after two or three. A pretty good introduction to anyone looking to get into BPA's."
"Gambled on a sixer of this; it was okay to try, but I wish I didn't get the six pack, personally. Good for people who like a yeasty, sweet beer. Could see this working best with heavier meat dishes involving sausage and so on."
"I know there might be so haters out there because this is an Inbev beer, but I really enjoyed this little Belgian Ale. It's not all that expensive and it's readily available which means you find this Belgian Ale right next to the Macro Lagers."
"D- Really a nice session beer for me."
"Tastes: Sweet malts, with some hops on the finish, citrus earthy tones. This beer is full of flavor and character. The cup does run'ith over. Worth picking up."
"Offers a decent feel yet drinkability suffers from the sweetness. This would likely be better masked with more carbonation but without said carbonation, the simple nature of the malts are a bit distracting. Compares rather unfavorably to Affligem Blonde, a beer I used as a reference point. Glad I don't have 5 more actually."
"Overall Impressions: Subtle (in flavor) Belgian ale. Very easy drinking and is a good Belgian style beer if the intent is to drink more than a few. Not my favorite Belgian, but OK."
"Cloverleaf Tavern, Caldwell, NJ: poured a golden yellow into a tulip, with one finger of bright white head, and decent lacing. The smell yielded clove, nutmeg, coriander, pear, hay, and even a hint of tartness (cranberry?). Was pleasantly surprised because so many people I know had bashed this beer. The flavor yielded all of the above in abundance, with a creamy medium body and decent carbonation. Maybe it was because my expectations were set so low, but I came away from this experience with a beer that I wouldn't mind sessioning."
"Easy to get a big, fluffy head out of this one, especially in a tulip glass. Darker yellow/somewhat orange in color and it is, in fact, clear-- a thing which most abbey ales are not. But there's a lovely bouquet of bananas and yeast, and an attractive column of bubbles that rise rhythmically from the bottom of the glass. Not overpowering in taste, but a respectable amount of the flavors you expect from this style: bananas, bread (but not banana bread...), some citrus. Makes a good weekday ale-- not the most potent or powerful Belgian ale, but still quite nice. And it comes in an affordable six-pack."
"D - This is a very commercial belgian blonde which is evident by the clean palate and lack of carbonation. However, it's more than sufficient for a belgian style blonde that you can find just about everywhere."
"D. This brew was sweet with almost no bitterness, it had a champagne quality, with the small effervesent bubbles."
"Smooth, but the alcohol is present nevertheless, making it ok drinkable."
"Pours a straw yellow with a thick white froth and decent lacing. Malty aromas of bread, cereal, lemon, cloves, subtle fruitiness, and banana/yeastiness lead to a similar flavors, dry, slightly astringent back side, & creamy mouthfeel, belgian yeastiness. There really isn't much to this beer in terms of aromas or flavors, but it's smooth and very easy beer to drink. For almost $10 a 6 pack, I wouldn't necessarily call this a fairly priced brew...pass."
"Trying this Belgian Pale Ale, Leffe, for the first time. With Leffe, clove is the dominant flavor from first sip to last. Pours a nice billowy head with good lacing. It's hue is pale golden. I was not prepared for the Clove taste when I bought it, but I approached my first sip with an open mind. I am open-minded when it comes to trying new or exotic beer styles, but a ""clove-dominated"" beer is really not going to be on my repeat buy list. I'm not going to put down the beer, as it tasted fresh, very fresh, to be shipped all the way from Belgium and be sitting in the Supermarket for who knows how long. The ingredients tasted of quality, this is good quality, but the price, $9.49, will probably prevent me from grabbing this again unless someone offered me a freebie, even though I was impressed with the quality and what the brewer (monks) is trying to do."
"When I'm at a bar filled with macros I'm always glad to resort to this one."
"I would drink again though!"
"I prefer the brune, but I'll never turn this one down. Not my favourite Belgian pale, but certainly a drinkable one."
"Nice brew indeed. Pours a dark gold body with a very fluffy white head. A slight smokey aroma that gives way to an extremely well hidden fruity boquet of aromas. Taste is similar to a nice wheat, bananas and apples. Full bodied and very smooth. I like it."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Medium carbonation, smooth to drink. Make it difficult to believe that it has ABV of 6.60 %."
"After giving 3's on everything else, I can't really justify anything other than an average drinkability. Maybe worth a try, but when there are other good option, I wouldn't bother again."
"This is a very quaffable beer which will no doubt find its way to my fridge in the future."
"Taste: Same as the smell with the fruit sweetness but the spiciness is a little more pronounced. There is nothing overwhelming which is good and bad. Nice flavor but a little bit to sweet."
"D - It just seems to me that this beer is a little one dimensional. It's not a bad brew but I have had better in this style. That being said, I would not turn this beer down if it was offered to me."
"Drinkability is good. I think this would make a good beach beer, even at almost 7%."
"Drinkability: Not the best Belgian beer available, but certainly still good (also cheaper and easier to find than many Belgians). A beer I'd recommend and would enjoy having again."
"The carbonation is nice, and it's easy to drink. In fact, it isn't bad. It's just sterile and safe. If, like me, you like the Belgian style, but can't afford to stay stocked with the greats - it's nice to have around. It's not bad, but it's not as great as the Belgian style can be."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and fruity. Taste is crisp and sweet. Lots of fruits and some spices. Feels medium bodied in the mouth. I could spend the night drinking this beer. Overall this is a quality brew."
"O: Not my favorite, but better than Miller Lite!"
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Duvel tulip. Poured a translucent orange with a golden hue. Two inch frothy, bright white cap crackled and popped as it slowly reduced its volume into a fairly consistent quarter inch skim. Some slashes of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose suggests candi sugar and a slightly metallic quality. Taste reveals candi sugar and also a little honey sweetness perhaps. Mouthfeel is light-medium, a little gassy and a bit prickly on the tongue. Decent drinkability, but carbonation is a little too aggressive. Much better on draft I have to say."
"D: No, I don't think I can drink more than one of these. Maybe a different time would yield a different result for me, but I don't think so. Too many other better Belgian beers out there."
"D - very easy drinking beer that is light enough to have a lot in a sitting."
"D - Crisp, dry. Seems pretty average for the style."
"D: Meeehhh, try as I might, I can't get into Belgians. I think this would be a pretty good session beer for someone who was."
"D - Refreshing and very balanced."
"Extremely drinkable and sessionable. THis is an outstanding Belgian Pale."
"This beer is wonderful when enjoyed chilled, but not ice-cold. It feels fairly thick in the mouth, not really expected out of a blonde, but overall I find this beer very drinkable, just not more than probably 1 or 2 in one setting."
"[Drinkability]: Fairly drinkable."
"D: It a good beer, but it just cost a lot to buy."
"Most Americans would say that Leffe Blonde is not a good representative of the style, but I would recommend trying it from the barrel prior to making that assumption. It's a totally different experience."
"Drinkability: Its really not that bad I guess. Grade inflation forces me to give this ""average"" scores, when compared to other Belgians, its considerably below average. It still tastes pretty good, but its not a good example of the style for me."
"Color is nice, foam is nice, and smell has the Belgian thing going for it. Belgian beers in general are my favorite, and although I've had much more distinct and delicious (and more alcoholic) Belgian brews, this one is my go-to brew. The taste is something I particularly find very appealing. Semi-sweet, but also complex enough to keep you interested. It's like a semi-highend escort, maybe. An escort you will call when your dimes are acting flakey."
"Holds at a solid one finger head of foam to small bubbles, chalk white in color, the lacing comes in sheets which slowly fall into the liquid below. Amber orange with a mildly darkening brown tinge, no real yellow influence, clear on the whole with loose bubbles visible. Sweet lemon peel, clove and nutmeg and muffin dough keep the nose friendly, hard toffee candies and apricot, peach fruit continues the trend, doesn't overplay the sweetness and the hops maintain a steady lowkey presence. Medium-bodied, very smoothly textured with a billowing foaminess through the attack. Comes across as semi-sweet with more obvious apricot, pear, peach fruit and sweeter dough to bread notes. Touch of bubblegum. The lemon citrus recedes some while the clove-led spiciness avoids any bite. Past the mid-palate starts to dry on the palate which brings out an undifferentiated grassiness. Plays it safe and stays very easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel ws a bit thin for a Belgian but still acceptable and not watery. Drinkability was good. This is a pleasant thirst quencher and a good entry beer for those just getting into Belgian beers."
"This is a very drinkable beer and for its price, a very good representation of some better and more complex Belgian styles. I would not go to great lengths to seek out this beer, but would not turn it down in the future."
"Medium bodied with decent carbonation. The finish is somewhat dry and sticky. I probably could have rated this a lot lower than I did, but if you're drinking it cold and fast, it at least can be enjoyable on a hot day. Definitely not something you can sip on like a true Belgian beer though. Actually this is something I might have liked if I was just getting into craft, but having tried much more complex Belgians, this one just doesn't hold up."
"Poured a golden orange color into a tulip glass with a white 1.5 finger head. Bottle looks great too with some nice gold foil with black leffe lettering scattered throughout. Smells of pear banana apple and mango. Tastes like bananas with a bubble gum/cotton candy finish. Little bit a hint of peanut butter in here as well. Very drinkable, I will definitely buy this again, and in greater numbers."
"D - Exceptionally light, and very very drinkable. Not sure if its worth the usual craft price, since I would consider it a great alternative party beer."
"The taste is light, balanced, and refreshing. This is a nice entry-level Belgian. It has a good amout of sweet and some tart to balance. The bubbles and sweetness almost give it a soft drink feel. Very pleasant and very drinkable."
"D - Good taste, weird feel, too much alcohol taste."
"D - Once again, easy enough to drink, other than the horrible taste that makes me want to spit it out."
"Medium bodied with low carbonation. A little bit syrupy, especially as it gets warmer. It improves a lot the closer it gets to room temperature. I might try it again, but there are other (better) abbey-style beers out there."
"Good beginner Belgian beer, easily approachable, and great to drink on a hot day. Worth a shot."
"Final Thoughts: All in all a good beer, even if it is a bit odd to the taste. One thing I should also note is that this beer hides it's 6.6% alcohol quite well. This could be a very good meal beer and I would drink it again if offered but I probably wouldn't buy it in anything but a mixed pack."
"Not the best belgian I have had. Not too bad."
"Overall, a nice Belgian, but nothing exceptional."
" If you want a quick buzz on a summer day, this is a good choice. the Raduise is a much better beer. I still prefer this over the brune. Make this not nearly as sweet and this would be a good grade higher. Too sweet for a plae ale to me. Very average beer as opposed to Duvel."
"D-Nice representation of the style. Very refreshing. Nice beer to start the night off or to start off dinner."
"Drinkability? Not bad, despite what is less than a stellar review"
"D - Not a bad blonde a good summer beer thats worth trying sometime"
"**5/9/10 I have to say I tried this beer again after a while with out it and I had to up the ratings even a little bit more, this beer to me is just so enjoyable, its got a good spice that keeps a nice level of sweetness in check, its such a great value and refreshing and good yet simple example of a belgian style, to me this is an abosolute great value every day kind of drinking belgian that gives you all that unique belgian flavor with out hitting you over head with the wallet, is it the best beer ever no but its pretty damn good all things considered"
"This is the beer they serve in restaurants in paris as an alternative to stella. It was the perfect afternoon draft on a hot day. Not as interesting as many belgians but different enough to be a welcome beverage at most bars in Paris. I had a glass last night at a local bar in new york and it was the same. A very good sweetness, but not cloying. Refreshing with a great mouthfeel, aroma and drinkability. Get it when it's available."
"Overall, a decent abbey that is widely available and good in a pinch."
"D - Not more than 2 at one go. This is a kicker"
"D: one feels like too many"
"Ive had this beer in the same 6 pack a year ago and it tastes much better than it did a year ago"
"T- Very wheaty beer. Some bite to it, but the spice is quickly drowned out by the heavy wheat. It's certainly a solid beer, but I don't get the pale ale aspect of it, unless that is what belgian pales taste like and maybe I just don't know."
"Beautiful light color, nice head that lasts until past half-glass. Nice aroma of roasted malt. Tastes slightly sweet, with an overall flavor of lightly roasted malt. Bitterness is low, but well balanced. This is a nice example of commercial Belgian blonde ale. Very drinkable, but beware of too many. If you like this, move on to some more flavorful Belgian ales."
"Overall, a decent beer, fairly refreshing, not overpowering in any way. A good introduction for people who haven't had Belgian style beers before - enough essence of Belgian character to entice a newcomer, but not such a strong Belgian character as to turn someone off who may not know what to expect."
"D - I could drink a couple of these beers and move to something else. It is a fun beer to drink outside on a warm day."
"We have here a sweet, enjoyable Belgian. It has fullness and complexity, and yet doesn't quite have enough of either. I feel myself just wanting more mystique, more subtle charms. It's like seeing a woman naked before you've even asked her to the movies. It's like you've experienced the hot body but you're wanting the whole experience; you want the soul as well."
"Poured from bottle into Belgium Ale chalice. One finger of white foam over a clear red amber ale. Slight malt smell with winelike overtones. Nice mild beer taste with a an aftertaste I associate with Muscadine wine. Very slight carbonation with good mouthfeel. I will definately drink this when available."
"Not a bad beer, not outstanding - an inoffensive basic belgian pale."
"Haven't had this for a couple of years, so I thought I'd revisit. It ticks most of the Belgian ale boxes but it seems to be lacking in depth and complexity. This is probably a good introduction to Belgian beers but not a classic example. Bananas, cloves, sweet malty yeast, blah, blah blah...not a bad beer but no show stopper."
"D: I really liked this brew, a lot better than Duvel and other light Belgians."
"D: Drinkable, I bought this due to the fact that I wanted a blonde Belgian but didn't want to spend $13 for a four pack of Duvel. This is quite affordable and solid. In my current budget drinking mode I could see myself having Leffe again."
"(D)- If you want a no nonsense belgian pale ale, then this is for you. A simple and straightforward beer to satisfy your belgian craving, however, there are far better brews than this if you are looking for something more."
"highly delicious. very tight. very sweet. and drinkable...to a point."
"Overall, its rather palatable, but leaves nothing to hook you and bring you back for more. I'll take a lot of other beers before this one, thanks."
"A so-so Belgian pale ale, everything a bit rounded, no real edges (in the good way) to be found here, and the alcohol just seems somewhat disjointed for an abbey ale. Refreshing and heady enough, I suppose, though, for a starter during an evening to be spent in the extended summer light."
"mouthfeel and drinkability are decent, i just wish it tasted better, but its not a drain pour or anything"
"Decent brew."
"D - I could drink this any time and on any occasion and be happy"
"Drinkability: While perusing the label for any possible dating, I caught some light through the bottom of the bottle and noticed just how downright clean the inside of the bottle looked. Sure enough, it's been filtered to a high degree and seems to have lost more than it's gained. Overall, it's a passable, acceptable, widely available Belgian blonde, though I dare say there're better blondes to be had out there."
"What a disappointment. I saw ""Belgian Abbey Ale"" and thought that surely it had to be a little good. Not terrible but not worth having really either. Just kind of blah."
"Quite easily drinkable, though with a finish that is a bit too cloyingly sweet. Nicely light in body, but by being filtered instead of bottle conditioned, it loses a bit of its appeal in comparison with other examples of the Belgian Blond style."
"D: Not bad, but not something I'd go looking for again. Just not a whole lot to write home about."
"One word sums up this beer. Diacetyl! And way too much of it. If I squint my pallet and really try to forget about the popcorn taste I can almost detect a little something that resembles other good beers of this style, but life is too short to waste time on beer like this."
"Had this about an hour ago. Poured a nice gold color with medium head that faded quickly and left a little bit of lacing. Smelled of spieces, oranges, sugar and yeast. Tasted of sweet, fruity yeast. Smooth, just slightly oily. Nice and sessionable for a Belgian."
"D- Thought this would be a good springtime beer. The spices kind of get old after a few glasses (starts to taste sort of artificial), but definitely a good change up. I think of this one as a budget Belgian beer."
"I had one of these at a nice bar with lots of beers on tap. Not sure what the hell I was thinking. I've had it in the bottle and wasn't impressed and on tap, still not. This was a couple days ago unfortunately and all I remember is being unhappy because I could have a V8. What?"
"cheers"
"A nice golden color pour with a medium sized soapy white head . Aroma is nice and spicy, some clove and floral hops.Flavor is yeasty, a little banana,cloves, some wheaty malt , a bit of hops,more spice,a bit of sweetness kind of like honey,malty clove finish,creamy mouthfeel,medium to high carbonation,very drinkable. Not a bad beer at all."
"Not a bad beer."
"Creamy mouthfeel but too watery."
"This is a worthy beer and many will enjoy it."
"Serving suggestion: Drink out of a traditional heavy glass Leffe chalice."
"I recieved a case of this from a good friend a while back...that's the only reason I drank a lot of it."
"My first impression, with the appearance, is a little disappointing considering the style of beer. The head is nice but I expect a cloudy and yellowed hazy beer that potentially has some floaties in it. This beer is golden and extremely clear. There's a nice banana and clove aroma. Fruity. Those flavors are also present with some yeasty characteristics and a slight hint of alcohol. It tastes like a Belgian Blond but seems a bit thin. I guess I expected a heavier, thicker, and more cloudy beer. Regardless, it's a good-tasting easy-drinker."
"Pours a crystal clear gold with thick white fluffy head. This is one of the most cleanest beers I've ever seen, they must filter it like crazy because I don't see a single thing in this beer, which is weird for a belgian ale. A full bready, spicy belgian yeast aroma with some fruity banana aroma. A really nice belgian yeasty sweet spice flavor, cinammon and clove. It is very, very smooth and there is a slight citrus tang in the finish. Yeah, that's pretty damn good. No real detectable hop flavor in this. As the glass warms up, the alcohol flavors pop out. It"
"Mouthfeel/drinkablilty: Light body with medium carbonation and a dry finish."
"D: It was alright, but there are other Belgian beers I've tasted that I'd much rather prefer to drink than this one. Easy to drink though."
"Even though this is a weak version of the genre it falls into, Leffe Blonde is a great introductory Belgian. It is also refreshing, and very drinkable."
"The drinkability of this beer is through the roof...I can easily drink at 12 pack of this in one sitting."
"D - pretty high, very drinkable despite wierd taste, perhaps i will try it again and revise my review."
"This beer poured with a nice two-finger head which disappated quickly. The color was light amber, and was clear. I would rate the appearance a bit above average, mostly because of the lace on the glass. The appearance, however, was the strongest aspect of the beer. The nose was very subtle with just a hint of a fruity smell. The taste had an initial strong clove taste, followed by the hops. The feel was mostly smooth, but a bit thin. I would not say the this beer left me wanting another right away. Overall, not what I would have expected in a Belgian beer."
"Mouthfeel: Pretty thin body, with a moderately high carbonation"
"lovely golden transparent colour, with a fresh looking frothy head when poured, which subsides relatively quicklyu, leaving a thin clingy trace behind. smells lightly of fruit and just a hint of spice. lacks complexity. the taste doesn't stay with you long, and deteorirates as the beer warms in the glass."
"D- easy drinkability best on a real hot summer day sitting in the lawn chair trying to relax"
"Leffe Blonde's not a bad Belgian Pale. The flavor's not bad at all, but it is spicy enough to work the nerves a little. Honestly, it's probably a little better than I expected. If the nose could be strengthened and the spices could be toned down just a tad, it'd be pretty damn impressive beer. As it is, I like it and would recommend checking it out. But, there's better Belgian Pales out there. No doubt about that."
"If you like sweeter beers with a thin mouthfeel, this is your bag."
"Clear gold color with a tinge of bright orange. Gorgeous fluffy off-white head leaves great lacing. Aroma is pretty one-dimensional. Prominent clove with a yeasty light ester note. Flavor is bananas and a touch of very sweet orange, with the aforementioned clove coming through as well. There's also a vague earthy note in the very end of the finish. Light, easy drinking, and inoffensive. Very simple but it does the job."
"Very drinkable."
"D- Not bad, but exports are always expensive. A bit over-done in the yeast department for a blonde."
"D: Pretty good. The biggest turn-off is the slight alcoholic taste towards the end of every sip. Still, I went through my six-pack in about a day. It's worth trying, though I'm sure there are better examples of the style."
"When I was on a steady diet of Duvel the bartender recommended I try this one as a cheaper relative. I found it to be a unique beer, different than the most Belgians. It has a very sweet flavor, but goes down smooth and crisp and goes good with most food. An above average beer."
"Drinkability: Well it tastes good with a good mouthfeel. Recommended. Its not the most complex beer you'll have, but its a good beer to have around. I could have a few of these with no problem"
"Not the best example of the style but a good value overall."
"Taste is better than I expected from such a mass produced Belgian giant. The yeast is in the forefront as it should be with pronounced clove and what I imagine a tangerine-banana cross would taste like. A touch of honey and hops cross the palate near the finish and make this a fairly refreshing beer overall. Nowhere close to the best Belgian blonde, but still a tasty option that can easily be found at a decent price. Wont have any problems finishing off the six pack I got."
"The yeast strain in this beer turns me off to it. It's not bad, but there are so many better belgians out there I figure: ""why bother?"""
"Conclusion: This is decent, but almost restrained...perhaps it's filtered, etc? Also, the alcohol is actually somewhat noticeable"
"D - Good, the alcohol is hidden, except for a bit at the end. It's much more drinkable and accessible than some of the other Belgian brews I've tasted."
"Drinkability is ok, but I would not be likely to come back for seconds here."
"Drinkability. Very easy to drink but just a little too sweet."
"Medium bodied beer with plenty of carbonation felt on the tongue. It is pretty sweet all the way through and then finishes with a little tartness at the end. Not bitterness like you might think from hops."
"Big Abbey fan. Bought this cause it looked interesting, even though I have read the not so great reviews. It pours a nice school bus yellow. with good lacing and decent head. Smells likes bananas with a slight citrus. Tatses like over-ripe bananas, but nothing too deep. I gave this to my roommate to try. He had one sip and gave it right back to me. His palate isnt as refined as mine, but nonetheless. He hated it. Overall drinkability. I would take this over macros of course, but not over very many abbeys."
"i finally i bought a 6 pack for 8.99 at my local fine foods store, and went straight home to pour a tall glass. it looks like a beautiful beer, very bright and golden, with carbonation bubbles finding their way surfaceward to take their place among a nice bubbly head that lingers a bit and lightly hugs the glass. smells nice, a bit fruity, with a refreshing effervescent quality. does smell a bit on the citrus side. the taste was a bit disappointing from the get-go. i think i expected more, but it really tasted more like a fruity lager than anything else,with notes of banana bread. the cloves while present don't really add to the beer...the alcohol flavor is there, but more pronounced on the finish, which i would have to describe as bitterly bland. not a whole lot going on here. as for the mouthfeel, quite thin, which was expected. i could probably polish off 5 or 6 of these, but wouldn't enjoy it as much as a should (except for the ABV, a clean 6.6). for an abbey blonde, i guess it fits the bill, but barely. i wouldn't recommend it however. in general a letdown."
"D- Looks and smells better than it tastes. I think they tried to do a little too much with the flavor and ended up with a mess."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not great either. I might try it again at some point in time but nothing I would go out of my way looking for. Pretty average."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Very mild but pretty tasty. I'm impressed because I didn't expect this to be good."
"D- i think the banana is too much and it overpowers the malts and the pear. It is nice to try but i wont have anymore. It would be good with crackers or bread."
"D: I really liked this brew, a lot better than Duvel and other light Belgians."
"I have only had this a few times before this one. This is a good beer - not in a league of its own by any stretch, but not forgettable either. It just tastes and feels as if it is missing something that could make it so much more. Still very drinkable and could be paired very well with a nice steak dinner. Overall a good brew."
"Also, they have a pretty unique website (which I'm guessing Beeradvocate doesn't want me to include in my review). Go check it out."
"Feels thick and sweet on the mouth. I don't think I could drink this all the time, but I would definitely drink it again."
"Overall an easy drinking beer that is good for a warm spring/summer day. Pretty good flavor, but nothing exceptional."
"Though the lack of yeasty haze, makes it a fairly poor example of the style, it's one I'll definitely buy again, when i'm in the mood, due to pretty solid flavors, and availability."
"Pale straw/honey color with a thin off-white head. Smells of banana and straw, cloves and a bit of citrus. The taste is heavy but smooth, the banana and cloves being the dominant flavor, some citrus and (I think) ginger surface slowly, huge banana finish. Surprisingly heavy body, but it's supported by the full flavors. Smooth and easy to drink, pretty well-rounded."
"Overall, if this is a crappy Belgian, (by it's category), than it's a good one. I would drink it again, and buy it again."
"D- I probably wouldn't have another."
"D - Looks solid, but falls short in all other respects..."
"I would purchase it again as it is reasonably priced (6.99 for a 6-pack where I went) and for that price it is hard to find something the relies more on fruity/floral flavor."
"Drinkability: Hints of nutty aftertaste but carbonation has me belching before im 1/2 way through the experience."
"Pours a seethru gold with minor lacing and a citric spiciness with hints of sweet malts and bread malts in the aroma. Has a fruit taste, mostly oranges from what I picked up, with some sweet malts and a light herbal hopiness that balances this light-to-medium bodied beer that is slick on the sides but has a little syrupy backbite. Pick up some bread and toffee malts as well for some reason. I like this beer, I know other people knock it and it is simplistic but having one occasionally never hurt anyone."
"Drinkability: Cloyingly sweet and not really that complex or interesting, which makes its drinkability lower. The body is to full and carbonation could be higher."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Got one of these from a friend. Probably not something I would buy again, but worth buying once and giving it a try."
"Fairly average Belgian pale and not one to rave over. Perhaps a good starter beer for introduction for lighter beer imbibers to the Belgian world, but not the best foot to get off on. I'll stand by Duvel and Corsendonk."
"Overall, this is only an average belgian ale due to the low drinkability."
"Pours a soft, sedimentary/effervescent-laden golden yellow body... beautiful white head leaves picturesque lacing seen only in internet photos--an especially good bottle? Soft hoppy scents that invite without agitation--a slightly off-color scent warms its way in late... light, almost fizzy presentation--effervescent as expected, nutty at the teeth...citrus flavoring takes its lead with a fresh bit of bread at points(!)... crisp and short with little aftertaste.... the understanding that InBev sells this makes an unbiased review difficult--an above-average Belgian that minds its manners through it relatively low alcohol content and its swift presence in the mouth--I recall my first chalice at Avignon outside the gardes, and the experience was magical to me--this noncorked bottle still measures well with the more distinguished abbeys..."
"Don't drink and review."
"You know, sometimes my better half has some pretty good ideas."
"Picked up a six pack this past weekend. Poured into my Leffe goblet. Hazy orange color. Pretty nice sized white head, but it did fade after a bit of time. Somewhat sugary smell, almost like cotton candy. Taste was what I expected: kind of doughy and yeasty, with a touch of sweetness and hops. A bit of slickness on the mouthfeel coated my throat. The abv was definitely noticeable in this brew. For a mass produced Belgian beer that's relatively widely available, it's not bad. When I want something above average and I am in a pinch selection-wise, Leffe is good choice."
"pours up a brilliant golden color with a decent white head. great lacing on my Dixie Cup. the nose is very sweet, bananas, subtle mellow lemons. the taste is the milk of beers (in a totally not milkish kinda way), crisp hops, kinda sweet with a dry clean finish, bananas, medium bodied, med carbo. A damn fine beer."
"This is a decent Belgian beer though not quite as complex or drinkable as some of the better Belgians I've had. Decent."
"This is a medium bodied Belgian that did very little to stand out from the pack. I have heard others comment on this tasting like an over filtered beer and I agree 100%."
"Wow. This isn't what I remember. Really really sad. The aroma and taste are both muted and kinda dull. It still looks decent and manages decent drinkability, but the previous review was an A-... It is being re-scored to more accurately reflect the beer the way I see it now."
"I like this beer. I only had one bottle which was the only thing that I wasn't happy with when rating the Leffe Blonde. It will definitely be among the regulars."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It came forth with a excellent amount of foam and reduced to a lingering amount of head on the goldish orange beer. The aroma of banana is the first thing that is picked up out of this beer. The other tones that the nose picks up is the spices and malts of the beer. The taste follows similar suit in its characteristics. Overall a great beer that I will return to when wanting a lighter beer."
"D - Very easy to drink, could have many more in one sitting."
"D- I'd certainly have another."
"MF&D - the thickness of the beer intertwined with the overall sweetness and lackluster taste make for an average if not disappointing beer. nothing horrible, but nothing I would venture to try again in the bottle."
"Overall, this is a pretty nice and well balanced beer. Not a very memorable Belgian, but one that is easy to enjoy no matter the season or surrounding."
"A pretty good beer right here. Pours a light golden color with tons of head. Tons of effervescence going on, making it pretty appealing. Taste is very creamy upfront and smooth with some nice yeasty taste to it typical of most Belgians. Almost 7% ABV is hidden very well as this is very drinkable. Pretty solid beer."
"Poured into shaker from bottle. Excellent experience. More pleasant, tasty, flavorful than the Duvel I had moments earlier. Golden color, white head, hints of malt, citrus. Not too bitter, Smooth, enjoyable, worth the effort and would buy again. Cheers!"
"D = I enjoyed this bottle. I somehow think of this as a winter beer probably from the warming memories of it on tap a few years back."
"Medium body, the lack of carbonation seems to be a drawback of this beer as it turns what could be a creamy texture to a syrupy texture. Left a pretty unpleasant sweet aftertaste in my mouth that I kept burping up the rest of the night, not exactly enjoyable."
"D- A very enjoyable beer that is light, tasty, and relatively inexpensive. It won't blow your doors off, but it would be an excellent beer to get some people started down the road of Belgians."
"I would drink it again if it was free, or the only thing available, but I would definantly not search this one out. Expected better."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonation, with a bitter finish that last for a few moments. The beer is well made. I like the buttery notes with a nice malt back bone that stands up to the hops in this beer."
"This was brought over for Christmas,a variety pk,Leffe was the only one i hadn't tried,and i could'nt wait to pour this one.Poured a cloudy off yellow orangey color,nice thick white foamy head,impressive,that stuck around for a long while and left some really nice sticky lacing.Nose was fruit and spices,orange and stale corn with a hint of stale grass all mixed in there in the aroma,all that just threw me off,i new what i was in for and was not liking it.First sip and...hmmm sweet,a hint of clove and spices,mild fruit.2nd sip,sweetness comes in a little stronger,really notice the fruits,orange and a little lemon,cloves and spices seem a bit strong.3rd sip,,,,ahhh...no like this one,sweetness really getting to me and the strong spices,mouthfeel was very full bodied,heavy feel and kinda dry on the finish.All in all,this just wasn't my type of beer,sure glad it was not me that bought it."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a straw, golden color with a huge, creamy white head. The smell is malty and has some spicey pheonols present. The flavor also highlights the spicey yeast profile and malty backbone. The beer may be slightly skunked, but the best before date is 12/26/09 so it would seem like it should be ok. The mouthfeel is light to medium in body and has a thick, viscuous head that sticks around in the glass for a while. Overall, a drinkable beer."
"D- the taste is pleasant and it goes down smoothly, but it is a lot heavier than expected-- in a good way, but the drinkability suffers"
"A fine brew that has a little more body then most Belgian Pales. Light carbonation let's you taste the beer and reminds you that this isn't just a plain ole macro."
"Not bad, but there are better Belgian blondes to be had. I was somewhat confused by the clarity, and the sweetness is a bit much."
"D: Pleasant to drink, and goes down easily. I'd probably pick up a sixer of this again as a relaxing spring/summer beer."
"Drinkability: very high"
"(rated Dec 1, 2007)"
"An OK beer, not up to par with other Belgians- a filterd, generic Belgian."
"I got this beer in a variety pack from World Market. THis beer poured a nice amber color with a nice head. It has a fruity flavor with some strong spicy flavors that I personally just do not like. This is not a bad beer but I do not like the flavor myself. It is not one that I would buy again but it does have some quality."
"As a Belgian beer it goes best with typical food of that country such as oysters and such. A good but not overpowering taste, pretty good smell and strong (6.6% ABV as I recall) but can still be drunk as a session beer, by me anyway. It can be hard to find in Dixie but well worth it if you find it. My local HEB just started carrying it awhile ago, think I will get some for nostalgia."
"This was the first non-domestic beer I drank, so I must credit it to having got me into the world of beer drinking. That said, after trying several hundred other brews, I have recognized that the quality of this one is only above average, at best (when compared to other belgian abbey beers). However, this beer holds a special place in my heart and I still enjoy it every now and then (especially during the holidays)."
"Orange-gold with a big white head. Spice, malt, and yeast in the nose. Smooth, malty taste with some orange peel and coriander. Not a lot to overwhelm, which underwhelms. More like a Belgian with training wheels. Doesn't try anything too strong or risky."
"This one pours a full golden color, with smells of sweet bread. The flavors had sweet spices that stayed balanced all the way to the finish. I was not a big fan of Belgians until I was introduced to the Abbey Pale Ale style. This one is a good everyday example of the style and not too high in alcohol, so I could drink a lot of it."
"D - This will be the last one of these I'll have. It wasn't terrible, but neither was ""4 Christmases"" and I won't be experiencing that again either."
"M&D-This one really tastes better either well-chilled, or border-line warm. As the temperature rises and gets close to cellar temperature, the body becomes slightly syrupy, and strings out the sweetness, which unbalances it. As it warms more and approaches ambient temperature, the body gets lighter, and reminds me more of a spicy tea. I drank a lot of this beer in France back in the day, and it is associated w/many fond memories. Not the best example of the style, but still very drinkable, and sessionable if right out of the fridge."
"I wish they would make the braun readily available in the U.S. I actually enjoyed this more while I was in Belgium but it is really hard to find back here."
"The taste is raisiny sweet with some honey, alcoholic spiciness, fruitiness, and plenty of bread. It's on the sweet side but smooth and quite tasty."
"I was happy to see the pub across the way with a whole Belgian draught line and remembered that I hadn't had a Leffe in quite a while. So...the golden blonde poured nicely by a pro and its aroma had a sharp fruit quality to it and a nice clear golden hue with dense head. The flavor was both creamy & pure, but overall quite sweet. The sweet fruitiness overwhelmed the very mild hops and left a lingering sweet-corn aftertaste. An ok desert-like beer, but too many would feel like a candy-corn overdose..."
"D - Slightly drinkable, nothing special here"
"Pours an a clear light oragne with a sticky white head that hangs around and leaves great lacing on the goblet. Smells of cloves and bubblegum sweetness but not much else. Taste is of nebulously fruity sweetness (too sweet!) with insufficient hops. Its sugariness actually makes me cringe. I have no beefs with the mouthfeel because the weight is fine and the best part of this beer is the moment you swallow it and are happy its no longer in your mouth. I'm not going to totally pan its drinkability because it occurs to me that this beer could possibly work as an after dinner drink/dessert."
"Pours a bright golden color with a sizable white head that has good retention. A very thick cap sits atop the beer for the entire duration of consumuption. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Tiny carbonation bubbles continuously rise. It would be hard to imagina a Belgian Pale Ale looking any better than this. Nice vinous quality in the aroma. A hint of cloves and coriander is also apparent. The taste is more spice from the yeast rather than fruity esters. Spicey finish as well. Light body with a nicely paired carbonation. A good pale ale. It lacks the funkiness of Orval but for people who do not like Brett in their beers, this may be a better alternative."
"Leffe is a seemingly smooth beer compared to most Belgian Pale Ales, but it's drinkability doesn't come close to that of Duvel. It has a dark, golden body with a sizable head. This beer smells like yeast more than anything else, but upon consumption it has some spicy and sweet qualities to it. Not a bad Belgian beer by any means, but there are much better."
"D - Refreshing, drinkable, but not tons of character. Maybe a bit sweet if you have several of them."
"A very nice Belgian style ale that pours a liquid gold color with a slight head with little lace. It has a great smell of banana, clove, and dark/caramel in the background. It tastes very light and fresh with an initial sweetness of fruit but finishes a little tart, like many belgians....almost a gueuze type finish. Overall a nice beer, but nothing like many small brewery Belgians. It's nice you can find it most places and a great alternative for any occasion."
"D- I find this one to be good but perhaps a bit cloyingly sweet. I'd like to see a bit of hop presence in this one. As it is, I'll probably drink this again but won't rush out to buy more."
"I would say its drinkable, but theres not much to it that I wouldn't pick this one up again."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor isn't quite there for me for one. I guess as a whole it's just missing the mark a bit. But it's not completely horrible."
"VERY drinkable. Probably the drinkablest(?) Belgian I've had yet."
"Pours a rich golden-orange and is topped with a fluffy white head that sticks around forever. Very nice looking. Smells of sweet malts, bananas, and some subtle spice. It's light to medium-bodied with notes of vanilla and spice on the palate. There's something inexplicable about this beer. It's subtle to an extent, but keeps you going and wanting more. Refined and tasty, but not too big either. Give it a shot and figure it out for yourself."
"EDIT: As the beer warms it gets slightly syrupy. More of a sipping beer, really. A little too sweet unless the beer is colder."
"This beer tastes as good as it looks. I do have to admit that I was a little disappointed that maize was used as an adjunct but given my love fro this beer I'll overlook it. The pour finished with a white creamy head that looks every bit as good as the advertisements. The taste was smooth and malty with a nice hop balance. This is the kind of beer you can have with pizza or a nice filet mignon. Excellent!"
"This is the first time I have tried this style, and I was so pleased with it that I will make it a point from now on to buy a six-pack of this beer at least once a week."
"VERY drinkable ... i.e. solid 6 pack for a warm evening."
"Good gateway to Belgian beers..."
"D: For me, maybe just a little too much of the cloves...got very sick of it, & was looking for a palate cleanser quite quickly."
"Medium to full body, heavy in the mouth. Tough to have more than one if you have other options. Not the best I've had of this style, but by far not the worst. When I was in Belgium, this is one of the brews they pushed at the tourists at the bus stop restaurants/tourist traps. Once you got away from those areas, it all but disappeared from the drink menu."
"D: Highly quaffable. The taste is clean enough that you could happily drink this all night."
"Comes out of the tap a nice clear golden color, with a decent head. Aroma is strong and malty and has a decided lemony overtone. Flavor is malty and strongly of citrus, mainly lemon and nicely tart. Texture is smooth, and finish is refreshing and satisfying."
"Excellent Beer!"
" ~ I will suggest to mt BA buds that they partake in this foreigner."
"Fairly average and non-offensive Belguin Pale Ale. It definitely seems they aimed this one toward the masses."
"D: Nothing to be ashamed of. Order this one if it's on the beer list and there are no other top Belgian brands available."
"Something to drink towards the end of a good night. Not exactly a closer beer but maybe a pre closer?"
"Very enjoyable session beer. Could easily kick back and drink them all day long."
"Drinkability- It's a fine beer. But, on the second round, I moved on to another beer. Worth a try."
"I'm a big fan of the Leffe beers, for some reason - the sweetness and straightforwardness really does it for me, for some reason. This one is likewise a solid brew: yellow color with an okay head. Nose is huge in yeast and fruitiness, and the flavor follows through. Tons of candy in there as well. Body's fine for the style. Overall, I'd definitely take these over most of the swill out there."
"The taste is good but not brilliant. The first splash of taste is very Belgianesque sweet malts, some candied sugars, cloves, bananas, fruitness and bready, creamy malts. But then, the beer sinks in caliber, more alcohol tinges enter, a dryness comes on board, and some rather overly sweet bubblegum fruitiness takes over. The beer isn't particularly syrupy, but the sweetness becomes a bit cloying. This beer has hints of excellence, but it misses the mark after the nose and midsection. Not a bad beer, and a pretty good Belgian standby if nothing else is available."
"This is a delicious Belgian. I had the bottle type and I poured it into a pilsner glass a little too quickly and the head was enormous. On my second round I chose the classic pint glass and the head was a bit more tame but so was my pour. The color is of the deep golden viriety and there was about 1 inch of head. It smelled sweet and malty and possible had some citrus notes. It seemed heavier on the malt and the hops were drowned out. Carbonation was present but not overpowering. The smell convinces you the taste will be smooth and on the sweeter side. This is not a heavy ale but its look is deceiving. It was filling but was an easy pint to finish. There was lacing left the entire way up the glass. I'd gladly have another."
"D: high,, good beer to tackle a Steak Frite in Paris, good everyday beer, thought I tried the Bottle here and was not impressed...."
"Poured from the bottle a nice copper color and nice white head. Head settled quickly. Aroma of hops, malt and yeast are easily picked up. Taste has slight hops, pepper, sweet malt. Nice, balanced, strong body and flavorful mouthfeel. A little dry. Drinkable and enjoyable. Not a favorite, but not bad either. Worth a try and take one if offered."
"D. This is a very good BPA. If you're looking for a great hop profile, I'd look elsewhere. If you're looking for a very well balanced, complex belgian style pale ale, here it is."
"D- refreshing and unoffensive but when going belgian i usually look for something with a bit more character."
"D - 4.5 I DIG THIS STUFF! its on the sweet side but unique as a change of pace, the wife digs it. Sweet wine drinkers tend to like this brew."
"D- Decent not my favorite but worth a try for sure."
"D> After a couple of boots of this last year, I can't drink too much of it. But it did the trick for me tonight, and its really pretty consistent, just a bit simple."
"She ain't half bad; slightly chilled. What mostly kills this over processed beauty is her fellow kin within the style. Compared to her straight ""A classmates", it appears she has to settle for a grade of ""Working under potential."" But do not be fooled; a pleasurable drink. Dulce de Leche provides a sweet bed for a drop of vanilla. A nice deep spice that counters the caramel syrup. Possibly a touch of bourbon? Take the advice and drink a tad under room temp to put the esters in full overdrive. A cold one brings out grape reminiscent of plum soda and the carbonation is a bit too sharp. You will probably be expending more energy avoiding this one since its available everywhere...dive in, take a swim. Then pay an extra buck for the others in the family."
"Well, all and all, a nice beer, not mediocre, not amazing. Good."
"Flavor tracked the aroma, surprise. It is smooth and light but in my limited experience for this style I would expect more flavor."
"D - Easy drinking, smells and looks very nice but the taste is too simple."
"The beer's weight is too much for its limited complexity imho."
"This was a very boring beer for me. It had a good golden color with a frothy white head. The smell was just of sweet malts, caramel and a mild alcohol. Nothing really exciting. The taste was just as boring. It was good, but plain caramel with a brown sugar finish. It was a drinkable beer being low carbonation and a full bodied beer."
"Purchased at Kokoman Fine Wines and Liquors in New Mexico."
"An excellent summer brew that's easy to drink and suitable for a wide range of palates. Well bodied, semi-sweet, and texture-ly appeasing."
"I'm giving this one 8's all around and for good reason, this is one great Abbey Ale. Aroma is slightly wild and yeasty, I also detect a wheat quality. Sharp golden color favoring a faint amber tint, the pour created a massive white head that took it's time to simmer down. Good lacing with nice carbonation. Mouthfeel is unbelievably filling with a sweet smooth finish. Awesome flavor, reminds me of a hefe-weizen at first but more complex. That familiar Belgian earthiness is present, backed by a peppery spicy and floral taste. What an all around great one we have here, I can imagine enjoying this on any occasion."
"I had a couple of these last night and they seemed far more sweet than ones I have had in the past. I don't know if they have changed anything, or if my tastes have simply changed a little, but it was unpleasantly sweet last night... That's what she said."
"Huge foamy white head no matter how slow you pour. Smell is equal maltiness and hops, like it's flavor. Well balanced taste with plenty of both hops and malt. It is a bit heavy but is has a very dry finish which makes it so drinkable. Im disappointed that you only get 11.2 ounces. An empty bottle of the stuff ways more than a traditional empty beer bottle. I know small batch euro beers often come in thicker bottles but since InBev owns them, I'm now assuming that .8 ounces of beer costs more than .8 ounces of glass. I'll probably never drink it again."
"D-I could have a couple I guess, you really have to like spiced beers, or be in the mood for one, the clove taste is so strong that if you aren't expecting it (as I wasn't) then it catches you off guard."
"Okay mouthfeel, thin and light, but it's got enough going on and is drinkable enough to be excused. Not great, but worth a try since it's so widely available."
"As the name entails, a golden, blondish colored brew with a decent head. Smell has slight tone of cloves and sweet notes. This beer has a unique taste that is sweet and refreshing with carbonation and then an aftertaste that switches one fruit for another that is more mild. Highly drinkable and a great summer beer as well as for winter days when you are summer dreaming. The body could be more full though. I think the brewer filtered it a little too much. Unlike most blondes, doesn't have a great body but ideas that head in the right direction. Think of it as more Gwyneth Paltrow rather than Scarlett Johansen."
"drinkability: high"
"Poured into a red wine glass, which is a little embarassing, but it's the closest in shape to the proper glassware. Moderate head, pale golden orange color. Just shy of being perfectly clear. Very attractive smell, grainy with some yeast and a fresh sweetness. Taste isn't as good as the aroma would make you expect. Too processed. Initial impact is highly carbonated and lacks much flavor. Then there's a sweet bread taste. Mouthfeel is great; high, but not excessive carbonation, and significant body. Light lacing. Very drinkable, but failed to meet my (very) high expectations."
"D-A good starter on the Belgians. Not one of the Belgian Pale Ales in the category. Too much cloves."
"Fairly drinkable beer, though a bit sweet for my tastes. This is what I'll drink if my only other choices are Maes and Jupiler."
"Taste: Pears, apples and other bright summer fruits. Spicy yeast character, no hop bitterness at all. Dry finish."
"I absolutely loved the amazing flavors and complex combination of ingredients in this brew. If I had a criticism at all, it would probably be that it was just a little bit sweet for me. Is it too sweet? Depends on your tastes, I guess. I would definitely put this on my ""anytime"" beer list. Recommended."
"Overall: nice abbey beer. Complex and spiced. Not the best Belgium Blonde but highly enjoyable and reasonably priced."
"D: All in all, this is a pretty good example of a Belgian golden ale. I wonder if my review is better because it wasn't stored in a bottle, wasn't slowly shipped overseas and was bought much closer to the source."
"Taste is really sweet - stick in the back of your throat, hard to swallow sweet. I tasted sweet honey like flavors, spiciness, but the alcohol bite was not masked by these and stuck out really bad. No hop or malt flavor, just a sickening sweetness. I really tried to like it, let it warm up, but just struggled through the sweetness the whole glass."
"D/M- has a medium body with an average smoothness, but i find that it would be more situated as a dinner paring drink, somthing to go with a nice steak, then something i would drink on a regular basis. However i did find it quite refreshing"
"If they could figure out a way to make this less sweet then it would be a much improved beer. The first one was ok, but by the middle of the second I was just trying to finish it and get it over with."
"Average mouthfeel, but too sweet to drink more than one or two. I may try this again on-tap."
"D- Easy drinking beer. I could see this one being a gateway Belgian for some people."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for a lighter Belgian."
"D: A bit too sweet on the get go and the end may be a bit too bitter after that initial sweetness. Listen to Big-head Todd and the Monsters when quaffing this coolass brew dudes."
"Leffe Blonde. A hard pour produced a golden beer with a big white head. Belgian notes in the nose: yeast, spice, and pear. A little weak on the palate except in the sweet category. Overtly sweet with an earthy fruity background that lingers in the mouth afterward. Void of bitterness. Fairly smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. A run of the mill brew and a tad too sweet for my tastes."
"A great beer for a 90+ degree day like today."
"D - A bit light of yeast character, but enjoyable and drinkable. Nice earthy hop character."
"D: I could drink these all night, and for $9.99 a sixer, maybe I will."
"Pours out a light orange color with an average fluffy head; very bubbly. The aroma is of lightly roasted malts and sugar. The taste is of citrus and heavy on the malt. Definite orange and peach flavor. it has a nice carbonation to match this style. Overall this beer is just too average. I feel it is the run-of-mill Belgian Pale Ale...it just doesn't do it for me."
"Poured into pint glass. Great two-finger head that remained throughout the entire drink. Good lacing. Color was a light gold. Smelled of sweet fruitiness, and tasted oh so sweet. Taste reminds me of pecan pie. Leaves a slight nutty aftertaste. Very smooth, with light to medium body. Enjoyed this beer very much."
"All in all, a respectable, but not great beer."
"This is basically a shadow of a good Belgian Pale, but there isn't anything actually wrong with it."
"D - Mass-marketed or not, this is a very well done Belgian blonde. It defines the style. If all mass-marketed beers were of this quality, the world would be a better place."
"Poured in a Leffe glass, big clean whit head with lace. Golden too clean colour for an unfiltered beer. Smell of banana, clove, coriander, honey, spices. Too sweet flavor, taste of banana, clove, some pepper, fruits. Good one, but give it to me anytime as it used to be..."
"I tried this beer on February 21, 2008 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. This beer poured an translucent orangy-gold with a thin, creamy white head. The aroma was slighty yeasty with some malty and hoppy hints. The mouthfeel was full-bodied, creamy, and amply carbonated. The taste was dryish, yeasty, with a little bit of sweetness. A very good beer."
"Out of the bottle it pours a crystal clear gold color with nice bubblage and good sized white head with lots of lace. It offers a light alcohol and wheat and juniper aroma. Very nice midland body with tingly carbonation and lots of wheat and yeast flavorings. Nothing highly special but likeable enough and a drinkable brew."
"Poured a clear golden macro color with a decent head and minimal lacing. Carbonation is what's expected from a Belgian blonde. Smell is sweet, malty, bready, and slightly yeasty. Taste is much the same, with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp at the end. There are much better Belgian brews out there, but I still like this one."
"Definitely a drinkable beer, not something I would try to keep on hand for everyday, but not a bad beer to try from time to time. Not something I would serve to try to inmpress another beer lover."
"D - Damn fine beer, but not one of the best BPA's out there. I'd definitely drink this again."
"overall drinkability on this on is pretty good. it's a light-ish blonde ale that isn't hard to drink and beats the pants off an american macro."
"D= Though this ale is a bit too sweet, it is still a fine Belgian golden. Though it seems an odd thing to say, this beer can actually stand being served slightly colder than other Belgians. All in all, a good beer at a decent price."
"This beers color was a light amber/dark golden color had a yeasty/estery aroma . 1st taste stood out as abeing typical to style with a combination of malt/yeast/fruit all coming out . A very nice light finish a very drinkable beer and a very enjoyable beer . Though this style of beer is not my favorite this beer opened my eyes to the enjoyability of belgian style beers ."
"D: Despite its debits, this is a drinkable beer. Granted, this doesn't necessarily make it a brilliant example of the brewing art, but its not bad either."
"Pours a dark gold with about an inch light white head. Smells of bread yeast, alcohol, and sweet malt. Very full body. The taste is almost sickeningly sweet on top of a distinct yeast flavor. I couldn't even make my way all the way through this beer- will not buy again. I think it's too sweet and filtered for a Belgian Blonde. On top of that, I'm not a huge fan of the style in the first place, which is why this is getting dumped in the trash."
"Better than expected,I think Inbev/Anheuser Busch association causes some of the negative reviews on B.A."
"I brought a six pack of this to a straight college party. Everybody thought I was nuts and then I gave them a taste and they ended up loving it. I guess it is not really that hard to beat a keg of Natty Light. I poured it into the first available glass. Looked smooth and clear golden sunset color. Smelled of yeast esters and somewhat banana. Tastes switches in and out of malt and yeast with a bitter finish. I enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability is decent, but again it is a rich, sweet beer, it is really best as an after dinner beer."
"Pours out a clear gold brew with a huge head.Fairly high carbonation.Has a grassy hop like scent very faint. Taste is very unusual, its very much belgian but lighter. I was expecting this to taste like a lager from its appearance.Its a little too sweet for me.Mouthfeel not too bad. An ok beer."
"It is a fine Belgian Pale - not very interesting. Orval does it much better."
"MF&D - Creamy,with lots of carbonation. finishes slightly oily. Not the Best Belgian ale, but very drinkable."
"Disclaimer - this is my second beer review (and I'm using my first as a template)."
"D: Good drinkability, certainly not one of the better Belgians but a good intro into the style. Very light, refreshing, and fruity."
"Pours a very clear, pale golden color with a huge frothy head of large off white bubbles. Aroma is spicy- ginger and yeast. Taste is more spice, ginger and nutmeg... Reminds me of a ginger snap cookie. Medium to light body. Creamy, spicy aftertaste lingers. Easy to drink and interesting. Better than many blondes I've had recently and much cheaper. I'll keep this one on hand!"
"Not much to add except that this beer is drinkable and a decent beer to have every now and then. No, do not try to compare it to the greats. It is a light -heavyweight fighting in the heavyweight division,but that's o.k.-I like underdogs."
"This beer seems to be getting pushed harder and harder in my area and routinely gets placed in the ""Best of Belgium"" sampler. This also includes Stella and Hoogarden. There is so much wrong with that concept. Anyways, this beer may get a bit of bad press because of the macro tarnishment, but it is still nice to see Belgians getting into hands of people even if it is in this way. Color is bright gold with a very nice airy white, soapy head that leaves very nice lacing along the edges of the glass. The body is extremely clear with no yeast sediment to be found. This was a bit too clean for me, but others may prefer it. Aroma is slightly floral with a biscuity profile and decent yeast presence. Taste is crisp when the beer is cold. As it warms, the sugars come through but are overtaken by a corn-like vegetal flavor. A bit grainy at the swallow and dry with a slightly synthetic feel. Not a bad beer and one that I would definitely get in a restaurant if faced with few options, but not what I would call truly Belgian. It bit too polished and clean."
"Smell is somewhat sweet and malty with a mild presence from the belgian yeast. Sweet, creamy and smooth flavor of honeyed maltiness. Not cloying or overly dry and bubbly like some belgians can be. Extremely smooth, creamy and drinkable, especially for a style I'm not generally fond of. This is definitely worth another try and I was impressed."
"D: Fairly easy to drink... nothing too special, but it pairs alright with a cheese plate."
"Poured from a bottle, it's a decent looking beer. Golden, and oddly crystal clear for a Belgian pale ale, but it's got a nice white head that has decent lacing if you're into that. The nose is rather mild, with sweet fruity notes, but nothing noteworhty. The flavor is mostly sweet malt with a touch of spices. No noticeable hop flavor. The finish is kinda syrupy sweet, not exactly to my liking. The mouthfeel is pretty average. As far as drinkability goes, I don't think I would want to have more than two. The sweet syrupy character of this beer could get to be rather cloying beyond one or two."
"This beer is pretty satisfying, and it won't offend many palates."
"d: A nice blond, very easy drinking. More going on in the flavor dept. than many of the more plain blondes. A pleasing and subtle flavor makes this enjoyable, but nothing to right home about."
"Overall - Contrasting and interesting aroma and taste. Superior to the brune but let down by the sickly sweet mouthfeel."
"Quite nice really. Not front of the line stuff here, but not far back from the front few."
"A nice drinking beer. A good light start for those interested in sampling Belgian style beers."
"Verdict: Drinkable at best but too sweet to be a belgian pale ale. Closer to a dubbel than a Belgian Pale Ale."
"Overall this is a great beer; moderately priced (around $8 for six) with a solid ABV and a great taste you don't come across every day."
"As stated, carbonation is pretty high, but it works. Medium body, goes down pretty quick. I think I'd tire of this after a couple bottles, but until that point I'd rate it quite drinkable."
"Pours a straw like golden color, very effervescent with a massive white fluffy head. Aromas are quite estery with bright clove and citrus, a little banana, and an overall candy like perfume boquet. On the palate, the spices continue to come through, though it has a nice firm malty, toasty flavor. The hops are evident in the finish with a slight bitter note; the floral sense presupposes Nobel varieties, maybe Saaz. A medium high carbonation delivers a nice fluffy, creamy mouthfeel, medium low body and a nice phenolic finish. Overall, I always passed this beer up, but I'm glad I gave it a shot."
"Overall I am very pleased with this beer. I bought a six pack of bottles (with two other Belgian beers in an 18 pack) and I can imagine that I will finish the Leffe Blondes first."
"D - For the sweet taste yes, but the carbonation and earthy hops, throw this one off a little."
"Quite nice, and worthwhile, but not complex."
"The taste was biscuit malty up front with a faint hopiness on the finish. In the mouth it is highly carbonated leaves a bitterness on its exit. Overall a pretty good beer. I think it might go good with a meal like a meat lover's pizza or burger to cut the fat."
"A good example of a Belgian Blond. Nice rocky white head that was very large but fell a bit quickly. Straw colored and brilliant clarity. Phenolic nose. Nice yeast character in the taste along with a subtle fruitiness and grainy finish. Light bodied but full of character."
"Beautiful amber gradient with light bubbles and a thin head that retained just a little bit throughout. The nose was floral and had light hints of tomatoes. Very tart. The first taste was almost spicy, kind of barbequed, a taste which followed through the finish, though it seemed to evolve as such. A fruity and flowery taste also showed up from time to time. Overall, I'd say it's pretty drinkable, if not an ordinary purchase."
"D: I found this quite drinkable and would go back for more. A nice beer all by itself, but even better with food."
"The flavors were fine, but the overall blend of them needs some balance and work."
"Not a bad beer, but a little too sweet for me."
"Very, very enjoyable brew! I will drink this beer again!"
"Good beer, not a seesion beer, but, a change of pace for me."
"I've had Leffe Blond more than a few times, but now that I've reviewed it, I probably won't buy it unless I am going to be brewing a BPA and need some for comparison."
"En bouche, la Leffe passe agréablement bien. Un sucré mielleux bien présent mais pas excessif et un arrière goût quelque peu fruité avec presqu'aucune amertume fait que cette bière est très facile à apprécier. Elle manque toutefois quelque peu de complexité. Bière agréable facile à apprécier!"
"One of the most exceptional colors I have ever seen! Pours a wondrous orange and amber color with possibly the biggest head ever ( it literally sat at 2-3 inches, until I could no longer contain myself and had to start drinking it). The taste has a nice heartiness to it, with some great biscuit flavors coming through and a delicate balance of malt and hops. The finish is very clean with a little sweetness. The head alone made this beer a great choice for me."
"Overall a lovely beer."
"This is a fine Belgian Pale from Leffe."
"In the end, I wound up drinking 3 before telling myself I needed to enjoy it again another day. A great buy, and a great reccomendation for anyone looking for a flavourful beer. Delicious to the end."
"I would probably drink Leffe Blonde again but only once a year."
"D- Not a bad beer. Definitely not on the high end of the offerings from Belgium, but not a bad choice. It is one of the only of the style available in Mississippi due to it's lower ABV. Will drink again, but not too many at the time due to the sweetness."
"Drinkability- Nice smooth and easy to knock back."
"Leffe Blonde pours 2 1/2 fingers of bone-white froth atop a light, golden body, outstanding, and the Ommegang glass is exquisitely laced on the way down. The nose is disappointing--a good deal of wheat comes forth but dominates. The taste is more complex than the smell indicates, thankfully. The wheat is still strong, but I also detect some orange and a faint honey taste, quite nice. I thought the carbonation might be overwhelming, but this wasn't the case. Having a couple of these is far from taxing. A nice pale ale, although the flavor is almost more reminiscent of a light German lager."
"As I think about it, something in this brew reminds me of makeup. Weird."
"D - If they cost the same, I'd drink this instead of Budweiser any day."
"Just an average beer overall. It has an all right look to it, a nice straw color with great head but almost no lacing. Not much of a scent, a little maltiness coming up from the brew. All right taste, some malts, but mostly bland. Goes down fine, not great and not bad. I doubt I'll try it again, but wouldn't dissuade any one from giving it a shot. Seemed more like a blonde ale than a pale ale, too."
"D: I am a big fan of the taste and find myself going back for more. The amount of carbonation keeps me from literally gulping it down like I am not suppose to do."
"D- a decent beer, it wouldn't be number one on my list, but I would most likely drink it again"
"Overall: quaffable, plenty pleasant enough to enjoy if somewhat blandly industrial. I'd have it again, gladly."
"D- an ok drink but after this 6 pack im prolly done with it, not a bad choice thou"
"D: Just a solid workman like belgian, in the line of a hoegarden or stella, servicable if a bit plain, but good enough to keep you interested."
"What an awesome beer! Can't believe it's taken me this long to discover such a treasure... almost like a super hefe-weizen, this beer pours a gorgeous bronze color with a nice, frothy head that has decent staying power... The aroma is wonderful - full of banana, fruits, and spices... The taste is super-rich... full of exciting and bold flavors that strongly complement the aroma... Has a superb mouthfeel that sticks to the palate and taste buds... flavor is long-lasting and very satisfying... a relatively strong alcohol percentage is the only thing holding me back from giving this a perfect five, but the 6.6% is really not felt so much, as the alcohol is hard to detect behind a creamy and rich taste... Definitely recommended... a must-try..."
"Poured into Chimay goblet, forms a thick, creamy white, long lasting head. Heavy lacing remains on side of glass. Sweet banana aroma. Taste is slightly spicy, mostly clove and banana. Perhaps a whiff of pepper. A decent beer, good for an intro to the style but there are better Belgian Pale Ales."
"Out of the bottle and into the glass, you will find a clear, light amber color. It is topped by a very tall white fluffy head. There is lots of sticky lacing and very good retention. The aroma is comprised of banana and cloves. The taste is made of sweet malt and some light hop bitterness. There is also some very slight graininess and some light spices. Not a bad beer."
"D: This is a pretty good BPA, good flavours, especially for something owned by a giant conglomerate. Could definitely drink this again, might buy six-pack next time. Good call."
"Not bad, but a bit too sweet and syrupy to have more than 1 or 2 in a session."
"D - This is a pretty good Belgian ale. I was quite light and reminded me of a German hefe."
"D: low abv and somewhat bland. kind of boring, but pleasant - I could probably drink this all night - but I would only want to if a better belgian wasn't available."
"Not my favorite, but certainly good enough to drink."
"Not bad; its crisp and clean and fairly tasty. Not my favorite Belgian Pale, but I Id try it again."
"Drinkability - this is a merely decent ale."
"Drinkability : Agréable, mais manque de caractère pour une abbaye ."
"after the last beer attacked my senses like a drunk zero pilot on kamikazee run, i figured i'd go to the opposite end of the spectrum ; pours a clear gold color w/ a finger of fluffy whiteness which lasts & left incredible lacing all the way down ; a nose that's tangy and wheaty, with a tinge of hop ; a sweet tangy flavor w/ a nice wheat-malt profile balanced w/ the hop bitterness, some caramel undertones detected ; a nice med body w/ plenty of dextrins to let the flavor linger ; this a a great beer, it was purchased in a 11.2 oz. bottle, but i think they should sell this stuff in ""40"" 's, i know i'd drink the shit out of 'em..."
"Pretty solid but unspectacular Belgian, and something just seems a bit off in it. But it's enjoyable and an easy drinker nonetheless, and it seems to be quite readily available."
"This was my first time drinking Leffe, it poured well, and had an exceptional taste, but as far as a Belgian blonde goes, it was not the best, I would rate it as a very drinkable but average blonde. All in all it was a beer I would definately drink again, and I would proudly drink, but it did not stick out in my mind."
"d: smooth and delicious with a distinct sweet fruity flavor; perhas a little on the sweet side but a great well balanced beer otherwise"
"drinkable, and certainly preferable to most local chinese macro pale lagers. but chimay and duvel are also available at the carrefour, so why bother with this?"
"poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle, pours a golden yellow with a big frothy white head that clings to the side of the glass. smells of sweet malts, fruits, bananas and a little spice. tastes of sweet malt, sweet fruits and just a touch of bitterness. mouthfeel is creamy with lively carbonation. this isnt a bad beer but i will most likley pass it up next time."
"Drinkability: An interesting and flavorful beer. The intensity of the flavor is memorable."
"I feel it is sweet, but I easily drank the 6 I had. Enjoyable, but probably not an every-weekend beer. worth a try."
"Leffe Blonde pours a golden yellow with an enormous white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is banana and clove, lots of clove (so much so if I didn't know better I would swear this is a hefeweizen). Clove hits me quickly up front in the taste, there is a touch of hops that is noticeable in the middle, but only just for a moment before the banana flavor kicks in."
"The mouthfeel is solid, not quite heavy, but nice thick and chewy. Drinkability is also good, I could like a few of these."
"D - Average I suppose, I will have to give this one another shot, I'd like to try it on tap. I wasn't too impressed, but it's not bad by any means."
"Poured from a chilled bottle into my favorite glass - a stemware type beer glass. Medium gold color with an awesome aroma. I wish they made this in cologne. The head stuck around for quite awhile but I had this as my evening snack so the whole drink went fast. Taste is of bananas and bread, all in all pretty good. Medium mouthfeel, high on the drinkability. I like it."
"The best before date on the bottle was 10/10/08. I enjoyed this beer and may buy another six pack but Trippel is still my favorite Belgian style. Cheers"
"Bottle, best before date 12-20-2007 Beautiful golden color, nice frothy head. Creamy texture, very, very, smooth. Carmel, honey bread dough. Very easy to drink. Wow, I found my new favorite everyday beer !!! Will be keeping a case of this on hand at all times."
"My first non-mainstream Belgian beer. The first time I tried this I loved it (my first impression was that of a wheat beer with a shot of sherry), but since trying better beers, I can see that there are some flaws, namely the over-sweetness and lack of complexity. Does not seem as good from the bottle as on-tap, but still a decent drink, and recommended for anyone who likes Belgians (and isn't adverse to sweetness)."
"Pours a pretty golden color with tiny columns of rising bubbles. Thick and foamy white head with fair retention. Patches of lacing on the glass. The aroma is on the hoppy side and has a nice spiced undertone as well. Medium-bodied and spicy with hops and yeast flavors. The flavor profile is not as complex as many Belgians but it is still pretty tasty. The finish is spicy and fruity and lingers a bit. Above average overall."
"Pours very clear, with a bright amber (gold highlights) color and minimal head, in spite of a constant upward stream of bubbles. The aromas are mostly sweet ones, with an overlay of spicyness and some pungent, doughy yeast elements. Not much depth to the aroma, though. On the palate, the sweetness is a bit overplayed and the yeast notes a bit cloying. What's pleasing are the spices, which build in the second half, and the hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thick for the style, and the carbonation is pretty intense -- too much so. Overall, this is an OK Belgian pale ale, but there's nothing to separate it from any pack."
"Exp 12-11-08. A sand-coloured head that settled quickly leaving a wispy centre and ring around the Leffe glass. Light to medium golden in colour. Slow, lazy carbonation. Aroma of hops and lavender, floral. Very full taste and mouthfeel, a bit sweet with hints of honey and apricot. Lots of body but with a tart sharpness. Very pleasing bitter peach finish but I found the alcohol comes through as it warmed even slightly, compromising the drinkability factor. A touch gassy also took away from what started out as a perfectly acceptable beer."
"Overall a very flavor-full and delicious beer. Its by far not the best belgian that ive had but its a solid brew to say the least and i enjoyed the bottle that i had. I hope to see it more readily available in southern Ontario (hopefully in something other than a gift pack...)"
"D: Medium. I'll never drink one again. But I could see someone having a lot of these."
"A nice drinking beer. It seems a bit stale, I can't keep from thinking about the maltiness. After this beer, I drank an Urquel and found similarities in sweetness."
"Had this at Winking Lizard. Bottle pours into the goblet a pale golden color with significant Weizen like white thick head. Smell is heavy on banana and clove. Can pick up some belgian spices, and yeasty like. Taste is delicious and creamy. Banana and clove flavors come to the front of my tongue. Carbonation is smooth. Not one of my favorite belgians, but it is quite good."
"Poured in a Leffe glass. Very good appearance, a clear vibrant gold, but not much of a head, otherwise this could have been a 5. The smell was leaning away from the cereal sort of smell I expected and gave a pretty distinct sweet smell. The taste was also pretty malty sweet, maybe fruity too, along with some of the Belgian yeast funk/earthiness. A nicely drinkable Belgian pale ale when you're not in the mood for some of the higher alcohol Belgians."
"Draught. Pours golden with with white creamy head that stayed around for a long time.. Has somewhat of a citrusy taste. Tastes a lot like a Hefeweizen. Aroma is citrusy and malty. Mouthfeel has good medium feel to it. Lacing on glass was pretty good. I wish I could find the Brune where I live."
"D - Awesomely drinkable, with a bit more flavor this would have been a 5. An excellent gateway beer into the world of Belgians."
"This is a good looking beer. A clear golden colour with a foamy white head, holds up well with some lacing. The nose has some spicy yeasty notes and there's a sweet scent that I just cant describe. Taste is lightly fruity, spicy and bitter. A good beer but there are a lot more BPA that I would rather drink."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but a little too sweet for my tastebuds - a good crossover for newbies into the world of Belgians"
"Overall an enjoyable and solid Belgian beer. Apparently rather commercial, but I'm not complaining. (Plus, it's harder to find than many most obscure Belgian beers.) If I could get it closer to home, at the good price I was able to find it for, I'd get it more often. If you enjoy Belgian beers, it's definitely one to try. If you are curious about trying some Belgian beer, this is certainly worth a shot."
"d- ok drinkability, but the flavors could be too much after a while. not really refreshing either."
"Pours a golden with quite a decent head but not a lot of lacing for a Belgian. Quite bready at first smell, followed by light banana and then clove. The taste is fairly mellow but exhibits similar notes as the smell. Some more noticeable clove on the finish along with a definite, but not out of place, sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and on the lighter side. Quite drinkable and refreshing. I brought a six pack of this camping recently. It was hot and humid and this stuff really hit the spot, went with a variety of foods, and was relatively easy on the wallet. I even converted one of my Stella Artois drinking friends with this beer. Not the most ravishing Belgian on the planet, but not bad and one I'd overlooked in the past."
""
"Drinkability: I could put a few of these down, but I have no real desire to after the first. Perhaps my rating will change after another, but I doubt it. I bought a six pack so it has a chance for redemption, but as of now I probably won't be buying again anytime soon."
"I actually might choose this over the Brune next time..."
"Mouthfeel is way too syrupy for a style that I expect to be crisp and dry. Not right in my book. Still, it tastes pretty good and the alcohol doesn't make itself felt so I suppose it's pretty drinkable. However, I could still think of a number of Belgians I'd go to first to scratch either my pale ale or tripel itch."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy, on the cloying side, and in general crispness lacks here. The taste is certainly good, with some mild bitterness balancing the fruity malt sweetness. There is a lack of complexity, however, as this scrubbed, clear version of a Belgian ale comes across as mass produced. The mouthfeel reduces it drinkability for me. I wouldn't choose it over a ""real"" Belgian but still it is a good beer."
"Poured a thick, mousse-like, cream colored head that held like a champ. Transparent golden beer just about matches the color of the can. Smells like it was made with Belgian yeast. A bit doughy with a touch of creamy/sugary desert. Carmalized sugar and apricot with a solid malt base and a bit of alcoholic bit to hold back the sweet flavors. The mouthfeel would be thicker if it weren't for the alcohol, which manages to lighten up the body and cut the sweeter flavors. Nice Belgian yeast flavors with a touch of alcohol. What more can you ask for?"
"I had this one on tap during a recent trip to Brussels. This brew is a clear and light golden-amber hued liquid. The head is of modest size, but stable and foamy. The smell is a nice mix of yeast, malt, and grass. It smells a bid sweeter than it tastes, with a notable caramel aroma. As you drink the brew, a hint of alcohol comes forth. The body is full and nice. A bit more yeast and light malt comes out in the taste. The carbonation is present, but a little more restrained than I expected. I enjoyed the beer with smoked salmon and asparagus. It was a nice accompaniment, and a worthy beer."
"Final Statement: So many people bash Leffe for being too commercial. Well, it's not Stella. Leffe is still a great beer for people who are not completely in love with Belgian Abbeys such as myself. The fact that it's filtered and cleaner makes me like it more to be honest. It still has a nice flavour to it, and I will still continue to buy it every so often."
"Poured into a Leffe goblet, a nice yellow heady beer. It really reminds me of a wheat ale. Same style of characteristics, dryish, but sweet. Nothing too exciting, but yet, nothing to really complain about. Alcohol is there, but not easily detected. A good Belgian session beer."
"After my initial happiness I found that the more I got through the glass, the more the thick mouthfeel and the complex flavours made me feel bloated. It was very nice, but one was enough, I do not have the urge to try it again. Great on its own, but not one for drinking whilst on a night out."
"Great Belgian ale that is not too hard to find. Has a decent aroma, and yellow in color. Has a very hefe-weisen yeast flavor (banana flavor), and is nice and malty. I can't quite pick out the hops, but they balance out the malts fairly well. This beer is probably a little higher in alcohol than is detected by the tongue, making it a nice drinkable beer with a kick. Very pleasant overall, definitely worth a try."
"Pours a nice golden,with lots of bubbles. Fluffy white head,with good retention,and lacing.Smell is of fruit,and clove with a spicy edge. Body is medium,and carbonated. Taste has a lot going on. Spice, sweet fruit, and tart citrus are all there. Good stuff from start to finish."
"Chewy, full mouthfeel. Slight dustiness, like the astringency of an old claret. Medium bitterness. And a slight cloying sweetness that would probably preclude this being a session beer.... need a lager to wash it down."
"Mouthfeel is good, nothing to take off for there, carbonation felt about right, etc. Drinkability is fine too, its not one of my favorite Belgians, but would do just fine on a hot summer day."
"Pours a crystal clear brass with active carbonation and a moderate sized, fluffy head. Smells of pale, toasty malts, a good heaping of grain, subdued spicy Belgian yeast, and a wort-like smell creeps in. Taste is very worty, with a bit of a bread taste and some esters in there somewhere. Finishes cloyingly sweet with, what do you know, a saccharine flavor (just like the last 4 or so beers I've had in the last couple of days). Boring, and just plain gross. Mouthfeel is too fulsome for me here and the carbonation does nothing to liven this up. I'm having a hard time completing this."
"for me, leffe blonde is the belgian beer i always go back to. a great 'comfort beer'. there are others i like better in certain ways or for certain times, but this is definitely the best i've had in this particular style."
"The mouthfeel is nice; light and velvety smooth with a clean refreshing finish. All and all a nice summer beer. Surely worth a try."
"This was really an afterthought purchase since I don't normally seek out Leffe, particularly the Blonde, for a variety of reasons. Still, I grabbed a sixer at my local and enjoyed the experience. Poured the 11.2 into my deep Duvel tulip glass. Wow, big head on this bad boy. A bleach white, bubbly foam with lace hanging on for dear life along the sides of the glass. Very clean appearance. Golden yellow with some carbonation. Aroma is loaded with bananas, both ripe and aged with notes of vanilla, coriander and camamille. The taste more or less reflects the nose. Bananas and vanilla rule the day with some citrusy wisps in the background. Only a whisper of alcohol in the finish accented by camamille. Moderate mouthfeel with continued light carbonation. It's a drinkable brew, but I can't imagine drinking more than one in one sitting."
"This is imported by CUB here so that means it's in a lot of bars that might otherwise only have ""premium"" choices like Stella Artois, therefore its my fallback beer so I can actually drink something that has some flavour."
"ABV well hidden"
"Very drinkable beer if you never had a belgian it is a nice example to work you into the genre. giver er a try"
"D: Definitely deserves buying the six pack. I'm going to enjoy another one right now!"
"D- this is quite tasty and very drinakable. I will purchase this one again."
"Pours a clear golden with one finger head that dies down quickly and leaves little lacing. Aroma is yeast, orange, banana, cloves and malts. Taste is strong yeast with bready malts and strong orange character. Lemons, spices, and honey. Mouthfeel is pretty average with a clean finish. Very mild and drinkable example of the style."
"Pours a nice brownish golden color with a decent white head that leaves some real nice lacing, I'm a bit impressed. The smell is distinctive Belgian, spicy-medicinal, and sweet. The taste is a watered down version of the smell, though it still taste good. It feels a bit pasturized, though I'm not sure it actually is. This is like the Budweiser of Belgian pale ales. A step above Stella. The feel is firm and not watery, maybe a tad too carbonated. A very drinkable Belgian blonde, one I won't have any issues with drinking a six'er of."
"It is what it is. Sure there might be better examples of the style. There might be cheaper examples, too. There might even be better examples that are also cheaper. But... um... I don't really know where I'm going with this. Just your average BPA, nothing more. Give it a try if you're a fan of the style. Otherwise, I'd pass."
"Chicago"
"poured a clear golden color with a three finger white head with a easy pour that held to a half inch with a spotty lace. first whiff is of banana aroma that turns to clove and spice. taste, all i could think of was easter ham studed with clove, clove and spice predominate the taste. medium mouthfeel with good carbonation, lots of bubbles coming up through the beer. maybe not the best but still tasty."
"It is a good beer, typical of its style, but not examplary of it. It is a very approachable belgian blonde; it is quite a delicious treat. However, in comparison to other beers of its style it, although very delicious, lacks the strength of taste and of alcohol, but not taste of alcohol, to make it great among its kind."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink. Solid, but not spectacular."
"The first to drink from a fresh keg, had 2 half pints on the first day 1 half pint on the second. Luckily, social occasions had given me an excuse to visit the local grad club for 4 days straight. The beer was served at around 8 degree Celcius in a Leffe glass. Thin head floated 1cm above the 33cl mark. The smell is good, like raw straw water with a hint of spritz. A very clean taste with marked floral notes from the belgian yeast. Slight raw sweetness. Very clean and drinkable. It washed down with conversation too easily. A very drinkable and sensible choice for the rainy spring days."
"Pours a nice golden color with a medium head that dissipates quickly with little lacing. Carbonation is noticeable, but doesn't seem to help. Aroma is interesting -- floral with something I can only explain as champagne that it's in your face. Has a fruity, floral start with that same champagne finish. It's almost like an alcohol sting but not quite. You can't miss this beer while you're in Belgium, and it's worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel was rich and filling. Medium carbonation."
"Cheers!"
"Good, very straightforward & refreshing. Better stuff out there, but would certainly drink again."
"Gave this one a try last evening, the brew poured to a deep golden color with a huge foamy white head that had great retention leaving a fair amount of chunky lacing along the side of the goblet. The aroma is fair, actually a little disappointing as I was expecting a little more but I did notice a dominant clove scent, bananas, sweet malts and a additional fruit like quality. The taste was good based on what I noticed in the nose, the clove flavor seemed to take a step back from the aroma as I notice the bananas and malt complexity taking a step up. Over all this beer is not as dynamic as I was hoping but it was a easy drink, one I would get one again but as far as Belgiums I think that there are many more impressive ones out there."
"D: Although I was hoping for much more, this beer still doesn't really make the mark. For some reason, I thought Leffe was gonna be top notch. If this is representitive of the brewery, they're far from the top of the pops."
"A great everyday beer with dinner, I think. A little too strong (and maybe too sweet at times) to be a session drinker per se, but I could see it fitting in nicely with a steak and some caramelized onions or something along those lines."
"This seems like the Belgian Ale for those who like hefeweizens. Banana and clove with little hop bitterness of phenols. Very easy to drink with the lower alcohol by volume (compared to other Belgian Ales). Recommended."
"Pours to a generous white head and lacing and deep golden color. Aroma is sweet, spicy, peppery and unmistakably Belgian. Flavor is sweet, malty and spicy. The way this feels in the mouth is superb--slight alcohol warmth/tingle and just the right amount of viscosity. A fine Belgian blond to sip all year round."
"Medium golden-amber with a large, white, fluffy head. Nice lacing. Smells of banana, clove, spices orange, light crisp hop and a light smooth malt base. Wheat has top billing in the flavor, supported by strawberry, grass, honey and spices, Perfumy but nice. It has a medium-light body, lightly dry texture and moderate carbonation. Stupid me thought it was actually the style of a blonde given the name. Not a fan of blondes and compared to that style I rather liked this one, though I thought it quite a bit off style. Coming here I find its a Belgian Pale Ale. Suddenly it all makes sense, and also Im suddenly less impressed with this beer. Its not bad by any means, but its nothing special in the world of Belgian Pale Ales. But I still enjoyed it."
"B'ham UK"
"A white ring and paper thin pool of carbonation sit atop a copper/amber colored brew. Aromas of pungent fruits like apples, pears, green bananas dominate while a softer herbal ester and citric astringent drift between whiffs. Big yeasty, bread taste, fermented pear, lightly roasted barley, wheat, and raw sugar sweetness that takes shape as it develops. A little ways down notes of unripe green banana, and fermented oranges, and vinous notes become more apparent. Thin body and moderate carbonation leaves a smooth and slightly slick mouthfeel that turns creamier as it warms. The finish has a yeasty profile with notes of dry grains, citric sweetness and slight sour, vinous astringent."
"D: Better than I expected. The flavor is such that it seems that it could pair well with many different types of foods. Recommended."
"A Belgian Ale that pours a great golden color color. A romantic white head. A somewhat higher than average carbonation..almost like delirium. Interesting combination of yeast and friut. Not a very strong alcoholic presence in the brew. I can see it popular as a affordable Belgian product for a large American novice consumer."
"I've had this one before. Can't imagine why I haven't held it in higher esteem. I love this beer!"
"This isn't an amazing belgian, but I think it's a nice example of Belgian characteristics. This amber beer is heavy on the yeast flavor with what seems to be a candi sugar sweetness. Not much bitterness, but this a very smooth and tasty beer. A good companion to a meal and worth trying."
"D: Not a bad Belgian Pale Ale but nothing spectacular. All in all an average beer that I'm not sure I will buy again."
"Lovely Blonde."
"Overall, the drinkability is good. I would have this beer again."
"Golden color with a nice fine bubbled head. Trails of lacing are left behind with each sip. Steady flow of carb gives it continuous life. First smells i pick up are citrus. This is followed by a honey sweetness. Taste is prominantly sweet up front. This is followed by some banana flavors. Finished with a distinct hoppy note. Also pick up some peppery spice flavors. A little bit on the dry side in the finish with some alcohol bite. Overall a nice Belgian beer. Nothing great or outstanding about it, just a solid drinker that you don't need to think to hard about."
"And this was a very fresh brew, thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam. I was brought this for the unique chance to enjoy fresh from the brewer."
"My first Belgian Pale Ale, came in a variety pack with Stella Artois and Hoegaarden from Sam's. Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a chalice. Massive head initially, with some large, soapy bubbles, that eventually dissipates. Swirling brings back a nice, thick, albeit thin, head with nice lacing. I couldn't discern very much from the smell, some sweet malt, yeast, alcohol. The taste at first had a strange metallic background but eventually wore off to a mild banana, spice, minimal hops taste with the metallica taste disappearing as the glass slowly empties. This is a very good beer for my taste. I will definitely be buying more of these once this 6 is gone!"
"D: Pretty high for the style."
"Overall, a good, if fairly non-descript, beer."
"This beer pours a crystal clear golden with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly, leaving a little bit of film. THe smell is sweet and yeasty but not too complex. The taste is also very straight forward and quite reminiscent of the smell. The mouthfeel is rather thin for a Belgian and fizzy. Overall, a drinkable Belgian Pale Ale but there are better ones out there."
"Most likely, I am not supposed to like beers from Inbev."
"A good starter Belgium beer. Would be a great beer on a hot summer day."
"Yet, this beer was very drinkable."
"Good drinkability by Belgian Ale standards. Not overpowering, but a very nice, clean ale."
"The pour is a clear gold with a rocky white head. Good head retention finally fades to an excellent lacing. The aroma is clean with notes of honey and slightly vanilla. The flavors are again highlighted with honey and vanilla. There is also a late grassy bitterness in the finish; which is a bit too dry for my taste. Drinkability and mouthfeel are both good; but nothing that really stood out for me. Overall, maybe not the best example that I've had, but a nice enjoyable brew for sure."
"D-Easy drinking. Nothing unpleasant but lacks character, especially for the style."
"I found myself buying another pack of this just to intoduce to my buddies because it is a good all around beer."
"Drinkability was outstanding. This beer was sweet and flavorful, yet quite well balanced. Furthermore, the alcohol was not at all detectable. One of the most sessionable Belgiums I have had to date."
"D- Absolutely. A very drinkable, flavorful beer."
"Leffe Blonde is a good Belgian pale Abbey ale that doesn't overwhelm you with complexity. It pours clear and golden with a medium head that reduces to thin white covering. The aroma is mostly clove and spice. It has a sweet malt flavor with some nutty/almond notes. The mouth feel is medium to light and nicely carbonated. The finish is neither sweet nor bitter, but leaves a slightly metallic taste in your mouth. This would be a good beer to drink during a meal and would probably go well with most pub fare."
"This is probably the easiest to drink Belgian Pale that I've had that doesn't skimp on flavor, dumb down for the masses, or deviate from the style. Thoroughly refreshing, and it doesn't cause palette fatigue (unlike Unibroue products...despite being awesome, I can only drink so many) Highly recommended."
"Slainte!"
"Drinkability? All day long. This is a refreshing, tasty, light beer I could drink all afternoon at the ball game. Glad I had two in the fridge so I could crack open a second and continue the refreshment. Got these from my brother-in-law who bought a 'taste of Belgium' 12-pack. It's the best of the three in the case, I think. One of my new favorite everyday beers."
"Golden color, with thick white head. Very nice aroma, yeasty and spicy. At first, it tastes rather sweet, but finishes a bit bitter and dry; very clean. Good strong yeast flavors, like a hefeweizen. Clove is prominent and some banana flavors also. There is also just a hint of alcohol flavor. This is a very good beer, but I don't think I could drink more than one in a sitting."
"It has to be one of the finest beers among those made in high volumes."
"D- An average pale ale i would say, sticky mouthfeel isnt pleasant but some nice notes in smell and taste. Ok offering but stick with duvel for a better widely available pale ale."
"Overall: A decent brew, but too commercial. It's also too sweet and syrupy and at times it's almost hard to drink."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer, and reasonable alcohol content allows for several samples. It may be chic to criticize macro brewed beers like Leffe, but it's a solid everyday beer and a great introduction to the beers of Belgium."
"The taste is of citrus, spices (cloves), followed up buy sugary sweetness, and some hops. A bit watery. The flavors don't pop out as much as you might expect from a Belgian. Still, it's quite drinkable. A decent Belgian pale."
"drinkability is good. nice and tasty."
"A golden brown color with a lot of head coming up but dissapating quickly. The smell is quite strong and very floral and sugary. The taste is very heavy, very chewy. It most certainly fills your mouth and seems like those suds on the side of your glass are the same ones on the side of your mouth once you are done drinking it. Obvioisly this is a high quality beer that has simply been over produced and is now just average. Good for one drink, then move on"
"Between the high carbonation and the spicy corriander the mouthfeel is not melow but the refreshing floral element leaves a good aftertaste. This is a great beer to go with seafood. Shrimp scampi, oysters. The sweet midpalate goes nice with anykind of butter sauce. It is also nice to be able to buy a six pack of Belgian beer!"
"Thanks to Rob McHugh for the constant prodding to try this!"
"Drinkability: a very drinkable Belgian pale ale , fruity , dry , and delicate as promised. The flavors are there , they are just a little thin in comparison to other beers of the style."
"The aroma was very faint, I caught hints of citrus and light malts but that was about it. The taste was moderatly sweet, with small hints of citrus, ocasionaly some bready flavors would cross my pallate, the finish was smooth and slightly dry with some hops to finish everything off. The mouthfeel was nicely ballanced . Overall I found it to be a decent flavord beer, though I feel that it lacks some of the complexity of an unfiltered bottle conditioned belgain pale ale."
"The mouth is well-carbonated and rather complex, but the flavors do not seem to mesh all that well. I have drank more than two of these in an evening, but only after being somewhat lubricated by other beers."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-n"
"This is definitely a drinkable beer and I recommend this to everyone."
"I've been to more than a few establishments where Leffe has been the only half-decent thing on tap, and for that I was thankful. Because while it's not quite good enough to make the shelves in my cellar, it's a more than acceptable fill for my glass if I'm out with friends at a less than craft-friendly restaurant, which, coincidentally, is the only place I ever drink it."
"I love this stuff. Its a nice and smooth, medium bodied, Belgian pale with a fairly sweet and creamy taste. It has one of my favorite appearances out of all the beers Ive had and it looks amazing in a glass. Weak in terms of other Belgians, but better then most everything else. Gotta love it."
"D: Not terrible, but not great for the style. If you want a sippin' blonde, there are more flavorful/complex blondes to choose from. This one's OK, but is a bit sweet and too fizzy."
"D- It was nice to try but this isn't my cup of tea. I'll stick with the Leffe Brown, sweeter, smoother and better balanced."
"Nonetheless, this remains a sturdy, medium-bodied brew with a spicy effervescence that quenches as well as any American summer brew. Recommended."
"D: It's a good overall beer, but there are better belgian pale ales, such as duvel."
"In spite of my love for (almost) all things Belgian, Leffe Blonde is a bit of a disappointment. Largely because it uses a clove hammer of a yeast strain when a finely honed yeast chisel would have worked better. It's a testament to my affection for the style that I still found something to like in this less than stellar version."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - Clean and smooth."
"Drinkability-- for me, it would be great in-session, whether in bottle or on-tap. I'm still trying to track down a keg from local suppliers, however, for future beer-events, here. I know that it's served on-tap in some pubs, at least one in Washington DC for instance."
"D - A nice, easy drinking fairly subdued Belgian pale. Nothing mind blowing but a good golden ale with that characteristic Belgian yeastiness that you can have a few of."
"D - Good. Not outstanding, but not offensive either. Easy drinker for a summer day."
"Poured to a pale golden color, with foamy white head that lasted the entire bottle, with high carbonation and excellent lacing. Aroma was very hoppy and spicy, mostly clove. Flavor was a continuation of the hops and clove, with some hint of other spices, and a trickle of malty sweetness. Aroma and flavor were consistent as the beer warmed, and the finsih was very good and smooth. I really enjoyed this blonde."
"This beer falls into the ""boy am I glad I bought this"" category. Being a bit of a purist ""Reinheitsgebot-ist"" when it comes to malt beverages, I am not a real fan of Belgian beers. So when I saw the display of Abbey de Leffe at the local store, I was attracted first to the amazing packaging. But the BA reviews were good, so I tried it. Absolutely loved it. Rich, clear golden color with massive, foamy head that lasted and lasted (and then laced the glass all the way down). The spicy clove/banana hops hits your nose immediately, but subtlely. And the taste is reminiscient of the best Belgian white beers, but filtered to a smooth, bubbly gold and not too sweet. Extremly drinkable and one of the few I've enjoyed right down to the last swallow. Exceptional. I think I'll have another."
"D - An average beer."
"A tasty, if one dimensional, Belgian blonde. Sweeter than most. Well carbonated, pours bright golden with an effervescent white head. Aroma of candy, clove, bubblegum. Flavor is sweet, estery, lacking a real malt backbone but pleasant enough. Not my favorite but good for drinking if other Belgians aren't available."
"Because of how sweet this is, I couldn't help but compare it to white wine. It's not the best beer, but I'd still take it over a white wine any day."
"I poured this from a 12 oz. bottle. It has a very golden color with good head and head retention. The smell is slightly hoppy. The taste is hoppy with a bit of a sour note. Mouthfeel is bit chewy and the carbonation is quite noticeable. I'd consider this a very drinkable beer"
"D- The dry light fruit flavors are crisp with a faint sweetness to give the balance. Then they are rudely squashed by bitter hops. The hops would be fine if they had some depth of flavor or other characteristic besides just bitterness."
"Upon tasting you are just hit with all this malt; some wheat breadiness and sweetness, and this is then ridden out on a wave of alcohol just under the surface. This is a big filling beer whether it looks that way or not. I think that pairing it with Stella Artois and Hoegarden in an 18 pack does give exposure to the non-illuminati of beer; however, this is a beer to drink in its chalice or a tulip, not right out of the bottle at a picnic; the difference is night and day."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It is a little milder than what I was expecting, but this isn't bad. There is still plenty of flavor here to keep your palate guessing. We don't have access to too many Blond ales here in Texas, but this is definitely a good beer and one that I would like to drink again."
"Pretty drinkable, especially if price is a factor. A 6-pack of these go for about $8, whereas a 4-pack of Duvel goes for about $9. I've read what people have to say, and I do agree that it is a very commercial Belgian Pale, but when you factor in price, it's a pretty agreeable ale."
"What's not to like here? I've read some comments about Leffe being nothing more than swill, and I wonder if people are bringing the politics of its current ownership/distribution into the judgment of the beer itself...or maybe its popularity and accessibility turns people off for some reason? This is simply a great beer, nearly quintessential when it comes to defining the Belgian pale ale style."
"Note: bottled version a bit more restrained in character."
"Poured a sweet nutty brown with a great foamy head which lasted forever (seemed like it anyway). Smells of citrus and a hint of bannana. Taste definitely proved my nose correct with the bannana and fruityness. Almost had a Hefe feel and taste to it. Maybe that's why I liked it so much. I couldn't get enough of this. I am so glad I had a full liter of it. Oh wait, and I have another. Thank God for mistakes!"
"Drinkability: Easy drinking"
"Poured from a bottled into a belgian style tulip glass. Nice head formation torward the top of the glass. Citrus and Coriander on the nose. Formed tiny (champagne like) bubbles that lasted until I was done with this 11.2 oz bottle (not long). Nice lace. Smooth and well balanced. Wonderful golden color. Easy to drink. Perfect summertime beer."
"Pours a really nice gold color with a huge white head that leaves nice lacing. It has a nice raisin and bubblegumesque scent, which is quite pleasant. Taste is very different, it has a bubblegum type of flavor that isnt too overwhelming or overpowering, accompanied by a nice sweet malt flavor. Very different than anything Ive ever had and is quite pleasant to drink, wouldnt be too hard to kill a 6er quite quickly."
"Drinkability: The sweetness may make this a tad difficult for repeat consumption in a given day, but overall, an easy going, inoffensive brew."
"Drinkability for me suffers from being a little too sweet for my tastes, but this one has nothing objectionable about it, it's widely available, and the bitter finish does help a bit. Solid, but I drank it slow and didn't care to order another."
"Since I do not have any type of belgian glass ware, I used an over sized winr glass. The color is deep golden, with a slight white head forming. The aroma starts off with some scents of yeast, then followed by strong a citrus fragrance. The taste is very sweet, but mostly citrus fruit flavors, with a spicy ending. The feel of this beer is very lite at first and seems to get heavier as it crosses the palate. This an okay beer, the sweetness would turn off some, but it lacks that punch that belgian beers usually have in taste."
"d: I'd say that Leffe blonde has a pretty good drinkability. I could only really put away one of these in a sitting, as it takes a while to drink it because of the intial biting taste of the beer. The aftertaste is worth it, though."
"The mild hops prevent the residual sugar from cloying, and results in a soft, inviting finish."
"Cheers!"
"I most likely wont buy this again. It might work for an introduction to Belgians for those who arent used to strong beerthats it."
"For a little bit more $, I would rather buy Affligem Blonde, but this is worth a try."
"Exhibits soft round flavors, great mouthfeel thick and creamy. Flowers, spice, belgian yeast, lemon, orange, banana, wheat, malt, with very little hops, and no noticeable alcohol. Delicious!!"
"D - Not too bad. Compares favorably to the macro lagers and ales, but I would expect more from the style."
"Poured a petrified sap orange with a nice white head. Smell is yeasty with a little honey and lilac. This filtered blonde tastes very clean, if not a bit too thick. Strong tastes of toasted honey throughout, with some mild carbonation at the end to give a tiny bite. Can be a bit too sweet at times, so I think this would be a one and done brew. Perfect for a hot summer day when you want something a little thicker."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Fantastically prickly... just short of being overdone, it really moves in the mouth and helps lift the oils from the salmon off the tongue. Cleansing and rejuvinating, it withers towards the end of the sampling. A great food beer, I can't wait to try it as it is meant to be truly enjoyed."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is just ok on this offering. Carbonation concentrates on the tongue as the beer slicks down the throat. Drinkability is also just alright. Not as heavy as I thought or would have liked, but nonetheless a good change of pace and woth a try."
"Quite an unique flavor to it, strong in yeast, as well as a honey/molasses like flavor. Pours a rich golden color, and a fair amount of carbination. Overall, a well rounded brew with quite a lot to offer. Perhaps not quite as complex as I normally like, but the powerful flavor makes up for it."
"I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this one, after reading Leffe is a commercial beer. I found this one to be very smooth, floral and refreshing. Great drinkability and nice belgian yeast strain. The head and lacing kept up with Duvel, IMO. Decent smell and sweet, smooth taste. Also, a slight hop, kickback on the swill! I recommend this one and it is very reasonably priced."
"Poured a golden color with a small white head that stuck to the sides of the glass. Smell was pleasent with light fruit and something a little peppery, also somewhat musty. Taste was interesting, prickly and fruity with some clove and orange coriander tastes as well, almost witbierish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and very easy on the palate. Certainly seems like a beer that I could have many of in one sitting. Not bad, I liked it. Maybe not earth shattering, but worth trying. I would let this one warm a bit, a few more complexities pulled through towards the end of my glass."
"Golden in appearance with a white head. Good carbonation. Smells of bannana and spices. A wonderfully rich taste with a strong finish. Good lacing throughout. Incredibly drinkable. I'm finding that the Belgian strong/ double ales are my favorite. I have yet to have a bad double and am probably biased when it gomes to rating this type of beer."
"Nice white head with funky (good) smell. Somewhere between peach and yellow. Taste follows after that funk. Funky enough to satisfy. Not so funky that people not familiar with more exotic lambics, etc. wouldn't enjoy it."
"Light to moderately carbonated, Leffe Blonde is a very drinkable Belgian abbey ale. I do prefer the slightly less potent and more flavorful Leffe bruin though, that I have yet to find in Massachusetts."
"A while ago, I remember comparing this with the brown. The brown was more complex and delicious, but it is not as easily attained (around here anyway). So, I do recommend this ale."
"Leffe, available in 6-packs for $10, is a deal. Here's a fabulously frothy (bigger bubbles) Belgian (ex-original Abby), with the qualities that I'm beginning to think are common for a Belgian Double or a French Farmhouse Ale. The appearance and smell are delightful. Smells of fruit and spring, like Saison Dupont, but the taste is heavier, more malty and less crisp than the smell would suggest. It's not a hugely complex taste that many Belgian's have, but in a blind taste test you could easily be fooled into thinking this was a much more expensive pour. It drinks real easily at just 6.6%ABV, however, so that 6 pack may not last too long."
"D - Really good! I didn't expect much from this beer because I had seen in in the ""Best of Belgium"" beer pack, which contains Stella Artois. Naturally I was skeptical of any beer that would be cited as ""the Best"" alongside of Stella. Leffe Blonde is quite good though. It has a complex and interesting flavor. It is no trappist and it is no Duvel, but it is pretty good. I didn't expect much, and it surprised me. To say this is the ""Best of Belgium"" is nothing compared to the insult of Stella."
"I think this is a good beer especially for some of the warmer months coming on. Grab a cold one and enjoy in the hammock."
"Forget who distributes this, it's good--drinkable and smooth, yet hearty enough for its flavor to hold its own while I paired it with buffalo chicken strips."
"creamy mouthfeel, well carbonated"
"I didn;t purchase this myself but I put no label on the cap. Likely provided by trbeer. Stupid me for my lack of documentation. Whoever, thanks for the opportunity. Pours a two finger white head with a light yellow dusting. almost crystal clear with a couple of particulates. Smells clovey phenolic edgy with some fruity esters and malay sweet that rises on an aromatic. Tastes clove edgy with banana esters. Bread crust. Green apple finish with a rough edgy belgian yeast character. Homey and lightly colored belgian candy sugar. Wet sweet carries thoughout, but seems lacking in some complexity. Dry finish and a bit more sharply carbonated that I would have expected. A malt wet sweet with a yeast funk edge. Md body that rolls into the mouth light. Carb is a bit sharper than I'd like and (IMO) doesn't mix with the clove funk in a positive way."
"The flavor is a nice balance of sweet malt and bitter fruits, with an interesting smokey element."
"The flavor was a little bit of a letdown. It begins a bit watery then hits you with sugar and a bit of citrus followed by a slight alcohol presence. The overall sugary feel to it doesnt do it for me."
"Smells a bit musty, sharp but light hops, floral, maybe a bit of bubblegum. Bubblegum is a bit more noticeable with the taste. A bit sticky with syrupy sweetness, bitter aftertaste. Not much hop in the taste. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and fizzy, but overall ok. Admittedly I'm drinking this a bit warmer than normal."
"Sweet, thin watery gunk. Typically Leffe yeasts and sugars are more pronounced than the barley or hops. Bleigh! Macro sugar water with a nice carbonation stream. Clear gold body with a fluffy, light head. Smells slightly medicinal and almost fruity but leaves me wanting more in all categories."
"This clear, light golden ale smells initially of earth and grass, with mild fruit entering the nose as well. The flavor profile is of gentle, rounded malt with a slight mineral twang. Mild notes of sweetness and bitterness play on the medium finish. Sure, it doesn't offer too much, but it doesn't ask too much either."
"I won't rule out buying this on tap againa, but I sure don't plan on buying it in the bottle again anytime soon."
"i'd have to say its okay, nothing spectacular. it isn't something i would go out of my way to get again. the further down i got in this the less and less i enjoyed it. to the point where i was disappointed i still have the rest of the six pack to go."
"Overall - An OK beer.... Worth a try..."
"Leffe Blonde pours into my Leffe chalice glass a deep blonde color, with large white head of large bubbles. Left the appropriate and expected lacing. The smell is quite yeasty and I got a bit of a soap smell as well. The aroma could have more spices or something, but it was pretty much just sour yeast. It is much the same on the taste. Lots of yeast flavors, with not alot of anything else coming through. Dry aftertaste, with a bit of hoppy finish. Lots of carbonation, so leaves a crisp tingle on the tongue. Above average, but lots of better Belgians out there."
"I agree with the other reviews that they should not clean this up so much....but it's still a very good Belgian Blonde."
"Pours a clear medium yellow with a one finger yellow tinged head that is fairly thick and reasonably well retained, but not the sort of billowing lasts-forever cloud of foam that I always hope for when having a beer of this style. Smells of sharp spices like pepper and cloves, with fruity notes, sweetness, and an alcoholic tone as well. Tastes mostly of malts and snd spiced fruits, with hops and an alcohol bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is reasonably thick, but a bit too clean. Drinkablilty is solid, but not particularly impressive. This isn't a bad beer, but I feel like they've sterilized it too much, and it just doesn't cut it for me."
"Poured this blond into a 0.4 liter short-stemed beer chalice. Creamy off-white head that has lots of lacing and sticks to the side of the glass like a champ. Excellent bubble column rising up throught the center of the glass. Color is burnt golden. The smell is mesquite honey and cloves with a slight hint of eucalyptus. A great aromatherapy beer. Taste is sweet fading to nutmeg and finishing with pure honey. Great texture attributed to micro carbonation. Great starter beer or reverse-spacer beer in a session. This blondie drops the laundry, I'm impressed."
" This wouldn't be a terrible brew for a night out but it doesn't have any matching potential for food, in my opinion, and there wasn't much about it that stood out. It's certainly old-fashioned, and for more modern tastes like mine, this was worth a try and not much else..."
"Body is just barely medium, very slick and crisp, with a soft texture and light, pinpoint carbonation. Should rate higher IMO."
"I feel like it should be better than it is. I might revisit it, but this time it ended up drinking like a very bland beer."
"Poured a dark orange with a nice puffy head. Smell is of caramel, and burnt sugar. Taste is quite nice, essence of caramel, pears and prunes make their way down the palate. Mouthfeel is delicate, very smooth, carbonation is very minimal which makes this ever so easy to drink. Nice drink to relax with at night after a big meal."
"This beer looked totally normal at first, golden color had little head to it, and smelled kinda sweet. To my surprise when I drank it, this is the worst beer I have ever had period, maybe it is just me I don´t like sweet beer but this was terrible I did not take a mouthful or drink more than first touched my tounge on first sip. NOT for those who don´t like sweet beer. BAD BAD BAD"
"Nice light fluffy head appears with the pour. Very clear. Sweet smell emanates from the glass- sort pear like. I think this is a nice tasting beer, well balanced with fuit and a candy-like presence. It's extremely easy to drink. It's not a rich beer by any means, but stands up to spicey food or can be had nicely on it's own."
"D - Great drinkability. I enjoyed this immensely and look forward to more."
"Not too terrible considering the giant conglomerate that brews it, but far from the best Belgian abbey-style ale."
"This is a good beer. Nothing more, nothing less... if the price was right (and if I could get it locally) I would buy more. As it sits now there are better beers similar to this I can get. So be it. I am very happy I tried my first Leffe beer. It wasn't shit in a bottle. Sure it is clean... it is an industrialized Belgian beer. Maybe it was great once, now it is decent. Thank you Red Haze, this was a pleasant and drinkable beer."
"Drinkability/Overall: Easy enough to drink and a beautiful brew. Borderline my favourite from Leffe. A great fruit, dark tasting contrast with a refreshing crisp pale ale. Well balanced."
"This clear orange golden ale is sweet! Scents of sweet fruit, oranges and peaches with just a hint of herbal hops in the background lead into a sweet malty flavor. Honeyed fruit with a full mouth feel make this drink a pleasure to drink. Probably not the best Abbey Ale out there but better then most I've tried."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I would gladly serve this to folks that have not had the pleasure of Belgian beer. I think I could call this a gateway Belgian for the uninitiated."
"Overall: The hops were too dry and harsh (different from strong) and overall this drink lacked in balance."
"Tried this on tap, poured a clear gold with a decent white head. The smell is fruity with a bit of bitterness. The taste is a pretty strong sweet, fruity taste which is balanced out with a good amount of bitterness. This is a pretty strong tasting brew, with the sweetness overpowering the hops a good bit. Overall this was a good beer and I enjoyed it."
"A relatively clear, golden-yellow colored beer with loads of foam that seems to sit stationary for some time leaving behind some nice lacing. Aromas of grains, yeast, and apricots seem to dominate. The taste is typical of this style with a fair amount of bitterness that is complemented by sweet fruity flavors. My biggest problem with this brew is it's unusual aftertaste that just lingers on and on. The aftertaste is a bit like swallowing a slightly stale loaf of bread; just not very appealing. The drinkability takes a hit because of this as well. I would rather follow this beer with a glass of water than to have another one."
"Leffe is quite a good introduction to the belgian style, I think. A very sweet brew, but as ones tastes become a bit more refined, the beer becomes altogether unnecessary. It is very syrupy, almost tastes like robitussin. Not that it is all bad - i myself love tussin. Anyway, an adequate beer, but certainly not something I would go out and purchase. Very fruity and way too thick for the style. I would like something a bit more summery (not that that is really a word with any meaning, but anyway). In any case, I guess it was a nice surprise a bar, so that I didnt have to order a guiness, but there are definitely better things out there for the price."
"From a 33 cl bottle dated best before 19-9-06. Leffe Blonde delivers a light, crisp aroma with a hint of spice from a bright golden body. The flavor is equally crisp and slightly tart with a light touch of pepper and a hint of cinnamon. This is a fairly standard Belgian pale, but its a high standard. Its authenticity as an abbey ale however, is stifled by its contracted Interbrew origins."
"12oz bottle. Pours a perfect copper color and makes a thin white head, leaves a nice bit of lacing on my glass. Strong bread yeasty aroma. Peppery spices, clove and sweet banana are dominant in the flavor, however there's a bit of metallic in the background that is not so pleasant and perhaps a bit plastic. Nice medium palate that finishes dry with crisp bubbly carbonation. Halfway through this and the metallic flavor has seemingly diminished quite a bit, though the plastic remains. While this brew has a couple of strong points, the weak points are dominating here, I don't think I'll be drinking this one again for a while. One thing I noticed here is that this brew isn't bottle conditioned, which seems to be pretty standard for the style. Perhaps Leffe's commercial nature will inspire some macro drinkers to crossover into the craftbrew world, but I can't say that I recommend this. A decent gateway beer at best."
"The mouthfeel was slightly harsh though not oppressive. Decent amount of carbonation. Overall, I found this to be quite acceptable and I would have again, thought I prefer the Leffe brune and the radieuse. The blonde is more like a little brother."
"bright golden hue. good head that lasts.moderately full bodied. mild bitterness. aromas show sweet pale malt accents. rich and chewy on the palate showing good malt intensity and sweetness that is balanced and a dry hop finish. shows a very drinkable character. impressively flavorful."
"D: an average Belgian blond--nothing more nothing less."
"Not the best Belgian out there, but a decent value for the price. A good gateway Belgian perhaps?"
"Sacrifices some flavor for drinkability, hence no 4's other than appearance. This would, however, be a good pick to ""ease"" someone into the style."
"The clerk at my local gourmet beer store warned me that this brew was ""very spicy."" In fact, TOO spicy for him. But for a girly-girl like me, I thought it was perfect. I had one, and then two- and was good and spiced up for the night. I haven't had much of this particular style, but I thought this beer was a good one of it's kind. Get in touch with your feminine (spicy) side, and enjoy!"
"This beer is full bodied and seems to me to have more carbonation than most beers, but I think that this feature compliments the taste of this beer. As to the drinkability of this beer, I find nothing special about it, except for its unique taste, but I am sure that there are many beers out there that represent this style much better."
"Pours a clear golden amber, big fluffy white head, some lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet malt, spices, some hops, coriander and orange peel. Taste is really sweet, some spice, coriander and orange and a little bit of yeast. Pretty smooth, mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Not bad, better than the brune but the sweetness is pretty cloying."
"Overall, a very decent brew."
"Leffe is has a quintessential golden color with high carbonation and an usually long lasting head. It's head is quite unusual and makes this beer worth trying by itself. Rich long lasting taste but without a bad aftertaste. A little bit of aroma, very drinkable and always a terrific beer to rediscover."
"poured a medium amber color with massive white chunky head. Smell is herbal, spicy. Very nice. Taste is spicy, banana-like and initially enjoyable, but also very subtle. Almost as if it has been watered-down. Finish is light and nice, but not quite what I was looking for. Almost too easy to drink. I would describe this as a macro Belgian Pale Ale. It seems as if Inbev has turned this beer into the the Bub Light of Belgian Pale Ales.What will be next? Maybe they will buy an Abbey."
"1/10/09"
"The sweetness level and a lack of complexity hamper drinkability. Needs about half the sugar and extra spice flavors."
"Notes: just average"
"Drinkable, but not something i'll return to. Seems plentiful in Pensacola, though..."
"Drinkability: This is an very good tasting beer - I could sip my way through a few of these."
"D - The improved smell, taste and mouthfeel of the tap version of this beer naturally improves its drinkability as well. A marked difference from the bottle."
"Overall, Leffe Blonde was too slickly sweet to be a really enjoyable brew. Maybe more of a throwback to what earlier Belgian pale ales were like but it can't compete with today's spicier offerings."
"It had been over three years since I last had this beer and I didn't have fond memories. How things have changed (including my luck I'm guessing). Pours medium to light amber, not much fogginess, with a semi-dense thick white head that faded slowly and laced well. The nose was rather unremarkable with some acidity and citrus and something I can only describe as 'warm' coming through. Starts off with a bit of spice and chewiness on the tongue. Makes way for spice with bread, good carbonation feel. Leaves a distinct, but light enough, hoppiness on the finish. Feels good, drinks well. Either I've changed a lot or I got a better set of bottles."
"Notes: For the price ($1.80), not bad. But I can find excellent examples of Belgian ales easily, so why try this twice?"
"Came to me as a copper hued beer atop which rested a one finger head. No carbonation was seen, but pleasant rings of lacing were left as the beer went down. Aroma of light malt. Taste was light with a bubble gum quality to it. Light malt shows through in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel was tingly. While this isn't the best Belgian beer in the world, it was perfect for the summery day I sampled it on. I'd drink it again."
"Good price for an excellent Belgian. it may not be my favorite in this style, but it is a style I love, so I'll keep coming back."
"This isn't my typical type of beer, but it's really interesting. I wouldn't want to drink this everynight, or in a session, but it's a pretty good beer."
"It's a decent beer, but not something I could see drinking all the time as it could become cloying real quick."
"Overall-this Belgian is really filtered, which is a shame because it seems like beneath this filtering there is a monster waiting to come out, a shame it's full potential wasn't reached."
"whopping head with massive fizzy big carbonation and a perfectly clear view right through the body. Thats where I have a problem is the ultra clear super filtered appearance and it truly translated into a beer without character. candy like smell and the usual belgian yeast coming through. I had many beers this day and this was the worst of the bunch...I had this beer second before the next three which were all grand cru's so this is not a victim of circumstance. Not one of my favorite belgian pale ale's to put it nicely and I would recommend you skip this pup."
"I've had a lot of enjoyment with this beer and I'd definitely recommend it, especially for fans of belgian ales."
"At 6.6% ABV, this will hurt you. But, it is so smooth and drinkable, I bet you can't drink just one!"
"Offered to friends who requested Bud Light. Some returned to me to finish myself and some drank it out of politeness. However, none of them had any complaints about the keg of Milwaukee's Best."
"Picked up a six pack from Trader Joe's in the DC area. Poured into a pint glass. Color was a nice amber and clear. First thing I noticed was a very intense spiciness, but not too overpowering and somewhat inviting. Spicy taste throughout and had almost a dry feel in the mouth. Very palatable and a good brew for the summer. Enjoyed this beer and would purchase again, particularly during the summer as a nice thirst quencher."
"A solid beer that melds very nicely with food, especially salty foods like yakitori."
"The real selling point for me though is the taste. It's a little on the sweet side without being cloying. Like the color, the taste is a bit honey-ish, with a quality aftertaste, and it goes down easy.. perhaps too easy, as it would be entirely too easy to drink a few too many of these. Overall a very palatable beer that I would pay to drink again, and one of the better Belgian blondes I've tried."
"I have been enjoying Leffe Blonde for awhile. I first discovered it while pub hopping in London last year. It was different from the other great English draft ales that I had been drinking. Back in the USA, I noticed that it was available at Taco Mac in Atlanta. Fortunately I had to return to Europe on business this spring and got to drink Leffe Blonde at Heathrow Airport, Amsterdam, and best of all in Brugges (Belgium). There is an Irish pub next to the Crown Plaza there that had Leffe Blonde on tap and it was truly excellent. My associates and I sampled many different trappist ales while in Belgium, but Leffe Blonde was available in most bars and we loved it! Some people are voicing negative opinions about this beer because it is now being distributed internationally by a large cartel. If that enables me to enjoy it more often in Atlanta, then I can't view that as a bad thing. Try Leffe Brun-its even better!"
"Impression: A delicate, yet bold beer. Nicely complex in its flavors and power. It'll sneak up on you. I do recommend this beer. I always have at least one in my fridge; even better on tap."
"Purchased at LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. Pours a copper hue with a full yellowish head. Carbonation is low and nose produces yeasty and sugary sweet. Flavor is slight fruity but big honey like. Body is full and syrupy and comes in after the tide of honey. Aftertaste is long."
"Overall a tasty beer, just seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. I'd call it a hefe weizen made with a belgian type yeast."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a decent Belgian beer, but honestly doesn't hold a candle compared to what else is coming out of Belgium. A bit too expensive for what's inside the bottle in mu opinion."
"Bottle, served at a restaurant in refrigerated and completely inappropriate glassware. As it was my first Belgian Pale Ale of the non-heavy variety I wasnt sure what to expect. Poured sparkling clear golden colour with two fingers of bubbly head that lasted well and left heaps of lacing. When I smelt it, I thought there had been some sort of labelling error, as it smelt just like a German kristallweizen - all bananas and cloves. Same with the taste. What the...? Only difference was the mouth feel was a little heavier than the average kristall. Will definitely come back and re-rate this after more experience with the style."
"The beer of choice on my recent carribean vacation as it was readily available in cases at the local grocery store . this is a nice beer, at 6.6% abv, it is very drinkable, with a nice full flavor, but not to big or complex, for sitting around the pool.i will probably have at least 3 cases of this stuff while on vacation, 10 days in the carribean sun will make you thirsty, so i sould know this beer back and fourth by the time i get home. All in all a good beer, nice flavors, sweetness up front, slightly malty, with a nice tang. definetly a good choice for a nice session."
"Pleasing golden color, not quite consistent with blonde nomenclature. Large, full head with good staying power. The smell was a pleasing combo of yeast with some fruitiness. Very good taste with almost no bitterness. It hides the high ABV nicely. The mouthfeel is rich, almost syrupy, but the ample carbonation keeps things from sticking to the palate for too long. Quite drinkable but perhaps a little too sweet and heavy for a marathon drinking session."
"Certainly a fine belgian, but lacking some of the depth I've come to expect from other interpretations of the style. 330 mL brown bottle, best before date on rear label."
"Pours a translucent gold color with a tremendous head that dissipates quickly. The smell and taste are about as traditional as you can get for a blonde. There is not much variation between this and the bigger brands like Hoegaarden, the citrus and light hops taste is verbatim. Great for anyone who is just getting into whites."
"Overall: Not bad, but nothing I'd seek out."
"Bought it in a six pack. I like this beer!"
"Drinkability & Notes: Tingly mouthfeel that was as drinkable as a carbonated drink, finishes more sweet than I think it really should."
"One was enough for me, especially at this place where there are over sixty beers on tap to try next."
"Leffe Blond has a well-balanced malt flavouring worthy of any beer drinker. The aroma brings me back to something in my childhood, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Cheers."
"Wasnt very carbonated, so it had a good mouthfeel. However because of the sweetness too forever to drink."
"This beer has crossover potential, I will say that. I'd probably head straight for the Witbiers if I'm looking for something with a similar flavor, however."
"With a prominent, yet lite malt aroma, some phenols present, low hop aroma, poured out golden, nice head retention, moderate carbonation, sweet malt flavor with hint of spice, maybe honey also, slight fruit breaks thru when it warms up alittle, with medium body smooth quality, overall impression copper color, some malt sweetness, slight spicy and some fruit accent. A drinkable beer to say the least, nice to have when relaxing, warming up to do some beer reviews."
"About two summers ago I went to a show at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ and there was a ""Premium/Imported"" Beer vendor there. His laughable choices included Rolling Rock, Heineken, Corona, and this beer. It struck me as somewhat odd that this beer was included with the others. This is far superior to those listed, but as a Belgian ale it was more watery and not as bold as I anticipated. I guess this is a good beer to acquaint myself with the wide world of Belgians but those with more experienced palettes will probably want to pass."
"Poured a golden-orange color, with a slight haze. Aroma was spicy and sweet at the same time. Now for the taste... very smooth, with a good mouthfeel. The tiny bubbles of carbonation dance nicely on my tongue. Sweet malt flavor with a hint of honey... perhaps a bit too sweet... and some spiciness and very slight sour yeast flavor to help to balance all that sweetness. Another few sips and a little fruit comes through... mild fruits like pears and apples, maybe raisins. The overly sweet character begins to fade as I drink more... becomes a more drinkable, enjoyable offering as I continue..."
"Pours a clear golden/light amber color with a white head. Aromas of light malts and a bit of tobacco and some other weak esters. Taste is about as weak as the aroma. A healthy malty sweetness and a bit of spicy astringency towards the end, but nothing to rave about. It's drinkable, but there are certainly better Belgian blonde ales to be had. I'll bet this beer was wonderful some ages in the past. Now it seems like a very typical, mass-marketed product and it shows in it's quality. It's not a bad beer, it just could be done better."
"Pours a dark clear golden with a thick white head that laces very well, pretty much coating the glass and has a variable appearance which I like. Aroma was a touch of alcohol with a strong smell that is almost the spiciness of root beer. Taste is light fruits and hops, with less alcohol than expected from the smell. Mouthfeel was very smooth with a snap of crispness from the hops. I like the Blond, but I prefer the Brun."
"This one took me by surprize. An outstanding and enjoyable beer. I would think a great one to introduce Belgian styles."
"The pour reveals a deep gold beer with a copious ivory head that recedes quickly. It leaves lots of lace behind. The aroma is of perfumey Belgian malts and sugars, quite sweet really. There a subtle spicyness in the nose as well. The taste is flawed. It starts of quite well with a passable malt presence and good spiceyness. Then a metallic saccarine sweetness emerges. The mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer is ruined by the sweetness. It leaves a chemically aftertaste thats not pleasant at all. Ive experienced this with other bottles as well. This is definitely a beer Im staying away from."
"A great beer, and one of my favourite Belgian styles."
"My first experience with an Abbey beer; overall quite positive. I would pick up the odd bottle of this; I'm now inclined to try the brune."
"A nice well-balanced beer!"
"Leffe Blond when poured into a glass was a deep golden color with a foamy head, but not much lace. When tasting, the flavor had a mild fruity sweetness, but also tart as to balance this Belgium Ale. As the bottle said, ""Leffe BLonde is a full-bodied deep golden beer that is surprisingly subtle and delicate""."
"Skein of clinging head to start. Crystal clear pale gold hue with a lazy action throughout. Pungent pear and cidery initial aroma followed by a sticky, sinewy cream-like herbal presence of cloves and cinnamon, though clearly understated. Cloves are the first thing on the tongue, with some tangy white pepper bite and some hot dashi. Oddly alluring velvetiness to mouth, and eminently consumable."
"lacks some personality."
"A very nice brew."
"Overall, fruity and spicy...maybe a little too sugary. Tasty and very drinkable at 6.6 % ABV."
"The beer poured a pale hazy golden color with one finger of head. The nose is full on orange, almost like a belgian wheat beer, not a blonde. The taste is much of the same, with a bit of creamyness thrown in with the orange. The feel is rather thick and creamy. The drinkability is good. this is a nice sweet, smooth beer."
"Pale gold with a big fluffy head this was one of my first Belgian beers way back and I must say that it suffers in comparison to the beers I have tasted since then. There is a sweetness that is followed by a coarseness that shows a lack of real craft. It is not bad but doesn't really stand up as a good example of the style."
"Low on dough and jonesing for a Belgian, this is not a bad choice. ""Not the best, but still a good buy"" as they say."
"Great starter beer for the non-beer drinkers of the world. What a great beer for people who have only slugged away on white wines. It's a great beer to draw the wine snobs closer to the light."
"no doubt a solid beer, but still a bit underwhelming from something i expected to be more memorable."
"Pours out a honey blonde into a chalice glass. Nice carbonation with a 3/4 inch head that clings to life quite well. Smell is yeasty with a bit of malt sweetness in the mix. Taste is pleasant, but nothing impressive, a bit of tartness in there that didn't quite seem to fit. A fine brew, but nothing I'd go out of my way to find.."
"Aromas are dominated by a candied sugar sweetness. Thin layer of fruit as well. Flavor is dull. Way too sweet. Nothing suceeds in balacing this. There's some spicy and bitter notes that attempt to peak through. Finish is watery and uninspiring. Low-medium body."
"It poured a spectacular clear orange gold and developed a thin white head. The aroma is full of spice and fruit. The taste is bold and full of flavors. There are several spices and fruits competing for room here. It's a great blend and the flavor filled out as the beer warmed. A good solid medium feel to this with a bit of carbonation. I think there was a little hops, but no more than just enough to keep this from being too sweet, no bitterness at all. This one definately goes on the regular list."
"Bisciuty, toasted and caramel malt with notes of melon, herbs and other fruits. Alright I'll face the facts. I know this is a adjunct infested Belgian Macro screwed up by Interbrew but ya know what....it still tastes pretty good."
"Leffe Blonde looks more darkish brown and slight red than blonde. Extremely clear with phenomenal styrofoam-white large-bubble head, that bubbles like soap lather and sticks stubbornly to the glass like thick plaster. The reason I enjoy the appearance so much is because of the hue of the liquid itself, rich and darker than many others. Though the smell is excellent, I was expecting more complexity, or perhaps I was anticipating more yeast. There is definite musky yeast, with the malt extraordinarily well balanced with it. Nuttiness in the smell, along with apples and peaches. The aroma could have more complexity, but it is very well balanced; i.e. it does not rely solely on yeast. It is much the same on the taste. You can sense the malt very well on the front of the tongue, and even some hop in the finish. Of course, the yeast still is the dominant force in the flavour, giving phenolic tastes and dry dusty fruits. There are indeed grassy hop feels on the finish. Very dry aftertaste. Gaseous carbonation, burning on the tongue, very akin to many other Belgians, and perhaps not so good as some. This is not the most complex Belgian beer I have tried, but it still tastes so much better than the best of some countries. It does not excel only when placed next to its country's own beers, and it still is one of the better beers out there in its own standard."
"My local store has a ""mix a six"" thing so I tried this out. Not too bad for a Belgian blonde. The head settled fast on a light amber body. Smells pleasant like most Belgian pale ales. This tastes very malty, with some fruity hints. Not too much hops goin on here, very sweet. I find this very drinkable as it goes down very smooth. Would recommend to anyone looking for a light Belgian brew."
"Clear amber, with a huge white head. Smells of banana and clove dominate, obviously sweet. Taste - very sweet, some malt, has some dryness on the finish, but no real hops or bitterness present. Mouthfeel is good, but almost buttery or sticky. Reasonably good drinkability, no real taste of alcohol, but too sweet for me and not worth the effort of having more than one."
"Beer is good. Happy belgian beering."
"Drinkability: I only bought a single, so I can't say for sure. However, I think that this beer is too sweet to drink more than one or two."
"Interesting beer although I believe there are some better Belgian Whites out there for the lovers of this style."
"Prefer the tap to bottle as it feels less hot and more blalanced."
"I actually like this a lot better than most people seem to. It pours a really nice light amber color with a smallish head. There was tremendous lacing all the way down the glass. It had the aroma of sweet malt and the fruitiness of currants. The taste is sweetish but with a little bit of a bite. The flavor is enough to cause you to pause when you first drink a sip and look at the beer. It has more flavor than you think it should. It is a little thin in the mouth but goes down really easily and the second is better than the first."
"Very drinkable taste. Immediately in the mouth, it's largely light carbonation and sweet malts, with an occasional citrus burst. Most of the flavor came out in the palate of the aftertaste, which was dominated by muted roasted grains, creamy roasted corn, with notes of wintergreen. Hop dryness persists. Balanced--and smooth--for it's almost 7% ABV I thought."
"I like this beer, a lot. It pours a beautiful deep golden color, without much head, but head isn't really all that important most of the time. Nice faint honey scent. The taste is very sweet, with honey overtones, almost like a mead. Just enough bitterness to finish clean. Very tasty brew. I could drink this all day if it wasn't for the fact that it's 6.6% abv. :)"
"500 ml can: I liked this beer quite a bit. It is a pretty good abbaye style ale, despite it being fairly mass produced by Interbrew. It pours arich golden color, with a bit of a white head. Fairly decent lacing down the glass. The nose is a bit sweet, and bready and fruity. Somewhat remenicent of a tripel. Taste is sweet and a little fruity, with bananas and a hint of caramel sweetness. I really detected no difference between the can and tap versions. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing!"
"on tap, which was a nice change. Poured light and golden, clear. Disappointing brew. Tasted fairly watery, thought it might have been just me, but after reading some other reviews, I see I'm not alone. Did have some tasty yeasyness to it, also detected some bubblegummy Belgian type flavors. But overall, lacked body, flavor, and character. middle of the road Belgian, good to try on Belgian newbies."
"This is not a bad beer. It kind of had a ""dark"" beer feel to it, but was a blonde on the outside. The head was quite amazing. It was a pillowy creamy white and it did last for quite sometime. The smells given off were grainy, malty, a little fruity, a hint of some hoppage, and a smokey aroma. The taste was a little bit different, in that it had a little bit of a smokiness to it, with a tinge of fruit and alcohol in it. I thought this beer was fairly decent. Now, I just have to find the other Leffe brews."
"This was the first Belgian beer I ever had (about 2 years ago?). At the time, it was the highest ABV beer I think I had ever tried! Oh, how times have changed! I saw a single available today, so I tried one again (leading into a 750 of the far superior Allagash tripel). Overall, Leffe is a nice beer. Relatively full-bodied, nice taste and aroma. Only is diminished by the competition, as it is a quality ale. Sweeter as it warms, and a bit more watery than the best of the style. Nonetheless, a few of these would never be a bad thing. Even mediocre Belgian beer is good. What a country!"
"Leffe Blonde wonderfully complements a quiet evening of reading or music listening."
"Basically a simple, very well done, belgian blonde. A perfect belgian session beer, and an asskicker all in one. Great beer."
"Drinkability- easy to sit back and enjoy this. This was one of my first brews I tried on tap in Belgium last year when I first hit Brugges- when I knew nothing of the world of Belgium beer. At the time, I thought this was one of the best beers that I have ever had. I still enjoy it, but have grown to appreciate others a little more."
"Not awful but filtered beyond reason, not a patch on an abbey pale or duvel (or any good tripel)"
"Full bodied, medium to heavy mouthfeel, alcohol is hardly noticeable. Very light carbonation, a moderately complex taste. I've had this on tap and prefer the bottle, and my advice is to let it come to just below room temperature to let the sweetness fade and more flavors to come through."
"this was much criper and fleeting than i had expected. the flavor is sublimely subtle and smooth. i also didn't feel this was as complex as it is subtle and fleeting. balanced toward the malt and driven by a pear flavor it dries crisply on the tongue then evens out to a lingering not unlike a ripe pear again. a compliment to the herbal notes would center on what i feel is corriander. in the end i confess i felt it was a tad dull but made for super drinking for any guests and were quite drinkable since i got a few the first time."
"Pours a brilliantly clear golden color with a massive large bubbled white head. The smell is rather faint but reveals light fruit and yeast. The taste is much more pronounced with a semi-sweet fruit, spices, yeast, and a warming alcohol that is blended nicely. The hops are nearly hidden as you catch maybe what you think are hops along with the subtle carbonation in this one. This is a medium bodied beer with a light stickiness and finishes slightly sweet. I could stand to have this one again. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Light body, coating from the sweetness."
"If I could have this on tap somewhere, I think I'd like it better. For my money, I think I'll try to find another bottled Belgian pale ale."
"Light bodied beer, carbonation levels slightly stronger than expected but produced a nice crispness on the tongue. Relatively clean aftertaste. Very drinkable and this was better on tap than what I have had in bottle."
"Beef Notes: Many have knocked it, but you can sign me up. It's my Belgian Budweiser. I'm getting a vision of me paying $8.50 for a sixer in the near future."
"Overall: it is a good brew. Nothing special to write about but it is , and was worth the try."
"After drinking this beer I thought it was ok. Appearance looked pretty nice. Nice clear light gold color to it. Smell consisted of some malts, but that's it. There really wasn't anything to smell, seems a little too clean. Taste was also clean with some spiciness towards the end. Nothing really exciting here. If you want a belgain pale ale, go get a duvel."
"Not as good as the on-tap version, but still a solid, low-end Belgian beer. Along w/Kronenbourg, Leffe Blonde is available at nearly every bar, café, and restaurant in my area, and while it costs the same as Kronenbourg it's certainly the better of the two. Nice beer for a night out."
"Your first impression of the taste is sweet, sweet, sweet. And not malty sweet, like sugary sweet. I don't know if they use lots of cane sugar in the brewing process but whatever it is, it is overdone. For the first time in any of my reviews I will use the adjective ""cloying"" to describe it. Once the wave of sweetness passes you get some grapefruity citrus and the peppery spice, some rounded alcohol flavors and hints of honey. This is a bold tasting beer, it definitely asserts itself on your palette and is sticky in the finish. Problem is it's way too sweet and not nearly complex enough to pull it off. I seem to remember having better impressions of the bruin in the past but I'll take a miss on the blonde next time."
"Sweet and flowery nose, orange and mild cloves. Nothing that really grabs at me or that I find particularly interesting. No distinctive malt or hop. Smooth and a bit peppery. Really middle-of-the-road across the board. Better than macro pap for sure."
"Serve with corn on the cob, or actually, why bother serving?"
"Decent...maybe...sort of..."
"The yeast is there and sticking in the retaining head. Orangy and cloves are for teas not beer, bit well manged on-tap at the up-and-coming Safari Club."
"The beer seemed very delicate on the tongue with an almost champagne-like quality. I would recommend this beer if you like a good flavored, aromatic ale."
"A very nice beer, I wouldn't mind having another."
"This brew pours a very deep golden with a very nice white head. The aromas are spicy, and inticing but too sweet. The aromas are a bit subdued compared to the draught version of this brew, but the taste is pretty much the same...too damn sweet! This could be a very good Belgian ale if they tone down the sweetness and spiciness a bit and add some more malt/hop flavors. The mouthfeel was a bit too thick and syrupy, yet less syrupy than on tap, but not too bad and the drinkability suffers from the sweetness..."
"Glowing golden yellow color, strong medium white bubbly thick head appears, fades within a short while to a thin skim and thin ring, lace in minimal strings. Nice nose of malty sweetness, dulled mild citrus and banana yeasted spice and tiny phenolic notes coming through as it warms. Taste is quite mild of malt sweetness, wheat, some dulled citrusy lemon notes with a touch of banana and spices. Its a nice mix with some light hops, finishes pretty strong with a big fullness on the palate and some fruity dryness with peppery notes. The feel is well carbonated with a slightly small start but grabs hold quickly and becomes quite full with a nice subtle dry finish thats crisp and dulled of citrus and spice. Not all that flavorful or complex but the carbonation makes up for some of that. A pretty nice blond abbey that comes across like a hefe on steroids."
"Nice looking deep golend. Streams of CO2 rise at a rapid clip. A big fluffy white head adorns the surface. Lacing if full and intricate. Aroma's musty and yeasty. A little spicy. Bready. Pretty good. Flavors are crisp and refined. Bready yeastiness is quite nice. Some subdued fruity esters....seemingly apples and pears. A little pepper spiciness. Pretty nice taste all together. Body is about medium and the mouthfeel is nice. A little airy, but carbonation seems right all together. This is a belgian beer I would get again."
"Overall Impression: It’s odd; there is a taste at the middle that I’m finding distracting. Smells great, first taste is equal to the smell, the finish is dry and pleasing, but it bottoms out in the middle. Close as I can describe it is a flat metallic taste, which I’ve experienced with a hop bitter in the aftertaste before, maybe the spices are covering it there. Perplexing. I better sample another 15-16 of these to figure it out. Will have to be in several sessions, this beer is filling and isn’t quite a session beer. A good beer with an odd weak spot; if you like the Abbey’s give it a shot."
"Pours a golden blonde, so light you might call it a pilsner. Certainly the billowy white head reminds me of a pilsner, with the exception that the head stays thick and is much longer lasting then what I see in a traditional Czech Pilsner. The carbonation of this brew seems to just go on and on, a very nice touch! Smells cool and crisp, perhaps a honey aroma in there? Taste is bold and hoppy, sweet and refreshing. A solid brew, and one that reminds me why Belgian strong pale ales are some of my favorite beers."
"On tap poured into a Leffe glass. It pours a light golden color with a 2 finger head. There is a nice row of lace rings left on the glass. The smell is full of sweet lemon and banana. There is also some malt and yeast to the smell. The taste is malty with a bit of citrus and anise. Only a tiny bit of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly nice, just a little light. The drinkability is very nice. A decent Belgian brew."
"clear golden honey color with a very good thick white head and a very good amount of carbonation. fruity spicy aroma with slight hints of maltly sweetness and some peppery alcohol (or maybe that's the typical ""belgian"" character picking through). very nicely balanced, the hops are almost undectable. this does have a very good amount of carbonation. after sitting for awhile in a chimay glass and allowing some co2 to condense into a somehat thick head the mouthfeel alomst takes on a toffeeish slightly syrupy malty mouthfeel. very tasty. this is an excellent beer."
"Leffe Blonde poured a lovely deep gold. The head fell to a very thin white covering over the beer until the end leaving lots of lacing. A nose of fruit, malt, and yeast. Feels pretty good in the mouth, maybe a little thin, followed by a decent aftertaste. Not what I would call strong but very potable. This is a good Belgian blonde ale that could be enjoyed by all. It is a refreshing pale ale and a good starter for the newbie."
"Poured a very clean and bright golden bronze - too clean and bright, seemed quite processed. Not terribly flavorful - typical Belgian blonde ale flavor profile, but muted and pedestrian. Some vague fruity flavors and a bit of yeast, but nothing that reaches out and grabs your attention. Not bad, but much better examples of the style out there."
"($9.84 / 6-pack)"
"Deep gold color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied Belgian Ale. Malts are sweet and fruity. Hops are a touch spicy. Light and refreshing. Kind of mild for an Abbey Ale. Drinkable, but nothing special. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Too bad there is not much here. If the wheat and clove allowed the other flavors some more room to assert themselves I think this would be a much better ale. As it stands the flavors block each other and there is no path or syemetry for some of the lesser flavors to stand out."
"This is an OK euro mega brew that has some of the characteristics we look for in a Trappist ale with a more smooth drinkability,,,a great starting point to introduce Belgian style ales to newbies."
"Comments  Theres nothing real exciting to this one, but it got the job done. It lacked the bite that I personally enjoy in a good BSPA, but went about its business successfully."
"Dark yellowish brew with a nice foamy head. I taste the usual belgium spice but still less present then I would have hope for. This beer is also less hearthy then I would have liked. I guess this is a good introduction to belgium brew but not up to the level of a great brew."
"Pours a very light golden color with a white fluffy head that recedes slowly and leaves light lace around the glass. Nose is sweet yeast and malt, some fruit and honey. Flavor is rich and sweet, without being overpowering. Smooth mouthfeel delivers yeasty, biscuity flavor over the tongue with a slight carb tingle and a lingering hop bitter. Light flavor, very crisp and refreshing."
"This is definitely an enjoyable beer, but unspectacular in the realm of belgian blondes. Not quite a session beer, but maybe a good choice if I was looking to drink a handful of beers with a touch of exotic interest."
"Drinkability: I'd definitely be in the mood for another, but the only time I drink this beer is when I'm eating mussels at this restaurant I go to on a semi-regular basis. Otherwise, I can't see myself buying this in the store when there are better ones in this style to be had."
"A nice beer."
"Leffe poured with a nice rocky, light tan head. Clear golden in color with carbonation seen streaming from the bottom of the glass. The long lasting head turns to a decent lace which sticks to the sides of the glass. Aroma is of slight malts, yeast, and sweet fruity notes. There's also some citric character and a hint of hops. The start is smooth, with the malts and fruitiness coming forward first. Theres a mild hoppiness towards the end, with not much of an aftertaste, although some sweetness does linger a bit. Leffe seems to be a bit thin in the mouth unlike the suggestion on the back of the bottle that this is a full bodied beer. Carbonation is moderate on the tongue. Alcohol is completely hidden for the most part, but does become a bit more apparent as the beer warms. The flavors in this Belgian Ale dont hit the palette as they typically do in most other Belgians. The flavors are more subtle, making for an easy drinking Belgian that is a good introduction to the style."
"Gorgeous looking beer. Crystal clear golden color with a large, long-lasting head. Highly carbonated. Aroma is pretty strong with clove and bannana. Taste is very sweet and quite yeasty. Very refreshing, but simple in the taste. Kinda one dimensional for a belgian."
"A little sweet for my tastes, but certainly good for a belgian ale. Trying this on tap was fun and interesting. The beer definitely didn't bore me, that's for sure."
"The bar I was at in Harvard Sq. had an Interbrew tap with Leffe Blonde, Hoegaarden and Stella. Poured nice yellow color, unfortunately not much head due to the bartender's pour. Smells of sour wheat, and sweet malt. I don't detect much in the way of spices. Taste is pretty unique. I've had this beer many times and could pick it out in a blind taste test in a second. Has a sweet/sour malt flavor with a definite and distinct medicine flavor that provides bite. [from phenols]? There are some hops in here as well. Coats the mouth in a weird way as well, almost like cough syrup. A distinctive beer, yet very drinkable."
"I found Leffe perfect for heat, and I was in France in the hottest summer in over a century. Wonderful beer for late nights, when your winding down, or for a quick lunch. Amazing quality for a mass produced beer. I hope the quality does not diminish in the bottle as I brought a 3L home!"
"Pours a deep golden color with a nice sticky head,the aroma is very yeasty and a little fruity.Taste has a honey taste that hits you right away along with some spicey yeast notes not alot of fruitiness in the taste in my opinion.I like this beer but there are alot better Belgian pales out there."
"I tried this beer at Eulogy in Philly. It really had a fruity, yeasty smell. The taste was the same, with a touch of banana. A nice head that lasted throughout. Great finish. Maybe not the best of the Belgians, but still a good brew. Was a real hit with my wife. I will definately try again."
"Had this beer on tap at the local pub. It poured a light amber color with a tall, white head that left respectable lacing on the glass. The aroma was very malty with some spiciness - like many Belgians. The flavor was somewhat thin and not very distinct. The wheat was the most prominent flavor, but I just really didn't think there was anything special about this one and didn't care too much for it."
"If my wife was writing this review, it would be a perfect 5. Brought home a six pack, which I found unique. Poured a nice golden hue, no fear of sediment. Nice lacey head. The taste was crisp, very little bite. Subtle hops. I could have drank the entire six pack myself, due to the smooth non-bitter flavor. I chose to leave four for my wife."
"For the aroma, I find it slightly drinkable."
"Served in a 330cl bottle. Smelled like a Belgian beer -- kind of rich and somewhat fruity and malty, but the taste was very light and fairly indistinctive. It has an amber color and the head poured pretty full, but died soon after. The carbonation was light and the mouth feel nice. It had a pleasant finish with a small hint of hops. A drinkable beer."
"Not a bad beer at all..........just somewhat tame compared to all those other crazy Belgians out there. Still, at a price lower than most of the others, I'd probably have another one at some point."
"This Belgian would be terrific if it wasn't filtered like Brita water. Gold, crystal appearance with a large, fluffy head that disipated slightly. Predominant malt smell, with some banana fruit and a little yeast. Tasted of malt and banana. Little honey and bubblegum flavour, with next to no bitterness. A disappointing Belgium."
"Overall: Ask anyone what their first Belgium beer was; and I guarantee that 90% will say Stella Artois, Chimay, Hoegaarden or Leffe. Widely available at even the smallest dive bar in Belgium, so much so that I often find I heavily rely on a Leffe Blonde at 4am in the morning after a serious day on the beer. Despite the tendency to knock this beer for its mass-appeal, I will most certainly refrain from doing so. At the end of the day this is a Blonde Ale, it is no Westie 12, merely the equivalent of a session beer that happens to be produced by Interbrew. That said, it is still leagues ahead of most other Countries session beers IMHO. A decent, solid, Blonde beer that has enough restrained flavors to convert macro drinkers, whilst having enough character to retain some loyalty from seasoned drinkers. I still occasionally enjoy this beer, and will continue to do so. Far better on draft than from the bottle I find."
"A pleasant, slightly sour and fruity beer. Complicated. The aftertaste is the only thing that I would change; it stays with you, and is a bit too sour for me."
"This beer is a wonderful golden hues, rich, with a slight head, and was served in a genuine Leffe chalice. I really enjoyed this. Strong clove notes, as from any good Beligium, this beer was better than I had remembered and I savored it with each sip. This is a fairly tame Belgian though, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get into the style... also is a ""major"" brew of sorts (yeast and spiciness of the clove do stay to the back enough to be a transitional beer). All in all, a great brew, deserving of its reputation."
"Poured slow to avoid an eruption out of the glass, nice 2.5"" head--diminishes within a few minutes. Liquid gold with a cloud-like head when first poured. Fine bubbles race to the surface and maintain a thin layer throughout the beer. Nice Lacing. Smell is Sweet and ""perfumey"".... Typical belgian sweetness gives way to a nice hoppy bitterness (Almost champagne-like). These are nicely balanced to create a very drinkable blonde. Took a break from the tasting to let it warm up and more of the flavor that I fell in love with when drinking this beer on draught is coming out. Orginally, this was my first belgian beer and I have been waiting for months to try it again. Last time it was on draft and had a tad more character, but nonetheless, I was very impressed with the bottled version. I will always go back to this one and always recommend it as a stepping stone to some of the more prominent belgians."
"Served in a goblet with a Leffe logo even on it (which didn't impress me too much, I have one at home). Thin layer of head around the rim. Appearance was a pale cloudy straw, what I expect from a light Belgian. Nose was sweetish, some spice and a bit of apple/pear. Taste was sweetly/sour, less spice than was in the nose, but definitely notes of apple/pear in there. Thick mouthfeel, an okay sipping beer to be enjoyed with a meal, but nothing in the realm of a sessional."
"This beer poured into the glass a crystal clear gold color, then when held up into the sunlight produced a beam of pure 24 karat gold on my arm. The head that was produced was thick, foamy and long lasting (almost too long lasting) it was a light beige/white color. The lace that was created was intricate and delicate in nature. The aromas that came from the glass and bottle were of malt, fresh hops, grass, fruit (pears), bananas, bread, and spice (black pepper). The tastes that rolled across my tongue were of sweet malt, fresh baked bread, bananas, fruit (pears), hops (floral, herb), a slight alcohol and I swear cocoa, very slight, but I swear I tasted it. The aftertaste when first poured was drying on the tongue, but as it warmed, it became creamy and a banana flavor emerged. Decently carbonated and medium bodied (decent mouthful) was this beer. It was fairly crisp, fresh, sweet and creamy over all. I must say though, the aromas and tastes were not overwhelming or pronounced as I would have thought or liked. But it is drinkable, not the greatest, but I wouldnt turn my nose up to it"
"This beer has a perfect, pure white head, and the lacing is fantastic. It looks a little too dark for a blonde, though. It's a yellowish light brown. I describe the aroma as ""thick"". It's very wheaty, but also smells sweet. Tastes good. Again, some wheaty tastes, but it's also sweet and even a little syrupy. It feels OK in the mouth, but not as crisp and refreshing as I had hoped. Very drinkable, though. Not sure what it is about it, but I could have several in one sitting."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden color with a fluffy white head. The head retains itself for the duration leaving a nice, sticky lace on the glass. Aromas of sweet bananas are initially detected, mixed with light malt and a mild spiciness of cloves. The taste is equal to the aroma, moderately sweet with a slight touch of spiciness. This is a very well balanced beer, crisp, refreshing and easy to drink."
"Very nice smell: spice, citrus. The front is sweetish, spicy. The middle brings on a slightly strange sour malty flavor. The finish is fresh, dry, with noticeable alcohol. The aftertaste is a little sour... strange. Overall, this beer is ok. I actually preferred it cooler than warmer. For that reason, and because of the funky aftertaste, this beer should probably be drunk as quickly as possible."
"This beer poured a bright clear golden with a effervesinet white head. The head clung to the side of the Belgian glass. The aroma was mild and of malt. The flavor was mellow and I could not taste any hops. The mouthfeel was light and bubbly from carbonation. I found this a nice beer for sipping on a hot day. I probably won't be drinking this again for awhile. It is too subtle for me, but for its style it was good."
"I tried this bier on a tip from a bar keep at the Steelgarden, within the Bethlehem Brew Works. All in all, it is not a bad beer. It is a little lighter than I expected color-wise. The aroma is decent, with hints of spice and fruit. A very legitimate Belgian brew that I would probably recommend as a beginner to the world of the Belgians. Prost!"
"This pours an orangish color with a long lasting creamy head. It has a spicy malted nose that is just wonderful. This beer has an excellent taste that is well complemented by the creamy mouthfeel. The taste is malty with a pleasant and enjoyable hop undertone."
"Pours with a beautiful long lasting just slightly off-white head, resting atop a clear rich deep gold liquid. Fresh fruity and spicy malty notes in the nose make for a very appetizing harbinger of what awaits. Taste is a tasty candyish mix of fruit, malt, a bit of breadiness..all very fresh-tasting & lip smackingly delicious. Finishes smooth and deceptively drinkable, drys oh-so-slightly in the end. This was a nice find, I recommend it without reservation."
"This meduim amber colored beer was served with a minimal amount of white head, but a decent amount of foam could be coaxed back by swirling the glass. The aromas were strong on bubble gum, orange, and coriander. Very pleasing. The taste is also sweet, with that bubble gum note, followed by smooth orange creme and just a touch of coriander. Some hops are noticeable in the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and supple. Simply luxurious on the tongue. The drinkability is also very good. This is an impressive beer, and i can see why so many call it one of the favorites."
"Found this one on tap @ the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. Sunshine gold in color this beer pours a nice slightly fluffy head that leaves a decent lace down the sides of the official glass. The aroma is very simple sweet and effervescent, not a lot of hop aroma here. The biggest jump out you flavor in the brew is the clovey spice that kicks in during the finish of each sip. Very sweet simple and enjoyable with a touch of alcohol biting the palate. A relatively lighter bodied beer, very good and refreshing."
"Clear gold color, tiny head forming into a little but of lace. This medium bodied brew is dominated by sweet maltiness, with a zingy carbonation feel. A tiny hint of hops and alcohol tries to get through but becomes just a hint. There's nothing exciting here, a smooth and easy to drink brew though. I considered it refreshing."
"Overall, uncomplicated, fine, if unremarkable."
"There is some spicy taste in this beer that makes me think of Duvel. I don't know what it is, maybe someone can tell me. :) However being a big Duvel fan I don't think it tastes as good as in the Duvel. Overall it's a decent blonde with a special kind of taste I don't really fancy. Everyone should try it though, it might float your boat. :)"
"Basically what I got from this beer was smoothness, easy to drink not overwhelming in alcohol or taste, what I would think of as a Belgian session beer if you wanted to drink a few or more over the course of an evening."
"Nice clear golden pour, white head which quickly fades to a good lace. Aroma is sweet, maybe cotton candy-like. Initial taste is banana-juice all the way - quite sweet, with a little spice in the end, possible a hint of alcohol. Overall a fantastic and consistent brew."
"the beer is lighter in body than most belgians, but it does not really hurt it. it is silky smooth with a little bit of tingly carbonation and just a slight warming out of the pretty low alcohol content. it is very sweet, but you will get some nice spices in the end. there is not a lot of alcohol, so there is not a lot of alcohol flavor. overall, it is a pretty good brew that you should try if you want something different."
"Leffe Blonde: Poured in a Leffe Goblet. Nice looking amber beer, with a surprisingly mild apricot aroma. The taste was sweet with a significant alcohol warmth and taste. In fact, I was surprised that the alcohol level was not as high as many other beers I’ve had. In other words: mild taste brings out the alcohol."
"Mostly clear (why is this beer clear?) dark gold color, big-bubbled white head of 1/2 an inch. Laces tend to decompose a bit. Slightly estery aroma, touched with some lemon. Reserved spicy malt flavor, some sense of clove and a more silky quality that's somewhat honey-like. Medium carbonation mutes hop senses, and the brew finishes with an overall lightly-browned toast effect. Overall, there's not much sense of alcohol, but also lacks major flavor distinction. It can tend toward the cloying side, as well. I also didn't expect it to be as transparent as it was."
"a little to sweet so much as I don't think I could drink another. A little to much alcohol flavor, almost like whine.the fruity sweet flavor was too much in the end not the best blonde IMHO!!"
"My only concern is with drinkability, it would seem to me to be a little to much constant sweetness for continuous consumption."
"A translucent gold color on the pour, the head magnanimous, frothy texture, the lace in pertaining sheets. The nose dominated by the malt, hints of citrus, fresh and clean. Front is malt and cloying sweet, top is lean and lanky, the finish has minimal carbonation, adequately hopped, but does Ring By Beer Bell!"
"Pours a beautifull deep golden colour topped by a huge white creamy head. This beer has a sweet aroma and sweet taste. Aftertaste is sweet and it's quite long lasting. It's one of my 2 favourite beers. I like sweet beers. If you don't like sweet beer then i wouldn't reccomend this one..."
"Pours a very lovely rich golden color with a creamy white head that clings to the sides of the glass as you drink.  The aroma is sweet and almost syrup like.  The taste is also on the sweet side with notes of honey and cream.  A nice beer, especially for a beginner whos just starting to sample Abbey-style beers."
"I found that I like this beer for the fact that it is not so overwhelming as most of the Belgian Abbey-style ales, but it will seem too understated for Abbey-ale purists."
"Anyway, this is a great Belgian for both a beginner or one early in the game. The first time I had this beer, I had maybe one or two Belgians under my belt and thought this was a bit too busy for me. After having had some 25 different beers in the past month, then trying another Leffe, my taste has developed into a much greater appreciation of this beer. So if you don't like it first, drink around some other tastes and come back. I'm fairly certain this one will grow on you."
"Crystal clear, deep golden/amber with a hugh foamy & rocky white head that holds extremely well, buoyed by a very fine and effervescent carbonation. The tiny, slow rising bubbles add to the enjoyment of the appearance. Extensive lacing is created throughout the serving. The body is medium/full with an exceptional creaminess in the mouth from the very fine carbonation. The aroma is softly sweet, almost candyish, with a light citrus fruitiness and subtle phenolics. The flavor is a gently fruity (citrusy... orange?), and sweetly grainy malt that's lightly backed by hop bitterness and gentle spice. It finishes softly dry with some gently lingering peppery spiciness that's very nice and helps to keep the sweet malts from becoming cloying. Well balanced, firm and round, but somewhat limited in character. An excellent crossover beer into the world of Belgian ales."
"Too processed and clean for a Belgian blonde, sweet to the point of almost being syrupy on the palate. There are other Belgian blond ales that are far superior to this one. Perhaps worth a try if you appreciate the style."
"The beer is a golden/tan color. Upon smelling it, I noticed a slight hop smell and a strong fruit smell. The fruit was one of the first things i tasted on my first sip, afterwards, the hoppy bitterness hit, but this was pleasant. This beer is very good, and very light and refreshing . It is something i could drink easily in the summer time."
"Tannish in color, and clear with a large thick head, foamy even, but evaportated quickly. The clearness of the beer was striking. Mine smelled somewhat harsh, stale almost. Tasted rather sweat, lots of syrupy, sweet, and citrus. Very smooth gong down but not thin. Overall it had some flashes of being a great beer, but the harsh smell seemed to dominate this one. I bought this as a single bottle of a pack, maybe is was old, that's why is what sold that way. Anyway, I am kinda glad I only had one to drink....Whose next ?"
"Huge off white head with tight carbonation.  golden amber color.  great complex aroma, slightly spicy.  deceptively pale and drinkable.  some vanilla and mixed fruit flavor.  somewhat spicy. little to no hop character and leaves beer unbalanced."
"Its Ok, but i don't think its anything outstanding, but i don't think its meant to be, a bit sweet, and one of the more commercial Abbey blond style belgian ales."
"I thought this was an enjoyable beer. Mildly sweet with subtle fruit and spiciness. Hazy golden appearance. Limited complexity when compared to other Belgian triples/pales. Could easily knock back a few of these. A good entry level Belgian brew."
"Can't agree with the reviews. I thought it was a snappy, fruity Begian Single. Not as big or complex as the Trippels, but a tasty beer none the less."
"You should also make serve at just below room temp, as the flavours seem to get better."
