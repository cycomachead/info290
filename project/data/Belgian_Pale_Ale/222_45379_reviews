"Overall- A quite tasty and more sessionalble Belgian pale ale. While not quite to the level of its bottle fermented brethren, it is very crisp and tasty none the less and makes for a very delicious brew."

"Fairly clear straw with a lingering head of white foam. Aroma is floral, with lemon zest and Belgian yeast funk. There's a bit of spice and perfumey notes. Flavor is lemony and minerally, with a cracker malt backbone. Very clean and refreshing, with a great balance of bitter finish and citrus character."

"O-A tasty Belgian Pale that doesn't go overboard in any one area. I found the $9 pour to be somewhat ridiculous but that's the bar's fault. I will take the traditional Duvel over this every time but I haven't stumbled upon this on draft before and trust the brand enough to spend the money."
"O: this is what I tell every customer it is - a mellower, more 'easy-drinking' version of Duvel (as if Duvel Sr. is laborious to drink!).... most casual or less-adventurous beer drinkers really dig it, while some feel it's too restrained... pleases most though"

"A nice lighter Belgian ale that goes down easy and is pretty satisfying. Not as good as the standard Duvel, but worth trying."
"O: So they tweaked the Duvel recipe for draught. I guess I kind of get it, the bottled version of duvel does not lend itself to the tap lines, mainly due to its strength. So they take the abv down a little, lighten the body to make it more sessionable, and make it noticeably more hoppy for good measure (this is America after all). It's still a very good beer, just not the Duvel I know and love. It feels just a little dumbed down in all respects compared to its bottled counterpart. The real problem is the name. Putting 'Single' on the bottle in a Belgian context will lead people to believe that this is modeled after an abbey single. Certainly not the case at 6.8% abv. Maybe they should just make a beer more akin to an abbey single for draught. The market is trending in that direction these days anyway, demand for true session offerings is on the rise."

"Overall (4.25): I really, really like this beer. It typifies the style in terms of dry, relatively clear, golden, non-brett interpretations—to a “T.” Other than not being as fruity and not quite as spicy as a lot of other versions of the style, it takes the standard and nails it. Love this beer."

"OVERALL: A very good pale ale. Solid flavors, nothing earth shattering, but a lot can be said about execution. I'd have this again. Duvel is a great brewery."

"Starts with a rich body and the pale malt, but no graininess. Next comes the sourness, followed quickly by a notable and balanced hop. The aftertaste is short and mostly sour. The carbonation is low."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was very happy to find it available on tap for growlers in a local package store (QB's in Pojoaque, NM)"
""
"Overall pretty solid and better than the draft version in the U.S. with a more pronounced yeast spice character. Not as intriguing as your standard Duvel but surely more quaffable and of the same bloodlines."

"O: I really enjoyed this draft-only offering from Duvel."
""
""
""

"O-a very drinkable and decent pale ale. has some off flavors, but they're forgivable. the carbonation is a bit off and gives the beer and almost watery aspect. an interesting try but a let down when compared to its big brother."
"On-tap at The Cheeky Monk over lunch. The beer was served in a CM Tulip and arrived transparent yellow with a finger's width of white head, some retention and lacing. The nose is relatively mild with hints of pilsner malt, earthy floral hops, and toast. A hint of belgian yeast as well. The flavor is very similar to what is experienced in the nose. Mildly bitter with a more pronounced bready character. Mildly sweet.Lighter end of medium bodied and crisp yet smooth. Moderately carbonated and a hint of dry. Easy to drink but not a lot going on here. Was expecting more. Not bad just not fantastic."
""
""
"O: This is a really great beer and a surprise to have at BJs. Good for them. Not as tasty as duvel classic but perfect with dinner."
"O: This beer is a lot easier to drink compared to regular Duvel and seems to share some properties of a pilsner in the taste."
"O: Very refreshing, easy to drink, and quite enjoyable. This was only the second time that I had the opportunity to try this beer but I will likely try it again when I come across it next."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, yeast, and some slight fruity aromas. Taste is the same with a slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I prefer regular Duvel from the bottle much more than this."
""
""
"Quintessential Duvel head, billowing and broken, over clear deep gold body, numerous trails of bubbles rising up side of glass. Fairly hop forward in the nose, light malt touch. Taste is more hoppy than floral, clean malt bill, though taste isn't as assertive as 'regular' Duvel. Medium-light mouthfeel, good effervescence. Glad I was able to try this, but my preference runs toward Big Brother Duvel, IMO one of the world's best beers."
""
""

""
"Very solid Belgian Pale Ale, could easily sit and drink this all day."
""
""
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, Belgian candy sugar and a pils like hop. In the taste, sweet to small dry fruitiness and a note of a pilsner like hop. A small hop bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruitiness to clean aftertaste. Easy and nice, quite pilsner like."
""
""
"The mustiness of Belgian yeast hits first. Pear, coriander and a touch of pepper sit behind. The flavors fall nicely into a body that's a little too light. I was expecting a Duvel light feel, but this a different beast all together. It's extremely drinkable and a nice complement to the Frites I ordered."
"A: Compared to 'regular' Duvel, this is softer, milder and, most obviously, less strong. I need to try a head-to-head, but from memory I may actually prefer this little brother to the big devil due to adverse(to me) effects of the higher ABV."
"A good beer for sure but there's not enough difference between the 2 beers to really stand out..."

"Taste is full of Belgian yeast. Banana is the featured flavor here, with accents of clove. The yeast full-flavored, yet not chewy and over-done. Well dont, Duvel. I feel it at the back of my mouth. Sits very light and feels clean. It feels like a euro lager. All the flavors are there, but when you finish you drink, all the flavors fade insanely quickly. It makes you want all those good flavors to come back—making you drink more. Drinkability at its finest."
"Taste is of tropical fruit and subtle belgian malts. Light bodied and easy to drink. Nothing that blows me away, but an ok beer. I would never order this for myself, but I know alot of people who like it."
"On tap at The Old Monk in Dallas. Has a huge, resilient white head that slowly breaks into large chunks. Clear gold in color. Smells, malty, yeasty, spicy and phenolic. Bubblegum notes come through upon a second take. Tastes of apricot and apples, with an afterthought of malt. Dry and light to medium bodied. Feels empty, comparatively speaking, like it needs something else involved, but I can't quite put a finger on it. Needs some balls."
"But, perhaps there's a niche market for those looking for lighter, simpler experience. I'm not going to be in that camp."
"Went to the Boston Belgian Beer Fest this afternoon. I rushed to the Duvel stand. I wanted to taste the Duvel Green I had heard so much about. Well, there it was under another name: Duvel Single. They changed the name as Green implied being green (saving the planet kind of thing), or being of a green colour and there was a lot of resistance from people. So they told me. Anyhow, I tasted the Duvel Single and it is all that I expected. It's a Duvel in a smaller package. Less alcoholic, more refreshing, like a everynight after work kind of beer. I truly enjoyed it. A nice alternative to a Leffe or a Stella which I tend to get a bit bored with at times."
"A pretty good beer overall. I’d definitely give it another try."
"Overall: To me, this beer strips away what Duvel is. Lacking the huge dryness and yeast character, this is simply a step down. My guess is that this was created in order to appeal to more of the mainstream market. Having this on tap is a ruse to trip up newcomers to the craft beer scene - order the regular Duvel."
"Overall, really nice. For my palate, better than the regular, but I'm sure that's the minority opinion."
"The beer is clear and light golden in color, with 1/2"" of white head that leaves some decent lacing on the snifter. The aroma is rather weak, offering hints of malt, Belgian yeast, and bread. Decent flavor, though I much prefer the standard version of Duvel. This version of Duvel is much lighter in seemingly all facets: appearance, aroma, flavor, and body. That said, it's a nice, light, crisp, refreshing beer. Drinkability is high. I would have this again."
"Nice drink. Not as complex as original, but had a quality for summer drinking."
"Clean and refreshing. Lacks the personality of the standard Duvel, but like its big brother this one drinks much lighter than the ABV would indicate. Very nice,!"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is full of biscuit malt with a lot of spices and some grassy hops. The beer smells much hoppier than regular Duvel. The flavor is also quite hoppy for a Belgian Pale Ale. I get some yeast as well as some spicy, European hops which compliment the bready malt very well. The alcohol is more well hidden than in regular Duvel. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
"I keep wanting to read both elements of well made pilsners and the original Duvel beer in the same glass as if they were blended. But this beer borrows what's best of both styles and brands and allows for a remarkably sessionable beer."
"D - Great drink out of the tap; I really like Duvel from the tap; give it a try, you won't be disappointed"
"This is a medium bodies brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall well done. The alcohol is well integrated but creeps out with greater presence as the brew warms and seems slightly more than the listed 7%. It maintains a pleasant warmth down the back of my throat and was a perfect pairing for my meal. This brew did not offer a drastic change from the standard Duvel offering, if anything it is lighter and a bit more approachable. Well done."
"It has the typical Duvel color, but not the characteristic half-the-glass-head. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but it's still decent. Aroma is also decent, but not particularly amazing. Good overall flavor profile, but not enormously complex. Good belgian style balance of malts and hops. Smooth and a bit bubbly on the tongue. Overall a decent choice, but I'd rather go with the original."
"O - I may has skew towards rating this higher just because I love Duvel, and this brew does Duvel justice. Drinking this, finally (!), makes me angry with myself for not buying Duvel Triple Hop when it was extremely fresh; this beer has convinced me that even the slightest variance on the basic Duvel is worth experiencing."
"Duvel Green tastes like a 8:2 ratio of Duvel to water. In other words, a slightly subdued version of Duvel. Still carried the nice amount of Belgian yeast and lemon rind overall. Big notable aspect to me was the tempering of alcoholic burn, compared to the regular. Still equally as crisp and clean. Good draft beer to rely on. Just a little muted in the flavor area."
"Served in a proper .25cL Duvel snifter. A big white head that is gone almost instantly. Sticky lacing. A lovely nose of coriander and Belgian yeast. The flavor is subtle, with some moderate spicyness, prickly hops, and a barely there malt profile. A dry finish, this beer is crisp and refreshing."
"I won another free drink. This is going well!"
"o - Overall a nice beer. Not my favorite Duvel beer but worth checking out. I enjoyed the citrus and bananas in the taste, and wish they had come through mroe in the nose. Worth trying but next time I would just order the regular Duvel."
"In all, although I still hold a stronger place for the original duvel in my heart, having finally had a taste of this brew made my day (i didn't really care about the score). Will give it another try when back in NY, or whenever I get to land this beer just as randomly in the future."
"Poured straw-yellow with a large white head that lingered throughout. Aroma of citrusy hops and grass. Taste started out similar to a witbier almost, with the citrus hops and mild spice, but shifted into Belgian yeast and the funk and grassiness that was in the nose. Light, and finishes off crisp with a semi-funky aftertaste. Easily drinkable."
"A delicious, easy drinking, light Belgian pale ale. A proper little brother to the bottled version of Duvel. Very good."
"O - Very nice belgian pale ale that I would recommend to someone who wants a lighter version of original."
"jd"
"D: very drinkable. Wouldn't order another one if they had a decent selection but if I'm stuck somewhere with limited selection and this is on tap...I'm a happy guy."
"Overall: This is a decent example of the style but it really just pales in comparison to the ambrosia that is bottled Duvel. I wouldn't turn this down, but if I had a choice, I would pick the bottled version every time."
"D: A good beer, but normal bottled Duvel is still much better. Not recommended; I wouldn't drink it again."
"Had this on tap at Cole's in Buffalo. Saw ""Duvel Green"" on their board and I wasn't sure what it was. Seems it is this beer. Pours a pale golden-yellow colour with a finger of white head. Really nice head retention, some lacing down the glass. Smells of more hops than a typical Duvel, I think it worked nicely for this. Spicy Belgian yeast in the aroma as well. Some bitterness, dry flavour. Really nice mouthfeel. I enjoyed this a lot."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice lighter Belgian-style beer worth drinking for a long time."
"Overall, this was a pretty good Belgian Pale Ale. Its certainly worth a try and I think I might prefer this one over the normal Duvel. Give it a try! Cheers!"
"Not as dry as the traditional Duvel but has great belgian flavors. Can't go wrong with this beer."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation. Pretty refreshing and smooth drinking, definitely a nice change from the traditional Duvel offering."
"A lighter version of the classic Duvel, but just not worth the extra cost ($10.95 / glass), glad to have tried it once."
"(D)- I think I like the regular better, but this was a solid beer that went down easy and quick. I would certainly have it again if the mood for it hit."
"12 oz. in a tulip shapped glass at Swell in San Francisco. Golden and clear, nice white head with good lacing. Average head retention. Muted malt aroma with some fruit notes. Nice amount of carbonation. Bitterness in the middle which quickly fades on the finish. Medium-light bodied. All-in-all a slightly above average beer, nothing bad, but nothing outstanding about it."
"Highly drinkable, especially with the slightly lower alcohol than Duvel. Recommended, a welcome addition to the draft list at this bar and I hope others around here start to carry it."
"D: Its drinkable but I'll never order one"
"Poured a light straw-like color with a nice 2 finger white head that left a solid lace on the glass. Aroma is great with a grassy floral smell. Some lemon zest, spice, yeast is there as well. Taste is what I expected from the smell. Really refreshing and crisp with some citrus, hay, and spice yeast. Definitely a ""lighter"" feel than standard Duvel. The drinkability on this was high, and a great beer to start the night with."
"D: Not as impressive as Duvel or the exemplary Triple Hop, but as a stand alone Belgian it's quite nice. For me really a light version of Triple Hop. Very American oriented, so if you like the hoppy American brews, this is a beer you need to try."
"This beer appears pale with at least 2 maybe more fingers of bone foam. The smell the smell is lots of lemon curd, some grassy notes and a wheat malt aroma. To me it smells like a sweet pilsner. The flavor is just as sweet as the aroma had dictated. The flavors are similar to malted sugar and lemon meringue pie. The odd part about the flavor is the odd perhaps off putting aftertaste. The flavor I found to best equate it was steamed carrots. Which I like for dinner, but not in my beer. But it is still a fairly good drinking brew, but it just has an odd component that I found it hard to get past to say it's anything special."
"It's about time I had this. It pours a clear saffron/dandelion topped by over two fingers of white froth. The nose comprises flowers, grass, wet hay, and a rather light vein of lemon peel. It all combines into quite the olfactory blast. The taste holds notes of earthy hops, pepper, clove, banana, orange peel, and lemongrass. It's all kinda one-sided, even if it's enjoyable. The body is a medium light, with a light carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, this is pretty good, but I don't think I could really drink all that much. So much Belgian-ness..."
"Despite the different categorization on style, I would be hard pressed not to compare Duvel Draft to the bottled version. While the original has a more impressive appearance and a snappier mouthfeel, the draft version definitely holds it own. A nice, ""lighter"" spin on the original."
"Duvel Lite? Yes, please."
"Pours a nice golden straw color with a huge head and quite a bit of lacing. Nose brings grain, Belgian yeast, and a bit of floral hops. Taste is light fruits, lemon, grain, citrus, a bit of spice, and some hops. Good, light mouthfeel with good carbonation levels. Drinks really well and is a nice spin on a classic."
"The mouth is sharp with good carbonation laid over a medium body beer. I think this is a pretty easy drinker and could be paired with cheeses, a good salad and definitely some mussels or shellfish."
"Duvel Green (or Duvel Draft) is a very refreshing beer that went great with the hot weather. It's basically Duvel except lighter in every way. The appearance is a lighter shade of gold, and very clear. The huge whipped egg-whites head on Duvel isn't as thick or long lasting on this one. Still it left extremely impressive thick rings of sticky lacing after each sip. The nose isn't as strong or complex as Duvel, and neither is the flavor. There are a lot less spice and yeast flavors. The body is closer to the light side of medium rather than full and thick like Duvel. Overall, this is a very drinkable light beer, and for what it is, it deserves a good score. I would probably choose the fully fermented regular Duvel given the choice again though."
"D: no problems downing my glass on this one, No where near the original in complexity but still glad to have tried it."
"D - So tasty and very well drinking, it's a fantastic version of Duvel available on draft (apparently in extremely limited quantities)."
"Decent brew. Easy drinking, not a real alcoholic punch in this one. I dug it, but would go with the traditional Duvel if I had to choose."
"Overall, Duvel remains a top notch beer, but Duvel Draft is mediocre at best."
"D: As super-drinkable as regular Duvel, but a full 1%+ LESS ABV? This Devil just got more sinister. However, something *is* lost without that fermentation, so while still extremely tasty, it pales just a bit next to its heartier sibling. Certainly worth trying if you find it on someone's taplist!"
"Pours a hazed golden yellow with full frothy white head, leaving good amounts behind and lacing. Scent is of grass, hay, fresh white bread and the faintest kiss of lemon. Taste is again of fresh cut grass and dried hay, the yeasts are minimal and give the taste of fresh white bread, the hops give the faintest touch akin to lemongrass. Lighter side of medium bodied, active carbonation, slick and silky. A pretty good all around Belgian Pale."
"D - big fan of Duvel, had been wanting to try this since I found out it existed. left a little disappointed. it was certainly drinkable compared to a lot of the other Belgian's on tap, but I wanted to move onto something more substantial."
"The reason why beer is popular, so phenomenal that my girlfriend likes it. A nice deep amber/yellow with a slight foamy head. Excellent, complex smell that provokes emotions it shouldn't with a simple beverage. And the taste, oh the taste, complex, subtle, not too strong of an alcohol flavor yet distinctly belgian, with moderate hop character. Lovely smooth flavor, delicate yet complex, very refreshing even when the AC's too strong. Fantastic beverage, thank you Belgiam."
"Pours a great clear gold color with a big fluffy/rocky white head. Head eventually comes down, but still has great retention. Aroma of fruits and yeast. Some apples, pears, and bread. The taste starts off with yeast, then some spicy malts and bread come in, followed by the apple and pear. The aftertaste is a bit yeasty. Light- to medium-bodied. Quite refreshing and tasty. I definitely prefer this to the regular Duvel - hope I can continue to find it on tap!"
"D- Honestly, I could sit out on that porch at Iron Abbey and drink quite a few of these. The atmosphere of a warm summer night and this beer complement each other well."
"D - Very crisp, refreshing, and very drinkable."
"D: I wouldn't pay for this one again. Even if it was reasonably priced, it would be overpriced. Sorry Moortgat. The Duvel Draft was unimpressive and yet very expensive. That's a bad combination."
"Price: $9.00"
"Duvel Green is like 80% Duvel, but 80% of the world-famous Duvel is still damn good. In fact, I might take this over the original on a particularly hot afternoon."
"On tap at Pangaea in Sacramento. Poured into a .25 L Duvel Green tulip. Huge, familiar, fluffy, white, lacy head, 2 inches tall, rests atop a golden body and leaves soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma is zesty lemony citrus and a slight touch of Belgian sour yeast. Taste is biscuity, slightly bitter, and even a bit pilsner-ish. Very easy to drink, which is no surprise whatsoever considering how well the abv is hidden on the ""regular"" Duvel. I ain't mad at 'em."
"Pours the typical golden Duvel color with some big white head. Good lacing and retention, though not quite as strong as regular Duvel. Smell is faint yeastiness, a bit of clove, and some grassy hoppiness. Taste follows exactly, with a bit of spice to it. Strikes me as a Belgian IPA, honestly, and I really like it. My only complaint here is on the feel, it's very thin, IMO. This doesn't have the fullness of classic Duvel. Great drinkability, a very good beer to start my day."
"Drank this at 3:30 a.m. at a Belgian bar I stumbled upon while wandering around NYC. Easy 5 for appearance, this or the regular Duvel in the Duvel tulip, doesn't get much better. Hazy golden with massive fluffy white head, looks excellent the whole time, like a beer bath with way too much bubble bath mix. Spice and light fruits in the scent. Taste is yeast, spice, pear, grass. Carbonation and alcohol taste toned down very much from the regular, I like. Nice dry bitterness. Very drinkable and refreshing. I liked it better than the regular Duvel. I just wish it was cheaper (paid $8 for a glass, I've never seen it less than $7)."
"The mouth feel is spot on with a medium to high carbonation and light body; devilishly drinkable."
"Notes: I am not particularly fond of its bigger brother but I can enjoy one now and then, and understand rather well its status and the complexities it offers. This? Feels like an unremarkable watered down version... I´m sure it can probably feel wonderful as a light Belgium option under hot weather."
"Had as Duvel Green Label. Pours a transparent yellow with a nice white head. Rich, malty, yeasty, slightly fruity and slightly sweet aroma is quite appetizing. Lively flavor is malty and yeasty with a citrus undertone and a hint of butterscotch. Smooth, fizzy texture leaves a fruity and slightly sweet finish."
"The carbonation is really dominant in the palate of this beer, a lot. There is almost a citrusy brightness to this beer, tastes almost like a tripel in flavor. Good yeast character, drinkability high and mouthfeel is good. I think there's a little too much carbonation in the mouth. Otherwise its good. Not as good as Duvel in my opinion but its a good beer overall."
"Overall a good draft selection when there isn't much else. But this is a few notches below their flagship bottled product."
"On tap at 515 in Santa Cruz. Poured into a Duvel Green tulip, a nice touch for sure. Clear gold with a big fluffy white head. Aroma is very grassy and lemony, with spicy phenolic notes and a light esteriness. Flavors of noble hops and light pear and banana, with a mild tart citric character. Finishes dry and clean like its big sister. I dig it."
"On tap as ""Duvel Green"" at Eulogy Belgian Tavern in Philly. Served in a Duvel Green tulip, the beer was clear gold with a tall, fluffy white head. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this one really blew me away. It seemed to share little in common with the original Duvel. Instead of the soft vanilla candy and clove notes, this was hoppy with almost sour lemon rind and big (for a Belgian) grassy hops. That was wonderfully balanced against mild biscuit and bread crust malt flavors that ran under the yeast and hop character. Heck of a beer. Find it and drink several."
"Poured into a tulip glass this clear golden ale has a nice thick frothy head with real nice lacing as you drink it. This is a session beer for me and I've gotten a lot of the Bud/Miller/Coors crowd who shy away from most things not macro to drink this and want more. It seemed to have less carbination than regular Duvel and has hints of apple in it."
"i likely won't be tryign this again as I just wasnt impressed with this beverage."
"Musty, earthy, slightly fruity aroma-makes me wanna mow some lawn. Taste is a similar grass cutting inspiration sweet malt with a little bit of floral stickiness. Mouthfeel lacked the Duvel delicateness and came across more as mineral water."
"Mouthfeel felt thinner that the regular Duvel and the flavor was less intense. Drinkability is alright, but the alcohol and spice notes get a little aggressive as it warms."
"Duvel Draft is pretty drinkable, but the places where I encounter it seem to attach a hefty price tag to it (~8 bucks a tulip), which is a drawback."
"I figured Duvel Draft would be lighter, but not taste so much different. This is closer to an Orval than an original Duvel, but I'm not complaining."
"certainly worth a try, but only if you've had ""original"" Duvel first."
"Drinkability: Simply a lighter version of the classic Duvel in all aspects, from the flavor, to the body, to the alcohol, to even the small-sized glassware. Which isn't a bad thing, really. Sometimes a Whopper Jr. instead of a Whopper will do just fine."
"D: probably very high if I were into this beer, given how light it is, but I can barely see myself finishing this glass."
"I had this on tap at Monks, it was served in a Duvel Green tulip. It is a pale, straw color with a very sticky 3 finger white head. The only scent I could detect was some spiciness, cloves?. The flavor was thin and disapointing. My wife thought it tasted like Miller Lite. There were hints of spiciness, but honestly it was bland. It is light in body and highly carbonated. I would avoid this one, IMO it is an overated brew."
"I suspect that Duvel Green shines when you pair it with good, deep-flavored food. I stopped in at BXL on my way to Grand Central for a couple afternoon beers, and Duvel Green's flavor just isn't big or good enough to serve that purpose (for me, anyway)."
"Just had this today on tap at the brewhouse in santa barbara - man it was wonderful! I had never had it before, and didn't notice in any reviews of it the fact that it has a noticeable brett character - but the one I had did, and it's awesome! Has most of the qualities I love about Duvel - the crisp pilsner malt character, the light/dryness, fresh crispness, 'appley' qualities, and nice big foamy mousse...but with the addition of the funky, brett character, that put it over the top. Totally awesome, like a farmhouse Duvel! I will drink 1 or 2 on tap each time I go there until it's gone...wonderful beer."
"D - I made it through this one pretty quickly. I was told it was an attempt by Duvel to make a begginer belgian which is not quite as strong as their traditional brew. I thought it was a nice subtle belgium style beer which doesn't overpower but still provides those classic belgian flavours."
"Drinkability - So-so. The taste of this ale is so unlike anything else I've ever tasted that I didn't even finish it. With that said, if you find this extremely limited beer on tap at your swilling establishment, give it a shot. It's unlike anything you've ever had."
"D: Ver good, but it's no regular Duvel!"
"I tried this on-tap at the BXL Beglian Cafe in midtown Manhattan."
"Maybe not a pale ale, per se, but rather, a Belgian Hefe-Blonde? Eagerly anticipated on draught at our local, Independent, my wife & I sampled it during the Fluff Festival. Underwhelming. I expected so much for a relatively rare & anticipated beer, especially from Duvel. Perhaps this is an attempt to win over the summer/hefe beer crowd who like lemon wedges & dancing ponies. The pour was a bright yellow with full white, fluffy head that left some good lace, with an aroma of crackery yeast & lemon-pepper. The flavor was a bit of a Hefe-Blond mix, not horrible if that's what you expect, but simplistic I thought. Yeasty with some spice & lemon, the drinkability was good, nice smooth & crisp. Definitely better for a nice summer day rather than fall evening. All in all, I'd rather save a couple bucks & have an Allagash white."
"On tap at Redbones in Somerville for $6.50. Served in the proper glass. Huge fluffy white head. To start, two things I notice different from regular Duvel: first is the much lighter yellow color of the body, and second is that it does not seem to be as carbonated. Smell was yeasty and spicy. Tasted like a normal Duvel also. Crisp and sharp on the palate too. The abv is a bit lower, which is what the brewery was presumably going for. It is actually noticeable, which not a bad thing. If they are trying to make an even smoother-to-drink Duvel, they have succeeded. It went well with a plate of BBQ food."
"F: Finishes slightly dry and almost disappears from the palate completely. A light banana taste seems to poke it head out at the finish as well, and a touch more Belgian yeast to finish it off."
"Very good lacing on this one. Light golden. Citrus grains hops and spices in the nose. Belgian spice and yeast dominant in the taste. Grains and hops are nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable. Pretty much a lighter version of duvel. Hopefully I can find this one in bottle form in the future for when I'm going Belgian crazy."
"D: Very fresh and flavorful Belgian blonde in a textbook example of the style. Excellent job, Duvel."
"D: Good in hot weather, or when out in the sun."
"I would like to try this next to the standard Duvel to really note the difference."
"D: Not quite as interesting as regular Duvel, but easier to put down. Give it a try if you're a fan of Belgian ales."
"Taken on its own merits, it was a pleasant blonde/pale drink of beer, but knowing its big brother so well I was expecting a little more in the body and mouthfeel. Would I have another? Yes."
"Why bother? It's worth trying, but the far more widely available variety is significantly better. Just disappointing all around. Still, it's nice and quite drinkable."
"On tap at sierra grill for the Duvel Green release, i wanna take the glass home. Poured a great lime green/yellow with a 1-2 finger head in the signature glass. Great belgian lacing is left behind and the head retains well for a pale. Smell is kind of weak, cant pick up much, belg yeast, spices, a bit of citrus and malts. Taste is better than smell, same elements but better balance, great citrus in here along with a solid belgian flavor. Mouthfeel is light with great carb, substance and a great belgian aftertaste coat, no alcohol taste for me. Extremely refreshing, 7% makes no appearance, hopefully i can enjoy this one again."
"D: I prefer the regular Duvel to this one, considering the cost."
"I would definitely drink this again"
"D - A great draft version of the Duvel, all the hops + yeast w/ a lighter feel and more quaffable effect. Very smooth and worthy of praise - a great representation of the style."
"D- Extremely drinkable... and particularly appropriate for warm weather. This beer is incredibly refreshing... almost thirst quenching. Highly recommended!"
"No matter how many beers a bar might have if they have the Duvel Green I'm gonna order one. As amazing as the original but lower enough in alcohol that you can drink it a lot easier and there is no alcohol aroma or bite to interfear with the pure pleasure of this beer. Get it anywhere any time."
"Yeah... it is a little 'green' and lacks the complexity of its big brother. I can't say that I'm that impressed with it, but it has made me appreciate how a few extra steps can take a relatively ordinary beer and make it into a world classic. Worth a try, but I won't be getting it again."
"Good beer but not nearly as good as a normal Duvel. This beer tastes a Duvel robbed of much of its complexity and depth of character. It's a light, refreshing version of Duvel that I enjoyed, but it's not something that I would seek out. The wide distribution and relatively cheap price of Duvel are pretty incredible for such a world class beer. I appreciate the brewery's attempt to make a light version, but the magic of the original just isn't there for me. This beer pours a clear bright yellow with a decent head. The aroma is yeasty and malty. There's a grassy note to it. The flavor is bright and adds in some apple cider flavor and light Belgian spicing. Mouthfeel is lively. Drinkability is good."
"a milder version of a duvel in the sense that its a plain solid bpa. very nice crisp pine hop with that 'green' grassy quality. a very well formed head of the brewery's form. a very consistent and text book beligan style pale ale. crisp hop and refreshing with a nice clean bitter finish that seems to have a mild mint quality to it. formulaic... not particularly unique."
"However those are where the simalarities end. The taste of this beer reminds me of what a Duvel light tastes like. Even though the ABV is only off by 2% the taste to seems considerably more. There was also no carbonation activity present after the pour, something that Duvel is known for. As a stand alone beer this would be a good offering but I am handicapped by the fact that this is under the Duvel name and because of that I automatically assume some stuff about the beer. It is an unfair comparison but it happens. Overall a good beer but if I want a Duvel I'll just reach for the original."
"Notes: An all time classic on tap. Who could ask for more?"
"It poured nearly identical to any Duvel I've had before, gorgeous golden blonde with a towering white head, however it left much less lacing and dissolved much more quickly than the normal Duvel. Bubbles drift upwards rapidly from the apex of the tulip. The smell was a bit different from the regular Duvel. It had a bit more hop presence and more fruitiness of a Belgian pale ale such as Heylissem or Grimbergen than the pilsener bite of Duvel. Also, the nose was indeed a touch weaker than expected. Very similar to the smell came the taste. Flavorful but not overly so. I didn't think much of it actually. Light and refreshing with very crisp carbonation dancing on the palate. Not very outstanding but a solid beer nonetheless."
"10oz pour into the appropriate glass at Flying Saucer served a surprisingly crisp gold with a massive head that slowly diminished to a clump of froth but left great lacing on the glass. Aroma was a nice amount of crisp hops and sweet malts. The taste is somewhat like a Duvel light, but the lingering finish comes through nicely and leaves a great balance of sweet malts, citrus hops and mild spice. The beer is quite light, crisp, and refreshing, much more drinkable in the summer than its bottled brother. This is just about as special as the bottled version, very enjoyable."
"Aroma was slightly peppery and phenolic, but less so than it's bottled counterpart. Some grain and light fruit, but nothing especially well defined. First sips had a crisp feel with sharp carbonation. Dry in the finish, with some very light hop element, and phenolic/clove traces. Flavor seemed less developed than bottle-conditioned Duvel also. No big fruit, just a slight banana taste from the yeast. It was refreshing, but for the price, i'd go with something different next."
"I don't think this would replace Duvels spot in my book, but could certainly be a refreshing change of pace, and I would like to see how these flavors offset some richer food. Glad I got the chance to try, worth checking out for sure."
"D: The subtlety this one has makes it go down really easy. I am glad I got a chance to try it."
"Overall this certainly is a ""lite"" version of the bottle conditioned ale, but it still is well worth a shot."
"Was at Ginger Man in NY where they have Duvel on tap. My GF who doesn't like beer normally, but likes Duvel ordered a Duvel. He asked Green or bottle.. Huh? He said he doesn't recommend green so she got the bottle. Can never go wrong with Duvel. Anyway, later he brought a sample of Duvel Green to taste and I know I had an IPA on my mouth and she a Duvel on hers, but my only impression of Green was, well, unremarkable. You expect DUVEL and get, eh. Want a light beer that doesn't taste like crap, this is for you."
"Drinkability: This would be a perfect summer beer, refreshing and pleasant, and easy to drink. While it seems less complex than the bottled Duvel, that would make it better for drinking on a social occasion over a meal or at a party. It would be very easy to finish off several of these."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and easy to drink; a brisk, but welcoming Belgian pale; not the most complex beer out there, and it shouldn't be considered for anything other than what it is"
"D- Less alcohol as well but this is not to far off from the bottled version, just with a different body. I could drink a few of these though and I am glad to see it on draft, I just wont be getting it that much."
"Very close to a Belgian pils. Really great beer."
"overall - I'm so glad I got the chance to try the draft version of my absolute favorite beer. It seems like a more sociable, accessible Duvel, which is definitely not a bad thing. The bottled Duvel is something you sit and savor, basking in its devilish glory. This is one you can drink more of, casually amongst good company. Either way, both are still excellent brews."
"D-Very nice. A flavourful ""light"" brew. I found this to be like a Belgian Pils....if such a thing existed!"
"Overall this is a great beer that you should try giving the chance."
"Overall a great session style beer from Duvel that is uber drinkable. Still, even with this the quality is top notch as expected in Duvel. Seek this one out."
"Note from 11/11/11. Now called duvel single. No change otherwise; beer tastes exactly the same as before.... good, but nothing extraordinary."
"Served on-tap at BXL cafe in the correct glassware. The color was a crisp golden one, with a thick white head. Aroma was slightly sweet. Taste was quite interesting; the sweet candy sugar taste of a Belgian, but lighter and cleaner than a traditional bottled Duvel. Minimal aftertaste, very easy drinking session beer. A nice change of pace from the sweeter bottled brews I associate with the style."
"D: Interesting but, as I jotted down in my notebook, underwhelming."
"Recommended..."
"Overall, I thought this was a pretty solid brew. I've read a lot of people becoming annoyed with the product after all of the advertisement. However, I have to say that this is definitely a different brew than the bottle conditioned Duvel, and deserves praise as such. Good stuff, and definitely check it out!"
"Happy to find this one on tap at the Dive Bar at 96th and Amsterdam , NYC, NY. Pours bright, clear and light glowing glowing amber. White tiny bubble head, and then leaving high quality, intricate lace. Grassy nose, with a mild hit of Belgian yeast funk. Lighter in color, flavor and character then the well know bottled version. Great as an accompaniment for light fare, tasty, crisp and clean on the palate. Belgian sessioner?"
"Not blowing my socks off. And for $10 a tulip? Psssh. Smokin' something are we? Word on the NYC streets is that you have to agree to take this beer on for 6 months in order to get it. If I owned or managed a bar, I would not want this beer taking up a line for 6 months. If Duvel is trying to work their way into the more mainstream market, this is the wrong beer to do it with IMO. Hopefully for their sakes I'm wrong."
