"O: The thin body might not have been so objectionable if the flavor profile had been more notable. I'd have this again, but I wouldn't go to a lot of trouble to seek it out. Not one of Unibroue's better offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy iced tea with a thin head.  Light worty malt smell hidden under medicinal house yeast phenols.  Flavor: caramel amber ale base with spicy yeast - big on apricot and coriander.  Medium body and tiny stinging bubbles.  Decent beer overall."

"O: Surprised in a great way! Wasn't expecting such powerful flavor from a lower ABV beer (when will I learn?), but I got great, clearly presented, and natural flavors. Unibroue captures my heart again."

"I remember buying one of those Unibroue mixed packs a few years ago in order to try this stuff.  It's been a while, so let's give it another go, eh?  It pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly off-cream foam.  The nose comprises light Band-Aid, Belgian yeast, a twinge of dry maple syrup, and light biscuit.  The taste brings in more of the same, with some light orange zest and a richer, less phenolic smoke (though it's still pretty mild in the grand scheme of this glass's things).  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a solid, lightly-smoked BPA.  Good times as usual from Unibroue."

"Well this one was pretty much nothing like advertised on its label. It's rather light, refreshing and quaffable. Not really full bodied per say and hardly leaves an aftertaste. More importantly if you pick this up because you expect a smokey or whiskey like flavor you will be sorely disappointed as I don't detect those flavors at all. It tastes like a Belgian pale ale. Got a bit of that yeasty funk, floral and spicy notes like coriander or clove. Banana, bubblegum. It's session able and would make a great summertime brew. Picked this up in the bargain bin for $3 and its still in date and all. Nothing extrodinary but just drinkable, refreshing, and has a decent amount of flavor without being extremely complex. For what it is its quite good. I give it about the same rating it currently has going for it...87"

"O- Overall this is a pretty nice beer.  Very complex, especially as it warms.  Although it is complex it is still very light bodied and drinkable.  Another great brew from Unibroue"

"So overall would I recommend it ? For sure. Easy drinking beer. Similar taste and look as the Hoegaarden. Nice combination while eating a smoked meat. But as a regular beer there is nothing to spectacular. I enjoyed more than Hoegaarden than this one. But hey good job Unibroue !"
""
"Extremely good."

"3.25 D:  It's a nice every day beer."
""
"Yeasty (of course. Its ""on Lees""). mild banana ester, followed by bready malt. Then a little splash of spicy grass (hops i suppose), followed by a tiny bit of roast caramel.  Nice and carbonated, but not too thin & bubbly.  A pretty damn well-balanced drinkable, and classy beer."
""
""
"O: Simple and refreshing. Thats what makes this one so good. Not super complex but does enough things very well that you want to drink it again."
"Overall:  Great, refreshing brew from my favorite Canadians, eh."

"Aroma and taste are strong a nd nice.  Belgian yeast and light fruit (apples and pears). Good balance between the yeast flavor and the sweetness from the fruit.  Mouthfeel is rich for a 5.5 beer.  VEry good Belgian Pale Ale."

"O: Probably the best belgian pale ale that I've tried. And since its not imported from overseas, it was much cheaper than the other comparable belgians. Give it a shot."
"This beer is inoffensive, but that's no good reason to drink it."
""
""
""
"D: This was a decent Belgian ale, but the scent and taste were really simplistic. It didn't have any unique character like I hoped. The body was a little weak too, but the finish was pretty smooth, so it wasn't difficult to drink. Meh."
""
""
"Overall – Now don’t get me wrong. This is a good brew, but it falls a little short of the other Unibroue beers I have had thus far. Certainly a worthy beer to take down (as it really does out compete most in the class) although I feel my expectations were a bit too high and hence I was slightly disappointed."

"O: A 5.5% full of flavor and as usual , a great belgian yeastiness showing a wide spectrum of flavors. Unibroue never disappoints, they are the western worlds answer to Belgium beer."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/6/2016. Pours lightly hazy deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of apricot, peach, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 5.5%. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian pale ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"A complex, light-bodied and low alcohol offering from, IMHO, one of the best breweries in Canada. I can see drinking several of these in a bar or restaurant, without getting drunk."

"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and very subtle smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, earth, fruit, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smoked malt supposedly used in this one is almost non-existent in the smell or taste."
""

"O- Been waiting a long time to get a chance to try this and finally it landed on some shelves near me. Great stuff. While Unibroue doesn't have a whole lot of variance in their ales, it can sometimes be a good thing since you know it's going to have delightful Belgian-style flavors every time. I wouldn't really call it being consistent, I would call it being dependable. Oh and, as others have stated in previous reviews, I found absolutely no whiskey or smoke notes in the beer from start to finish which is fine by me."
""
"Poured a dark orange body with decent head and minor lace. Aroma is spicy with hint of whiskey and bourbon as well as some Belgian yeast and hints of tropical fruits and earthy hops. Beer is light to medium bodied, smooth from yeast as well a little oakiness, there are hints of candi sugar and tropical fruit sweetness and these flavors are balanced for an easy drinking beer. Finish is complemented by slight alcohol bite (the whiskey) and some peppery spices."
""
"Outstanding Belgian pale ale with smooth but full malt taste and texture and some restrained banana yeast notes. Only disappointment was I was expecting more of the smoked whiskey notes on the malt, but that had more to do with my expectations. The subtlety could easily be viewed as a positive as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: With all of the banana flavors from the yeast, this beer seemed like a cross between a Hefeweizen and a Belgian Pale Ale."
"O: I wish the whiskey-like flavors and aromas were slightly more present than they are in this beer. This is a really nice and enjoyable brew with a very traditional Belgian profile."
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
"If there's whiskey in this it is well-masked. But I am not complaining because the taste is heavenly with its toasted Belgian maltiness, yeast, brown sugar, honey (maybe), and low bitterness at the end. Delightful all around. It deserves the high ratings it is getting."

"A full favour Belgian pale ale build on that strong Unibroue yeast."

"Poured from a 355 ml bottle. Pours a orangish yellow with amber or brown highlights. Nose is dried fruit, smoked meat and spice. Similar notes on the palate, but tastes a bit like a smoked witbier. Hearty and medium bodied with excellent carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange-amber with a small amount of quick-breaking head. Aroma is very malty, like cornbread with hints of caramel and light smoke. Yeasty. Some pear and apple fruity notes as well. Palate is quite similar, with sweet corn and caramel flavors, a tinge of smoke but no scotch ale in this regard, dry husks, pears and apples, maybe a touch of banana. Vanilla and some coriander or other mild citrus spice. All in all a fairly unique Belgian pale with Unibroue character. One of the more difficult Unibroues to track down, at least in these parts. Perhaps a bit undercarbonated. Finish is persistent, sweet and mildly acidic. Worthwhile and I am tempted to provide higher ratings."
"O: this was the elusive unibroue beer for me...one of only two of their regular brews that I hadn't tried. I have to say I like it pretty well, though I am a little suspicious that I may have a bad bottle on my hands."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A middle of the road BPA, not bad, not great. I'd choose most all other Unibroue beers over this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In all truthfulness, this is my favorite of their beers. I mean, it is a beer that has a solid gimmick (brewed with whiskey malt because lumberjacks were fans of the old ""beer and a shot"") and pulls it off. The beer is actually better for it. It is the most 'different' in comparison to their other beers (that I have had, obviously), but is not to be missed."
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm not a huge Belgian guy nor whisky guy, but this is interesting nonetheless. The whisky and smoke flavours are pretty subtle. Smell was't all that distinct from other Unibroue. Surprisingly, this is only 5.5%, making it near sessionable territory. I would drink this again, probably wouldn't pick it over some other Unibroue's though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite BPA. Nothing outstanding about it, I just really enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly hazy orangey-brown colour, one finger of white head and some lace on the glass. Smell is a nice mix of belgian yeast, fruit and dark sugars, a bit of smokey malt comes across as well, well spiced as well. Taste is quite yeasty, with a good amount of spice, bits of banana and bubble gum, some ripe fruit flavours, light sweetness with a spicy finish. Medium-hig carbonation, on the lighter end of medium bodied, decent overall feel. Solid and really drinkable, like that this has a low ABV, something I could drink a few of in one sitting for sure."
""
""
"This one is pretty easy to drink and the character is good. Ripe fruit on this one with the dark ale character you'd expect. Was surprised to see it on tap and glad to be able to try it."
""
"Had this on tap at Gigs in London. They listed it as a smoked ale but I didn't detect too much in smoke flavours. It definately has the typical Unibroue Belgian yeast taste to this, but its not as strong as the other beers in their lineup. Theres some spiceyness in the taste with faint fruit flavours like apple and grapes in there as well. Definately another quality belgian brew from Unibroue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Overall, pretty tasty. Not what I was expecting. To me, this is a modified hefeweizen."
""
""
""
"Medium to light feel with a modest level of carbonation. Light and easy drinking. This reminds me of a light dubble but with more depth. The alcohol was well integrated, this is something I wouldnt mind having again sometime."
""
""
"O: Overall it's smooth but refreshing, bubbly but can be taken seriously. The flavours run from crisp fruits to smooth butter to a dry finish. At first I didn't like this Unibroue as much as the others, but on second tasting I'm finding it more complex and interesting. Definitely worth a second try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice Belgian pale ale by Unibroue. The warm spice palate is very well balanced with the other flavours and does not overpower the beer. Smooth and refreshing. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"The smoked malt in this is extremely subtle; I have a feeling this is for the best given their characterful house yeast and the fact that it is peat smoked malt, but I still feel like I am missing out on a more pungent smoke character. Interestingly enough the house yeast dominates the profile of this beer, so if you like that, then this beer is pretty enjoyable; I just wish something else came through a bit more."
""
"Big yeasty and fruity aromas- apricots, candied apples- with light woody and peppery background notes. The peppery presence comes to life afloat abundant carbonation, cutting through a robust malty mix of honey, toasty, toffee and caramel. Yeast and tangy fruit abound. It's quite complex; a sipper, really, even at this modest ABV. Quite satisfying."
""
""
"Hazy copper body with a big fluffy white head that laces well. Tons of Belgian esters on the nose along with pepper and apple juice. The body is spicy with an odd numbing aftertaste on the tongue. The lack of smokiness is distressing to me, as I was hoping for a stronger presence. Even knowing that it's there, I find it hard to discern. A real nice belgian beer, but sadly not what I thought it would be."
"O- The beer itself was good but I'm not really sure what style it fits in. I guess BPA is the most suitable. There's no trace of the smoked malt whiskey. This might be Unibroue's most drinkable beer."
""
"On tap and poured into jar-like pint at Chuck’s 85th. Aroma is enjoyable. It smells somewhat close to a wheat beer. Mild sweetness. Appearance was murky, honey blond with minimal head. Taste was great at first, but sort of just fades away to something a bit bland. There’s nothing overpowering about this. Very slight bitterness, slight citrus, slight sweetness. It’s just all around a very subtle drink. Palate was smooth and bubbly. Very drinkable. Overall, it wasn’t anything special, but still worth trying at least."
""
""
"O - A tasty, easy drinking Belgian Pale Ale that would make for a great session beer from Unibroue. Would be nice to be able to get 6-ers of this. Definitely worth a grab and will certainly quench your thirst."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent brew. Pretty tasty, though maybe not the most drinkable (to be frank, I think it could have taken a higher ABV). I like having it with greasy and gravy soaked food."
"Unibroue never fails to impress, refreshing to drink and good blend of fruits and flavors. Would definitely recommend picking up a bottle or case."
""

"O: Very refreshing and drinkable Belgian Pale Ale."

"On tap last night at Meadhall in Cambridge. Served in a Unibroue tulip glass. Hazy orange colored body, with a creamy white head. Minimal lacing. Smell was a bit sugary and earthy. Taste was good, as I enjoyed the balance between the sweet malt and the tart Belgian yeast. The one thing that let me down was the real absence of the smoked character that I was looking for. The beer promises smoked malt, but it's not upfront. Instead, it's hidden way back in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was smooth and easy to drink. Raftman was a great Belgian style pale ale, but I thought it let me down on the smoked aspect. A really smoky BPA sounds like a good idea, but this isn't it."

"O - its a big beer for sure, lots of Belgian character with pale ale accents, the whiskey malt is very subtle but a nice touch, merits a repeat purchase"
"85."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. I wish that the smokiness that was supposed to be present had shown up. That said, it's still a solid beer. It just isn't up to the standards of most other Unibroue beers."
"Overall Impression- Now I've had in bottle AND on-tap... This is a great brew from Unibroue and think their beers can't get any better. Cheers!"
"Drink- I havent seen this around to much down here so when a 750 got busted out, was happy to try it."
"Over all, a very solid effort. One I would pair with savory leek and pumpkin crostade with rip cheese and pomegranate."
"o - Overall a good beer, but not Unibroue's best. Next time I would just stick with one of their other offerings."
"D: Not up there amongst my favourite Unibroue offerings, but a solid belgian pale ale nonetheless. I find this as more of a refreshing BPA with the citrus focus and higher carbonation. Worth a try."
"O- There are some nice ester characters with a good wheat and caramel flavor. The Unibroue yeast profile is a nice compliment with some hints of hefeweizen and just enough smoke to make it interesting."
"O- not the best unibroue have to offer, but interesting and very nice. On the sweeter and maltier side, but works well with the fruity unibroue yeast. great beer."
"Notes: Highly drinkable for how malty, yeasty, and flavorful it is. Very deft. Nice mellow smoke character is appreciated, yet it remains a definite thirst quencher. Would have liked a bit more hop character, but otherwise a standout."
"For a while, I was seriously thinking that I would never be able to taste a Raftman. Seeing this on the beer menu and on-tap last night was a complete shock, and having it being so great helped make my night at 38 Degrees."
"A dusky hazed golden orange with a quickly fading white head. Nice lacing as I consume. Smell is super. A melange of light bananas, apricots, pepper, some soap, Belgian yeast, light toasted grains, smoke and earth. Taste follws suit with a lightly soapy front that flashes the fruits and spicy pepper on its way to a dry grainy malt core. It lingers forever with large amounts of toasted whole grains, a light dry sweetness and hint of lemon. More dry than bitter the hops are earthy and mild. Finish is long and complex with notes of cinnamon coming through as weel as more toasted malt, light smoke and earth. Feel is light, dry, and quenching. Mild prickliness is spot on for this beer. A real winner here. I would dare say Unibroue's equivalent to Orval. Dry and super complex, it goes down like a thirst quencher but demands to be savored and appreciated. Great beer. Too bad it is not availible in any quantities here or I would be stocking up."
"People are being real beer snobby with this one. get a grip!! It s amazing beer. It's good for girls!!! Refreshing and spicy! yay! This is a beer guys can introduce to their gfriends! An awsome entry into the world of belgium!!!! Unibroue fin du la monde is next!!!! Apologize for sp errors"
"This beer poured out as a cloudy looking copper color. The head was big and white at first, once it settles it leaves a few spots on top where the bubbles rise to the top of the beer. The smell is yeasty,and a little fruity. The flavor of the beer has a nice apple taste coming off of it. There is also a decent amount of spice in there too. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and is medium bodied. Overall a little different than a typical Belgian pale ale. The fruit sets it apart from the majority. Worth trying."
"A decent Belgian pale ale but lacking the right amount of carbonation. A tasty beer, but it could easily be improved."
"O: great beer on this warm summer night, approved by the male and female perspective."
"Overall: Pretty good. Raftman has a good range of tastes, a comparatively low level of alcohol, and a nice crisp effervescence."
"The body was crisp and dry. Drinkability was very good, I could easily have several of these brews. Overall, another nice job from what I consider to be the best brewery in Canadia."
"Overall this beer has the distinct Unibroue yeast character and some interesting malt flavors and a very restrained smoked flavor. It was enjoyable to drink but not my favorite."
"O: Surprised by this one. Turned out to be complex and interesting to drink. Sweetness didnt overwhelm me. Drank two and never wanted for anything."
"M: A chewy ale that hasn't shaken its sweet side. I was glad for the opportunity (it's been many years), however my rose-tinted din of my memory recalls more of a peaty presence."
"It's quite nice; I set the bar really high for Unibroue, and the description sounded ideal to my taste. It ended up not quite living up to my expectation in a bottle, but was better from a growler. Unibroue just doesn't disappoint."
"Nice enough beer, but nothing to really get excited about either. Also, as the beer warmed, and after a couple of sips of ruination, I did notice some light smoke and whiskey in this beer as well."
"750mL bottle. Pours a cloudy orange/brown color with minimal head and no lacing. Smell is of yeast, spices and fruits. Taste has the typical Unibroue yeast taste, spice, and malt. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. This is a good easy drinking beer, though I wish Unibroue would try using different yeast once in a while!"
"This log driver's waltz won't please the beer folks completely, but it still was a decent beer. A low ABV would make for a great session brew. It's of the kind I like to drink so it's hard to knock it, but when I see Unibroue's website describe Raftman as a ""a peat smoked whisky malt ale", I was expecting a great deal more than what was there."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Tart and slightly bitter. Unibroue yeast is present most definitely. I'm trying to distinguish fruits and such; but it jsut tastes like yeast."
"I'm not sure that this beer deserves the C-/below average rating that I gave it, but looking at the individual categories it's hard to rank anything higher than their current scores. An average beer, with less than average components; I still want to say it's slightly better than the sum of its parts. But if you're a big Unibroue or even Belgian fan, check it out for yourself and see what you think."
"Nice Ale...well worth seeking out or in my case, trading for"
"Decent tasting beer. It a smooth beer with an easy finish. I got a taste of pears, and you can definitely taste the yeast. This would be a good beer with dinner. A very light tasting beer, so if you are looking for something with a lot of flavor I would look elsewhere."
"T: Whiskey malt gives it kind of a rough edge but is slightly sweet and balances well with the yeast. No real bitterness to speak of. Kind of lost my interest by the end of it. Not bad though."
"Nice one finger head of rich off white foam, leaving a moderate clinging lace. Color is a 17 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is complex, aromas of peach, melon, wheat, and barley. Taste is much much good. Flavors of black pepper, honey, peach, melon, apricot, and a rich malt come through atop other complex flavors. Good creamy and full body in the mouth feel category. This is a good beer to sit and relax and watch the world go by."
"Notes - This is a beautifully balanced Belgian Pale Ale, the best I've had. Low ABV yet complex, I wish there were more beers like it. Once again, Unibroue makes a superior product. I just wish it were easier to find."
"I really like this but if it had a little more body and wasn't so carbonated it would be for me spectacular. It's a very good brew no question and I would have it again."
"The Rest: Body is medium with a lot of carbonation and drinkability is pretty good. This beer reminds me somewhat of a Saison, but with some nice sweet flavor that captures that whiskey profile well. Overall, I really enjoyed it."
"Overall a very good example of a Belgian pale ale but probably not something I would buy a six-pack of, even if it was available here."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass is this lovely beer from our friends at Unibroue. This beer boasts a beautiful honey colour and a luscious inch of spring fed, long lasting head. A good quarter inch of fluff sustains itself through the entirety of the drinking session. The nose is distinctly house Unibroue with Belgian yeasty undertones and a sweet, somewhat spicy aroma on top. Smells wild and inviting. The taste is fresh and light with spiced caramel apple skin and chalky yeast tones and some crusty breadiness. The use of whiskey malt does not show up as an overtly conspicuous component nor does it create a definite uniqueness beyond the other equally great Unibroue offerings. If it weren't noted upon the bottle, this ingredient would likely not be identified by most palates. ""Whiskey flavour"" is generally a product of whiskey barrels, and this brew is bottle fermented not barrel aged in whiskey casks. You can imagine it if you like. At any rate, this brew has a great flavour. The mouthfeel ranges in around medium with the ample carbonation lending itself to a great consistency. The drinkability is good as this brew flows smoothly and is without any offensive or overpowing elements in the flavour profile. As well, the alcohol content is within a moderate range that would allow for extended samplings without threat of inebriation. Well crafted."
"O - Malty and dark for a ""pale ale"". My rating increased by interest and complexity. Also mostly improved, compared to original rating, by aging in this bottle that was produced and purchased in 2011, and stored under refrigeration until Feb. 2013 -- ratings adjusted only partly in the direction of the recent aged bottle. Clearly another sample is needed :)"
"D - Very good. I would like another one."
"D - I could session this. Smokiness is nice and low but still noticable. When combined with the other elements it makes for a nice beer."
"Interesting and worth a shot."
"Drinkability - I am very happy i was able to try this beer and really enjoyed it. Nice tasting beer that offers the mouth so much, will find and stock again!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkabilty - Its decent and not that strong so you could enjoy 3-4 of these. It could use some more hops i feel but all in all its good for soemone that cant take la fin or trois for there strength."
"Drink - The beer kind of reminded me of a glass of ice tea; lots of sweetness and citrus bitterness. A nice beer that would happy to drink again."
"Purchased this bottle yesterday at Peluso in Montreal. Pours a hazy golden orange colour with thick white head. Really nice head retention with some mild lacing. Smells of Belgian yeast, banana and some citrusy hops. Nice bitterness in the taste, some mild sweetness as well. Very classic Belgian ale flavour. Nice full carbonation level. Only 10 more beers to review on the top 50 in Canada now."
"D - Not the best beer for Unibroue, but worth a punt."
"D - If this is really nearly ten years old, it's one of the best aging examples I've encountered. I'd be confident in aging other higher gravity Unibroue beers. Would like to try it fresh to compare next time I'm in Quebec."
"3/4/3/3/3"
"Feel is light and fizzy, faintly on the soda-watery side, but for this taste it's pretty good. This is a very lightly characterful beer with gentle flavour, light feel, and outwardly is a bit thin in character and feel, but it's firm and highly enjoyable with some hints of complexity lurking there. It's also a very quenching light beer with a different character from most light, quenching beers."
"The mouthfeel is a bit above medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, I thought the aroma was too spice dominated but the taste had some nice malty flavors to it. Enjoyable beer overall."
"This is a great intro Belgian."
"A solid white cap tops a hazy amber-blond body. Intensely spicy and sweet aroma. Clove, dark sugar, bubblegum, toast - very cloying. Similar on the palate, fruity and spicy, bubblegum and clove. Thin body, a little smokey and toasty toward the finish. The smell is off-putting, but it's decent otherwise."
"Very large head, im talking like 90% of the glass, off of a what i thought was a soft pour. Hopefully nothings wrong with it. After it cools its jets, you're left with a still sizeable head sitting on a hazy darker copper brew. Scent is sweet malt with a big dose of that belgian candy. Lots of different elements to the taste. Sweet malt, candy, spice, and a kind of ""musty," if thats even a word, taste. Theres a hint of whisky but nothing major. Its still a really good beer, so i cant tell if something is up with this bottle or not. If this is how its supposed to be, its good, not great."
"Nonetheless, the Raftman is thus an excellent beer if you are just introducing yourself to a new world of flavor, and it is also amazing for anyone looking for a great session beer. It would pair nicely with a wide range of foods from grilled or smoked meat, to earthy cheeses, spinach salads, nuts or even light vanilla cakes."
"D: Very nice brew! Great in the nose. Fades slightly on the palate. Lots of tannins on this brew. A perfect food beer."

"An unusual brew, rustic and not made to a particular style per se - reminds me of a superior home-brew really..."
"D: the pungency of the beer makes it an unlikely return for me."
"Drinkability - not a style I partake in often but this is a very good one. I particularily enjoyed its rich feel and robust toasty malt."
"Good mouthfeel but very good drinkability. Similarities to other unibroue offerings butstill very different."
"nothing too good, but pleasent"
"Drinkability> Really didn't care for this one."
"D: Tasty and, though mild, pretty complex. Very easy to drink except the carbonations makes it a bit filling."
"Pretty good, though not as complex as I had hoped for. Tasty enough, it's undeniably Unibroue. I'm glad I tried it, but it isn't a beer I would drink regularly."
"Very good offering from a very good brewery."
"Raftman pours with a generous tight eggshell-colored head, dissipating pretty quickly leaving little or no lacing behind. Made with whisky malt, this amber ale takes on the smoky fragrance and a hint of flavor of a nice highland Scotch trending to tart green apple and grass notes as it warms. That this beer is so crisp and lively on the tongue owes to the Belgian styles that Quebec's Unibroue is known for, a deadly combination if there ever was one. Luckily, Raftman is only 5.5% alcohol, making it a very sessionable brew."
"D - A bit on the thin side, both in feel and flavor, but a good overall brew and it finished easy enough. Refreshing."
"D: very easy to drink, good refreshing beer."
"Thin-tasting Belgian without a lot to distinguish it. It's not offensive, it's just not memorable or special. I like Belgians that are good food companions and this would fit that definition, but it lacks a distinct style it can call its own. I wonder if the Brothers have tasted this beer since they reviewed it 8 years ago."
"Pours with a kind of gross dark iced tea color and a surprisingly white head. I see some lees churning around in the standard Unibroue chunky fashion. It looks a little murky as I look through the glass. It has the nose of a traditional Belgian Abbey dubbel. Light and smooth with a hint of candi sugar. Faint malt, and complex yeasty smells. I smell sweet apples, grain husk, and a little acidity or tartness. It's a little dry smelling. The taste is very mellow and smooth. It doesn't have that citrus punch that most of Unibroue's beers have. Instead it has a sessionable ABV and a more subtle and tame style. The mouthfeel is very thick for the ABV because of the body being so full. The aftertaste shows a little bit of neutral hops that add an attempt at balance, but don't quite get there. This is definitely a predominantly malty beer, but doesn't wear on you like an english brown ale can with the sugary-sweet aftertaste some tend to have. I think I could have 3 of these."
"Very light body, moderate carbonation. Seems watery."
"Served into a mini--unibroue tulip at Unibroue's Fourquet Fourchette in Chambly. Unfiltered looking, golden body. Off-white head. Fruity, Belgianny, yeasty smell with green apples dominating. Some candi sugar/malty sweetness noted. Whisky malt used to create this delicious sweet malty taste. Particularly easy to drink."
"This is one drinkable beer, if it didn't smell so sweet you could easily dive into several in a row enjoyably."
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty sweet. There are some caramel notes to the beer and it finishes nicely. The body is good with some carbonation on the palate, overall its a pretty drinkable beer. Not my favorite beer by them but its solid. Yeah, highly drinkable but just an OK beer."
"Drinkability: Not as distinctive as I was expecting, this is still a nice lighter Belgian style ale"
"D: It's east to drink, not off putting in any sense, but it's very weak and doesn't live up to it's siblings."
"This is actually nice but it still falls into the Unibroue habit of being terribly middle of the road for me. It's like a poor man's Duvel, which is ironic because I'm pretty sure you can actually buy Duvel for less in Sydney. It's certainly loads better than la fin du monde though. I think Unibroue's reputation may be partly based on the fact it might be a good value alternative to Belgians in the US. Except over here it works out as costing about the same as Belgians."
"The mouth feel is incredibly creamy. and smooth. I like it but somehow I do not want to keep drinking it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of spices and fruits. Taste is good, a considerable amount of spices as well as some dark fruits. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"Perhaps this bottle of Raftman wasn't fresh (I can't decipher the freshness code on the bottle, but my guess would be it was bottled in may of 2009, at 5.5%, this probably doesnt age well) This was th efirst Unibroue product i've ever had where I have been less than impressed. I will give them a pass since everything else I've ever had has been outstanding. I'd even be willing to try this again providing it was fresh."
"The overall palate of this beer is real understated - mild, cask-like, and, I hesitate to say, watered down. The complete non-offensiveness makes it quite drinkable, like herbal tea. Make sure your palate is squeaky clean before trying this and perhaps you'll get more from it than I did. Not bad, but not exciting."
"mix of sprightly wheat malt/yeast character and less sprightly sweet maltiness. tastes darker than it looks, though its not heavy. quite complex, but not sure the complexity works all that well. certainly interesting and enjoyable, but one bottle is enough."
"Good drinkability. The sweet aspect takes it down a notch, but it's still an enjoyable beer to drink."
"D: Damned solid Belgian Pale Ale; I would expect nothing less from such a fine brewery as Unibroue."
"I'm wishing I had more then one of these but in the meantime I'll thank Moniker for the one I do have. Unibroue is one of my favorite breweries in Canada and I wish I could buy more of it out west. these beers are the best value in Alberta and I can't wait to go to Quebec and try the rest of the lineup"
"I can appreciate this as a well made beer but the style doesn't really rock my boat."
"Easy drinking"
"Overall, not a bad beer. It was good finally getting to drink this one. I didn't expect all the carbonation. The whiskey malt was subtle but it worked really well with this beer. I recommend this one."
"The combination of the effervescent carbonation and the sweet orange overtones balance well with the complexity of the smoked whisky malt to make an enjoyable pale ale. More complex than most of it's kind, it was almost a littel too sweet for my tastes, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Smooth, light, well carbonated. Easy to drink, but there are things I'd rather drink instead. Not bad, and some may really take to the beer. Good beer, but not my fav."
"A very good Belgian (not very) pale ale. Impressive complexity for the modest (5.5%) alcohol content, though bordering on over-sweet. The smoked whisky malt is an interesting ingredient, though I wonder how many drinkers could tell it was smoked if they weren't told - I'm not sure I could."
"I really enjoyed this; it's cool to see something with recognizable traits of a style that have been stretched in different directions to make something unique. Don't really detect anything whisky-ish about it, but machts nicht."
"EDIT: Let it warm up too room temp hoping to get more flavour. Nope. Really too much water in this. Disappointing but I stand by the rest of my review and rating."
"Overall a very unique and subtle flavorful Belgian style pale ale. I do appreciate the nuance of ever-so-slightly smoked malts, but the spiciness and tartness is what floats my boat. As the beer warms, a bitter nutty (walnut?)flavor is brought out. Complex and delicate with a dry, chalky & clean finish. I do like this beer very much."
"Value: A little overpriced considering some domestic versions of a Belgian ale that are better and cheaper. (Pranqster)"
"Smooth with a medium effervescence. Medium-full body. Notes of spice in aftertaste mostly (clove and cinnamon). Another solid brew from the folks at Unibroue but slightly less than the other offerings of theirs I've had."
"Raftman is plenty easy to drink with a refreshing tartness and sufficient flavour to appease me. It simply lacks the smokiness I expected."
"As far as drinkability goes - this is a highly drinkable brew. Very pleasant to drink, easy going and tasty. Not a ""big"" brew by any stretch, but has enough balls to make me want about a dozen more of these..."
"I got a spicy aroma of apples with a sour hint to it. The taste was a little bit of the same spice and to me tasted like a really light version of scotch ale. It was very thin in the mouth and overall I thought it was okay but probably won't taste this one again for some time."
"Overall this is pretty fantastic. Flavorful, enjoyable,and very light, this is easy to drink over an extended period of time."
"This brew is light drinking, but not in a bad way. Very sessionable brew. The only strike against is the lack of a good head/lace. Another fine brew from Unibroue."
"D: Could be a long session beer due to the low alcohol (5.5%) and light flavors."
"D: This beer is light and goes down easily. The evolving flavors kept me going back for more. A very nice beer."
"Great atmosphere. Really impressive appearance in the right glass. Nose is full and lightly complex. Flavor is simpler, but a nice combination of malt and sweet. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"A great brew!"
"Raftman is just delicious. Pours a cloudy amber color and has a yeasty/wheaty aroma that is just excellent. Palette is like a bourbon, likely from the whisky malt, very bubbly. There is a whisky flavor in the background that makes it quite warming. But it is not very strong, it just adds to the character. Very smooth, and a little but very pleasant aftertaste."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. A hazy amber in appearance, it has a big, sticky white head. The nose is a bit light, toasted grains, sweet notes. The flavors of caramel, and vanilla dominate, lingering sweet finish. The body of this beer is light and flavorful, making it almost too easy to drink."
"The mouth is medium to light bodied with aggressive carbonation. All of these result in quite the drinkable package. I will be trying it again soon."
"Taste - Cherry vanilla for some reason comes to mind. Tangy, sweet and malty. As it tails off, there is bitterness but very mild and then a crisp finish. Refressing and drinkable. I could buy a six-pack of these and watch the Maple Leafs play on the CBC."
"Pours a murky, muddy brown color with a nice head that settles to about a finger width. Richly aromatic with a nose of tart fruit, brown sugar, and funky yeast. The flavor is a little less prominent than the nose suggested. Good body, medium weight with nice acidity and very low tannins/hops. Overall a very good brew on the mellow side for this brewery. A good addition to the lineup!"
"Poured a cloudy medium brown into a snifter, with a finger of white head and good lacing. Smelled woody, roasted malty, nutty, sour plum, and tart cherry. The flavor yielded more tart cherry, brown sugar, vanilla, and smokiness than what was implied by the aroma, but the feel was very thin. I appreciate what the U-brew crew was trying to accomplish with this beer, but the smoky/roasted tart sweetness didn't wow me as much as I thought it would."
"This was a nice little find at the bottle shop. A beer with a complex malt profile and an assertive floral hoppyness."
"Pours an extremely hazy brown. So opaque I can't see moving objects through the glass. The smell reminds me of any other unibroue produc. The taste is great. Reminds me of La Fin du Monde Light. The lower abv makes this a unibroue product with similar quality to La Fin or Maudite but without the higher abv. Love this and would definitely get it again."
"This is a treat."
"D - The smoked malt is really very light and adds a nice dimension to the beer."
"Poured a medium brown with a moderate head that rapidly dissipated to a collar. The aroma was musty, like an old attic. The taste was sour cherries. Later, I got a more traditional fruity taste, sweeter. The feel was light to medium bodied, with a lot carbonation. Drinkability was good. OK, not one of my favorite Belgians."
"D: Good, tasty. But this doesn't stand out from any of their other offerings. Yummy for sure, but if I had one Unibroue beer to pick, it wouldn't be this one."
"A big thanks to terryeckmeier for the bottle!"
"The bottom line: As I've said before, I think Unibroue is a victim of their own success. In a pure vacuum, almost all of their beers are solid, but because they brew in a fairly rigid style, the brews all compete with each other. Raftman is a nice light offering. I think they are overplaying the use of whisky malts though, as a single malt fan, I expect a more aggressive flavour when the whisky tie-in is featured so prominently. This isn't a bad beer by any means though and I'm still flummoxed as to why it's the one standard offering that isn't available in the US except in the odd little variety pack that has the Chambly beers and an Ephemere. One thing I'll definitely give this beer in parting: exceptional for only 5.5 ABV, and that alone would probably be enough to make it a semi-regular in my glass if it was just available in 4/6 packs in the States."
"Not a bad beer, moderatly drinkable but by no means great."
"Drinkability: Very good beer that is easy to drink and would be good for any occasion."
"Don't drink and review."
"This is a deserving brew, and I hope that it doesn't continue to be underrated."
"Overall, another solid brew from Unibroue. Leaves me anxious to try more of their stuff."
"I'd been looking forward to trying this beer for some time. Unibroue again doesn't disappoint, although it's somewhat upsetting that I lay my hands on a bottle just as Unibroue cuts its Australian supply. Ah well."
"D: Pretty good, but their are better hefes or witbiers out there that are similar yet better."
"D: Light, spicy and semi refreshing. No lingering aftertaste and low alcohol. Pretty easy drinker."
"Interesting, but not my cup of tea (or beer)."
"This is a good strat to a session beer. I wouldn't drink these all night but a good flavorful starter."
"D - very drinkable, balanced, smooth and complex. This is a great beer and one of my first Belgian Pale Ales, excellent."
"Beer poured amber orange with a decent white head. Nose is malty with hints of spices. Taste is classic Belgian yeast strain, hints of lemon, peppery finish is primary with hops taking a back seat. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, the beer glides gracefully across the palate in classic belgian style. This is quite the drinkable beer, light but somewhat complex. Would definitely try this beer again."
"d-very easy drinking Belgian style with a bitter spice finish. Very balanced."
"Drinkability: while it is a little to thick to be a session beer for me, its flavor and its nice wheat refreshing factor really help drinkability."
"This can be a drinkable beer. The low ABV is nice but the strong acidity is a bit off-putting."
"Overall this is a really good beer. All of it's characteristics are subtle, and you could spend some quality time hunting out the flavors and aromas. Very nice!"
"This is a supremely drinkable beer: balanced and complex, a lot of great flavours, very clean finish. In the Unibroue universe this is a dwarf, but it's clearly standing on the shoulders of its gargantuan brethren."
"An interesting enough ode to those in Quebec's history who adhered to the 'one whisky, one beer' policy that I'm also quite fond of. The whisky malt does well to make indeterminate appearances throughout this beer, and overall, it's a unique and approachable offering from Unibroue - a smoked Belgian Pale Ale."
"Not a bad beer at all. I'll definately have to get more of these."
"The beer has definitely calmed down and as it warms and there is a little more of the whisky/alcohol taste coming through."
"This is an alright beer. Drinkable but not one I would actively seek out. The smell, taste and feel are all too light for me. I'm giving it an extra 0.5 because the light smokiness is kind of cool. It's the only other Unibroue besides Ephemere I've had which weighs in at 5.5%. I guess I'm just a strong beer kind of guy."
"While I am not completely blown away by this, there's really little that is wrong with it other than the lack of head, but it doesn't taste flat like a lot of headless beers can, so really, that's just nitpicking."
"Medium bodied but with a bit more carbonation than I would have liked. The initial mouthfeel seemed way too bubbly but altogether it was still quite refreshing. This came from a Unibroue 4-pack sampler and I can say that this was my personal favorite of the bunch. I won't be picking up another sampler set just for this one but Raftman was a nice note to finish on and I am glad I got to try it at least once."
"Drinkability: Quite high. This beer is super-flavorful, not especially heavy and only has an ABV 5.5% - really hard to go wrong with this. It's great on a warm summer day and I'm sure it'd be nice on a cold winter night as well."
"This is a pleasantly light and flavourful beer, goes down smoothly and is quite refreshing. A very nice beer at any time of year."
"This is strongly suggested for a go-to day to day beer. A good beer to have as a replacement of yellow fizzy beer."
"D - This was a very interesting beer, pretty good, not something I would like to have a lot of, but something good"
"overall a decent brew tastes good but lacking in the appearance."
"Drinkability- Pretty tasty and well-balanced. Nice complexity."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a thick off-white head. There is a good amount of lacing down the glass. Aromas are of belgian yeast, clove spice, with a slight woody malty aroma, a fruitiness and a little bit of funk. Initial flavor is sweet, tangy, yeasty and full of cinammon clove spice. This inital flavor gives way to a more intense tang (citrus and sometimes a stronger almost metallic tang) with a more pronounced funk and somewhat fruity finish. I don't think the funk was parmesan cheese or stinky foot, but maybe a funky distant cousin of those two, if that makes any sense. Mouthfeel is actually very good....smooth and the higher carbonation really compliments the beer. Drinkability is good, but the clove spice might get a little old after a while."
"Drinkability: A little bit too light and simple for my taste in the style. After one, I am ready to move on to something else, although it is not really dissatisfying."
"Overall a fine Belgian PA."
"(D)- These could be put away one after another no problem. Its super light & refreshing and fruity. Its 5.5% is totally tolerable. However, where is the pale ale aspect this claims to be? Its got the Belgian style down fine."
"Drinkability: Very good. I love the lightly flavored beer with their Belgian yeast strain. It makes for a great drinker."
"M + D: Sparkling, medium body with a bit of a dry champagne finish. A very robust flavoured beer with a more accessible alcohol content... I can go for that! A very nicely balanced brew, and one that I'm glad to have taken the opportunity to try. You should, too!"
"Drinkability: Could definitely have another. I could see this pairing well with some pork ribs or any other smoked BBQ."
"Mouthfeel was effervescent, and light to medium in body. No my favorite from this brewery."
"Very interesting brew."
"Overall: To me this is more of a quaffer than a sipper (as I think of most UB's as being) so I'm really having to restrain myself with this one-offer. In all, I'm really not quite sure what to do with it (well, other than - duh - drink it!) since it's so different from the rest of their lineup. Something about it almost drinks like a rye ale (but when I ponder the Canadian --> whisky --> rye connexion, it almost makes sense). It really perks up with food! Try a good fresh fish or smoked/smoky meat. This would be a great counterfoil to smoked sausages when you don't want a Rauchbier. It also sits up and converses with roasted asparagus, and even spaghetti and meatballs isn't out of the question."
"Really glad to see this one back on the shelves here in PA. I remember seeing this a few years ago at a bottle shop, but passed it up since the bottle was covered in dust and the best by date had been blatantly scratched off. A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Craft Ale House to-go for around $3. Poured into my nonic pint glass and after stirring up the yummies on the bottom of the bottle, appears a rather cloudy and murky honeyed apricot color with about two fingers of quickly fading, off white head. Nose consists of lightly smoked grains and is sweet and fruity. Flavor is of smoked green apples, spicy yeast, a touch of cracked pepper at the end. This Belgian pale is at the very least, medium bodied with and very well carbonated. Super dry going into the finish. Nice!"
"I found this beer very underwhelming. I just didn't get a lot of flavor here. This is probably my least favorite Unibroue beer. You really have to search your palate to get any nice flavors to come out here. I am no expert on Belgian ales, but I have had enough to know that they pack more flavor punch than this. If you see it give it a try, but don't expect it to rock your world."
"D - Has decent drinkability. Being one of the lighter Unibroue beers, Raftman certainly stands well for its ABV."
"Easy to drink - this is no monster ABV which restricts the drinkability, a fine beer from one of the worlds great beer makers."
"Notes: I was told (by an employee at World Wines & Liquor in Mentor) that the only way to get this is in the sampler pack. Well, she said that they do not make the raftman in the 750ML bottles anyway. I would love to find 4 or 6 packs of it. It is at the same time a session beer and a fine craft beer. Everyone reading this should try the Raftman. If not, BM me and I will take it off of your hands. This is my favorite Belgian Pale Ale."
"D - The light, yet rich flavor makes this a must drink. The whiskey malt gives it such a unique flavor. Must try, will definitely drink again!"
"A very smooth-drinking beer altogether. I'd like to review it again and take better notes as there was some stuff I wasn't recognizing in the aroma & taste."
"Raftman Ale is much less robust and thinner than other Unibroue beers I have had - very east to drink ale."
"Tastes of some dried apricot and grainy, toasty malt. Mild smoke. Mouthfeel is super fizzy and grainy."
"D- An excellent easy drinking ale, I could drink quite a few of these."
"Pours a nice orangey amber with a great initial head, about 3 fingers worth after an easy pour that settles down to a medium cap. No lacing. Very light aromas of some pale malt, a touch of sweet banana from some yeast esters, a bit of wood, and the tiniest bit of whiskey. The whiskey taste very slowly comes out in the flavor on the back end, after some more sweet banana and fairly firm, cookie-like malt. Somewhat thin like many of the Unibroue beers, and quite carbonated. The light sweetness, firm malt, soem minerality, and hint of whiskey blend well. This is pleasant and a nice sipper for the porch in early spring."
"Eric"
"D-Moderate drinkabiltiy. It's an enjoyable beer, but not all that remarkable, especially when compared to the other offerings I've had from Unibroue."
"Future outlook: This was part of a mini-mix pack from Unibroue. As all of their offerings seem to be quite good, I can easily see getting this again in a similar package purchase."
"D= very high. I don't usually like belgians but this one was very nice maybe I'm learnig to respect the style more or maybe this one was just good."
"I don't know where to start. The color was a hazy medium to dark yellow, with an orange hue. Not much foam and no lace what so ever. The smell had a hint of spice carbination and no much else. The taste had way to much carbination, so much that it kind of masked any spice or fruit taste that might have been. So, to much sour carbination, not a pleasant after taste. This has to be the worst of all the Unibroue Ale I've tasted (12 in all)."
"Fast moving foam in the head, big on the pour, then recedes across the surface like waves on the shore, more yellow-brown in color than orange, just about the level of murkiness you'd expect from the beer style. Unpretentious nose of caramel/chocolate swirls, cinnamon buns and apricot, peach fruit and suggestion of banana, the lemon citrus semi-confectionary, gains steam with clove and allspice scents. Medium-bodied, while predictably smooth and creamy there's not much verve nor intensity to it. The clove, cinnamon spice is there, the banana, apricot, apple fruit same, there's even more thrust to the lemon, orange citrus. But it doesn't come together into a meaningful whole. The carbonation dulls it as well. Light white pepper and tea leaf flavors help. Unfortunately average."
"D- I actually found this on a whim and picked it up without ever seeing this brand in all my years of drinking good beer. I'm glad i picked it up and will again in the future. A great take on the Belgian Pale Ale style. Good job Unibroue."
"I had this on tap at C'est What in Toronto, served in a pint glass. The beer was dark orange and murky with a thick white frothy head. The smell was easy to peg as Unibroue with the characteristic yeasty esters, but a grassy or musky peatiness was there as well, unique to the other Unibroue beers. I got these flavors in the taste as well, a little mysterious but very tasty. The body is thick and full, very filling. I looked for a long time before finding this, and while the hunt was more fun than the kill this is still a worthwhile beer."
"Drank from a bottled beer poured into a glass. The only negative came as I was pouring the beer out of the bottle and the head errupted to the top of the glass. The color was a very good amber while the smell wasn't really distinct. The beer was very drinkable with a slight but pleasant spiced and smoky taste. One of the best BPA I've had in a while and would definately drink again."
"Mouth: Tastes like a regular BPA with a subtle smokiness. Same esters as in the aroma, with some coriander and a wisp of smoke. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated. Needs to breathe and effervesce for a while before it achieves any sort of drinkability. Decently dry."
"Recommended..."
"All in all, a pleasant drink. I would have welcomed a bit more of the smokey character, but it's definitely well executed and deliciously interesting. I could drink a few more, had I any more left. Definitely worth a try. Maybe underrated among the Unibroue brews, but this one ranks pretty high on my list."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that the more I drink it, the more I like it...It is complex and I could easily drink a six of it"
"Nice to see a lighter version of the more robust ales from Unibroue, yet I think I'd rather have a single La Fin Du Monde than two of these."
"Great mouthfeel, adds to the drinkability."
"D: drinkable- one after another"
"This is a great session beer for those who love your big belgian beers. It's got that big flavorful taste but a low abv so you can drink these all night"
"D: Aside from some mouthfeel problems, this is a pretty good ale. I liked the addition of the smoked whiskey malt, the flavour really enhanced what could have a been a pedestrian effort. Nice hybrid."
"Raftman pours a fizzy, clear amber with a diminishing off-white head that leaves fair lacing. The smell is fruity with apples and spicy with nutmeg, cloves and pepper. The flavor is earthy and sweetly doughy, while remaining light and very lively on the palate. There are some subtle smoky notes lingering throughout the beer that I can't really pin down. There is a light metallic note on the finish, but it's unobtrusive and overshadowed by a slight pucker of well-crafted bitterness. Raftman is my favorite light Unibroue beer, at the moment, and probably my third favorite of their normal rotation."
"I am not just being kind when I say it is unique. It's a one of a kind, and typical of a Belgian, it will put hair on your chest. Actually, I think this one (and lots of other Belgians) will actually cultivate hair all over. But drink it, don't rub it in."
"One of my first Unibroue beers I didnt love...Pours a murky tannish-orange with thick fluffy head. Good retention and lacing but kinda has this swamp water look to it. Just weird. Smell is stong of yeast and bread with a hint of smokiness which I was very glad to have in there, a bit of sweet fruit (apple) as well. Taset wa a little bland if you ask me. Perhaps I'm comparing it to their other offerings but nothing really jumps out. Dry malt and biscuit, yeast, some fruits, and some grass are all present. Mouthfeel was very creamy I though but due to extremely low carbonation it just seems a little flat. Overall not bad, but one of my least favorite Unibroue offerings."
"A very good tasting beer.. Very heavily carbonated and an interesting/sweet aftertaste, but the taste is what makes it great. A nice woodsy type of taste, I kind of want to say it is almost ""manly"" tasting. Hardy in a way and it's all well balanced and goes down smooth. Not the best Unibroue I've had but an above average beer for sure."
"Flavor is wonderful. Starts with rich spice and bleeds into some almost smoked and woody tones, slightly yeasty with hints of white pepper. Whiskey malts are obvious and and great dimensions. A rich balance with hints of soft vanilla and whisps of toffee. Super-carbonated--its fun to watch in the glass. In the mouth, light bodied but rich flavors mingle and end with a crisp dryness that says ""yes, I'll have another"" And yes, I'll have another. At 5.5% abv this is easily a beer to have several of."
"Pours a dark cloudy golden brown color with a huge foamy head. Aroma consists of light fruit such as apple, pear and banana as well as a slight maltiness. This beer has an interesting mix of crisp light fruit and whiskey malts. Carbonated with crisp center and dry whiskey-like finish."
"D - I love Unibroue and this is another of their great beers."
"Strange brew this. After checking out scores from others on here I reckon this is either a dud batch or it has been mistreated on the trip over - the tang on the finish just aint right. Good beer, but lacking serious omph! Prob the usual case of ""send the sh*t to the Aussie, keep the good gear at home!"" ;)"
"500th Review!!! Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a clear dark golden almost amber color with a soapy white head that quickly settled into a thick ring around the glass, not much lacing. The aroma is faint, there is some apple skin, canned pineapple juice, light Belgian yeast funk and candi sugar. The taste is of pale malt, with appropriate candi sugar sweetness, the yeast flavors are subdued but I get a mild tropical fruitiness (pineapple), touch of coriander and pepper. There a stale hop presence to round out the brew. The feel is light and fizzy, and finishes dry. A Unibroue brew that is unique from their other offerings. This beer knows its place and is a good compliment to the Unibroue lineup. Great beer for somebody that wants a nice light Belgian style beer without a lot of alcohol."
"Overall, I am a bit mixed. There seems to be subtle flavours that I wasn't able to pick out. I might have to pick up another for tasting."
"D: Very, very good. Quite enjoyable/sessionable!"
"The body is light and dry with a variety of light fruit, yeast based flavors. Toasty with some pepper and smoke. Touches of metallic graininess but not much. Peachy esters and lemony finish. Well balanced and quite drinkable."
"Verdict: Well crafted and lighter than other Unibroue beers I've had. Drinkable from the tap. Never seen it in bottles."
"Thanks to Matt for the sample."
"At first the taste wasn't something I saw myself enjoying, I even contimplated not finishing the glass, but after a few sips you sink right in, and although it's definately not a session beer, it's one easily enjoyed as a taster."
"d: not my cup of beer and would highly recommend most of unibroue's other beers over this one"
"Faint smoky malt flavor, rich texture to the mouthfeel, quite drinkable. A regular beer, but still very very delicious."
"Drinkability : bonne bière au malt de whisky brassée par Unibroue au Québec"
"Enjoyed last night at Pazzo's Pizza Pub, Lexington KY (a Pint Night offering). Don't think this beer is actually Belgian Pale, but it's quite a good beer, no matter the style. A very rusty colored, lightly viscous pour delivers a dainty head retention and light, creamy carbonation, which creame resists fading throughout. Moderate aromas of complex malts, aged hops, fruitiness, spicy esters, and a vineous, peat-ey / light smoke, musky scent sets the tone. A strong scent of metal and rust accompanies over-ripe fruits of peaches, dates, figs, grapes, pears, apricots, and mangos. Flavors hit on these same notes, but apply emphasis to a woodsy / musty character, a yeasty / bready flavor and texture; and strong, spicy / fruity esters. The textue is far lighter than the aroamas and flavors suggest; more Witbier-like than Belgian Pale. Very creamy textured, with light, powdery, cooling sensation. Alcohols remain light throughout. Waters a bit toward the end, but reamins very easy to drink."
"A bit on the dry side and rather smooth despite the carbonation... I'm not sure I'd want this all the time, but it seems pretty sessionable, easy to share, and interesting enough to be worth shaking things up. Reach for a bottle if you find one."
"Drinkability- Overall a very fine tasting brew. Was expecting much more smoke or super burnt malt characteristics though. I believe this used to be listed under the smoked beer catagory."
"Another great beer from Unibroue. A very good looking beer a light hazy orange/brown colour. The head is not that thick but it does last for the entirety of the beer. Malt and smokiness on the nose although the smokiness is subtle but more evident on the palate. The yeast character that I love so much is not as pronounced as it is in a Maudite or a Fin Du Monde but its still there none the less. A nice beer to enjoy while surfing the information beer way (aka BA)."
"Overall another solid brew from Unibroue. This brewery cannot be complimented enough for the quality and craftsmanship of their amazing line-up of spectacular beers. Tres bien!"
"Taste is at first of alcohol malt, that is quite harsh, followed by citrus flavours, spicness coriander etc.. which ends in a shy hoppy finish"
"D - Not impressed at all. Really lacks flavour and the most positive aspect I can draw from the beer is the aftertaste. A disappointment."
"Overall Impression: Enjoyable, but not what I was hoping for. My least favorite Unibroue so far."
"D = A little pricey for what you get. Better beers out there in this style."
"D: A bit thin in my opinion to be a belgian pale. The body didn't have the normal yeasty thickness to it. Not horrible, just not impressive."
"Easy to drink. Solid enough beer, but I have enjoyed others in the style a little more; althought, I really enjoyed the smoky characteristics of this beer. It would be easy to session, but I would rather have almost any of the unibroue brews."
"I used to find this beer rather enjoyable because of the pronounced whiskey in the flavour, but after revisiting recently those setiments were lost. Slightly spicy, malty and you do taste some whiskey malt but not as refined as it should be. In fact, any one who knows their whiskey would be disapointed Im sure. The focus on whiskey also distracts from a weak hop job and overall fuzzy make up of the beers body. Was not impressed"
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep copper with a rather small and rather fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell is yeasty, with come citrus and light fruits alongside a woody note and some spices that I can't quite put my finger on. Taste is full and robust, with plenty of malts. A bit of pepper and yeast sits next to the bright fruitiness and mild grainy flavour. Finish is dry, and a bit metallic. Mouthfeel is good, abundant carbonation and plenty of body, and drinkability is solid. Another nice belgian offering from Unibroue, I never expected anything less."
"The flavour started smoky before turning yeasty and sweet in the middle and finishing woody  think oak. I didn't pick up a ton of complexity, but it was pleasant nevertheless."
"While the complexity is huge, this certainly isn't the most intense of Belgians (or smoke ales, for that matter). Such a blend of flavor and accessibility makes this a great crossover beer, but even full on beer maniacs should find enough goodness here to keep themselves happy."
"D- A good ale. Moderate ABV and balanced flavour make this an easy beer to drink. One of the best Unibroue's for everyday drinking."
"M&D: softly-carbonated in texture, the body is just moderate and the flavour definitely evolves with that bit of smokiness melted in the overall flavour just nicely. Intriguingly the smokiness manifests itself more in line with smoked fruits than smoked malts, at least for me. My patience pays off, as the initially timid smokiness gradually tunes up, both on the aroma and the palate, and the finishing touch of smokiness is really rounded and nice, executed in a totally different way than Bamberg's smoked beer. The more I sip it, the more I like it. A little quiet beer worth probing with patience~~"
"An amazingly refreshing, drinkable, simple yet elegant and complex beer. It's hard to stop at just one. This would be a great beer to introduce a scotch drinker to the world of craft beer due to its wonderful whiskey malt character. It would also make a damn fine session brew, or even serve as a good introduction to the realm of craft beer due to its simple elegance. Yes i know im gushing, but i loved this beer."
"A top notch Canadian made Micro. Bravo. Pours out to a hazy pumpkin amber color with a 1/4 inch head of white foam and streams of bubbles racing toward the top. Nice. Aroma is slightly woody and smokey, but notes of fruity esters and grain are present as well. Taste is medium bodied and enjoyable; malt, wood, spicey grains, smoke. Definitive notes of light bready whisky on the finish. Quite nice. Dare I say this could easily be consumed on a cool, foggy morning? Mouthfeel is crisp and zesty, like many of it's brothers in the Unibroue line. Drinkability is above average. Quite nice. Special thanks goes out to Derek for the sample. Recommended."
"Pours a cloudy orange color, large foamy head, no lacing; Smell is sweet and smokey, some fruity aroma; Taste is smokey malt, sweet and yeasty; Mouthfeel is smooth, highly carbonated; Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Taste is earthy and grainy. Lightly smoky and woody. Hints of peat. Mouth is incredibly smooth. Lots of woodiness in the mouth and lightly sticky. Good stuff and certainly unique."
"D - Quite warming for some reason. Very drinkable and delicious."
"So, not a bad beer, but not meeting the expectations."
"Flavors in this beer are interesting. A strong malt character dominates, leaving an aftertaste of a fine whisky. This is an especially smooth brew that is very easy to drink. Delicate yet flavorful, a great beer."
"Code E105. White head and amberbrown beer that shows quiet some haze. Nose is ambermaltsweet that shows a slight hint of smokeyness and lots of sweetredapplejuice. Next to that low but strange sournote and gets more obvious in nose too that isn't bad but IMO not fitting the brew. Overall more then just OK but missing smoke as I just got some after quiet some snifs and sips. Taste is quiet dry, malty and moderatly bittered. Balanced mouthfeel and well drinkable but missing that bit extra."
"Thx."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I was prepared to award the mouthfeel a perfect ""5", because it was... at first. The dynamic energy in the beer waned as the session progressed, and after a while there was barely anything. I consider this to be a ""try me once"" sort of tasting, but I'm sure an enthusiastic foodie would find a place for this beer with food."
"D: Exceptional. I've consumed a few cases of this."
"While I like this beer, and it is good, it doesn't reach up over the top. I actually find that the whiskey character detracts a little from the beer, but atleast that distinguishes it from others in the Unibroue line up."
"The operative word here is mild. Large bottle, caged and corked. Openw with low energy and pours with fairly low carbonation, medium, tiny bubble, light tan head. Next to no lacing. Nose is mildly smokey, with hints of vanilla and oak. Subtle and sublime, more light smoke,mellon and oak picked up. Vanilla notes to smooth things along. Tasty and easy going sipper. Fine choice for light foods and of course, smoked meats/BBQ"
"Cloudy dark orange with a smallish white head that left some webbings of lace on the glass. Sweet fruity aroma with plenty of apples and pears. Very light smokiness with some yeast kicking around. Plenty of sweet fruits up front on the flavor with a light spicy yeast. Pretty simple and enjoyable flavor. Very bubbly with carbonation but smooth going down. Easy drinking stuff."
"Adding the massive amount of residual yeast turns the apricot color to that of unfiltered apple cider. The meade notes are also kicked way up in the smell. Surprisingly, the taste doesn't change all too much, nor does the mouthfeel. No real changes to my initial thoughts except a 0.5 bump in the appearance and the thought that at least I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of B-vitamins..."
"Not one of my favourite Unibroues, but not bad. I have another bottle I'll save for a month or two at least and sample again."
"carameled like bread crust; one of the unibroue gourmet beers; a canadian brewery it makes the things affluent; this beer is good for cheese, snack, like appetizer, a 750 ml presentation for mexican market, a whisky malt liquor, fruitty and smoked aroma; its high alcohol content is made for the expert drinker."
"Taste: One of the smoothest brews Unibroue makes, lactic and yeasty. Maybe it's my palate that changed, but I recall it being a lot more malty a few years ago. An enjoyable, any-occasion brew."
"Pours a cloudy orange/amber, small head, no lacing. Smell is sweet and smokey, some floral and citrus notes. Taste is smokey malt, sweet, yeasty as almost all Unibroues are, some citrus and light fruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, highly carbonated, medium body, nice and refreshing."
"Hazy yellow, with hints of red. Malts and a particular kind of yeast aroma... an unmistakable Unibroue trait. Tastes of yeast, and toasted malt too, with some sour notes. The finish is a bit unusual, with sour notes intermingled with wet cedar and bran. I don't really detect any smoke, but I still enjoyed it in an odd sort of way."
"Juicy upfront followed by an acidic twang. Slight smoke follows. Carbonation gives the finish some tingle. Not much else going on, not impressed. The mouthfeel is light, almost watery. Drinkable but boring."
"A good beer, but not impressive by Unibroue standards. I have had this twice on draft in the past, once being at Forquet Forchette, and I will say that the bottled version, while not amazing, is definitely better."
"Delicious."
"Mouthfeel is little heavier then light has a nice carbonated feel to it, over all compliments the flavors well. Drinkability is good taste like a belgian pale with some smokiness a thrown in."
"This is a beer I could certainly spend some time with. It is subtle. No big single flavour to overpower, no huge alcohol level, no gimmick. All that is here is a well crafted beer. A treat for sure."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a rush of tight carbonation and a soft body...easily flows over the palate. I'm enjoying this bottle and I'd imagine I could drink another if I had it. An interesting brew for sure...hopefully Unibroue brings this back into rotation. Bottle says best by 04-04-03...about 2 years past and still damn tasty!"
"Very drinkable, very tasty, very good."
"Wow, what a head on this one. Pours with a huge frothy head that took a few times to mellow out a bit. Color is a nice orange color with streams of tiny bubbles coming through. Aroma is lightly smoky, I'd go for a bit more here. Flavor is good and approachable for a smoked beer. Not over the top, yet good. Smooth malts and some flavor of ripe plums come to mind. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. For a smoked beer, this is very drinkable. A good one from Unibroue. Not earthshattering, but good."
"I wish I could find this one more often, but fine imported beers are not easy to find in my town."
"Not being the biggest fan of smoked beers, I poured some of this into a pot of chili I was making. The chili tasted fantastic with it, but I almost wished I had saved some more of it for drinking rather than for the chili. Really surprised by how much I liked this beer. Definitely unique and worth a try."
"Pours hazy dark amber with a reasonable large bubble head to start which fairly quickly falls away. Aroma in my case was very attenuated, hard to pick anything in particular out. All I could taste with the first sip was smoke - if you could liquify a bushfire this would be it. Sure there were other flavours present, but I couldn't get past the smoke, which lingered for a long time in the aftertaste. Shouldn't be surprised of a smoky taste in a Smoked Beer style, however this lacked balance. The most disappointing of the Unibroues I have encounted so far. May need to come back and re-rate this as I experience more of this style."
"12 oz bottle courtesy of fellow Kentucky BAs, clvand0 and kmpitz2. I've never seen Raftman in a store anywhere, so have no clue where this one originated. ""Best before 04-04-03", sampled Feb 19, 2005. Pours a hazy, apricot body with a small offwhite head that retains for a few minutes. Sporadic film, patch, and some sheet lace noted. Aroma has tropical fruits, clove, white pepper, and some campfire smoke. Mouthfeel has a light medium body and some subdued effervescent carbonation. Taste is similar to other Unibroue Belgian pale ale stylings. Tropical fruit sweetness, spicy coriander and white pepper, and balancing bitterness from the hops and yeast. There is a noticeable smoked beef jerky component that comes from the use of lightly smoked whisky malts. Finish is clean and evenly balanced. Good drinkability from this Unibroue, even though it is apparently past its prime. The smoked malt character reminds me a bit of Germany's Bamberg smoked beers. Very interesting departure from Unibroue's always interesting line."
"I've heard unconfirmed rumors Unibroue is no longer producing Raftman. I hope that is not true. This beer reminds me of a Belgian pale, but without the strong spicy kick. It's a well balanced delicious brew."
"I read the label to find it was made using malt whiskey but when i poured it, i thought it looked like a wheat beer. This is good since that is my favorite style. A pale amber colour, a little cloudy with a nice head but leaving no lacing. The head is a creamy white. The aroma is cloves and some esters. I can taste a sweet hint of caramel, not very hoppy. Has a light, malty finish and quite smooth and drinkable."
"750 ml brown corked bottle. Huge billowing off white head, that left foam (more than lace) on side of glass. Dirty gold-brown with haziness from sediment left at bottom of bottle. Aroma of yeast and oranges, not really smokey. Taste of fruit, oranges again, trace of hops. Disappointed in the lack of smokey character."""
"A nice beer, could do with a bit more peated malt character, I was expecting a ""single malt"" kind of thing."
"Mid dark gold with a generous head this beer has a very yeasty nose that sets stage for a full bodied beer with dryish rye ovetones and great drinkabilty. The fact that this Unibroue has less than 6.00% alcohol makes it appealing to have more than one bottle."
"22oz bottle This beer pours a light golden color with a bunch of haze in it. I expected it to be darker. Has a nice head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma doesn't have much smoke in it. Aroma is spicy and orangy. The flavor has a nice Belgian Trappist feel, but with a very subltle smoke flavor. Very interestingly done and very well done. Very drinkable and it has a medium body."
"This beer departs the bottle a hazy orange color. The nose is not what I expect, but a great orange, spicey belgian nose. I dig it. What a flavor. The smoke and the orange flavor play a beautiful song together. The smokiness is very subdued, and allows the base beer to come through while still reminding me this is a smoked beer. The feel is moderate to thick. Drinkability is excellent as well. I am so sad that this beer is not sold around here anymore. I would try this one if you can find it."
"Beer is good. Happy, stale beering."
"***EDIT: After picking the fairly considerable amount of yeast, a flashlight could barely shine through the bottom of the bottle, up of the bottom and pouring the remnants into the remainder of the beer, I was treated to a much yeastier (duh) version of the beer. Far more dry, but clinging on to its better qualities. Aroma is muted by the fogginess of the yeast. I'd say it's best served w/o the yeast, that aroma was just top notch and made every dive into the beer that much more enjoyable."
"Brown 341 mL bottle with freshness date on rear label."
"This was a very crisp and light bodied beer. Initially some smokiness, yeast, toasted flavour. Then a peppery taste, and some spices. Afterwards, some plum, and more tartness. Mouthfeel was light. Overall, and interesting and refreshing beer."
"First of all, I am not sure if I had a bottle that was on crack or not, but when I opened this undisturbed bottle, it came out flowing with a vengance. It literrally flowed over for a good minute and a half. The overall appearance was very nice with a pretty hazy apple cider appearance. The head was fantastic at first but then fizzled to a film. The smell was wonderful, but I was expecting a little more smokey aroma. The taste gave off a very interesting and enjoyable roasted flavor. It almost gives off a fruity smokness. This was the first smoked beer that I have sampled and I have to say that I am, once again, impressed with Unibroue. The only thing that would been topped this off would be a little less flat taste, but that could have been due to the bottle in review."
"dark blond almost amber color, with a small frothy head. Smells ever so peculiar, different than any other beer I have ever smelled. You can easily detect the smokiness and whisky malts that are present. The taste is smoky and fruity (that ever popular Unibroue yeast). A very nice ""light"" beer from Unibroue."
"Pours a dark amber brown with a head that fades quickly and sleep at the top of the beer for the ride. Smells woodsy with touches of hops, yeast and roasted grains. All mellow and mild aromas. this is the smoothest smoked beer I've ever had. Mellow woodsy flavors remind of the forests of Ontario. Good kick of Unibroue yeast and even a touch of hops. I'll definitely be having another one!"
"Hazy, peachy-gold in hue, there is a coppery hint as well, especially when held to a light. The head was white in color and a finger in height at the zenith. The head retention was fair, after a moment or so it slithered to a fizzy cap and then a frail collar. There is no lacing, odd, which is disappointing. Still, overall, the appearance is attractive. The nose is weaker than I was expecting. Also, the aroma is distinctively Belgium with lots of yeasty complexities coming through. Vanilla, hints of fruit like oranges, peaches, and something tropical. Candied sugar. At the back is a suggestion of whiskey and peat. These smells are very faint; actually the fruitiness is frail too. No smokiness. The nose is boring, I like what I smell but what is it saying? Speak up! There is no invitation to drink. Ill be rude and take a sip anyway. Yum. There are the smoky flavors! On the palate, upfront are the characteristics of many Belgian Ales. There are flavors of candied sugar, vanilla, fruit (apples, peaches, oranges mainly with a hint of something tropical), maltiness sweetness that is pleasantly firm, and pepper. In the middle, the smokey characteristics are found, lightly meaty (fatty bacon, sausage), wood, pure smoke, and some whiskey flavors. Alcohol heat follows, more pepper notes too. The finish is very carbonated which does add a lot to this beer and the aftertaste is a good mix of fatty meat, smoke, and the skeleton of a light Belgium Ale. I am impressed at the complexities of a beer with such a small abv. It is very light drinking. Medium in body, light on the tongue but the carbonation is very big and lively; this adds great detail to this beer. The mouthfeel is pleasant. I could really dig this in the summer heat or even a cool winter evening. Id love to drink the more often, of course it is not available in Nebraska and I have not seen it in KC. I bought my 750ml bottle in Burnsville, MN. Well worth a quaff."
"overall, superb."
"Sampled 4/2/04"
"Raftman poured ever so beautifully, with as much head as you wish to pour, foamy, consistent and thick. The massive white head churns like butter or cream in the glass, making a noticeable crackle sound. Patchy lacing. The beer itself is off-ruby, with hints of orange, and it sometimes has the appearance of tomato-juice, but less red. Besides typical Unibroue spice and yeast smells, there is a very flowery, very herbal, and sweet aroma, smelling delicately like some whisky, even managing to give wooden, oak aromas. Every occasional sniff I smell a somewhat unnatural smell--solvent-like, rubbery, plastic. Hard to describe. Nectarines, plums, sour candy, delicate sweet malt, oak. Taste is much of the same, and this is probably the least vigorous Unibroue I have tasted for mouthfeel--it is very smooth, comparatively low-carbonated, and easy to drink quickly compared to most Unibroue products. (Not that I would drink this quickly, but it goes down with surprising swiftness.) Of course, the beer is only 5.5%. Definite wood tastes, with sweet malt, yeasty tones, and a sensational aftertaste of light malt, fruity esters, fresh pine needles, and floral, perfumy notes. Overall though, I wish they would give the beer more sweet whisky malt character, because mostly what I sense is the yeasty taste, which seems to overpower most of the other flavours. This is probably the most drinkable Unibroue I have had thus far, due to low gravity and lighter mouthfeel. Conclusion: this is another great product, but one which could probably improve from toning down the yeast or stepping up the whisky malt."
"I avoided this beer for a while as I thought it was a strongly smoked beer (like a rauch brau) I like a scotch ale that uses lightly peat smoked malts. I wasnt ready for what I found in this Raftman. I like it as probably the most drinkable Unibroue offering next to their blanche. Poured a very hazy light gold with a medium puffy cap. Odor was subdued but interesting....musty-bready...slight accent of spice. Started mild then builds to a silky mouthfeel accented by malt body... slight wisps of smoke (like cooking toast) slight hop citrus tastes then a cleaner dry finish with an understated malty aftertaste. A decent very drinkable beer. Not a deeply smoled malt beer that pounds your olfactory senses...a musty malty beer better served cool than cold."
"Had this on tap at a pizza place on St Denis in Montreal back in April. Most non-smokey smoked beer I've ever encountered. Pour was a very cloudy tangerine color, white a stiff white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is all wheat beer and yeast. Taste is alos very wheat beer like, your standard banana and clove encounter. My question was: where's the smoke? Not bad, just not smokey at all."
"The taste was smooth, malty, slightly bitter, not as smoky as the aroma implied, and very restrained. Not too bad. But not spectacular, and not as drinkable as one would hope."
"All in all: it promises something, but is not able to live up to it. The body is not harmonic and balanced, and the promised whiskey malt taste is much to discrete, compared to eg French whiskey malt beer 'Adelscott' or the German 'Highlander'."
"I don't detect the smoke promised on the bottle, this has a smooth mouthfeel with malt characteristic present, and a hint of citrus on the tongue. Fruit character builds throughout as the beer warms on the tongue, and is carried to the throat by an overwhelming carbonated presence."
"Had a really hard time to get a handle on this beer. Poured to a very distinctive orange colour (Maybe even a very deep yellow). Head was a very classical Unibroue style. Hard charging in the beginning followed by a just as hard retreat. I waited patiently for seven minutes for this beer to reveal it smokiness, but it fell well short. The slight waft of whiskey malt (beer is brewed in Sam Bronfman territory) was overshadowed by the fruit swril of apples and pears that lightened the 5.5% ABV. A very capable sipping beer that should be nurtured (still could not find any hint of smoke) in your mouth. My great expectations were quelled to a degree."
"the taste is full and impressive. you can definitely taste the smokiness but it is much more balanced than the German Rauchbiers (a good thing to me). There is a strong malt base and nice hoppy and fruity flavours. This beer is definitely a keeper. The smoke isnt overpowering. Unibroue must be the best brewery in Canada and this beer is worthy of its name. I will definitely try this again."
"Everything about this beer is very gentle and subtle. The moutfeel is light, but the substance of this beer is not -- there's a good deal going on here in terms of flavor, and they're wonderfully blended together."
"Very drinkable and complex beer. A good beer to try, very pleased with this."
"I tried Raftman at the Fourquet Fourchette in Chambly, Quebec, and it was very interesting. The 20oz was poured out of a tap, and it was crisp. The appearance was a nice, hazy colour with a creamy top. The smell was probably the best characteristic: sweet and spicy. The taste was decent at first; it bordered on bland. However, you tasted the acute spicyness on the aftertaste, especially on the back on your tongue. Mouthfeel was average, nothing out of the ordinary. And, the Raftman compliments food very well, especially a Sunday Brunch combo of veal sausages and Canadian bacon."
"I liked this beer, but I didn't get much smoke out of it. There was some peat in the aroma of this hazy, golden ale, but I wanted much more. It is sweet and fruity with a slight smokiness. It is very creamy and goes down easy. I find it hard to stop drinking even though I wished it was smokier."
"I had this beer cool, because I had only had a limited time to refrigerate it. Its a dark amber with a bubbly head that lasted a short while. Smelled kind of like spices, and tasted similar, as well as some sweetness, maybe a little to warm because I hadn't refrigerated it long enough. However, it still had a nice mouthfeel with not too much carbonation, and was very easy to drink."
"Taste is mild, no one flavor overwhelms - the lightly smoked flavor comes through while a hint of a whiskey-like flavor follows right after. This taste characterizes this beer completely and is so even a taste that it literally tastes as the label describes (which not all beers can claim). A good solid beer for the smoked category, and has what I would say a slightly higher drinkability than other smoked ales."
"Pours an orange amber with a big white head which fades quicker than expected. Smokey sweet if there is such a thing. Unusual flavor, but I'm not so sure I'm digging that whisky flavor that is in there. There is a touch of fruity in there too. Hops come along near the end, but are quite subtile. Goes down smooth. An interesting ale from Unibroue. I'd like to try this on tap."
"A nice offering from Unibroue. The whisky malt makes this a very Scotch-ish/Scotch ale taste, and a good example at that. Quite good, and probably would have this again!"
"An off-golden color with thick creamy head. Aromas of spicy yeast,banana,and cloves, with a touch of whiskey to it. The body is light to medium that starts caramel with some clove and yeast, somewhat hefeweizen like in flavor with some vanilla that finishes lightly sweet. I'm rather ambivalent about this brew, nice but they do others much nicer."
"If you like whisky or scotch, as well as beer, then its an interesting and purposeful cocktail of the two. Original and unique. Refreshing evening drink. Swirl it and fizz settles to a nice orange/brown color."
"Tastes like a great summer beer to me, and as such seems like it needs to be fresh."
"This beer pours to a nice light golden color but is fairly hazy. It has a medium head with tiny bubbles that eventually settle to a nice thin rim around the glass. The aroma is slightly malty with the largest hop aroma I have noticed from the Unibroue beers. Slightly sweet taste with, almost a caramel flavor, with a light bitterness at the end of the drink. Overall another good beer worth trying from Unibroue!"
"This light-orange beer has considerable haziness and a thin head, that quickly settles to tiny patches of bubbles. It's highly carbonated, and you can see relatively large bubbles rise through the glass as you drink it. The first smell that you notice is a rough, substantial yeastiness. Underneath that, there's a slight and very pleasant apple-like estery aroma. It's really enjoyable. Slight peppery and smoky taste in the mid-taste, and a mild sweetness up front. At times it seems just a little sour. Light mouthfeel, but not what I'd call thin and watery...it's very drinkable. Fun, uncommon, and quite good!"
"Drinkability: Wow, this is pretty nice. A very different offering from Unibroue, especially when compared to it's siblings. Quite drinkable, I wish I could find this in my area. I'm not certain if this is truly a smoked beer... it seems more like the midpoint on the spectrum between a Belgian Strong Pale and a Belgian Strong Dark ale."
"Drinkability: I wasn't crazy about this beer. Compared to other Unibroue offerings, this one is not one of their best."
"Medium brown color, cloudy. Medium head. Slightly smoky aroma. Lightly malty, and somewhat yeasty. Flavors are subdued and plentiful, smoke, peat, a little whisky, some fruit and citrus. Nice milder tasting beer. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. A very drinkable beer"
"Well done, but not special to my mind."
"Came in a 6 pack (the first I've ever seen Unibroue put out) that I found in Edmonton. Poured from a 341 ml brown bottle, silver foil around neck with a logo, foil becomes purple at the cap. Appearance is that of a chill hazed marmalade hue, decent carbonation, big creamy white head that eventually settles down to a frothy ring. Aroma contains sweet fruity peaches/apricots, some lively spices, the slightest trace of grain. Flavour contains that fruitiness as well, a faint hint of smoke, a bit of grass and flowers. Full refreshing mouthfeel, this goes down smooth and easy, I think I've found a new favorite. Feels like there is a party going on in my mouth and all the cool kids were invited. This malt whiskey ale is the cat's ass, I paid a small fortune for this 6 pack and it was worth every cent. If this was the reward at the end of every day, then I'd be a lumberjack by trade as well. Raftman is where it's at."
"Comments  I dont know if I would call it a whiskey malt, but it was good nevertheless."
"This is an interesting, high quality brew. I'd like to try it again when it's fresher than this current bottle, because I suspect that the disturbing caramel and candied-apple notes I'm getting are from the age of the bottle."
"I think this is a fine example of a quality, fairly complex brew that's unique, tasty, and low enough abv to enjoy for an evening. Let it warm up a bit for max enjoyment, IMO."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. Upon opening the bottle, which had not been disturbed for days in the fridge, it violently poured foam like an active volcano for about 20 seconds. When poured though, the carbonation died down some. It pours a hazy medium orange color with two fingers of white head. There is almost no lacing left on the glass. The smell is very sweet with honey, orange, and a hint of bourbon. The taste is very malty, with more honey and bourbon coming through. It almost tastes like the sweet bourbon glaze that the restaurant I work at uses for pork chops. There is a touch of sweetness and hops to the finish. The mouthfeel is a little light, slightly oily. The drinkability is real nice, as this is a smooth sweet treat."
"Sort of a lightly smoked beer. Poured a dark gold, hazy auburn colour with a nice head. Smelled of peat moss and whiskey. Tasted sort of sweet. Some whiskey flavours at the side of the tongue and finishes slightly bitter. A light mouthfeel and very drinkable. Pretty good beer, but I was expecting a bit more."
"It is supposed to be a smoked brew but I believe the smoke taste could be more present. I would qualify this more as a smoke brew for beginners. Still, very good beer with the disctinct yeast flavor from Unibroue but I frank better brew from Unibroue."
"This is a very unsual brew from Unibroue. I heard this was a smoked beer and was afraid since the only other smoked beer I've had (Aecht Marzen Smoked) was not my cup of tea. Fortunately there was no smokiness in this. Instead I tasted a definite whiskey taste mixed with some sweet malts. Bready malts followed with some spicy yeast that mixed it up well. Peppery spices were apparent in the finish along with a mild fruit sensation. The more I drank of this the better it got."
"Tastes of sweet malt with a medium body and high carbonation feel. Tingles on the tongue and finishes with a slight hop taste. Very sweet, yet not overly sweet. A yeasty middle that gives way to the hops. Smooth and goes down very easy. Great, great beer that is different from the norm and the best Unibroue I've had yet."
"Pours a nice deep copper color with medium head that leaves some pretty nice lacing,I really liked the soft malty slightly sweet aroma.The taste is also pretty soft with a light smokiness to it with a good malty backbone and finishes a little fruity.I think this is a highly drinkable beer for the style,pretty well done."
"This is an awesome beer. For me, it's just the right amount of sweetness. The aftertaste is fantastic: you could use this for mouthwash."
"Originally sampled on 6 August 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. For what's supposed to be a smoked beer, I don't taste any smokiness. In fact, this kind of reminds me of a wheat beer(maybe it's just me). Has a nice crisp taste on the tongue. When I think of a smoked beer, I think more of a winter beer. To me, this is definitely a summer brew"
"Best Before April 4, 2003."
"Color is very cloudy deep yellowy amber, pretty soild and juicy with a two finger high head of a super creamy, whispy light and tight ivory head, very steady and even, leaves some large stringy lace at first but starts to lose its staying power after awhile. Smell is soft, big time soft, sublte, with a deepening character of musty malts, sweetly rich, a tad citrusy, and some faint spice notes and whisky. Intreging mixed tastes of smokey-like malts, very subtle but rich and softly mellowing and warming, some citrusy hops and mild fruit of peach, apricot, and lemony spices fills out through to the finish with a lingering softness that just begs you for another swig. One heck of a interesting brew, put together magnificantly. Feel is pretty full and textured lightly with a small astringency in the middle leading to the soft lingering dryness of warmed ice cream. Pondering this beer is quite fun, it takes more then one glass of it to really appreciate it, one excellent brewed beer, Unibroue never stops the onslaught of interesting beers, and this ranks up there with some of the finest. Magnifique'."
"In the mouth, again, the favourite word here is ""soft"". Smooth, light, and easy drinking. Happily, this beer is only 5.5%, which means that the drinkability is unhampered -- so many of its Unibroue brethren are just too powerful to quaff in quantity (drink less, drink better indeed!)."
"Not quite what I was expecting, but good none-the-less. I thought the use of whiskey malt would impart a little bit more of its characteristics. Still a very enjoyable brew."
"Cheers"
"I can't for the life of me figure this beer out, and maybe that's okay, in this case. I've had different reactions every time I've had it, liking it more each time. A most unusual ale. Unibroue is most adept at crafting unique beers, and this is definitely one of those."
"Hazy apricot hue, topped by an intially thick vanilla white head that quickly fizzles into a thin, but tight layer. Devoid of any lace. Waft of buttery caramel and woody oak hits the nose at first, then is followed by a bright contrast of Unibroue yeast's signature ripe, juicy tropical fruit albeit at a diminished level compared to their other brews. Curious impression of grilled passionfruit topped with caramel syrup. Odd, yet enjoyable in aroma. Begins slowly flavorwise-- Doughy, flour like malt with a delayed sweetness intially in flavor lingers, and is ensued by citric, lightly acidic, kumkuat like fruit after a significant deliberation. Mild banana and peachy esters emerge mid palate simulataneously with lightly toffeeish caramel. Malt character ends rather abruptly, leaving the constituitively expressed, bittersweet non descript hop bitterness and residual sugar combination to dominate late. Moderate in body once the carbonation dissapates, revealing a functionally smooth, dextrinous mouthfeel. Mellow. Finishes with mild must and notes of candied citrus zest. Raftman is strange, yet enjoyable. It becomes much more balanced and mellow as it breathes and CO2 escapes. It's tasty, but lacks complexity; my least favorite Unibroue thus far. ""Best before 4/9/2003"""
"A light copper body sits crowned with a fluffy white head that subsides in a few minutes. Aromas of Malt, citrus, and whiskey. (It reminded me of when Grandma would send me down to Pendergast's Bar to fetch Pop home for dinner, strictly a beer-and-a-shot kind of place in the Bronx. I can see where Proust was coming from...) Taste is also malt, whiskey, citrus, plus some caramel. A smooth, refined mouthfeel, with medium carbonation adding a nice tang. A smooth, malty sweet finish, with a small citrus tang finishes our whitewater excursion. Yum!"
"-F"
"Drinkability: Good...this would be a good brew to sip when you don't want something heavy and complex. It's light and easy-going and lend's itself well to warmer weather."
"The mouthfeel is very rich for the light taste. The carbonation is very fine and adds another dimension of refined texture to the experience. The drinkability is pretty good, although the lingering yeast component could begin to wear on the taste buds during a prolonged session. But this beer has a refreshing quaity due to the effervescent carbonation and the quaffable ABV. I may end up drinking this beer more oftan than many of the other Unibroue offerings simply becasue it tastes very good, yet I don't need to plan when to have it due to the alcohol content. A very solid offering."
"This is perhaps the lightest of the Unibroue brews that Ive sampled. It was very crisp and refreshing. Poured a hazy copper/orange color with a medium bubbly head. The high carbonation level that seemed to keep the head alive the entire time I was drinking it. There was a small amount of whiskey malt in the aroma in addition to a bit of spicy clove and just a hint of smokiness. The taste is very enjoyable. Theres a kick of toasted malt on the initial taste followed by a subtle caramel and fruit sweetness. Theres a smoky taste left on the palate after finishing this one. It was very enjoyable. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone."
"A nice beer to dine with but not a session brew."
"It is crisp with nice tingly carbonation. The yeast is very well balanced with wheat and lots of grains. A citrusy lemon flavor comes in just before the yeasty kick in the aftertaste. It is very easy to drink. It is pretty light in body, but it does not lack any flavor. Another good one from Unibroue."
"Poured amber in color with a small white head. The moderate to active carbonation feels great for this brew and adds alot to the experience. A soft floral and grape aroma fight for attention. Tastes a bit thin and sweet but some how it lingers for awhile. Raftman is very drinkable and is a good buy at six dollars for a 25oz. bottle."
"The appearance is a golden orangish tone, with a white head along with a solid amount of lace lining the glass. The aroma has a nice apple fragrance along with some nice esters that arise to the nose. Very sweet flavors with the balancing bitterness arising in the finish, very mild smooth and refreshing. For Unibroue this one is lighter in flavor than most of their brews, but it is still a very solid selection that deserves a shot. It dances on the tongue with the high carbonation, but overall a lighter to medium body. Pretty drinkable, but the high carbonation would stop me from wanting to consume too many of these."
"Excellent beer from Unibroue. The head is a nice light brown with big bubbles that settle fairly quickly. The beer is a deep golden to beige color in the glass. The mouthfeel is about average, but the smell and the taste just hit you head on. No that they're overly strong, but the whiskey malt adds a flavor and an aroma that are truly unique and very noticeable. Hints of smoke and an apple-like taste, with definite overtones of whiskey. A real pleasure to drink. I wouldn't be able to have too many because the flavor can get a little overwhelming after a few, but this is a very good beer."
"All in all, a very enjoyable beer, that's certainly worth a closer look. And, unlike the heavy alcohol content of all of Unibroue's other offerings, this one at 5.5% is pretty calm, which makes it an enjoyable beer to have more than one of in any single sitting."
"Cork popped with no overflow. 750 ml bottle best before 11-28-2003. Pours dark gold with a slight orange tint. Large carbonated bubbles. Aroma is on the order of a Chimay. Taste is very dry leaving you wanting to take another drink to refresh. I don't know why I want to describe the taste as corky maybe this is a fault of this particular bottle. Actually I think this taste may be the yeast. Reminds me again of a Chimay. Doesn't have all the fruity tastes or lingering complexity of other Unibroue products still not a bad offering."
"Bright amber, medium head. Big apple cider flavor right off the bat, with twinge of spices and yeast, although mild compared to Unibroue's other offerings. Whisky-malt and smokiness is certainly present but obscured by fizziness and Belgian type yeast. Quite refreshing and a bizarre combination of flavors that works. I am getting a lot of wheat characteristics. Not being as awestruck by Unibroue's popular beers as a lot of people are, I was delightfully surprised by this. I was informed at the store that this is no longer available in the US? Is it a summer seasonal?"
"Big strong alcohol quaff with some clean malt thrown in..  Lots of bubbles in  the hazy pale ale look.  Lasting white head.  Sweet smooth malt taste.  Not as complex as other unibroue offerings.  Smooth boddied malt base comes right at you.  Slight smoke/cinder finish.  As the brew warms the finish does also have a slight touch of floral aftertaste."
"Hazy (bottle conditioned) amber/orange in color with a full, dense white head that drops but keeps a decent 1/8"" of foam and leaves some minor lace. The aroma is fruity (citrusy... lightly lemon, and peach) and quite sweetish (candyish, even) with some noteable yeast character present. Very welcoming. The body is light but enhanced by a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation that gives it a fuller appearance and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is fruity and sweet, but backed by enough underlying bitterness to keep it anchored. There's soft flavors of light  & dark fruits (berries, peach, light citrus), a sweet & bready malt not unlike cookie dough, and a light peppery spiciness and some woody & vanilla notes from the yeast. Very nice. It finishes semi-sweet with a lingering sweet & fruity malt note. If smokiness is to be found in this beer, it's in the finish, and quite light. Well brewed. This would make a great apertif, or even a nice after-dinner drink paired with some lightly sweet dessert cookies or raspberry sorbet. Or, this would also make a great beer for a soft, lightly breezy summer evening as the sun goes down. Quite unique, and very enjoyable."
"This beer pours a hazy orange color and throws out a medium, dense white head that is well retained.  There are some subdued belgian yeast notes on the nose as well as a candy like sweetness.  The taste of this almost reminds me of the JW LEES barleywines, except this is a lot more subdued.  A dark fruit presence is noted.  Some yeasty doughy characteristics.   Whiskey malt?  I'm not sure what characteristics whiskey malt would add, but there is something a little unique about this beer that I can't pinpoint.  Probably the whiskey malt.  Maybe a bit of smokiness.  The body is light to medium.  Nicely carbonated mouthfeel.  And very easy drinking.  Another solid beer from Unibroue."
"edit: this needs to be expanded. The smokey overtones to this are very pleasant. I'm not sure if the whiskey malt comes through with any whiskey-ish flavours, but that sweet smokiness - akin to a campfire burning sugar maple, maybe - is all the result I need from the malts. The typical fantastic Unibroue mouthfeel is present. This would work well with old cheddar cheese, onion soup, or salmon. I have friends for whom the ultimate drinking beer is the Blanche de Chambly, for me it's Raftman."
"I could have one after the other of this brew, I’ll be buying this by the case ASAP."
"Pours a cloudy pale orange color with a 2 finger white head that dissipates rather quickly.  Smell of slight fruit aromas.  Strong yeast taste with just a hint of sweet fruit.  Again after reviewing Unibroue's 1837, this one is not alot better, but I'm starting at the bottom and working up.  Like 1837 this one is interesting, but not great.  A Votre Sante!"
"155"
"Really a different ale, looks and pours like cider.  Slight yeast taste with smoky overtones.  Zero carbonation and head - really wierd.  After reading the other reviews I think I got a bad bottle."
"A great session Unibroue with alot of uniqueness."
"Its Ok, but had too much in common with the other beers from Unibroue, this was Ok though, nice slightly smoky flavours, but not well noticed."
"Based on the reviews below I think I might have gotten a bad beer.  Usually the Unibroue line is quite good, but this beer was fairly boring (for them).  Pours with a large creamy white head.  Clear golden maple color (my wife made me say maple color).  Tart fruity smell, cidery and malty.  No apricot smell noticed.  Doesn't taste as interesting as it smells.  Watery, slightly malty sweet, finishes sweet/sour.  Not anywhere near as good as their other offerings."
"Yeah boy, that's what I'm talkin 'bout."
"Nice, lighter beer in the Unibrew lineup. I greatly appriciate the fact the whiskey malt was not over done. Sit back and enjoy one, or two :-)"
"Fruity, light bodied ale with intense aroma of apricots. Easy to enjoy a few of these. Another in the fine line of Unibroue Belgian Style Ales."
"Raftman is brewed in memory of the masters of the forest who were simultaneously lumberjacks, log drivers and raftsmen to commemorate their legendary courage they knew, when it was time, how to settle their differences and share their joie de vivre around a beer or a whisky."
