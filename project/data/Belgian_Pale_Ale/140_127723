3.65,0.3,5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Once more, there were so many lees that even the slightest movement of the bottle would rouse them. This was going to take a skillful, steady hand in order not to screw it up. Now, where might I find such a thing?  I pulled it off, but given the resulting wisps, I decided to again employ the bartender's trick. This resulted in a finger of fluffy, eggshell-white head that slowly fell back to wisps. Color was again a solid Gold (SRM = 5) and when coupled with its NE-quality clarity, I had a return visit from Midas, Mammon and Croesus, all wanting a sip and all squabbling about it, as is their wont. Nose held a peppery, spicy funkiness, leaving no doubt that it was some sort of Belgian-style beer. The hops may have fallen off in the interim, but I was not really unwound. Mouthfeel was medium. Taste was kind of muted in comparison to the nose. It had a lemony-citrus flavor and a light pepperiness, but the promise of the nose was simply not met. Finish was semi-dry, but I just felt like it lacked any Ooomph! like the nose had led me to expect. Final pour: Some nice murky mud in terms of color. Nose held a pronounced funk. Flavor was only slightly better.","woodychandler","Feb 16, 2015"

Light citrus and pine with some fruity Belgian yeast notes and a touch of spice.  Taste brings some citrus and piney hop flavor with fruity notes and a slight cracker like sweetness mid palate and fades to a floral and spicy finish.  There is some surprising body here which I'd call medium.  Medium carbonation goes creamy mid way and finishes nice and dry.  Overall this is interesting but the thing is it isn't a great Belgian beer and it isn't a great pale ale.  The components are there but it falls short of great, but is good.","HopBomb515","Nov 08, 2014"

Light Belgian yeasty profile, and nice balance. Classic SN job of absolutely nailing the mouthfeel for the style, and leaving a nice aftertaste. This was my favorite of the Beer Camps I tried. I'd jump on another if I found it.","Mikus","Sep 30, 2014"

It pours a slight hazy gold under a grand 2” stiff white head that produces classic Belgian gothic window lace. The flavor profile begins with a slight sweetness, banana, faint orange, hints of bubble gum, some biscuit notes and then it dries out with a little yeast funk and an assertive hop bitterness that lingers well into the aftertaste to conclude with a crisp, dry, flavorful finish. The exquisitely creamy, moussey texture gives the beer a satisfying medium to medium light feel.","pat61","Sep 30, 2014"

I found it lightly hopped, with a tropical fruit note that leads into a honey dew/melon finish. It tastes pleasantly topical as well, with some of the melon and honeydew mixing in with the hop profile. Interestingly, I found a touch of bicarbonate on the finish, and a taste of malt. This kept my interest and I hope to try it again.","elNopalero","Aug 31, 2014"

3.75,3,,,,,,"Poured a nice cloudy golden body with a half finger of white head. Quite nice looking, very true to style. Scents of lemon zest, coriander, spicy phenols, including white pepper-like aromas, hints of tangy orange, fruity esters reminiscent of apricot, a faint note of bubblegum and a tiny bit of clove. A very nice aroma that is fruity and spicy as a Belgian Pale Ale should be and is quite appetizing. Flavor begins medium-dry with notes of white pepper, coriander, lemon zest and a slight pine flavor with faint tart citrus adding depth in the background. This moves into more pronounced spicy phenolic flavors, focusing on white pepper and coriander with lemon zest present and a slightly higher bitterness with hints of tart citrus continuing in the background. Finish is medium-dry with notes of white pepper, coriander, clove, spicy Belgian yeast phenols that are less determinable and lemon zest. Aftertaste is dry with notes of lemon peel, clove, coriander and white pepper, with a hint of cracker-like malt. A very spicy and dry flavor profile overall, not completely true to style, but still quite pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied and drying with moderate carbonation keeping it light feeling on the tongue. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable. Overall this is a good Belgian Pale Ale that doesn't stray too far from drier examples of Belgian ales in aroma and flavor. It's refreshing mouthfeel also make this quite the excellent Summer beer. Interestingly it reminds me most of drier examples of saisons.","Auraan","Aug 16, 2014"

The taste has more hops than the aroma indicated. Citrus with some light tropical fruit notes. Funky yeast, coriander and cloves as well. Finishes with some citrus peel, yeast, and spices. Creamy mouthfeel with a large amount of carbonation. This was better than I expected and with much more hops. Overall, pretty decent beer.

The result is a beer that fits the style but does so in unimpressive fashion.","siege06nd","Aug 10, 2014"

I'd say this offering sufficiently meets what I would expect from a collaboration involving American-based Belgian-style heavyweights Allagash.","LambicPentameter","Aug 05, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, tangerine, pear, melon, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and citrus hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, pear, melon, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of yeast spiciness/light hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, pear, melon, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and citrus hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy Belgian pale ale. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and citrus hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

3.53,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma of light hops and some Belgian yeast character, which shows itself not so much in strong esters but in an earthy pungent and bready malt character. Aroma gets more complex with warming with deep muddled aromas. Taste is spritzy with carbonation and flavors of bread, lemon and spice. Coriander notes increase with warming and blend well with hop/yeast notes. Finish is full if a bit uneventful as a flash of citrus exists but nothing lingers on the close. Overall pretty good and quite different than Yvan the Great, which I prefer to this one.","HalfFull","Jul 30, 2014"

Flavor is crisp, light, refreshing: reminding me of a great example of a Belgian blonde beer. Yeast is subdued in its spiciness. The coriander doesn't stand up well against the strength of the hops. Definite PNW hops profile. Finishes clean. Mouthfeel is moderate and easygoing. The carbonation is refreshing. Very solid beer.","goochpunch","Jul 30, 2014"

Nose expresses citrus, light floral aromas and a hint of yeast. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a bit of spiciness, some citrus zest and a light, earthy/herbal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that leaves a residual bite. Overall, a very drinkable and flavorful Belgian Pale Ale. Almost comes off as a BPA/BIPA hybrid.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some bready/grainy malt and peppery spice. Luckily the flavors aren't subtle like the aroma is.

4.06,11.5,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a golden orange amber with a one finger white head with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of orange, tangerine, grassy and citrus hops, coriander; floral and estery. Flavor is mixed orange and lemon citrus, light saison yeast, coriander and clove, Belgian yeast, citrus hops. Finishes with lemon citrus, grapefruit rind and citrus hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good peppery carbonation. I guess if I had to guess what a collaboration between Allagash and Sierra Nevada would taste like, this would be it. Nice Belgian yeast and spice character, but flavorful hops complementing the spicy bitterness. An aromatic, spicy, citrusy ale that pushes the envelope for a Belgian style, but pulls it off, there are elements of American pale ale, tripel and Belgian pale ale in here and they play well together. Tasty. I felt like a friend had left me abandonded at the side of the road when Allagash left the Seattle market, but I'm glad to have a small taste of them again and wish them luck. I'm 3 for 3 now for nice ales from this great twelve pack.","LiquidAmber","Jul 21, 2014"
