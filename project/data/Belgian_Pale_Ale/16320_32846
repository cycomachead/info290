The head slowly retreats with marvelous lace rings. The nose is bright and fruity with strong malt presence. A complex yeast starts off the taste. The mid point of the palate comes through with light malts and dusty grain. The end hits with mild hops. The feel is thin, light, crisp and high carbonation which equates to a fairly smooth finish. Tons of flavor, dry on the end. Go for this if you get the chance.","macher0","May 25, 2014"

The aromatics mostly yeast driven it seems gives of an interesting phenol, that plays well with the soft spicy citrus notes present from the hops. the flavor is very similar to the aroma. Its semi sweetness finishes comfortably dry. what makes this beverage above average is the mouthfeel. It has a high carbonation level that does not effect the creaminess in the mouthfeel. There is no alcohol warmth and very approachable. This is overall something to share with friends not an everyday beverage but overall impressed.","t8s8l8","Oct 06, 2013"

Pours moderately cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, orange zest, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, honey, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, grape, orange zest, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, honey, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, pepper, clove, floral, grass, herbal, bread, honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish; expected of 4.5%. Overall this is an excellent hoppy Belgian pale ale! All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy ester, malt, and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 06, 2013"

It's all the nice flavors you normally associate with burn only there's no burn. And the aftertaste is superb. It tastes the way an old dusty beerstore smells, only in no way gross.

There's a touch of medicinal phenols in the finish that remind me of aged Orval, faint enough to add an interesting complexity.

The taste was also hoppy up front, but none of the bitter aftertaste of IPAS. This beer finished with a sweet, smooth flavor that was refreshing and different.

It tastes like a light Belgian IPA, which makes sense given the self-applied label, ""Extra Hoppy Ale."" I chilled it down a bit in the refrigerator and side-stepped the overflow other BA's have reported. Consequently, the head was probably a bit less than it could have been. The beer is a glowing, hazy yellow-gold liquid with a puffy white head. The aroma is a bit weak. Dry yeast is the main aroma, but there is a noticeable tangerine hop undercurrent. The beer really shines on the palate. It's a pretty exceptional beer given the truly sessionable 4.5% abv. Both malt and hops shine and work well with the yeast. The malt is light but fresh and flavorful. The hops give the beer a great bite in the aftertaste and provide pleasing bitterness and flavor throughout. The yeast flavors are a refined and restrained Belgian complex of earth and must. This is one of those great foreign session beers that's sadly too expensive to drink in quantity here. I'm deeply envious of Belgians (and anyone else lucky enough) who can find it easily and cheaply.","popery","Jul 01, 2009"

It looks great and feels pretty good, but to me the flavor just wasn't good at all. I have to wonder if the problem is my lack of familiarity with the style given the high rating of this by fellow BAs or even maybe a light struck bottle.

On the palate, things are light and soft, with wonderful integration among the different flavors. Fresh lemongrass bitterness starts things off, with more herbal notes in the middle.

There is not too much 'belgian funk' in this beer, almost disappointingly, but I can drink an entire bottle and not be smashed. The hops in this beer are subtley bitter and build up on the palate.

The yeast gives the beer a Belgian spiciness, which reminds me of coriander and anise. The aftertaste is dry and hoppy. Mouthfeel is smooth.","Absumaster","May 28, 2007"
4.27,9.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"M&D: creamy in texture, subtle in carbonation and medium-bodied, this is a very nicely flavoured, heavily hoppy ale, just like what it says on the beer label: ""Extra Hoppy Ale"". That said, with due respect, it lacks the kind of complexity that other good Belgian Pale Ales have, and is not as bitter as a real Bitter fan would satisfyingly contemplate... extremely quaffable and more-ish, though.","wl0307","May 14, 2007"
4.42,13,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"BBE aug 08. Nice and lasting white head and a cloudy golden beer. Nose is quiet hoppy belgium goldings like so spicy with bit of sour orange and some pale maltyness. Sparkling and inviting fresh. Taste is bitter and dry without missing some maltbody. Good mouthfeel and full taste despite only 4.5%. Great session beer IMO.","paterlodie","Nov 17, 2006"
