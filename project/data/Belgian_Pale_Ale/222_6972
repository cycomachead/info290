Pours moderately cloudy deep gold color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, honey, bread, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, hops, and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, honey, biscuit, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, pear, apple, white grape, honey, biscuit, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of pale malt, hops, fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a very nice malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian pale ale. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of pale malt, hops, and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 27, 2014"

It's not imposing to look at with tons of sediment, nor is it an ugly quad. It doesn't have a very high abv, it tastes good, very fruit-forward and typical of the esters of Belgian yeast. Recommended, especially if you have never had a Belgian ale before.","BierJager89","Feb 04, 2014"

The hops and malt coexist together but don't seem to make a whole- that's really too bad for such a pretty beer.

Clean biscuit malts hit the palate first with a backend of fruitiness and herbal grassiness in the finish. A touch of white pepper from the yeast used, but overall a very complex low alcohol session ale from Maredsous. Finishes pretty dry with yeast spice and grassy hops, nice straight forward Belgian pale ale...efferevescent carbonation dead on to the style.

The aroma had nice belgian yeast notes with dark fruit, brown sugar, and slight booze. The taste also had huge sweet malt and belgian yeast flavors with pruny dark fruit brown sugar accents. The brew was full in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty,yeasty, dark fruity, and sticky finish. It drank quite well and was a solid brew from maredsous.

Refreshing tartness in the taste, sour flash here and there and over ripe fruit hints with yeast backdrop. Neither bitterness nor malt predominant, citrus and spice was in the mix but muted.

3.63,-5.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"On the whole a good beer with decent drinkability that is both worth a try and the price. A great accompaniment with a variety of food from fried polenta with cheese to Belgian waffles with chocolate syrup. Both of which I have paired it with at Belgian Beer Café in Barra de Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro.","Beeryce","Nov 01, 2006"
4.24,10.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Remarkable beer. And unlike other Belgian blondes, not cloying or heavy. I could drink this all afternoon.","vancurly","Oct 19, 2006"
2.96,-23.1,4,3,3,2,3," However when drinking I felt a very light beer, with a small barley taste. Bitter-like mouthfeel, goes down too fast. I honestly expected a heavier-bodied beer for its smell and ABV (6%) but I found it very light and easygoing.","sewald","Sep 27, 2006"

3.96,2.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This is a very good, well made beer. It is high quality, just not exactly to my taste, but still very enjoyable as well as being a joy to look at. Worth whatever they're charging.","daliandragon","Sep 17, 2005"
4.11,6.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"BB 12-2007 Great poorout with huge head forming and forever lasting and leaving beautifull patterns on the glas. Nose is very fruity mostly strawberry but also litle malts but overal light. Taste is lot better with good strong maltynes, alcoholic bite, fres and fruity with blackcurrant note and good but moderate bitterness. Litle sweetness cause of fruityness but overal dry caracter. Great carbonisation makes with taste a good mouthfeel and easily drinkable.","paterlodie","Jul 22, 2005"

2.71,-29.6,3,2,3,2.5,3,"The first taste that hits the mouth is alcohol. But that is soon replaced wit ha mild bitterness combined with a balanced maltiness. Bitter hops and a fruity note of green apples dominate the aftertaste.","bark","Oct 07, 2004"
3.65,-5.2,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"A nice Belgian Blonde. More orangey-gold than blond in colour. Yeasty, orange-rind nose, lightly flowery. Flavour is dry, citric and lightly spicy, yeasty. Pretty faultless, and easy to get along with. Soft, round, balanced, with an interesting yeasty/spicey character, pretty much how i like my paler Belgian ales to be, very tasty.","rastaman","Aug 16, 2004"

3.77,-2.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"75cl bottle: This pours a golden, yellow color. There was a huge white head. Some lacing. It is also a bit fizzy. The aroma is slightly malty. Is this going to be a Belgian attempt at a macro? Maybe not. Some faint floral notes and fruit in there also. A lighter malt sweetness than you usually get with the Abbey style. Some yeastiness and breadiness to the taste. Maybe a few faint fruits also. Good, but a little light.","Boto","Jul 08, 2004"

3.75,-2.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"It comes in a large brown bottle with a thin neck and bulbous top. It pours a muddy copper with an overly big beige head. The head may be a result of all that pent up effervescence trying to funnel through that thin bottleneck. The aroma of malt, hops, yeast and alcohol (Hmmm, the ingredients) are not all that obvious and fades with the head. The medium malt body contains a lightly sour yeasty flavor, a mild sweetness and an astringent and lightly citrus bitterness. It's just a tad watery and lacking in upfront aromas and flavors, but I like it...and it blends and balances towards the end of the glass.","BeerResearcher","Sep 12, 2003"
3.26,-15.3,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall, very disappointing. I will try another, but it will be very difficult to obtain for me.","Loki","Sep 12, 2003"
3.68,-4.4,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Came out a deep clear orangish gold under a firm but bubbly off white head, which lingered well and left some very good lace. The nose was fruity sweet, while the mouth was (too) heavily carbonated but light in texture. The initial taste has the typical francophone fruity sweetness. The hops come on strong soon thereafter, though, leaving a very crisp, just this side of harsh impression. The aftertaste is mildly bitter, but a bit thinner than I would prefer. Overall an excellent beer, but still missing something.","Globetrotter","Jul 31, 2003"
4.18,8.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this on tap at the Half Moon in Kennett Square,a real nice golden/orange color with a very sticky head,very fruity aroma of banana and a slight pineapple aroma.Taste is slightly yeasty with some nice fruity tones almost to easy to drink.Seeing I was on the roof outside drinking this it seemed to go down even easier.Real nice.","oberon","Jul 30, 2003"

3.92,1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The pour a nice golden-orange color, moderate sized head, frothy, brilliant white color, fine sheets of lace to coat the glass. Nose is sweetly fruity like a ripe banana, malt, citrus, and quite pleasant. Begins sweet, top has a moderate mouth feel. The finish is modestly acidic, pleasantly hopped, quite dry aftertaste. As for me, I normally don't care for ""Blondes"" at least where beer is concerned!!!, but I find this one quite quaffable.","Gusler","Nov 08, 2002"
