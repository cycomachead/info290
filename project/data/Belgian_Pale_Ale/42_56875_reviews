"Poured into a tulip glass. Amber/orange with a large white head that lingers.  Malt smell with a little sweet/sour in the background.  Taste sweet malt with a little sour aftertaste, mild fruit taste in the background.  Medium carbonation with a nice crisp finish."
"On tap at Najas Place in Redondo Beach. Small head with no lacing. Floral and yeast aroma. Bitter and crisp."

"D: Delicately balanced with some real crisp and refreshing flavors. Lots of bready malts with peppery spice and soft fruity undertones. Even at six months past it’s best date this was tasting great. I haven’t ventured too far into the Belgian Ales just yet but this one comes across as done right. Just really well constructed with some brilliant simplicity is all I can say. Will definitely be checking out more from these guys."

"Overall- A solid beer. Ommegang beers appear to scream quality. This is a beer I think would be good for any month. I think both ipa and lager lovers would find this beer enjoyable."
""
"O- A well-rounded Belgian Pale that has a pretty big hop presence. Ommegang almost never disappoints."

"O - is it special? Probably not to most. But for me, this is a real gem from Ommegang. We live in a world where hops, massive amount of abv, and huge stouts rule every inch of our country. This offers something everyone can enjoy. Lighter beer drinkers will appreciate its generously fruity palate, there is some hops there for the everyday hop head, the belgo freaks get a traditional Belgian style all the while those looking to expand their hop palate will find this a great beer to gradually bring you to those gifted places. All in All, BPA is a fine little ale and a part of the Ommegang family of fine American- Belgian ales. This is the perfect spring time beer. I know it'll be in my fridge when we start seeing green in nature again next spring."
""

""
""

"The BPA poured a golden color with a robust head that lingered the entire sitting. The taste was light and peppy with plenty of bright carbonation that kept it easy to drink. The hops hit my tongue first with citrusy notes and the Belgian yeast flavors of cloves lingered on my palate. The BPA was a brilliantly balanced brew that kept things light while cleverly concealing its complexities."
"O: Not the most complex Belgian pale out there, but it's charming enough and very easy to drink. Great as an introductory beer for those who aren't familiar with the style."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. I tried a sampler originally at an Oktoberfest celebration at a local winery, liked it so much that I picked up a bottle. It was caramel colored in the glass, very rich looking with a fair head. Smelled of citrus with wheaty overtones. Very smooth taste, wheaty but not too bitter. My only complaint was that at the final few sips the citrus was a bit too much. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the perfect example of a beer that is designed to be restrained, yet remains interesting. None of the flavors jump out and hit you over the head, but there is enough going on in there that you are highly motivated to finish the pint. I really enjoyed this beer and have ranked it among my favorites for the style (4.25/5)."

"Overall, if you are a proponent of subtle tasting beers, this is for you. There are so many faint tastes and smells that you'll have a ball detecting them all day. Personally, I am for the heavy hitting scents that are obvious, but this was not a bad beer if you are a supporter of Ommegang and pale ales."
"Taste- Lemon peel with light sweet grainy malt. Light pine from the dry hops that keeps this beer very dry. Some esters and spice from the yeast."

"Overall I thought this was nice Belgian Pale Ale and an above average example of the style, but it had a couple flaws that held it back from being as good as it could be. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and not filling, the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, but I think the carbonation would really start to wear one me if I had more than one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, I thought they were both good and pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was just a little bland and it didn't really live up to the good aroma. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's pretty pricey and there's a few other BPA's that I like much more than this one, I would recommend it if you really like the style but I don't think I would recommend it to any of my friends. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, it wasn't bad, but it for sure wasn't on the same level as some of the better ones of the style and it doesn't come close to being as good as my favorite Belgian Pale Ale which is Orval, I tend to prefer a Belgian Pale Ale with a slight bit of funk to it. This made for an ok first impressing of Ommegang, I got a few more of their beers to try so I can get familiar with them, but so far i'm not really impressed, but we will see how I feel after I try some of their more popular beers."
"Cool that it tastes like it came straight from a brewery in Belgium rather than a North American brewery adding some Belgian yeast to their PA. The head is huge and rocky with a slightly cloudy dark gold colour. The nose is pure brewery with a yeasty tang( plus the hops of course). I really liked the way the beer tastes like a fresh beer straight from the keg, all yeasty and thick in the mouthfeel. Unlike any pale ale I have tried. At times it feels like an English bitter with the taste of the hops and the slightly under-carbonated mouthfeel. Great beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pleasure to drink. Would be happy to buy more of these, either at the bar, or at home."
""
"The BPA from Ommegang was terrific. The pour was nice and has an orangeish hue to it. There was a nice frothy head that lingered as well. The aroma was fruity with hits of citrus and light hops. The flavor was also light and crisp with a nice minimal hoppy after thought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid Belgian ale – great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a burnt light orange hue with a billowing three finger head full of tight tiny bubbles and lacing wherever it's been and the smell is very cascade like with aromas of floral hop bouquets and light citrus intertwined with Belgian yeast and fruity esters,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied yet creamy and perfectly carbonated with tastes of those floral bouquet cascade hops which are quite bitter which I like and they dominate but the bready malts and Belgian yeast are still there in the greatest cameo almost tango and cash like and yes it's a quaffable drop that ill be going back for more of cheers."
""
"O: Meets style (outside of the smell). Even though I was quite impressed with this brew I am not sure I would drink again because nothing stands out. Just a solid and sessionable beer. Not sure what you could do to make this beer better."

"The alcohol wasn't that discernible either, until I had pretty much finished this off. It's my fault that I ended up pouring the yeast at the bottom of the bottle out and finishing all of the contents off. This was just as good as I anticipated and a crisp, clean beer for the warm weather that's finally made its way up to my neck of the woods. Not to be missed by anyone who appreciates good Belgian beer, regardless of its origin."
""
"Great “reinvention” of a Belgian Pale Ale, in my opinion (or palate) correcting the excess sweetness and lack of bitterness, resulting in a more balanced and fun beer."

"Pours a finespun hazy gold with refined foam and good retention. The nose is sour lemon with a little funk way in back. Soft creamy head. Banana, soft fruits, spice, toffee malt. Sparkling taste, very dry with medium carbonation. It’s a little heavier than it looks. The alcohol is not perfectly hidden but darn awful close! It’s a pale ale so the sour bite from the hops is just good punctuation. In an over sized wine glass this ale has graceful poise."

" Omnegang. Have been impressed with most of their offerings"
""
"O-A GOOD pale ale. Nothing exceptional, but for sure one I'd buy again. Notes in the nose and on the palate were just too subtle. I feel like it needed more in your face features."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had high hopes coming into this beer. I wasn't bad, but certainly not the best. From the start, it seemed promising from an impressive pour, but turned out to be just mediocre. Ommegang is an impressive brewery, but this beer needs a little more work, if they decide to. I may try this again, if its on tap. I wold recommend this beer to a friend, but warn them not to be fooled by the impressive body. Cheers!"
""

"Solid, nothing spectacular or wrong with this beer. Can't fault it in any way, although my personal taste is for fuller more complex Belgians."

"Murky dark golden appearance with decent head. Darker than a regular pale ale. Citrus hoppy aroma characteristic of regular pale ales. Great drinkability. Combines the best of a Belgian style ale with the best of a pale ale creating a refreshing beer that is lighter than a normal pale ale while retaining its classic characteristics. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing and easy to drink. It has just enough complexity to be interesting but not overwhelming. A very nice American attempt that stacks up nicely against the Belgians. It doesn't quite trump them, but it's still a great brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More yeast in the flavor. Starts with a mild grainy malt flavor but ends with a sizable hop bitterness bite. The body is on the full side but the carbonation is also high. There's also some tartness to the flavor."
""
""
"O-a solid Belgian pale ale with good drinkability, a little pricey though"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured for a bottle into a tulip glass, Strog head with excellent retention. Pale orange in color. Stiff foamy peaks. Slight fruity aroma, not overpowering though. Pleasant enough tasting. Somewhat typical for a pale ale. Mout hfeel is a little too rough for my taste. very pleasant finish though. A very good beer but wouldn't be my first choice to have again."
"Body is medium-light with fairly aggressive carbonation, leading to a consistently fizzy mouthfeel that gradually becomes foamy across the palate. Closes semi-dry with little residual stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
"Aaah...it's a pale ale! Has that touch of British brewing with Belgian yeast. Funky and complex, decent enough though not my first choice (or second, or...) from Ommegang."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While it is not what I imagined for this beer, I do enjoy a bit of surprise when I open a new beer. Definitely drinkable and enjoyable but unfortunately not worth the big price tag ($17 for a four pack) to ever buy again."
""
"Ommegang BPA (Belgian-style Pale Ale) ---3.5/5"

"Overall - I'm no fan of Pale Ale's, granted I haven't had many, but I'm trying to branch out, and damn this is a good one. It's those Belgians man, they can make any style better."
"Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some great lacing. Aroma of fruity ester and some dry hoppy notes is very interesting. Taste is a nice mix between some fruity ester with a semi-sweet Belgian malt base as well as some dry hoppy notes. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: What puts this beyond the average summertime beer is its ability to transport its drinker from cold, dreary doldrums to a grassy field during a warm summer's day in Upstate NY. Okay, that was really damn corny, but this beer is THAT refreshing. It makes me wish it wasn't 35 degrees out, that's for sure."
""
"This beer has a classic Belgian look to it. Sparkly gold, clear and bubbly with a thick frothy head. Smells great as well; dried apples, raisins, vanilla essence, malts, and some floral hops. Taste isn't far off either. Nice well balanced blend of dried fruit, hops, malt and spicy Belgian yeast. Peppery, floral hops are there but don't overpower the beer. It's got that great Belgian finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is buttery, smooth, and rich. Medium bodied w/ light carbonation, very nice. Overall a solid, well-rounded beer that is highly drinkable and is perfect for all seasons."
"O - While the taste wasn't exactly what I was hopping for, the aroma blew me away, and I really did enjoy this beer overall. I picked up a corked bottle for about $6, and it was definitely worth every penny. So from me to you, give it a shot if you like Belgian Pale Ale's!"
"o: Great beer and well worth the money."
""
""
"Overall - I love Ommegang and this brew snuck up on me. Not as BIG as their other brews, but it holds it own. If you are looking for a lower abv beer with complexity try this."

"O- Drinkable and flavorful, not overly hopped, spot on for the style."

"Massive head and took 5 min just to pour a 12 oz. Golden orange in color. Smells like honey, citrus, bit of banana and yeasty funk. Flavor has more banana, with some dry and sweet flavors mixing in like hay and honey. Sweet and velvety mouthfeel for the style, without much carbonation. Carbonation somehow comes in flat. Decent beer, but pretty disappointed in this one."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/25/2012. Pours very cloudy golden orange color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice frothy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pear, apple, lemon, pepper, grass, hay, earth, bread, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of lemon, pear, pepper, grass, orange zest, apple, hay, earth, clove, herbal, bread, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus, grass, herbal, earth, pepper, clove, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; no cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian pale ale! Very well balanced with nice complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink. Really enjoyed this, will be on the lookout for some fresher bottles for sure."

"O: great take on the style with just enough hops to let you know it's American. This beer has all the integrity I have come to expect form Ommegang."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A bit overcarbed, but otherwise has a nice depth of flavor to it that is fairly easily drinkable."
""
""
"O- I want to try another with a date within the stated limits. I can tell this is an excellent Belgian pale but I don't know if I am tasting this at its best."
"The beer is satisfyingly full and effervescent in its physical presence on the palate, but for all this promising buildup, its flavor disappoints. It is understated to a fault. Lacking fulsomeness, it is refreshing, I suppose, but veers, if anywhere, toward the metallic. There is a pleasant, but oh-so-mild, hoppy aftertaste, almost imperceptibly seasoned with pickled spiced lemon. Alas, its BPA is not this esteemed brewer's most appealing product, if you're looking for a beer with a robust and definite character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very impressive! Everything about this ale just stands out of the norm... The style, the smell, the taste/feel. So worth the buy! I have been investing a lot more into corked bottles lately, and an exceptional beer just like this one reminds me on how much more it is worth to to go that extra mile (or dollar in this case). I was going to grab the tripel karmeleit this evening, but I am glad I made this choice. This is a must try beer, hands down! ENJOY!!!! I know I did!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very tasty and enjoyable. Very pale mixed with the spices, adds alot of sweet and sour. One of the cheaper brews ommegang makes, and a good representive of the style. Worth a drink for sure."
"Body is light to medium. Goes down rather quick and smooth. Leaves a light coat on the back of the tongue. Dry finish."
""
""
""
"Had some crisp, light sweetness right off from the pale malts. A bit biscuity and crackery, even a touch bready. Was decently bitter with rindyness well displayed here. In addition to the citrus action, there was some funky, Belgian yeast characteristics in the dryish finish. Nothing that knocked my sox off, but it was tasty and satisfying from start to end. Prosit!"
"1488"
""
""
"Gotta love Ommegang. Looks great on the pour. Nose is real strong dough and some floral tones. Strong and unabashed flavor. Real in your face, er, mouth, and just doesn't slow down. Consistent and strong delivery. Lots of dough, which may be a turnoff to some people. Either way, this is a good belgian ale. As I would expect from Ommegang."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not tops in the world, but certainly fantastic! This brewery can do no wrong IMHO! Lets hope they don't start that friggin' micro fracking in NY... otherwise they may be forced to move! I gotta not take this one for granted and put it into the regular rotation."
""
""
""
"Holley Molley, this was one surprisingly good beer. I am always in search of next great Pale Ale. This beer was a new addition to our are market. I was pleasantly surprised. It is excellent blending of Belgian style beers and IPA's. Very good beer at a very reasonable price."
""
"Kind of a so-so beer for me. Pours alright - a bright yellow color. Big time floral smell and it comes through in the taste as well. It's very dry, with notes of grass, grain & lemon. Complex, yet quite drinkable. Definitely on the lighter side, but it's not very refreshing. Other folks might take to it a little better than me I would understand."
""
"Drinkability: This is a very well-crafted brew. Nothing about it is over-the-top and none of the elements dominate, but it is a very tasty and pleasing experience."
"Nose of orange, lemon, yeast, bread and herbal notes reminiscent of lavender. Maybe some hints of mango and slight banana. The taste is very similar. Lemon, yeast, orangey citrus, bready notes, apricot, mango, and some grapefruit. The yeasty/bready flavors are the most prominent in the long haul. Those really stick around while the citrus from the dry-hopping move in and out quickly. On the back end mango floats back up onto the palate and out through the nose. Pretty delicious overall even though light Belgian-style ales aren't really my type."
""
"Very nice beer, but nothing too extraordinary. Definitely worth a try though."
""
""
"Smells of funky Belgian phenolics and yeast primarily, with dried orange peel and spice, florals and clove aplenty. Tastes of all these things, with a definite focus on several varieties of citric peel. As it warms, it gains a certain tannic / wooden astringency that helps provide a drier finish. Medium body and carbonation levels."
""
""
""
""
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured golden yellow-orange with a two finger white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, fruit hop, and spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, fruit hop, spice, earth, and earth hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. This was a fair example of the style, but nothing really stood out at all on it to me. I went back a second day and accidently ordered the same brew as I forgot I hadn’t ticked it the day before and immediately got upset with myself. While this one isn’t bad, it just wasn’t my cup of tea as I really wanted something that would wow me. Unfortunately this was not it… Worth trying for yourself to give it a shot, especially if you are a fan of the style."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the higher side, but also delicate and a little silky. Overall, it's a very good beer of the style. I really like the use of the citrusy American hops in it. It's well balanced, easy drinking and one of my favorites of the style. Very solid beer all around."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, with a good amount of carbonation which feels refreshing. Alcohol is hidden well. A nice change of pace, and a pretty well made beer."
""
""
"This is a decent beer. It doesn't have an overpowering yeastiness that a lot of Belgians tend to have. It's easily drinkable and offers nice, light fruitiness to keep you interested. I prefer the Rare Vos over this but this deserves a try as well."
"O - An incredibly tasty BPA that nails the highlights for the style and offers up a solid bouquet of hops. Super stoked to have tried this, and definitely recommended to anyone who has access."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Covers the bases yet doesn't really wow me in the end, my own subjective take on it. Not a bad beer by any means, I'd have another, though it leave too much of a lasting impression. Would pair well with food though lots of choices with this one."

"Poured from bottle into Duvel tulip. The color was cloudy amber, likely due to spent yeast sediment being upset. The head was a white mixture of bubbles varied from tiny to midsize giving the visual character of soapsuds. The nose was citrus-like and maybe a bit floral. That being the initial impression, the beer first tasted of sweet citrus and finished with light-medium bitterness that doesn't hang excessively. I like a brewer that knows that a beer is more than hop-water."
"Poured a big two finger head with good retention and some slick lace, deep amber in color, complex smell, lots of floral and earthy hops, funky and sour, taste follows the nose, some plum, lemon after the hops up front, medium bodied with decent carbonation, very smooth and the abv is well masked, overall a world class complex brew that is a must pick up"
""
""
""
"O- Another really great beer from Ommegang. Since it is dry hopped with Cascade, it is necessary to get your mits on a bottle (or two) as fresh as possible to enjoy BPA at its peak."
"O: This beer is just okay. A good tasting and well-balanced pale ale with a twist of sour and funky Belgian yeast. This beer is something between a pale ale and a sassion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Certainly a change-up from the American and India Pale Ales everyone is used to and likes so much. I think this would be an excellent style for someone who likes the concept of the APA and IPA, but is a little put off by the American tendency to get a little crazy on the hoppiness. I would certainly drink this beer again, and would recommend it to those who enjoy these types of beers. Not necessarily a starter beer, in my opinion. Good representation of what I have read and heard about this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice overall beer"
""
""
""
""
"Another crushing disappointment from Ommegang. Looks good, hazy, pale, super long lasting head, but aroma is plain, lacking Belgian spiciness, Brett, hops, or even pleasant yeasty or malt aromas. Flavor is a big let down, with a touch of slightly cardboardy twang that bad homebrew sometimes gets. Finishes dry and fairly bitter, but I just can't see finishing this beer. What part of this beer is Belgian again?? Should have chucked some Brett in here to at least give it some interest. Sad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It appears a hazy golden yellow with a foamy head. The aroma was familiarly hoppy (cascade?), and fairly yeast assertive (my friend suggested a bit of mosquito repellent). The taste is somewhat more promising, as the chalky belgian yeast character feels better in the mouth than it smells. The interplay between yeast and hops is quite nice, but I still felt the malt presence could be a little better. Was not a favorite of the afternoon, but still nice in its own right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent take on the Belgian Pale Ale style from Ommegang. It's nothing to write home about, but I'd put it up against just about any BPA out there."
""
""
"O - What a nice change up from American Pale ales. Haven't had many of these but maybe seeking them out wouldn't be such a bad idea. This one is top notch."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very drinkable dynamic Belgian Pale Ale. I would pick this up again especially if I want something that is more on the belgian/pilsner malt side of pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall an extremely good tasting brew with a low alcohol content for a Belgian Ale, which makes this a beer I could drink all day long…"

"Served at a good temperature and with a large, fluffy, frothy, billowy, cream colored head and some lace. Color is a clear amber with a couple of lazy bubble trails. Aroma is a traditional Belgian blonde, spicy, malt, a bit of fruit, not overly sweet. Body is ok and carbonation is a little on the flat side. Finish is similar to flavor and on the short side. Beer promises huge dividends and is excellent, but seems somehow as if it should be better."

"Exceptional brew. Everything a Belgian-style pale ale should be. High level of complexity and balance."
""

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, herbal hops, and a slightly funk gym sock aroma. Taste is of malt/grain, grassy hops, and a slight funk on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good Belgian pale ale that is very easy to drink. Not too crazy about the smell though."

"O - A nice easy drinking beer. The smell is outstanding and the rest is very good."
""
"Lots of bubbly fizz. Solid and hoppy this is a good choice and something I’d love to snag at the bar."
"Overall: B+, drinks a little lighter than I prefer"
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the big citric inclusions and the hoppiness. The taste was very much like a mildly hoppy standard Belgian wit. It had all the drying, bittering wheat one could hope for, with a nice dash of clove. We would have liked to see a bolder feel, with a thicker body and more punch from the paler side of the malts."

"meh. its decent enough, but I expected and hoped for more of a balanced flavor, however the spicy yeast flavor overpowers everything."
""
""
""
""
"Usually IPAs are too hoppy for me, but this is not only within my tolerance but something i can enjoy. It does challenge my taste buds which are more accustomed to porters and stouts, as well as my beer vocabulary."
""
""
"Pours a light to medium copper amber with immense thick white foam. Very sticky, patchy everywhere. Classic belgian yeast smell, and tropical fruits to boot,. Firm hop taste evolves into a fruity malty blend. Smooth, fruity, balanced. On the lighter side, and clean throughout. Finishes easy, very tasty BPA. These guys know what they are doing."
""
""
"Nice regular gold in appearance. Smell is a nice citrus hop aroma, hits the nose well. This is a tingle on the tongue and the mouthfeel is great. Wet in and dry out of the mouth, well done. Fruity, sweet, hoppy and well balanced. Overall this beer is so fridge worthy we can't afford to fill the fridge. Whoya, wow, ohea, and SMAAKELIJK says the Dutchman. This will go well with an excuse, to have another."
""

""
""
"O- This was an interesting beer. I could tell right from opening it that it was going to be an aggressively carbonated beer. The head on this beer was very interesting- foamed very fast (probably one of the most intense heads I've encountered before) and took a peculiar shape that had great retention. One word of advice is to be very careful when pouring. Overall this beer was very good for a pale ale. Nice slightly sweet, well balanced taste."
""
"Interesting beer but ultimately too dry and sour for my tastes, perhaps best left as a complement to food on a hot day. If only the taste matched the awesome smell."
"$8 a 750"
"This was an average BPA, there was quite a bit to taste but I felt the flavor was a little too thin."
"O. A decent, but not great offering from a brewery ive come to know and love. I guess its an acceptable example of a belgian pale, but it doesnt really do the brewery justice. Being a homebrewer, I would have tried to smooth the pepper hop profile and balance the noble hops a little better. Not bad, just not one of Ommegang's better beers. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for a standard BPA and it isnt adequately spiced to consider it a good belgian fit. Not as good as the Ommegang Rare vos."
""
""
""
"On tap at the Dutch. Golden hue capped by a nice head with good retention, slightly cloudy. Smell is full of flower and light cracker. Well balanced by light malt, slightly cutting bitterness from flower, light grass and hay. Light to medium bodied.."
""
""
"This is a tremendous Belgian Pale. I love this. Man, I gotta have another Orval sometime soon. Not my favorite style, but now I'm not sure which is my favorite example."
""
""
""
""
"my compliments to the brewer on a skillfully made beer...I want whatever yeast strain they use to get this great fruitiness!"
""
""
""
""
"Flavor wise its got that yeasty backbone with some subtle hop sweetness in the middle with a nice dry, crisp finish."
"Overall: Not quite what I was expecting, but a tasty beer nonetheless. Beginners may not appreciate all that is going on here, but they should not shy away from it."
"O - Overall a nice introduction for me to this style. I enjoyed this beer but I suspect that it had been sitting on the shelf a little too long. It nice to see a combination of fruity and hoppy flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall- Would be a great beer to drink if you were going to have several, taste is pleasant but not overally controversail."
"Overall: Not a bad offering from Ommegang. A good begginer beer into the BPA style for me. Still looking into this style all the time and will be hitting this up again in the future. Would like to see more sweetness to balance out the citrus and tart flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid Belgian pale, I'm not finding much fault w/ this one."
""
"I recommend you listen to the band Kiss with this beer. I figure Kiss lovers will enjoy this beer. Did you know Kiss sold more albums than the Beatles? Gene Simmons likes to remind the world of that often."
"O: Meh, alright beer. Neither a great Ommegang nor a great Belgian Pale. Still, perhaps a cut above many other 'pale ales' in general. I would drink it again, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent beer. Faithful to its Belgian roots, but with a great American hop character. I would love to have this again and am disappointed to have not sampled this one earlier!"
"Overall: I really like Ommegang's take on the style; the fruity elements, the hop character and the well-balanced finish are very appealing"
"O: a delicious BPA with wonderful complexities yet a very easy drinker. Easily one of the best beers I've had."
"O- Very good Belgian pale ale. Easy drinking and refreshing."

"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a super large foamy head with good retention and some great lacing. Aroma of fruity ester and some dry hoppy notes is very interesting. Taste is a nice mix between some fruity ester with a semi-sweet Belgian malt base and some dry hoppy notes. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed with great drinkability factor though lacking some minor notes of floral aroma."
""
"Overall: Pleasant, bold, complex brew. Great variety and balance of malt and hop flavor. Exceptional mouthfeel."
"pours honey colored and a bit cloudy into a snifter, with the ommegang signature frothing over the top crazy head. aroma is floral hops and belgian yeast. tastes a little fruity, with a round floral hop finish. really really nice beer to session as it has a lower abv than many ommegang beers and the complexity makes the thirsty man curious for more. on the pricey side, but it is money well spent. update: on tap this is an entirely different beer, for the better. the yeast is almost tropical, and the hops seem more fresh. not to be missed on tap!"
"golden in color and nearly white as it shined through. Really amazing color here or lack there of I should say. Big white fizzy head of foam then rises up two fingers high and settles down quickly leaving only a light bit of lacing on the sides but tons of carbonation bubbling toward the surface. Aroma is light, fresh grass, lemon zest, hints of grain and light pear all come out but you have to search for them to find them. As I take a sip though a clean, crisp and refreshing ale reveals itself, Very nicely done here on the taste. Light, airy, with a light bitter back to it. It had a touch of bite. Nice clean, easy carbonation and light dry finish,"
""
"More hop character than expected, not that its a bad thing. Not a fantastic beer but in this perfect winter city moment, its quite nice."
""
"As with many examples of the style, I find the hops end up blunting the yeast flavors a bit more than I would like; still, a very flavorful, easy drinking beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
"This is way more complex and way more interesting than I anticipated. Unlike some other Ommegang beers, this was a nice surprise. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd say that it was like a lighter, less complex Duvel."
""
""
""
"O: Easily drinkable and very enjoyable. Definitely worth having again."
"O: This is a solid, if slightly one-dimensional, take on the style. In the end, I feel that it is a bit overrated by fans of the brewery. Still, Ommegang comes closer to some of the new wave Belgian pale ales than many other American craft breweries. Worth a try, but a little forgettable."

"O- Delightful beer. I know it was released in spring and Ommegang's site describes it as being a good summer beer ... But it's the day before Thanksgiving and I'm loving it. (Disclaimer: I live in Texas and it's hot outside.)"

"Everything about this beer screams quality. The color is a slightly orange golden with a perfect tall off white head that lasted and clung. The smell is mild citrus mixed with that classic Belgian aroma that is not at all over powering. The taste is again citrusy hop and malt. Finished just about in the middle of sweet and dry The bottle promises perfect balance and they have delivered on the promise. There is a slight alcohol warmth too that adds to the medium body of the mouth feel. One of my new favorites. I think this will be on the table for Thanksgiving dinner."
"An excellent beer, overall"
"O: A pretty great Belgian APA. Manages to balance the yeast and hops into something very drinkable."
"Overall - This is easily one of the best BPAs I have tried. This is a BPA that everyone should give a try. It's not too hoppy, but it's subtle enough for those who aren't normally into hops to enjoy this beer. You can tell alot of love was putting into making this beer; From it's appearence, it's smell, all the way down to it's taste."
"D - A solid Belgian Pale Ale... The nose is exceptional, but the rest of this brew is solidly slightly more than average in all other categories and you know the saying about being only as strong as your weakest link... Solid, respectable, and worthy, but not much more..."
"Kudos Ommegang."
"O - very aromatic and flavourful, a nice blend of belgian and pale ale characteristics that creates its own thing, bright and very easy to drink"
"Overall, this is a fine ale. The Belgian aspects of this beer take it to the next level...there is depth here, and interesting flavors--ranging from the powerful pale pungency, to the down-to-earth farmhouse earthy warmth. This beer is complex, intriguing, and delicious."
"Light-medium mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than one simply because it's not really exceptional. Still enjoyable. Overall, recommended."
"Medium bodied with some tight carbonation and a strong earthy hop presence up front that lingers over the sweeter notes into a dry finish. Slightly floral with some grassy pine and faint citrus fruit complimented by some peppery spice. Only slightly dry but not very bitter. Countered by some pale malt and crisp, light fruit. Overall, the palate is surprisingly full and it's easy to drink but it's not terribly flavorful or interesting."
"I agree with some others that this beer may be overdone - the head, the mustiness. It seems they tried to make a powerhouse version of the Belgian original style and it's a little off."
"D - Highly drinkable Belgian pale ale. Great balance of flavor. Overall, a very enjoyable brew."
"Overall, a decent BPA, but nothing exciting. It is what it is. Fairly average to the style. Fairly decent drinkability."
"O/D - A very solid Belgian Pale Ale. Flavourful and balanced with yeasty esters and hops with a good malt backbone to boot. So very drinkable and tasty. Great, like it alot!"
"O - This was very enjoyable but something about it seemed like it was lacking to me. I felt that the flavor profile seemed watered down."
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite nice - good as a sipper, good with a meal, and quite interesting. I could have another quite easily."
"overall quite a nice bpa, not unexpected from ommegang. delicious!"
"O: Very enjoyable, an easy drinker. I am not familiar with Belgian Pale Ales but will check them out in the future."
"It's no wonder that this is quickly becoming Ommegang's flagship beer. It's delicious, complex, refreshing, and moderately sessionable (at least as far as Ommegang's beers go). This is an awesome beer style that isn't brewed nearly often enough, and this is a fine example. Love it."
"Overall I must say I didn't enjoy this, but it's not the beers fault. It is the style's fault. I only try these when they are free or extras in a trade because I can't stand the Belgian yeast and malt bill flavor. I know I am on the outside with this opinion, but I don't care. I will never trade the cellar for a Westy, cause I promise you I will hate it. Thanks to merc7186 for the extra. I very much appreciate the beer."
"O: i really love this brew and i feel that it has become the standard by which all Belgian pale ales should be measured, such quality and such balance, another beautiful one from ommegang"
"Very Belgian in nature, and it's only my pesky brain telling me that it resembles Unibroue in its homage. Easy to drink if you're in that somewhat down-home, bucolic farm mood that Belgian ale tends to inspires in me."
"O: What can I say, Ommegang does well every time, and this is no exception. Will be glad to buy this one again."
"Medium body with a lot of lively carbonation. A good BPA overall, very refreshing and another solid offering from Ommegang."
"A nice pale golden yellow with a nice long lasting head and good lacing on the pour. Aroma and Taste of citrusy hops, some lemon peel with some sweet fruit spices, some Belgian yeast, and some nice biscuit malt. A nice medium body and crisp mouth feel, and nice carbonation. Finish is sweet citrus hops, lemon peel, sweet fruit spices, some nice Belgian yeast with a nice nutty malty ending for balance. Overall a very nice BPA fruity crisp and refreshing"
"Medium body with a bit less effervescence than one would expect from the head. Finish is fairly drying, though there is a nicely fading grapefruit/pepper/malt aftertaste. Somewhat warming at the back of the throat after it warms for 15 minutes or so.This is a beer that could be sessioned quite easily. All said, a pretty good beer but not the best from Ommegang in my opinion."
"I could drink this again for sure and for 11$ it's reasonable and a welcome addition to Alberta shelves"
"Overall – One of the first Belgian pale ales that I've had that had some of the flavours found in a west coast IPA. It really had a lot of that grapefruit/orange/peach flavour. There was also quite a bit of a hop bitterness, which I enjoyed. I'd buy this beer again any time."
"O- A tasty beer, but as much as I love Ommegang beers, this one was only slightly above par for me"
"O- tastes to me a little more like a belgian ipa, and I love those. This is yet another great offering from a great brewery."
"D - Easy drinking with a nice extra hop presence."
"Pours a muddled golden orange with a lofty, bubbly eggshell head. It smells great, aromas of tangerine and pineapple, some sweet malt, Belgian yeast and lemon meringue. Tastes of bitter lemon and orange peel with some pepper and a hint of clove, the bitter aftertaste is nice. Light with a load of carbonation, very soft bubbles and a dry finish. Wow, I really enjoyed this beer, it might become one of my new regulars."
"Overall: excellent taste and very drinkable. One of the better BPAs."
"O - A great price (I got it for 5.99!) for a very exceptional beer. I love the play between the Belgian and Pale Ale styles, they really help each other out in the best of ways."
"This beer poured a very cloudy yellow color and formed a foamy white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of yeasts,citrus lemon, wheat and pepper. The flavor was of hops, Belgian yeasts, bread and a hint of malt. The body was medium light and the finish bittersweet."
"O-I'm a huge ommegang fan, and this beer doesnt disappoint. Has great belgian pale ale characteristics, a little extra fruit aroma and taste charcteristics, and is well priced for the quality of the beer."
"O - this is a delicious beer, refreshing, with wonderful complexity, a great beer with food"
"Curious about how this would taste in a fresher bottle; I liked it a lot with the hops on the gentler side, as the flavor was really balanced and the bitterness didn't overwhelm the other taste aspects. The carbonation came close to being too much but wasn't, just barely."
"M - Medium body with a nice chew. Very smooth. Light carbonation."
"Appearance is a light golden color with two fingers of white head. The smell of Ommegang`s BPA has sweet malts, spices, orange, grass. While the taste has grains as well as a decent hop profile with some Belgian yeast present as well. MF light-medium, with a similar carbonation level. This is a perfect beer to enjoy a couple glasses of along with a meal."
"Mouth-feel is a light and loose body; it moves uninterrupted over the palate, pushed along with short, crisp carbonation. Finishes very easy."
"Bold and fiery amber/orange. Frothy off-white head the lingers and leaves a curtain down the sides of the glass. Aroma is a strong combination of orange and caramel malt along side some mellow, but balanced, earthy yeast. Tart flavor from the yeast upfront which gives way to the caramel toasty malts. That soon gets washed over by some fruity orange and lemon similar to the nose. Finishes with a earthy yeast bite along with some other character, most likely from hops, I can't recognize. Smooth malty body all the way through with a lot of yeast and hops working together nicely."
"Great brew from Ommegang. I'd recommend for the hotter days, it really quenches."
"Overall a bit of a disappointment for me. Neither the Belgian character nor the west coast hop character comes through in the taste - it seems a bit muddled."
"Overall well done brew, enjoyable and drinkable."
"Overall: quite an enjoyable beer. It doesn't have quite the flavor character I think of when I think of a Belgian-style pale, but I find it good nonetheless."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped PKG on 04/04/11 Best By 04/2012. Sampled on August 20, 2011. It pours straw yellow with a murky, cloudy tone and a bit of sedimentary deposits floating about. The aroma is all encompassing sugar sweet, fruity, and hoppy. The body is bold but also smooth. The taste is also quite sweet with a bit of berries and a clearly dry hopped finish. This is another fine brew from Ommegang."
"Overall this is a very nice Belgian Pale Ale. Hops are subtle and somewhat spicey but really the malts and yeast shine through."
"The Rest: Another solid beer from Ommegang; good balance and a great body. The only fault I can find with this one is that the longer you sit on the finish, the less enjoyable it is."
"excellent american made belgian. not a horrible price ($10 a 4 pack) but not a deal either. i'll get this again."
"O: just a bit bitter, which detracts from the wonderful early tangerine sweetness."
"Another fine entry from Ommegang, and one with more American personality than the label text lets on. Perhaps not their most mindblowing, but definitely satisfying enough. You could knock several of these back on a hot summer day and they'd totally, utterly hit the spot."
"Reccomended"
"Personally I like the Great Divide Belgica and Hades for this kind of style. Or a Saison with more malty interest. This is just quite austere and chalky. Quite a mineral aftertaste."
"O - Most impressive beer I've had from Ommegang. Thanks for the birthday gift."
"A good, easy drinker. Call it very drinkable. Great summertime brew."
"Pours a bright yellow color w/ a nice two finger off white head. Good carbonation and decent lacing on this beer. Smell is that of malt, grains, clove. Smell is definitely on the weak side for this style. Taste is the same profile, and there's just something missing in this brew. It doesn't meet the best in the style for sure. Mouthfeel is on the thin and dry side for this style. It needs to have more substance to it to score higher. Overall, this beer misses the mark on the style. It's not bad, but you can find a lot better examples to drink. Pretty sure I won't pick this one up again. A disappointing beer from a really good brewery."
"On tap at The Bulldog in Minneapolis. Served it it's own glass. This beer arrives a clear orange-gold color. The head is a firm half inch in height, and recedes very slowly leaving nice lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of lemon and orange peel with a hint of barnyard funk. The taste is a lot funkier than the aroma, but not over the top. There are also some nice citrucy notes in the back ground. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice refreshing Belgian Pale Ale. I will happily drink this beer again."
"This pours a yeast hazy light orange color with a foamy head. The smell is semi sweet, I get some banana, cloves and a little bready malts. Feel is medium, lots of tingling sensations and high carbonation. The taste is pretty great, I get a load of fruity sweetness and some bread malts followed by a very nice dryness and a little bitterness. This is a might fine tasting beer and I'll get it again. This is my type of summer beer."
"The palate opens with an unanticipated Bretty clove flavor. This beer has none of the other characteristics you'd expect from a Bretted beer - it didn't gush, there's still some heft to the palate - but that spice character is quite noticeable. Further sips and gulps allow the grapefruit to come to the forefront, along with the chalk to replicate that clove Brett character. Apart from the clove and hops, this beer does have a mild honey flavor before drying out on the finish, leaving flavors of clove, citrus hop and grainy bitterness and just a touch of alcohol. Adding the yeast to the pour adds a little heft to the palate, and increases the spiciness here. Ultimately, this beer is medium-light, crisply carbonated and has an enjoyable finish. Solid stuff, but for the money, I'd rather buy a Duvel."
"O- Thought it was a decent beer but girlfriend couldn't stand it. She wanted to start a profile to describe her feelings for this beer. It seemed unbalanced, maybe it could use more of a citrus presence or a bigger malt profile, but some of the flavors didn't mix well in my opinion."
"The pale ale taste is subtle but interesting. It has a hoppy character along with the mild belgian yeast taste. I would never refust one of these but I will not necessarily seek them out either."
"It's an interesting beer with a complex mouthfeel. The taste isn't what I expected, but that doesn't mean it's bad."
"Overall: Drinkable obviously. Packed with flavor, high on complexities. The subtle note of Cascade hops works in the dry hopping. Recommended."
"Estery with a pillow for a bubble cap. Hoppy nose, bottle says, ""Cascade."" I'll take their word for it. Dry, bitter, metallic and with a bit of raisin on the tongue. ""Bottle conditioned", speaks the bottle again. I like that, makes for a nice fluffy bubble. Alcohol seems a bit much at times, but I butch up and deal with it every time."
"O: Not at all what I expected but very enjoyable. Like a hefeweizen/champagne hybrid gone horribly right."
"O - The scent and appearance are extremely good on this particular BPA, but the mouthfeel seems to mute some of the tastes that I think would otherwise be more apparent, and I was a bit disappointed that the yeast and malt didn't play a bigger role. If you're a champagne fan, however, this is the ideal beer for you."
"O- Another expertly crafted brew from Ommegang. At 6.2% abv, this beer is sessionable; and, so far as the taste and medium body are concerned, it would be great for just about any food pairings."
"O: Overall pretty good, I like it, but don't find I have that much to say. I'd pick up another."
"Overall: Quite enjoyable. More complex as it warms in the glass. Lots going on."
"I didn't know this came in 12oz bottles. Picked up a single to try since I usually enjoy Ommegang. The appearance is great but the taste is a little too dry and spicy for me. It would have been interesting to try side by side with Duvel, seems kind of similar to me."
"Notes: This is a rock-solid beer! Balanced, with moderate body and a ton of flavor. Very drinkable, and perfect for a hot Summer evening. This is definitely one of my favorite brews that Ommegang has to offer."
"Honey colored and cloudy. White foamy head. Banana taffy, apricot, and alcohol line the estery but fairly dull nose. Belgain yeast aroma distinctive. Medium-to-light body. Carbonation is the same. Texture is a little slick. It's a nice offering from Ommegang. I pleasant Belgian take on an American standard. My only qualms would be with the texture and carbonation levels. But otherwise, very tasty."
"D: This had a very nice scent and taste and body. Great example of the style, and very easy to drink. Perfect on a summer evening - light and refreshing, yet enough tasty flavors to keep it interesting. Recommended."
"D: Very drinkable, one of my absolute favorite BPA's to date. (I'm still learning more about the style and will be trying many more) Highly recommended to those that may hesitate to drink Belgian beers or are looking for a way to dip their feet into the fray."
"An average, simple, Belgian pale. There are better options at similar price ranges."
"D - Avery tasty Belgium Ale, I like the balance and the various tastes that weave their way through each sip."
"overall: not bad for the style, obviously more hoppy than the style suggests, but im pretty sure thats what they were going for. i had this on tap about half a year ago or so, and its just a touch better on tap than in the bottle."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with two fingers of foamy white head that retains and laces magnificintly. The aroma has notes of sweet malt and piney citrusy hops. The taste starts with caramel maltiness and then becomes citrusy. The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated, but finishes clean. Overall a great beer."
"overall: prime example of a Belgian-style pale ale, well-hopped, Belgian aspects aren't forced, very mellow."
"Drink- A well done beer. Looks amazing in the glass, smells and tastes good. Refreshing and great flavored. Again a mash up of styles that blends and works together without one ingredient over powering another."
"O: Great summer BPA. Nothing too strong or complex but it's a well balanced and refreshing beer for sure."
"Drink and overall: Good overall BPA. Hoppy. Dry. Zesty. So, flavorful. Little dry for me."
"Overall Ommegang does it again and I wish I could find this cheaper than 3 dollars a bottle since I would like to have this again. Will have to see the price of a six pack at my local beer place (must be around 12-14 dollars)"
"O: This is an elegant pale ale that really does justice to his type. It has wonderful citrus and spice that is complimented by a mild and complex bitterness."
"O- I will definitely try one of these if they are around, but I really need that sassy belgiam yeasty when I select a bpa"
"Definitely an ale worth trying from Ommegang."
"O: A good version of the style which provides an ample dose of maltiness, hoppiness, and Belgian yeast estery quality all in one package. I had Surly Cynic Ale for the first time last week and enjoyed it a lot more, but this is much more widely available and does a good job of representing the balance of the style."
"Nothing spectacular, but good and drinkable."
"O- Good, but be careful transporting and opening it."
"This beer pours out as a hazy golden colored ale, the head was fluffy and white. There was some nice lacing on the glass also. The smell of the beer has some decent aromas of grains, hops and yeast. The taste of the beer is a little sweet upfront that fades into a nice bread like flavor and finishes with a hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel isn't too heavy or carbonated it's a good feel to it. Overall it's a pretty nice Belgian Pale Ale."
"Light mouthfeel that goes down easy. Reminds me of a spicy white wine in some respects and would combine well with many food combinations. Very interesting brew that is worthy of a try."
"Be careful when opening it - my sample popped like a champagne bottle and fizzed from here to California, and I’m in Georgia right now! Aroma is mainly fruity, rather crisp with a hint of malt. It pours a slightly hazy solar yellow with a thick, frothy, rather persistend white head that leaves considerable lacing. Flavor is crisp, more fruity than malty, with a woody overtone, and both bitter and sweet hints that balance each other nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and just a little fizzy, leaving a fruity and hoppy finish."
"MO- With this much great flavor I think the feel is a little thin. Overall this is a great beer. I had it on tap a while back and I am glad to say it is just as good out of the bottle."
"Overall this is a nice BPA, light and very enjoyable."
"O: This was okay, but nowhere near as good as some of the other Ommegang beers I've had."
"UPDATE (9/5/11): Had this super-fresh at the brewery recently, and I have to say that when the hops are freshest, they have a very bright, bitter presence that really turns it into a somewhat different beer; it's good to very good if the hops have faded a bit, but very good to excellent when they're bright and fresh!"
"Drinkability is good. A good BPA but not one I will buy again."
"A well-made BPA with hops and yeast showing over the malt (though it is enough to be noticeable). A dry BPA - nice, especially on a warm day. This should be a ""regular"" rather than a ""limited"" edition, IMO."
"D-Decent thirst quenching brew with a bit of complexity."
"Nothing out of the ordinary here — Ommegang makes good Belgian-style beer. BPA is a smooth, thirst-quenching beverage."
"O - I thought this beer was alright. It got a little better as it warmed but it almost tasted watered down. I'll probably pass buying another bottle. Would like to see if it improves a little on tap."
"Overall - This is a rather refreshing brew with lots of subtle complexities. It is a nice hot day brew when you want something that will refresh but still offers something more."
"O- very good easy to drink refreshing and tasty ..very recommended"
"Pours a golden color with a big pillowy head which recedes to a tight head and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy with hints of citrus and a nice sweat smell to it. The smell is a little subdued. The taste has a nice yeasty sweetness along with belgian spiciness. In the middle comes a citrus hop bite. The bite is subtle. There is more citrus than hop at the back end. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall its a good beer it is mainly spicy and yeasty with hints of other flavors it solid but nothing left me needing more."
"O: I like this a little more on tap but out of the bottle it great, balanced and simple."
"O: This beer impressed the hell out of me. I wasn't really even looking to have a Pale Ale when I had it, but Ommegang is a fantastic brewery from my experiences so I couldn't resist. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone regardless of the style of beer they favor. I'd give this beer a very confident two thumbs up."
"O: Very good. Enjoyable."
"Drunkability: Good summer drink, bit too fruity to drink multiples."
"Hazey honey color with 45 feet of head. It's running down the side of my glass actually. As the head subsides it kinda looks like swiss cheese as holes develop in the froth. Very little to no lacing. Sediment is suspended throughout. Spicy citrus on the nose. The banana bread smell that all Belgians seem to have for me. Taste consists of citrus and spice mixed with banana bread. Pretty much horrible. Can't stand Belgians. I picked out the taste notes, but really it tastes like an old gym sock. I was hoping that the pale ale part of the beer would save this for me. Sadly it was all around fail."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are really nicely balanced and work together very nicely. Everything works together nicely, and the banana flavor mixed in is really nice."
"O: A decent beer, but unfortunately the wonderful complexities of aroma don't translate very well to the flavors. It smells amazing but the flavors do not meld well at all."
"Overall I think this is a good beer but being personally overwhelmed with lupulin lately I can't say this is as ""Belgian-esque"" as I would have wanted. I pictured more clove, spices, banana, coming through and all I got was a normal tasting Pale Ale. Respectable beer, just sort of sounds like their marketing this beer to both Belgian lovers and Pale Ale lovers with the end result of a beer for Pale Ale lovers."
"Well, color me impressed considering this is a bit over one year old and has held up quite well. Couldn’t pass up the single on the discount rack for 99 cents, definitely will seek out a fresh sample and update this review then."
"Decent brew but would like a touch more bitterness. A little sweet as is."
"This beer impressed the heck out of me. I really enjoyed the hop character, which was strong but not to the point of being a Belgian IPA. This was something completely different from what I was expecting (a weak tripel) and I'm almost disappointed that I only got a 12 oz. bottle instead of the 750 ml one. Highly recommended."
"D - Very balanced and drinkable. I tend to savor Ommegang brews though."
"Pours a hazy burnt sienna, with a finger of white head; decent lacing. Light hops in the aroma, citrus and spice. Light tasting, good balance of citrus hops and sweet malts, with a touch of spice. Light-medium mouthfeel. Nice, crisp, easily drinkable, even if it's not overflowing with flavor."
"O: This is fantastic domestic Belgian style beer. Great flavours, blind I could believe this is Belgian-made which is always a plus. Well done Ommegang."
"O- not as hoppy as i was hoping for. this seems stuck somewhere in between a belgian style beer and an american style one. not offensive, but also not something ill be picking up again."
"the CPJ"
"Taste is very crisp an clean with a nice spiciness from the yeast. There's a pretty creamy thick mouthfeel. Overall it's very easy drinking and tasty."
"Overall - It's not dominant in any flavor profile, but hey, it's refreshing. I finished playing soccer in 90 degree weather and this sure looked good in my fridge. Hit the spot for refreshment."
"O: Definitely not Belgian, but a good representation of an Americanized Belgian ale. A bit surprised at the warming alcohol at only 6.2%, but it was a welcomed bonus. Overall a solid ale and worth the price."
"Whatever this is, it is a joy to drink. After finishing my glass, I kept thinking of Eisenbahn Pale Ale, which is what BPA reminds me of most."
"All in all, a nice example of a great style. I would definitely drink a couple of these with a nice dinner."
"I had this one on tap before dinner at a local Irish style pub in Temecula, California. Poured a nice dark golden color with a good white head. Aromas of spicy/peppery hops, a little floral and some caramel. On the palate, light to medium bodied and deliciously drinkable, with more fruity/peppery/floral hops and some caramel malt. Very good, although not very Belgian."
"An enormous, lumpy, thick crown of white foam tops a clear golden brew. Orange zest and herbal hop notes blend with sweet spice and coriander. Light and effervescent in the mouth. Grassy, herbal hop bitterness, spicy esters, citrus, and peppery phenolic flavors. Very crisp and drinkable. Light pale malt sweetness lurks beneath. Obviously Belgian-inspired, but with nods to the brewery's true home with the use of Columbus and Cascades. I'll be buying more of this in the fast-approaching, long NC summer!"
"O-On the nice summer/spring day, this beer hit the spot. Light and refreshing, with enough hops to remind you that you are drinking a beer."
"jd"
"Hazy golden body topped by giant frothy white head. Aroma of citrus, tropical fruit, grass, sharp pine notes. Some good flavors here: citrus, orange peels, kiwi, echo of wheat, hop bitterness and dryness towards the finish with a yeasty character that lingers. Medium bodied with heavy zapping carbonation. Highly drinkable and refreshing with a superb balance of hops and Belgian yeast flavor."
"Overall: A fine Belgianesque beer with enough hops to make a real difference in flavor and bitterness. Nicely avoids over spicing, but is a little bit over-carbonated. Bordering 4.5"
"wonderful nose on this. drinks like a belgian ipa. i feel like the cascade here may be a slight mis-step. there is a slight cloying/astringent element to the hop profile. otherwise, a nice beer i would definitely have again."
"Overall: A nice Belgian-inspired beer where the hops and yeast steal the show. The alcohol is up there, though not entirely disproportionate. Still, I appreciate the 12-ounce portion, instead of having to drain an entire bomber bottle."
"Pours a golden color with a dense white head. There's some chill haze going on but it's still pretty nice looking. Smell is yeast driven, despite the dry-hopping efforts. Clove, spice and orange make up the bulk of the nose with a mild floral note. Palate is sweet and spicy. Fruity esters and spicy flavors are backed by a modest malt profile. The citrus hops are prevelant but this is more Belgian than American for sure. Mouthfeel is very lively. Lots of carbonation with a semi-dry finish. Another solid effort from Cooperstown."
"Light but full flavor. Doughy bread, pears, white grapes, and earthy/herbal hops. Leaves a nice dry and tangy finish."
"O: Very drinkable. Lots of different flavors going on here, but it all works together."
"o: a great little bpa, awesome yeasty phenolic character, balanced and drinkable"
"o: Overall I enjoyed the smell more than the taste. That clove at the end just wore me down. Not bad, but I expected more from Ommegang."
"If it weren't for the price, this would be in heavy rotation all spring and summer."
"Nothing extraordinairy here, but still a pretty solid beer from Ommegang."
"This is my kind of Belgian Pale Ale! It's not that Brewery Ommegang can't do wrong in my eyes, it's that they *haven't*. Among all their year-round offerings and the always expanding limited releases (the vast majority of which I've tried), every single damn one of them seems to be a world class example of the style and all around top-notch beer."
"Opinion- i enjoyed this beer, a very well done BPA"
"O: Crisp, clean refreshing brew with a hint of belgian spice. Interesting and glad I tried it."
"O - Fantastic! I could drink this thing all summer and be plenty happy. Great representation of the style and thoroughly enjoyable!"
"Not as much depth on the tongue as I'd like, but otherwise it is solid, with funk and fruit and mellow bread tones. Good mouthfeel rounds out this all around excellent beer. As far as value, I can get Trappist beers for this price, but I would recommend this one as worth trying."
"O- A decent beer that is light and crisp."
"All and all a very drinkable beer, quite refreshing."
"An interesting though not gratifying beer from Ommegang. I guess I would expect a better beer, something with more pronounced yeast notes and a cleaner and brighter flavor. This brew is easy and unobtrusive, though perhaps to a fault. I generally prefer this brewery's offerings bottle conditioned though I don't envision an improvement here as the pour was the best aspect and not lacking whatsoever."
"Bought a 1/6 barrel for my kegerator. I should preface this review by saying that I was compromising with my wife on something because I wanted her to enjoy it too, as I usually like hop-heavy brews. And she loves it. It's good to me; just not distinctly memorable (although I remember every barrel I try in my kegerator). That being said, it's smooth, like a Belgian Sierra Nevada, so its drinkability is excellent."
"D: very drinkable, I would, and maybe will, have another. I had his one in the past and had a bad experience (super acidic and off tasting, maybe a bad pour). This one was perfect for a summer afternoon (or Spring), well-balanced and unshowy. I think this might be my favorite Ommegang, wasn't a huge fan of theirs but this has made me a believer."
"Probably my favorite Ommegang at this point and I especially enjoyed how easy it was to drink. Sometime with Belgian beers the flavor and/or alcohol presence can make them more of a sip slowly and appreciate kind of beer. BPA has a little less of that overpowering alcohol flavor and a very mellow balanced body that makes it excellent to drink a few with friends or pair with a meal."
" The flavor is fairly dry with subtle Belgian yeast and light tropical flavor from the combo of yeast and hops w/ mild spice and lemony tang which goes well with the herbal elements of the hops. The taste has a light astringency and mild phenolic quality w/ subtle pineapple hint w/ gently bitter citrus with mild dry malt accenting into the semi-dry finish. This is a very drinkable beer and very good Belgian Pale ale in general, I prefer the bottle conditioned version personally, but there is plenty of citrus hop flavor and the drinkability is high overall."
"The palate echoes the nose, a grippy tasty tangy brew with a dry lingering hint of bitterness in the finish. They nailed the style but brought it into an American mode. Love it!"
"Well balanced and refreshing, BPA is a great interpretation of a true Belgian-style Pale Ale. At 6.2% ABV, this beer is extremely sessionable and pairs well with lighter fare -- in my case a grilled chicken salad with bacon and pears."
"OVERALL GRADE: B+/A-"
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer and a good example of this style. The nose is a bit like a Tripel-lite, but the flavor is true to style. This disconnect made it a bit unusual for me, but I'm not going to have any trouble finishing this beer as a result or anything. I'll get over it. As for you?...try this beer if you like Belgian beers...you won't be disappointed."
"Applauded for its clean yet conservative execution, the beer seemingly has no flaws. But the rich malt character keeps the beer from showcasing the yeasty spice and fruit flavors with the zeal that is demonstrated by other Belgian pale ales. The hop character balances in the finish, but struggles to do so from initial sips until just before the dryish finish. Another tasty beer by Ommegang, just conservative."
"D - Easily drinkable. This beer packs in a ton of flavor but it's not overwhelming."
"D - This is a really tasty Belgian-style ale."
"Poured WAY fizzy, nice light amber, kind of hazy and soapy foam. Smelled great, hoppy with grassy wheat noted. Tasted similar to smell with tongue tickling bubbles and wheaty finish. Felt good and drank wonderful. It was a pleasant beer but I wouldn't really seek it out again."
"I didn't know quite what to expect, Ommegang has been hit or miss for me in the past but at the first sip, I was impressed. A slight hoppy flavor, some what earthy to coppery I'd say, followed by a sweet malty finish, perfectly balanced. The hoppiness lingers just enough to keep all the flavors together, making sure it's not too bitter or too sweet. Nothing I love more than a that perfect balance of sweet and hoppy. I definitely will have keep an eye out for more Cooperstown brews in the future, this BPA has me convinced about them."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style but with a little more hops that you usually get, this is a very good Belgian-style beer a lot of flavor and substance making it worth drinking for a long time."
"On-tap at the Office in Montclair. Was not whole-heartedly impressed with this offering from Ommegang. Although their artful American-depictions of Belgian-inspired brews are typically precise and on-point, I myself did not reckon this to be an accurate rendition of the style nor a highly drinkable brew despite the modest ABV. Very spritzy and carbonated, on-tap yielding a faint amber-to-golden hue with visible carbonation and a medium-bodied head. Faint aroma of of yeast noticeable with a sugar-sweet mouthfeel. Nothing to write home about."
"A crisp pale orange. Good head. Leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is probably a combination of Columbus and Cascade hops. Just guessing since my homebrew belgian pale has those. It bit earthy and citrusy. The taste is a nice blend of hops, malts and a bit of spice. The beer is very smooth for a 6% pale. Very enjoyable and drinkable. I will certainly have this one again."
"Overall: Close to perfect. An excellent blend of Belgian styles and Pale Ales. I'm glad this will become a year round offering, because I need more of it."
"Poured from the corked bomber into my Duvel tulip. Copper golden color with awesome fluffy head and decent lacing. You can tell Duvel's influence. Piney citrusy smell not normally associated with the Belgian style. Good taste and a nice hoppy front end. I got more IPA from this than BPA. It should be named PAB perhaps. Mouthfeel was nice and drinkability was average."
"On-tap at The Pit served in a 10oz tumbler a crisp pale orange with a thin diminishing head that leaves just a trace of lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight Earthy citrus hops and a hint of spice. The taste is a nice blend of citrus hops, sweet malts and crisp spice. The beer is quite light, crisp and oh so smooth. This is a very enjoyable Belgian brew, one I would certainly have again."
"Part of a generous gift from engagechad. Elegant looking 750ml corked bottle, poured into an Ommegang glass. Came with a description of how to pour. and the proper serving temperature (40 f). Cork went skyrocketing across the room. Pours a pale yellow color with a monster of a head, color and thinness are a bit lackluster. Aroma is much,much better. Belgian yeast hits the nose first, along with citrussy hops, grapefruit, and biscuit. A great combination of Belgian and American styles in the aroma. Lots of breadiness in the taste, with some bitter hops, and citrus fruit. It'ss surprisingly bitter. Lighter body, moderate carbonation and a good bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is outstanding, i could sip this all night and feel refined while doing so. Great beer and worth a try."
"Good body and carbonation, but drinkability suffers because it just doesn't taste that great."
"Drinkability: This is one tasty beer and has become one of my favorites to enjoy anytime."
"D) A delicious Belgian Pale Ale. Definitely drink more!"
"On tap at Citizen Public House in the Fenway. Served in a standard pint glass. Very bright orange-yellow color. Thick white head on top, with some good lacing. Smell has a piney aroma to it. I liked the flavor of this beer a lot. It had a wonderfully light hop flavor that melded well with a splash of sugar sweetness. Mouthfeel was substantial but smooth. Really easy beer to drink. This brew would easily appeal to both the lovers of Belgian ales and Pale Ale devotees. A great offering from Ommegang."
"This is another good one from Ommegang."
"Had this on tap at MacGregors Penfileld. Body is a gorgeous Gold-Orange color with a half inch beige colored head. Aroma is peppery and flowery. Smells fruity and yeasty with a decent amount of hop flavor. This pretty hoppy for a Belgian pale ale considering that its not considered a Belgian IPA. Fruitiness has slightly metallic quality. Kinda bitter in a weird way. The feel is tingly and slightly dry. This is a decent beer but I can't help but be a little disappointed from Ommegang with this one."
"D - Very drinkable"
"D: A wonderful beer. Most of the Belgian PAs I've had haven't been as fresh as this, and this strikes me as a style where freshness is a definite plus. The only drawback is the price."
"d: pretty drinkable. I would be more willing to drink a few of these than some American IPAs ;)"
"Overall, I'm very impressed by this Belgian Pale Ale. This is perhaps the most interesting Belgian Pale I've had and its among the best Ommegang brews I've had, and that certainly says something. After almost getting through their entire line up, I'm realizing that Ommegang is an amazing New York brewery! I would definitely try this. Cheers!"
"Medium body, higher carbonation, somewhat dry but not overdone; pretty accurate for the style. Smooth, refreshing drinking, although this is probably better in the spring/summer."
"D- Very drinkable, a few of these would go down well on a warm day."
"Overall, the flavors of the beer were quite pleasant and the beer was well rounded. This was a nice and light beer in comparison to other Ommegang offerings. Definitely worth buying, I know I'll get it again."
"I like this ale. The aroma and flavors are completely different than any beer I've had before. I recommend you give this a try. So far it's my favorite from the Ommegang sample pack."
"D- Good Belgian Pale Ale. Not as forward in the flavor profile as some of the others I have had, but nonetheless a good beer."
"D - Fairly easy drinking but very, very dry."
"Must. Buy. Again."
"High drinkability as it went down easy with a long bitter lingering finish that was very tasty. This is a session beer to me as I could drink this all night or with a meal anytime."
"Off tap at Grami this beer was a clear golden color with a one finger-thick cap of khaki-colored foam. The retention of the head was good and the lacing impressive in bands that streaked like curtains all the way down my glass. The aroma was of candi sugar, spicy hops, some floral notes, caramel malt, crystal malt and a touch of honey. The flavors were excellent for the style and very much like the aroma in every way. Sweetness from Belgian candi sugar first hit me but buried beneath that was caramel malt, spices, complex Belgian yeast all leading up to a definitive, yet not heavy handed, hoppy finish. Clean. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation light."
"D: The mouthfeel and taste would typically lead to an extremely drinkable. Something about the finish throws me off a little though. I really did enjoy this beer though."
"D- Quite."
"Ommegang Brewery--BPA--Belgian-style Pale Ale--Dry Hopped--Limited Edition--2010 25.4 oz. Bottle. 6.20% ABV. 55 IBU's? (3.75 / 5.0) New Style? IPA BPA CDA? Huge pillowy white foam lace head. Big Bottle Conditioned Sediment. Cloudy fizzy bright orange color. Aromatic Cascade dry hop mild Belgian ester front. Thin textured dry crisp zesty too fizzy Belgian fruit mild citrus refreshing Pale malt body. Balanced hop spice citrus end. Sampled 12/24/2010. Purchased for $7.99 @ Whole Foods--Magnolia, Seattle on 4/21/2010."
"Purchased a bottle of this from Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. Into a stemmed Stone IPA glass, it poured a translucent, highly-carbonated golden copper, with three fingers of white, that retained and laced well. Smelled of apple and pear; fragrant, but not very bitter or herbal at all. The taste was very floral in nature; big apple flavor with a thin dry bitter finish. Very thin, highly-carbonated feel. Not a very dynamicly-flavored beer to being with, and the poor texture just killed it for me. As such, I didn't find this to be very sessionable."
"Reviewed on 3/28/2010. Bottle. Pours a cloudy light orange with a thick white head. Aroma of light citrus hops, light fruits, orange peel, Belgian yeast, and bready malts. Flavor of sweet fruits and Belgian yeast with some citrusy hops in the finish. Not overly hopped but rather the hops blend well with the base beer. Quite enjoyable!"
"Pours a nice golden straw color with big pillowy white head. Nose and flavor are pretty congruent: yeast, pears/apples, light malt, and some nice spice notes. MF is light but not spritzy, easy drinker here. Not a perfect example of the style, but definitely enjoyable!"
"This beer is dry and epervesent and a little chalky (not in a bad way). A little less drinkable than one would think in a 6% beer."
"D: The beer is very drinkable, especially considering its relatively low alcohol content."
"Since I'm not that much of a wine drinker this would be an excellent choice to a BYOB."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this beer. Sweet, fruity flavors present, but the spice really cuts it and provides a nice contrast. Really zesty and refreshing to drink."
"D - excellent. Well balanced and flavorful. My only wish is that I could find it in 12 oz bottles."
"This would be a fantastic food beer, so more's the pity I haven't anything better than frozen pizza. Better than that, it's an excellent drinking beer. I'm a bigger fan of Ommegang's heartier ales, but this was a fine attempt at the style. Only drawback is the flavor thins out much too early, leaving me wanting."
"Not Ommegangs best, but I will continue to buy and drink more. It is a good value when put on sale at the local grocery store- Wegmans."
"D: Quite good here. Not sessionable because the malts and hops are not balanced enough, but still plenty good."
"Fairly dry. Tastes good but nowhere near as flavorful as the aroma would indicate. Bready malt with golden pear and apricot sweetness offset a menthol, herbal hop character. Mouthfeel fells heavy."
"Great balanced taste with nice carbonation and mouth feel. Alcohol is medium strength and drinkable. Drinkable in the Duvel catagory. This stuff is good."
"D- Really good and easy to drink. Not quite sure how often I'd drink this one but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"D: an awesome offering from ommegang at a fair price. A great beer and a quick re buy"
"D- This is a very good BPA overall. Its drinkable, almost sessionable, and full of flavor. Another fantastic brew by Ommegang-one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall-well done, a unique beer, not sure it's worth all of the considerable hype it's gotten but Ommegang is continuing to make great beer. Cheers."
"D-good, but like with all Ommegang offerings, this is not for sessiining,,,"
"Notes - This beer kept me on my toes the whole time, but sometimes the surprises held me back from enjoying it for what it is. Still, a very nice BPA that's well worth revisiting."
"Notes: At 6.2ABV, probably not the best session beer but one of the best pale ales that I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"Refreshing light-medium body with tight carbonation."
"D: Well rounded, with a nice start to finish. A really nice savoring brew, that is a nice stylistic take."
"Initial whiff brings some nice notes of peach and light tropical fruits as well as a bit of light pepper. A bit of very light floral hops comes through as well. Some very mild earthy must in there as well. The taste is some light stone fruits as well as a bit of must and spice. Body is a bit light with low-to-moderate carbonation levels. Glad to have finally gotten ahold of this, but not my favorite."
"This tasted very good - a nice balance of bitter and sweet to keep things interesting. First time I have tried the style it was interesting having an assertive bitterness with the belgian sweetness. I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Interesting BPA... bought in a three pack sampler from Costco Delaware for $19. For that price... its worth stocking up."
"Drinkability: Drinkable indeed. Not overly complex that it requires careful sipping, but not a simple chugger either. Very respectable brew."
"D: The light body and relatively low ABV make this beer an easy drinker. The flavor has a nice complexity that grows as it warms."
"one of the few bottle that made it out to poland while i was there and unfortunately one of the least successful i've had by this brewery. a nice head of white on a golden mildly cloudy body. nose is dominated by citrus ans sugarcane. this was a beer with a one dimensional palate of pineapple candy that would sit on the tongue and not clear like expected by a exceptional BPA. had a similar lack of zest as an old hennipen. palate was lemon tea overly sweet, pineapple, and a mild apple tart then a finish of a wave of sweetness that lingered."
"Brewery Ommegang Belgian-style Pale Ale has impressive packaging and looks even more impressive after it's poured. From that point forward, though, it approaches mediocrity... without quite getting there. Allagash would have hit something like this out of the park."
"D- Drinkability is ridiculously good. If this stays around, it may be my Go-To beer."
"D: Highly palatable and highly drinkable. I'll purchase the BPA every time it is released."
"Moderately carbonated over a light feeling brew. Pleasant lingering herbal hops stick and last inside the mouth. I've never been a huge fan of Belgian pales but this one is nice."
"This beer is extremely well executed, but the sour and bitter flavors are a little over powering for my taste."
"Some prickly carbonation on the tongue, but in general the mouthfeel is on the watery side. I could drink more of this, but I don't think I'll make an effort to seek it out again."
"Had a few samples of this at last weekends Steel City Big Pour, when I saw bottles of it at D's afterward I was inspired to grab a bottle for myself. Pours a beautiful slightly hazed glowing golden amber hue. Bright off white head forms large bubbles nice and thick four finger depth with chunk scattered lacing. Aroma contains sharp citric, deep floral, and tropical fruit juice. Dry acidic note tickles the nares along with spicy yeast layer, pale biscuit malts bring some mild bready edges. Overall flavor is excellent, I don't think Ommegang does much wrong. Fruity citrus/mango infused mix of hop notes, dry bitterness rules but spicy yeast and biscuit malt with a hint of caramelization balances enough to make this incredible. Mouthfeel is effervescent, dry finish ample sturdy bitterness throughout a beautiful experience that I plan to experience again. Drinkability overall was great a top notch version of a rarely well done style at least here in the US micro brewing scene...been excited to try this since I heard about it."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, small tart, small fruit, and dry malt. In the taste, earth and tart, with a nice small hop presence. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry yeast presence in the aftertaste. Dry hops and small tart, I can dig it!!"
"D: Very high. This is much lighter than I expected, but the ABV will pack a punch after a few. For one of the last hot days of the summer, this was a good choice."
"Notes: I am glad to see some more brews being bottled from Ommegang even if they are only limited releases. I really liked the BPA and hope it will become a yearly release."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is thick with a nice biting carbonation, and this beer proves you do not need to be 10+% to make a solid Belgian beer."
"Notes: An interesting offering from one of my favorite American Breweries (this is my 14th Brewery Ommegang review) whose bitterness drives down my enjoyment, the feel and, ultimately, its drinkability."
"This is definitely a lighter pale ale with a slightly higher ABV than usual. I do enjoy the dry hopping that this beer received; it is a great improvement and gives what would be a weak pale ale some backbone. This beer is definitely better as a summer/spring seasonal with the citrus. The BPA is highly drinkable and I would not mind getting it again."
"D- I want to drink this all day. I'd get a case of this in a heartbeat if I found one for a decent price, and I doubt it would last very long."
"The next in this series is called Tripel Perfection, and is undoubtedly a Belgian style tripel. I will also be looking for one of those for a summer afternoon."
"Overall an ok brew. My first from Ommegang. Looking forward to trying others."
"Mild smell, mild taste, mild color, mild beer. This pale golden ale poured with a lovely white head of compact bubbles punctuated by larger clusters of bubbles. The nose has strong malt character with a mild floral aroma underneath. The taste is crisp, dry, and refreshing with a slightly hoppy finish. It would make a good session beer, but it's a little boring for my taste."
"Drinkability: this beer was very easy to quaff and satisfied the tastebuds. Great beer from Ommegang."
"Drinkability - Simple, well balanced, and easy to drink. Can't explain it any better."
"D: Exceptionally smooth going down making for a wonderful experience. A big beer with session like quality and smoothness and only a modest show of the 6.2%abv that only adds to the overall flavor."
"Drinkability is huge. Sessionable it is not, but I could polish off a couple 750s in a sitting with little problem. This honestly might be my favorite Ommegang beer at this point. I'm pretty stoked that it's being worked into the regular lineup."
"Ommegang has been surprising me a lot lately. I have always liked their beers, but the last few I have had I will get again and again."
"After a long day at the office, this was really nice to come home to. Would definitely have this one again. Well done, Ommegang."
"Mouthfeel is light with great carb. A nice finish and feel. No noticeable alcohol at all. I polished this off myself quite easily. Now that this is going to be year round, I can see it being a staple of my BPA choices. Very nice new offering from Ommegang!"
"The beer pours a hazy golden orange color with a white head. Thea aroma is yeast, lemons, oranges and alcohol. The flavor is very similar. I get notes of grassy hops, yeast and oranges. The beer is very hoppy for a beer of this style. The bitterness is low to medium and the hop flavor is very apparent. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I really love this beer for a new offering from Ommegang it's a ale worth trying."
"Poured a golden body with good head and lace around the glass and had a clean aroma of sweet malt and some belgian yeast strain. Taste is more of the same as the there is a mix of caramel and candy malt as well as that belgian yeast/orange touch; also other fruits like banana or pear or apples (they fall on the sweet side) or grape skin. Medium body that is slightly chewey/bready that finishes dry thanks to hops and carbonation and has a little bit of peppery spice as well. An easy to drink and very good pale ale to have."
"Drinkability was good...a summertime Belgian. I drank the bomber and would have liked more. I haven't had a bad Ommegang beer yet!!!"
"D: Awesome! I wish I had picked this up when my store first got it. I will drink this again. A good hot summer's day drink."
"Corked and caged 750. Cloudy orange colour with an inch and a half, fluffy cap of eggshell colored foam. The head fell quickly to a thin layer, then stuck around for a while. A little bit of spotty lacing, but this wasn't long lived. Spicy and phenolic aroma initially, but this mellowed quickly to let other characters come forward - malty bread and yeast, grapefruit, pears. Crackery as it warmed with additional citrus. Moderate bitterness with juicy citrus, sort of a combination of grapefruit, lemon, and orange. Bready, wheat crackers, a bit of tart fruitiness. Mild clove spice and peppery tingle in the finish. Ample carbonation with a medium body, dry, nice texture. Refreshing and tasty. Seems like more of a Belgian IPA rather than a BPA, but either way it's good."
"D - with another dimension of hop flavor, this could be outstanding. still very quenching and drinkable. this one can really hit the spot if the mood strikes."
"Drinkability: A good Americanized BPA. Not the best, but solid. I think I enjoyed it more on draft when I was drinking without reviewing."
"I enjoy most Ommengang brews but expected more out of this limited release. Definately not the best BPA out there-decent at best."
"BPA is a pretty impressive Belgian Pale. I like the flavor quite a bit. It has an interesting mix of hops and typical Belgian Pale characteristics. It works. I can't say it's at the top of the Belgian Pale style, but it's good stuff. I don't have any real complaints about it. It appeared to be overcarbonated, but it doesn't taste or feel like it so much. No reservations recommending this one. Go grab one!"
"taste is slightly dry, banana, yeast, some spice, and fresh hops, ends a little thick, and dry."
"On tap 15 months later, and about the same."
"Drinkability- Ughhh high. Very high. I could easily go for a couple 750s of this or few drafts at my local watering hole. (Looking at you Flying Saucer)"
"Overall, Ommegang BPA is a very interesting Pale Ale. Although most of their products do lean more towards Belgian beers, this one is more relatable to and American Pale Ale. With that said it is super crisp and refreshing, and definitely a very sessionable offering from Ommegang."
"Beer is sweet and slightly dry. Not bitter but nice in the midpalate and good esters giving off the illusion of fruits in my mouth. I wish it wasn't as dry as it is but overall its a nice good beer. I would drink it again."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking pale ale. One I would recommend to those impartial to hops. Mellow and good."
"Basic Belgian ale"
"T--It has an interesting corn-ish taste. Nice hoppiness and a kind of sweet caramel with a floral undetone. It's very carbonated and quite refreshing."
"D: easy to drink this 6.2% too bad its a limited and total wine limited release, its the first Ommegang i feel really hits the true in the Belgian style of, for an american beer, and I don't say that very much."
" D- This beer has a nice blend of yeasty flavors and citrusy hops with are nice and complex themselves. This is a great session beer especially in the warmer months."
"This just became available in Denver and i couldn't wait to try it. This beer pours a cloudy golden honey color with a alrge foamy white head with fine bubbles. The nose was huge on the orange and corriander but you also get some note of lemon zest and yeast. On the palate you immediately get honey followed by flavros of orange, bread and some slight spice notes. Overall it was a good beer, it is just a little pricey for what it is."
"This is an exceptional tasting BPA, all it needs is some better estectics and its a ""5" all the way."
"Carbonation is high, as evidence would suggest, and it dries up off of your tongue, leaving you wanting more. The overall light character and smooth flavors make this a fairly easy drinking belgian."
"A beautiful orange/copper color with a small head. Aroma is Belgian yeast but also a little bitter grassy aromas. Taste follows, with some Belgian spices and banana flavors that quickly move into a more bitter grassy taste. This is a nice Belgian to use as a thirst quencher. The bitterness helps move the sweeter spices thru the palate and make this very drinkible."
"The beer is a bazy deep copper color, plenty of fine floating sediment and a huge frothy head, maybe 4 fingers worth. The aroma has the Belgian character, kind of smells like a muted Belgian IPA. It smells a little more bitter than it actually tastes, I think the sweetness from the malts tempers it well. Very balanced, crisp, and dry. Not a sipper but not really a chugger either, just easy drinking goodness."
"D: Big flavor and comlexity yet moderate abv make this surprisingly drinkable."
"The flavor starts off with Belgian spices and orange peel before giving way to a spritzy pale malt note that suggests bread dough and Saltine crackers. The hops come across as citrusy with a hint of pine and florals, while the yeast adds tropical fruit notes. Mouthfeel is crisp, medium-light in body, and almost too carbonated, but bubbly enough to kick in some zest to the palate. BPA is an easy sipper, and one of the better Belgian Pale's I've come across in recent memory. Distinctly American, but holds true to its stylistic roots. Goes great with a rice dish...recommended!"
"Tasted from 750mL bottle. Pours a cloudy tan orange with a thin beige head. Hoppy nose with that signature Belgian yeasty smell that always reminds me of lemon and biscuit. Palate is super mellow with the hops taking a back seat. Lemon zest, biscuit, black pepper, and light hops flavor round out the palate. The carbonation is very high with a sticky texture and a rather short finish. This is an easy drinker that will go great with foods."
"great beer here. Not an all day drinker but something great to have after or during a summer meal amongst friends. The spiciness would add to many types of fare, bbq to thai."
"Another of my inexplicable collection of BPAs in the fridge. Held up the window (trust me, it's sunny out), the lion rampant or turns a sable against a light, hazy, sunset-like tenne (ah, heraldry). The bright, seemingly ermine suds leave a lovely halo etched along the rim while the liquid drains beneath it. Plenty of smells comin' offa this guy, including some banana, cloves, wheat, damp straw, a tiny bit o' soap, flowers, and sweet woodruff. The cloves, woodruff, and soap stage their vengeance on the tongue, along with a hint of pepper and a splash of citrus peel. A bit of spice drfits on into the distance. It's all pretty light and breezy, fitting nicely with the sunniness outside and in the glass. Currently the top of the BPA heap right now."
"I picked up a bottle from Abe's Cold Beer for $9-10 and split it with a couple friends. The beer appeared a slightly hazy amber with a tall white head that left lacing. At first I was struck by the delicate bready malt and candy character, then I was amazed by the citrus and apricot hop flavor. That's quite a pairing of malts and hops in a Belgian pale, but the flavors are expertly balanced and sublimely subtle. Find this beer. It's not quite like anything I've tried straight from Belgium, but there's no doubt about its heritage."
"D= This was a really pleasant surprise. I have never had a bad Ommegang beer, but hadn't been wowed by them in a while. This beer hits right in my sweet spot and I will be seeking this out again and again!"
"Medium/light that quickly dissipates to thin and long lasting lacing"
"Overall I'm once again not let down by Ommegang. A well done BPA that's well worth a shot, better now than later."
"I had this on tap at the Map Room into a pint glass. Murky yeasty gold with a nice white head, good retention and lacing. The aroma is nice with light hops, taste has the hops a bit stronger but easy to drink. Nice easy to drink balanced ale but I wouldn't go out of the way to drink it."
"In a world were there are few commercial examples of American hops and Belgian inspired yeast strains (especially under 7%) this is a really nice beer. I can't see this standing up if a lot more of these get made though. As it is though, I am thoroughly enjoying this beer. My biggest complaint is that the malt seems to muddle things a bit; it does add complexity, but seems to get in the way of the crisp hops and interesting yeast character, though it does add extra complexity, which isn't really needed in a beer chock-full hops and yeast character. This would also be a bit lighter and more refreshing without the extra malt character; and I don't think that would be a bad thing."
"Nice big foamy white head on this dark orange brew; it looks like a Belgian brew. Smell is anything but, lots of citrus and hops with just a faint scent of Belgian sugar. Taste is damn near perfect. Starts out like a great Belgian pale ale, slightly fruit before a big bitterness takes over, lots of citrus, like an American IPA. This brew is heavily hopped and a great American take on a Belgian brew. I've been waiting for someone to do a great job pairing Belgian ales with American hops, and this brew delivers."
"Deep golden yellow with a big frosty, rich head. Just a touch of haze. Lazy, thick, sticky lacings. Light floral aroma, with bready or yeasty undertones. Not a prominent bouquet. Nice lively carbonation. Very even, full body feel and nice smooth finish. Pleasant, sweet malty flavor with a light fruity finish. An excellent BPA that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Taste-Dry, spicy, peppery, intermingled nicely with citrus and hopnotes. Very refreshing and drinkable,subtle and tasty. Nice balancing act between the two styles, niether one overpowers the other. Well done!"
"The body is lightish with an abundant CO2, but carries an underlying weight. This is its strength. It's a drinker and built as such, but has some nuance and depth tacked on. Even if it's not all congruent. It fakes it well. Not worth big dollars, but otherwise a decent option."
"Beautiful golden haze, creamy head that lingered in the glass. Easy floral nose. Smooth, flavorful, crisp, delicious, dry, well-balanced and very, VERY good. Will buy again. Highly recommended."
"You know, I don't get it. Belgian beers are good, american beers are good, so we should combine them and that will better. I doesn't work in so many cases. Some of them I really don't like. This one however stands out form the group. Ommegang, who have mastered the art of belgian styles, made a nice drinkable beer that can definitely be enjoyed as a pale ale would be. Very nice golden to light golden color. Good, very light, carbonation, good aroma and very drinkable. I'll have this one again."
"This is a very drinkable beer with decent flavor."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has an excellent pale malt scent along with a dry, fruity yeast aroma. The hop character is crisp and bitter and really compliments the Belgian yeast esters. The taste is great as well! Wow, what a serious hop flavor. It's dry and bitter with a serious amount of yeast character. The malt bill is relatively simple and it acts as a base for what is a terrific example of hops and Belgian yeast compliment each other. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's one of the best Belgian/American pale ales on the market."
"Deep gold in color. Massive head of pure white foam. Very spicy and earthy aroma. Spicy flavor dominates. Long and lingering, peppery ""bite"" to it. Heavy, earthy flavor. Has a distinct, crisp, sort of dryness. Mild citrus notes. Decent body. A lot more upfront then I was expecting it to be. Still damn enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and zesty."
"Ommegang does Belgian's right, It's a no brainer. BPA is well balanced and does it's thing with Ommegang's house yeast strain. A great addition to the lineup and one i'll be trying again soon."
"Poured a lighter shade of amber with a fluffy one and a half finger bone white head that held well.Phenols dominated the nose for me,spicey with some clove and lemon pith.Flavors are lightly medicinal with some lemon oil,and a bit of funk in the finish.Its good beer but the yeasty flavors are a little bit much for me."
"Drinkability: Above average for the style. A nice and bitter sipper. Could have a couple but not likely to purchase again for the price."
"Highly drinkable and satisfying. This is a light, crisp, hoppy number that is drinkable year round."
"This is a good beer. Nothing special though. I am enjoying this, but seems like a watered down Orval clone. Worth a try, but probably a one time purchase for me."
"Very hoppy, but in a balanced way true to the style (I mean like mamma bear: not too much and not too little). Like many Belch beers, it pushes the boundaries (in this case, with hoppy-ness) but in a way that stirs admiration and appreciation--this definitely ain't ""less filling, tastes great""."
"Drinkability: Would drink again if I came across it."
"drinkability: high"
"Cheers!"
"In my tulip glass this beer was a clear golden color with a medium-sized white head. Aroma of yeast, sweet fruit, and spice. It had a taste of banana, mango, and coriander. Sweet malt background. A very smooth beer, and very drinkable. I would buy more of these."
"Overall a nice flavor, spicy grassy and citrus hops, nice malt presence, an enjoyable beer. I would have liked a little more hop presence personally, but it's freshness is nice too. I wouldn't want to age this."
"Served in a tulip style glass, golden copper color. With about 2 inches of foamy, carbonated head. Strong scents of Belgian malts and yeast. Very mild malts, more forward hops. The yeast bread like flavor is toasty. Bread like flavor makes this more dry than sweet. Mouthfeel is over all dry and smooth. Very drinkable in nature."
"I liked the color, the preponderance of yeast flavor, and the presentation of the bottle. The bitterness and tartness was a bit overpowering. Alcohol is barely noticeable in the taste."
"Really quite simple for what it is, but extremely satisfying for it. The kind of beer that I could drink a hell of a lot of, and a great addition to the style."
"I didn't get the hops that the other reviewers describe. Could be just my bottle I may try again."
"Very drinkable BPA. Pricey but worth the try. Definitely something to savor."
"A beer that should be available at all times in all ways. A huge head superb retention and solid lacing combine to make a a beautiful looking beer. Smell follows suit with a melange of tropical fruits especially banana, grainy malt goodness, yeasty breads, bubblegum, and peppery spiciness. So much fragrance going on you could spend the night sniffing. Citrusy hops and light caramel notes. Taste is a follow through of the nose with a touch of vanilla, tart green apples, pears and grapes. The dry hopping gives a clean and grapefruit tinged finish with a dry quenching feel. A crisp and prickly carbonation adds to that quenching aspect and really brings this one close to perfect here as there is a creamy fullness to what is a medium light brew. Drinkability is also close to perfect and I may revise my score in that direction after I acquire a few more of these for the near future. What a great brew! Low enough abv that I drank the whole thing and did not feel hammered or greedy."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle, bottled on 1/19/2010, best before January 2011. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a frothy inch and a half white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is citrus (tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel), yeast, pine hops and a bit of cloves. I think the taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some candi sugar and peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth, refreshing and very easy to drink. It's a good beer today, and would be even better on a hot day. And for $6.99 a bomber, it's a good beer at a good price."
"D: The ale straddles the divide between Belgian Pale Ale and Belgian IPA. The hops are the winner, so much flavor packed into one bottle. Delicious."
"D - Loved it. Only wish I had time for 2."
"Served in a Hennepin glass. Hazy orange color with a thick, fluffy white head. Aroma is a combination of hops and Belgian yeast. Mild hoppy flavor up front that becomes sweeter as the drink goes on. Incredibly drinkable beer! I'm hoping this becomes a year-round offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"Pours a hazy yellow/orange color, some floatys hang out at the bottom of the bottle and a large fluffy snow white head sits at the top of the glass. Fresh hop aroma right up front paired with the signature Ommegang yeast note. Some banana, some spice, lots of hops. Good balance, perfectly carbonated and very drinkable. This is a style i dont mind seeing more of, i really enjoyed this new limited offering from Ommegang."
"Cloudy lemony yellow, giant white head, etc. Just what you would expect from this style in general. Some nice lemons in the nose, and a face full of yeast-- this is a beer from Ommegang, of course. Lightly fizzed, which provides a decent bite; nice for a summer day. Yeast and peaches dominate the taste, and of course a smack of hops that comes close to the upper limits of my tolerance but is not excessive. Not but not zowie."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable brew in my opinion. Not a bad brew at all. Would be great on a hot day."
"classy brew. classy"
"D: Very nice beer. This should be a year round beer for them. Really excellent on the first truly warm day in upstate NY. For the price 8.99 I was satisfied. Again it begs the question How do beers that come from Belgium cost less? Still excellent beer all around."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a hazy golden honey color with a lovely rocky white head that left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is light, sweet, and floral; perfect for a spring release brew. There is some clove, bubblegum, and honey scents; spot on for the style. The taste is of pale malt sweetened with candi sugar, very light yeasty flavor. Some light clove and lighter coriander which transitions into a lemony tartness. There is also some light grassy hops towards the end. On par for the style, good Belgian flavors that are subtle. Moderate body with plenty of fizzy carbonation, quite burpy. Nice balance on the palate. This is a good BPA. Good flavors with a drinkable ABV. Drinks light and crisp. Not too much coriander flavor which Ommegang does on occasion. Could use more yeasty flavor. Great spring/summer brew."
"kudos once again, Ommegang!"
"D: Quite drinkable. Again, I just would have preferred a bit more to make me want a second glass. Somewhat forgettable, ultimately. I don't mean to be harsh - there's very little to criticize specifically about the beer, really. It just didn't hook me in. I'm kinda surprised to see all the raves so far. Perhaps, the bottles have more oomph."
"D: A decent drinker. Tame. A gentle, yet still pronounced, hop aroma and appreciable bitterness, but very light on the typical Belgian funk."
"This Belgian Pale Ale pours a bright golden amber with a huge fluffy white head. The nose starts with a healthy portion of pineapple and piney hops, and is followed by some citrus fruits and then in the background some Belgian yeast. The taste follows the aroma nicely with plenty of citrus hopiness, tropical fruits, and a more prominent Belgian yeast spiceyness. This BPA finishes nicely with a little bit of lingering bitterness and an 6.2% abv."
"I paid too much for this bottle, but considering how good it is, I can't say I wouldn't go back for another. Recommended, but would love to get it at a lower price point."
"Typical Ommegang presentation, caged and corked bomber, $8.99 @ DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Medium golden amber, semi clear with a olive oil almost greenish hue. The head is HUGE, slow to fade to a loose fluffy froth merainge. Leaving more loose and thick lace all the way to the top of where the head once was. Pineapple and resiny hop nose, nice, amirillo? Tasty, hoppy, tropical fruity, toss in some light Belgian spiceyness/yeastyness, including the lovable nutty note from the final yeasted up pour. Yum. Great to see another offering from slow to expand their line Omme. Nice job here, nice new beer to enjoy right now and surely as part of some enjoyable summer lunches."
"D: One of the more drinkable beers I've tried recently and one of the best Belgian Pale Ales."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with billowy suds forming two to three fingers high and then quickly receding. Typical belgian yeast esters on the nose, including a good bit of candi sugars, dried apricots and some subdued clove. Smells quite like a tripel, really. Medium body with a soft and delicate mouthfeel, holding some tangerine, navel orange, banana-like phenols, finishing with the slightest prick of hops. An interesting take on this version. Ommegang sure is one of the best, if not the best, at domestic Belgian replications, and this is a solid offering. Best way I can explain this is that it has the esters of a Tripel and the phenols of a Witte. I would have liked for this to have been a little cleaner. The label boasts that it's been dry hopped with Cascade, yet there's not a whole lot of citrus or pine on the end, which is a bit disappointing. I get brewing in subtleties, I would have just like to seen a bit more bite here. Nonetheless, a refreshing limited offering from some of the pioneers of Belgium brewing in America."
