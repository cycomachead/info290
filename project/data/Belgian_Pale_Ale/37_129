Good beer in my book and worth trying again, but this would probably be more enjoyed by those who like Brett influenced beers.","CTbrew32","Feb 28, 2015"

Peer pours mid amber in color, very hazy, with an enormous white pillowy head.  Aroma is classic Belgian golden ale, suggesting the distinctive yeasty note and caramelized sugar.  But this beer is both more dry and more tart than others in its category (BPA).  It has a really crisp, thin mouthfeel.  Surprising for a beer as high OG as this. The bottle conditioning has left this beer highly carbonated, which works well with the subtle tartness.  It's almost like a mild Gose, or even dry cider.  This beer is unique, distinctive, and impeccably balanced.  It reveals none of its alcohol (note: my label claims 6.9%, although that figure may assume a large amount of fermentation happening in the bottle), and doesn't tire the palate at all.

Pours a hazy coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and lots of pillowy lacing. Aroma of citrus, green apple, Bretty yeast, vanilla; floral. Flavor is semi-dry, light apple family fruit, light stone fruit, mild citrus, vanilla, Brett style wild yeast funk, Finishes with fleeting fruit and fruit dessert flavors dominated by the wild yeast funk and bitterness; lightly tart and earthy. Medium bodied with sharp, peppery carbonation. A very distinctive Belgian pale ale with a unique wild yeast component. I did not like this when I first tried it many years ago, but now having grown to enjoy saison yeasts and a light touch of wild yeast, I can see its appeal. Although the flavor is dominated by the funky yeast, there are a lot of interesting light and subtle fruit and spice flavors in the background. A bit too dry and funky to be a frequent choice, it was a pleasure drinking this again and understanding why it is a classic.","LiquidAmber","Nov 28, 2014"

The aroma is distinctive with sour apple, medicinal, spicy Belgian funk, fruity, and some lemony notes.  The taste follows with the Belgian funk and medicinal, fruit, bandaid, also tart then ending with a surprising bitterness.  Not sure if it's from lots of hops though.  Maybe the yeast? Very unique taste.  Effervescent, crisp, light and refreshing.  I was surprised by the drinkability.  This went down the gullet quickly.  I tried this beer in the 1980's and poured it.  I liked Chimay but thought the Orval went bad.  Nowadays I fully appreciate unique Belgian flavors.  This reminds me of Rayon Vert which is good!","312HopBomb","Oct 26, 2014"

Tried to control the pour to limit head but to no avail. 4/5s of the glass was full of a thick, slow eroding head. The nose was of orange and lemon candy. Smelled delicious. Btw, the head still remains with impressive lacing on the glass. The taste was not what I was expecting. Not sure how to describe it. Malty and boozy. The finish was super dry, like a bourbon. Very good. Only wish I had another one.","tyjudd","Aug 26, 2014"

The head is massive and sticks to the glass impressively. It's cloudy, medium amber in color. Nutmeg and wet earth on the nose with a yeasty bread behind it.

Nose is not overly assertive, bready notes, Belgian yeast prevalent. My first thought was that it was pretty boozy for a 6.9% beer, but I think the extremely dry finish contributed to that. Really clean taste, but not a lot of flavor if that makes sense. Bitterness throughout the drink makes it enjoyable. After it warmed a few degrees I'm starting to think that I wish this wasn't so expensive because it could be session material.

The nose starts with some sweet malt, orange peel, tart lemon and musty yeast. On the palate, the beer opens up further and is much drier than the nose with lemon peel, and a slight tart funkiness to round it all out. The taste finishes with a pleasant floral hop bitterness. Orval is medium body with plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is a unique beer, very subtle and nuanced and stands apart from many/most of the other Trappists.","mtomlins","Jun 09, 2014"

However, the flavour is deeply unpleasant - very harsh and dry with little of what you'd expect from a good beer. Body is also subpar; fizzy and too thin. A great pity, as I've really enjoyed Orval when I've had it before and was looking forward to a top notch brew. Most likely it's just too old.

Some common currents between all experiences: lightly tart fruitiness, vinous character, minerality, hay and must, clean phenolic funk, and light spice. Occasionally it’s surprisingly hoppy, occasionally the musty character is very pronounced, occasionally the spice and phenols are greater, occasionally the tartness is much greater, and occasionally the head is absolutely out of control. But every time—including this time—it’s delicious. It’s easy to scoff at the price for a single, but given the quality of the beer it’s always worth buying, at least every once in a while.","fmccormi","May 08, 2014"

I stand by that review and now attribute it to a bad or very old bottle.  Due to my disbelief, I decided to give it another try.  This time the bottle was labelled differently, with a manufactured date (almost two years old) and a best by date (almost two years in the future).  That puts this bottle right in the sweet spot.  This time I was thoroughly impressed with the beer and I see why it is so highly regarded.  My numbers are readjusted to reflect the second tasting.","FFreak","Apr 30, 2014"

There’s some slight sour and funky notes that hang around and become more pronounced as the beer warms. Incredibly complex. I see why this beer has such a reputation and aura around it.","elNopalero","Apr 19, 2014"

It pours murky orange with a huge four-finger head of white foam and there's still carbonation streaming up the glass. The nose is bready, tangy, and full of brett yeast, bringing barnyard funk and a woodsy characteristic. It smells unlike any other Trappist ale I know of, coming across like a high-quality sour. In past tastings I got a lot of spice from the yeast, but I get none of that here. There's a slight sourness and a seriously oaky, earthy quality with more of that barnyard flavor. It finishes dry and vinous, like a white wine. The body on it is pretty light.","itsscience","Apr 08, 2014"

4.36,3.6,4.5,4.75,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, a beer that seems to vacillate wildly from bottle to bottle and depending on age. I've had some that were overpowering hop bitterness and funk, others that were floral and slightly fruity, and still others that hint at the darker fruits of your classic Belgian dark ales and quads. It's an enigma to be sure. One that I always enjoy, but I lament the inability to find it very fresh in the U.S., especially after getting to have some that was about 3 months after bottling when I visited Brussels a couple years ago. No matter, as the weirdness and complexity of this beer is what always draws me back. More often than not, if I go to a bottle shop looking for a beer without luck, but don't want to leave empty-handed, I'll grab a bottle of Orval. If you don't like it the first time you try it, I still would encourage you to give it another try.","LambicPentameter","Oct 21, 2013"

And that's how I feel about this beer--in my humble opinion, it seems doubtful that there will ever be a better trappist ale, and yet who knows? What I do know though is that I enjoy the heck out of this--its amazing appearance (a huge foamy head that while receding quickly leaves great lacing) and a smell with complex floral notes and candy-like sweetness that is balanced by something (or everything) and keeps the smell so inviting. The taste is amazing--sweet, delicate, floral, balanced, intense, thoughtful, and beautiful. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, making it a beer to swirl around in the mouth for several seconds before swallowing, allowing the opportunity to absorb all of the flavors. And yet, even the mouthfeel somehow manages to seek balance with its crispness. Overall, in my opinion this beer is absolutely one of the best out there even considering its relatively high cost (about $4.25 per 11.2 ounce bottle). Some may fail to appreciate the beer because it doesn't have the high ABV of some Belgians or the bitter hop taste of some of their favorite IPAs, but for what it is, it's just about perfect, and I use that word as sparingly as I can.","DeFaz","Oct 04, 2013"

A burnished copper color with a vast quantity of off-white lacey head. Aroma is a potent mix of pear, fermented white grape, citrus notes, some mild peppery spice. The head itself is acrid and bitter, tasting of burlap sack and wood char. Maybe let this settle out and then sip the liquid. The latter recalls lemon meringue pie, pears and apples, figs, a little white wine, aromatic brown spice like nutmeg or calamus, with a bone-dry finish that leaves echoes of barnyard funk and wine cask. Some complain of excess carbonation but I did not notice this. A complex and polarizing beer that stands apart from other Trappist beers and actually captures the monks' intent to create something that is not overtly malty or sweet. Some pine resin results from dry hopping but does not overwhelm the other flavors. Deserves its reputation and truly unique.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 22, 2013"

Aromas of coriander, all spice, plum, banana, cotton candy, and a bready backbone. More and more aromas come off as the beer warms. Flavors are spice forward, with a great blend of nutmeg, coriander, all spice, and hints of clove, with an old world fruit backbone both rich and sweet. Smooth, light body with a slight effervescence that keeps the sweet and rich flavors blended and drinkable. The aftertaste is a sugary sweet undertone with the spice blend still holding court overall. Lingering finish, with spices left dancing on your taste buds, waiting for another sip.

Nose is complex and kept expanding as it warmed. Sweet Belgian yeast, apples, floral, banana, some medicinal alcohol, a little caramel malt poking through all that bright fruit and brett funk and ultimately finds some spice character. Taste is superb. Relaxed, smooth, full without heaviness, some lemon, some hay and horse blanket. No alcohol on the palate at all. Drinks very dry and leaves a long bitter finish that isn’t tart or sour. It’s earthy and hop bitter. Very impressive, indulgent, full of traditional character and easily approachable for a session.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

While it's not a particularly intense beer, it's very refreshing and certainly a unique take on the Belgian Pale Ale. One of the rare Trappist ales that isn't thick and heavy. It also features more obvious hop character than those beers. Great stuff that's certainly worth buying if you see it hanging out on the shelf. And fear not–Orval has quite a good shelf life.

4.07,-3.3,4.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Bottle from Total Beverage in Murfreesboro, TN. Vastly different from other trappist beers i've had. Unique Bottle shape. Poured into a tulip. Highly carbonated, huge head. Lot's of lacing. Pours very light yellow/orange, cloudy like a hefe as it's unfiltered, pretty decent looking beer can't lie. Smells decently hoppy, with other similaraities to a hefe with notes of citrus, subtle banana, and clove, with a splash of coriander. Drinks very smooth, with a subtle hoppy bite. Very distinictive belgian yeast taste, but with more bitterness than than sweetness, yet not overpowering. Lot's of carbonation. Has a sort of wine like aftertaste, but lacks the punch i was expecting for a 7% beer, i guess this could be good or bad. Very well balanced beer, will buy more, although I prefer other Trappist Beers, this one stylistically is very different stylistically from the likes of Rochefort, Westmalle, etc..","Roman5150","Mar 29, 2013"

4.52,7.4,5,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Taste: Very, very relaxed. Sweetness permeates the entire brew, and absolutely none of the alcohol from the nose is apparent. Those floral hops play a much larger role in the taste than the nose would indicate, and it's entirely refreshing when enjoyed under the slick, wet mouthfeel that the brew supplies. Somewhat distinctive, if not generic yeast notes are omnipresent throughout the sip, but I'm not picking up the fruit notes that the aroma indicated nearly as much as I anticipated. Carbonation is medium and crisp. Pepper rings out strong throughout. I saw a review that mentioned a “fresh-cut hay quality”, and it's right on the money. The finish is a really sweet, organic banana note that makes itself known even after you've finished taking a sip. Overall, this is perhaps the most refreshing of the Trappist ales but certainly doesn't compromise in complexity.","Tomhet","Feb 05, 2013"

The flavor is sugary sweet with a lot of orange and sweet dark fruits along with some pepper, a hint of hop and a touch of alcohol.

I guess when you only brew one beer, you have more time to test, tweak, and perfect it, and it seems like the monks at Brasserie d'Orval have done just that. On most days I'd say that this is not my favorite trappist ale, although it always stands out to me as the most unique. The Brett and the dry-hopping really set it apart from the others and always keep me coming back to this funny, oblong bottle.","tectactoe","Nov 11, 2012"

Smell is complex with notes of honey, light fruit, floral and herbal notes, a bit of citrus, and slight earthy and phenolic yeasty smells. Taste is bitter at first and then herbal with a touch of fruit and bit of wild yeast funk. Unlike anything I've ever had, although some American wild ales are the closest. Dry with a some bite in the finish and a nice lingering bitterness. Very well carbonated with a great mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Not one to gulp down, but take a sip and then you will quickly take another and another. Overall this is one of the big classic Belgians you pretty much have to try. (I can't believe it's taken me this long.) Unique and very good.","burnstar","Nov 11, 2012"

Now, I am reaching the realization that this is even more complex than I once thought. This does not really taste like a Belgian Pale Ale. Yes, it has pale ale malts, but it's also very flowery, had some sour/funk notes, and kind of tastes like a white wine. Bonus points for uniqueness.","angrybabboon","Jul 28, 2012"

4.92,16.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Drawn to this bottle for some reason. Bready boozy smell at outset. Cider-like color with thick lacing. The best part of this brew for me is the complexity. At first taste I do sense the yeast, the astringency is there as others will agree here. I may seem off a bit in this but vinegar comes to mind as a mouth sensation, if you can somehow picture that in a good way. I guess there is an odd abrasiveness that somehow ""works"". Yes it is quite dry, however I can't help, and can hardly believe, that I also detect fruit or fig in the taste. As I mentioned, this is all about complexity. The mouthfeel for me is most abrasive up front, but it is up front where i also smell the fruit-like bouquet as I am tasting it. For some reason and I can't pinpoint exactly how, but this is very drinkable for a beer with such a distinct character. Spices are picked up too. Unusual. I guess the reason i think Orval is so good despite some unusual characteristics is due to the expertise in the brewery of using their ""brettanomyces"" yeasts the way they do. Apparently in most beers these yeasts are considered contaminants. With that it's no wonder I also favor saisons. All good here.","TBoneJones","Jul 21, 2012"

Giving a slight head, the ale was a pale yellow with a moderate degree of cloudiness. The first taste sensation was a mild banana flavor which did not last long. Of course, this was the Belgian yeast shining though. The banana was accompanied by a tart woody flavor with a lemon notes. In some ways, the lemon reminded me of a saison. The flavors were balanced on an earthy backbone with a slightly sour aftertaste. It became obvious that this was a pale ale at this point. This Belgian pale ale was a unique experience. While I enjoyed it, I found myself wanting more from the beer. The Belgian yeasts seemed smothered by the other flavors.","JohnnyHopps","May 12, 2012"

You can drink one, or you can drink five (though it's quite a bit stronger than, say, your average pilsner and you do so at your own risk). All I can say is that it's the only beer logo I am considering tattooing on my body -- that's how much I adore and revere this beer. My favorite Trappist, hands-down.","seancake","Apr 06, 2012"

Amazing thick head that settles and remains for the life of the brew in a fried egg pattern with a thick yolk in the middle of the glass that thins out from there. The smell is the first thing that embraces me as I pour it. Amazingly strong and pleasant! The taste is equally wonderful: a strong barley base with fruity notes of apple and spice. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but still pleasant in how it foamed back up in the mouth a bit. Overall, another great Belgian trappist brew to add to the list.","shigg85","Feb 29, 2012"

What's nice about experiencing this beer is that the initial flavor and feel is crisp and peppery, with a subtle hint of hops, and the finish is a nice 'banana bread' aftertaste.

Some spotty lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation. Aromas of big brett character: tart apple, wet hay, funk, cherry, pepper, lemon, grass, bread, and yeast spices. Awesome aromas here, the brett did a nice job over 3+ years. Great complexity. Taste of big biscuit, pepper, grass, citrus, lightly tart apple, light cherry, and yeast spices. Fairly dry finish; but some lingering notes of biscuit, pepper, light fruit, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium boded; with a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable at 6.9% with no alcohol other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Belgian pale. Incredibly complex and balanced after 3 years of age. I will definitely pick up a fresh bottling of this to compare how the Brett transforms it.","superspak","Feb 10, 2012"

The appearance is a darkish orange with lots of bubbles coming from the bottom of the chalice. I did not observe any ""floating"" yeast. The scent is all apple and some dark fruit. This beer literally explodes on the tongue with the taste following the scent of apple and dark fruit, a bit of hops and bitterness and sweetness simultaneously. The carbonation is pronounced.

Nose is slightly tart up front, with some fresh green apple followed with a funky woodsiness (I imagine a mushroom growing on a slightly rotted out log). I get just a little bit of a flowery soft scent, like lavender. The taste was good but I marked it lower than the nose because I am getting a harsh/flat bitterness like aspirin left to dissolve in the mouth. The mouthfeel was also very, very thin, combined with the very active and prickly carbonation, this felt more like a soda which really detracted from the taste. As I let it warm up the mouthfeel is improving and I am able to taste more balance but it is still not quite there for me. This one might just have a bit too much age on it (~3 years) and the brett has thrown it out of balance, I would like to try a fresher bottle to compare","quirkzoo","Jan 15, 2012"

I love the simple presentation of the label, and (rarely for me) the lack of a totally in your face flavor. This has a nice subtlety.

4.88,15.9,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Served at cellar temp from bottle poured into wide mouth goblet. Upon opening the bottle it hisses a very healthy carbonation and smells of yeast, lemongrass and a very clean musty attic. A clean pour with no sediment shows just how very carbonated this beer is and results with a very large head that crackles and pops receding into a great bubbling lace. A minute after the pour I put my head close to the glass and the beer is still bubbling and talking to me. Aromas from the glass are pale malt and cream. Beer drinks very dry and creamy with a bit of a pucker at the end, but not in a sour way at all. Almost like hay, dirt, mushrooms, and a very very good bread of a type that I have never had before. I am not experienced with brettanomyces but I think that is what this is and is flourishing in this beer. The beer was bottled on 29/07/2009 and that would explain this. It is all very enjoyable and makes me ponder at the end of every sip and I very much like this beer. So very smooth with no noticable alcohol. I could chug this beer if I wanted to quite easily, but that is not what I want to do. Then it would be gone and I would be sad. This beer is forcing me to enjoy it and I am sipping it slower than any beer I've had in a while. The bretty flavor stays in your mouth long after last sip is gone and that makes this beer all the more valuable. A beer that keeps entertaining the tastebuds even after it's gone. Orval trappists you have created a truly great beer and it's no wonder you only make two different beers. No need to make any more when you nail one perfectly. A 5 out of 5.","bebbcorp","Nov 20, 2011"

While the taste isn't for everyone, this has a classic appeal to it based on the cloudy hue and flavors that might not appeal to the hophead or extreme beer fanatic. The complex taste and slightly sticky mouthfeel lead to a slow session that's every bit enjoyable from start to finish.

First mouthfull was very sweet but the bitterness increased with every sip. Tasted of roasted malts, some charcol. This beer didn't taste like other belgian beers I've sampled, I thought it was more like an ESB. Overall, looked like a hefeweizen, tasted like an english strong ale and smelled unlike any beer i've ever had.

4.67,10.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This is a beer that must be decanted super slowly not just to avoid stirring up the lees in the bottom of the bottle, but also because it has an inherent tendency to foam. Sure enough, over half of the glass was initially filled with dense, rocky eggshell-white foam. That was okay by me because it also allowed the funk of the strain of brettanomyces yeast that they use to fill the room. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity thanks to my oh-so-gentle pour. Nose had the Brett funk going, but not in an obtrusive way. I have long characterized Orval as Brett for Beginners, a way to introduce the heretofore uninitiated to the wonders of Brett without causing them to turn away and never want to try any such beer again. I think of Jolly Pumpkin beers in the same way. Mouthfeel was quite full, perhaps due to the large CO2 bubbles inherent in the beer, and with a bitter, funky flavor that is unique to this beer. I cannot adequately describe it, but do know that when I say ""bitter", I do not mean hoppy bitter, but more like a vegetable matter bitter. Finish was extremely dry, which is just the way I like my beers. I am not a sweet toothed person and bitter and dry suits me just fine. Do not pass up a chance to try this beer!","woodychandler","Aug 15, 2011"

Damn hoppy for the style, just what I expected and a lot more, noble hops with some floral notes for good measure, pretty dry malt aromas. Taste is tres hoppy, a revelation for a trappist beer, absolutely unique, hops up front, a bit of malty sweetness in the middle, bready malts to dry out palate towards end, and a mild hoppy back end. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, happy mouth effervescence. I imagine aging will tame the hoppiness a bit, but relatively fresh, well, this is one world class beer.

Medium light feel with lots of carbonation. The taste is different from the way it smells, there is very little sweetness up front, maybe a little citrus fruit and malted wheat, a little peppery and lemon hints but its mostly dry / bitter on the way down with a little alcohol burn, very tasty. Overall an excellent beer, more bitter and drier than the few other Trappist beers I've had tastes like I love, its very good.","DavidST","Jul 05, 2011"
4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured out as a nice looking hazy golden color, the head was big and needed time to settle before pouring out the rest of the bottle. The smell of the beer was a little spicy on the nose, had some good Belgian yeast aromas going on in there and even a little bit of flowers on the nose. The taste of the beer is a little sweet upfront with some yeast and spice in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had a good amount of carbonation to it. Overall I found this Trappist to be very good, I liked the different qualities it has which make it unique. I also find the bottle to be very attractive as well. Gotta try this one if you haven't yet.","Knapp85","Jul 04, 2011"
4.92,16.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"I have been chugging craft beer for about four years now and this is THE BEST that I have found.... yet. Spectacular in every way, Orval is what good craft beer is all about.

I'll grab one of these.","stoutmasterjames","Jul 03, 2011"
4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: A truly fantastic beer, and what I feel is a prototype for what a Belgian pale ale should be. The hops are strong and flavorful but do not overpower the taste of the beer. The amount of malts in this ale allow it to be a creamy and tasty experience. While it gives a nice little warming buzz after by the end, I'd consider it be an ideal beer to have during the summer. If I'd ever want a beer that is flavorful and dry yet not too intense, like a Duvel, I would pick this one up again.","magictacosinus","Jul 02, 2011"
4.65,10.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Overall: Because of the wild fermentation process, I always call this beer the geuze beer under the trappist beers.

It definitely has a candied taste that is hard to describe while having a spicy characteristic. Mouthfeel was excellent as with most trappiste brews.

Appears bright orange with a gargantuan off-white head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Smells like crisp/tart fruit (pear, green apple), yeasty funk, hay, bready malts, and spices. The taste is very similar to the smell, bready malts and funk up front, followed by hay and an assortment of spices, tart fruit in the finish along with a dry serving of funk.

Taste is very smooth. It starts light but comes in with strong taste in the middle and end of my sip. In the taste I detect a slight sweetness as it first touches my tongue, then I get a slight bit of funk with some light malts, in the end of the taste I get some pepper as well.

More hop character in the nose than any Trappist I've had before and more than most Belgian brews, with a sweet yeast funk that is quite enjoyable. The hops come through on the tongue too--definitely more bitter than most of its peers. I can think of a few other Belgian beers this bitter, but not under 7% abv. Mouthfeel is great. I really like this beer and recommend everyone try it at least once. As awesome as it is, it's still probably the least favorite Trappist that I've had (which doesn't really say anything bad about this beer, just a comment on the general superiority of the Trappist brews).","chicagoabbot","May 31, 2011"

One of the most impressive heads I've seen. I didn't pour it right afterward, either. If you avoid pouring the yeast on the bottom, the color is bright yellow with orange tint. Once the yeast goes in, as I did it, it looks deep and hazy. Oh well. I smell grass, grapes, and citrus - great aroma. The malt and hops work well together. The hops are assertive, but don't detract from the complexity. This is one of those beers where you can notice additional flavor as it warms a bit.

Now only if the head would die down, so I can jump in. Very dry and herbaceous on the mouth. A healthy amount of hops, much more than I was expecting.

Golden brown in color with heavy lacing and strong fingers. Previous review stated a sea foam head and that is spot on. Used a New Belgium tulip and even with it being .47L to the mark and probably .5L full the head rose slightly out of the glass. The glass does have a laser etching on the bottom that may have contributed to the larger than normal head. Smell is consistent with a pale ale. Strong hop aroma. Not quite Challenger hop but earthy and very green like. Taste has a sort of consistent flavor from beginning to end hitting you at first with some strong belgian hops with a nice balance of hop/sweet middle and finishing quite smooth and not too dry for my palette. Very active on the tongue and mouth with a sort of brut champagne feel. If I want to drink a pale ale this is the beer for sure.

Taste is of apple cider, lemon zest, grass/flowers, funk, and a bitterness that starts at the start of each sip. Bitterness is very herbal and is quite mild after each sip. The funk is from the Brett used in creating this beer. This beer is very carbonated and yields a huge head on the pour. The body is somewhat light but crisp and clean.

It is a very pleasantly weighted beer though. Drinkability is good too, as I wouldn't have known the abv was 6.9% if I didn't check the bottle.

Actually, this may not be the most complex of trappist beers, but what it has to offer is in just great balance as you would expect from the brewery making only one beer to public.

It seems no matter how long you stand this beer up, or no matter how quick you pull back on the pour, or no matter how careful you are to watch the neck of the bottle for sediment, a slight amount of cloudiness is present. The smell is just outstanding, with a full nose like a bouquet of flowers that is unlike anything that is brewed in the universe. The flavor follows the same road, with a yeasty flowery flavor that is not the slightest bit cloying, sweet, or skunky.

The taste is equally enjoyable being fruity and well balanced. The mouthfeel starts soft and sparkling, then finishes amazingly dry. Orval combines all the best features of belgian-trappist flavors with an immaculate dry finish that makes this ale superbly drinkable.","great7dividers","Feb 13, 2011"

The taste was extremely sour and tart, astringent even, and was very dry. This was not a drinkable beer for me. I'm wondering if the high scores on BA are attributable to the reputation and history of Orval.

Orval takes the meaning of beer to a new level in its own way. Everything about this beer is interesting, including the bottle, which seems to fit the beer perfectly. I wouldn't be surprised if this beer's taste differs significantly between vintages because there are so many flavors that lead me to believe that this beer has a number of microorganisms that contributed to its fermentation.

I'm finding I can't always get the trifecta ... and it's probably due to my preferences. After drinking the Orval, I read an A+ review by Jason Alström. I read other reviews, too, and noticed one beer advocate thought he got a bad bottle. That was the first thought I had after my first mouthful. I don't like beer that has a grapefruit taste in it. I've tried extremely hoppy beers, but they aren't my thing.

4.18,-0.7,5,4.5,4,4,4,"The taste is a tad sharp and I've always felt this way about Orval. It has all the usual suspects for the style, coriander, clove, star anise, but it also has a very sharp orange rind tartness to it that I believe detracts somewhat. The beer is a touch smoother than what is typical for the style, and it benefits by not having that yeasted up prickly mouth feel and coarseness. For a Belgian, this one is pretty smooth. The aftertaste has a bit of the lingering orange rind tartness, but for the most part the remains are mild. This is a refreshing beer too, substantial without being full bodied, a bit of ABV without being boozy. There is a lot to like in an Orval. It's not my favorite Belgian, and not even my favorite Trappist Belgian, but it is a fine beer nonetheless.","albern","Dec 11, 2010"

Still waiting on my orval goblet. Huge off white bubbly head formed almost overflowing the glass, as I let it sit it stuck to the glass and fell slowly on the sides leaving a large head in the middle, almost like a an egg. Dark orangey brown color. Very spicy aroma. Tastes exceptional, I detect some orange. Tart and dry. Not as strong as the smell might indicate. I've been told the beer should be at its peak right now, it tastes like it could use a little more time to mellow to me. Very light on the tongue but I can feel it starting to kick in.

The aftertaste is quite tart and clinging. Mouthfeel is smooth, massively high carbonation from the bottle conditioning. Drinkability is good. I was quite pleased with this beer.

4.29,1.9,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Orval pours somewhere betwwen a murky gold and a hazy orange, depending on the lighting and the amount left in the glass. One of the best heads I've ever seen on a beer rises up, 4+ fingers of a frothy, rocky white crown. Crazy head retention, and the side of the glass I'm not drinking from has gobs of lacing on it. Possibly the easiest five I've awarded. I guess this bottle is old enough for the brett to really begin asserting itself, this Orval smells like 100% brett funk. Lots of musty leather and horse blanket. It's good, but it leaves the nose to be fairly one dimensional. The flavor is a bit more diverse, and really works well. There's a brief flash of pale apple sweetness, before the realization of how bone dry the beer is and the brett crashes the party. That distinct funkiness occupies the middle of Orval, and makes up a good chunk of the flavor. Right at the end though a brisk shot of bitterness serves as an entrance cue for a subtle lemongrass finish. All in all Orval comes together spectacularly, and I much prefer this to my other experience with Orval, which was a younger, less brett-y, and in my opinion less interesting beer. As one might expect for a beer so dry on the palate, the lack or residual sugars result in a very light (but not watery) beer. Orval is highly carbonated to give the beer a certain sharpness to it, but doesn't cross the line into fizzy, a nice balancing act by the brewers. Orval is just a solid beer all around, and drinks like it's a 4.5% brew rather than nearly a 7% one. My first bottle of Orval put me off a little bit, but this one has redeemed it and more, a fantastic beer.","axeman9182","Oct 15, 2010"

4.65,10.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As remembered, an absurd pour. Beautiful caramel color with a nice clarity. Poured carefully into a large wine glass, the head towers above the lip of the glass into a mountainy cone. Excellent retention and lace. Pretty much hits on all marks for appearance. Aroma is balanced, complex and simple all at once. Lightly grassy and hoppy up front with a nice bread and honey maltyness and light peppery notes, all wrapped up in a bit of funk. Taste again is simple, but deep. Nice base of pale malt and a slight sweetness, akin to a good tripel, topped by a grassy hop profile and a nice dry, dusty, peppery finish. The thing that takes this beer to the next level is the mild dose of brett, that slightest funky bite that sneaks up providing an array of oddball flavors. Pretty spectacular. Nice melding of a soft trappist feel and also a hoppy, funky, quirky ale with a prickly texture. A real treat to drink, anytime.

Taste is fairly similar, I'm getting a very dry vinous feel to it (although very, very muted in the vinous sense) with some relatively darker stone fruits (again, plum primarily) and some raisin as well. Still maintains a bit of sweetness amongst the dry nature of this. Slightest hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is relatively watery, drying.

The flavors really compliment each other at the warmer end of the drinking temp. rec's. The mouthfeel on this is quite possibly the best I have ever imbibed.

The head is white and rocky with an assortment of bubbles small and large. The inside of the glass has beautiful lacing. Lacing that is only present due to the imbibing and not the fading of the head. The body of the ale is a beautiful copper and gold. My nose is being filled with floral hops, lemon, dark fruit and a yeasty warm bread. The high amount of carbonation tickles my nasal cavity and leaves me smelling lemon and flowers. The first sip is non aggressive and dry. The body is thin and inviting. Very low bitterness meets biscuit and dark fruit. Champagne like body and mouthfeel pave the way for this complex ale.

It has been a few years since my last Orval and like an old friend, I cant believe how much I missed it. I could drink this all summer long, but the price point is preventative of that.

It has plenty of hop bitterness and some funky tartness as well, but as stated before it is very clean, allowing all the different flavors to play their part.

It opens with grainy malt, sweet and perfumy hops, citrus, and sea air. Further on, spicy pepper, tartness, hard mineral water, freshly cut hay, and notes of leather emerge. Hops and the mineral character leave a trace of bitterness at the end. On the palate Orval is extraordinarily dry, yet the ample carbonation gives a full sensation.

Surprisingly light aroma, but that was deceptive: there was a nice malty hit in the first taste and ever-so-little bite at the back. Tight, fizzy bubbles and a light texture-- lighter than I expected based on the color. Easy to drink, and the 6.9 ABV doesn't hit hard.","gfreed","Nov 15, 2009"

Maybe some banana, mixed berries, a hint of raspberry and something else I can't quite identify. I took a couple of drinks before writing this, but before I get to taste I must commend the beer on lacing this goblet. This goblet eats all sorts of foam from any beer, yet Orval prevails over it - it must be a sign that their collaboration will be a success. The feel of the beer is almost dry, like a pale ale. The taste is really unique however, the scent of the beer is backed up in the taste, the banana, raspberry, malts and others and it's slightly sour, yet slightly sweet. It's different and tasty; I could definitely drink a couple of these in a night if it wasn't for the almost five dollar price tag.

Massive, beautiful lacey head from the pour, hangs around forever and leaves a lovely lace on the edge of the glass. As soon as I popped the top of the bottle I was met with the amazing sweet, sour yeasty aroma with lots of esters, one of the most appetizing smelling beers I've tried. The taste is complex and interesting with a lot of flavors from the brettanomyces coming through - leather, horsey on top of the blondey belgiany base. Really an enjoyable beer, definitely going to try again. This bottle was about 9 months from the bottling date.","bobjonesSD","Sep 19, 2009"

5,18.8,5,5,5,5,5," (original rating) From a bottle in Lund, Sweden on 8-28-07. Pours a murky golden orange amber with a substatial head that stays for quite awhile in a tulip glass. The aroma is probably one of the best-sweet apricots linger with tangy lemon and spicy cinnamon. I was expecting a better flavor out of this, but something was lacking. There was a good mouthfeel with heavy carbonation, but an intrusiveness of alcohol lingered over it and ruined the flavor. The bitterness in the finish was definitely refreshing, but for a beer bottled at only 6.2% ABV, there shouldn't have been this prevalent of an alcohol taste. I'll definitely give it another try.","bulletrain76","Sep 18, 2009"

4.62,9.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"An exceptional, unique beer. The beer pours a beautiful shade of burnt orange-amber, medium, with a slight haze. The head is white and rocky and dissipates at a medium pace. The aroma is exquisite. The sour barnyard funk is just precisely right and blends wonderfully with the underlying Belgian ale notes. One of my favorite aspects of Orval is the perfect dryness. This nature even comes through in the aroma. There are fruit notes, apricots, grapes, lemons, figs, and earthy complexity. The flavor is just wonderful. I'm a bit of a sucker for a dry, delicious beer, and Orval pulls this off this combination better than nearly any other. The flavor is somewhere between a gueuze and a Belgian ale. Orval makes me imagine how good Belgian-style ales must have tasted before modernity imposed sanitary conditions and end of the sour beer as the norm. Orval is a world classic and everyone should try it. I will be buying some bottles for the cellar soon and look forward to witnessing this beer's maturation.","popery","Sep 11, 2009"

Some bready flavor, some spice, a little cork/wood (which is weird since there is no cork) and some fruitiness. The alcohol flavor is there too, but doesn't take away from any flavors.

4.79,13.8,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This brew pours a quite brilliant cloudy, orange/amber colour (when held up to light) and exhibits a bubbly, frothy off-white head with good retention and leaves some decent patchy lacing. Aromas of fresh apple, pear, citrus, pepper and spice all touched off with a hint of caramel arise from this beer. As it warms, I am able to detect a bit of salty cured meat as well (it brings prosciutto wrapped cantaloupe to mind). Taste is quite yeast and fruity up front yet very dry and it displays a bitterness from the hops that I have not come across in a Trappist so far. With those hops come along some nice citrusy and even some coriander notes like from a good wheat ale. The spice lasts through the finish and on to the linger with a dryness that is all too refreshing (especially for a Trappist ale). Mouthfeel is champagne like, medium bodied but with a ton of prickly bubbles that tickle the taste buds and leave my mouth watering after its bone-dry, peppery finish. Overall, this ia an achievement of a beer. So complex on the palate and so refreshing - not to mention, its relatively low ABV (for a Trappist, that is) makes it quite drinkable indeed. I have always enjoyed this beer and I will be enjoying it for a long time to come.","Graham5161986","Aug 02, 2009"

Head slowly recedes leaving behinds delicate strands of lacing. Nose is mild - some light fruity esters (maybe some pear and green apple) with a suggestion of funk that is masked considerably in the nose. Taste is consistent with nose; however, roles reverse in the flavor profile. Fruity flavors are concealed by a bit of funky/skunky tartness. Mouthfeel is light and lively and finishes somewhat dry with a bit of acidity/astringency that lingers lightly. A really nice Trappist ale.

I am not a complete appreciator of the wild funk, but this definitely has it. The brett is there, as is some citrus hints. There is definitely a lot going on in the nose, and I guess I need to continue to explore these styles to fully appreciate it. There is a nice bitter and citrus balance in the taste, nothing too offensive. I have had some that are all sour, but in this case there is enough other flavors to balance it out. The funk (some call it barn) smell is there in the flavor, but is not too powerful. A very crisp and tart ale, with a fair amount of carbonization. In the end, I am enjoying each taste of this sipper, trying to pick up everything, but it is certainly a new realm for me.

This looks like a tasty-ass beer float. I'm impressed. Smell is poignant hay, sour candy, and yeasty aromas. You would think the barnyard smell would be a turnoff, but it's actually quite intriguing. Taste is lightly juicy and fruity malts followed by tart grapefruit and some bitterness on the palate. The overall flavour is mild but well-executed. Mouthfeel is smooth with a nicely carbonated bite and a balanced, dry finish. I have enormous respect for this highly drinkable beer. The funky farm-like character is definitely something I haven't encountered before.

A big fluffy head of tight bubbles that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. A noticeable apple aroma with some spice tones, no apparent yeast scent. The dry, apple flavor follows the aroma without the acidity of cider. The spiciness is reminiscent of apple pie to a small degree. A full, smooth, balanced body.

Upon pouring I can tell the Brett has taken over, but at first sip I see that it's also not fully developed. When this beer is fresh, it's a relatively hoppy Belgian, but thanks to the addition of wild brettanomyces it turns into a lambic. After a year, however, the tangy lemon sour aren't strong and rich enough to complete the beer. I feel like the malts and hops should come out a little more, but I'm left with a thin taste of sugar-covered bread.","tempest","Feb 04, 2009"

Had a bit of sourness and some hop. Carbonation was ok although it didn't show in the head. Drinkability...not very to me. Maybe it needed more aging? Most likely won't try again.

As delicious as this is, I think a year or two might mellow it out a little and take the edge off the hop and alcohol presence. That being said, this is a delicious Trappist offering...its spicy and floral characteristics remind me of a good Alsace Gewurtztraminer, and I think I'd actually prefer this one with food even more than on its own...perhaps some Camembert and crusty French bread?","BedetheVenerable","Jan 25, 2009"

The aroma at first is fruity and sour, with hints of banana and tart fruits. It is followed up by a spicy hop aroma. The flavor is immense. Fruity, with hints of spice, candi sugar, and that earthy, signature Brettanomyces funk. It finishes dry and clean, with great hop character that is unlike other Trappist ales. Orval is a medium bodied brew. The flavor only lasts from sip to swallow. Not much lingering on the palate. It is, however, very easy to drink.

Other brewers please adopt this. Pours a hazy amber with huge meringue-like head. Smell: green apple, yeast funk, orange peel, lemon zest, ginger?, hay, grassiness. Taste: spice cake, honey graham crackers, green grapes, green apple, toffee, more sour yeast funkiness, what I'd imagine hay tastes like. Tangy, soft, medium bodied.

4.53,7.6,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured this one into a La Fin Du Monde tulip. Upon a slow pour a huge head developed that stuck around forever whilst becoming rocky and wonderful. The head sits on top of a pale amber body with golden edges. It's only somewhat hazy as I left most of the sediment in the bottle. Aroma is of sour banana right off the bat, followed up by the famous barnyard funk and hint of apple cider. I've hadd this beer in the past but don't remember it being so sour and funky smelling. The flavor is not as in-your-face funktastic sour as the nose, but it does have that going for it. It's sour, but in a pleasing sort of way. Flavors of ripe fruits, Belgian candy sugar, light acidity, a bit of licorice, and it has a nice hop bitterness on the finish. Body is medium (I think) but it's hard to tell with so much carbonation, which gives it a drying champagne like quality on the tongue. I can't normally see my self drinking too many sour/funky beers in one sitting, but this is so delicious I could easily see myself drinking a couple of these in a night. This is probably the most unique of the Trappist ales and it's one that everyone should try at least once. I can see why some would not like, but I for one am in love!","KeefD","Jan 07, 2009"

Fruits like orange, cherry and apple all seem to be fighting in there along with hints of sweet malts to balance it and a touch of spicing.

The retention was impressive as the head turned rocky after a while and the lacing was equally respectable. The aroma was complex, ripened fruit, slightly sour yeast, sweet malt and spices. The flavors were unique and challenging. At first it was malty and slightly sweet, then it went bluntly sour and tangy with wheat and yeast. Further developments included musty grain, citrus as it warmed and a long hoppy finish that stuck to my tongue. For a Belgian Pale Ale I found myself perplexed; was it a bad representation of the style or so advanced that I was flabbergasted? The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation a little on the fizzy side and the body medium. After pondering I finally concluded I had to tip my fedora to this one; like my favorite type of woman it was wild and demanding but well worth taking home.","thekevlarkid","Dec 05, 2008"

Pours an orange-y brown, bright and cloudy. Big puffy white head that becomes creamier as it settles. Laces oddly, head slides around the sides of the glass along with the beer and doesn't stick to the glass at all. Weird. Smells tart, clove-like, withe notes of oranges, coriander. Flavor is similar to the aroma, though with a distinct malt base that's got a bit of caramel and the barest hint of chocolate. Small alcohol evident on the finish. Quite smooth, almost creamy, which is impressive considering the relatively low ABV. Drinks very well and interesting qualities.

Aroma is a mix of faint flowery hops, toasted malt, bubblegum, coriander, allspice, and some earthy mustiness that reminds me of an underground stone cavern. Flavor is very much the same as aroma, but I must say that I changed my marks for this beer for higher numbers as it warmed up. As it reaches cellar temp more complex and subtle flavors peaked through and the malt profile while nearly absent at a colder temp evolved into something truly sublime in its personality.

I am actually harvesting the Brett yeast dregs from this bottle to add to my current wild yeast culture. I will end up pitching it into a Fantome clone. The appearance of this pour is out of this world! I have never lacing like this before. A massive blanket of airy foam clings thickly to every inch of my Chimay chalice. A rusty copper body dances with carbonation. The aroma is spicy and is heavy with earthy, ""Wet cork"" overtones. The brett is definitely present as is the herbal dry hopping. The taste is slightly tart up front but spicy and sweet in the body. The slight acidity adds a sense of dryness to the finish. A nice hint of peppercorn makes a presence time and again. This may be a little too tart for those who do not appreciate a nice hint of Brettanomyces, but it is fantastic in my eyes.

Despite having stopped at the monastery 2 years ago, despite having had it in many restaurants over the last few years, despite loving Matilda, etc. Well, here goes: Orval is possibly my least favorite of the Trappist beers, but it also has to be the most unique. The beer is copper colored and clear, maybe slightly hazed, with a thick dry-looking head. The smell is very complex, some grass, leather, barnyard funk, and hops (Belgian-style). The taste is everything from the aroma plus a little sour. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is a little thin, maybe due to a dry acidic after-taste. I think the drinkability is very good, as I'm interested in the complexity of the flavors. A great beer but maybe difficult to appreciate at first.","TurdFurgison","Aug 09, 2008"

Aroma betrays the brett, with citrus, cranberry, ripe apple. Faint spice of the sort you'd expect from a trappist ale. Mild but nice. Flavor starts off with tart fruit, again cranberry comes to mind, followed by a rise of some peppery spice flavors with a little bit of a leathery taste. Tartness comes back in the aftertaste. High carbonation in the mouthfeel. This is very drinkable, as it strikes a balance between being interesting and going easy on the palate, and the alcohol is pretty well-hidden.","mgp80","Aug 01, 2008"

Great attenuation lets everything hit the palate: a dry, grainy malt backbone, sweet crystal malts, bitter styrian goldings, refreshing sourness, and pronounced but not overwhelming brett flavors of horse, leather, and even slight (but not innapropriate) band-aid.

Slight hops are very noticeable towards the end, and your mouth is left very dry. As for mouthfeel, the heavy carbonation gives it a nice, light quality that plays with the senses (b/c of how complex it really is). Awesome beer.

There is a subtle Brett sour theme throughout the taste, but the other facets seem to change. Jason said it best; fresh cut hay, citrus, hops. Truly like walking from the barn to the orchard.

The taste is an earthy blend of yeast and a light, bready malt. A light sweetness is present, which balances the hop bitterness. A fruity aspect appears as the beer warms.

The bitterness isn't good, and is unlike anything I've tasted in any other Trappist Ale. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, but a bit high on the carbonation. Overall it does smooth out a bit at the end, but not a whole lot.

Head is average size, rock, and only just off white. Flavor of mine was just salty and bitter, no real depth or character. Went down dry and metallicy at the end.

4.53,7.6,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As far as I am concerned, this is the most mysterious of the Trappist beers in that it tastes like none of the others. Poured in to my Westmalle chalice a beautiful golden orange color, with an impressively sturdy white head. Aroma has lots of lemony zest, a bit of barnyard funk, and an almost salty character. Flavor starts off dry and carbonated, much like champaign, then has qualities of lemon, horse blanket, minerals, and a faint hint of pears. This beer is light to medium in body, and has a cool ability to scrub the palate dry with all of the carbonation going on within it. I would love to have more than one of these in a sitting, one of these days when i have the money I am going to buy a case. Inspiring beer we have right here. The complexity is endless with this one. I especially like the fact that it has some funk similar to some of the Lambics of Belgium, and the Wild Ales of America.

The beer is amber/orange color and incredibly clear for having been bottle conditioned. The carbonation billows from the etched Duvel ""D". The head sticks with great lacing as it settles down after a few long minutes. I smell the head as it begins to fall and I smell a hop aroma (maybe Saaz) and metallic brett funk. As the head clears more I can faintly smell pale malt and peppery yeast. The taste is much more funky and bitter than I had anticipated. The sweet pale malt is almost entirely covered up with a literal blanket or warm, soft brett. The finish is then dry and metallic. This aftertaste and mouthfeel effect make the beer quite a unique offering, and although it has a seemingly one-sided flavor profile there is adjustment that can be made based on temperatures that the beer is served at. Very complex in that aspect. As far as drinkability, it is great. As far as affordability, it is not so great. I'll call this a special occasion beer; maybe to serve at a birthday or for New Years.","Rudgers73","Nov 20, 2007"

Orval's taste is of mellow black cherries and plums, not as intense as the American brewed Belgian-style Ommegang that I am more familiar with, but seemingly more balanced.

I guess it's possible that I got a bad bottle, but if this is what this beer is supposed to taste like, it is an acquired taste that I shall not pursue.

The flavor is dry, not a lot of sweetness left. I taste a nice lemony flavor, but different from the typical citrus flavors from hops. There nice dry toasty malt flavor with light yeasty funk, more earthy flavors. The beer is very complex and delicious, I'm not even getting past the surface on all the different flavors going on.

Taste is conservative compared to some of the more over-the-top offerings found in the motherland, but refined and delicious. Subdued esters and a nice hop presence.

Into a chalice, pours a lovely golden hue, lightening around the edges, with a bubbly inch of head to start with. After receding to a thick film, the head is brought back with a modest swirl, and lacing falls in sheets. The aroma, though not very assertive, pulls one into the beer, the hops take on a grassy feel, spice, and noble, fruity and floral but coaxing all the way to put it to mouth. And then it doesn't disappoint. There are spices aplenty, pairing well with the lemon, grassy, citric hops, loads of bittering involved, and are only magnified by the crazy carbonation. The body is deceivingly light, not so much for malts around here, but very refreshing, and the dry finish leaves you craving for either more Orval or more cheese (which I'm eating with it). In sum, while not my favorite Belgian, nor my favorite Trappist, Orval is a hands down classic and definitely worth enjoying every so often.","objectivemonkey","Apr 16, 2007"

Not picking up as much citrus as I noticed in the smell. Some white pepper maybe. I like this a lot, and one bottle is not enough. Mouthfeel is full and prickly with carbonation.

Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. It smells fruity(lemon, orange, plum and banana), spicy (peppery and herbal/earthy) and malty. There's also other smells that I can't tell exactly what they are. The taste is pretty much like the smell but the citrus taste is the strongest. There's so much to this beer it's pretty hard to figure it all out, if that makes sense at all. Mouthfeel is light/medium, but it has a bit too much carbonation for my liking.

That, in turn, yields to the dry, slightly acidic finish that is a very crisp, refreshing combination indeed. I suspect that aging would only benefit this one, though I've never tried it. Mouthfeel is very good, silky and oily, which makes a nice contrast to the crisp flavor finish. Drinkability is good but the dryness of the aftertaste usually means I only have one of these in a session. I haven't had another beer like this, its really a great, unique experience.

There isn't enough sweetness to entirely balance the sour as in some other beers I've tried, but the sour flavor isn't bad either. It is fairly smooth for the sourness.

The head eventually dissolved into a 1 finger constant, with lacing down the side of the glass. The beer is just carbonated enough, and not too overly done.

Phenolic aromas and flavors of holiday spices and juicy fruit gum. Not very sweet though, with a little sour tang. 15 minutes later and halfway through the beer the head has finally settled down to a thin, soft blanket of melted marshmallow with persistent lacing.

Here goes: poured into a tulip glass rather haphazardly a huge foamy head like the top of mount Everest or something, with thick sticky white snow lacing all over. The retention is wonderful. Smells of pilsner malt, lots of nice citrus, hints of apple, light spice, and saaz hops maybe, first beer I think of in relation is Duvel, at least in the nose. Taste how ever is little like that Belgian devil. Taste is crisp and refreshing, bitterness is minimal on this, same with sweetness. I was expecting a little more sweetness toward the middle and finish, which this one does not really have, I think thus it lends its self to consumption in mass quantities, or at least more than one. I feel like I can really taste the quality of the water in this, more so than other trappists, something about its subtleness allows that element to shine through. I also heard that Orval makes some tasty cheese, which I will have to purchase along with another of these.

The aroma was great as well; very fruity and sweet. I picked up a good deal of banana, and maybe some brown sugar plum notes. However, the taste was way different; consisting of some light malts, overly intensive vegetable like hops and the occasional addition from the nose. The mouthfeel was overly bitter for my taste, but the consistency was nice and thin/smooth. I am not interested in trying this beer again, considering I expected much more and am fairly disappointed.","dbalsock","Nov 22, 2006"

Even at the end of the glass, tiny bubbles continued to rise. The beer smelled of fine grass, lemon, and hay. The beer had an earthy spiciness to it and almost tasted sweaty. (Horseblanket? I don't know, I've never smelled one). There was a perfect bitterness to balance out the caradmon, black pepper, and grapfruit. I attempted to pair this with a simple grilled salmon and roasted veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, and zuccini) marinated in a dressing made from Penzey's French Country Vinagrette spice blend. The meal and beer did not contrast or compliment each other and were therefore a push. Thus, I pulled out the gruyere cheese. This cheese was a little old and losing its nutty and toasty qualities, but the beer worked wonders on it. Again, it was not the perfect match, but the hard gruyere actually tasted creamy after sipping the beer. The fading nuttiness came forth, despite the lack of nuttiness in the beer, and the cheese helped flesh out some of the spicy earthy sweaty corners of the brew. I would definitely not try this beer again unless I had a good goat cheese, gouda, or aged cheddar to go with it.","dnrobert24","Apr 11, 2006"

Hops are definitely present, and yeast to be sure, but where's the malts? Its there, just under the sour layer of yeast and astringent hops. This is definitely a sipping beer. It kind of grows on you as you sip it - and the fruitiness (from the yeasts) becomes more noticeable to me. But over all, just doesn't agree with me very well (and I like Saisons - at least the few I've had). Good mouthfeel, light, but not terribly drinkable for the style, imo.

Taste starts with a slightly sour note but then turns into a hoppy, dry finish. There are other Belgians I prefer, but this is a damn good beer. A bit expensive at $6 for a 11.2 oz bottle.

For me the aroma of Orval is perfect. It is very difficult to describe. The aroma contains a wonderful sourness that is surprisingly not present in the taste. Within that sourness are hop oils, phenols, a perfumed fruitiness and bitterness, quinine, lemon grass, hay, and so much more that I cant place a finger on. Orvals body is light and about as dry as it gets. It is well hopped, slightly bitter, and tastes of medicinal light fruits and leather. I prefer most of the other trappist beers to Orval simply because I prefer quads, dubbels, and BSDAs to Pales, however, I believe that this is the quintessential example for the style. Its certainly the best Ive had.","DaPeculierDane","Mar 29, 2006"

The head looked almost like that froth that churns up on the sea shore and just stuck to the glass. Taste was not overly great either.

Very unusual flavor, earthy hop bitterness, peppery spice and bread yeast, nearly no sweetness, funky lemon-like sour notes from the brettanomyces, has many saison qualities.

Earthy and grassy citrus smells with slight caramel and raisin. Very earthy and grassy taste mixed with a decent amount of hop flavor and bitterness - although its an odd flavor, not off, but odd. It is different from the other Trappist ales I have tried. It seems a bit harsh. I have one more bottle tucked away that I will have to try in a year or two.

Aromatics of sourness, tartness, muskiness, woodsy, metalic, and oysters. Flavors boarder closely on the characters in the aroma. Low levels of barley (maybe too low) lends an overly sour flavor and astringency. Not enough sweetness remains to balance out the tartness. Some DMS qualities come through that reminds me of an ocean muskiness or oyster flavor. Fascinating, but very raw. The beer is well matured and complex.

Taste is bone dry and I mean bone dry - think of the driest champagne you've had, and multiply it by ten. Not sour tasting at all, but with a peppery finish.

Tastes bready, musty notes of brett and wild yeast. Spicy as well, cloves and pepper in the mix, with lots of fruits (banana and orange are predominant) as well. Long and sour finish. Mouthfeel is very creamy and nicely carbonated. Full and very warming, superb. Drinkability was incredible for a trappist. I wanted to keep drinking these all night.

Smells perfumy/vinous with rubber glove phenols, cough medicine, and some lemon juice. First sip throws me for a loop. Tastes like a rubber glove. It's like I'm at the dentist. The next flavor is cough medicine, like Robitussin or something, and maybe other medicinal flavors. That's pretty much all I can detect. Maybe some perfumy hops. It loses a lot of flavor toward the end. The strong phenols may be the intent of those monks, but they rub me the wrong way and really affect the drinkability of the beer. I was looking forward to trying this one, but am disappointed. I'll try again sometime to see if it will taste different. Maybe it's better when fresh or when properly cellared for a while.","mmmbeer","Nov 17, 2005"
3.28,-22.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"A quaffable trappist ale. Poured out to a hazed orange golden hue with a nice white foam head and rigns of lace in the tulip glass. Higher level of carbonation. Aromas of herbs and spices, with some malt in the background. Taste was decent, but far from what I've come to expect from a Belgian Pale Ale. Flavors of hay, bitter malt and hops, grain and alcohol fill the palate. Somewhat of a bland character as well... can't put my finger on it. Mouthfeel was smooth and rather creamy.

Strong beading from high carbonation is evident. Dry-hopped with Goldings gives is a floral nose along with interlaced aromas of horse blanket along with medicinal phenols typical of Belgiums. Mouthfeel of champagne with strong effervescence. The play of aroma and carbonation leaves any thought of grains behind. Sweetness only in the aroma not flavor. Quite a feat! Ester flavors of dried fruits, and woody earthy hops and intense dryness, leading to acidic finish that suggest a fine dry wine. Changing with temperatures but best around 55° to room temp.

I recognised malt and a sort of dry bitterness, not really sour. In all its simplicity, it is a very rich beer. It has a unique aroma. An aroma I cant recognise in any other Trappist. Although it only has an alcohol percentage of 6.2%, It tastes like it is stronger. And it can be very dangerous when over consumed. The Orval beer is a very distinctive beer.

There is a spiciness there too. Mild nutmeg is backed by a light doughy scent. The flavor has more of the apples and pears. The spiciness comes through in the taste, but has more clove character. The fruit is still there, definitely pears now, and backed by grapefruit. A little bit of fig sweetness on the finish. This has a tartness and a slick mouth feel I wasnt expecting.

The smell was the first thing that hit me as I popped open the cap. It smelled and sounded like a sparkling champagne, even tasted a bit like one. Also in the smell was something that seems to be lacking altogether in many Belgians... hops! It is by no means a hop monster, though, as the malt character clearly shows through in both the smell and taste as well. This beer is perfectly balanced between maltiness and hoppiness, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is so incredibly smooth I can't wait to take another drink. The finish is slightly dry and reveals a bit of alcohol even though is not a very huge beer at 6.9% (according to the label). As I said before, drinkability is off the charts.

The flavor was very strange as it had a strong flavor of hops but not like anything I have ever tried before. The hops were almost like juniper or some other astringent herb but stil retaining the smoothness of quality hops with no cheesiness or weird bitterness. The malt flavor was light and dry making sure that the hops were the highlight of the beer.

Huge, sandy head full of pits and craters fills half the goblet on the first pour, ""subsiding"" into boulder-like chunks while snapping, crackling and popping loudly. Clouds of head cling to the sides of the goblet and crust into eternity. A pillar of carbonation rushes through this hemisphere of polished bronze liquid with apricot highlights. Stinks lovingly of sourdough bread, tart green apples, sweaty armpits, curdled milk. Stench of rotting canned fruit cocktail soaking in London dry gin. Nosefeel is cool and sharply acidic, as of vinegar; the aroma practically fogging up the room. Before pouring the yeast this is dry enough on the tongue, with flavors of oregano and bay spiking through a mineral-laden palate and finishing with a twist of lemon. The yeast adds flavors of rancid sweet mint, bread, human feet, and gimlets splashed over a forest floor's worth of mold and spore before fading to a subtle aftertaste of dry herbs. Pinpricks of carbonation punctuate a mouthfeel that is almost airy with lightness and distributes effortlessly over the tongue. Drinkability is dependent only on one's ability to get over one's own senses. I can't write more without rambling pseudo-philosophically about this beer as a living, breathing organism; a metaphor for entropy; and the cyclical nature of decay and rejuvenation.

Intensely unique lace. The beer is clear, orange-red, chestnut brown. The aroma at first is warmly leathery, earthy oils and must. Smelt with the head still large and churning, a strong sweet-bread note, or fresh pastries, with fruity yeast. Some chemical-like smells. Phenols make their presence known, but there are also strong ripened fruits, as if the mould was already beginning to overtake them, which gives a very good aged feel to the beer, like a vintage wine. Malty sweetness in the background, some sugar, some sryup, and a very fresh smell I am having truoble describing. Lightly detectable hop; definitely enough to add even more character, though. More fruitiness than other Trappists, such as Chimay. The taste is delectable, with definite licorice, vanilla, starchy bread, sour acidic fruits, and it leaves a numb soapy clove feel on the tongue. The main difference I note in ageing this beer for 2 years compared to newer Orvals tried is the smoothness: the aged Orval is intensely smooth, creamy and oily on the palate, making it more drinkable. A strong leather taste, with nuts of different sorts, some sweet malt, and definite hop on the finish, making for an excellent balance of all 4 elements. The lees/sediment is very bitter, fruity, and obviously yeasty/fruity. Ageing has also made the beer more potent, more alcoholic, which is no surprise.

4.2,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Seved from a nice pear shaped bottle, my Orval poured out very well carbonated and buried in an avalanche of voluminous off white foamy head. This foamy mass took it's sweet old time melting away and becoming quite rocky in nature as it eroded. Buried beneath was a volume of hazy ale the color of early sunset orange. Aroma is yeasty, a bit bitter, and hint of orange peel and spice. Body is medium and almost refreshing while stil chilled a bit. Flavor is at first dominated by malt and funky bread flavors, with only a hint of spice at first as well as some lemon tartness. After a couple sips, more peppery tang and citrus flavors push through the malt and yeast to make them selves known. Finish brings out just a bit of alcohol warmth and is otherwise clean.","mikeys01","Apr 19, 2004"

Amber-orange and slightly hazy color with a towering foamy white head sticking way outside the goblet and forming a peak. Insane level of carbonation keeps the head alive for a long time. The aroma is hoppy with lots of musty smells underneath. Taste is hoppy, acidic, and peppery. I am drinking this a year after it was bottled. At this point in time the beer is not very sweet or fruity. Quite refreshing with a light mouthfeel, but with a satisfying punch. I will have to get some fresh and see how it tastes at the time of bottling. Since the bottle label says the beer is good three years after bottling, Ill have to see one after it gets fully attenuated as well.","rajendra82","Apr 17, 2004"

The head is thick and foamy, sort of looks like that foam you see at the ocean when a big storm is coming, or at the edge of a fast moving stream. Anyways, to continue on, the aroma is somewhat effervescent and fruity, raspberry, perhaps? Lacing over the honey hued brew is incredible as the head begins to join it's liquid brethren. Slightly sour flavor where the fruits come into play, and then rounds out a bit with the malt and slight alochol warming. An interesting Belgian, as most are.","ppoitras","Apr 12, 2004"

Too much carbonation keeps the light flavor from reaching the tongue. I let it sit for 15 minutes before I opened and I think it needs even more time to warm.

I wish they made air fresheners that had this aroma. Taste seems a bit muted to me. Some citrus and spice came through as did a small small bit of hops but i sense no malt backbone. I just wish it had a little more balance. Mouthfeel is decent, nice and smooth. Drinkability seems pretty good too. This is a great beer, but to be honest I was kind of hoping for my first perfect score (well i do with all beers, but i thought this one had a chance).

It has a sharp, tangy flavor at first, but it goes down smoothly. Take a sip and breathe it in, there is a very unusual, almost hot pepper taste across your tongue. As it warms, it seems to take on a different face altogether. I liken it to an ex girlfriend, a bit offish at first, but yet unique and intriguing all the same. The more I get to know, the more I am drawn in, but just when I think I have things figured out, it changes/morphs into a completely different being.

I rarely get waves of smell from brew, but this one has it. It reveals a sweet fruit, coriander?, clove?, light hops, a musty yeast aroma, and some that I can't even explain. It smells complex and it made me antsy to sample this one. The taste is slightly less exciting than the aroma, but still one solid brew! It starts with the carb bite that slides into a light spicey fruit and yeast that tapers into a dry seltzer like taste. This is a light bodied beer that again has dryness that is in the entire second half of each swallow. A very nice Ale that is definitely unique! Op uw gezonheid!","BeerAngel","Mar 10, 2004"

Then it's like citric acid taste in the middle then some hops at the end. Quite complex. Aftertaste is very, very dry and it's quite longlasting.

Bought this case almost a year ago and down to a few bottles dated best before 8/10/06. Strange... the ABV on the bottle says 6.9%. Head stays around forever, leaving tatted lace all over the chalice. Intricate aromas, black pepper, hops, lemon zest, some barnyard and sweaty farmyard, but oh so beautiful. The taste is as equally complex. Never sweet, the whole experience is just a dry assault on the palate. Some grapefruit or other sweet/sour citrus, some barnyardy saisonishness, another part yeasty. Mouthfeel's spritzy and well-carbonated for a beer of such ABV. Wholly enjoyable (I guess the reason I'd fork over $90 for a case of it a year ago). If you're looking for a complex, drinkable -and exotic- beer, look no further. I love turning pseudo beer connoissuers on to this beer. ""Oh!

An undertone of vinegar is notable in the smell. The carbonation hits your palate hard, but the beer has so much flavor that this doesn't detract. Most belgian beers are somewhat shadowed by their carbonation levels, but not here. Sweet, tart hops followed by sweet darkmalts and alcohol. Spices do a good job blending the flavors together, adding a layer of complexity that is quite enjoyable to sort out.

The aroma is of Hops with a bit of candy and well that typical barn scent. This one has more horseblanket, barn scent than most, perhaps because it is so young. The taste is almost pale aleish. Very hoppy at first, then it gives way to a bit of candied fruit. Not very complex at this age. I will have to get a couple to see how they turn out. The carbonation is high, but the mouthfeel is still nice. I think the carbonation helps cleans the tongue and this would be good with some fatty foods esp with the high hops at this age. Drinkability is good, the alcohol is well hidden. I will have to get a couple of these to age as I feel once they round out some more of the character will come out of this beer.","TinusTime","Mar 04, 2004"

There are only some spots of lace on my glass, but I'm tempted to blame the glass. The nose is magnificent: Cotton candy and flowers, and lots more sensations I can't quite describe. Sorting all this complexity out is one major nasal challenge! The mouth is heavily carbonated and surprisingly light. The taste? Lord have mercy! Candy, sugar, spices, lemon peel, and a thousand other things to confront the tongue, jowels, palate and every other part of the mouth. Then, the hops emerge. Rare for a Belgian, this beer is very well hopped. Good crisp, flowery hops that dominate the finish and leave a very tart bitterness in the aftertaste.

I see one of the bro's used the term horse blanket in their review (as part of taste) and that's a pretty good description also. The taste however was leaps and bounds above the smell. Still very musty, but with a citrus hop bitterness. Defiantly yeasty, with some herby graininess. Mouthfeel was excellent as well, medium bodied and crisp. I found it to be very carbonated. Drinkability was good although, I really could not get over the darn horse manure smell, enough to say it was better than ""good," but to some the smell may be to their liking. Just a matter of preference. All and all though an excellent beer, and one of the legendary 6 true Trappist ales. Give it a go if you like Belgian beer and haven't already. You won't be sorry.

What comes to pass after the head is very nice, thick rings of sticky lace. An orange/amber cloudy haze of liquid appears. The aroma is of citrus or straight lemon. The taste is smooth with a tart, hop bite. The body is mid to thin. The mouth is left dry, thirsty. Drinkable, yes. Knowing the history, the abbey, the monks. Very cool!!

The taste was spicy - too spicy, really, like someone accidentally dropped a large container of white pepper in the batch. A bit of malt was hiding back there, and the finish was just as strong spiced with a tinge of clove-numbness.

Aromas are ripe and fruit driven with flavors of grapefruit, citrus peel and fruitcake. The beer is medium in body with soft carbonation and a creamy feel. The taste is at once bitter citrus hopiness-veryredolent of citrus zest or oil. The whole emphasis in flavor seems to center on bright twangy citrus, and I, betting this is a fantastic food wine. I'll try it with some whitefish and potato and report back. I think I score the drinkability a bit low as this seems most certainly made for food vs simply sipping.

As great as the beer looked and smelled, the taste was a bit disapointing. I thought it was a bit too bitter, acidic and had an unpleasant coppery taste.

The head stayed at a peak the entire duration and even after the last sip, it was still hanging on to the side of the chalice for it's dear life. The flavor was so unique and complex that it will most likely require several additional samplings to accurately define what I'm sensing. Burnt sugar, stale fruit, earthy malty taste. I don't know, perhaps my palate doesn't possess the sophistication for this one. What I do know is that It was a most enjoyable if not a religious experience and I look forward to the next.

There is a lushness in the nose that I find unique, it is obviously hoppy but so damn soft with the fruitiness. It is very impressive, good potency as well. Inviting. On the palate the hoppiness is assertive and bitter. This is coupled with an amazing dryness that allows a white wine vinous plus influences of apples, pepper, and mellow kiss of horse blanket. The palate is wonderful and akin to the complexities of the bouquet. It is very bitter but very soft. The mouthfeel is similar brut champagne, albeit with much improved carbonation. The finish is done-dry, which is very appetizing; the pepper and hops bitterness is long lasting. The body seems a touch thin but it is workable, the carbonation is high. This aspect of the beer has grown on me, Id didnt care for this feature on my first few bottles of Orval but now the mouthfeel is a welcomed attribute. I wrongfully compared this to Duvel and it never stood up in my mind that was my fault. Orval is too unique and too noteworthy to compare, it is a different version of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and in many ways better. I love Orval. Highly Recommended.","bditty187","Dec 02, 2002"

The head is soft and dense, and produces considerable lace. Color is deep, shady amber. The beer is effervescent and light bodied. A nice, biting hop finish is in contrast to a tart and spicy foretaste. Small sips and deep sniffs are the way this beer is meant to be enjoyed!","Suds","Nov 24, 2002"

Aroma was sour and sweet... fruity and herbal. Flavor began with some sour fruit flavors... apple and pear maybe... became somewhat spicy and finished like an herbal tea. Light to medium body with a quite noticable alcohol presence. This is a beer that I'll need to try again... as it is with most well brewed Belgians, it's far too complex to fully describe.","zerk","Nov 23, 2002"

Complex nose--barnyard, bubblegum, and Band-Aid aromas; quite sour-smelling. Effervescent in the mouth; light body. Band-Aid in the aroma, as I mentioned; and I don't profess to know what Band-Aids taste like, but if the smell is any indication, this definitely tastes like a Band-Aid would taste. There's a hard-to-define tonic-watery sort of hoppy bitterness present throughout. It has grown on me somewhat as it warmed, but to be honest I expected more from this brew.","doerickson","Nov 16, 2002"

The rocky head and lace is lasting.  This brew starts out on a good footing, because its look is almost flawless.  The initial taste is one of smooth malt sweetness then strong warm alcohol notes leads your tongue to a bitter hop/fruit finish.  The fruit most resembles bitter peach. Quite a complex and bold brew.  Medium to full mouth with a nice creamy feel and coating left in the mouth.  A truly crafted Belgian Ale!","frank4sail","Nov 14, 2002"
4.95,17.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Pours into my Orval chalice, where it is beautifully presented, an orange brew with a huge white head that retains very well.  Wonderful complex aroma, consisting mainly of ripe banana and clove.  It's like I just got a bunch of fresh bananas and peeled one!  Also detectable are fresh sliced green apple, dried fruit (maybe raisin or plum), and spicy hops.  Can't say how great that aroma is, it's just overwhelmingly good!  I feel like I'm in a fruit market.  One of the most aromatically pleasing Belgian beers I've ever had.  Cracked pepper jumps in with the first taste, then more of that fresh fruit that was in the aroma.  Clove also floats around sporadically.  Spicy hops are next, along with dried fruit.  Malt is most noticeable with retro-olfaction.  Very ""carbonated"" mouthfeel.  Sharp melon rind-like hop twang in the finish.  A medium body, but very fruity, spicy, and complex!  This beer is so very good!  It's well worth the $4.99 or so for the 11.2 oz. bottle in my opinion.  Trappist monks certainly know how to brew.  And I'm sure they get to drink this wonderful brew every day at the Abbaye Orval.  They even make cheese to pair this with.  I want to be a monk there now, where do I sign up?","hyuga","Nov 09, 2002"

I get Juicy Fruit gum in the aroma underneath which slinks a cigarette smoking man playing baseball with a big eraser in his pocket. To interpret that, underneath the juicy fruit smell and flavor was something that reminded me of cigarettes, wood, and pencil erasers (especially after you've just erased something.)","aracauna","Nov 08, 2002"
4.23,0.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Orval's appearance is one of the most outstanding I've seen. Pours a deep apricot-colored liquid with a commanding, bubbly white head. Head retention is ridiculously good. Nose is of various fruit, brettanomyces yeast, and substantial clove. Taste is rather sour and dry, but not overly so. The acidic yet well-carbonated mouthfeel is appropriate. Drinkability is fairly strong for a challenging brew like this. Orval is certainly a unique Trappist ale, and one whose attention is well-deserved.","Jon","Oct 23, 2002"

4.85,15.2,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Lunar-eclipse orange with a massive, stiff head. Another aromatic triumph. Pine needles, sourdough, orange peel and clove all take turns on the nose. There is a really medieval feel to the aromatics. This is the beer they drank in Middle Earth, all resinous, peaty and full of crackling wild enzymes. The flavors are pretty and refined, somewhat in contrast to the nose. Sourwood honey, nutmeg, and roasted starch appear. A dry beer overall. A very fine, powdery grain on the finish. One unique beer.","putnam","Oct 02, 2002"

The bowling pin shaped bottles emanates a fruity strong aroma that literally fills the room.  The pour into the traditional goblet is slow and the creamy head is thicker than harbor fog on top of the deep orange-brown sea.  The Belgian yeast imparts a definitive fruity slightly earthy flavor character with a malty alcohol warmth tucked in deep.  The mellow crisp hop character leaves a clean finish.  A well rounded flavorful wonderful beer.","beernut7","Sep 07, 2002"

4.02,-4.5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"The first thing I notice about this brew is the high amount of carbonation present.  Need to pour this one carefully.  The second thing I notice is a very strong aroma.  Pretty nice.  Somewhat fruity and phenolic. Some leather.  And sweet candy.  This beer is a chill hazed amber and shows an incredible amount of carbonation in the body of the beer as well.  CO2 bubbles rising to the surface faster than I can remember in a beer for a long time.  A huge sticky and rocky white head tops this brew.  The taste is very forthcoming.  Raw leather.  Musty attic.  Some bubblegum esters.  Subdued fruitiness.  Earthy, herbal and spicy.  And fairly bitter to boot.  This may not be my favorite Belgian beer so far, but I do like the character that this one shows.  A light bodied beer that doesn't feel as carbonated in the mouth as it looks to be on sight.  This is no La Fin du Monde, but it's nice in its own way.","Bighuge","Aug 19, 2002"
4.63,10,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Of all the Trappist beers, I feel that the Orval is the most distinctive and unique - and probably the most misunderstood (or disliked) of the group. It can be a challenging beer at first, but it has great character if given a chance. It pours a lightly hazy pale orange-amber with a dense rocky head that lasts; eventually dropping to a thin creamy covering and leaving a beautiful Belgian-lace throughout the goblet. The tiny bubbles rising quickly through the beer make for a delightful little floor show! The high level of carbonation that produces the strong head, also helps it to give off it's very perfumy aroma. Clearly, there are some earthy British hops involved, Goldings and possibly Fuggles, amongst other noble varieties. In fact, I think this is the only Trappist beer that is dry-hopped (w/ Goldings)! It's fermented with 2 strains of yeast giving it enticingly complex aromas of leather, mineral, and wood. Again, the carbonation gives the beer a spritzy mouthfeel, making the body seem a little bigger than it is. The flavor follows the aroma with lots of dried fruit, and a sometimes ""metallic"" and intense dryness, leading into a somewhat acidic finish that leaves you with a memory of the beer that is more refreshing than mouth-coating.","NeroFiddled","Jul 29, 2002"

Light-bodied despite a good amount of bottle feremented carbonation working its way out. Finishes extremely clean. There's a vinous and bitter flavor that's not for me, Bretts not working for me here. Obviously an icon in brewdom, Orval Trappist takes the Belgian Pale style to the limit. I'll give it a good rating on smell and across the board 4s on the rest. Not to my taste.","ADR","Jun 10, 2002"
4.18,-0.7,5,4.5,4,3,4.5,"The head is absolutely formidable--  incredibly dense, rocky, thick and sticky.  Combined w/ the copious, lively bubbling and clear, light amber hue, this beer is vibrant and visually appealing.  The aroma consists of black licorice, pepper, green apple acetaldehyde and sweet orange candy - like notes, w/ just a hint of phenol in the finish.  The flavor is comprised of caramelized sugar notes, w/ a hint of black pepper.  Most striking about the flavor of Orval is the relatively assertive hop bitterness that prevents malt sweetness from becoming dominant.  When combined with the relatively light body for style, Orval is almost dry, and is thus very drinkable.  The finish is dry, bitter, and a bit tart. Although the flavor doesn't deliver on the promise of the aroma, Orval is still an intense and unique beer.","marc77","Jun 09, 2002"

This of course gives it a slightly fizzy taste.  The aroma is different a mixture of citrus and others that almost imparts(to me at least) a bubblegum smell.

The color looked inviting enough, but the big citrus smell was immediate. The flavor was ok, but was overwhelmed by the carbonation. The freshness date was 01082005, which may explain the taste.
