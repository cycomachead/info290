"This is a beer that isn't exactly going to wow anyone, but it really isn't all that bad and would be a good craft beer to have on hand if you're expecting company and want to offer something a little bit different than your standard Big American 3."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: It’s OK. Drinkable, inoffensive, but rather bland. If I have to order an orange flavored macrobrew, Shock Top is still my first choice. I suppose this would do in a pinch."

"Brown in color with excellent clarity. A fingernail of white foam covers most of the top of the beer. Light Brussels lacing. Faint aroma of light malt and not much else. The taste is a gentle spicy and somewhat earthy light malt. Body is moderately carbonated."

"I used to drink a lot of beer--but it was just commercial garbage like Millers or Coors. This is a Coors product, but I sure think that it's a step in the right direction. It was kind of a stepping stone for me, although a few other beers were too, namely Leinenkugels and Shock-Top. I like this beer. It's light, it's perfect for drinking when the weather is warmer. It has a nice taste that is refreshing. I love the citrus taste and the spice after taste. It's the perfect after work beer, it's what I buy for parties now, and it is the beer to get when you end up in a place that doesn't serve micros. It has a light head, which is nice when you are looking for something refreshing. It's my everyday beer now, and I really like it, but it in no way has kept me from learning more about and trying other types of beer."
""
""
"330 ml. bottle, label reads ""Blue Moon"" and ""Blue Moon Brewing Co. I guess they try to hide is from Coors. Hazy pale colour, with a samll head that fades to nothing in a short time, leaving a small lace. Smell of citrus and grains, with some skunky and artificial notes. Carbonation is good for a soft drink., decent and refreshing palate. Taste of citrus and some spice. And soft drink., everything very faint. Not bad for a Coors, but nothing I'll try again. And aobut the Belgian Pale Ale.... strange mis betwwen that and a Belgian White, it doesn't work."

"3.34/5.00"

"What a rough punch this beer packs! Or what do you call a flavor that hijacks the entire beer drinking experience? Not really a Belgian, and less so a pale ale. This is a strange beer that will baffle you, so try it if you are a die hard--or else pass!"

"Needless to say I am a little bias when rating this beer. This is my favorite beer flavor and all. I must say however, I do not enjoy it in the bottle, I prefer this beer on draft. A crisp orange to top it off makes this beer delicious. It is a very common beer that most enjoy."
""
""
""
"Have to drink it on tap and with an orange! Very full, crisp, smooth mouthfeel. If you want to step up from the run of the mill light beers to dip your toe into a more flavorful beer I think this is a good beer to do it with. There is not much risk involved with trying this beer. There is a slight heaviness that comes along with enjoying this beer."

""

""
"Tastes of tea and sweet raisin emerge from a weak body. Bits of malt and candied sugary sweetness can be found which makes me wonder if the brewers had the budget I think they could achieve a very tasty brew. This beer screams inexpensive for mass appeal but I think it could be so much more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It would need a nice yeasty kick, a better grain built in the back and a some bitterness to be a real belgian style pale."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep copper with almost ruby red cast, moderate bubbles rising, and a dense ecru cap. Aroma is first a light dose of citrusy, herbal, green hops and then toasted hawaiian bread and some extra candy sugar sweetness. Mostly lightly toasted malt in the taste, a bit woody and flat, just a bit of herbal/grassy hops, and just a bit of metallic twang. Mouth is a bit thin but fairly juicy initially then drying. Not really alot going on here - pale ale? not really; Belgian? don't taste anything Belgian; more of a generic amber ale."
""
""
"It's smells funky and tastes even worse. If a cow chewed on wheat and you took the drool from it's big ol' cow lips and bottled it, you would have this beer. It tastes stale and repugnant at the same time. Go ahead, stick an orange in it. It won't help."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have avoided this because it's from Coors; however, limited choices at my local grocer prompted me to finally give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised by the balanced flavors and body. This is one of the big boys' most notable attempts at craft type brewing (ie, flavor) and I applaud their effort. I would buy this again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Sessionable. Hard to hate, easy to overlook. But as said, very drinkable and enjoyable."
""
"O - Overall this isn't a bad beer and I would drink it again, I would give it a 3.25/5. I found it in a bewer's winter sample kit. I can't wait for the next seasonal one!"

"I hate to give such a generic review, but I bought this variety pack of Blue Moon beers that included Valencia Grove Amber, Belgian Style Pale Ale, Sunshine Citrus Blonde, and Belgian White and, sad to say, the only one that tasted okay was the Belgian White. The other three beers tasted like they were the same beers put in different labeled bottles."
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but nothing exceptional either, this is a solid, simple pale ale, refreshing on it's own, but the crisp bitterness would be perfect with fish and chips, the sharp tang complimenting tarter sauce and vinegar. Cheers!"
"I would have guessed that this was an easy going amber ale. Reminds me of that in between sort of beer that isn't really ""craft"" but is definitely better than piss lager. Michelob Amber Bock, Killian's Irish Red, Pete's WIcked Ale, and the like. This might be one notch above it's macro-brewed bretheren, but its still pretty plain."

"O - I'm not a big fan of Belgians, but this is decent."
"Overall - Honestly, this beer is delicious. But it tastes nothing like a pale ale to me. I think the strong caramel flavor masks the pale ale characteristics of the beer. In my opinion it is similar to a brown ale."
""
""
""
"O: slightly above average. Best suited for transitional (towards craft beers) beer drinkers."

"O: a decent brew. Great for the holidays, but probably wouldn't drink it every night. I'd recommend it to a friend if try hadn't had it before."
""
""
""
"Overall- This not as hoppy as I was expecting from a pale ale. Doesn't take like anything Belgian that I have had before either. Still very drinkable thought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Pretty decent attempt to keep the BM characteristic all while having something hopheads could actually enjoy. Solid beer that makes getting the Winter sampler worth getting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is somewhat easy to drink but it is much too sweet for the style and is slightly out of balance between the malts and the hops (almost like there is a slight lack of hops). Moderate amounts of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Smell was hiding a little bit in this brew. Flavor seemed to be a little syrupy at times, too sweet, but the hops were pleasant. Way to low of carbonation."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.. Pours a nice copper color with a small white head that leaves a little lacing. Smells really fruity, not terribly surprising, but a little for the type of beer. Tastes of barley grain and some earthy hops. Beer is a little bit overcarbonated but goes down great for its light body. Overall, a slightly above average beer."

""
""

""
""

""
"O: Overall an ok beer would drink it again."
"Overall: Overall, an unimpressive attempt at a Belgian style. Nothing awful, just nothing exceedingly memorable."
""
"Drinkable yes, with enough sweetness to use in the proverbial marinade for chicken or pork. Would work as an entry level beer for Belgian newbies looking to get their feet wet with a non intimidating new kinda beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd accept the drink if offered to or bought for me, but I wouldn't search this one out to buy it. I mean, it's still beer, and I'll be sure to not waste it, but I wouldn't buy it."
""
""
"O: I agree with another review, not sure what makes this a belgian, and it seemed a tad too malty for a pale ale. Theres several blue moons i prefer to this."
""
""
""
""
"O - Honestly, this has no qualities that resemble a Belgian Pale. It's almost as if Coors tried (and failed) to mimic the taste without using any Belgian yeasts strains. As a beer? Not bad at all; in fact I kinda enjoyed it. As a Belgian? TERRIBLE."
""
""
"O: Would definitely drink some more, and plan on it soon. The 5.4% is a great bonus too.. very enjoyable after a hard days work. I have not been impressed with much from Blue Moon lately, but this one.. I can say is impressively different!"

"Nothing offensive here, except this isn't a belgain pale ale in my book. Malt flavors are a lot like a vienna lager and really not that bad - it's just not a Bel. pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"There's nothing about this beer that remotely resembles a Belgian Pale Ale in any way. It's not a terrible beer, but it's much more like an American pale or even a cream ale. I find it hard to belief they even used a Belgian yeast strain on this. If they did, they found a way to get a bizarrely different flavor from it than anyone else. The beer, for what its worth, is not too bad and easy enough to drink, kind of bland though. But don't buy this if you want to try a BPA."

"Poured a dark copper with a little over a fingers worth of head. No lacing at all. Smells of very sweet candy, sweet fruit, and agave. I HATE agave. Tastes of the mildest hops I have ever witnessed. Sweet cherry follows the hops, And reminded me of a nice German dunkel. Also has a weird penny-like taste far off in the distance. The taste is very odd to say the least, Although fairly good. The mouthfeel brings out a hell of a lot of sour cherry. WAY too sour for that matter. Took this beer from being fairly good to some kinda girly wine cooler. Overall, This beer was okay. Interesting flavor, But that's about it. I wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad pale ale here. Certainly the most enjoyable Blue Moon product I've come across. This won't blow the roof off the beer world, but it's approachable and entirely drinkable. Reminiscent of the Steelhead Extra Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"-Overall 3.0: Overall, not a bad beer. I don't understand why they felt the need to put hibiscus in it, but hey, there you go. I could also taste the orange peel that they claim is in it, so I guess they thought: hey, let's throw some plant juice in there, too. Regardless, this is an ok beer and could function as a session beer. Watch that 5.4 ABV, though."
"This beer was kind of boring. For a Belgian style I expect a lot more flavor. Even for a guy that doesn't like the normal flavor profiles of the style, I'm terribly unimpressed. I guess this is where the fact that Coors brews the stuff becomes obvious. The yeasty, spicey flavor is somewhere in there, but it's not worth finding."

"Ummm... I don't think so. Unfortunately I didn't drink this before Coors got their hands on it so I'm not sure, but it's complete garbage if we're going to characterize this as a Belgian Pale Ale. Zero head, not much carbonation, clear rust in colour. Lacking in any real depth. Smells like honey and malt, but I don't detect any yeast - a hallmark of the Belgian. Quite malty and sweet in taste, but not well-balanced. Nice dry finish. Never buying this again."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a amberish color with a 1/2 inch head.Smell is a bit fruity, some malts. Taste is malty, some fruits, easy drinking and refreshing.Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall not the best of this style but a decent beer."
"This is not like many BPAs out there. It doesn't have any hint of Belgian yeast nor the traditional spices. It's primarily caramel and some faint floral hops. It's a pass for me. This won't impress any fans of Belgian ales."

"Atmosphere is okay. Nice hue, but no head or lacing. Nose is full and robust with a woody and Italian spice character. Flavor is robust and malty with a pungent aftertaste. Overall, this is pretty good quaff."

"Pours a translucent copper color with a moderate off-white head that dissipates in short order. The aroma is mild and unimpressive. The first sip was actually not bad, yielding a mild, somewhat wheaty flavor with a hint of orange. The honeymoon ends there though, with subsequent sips unmasking a mishmash of dilute wheat and nickel (I don't supposed I've ever actually tasted nickel, but I expect it would taste an awful lot like this). A cheap, wheaty fog lingers in the back of the throat for way too long, and further imbibing offers little relief. The label touts cascade hops, though their presence is subtle and used to ill effect. I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this brew, but this manages to fall short of even my paltry expectations."
"From the summer variety pack. Pours clear copper with one finger of white head. Some minor lacing. Smell is floral and citrus. Taste is sweet tangy malts , tart yeastiness, and minor citrus hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with perfect carbonation. Finishes medium dry. Good emulation of the style. Nice introduction to Belgian Pale Ale from an American perspective."
""
""
"o - not a great beer, not a bad beer, considering i spent a dollar a bottle, much better than i expected"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is okay. Maybe it could convert some one to craft beer."
""

"Overall I enjoyed this beer. The smell was a little off but the flavor and mouthfeel was good. Worth a try and very drinkable at 5.4%."
""
""
""
"Pale Moon pours a copper-amber with a thin, off-white head, with very light lacing. The nose is quite light, with hints of caramel, toasted, and biscuity malt notes present, as well as some orange peel and spice. As noticed in the nose, this beer features a heavy malt presence out front, and very little hop profile noticeable. This medium bodied ale has a smooth mouthfeel and a medium amount of carbonation. Nothing too out of the ordinary for a Belgian Pale Ale, but for the price and the ease of locating, a good deal."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from brown 12oz bottle to pint glass the beer pours a translucent ruby amber color with a decent finger's width whitish head, decent retention and lacing. The nose is somewhat muted but consists of citrus and wheat with a hint of spice, coriander? The flavor starts with a malty sweet base from which the citrus fruit character and wheat builds. Mildly bitter with a good hop character. Finishes slightly dry and crisp. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, an easy drinking pale ale. I wouldn't go and actively pursue it but I wouldn't refuse it either."

"O. Forgettable."
""
"O: This beer seemed to be a bit too malty and sweet for the style and could have used some more hop bitterness. It’s definitely not as drinkable compared to the Blue Moon witbier."
""
"Overall – This is a rather average brew. Of the Blue Moon varieties this one is likely on the lower end of the scale. It’s OK, but I would take other Blue Moon varieties over this one if given the chance."

"Finally finishing my Blue Moon Winter variety pack. Damn, it's been a while... This stuff pours a clear tawny-amber topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, biscuit, light greens, and a touch of orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, though the greens are joined by strong grass and light pine needles to form a gang of bittering hooligans that mess with the already kinda so-so status quo. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pedestrian BPA at best, one that tries too hard to be all Belgain-y and pale ale-y without actually succeeding much at either."
""
""
""
"Pours a copper/amber color with a bubbly head the slowly disappears. Has some mild scents of hops and some grains. Has a slighty bitter tone to the taste. Some bready dough and yeast tastes as well. Has an overall dryer taste than most of the Blue Moon line. Crisp and extremely drinkable, but nothing too special about it. Decent for a Macro-brew, but about average among mirco-brews."
""
"Overall - Some pretty good flavors going on here for a macro brew, a pleasant surprise."
"Taste is citrusy, slightly sweet and grassy; overall pleasant on the tounge with just enough bittering from the hops to save it from being too soda-like."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, nothing bad, nothing special. Something to throw back without thinking too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is definitely not a Belgian pale ale, by any means, but it is a decent drink. I would not buy this beer for myself."
""
"Not bad. I would prefer Harvest moon over it, but I'd say pretty close. I have always like Blue moon, never really loved it though. Maybe it is because I prefer darker and more hopped beers. In the summer when I'm am looking for a descent beer to casually drink, I will more often then none choose Blue Moon. A little sweet though sometimes."

"Poured this Belgian Pale Ale from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a amber color, produced a off white head with average retention and below average lacing. The aroma of the ale was faint, wheat and coriander. Light in body, this ale is very sweet, some toasted malt, very fruity although i cant put my finger on the fruit. not a lot of balance here- not much to talk about other then its just not a very good beer."
"O- A style that blue moon did not try too hard to make. will not buy again."
""
""
""
"I don't know why they call it a Belgian Pale Ale. Tolerable, but not special in any way. Won't seek out ever."
""
""
""
""
"OK, but not fabulous. This is a very safe Belgian that doesn't take any chances."
""
"Overall, crisp and and light. Seems more like an adjunct lager than any type of ale."
""
""
""
"O: A mid range ale, made by one of the big giants Coors... but i wont knock it without giving a fair shot, and it impressed me a little bit. This is an example of consumerism affecting the market and big corporations trying to buy into the small craft brew scene."
""
"It deff has some nice flavor for something out of the Coors Brewery. Malty, yeasty, with a bit of spices. Easy drinker, and probably one of the best macros out there. I got this as part of the winter sampler and would buy again (in a pinch)."
""

"It's interesting. Not amazing, but interesting and fun. I wouldn't want more than one at a time. It seems drinkable until you get far into it and then it grows old."
"overall = My favorite of the ""Moon"" series. If you like blue moon, but think its too complex or heavy, definitely try this beer."
"O: Yum. I'd get again. Better than the Blue Moon IMO."
"O: Decent brew with more flavor than I am used to from its brewery. I actually enjoyed this beer and am relatively surprised."
"Finally got around to trying this one out. I must say... people are being way too harsh on this beer. Being that it's from BMC, it's a stab at a rare style from them and it's actually pretty good and refreshing. Nice floral aroma, touch of hops and some dark malts, finishes smooth. Not the best belgian pale ale I've ever had but definitely above average. For the price, it's hard to beat and well worth a try if you just ignore the label."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a off white head. In the aroma, a sweet fruitiness and a faint dry yeatiness. In the taste, dry sugar to a sweet fruitiness. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. It is ok, somewhat pedestrian."
"O: I wasn't a big fan of this one. It didn't seem like this was a good example for the style, nor a good beer overall. I'd pass on this in the future."
"I enjoy the occasional Blue Moon Ale, but this beer really disappointed. It lacks any decent qualities and I don't know who would drink it --- too void of flavor for craft beer drinkers and not enough for main stream drinkers to consume."
"O: eh, drinkable, not much in taste, intense carbonation hurts a bit, really just not much all together"
"Pours to a thin white head with no lacing and clear amber-orange color. Aroma is a malty forefront with a spicy background. Flavor is a balanced blend of sweet malt and muted hops. Some of the added spices were detected but not overpowering, a good subtle effect. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is adequate. Overall, this is a tasty beer but not anything that would satisfy hop-hungry craft beer drinkers. That is why it gets such mediocre marks here."
"Overall: Nice and mild, slightly roasty. Very easy drinking, and pleasant."
"i work at a grocery store that stocks this and am pretty sure we sell a 6 pack per week. shame, it deserves better than that"
"Overall, this is not a bad beer at all--and I am no fan of the Coors company. As long as the price is right--and it was with this--It won't be my last one."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. It's a little generic in taste, but not boring either. Still tastes good."
"I was pretty disappointed with this beer. The sight and smell made me think it was going to have some bite. Quite the opposite - bland and forgettable."
"Dr: Pretty drinkable, quite affordable for an import, and decent quality. I'd have it again - especially if it were on draught."
"Unbiased - didn't know it was a Coors when I bought the six-pack. Certainly drinkable and quite pleasant as a first beer after emerging from ""Irene"" hibernation. Maybe not the long taste of a Belgian but I would put it in with other Pale Ales. 5 to go which will be nice when I get to them."
"Belgian Pale is a style of beer underrepresented in American craft beer. Pale Moon showcases enough Belgian yeast ester to stand out from a regular pale ale yet still be sessionable. If you want to taste a little yeast in your pale and experience a good introduction to a somewhat obscure style. Give this one a try."
"Overall, I definitely preferred this beer over Blue Moon's Honey Wheat beer. This one aligns itself more closely to the pale ale style than Honey Wheat ever will to its respective style."
"Maybe the best of the Blue Moon series, very enjoyable, but still not as good as a craft beer."
"It is not a bad brew on the palate, the toasted malt and light wheat character add an interesting twist, it's just that this is waaay different than any Belgian Pale I have ever had. It seems like it would fare decently well in an Amber Ale category though. The yeast is very weak, barely adding even a modest fruit character...very un-belgian. Its a malt driven beer with a nice creamy body and adequate carbonation. I guess my scores reflect a combo of stylistic fit and plain ol enjoyability...as a BPA it would get a D, but as an Amber Ale of some sort would probably get a B. I didnt have much difficulty finishing my 12 oz sample and we'll leave it at that."
"Flavor is similarly light in body, touching on citrics but only perfunctorily. Hibiscus jumps in for a minute too. Wheat like in terms of drinkability. Light overall. Not desirable, but acceptable."
"This beer poured out as an amber color, it has a light tan head on top that leaves a light lacing. The smell of the beer has a decent malt aroma with a touch of spicy hops. The taste was crisp and malty. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and medium bodied. Overall this beer was pretty good surprisingly."
"O - Nothing stands out about this beer. I got this as part of a mixed six pack of ""extra beer"" from a friend after a party ... glad I didn't pay for it."
"a good beer. not very complicated, but its nice to see coors trying to make an ale and not look like fools doing it."
"O: overall, one of the better offerings from Blue Moon. Well enjoyed."
"From the style description, in lieu of direction on the bottle: ""They should be decanted properly, leaving the yeast in the bottle."" I did not see much (if any) yeast in the bottle, but I bore it in mind as I poured. I am pretty sure that this was filtered, but I was careful all the same, which resulted in mere wisps for head. Win some, lose some. Color was a deep-amber with NE-quality clarity (""CU -colored? Who they tryin' ta zoom?). Nose had a distinctive honey odor - could this be what the hibiscus was adding, if anything? Mouthfeel was actually pretty full, not outright creamy, but close. The taste was bland for all of the adjuncts that they mention. It was pale, all right, pale in flavor. I got a tea-like flavor in the mouth and whether it could be attributed to either the hibiscus or the hops, I do not know. Finish was grassy, somewhat tea-like, but just not a lot happening. This was not bad, just boring."
"A decent beer. If Blue Moon products were sold at a price reflecting their quality they would be a constant in my fridge. I hope they lower the price a few dollars soon (yea, that’ll happen)."
"not a bad beer but not my cup o tea."
"Pale Moon is a very clear, very sparkling, light amber ale with a sparse, off white head that quickly dissipates. It has a faint aroma of light grain and a little spice. There is a note of apple. It has a very lively medium light body with a slightly gritty finish. It's pretty lightly flavored and well balanced. There are some fruity esters and a little phenol. A botanical bitterness comes at the finish. I wouldn't go after one of these on purpose, but it's certainly a better option than most macro brews."
"Again, another very ordinary beer from Coors. The style suggests at least some complexity, but this beer, much like the Blue Moon flagship witbier, is dull and lacking of so many elements. A watery imposter."
"Picked this one up as part of a mixed six pack, only because I'd never had it. Worse than Blue Moon, and really devoid of any character whatsoever. Poured a decent copper color with minimal head. Not much going on aroma-wise, aside from a little malt. On the palate, light to medium bodied, with a little malt and some apple skins."
"tastes like nothing. Beer is medium to light in body, really thin no flavors at all...nothing...HELLO!!!! Bargh! What a waste."
"I am not a Belgium Pale Ale expert....so I really don't know if Blue Moon nailed this beer or not. I will say that this is a decent beer and worth a taste. The color was more amber and clear. There was not head and it did not lace (obviously). The nose was disappointing for me cuz I could not smell much of anything. Usually I like to smell some hop, pine, citrus, or something with my pales...but not here. The taste was decent...nicely balanced....and not ""overly Belgiumie""....I am not a fan of Belgium style beers. Mouthfeel is good and definitely worth a taste."
"Overall. Eh, I feel like for an American interpretation Fat tire wows me a bit more. This one isn't bad but overall I'm unimpressed."
"O: Have had my share of this a few years back, but now it gives me a headache, to be honest, not sure why. As a faux craft beer, it's average. As a Belgian Pale ale, it fails, imho. It has it's place though. As for me, when I see a non BA, or non-craft beer enthusiast drinking this, I see someone that knows there is flavor in beers beyond Adjunct lagers. Basically it's a gateway to better beer, imho, and for that, it has its place."
"For a Coors offering, not bad and certainly way better than the crap they usually make. It is not as good as blue moon, and certainly not deserving of the title of Belgian pale ale. Pretty weak for the style, but not terrible overall."
"M & D - not that fanastic. Mild and bland in general. Drinkable on a hot day but of all the brews out there, this isn't anywhere near a must have for anyone."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked JUN0611-DO5102219. Sampled on March 27, 2011. Its amber-copper color is about right for a standard pale ale but I was hoping for something with less clarity. Caramel malts and maybe a dash of clove are evident in the aroma with a slight touch of yeast toward the back. The body comes in at around medium. Sweet malts prevail in the taste rather than the wheat, spices, and yeast elements I have come to associate with this style. But there is a slight hop bite at the end."
"D - Drinks nicely-very sessionable, it's thinner for a pale ale, but it's nice. I'm not sure how it's a Belgian pale in style though..."
"A pretty good beer, but watered down. Drinks fine and is interesting enough to keep interest if in a pinch. It appears Coors is trying to compete seriously in the craft market. They have some work to do, but are doing more than the other big beer companies."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is between light and medium bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. It's probably the smoothest drinking Blue Moon incarnation I've had though. It's fairly drinkable, but calling this a Belgian Pale Ale is a bit of a crime in my opinion."
"D- This beer is classified as a Belgian Style Pale Ale, it is 115% better than blue moon the original. It was surprisingly delicious, but is not delicious for its style. If this was labeled an English Bitter I would have rated it an A, very reminiscent of Old Thumper with a bit more hoppy life to it."
"Thin offwhite head that dissipates into a ring around the rim rather quickly. Amber body with a hint of redness. Extreme floral scent. Smells like potpourri and grass. Very complex flavor, but not very balanced for my preferences, which don't tend to favor overbearing hoppiness. An assault on the tongue with medium hop bitterness and overbearing grassy notes. I'm not a fan of pale ales, but I will do my best to grade within a style I'm not familiar with. I think the hoppy bitterness is probably balanced within the style (if not to my liking), with strong notes of tobacco and acetaldehyde. I imagine this would go over well with the PA crowd. Smooth mouthfeel and finish. If I felt particularly violent and manly, I might drink a few of these on a given night. They just feel aggressive in my mouth."
"I cant promote a beer that needs an orange slice to make it taste better or at least try to taste better. I tried a pint of this and could not drink anymore after that pint. I had to switch beers. To me this might be more of a ladies type of beer, I cant see a bar full of men drinking beer with oranges in it."
"Ive usually have the original Blue Moon and I was impressed with the pal ale version...still holds true to the citrus flavor that reminds you its a Blue Moon....I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Blue Moon and a good tasting pale ale with a crisp orange taste.."
"d-very...not too controversial but solid for the line."
"It's been my favorite of the Blue Moon varieties so far and I would drink it again because its really not bad for a beer that is easily accessable and not overly pricey."
"It's good but the orange flavor is a little overpowering I don't know if I could drink very many."
"Served chilled, poured into an American pint glass. Pours a translucent hazel colour, with a thin nut brown head that dissipates quickly. Smells of nut as well. Very mild in flavor, a little syrupy on the finish, well rounded. Not as bitter as I've come to expect from a pale ale, and much richer. Minimal carbonation. I wasn't anticipating enjoying this beer, but it has paid off very well. Entirely drinkable."
"Pours a deep hazed orange color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of spice and citrus as well as that typical witbier smell. Tastes of light spices, a little hops, and a little orange citrus flavor. Mouthfeel is normal for style and carbonation is high. Drinkability is decent."
"More of the same in flavor with caramel and some orange flavors up front and some spice after that. Finishes a bit sweet yet offers a flash of roasted bitterness on the finish. Comes across as an English Pale in body and feel given the light carbonation."
"Overall this was not a bad beer, I wouldn't seek it out over other pale ales on the market but definetly wouldn't turn this one down."
"not undrinkable and a nice try."
"This beer is an excellent beer for beginning beer drinkers, or someone who is brand new to the craft beer world, because it is extremely drinkable for a pale ale. With all that being said, it isn't a very good beer, it's not horrible, but it is pretty close to being a below average beer. The aroma is very light, you only pick up a slight smell of hops and floral notes. The appearance isn't horrible, not much head at all, disappears quickly. But the Lacing is decent, definitely the best factor appearance wise. The taste is just like the smell, only a slight hop bite, only a tiny bit of a floral taste, you do get a nice unique taste from the hibiscus, but that is really the only redeeming factor taste wise. For a pale ale there just is no where near as much hops as there should be in this beer."
"Curious and well-done, and quite drinkable. I'd consider this one a 'starter' towards moving into the more complex IPAs."
"overall it was better then most of their offerings but again that is not saying alot. still worked for a quick refresher before more shoveling."
"Overall, Pale Moon is another respectable entry from Coors' foray into craft beer. As is the case with most of the beers in this line-up; it's a toned down version of the style that the average beer drinker will try & like. You can do better, but you can definitely do worse too."
"Pale Moon comes out a lovely amber color with brownish highlights. Medium thick, firm foam head. Visible carbonation from the nucleation point of the Perfect Pint. Aromatic, sweetly hoppy balanced smell, malts just a touch off, can't put my finger on it. Easily the best aroma from any Coors product I've ever had. Taste is mildly hopped with a nice biscuity malt backbone. Sturdy taste, more good balance. I pick up some strange sort of ham-like flavors. Feel is still a little thin, more body needed. Overall, a pretty sessionable beer, and probably the best of the Blue Moon lineup. More flavor and aroma here than the usual ""craft"" beers from BMC."
"A half decent try at the mid-range pale ales of Belgium. Its tried to be some where between Fat Tire and De Koninck and Palm Ale but lands somewhere else."
"I poured this beer into a glass, i has a nice copper color with not a lot of head to it. The aroma isn't much to talk about, a lite smell of carmel and you need to search for that. The taste is of sweet malts and a bit of hops. The mouth feel is very smooth and i think it is very drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is alright, it feels a little under-carbonated but otherwise is alright. It's also a pretty drinkable beer, there's no problems drinking this. This is an alright beer. It's not worth buying the Blue Moon 12 pack sampler just to try, but if you like the normal Blue Moon and the seasonal, it's not a bad throw-in."
"This is the best if the ""Moon"" brews. Pours a nice clear copper color with decent lasting head. Smells of faint Belgian aromas and a nice pop of American hops. Taste follows suit. Some light Belgian stylings with decent (Cascade?) hops on the palate. I actually really liked this with a bowl of spicy chili. Wish I had another to follow up with. Worth a try."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very nice pale and Munich malt scent along with a mild yeast fruitiness. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth pale malt flavor along with a delicate hop bitterness and a good yeast fruitiness. The esters aren't as pronounced as a traditional BPA, but the subtle character suits this well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good starter Belgian ale. It's nothing like the traditional style, but for people who are new to yeast esters it's a solid choice."
"Overall: Definitely my least favorite in the Blue Moon family."
"Drink- Just wanted to try it. Probably wont have it again."
"Notes: Didn't really wow me nor did this really remind me of a Belgian Pale Ale (or any Belgian ale). Wasn't a big fan of this, all I really picked up was some spice and herbal/tea flavors on top of some caramel malt. Was pretty bland with those flavors as well. I would just rather grab a Blue Moon than this if I were picking up a beer from this line."
"D: i can drink alot of these no problem yummy beer"
"So judging it as its own, weird thing, this is okay. It's not a Belgian Pale, and I frankly don't like that it's labeled as such because this is a crossover beer and beergeek neophytes shouldn't be told that this is something that it ain't. But aside from that, this is okay. Not great, but totally okay."
"D- This beer is drinkable. I really didn't mind it and actually found it to be above average in the realm of Coors and it's profile."
"Pale Moon is not my preferred Belgian Pale Ale, however, a good entry point to the more complex Belgian Pale Ales."
"D - Cha-ching! Here's what they can take straight to the bank: drinkability. It's lacking everywhere else but it certainly does have drinkability! I, however, find it to be empty calories with no flavor so I'll be handing this pint to my brother."
"Drinkability: A really sub-par beer if they're aiming for a Belgian Pale Ale. However, it's not THAT bad if you think of it as a Coors product. Still, it's not something I think I'll have again anytime soon."
"D: This was certainly a pleasant surprise. It won't cause you to redefine your conception of Belgians, but it has distinct strong flavors, a rarity for BMC."
"Very clear for a pale ale, this orange-amber colored beer pours with a cloud-like finger and a half head. Smells strongly of cascade hops and light spices, which is contrary to the taste, very light in flavor. Very thin bodied, but easily drinkable. A good beginner's pale ale."
"Nothing totally offensive, but it drinks more like a spiced American amber than a Belgian pale ale. There's such a high standard for Belgians of any variety, this sort of so-so American attempt is pretty weak if you're a fan of the real deal. But in a blind taste test, you could enjoy a few of these on a hot summer day and not be ashamed of it."
"D- malty, no smell, but not disgusting. Sessionable for sure, but not very enjoyable."
"Poured out 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer had a good head on it that left a slight bit of lace on the sides as it disappeared. The orange color was very clear and showed a lot of carbonation. The aroma lent a bit of hoppiness and a tad of citrus. The taste was very crisp and fresh. A fairly decent tasting pale ale. Not overpowering a decently light. Very drinkable beer."
"D: Not terrible, though not a suggested introduction as to how great the best Belgian pale ales really are. Even some above average ones are way better than this one. Decent drinkability; not offensive, but nothing spectacular. At least it isn't nowhere near as bad as Honey Moon."
"Easily my favorite Blue Moon brew to date. Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Slight copper color, one finger head dissipating into nothingness. Smell was biscuit-y and mild. Taste was slightly hoppy but nothing compared to real pale ales. Mouthfeel was medium with big bubbles. Drinkability was very good. This would be a good introduction to some to the pale ale world until they can try a real one."
"Not too much going on with it, but it is overall a pretty smooth and drinkable Pale. Don't turn your nose up at it based on the label."
"Drinkability - Not really. Been sitting on this for a while because it is not the greatest thing. Oh well..."
"Blue Moon Brewing Company--Adolph J. Coors Brewing Company--Pale Moon Belgian-Style Pale Ale--This Belgian-Style Pale Ale is brewed with Cascade hops and a touch of hibiscus & orange peel.--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.40% ABV. 15 IBU's? (3.25 / 5.0) Pale Ale--Belgian. Big mild lace white head. Clear rich bright amber gold red hint color. Odd Belgian Cascade hop hibiscus orange zest hint front. Thin mild sweet doughy Belgian caramel malt orange hint bland Pale Ale body. Clean refreshing mild hop end. Satisfying, but odd. Not quite Cascade hoppy, or hibiscus flowery, or orange citrus, or Belgian flavor. Sampled 6/29/2010. 6-Pack $6.99."
"Pours a paler copper color with a one finger head that actually stays around with no lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt with a hint of floral hops. THe aroma is very faint and hard to get a grasp on. The taste is of caramel malt with some breadiness along with a hint of citrus. The floral hops is not really in the taste. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is good you could have more than one, not as strong in aroma and taste as some pale ales but decent overall."
"Drinkability: The best Blue Moon/ coors product Ive had to date."
"Pale moon, poured a typical pale ale color, with a smaller head. The smell was typical of a pale ale, but much weaker. The taste was also the same, typical pale ale, dry and bitter, but had an almost watered down flavor. It was easier to drink then other pale ales. Overall not bad, there is certinaly better out there though."
"D- this was a nice gesture, but its not something i can see myself buying. i will admit that this was a pleasant surprise."
"drinkability - this is by far the best beer i have had by coors but blue moon brews are still overpriced for what they are and i doubt i ever buy the summer mix 12 that this beer came in"
"D: Good. I'd love another at a sunny BBQ or a bar. I'd consider buying a sixer, but only as a second tier fallback."
"D: Easy to put down more than one of these, but why bother? Not something I'd try again."
"This beer pours a clear orange color with a white head. The aroma is strong biscuit malt. The flavor is wheat and some biscuit malt. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A average to below average beer, not something anyone should seek out."
"This beer pours dark golden or copper in color. This beer was difficult to pour as the head formation nearly foamed over. This beer has no mouth feel as it and finishes smooth. there is no hop aroma or bitterness, this beer is all sweet and malt flavor remains through out."
"Well - it's a far cry from ""Belgian-style"". There are mild, ""session"" Belgian-styles - this is not one of them. It's not ""bad", just has a certain blandness, and might appeal somewhat to macro drinkers who have not had true Belgian beers ... but there are mild, sessionable Belgians and Belgian-styles with more character..."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is sweet malt, orange peel, and a bit of hops. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, and it has a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and it has good carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and not hard to drink at all. Overall I think this is an average brew."
"Though carbonated, the taste is dull and flat. Unfortunately, it's one of those variety-pack beers that will prevent me from going variety pack. Short of awful, it's hardly worth trying."
"D: This is a pretty decent beer. The only bad thing is that as the beer warms, the orange really comes out and completely destroys the beer."
"D: Still very drinkable, maybe because I'm urning for more flavor but still enjoy the hops flavor that is detectable over the carbonation."
"D - Certainly drinkable, I could go for a few of these in a row."
"D. I would definately drink this brew again good character, balance, and flavor. I liked the citrus, malts, and hops. Best Coors beer I have drank to date."
"Overall, not severely impressed, but at the same time, not disappointed, I found that this beer was better consumed once warmer than initially out of the fridge."
"Overall, not one of the best beers I've ever tried, and definitely should not have been marketed as a Belgian Pale Ale - that's been the biggest mistake."
"I'd look for better examples of the style. It's run of the mill and still a bit more drinkable than other Coors products. It's just not on par with other examples."
"Pours an orange/amber color with a small white head. A mild hop character lay in the nose, sweet malts are the dominant aroma. I dont pick up the hibiscus flower too much in the aromatics but a floral/herbal character sits on the tongue late into the finish. Crisp, well carbonated, refreshing and easy to drink. Not bad."
"Drinkability: Nothing here particularly cries ""Belgian!"" However, it's reasonably likable and certainly more enjoyable than most of the mundane product Coors shuffles out the door."
"Overall, must have gotten a bad beer. I can't see why anyone would choose to drink this. maybe they just wanted to create a style that they could incorporate with the word ""moon"" somehow."
"Final Thoughts: By far and away the best of the Blue Moon lineup. This beer is about as close to a craft offering as BMC has gotten so far and I like it."
"Notes: Overall it's fairly simple and safe. Its note a stand out but it slides down nicely."
"Overall, not the best Belgium style beer I have had, but I didn't have that high of hopes as it is Blue Moon. I won't be having another one of these."
"I'd stick with blue moon. The carbonation level is way too high."
"Not necessarily a bad beer, but this beer should not be placed in the ring with the Rare Vos or Duvels of the world-- it's out of its class. ....and somebody, buy that Coors guy a real Belgian Pale!"
"Blue Moon in general is definitely a great gateway into craft beer for those raised on the American macrobrew, and this offering is no different."
"Pours a clear deep golden color with a small white head that settled into a thin ring. The aroma is a buttery malt, which is odd for the style, and some light spicy hops. The buttery aroma transfers over to the taste which mingles with coriander and orange peel. Not very sweet, no evidence of any candi sugar and no yeasty flavors that you typically see in a BPA. This is more of an EPA with coriander. Some very light spicy hops in the end. The feel is light but does have some body, fizzy carbonation makes this brew drink like seltzer, finishes a bit dry. Not very impressive for the style, missing some major components. That said, no real off flavors, easy enough to drink."
"Pretty good beer, might buy this one again for something a little different sometime."
"Justa very average beer."
"Pours copper brown very little head dissipates right away Smells overly malty no real hop aroma Taste is overly carbonated lots of malt some grain Not very yeasty Drinkable yet too carbonated Fair effort but Id rather have a different brand Belgian if I had the choice"
"Golden honey colored with a fizzy white head that dissapates pretty quickly, minimal lacing. Faint apple spiciness in the nose with mild hops. Tastes okay,Pale moon is to belgian pale what blue moon is to belgian wit, a sort of wimpier version for the typical macro drinking public.Has a medium bodied mouthfeel and really is pretty drinkable but nothing special."
"Drinkability is good on this pale ale. There is a good amount of tastes without any overbearing factors. The smooth drink makes this incredibly drinker. Not one of the greatest pale ales I've ever had, but I can see this one taking off in bars because it has a good amountof flavor to it and is still drinkable for a whole night."
"Color is a reddish clear with nice head. Smell is fantastic."
"Pours a clear amber hue with a quickly fleeting weak off white head with fine sporadic lacing not much for the eye let us smell. Aromtatics are better than expected with some hops flowing mild citrus notes and a very one dimensional artificial sweetness. Flavor is pretty weak with a touch of sweetness and blend of terrible spices, very weak and I wanna be a craft brew but I'm not feel can't really tolerate this brew. Mouthfeel is thin and weak with a horrible spice up after taste, drinkability as a whole rates very low in my book. I'm glad I bought a single to sample this sorry excuse for a Belgian pale."
"MF&D - Not bad for a Coors. Tasty and very drinkable."
"Drinkability, oh ya. Very smooth and easy. Goes down perfectly if not close. I hope they six pack this stuff. A hit im sure it would be."
"Taste: This is definitely the best tasting of all the ""Moon"" beers that Coors makes. At first it tastes like a lightly hopped pale ale but the bitter orange peels come through on the finish."
"Notes. My least favorite of the three ""Moons"" that I have tasted. (Blue, Full, Pale). I am not even sure that this can be considered a Pale Ale let alone a ""Belgian"" Pale Ale. Oh well."
"D- I've never been too fond of Blue Moon seasonal's. This is one of the few I could tolerate drinking. It's not too alcoholic and is rather plain(especially for the Belgian style)."
"The aroma is inviting with pine hops, yeast, bread, citrus and maybe a touch of spice. The elements are good but somehow they fail to completely impress. The appearance is deep gold with an orange hue. The head is average. The taste is not as complex as the aroma. It's got some soapy and astringent bitter elements but mostly it's got a macro twang to the malt and a touch of citrus. Like the aroma the taste doesn't work 100%. The palate is thin. Overall it's better than most macro's but suffers some of the same problems."
"Belgian-style Pale Ale might be misleading for this beer, but who cares if you enjoy it? A welcoming addition to the Blue Moon line of beers."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I would say this is what the Budweiser American Ale was striving for but fell way short. This is a much much more enjoyable option and a good solid beer all around."
"More of the same from the Blue Moon Brewing Company - a highly drinkable, delicious ale. The aroma and flavor are both quite fruity, although neither the orange nor hibiscus can be easily distinguished from the characteristic Cascade presence. If there is a true Belgian aspect to this pale ale, it's lost on me. But beyond that, this one has few flaws."
"D - A good, solid beer with plenty of flavor. I could see myself sessioning this stuff regularly. Overall a pleasant surprise."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the freebie. 12oz bottle into a Piraat snifter. Pours a crisp copper with a decent off-white head that slowly diminished to a ring. Aroma is a somewhat fragrant amount of crisp citrus hops and a hint of Belgian yeast. The taste is a litte bit more bland with some caramel malt and slight hops with a hint of yeast. The beer is somewhat crisp and refreshing but slightly heavier than the alcohol suggests. This is probably the best Blue Moon beer I've had yet, but that's not exactly saying that much."
"Considering its a 'macro' pale ale, this is a great pale ale. It was inexpensive and would be a fantastic starter beer for someone who hasn't tried a sturdier pale ale. Even on its own, it's really quite good."
"Drinks alright, not a good or great BPA, but would do in a pinch. a touch too dry for my liking"
"Drinkability: Found it very drinkable."
"So far, my favorite from the Blue Moon line outside of the original Blue Moon."
"Flavor profile brings a spicy-pine hop note paired with pale malts, fruity belgian yeast, and a metallic, grainy flavor seemingly inherent in most Coors beverages. Not too off-putting, though. Mouthfeel is a bit watered down...I'm not sure why they're so against the ""lingering hop aftertaste", because something is definately needed to finish off this beer. All in all, this one actually has potential, as I've certainly come across worse brews from the mass-producing BMC. I'd definately buy it over most grocery store beers, as it does have quite a few merits."
"Overall impression: Just what I've come to expect from Blue Moon - nothing stellar, but a drinkable offering that may just be your saving grace at a BMC bar."
"M/D: Nice mouthfeel, very subtle carbonation, nice on the tongue. Decent drinkability as well. Nothing special by any means but also a very easy drinking, easy to find beer that actually brings a little something to the table."
