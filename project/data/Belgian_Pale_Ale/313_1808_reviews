"Refreshing grass, sugar, spiced yeast, a bit funky. Hints of spice, especially clove. Sweet, refreshing, hay and yeast adding up well with the spices, hints of honey. Very well balanced, perfect fitting carbonation, which leads to a smooth, fresh mouthfeel. Clove is big in this, without being too present on the tastebuds. Results in a warm, yeast supported, pleasant finish."

"Not a bad beer by any means, but rather ordinary when compared to its namesakes."
"The beer has a nice blond color, which is a bit cloudy. In its aroma, it combines malt, yeast and some fruit accents. These are also reappear in the taste, where the fruit accent hints at the combination of banana and citrus. The most amazing is the balance you find in this beer. Definitely a benchmark for blond abbey/trappist style beers."

"Dark golden hued with good clarity.  A fingernail of light brown head covers most of the top.  I smell light malt with the faint hint of light candy sugar. The flavor is comprised of light candy sugar and delicate,light malt.  There's a light spice note in the malt that is reminiscent of cardamom and a touch of clove but it is brief.  The body is highly carbonated and bone dry."
""
""
"A standard for abbey blonds, with that special Sint-Sixtus yeast bringing a nice bit of complexity and some refreshing hop to help along."
"Why can't there be another Belgium blonde (less than 7%) this good? No USA version ever comes close. This has it all. It somehow toes the line of flavor, fullness, and lightness perfectly. Flavor, effervescence, aroma, even surprising hops. Absolute beauty."
""
"I think this is my favorite of the Westy's, very well put together and drinkable as all hell, nearing its BB date next year now I want to try a super fresh bottle more then anything"

"I just don't care for many blonde ales: This is better than many, but it's not great. The lack of malty depth let the esters play a little too much. The lacy head was pleasant (though, still spicier than I care for)."

"Got it in Brussels and let it lager for 3 months. It's golden but cloudy from yeast. The aroma is weaker than I expected, but everything else is wonderful.  It's a tad spicy, but wonderfully full-bodied.  It tastes like a Belgian pale ale with a slightly dry aftertaste."

"Fresh bottle poured at Kulminator in Antwerp. Pours hazy yellow with lots of yeasties floating around and a fluffy white head on top. Aroma of straw and hops, plenty of yeast and light fruits. Flavor is slightly dry, with apples and pears pairing with straw, a bit of sweetness balanced with hop bite, tripel funk, and some other yeast spice. Light bodied, medium plus carbonation. Really nice brew and glad I have some bottles to take home."

"Overall: A really nice Belgian pale ale, and if this were available on a shelf, I'd probably pick it up with semi regularity. However, since it's not, I wouldn't recommend going to any great lengths to obtain it."
""
"Verdict: A nice and enjoyable Belgian Pale Ale, simple and refreshing with a nice balance of flavors. I'm not convinced this is the freshest bottle, and this is not a style I believe fares well with age so I'd love to revisit this beer again when I can guarantee freshness. Still, I enjoyed this and would definitely enjoy it again."

"O- I've never been a huge fan of blonde ales, but this was awesome for the style and I wouldn't mind drinking these on a regular basis. Nice complexity, flavorful, and extremely drinkable. Definitely worth seeking it out. I'd recommend drinking this around room temperature as the bitterness fades and the flavors come out a bit more."

"Bottle shared with harrisoni in the Westvleteren Cafe. Wow, what a beer. So Ian built this one up for me as an amazing beer and to be honest I was sceptical about a Belgian blond. However it is a revelation and took some of the shine off my crates of Westy 12, as I suddenly wanted some of this to take home too. Gives me something to look forward to next time. Very bright amber and fresh looking beer. Up close there’s tiny specks of grain in the hazy beer. Bright head is medium to full, and fluffy and light. Nose is a big burst of fresh citrousy lemony hops, with citrous acidic, pithy lemon and satsuma, crisp yeast. Taste is a big burst of lemony hops, crisp Belgian yeast. It’s light, effervescent and leaves a tingling lemon citrous bitterness on the tongue well after sipping. Lovely finish. There’s also a little bit of lemon curd creaminess to it. Light as a feather and bursting with citrousy hop. This is a great beer and probably the best Belgian blonde beer I’ve had by a long way."

"super nice aroma. not glaringly rich and sweet like many of the BPAs I've had. nice head on top with sediment specks all throughout the head and glass. I guess it WAS a long ride, but I did give it a few days to settle. head simmers to just a fine layer. very nice and very beautiful on the pour. the sediment is very excusable considering its journey. mild hops in the taste. almost a pilsner kind of hoppiness to the taste, but otherwise pilsner-like. smooth and very refreshing, this is a wonderful brew. some green apple, some hay. reminiscent of a run through a field in Nebraska (I have never been anywhere near Nebraska- maybe it's all the movies?) my vocabulary isn't nearly as refined as some of these other reviewers, but this is very special. it's not overwhelmingly rich and sweet like some of the 'wannabe' American Belgians (or even some of the other Belgians) and they have just got this one simply right. the shipping was a bit extraordinary, but worth it considering I always wanted to try these brews. this would be the PERFECT lawnmower beer if it were available around the block!!! licking the yeasty sediment of the bottle it's very sweet! alright, I admit, I French licked the bottle. not to be gross but there is a huge amount of flavor on the inside of this bottle neck! mouthfeel is above medium in heaviness but feels really good and satisfies almost as if I had eaten a small meal. I may be starstruck due to the celebrity, but this gets very high ratings from me. if it were of the same difficulty in finding as Pliny, I would say this one would get my attention a little bit more. for awhile, at least...."

"a world class belgian blond, entirely yeast driven and absolutely delicious. had the pleasure of drinking the 12 and 8 in the same session, which is sort of a once in a lifetime experience. this is hazy pale blond in color with over an inch of just off white head and prickly carbonation. the nose is all yeast, just a little pale malt sweetness, but i get pollen and cut hay and ancient harvest vibes from the yeast. its got a touch of spice in the flavor, bitterness too, and is one of the most balanced light beers ive seen. the way the yeast has so completely fermented all the sugar in this is impressive, and the resulting dry snappy mouthfeel gives this beer unrivaled drinkability. full flavored for the color, i would love to get my hands on some of this yeast for my own brewing pursuits. top quality brew here, the americans still have a long way to go before we consistently make beer this good in this style."

"Is it possible that Westvleteren Blonde is overlooked? This is simply an outstanding blonde which is easy to drink, but doesn't receive the same kind of love as its siblings. If you're at In de Vrede, you want to start your engine with this."

"On first trip to Belgium in late 2010. A road trip from Bruges to the cafe next to the Monastery on a pilgrimage for the quadruple but lets start with the Blond first. Appearance is cloudy with a light foam. Looks like an unfiltered wheat. Aromas of wheat with an estery banana note. Taste is smooth with a nice balance of wheat and a hop end note. Mouthfeel is complex and rich for a low alcohol beer with a medium level of carbonation. Super drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: What a pleasure. A well-made brew for such a soft style. As others of said, drink this as fresh as you can get it. Overshadowed by it's bigger brothers, but a beer that should not be overlooked. Wish I could get more, for it would make a great table beer."

"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down either. Smell is of malt, honey, grape juice, and lots of fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with an earthy spice finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and some very nice flavors."
"Pours a light golden with a touch of haze; nice foamy white head, a good bit of lacing. Smell is some grass, a little mustiness, something like honey. The taste is funky up front, but mildly so; it's grassy and biscuity in the middle, with a nice sharp tang at the end. It's moderately carbonated, with a full body for a blonde beer. All in all very nice, a lot like Orval but a little brighter. I had three of these and now they're gone - wish I had another."
"Poured from a bottle at beer temple in Amsterdam to a chalice glass. Quarter inch of white lacing that dissipates in time. Golden color. Bits of carbonation hanging in the glass frothing hundred of stagnant bubbles. Slightly sweet honey smell. Other notes typical to Belgian blondes, floral. Taste is wheat slight honey, spicy finish. Moderate abv."

"O - One of the finest blonde ales I've had the enjoyment of trying."
"This is an enjoyable beer that's flavorful, refreshing and smooth without any taking away from the other."
"Overall very good. The focus on the yeast really improves what seems to me to otherwise be a straightforward (but high quality) Belgian pale."
""
"O: Very easy to drink and just an all-around great beer! Drink it fresh though as that is when it is most enjoyable."
""
"Has subtle, mild sweetness, and is very crackery. A little bit of light fruit and lemon rind is present, but more prevalent is the spicy character. Lots of earthy, grassy hops hit the palate, with some bitterness present. Finish is dry and a touch peppery. A solid albeit unspectacular Belgian Pale. Big time thnx, Thijs!! Prosit!!"

"Again, a very nice beer worth seeking out!"
""
"Poured from bottle at the cafe across the street from the Abbey on 9/8/12. Pours a hazy golden with a bit of white head. Really nice yeasty floral aromas, some citrus. Taste is smooth, citrusy, yeasty, and slight hop finish. Its very smooth and full bodied and feels bigger than 5.8% but a great belgian pale ale...dissapointingly not the best I ever had, but amazing nonetheless. Well worth a visit!"
""
""
"Brace yourselves... in my opinion, this is the best of the Westvletern line. Even though it says ""blond"" on the cap, to me this tastes like an excellent tripel. It has all the lemony, hammy, salty characteristics but at a lower ABV that doesn't leave much of a burn behind. Nice foggy-yellow color, and the light fizz is a bonus, too. Plus it has-- I say this in a good way-- the aroma of Murphy's oil soap. Admit it: *you*, too, inhale deeply when when you open the Murphy's bottle. Save the cap, attach a magnet to it and put it on the fridge as a memento."
""
"Who would have thought that Westvleteren could make an interesting beer? This is easily one of the most straight-up Belgian beers I have ever tasted. So much yeast! The pale malts can barely handle the yeast explosion. But it works. And I'm happy I could try this."
"Overall: This is single-handedly the most Belgian beer I've ever tasted. Unrelenting and intense. Even though I'm not a fan of the style, this really shows how you craft it. Crazy flavor but nice and drinkable."
"I reviewed it for what it is (as I always do), hench the high notes. I might still prefer a dark ale with a 4."

"This is simply classic Belgian blonde ale, executed perfectly. The smell is light and faintly hoppy and funky in the nose. The beer is slightly bitter, slightly sour, and slightly funky as well. There beer's not spicy, but there is a note of lemon or orange zest. There's also a distinct suggestion of sweetness in the brew, but no detectable residual sugar. Like a really awesome Leffe Blonde. Finishes perfectly dry and leaves a slight bitterness on the lips. Combined with moderate carbonation this is one of the most supremely drinkable beers I've ever tasted. Not the best, but quite likely the best in its genre."
""

"O: Great flavor profile and incredibly drinkable, could sit back and relax with this beer all night."
""
"A long time want. Happy to have five more."
""
"Had on tap at the Trappist. Pour is a bright golden orange with yellow edges. The head is creamy white leaving a thick lace. The nose has a subtle yeast, light spice, lots of lemon zest and light floral hop in the back. The taste has a faint spice, lots of yeast, lemon zest, and some juicy orange cirtrus with a light hop bitterness. Body is light and refreshing, a bit juicy and prickly carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer if you ever have the chance. Very enjoyable."
"Overall: A very different blonde ale with less sweet fruitiness than you often get. This one is complex, yet crisp and refreshing, and begs to be consumed in quantity."
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The balance and complexities and the dry yet frothiness of the mouthfeel were blended perfectly. This trappistry truly makes world-class beers."
"The glass arrives with a thick white head, a cloudy golden color. It has a delicately perfumed floral aroma with secondary aromas of spicy, earthy hops. It has a subtle floral taste, which is slightly soapy but not unpleasantly. It's slightly sweet and spicy. The body is light and it lingers nicely but not excessively. This beer was a pleasant surprise, quite delicious and very easy to drink."

"Overall an interesting Blonde with a unique aroma for the style. Quite musty yet hoppy and dry. Offers a nice subtle carbonation and effervescence without being too boisterous on the pour. A bit untraditional."

"4.0 D: This would have a shot at a perfect beer if it tasted more like it smelled. In any case, glad I got to try it."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Notes: I wish it weren't so hard to get in the US. Not the 12 but a really enjoyable drink. If I had to compare to another Trappist I would say it is closest to Orval. will try my second bottle in about 6 months..:)"
""
""
"At in de vrede. White fluffy head, medium retention.  Cloudy golden body.  Soapy sticky lacing. Some suspended particles. Fruity aroma, mainly old banana and a Belgian yeast. Tasted mainly of light banana, candi sugar, no alcohol noted. Smooth. Delicious. "

"Wish it was not so hard to get!!!"
"Not my favorite of the Trappiste but fortunately I have tried others from W. split one with my battle buddy in pint glasses. Loved the immense milky white head and the large amount of floating sediment and the golden color. The smell was okay but not really spectacular. I really didn't smell much from it a bit grassy and fruity but nothing overly compelling. Taste was somewhat sour and citrusy. Unfortunately we compared it to drinking orange juice in a milk glass. The bitterness was fine but something was not quite right. This was purchased from a specialty shop and could not find a best before date and that could be the problem. Not a bad experience but I was hoping for better fr this buxom blonde. Overall not my best Trappiste experience but might try againsithsome assurance of freshness as I see better opinions by others."
""
""
"O - A good and easy to drink blonde, but not my favorite though."
""
"A really outstanding Pale Ale."
"What an awesome gift. My friend said his uncle prefers champagne, because they get so much beer he is tired of it!"
"Overall: I could drink a lot of this. Well worth seeking out. Especially if you're going to go through the trouble of tracking down its older brothers."
"Beer is medium bodied throughout, with slightly high carbonation levels initially, over time fading to a fairly mild-feeling carbonation, leading to a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Finish has tannins and enough hop elements to be quite dry."
""
"Notes: Hmmm, maybe the least sought after of the Westvleteren brews but this is quite stellar. A bit Orvalesque in the initial memory, if this were not so scarce and pricey I´d love to have plenty handy."
""
""
""
""
"O - Crisp, clean, refreshing, and perfect with my dinner. A beer that is better than the desciption as there is nothing that jumps out at you but it all works so wonderfully together still."
"Overall: Very good, more drinkable than Duvel and the like due to low alcohol."
"Found this hiding in my beer cellar. Had totally forgotten that I had picked up some blonde during my last visit to the abbey. Clear, fizzy light yellow pour with a gorgeous meringue-like two finger head with excellent retention and lacing. Grassy, herbal, yeasty, sour nose with a distinct barnyard odor and just a touch of lemon. The taste is totally Belgian. Grassy, spicy hoppiness with a kiss of citrus, specifically lemon, and just a hint of yeasty bread. And absolutely no sweetness, and none of the sourness that was so present in the nose. Crisp, smooth and dry as a bone, but oh so refreshing. The balance is perfect. This is as close to the perfect Belgian blonde as it gets. I'm not big into Belgian pale ales, but this stands out from the pack. Perhaps my next beer run to the abbey will be for a couple of cases of blonde!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Dry upfront and grassy hoppy aftertaste. Well, not much more to say about a beer produced by one of the best brewers in the world"
""
""
""
""
"O. Very well crafte and delicate beer. This really is a classy beer. Nothing outrageous in terms of flavor, but crisp, clean and refreshing. This really gets my approval."
"O- An outstanding beer, definitely not what I was expecting from a Belgian pale ale, but it's very delicious. This is definitely the best beer I've run into in Belgium so far, but we'll see how long that lasts as I've got a bottle of the 8 sitting right next to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just about perfect. Where do they sell the kegs? This would be the ideal beer to have on tap in home. Get it done, DarthKostrizer!"
""
"Overall, this beer was worth every cent of the 25 bucks I paid for it. It doesn't taste like other pale ales, even the Belgian kind, and that's a compliment."
"Overall: With this beer being 2.5 years past it's best buy date it is still a really good beer which is a testament to how good a beer this really is fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another fine beer from the Abbey. I have tried the 8, 12, and now the Blonde. I definitely enjoy the 8 and the 12 significantly more than the Blonde but that is at least in part due to the fact that I enjoy Quads and Dubbel's more than I do Belgian Pale Ales in general. Still, I am glad that I got to try this one and definitely recommend it to those who enjoy the style."
""
"I wish I had brought back two or three more bottles so I could continue drinking this through the night and write an essay on it. I still have the 8 and 12 to try and my god, this thing has set the bar quite high...can't wait for those."
"Hazed sunflower gold with an ivory meringue white head that retains fairly well. On the nose there are pumpkin seeds, roses, carnations, coriander, and lemon, with an unexpected tropical undercurrent of pineapple, passion fruit, and papaya that's matched, kinda weirdly, with a musty cellar/fermenting dough character. The flavor is all fruit punch and mimosa, reeling with pineapple, orange, kiwi, and banana, with hints of apricot and mirabelle, and coriander, dandelion and yeast around the edges. I think I detect something fennel-ish as well, and some sweet cashew nuttiness. The texture is spot-on for the flavor, light and soft and cloud-like, but not insipid or thin. A very tasty and interesting pale ale, as you might expect from a brewery of such stature."

"Def. worth seeking out. I think I prefer this to the Quad."
"O: This is the ""anti-American"" Belgian PA for sure... and, to my mind and tastes, it's infinitely more drinkable than anything that American produces also."
"The taste of this was just really great. Even after my palate was quote unquote tainted by my 12, it was very smooth and crisp. Definitely a beer i would crave after a long day of work, very refreshing."
"O: My expectations were high, and still not high enough..."
"O - What more can one say? Never had a better beer. American Pale Ales are either too sweet or too abrasively hopped - or not interesting enough. Belgians are too boozy or also too sweet. I don't like sweet things, so the citrus provides a perfect refreshing replacement for sugariness. I love hops, but have never had a beer this light, refreshing, and balanced with enough hoppiness. Drinking this made my eyes water like when I read a great poem or see one of my favorite paintings in person. I doubt I'll ever have another blonde this good. Well worth every penny. Overhyped due to its rarity? Of course. Deserving of its fame? You bet."
"had the pleasure of traveling to the Westvletern brewery and had a glass of this at In Dre Verde, the monk's tiny restaurant and bar. This was by far the sexiest blonde i've ever seen in a glass. It was very cloudy and had a beautiful head and just from looking at it I could tell that it would be delicious. Not only was this beer rich and complex but it was smooth as hell too. It really flowed down my throat and i was pleasently surprised by the least known of the three offerings from this magical brewery. can't wait to try the bottle i brought home"
"Thanks to Denise for the surprise box from Belgium."
"What a treat! Very clean, crisp dry ale. Refreshing if nothing else. Unfortunately that was the last of the Westy Blondes, onto the 8's and 12's I guess."
"This beer isn't the best I've ever tried, but I have the 8 and 12 waiting so it's a great first taste of Westvleteren."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, yeasty dryness. In the taste, quite yeasty and refreshing, with a small dry hop in the end. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry hop in the aftertaste. Nice hops in a blonde, and nice body too."
"D- Great depth of character in nose and palate than expected. Smooth creaminess with a solid refreshing semi dry finish makes it very refreshing. Overall, a superb complexity. Age has definitely not harmed it, excellent cellaring no doubt aided this."
"A decent balanced beer, but it's nothing special. I've had better American interpretations of the style."
"O: perfect beer what is there to say."
"Overall this is one of the most interesting Belgian beers I have had so far. I am shocked what the 8 and 12 taste like and can't wait to experience them. The listed 5.8 abv seems small as the beer feels much bigger. This is one incredibly impressive piece of work."
"O: Not worth the 8 Euros I paid for it, but I'm glad I tried it. Curious about the other two."
"O- pretty epic for the style. Will see how it holds up with age"
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. This is a tricky one. It certainly is very easy to drink, but that could be more in part due to the surprisingly lack of boldness in the nose and flavor rather than an eagerness to quaff it on my end. Just a bit too bready for my liking and certainly doesn't resonate on the same level as the 12 and 8 by Westvleteren. Those beers are world class and unique, while I feel this beer is rather pedestrian, and even moreso considering the pedigree behind the name. I'm not slamming the beer's score just based on who brews it, but I can't help but feel it is in a separate realm compared to the 12 and 8. Maybe a fresher bottle would preserve some of those flavors better, but as it stands, I will stick to the other two Westvleteren beers."
"Tastes light, almost flavourless. The yeast is notable. Some light lemon and citrus flavours. Not the fruit but rather tastes like the peels. a bit rough and bitter. Carbonation level is high and I think that hurts the beer IMHO. Haven't had MANY Belgian pales but this is certainly one of the best I've had. I think its just a style I find hard to enjoy"
"The flavors are complex and separately distinct at first gulp, then begins the harmonious blending and mingling. Resinous Belgian hoppiness, citrus rind, caramel malt and spiced rum form as one and invite large gulps and noisy lip-smacking. The candi sugar sweetness is the unifying factor here. It’s central in all the outward flavors. By the time the initial effervescence wears down and the ale mellows, it’s gone! And you wish you had another!"
"Blondus Supremus. . . Keith, I'm indebted to you for picking me up this."
"Overall: I think I may have a bottle past its prime. These seemed so much better when I drank it at In De Vrede. I'll try another and update my review when I get a chance."
"This is an awesome Blonde ale. 3/3 of the non-retired Westvleteren beers: complete."
"Without a doubt, this is my absolute favorite summer beer, and my favorite representative of the Belgian Blond style. It couldn't be better better balanced, and with a low ABV and crisp carbonation, it stays tremendously refreshing. I could easily drink one after the other."
"A wonderful Belgian blond. One of the best Belgian pale ales I've ever had. While it doesn't have the complexity and depth of flavour of the other Westys, this would easily be my pick to drink regularly. Lovely."
"this is the best Pale ale I've ever had so drinkable so refreshing"
"Personally, I would put it in the same category as saissons, which I am not a huge lover of but I appreciate their crispness and drinkability. I would much rather have Westvleteren's other offerings over the Blonde and would go as far to say that other Belgian blondes offer more palate-wise than Westvleteren's did."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is easy drinking with the abv hidden exceptionally well. Much more hoppy than I anticipated, this is among the most hoppy belgian pales I have had. An interesting and enjoyable experience but I dont think it is worth the hassle of trying to secure this unless the opportunity is presented to you within reason."
" The flavor is malty with some light dry cracker-like tinges with some herbal almost bitter flavored with strong yeastiness and minty element from the hops which gives a nice contrast to the grassy and slight fruity yeast. The malt doesn't taste like the smell leads you to believe it will, just basically dry and the yeast adds a minor pear accent to the mild tannic tinge the hops create. The yeast and hop cohesion is very pleasant and the dry essence makes this a nice sipper, welcoming additional tastes. I enjoyed this a lot, but overall it was not what I expected. I found it to be saison-like in a good way and the very dry malt is what I was not expecting. This is not the best of what this brewery offers but it has a high drinkability quotient so do try it if you enjoy saisons or hoppy belgian pale ales."
"Overall: Great beer, when consumed fresh, it humiliates all others in the style!"
"What a beer! Everything is how it should be."
"jd"
"O: I really think this might be my favorite westy. Really simple, strait forwardly crafted beer with high quality and with hi drinkability. Now if only they increased their market..."
"O - While the not the overall best beer that I have ever had, this beer is near the top. Top in its style that I have had. It's just very smooth overall and very drinkable. I was very pleasantly surprised to note some dark fruits in this beer as I would with quadrupels. Just a testament to the genius of the monks of the St. Sixtus Abbey."
"Overall, this is a great beer. An excellent table beer for this time of year, I just wish I had more. A huge thanks to my best friend Ryan for sherpa-ing this beer back to the USA!"
"Overall, this is probably my least favorite of the three and I definitely enjoyed this one. To pack this much complexity into a blonde is incredible. My nose and mouth were all over the place trying to figure everything out."
"Bottle shared at the May Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a hazy straw color with a lacy white ring of foam. Aroma is phenolic and ashy with accents of pale malts and yeast. Kinda cigarettey in a way. Flavor is much better. Dry pale malts provide a nice background for the ludicrous hop bitterness. I've had less bitter IPAs. This is awesome. Perfect hoppiness for a Belgian golden ale. So so dry but quenching and fulfilling. Bitter, pale and delicious."
"The rating I gave it reflects my review of this beer fresh, not aged. I think it's meant to be consumed fresh, but I did enjoy it with 2 years of age on it."
"This is the underdog of Westvleteren beers in most peoples minds but I had all three side by side and this one impressed me most with its complexity, ease of drinkability and all-round deliciousness. I will be seeking this beer out over Westy 12 from now on."
"O: Pretty good overall"
"Fine beer."
"O - Such a stand out in its category. It seriously goes above and beyond any blonde I've ever tried."
"Overall:. Only downside was price. Worth it for the experience."
"Overall Drinkability - Great balance. Best blonde I've ever had. No offense, Emily."
"I maintain that high alcohol beers are comparatively easier to make than low alcohol beers. At 5.8, this is a very low alcohol Belgian beer, but it has a fantastic nose, great mouthfeel, and the closest thing to a perfect flavor that I have had from a textbook blonde. For the style, I think that this is the best of the Westvleteren beers. It was by far the highlight of the trip to Sint Sixtus."
"Good stuff. I quite like it. Comparable to an Orval, but not quite the complexity."
"D: Quite drinkable considering the low alcohol content, but I think this would be a bit dry to drink over and over. Not to mention it's not the easiest beer in the world to come by."
"Overall, I am into big beers, so this is really not my thing, but for what it is it is tremendous! Would never turn down a glass."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Each sip follows the last quite naturally and I’m more than happy to have more. I certainly would drink more of these if I were able and I could imagine being quite happy if this were the daily beer that went with my meals. My overall impression is of a first rate pale ale with just enough Belgian yeast character to differentiate it from other styles of pale ale."
"Pours a pale yellow with a one inch white fluffy head, looks very refreshing. Smell is full of belgian yeast, earthy, a little funky, and maybe a slight hop character. Taste is great: a light spice character, earthy yeast, a lemon fruitiness but without the sour, and finishes with a small hoppy bite. Mouthfeel is excellent for such a light beer. It is creamy, carbonation is perfect, and finishes crisp and clean. Overall this beer really impresses me for such a light beer. It is so well crafted it's ridiculous. If it was easy to find, I could easily go through a sixer in a session during the summer. Bravo St. Sixtus!"
"O - Overall I believe that this beer is the pioneer of the style. Not my favorite style, but the leader nonetheless. It is the perfect spring beer and I wish I had more than one to drink! Thanks again ccm414!"
"Cheers!"
"This is a delightful belgian blond ale that is very drinkable at 5.8%."
"M/D: This is a very light bodied, but crisp beer. The flavors on this were really surprising to me, especially the hops, but my bottle was pretty recent, so I assume that with some age it would balance out a little more, but I loved it. I wish I could get this more often."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a dense white head that lasted the entire glass. Aroma- lots of citrus, grapefruit, dust, pine, and slight funk. Intense hallertauer(?) hop aroma. Taste- Light to medium body with HUGE funk and citrusy fruits. Finish - beautiful hop bitterness, crisp, clean, dry and wonderful funk on the back of the tongue. A nearly flawless beer."
"Pours a hazy straw with a thin cream colored head. Nose has light fruity malts, spicy yeast and perhaps a bit of sourness. Taste definately a bit tart. This was an older bottle that doesn't seem to have aged very well."
"Poured a pale yellow, with a finger of head. Dense head with some sticky lace, filtered. Nose of light sugar candy, pale fruits and a touch of spice. Taste is of the pale malts, dry leafy hops, light spicing and a long dry (almost parching finish), leaving one longing for the next sip. Low carbonation, great body and mouthfeel. Drinks exceptionally, subtle and sophisticated."
"D: With the light body, tasty flavors, crispness, and low abv, this is a very drinkable beer. I only wish it were a bit easier to obtain because I would love to have a sixer of this to put back on a hot summer afternoon around the grill. Not a very complex beer, but delicious and very drinkable!"
"A very flavorful BPA, I could drinks these all day. Perhaps not as robust as their stronger counterparts but still packs a lot of flavor."
"Pours a pale blond, slightly hazy but quite clear really, small white head, traces of lace show up on the glass. Smells slightly spicy, mild yeast, detectable hop presence and some citrus. Tastes of pale malt, a touch of yeast, quite hoppy I found, solid bitterness and at some points faint traces of alcohol. Good mouthfeel, medium weight, understated carbonation. Very drinkable, could very well drink this all night. Good stuff and not at like what I thought it would be."
"The beer poured quite cloudy with a thick white head. It is straw-colored and hazy, with ample and tenacious lacing. The nose has aromas of lemon, hay, and the yeast. The flavor is very nicely balanced with good hop flavors up front and at the finish, and a doughy/ yeasty flavor with some malt character in the middle. The mouthfeel is creamy, with a lively carbonation pricking through. The finish is dry. A very drinkable beer, I had to force myself to slow down and savor it."
"Taste is right on target, it's a bit spicy and citrusy with some tart almost funky flavors to it, but they're fairly subtle, reminiscent of Orval. Mouthfeel is really light, crisp and super dry on the finish. Overall super well done, easy drinking beer. I'm glad I was finally able to try this fantastic beer!"
"D - I actually find this drinks slightly hard for a 5.8%, but tastes good enough that it warrants a higher than average drinkability. Great beer."
"I use to think this needed to be drunk quickly from my first experience but my impression after my second bottle is that it requires about a year standing before it gains its appetising maturity and composure. A gentle and humane beer."
"Thanks Brad! Really beautiful hazy apricot with a creamy meringue head. Aroma is yeasty, with an impression of orange and lemon pulp, and some really soft spices. Interesting yeast interplay is the first thought upon sipping. Kind of reminiscent of an aged De Dolle offering. The yeast is too heavy at times for my taste. Soft lemons creep around, but can't really shine through the yeast. There's a purity and freshness to this brew. Quite a bit of citrus fruit, like grapefruits, oranges, and lemons. This is interesting, definitely very good, with a really refreshing quality."
"Overall: I got the Blonde, 8, and 12 together and I wanted to drink them together, but I think aging this one 9 months was a real mistake. I'd love to have a fresh one because I don't think the one I'm having is A- quality."
"Clear yellow pour with a gigantic, foamy white head. Lemony, yeasty aroma with a slight hint of bread, pepper, grass and spice. Light, tart fruits and citrus make most of the body of the flavor with a slightly sweet, yeasty, peppery finish with just a hint of spice. Medium body, dry finish and lots of carbonation. I usually find the Blond styles to be a bit boring, but this has some nice layers of complexity to it."
"D- Would definitely have again in a heartbeat, but not really a session beer. Unlike any other Belgian blonde I've had, very unique."
"Pleased I've used the glass at last and the lesser of the Brothers beers gets a thumbs up from me, not huge scores, but I'm a low marker compared to most on BA."
"drinks well. would be better in the spring/summertime, but works ok on this cold blizzardy night."
"D: It doesn't feel heavy at all so you could certainly have several without a problem"
"5.8% ABV. I learned that the Westvleteren Blonde is the basic beer for the monks' own consumption, since 1999, when the former 6° dark ale (red cap) was finally discarded, after the 4° had already gone that path. I had the Westy Blonde (6) on self-proclaimed ""Westy day"" 01/06/11 with a craft beer aficionado first prior to tasting a Westy 8 and then a 12. This beer was bottled in 2008 (with date 19.10.11 stamped on cap). The beer poured a cloudy blonde and faint bubbly appearance. Retained nice carbonation throughout. This is an unique style - taste buds were immediately challenged initially turned from ""fire to ice"". Noticeably tastes better from cold to just above room temperature. Smell was wheaty and perhaps hints of banana for a blonde beer like this. Definitely hit the top of my palate. This beer left nice laces throughout and is a very drinkable beer. I would like to try this beer again in the summer if acquired again."
"O- One of a kind brew right here. It's really wonderful and just makes you want more and more. It's dryness just taunts your tongue. Must have. It's like cookies and I'm cookie monster."
"Medium bodied and surprisingly hop forward, especially since this bottle has been aged for about four years. I'm picking up the zesty, peppery spice that I noticed in the aroma as well the bready yeast and fruit notes, especially apple and pear. The bitterness from the hops is evident throughout but rather than overpowering the other flavors, they compliment them adding complexity and balance. There is slight alcohol sweetness and heat but this beer is still incredibly quaffable."
"WS"
"when I first tried this I immediately wanted a bigger drink. This is smooth and can be enjoyed all day long."
"D: Very high if only I could get more of it!"
"4's all the way across. Really solid."
"Worth a try. Very mellow and musty."
"Drinkability - Wow. I need a cigarette after wrestling a beer like this. This is as fine an example of this style as I've ever had. The complexity of tastes and smells it amazing. When I first sipped this beer there was literally a sensory overload as thousands of flavors flashed into my brain at the same time. If my life were a flavor profile, then my life definitely flashed before my eyes with this impressive beer."
"D: What a great beer. I'm so glad to have tried it. Highly recommended."
"d - Overall I thought this was a very good pale ale. While not usually my favorite style, I thought this beer smelt great and was very complex. I also felt like it was very easy to drink; I felt like I could definitely put a few of these down, and would actually want to. Taste was good but pretty standard, heavy on the spices. Would definitely have again and glad I got to try a bottle."
"Perfect balance. This is delicious and light feeling. It reminds me of a Mikkeller that was refined further."
"Pours a pale yellow colour with nice white head. Smell is quite fruity, but also has a grassy edge to it. Quite a complex smell that I really can't describe it. Flavour is really nice, small bitterness, but lots of sweetness and the Belgian flavours come through. Very dry finish. A really nice beer and I have no idea how they packed that much complexity under 6% abv."
"Pours a light, creamy blonde with a nice white head. Smell is quite complex with notes of light fruits, citrus peel, hops, and a bit of bready dough. Taste is quite similar, with some of the drier, white stone fruits taking over a little bit and fading into a nice, hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is quite light and well carbonated with a nice dry finish. Excellent drinkability. Can only dream of sitting in Belgium drinking a few of these."
"While this is a decent beer, it does not live up to the 8 or 12... I think I'd rather have a Taras Boulba.."
"Appears pale straw with a huge white foam head. It is the color of white grapes. Pale malts make up a majority of the aroma, but there is also some yeast notes. The taste begins malty sweet, but with a candi sugar sweetness finish, along with a does of spices. It is dry and champagne like. It is easy drinking, but the amount of spices may be a bit much. This beer gets less respect than the stronger offerings from this brewery, but it is still a solid beverage."
"D- Ya I'd take another. I wouldn't trade much to get this one, but it was definitely enjoyable. I could session this beer for criminy's sake."
"Multiple bottles, this one was a gusher. Pours with a large creamy white head and good lacing left by the collapsing head. Clear golden body speckled with small yeasties. Aroma of corn, corn nuts, astringent malt, alcohol, citrus zest, spices and pepper. Taste is astringent malt and spices, corn nuts, with a lot of barely. Fizzy and astringent mouthfeel. Not very impressed to be perfectly honest."
"Tried the Blond (5.8%)at their in de Vrede Cafe last week. Served from bottle to goblet. Hazy light yellow color. Frothy white head that leaves generous lacing down the glass. Yeasty earthy farmhouse aroma - very clean and inviting smelling. Clean dry bitter taste that leaves a light buttery coating in your mouth. Not complicated - but enjoyable."
"Good beer. Nothing like Westy 12, this is a good pale & solidly reps the style."
"Pours slighty cloudy and gold with two fingers of head which reduces to about a half and sticks around. The top smell is the hops with the yeast underneath. After that, I can smell some type of spice that I cannot describe but reminds me of clove. The mouthfeel is nice with slight carbonation and slight foam and very little trace of alcohol. The first taste is very similar and clean. The second is the same but I remember the hops and I'm very impressed. I wish I could better describe what I taste, but this beer is very easy to drink. I could drink this everyday."
"It was a hard birthday present to get but worth it."
"Notes: Really not what I was expecting, but pleasantly surprised. This is one of those beers that I knew absolutely nothing about before reviewing it so I wouldn't be tainted by others' opinions. Brett is awesome in blondes and so is this high level of hopping. Amazing."
"Reviewing my notes prompted me to check airlines prices...you know, just in case..."
"D: I think I might actually like this aged version better than the fresh ones that I have tried. A really big difference in terms of flavor, and a beer that you generally would not recommend cellaring for this long, but I think it worked very nicely."
"Drinkability : very good beer in the style Trappist, despite it's relative lightness."
"Overall a very good beer from a legendary brewery. I will admit BPA's are not my favorite but this one is a drinkable example."
"D - This would be a brilliant summemr beer if it wouldn't be for how damn hard it is to get. Perfectly drinkable!"
"D = This is a great Summer beer. It would be wonderful for breakfast with steamed mussels, too. Goes down easily and begs to be drank."
"D - Highly. No question about that. 4.5"
"If you can get a bottle this beer is worth it, it's both unique and incredible!"
"(D)- A great example of the style. Was a great summer refresher after a hot day out under the sun. A tad hoppier than expected, but by no means a complaint. Great stuff. I am glad I was finally able to try this!"
"Notes: Best before 06/08/10. Enjoyable beer that was light and refreshing. The taste was a touch too thin/light for my liking, but I think some of that may have been due to the age, which wasn't the freshest but it wasn't too old either (I would really like to try one of these really fresh). Overall a solid beer and very good example of the style. Wonderful smelling and very easy to drink, and refreshing. It gets overshadowed by the other two, but if you have a chance to get this one definitely give it a try."
"Bottle shared by Overlord, thanks! Hazed golden with a huge fluffy head with great retention and excellent lacing. In the nose I detect Bretty lemon, a little wet leather, and a light mineral presence with a distinct Belgian yeast character. Moderately Bretty citrus in the flavor, mostly wet leather, a little pepper, a touch of mineral. Creamy mouthfeel. A nice refreshing Belgian Pale Ale on a warm day"
"Just a delicious beer. The best Belgian pale I remember having. As I look through my reviews, it blows away my other Belgian Pale and Belgian Strong Pale scores."
"I am sure that I will be much happier in a week or 2 with the Westy 12 that is sitting in my basement."
"Overall, a great beer, and one well worth seeking out. My bottle may have been aged a bit longer than optimal, but the additional research to confirm/deny this...another Belgium visit...will have to wait for the time being."
"This is a great beer. The aromas and flavors are very complex, and it seems that I detect something different each time I take another sip. It is drinkable to boot, making me wish I lived next to Saint Sixtus Abbey. Alas, I do not."
"Poured a slightly hazy pale golden color, visibly effervescent, with a HUGE stiff white crown that decomposes in 3D, like and ice cream sundae, with sheets of Belgian lacing. A pretty nice show. The smell is bright earthy lemon grassy hop adorned nicely with a touch of spices. The carbonation brightens up the thin texture of the mouth feel. Highly drinkable and refreshing. The flavor is on the lighter side as well. Earthy and bright, but slightly understated. A real easy drinker. I'm really glad that i got the opportunity to consider this one...many thanks to ShadesOfGray"
"D- Goes down really smooth and easy. Nothing overbearing about it. Quite refreshing as well."
"D: Good, light, crisp. Would be a great summer brew.. But is just a little too mild for me, especially considering it's geological rarity."
"Taste is of clove, lemon, orange peel, hops, belgian yeast, and some biscuit notes. The beer is dry throughout, which adds to the complexity and drinkability in my opinion. Compared to other blondes I've had this is one of my favorite belgian session beers and also satisfies my hops craving."
"I tried and tried but my nose couldn't detect any smell. I would say it's a flat beer but very enjoyable to drink. I will save the rest for spring when the temperatures will rise"
"Pours cloudy, pale copper. Aroma is earthy, some bretty yeast, pineapple, grapefruit. Flavors of light lemon, canned peaches. Slight acidity and bitterness on a the dry and slightly clove-ish finish, with a bit of tanginess as well. A fine beer but don't let it take the place of a 12 or 8 if you can get any of them."
"Overrated, overpriced and nowhere close to Orval."
"D - It's the session beer of the Westvleteren monks - if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me. I'll always have fond memories of sipping this with Urbain, Bryna, and Dave Schuster at Cafe In De Vrede."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, soft yellow color with a thick and foamy white head on top. The aroma is a bit understated, but prominent notes of yeast and citrus are still easy to notice. The flavor is bright and cheerful, yet earthy. The lemony citrus is the first thing to hit the tongue, followed by a mild undercurrent of yeasty twang, and a finale of dry sweetness. The texture is the star more than anything, though, with an initial effervescent punch to the tip of the tongue that somehow seems to disappear into an unexpected smoothness as the liquid explored my mouth. It finishes dry and clean, but the result is light-and-airy rather than crisp-and-refreshing. Certainly not the most flavorful selection, but a terrific drinking experience."
"Given the demand of the 8 & 12, I would suggest you don't overlook this one. I really liked it and everyone thought this one was great. I will definitely pick this one up and not as an after-thought to the 12. It stands on its own."
"Pours a pale hazy gold color with a one finger head which leaves a nice looking lace. Smells of yeast, lemons, apples, hay, and cloves. The taste is mostly lemon, yeast, and grass. Mildly sweet, with a lot of carbonation. Very effervescent. A crisp beer which finishes dry. An absolute pleasure to drink."
"Toasted malts are obvious up front. Fruit is lighter than I expected...apple again, grapefruit maybe. Picking up a sweetness like honey. Of course the common Belgian yeasts...finally finishing on the slightly bitter side. Very well balanced and crisp."
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"This is a very nice beer. Interesting, quite tasty. A little more herbal/grass than I'd prefer. Very glad I had it. Probably not going to the measures necessary to have too many more. Still, absolutely worth having."
"I adore this beer. It was, for better or for worse, the only beer that the shop across from the abbey in Westvleteren had for retail the last time I was there. This is, in my opinion, a quintessential belgian pale ale. Yeasty funk, dry, bitterness and tartness, hoppy - but in proportion ,and oh-so-refreshing. I would drink this very frequently if I could get my hands on it this side of the pond. Not a common brew, but if you get a chance to sample this gem, I highly recommend you do so."
"D: I would love to have a keg of this for the summer. Just a really great beer all around. Thanks again mikesgroove."
"T: If you were to give me this beer in a blilnd taste test, I would swear it is part Belgian Blonde, part French Cider. The apple and clove flavors really come through strong and it tastes wonderful! This is a very unique and well crafted beer - I would expect nothing less of Westvleteren. I could drink this beer every day and not get tired of it - it's so tasty and drinkable."
"Aroma had a strong corn flake malt presence and contained some expected fruit notes of pear, honey-dew melon, lemon zest, star fruit, and honey and some surprisingly nice spicy hop character that smelled distinctly of white pepper and tobacco smoke. This smoke would come through in the finish of the flavor as well. The majority of the body tastes of fruity yeast - pear and apricot mostly and some sweet bready grain. Doughy feel from all the yeast sediment but the carbonation does add some levity. Certainly drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is surprsing good and this is very drinkable."
"Cloudy golden yellow. Thick white head. Malt aroma with lemon and white pepper. Lightly spiced (maybe coriander? maybe orange peel?) with sourness, and a slightly bitter finish. Nicely balanced and very complex. Start with this one before heading to the 12. A unique brew."
"D: A first class easygoing beer. Very flavorful considering the style and strength."
"Reminds me a lot of Duvel only less sweet, still super smooth, but just a bitter. Excellent brew!"
"Drinkability: but for the difficulty of acquiring this beer, it would be monstrously sessionable. I love it."
"D - This would be a great session beer."
"Although not as complex as I had expected, the mouthfeel was incredible. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had."
"Purchased this beer with a 10 and 12. Served from a bottle into a Delirium Tremens glass. Thick white head that dominates the beer. The beer is yellow and cloudy. The aroma is subtle but good. Smells like a blonde ale. Some alcohol, mostly malt no hop character. The taste is sour. Mouthfeel is full and good. The beer fills your mouth. It is incredible. The head falls away as you drink and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. My tour of trappist ales should result in me being able to rank them, right now this one is the in the lead. I wish this was more readily available in the US, or available at all. We'll see how the others hold up."
"Overall, yes this is a good beer. Yes, it's Westvleteren. But, I don't know if I would seek this out."
"MF&D - the feel is absolutely amazing: the head is thick and creamy like a nitro head; the body itself is a bit too thick, and the carbonation is almost crisp enough. the carbonation is ample, it just doesnt bite through hard enough for me. needless to say, i would gladly have another, or a whole sixer by myself."
"Very murky, pale yellow with a towering 3 finger head that camps out for a while in all of its fluffy goodness. Smell is clove, light tropical fruit, and a light graininess. Taste is dominated by spices but they aren't very bold on the palate...subtle and inviting. Unfortunately it is a tad watery, but still flavorful enough to make it interesting. Medium bodied with a stinging carbonation. This is a solid, session type beer but it is not worth the price tag that it takes to get it in America."
"Notes: Of course I looked forward to having this beer (I was able to purchase 12 and 8 online but this one was ""not available"" at the time of my purchase) at, or near the brewery but to actually try it was sublime. As I repeated my sips I thought to myself that God himself must have had a hand in the decisions that went into these beers as they are divine. I strongly believe that the Blonde is underrated."
"OVERALL: A good brew. Everything was very much to my tastes for a blond, except for the thinner and weaker palate. Unfortunately this one doesn't quite live up to the superior and outer-worldly Westvleteren 8, but one worth checking out in its own right. Though, with the hefty price tag this one accompanies, I don't think I'll be picking this one up again."
"Fairly unimpressive, overall. It started out great and full of promise, but failed to deliver."
"Drinkability - The drinkability of this beer is average to high but the mellow flavors and the availability make me seek other blonds to satiate my palates desires."
"Light-bodied, rather fizzy and somewhat watery feel for a Belgian of this apparent caliber. Short, crisp finish. The mouthfeel really is what turned me off of this beer."
"The monks know..."
"D: A great beer. Too bad this beer is nearly impossible to find or it would be a regular. It disappeared far too fast."
"After popping the cap on this we had kind of a gusher. Poured into a glass with a big whitehead, a golden orange color, and the familiar haze of yeast. This beer has a great complex nose, notes of fruit, spice , and yeast. After the nose I expected this to be a heavier beer in taste then it is. It was quite light and clean and crisp, it's the kind of beer I love to sit at the local pub and enjoy several pints of."
"Definitely the lightest and most refreshing of the three and not to be passed over."
"The taste was great. Butter smooth, the yeast plays a huge role in the flavor. Nice tight, dry finish. It's great. So easy to drink. It's an outstanding beer but sadly not worth the trouble to retrieve for most. I was lucky enough to get this beer with the Westy 8 and 12 and I'm very happy I was able to try it. A damn fine brew."
"33cl bottle with the signature ring around the neck, green cap. Thanks to Alen for the trade. I was told this bottle recently came from the source in Belgium so it is a fresh sample, for what it's worth. Beautiful golden hue, slightly yeasty after the second pour, large sticky white head lasting a while. Smell is all soft honey and milk with a nice bit of yeasty bread and a good bit of dry herbal hop bouquet in there. This is phenomenal. Wow, I really didn't expect this to be so hoppy. I assumed it would be more ""blonde"" as the name implies but I guess I didn't notice that it was categorized as a Belgian Pale. While it does share an excellent crispness and pale malt with something like a blonde German lager, it also has a great dry, bitter, spicy and herbal hop profile. Really great and unexpected. So subtly complex but what makes this beer great is that it's just so simple and tasty. Delicious. Smooth, substantial, and crisp on the palate. Utterly quenching and refreshing. I will have to go to Belgium one day and drink many of these. One is not hardly enough. To quote my lady: ""This beer is beyond awesome."""
"Never in a million years did I think that this beer would be this good. Try this on for size... Trappist Westvletern Blonde is a better Belgian pale ale than Trappist Westvleteren 12 is a quadrupel. Find a fresh (hoppy) bottle and prepare to enter beer heaven."
"This beer pours an opaque deep golden color with a small head. There lacing on the side of the glass is above average. It smells a bit sour, but there are spices and pear aromas as well. This is one of the best tasting blondes I've had, and my biggest regret is that I wasn't able to get a fresh bottle. The spices were notable in this beer in the taste, and the base taste in this beer seemed to be like a sour apple. Overall, this beer was mild, but it tasted great. The mouthfeel was near perfect, but maybe a bit undercarbonated. This was one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had, and I wish I had regular access to this."
"D= High. This is the best Belgian I have had to date. Really smooth and solid. Not too complex but just right. Also very hoppy."
"Overall, this is certainly more than a solid brew, but I have to say not one of the best Belgian Pales that I've had. I am still more than happy to have tried the ever elusive Westvleteren's take on the style. Really good stuff, but I wouldn't recommend anyone jumping over a cliff to obtain this."
"Drinkability : very good beer in the style Trappist, despite it's relative lightness."
"Man I could drink this all day. It is truely a wonderful light beer."
"The mouthfeel and body were light and refreshing. The carbonation was prickly and perfectly matched to the flavors. While there may not have been any wheat in the grain bill, there seemed to be a slight creaminess in the beer. The finish was very dry, making this beer incredibly drinkable and refreshing. This was a masterfully crafted hoppy blond ale."
"Mouthfeel was full and prickly. All of the element of this beer fit together well."
"M&D: very soothing on the carbonation, full of spongey-soft bubbles to caress the taste buds, the body is medium at most, against a superbly balanced flavour profile, this ale overall is simply a bliss. I don't think it would do this ale any justice to compare it with any other Belgian Pale Ales I've had, as this is truly unique; but in some apartments it does strike a chord more with the hoppier ones like De Ranke XX Bitter than with harshly-estery counterparts like Orval."
"D- This is a wonderful blonde ale that has a very soft character. Well put together and very drinkable. I would love to try this fresh and would definitely have it again. Now the search is on for Trappist Westvleteren 8. Too bad these are so expensive..."
"Expiry 18/12/08"
"D: Goes down wonderfully well. I could kick back with a couple of these... if only I lived near the abbey."
"33 cl bottle purchased from Cracked Kettle for about ten dollars, poured into my Westvleteren chalice, consumed 12/29/08, reviewed from notes, color is a golden yellow with some orange tint, one inch fluffy white head with great retention and lacing, aroma is lots of Belgian yeast, lemon and other citrus, grapefruit rind, bread, straw, and mild floral notes, taste is dry at first, chewy in the middle with lots of biscuit-like malts, sweet Belgian yeast and citrus make up the finish and balance things out, I was expecting a stronger flavor overall but it is a little light on the palate, mouthfeel is yeasty, slightly sweet, and dry at times, thinner body than you would think, taste did not linger long, could drink a lot of this as alcohol is hidden almost completely, light on the stomach, just missing something that makes it really stand out like the other beer this brewery makes, would drink again but expensive for what it is, worth trying"
"Overall, a very drinkable brew. Definitely sessionable. Good social beer."
"This highly enjoyable Belgian pale ale stands head and shoulders above most beers of its style. Having sampled a two-year-old bottle, I would suggest that it gains complexity from a short stay in the cellar (the aroma in particular was more powerful and complex)."
"Drinkability: Ultimate session beer, and an amazing beer. Great fermentation character. A great argument for becoming a monk!"
"I could drink a few of these in a night if they were easier to obtain."
"D - Very drinkable, and with great flavor and mouthfeel, it's a pleasure to drink. Nice time I'm in Belgium I'll seek this out and bring several more home."
"D- Drinkable! A trappist monks lawnmower beer."
"Huge thanks to isubsmith for hooking up his fellow Rochester BAs with this rare beer. The color is a clear shinny blonde. The head is a firm white cap of foam, that recedes slowly leaving wonderful lacing all over the glass. The aroma is yeast, leathery, breay, and barnyard funky. The taste is like the aroma, but more in depth. There is a nice mild sourness that reminds me a lot of Orval but with a more malty tone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture, and lively, fine carbonation. Overall, this is a great Belgian Pale Ale. I would love for this beer to be a regular in my drinking rotation."
"M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is near perfect level. Drinability is as good as it gets. Easy to go down, not so easy to get your hands on. A great beer, through and through."
"D - Pretty enjoyable and easy to drink. An interesting try but I don't think I'd try to get another bottle."
"Not bad for the style, but not very interesting to me either."
"D= Though not as well reviewed or thought of as the Westy 8 and 12 here on BA, I thought this was a great beer (albeit hard to get and thus way overpriced)."
"D- Very drinkable which is bad considering how hard it is to get."
"Not quite as good as I was hoping it would be but the stuff is pretty damn tasty and easy to drink. If it was available I would session it."
"Mouthfeel borders on the light/medium side, carbonation is fairly lively, and it finishes on the bitter side. Oh, and the foam did last the entire session..."
"A definite step-down from the 12, but definitely not a disappointment. I would highly recommend this beer."
"D- It is a nice blonde. Clean and crisp."
"Pours a pale yellow color, slightly hazy, with lots of soda-like bubbles of carbonation and a strong white head that gets a little sticky towards the end of the glass. Bitter hops with citrus esters and lots of bready yeast in the nose. Pale malt sweetness sweeps in and out quickly in the beginning of the quaff followed by tons of drying bitter hops and a strong yeast character. Alcohol is an after thought. Sweet but bitter after taste. Very well made beer, nothing to write home about like the 8 or 12 but incredible all the same. Shit yea i recommend it, unfortunately, good luck finding a bottle..."
"Overall, a good Belgian pale ale. A bit difficult to obtain, but worth a try if you get a chance."
"D : Easy to drink and no trace of the alcohol. It's a great beer but not sure if it's worth the amount of money it takes to have shipped over from Belgium. It's one that I would definitely seek out if I was in Belgium."
"Three fingers of rocky off white head crests the top of the glass and leaves a bit of scattered lace. Body is a murky straw gold in color. Nose is crisp and has a nice fresh wheat feel with a bit of a raw hop presence. A big creamy citrus hop feel enters the mouth with first sip. But instead of turning harshly bitter it is balanced by smooth wheat and slight malt. This reminds me greatly of a hopenwezen in a good way. Mouthfeel is slightly thick but nicely balanced. Super easy to drink."
"Thanks to RomanW70 for the opportunity to try this one. Poured a hazy gold with a white head that dissipated quickly; foam coalesced around the shoulders before completely disappearing. Smell is very subdued; picked up lemon and wheat (fairly grassy). Taste follows nose, but grainy quality is more pronounced and lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and tingly with a residual astringency. Excellent drinkability. Easy drinking and light"
"Drinkability: Good"
"My first Westy. Poured into a Westy chalice both brought back from Beligum by a good friend's Mother. Thanks!"
"After having a 3-year-old bottle, and a 25-year-old bottle a couple of years back, we don't recommend aging this beer at all. Everyone, please stop. It's obvious that much of the hop character has been muted, with oxidation taking over the beer and creating new and unwanted ﬂavors. Drink it fresh, with its clean bitterness and thirst-quenching bliss intact."
"*After having this quite a few times at different ages, it's pretty evident that it's best at its freshest when the hops are most evident."
"Very easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"...But hey, aren't all Trappists beers?"
"Pours a beautiful hazy golden straw with a two finger fluffy white head. Retention and lacing are very good. Smell is earthy with lots of spices and a strong citrus hop presence, mainly lemons. There is also a slightly sweet bready malt undertone to the aroma. Taste pops with the lemon up front which gives way to the sweet wheat flavor before finishing with a very crisp light finish. There is a spiciness that remains throughout. The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied and seriously crisp. Drinkability is great with this one and I could drink this all day and night on a hot summer day."
"Too too drinkable! Awesome!"
"Drinkability was quite good. The moderately low alcohol content and the crisp snappiness of this brew make it an ideal apertif."
"Drinkability is high as the beer has great flavor profile and low alcohol. Could sit by the pool and drink them all day."
"Thank, unholy2, for the opportunity to complete the Westvleteren trifecta"
"Screw American macros. I'll take this any day as MY lawnmower beer. Absolutely delicious. Just stunning."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability. Very crisp and clean. Very refreshing."
"Nothing bombastic about this brew, but it is quite solid, eminently quaffable and a beer that is quite enjoyable."
"This bottle is from Belgium Shop and seems to be ""young"". It is a great beer now and I only see it getting better."
"D: This is a great Belgian pale. Truly, it's one I would gladly drink all the time. It's balanced and delicious."
"Drinkability: Easy to quaff, the glass went by too quickly for me. If only I lived in West Flanders, I'd be stopping by every day."
"Thanks again Aaron"
"Notes - Excellent stuff. A beer I could drink frequently if not for the rarity and cost."
"D: Tasty and extremely drinkable. One down, two to go."
"Pours a straw yellow with a large white head that left some lacing. The smell is yeasty and doughy, with some sweet fruit and spice notes, maybe some hops. The taste is great, I cannot believe how much flavor they packed in this beer. It is different because the flavor is not super intense or overpowering, but has multiple layers. A bit of hops, some malt and yeasty characters and a bitter aftertaste that comes on slow. The mouthfeel is smooth with a medium/light body. This one is very drinkable and very tasty. If you have the rare opportunity to try one, I highly suggest it. Enjoy."
"Ya know, I think this Westvletern brewery has gotten the brewing thing all figured out. Thanks Pwoody, you're a world class trader!"
"Overall I'm impressed. This is one of the most complex beers I've had in about the six months I've been back in Germany. It is definitely worth making a trip to the Westvleteren monastery for."
"This was a very refreshing beer, one of the best of it's kind I've ever had. No sign ofalcohol present so it would be easy to drink more than a few, if only they were a bit easier to come by."
"This was my first bottle from 2 crates I recently picked up at the abbay. The beer poured a hazy golden color, straw like color. The pour produced a one inch thick head that later gave way to a thick, sticky ring on the edge of the glass. The aroma was pleasing to my nose with a balance of citrus and spice along with a good wheat character and yeast as well. The taste was a very nice mix of the sweet with a good dose of citrus but also a good backbone of hop bitterness. The beer produces a very solid wheat character that is refreshing but makes for a medium bodied beer."
"Light bodied, but still firm and smooth, lively carbonated, brings herbal and yeasty notes, a hoppy, dry finish. As an appetizer or a session beer, it is an amazing brew."
"I like this beer a lot, but more of a fan of darker Beglians. Still, I would seek this out if get the opportunity."
"this beer is lighter tasting that i expected. it's a very drinkable beer. would be awesome to have it just laying around to session."
"Very easy to drink, nice clean easy to drink balanced belgian pale."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow color with a decent head that quickly dissipated. The aroma is cereal, citrus, floral and spicy. Hops are noticeable. The smell is intense and complex. The taste is as complex as the aroma. Cereal and bitterness are accented with floral and citrus flavors. The bitterness hits intensely at onset, but fades to a nice lingering quickly. The mouthfeel is medium and seems quite appropriate for this beer. Overall, this is a very smooth but complex beer that lends itself to drinking."
"Not as ""spectacular"" as its big-brother (the 12), but great none-the-less."
"This's my second ever Westvleteren Blond... with an interesting difference. It's freshness date is 24 Nov 2007! I am 2 days away from it's so called expiration. :) But anyway, it's like I am just done with a whole load of academic crap and I was deciding what to drink for the night; posted something on BA to poll for opinions and in the end thought I would chill out with a light one.. away from all the big beers for today. :) On to the beer, This one smells citrusy, grassy, malty and yeasty; the yeasts took a stronger stand after the pour but before the pour, off the opening I had nice sweetness admist the malts and minimal yeast. The pour again yielded one of the best lookers though I am pretty sure this one is murkier than my previous Westy Blond (probably due to the age and dark sediments) but I just love the way the creamy head develops; very nice... It comes up nice and after the pour it continues to grow in a very nice way leaving a smooth looking creamy head that you almost feel like touching it to feel it. The entry was a refreshing scent of yeast mixed with malts and grassiness and as we move towads the finish the malts take over. There was a slight malt sweetness throughout which made it pretty pleasant. The finish was dry and slightly bitter leaving a nice bready nose and a very lasting after taste made up of malts and grapes. There was also some breadiness in the after taste as well. Interesting that after sitting around for a good 5+ minutes, the after taste feels like pears. :) Body is somewhere between medium to thin and the carbonation goes in strong and its smoothness is water like with a slight creamy touch; not fantastic on the smoothness as illustrated in my last tasting. Perhaps the carbonation was a little too high on this one though it is wierd as this one's older. Nonetheless, a great blond for someone like me who ain't really into blonds. This one ranks up there with Duvel if not going beyond the Duvel. I think I enjoyed it more the last time but I can't be too sure. Perhaps fresher is better for this one. :)"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability- Very very light, and very very clean. Probably the cleanest tasting beer I've ever had. If it was more widely available, this would be a great session beer on a hot summer day- though perhaps that would be frowned upon by the monks of Westvleteren."
"Overall, this beer is very refreshing and clean tasting. Some complexity, but it almost begs to be left alone and enjoyed without pomp or attention. Spendy for what it is, but worth a try when you are wanting a light-er beer and can get one."
"Cant say Im impressed but cmon I knew I was drinking a Belgian Pale Ale, I wasnt expecting to be blown away by this one. Its a very good beer in itself but dont know if its worth the price or hassle to obtain more."
"Many thanks to HardTarget for graciously sharing this rare example."
"a masterfully crafted beer for what it is and not overrated a bit. take any opportunity you can to get your hands on some, though i'm sure you would anyway."
"I've heard many people complain that this is an inferior beer to the other Westy offerings and because it costs the same its not worth you time. If I could afford the shipping cost on a regular basis, I'd buy this by the case for weekend kick starts. I haven't tried the others (yet) but I am greatly looking forward to it based upon the quality of this ""inferior"" offering."
"Decent mouthfeel. Clings fair, but no crispness. Carbonation could be better."
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow, thick white head, nice lacing on the glass, great retention, this stuff really sticks. Smell is nice, sweet and malty, honey, bread, floral, grassy hops, some spice, wheat, noble hoppy goodness. Taste is similar, nice malts, bread and biscuits, floral and grassy hops, wheat, bit of spice, sweet tea finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very refreshing. Nice example of a blond, very happy I could try this one. Thanks Jan!!"
"So is it overrated? Yeah, probably a little. But it's something different for the Belgian pale category (props!), it has a wonderful mouthfeel, and its so easy-drinking, it's hard to savor. I just want to drink it all."
"As most beer afficionados know... IF a beer glass is clean, there will be a foam ring layered for each drink you take from this glass or mug. If the mug is dirty, then it will not. As for the beer... I usually review wines, but for this special beer, I was utterly impressed from start to finsh. The ullage was great, and the brew poured with a distinctive thick head. Having not partaken of any ales or stronger brews in awhile, this jumped off my pallate like a springboard. The experience was one I will remember for some time. I ended up drinking three with a nice bratwurst. Worth the expense I paid having it shipped here from Belgium."
"D: Quite drinkable. It falls short of its brothers in many ways but it is a superior Witt and at or near the head of the class of Belgium Pale Ales. For the dollars invested Id rather play with the 8 or 12 but Id never kick this Blonde out of my cooler."
"drinkability is good. well balanced, light, and very refreshing. good stuff. thanks again jan!"
"Aroma surprised me a bit  on the musty sour side of an apple barrow, bits of citrus mingle about. Citrusy and sharp, itd be easy to sip down several, while seated in a countryside Belgium café. Just enough hops to balance er out, meekly pushing to the hoppy side."
"The taste is delicious. Highly drinkable, to bad I only have one, oh well I still have three of the 8's and 2 of the 12's to enjoy. Has hints of hops, spice, a long finish. You can really feel this brew at the back of the throat. Outstanding!"
"Cheers!"
"It has a pale straw colored cloudy body with a one inch white head initially that fell fairly quickly. It smells very yeasty and malty with some fruitiness that reminds me a bit of a hefe with some banana and maybe apple. The flavor is not at all what I would have expected, but it is indeed good. It was much hoppier than I would have expected with both hop bitterness and flavor. It had a bit of spiciness to it as well and then finished with a malty finish. I think I got some noble hop aroma in there but I could be wrong. It is fairly light bodied. It could have been the situation, but it seemed like the perfect summer drink."
"D- It is pretty good but aftertaste is pretty much not there. Don't think I would get this again but glad I tried it."
"Drinkability- Damn, this would be one hell of a session beer, wouldn't it? Don't see that happening anytime soon though. Great mild tasting beer, but with very nice flavors. Very drinkable."
"Believe the hype - the beers of Westvleteren are in a class of their own."
"33cl. bottle: Got this with the 12 & 8 that I bought from Belgian Shop. Hadnt read the reviews, so I wasnt sure what to expect. This beer pours a hazy golden color, with a small white head. Has quite a bit of hops in the nose and taste, but not over the top. Very well balanced. Dry finish. Certainly different from the 8 and 12, but still very good. How can I join the Abbey?"
"The taste had a bitterness to it that I wasn't anticipating. I didn't find it offensive, I simply wasn't expecting it based on how sweet the smell was. The honey in the smell had me thinking, (and hoping) this would be sweeter than it was. Taste was sweet for a split second, and then turned quickly to bitter hops, then turned pleasantly dry on the finish. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth and very easy to drink. Good? Certainly. Live up to the Westy hype? Not this one. Perhaps Yellow cap, but to date I have not had it."
"Overall, a very nice example of a Belgian Pale  yeasty, hoppy, and flavorful. Its difficult not to rave about this brewery."
"A great summer/session beer. Fairly complex flavor profile for that type of beer. Incredibly easy to drink."
"I wasn't too impressed by this Trappist Ale. Worth a try, but doesn't live up to the name expectations..."
"The baby of the Westvleteren family. That said, full of flavour, lots of fruity dry yeasty character"
"I wish I had more."
"D: This was good but fairly standard. Over rated for sure."
"Iverall this was a great beer, hugely enjoyable, but the price really cuts the drinkabilty down for me. Awesome nonetheless and glad to have had some, off to the rest of the westy!"
"That said, the Blonde is a lovely brew, nice white head and golden body, lacing down the glass, an aroma of orange and lemon zest and spices and beauty. The taste, while on the subdued side, is much better than I've been lead to believe. Wheat grass hops and a lovely zesty lemon orange citrus give it a wit-like feel to it, very nice, very smooth, slightly zesty carbonation even still, this is easily the most drinkable beer I've had in at least month... I lose track quickly."
" Taste lets me down slightly, but only slightly. Spicy, herbal, and slightly floral are the hops. The malt seems a little restrained, but it combines with the yeast to create a fruitiness that complements the rest of the beer. Mouthfeel is perfect. Full, creamy, and lively from the smooth carbonation. I would drink this all day,everyday, if I could."
"My 700th review on BA."
"Poured from the bottle to my snifter a cloudy light orange color with a white fluffy head that leaves some nice lace around the glass. Some faint smell of spice and malt in the aroma. Taste is mostly pale flavors of spice, malt, and yeast. that leaves a somewhat sticky after taste. This is a light bodied and well carbonated brew with subtle flavors that make it easy to drink but a little to pale for my taste."
"Green cap with the best before date of 11.08.07 printed on the cap. Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a slightly hazy orangish yellow color with a large creamy white sticky head. Beautiful aroma consisting of a sweet grassy perfume-like aroma, faint citrus and must, and a bit of spice. The taste features a nice slightly spicy hop profile that finishes extremely dry and crisp. Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth but seems to be under-carbonated. Overall, this is another stellar brew from Westvleteren and one that I could certainly drink all night long if it wasn't for it's rareness."
"Worth the trip from Frankfurt AM to get this brew. Will go again in March to see if I can get any more from these great monks!"
"A very nice and easy to drink beer. Having this beer so fresh is quite an experience and enhances all aspects."
"I nearly messed myself when I opened this present, but so far this one didn't knock my socks off. A very, very good Belgian Pale Ale, but I'm not sure this one is worth going to the ends of the Earth for."
"Carbonation tickles the tongue, leading to a nice chewy mouthfeel. Flavors are somewhat muted with only a bitter euro-pilsner flavor and the presence of fresh cut grass. A faint hint of malt sweetness creeps in towards the end, but it is overwhelmed by the spicyness of the hops. This is not at all what I was expecting, and I'm a little disappointed. Not a bad beer, but not worth the price."
"Light bodied, very well carbonated without being stingy. Not watery or thin. Highly drinkable, easy to session and enjoy. The only draw back is the rarity and the price."
"25 bucks a bottle though is a bit high. I have tried it!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is light bodied but not thin in the least. The beer is well carbonated. This beer is very smooth. Frankly, this beer would be very hard to improve. This would rank among my all time greatest session beers except for the rarity."
"Notes: I was blown away with the taste and mouthfeel. Started off on the wrong foot with the decent appearance and then a uneventful smell. Then it gives you this burst of hops and tons of flavor. Fairly dry overall. My take is that this is a world class beer and one of the best I've had in the style to date."
"SLightly hazy pale yellow/straw liquid sits underneath a bed of frothy white foam. Lemony/citrus aromas give way to subtle spices, mixed with grassy/hay nuances. Very soft and pleasant. Very fruity lemon zest and other citrus flavours. Herbal, with mild bitter hopping, and a touch of mint leaf/fresh grass. Good, and again subtle. Very refreshing lemon/mineral finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Thanks for sharing this rare treat Mr. Horsey!"
"Drinkability - If I lived near Westvleteren, this would be an ideal session beer. I love it."
"Unbelievable drinkability. This beer actually quenches thirst. If this was readily available I would have no use for drinking water anymore. Absolute favorite of this style."
"D: Very good."
"This little lowest-rated Westy ale turned out to be my favorite of the lot; 11.08.07 on the cap. Simple delicious beer. Poured a golden straw color, lightly hazy, not much of a head to speak of, but the carbonation's as light as a feather and provides a gentle spice, like mild champagne bubbles. Light, bready body and a mild hop bite, which falls off to a gently sweet, grainy aftertaste. Fresh mountain spring water is evident everywhere in this ale. Meticulously crafted, with perfect balance and brilliant restraint. Eminently drinkable and refreshing. This may be the ultimate Belgian session beer. The best example I've had of the style yet. Cheers!"
"Pours a light honey and straw gold in color, hazy, with a decent sized white head that recedes slowly. A floral and sugary sweetness in the nose mix with clove like spice and bananas. Sweet sugariness, white grape juice and a light honey flavor are apparent in the taste. Very creamy and smooth medium body with a light pepperiness that enters mid-taste and lingers thru the aftertaste. A decent sized grassy bitterness is drying in the finish. Easy to drink, alcohol is hidden nicely, very nice mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - one of the most suprising Trappists I've drunk to date, not least because this is a beer that you could drink more than one bottle of without being wasteful. Of course you've got to find another bottle first, and when you do be prepared to spend $27.50 to buy it (this is, after all Sweden). But you get the general idea..."
"A fine sessionable beer. Worth the sweat carrying back from the Abbey."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and I would certainly partake quite a bit in it if it were readily available in the area...or in the US for that matter. Thumbs up!"
"D: This is much drier than I was expecting, and that was a really pleasant surprise. I was almost expecting to be blown away by this beer; I wasn't, but that's not the beer's fault. It's still a very good beer, and I'm glad to have tried it, but it's not so awesomely awesome that I'll be looking to go all Mission:Impossible again to track another bottle down on the cheap. Drier and less fruity than many of the more widely available blondes, and that was a nice change of pace."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with an off-white head that is ample ... leaving gorgeous lacing patterns in the oversized wine glass. A worderful picture. Nose is of sweet malts, confectioner's sugar, Belgian yeast, and spices - clove and black pepper. I could smell this alone and be happy. Palate is complex and encompassing, with sweet malt and some terrific citrus notes. A perfect hop balance keeps this beer from being cloying in a masterful way. Relatively dry finish and the taste gains complexity as it warms. Spiciness lingers on long after you swallow. This beer has an absolutely incredible mouthfeel that is thick, but not heavy. Substantial but not overwhelming in any way. A sublime blonde from the Brothers at Westvleteren. I could drink this one at any time ... if only I had more than two bottles. Terrific."
"The taste is also very grainy and also has a bit of a corn syrup flavor. I suspect it is much better fresher, but it was still good enough. I preferred the 3 year old version of Rochefort 6 to this 2 year old Westy, though as I mentioned it is not a direct comparison."
"Pours a hazy blonde with a myriad of microscopic bubbles clinging to the sides of the chalice & eventually working their way up to join the dense, rocky head that sits atop. Smells of apricot and peaches with a hint of banana. Even too cold (which this is because I'm too impatient to wait it to warm from fridge temp), the aroma is warm and inviting. The head settles down to a thin, though still persistent, lace which clings to the sides of the glass. The taste...fruit followed by an earthy undertone from the yeast, with a hint of a metallic aftertaste that is just enough to counterbalance the initial sweetness. Suprisingly dry finish given the fruit upfront. Mouthfeel is silky and just a whisper too thin if I'm splitting hairs. Drinkability is only limited by the rareness of this gem. I've had their other two current offerings and would rate this the lowest of the three but that's like trying to select a date from Selma Hayak her other two triplet sisters. If you can try this beer, do so."
"Finishes with a husky graininess, some drying bitterness and stale vanilla."
"Delightfully crisp and wonderfully drinkable, but hardly the kind of show stealer that are its older siblings."
"Smell is unique. Grassy and hoppy. It actually smells similar to marijuana. Quite nice. Taste is sweet but balanced. Is that apple or pear that I taste? Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. Wow. Tiny, tiny bubbles. How do they do that? Drinkability is awesome. So inviting."
"An interesting offering from the Trappist Monks at Westvleteren. Into a chalice; pours a golden yellow color with high carbonation yeilding a large pillow of white foam. Bubbles stream upwards from the bottom of the glass. Aromas of grassy spices and the trademark yeasty and malty note that only Trappist brews have. Nice. Taste is quite complex; dry notes of malts and wheat blend with a grassy hay note, followed by light apple flavors and a pinch of spice. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and accenuates the the nuances and qualities of this brew. Very crisp on the tongue, and goes down like satin. Drinkability is good. Special thanks goes out to Boolshot for providing the sample."
"Drinkability: Outstanding. This beer is the greatest invention since wood."
"Drinkability is high , very refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, with a very subdued sugar taste in the swallow."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... Highly recommended... Not quite as good as the 8 or the 12 but still pretty damn good..."
"It's very good, and would be a regular quaff in this household if it weren't so damn scarce. Even though I wish the flavor measured up with the more buoyant and refreshing aroma, it's hard to dislike anything about this."
"Drinkability: Probably one of the most drinkable beers that I've had. It's refreshing and crisp with flavors that don't overpower."
"Not what I expected or wanted in a Belgian pale ale. Ill still keep my eyes out for the Westy 8 and 12, but I would skip this one in the future."
"I think this would be a good session beer if it was easier to find. Since it's not, I don't mind drinking any number of pale ales in its place."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Goes down really smooth and refreshing. A delight on a nice sunny day like today. Truly a tasty blonde ale and one that I would imbibe much more often given the chance. One day I will get to Belgium and sample this at the source, that much is for certain. Ev, thanks again for giving me the chance to try this one!"
"I liked the hefe I brewed better... same banana/yeasty aroma and flavor without the concerning numbing characteristic."
"Drinkability: Drinkable enough. It's not my first choice when I reach for a Trappist, but it is not a bad ale overall."
"aftertaste typical westvleteren, if i didnt' know better might think it was the darker beers."
"Many thanks to blitheringidiot for hooking me up with this fine and hard-to-find brew."
"Pours a hazy straw color and makes a dense white head, head retention is very good, lacing is quite nice. Aroma is rather faint, there is a bit of caramel and alot of yeasty esters. Really nice nutty caramel flavor, slightly sweet honey, light spices and light fruit, hint of bittering in the finish. Mouthfeel is superb, very rich and creamy, gently coating the palate and then closes with a clean, dry finish. There's nothing overrated about a Westy, even the little Blonde with quite a bit of aging, very enjoyable. Oh, if I could only session this!"
"This beer pours a cloudy, yeast filled dirty blonde. It leaves a thick white head that drips down the side of the glass. The aroma of this beer is sweet, lime, honey, plum, fruit cake. As I taste this beer the flavors previously mentioned come out. The lemon rind, honey, bitterness, all are enhanced by the crisp carbonation of this brew. This belgian is delicious one that satisfies with complex flavors and crisp taste."
"Tasted at the In De Vrede cafe over the road from the brewery. Presented in a Westvleteren challis, hazy straw yellow with plenty of bright white compact head perfectly filling the challis. Aroma is of honey and feint cloves, with the very slightest hint of flowery hops - subtle and nicely balanced. Taste is so well balanced it is hard to pick out individual flavours, maybe some orange peel over the malt background, with a little light clove spiciness. Finish is nicely balanced with crisp refreshing bitterness from the hops, but beyond that there is no hops flavour dominance noticeable. Mouth was light and fluffy, but not watery. Complemented the flavours nicely. Very drinkable on a hot day (which it was when I visited). A pity I was limited to only one as I had to drive back to Paris. Looking forward to trying the 8 and 12's I have brought home."
"Tastes dry, light sweet maltyness. There's a crackery type aftertaste at the end, slightly toasty. Mouthfeel is smooth and not watery, but extremely dry at the end- like, I want to reach for water type dry. Fairly drinkable, but the dryness thing is just... I don't know, maybe one has to be in the mood for it. A good brew."
"I haven't had too many belgian pale ales and it strikes me that this is as it's meant to me... so this may be better as per style than I'm giving it credit for but there is something a bit lacking for me."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, formed a 3/4"" bright white head over the translucent golden brew. The head stays as is, and lacing is sticky and prevalent. Aroma is sweet pale maltiness with a tinge of spicing and a touch of some citrus. Taste starts with some light malt sweetness, touches on the spices and citrus again, and closes with a combination of these flavors lingering on the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is great. Least favorite of the three, but the bar had been set pretty high by the other two."
"Well I have worked my way ""down"" the Westy ladder and enjoyed the trip! While not as good as the 8 or 12, you can still tell that this beer is crafted with skill and care. Hazy golden yellow with a super thick white head that lasts a long time. Thick sheets of lacing. Aroma of citrus and floral hops. Medium-bodied and dry with spicy hops and citrus flavoring. Wonderful balance throughout. The finish is lightly bitter with yeast and spice flavors. Id love to have any of the Westy brews again but considering the hefty price tag Ill probably stick with the 12 from here on out."
"D - This is a great beer, goes with food, or on its own. GREAT!"
"The smell is very nice, bringing a nice combination of herbs and hops on top of a light malt base. The taste is crisp, and the hops definitely stick out. The mouthfeel is fairly full for the style, while drinkability is very good."
"No label, just the famous green cap. Pours a hazy yellow like any blonde with little head. Smells strongly of hops. The initial taste on the tongue is definitely very hoppy, almost like an american Pale Ale. It lingers for a long time. The more and more sips you have it begins to loose its hop and starts to evolve into more of a traditional blonde flavor."
"Five and a half years later, second bottle aged for the same amount of time, either 2003 and 2004. Beautiful blond, creamy, delicate.A little yeast in sediment."
"Medium bodied."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. I could drink this all night. Too bad I only have one bottle left."
"A very nice beer to enjoy on a rainy day. The beer is not big in any aspect but makes up for any lacking in its mixture of elements. The spicy taste and the subtle phenolics are my favorites."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Poured out a cloudy lemon yellow with a ton of yeasty chunks floating throughout. Very thick and creamy white head that was only a thin, but nice and consistant layer. Wonderful scents of saisons, belgian yeast, bananas, chardonnay, and spices. Dry and slightly bitter at the edges. Black unsweetened tea. The flavors get better with each sip. Good amount of carbination, but yet it is not too much. Bit of foaming up over your tongue, but nothing too extreme. The feel is just right for the style. Light feeling, it just flows through your mouth. Very easy drinker, but not one I would pick for a regular drinker -if it was one that was just normally sitting around here and there that is."
"Notes: I had been wanting to try the Westvleteren 12, 8, and Blonde for a long time. I had all three on the same day and the Blonde is by far my favorite of the 3 despite the hype around the Westvleteren 12."
"33 cl bottle. Still has price tag on back of $8.99. Code on top of cap says 17.10.03. A nice Belgian Pale Ale. Not worth the coin it took to purchase however, but very nice to drink. Better BPA can be found for much less money."
"A superb little beer, absolutely delightful!"
"Bottle at the Moan and Dove. Nice pour. Its a mysterious cloudy golden, obviously bottle-conditioned. The nice lasting 1cm cover of moon white head makes the westmalle chalice looks particularly attractive. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy, Im first striked by a wave of floral goodness complemented by grassy undertones. Definite champaign qualities despite the big malty sweet components. Candi sugar is not used with moderation for a 6% ale, malt is honeyish, pilsner malt? and imparts coconut and bready aromas. Very yeasty palate all around, dry all the way. Spicy (pepper, mint, sage). Delicately flowery. Balancing mild tartness, mostly on the citric lemon side, salty finished with very restrained bitterness. Youre welcomed in my glass anywhen my dear. A good dose of various herbs is always a pleasure to taste as long as its more of a complement than the unique focus. No alcohol is noticeable in there. Thats their session beer? It just made a monk out of me."
"Taste: A slow malt start, but with a nice dry finish and mild hop bite to it. Mouthfeel was obviously less present than the 12, but I thought it held up really well and I regret not bringing some back with me from my trip."
"IMHO: Not well balanced ? not what I expected."
"Lovely, but this replaced the red cap? Why?"
"Superbly well-put-together."
"I wouldn't say this is a spectacular beer, but it is certainly in the upper tier of the style. Worth a try if you get the chance."
"Bottle: Poured a beautiful lightly hazy blonde with a huge bubbly head with perfect retention. Aroma is floral with some light spices in the undertone. Taste is very refreshing with the malts coming out first followed by some hard to distinguish spices followed by a sweet ending. Body is medium with great carbonation and alcohol is not detectable. Wow! This is one great light Belgian ale. Too bad I cannot get my hand on this stuff more regularly."
"Sharp hop nose with some earthy and grassy overtones. Golden champagne look in the goblet with lots of tiny bubbles and a very dense and lasting snow white head. Great lacing as well. Peachy juicyfruit taste upfront on the tip of the tongue initially. Then the brew morphs into a rustic earthy slightly barnyard grass finish. Medium to light on the mouth. Very attractive beer, with great complexity in its taste."
"12.11.04 on the cap. Lots of yeasts sediments in the bottle, a big chunk and smaller sediments. Light and slightly creamy head on an impressive complex golden color. Nice movement of bubbles in the middle of the glass. Some lemon in the smell. A very clean and yeasty smell. Less fruitiness than I expected in the taste. A malty complexity, with enjoyable nuances of tart. Very smooth. The powerful hops at the end leave a long-lasting and thick mouthfeel. A really good beer. Complex. I wish Id be able to detect more elements to describe it. Maybe next time"
"The taste, an enhanced malt and rustic feel that is literally overwhelmed by this wave of hops at the end. strong, tasteful, definetly a great beer."
"Taste: I poured this beer at about 40 degrees so some of the initial flavor was lost due to temperature and alcohol covering some up. However, I did get a taste of fruitful <a href=""http://0-days.net?go=flowers"" onmouseover=""window.status = 'goto: flowers';return 1"" onmouseout=""window.status=''"">flowers</a> blossoming on a spring day and a hint o pepper. As I let it warm to room temp. the flavors of the fruit and pepper came out so much more! My beer had a head on it the entire 45 minutes it took me to finish this 11.2 oz. bottle. Highly recommend this one if you can get your hands on it!!!!"
"Spicy aftertaste."
"Drinkability: i loved this beer. much diffeetn then the other 2 Westys. this was the only blond i sampled but i just loved it."
"Overall: The Westvleteren DNA is definitely present in the latest offering from the St.Sixtus Abbey. A replacement for the often raw Special 6 (Red Cap), this is a much better beer in my opinion and adds a genuine low(er) gravity quaffer to the Westie fleet. This is a very good, high quality; extremely drinkable beer that is the base offering from the St.Sixtus Abdij. Its true to say that it is not up there with the 12, or even the 8, but it is really not that far behind either."
"Overall Impression: If I'm not mistaken, the water down in Westvleteren is quite high in carbonate hardness (similar to Orval's water). Could be the reason for the minerally mouthfeel and accentuated hop bitterness. This is my first taste of Westvleteren and I have to say I'm not blown away. I'm going to withhold judgement until I've tried the whole line. After all, who can ignore the constant raves about 12?"
"Light gold color. Medium head. Aroma is floral, honey, lemon and yeast. WOW this is the BEST smelling beer I think I've had to date. Floral and refreshing. Very clean taste. Fruity, lemons, floral, candy sugar and yeasts. Very nice beer. It took me several minutes before I tasted this beer, because it smelled so good. Very clean. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a thin but persistent head that leaves behind patches of lace. Aroma is yeasty and musty with some herbal notes. Flavor begins slightly sweet, with a nice herbal bitterness and some musty yeast at the finish. Has a light body and low to medium carbonation. This is quite a good beer... it's too bad this one is so hard to obtain!"
"Peppery notes and a dry bitterness fill the palate. The beer becomes a bit more juicy mid-glass. Finishes clean and peppery. A well rounded Belgian pale, but is it worth the price? I really don't think so, but I can't wait to sample the rest of their lineup."
"Small brown Euro bottle without the label. Golden bronze color, explosive thick, tightly bubbled foamy off-white head. Great appearance. Lacing sticks to the glass, and your tongue equally. Very full peppery aromas of fresh cut hops, citrus and toasted grains. Taste is crisp, super spicy, and matched up with a very pleasing toasted graininess. Bitter hops yeilds to a peppery almost hot cleansing finish. Full of fresh flavors, and medium bodied. Super refreshing and very drinkable. Cheers to the BelgianBum that dropped this on me way back last winter."
"Very good."
"Originally sampled on 26 November 2002. The only thing wrong with this beer is that Westvleteren's other two beers are world beaters, this one is merely exceptionally good. It's cloudy yellow w/ a huge white head. It has a spicy flavor,clean finish. Next time, I'd have this one on a hot day"
"Great appearance. Bright gold with a huge rocky head that is not out of control. Interesting sweet cherry aroma. Flavor is dry malt (hay, sand), cloves and a surprisingly bitter finish. The dryness was surprising and could almost pass for an experimental pilsner with some of the fruity, spicy flavors going on."
"Thanks for sharing Senior."
"After a string of high-alcohol Belgian offerings, this lower-horsepower ale was a treat, and something of a relief. Soft aroma of candy sugar and bready yeast. Flavor was a bit more malty than other Belgian blondes, but nicely balanced with reserved bright yeasty fruit notes. This one does not try to go over the top, and focuses instead on being a quality mild ale. Thanks to BelgianBum for the sample."
"This beer I almost missed, since the only difference is the cap. It poured a very foamy, bubbly light gold color and formed a foamy head that left a fairly thick coating of lace. A good deal of carbonation and sediment was present(but due to the foam, I probably poured too much of it from the bottom). An aroma of hops and grain with a slight hint of clove. A flavor of hops, grain and a bit peppery. The finish also hint at the pepper. A good beer."
"Drinkability & Notes: This one is off the charts as far as a session brew for me, I simply could drink this all night. By far one of the best beers I have run into and would travel (and have) far for."
"F"
"Notes & Drinkability: Definiately one of my favourite Belgian beers. I simply can't get enough of this dry and bitter beer, which is not too typical of Belgian beers."
"The beer pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow, the head adequate in size, bubbly in its consistency, the lace in thin sheets that cling mightily to the glass. Malt dominates the nose, hints of citrus, somewhat sour undertones also present. Start is nicely malted, and slightly sweet with the top lanky. Finish has a penetrating acidity, the hops delectable and pleasing in their spiciness, very dry and somewhat tart aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, clean and spritzy comes to mind when I describe this beer, good but the least favorite in this line of beers."
"Pours with a fluffy white head and the body is just slightly hazy and golden with small bubbles rising up through the Westvleteren goblet. Herbal hop aromas mix in with pear like fruitiness. Slightly sweet at first then becomes drier when the earthy / herbal hop flavors come into play. Finishes dry but not overly drying. Could have used a little thicker mouthfeel for a more refined drink, but this is not the prurpose of this beer. Its a delicate, drink all the time type beer for the monks."
"Wonderful brew. very floral nose, beautiful texture, quite smooth, with a biting bitterness towards the end, very dry. Exceptionally floral hoppyness towards the finish, with some notes of candy sugar, and some burnt malt surprisingly. This is perhaps the ultimate session ale (if it were cheap and readily available......if only!!!). Truly remarkable, and close to being my favourite from westvleteren."
"Mystique surrounds this beer - the 8 and 12 are the well known ones, but no one really talks about the 6.  It's actually a as good as any blonde I've ever had.  It has that characteristic yeasty flavor of Westvleteren beers.  If these were available for a reasonable price in the US I would buy them all the time."
