"Final Grade: 3.65, a B grade. Augustijn Blond is a decent beer, but still not a very notable one. The alcohol is well-masked, and while the flavour profile is suitable and not at all offensive, this still strikes me as a forgettable Belgian pale ale. There just isn't anything jumping out at me about this one, for better or worse. I'd certainly consider having this beer again, and would consider it at least worth a shot - but don't expect anything more than a serviceable Belgian blonde."

"Not in love but I don’t dislike it. I like the fruity aroma but it tastes to much like a white wine or an average pils. At room temp you would think you are drinking a pilsener Urquell. Forgettable."

"A powerful brew in the grand tradition with all the Belgian characteristics. More of a brew to sip respectfully. It's hard to take too much of this with that cloying cake taste. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Ibis Market in Mission Hills."

"Overall I thought this beer was ok at best and I thought it was an average at best example of the style, it didn't really have an aspect that set it apart from all the other average Belgian Blonde Ales and there wasn't any aspect about it that I thought was really well done. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth, very crisp, pretty prickly, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my interest, one is more than enough for me, I figured that out before I got half way through the bottle, the sweetness and super high carbonation would prevent me from even thinking about drinking another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they seemed to be the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness and the high amount of carbonation, they both need to be toned down a good amount. I wouldn't buy this beer and I wouldn't recommend it either, it's not hard to find a much better Belgian Blonde Ale. All in all I wasn't impressed with this one, it just didn't have what it takes to be a great example of the style and It was hard for me to get over how prickly it was. I think this is now one of my least favorite Belgian Blonde Ales. Piraat is still my favorite beer from this brewery and this now my least favorite. Better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me."

"Overall not a bad beer. The alcohol is hidden well and the flavors come together nicely."

"Overall - This is the first Belgian pale ale I've ever tried but the alcohol aftertaste just grosses me out.."
""

"Overall - It's a good but unspectacular Belgian pale Ale, would much rather move up the weight class a bit into Strong Belgian Pale Ales and have one of those."

"I enjoyed this thoroughly, but I didn't need to get outlandishly tipsy drinking it in the process. The extra alcohol no doubt provides more sweetness to the flavor, but the yeasty phenols and grains are good enough that they could do without it. Regardless, this aged quite well in the past 8 months, but perhaps it's even better fresh as it lacks a dynamic dry hopped presence I enjoy in the style."

"An odd Belgian pale to say the least. Normally it's a clean style but this one was not that."
""

"OVERALL: Quite a nice Belgian blonde ale here. Funky yeast, copious malt, good flavors and feel. The bottle now states this beer is 8% abv, and that's the reward for paying the price. A perfect beer on a sunny Sunday afternoon."
""

"To taste: 90/100"

"D: A decent beer...especially for style. A solid table brew...best served with a meal."

"Overall: A solid and spicy blonde with well-hidden ABV that lacks the complexity and refinement of the best Belgian alternatives."
""
""
""
"O: Decent BPA – not my favorite but worthy of a try."
"Overall - While I enjoyed this beer, I found the flavor a bit boring. The mouthfeel definitely helped in delivering a better than average, good belgian brew. That said, I don't think this is a beer I'd look to buy again."
"Overall: Balanced, refreshing."
""
""
"Overall... a very nice and balanced ale, bitterness is present in a malty environement (it is a Belgium), refreshing beer too."
""
"O - Kind of an oddity, but I enjoyed it. A surprising attention getter in the Van Steenberg sampler."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet, no bottled date. This pours a slightly hazy golden light brown color with a massive off white head which is slowly dissipating right now, this leaves a lacing. The smells are of fruity belgian yeast esters, a little citrus. The feel is medium high carbonination. The taste is okay, like many of the other beers from this brewery, it suffers from a high alcohol content which isn't well masked and gives this a certain boozy taste, under that you get some nice citrus like hop bite, a dry finish, not bad."
""
"The taste is similar to the aroma with a slight pepper bite coating my throat and well-integrated alcohol. Very fine."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a translucent, golden-orange with a rocky, two inch, bright white head that slowly collapses in on itself. Head eventually settles into a frothy cap with thick, textured clusters of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses tangerines and a suggestion of candi sugar. There's also a trace of clove and a slight metallic quality. Taste is somewhat bland and also reveals a wet cardboard character as well as a bit of grassiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, palate cleansing carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, a fairly lackluster BSPA - not something I need to revisit again."
"O – Every single one of these Augustijn beers are so, so good. I highly recommend each one of them. Just such a treat, and this one is especially good."

"solid effort. prefer american BSPAs though"

"O: Good solid Belgian. Would drink again."
"Its pretty good, and gets the good done. And although it can be complex at times, this didnt come across as awe-inspiring. Nice, with a good body, and refreshing. Would have it again, but no reason to go out of my way to buy more, especially not at the price i got it at."

"This is a pretty good beer considering they call it a blonde, has more and better tastes than most blondes around here, well blonde beers anyway."
"Overall - Reminds me of Gouden Carolus' Tripel, however, perhaps not as complex or defined. Nice tropical fruits can be noted in this beer when paying attention. Fairly smooth. More in the style of a Tripel to me than a ""Blond"" per se, but still great nonetheless. Definitely worth buying again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a 4, its 8% ABV (Least thats what my bottle says!) And is great for sipping and enjoying the turn of the seasons."
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some mild grass and hay aromas. Taste is of malt, grain, grass, hay, and some fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and pretty refreshing."
""
"Pretty light feeling with the high carbonation. There is just enough stickiness to it though. A good middle to slightly above example. Nothing to complain about, nothing to rave about. Worth trying."
"I don't know if I'd have more than 2 or 3 in a sitting, but that would be plenty. This might be a good beer to end a night with. A sipping beer for after work."
""
"O- I really enjoyed this one, its not the type of thing I drink often so this was a nice change of pace and a well made beer."
"The overall taste acomplishes my expectations but it is not the best Belgian Pale Ale that I've tasted."
"I did not expect that this beer would be this balanced and smooth, although not very special this beer is decent and worth seeking out."
""
""
"Golden-brown body, slightly hazy, with a large puff of foamy white head. Bready aroma, notes of candi sugar and light citrus zest. The aroma follows into the taste, light, pale bready malts, citrus zest, herbal hops, rock candy, light banana esters. Decent, but a bit thin overall. Light-medium body, a bit sticky mouthfeel, light carbonation. A decent drinker, but nothing tremendous."
""
""
""
"Very light brew that could be consumed anytime. Not a bad beer, just looking for a bit more aroma and taste. I would buy it again if my options were limited."
""
"Overall this was a nice Belgian pale; nothing earth shattering, but complex and drinkable. Recommended to any BA looking to branch out into the world of Belgian beer. Looking forward to the rest of the variety pack. Cheers!"
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer, beer is somehwat of as hybrid cross between a trippel and blonde but overall I like it and I think so would you. Salud!"
"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass. The color was that of apple juice but cloudy. The white sudsy head lasted throughout most of the tasting. The nose immediately reminded me of a Leffe Blonde, another Belgian Pale. There is a yeastiness to the nose nose with a mild sour edge. Having been warned of the sourness I was pleasantly surprised to find this beer quite balanced. The yeast and light sour flavors were well countered with just the right degree of hops."
""
"Looks like a blonde ale, has the salty taste of a tripel and the violently ballooning head of a wheat beer. Check your Belgian expectations at the fridge door and you'll do fine with this bottle. Don't expect much fizz (which is good); don't expect much bite (it could use a bit more) and don't expect to drink it quickly (because you have to wait for the dense head to dissipate). Do let it get warm, as that brings out the fruityness that is so remarkable about this beer. Not bad for a single."

"Overall, not bad. The flavors are there, though a bit flawed. Very worth a try, though not my favorite."
""
"Poured a 11.9 oz bottle. A white fluffy root beer float type head ....nice. Lace left slung on glass. Very hazy - bottle conditioning of course. Strong sent of bananas and cloves. Citrus , yeast , bread flavors. Nice silky smooth mouth feel almost creamy. Nice complex example of the style."
""
"Notes: Fair enough, nothing for the ages but rather approachable, very good to share socially and engage people in quality brews. I confess I´m holding a Jeroboam of this for something next week, and I think it should work really well."
""
""
""
"Aroma is of fruits. Taste is strong, fruity and a bit of the alcohol traceable. Very pleasantly drinkable. Mouthfeel is thick and quite carbonated. Overall a really great beer!"
""
""
""
"Simply superb. Clear burnished gold with a monstrous lump of white foam that clung to the tulip glass for the entire drinking session. Intense carbonation kept it light and lively the whole way through. Bright and complex flavors abound: vanilla, banana, rosewater, lemon rind, and Easter grass. Smooooth. I mean really silky smooth. But dry as a bone and endlessly drinkable. The stuff slid down the gullet with ease. Maybe the mood struck me just right, but goddamn this was a really standout Belgian ale."
""
"Without reservation, this is probably the second most beautiful looking beer on the planet! Big ole' thick creamy head. Looks like whipped cream was added from the middle of the brew! Orgasmic! A little tart on the taste, not oft style. Very grainy and gritty. Straw pale looking appearance also. A bit sour however, which is somewhat unattractive. Medium bodied, very crisp just a bit too astringently fruity on the back. A definite keeper."
""
"Feels light, slightly dry, and clean with a medium tingling."
""
"Nothing special here. I like this one more than a great many of the blondes I've had, but this is far from a style I really seek out. Worth a try to say you had it, but nothing I'll come back to."
"Supplementary: Better served at room temperature"
""
""
""
"RATHER GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"Hazy pale blonde colour, just over one finger of white head, fairly thick lace left on the glass. Smell is yeasty with some tropical fruit, some bubblegum/candy notes, mild hop bill, muted spice notes as well. Taste is dry and yeasty, some of the tropical fruit comes out in the middle, spicy, dry fruity finish, light bubblegum and banana flavours come out in finish. High carbonation, dry and fairly full bodied, good feel. This was a really good belgian pale, one of the more enjoyable of the style in recent memory, wonderful dry ale that I will most certainly revisit."
""

"Pours gold with some copper hues. A dish soap-like white heads sits atop, and leaves some stocky and thick lacing behind. Nose has some fruity esters and light fleshed fruits. Big yeast notes, some lightly prickly spicing and a bit of an herbal characteristic. Taste has some pale malts, fruity notes (which come through lighter than presented in the nose) but resemble some peach or nectarine-like fleshiness. White peppery spice. Light mouthfeel, with the carbonation zipping and fizzing at times. A nice refreshing and light blond."
""
""
"Overall, a nice beer but not particularly memorable. Enjoyable to drink but not one to actively seek out."
"D: Not bad, but not a real good belgian pale ale either. Bitterness I felt was a bit much, with the other faintly present tastes (fruits & sugars) taking a back seat. If you don't like typical sweet bpa's then I would recommend giving this a try."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"Appearance is gold, nice foam on the pour. This beer is full of bubbles. Smell is ok and has that typical euro beer. Mouthfeel is strong on the carbonation end, this beer will cause a tingle to the tongue. Taste is nice and very drinkable for this type of beer. Overall we find this beer to be average at best, however we can drink this."
"O-Overall this is a good, but not great Belgian ale."
"Overall, this is a decent Belgian ale, but not the best I've had. It's quite forgettable at the end of the day."
"Atmosphere is decent. Large cascading head, but not much in terms of lacing. Nose is mostly defined by its yeasty nature, but a little balance with a sweet herbal tone. Flavor is pungent and yeasty, but not off-putting. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"ABV 7.5%."
" I just love this one through and through."
"M&D: softly carbonated, smooth on the palate, which goes well with the retrained flavour profile all in all. Not a bad brew, showing a really decent, understated/quiet flavour. Better than Augustijn Brune, in terms of overall performance & balance, IMO."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Pale Ale."
"Overall a very nice Belgian. I have had it several times and it is always enjoyable."
"Fun to drink out a giant bottle. A fine Belgian beer."
"Overall: It's a solid and refreshing beer that would be great for the summer, but certainly enjoyable any time of year. Nice, lighter body with refreshing attributes and an ABV that has a presence, but isn't overwhelming or anything."
"Feels good in the mouth, just a bit above average."
"A decent belgian blonde, but it won't change your life. The complex yeasty characteristics are OK, but it has an acrid undertone that spoils the flavour. Worthy..."
"drinkability: great belgian blonde and not overly sweet. important to me."
"D - quite drinkable."
"O: A good beer, but not great. The flavor is well balanced and certainly worth a try. Doesn't stand out."
"Belgium produces enough beers that one could live there and drink a beer every day and go well over two years without ever having to drink the same beer twice. My suggestion is you skip over Augustijn Blond for both Brouwerij Van Steenberge's and the rest of the country's other (better) offerings. After tonight, I surely doubt I'll have it again."
"D: Could drink these guys all day."
"D: Well, the initial taste is pleasant, the finish is inoffensive, and the alcohol is pretty well hidden. Having said that, I don't like the mouthfeel and I find the flavor falls off a cliff way too quickly."
"Drink - An above average beer that I enjoyed. It seems to be lacking just a little bit of balance, but it's still good nonetheless."
"Super easy to drink, you don't even feel the ABV on this at all goes down so easy, what a great style this is."
"Bottle purchased as part of a brewery mix 6 pack from the LCBO in Ontario. Pours a golden-orange colour with huge white head. I had to wait for the head to dissipate somewhat to actually drink this. Some lacing on the glass. Smells grassy with Belgian yeast. Quite a dry flavour, very understated sweetness. No bitterness at all really. Low carbonation in the mouthfeel, which is surprising given how much head there was."
"D-it has this distinct plastic taste that makes drinking it not all that fun, but its not bad enough to make drinking it turn in to a pain. I don't know...if I had to, I might be able to drink more of this, but not if I have choices."
"Drinkability - This is a decent beer, one i am glad i tried, but not one i would go out to find again."
"Pretty straightforward BPA, yeast dominates with spicy cloves, hints of apple and citrus zest, lemon, light grassy hop finish, grainy malt with a hint of bubblegum. Juicy and round in the beginning with a bone dry finish. Carbonation is through the roof, like swarms of tiny needles in your mouth, makes it hard to pick out flavors. This is a pretty simple ale with one major flaw (carbonation). Not bad but I wouldn't buy it on its own."
"D - Lacks complexity but a good Belgian Pale."
"This is a decent Belgian Blonde Ale along the lines of Duvel, but it's not something that I would likely buy again."
"D- A solid example of a Belgian Pale ale, but nothing really stands out, however, if you're looking for a BPA fix, this one definitely won't let you down. The 7% is almost invisible, and it's a fine drinker."
"The initial opinion of this wasn't too bad, it had alot of your run of the mill Belgian pale notes, but the weird aftertaste wore me down and made it a bit of a struggle to finish."
"Poured from a brown stubby 330 ml bottle into my Affligem chalice. It was a windy day and I was afraid the fluffy head would take off. It laced nicely and was a rich dark golden hue that was extremely cloudy. Smell is yeasty, fruity, and lightly malted. Taste is like a loaf of bread with honey, wheat, and pears. Mouth feel is wonderful; a medium bodied blonde which is not too common. Drinkability is good, but at 7% ABV tread lightly. The bottle gave me a best before of 28/10/11."
"Final Thoughts: I really don't know what they were trying to go for with this one. The problem here is it has a standard Belgian Pale flavour but with a much higher ABV typical of a Strong Belgian Pale or a Tripel. It seems that there is too much yeast and it has gobbled up all the flavour to make that high alcohol taste which isn't being masked well enough by the rest of the beer. I'm gonna say you'll want to pass on this one."
"330 ml stubby bottle, bought at Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is now 7% - seems to vary quite a bit. Pale yellow colour, slightly hazy, huge and white head lasts ""forever"". Fairly nice aroma of spices and Belgian ale yeast. The flavour is mildly spicy with moderate notes of white candi sugar, not too sweet, quite nice. Moderate hops. Light bodied for its strength, alcohol is well hidden, pleasant to drink."
"D- An easy drinking belgian pale ale with a muted flavour profile on the tongue but refreshing in the dry finish. A nice example"
""
"I'll be keeping an eye open for this again."
"Overall, a decent Belgian Pale Ale, but nothing fantastic. The pronounced notes of leather and medicinal phenols in both the nose and taste were a bit of a turn off and didn't seem to have any qualities to bounce it back from this. For me down in Ontario, this beer is only available in the Belgian mixed 6 pack. It's one of the weaker offerings of the set, but the pack is still worth picking up for the other bottles in it."
"Pours a humongous slightly off-white head, big frothy bubbles, somewhat lasting. Body is a clear burnt yellow color, bubbly. Very fruity, floral aroma. Light fruit like apple, pear. Very strong pear aroma. Sweet smelling. Very light taste, some light fruit, a hint of floralness. White grapes and pears perhaps. Refreshing. Watery palate."
"Medium-bodied with fine carbonation. Feels crisp. An approachable and simple pale ale from Belgium."
"Very tasty, light hop close. Another solid brew."
"Augie Blond is a very nice Belgian pale ale. It is not over carbonated, which I prefer, unlike so many of the Belgians."
"Overall this is a decent Belgian ale, but it's a little rough around the edges for me."
