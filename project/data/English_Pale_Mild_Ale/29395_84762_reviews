"O-I finally managed to get to Hogshead and I was happy to do so. This is a pretty good, easy-drinking pale ale. The dry-hopped version I had opened with an easy, somewhat boring, fruity and bread pale, malt flavor but finished with a nice bit of bittering citrus, bite and intrigue. Quaffable and interesting."

"a decent session brew from this new brewery northwest of denver metro. pours clear new penny color with a couple fingers of white lace. the smell is caramel malts and pale malts, english in origin, and a surprising bit of bittering hops as well. flavor is laid back drinkable balanced brew, with a little character from a curious yeast coming through. this is a pretty good summer beer, but as with their porter, it is sort of nondiscript. no different from countless other beers of the same style. its well made, but not exciting. feel is a little flat, and i probably should have tried it from the cask instead. light enough body, down easy. overall nothing going to blow your mind here, but a good summer slammer."
"On cask and dry-hopped with East Kent Goldings. Light bright yellow-orange, sudsy head. Brief citrus like smell, nice aroma. Flavor is just a solid English ale, malty yet a hint of hops, easy drinking, delicious. I wish I could be more nuanced and descriptive but this was just flat out a good session beer."
