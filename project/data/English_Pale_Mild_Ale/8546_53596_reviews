"This was a wild card buy because it was on the cheap, nothing really to be excited about here... quite the opposite to be honest. Very similar to Stella Artois; a skunky, light and horrible taste. The skunkyness was really the defining factor, I would be interested to see if it held up any better away from the clear bottle and would certainly consider a half pint on tap otherwise I doubt I will be drinking this again - generally I would say of even bad drinks that I would take it over a standard beer like stella but in this instance its so similar to stella, if it was the choice between the two I would probably just opt for a case of stella as opposed to a similar number of these and save a few quid."
"Particularly bland English beer. It may tick some of the admittedly easy English Mild boxes, but it really doesn't give you anything in the package."
"the beer is drinkable but the missus would probably throw me out."
"A fairly average ale - unexciting. Nothing horrible, but little to stimulate the senses. Body is also pretty thin. I probably won't bother with this again - there are more exciting options out there."
"D. A pleasant offering from Thwaites. I will own up to not being a particular fan of their beers but could quite happily down one or two more of these. I just wish there was a little bit more complexity in the nose and in the mouth."

"Doesn't really seem to fit the English pale mild ale but on the other hand it certainly isn't what I would have expected from a beer describing itself as gold. All that said, I really like this very refreshing number."
