"Bottle from Sainsburys supermarket (UK)"
"Bottle has freshness date a couple of months away. Amber coloured beer with a decent head which sticks around for quite a while. It has a sweet lemon and dried fruit nose. Initially fairly nondescript then a wee hoppy blast, a slightly biscuity taste, and then a more herbal hoppy finish: nowhere near as sweet as the nose suggests. This feels insubstantial but doesn't taste watery. Overall better than anticipated. I agree this seems wrongly categorised."
"Different and pleasant, not sure it's a Pale Mild though?"
"It was just so damn fresh, but then I live about 2 hours from the brewery. It pours well, and drinks well. The flavour is somewhat floral, but not overpowering. Decent amount of hops, but not bitter. It has more body than their blonde and went very well with the BBQ dinner out in the backgarden with some good Ayrshire sausages!"
"This theme of hops and orange continue their domination through to the taste with a slightly after-taste of spices. However the body of the beer let it down, very watery, no head retention; this very quickly started to remind me of lager. Too much so to be anything more than a thirst quencher, however I would go for something else personally."
"D: I canÂ’t say I like this beer, but it surely tastes different for a bitter/pale ale with its semi-sour juice suggestion at each step. That said, I'm still unclear about what it means by ""English Pale Mild Ale"" which this beer is categorised here..."
"As I said earlier, the taste is unbalanced: With some more powerful malt, this would have been a fantastic ale."
