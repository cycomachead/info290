The Chicken Man who is eventually moving to the land of Utah provided this morsel. The beer poured a hazy copper with foamy head that is leaving a lace. The scent is very faint almost non-descript. The taste is very well balanced between malt and bittering hops. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer that is very sessionable.","WoodBrew","Jul 14, 2014"

The mouthfeel is probably the highpoint since the smell and taste are somewhat uninspiring. Criticisms aside, there would be nothing wrong with sharing a few pints of this with friends at a bar.","spoony","Jun 24, 2014"

Some mild hops round it out at the end. Taste is malt forward with very mild flavors. The base grain come through strong with light notes of sweetness which is cut by dry biscuit notes. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, this is an easy drinking brew. Not sure how this is a mild though.","homebrew311","Jan 17, 2014"

3.58,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,"A respectable mild malt beverage. This probably won't appeal to any IPA hop heads, but, then, this isn't the style.

3.67,5.2,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"aside from the obvious question of how a mild makes the exponential series, this is a pretty good brew. its not what I expected though, and English mild, this is decidedly American. darker in color too, caramel, medium spectrum, heady and well carbonated. it has more than just light grain, and I appreciate immediately its diversity. there is a touch of smoke, some darker toast, and the delicacy of white wheat, all in great balance. our bottle says 4.5% abv, and it certainly doesn't seem any more than that, very drinkable and soft. not as interesting as some, but the plethora of grains makes it not boring. not sure I could session this long enough to catch a buzz, but I like its richness for the abv, and I like how smooth it finishes, flavorful and everything in good harmony. not a beer that's meant to wow you, epic has plenty of choices for that, but a good hearty mild as they go, and one I wouldn't be opposed to drinking again, especially at about 4 bucks a bomber, very appealing.","StonedTrippin","Oct 10, 2013"

Nose carries a sweet bread character, some metal, leaves, wood, white grape jelly, and the slightest hint of connecticut leaf tobacco. Flavor is a bit astringent, some cardboard, some loose grain, a bit of oatmeal (plain), some raisin, and a hint of pekoe. Medium bodied with moderate carb and an off dry finish.

Smell is pretty subtle with some grain and slight fruity aromas. Taste is also very subtle with grain and some fruity and almost tea-like flavors.

The nose is caramel, floral notes, honey, mild hops, malt. Fairly weak, although pleasant smell to this beer. The taste is completely different than the nose. I get hops, caramel, nuts, and malt. Not bad for the style. Feel is light, with light carbonation and a slightly malty finish. Overall, a decent beer in the style. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Dec 28, 2011"

The taste is similar to the aroma with a lot of vanilla and toffee, and hints of caramel and honey. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation.
