3.57,0,,,,,,"Mild, balanced between malt and hops, though the latter are pretty tame. Very traditional Kentish ale that you could knock back.","StJamesGate","Apr 08, 2009"

3.35,0,,,,,,"Mouthfeel is silky, hint of a tickle at the front of the tongue, fluffy in back.","JohnQVegas","May 17, 2006"
3.68,0,,,,,,"Pours a hazed orange/amber. Nice creme head. Nose is citric hops. Flavor is mild with some hop characteristics there and a definite bitterness. Definitely on the earthy side. Somewhat of a grassy aftertaste. Feel is about standard. It's nice, yes. The obliterated American palate might not appreciate it so much, but it's pretty decent.","RblWthACoz","Beers"
3.97,0,,,,,,"M&D: lightly carbonated and very light-bodied, this pale mild is, IMHO, the best I've tried, even better than the Timothy Taylor's Golden Best (which is tasted far away from Yorkshire, so no competition here actually)~~ What a pale mild... it'd surprise you if this beer style had never occured in your mind.","wl0307","0"
