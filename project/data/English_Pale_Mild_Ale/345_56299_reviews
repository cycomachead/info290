"Clear yellow with bright white head. Nose is creamy and hay like. Palate is richer than it should be with fresh cream and golden ale like. Very refreshing and creamy texture. Really a wonderful way to start the day!"
"Pours a light cloudy nitro gold with the cascading effect and a creamy white cap. Aroma is faint, a touch of grassy hops and English pale malts. A gentle flavor of mild grains, noble hopping and a light lemony twang. Easy drinking, super smooth, carbonation was so low the beer pulled almost like air, very light. A mellow brew but pleasing in its ways. Similar to a boddingtons pub ale but even lighter on the palate."
"I found this be quite the flavorful and quaffable offering from Victory that really is the definition of what a session beer should be. They really packed a lot into this 3.5% Mild. I could probably drink this all day and not get bored with it."
"D: the epitome of a session beer. Light, delicate flavors with really low alcohol. Good offering, and leaves me with only two more styles to try, which is a bit sad as every new style really presents something different, which is always nice."
"Given the extremely low abv and the style, this is a beer you could drink for days. Personally, I found it to be a little too bland for my liking."
"Served up a deep golden color with a wonderful creamy white head and nice lacing. Served on nitro, something I did not realize until I asked for a growler of it and was turned down. The aroma was very clean with great biscuit malt sweetness and just a hint of fruitiness. It smelled almost like a Dortmunder lager, but with a bit of ale yeast character. The taste picked up where the aroma left off. Clean, malty sweet and delicious. Some grassy hops were present, but bitterness was quite low. It also had a sort of buttery quality that I found to be unique, and a welcome guest at the flavor party. The mouthfeel was light to medium with a wonderful smoothness from the nitro and a subdued carbonation. I could pound these all day and the super low ABV would mean that my biggest worry would be bathroom breaks. Possibly the best Victory draft only offering I have had to date."
"Perhaps it's because I wasn't really jones-ing for a golden ale on a near 70' Boston winter's day (technically, though it's really Spring for what it's worth). Regardless, it was a nice pour from Michael at the Otherside, so there's no faulting his recommendation either. Brilliant yellow straw colored with a dense white creamy head a la nitro, though I was told cask...Crisp and clean with subtle malt and a bit of flower an mineral water, but overall bland. The creamy head that stuck nicely as lace did add some nice body to this cream ale meet pilsener. A good hot day low alcohol substitute for many weaker contenders, but not that impressive overall. Nice as a cream ale."
"Drinkability: this beer was a pleasure to have after having a big alcohol beer. Very easy to quaff and despite the mild flavor profile, and it is somewhat refreshing."
"Glad I tried one."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with crisp carbonation up front leading to a watery, thin finish."
"D - This beer is not for everyone - even our waitress said it was 'like pilsner with a few icecubes tossed in', but for the style I liked it found it tasty and worthy of more samples if they hadn't had 14-16 other great brews on at the brewpub"
