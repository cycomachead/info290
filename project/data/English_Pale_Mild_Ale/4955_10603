3.28,0,,,,,,"That would be an amazing beer if it had more body and keeping the same proportion but increasing the quantity of its hops added to the recipe.","FLima","Sep 03, 2011"
3.47,0,,,,,,"D: A fairly pleasant & appealing pale that is leaning toward a summer mild. I would prefer it to have some more darker C-malt notes, but then it might be ""just"" a mild. Oh well it's good as it is. Milds are a good thing â€“ I don't understand why more people do not appreciate small flavorful beers.","SickGnar","Dec 27, 2008"
3.38,0,,,,,,"Whilst in Bogota and I visited Palos De Moguer and the second beer I tried was the Colon Rubia. The appearance was golden in color with good carbonation and white head. The aroma carried hints of lemon and grain....somewhat similar to their Light beer. The taste had more malt than hop with hint of lemon. The mouthfeel was easy to drink and smooth....certainly worth a try.","WoodBrew","Jun 23, 2003"
3.67,0,,,,,,"Bitterness has seemed to be increased a bit, very balanced and tasty. In my book, is very much a West Coast style of english ale, more citrusy bitter than typical english. I'm upgrading the taste","mooseisloose","Beers"
