"Straw coloured beer with a decent white head from bottle with freshness date eight months away. The nose is mostly lemony and perhaps a tad grassy. Fresh lemon flavour, starting somewhat sweetly but becoming more bitter. Increasing caramel element the more I drink. Neither bold nor bland, a decent refreshing beer for a rare warm summer evening like this one."
"O - a nice pint I can say no more."

"An easy drinking session ale that is quite tasty and grows on me as it disappears, straightforward and not too exciting though."
"O: A good beer, but rather boring. Not recommended. I probably wouldn't have again. Still, good effort."
