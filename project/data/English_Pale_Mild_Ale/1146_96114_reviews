"The Pre-Gold Box Excursion continues with a beer described by the menu as an ""English summer ale with wheat"". Okay... It pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-wet grass, wheat, light corn, and a hint of lemon peel. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the wheat is fuller and funkier, and methinks I detect a pinch of cardamom. The funkiness is off-putting, though not quite enough to make me react very viscerally. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a decent little brew, but not something I'd go for another pour of any time soon."
