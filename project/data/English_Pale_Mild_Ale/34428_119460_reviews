"Pours a deep garnet, ruby color with a two finger off white head that disappates quickly.  Aroma shows sweetness with hints of caramel, toffee, and chocolate.  Taste is similar with caramel, toffee, and more chocolate.  Mouthfeel is thin with light carbonation.  Overall a good example of the style and a drinkabke, sessionable brew."

"Overall, a really nice example of the style. I hope this new, small brewery doesn't go under as this is a very sessionable beer that will now be in my rotation of regular beers."
