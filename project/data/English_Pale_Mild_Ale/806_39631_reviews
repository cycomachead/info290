"A delicious holiday discovery. All round nice easy drinking beer now brewed at Wychwood Brewery. All Brakspear's copper tanks were moved over to the Wychwood Brewery to maintain the same process and flavour. Apparently the yeast dates back to 1776? A unique old school ale."
"O: Surprisingly tasty flavour given that this ale uses Golding, Styrian Golding, Fuggle and Admiral Hops."

"500ml bottle has freshness date July 2013. Fairly dark amber colour with decent white head. The nose is a combination of dired fruit, lemon and honey. Seems a tad watery to start, until the hops kick in. Then a very pleasant, slightly oily feeling lemony bitterness with an accompanying nutty (perahps hazelnut) element. The first time I consumed a bottle of this I was under the impression that I was drinking brakspear Bitter and wondered what had gone wrong, but it has definitely grown on me after a few bottles over the last couple of years."

"O - A simple and low-key, but very well-executed English beer. Balanced, clean and not over-the-top in any one area, but very enjoyable."
"This was close to expiration date, I guess it aged quite well. Very well balanced beer, not too heavy but not boring, I would be more than happy to quaff a six pack."

"Thanks to Billy for this one!"

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Pale mild Ale."

"I will finish it and if bought it will drink but not going to buy again in a hurry."

"A decent ale, though not amazing. The aroma is pretty good, and the taste is well-rounded. Could imagine sinking a few on a hot day. Worth trying if you come across it."
"O: A very reasonable ""spiced up lager"". Not a bad purchase."
"Overall, at start I thought 'good session beer' then it got too dry. Suspect will be a glass of water job to wash down at end. Meh."
"Overall: very recomended for all purposes"
"How is this Pale Mild? It says ""Gold"" right on the bottle. Some pungent hops, some fruit and toast - good balance all around. Solid easy drinker."
"Cheers!"
"A: Well worth a try."
"Quite fragrant, but doesn't beg you to gulp it down. Lovely bitter fruitiness that hit my sweet spot this evening."
"Overall: Refreshing and quaffable, but lacks body and complexity of flavour."
"Solid and drinkable beer overall. Nice session beer (if you're not a 4% = session beer diehard tool that is)."
"D - Plenty in this beer to keep you interested."
"Quite drinkable."
"Notes: Best before 31/12/10. A very nice, solid English session beer. Very nicely balanced and easy to drink. Doesn't stand out as amazing, but it continues to grow on you as you drink it."
"A good distinct bitter brew."
"The brew is very drinkable and i can see this being a mid-week regular"
"D: Nothing to write home about. Goes down easy, but with a little extra twist (in the bitterness). A beer for bar-hopping."
"D: I didn't think it was exceptional. but it did not fall short in any category except price."
"Although this is definitely on the bitter end of the scale for my tastes, it's definitely drinkable and ranks with similar ales like St. Peter's Organic Ale and Tribute Premium Cornish Ale."
"There is a tang and pungency to the taste, bitter with an easy mixed fruit feel to it. No trace of any malt in the flavour, but it was sharp, refreshing and invigorating, a good beer for a hot day or night."
"Being in this weight class offers major sessionability. It's admittedly not a style I am well-versed in but it's an easy pour and a solid foundation."
"Overall, quite a nice EPMA. The taste is indicated in the style; ""mild"". This brew still has a nice complexity to it, it just seems that everything is toned down. Can easily make a nice lawnmower beer but at over $4.00 a bottle, I'm not sure I'll be turning to this again any time soon."
"Final Thoughts - As many people have commented, this would be a great session ale. It's different then the usual, has a low alcohol content and does have an interesting influx of flavors going for it. Also, being able to cleanse my pallet of the aftertaste is welcome."
"Very refreshing, nice biscuity malts, nice and sweet body that finishes slightly bitter. This would be a perfect beer on a hot summer day."
"Seems to be fairly true to style based on my limited knowledge. Certainly a session ale, although the sulfur is something im not particularly accustomed to or overly fond of at this point. It would be better suited to summer than the depth of winter. The logic of the LCBO escapes me. Welll worth trying, hopefully this comes back to Ontario come summer."
"Best before June 25/09. Honey-gold, momentary white head flattens to a wispy film with a solid ring and some lacing. Steady small bubble slow moving carbonation. Aroma of honey dew, lime, citrus. There is a muted tartness that's well controlled, green melon, clean, crisp, dry, bitter ... all within a honey backdrop that happily lacks the associated sweetness. Refreshing bitterness has a nice understated malty finish, again nicely balanced and pleasant. This beer reminded me of what a Corona would like to be. It would make a fine summer sessional at 4.6 per cent ABV, not overly serious but the combination of Target and Goldings hops and organic breeding work out rather well in this instance, I thought highly of this beer considering the style."
"Pours a clear amber, some gold highlights, thin white head forms, quickly begins to settles down to a thin ring, a few lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is neat, very malty, raw honey, some caramel, biscuits, light bit of floral, some fruit, not a whole lot going on but I do like the honey character. Taste is similar, a bit watery on the flavour, but a real nice honey character, some toast, light floral hoppiness, touch of jasmine, very light spicy bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to low carbonation. Easy drinker, nothing complex, but I could see myself putting down a few of these in an evening."
"A decent light ale with nuance and balance. It could be more robust without entering the English bitter or pale ale realm."
"D - Very drinkable and well balanced."
"Earns part of its name with a nice gold colour. Moderate short lived head and some little lace. Passable overall."
"D: Approachable & sessionable, but not overly enticing. Perhaps a gateway/transitional brew."
"A sessionable organic ale."
"It's is very gulpable beer, not very special but really nice."
"M&D: light-bodied, slightly yeasty but overall quite fresh for a cask ale. Brakspear's yeastiness certainly leaves a deep imprint in the overall flavour profile, rendering a lightly dryish touch throughout the drink. Solid!"
"Drinkability: Refreshing and quaffable. At 4.6% abv, sessionable."
"Overall - An average pale ale... worth a try..."
"Other comments: This is probably one of the better beers from Brakspear and definitely a good organic beer."
"A good example of this rather new style."
