"This is a weird beer, and not at all what I expect to be getting from Helltown. This German/English hybrid seems fairly evident, but it's just...weird. Odd mix of flavors: tangy, nutty, very mild spicy. No cohesion, as it just seems all over the place. This is weird, and it just doesn't work. At all. Can I find an IPA from Helltown already, for the love of Pete."

"OVERALL: English Pale Mild is a good descriptor of this beer. The hops used were a bit more American, but it works great here. Helltown is a fine little brewery and so far everything they've done has been excellent."

"I'm gonna call this one a pale mild bordering on a bitter, because the hops are soft enough. Not bad. I'd dig into another one."
