2.53,-28.1,4,3.5,2,2.5,2,"I had this on tap as part of a sampler, this was one of most disappointing beers for sure...It actually looks really nice, nice gold color, good retention...The aroma is nice too, light but gives off some decent hops...The taste is terrible, all skunk from start to finish, nothing redeeming here at all. At 3.5% I'd almost rather drink an American macro.","jrallen34","Aug 23, 2008"
5,42,5,5,5,5,5,"What a great session beer that taste like a beer. Great yeast notes mildly hopped but in balance. Not astringent like some mild beers that turn out watery. This beer is light in body but throws a great head, it is after all a session beer. Great for drinking but it really doesn't stand up to having with a meal. Just enjoy one at the bar. Faint brown to copper color.","ComputerBeer","Jan 26, 2007"
3.65,3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Appears light gold with a short white head in my glass. There's a sweet biscuit aroma with herbal hops. A little more hops come out in the flavor with a fresh cut grass note. The overall flavor here is light, but it's also delicate and relatively complex. I'll call this a good session beer.","tempest","Dec 05, 2006"
2.9,-17.6,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Very sessionable at 3.5% and still aroma and taste, but skip it for the pils. Aroma was both hoppy and malty. Orangey with a little white head, with lace. Bitterness and a bit of fruit, metallic finish. A light mouthfeel and prickly active carbonation. Perhaps the weakest in their lineup","Sammy","Jun 18, 2006"
3.26,-7.4,2,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"Originally reviewed on January 18, 2005. On tap at the brewpub. An orange-yellow pour, with no head. Light orange and cascade arom. Very light and very watery. Light bitter flavor, with light resin. Palate is light grassyness. Finish is sweet and a little puckery. Drinkable.","CharlesDarwin","Nov 10, 2005"
3.63,3.1,3.5,3,4,3,4,"Mild is sure is. Pours out to a light brown / hazy yellow color with a small head of white foam. Aromas are light, but hints of dark fruits and grain are noted. Taste is suprisingly robust for such a low ABV brew; malt, estery fruits, mashed grain, mild hops. Nice. Mouthfeel was mediocre and had no real character. Drinkability I must say is good. I could easily drink this for a session, no problem. Likely not for everyone, but worthy of a try.","Frozensoul327","Mar 29, 2005"
4.12,17,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"ItÂ’s hard to strike the balance between flavor and light body as required by the style. This version does it well and makes for an excellent session brew. A lunch-time favorite.","Shovelbum","Sep 09, 2004"
3.07,-12.8,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Hazy Golden color accompanied by a light fruity aroma and a hint of hops. Balanced bitterness, but much more than expected. The bitterness lingers on the finish. Little malt to speak of. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side as well, perhaps due to the lack of malt. An OK beer, but not really enjoyable.","aaronh","Sep 08, 2004"
3.49,-0.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"After having another, The cardboard taste is gone but some of the other tastes aren't as prominent. Also the head is non-existant on this one. I'll bump the taste 1/2 point but the appearance suffered","ken3c","Beers"
