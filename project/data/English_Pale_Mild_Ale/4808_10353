3.89,13.1,3,4,4,3.5,4,"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV of the bottled version is 4.2%. Extremely pale and crystal clear yellow colour, moderate white head. Very nice hoppy aroma with strong notes of oranges and tropical fruits. The flavour is zesty and well hopped throughout, with a nice grapefruity bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. A typical "summer ale" which I, however, was quite happy to drink on a dreary January night.","Sigmund","Aug 03, 2007"
