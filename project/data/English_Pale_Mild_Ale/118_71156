3.18,-2.8,3,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Straw coloured beer with a decent white head from bottle with freshness date eight months away. The nose is mostly lemony and perhaps a tad grassy. Fresh lemon flavour, starting somewhat sweetly but becoming more bitter. Increasing caramel element the more I drink. Neither bold nor bland, a decent refreshing beer for a rare warm summer evening like this one.","charlatan","Oct 03, 2013"
