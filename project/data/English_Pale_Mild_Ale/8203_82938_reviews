"Certainly worth trying...especially if you're able to get it on-tap and fresh"

"Overall- For Paddock Wood's summer seasonal, I feel this brew fell flat in many areas including the body which needs some fine tuning. This is good for trying something different, but it doesn't have that ""umph"" factor."
"Above average but not great ale. Nice session ale on a hot summer day."
"O - for a light ale it is big on flavours, a very easy drinking light ale, decent for a summer session but not something I would buy regularly given the vast selection out there"
"A decent mild pale ale, it has the flavour to punch a weight class higher, that's for sure, and should surely do nicely as a lower ABV summer option."
"Not sure the style for this one as I couldn't find it on Paddock Wood's web site but English style ale's named on the bottle and I felt Pale Mild was the best fit"
