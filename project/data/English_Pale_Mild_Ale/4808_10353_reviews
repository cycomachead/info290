"Rather nice. Light, but tasty and refreshing. Subtle aromatic hops and a dry character make this a pleasure to drink. Would be great on a hot day. Worth sampling."

"Very drinkable in deed."
"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV of the bottled version is 4.2%. Extremely pale and crystal clear yellow colour, moderate white head. Very nice hoppy aroma with strong notes of oranges and tropical fruits. The flavour is zesty and well hopped throughout, with a nice grapefruity bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. A typical ""summer ale"" which I, however, was quite happy to drink on a dreary January night."
"Drinkability - average golden ale. Nice aroma but not enough taste for the carbonation and alcohol."
"Overall - Another pretty standard and dull English blonde ale... worth a try maybe once..."
