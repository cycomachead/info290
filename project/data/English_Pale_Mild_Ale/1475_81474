2.99,0,,,,,,"Draft pint at the Maumee Bay Brewing location in beautiful downtown Toledo down by the river. Arrived a ruby copper color with a thin tan head. Very little aroma. Big malty-bready Maris Otter sourdoughish taste. Very low hops, all Kent Goldings. 34 IBU --- really? Very Brit. Malt forward with a hops twang. Decent.","atomicbeer","Jun 15, 2012"

4.12,0,,,,,,"Crispness is key to this beer, though it has a nice, flowing smoothness to it as well. It seems a little light in the feel, though not too thin; I just wonder if it couldn't have a touch more body.","Brenden","0"
