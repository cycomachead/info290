3.8,0,,,,,,"A nice easy-drinking English pale mild, though a bit husky. Nothing "mind blowing" but fits the style and has enough it to be enjoyable.","jwc215","Aug 19, 2008"
3.88,0,,,,,,"Pours a clouded orange with a brown hue. Nose is grains. Flavor is slightly hopped with a bitter overall tone. Firm and full, but doesn't go overboard. Feel is about typically what I'd expect. Very easy to drink. An Americanized version of the style that carries a bit of a bite, but who cares. At least I don't have to worry about destroying my brain tonight. Edit: Well. Figured out a way to do that anyways. (Need more milds!)","RblWthACoz","Aug 12, 2007"
3.65,0,,,,,,"Presented in a pint glass, a mostly clear gold with a tall white head that disappeared but left generous lacing. The aroma and flavor are rich with a dry, grainy biscuit and husk taste that balanced but a touch of spicy, herbal hops and slight cookie sweetness. A tasty session beer and worth a try.","tempest","Beers"
4.05,0,,,,,,"I tried this one at the Gingerman in NYC last night. This is a fine example of an English style cask ale. Very subtle hopping and quite drinkable. Even at cellar temperature this beer is very refreshing. It has many of the same flavors found in a cask bitter, but less of the "high" notes. I expect some might try this and find it's not "big" enough and will wish there were more hops, more body, etc. But there are so many beers that fill the "big" slot. In this excellent English Pale Mild Ale, the subtle flavors and almost watery follow through are what make this a winner.","TeddyBrew","0"
