"Es una buena cerveza,  fiel al estilo Pale Ale; lo sorprendente es lo ligeray digerible al gusto. Totalmente refrescante y hecha en México."
"Its better on the nose than on the mouth"

"Brownish and transparent colour, small lasting off-white head. No doubt it’s a pale ale, but it seems to be relatively modestly hopped. Aroma includes biscuits, finish is a little sweet. A more than decent alternative to your Mexican lager. Nothing special but not bad."

"A not-so-sanely categorized beer - this is a pale ale, no foolin', with a clear identity schism between Yankee and Red Coat - regarding the booze alone (props though to the seamless integration) discounts the given classification (Miiild? There's nothing miiild about it!). Anyway, a decent ale, flavourful, and moderately hopped. Worth the pesos, that point is beyond reproach."

"Overall, best Mexican beer I've had and nice to have something different; can see how this picked up a gold at World Beer Cup 2010."
"Overall not bad, better than pretty much anything else around here, decent english pale, slight skunk but barely, never know how the beers are treated here."
"~j~"
"Body is a little thin, finishes with a strange note of metallic something or other that doesn't follow from the ingredients. Sessionable and decent but not quite as good as I was hoping."
"Glad Minerva offers something outside of the standard macro-lager fare, but this Pale Ale is definitely not up to the caliber of their Stout."
"Very tasty english brew. Easily sessionable. Opens up very nicely as it warms up. A very good interpretation of the English Ales. The style may seem boring to some of the BAs used to bolder American Ales. However this is a truly great beer and very nice for a session, every day brew. Highly recommended. Probably one of the best regular ales brewed in Mexico."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with nice carbonation. A very smooth offering from Minerva, probably their best. Very easy to drink and a great alternative to Mexican macro-lagers."
