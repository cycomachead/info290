"Starts like a blonde ale but soon succumbs to a darker, dry malt and a bitter hop. Dry finish that lingers lightly for a long time. Rich body with a normal level of carbonation."

"Poured from cask into pint at the Brewpub in Montreal. Pours a creamy brown amber with thick white creamy head. Smells of sweet malts and a small bit of fruit. Taste is very similar to aroma...sweet and malty but crisp and a bit of fruity hop. Very drinkable and smooth. Low ABV and very easy to drink, plus its tastey. Nice afternoon brew :)"

"O: One of my all time favorite beer, I'm happy to know they usually have it on cask since it's a spectacular beer that is usually overlooked by the general crowd because they might think low ABV=less interesting."
