3.25,23.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, pale malt scent with a touch of hops and ringwood yeast esters. The taste is average. It has a light and grainy, pilsner malt flavor that's watery, yet quaffable. It's devoid of malt character, yet has a faint hop taste. It goes down easy with crisp, clean finish. The mouthfeel is average. It's a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great hot weather beer. It's light and low in alcohol. It would be a great session ale for the hot months of the year.","WesWes","Jan 21, 2009"
2.36,-10.3,3,2,2,2,3.5,"This beer is a light better then say a bud but not much. There is no aroma and the look is very light golden color. The head was there but dissipates quickly. This starts with a sweet wheat tastes that finishes fast. For a light its ok not the best but not the worst.","bishopdc0","Beers"
2.39,-9.1,3.5,2,2,2,3.5,"Off the tap this beer was a bleached golden color. The head was one-finger, snow-white, retained decently and left good lacing. The aroma... was non-existent. Lame. The flavors were also weak, hints of grain and very light pale malt with a semi-bitter character at the end. The mouthfeel was miserably watery, the body light and the carbonation medium. Craft-brewed, beer-flavored water.","thekevlarkid","0"
