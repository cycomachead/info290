"M: Body was slightly thin- I'd love to see this mild on the engine."
"Very right pour, clear reddish brown hue with a off white head that does not waver. Nutty, toasty, bready aroma and flavor. Very easy drinking at 3.7% but a whole lot more flavor compared to what most brewers are pushing out during this session beer craze. Hats off to 2nd Story for brewing a true session ale and keeping it pretty authentic."
"American style pour was more flavorful with chocolate in the taste.  The English pull style pour was more of a tea flavor in the beer."
