"I am not sure how many other Amber Milds I have had but this satisfies with attributes from both spectrums."

"Overall: this is a very drinkable brew. I think it would be perfect for tailgating -- now if they would only distribute to Seattle!"
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy medium golden amber with a fine one finger ivory head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet, mildly biscuit malt, tea, a hint of nuts. Flavor follows, with mild, almost diluted biscuit malt, a hint of grassy hops, finishing with a dry hop bitterness with little hop flavor. Light bodied with good carbonation. The malt and light hops seemed very English in flavor, and although the flavor felt a bit attenuated, that seems fair for an ale named ""mild"". Good malt flavor and light, but English style hops. This is not a style I have much experience with, so I'm not sure how much flavor I should be expecting. The taste that is present is pleasant, but light and appropriately British."

"A half-inch of head rests on top this electric orange liquid with yellow hues. The glass becomes covered in spotted lace all the way down. The aroma has an interesting fruitiness to it, like dates. A kiss of plain chocolate and a slight amount of hops brings some hope to the taste. There is some flavor, although it's simple and not intense. A kiss of chocolate and vague esters make much of the flavor, which overall is okay. It's light bodied and a little watery, but would be an okay choice as a lower alcohol beer."
"This is one of the better Utah supermarket brews. Very drinkable, mild, pleasant quaff. From the 16 oz can bought at Emigration Market in Sal Lake City. This can is several months old, and still has a spritzy freshness."

"Overall a distinctly middle of the road ale."

"Good solid mild, getting impressed with the few offerings I've had from this brewery."
"Overall, drink this from a glass. It tastes terrible from the can. From the glass, it's not great, not bad, just a little above average. Not sure why this ale is classified as an English Pale Mild Ale. It tasted like a regular malt-forward American Amber Ale to me. Some of their Utah competitors brew much better brews. To be fair, I'd say this brew fits the month because this is the time of year when peaches and apricots have ripened in the hot summer sun. Fairly refreshing."

"The Crack unleashed a brimful CAN and an inverted Glug produced two fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Nose had a nutty, caramel malty scent. Mouthfeel was medium and the nuttiness of the malt was immediate on the tongue along with a light grassy hoppiness. I CANnot say that I CANsider myself an expert on the style, but in looking at the site's description, I would say that this is an excellent example. The finish had a light butteriness which is apparently okay in the style. At only 4.0% ABV, it could easily be a session beer, but I always feel like I need more hops. Say Moh-are, you hopheads!"
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is kind of mild, some malts, a bit nutty. Taste is smooth, very easy drinking. Some hops up front, followed by the malts and a bit of nuttiness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing, easy drinking beer."
"M: Light to medium bodied."

"This is a nicely crafted brew. It has lots of flavor and isn't watery."

"A dead horse is an appropriate symbol for this beer. It needs CPR desperately. It is light on all respects. Light in color, lacing, mouthfeel, taste, and general satisfaction. The brewmasters need to serve an apprenticeship at a northwest brewery. It's OK on a hot day when there is nothing but Bud, Miller, and Hamm's as alternatives - but that's not saying much. Joseph Smith...you need googles other than those made of stone."
"Apparently you can beat a dead horse."
"Overall: The body of the beer is thin & watery he finish is mild. I feel that the beer lacks a lot of character and life. I will revisit this beer."
"D: Mild flavors, smooth texture, balanced body and clean finsih make this a nice and easy session brew."
"D: not up to par with the rest of the beers in this style. I couldn't finish it."
"Bottom line: A very average brew at best and 1 I'd not consider to drink again."
"Pours straw colored, almost orange in the darker light of the dinning room here. Smells of caramel malts and very slight grassy hops. Some sweet caramel malt up front followed by a nice earthy hopping that finished clean, at first. There's a slight tinge to the aftertaste that I can't quite pick out (no freshness date on the bottle). Feels watery on the tongue, actually a bit watery across the board...nothing really stands out all that much. Completely drinkable on a nice summer day but I've got gotos in the fridge that'll be pulled first."
"Very light and easy drinking, in the English Mild tradition (style as stated on the label). Several wouldn't be out of the question in warmer weather."

"Overall a clean and crisp ale that gains points for its good drinkability. Thanks to Wasatch."
"Overall- Just to thin and watery."
"Very weak flavor. More like carbonated water with some off flavors than a beer to me. Malt flavors are thin and more noticeable in the aftertaste than with each sip. Just some ever so slight hop presence, but again I find it more in the aftertaste. I would forget I was drinking a beer if it were not for the aftertaste. Medium to light mouthfeel that leans toward watery. Probably a nice quaffable beer on a hot summer day after yard work but not something to savor in the evening."
"Thanks to jcwattsrugger for bringing this back from Utah."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, there are certainly several other beers with a kick as mild as this beer’s that I would prefer to drink if I’m going to go for a lighter style of beer."
"D: Nice to try. Not outstanding but wouldn't turn down another either. ABV is unknown, but something tells me this is a lower one, sessionable and certainly drinkable for 2 pints at least. Thanks again, John."
"Hats off to Wasatch for a fine frosty sent from Utah!"
"This is my first Moab beer (thanks Wasatch) so I don't yet have enough information to pass judgment on the brewery as a whole. The basic framework for the construction of a quality amber ale is present, it just needs to be fleshed out a little. This Dead Horse could use a little more life."
"Overall, a vaguely drinkable lawnmower beer, with no huge flaws other than the lack of interesting flavor or body. I certainly won't spend much more money on it, if any."
"You can't beat a dead horse, eh? We'll see about that. Pours a lazy orange copper into a pint glass. Small, dense head of off-white, that sticks around. Nose has hints of crystal malt caramel and toasted grain. Solid hop aroma, on the ganja side with resinous bitter notes. Taste is very similar. Weak malt strives for sweetness but comes across toasted and caramelly. Can't quite balance the resinous, bitter hop flavors. Moderate bodied amber/pale ale. Leans toward hops for sure. A nice, UT-constrained hop ale that is a nice session beer for those who like there hops."
"This brew is 4% ABV. Pours a orangy/golden, nice carbonation with a small head. Leaves some lacing around the edges. Scents of hop, malt, and dry fruit. The taste is great as with most UT beers. Light body with a great sweet after taste. Many of these can be had, it's a very nice micro for a UT brew. Would recommend."
"Mouthfeel is the best part of this brew, utterly smooth with the carbonation coming through as a follow-up. Medium body, comes across as heavy."
"Just a little above average, this beer is best as a summer ale. Light in body and color, somewhat sweet at first, then finishes very dry and bitter. Overall, the flavor is average for a beer of this style. This beer goes well with pizza, for instance, but not much else. They say ""you can't beat a dead horse", but I think you can if you wanted to...."
"On-tap at the brewpub: Color is a stained orangish-yellow, clear bodied, thin whitish head and spotty lacing. Smell has a stale malted fruity sense, kinda like dried peaches or apples. Sweet and dry on the nose. Taste is moderately sweet with some fruity tones of dark orange and mild hops giving a nudge of citrus and spice. Feel is shy of medium bodied, closing in on thin with a loose front and lacking in the finish some. A bit bland and plain but refreshing enough I guess."
"This beer pours a hazy very slightly reddish golden wit a large white rocky head and a moderate to thin mouthfeel. The smell was slightly malty/breadlike with a light citrus undertone. The taste was very much like the smell with a light maltiness fading to an increasing hop bitterness. This was overall a very decent amber ale that I enjoyed but probably wouldn't seek out."

"12 fluid oz bottle.  Poured with such a big head that the whole glass was foam.  It took several minutes for the pillowy foam settle down.  From the label:  ""Named after the scenic overlook near Arches National Park.  A traditional english mild ale with a well balanced malt to hop ratio.""  Slight chill haze in the bottle, it looked a bit copper in color.  Being an amber ale, the most obvious taste is the hops bitterness.  Not much taste until after you swallow then the hops kicks in on the tongue.  I don't pick up much on the maltiness promised on the bottle.  I had this on draft at the brewpub and it seemed a bit better.  I had to transport this bottle by car a long distance - maybe the beer suffered.  I pick up a slight sulfur smell.  A bit fresher and  I can see this as a refreshing beer."
"This light amber colored brew presents first with a sweet grassy aroma and a lacy white head.  The brew is quite hoppy on the spice side with the perfect amount of bitterness.  The body is light than many ambers, but with the perfect hop profile this brew comes off as quite refreshing.  ""You can’t beat a Dead Horse."""
