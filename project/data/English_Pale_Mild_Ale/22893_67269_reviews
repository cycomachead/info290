"The Mid Mountain Mile Ale is just that a mild tasty beer that would be perfect with....everything! The Chicken Man who is eventually moving to the land of Utah provided this morsel. The beer poured a hazy copper with foamy head that is leaving a lace. The scent is very faint almost non-descript. The taste is very well balanced between malt and bittering hops. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer that is very sessionable."

"O-This brew won't win any awards, but I would not turn one down if I was in the mood for something simple and drinkable. The mouthfeel is probably the highpoint since the smell and taste are somewhat uninspiring. Criticisms aside, there would be nothing wrong with sharing a few pints of this with friends at a bar."

"Pours a slightly hazy orange with white head and lots of lacing. Nose starts with some dry malts followed by some biscuity character. Some mild hops round it out at the end. Taste is malt forward with very mild flavors. The base grain come through strong with light notes of sweetness which is cut by dry biscuit notes. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, this is an easy drinking brew. Not sure how this is a mild though."

"Overall a tasty ale. On the mild side for sure but it is enjoyable."
"A respectable mild malt beverage. This probably won't appeal to any IPA hop heads, but, then, this isn't the style. Relatively light in character overall but with a pleasing toasted grain and nut character that proves quite satisfying to the taste buds."
"aside from the obvious question of how a mild makes the exponential series, this is a pretty good brew. its not what I expected though, and English mild, this is decidedly American. darker in color too, caramel, medium spectrum, heady and well carbonated. it has more than just light grain, and I appreciate immediately its diversity. there is a touch of smoke, some darker toast, and the delicacy of white wheat, all in great balance. our bottle says 4.5% abv, and it certainly doesn't seem any more than that, very drinkable and soft. not as interesting as some, but the plethora of grains makes it not boring. not sure I could session this long enough to catch a buzz, but I like its richness for the abv, and I like how smooth it finishes, flavorful and everything in good harmony. not a beer that's meant to wow you, epic has plenty of choices for that, but a good hearty mild as they go, and one I wouldn't be opposed to drinking again, especially at about 4 bucks a bomber, very appealing."

"No off flavors so it is easy to drink. Probably pair with a simple salad, no dressing. Not really sessionable, so not an all day beer. Would be a bit boring if it were"

"T: Smooth and malty with light breadiness, some lemon, a bit of grain, watered down honey and some faint grassy hops. I don't have a ton of experience with this style, but this is pretty good. Light and pretty refreshing without being too boring."
""
""
"I'd say it's great to have a mild ale, but so much of the beer in Utah is 4% abv that this is actually a ""heavy"" beer. (Ha!)"
""
"Pours amber with a solid sheet of off white fine foam, great clarity. Nose carries a sweet bread character, some metal, leaves, wood, white grape jelly, and the slightest hint of connecticut leaf tobacco. Flavor is a bit astringent, some cardboard, some loose grain, a bit of oatmeal (plain), some raisin, and a hint of pekoe. Medium bodied with moderate carb and an off dry finish. Nice beer I can appreciate."
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure where I stand on this one. I wouldn't buy it again, but I would recommend it to someone who is new to craft beer. It's basically an average beer but far from being memorable."
"As a fan of Epic, a local in Utah ready for more of their good stuff, this one falls off the list quickly."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice example of an English mild. Good overall balance and malt profile."

"3.5 D: Tasty beer. Not a lot of complexity, but good enough."

"Release #14, 4.8% ABV. Orange-tan color that is cloudy. The head is made up of rather large bubbles. Low hopping rate with a slight earthy aroma and flavor. Quite drinkable with a smooth mouth feel. This is one I will buy again and is the first Mild Ale I have tasted."
"O: Very drinkable and good for what it is. I wouldn't have another, but I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, sessionable, English-style ale."
""
""
"Quite a flavorful session ale. A great example of what a low-ABV beer can be, solid across the board. Very nice, mellow, balanced, and flavorful, without needing to bludgeon you with any of its elements."
""
""
"I don't know much about milds, but it seems like 5% abv is a bit high. This beer also seems a little heavier than I would imagine a mild to be. Nevertheless, this is a very tasty beer and one I would not mind drinking anytime. Recommended."
""
"O: I'd have this one again. It's simple, well crafted, and quite tasty."

"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty subtle with some grain and slight fruity aromas. Taste is also very subtle with grain and some fruity and almost tea-like flavors. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a somewhat flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer in my opinion but it's the first of the style I have had (finally!)."
"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. There is not much which stands out, and this seems too generic to get excited about. I'm glad I tried it, but am not impressed."
"Pours a dark amber color with a one finger off-white head. Good lacing on the side of my snifter. Fairly hazy in appearance. The nose is caramel, floral notes, honey, mild hops, malt. Fairly weak, although pleasant smell to this beer. The taste is completely different than the nose. I get hops, caramel, nuts, and malt. Not bad for the style. Feel is light, with light carbonation and a slightly malty finish. Overall, a decent beer in the style. Cheers."
"OVerall pretty easy drinking, sort of has an English Pale Ale style to it, but quite tasty I must admit."
"I'm not sure why they decided to make a ""mild"" that's 25% higher in alcohol than the Utah draft limit of 4%. ABV Release No. 11, with 5.1% ABV."
""
"A caramel delight. Very smooth and ""mild," which for my palate, is just what the doctor ordered."
""

"Blech. A rare disappointment from Epic, but this has the hallmarks of a bad bottle. Not good."
"D: This is an excellent drinker! All day long, it is quite quaffable."
"D: at 5%ABV this would definitely be on the heavy end of the English Pale Mild category. i have had better milds at lower abv's, which is something signature about this style. however, reviewing it simply as what is in my glass, drinkable, but not worth seeking out."
"Poured into an imperial nonic a hazed coppery color with a very thin almost nonexistent head,aromas are nutty with light sweet biscuit,a lingering toastiness as well.Flavors are of nutty malt with some caramel/biscuit,the hops as expected are light giving off a light herbal note in the finish.Not bad for what it is,not quite as sweet as a traditional mild wich is fine with me."
"Bottle. Not sure I’d consider 5% a mild but here goes. Poured into a Surly pint glass a clear golden color with a white thick head. Clean, light biscuit flavor in the nose with a touch of sweetness. Semi clean taste with some fruit flavors and a touch of what I can only describe as a plastic taste. Ends crisply. Decently easy drinking. Medium mouthfeel. Ex the plastic note, this wasn’t too bad."
"Hazy orange color with no head or lacing. Aroma is light mix of pale malts, a touch of caramel and and very light, citrusy hoppiness, but almost non-existent. Taste is right on with the nose. Bready malts, light caramel, light graininess, but overall smooth and easy to drink. Completely non-offensive in any way. Just a good drinking, pale beer. Medium body, light carbonation. Not bad at all! My first beer from Utah. If this were canned and priced at around $6.99 for a sixer, I would drink it all the time."
"My first Epic brew.... I will be on the look out for these guys.."
"Notes: This beer has some body to it and has a well-balanced flavor profile. Quite tasty overall. This reminds me more of an English pale mild as far as the style goes. Easy to drink, and quite sessionable."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange-amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, vanilla, and a hint of honey. This isn't the strongest aroma out there in a beer, but it does have really good complexity. The taste is similar to the aroma with a lot of vanilla and toffee, and hints of caramel and honey. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really good mild ale that I would gladly session."
