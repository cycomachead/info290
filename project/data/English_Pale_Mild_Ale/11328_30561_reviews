review_text
"Mild, balanced between malt and hops, though the latter are pretty tame. Very traditional Kentish ale that you could knock back."
"the esters and diacetyl might get in the way of all-night drinkability however"
"Mouthfeel is silky, hint of a tickle at the front of the tongue, fluffy in back."
"Pours a hazed orange/amber. Nice creme head. Nose is citric hops. Flavor is mild with some hop characteristics there and a definite bitterness. Definitely on the earthy side. Somewhat of a grassy aftertaste. Feel is about standard. It's nice, yes. The obliterated American palate might not appreciate it so much, but it's pretty decent."
"M&D: lightly carbonated and very light-bodied, this pale mild is, IMHO, the best I've tried, even better than the Timothy Taylor's Golden Best (which is tasted far away from Yorkshire, so no competition here actually)~~ What a pale mild... it'd surprise you if this beer style had never occured in your mind."
