"O: Solid and easy drinking. While just about everyone else is doing the Naughty or a Shower or Tickles, do yourself a style expanding favor and try this."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, tea, and citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and tea flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite mild but tasty."

"Fair beer on its own. As a starter English ale for those looking to jump into that world, I think there's too much American influence to make it an authentic starting point."
