"O - Awesome beer, could drink lots of pints of this. I really like this way of balancing a malty beer, though maybe the bitterness is just slightly too much for me. Great as a session ale."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable. It would make for a really nice choice for someone who doesn't like bitterness."
""

"Overall, a light session ale, without noticeable flaws, quite good balance, but a bit simple and on the sweet side."
""
""
"Overall a great winning mild, super drinkable too. Want a fresh one!"
""
"Overall: actually a pretty decent beer. A hair on the sweet side, especially in the aroma, but generally quite good."
""
""
"Overall, ok. Not a favorite, but not hated either."
"O - Mild but with an array of pleasant flavours. Top quality English ale at just 4.1% abv."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation and a slightly bitter aftertaste. I am glad I tried this."
"This is a pretty good beer. The brewery did a good job in making this one."
"I now know what is meant by a ""mild"". You get all the flavor of the floral hops without much by the way of IBUs. It's also low on the ABV scale. This one was really nice in the fact that, although there wasn't a lot of bitterness, it didn't become cloyingly sweet. Nicely balanced."
"O: This beer reminds me of the real ales I drink when I get the chance to travel to the UK (mostly for business and it has been almost a year now). I find this to be very easy to drink, sessionable, and really enjoyable."

"Pours a slightly cloudy light amber color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly but covers the glass in a fair amount of sticky lace. Smells malty bready with a hint of butterscotch and nail polish. Sweet dark pitted fruit and a hint of toffee round out the nose quite well. Taste is sweet and malty with a bit of bread and toffee up front. Lots of butterscotch coated berries and cherries in here. Slightly earthy hop barely cuts through malty sweetness. Surprising fullness of body for such a small abv. Moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost oily mouthfeel. Not to shabby of a beer, if it were a bit easier to obtain I might have one periodically."

"Mouthfeel is crisp but a bit light. Overall this would be a grea session beer - light alcohol content but big time aroma and flavor. If this was available here, I would love to try it on-tap or on cask for a session.."
"Solid beer"
"O - Yes, it would be a good session ale if you wanted to put back a few beers. Would I want to drink a ton of this though? Not really. Fair, but certainly not the fairest in the land."
"Pours a nice golden color with a single-finger white head and some good lacing on the way down. The nose brings a bit of diacetyl and toffee as well as some notes of grain and a bit of some floral hops. The taste is light bread and a bit of toffee. Diacetyl there but not as much as with the nose. Not too, too much for the style. The body is light with moderate carbonation. Not bad. Too much diacetyl for my taste, though it was an acceptable level. Decent enough."
"The beer is transparent and yellow hued, with a thin, white cap. The aroma is floral, with a hint of lemon zest. The flavor brings a light, floral hop character, as well as a bready, biscuit taste. The feel is thin and light bodied, and finishes slightly dry with a hint of bitterness. I found this to be enjoyable and very drinkable. I could throw back a few pints of this."
"Beer is thin (I guess that's to be expected) and has a late grainy bitterness, the mid-palate is almost like butter toffee or some thin caramel. Carbonation is minimal in the mouth but overall it is fine. I've actually had better English Pale Mild Ales before, definitely not my favorite and I'd probably pass on it in the future."
"O: Well session beers aren't really my thing but this one would certainly fit the bill."
"The flavor is nice compared to the smell. It is grainy with an herbal hop favor that lingers on the tongue int eh aftertaste. It isn't amazing, but for being subtle it is nice."
"D: Quite a nice beer. Very drinkable; sweet-bitter. Not recommended, but you'll probably enjoy it."
"The CPJ"
"An interesting style that is sessionable. Kind of surprised there aren't more examples. Glad to have tried it."
"Overall an interesting beer and one that is somewhat harder to judge as it's so different from what else is generally available in the U.S. It's a rare style but one I would like to try again."
"D: This was a very easy beer to drink. The low Abv makes it a great session beer that you won't get sick of."
"D: At 4.1%abv hard to argue about having more. Alcohol is easy enough to manage, and packs quite a bit of flavor, depth and maltiness in a modest package worth checking out. interesting."
"Good fruit but too sour. Don't know where the Cascade is. Has that lactic thing that some hoppy English ales get - Perle hops? Malts? Anyway, a bit underwhelming."
"A light gold coloured beer with a significant slightly offwhite head. The nose is fruity with hints of cherry and raisin. An indistinct creamy and vaguely sweet start gives way rapidly to dry herbal hop domination. Too dry to be a session beer for me."
"D - This is highly drinkable. The only thing that would preclude it being a regular session beer is the price (and unknown freshness). If it were cheap and on cask at my local pub I'd get it regularly."
"I am glad I got to try this beer since it was the last style I needed, but I wish the beer would have not had so many flaws. Maybe I will get to try it again, since I assume this is not what the brewer intended."
"Poured into a imperial nonic lemon sunshine color,just a hintof orange to the lemon hued body,a fluffy but quick to fade white head atop.Amix of biscuit and juicy fruity malt with a bit of earth and lemony hop.Malt tilted with biscuit and toffee malt flavors,a real nice fresh squeezed lemon note emerges to make it more vibrant on palate, still the hops are subdued.This would be great on cask for sure,its sociable,and not as ""modest"" as most for the style in my mind."
"Pours a fairly pale golden copper color with some nice head and nice lacing. Very clean aroma; crisp and slightly malty with a very distinct English hop overtone (Fuggles perhaps?). Wonderful taste, a very nice malty body (not huge, but at just over 4%, it's great) with a very nice hop taste at the end (and in the aftertaste). It goes down quite well. Not necessarily a thirst quencher with the higher hops to malt ratio, but still a great brew! I enjoyed it completely."
"American brewers need to take note from this. A huge flavor, but very low alcohol. This is a wonderful cask offering. Highly recommended."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a light haze and a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of floral cereal with light dry hops is mildly enjoyable. Taste is refreshing and easily quaffable with notes of cereal with light residual sweetness and some floral undertones. Body is slightly more full then average with good carbonation. Limited character but refreshing notes makes this an enjoyable session beer."
"Simple, but very drinkable ale."
"contrasts greatly with the deep and dark Lia Fail from the same brewery. This is all light and breezy with a summer feel to the mouthfeel and the wheaty taste to the finish. I really enjoyed this beer as a golden ale low in ABV but with plenty of flavour"
"Mouth feel wise, it's prickly with carbonation all the way through, but not coarse at all. There is a slippery/oily presence here too. Altogether, this is an exceptional session brew."
"It is lively, light but firm in feel and not remotely thin or watery."
" Lovely full-flavoured English pale ale. One of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. If I didn't have things to do the next day, I would ahve had a few more."
"Edit: I see this has been reclassified as an English Pale Mild Ale...that works for me! Good job."
"NOTE: this was best on the first day. seemed to sour easily on the second day."
"D, notes: Great session ale that could be put away all night. Despite the fact that this beer is brewed in Scotland I don't think that it has nearly enough malt character to fall in the Scottish ale category. It strikes me more as a mild or a pale ale. Good stuff nonetheless."
"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Body is a slightly hazy golden color, topped by a good finger's worth of fluffy, bright white head. Not much in the way of aroma - a bit of sweet, bready malt and a hint of spicy floral hops. Palate is much more interesting, a very tasty blend of bready malt and spicy Saaz hops. Notes of grapefruit and white pepper are present, with a mild tartness on the finish. Body is smooth and a little creamy, very nice for the style. Finish is rather interesting, as it is a bit dry. This is a highly drinkable ale, and with its low alcohol content would be an excellent session beer. If not for the pricetag (above $4/bottle), I might drink it every day."
"Drinkability/notes: Overall, seems a rather weak example of a distinguished style."
"Tingly, but not gaseous, overcarbonated. Drinkable, but leaves an odd aftertaste at times."
"This proved to be a nice surprise, I had never heard of the brewery before supping this very pleasant pint. I would definately sample this again, should I come accross it."
"M&D: so lively, 3D structured, and the mouthfeel is soft as well as refreshing... tasting just great fresh on cask!"
"Everyone else seems to like this, but it's not for me. It's all lemons and hardly anything else."
"decent, but wouldnt buy again."
"Decent session type beer. Complex enough to be interesting but not overly strong or challenging."
"A pretty decent ale, i'd probably have it again"
"Overall Impression: Just rubbed me wrong. Hops werent enough to hold my interest and too tea like, malt was ok but the peat note just didnt meld, and the floaties were a deal breaker."
"Pulled from the cask at Monk's. Hazy sunrise golden color with a thick, must-be-cask fluffy white head. Floral hops are easy to detect in the nose, along with damp, earthy grassy hay. Quite pleasant. Smooth and coating on the palate. Hops are faint in the flavor but yield a chalky bitterness throughout, balanced by malty wheat flavors and subtle citrus. An absolutely stellar session beer, and a delight from the cask."
"On-Cask at Monks. Moderate khaki with a pristingepillowy top of white foam. Aromas are bready/biscuity malts, a hint of toast and nuts (walnut?) as well as some fresh citrusy hops in the finish. Quite dry, but juicy in the middle and brilliantly thirst quenching. Makes me miss Scotland and all of the times I drank this for $3.50a 20oz, as opposed to like $7 for a 16oz. Oh well..."
"I'm inclined to give this one another spin. Hoping that Inveralmond just had a slightly inconsistent output one particular week. As it is, well put together, but kinda unspectacular."
"Ossian Ale is a first-class Scottish ale. Plenty of brewers brag on their labels about medals received at various competitions over the years, but few of those beers actually taste like they deserve the accolades. This one proudly displays the likeness of a gold medal and the words 'Champion Beer of Scotland' on the neck label. I believe it."
"Highly Recommended from the Cask."
"Received it in a beers of the world pack. Pours a light amber, moderately clear and with good head and lacing. Smells like citrusy hops and dried fruits. Taste was kind of smokey, peaty some grapefruit and a little hop presence. Mouthfeel was full and creamy, very nice beer, I'd definately try this one again."
"Pours a one-finger white head that goes quickly leaving no lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slightly sweet malty nose. Starts sweetish, hops are there at finish but hardly over powering. $1.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Scotch aroma. Cloudy pale orange appearance with lace. Little head. Tasty scotch, touch of smoke, significant malty some hop,grassy dry finish. All together a nice fireplace beer, with understated characteristics that worked together. Medium mouthfeel, smooth drink. Above average beer."
"Bottled (thanks Viggo) Pour reveals a lightly hazed honey-gold ale with a smallish cap and light carbonation. The aroma of this ale is one of the best noses I've experienced in an ale: fruity, pears with musty citrus and a wisp of smoke. Medium body sweet malt and the teast-hop mix leave a lightly smoked pear cider taste...mild melloe and tastey...wet finish...a very nice scottish ale."
"Pours a light bronze/orange color, small creamy off-white head, just a 1/4"". Smell is of carmel and light grassy malts, with a light floral hoppiness. Taste is very smooth and creamy. Starts relatively bland, but the sharp maltiness, and fine hop level make their presence felt. Perfect level of carbonation, and good drinkablity with no offensive flavors."
"Drinkability  This was a raw Scottish Ale that I really enjoyed but that most people would have to get used to."
"Poured amber with a half inch of creamy head which disappated fairly quickly. Aroma was malty with a nice hop presence. The taste was a sweet biscuity malt with a lingering hoppy finish. Quite a pleasing beer on cask, I shall make the trek out to Perth to check out Inveralmond's other offerings."
"Not a bad brew..but a bit lacking on the mouthfeel for such a low abv. Poured a nice amber with a good chunky head. Smell was malty with a diacetyl presence. Taste was strongly malty on the front palalte with a lightly bitter quality on the finish. This didn't have a great mouthfeel, not overly smooth. Likewise, drinkability was ok, but only if you sip."
"The beer pours a translucent dark gold color with a frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It is pale, but has a real nice malty scent with a bit of hop aroma to boot. The taste is great. It goes down smooth with a light malty finish that refreshes with flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks well. It has good flavor and is light enough to throw down a few; a good sessions ale."
"Being anything but a fan of Pale Ales, I found this beer enchanting! The color was liquid gold, little head with dainty lace left behind. The taste was subtle and seductive and made me pout that I'd actually shared the sample bottle with my husband. It is lightly carbonated yet gives quite a tickle to the tongue. Slight malty and bitter aftertaste. I'm intrigued and look forwarding to sampling again!"
"Ossian Ale: A Scottish Pale Ale. Pours a fairly deep brown, not much head, but what head it had clings to the side of the glass. Perfectly clear, and it is notable that the minimal carbonation floats fairly slowly through this brew. The aroma is pleasant, an almost peat like aroma of malts, with a wee bit of flowery hops. The taste is nice, fairly earthy and grainy sweetness, with a smoky blast of hops toward the finish. Nice smooth and rich mouthfeel, not too much carbonation. Not too bad, worth picking it up if you see it."
"Another delicious sampling from NERAX 2003. Copper with an orange hue and bubbly head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is faint, but with some deep whiffs, pleasing hoppy, fruity and tea-like scents are detected. The biscuity malt is lightly sweet and very smooth. Fruity flavors and citrusy hops mix well with the malt and woody flavors. Somewhat flat in a good Cask-conditioned way."
"First thing that hit me was the nutty aroma from my glass.  Deep orange in color with a white head.  Flavor profile was dominated by nuts and fruit with an underlying sweeteness that carries into the finish.  Finish had only a hint of hops, but not too much for the style.  Very light bodied and enjoyable."
"Right now it is August of 2002 and the bottle had a best before date of August of 2003. The one I got was really fresh and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Matt give it another chance and make sure and check the date."
