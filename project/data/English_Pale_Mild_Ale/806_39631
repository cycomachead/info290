All Brakspear's copper tanks were moved over to the Wychwood Brewery to maintain the same process and flavour. Apparently the yeast dates back to 1776? A unique old school ale.","Mountainmanbrewing","Aug 25, 2013"

Seems a tad watery to start, until the hops kick in. Then a very pleasant, slightly oily feeling lemony bitterness with an accompanying nutty (perahps hazelnut) element. The first time I consumed a bottle of this I was under the impression that I was drinking brakspear Bitter and wondered what had gone wrong, but it has definitely grown on me after a few bottles over the last couple of years.","charlatan","Jun 03, 2013"

3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"There is a tang and pungency to the taste, bitter with an easy mixed fruit feel to it. No trace of any malt in the flavour, but it was sharp, refreshing and invigorating, a good beer for a hot day or night.","BlackHaddock","May 03, 2009"
3.78,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Being in this weight class offers major sessionability. It's admittedly not a style I am well-versed in but it's an easy pour and a solid foundation.","IBUnit63","Feb 27, 2009"
3.5,-3.3,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Overall, quite a nice EPMA. The taste is indicated in the style; "mild". This brew still has a nice complexity to it, it just seems that everything is toned down. Can easily make a nice lawnmower beer but at over $4.00 a bottle, I'm not sure I'll be turning to this again any time soon.","ludachris","Jan 31, 2009"
3.61,-0.3,5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Final Thoughts - As many people have commented, this would be a great session ale. It's different then the usual, has a low alcohol content and does have an interesting influx of flavors going for it. Also, being able to cleanse my pallet of the aftertaste is welcome.","TheHammer","Jan 24, 2009"
3.63,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Very refreshing, nice biscuity malts, nice and sweet body that finishes slightly bitter. This would be a perfect beer on a hot summer day.","GodOfBeer","Jan 20, 2009"
3.48,-3.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Seems to be fairly true to style based on my limited knowledge. Certainly a session ale, although the sulfur is something im not particularly accustomed to or overly fond of at this point. It would be better suited to summer than the depth of winter. The logic of the LCBO escapes me. Welll worth trying, hopefully this comes back to Ontario come summer.","demcorhip","Dec 29, 2008"
3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Best before June 25/09. Honey-gold, momentary white head flattens to a wispy film with a solid ring and some lacing. Steady small bubble slow moving carbonation. Aroma of honey dew, lime, citrus. There is a muted tartness that's well controlled, green melon, clean, crisp, dry, bitter ... all within a honey backdrop that happily lacks the associated sweetness. Refreshing bitterness has a nice understated malty finish, again nicely balanced and pleasant. This beer reminded me of what a Corona would like to be. It would make a fine summer sessional at 4.6 per cent ABV, not overly serious but the combination of Target and Goldings hops and organic breeding work out rather well in this instance, I thought highly of this beer considering the style.","ThatWineGuy","Dec 25, 2008"
3.46,-4.4,4,3,3,4,4.5,"Pours a clear amber, some gold highlights, thin white head forms, quickly begins to settles down to a thin ring, a few lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is neat, very malty, raw honey, some caramel, biscuits, light bit of floral, some fruit, not a whole lot going on but I do like the honey character. Taste is similar, a bit watery on the flavour, but a real nice honey character, some toast, light floral hoppiness, touch of jasmine, very light spicy bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to low carbonation. Easy drinker, nothing complex, but I could see myself putting down a few of these in an evening.","Viggo","Dec 22, 2008"
3.63,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A decent light ale with nuance and balance. It could be more robust without entering the English bitter or pale ale realm.","CAMRAhardliner","Dec 14, 2008"

3.35,-7.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"M&D: light-bodied, slightly yeasty but overall quite fresh for a cask ale. Brakspear's yeastiness certainly leaves a deep imprint in the overall flavour profile, rendering a lightly dryish touch throughout the drink. Solid!","wl0307","Feb 28, 2008"
