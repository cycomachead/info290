"O- Pretty representative of the style and decently tasty.  I just hope that they have their bottle conditioning under control for the beers that are being sold on the shelf."
"Overall I really enjoy this beer. The carbonation needs to be toned down a bit and I think more English malts need to be used. The balance can be tweaked a bit giving it a smoother, sweeter finish that traditional English milds have."
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, amber-copper coloring, with a ton of carbonation throughout the body, and a low profile, fluffy, bubbly, off-white head. Aromas of tangy caramel and roasted toffee forward, with some sugary sweet highlights and woody notes. Aromas are a bit muted. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a blast of rich, tangy sweet toffee, bordering on sugary, with some darker caramel undertones. Subtle roast and bitterness in the tail end, but overall cloyingly sweet. The body is light and somewhat effervesced by the steady flow of carbonation. The aftertaste is more of the roasted and rich characteristics that have been present throughout. The finish is light, a bit crisp, and the sweet characteristics do hang out quite a bit."

"I havent't had a Mystery brew in awhile so I figured this mild would go well on a cold rainy afternoon at home today.Poured into an impy nonic a burnt orange tinged copper color with a large blooming head wich wasnt expected,maybe a bit over carbonated wich shows up more in the feel,nice color though.Aromas are alittle yeasty with some brown sugar and caramel standing out,the yeast seems to be a little heavy handed here.The carbonation makes for some prickly feeling in the mouth and for some burps right away after swallowing.Flavors are pretty good for the style with some caramel toffee flavors and earthy hops that do stand out wich is nice,again the yeastiness is a little heavy handed.Not bad but it seems a little outta whack for the style,for the record I think Mystery makes some really good stuff but this needs some tweaking...in my opinion."
