1.16,0,,,,,,"This was a wild card buy because it was on the cheap, nothing really to be excited about here... quite the opposite to be honest. Very similar to Stella Artois; a skunky, light and horrible taste. The skunkyness was really the defining factor, I would be interested to see if it held up any better away from the clear bottle and would certainly consider a half pint on tap otherwise I doubt I will be drinking this again - generally I would say of even bad drinks that I would take it over a standard beer like stella but in this instance its so similar to stella, if it was the choice between the two I would probably just opt for a case of stella as opposed to a similar number of these and save a few quid.","WeissGary","Jan 13, 2012"

3.03,0,,,,,,"A fairly average ale - unexciting. Nothing horrible, but little to stimulate the senses. Body is also pretty thin. I probably won't bother with this again - there are more exciting options out there.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 28, 2010"

3.72,0,,,,,,"Doesn't really seem to fit the English pale mild ale but on the other hand it certainly isn't what I would have expected from a beer describing itself as gold. All that said, I really like this very refreshing number.","charlatan","Beers"
