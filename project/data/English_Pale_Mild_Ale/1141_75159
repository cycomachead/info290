3.84,-2,4.5,3.5,3.75,4.25,4,"Starts like a blonde ale but soon succumbs to a darker, dry malt and a bitter hop. Dry finish that lingers lightly for a long time. Rich body with a normal level of carbonation.","smcolw","May 30, 2012"

3.93,0.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from cask into pint at the Brewpub in Montreal. Pours a creamy brown amber with thick white creamy head. Smells of sweet malts and a small bit of fruit. Taste is very similar to aroma...sweet and malty but crisp and a bit of fruity hop. Very drinkable and smooth. Low ABV and very easy to drink, plus its tastey. Nice afternoon brew :)","DrinkSlurm","Nov 11, 2011"
