3.94,0,,,,,,"Very right pour, clear reddish brown hue with a off white head that does not waver. Nutty, toasty, bready aroma and flavor. Very easy drinking at 3.7% but a whole lot more flavor compared to what most brewers are pushing out during this session beer craze. Hats off to 2nd Story for brewing a true session ale and keeping it pretty authentic.","Jason","Jan 12, 2015"
