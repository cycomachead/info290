"Inoffensive but bland. Nothing technically wrong with it but pretty characterless. Easy-drinking; I guess it could work when you just want to quench a thirst. No need to seek this one out."

"Yeah, mild, sessionable. A decent cleanser. Not a huge fan but it's a good simple brew."
"I think it's a pretty decent and easy drinking English Ale. It doesn't have a huge amount of character, but it is indeed very smooth, balanced and clean."
"Pours amber in color beer with smooth creamy head. Some laces. Weak hop aroma, weak watery taste with tints of caramel, hideous ale, I'm a bit disturbed of this one."
