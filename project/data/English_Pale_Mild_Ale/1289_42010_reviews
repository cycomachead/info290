"Appearance is a light brown/dark amber, not exactly pale, but whatever. There a little foam around the edges. The aroma of herbal caramel, with sweet candy-like British yeast character. That same candy comes off in the flavor along with subtle biscuit notes. There might be a touch of diacetyl, but it's nice and goes well with the Ringwood-like yeast. A tasty session ale overall. Worth a try."
"Overall- really impressed me for a mild. Big flavor and a good session beer. I'll be enjoying this 1 hopefully for the next few weeks!"
"This Mild Ale poured a golden amber color with a decent 1/2 inch head of white foam. It had OK retention that left behind a handful of white rings, one big white bubbly island, and a few spots of lace around the glass. Faint to light aroma of malted wheat, a hint of milk chocolate, and a splash of coffee. All of these aroma were in front of a lightly sour background. There wasn't much to the taste. The few things I could detect were small in size. What I could detect was sour malted wheat, coffee, bitter hops, and a quick splash of chocolate in the end. The mouthfeel was light with a heavy dose of carbonation to it. There was that and it had a faint lightly sour aftertaste of wheat, bitter hops, and a pinch of chocoalte. Not a bad beer, but not the best Ship Inn has to offer. It was average all the way."
