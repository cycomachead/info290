"Not a bad beer by any means."

"I am a sucker for English mild ales. This one wasnâ€™t one of the best, but still a good brew."
"D: The best Maltese beer I've tried (for what that's worth). Most drinkable. I recommend a half-litre in the Hole in the Wall Pub."
"O- Fantastic session beer. Perfect English character, malty but not sweet, hoppy but not bitter, satifying yet quaffable."
"As far as I know this brewery is the only one in the Med that brews ales, and long may it do so. It is also one of the reasons I've been on holiday to Malta four times!"
"Pleasant and drinkable."
"Overall it is a very mediocre mild but one that is eminently drinkable and something that you can throw back quite a few of. In the heat that Malta can get, a cold lager is probably more refreshing but if you are an ale fan then this one is a good choice."
"Not one I'd be inclined to have again."
