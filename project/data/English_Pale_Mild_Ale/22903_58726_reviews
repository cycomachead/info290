"the style is what the style is, this has more character than your big box lagers (the you know whos) and is a nice drinkable ale. Is it a world beater ? no, of course not but it does what it sets out to do, a good brew for those who can't grab an english export to experience the genesis of the style."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, grains, a bit bready. Taste is light and mild, some breadyness and malts, not a very strong flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."

"o - honestly this tastes exactly like beers I've screwed up and infected. I want to like this local brewery but after reading other reviews and trying this first hand I think they have a few things to work out before I buy another from them."
"O- A decent Pale Mild. Nothing outstanding, but then again there's nothing horribly wrong with it either. Bottom-line: Unless you're a diehard fan of the style or someone who has to try every beer in existence, you can getaway with skipping this one. Cheers."

"Body is medium to slightly light; carbonation is on the high side and feels a little fizzy. Overall there's nothing particularly remarkable about this beer; its pretty drinkable but a bit bland and the aftertaste is a little odd. Theres a faint suggestion of soured milk and overripe fruit throwing things off. The mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired as well."

"This was my first try for something from Boxcar in West Chester. Overall it tasted closer to a wheat or blonde or mile Pale Ale than an APA. A re-classification for this might be due as the APA made me believe there would be at least some hop kick, which wasnt there. Decent taste, easy to drink. Good session beer for summer and I look forward to trying their IPA."
"O - Really more like a British pale mild or American blonde. Either way, it just seems to lack depth that's seen in some of the better APA's out there. I want to like this brewery so bad since they're so local to me, but so far its just not working out."
" The taste is ok, but is grassy as the aroma indicates, the malt is light in the flavor, maybe a bit of toast, but gently bitter grass and herbal notes override the grainy taste. The finish is dry and overall I thought it was unique, but not the tastiest pale or mild ale I have had."
"Cheers!"
"Ordered simply because it was a new tap handle i have never seen... poured a hazed pale yellow color with minimal head, assumed it was a belgian wit. Scent was very light with touches of yeast and lemon, lightly sweet bubblegum presence, again assumed it was just a light wit beer. Taste was extremely light with only a faint taste of yeast and lemon, convinced it was a light wit beer. Medium bodied, lightly oily, undercarbonated. When all was said and done and i was left extremely disapointed in my wit beer, i popped on BA on my mobile and saw this was a pale ale... then I was pretty much over the disapointment and borderline angry (j/k)."
"Original is a proper term for this beer as it is a pale ale that looks like a mix between a hazy hefe and a light fruit beer. The color is hazy yellow with some oranges and reds mixed in underneath a georgeous white/pinkish head that sticks to the glass like flies on shit. This smells awfully sweet for a pale ale. I thought this was a fruit beer or something. A Belgian type nose with some bubblegum, cherry and some pale malting. I dig it. And this does not taste like a pale ale either but it is very enjoyable and drinkable. Taste is of some wheat with fruits such as cherry and slight citrus qualities underneath some pale malts. Slight caramel vibe that just works for some odd reason. Feels bigger than it is(5%) but remains a bit bigger than light bodied with expert carb rolling off the tounge. I was pleasantly surprised with this one and would purchase again and again."
"Appearance is interesting, had to double check that this was an APA and not a hefe or pale wheat. Pours an unfiltered, hazed banana golden color with a foamy white head with surprising retention and lack of lacing. Aroma is mild and sweet, notes of butterscotch, grapefruit, caramel and a slight alcohol bite. Medium bodied with strong, fine carbonation and a sloppy and stale finish. Unsurprisingly, like the rest of the presentation, the flavor continues to have a bit of an identity crisis, veering at times from APA to wheat beer to kolsch to who knows what. Oddly, I do enjoy drinking this, even if it drinks much bigger and stronger than its 5% ABV. The flavor is sweet without being cloying, dominated by sweet, ripe fruits, butterscotch, pale malt, mild tanginess, etc. Hard to pinpoint any particular off flavor, but the overall impression of this is that this beer is a work in progress."
"Quite drinkable but there's something unfinished about it."
"d- this is a really nice, easy drinking apa that i'll be drinking again. also, you've gotta love an up and coming brewery from my hometown of west chester! i had the opportunity to meet the owner/brewer who was a great, very knowledgable guy!"
"Its always nice to have great beer options so close to home, welcome Boxcar Brewing."
