3.85,0,,,,,,"Got this tasty brew as a gift from visiting Englishman Vinnie. Thanks man! Poured with a nice head that mostly faded and some lace. Clear gold color. Fresh hop character in nose and flavor. Well balanced. Light body. Nice finish. Definitely a session beer. Similar in some ways to an american pale ale.","drpimento","Beers"
