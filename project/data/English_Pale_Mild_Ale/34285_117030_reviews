"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, English hops, hint of caramel malt, and slight metallic. Fits the style of an English Pale Mild. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, slight caramel malt, hint of earthy malt, hint of hop, and a hint of metallic. If the metallic aroma and body is disregarded, this is a decent mild, alas the metallic is too noticeable."
"O - This is one of many fantastic brews that Logboat is going to produce. So sessionable. I can't wait to have cans of it sitting in my fridge."
