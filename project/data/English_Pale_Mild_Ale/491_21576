2.15,-29.3,2.5,2.5,2,2,2,"At first I thought, not really bad, but also not very traditional. Then it started downhill. First thing I noticed was the color being quite light. It did have some noticeable hops, but not much malt - very thin. Unbalanced beer. There's significant long lasting carbonic tang. Not much in the aroma department either. Now that I'm done with this review, the brew gets dumped.","drpimento","Nov 09, 2013"
2.82,-7.2,2.5,3,2.75,3,2.75,"Overall: tastes somewhat like a lighter / lower ABV version of the Coopers flagship Pale Ale and Sparkling Ale. The only problem with that is that it lacks any kind of individuality, and just leaves me thinking 'Why not just get a Pale Ale?" If I was getting a semi-craft lower ABV beer, I'd just get a Little Creatures' Rogers beer.","SmashPants","Aug 29, 2013"

2.97,-2.3,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Overall, not unexpectedly, it has the generic Coopers characters toned down from, say, the Pale or the Sparkling ale. It ends up being not particularly exciting or interesting as a result. But for a sub 4% beer, this is one of your best bets in Australia.","lacqueredmouse","0"

3.22,5.9,3,3.5,3.5,2,3,"Food match: In fact I'm going to recommend the exact same food I recommended for the pale ale; Grilled chicken or fish with a light salad drizzled with balsamic vinegar, maybe calamari or other seafood (crab, lobster).","doktorhops","Oct 29, 2010"

3.42,12.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a golden colour with a bubbly head that disappeared right before my eyes. Is quite cloudy with some sediment. Smells yeasty and sweet and has a sweet flavour with a small bite at the end. Quite fizzy and is a bit fizzier than I'm used to. Mouthfeel is light and easy. I could drink quite a few of these in quick succession.","madvoice","Sep 04, 2007"
3.5,15.1,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Surprised that I'm scoring it this high, as from memory, this is not as good as their Pale Ale, which I gave a lower score. Still, it's impressive for a midstrength, and easier drinking than most the the Coopers offerings. Not huge on flavour, but quite refreshing. Decent value and good quality, not something I'd drink often though.","LittleCreature","Dec 07, 2006"
3.25,6.9,3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"D - There are many better beers out there but I challenge anyone to find me an Australian brewed 3.5% beer thats anywhere close to this one. A decent drop if you have to drive but want a beer.","brendan13","Jun 13, 2006"
3.03,-0.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Drinability - Easy to drink lacks flavour however. Probably one of the best mild ales in aus.","Finite","May 20, 2006"
3.16,3.9,2,3.5,3.5,2,3,"Pours a golden straw color with no head, even after pouring into the middle of the glass. Smells somewhat hoppy, some citrus, a hint woody. The taste is pretty thin, not much sweetness to speak of. It does have a clean finish, but not too much bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and watery. All in all, it's fairly drinkable, only because it doesn't have any overpowering flavors. Might be good on a hot day.","Kulrak","Jan 27, 2006"
2.13,-29.9,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"Poured an odd cloudy orange color, not particularly appealing looking. Smell was salty, with a slight earthy tense. Taste was pretty grainy with, some maltyness towards the end. Mouthfeel was watery and unimpressive. I was very close to pouring this one out, so drinkability I'm not too crazy about with this beer. Probably the worst beer that I have sampled from Coopers brewery. It just seemed boring and frightfully uninspired. I would avoid this one. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 02, 2005"

3.5,15.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bitterness levels are low but lower malt profile makes it acceptable. There is malt in there on the palate, but low, which is fitting for style. On the whole I think it's an acceptable beer for a thirsty palate and I would gladly drink it when seeking a low alcohol alternative.","goodbyesoberday","Mar 18, 2005"
2.78,-8.6,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Fairly drinkable. Inoffensive. Not very strong in flavour, but it tastes fresh.","dwarbi","Feb 26, 2005"
2.35,-22.7,2.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"well, a bit underwhelming, and i dont think i was expecting too much from it. they have better brews than this at coopers.","joecast","Jan 14, 2005"
2.76,-9.2,2,3.5,2.5,2,3,"As soon as I poured this I was disappointed. After a hard day's work the enjoyment of any beer is enhanced, yet this one is upsettingly average for a Cooper's ale. The head seemed not to form correctly while pouring, so there was an excess of effervescence and a consequent lack of head retention. There is noticeably less yeast suspended in the beer than most Cooper's ales, which is one thing I love about the brewery. It is fairly mild, but I just noticed some faint but pleasing roast coffee characteristics. Overall, I hoped this would be better, it's not bad but it's not great. I'll give it another go one day in case it was a slightly infected brew (explaining the flatness) but maybe I just prefer a meatier Cooper's.","Weizenmensch","Beers"
2.55,-16.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Well, it seems overall this is a pretty lackluster effort by Coopers. However, this is still better than any commercial light/mid strength out there (still tastes cooperish!) but I would head for the Rogers or Moonlight before this one.","koolk","0"
