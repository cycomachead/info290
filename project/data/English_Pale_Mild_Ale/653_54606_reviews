"My first and only stab at the Pale Mild style, I wasn't super impressed with this one."

"O: I think this is probably a style that I’d like, especially in summer. It’s not a popular style in the US, so maybe I’ll try brewing one of my own sometime. It’s brewed locally, so I’ll keep an eye out for it on draft."
"The chalkboard at the brewpub said English Strong Ale,but I dont think it was that,I would say its in the right category.Came to the table in a standard pint glass a dull medium golden with a thinner white head atop,aromas mainly consisted of biscuit malt and light fruitiness.Caramel toffee flavors stood out most on the palate,a firm biscuit malt base was the main component of the beer,very light herbal hops in the finish.Not bad for the style,would like to have on cask to magnify the subtle flavors of the beer."
"Notes: This beer just works well with its simplicity and balance making for a very enjoyable beer."
"""Next Door Ale"" is the house beer for the soon-to-open Next Door Bar & Grill in Pittsford. It's a very clear, golden ale with a small white ring of a head. It has a faint, malty, pretzely aroma that's slightly sweet. It's medium-light bodied and the finish is clean. There's plenty of flavor-- more than I expected after smelling it. It's well balanced with a pretzely malt and a grassy, herbal, perhaps minty, bitterness. It's a session ale. It's almost like an ale version of a Dortmunder. It's clearly a hybrid of some sort, but not a Koelsch and not a California Common."
