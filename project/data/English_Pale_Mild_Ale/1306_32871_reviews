"Quite nice; a crisp floral taste that would go down well on a hot day. Some other Badger beers that I've tried have been disappointingly flawed. Worth sampling."
"Overall: Pleasant to drink and packs a nice flavor."
"A standard drinkable beer, but I prefer Golden Glory."
"This one goes down easy, and with the low ABV makes for a very drinkable beer. Highly enjoyed."
"All in all, not a bad beer. I would like to try it on cask if it is in fact sold that way."
"Got this tasty brew as a gift from visiting Englishman Vinnie. Thanks man! Poured with a nice head that mostly faded and some lace. Clear gold color. Fresh hop character in nose and flavor. Well balanced. Light body. Nice finish. Definitely a session beer. Similar in some ways to an american pale ale."
"P.S. I wonder which beers were this one's competitors in the Tesco Brewing Award competition, that this ordinary product should stand out?"
