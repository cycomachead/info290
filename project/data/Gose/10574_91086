It shows more restraint in both saltiness and tartness than others, but this is a good thing as it allows for more complexity to come through and ramps up the drinkability. The spruce is very subtle, and I like it in this role. It really isn't the oddity I was expecting (thought the rarity of the style makes it a bit of an eccentricity already). It's tough to rate to style when the style is this rare, but I enjoyed it and from what I can tell it is a well-made, balanced beer.","ryan1788a5","May 02, 2013"

4.23,12.2,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Drinkability is high, a refreshing, balanced, mild gose. This is made to quench, not to ponder. Cranking up the lacto and salt might be more exciting, but not nearly as drinkable. I was expecting it to be more extreme, but it is nevertheless very well done.","ccrida","Apr 13, 2013"
3.91,3.7,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"overall this is an incredibly balanced and enjoyable beer. I think it takes all the ingredients and does them all justice by not making any of them more bold than another. I think I would prefer it more tart but that being said I have not had a gose that really nails it with the salt and cardamom","MRsojourner","Apr 11, 2013"

4.04,7.2,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"This spruced Gose pours a light bodied and cloudy light gold in color with a two finger bright white head. The nose is light with moderate German yeast character, light lemon peel, and a touch of spruce. The flavors mimic the nose with light and slowly acidic lemon peel with nice and approachable German yeast and a slight spruce/menthol character that shows its head in the aftertaste. There is just a touch of salt but nothing over the top. It's like drinking a light Hefe on the beach in Florida. The spruce isn't bold but its there in the finish. It drinks light in body and is very sessionable. This would make for a great German session beer for summer. Overall this is probably the best Gose I've had yet. It's a really nice beer for the style.","aasher","Mar 27, 2013"

3.73,-1.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly salty flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","0"
