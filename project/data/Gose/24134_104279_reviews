"Complete dryness overtakes the finish as the ale closes with a snap. Elements of citrus peel, soft perfume and sour white grapes give its waning moments a convincing champagne character, if not for the linger of wheat that returns in echoes."

"Overall - I like this beer and need more. I do think I might like regular Westbrook gose better though."

"huge thanks to 2000drafts for sending me a 2nd box of extras...just insanity. enjoyed the other day from a westbrook snifter...reviewed from notes. pours a really murky cloudy orange yellow. cloudier than the gose. nose is sweet n sour and salty with a bit of a fruity tartness that you don't find in the gose. taste matches the nose. a bit more full than gose and less salty/sour, but along the lines of gose with a twist. super refreshing and great warm weather beer. wish i could find this locally."

"Overall I like this better than the standard Gose. Even at this age. The yuzu fruit juice really adds a tropical like twist to the original and surprisingly possibly some sweetness. Highly crushable, flavorful, and light summer drinker."

"T: The initial taste is like licking a lemon that's been dipped in salt. Cocktail sauce, light crackery malt, citrus peel, tangerine and some sour pink grapefruit. Finish gives just a touch of wheat and a lingering salty lemon twang. Intensely sour and salty at the same time with a drying finish that leaves you wanting a lot more. This is an amazing beer."

"o - not as tart or salty as their gose and as stated above much juicier. delicious beer but i prefer gose as it is saltier and more tart to me."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an excellent Gose. Very very tart but seems to temper as it warms. One of my favorites I've ever had of the style, bravo"
"A very nice change of pace from the higher ABV beers that I've been drinking. I like it, the refreshing citrus is nicely balanced and not too overbearing."

"Really bright lemony citrus nose on the beer that pours a hazy straw color with wispy head. Tastes exactly like Gose with Yuzu juice. Very refreshing to have a beer deliver on what you expect from it. The beer is also refreshing in general. It's pretty tart from the yuzu juice but not a sour/funkiness from a wild ale."
"Overall: Westbrook really knows what they're doing here. This is a delicious beer by any standard. Would love to get more, I was thrilled to receive this as an IP extra but would happily have traded for it."
"Overall pretty nice. Good tartness with interesting fruity citrus, and spices, nice wheat, pretty tasty."

"Overall: Skanky and tart, but deliciously, even refreshingly so. Can you imagine? Can y-- Well, you can probably imagine, but yeah. Skanky and tart!"

"O - A good tart gose that isn't as salty as the regular as the fruit tempers down the in your face saltiness of Gose but adds adds an additional complexity that you don't get in the original. It also softens the flavors in the original which makes this one more approachable."
"Overall: Just a delightful beer to drink; I love both the Gose and the Gozu"

"Served in a bottle inside some old maple syrup vessels that retain head and keep aroma in. This beer is awesome. I could sit at the beach and consume it all day. Front end is salty and a little coriander. Appearence is light with tons of head. Clarity is perfect. A basic gose taste leads into some light sour notes and a mild acidic back end. Nose is awesome Gose with slight sour horse blacket notes; could be a little stronger but perfection is there in subtle amounts. Excellent lasting carbonation throughout. Really can't say enough about this."

"A well made gose with an interesting twist."

"If they put this in 6-packs I would buy it all the time! Really nicely refreshing - every sip makes my mouth beg for another one!"
"Well, I thought I'd like this beer more than I did, since I'm a big fan of Gose as a style, and their Gose in particular. I also really like the flavor of yuzu, and thought, for instance, that it added a nice twist to New Belgium's version with yuzu of their Berliner Weiss. Here, though, I don't think the yuzu adds anything, and in fact probably detracts from the base beer's nice hit of salt and subtle coriander. You do get some citrus, but it's not zingy in itself or particularly pronounced, it just slightly mutes everything else. I guess some may like the Gose toned down a bit, but I'd prefer the base beer in all its glory."
"It's hard to say if I prefer this over Westbrook's standard Gose. I enjoy Gozu's citrus sweetness but miss Gose's saltiness. No matter- this is another great brew from Westbrook and well worth investigation."

"Pours a well hazed straw yellow hue. Glowing body with a brighter creamy white head atop. Mellow layer stays as a thicker ring, ok lacing. Aromas are salty and tart, lemon meets bready malts, gentle salt and straw. Tart citrus, gentle bread and grass. Initial is firmly sour up front, lemony and yuzu elements make this a bit puckering. Middle quickly shows lactic life and straw meet salt, flaked wheat and gentle dough. Cleaner light body is quite drinkable, sourness really quite nice. Backend is tart, a touch salty but really that lactic and citrus fruit vibe really provide some synergy. Sour and quite crushable. Finish is tart, a bit slick and citric acidity."
"O - It's like a toned down Gose, great still but I prefer the base"

"BOD 10/23/13. Hazy golden pour with very little head and lacing. The nose is slightly sour citrus against a slight mineral background. Light medium body, low carbonation level but an almost slick mouthfeel. Quite an interesting taste that is a nice balance of sour, citrus and salt. Yuzu juice yields a nice tartness that carries beyond the smooth finish. Another very well crafted ale from Westbrook and a new take on an old style."

"best gose I think ive ever had. its their standard gose (if there is such a thing these days), with yuzu juice added. yuzu being an Asian grapefruit type of citrus, bitter and acidic, a perfect additive for a beer like this. pale white wheat color to this, hazy and carbonated like soda pop. the nose is soft wheat malt, citric acid, a hint of herbal roundness, and a lemony funk from the yeast. salt is minimal in taste, but gives it body and a mineral flavor, while the yuzu is profoundly bitter, and with the coriander reminds me of fresca soda, a very similar flavor profile, minus the fake sugar of course. tart finish, almost soured, more so than any other gose ive had. fuller body for its color, effervescent carbonation, and a flavor profile that is incredibly unique and lasts a long time on my palate after the swallow. a genius beer in terms of conception and execution. something memorable here, the best incarnation of the style ive seen, and a beer I hope to drink again. highly recommended."

"Overall: Better, and perhaps less challenging, than their regular Gose. Loads of well-crafted flavor in a low ABV brew."

"O: This is a very interesting beer. The fruit isn't overpowering and I think it works well with salt and sourness of the Gose. This would be a great summer beer for enjoying by the water."
"Overall, their regular Gose was my favorite until this came along. This takes the regular Gose to a new level. By far my favorite Westbrook offering."
