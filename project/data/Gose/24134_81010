Aroma has a low malt & no hop profile & offers little other than brine, tartness & is (if memory serves from chemistry classes long ago) marked by an acidic sensation in the nostrils. Taste opens with ocean water salinity & lactic acid sourness, persisting far into the sip & almost overpowering faint hints of wheat, green apples, lemon & lime in a peppery, clean, crisp, dry finish. Aftertaste is a much more potent salty lemon, lime & tart green apple version of Anderson Valley\'s The Kimmie, The Yink & The Holy Gose. Salty throughout. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation that rapidly dissipates as the brew warms, puckering, mouthwatering, crisp, prickly & dry. This style is often brewed with coriander however I pick up no coriander hints at all.","mothmanscott","Feb 24, 2015"

3.45,-17.1,1.5,2,4.25,4.25,3.75,"Hmmm... how does one rate a Gose if they have no basis for comparison? Well, I'm certainly going to try! Sours have never been my thing, but I've heard so much about this one in particular that I felt it would be a crime not to give it a try. With Westbrook in my backyard, and their stable of stellar beers, it had to live up to the hype, right? Sort of. Right from the start, the appearance is quite unappealing. Ugly even. Pours from the can in to a fluted pilsner glass with a cloudy, golden-yellow hue and a little transparency. Zero head. I wouldn't even know this is carbonated based upon the appearance. I hate to say this, but is looks like concentrated urine. The aroma is on par. Intense sour scents and perhaps a little lemon citrus are buried under a dirty urinal cake fragrance. Pretty gross really. Surprisingly, the taste completely transcends the other attributes. Fruity lemon-zinging tartness clears a path for a lingering grain flavor that imparts a little sweetness. The aftertaste reminds me a little of smarties candy, but with an obvious sour note. If you've ever enjoyed sour patch kids, this may be your beer. The body is thin & light, with a nice watery texture. Absolutely minimal carbonation. Just enough to give it a hint of effervescence. Surprisingly quenching, which invites the next curious gulp. One of the intriguing elements of this experience is that the sourness washes away pretty quickly, leaving behind a little residual saltiness. Then the salinity makes you feel compelled to take another drink. While this is certainly not for everybody, I have to imagine that the target audience agrees that Westbrook executed this one very well. If anything, this one got me curious to see what other Gose offerings are like. Isn't that the point of craft beer? To expand your horizons? Mission accomplished Westbrook.","JohnnyI","Feb 15, 2015"

I'm wrong.  This is the best Gose I've ever had.  It's amazing.  Perfectly sour/salty and even smells good (every other Gose has smelled bad but I've overlooked that.

Nose expresses citric acid, a light yeasty quality and a hint of brine.  Taste follows nose - pleasantly tart, citrusy and salty.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively, effervescent carbonation and a mild acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands.  Probably only the third Gose I've ever tried.  Reminds me of a salty Belinner-Weisse.  Very refreshing - I'd love to have access to this during the warm weather.","Jwale73","Dec 14, 2014"

The GGW is much more tart and more akin to a classic sour.  This is great, but really kind of pales in comparison to its brethren.","gillagorilla","Nov 15, 2014"

Salt weaves throughout, but it's countered by lightly bready malt in the finish. A little too acetic. Wish lactic were less overwhelmed.","barczar","Oct 15, 2014"

Flavor opens up with a nice tart lemon and lime bite.  Notes of grains from the wheat weave into the mix.  Finish brings a tart, spicy and salty finish.  Prickly mouthfeel from the carbonation, light body and dry finish is nearly perfect.  Overall this is just a great beer that's refreshing and different.","HopBomb515","Oct 14, 2014"

Nose is sharp coriander and lemony wheat with a definite briny element... with warmth a sorta yeasty/doughy element comes up and out of the glass. Flavor is surprisingly tart.. bright lemony lacto... the sour notes blow out most of the coriander except on the finish when it rebounds with a light saltiness... Much more sour than any standard Berliner I have had in a while and doesnâ€™t have as much salt/coriander as the AV Gose... The body is light/medium and punctuated a bit by the residual wheat malt.. Drinkability is very high for the one (maybe a 2nd) can, but my stomach couldnâ€™t handle much more in a session.","JohnGalt1","Aug 18, 2014"

The salty and sour elements compliment each other wonderfully. Lime flavors dominate the palate on the initial taste, with the saltiness lingering toward the back of the tongue. The saltiness also accentuates "tongue-smacking" that occurs with the sour flavors. Regarding the mouthfeel, the carbonation is just right for the flavor profile. Honestly, it's hard to drink this beer one sip at a time--it's that good. It's perfect for the summer.","tbdkev","Jul 18, 2014"

The taste is where this beer shines. Starts with tangy tartness followed by huge notes of candied lemon and lemon zest. This is quickly followed by a dash of sea salt and a grainy wheat to finish. The finish is clean and balanced. A ton of flavor is jam packed into this 4% brew and this shows me how incredibly tasty a gose can be. I can see why people scoop up cases at a time of this, hopefully this somehow finds it's way into Chicago's distribution.","homebrew311","Jul 18, 2014"

One of the more refreshing beers I've tried this summer, I could easily run through a case of this with ease, definitely a great warm weather beer.","kevanb","Jul 16, 2014"

Nose is tart with citrus and something sour. A bit of wheat and sweetness and a some earthy coriander. The nose is like a kind of perfume. It's hard to describe. The taste is outrageously good. All the tartness of lemon, the brightness of the lemon peel, the earthiness of the coriander. The crisp and dry wheat malt. Rather than an outright taste of salt, there is a saline aspect in the composition of the palate. it is at once complex yet simple. It's refreshing and has an underlying sweetness that is subtle. It's dry and while it's not salty the saltiness contributes to the overall mouthfeel and texture of the beer. It's thirst quenching, it's aromatic , it is an instant favorite.","utopiajane","Jun 27, 2014"

If I could go to the store and grab a sixer of this on the way to the beach or ballgame, it would be a no brainer. That said, there are a couple of beers in the style that I like a little better, just because the overall beer is a little more subtly done; of course those don't come in cans, and are a bit pricey, since they have to traverse the Atlantic to hit store shelves. If you have access to this beer and like brews with sour components, don't hesitate to grab this one.","LambicPentameter","Jun 10, 2014"

There is also an earthy quality toward the end with more sour and salt lingering after the swallow. Overall this is great a lot more sour than traditional versions but a solid take on the style and refreshing - very good worthy of a try if you like sour wheats.","Slatetank","May 29, 2014"

Aromas of tangy sweet white grapes, salt, toasted grains, subtle buttery notes, and white wine characteristics. Flavors are crisp and tart forward, with a blast of sour right behind. White grapes, sea salt, and tannins on a subtle toast backbone. The body is light, but full at the same time. Tart and salty aftertaste, which dries you out slightly, begging you to drink more. Dry, clean, crisp finish. Unbelievable drinkability on this beer. Fantastic!","GarthDanielson","May 26, 2014"

Like a good Gose, this beer is sharply tart, and just salty enough to really taste it and whet the palate for more. While it is spiced with coriander, I could use a bit more of that for balance and to round out the finish. This can be a polarizing style- it's certainly not for everyone, but if you want a well put together Gose on the sharper side that's sour and refreshing, look no further.","Georgiabeer","Jan 04, 2014"

The foam fizzed briefly to for a thin floating head before fading away, and leaving behind a still liquid that looked like raw sugarcane juice. The smell was sour and biting, and somewhat reminiscent of a Lambic. The taste showed off both the sourness and salt, as this tasted more like an unsweetened cider than any other beer I have had before. I have had the German Gose a long time ago, but I hon't recall it being this bold. Very light and refreshing to drink, and the 4% alcohol made it quite easy to drink. The finish was a lingering, puckering sourness. I only picked a single can this time, but I think I will get more, while the days are long, and the summer sun still lurks about.","rajendra82","Aug 15, 2013"

The mouthfeel is quite good. Medium-high carbonation along with the sourness makes the beer very refreshing and crisp. Definitely glad I picked this one up to try.

I don't get how the initial taste and the midpalate could be so much about the clean tart citrusy sourness and then devolve to that stale, backwashy Milwaukee's Best Light flavor right at the end. The good news is that the cure for that aftertaste is to take another sip and get that nice sour freshness to wipe it away... until that one devolves too. Point is the can goes fast.

The lacing is thin along with the retention on this . The smell of the beer is grainy with some citric acid sourness and a touch of mineral-like saltiness. The taste is pretty tart upfront. not much of the malt comes through until the finish where the salt also shines a bit. The mouthfeel is very light, very crisp and refreshing. Overall it's an exceptional example of the style. I'm not big on the more sour Gose's but this one worked for me. Definitely worth trying.","Knapp85","May 27, 2013"

4.77,14.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I don't like to gush about beers. But Westbrook is a brewery, that in my mind, has proven their commitment to producing beers of exceptional quality. And while I have partaken of several of their offerings (and thoroughly enjoyed them) the Gose stands out as a truly world-class beverage. Light, crisp, citrusy, sour, salty, and delicious; this beer was crafted for kids who loved sour candies and then grew up. It is bright and refreshing without completely overpowering the palate, despite the intense flavor. It has a very light mouthfeel, much like a skim or 1% milk, but the flavor asserts itself onto your tastebuds and then vanishes leaving a memory of tart salty goodness that lingers for a moment and then is gone. Drink it and prepare to be amazed.","sepharious","Nov 17, 2012"

3.96,-4.8,2.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Served this Gose sour wheat beer at the brewery, on tap, in a pint glass. Poured a cloudy lemon color, produced a small white head, and featured poor retention. Above average lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this German Sour beer consisted of malted wheat, coriander, and lactic acid. Medium in body, this ale had a foundation of malted wheat, sour lemons, sea salt and coriander. Aggressive amount of tart/sourness- Salty it made you want to go back for more. First example of this style that I have sampled, so i dont have much to compare it too, but I will say that this was very good and I look fwd to trying more beers of this style.","GossageBrewery","Oct 05, 2012"

3.97,-4.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a Mother Earth strange. Poured a hazy golden straw yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a very minimal amount fairly quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, meringue, lemon zest, citrus, and salt. The flavor was of sweet malt, salt, tart, citrus, lemon juice, lemon zest, lemon rine, and subtle oyster. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I have to be honest that the salt on this one really is the star of the show and makes sure to remind you of this well after each sip as it coats the palate without mercy. I thought it was kind of odd that I picked up on a subtle note of oyster meat on this one on the followthrough. However, it wasnâ€™t too bad. Quite refreshing and an interesting flavor profile to say the least. Definitely worth a try for the true Gose fans and the curious alike.","thagr81us","May 15, 2012"
