"O- Very bland tasting beer, especially after I cracked a Westbrook Gose to drink side by side with this. No sourness or saltiness to it and the lack of truffle flavours was fairly disappointing."

"O - Sweet and creamy. A nice drinker, and not as crisp as the normal Gose."

"Pour is lighter golden amber with a fairly tight white head with some larger bubbles. Nose is light salt up front, a hint of grain, strong citrus behind. Taste is similar, a bit of earthiness to it, fair touch of salt, faint hint of grain, tons of citrus behind. Body is a touch of oil, softer carb and creamy feel."

"Overall. The truffle flavor just wasn't there, but a good summer beer nonetheless."

"Overall a nice, gentle, enjoyable beer but it doesn't stand out as anything exceptional. I expected it to at least be extremely different, given that I've never had either a Gose or a beer brewed with white truffles. But it's not really all that different."

"The palate opens with a touch of earth, a mild saltiness and a brightening coriander note. A touch of earthy funk is also present. As with the base beer, the salt levels are low, but completely appropriate and extremely refreshing. Light in body with a drying, snappy finish, maybe a touch watery?  Carbonation is crisp. Awesome stuff."
