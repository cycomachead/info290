3.76,-2.3,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"O: This is a well made gose, and it's nice to see another memeber of this rare beer style around. Hope they bottle this one to allow the number of bottled goses I've seen to increase to two.","Halcyondays","Mar 17, 2013"

3.55,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and lemon-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly salty flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice mouthfeel that makes this one easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","0"
