"Clear to faintly hazy, light yellow color.  Tall white foam that settles relatively quickly. Strong carbonation.  Coriander in the aroma.  Light coriander flavor, mildly salty, and sour.  Citrusy aftertaste.  Refreshing and easy drinking."

"A decent Saison from 2nd Shift but not quite there with the best. The sour cherry notes tended to overwhelm the accompanying flavors."
