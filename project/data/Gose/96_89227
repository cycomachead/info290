3.37,6,4.25,4,3,3,3.25,"I am very curious to try this as Gose is not an everyday style. Also, as a U.S. Navy retiree, I am definitely a "salty dog"! I used a heavy-hand to begin the pour, resulting in a pseudo-cascade, settling into a finger off bone-white (salt-white?) head with fair retention, dropping into a skim across the top of the beer. Color was a button-bright sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose smelled like sea spray. I kid you not, I felt like I was back on the forecastle of any of the four ships on which I served. Man, my mouth was watering, both from the memory and at the prospect of what was to come! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was salty, sure and slightly spicy, but in both instances, they seemed muted. This lacked Ooomph! to make it a really standout Gose. Finish was dry, but it could have been so much more.","woodychandler","Jul 17, 2014"

This beer was crisp and easy to drink. Nice mellow smooth flavor of wheat, lemon zest, white bread. This beer was a nice simple break from the big bold beers I've had of late. My first of the style as well. Not sure how representative this is, but I liked it. Great beer for the summer months.","Onenote81","Jun 07, 2013"

3.26,2.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its lightness, and decent spiciness on the back. With this amalgamation of raw and unfiltered ingredients we were worried about getting a big muddled ball of contrasting elements. We were pleasantly surprised to find the opposite, as the finish, while watered, was clean and relatively spicy. This beer was actually much more reminiscent of a lighter, more watery Wit than your traditional Gose. The spice was there through clove and coriander, but any salty wheatiness fell to the wayside with more pale, overly adjuncty malts as a whole. The yeast was also a bit too overrepresented, giving palpable muck to the feel and powder dryness. While we commend Magic Hat for attempting the style, we are left wanting a bit more substance and a lot more flavor.","TheBrewo","Apr 17, 2013"

3.53,11,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"I give magic hat a lot of credit for always being bold and trying new things, ambitious styles, and just overall far out stuff, but I criticize them for doing all of them within the safe realm, not quite authentic, and sort of leaning towards mass appeal. usually it works just fine for me, but you cant half ass a gose. a salted wheat beer recipe resurrected from yesteryear cannot be played safe, im sorry. pours clean and mostly clear duller golden with a finger or so of off white suds, fine lace left behind. the nose is straight coriander, fresh green leaves, not seeds or extract, very vegetative, and it detracts from the minerally salt and bready wheat malt I want to be paying attention too. the taste is equally over-herbed, with the salt only coming in the finish. its not dry, not refreshing, sort of like a pretzel... its a great snack, gets the job done, takes the edge off the hunger, but doesn't fill you up or leave you completely satisfied, like a precursor for something that never comes. that's this beer through and through, much left to be desired. I want a salty stop in the feel, and I want an effervescent carbonation that keeps it moving, and both are absent, but I cant be too hard on this. nobody makes a gose, and I love the effort to reintroduce the style to America. I also love its drinkability. maybe I wouldn't call this genre defining, but it is playing a useful role in this summers beer spectrum.","StonedTrippin","Apr 13, 2013"

3.36,5.7,3,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Saint Saltan pours out a slightly hazy yellow-orange color with a small head. The smell is strongly of the Magic Hat house signature yeast, with a bit of coriander and a pinch of salt. The taste is pretty heavy on the coriander, but otherwise tastes just like Magic Hat's Single Chair Ale with just a hint of salt on the backend. The mouthfeel is on the heavy side of light and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, one of the more average brews Magic Hat has put out in a long time. It's tasty, but absolutely nothing special. And, beyond the slightest hint of salt, there's nothing Gose-y about this at all.","shand","Mar 21, 2013"
