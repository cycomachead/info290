"Pours hazy and light, looks like grapefruit juice. The nose reveals some bread and light funk. The taste is similar, lightly bready - little citrus. Sticky white lacing throughout consumption. Very drinkable brew but lacking - bit funkier and more salty and I'd be telling a different tale. All in all... a nice entry level gose."
