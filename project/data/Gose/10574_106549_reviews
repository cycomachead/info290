"Loved the earthiness and tang of the rhubarb with this one.. Hopefully have a chance to find this one again. -a gem"
"Awesomely refreshing and crisp with a nice red fruity flavor imparted by the rhubarb. Need more gose beers in my life."

"This is a delicious beer.  The rhubarb lends a surprising complexity of fruit aromas and taste. Not traditional but well done."

"Nice citrusy smell. Lightly sour, subtly herbal taste. Super refreshing, super light."

"The rhubarb doesn't seem to be coming through in the taste but seems to make the beer very wonderful.  Great brew."
"Serving type: bottle."
"Bottle. Pours a opaque, golden color. Minimal head. The color is interesting, as is the aroma. It smells slightly cheesy with some unripe fruits. Lemon aroma as well. Reminds me of kiwis, too. The flavor is sharp and bright. Tart fruit flesh, lemons, rhubarb, kiwi. Mostly dry. Funky with a bit of cheese rind. Salinity is minimal. Barnyard flavors. Cider similarities. Salt actually starts to sneak up on me the more I enjoy this brew. Light bodied. Surprisingly high carbonation. Savory yet crisp. Dry. Very interesting. Very rustic and fruity. A tasty, unique Gose."

"Complete dryness is strongly committed to the lactic acidity and its clean citrusy portrayal. While the ale effortlessly strips the palate of all thirst and leaves it refreshed, an aftertaste of musty cork and light bread keeps the palate rewarded both deep and quick."

"This is a gose?? Transcends the style, in my opinion, and I will be so frustrated if they don't just up and decide to make this a year-round offering. Highly drinkable, refreshing, complex, and rivals even several high quality German Rieslings I've had to date. Do everything possible to try this - it's delicious, complex, and extremely easy to drink - a new staple for the style if I ever saw one."
