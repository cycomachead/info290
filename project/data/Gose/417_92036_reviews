"I am sorry, but this beer doesn't look or taste like a Gose..."
""
""
"Gose is a style which was initially very unique to me, so it will take me a while to appreciate the various renditions and interpretations, but this one is very approachable, and a good thirst quencher."
"Golden sunset color. Smell is lacking, slight saltwater odor otherwise smells like an adjunct lager. Modest floral taste finishes with salty taste. Slightly sour, very under-rated, Excellent summer brew and a very favorable cost."

"I’ve only had one other gose, so I can’t really say how good this is for the style. It’s damned enjoyable, though. Normally I think “refreshing” is a rather lazy adjective to use in describing a beer, like when female houseguests mindlessly refer to my bedroom as “Kafkaesque,” even though my furnishings evoke none of the subtle humor of Kafka’s work. This beer, however, is refreshing as hell. Because it’s like sitting next to the goddamn ocean."

"Pours a hazy golden-amber in color with about a 1/2 finger white head that settles down to just the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen but not a lot. The aroma is mostly of wheat and spice. Bit more going on with the taste as this is a 'Ale brewed with coriander and salt' and you can taste both of those ingredients. Goes down easy with no harsh or bitter aftertaste. Never had this style of brew but I like it. Lighter+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, a good brew!"
"It's ""drinkable", but not entirely desirable."

"The beer has a lemony spicy nose with white bread. It pours clear orange tinted gold under a 1” foam cap. A light salty palate with some biscuit leads to a tart, refreshing finish. Light body with medium carbonation."
""
"Overall, well, it's not as good or exciting as others of the style. The wheat is a little soft, it doesn't quite have that zing. The coriander is a little muted as well. With that said, this is a good beer. I would drink this any day over the likes of most other Oberon-esque beers out there. If this was available in my area I would by it every now and then over the warmer months. Worth a try."

"It's a very tasty brew, but it reminds me nothing of a gose whatsoever.  It's actually a very decent sweet malted brew, with a refreshing body, but has none of the lemon, brine, or wheaty chew I look for in this style.  But it is a beer I could easily drink again.  Very hard to score this one, as it doesn't really fit the style, but is a decent drinkable beer."

"O -- Not as close to its Belgian cousin, Gueuze, as I expected and a rather pleasant drinker. I can see this being a very enjoyable quencher on a hot summer day."
""
""
"Overall - a fantastic beer with lots of happy flavor and beautiful notes and appearance.  The Goosetown Gose is one of the most refreshing yet tasty beers that has ever graced my tongue. A Winner, absolutely."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is pretty meh. It's a relatively bland example with a bad mouthfeel. It's not awful, but there are better Goses (is that a word?) out there."

"Very good summer beer. But would like more from it."

"A nice, easy-drinking sweet-leaning thirst quencher!"

"This is probably my favorite beer at the moment. Goosetown has a malty, citrus taste. Very, very refreshing. No hint of bitterness, perfect for a summer day, yard work companion. It is extremely hard to have just one. Pleasant aftertaste, probably because of the salt. I am no expert, but I know what I like and it is Goosetown. A very enjoyable experience and I have stocked my beer fridge full of Goosetown."

"Taste is light and grainy with a hint of salt and a moderate amount of witbier spice. Its pretty tame overall and I could definitely use a bit more yeastiness and/or tartness. But nonetheless, it is a pretty tasty beer that I wouldnt mind drinking a sixer at a tailgate with ease."
""

"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention from active carbonation and nice lacing. Mild aroma of sweet malt and a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is mild with wheat and light lemon with a hint of salt and coriander. Light bodied with pleasant carbonation. A quite tame gose, closer in character to a light hefeweizen, but the salt and coriander elements of gose are present, if very attenuated. Probably not a good introduction to the style, but a pleasant drinking light wheat beer with a bit of character from the gose ingredients."
"overall, not having any experience with the gose style, that this was a fair offering from Schell's. it made a nice quencher after shoveling some snow, as it did this past summer after a day of yardwork. i'll be revisiting this next summer for sure...but i wonder how long it will remain in the year round line up."

"Overall: Not a style I like very much, but I appreciate the effort to bring a style like this to the masses. I would like to try it on tap or from a cask to see if it changes the flavor profile a little."

"Goosetown Gose pours a copper color with very little head, no lacing. There is a sweet crisp malty aroma, but its rather weak. The taste has a nice crisp malty backbone, with hints of lemon and wheat. Flavors are present even though its a lighter beer, but its rather easy to drink. Overall a decent refreshing beer."
""

"Pours a clean deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, coriander and some sweeter spices. In the taste, sweet cinnamon, coriander and sweet orange, and a touch malty. A spice bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry light spice in the aftertaste. A bit sweet but light in flavor, eh!"
""
"EDIT: Ah yes! Gose has lacto sourness, which is lacking here. But I still like it and am not readjusting scores. I suppose if I tried to score it to style, taste would be docked for this reason."
"Beer is light in body with medium-high levels of carbonation that situate the mouthfeel at the border of being fizzy, but never into that territory. The result is a crisp, effervescent mouthfeel that eventually turns foamy and smooth as it moves across the palate. Closes dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate."
""
""
"Overall, this beer just wasn't for me. It was light, but just was odd. I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't get myself to (even after a 12 pack)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice to see a rare stab at a Gose by a domestic brewer; this is a particularly good example though it doesn't seem to have as much of a salty character as some others; still, I like it just the way it is"
""
""
"O - Never had a gose before, but this is an ok wheat beer with a fairly simple (but not bad) smell and taste and a light, refreshing feel."
""
"A pretty bland beer. I haven't had many goses, but this drinks like a slightly sweet light lager, or something similar and ""easy-drinking"". I can't figure out what it's trying to be, and what it is doesn't do much for me. Not something I'd go for again."

"Light gold with a solid cap of dense white foam. Smells of coriander, salt, lemon pith, some grain and a little banana and clove. Flavor is nice and floral from the start, some gardenia, sweet honeydew and sweet pear. Some grain and banana. Medium bodied with a soft carbonation and a wet finish. Nice beer, not quite the gose I'm used to, but nice."
"Not a bad Gose, for me it comes in behind Leipziger, Moonlight, and Off Color Troublesome, but it's a solid intro to the style."
""
"O: A wonderful beer. Could see myself drinking many of these at a biergarden out of 64oz mugs. Very nice beer, would certainly stash a bunch for the summer."
"I am no expert on this style, but I really like this beer."
"This is my first gose, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. The predominant characteristic about this beer is it's saltiness. Very drinkable, nothing unpleasant or offensive about this one, but nothing particularly interesting, either. Goes down very refreshing, but left my mouth really dry--I had to drink a full glass of water afterwards."
""
""
""
"O= This beer is odd to say the least. Then again it is a characteristic of the style. That being said I don't think it's bad. It actually is sort of fun. Close your eyes and your breathing sea air in the middle of Minnesota. I likely won't buy more but I'll enjoy the rest of this six pack for sure."
""
"Weirdly appealing, this beer just goes straight for the salt addiction of humanity & forgoes all pretense of being anything else. If the base shone a bit more, this would be a really fine summer session beer; as is, just pretty good."
""
""
""
"PERFECT for summer!"
""
""
"Overall:A pretty nice warm weather wheat driven beer. Nice notes of coriander and citrus."
""
""
""
"Light bodied, above average carbonation, and very smooth and easy to drink. Very refreshing. This would be a great beer for a hot summer day."
""
"This offering from Shell's is brewed in the classic Gose style, with coriander and salt. it pours from the bottle a dark yellow to golden color with a thin cap of foam. That ring is quite persistent, being constantly replenished with the rising carbonation. The bready, wheat-like aroma mixes with just a hint of caramel. Spice opens the nasal passages, but it isn't distinct enough to identify. For a wheat beer, this thing is easy going on the palate. The extensive carbonation helps ameliorate the chewiness of the wheat. The malt and wheat flavors make the front end pleasantly malty. A slight touch of coriander rises toward the end. The palate is dried out a bit, presumably from the salt. A balance, clean brew. Now if only summer, or spring for that matter, would arrive...maybe by May 1."

"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into thick chunky lacinv that sticks to the side of the glass. The aroma is of banana, clove, coriander and salt. It is a pleasant aroma, however, I would prefer it to be slightly more pronounced. The taste crisp and sharp like a gose is supposed to be. There is a nice wheaty twang, and a saltiness that dries the beer out enough that I want to take another sip. However, the nice banana and clove notes that are present in the aroma, are not to be found in the taste, and that is a shame. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy texture. Oddly, there is a plethora of vigorous carbonation visible in the beer, but it doesn't drink as though it is as highly carbonated as it appears to be. Overall, I like this beer quite a bit. I can see how it might be improved, but I'm also guessing that it will taste much better when the weather gets hotter."
""
""
"Sure was not as special as I was hoping. Offers clean wheat flavor but I wanted more uniqueness of a gose."
"Overall: A nice beer, good for summer or spring (if that ever shows up this year). Reminds me very strongly of Belgian witbier due to the coriander. Another solid beer from Schell's."
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing as hell. Not as much complexity as hoped for, but better than the typical American Wheat style. This would be easy to consume all day with no complaints."
""

"Overall this is a pleasant and refreshing offering from one of MNs great breweries. Will be great when the warm weather actually arrives. I still wonder why they filtered this, I think it may be losing a bit of complexity without the risidual yeast, like having a filtered hefe. I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of lactic in the taste, it was there in the nose. While I can't say I'll be buying a ton of this, I will be looking forward to a couple sixers over those humid summer weekends. Unique and refreshing, reccomended to all. Cheers!"
""

"Only the second gose I have ever had and I like this one much better than the first one I tried. Extremely refreshing beer that would absolutely be sessionable especially in the middle of a humid MN summer. My favorite part of the the beer is the mild salt character. Really different and adds to the refreshment. Very fun beer to try."
