2.95,-21.3,3.75,3,2.75,3.5,2.75,"O- Very bland tasting beer, especially after I cracked a Westbrook Gose to drink side by side with this. No sourness or saltiness to it and the lack of truffle flavours was fairly disappointing.","Stevedore","Jul 08, 2014"

3.78,0.8,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Pour is lighter golden amber with a fairly tight white head with some larger bubbles. Nose is light salt up front, a hint of grain, strong citrus behind. Taste is similar, a bit of earthiness to it, fair touch of salt, faint hint of grain, tons of citrus behind. Body is a touch of oil, softer carb and creamy feel.","cpetrone84","0"

3.82,1.9,4,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Overall a nice, gentle, enjoyable beer but it doesn't stand out as anything exceptional. I expected it to at least be extremely different, given that I've never had either a Gose or a beer brewed with white truffles. But it's not really all that different.","draheim","Apr 30, 2014"

4.25,13.3,4,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"The palate opens with a touch of earth, a mild saltiness and a brightening coriander note. A touch of earthy funk is also present. As with the base beer, the salt levels are low, but completely appropriate and extremely refreshing. Light in body with a drying, snappy finish, maybe a touch watery?  Carbonation is crisp. Awesome stuff.","DefenCorps","0"
