It's hard to judge carbonation but it could also stand with a bit more sour.  Really well done.  I hope this style takes off,  the craft world could do with a few more like this one.","rawfish","Jan 25, 2015"

Smell is of malt, grain, and Fruity Pebbles aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour fruity and salty flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is refreshing, tasty, and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 05, 2013"
