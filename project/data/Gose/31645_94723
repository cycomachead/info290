4.05,-1,4,4,4,4,4.25,"750ml caged and corked bottle served in a stange.  90% of the cylinder was comprised of dense, bright white foam off the initial pour.  Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution and adhering to the walls of the glass.  clarity is translucent.  Nose expresses clean, bready yeast aromas, a kiss of lemon and a hint of wheat malt.  Taste consistent with nose - light acidity, pleasant lemony quality.  Salt is barely detectable.  Clean yeast and light biscuity malts are also present.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a refreshing carbonation and an easy acidity.  All and all very pleasant and easy-drinking.  If it wasn't labelled as a Gose, I'd just have assumed it was a Berlinner Weisse.  The least salty of any Gose's I've tried.  I'd love to see this beer in tallboy cans.","Jwale73","Dec 14, 2014"

Unlike some goses where the salt component is more implied than anything, it was very prominent in this beer. The beer had a very distinct three-part effect on my palate: up front, it started off like an earthy Berliner weisse, funky, crackery, with a good dose of coriander; mid-palate, tart and fruity, notes of lemon and stone fruit; finished markedly briny, confusing the salivary glands in a pleasant way. Very nice! Light-medium body, complex and drinkable, even if it's not something I'd want to stick with all night long. But definite points for complexity. Overall a good interpretation of this relatively newly-resurrected style.","Rifugium","Aug 07, 2013"

I've tried 3-4 Gose's now and Lost Nation's is probably the best or one of the best out there. It is the perfect balance of saltiness and tart. A few other Gose's I've sampled were more sour/tart than the Lost Nation one, however the overall flavor profile of Lost Nation's was better. Extremely sessionable and thirst quenching. One of the most delightful summer beers / session beers one could ask for.","bubseymour","Aug 06, 2013"

Nose of tart and floral, with a grainy backbone. Subtle sour notes. Flavors are smooth fruit sweetness initially, with apple and pear tart and sweet afterwards. Smooth and crisp in mouth.

Nose is briny and lemony, smells like something to chase down oysters (which the bar serves). Very pleasant taste-the salt presence is in balance with lemon, citrus peel, and spice (coriander). A nice sipper on a summer afternoon, plus of the few goses I've had, this one is enjoyable and not just a novelty salt beer. Very clean finish and lively mouthfeel to coat the tastebuds.","Wowcoolman","Jul 02, 2013"

Head didn't last long, but had nice cling, with numerous streams of carbonation rising from the bottom. Not really cloudy at all. Aroma had a small hit of bitter, but a nice malty smell, with some citrus that had a bit of kick to it from a tad of spice. Flavor was a tart lemony with a strong salty note. Not overpoweringly so, but enough to stand out. Dry in the mouth, but yet had a bit of stickiness at the same time that was odd. Overall, a nice change from the norm.
