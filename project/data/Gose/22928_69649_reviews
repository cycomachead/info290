"Opaque good, laced white foam. Bright lemons, some funk. Nice mellow malt, fruity pebble front gives way to biting lemon and lil salt finish"
""
"Mouthfeel: Light bodied high carbonation. The high carbonation is another reminder of champagne and helps to spread the orange and coriander around my tongue."

"Overall an interesting style. Not the most drinkable, but tasty."

"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink and goes down easily. It is a refreshing change of pace compared to other common beer styles, but is something that probably isn't that appealing to the average craft beer drinker."
""
"o - Overall I like to see a local brewery trying new styles, especially something like a gose, but this one missed the mark. The nose was pretty bad and old smelling, while the taste was too salty. Too much buttered popcorn throughout it. Again, cool to see them do this and I've enjoyed every other beer I've had from Barrier so far, so I will certainly try their new beers in the future, but would avoid this one."

"Pours a dark golden color with a high white head that fades quickly; very little lacing. It smells a lot like weed, with some savory notes and also something sweet like mulberry. The taste is a little dominated by the weediness, but there's lemon zest, some earthiness, a little toffee that seems out of place. It's viscous, moderately carbonated, easy to drink. All in all, this is an interesting beer. I prefer the Leipziger (have to review that some time), but it's far and away better than the Bruery's Salt of the Earth. Not one I'll revisit, but one I'm glad to have tried."
"O: This is just awful. Though, you might sprinkle this on some popcorn."
"O - This has great drinkability. I could have quite a few of these in an evening. It is light, refreshing, and full of flavor. There is a lot of flavor here for it being so low in alcohol. This is my first Gose so I can't really compare it to any other beers of this style, but I definitely enjoyed it. I would buy this again."
"Overall a very good beer and a very interesting style that i look forward to finding again."
"I had my doubts about these two guys breaking off & attempting something like this, but it worked. I admire their restraint, especially considering their background brewing at Sixpoint. :)"
