"Nice color, perhaps inappropriately clear and decent lace.  Lightly briny aroma with a hint of cherry cough syrup.  Dry, salty, just a bit of cherry sweetness in the flavor.  Medium body, fairly high carb, reasonably dry finish.  Not bad, but this is one of those things that just doesn't work as well as it seems like it should.  Perhaps heavily fruiting a gose was just unnecessary?  Either way, this beer probably would have been better without the cherry."

"I've heard that in Germany, gose is considered a woman's beer. That's ok with me . . . I won't say anything if you won't. Victory's Kirsch is delicious and refreshing. Appearance reminds me of cherry 7up and the taste is similar as well with a nice sour twist to it. I like it."

"I've only had a few beers in this style and I wouldn't know a good gose from shinola, so I'm no expert and my ratings shouldn't count for much. I enjoyed this beer, but thought the beer was missing some of the salinity that should be present in this style. Still, it was quite tasty and drinkable."

"O- A nice sour cherry beer at a great price.  Very clean flavors, easy to drink."

"Flavor is definitely on the American side of the gose spectrum, but not as extreme as most. The cherry character adds a great character. Kinda like cherry pie."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle - strawberry soda color - bit of foam and light lacing. Smell is very light (after it warms a little it comes through) - a bit of sweet bread malt and berry. Taste has a bit of salt up front with nice tart cherry, follows with a touch of the malt and lingering cherry. Feel is light and slightly effervescent. Very happy to find this in 4 packs at the local grocery store!"

"Not as sharp or tart as a lot of Gose beers, but it has a solid flavor profile that isn't too saccharine or sweet, but has a nice bouncy flavor with a good cherry flavor & a good hit of malt yeast to round out the mouthfeel."

"Well balanced not over sour like some domestic representations of the style.  Sweetness of the cherries on the finish plays well with the saltiness up front."

"Very sweet and grainy. I don't get any saltiness on the palate. Not really representative of the style."

"A delicious simple and relatively inexpensive fruity and tangy gose from a bigger brewery (i.e. wider availability.) Sometimes you're just in the mood for some dessert and dropping 16$ on a bomber of kriek boon or whatever is too much of a commitment. Hopefully this and other similar simple sour styles will end up making its way to more local shops for indulging such desires."
""
"Overall: fantastic sour from a large american brewery. I wish more breweries did these sort of projects to further the reach of sour beers to the masses. This isn't a cellar candidate. Drink fresh."
