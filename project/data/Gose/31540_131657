3.84,-13.3,,,,,,"Such an interesting brew, seemed like it needed a review.  Appearance like a mango puree, golden, apricot colored, very opaque.  Nose is barnyard funk, horse blanket, lemon, piney hops.  Taste is very tart, almost sour.  Lots of lemony citrus with lots of funk.  Dont know if there is brett but a clear earthiness is present. The salt really comes through as does the really citrusy hop flavor.  A hint of coriander comes through but not as much as expected.  Not much carb, almost a smooth buttery texture that is slightly offputting. Overall, this is more of a dry hopped bretty sour brewed in a barn with some gose ingredients than a true gose.  For me, there are gueuze-like flavors mixing with a sharp cheese funkyness, salt, and hop citrus.  Not what I expected, slightly off putting, not really a gose, but surprisingly good!","IrishColonial","Dec 14, 2014"

Complete silence on opening the cap, indicating low or no carbonation. An aggressive pour yielded a completely lifeless liquid, no carbonation whatsoever, no head; murky orange-yellow color. In the aroma, lots of raw citrus oils, and not much else. Similarly in the taste, loads of citrus zest and oil, mostly grapefruit, with strong additions of orange and lemon, light coriander spice, and an unmistakable salty finish. The mouthfeel really suffered by the complete lack of carbonation, turning what would have probably been a very good gose into a glass of citrus juice. Even a slight bubbly tingle would have been a major improvement, but it just wasn't here. Overall tasty, but kind of hard to drink,due solely to the carbonation (lack thereof).","Rifugium","Dec 01, 2014"

Pouring a mostly clear light orange yellow with a dense, off-white head that falls off to a ring leaving little lacing, this looks solid. The nose is just incredible. Bright, juicy, fruity hops with a moderate amount of coriander, beautifully paired to amplify each others strengths along with a little bit of citron and lemon, this just smells incredible. In some ways, this is not unlike jal-jeera,. Coriander character is bright and fresh, lightly toasted. Salt is minimal. Some mild gin-like aromatics are also present. The palate opens quite sour with a big citrusy sourness, lemony and moderately potent along with a mild coriander note. The citrus sourness pairs beautifully with the hops, juicy and fruity with a blend of citrus, tropical fruit (pineapple, mango, guava). Mildly briny on the finish along with some citrus sourness, this is incredible stuff. Highly recommended.","DefenCorps","Oct 24, 2014"
