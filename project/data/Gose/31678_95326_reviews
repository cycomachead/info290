"All I got was a weakly flavored, average wheat beer."
"Overall: This is a tasty gose. Would repeat."
"Didn't care for the wheat sour combo"
""
""
"O: So close to Corona, yet so far away. Super light and drinkable, but has that little edge of real flavor and crispness over the aforementioned macro and others like it. Gose will probably never be a favorite style of mine, but this sample has all the characteristics to make me respect and appreciate the category."

"Very good beer. Appearance is traditional with a smallish off-white head that soon settles and a hazy yellow color. Aroma is grain and yeast. On my first sip I got wheat, grain, a little tart & coriander, but no salt. Second sip got all of that but then got a little salt too. Body is just right. Very nice drinking beer. Wouldn't mind another."

"Sought for so long and then it's… ok. I get those salty coriander flavors, and/but reads like a wheat beer so there's that. (Drives it home: I don't much like wheat beers.) Sparkles on the tongue though, and goes pretty well with a beet sandwich."
"O-Not sour, lacking in salt, not sure how this gets classified as a gose."
""
""
"Tasted like hot dog water - but in a good way!  Not overly salty and the coriander was allowed a little breathing room. Not bad at all."
"Pours a cloudy light golden color with a solid frothy white head that lingers for a while.  Smells like an infected hefeweizen, although not necessarily in a bad way.  Grassy, funky wheat, corriander, tart lemon zest, and yogurt.  A light saltiness as well.  Taste follows the nose pretty well, a funky, spiced wit that got the lacto treatment.  I wish there was slightly more tart and slightly less corriander though.  Mouthfeel is crisp, appropriate for the style.  I wish it was slightly more tart and funky, though I do still really enjoy this beer.  I'm not a big wheat beer drinker but this is a go to summertime brew anytime it's around."
"Nice lemon tartness . Great body and finishes clean"
"Overall, this is an entry level sour which might make a decent session beer.  Stronger sour presence is called for.  Decent for what it is intending to be."

"Outlier detected. Justify rating with a review."
"A little too much coriander--overpowers the flavor, although it's a possible I had a bad batch."
"Unique spin on a gose. Less bitter/salt and more wheat. Slight, balanced lactobacillus funk. Overall a fairly drinkable and enjoyable beer."

"Not as much funk as I'd like in a dour but still drinkable and refreshing."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, coriander, sea salt, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, salt/spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lightly tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, coriander, sea salt, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, coriander, sea salt, wheat, cracker, bread, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, salt/spice, and pale malt flavors; with a good malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly saline/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.3%. Overall this is a very good Gose style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, salt/spice, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. It was not as tart as I was hoping for, but the flavors were very well balanced. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"O: Great beer. There are a lot of spot-on qualities. I'll be buying anything I can find in the store from Off Color."

"I don't know if I got a bad bottle or something, but this was terrible. Perhaps I'll give it another shot some other time."

"Taste is orange, coriander, and lemon.  I do not get the saltiness that I typically associate with the style despite a bit of mineral taste.  Worth a try, but there are others that I prefer in the style."
""
""
""
""
"Not sure just how to rate this as I am completely new to this style and cannot seem to find the style guidelines for gose anywhere on the internet. (Hey BJCP, don't you think it's time you updated the style guidelines on your website? It ain't 2008 anymore.) From what I gathered, I feel like there should be more of a salty, saline-like character to this beer that I'm not getting. Other than that, I found it to be very enjoyable."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I’m still relatively new to enjoying Gose style beers, but I feel this is a solid representation of this most interesting brew. There is a sourness and funkiness at play here with a citric and salty feel. Enjoyable and thought provoking."
""
""
"It's really smooth, but sometimes the sour can be overpowering. Don't drink this with spicy food. Sweet and sour all the way."
""
" The taste has mild malt with wheat character and light grain toastiness and slight mineral aspect but not excessively salty tasting with mild tropical fruit in the background. Overal I liked this -very good traditional and drinkable gose - more traditional than some which is unexpected considering the brewer but pleasant and quaffable."
"Coming off Westbrook's salt laden mouth popper this just feels lackluster."
""
""
""
"This is enjoyable to drink. Sweet witbier with a touch of salt and tartness. If you like your gose closer to a sour, this may not do it for you, but it's a good brew."

"im new to the style , not sure if i like it , if u like refreshing beers give this one a shot"

"o: like this much more than i thought i would, not being a salt person.  its extremely tasty, and super refreshing - but doesn't have any overpowering flavors.  nicely harmonized"
"The palate opens tart, refreshing and with a blend of buttermilk, yogurt, wheat bread, and some grist. The mid palate has a mild coriander flavor, but the lack of salt makes this pretty interesting. By taking away that downright quenching character, this really veers off into berlinerweiss waters. Very light in body with a mild, watery moutfeel, disappointingly so, this beer is moderately carbonated and feels OK on the palate. Decent stuff."
"12oz. bottle courtesy of Brew33 and served in a stange.  Pours a slightly pale straw gold with a hazy clarity and a rocky, half inch, bright white head.  Head dissipates into a loose band around the shoulders.  Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution.  Nose expresses citrus, brine and a hint of coriander and sour mash.  Taste consistent with nose; however, less brine and more sour mash. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant carbonation falling just shy of bright.  This is probably my only second experience with the style so I don't have too many frames of reference to compare this to.  That said, this would make a great summer offering - reminds me a bit of a berlinner weisse/witbier hybrid."

"Not sure where I'm coming out on this beer - don't think I've ever had a gose and I've been excited to try one.  It's a delicate light bodied beer - nice dark yellow color with medium haze and little to no head.  The taste as first seemed complex with a slight bit of Belgian, slight lacto acid but not at all overwhelming, and refreshing.  Can't get much smell out of it, and as I drink the beer down to better try to understand the taste profile, my thoughts keep moving to ""this tastes more like a watered down ginger ale"" to me - I guess the ginger taste I'm getting is a mix of the coriander and salt.  Kind of disappointing for me, but not a bad beer for fans of this style in my ever so humble opinion.  Nonetheless, I am excited try some of the other Off Color offerings."
"Really disappointed with the front tartness.  Overall an nicely balanced, fairly enjoyable beer, but not exciting or, to me, within style enough."

"Bottle shared with a friend at World of Beer in Gainesville.  Pours hazy yellowish white colored with a creamy white head on top.  Aroma of bananas, clove, yeasty funk, pears, coriander.  As expected here.  Flavor follows with sweet bananas, yeast, corander, a bit of honey.  Mouthfeel is heavy for the style with big rich flavors alongside adequate to plus carbonation.  Overall a decent rendition of the style--described as a Witbier, but here looks to be a Gose.  As a Witbier, it falls a little short.  As a Gose, it's better than others I've had.  I would drink it again."

"Smells like buttered popcorn. Is that diacetyl? I don't have a lot of knowledge or experience with beer flaws. Despite that, it's not bad... but not great either."

"hard to rate this beer cause it's good as a saison w/ coriander, but pretty disappointing as a gose. not nearly tart enough"
""
"Very thin bone white head, covers the surface before a swift dissolve to just an accumulation along the glass sides, no real lacing either. Metallic yellow color, has good shine to compensate for overall paleness, not any bubbles but what’s there are large and active. The nose is on the flat side, yeast, iron flecks, wet straw, brown dirt, the mixed white citrus struggles to maintain presence, minimal peach, apricot fruit scents, funky on the whole albeit more sugary as it warms. Medium-bodied, heavily carbonated with an active churn in the mouth. Corn syrup kind of sweetness, dough, honey and lemondrops, can’t say it is easy to discern any coriander although there is an undistinguished cooking spice thing there. Peach, yellow apple to cherry flavors. The wheat is clearer, here comes off more as bread than uncooked dough. Semi-tart ending tries to play up earthiness but, again, more metallic than the former. For its weight can be refreshing and strikes one as a dinner table beer more than a quaffer on its own."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, nothing too special, mild coriander which comes through nicely, nice wheat and plenty of raw dough wheat with even the tartness of raw dough and lemony notes, enjoyable for a summer style beer, or a super hot summer like day in fall as in today."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is light golden with small head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of sourdough bread, funky malt, light spice, particularly coriander, wheat. There's an odd, rubbery scent in there as well, but I can't decide how distracting it is...Sour, earthy flavor. Tart lemon-like qualities. An interesting take on a gose. Unusual and worth a try."

"Meh beer."

"Finishes dry and sour, almost a puckering tartness at times, but is a unique beer that has a little bit of everything and is pretty good."

"Taste-Wheat, spicy yeast, faint coriander, a pinch of salt in the finish.  Light-bodied, faintly tart, and very refreshing and quenching.  A fine match for a blue cheese salad or light fish entree."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Again, this is decent, but the salt is just way too dominant in this one.  It needs some more flavors to balance it out.  Brewed with brett so I'll throw a bottle or two in the basement for a bit and see how it turns out."
""
""
""
""
"Very fruity and a touch tart. Different, but nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this brew has subtleties and little sex appeal (i.e. not barrel aged, not very sour or hoppy), but is quite a nice sip, nonetheless. It’s likely too sweet: it would be more quaffable if somewhat drier, or perhaps more highly carbonated. Additionally, the lactobacillus may under-deliver, but its subtlety is commendable."

"It looks like a Berliner weiße or Belgian witbier with a light straw gold body that's gently hazy and a short but creamy bright white head. The smell is a touch off-putting at first. To me it smells like spent grain, and perhaps a little bit of that ""old bar"" smell where dripping draft lines have left small puddles of beer in some unseen area, covered in white mold. Beyond that there's coriander, and the combination gives a bit of a wet straw or damp plywood character. The flavor is much the same, with the flavor of the lactobacilus coming in right up front, followed by bright coriander, and then sweet malt that gently fades away. It's tart, but not overtly so, and the balance of tart going to sweet is interesting. Oddly I find it a bit salty as well... ? ... and I see that it's listed on Beer Advocate as a Gose beer, but that's not on the label, nor is salt listed as a ""secret ingredient""... but of course, it is (I checked their website). So now it all makes sense. Well that's great. Personally I find the salt a bit strong, but that's up to the brewer to decide. It's curious, charming, and ultimately, refreshing and enjoyable. It's not the best gose bier I've had, but I'm impressed and I'll have to try seek out and sample more beers from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting, but ultimately distasteful. Enjoy Gose very much, but found the lacto way too prominent to the extent that taste devolvd to sour milk aftertastes. Seemed a relatively nicely made beer. Would try the brewery again,.Maybe just a bottle that wasn't the best."
""
""
"A very different and interesting beer.  Easy to drink with the low 4.3% abv."
"Pretty unique taste.  Light, but full of flavor.  Lots of spices that dance on the tongue."
""
"O: While it's not the greatest gose I've ever had Troublesome is definitely a worthwhile beer. Drinkable."

"O: Well done brew. I am drinking this in the Chicago area tonight, August 12th, 2014. First saw this on Beer Temple with Chris Quinn from Chicago, when it apparently was not yet in bottles. Got this bottle in Asheville, NC and have been carrying it with me. I thought it was appropriate. Love this one. Perhaps my favourite of the Gose’s so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice. A little lacking on sourness, but great mineral character."
"This poured yellow and with a scant head of white foam. The nose was sweet with wheat and had some earthy coriander on it. It smelled like it had some tartness and some salt to it. Sweet lemon peel. The taste was malt forward. Sweet wheat which was dry and a bit crisp. But the coriander made it earthy and taste heavy. The lemon was sweet and I wanted to taste tartness. There was no saline or salty finish and it did not finish dry. It tasted like cereal grain after a while and was bland and dull. I did not think this was a good representation of the style. Even for a wheat beer it drank blandly and without much flavor."
"A different take on the style. A great session brew, although not exactly on point for a gose."
""
""
"On a side note: I really like the artwork, layout & printing of the label. Very cool."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has some refreshing properties; however the salt is only noticeable in the finish."
"O – I can tell that this is a very complex beer, and there are a lot of different things that seem to stand out. It’s like drinking a very light wheat beer, but that sour edge makes it a really great variation. I actually expected more salt flavor, but am glad it wasn’t there. Because of the low alcohol content, this is something I could sit and drink a LOT of."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's ok, but it just tastes like a salty wheat beer."
""
""
"Bright orange color, medium white head. Aroma is sweet, peppery, spicy, flowery, and generally pleasant. Very likable thus far.... Taste is crisply dry, floral and spice, nice white bread malty, and well balanced. Just a touch of salt makes things interesting. No overwhelming flavors and nicely light. Perfect for Spring and very easy to drink."

"Nothing like a locally-made six-pack of gose on the shelves, right? Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear brassy gold topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, coriander, orange zest, lemon zest, and a touch of black pepper. The taste brings in more of the same, a mild-but-still-definitely-very-present tartness pervading throughout, accentuating and complementing the wheat. The body is a strong light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty solid gose, something I could easily drink plenty of in the coming months."

"Fairly on point for the style, easy to drink, solid but I like the one Choc makes more"
""
"T: Lemon, a touch of coriander and some ginger right away. The middle hovers between a sort of grainy, grassy hop bitterness and a salty sourness. Finish shows a kiss of salt, wheat and some grainy sweetness. Ends very clean. I could definitely drink a lot of this."
"On the whole, an easy-going and eminently drinkable beer that nevertheless displays enough complexity and nuance to remain interesting. I could see myself drinking a lot of this over the summer."

"Overall a pretty enjoyable and solid brew."
"O- This is my first American Gose and I am finding it very enjoyable and easy to drink. Not as salty or tart as the few German Goses I have tried. Worth picking up."
""
"O-This is a nice take on the style. Unlike some American Gose, this doesn't overwhelm with salt, but lets it hang out in the background. It is very easy to drink and pretty refreshing, but there is just enough intrigue and flavor to keep my palate from getting bored. I will try more of this, I think."
""

"Overall - I am really growing to love this style, and this one is pretty accessible. I am not a session beer kind of guy, but I could drink a lot of these."

"A great summer beer. Very easy to drink."

"An enjoyable if not restrained gose. More of a session or crisp-tasting beer than a super salty beer. I would like a bit more salt taste, but still this is enjoyable and smooth, with fine mouthfeel. A bit mellow in aroma, but again this beer is easy to drink and not off-putting in any way. Refreshing and worthy of more in the future."

"Poured into a Tallgrass Brewing cervoise glass produces a fizzy finger of white head. Hazy straw colored body. On the nose a bit of musty tang, wheat, peppery yeast and some salt. Smells saison like. Taste is peppery yeast, some lactic tang, restrained salt, lemon tartness and a nice wheat finish. Low carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Very creamy and smooth. Prickly and slightly dry. I'm no expert on gose but the tartness and salt are quite restrained. However, it's refreshing and will for sure be a good summer beer. If you told me this was some experimental saison I'd believe you."

"Milky yellow topped with a thin head that drops to a creamy ring. Aromas of grainy wheat, lemon, lactic funkiness, spicy/leafy notes, and a little coriander. Tart, tangy flavor upfront followed by a load of fresh wheat toastiness and citrus. Coriander sweetness, a slight mineral quality, peppercorn, less lacto funk than the smell. Fairly light and crisp with only a bit of pucker lingering. An interesting, quite refreshing beer. Soft, tart, and savory..."

"$3 for a 12 oz bottle. Pair with an herb chicken salad"
""
"12oz bottle that I believe I paid $3.99 for which if this is gose then i guess they priced it to be in line with imported gose? Either way its not cheap for a bottle of 4% wheat beer. Appearance is a hazy yellow-orange, ok head. Aroma is a slight bit of bile at first which must be from teh lacto? Maybe not. The bile subsides and then a decent wheat aroma takes over. The flavor was quite mild and easy to drink, wheat and yeast but i didn't really taste any saltiness at all."
"Pours a murky light yellow-orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, wheat, lemon, and coriander aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour wheat, lemon, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and fairly light and refreshing."
""
""
"O-Love the labels and also love the fact that they brewed a Gose in a 12 oz. bottle at a very reasonable price. The beer itself isn't half bad as well."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with minimal head. The nose starts with a heavy cereal malt/ wheat component. Very bready with waves of lemon and notes of coriander. The predominant note is grain. The flavor starts with a light dry and tart note and quickly gives way to heavy bready wheat notes. The finish brings in some citrus notes and is quite dry. Mouthfeel is very light and highly carbonated. This is a very refreshing and easy drinking beer. It reminds me a bit of a berliner with less tartness and more malt character. Definitely not your average run of the mill 6 pack brew."

"The pour is a slight haze golden yellow with a one inch white head. The aroma is husky wheat grain, lemon tart citrus and sea salt. The taste is the wheat character, lemon citrus, grass coriander and a bit of salt in the finish. Tasty stuff. The palate is light to medium bodied, soft carbonation and the lightly tart clean finish. Really nice use of lacto in a lower ABV wheat beer."
"beautiful packaging here, and we need more six packs of gose, regardless of their price (this one was a bit absurd). the beer is bright blonde yellow, with very little cloudiness and a short lived half inch of white airy bubbles. it smells less like coriander and more like a short lacto fermentation, tart, but not real dry. the wheat malt is also hopelessly plain, not bready, not fresh or seasonally interesting, but generic and unremarkable in aroma and in flavor. fortunately, there is enough else going on in this one. the corriander is more like seed than fresh herb, toasty and clean, not perfumy or overdone in any way. the salt adds more body and minerality than flavor, but its presence is there throughout. strange yeast in the finish, not as tart as it could be, with some sweetness left over. light alcohol makes it real easy drinking, but more robust carbonation and a dryer finish could really push it to the next level. an enjoyable and sessionable gose in a format i appreciate, but this prices me out a bit, and frankly isnt any better than most other american made goses out there."
"O: I bought this thinking it was a Berliner Weisse, but still enjoyed it quite a bit and would buy again."
"Pour is bright golden yellow, hazy, with a tight white head. Nose has a fair bit of wheat malt, notes of lemon, strong salt aroma and a touch of iodine. Taste is more integrated and cleaner. Lemon is brighter and most prominent flavor. Wheat is blended underneath and the salt is very light through the back. Very light body with a soft feel and inviting carbonation. Very easy sipper."
""
"Overall - A very solid offering from Off Color. My first and only brew from them, but would definitely want to try more from them."

""

"Lactobacillus isn't normally the brewer's friend, but it shows up in this beer in spades. I'm not a sour beer noob, but I'm not a big fan either. I have to say that I bought this not expecting a sour beer. I probably should have known better when I saw wheat beer and coriander on the label. (Both traditional ingredients in Gose.) I've certainly had much better sour beer, but this wasn't awful. Any brewer willing to play with lacto is rather courageous and for that they should be commended. Also, not the beer to have after eating chili."
"O: Quite light and refreshing. Tart funkiness adds character and flavor."
""
""
"D: not too shabby. nice to see a new brewery tackle this style which not that many American crafts are tackling. fair effort. not sure how old this bottle was, but I wish they would do some coding. worth a try regardless."
"O: I am often skeptical of Laffler's beers as I find them to be more of an expression of his ego than his ability, but I must admit this was a pleasant beer that was better than expected."
"M: Lighter side of medium on the body."

"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a slightly hazy light golden amber with a fine half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of wheat, coriander, light lemon citrus. Flavor starts with sweet wheat, coriander and citrus, then transitions and finishes with increasing light lemon and lactic tartness. Light bodied with great active carbonation. A very pleasant and refreshing gose. There is a nice wheat base and the mild tartness in the finish is deftly done and fit with the other flavors. I really like this gose qit a bit; probably a bit less tart than traditional, but more to my taste. Nice balance."

"This was my first goes and didn't know what to exactly expect. I must say that this beer is deliciously refreshing. The sourness was present bit not at all overpowering. Very slightly tart with some coriander, tang, and wheat/earthiness coming through. Head was thin and lacing was thin too. It was missing something taste wise. Was a very pleasant straw yellow with lots of carbonation. Carbonation seemed right for the style but could have been calmed down a little. Overall a very good beer and look forward to drinking it this summer."

"(O)- Gose is still a bit new to me only having tried a few of them, but this is really enjoyable and best consumed colder than room temperature."

"Weird beer, smelled interesting but doesn't really deliver what I'm looking for on the palate. It sounds rather interesting and is certainly a sessionable beer and I would drink it if offered. However, its not something I'll seek out again."

"Gose seems to be making the rounds of America's breweries and this is one of the best examples I've had. Soft coriander, tangy wheat, and a drying saltiness make for an immensely refreshing and slammable beer. Good job fellas!"

"O: Really basic, but nuanced in flavor and complexity at the same time. All the flavors going on at the same time were nice and I'd happily have this again."

"A very simple easy to drink brew. Not a lot of character but refreshing on a hot day."

"Overall: Very impressed with this beer. Very true to style, just the right amount of tart and saltiness. A very refreshing beer on a hot summer day to be sure. Can't wait to have more."

"O: Definitely my favorite beer of the night. A bit of sweetness mixed with the mild tartness makes this interesting, yet it remains drinkable and moreish. Looking forward to this in distributed format."
