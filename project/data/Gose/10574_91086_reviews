"A little more salty than sour. Overall mild and refreshing."
""
""
"I poured the beer into a regular hefeweizen glass.  Cloudy once I poured the yeast into the beer.  The head is white and thick.  The smell is grassy, not what I expected from a spruced gose.  The taste on the other hand, is just what expect and great.  It's got the saltiness I expect, and a little something extra which I think is the spruce.  Overall, a good beer."
"Moderately tart."

"Not tart, not salty, not tasty"
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink since both the sourness and the brininess of this beer are not as intense as some of the others in the style. Sessionable and it would be excellent on a hot summer afternoon."
""
"Very smooth for a gose. I got some stone fruit flavors to accompany the sourness. Very refreshing."
""
""
"Poured into my teku glass."
""
""
"Sweet for a Gose and slightly bready (like a Kolsch), not very sour. However, certainly light and refreshing."
""
"This zippy light-honey colored offering, is quite literally bursting with a fragrant layering of peach, mango and spring flowers. Focused and refined where the  residual sweetness is playing off the lemony tartness and traditional salinity. Refreshing and elegant overall even if rather hollow and short."

"It's refreshing in a weird way, but it's not like a kolsch or helles lager on a hot day. Different, to say the least."
""
"Taste: Slightly thin, sour, salty, a little more carbonation than usual"
""
""
"Reeks of bready malt, but luckily there's some lime and sharp peach and grapefruit in the flavor to add complexity. Floral notes are a nice complement."
""
"And with its dry and racy finish, the palate is left refreshed and the thirst is quenched to near perfection- just enough acidity to wash the palate. It trails with a soft mineral quality and faint citrus peel, much like gin-and-tonic refreshers. Echoes of wheat return deep in aftertaste."

"O-This beer is a relatively traditional and simple example of the style. It drinks easy and doesn't blow you away with tartness or salt or whatever. It fits the bill on a hot summer day, but there are better gose beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad Gose, but I have had better. Worth trying, might pock up again."
""
""
""
"O: This isn't a bad beer, but not a particularly great example of a style that's really starting to catch on. Worth a try, but it wouldn't be a go-to beer for me."

"Pours a hazy straw color with dense white head, settles to a thin layer; sheet of lace for a few inches down the glass. Smell: grape juice, spice, wheat cracker, citrus and earthy notes Somewhat fruity but no real promise of acid. Taste: interesting... some fruit sweetness (nectarine, grape) into pine and citrus, into snappy lactic + wheat, spice, then finishing semi-dry with residual lemon, a little salt, and lingering herbal note. Not as summertime-crushable as others, but this one packs a good amount of flavor, nice."

"Overall - A pretty good gose, the spruce is subtle but a nice touch."

"This beer's very interesting to me. I find it enjoyable, but just like the sour wheat ale I had recently, not sour to the American tongue. There are a medley of flavors within and I enjoy them, but I do find that this beer to closely resembles a hefeweizen rather than boldly proclaiming itself a gose. I suppose I'd like a little more explosiveness from the salt and spices. Typical American."

"Overall the spruce flavor is not at all what I expected and almost seems to hold back this beer from being great.For $5 I can't complain."

"The flavor  has a pleasing minerality. Some coriander and a hint of wheat collaborate with juniper berries. Crisp and slightly tart. I like it."
"A twist on the style, with the spruce nettles. The nose on this gives such an interesting perfume that you think you are tasting something that you are not."

"My first Gose! Bottle to tulip. Cloudy straw yellow pour with fluffy white head. Aroma of straw, honey, sweet malts, tart banana. Flavor is a pilsner and hefe combo, with clove, banana, citrus, honey flavors. Don’t get a whole lot from the spruce, though I don’t know what the base flavor of the style tastes like. Slight yeast funk and clean finish. High carbonation with light to medium mouthfeel. Not bad and easy to drink."
"I believe I had this on tap many months ago, but I remember being enamored with the bright woody, tree sap like flavors that came with the funk. I really hope to find more goses made like this - it's simultaneously crisp and light enough to drink, but the flavor is really complex and all over the place in comparison to your everyday beer, or, hell, your everyday sour. Happy with what this brewery is doing with old, nearly forgotten German styles. This is a good example of what they do well and differently."

"O: A nice tasting beer. There's only a bit of spruce (in the nose), and the acidity could be upped a bit."
""
"Tasty - one of those beers that would be excellent in a 6 pack on a hot summer night."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with medium-low levels of carbonation, resulting in a lightly effervescent mouthfeel that settles in appropriate time to a slightly heavier, smoother, lightly foamy mouthfeel that seems appropriate for the style."
""
""
""
"O - a refreshing summer beer. I didn't pick up any notes of spruce, so I will fly to Germany and demand a refund."
""
"This gose pours a very pale orange, semi-transparent at first but then turns cloudy from the sediment in the bottle. Starts out with a nice big white head, about three fingers worth. No lacing, but good retention all the way down. Smells of lemon, hay, coriander, and just a little bit funky. Overall, not much aroma. It's funky when it first goes in the mouth..doesn't come across as tart but there's definitely an acidic quality to it. There's lemon, orange, more coriander, just a hint of salt and no bitterness at all. As the beer warms the coniferous notes come to life and reminds me of a mountain forest which is amazing. This gose drinks very easily and is a refreshing beer. It's pretty unique but good for anytime of the year."

"Smooth feel, lightly astringent though I wouldn't really call it tart. Very mild coriander, supple wheat, light apple ester from the yeast. Creamy and light bodied. Light papery oxidation note, not too distracting. This seems very traditional, simple but easy to drink. Not especially tart or salty though, and not picking up much if any spruce in this bottle."
""
""
"O - Overall, let down by this one was expecting more pine or spruce...mostly just sour wheat."
"Overall: very bland and simple. I cant get a feel for this genre. I always expect them to be more tart whereas this one is very mild."
"D - Not bad, it is less tart than I expected and the spruce is also fairly light. Drinkable but I'm not all that excited by it."

"O: Gose is not a style I'm very familiar with, and I don't think I'm alone in this. This is just the third or fourth example of the style I've had. It shows more restraint in both saltiness and tartness than others, but this is a good thing as it allows for more complexity to come through and ramps up the drinkability. The spruce is very subtle, and I like it in this role. It really isn't the oddity I was expecting (thought the rarity of the style makes it a bit of an eccentricity already). It's tough to rate to style when the style is this rare, but I enjoyed it and from what I can tell it is a well-made, balanced beer."
"a real oddity here, a spruced gose. possible the lightest colored and flavored beer ever. it pours almost perfectly clear, lighter than a Berliner, with a couple inches of white head. its so clear I can watch tv through it, unabated. the nose is light as anything, a touch of wheat malt and minerals, not spruce at all. the flavor has a slight lemon kick to it, and is fairly dialed down on the salt content, compared to some other german gose beers ive had he privilege of trying. the wheat malt appears to be cut with water in a 50 percent mix, and I only get a little spruce when I really focus. maybe its a mind game and its not there at all. maybe im tasting what I want to taste. who knows, this beer is so light on flavor its impossible to tell, although I don't dislike it at all. ultra light feel, too much so really, but it is refreshing for the style, since there isn't too much salt in the finish drying me out. carbonation is ample. overall a beer that just didn't have a lot of flavor to it, a stronger or more concentrated version would be welcomed here."

"Probably good with a salad or grilled veggies"
"Overall, not bad, not exceptional. A little odd, and I'm not sure whether or not it's better for it."
"Sweet and tart by equal proportions. Very smooth beer--seems to have an abundance of wheat. Soft on the palate, but not exactly rich. High level of carbonation. I do not detect any ""spruce"""
"By now, I've had several goses, but this may be the first one I've had that is actually German. Served in a Ommegang chalice, this was one attractive beer, cloudy, pale yellow, with a small but thick layer of white head, that retained until the end, and left some streaks of lacing on the glass when swirled. Aroma was a bit muted, notes of toasted wheat and light citrus. Taste of salted sourdough bread, lemon pith, slightly lactic. Probably wouldn't have stood up great on its own, but paired with some authentic kartoffelpuffer, it was drinking just fine. Smooth mouthfeel, light-medium body, soft carbonation, quite good overall."
""
"O: On the sweeter style for a gose, but it's certainly good. This is a style I've found a lot more examples recently, and for that I am quite thankful."
""
"O: This beer is quite quaffable. It's neither very sour nor salty so it is rather easy to drink compared to other beers in the style."
"Drinkability is high, a refreshing, balanced, mild gose. This is made to quench, not to ponder. Cranking up the lacto and salt might be more exciting, but not nearly as drinkable. I was expecting it to be more extreme, but it is nevertheless very well done."
"overall this is an incredibly balanced and enjoyable beer. I think it takes all the ingredients and does them all justice by not making any of them more bold than another. I think I would prefer it more tart but that being said I have not had a gose that really nails it with the salt and cardamom"

"This spruced Gose pours a light bodied and cloudy light gold in color with a two finger bright white head. The nose is light with moderate German yeast character, light lemon peel, and a touch of spruce. The flavors mimic the nose with light and slowly acidic lemon peel with nice and approachable German yeast and a slight spruce/menthol character that shows its head in the aftertaste. There is just a touch of salt but nothing over the top. It's like drinking a light Hefe on the beach in Florida. The spruce isn't bold but its there in the finish. It drinks light in body and is very sessionable. This would make for a great German session beer for summer. Overall this is probably the best Gose I've had yet. It's a really nice beer for the style."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and some perfume-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly salty flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."
