"Not my cup of tea.  I am sure if my palette were considerably different I might have enjoyed it."

"Gose is not my favorite beer style....far from it.....this one however is palatable.  The beer poured clear with pink hue and white head that is not lacing.  The scent carries floral notes.  The taste is tart with coriander spice.  Themouthfeel is lighter in body with subtle carbonation.  Overall this is a probably the best Gose I've had....just don't like the style."
"Pours an almost clear, pinkish pale amber producing 2 fingers of effervescent, shortlived, foamy, white (faintly pink) head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is tart lactic acid, coriander & brine with a pungent hint of vinegar & something faintly strawberry like; malt profile is low but I detect a little wheat & a floral component that might be from the hibiscus flowers(?); crisp & dry. Taste opens fruity (green apples, strawberry & lemon/lime) & dry with salinity & lactic acid tartness, coriander, thin wheat & a floral hint. Less tart, but peppery in the finish; crisp, and dry in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with high carbonation, a little prickly, puckering, mouthwatering & very dry."

"The first Boulevard brew I've thoroughly enjoyed."

"Smell is a floral, sweet tart, small note of coriander. Head has very little retention with even less tracing. Taste is a slam of tart sour up front with a smoother flowery middle and ends with a unique salty dry finish. Drop a couple of sweet tarts into a salty dog and muddle a flower and you have this beer. Overall unique and interesting, I'm not a big sour fan to begin with though."
"Not bad, but a bit underwhelming. I was hoping for more sea salt, or more sour, or more flowers, or moreâ€¦.something. All the various ingredients are tame & forgiving, & I like my bitches, I mean beer, aggressive & forward. Decent enough."

"O: Overall a delightfully refreshing brew."

"12 oz. bottle tasted blind as part of a Better Beer Authority shoot, unknown brewing/packaging date, poured into a BBA large-bottom snifter and drank over 30 minutes"
""
""
"Really enjoyed this one as it is one of the better domestic examples of the style I have had.  I like my goses salty and this one delivers.  The base beer is a great combination of orange, peach, and lots of florals. Will be getting more of this."

"Pinkish in body with fleeting white head. Aroma of sea salt and hibiscus. Tastes of sour notes, coriander, sea salt, and flowers. Light bodied with zesty carbonation. Refreshing and mouth puckering."

"Pours a clear, red/gold color.  1/4 inch head of a white color.  Decent retention and decent lacing.  Smells of tartness, sourness, hint of hop, hint of pale malt, and yeast.  Fits the style of a Gose.  Mouth feel is sharp and tart, with a high carbonation level.  There is also a noticeable dryness.  Tastes of tartness, sourness, hint of hop, hint of pale malt, and yeast.  Overall, good aroma, body, and blend."
""
""
"Aroma and taste were unusual too. I was not expecting a mild sour.  The Gose saltiness was there but the main flavor was a mild grapefruit sourness.  I attribute the sweeter floral attributes to the hibiscus.  Overall not bad.  Light nicely carbonated mouthfeel with  a mild sour ""tang"".  Don't know if I would call this a Gose, but I would enjoy a few in the summertime."
"Surprisingly pleased with this one. Its not a very typical Gose but has all the characteristics slightly rearranged, and then augmented by soothing hibiscus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours like fizzy pink lemonade. Aroma is grainy, lemony, and lactic, with sharp acetic notes. Coriander is evident, but the hibiscus is very subtle.Flavor is puckeringly sour, with sharp citric acid, a lactic character mid palate, and an acetic aftertaste. It's a bit difficult to pick out the floral notes. A very nice sour, but hibiscus is too subtle."
""
""
""
"First impression is the orange-rosy hue that fills the glass, with a light head that clears out quickly.  The first punch the Gose packs is the Hibiscus, fruity flavor that is incredibly smooth.  Once that taste hits your palate, the salt taste comes right behind it.  The salt taste is slightly overbearing, breaking up the overall balance of the Gose; however, it doesn't completely disrupt the hibiscus aftertaste that finishes the sip.  I would prefer this beer in the summer, as the first beer of the day.  I cannot say I would pour two in one sitting, mostly because my palate doesn't savor fruity-like tastes drink after drink.  This is definitely worth a try come next summer!"
""
""
""
"Not a bad offering.  I'd grab it again as a light session-able beer.  I've had a few Gose now, and this one is middle of the road tartness, light on saltiness."
""
""
""
"Reddish amber tinted with a touch of pink covered with an initially large frothy head that quickly disintegrates to not much more than an uneven covering.  Smell is sour and mineral in nature...flowers, wheat, berries, and a general earthy funk.  Flavor starts with a flash of flowers and grass before becoming more berry and grapefruit, sweet and tart, finishing with brine, fresh wheat, and soft spice.  Not as sour as some, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Medium-light, slick, and drying which keeps it very drinkable despite the mild carbonation.  Well done."
"O-A good gose that just needs to be a tad more tart/sour to improve the beer."

"O- sour salty and highly drinkable, just what you need in a goes.  Not the best goes I've had, but pretty close"

"Clear pink pour with a small white head. Very weak aroma of grass and hibiscus. Slightly sour and fruity taste with a little salt. Can taste berries, wheat and flowery hibiscus. Very thin body and medium carbonation. Fruity and tart finish."

"The beer pours a translucent jolly rancher looking rose color with no sediment, minimal visible carb, and a thin, wispy white head. The nose has tart, perfume-like floral/tropical fruit notes, followed by saline, funk (minimal), and a grainy sweetness. It drinks with more salt and tart fruitiness upfront than expected, which is amplified by the beer's carbonation, and has a slightly fruity, lingering grain finish. the mouthfeel is lowly acidic, reasonably carbonated, and light bodied. It does a great job satisfying my expectations for the style - crisp, tart grain presence, mildly fruity, some funk, pleasant finish - and could easily be consumed by the liter. I'm disappointed this wasn't available until fall (in my area) - it would have been a great summer go-to."

"Love it. Crisp, salty, little sour"
""
"Overall (4.0), a great take on the style, but nothing really like traditional goses. The only other take on the style that included hibiscus was the version from Widmer Bros, and it wasn't really very good at all. I had no trouble killing a six pack of this, and will be sad to see it go--it turned out to be a really nice, refreshing summer beer."
""
"Nice salty crisp flavor. Golden honey color. Nice head that doesn't remain too long. Salty orange nose. Solid."

"i liked this one a lot, its got a great pink color to it, really bright and some haze to the beer under the purest white head. an aroma less of hibiscus and more of tart lactic acid and coriander. hibiscus is easy to overdo, so i commend it for its delicacy on that front, taste too. i find this being neither sour or salty, more just tart and full bodied and mineral based in the finish. the salt adds body to it, and lengthens the finish, but its not drying on the palate. the hibiscus is mild and plays well with the tartness, balancing and complimenting one another. what i like most is the carbonation and the way this is something totally different. its expressive with the bubbles, almost hard to hold on the tongue, so fizzy, it really works in what would otherwise seem like a pretty heavy take on the style. fun stuff, im glad i got one instead of six though, its not as tart and clean as i like my gose to be."

"Drinks very easy,  they should do this a Summer release, so refreshing"
""
"Floral, fruity, sour patch kids candy in a bottle is really what it reminded me of, without the sugar. I felt it tasted less refreshing and more sour. If you are a fan of sours then this would be a cheap alternative. If you are interested in trying this style of beer, do. I really think it will be happening in the future. At least I hope so. Its a nice late summer beer. Complex, but not as good to me as say Anderson Valley. I would love to check out Westbrook's version."
"O: This beer was very enjoyable but would have been great if it came out in the beginning of the summer - would have been perfectly refreshing to combat the real heat of summer rather than early fall football season. Enjoyable and easy to drink."

"Reddish pink in color with barely a trace of fingernail thick white head.  Aroma of salt and herbal hibiscus flowers is very unique and intense.  The taste is very salty with some coriander in the front of the palate,but the hibiscus flower does a nice job of keeping that from being overwhelming.  The mouth is very salty and carbonated."

"O: 4.05: Great, refreshing beer. Don't pass it up if you can find it. It's at least worth a try."

"A great combination of flavors collide in a light, spritzy, refreshing beer. This is a summer sipper to say the salt. I would certainly pick this up again in the future."

"Sour and salty.  Can't taste the flowers, they just turn it pink.  On a hot day I could crush these forever.  I'm crushing your beer.  Crush ! Crush! Crush!"

"-Bottle- Pours a pretty, pinkish/orange color with an airy, bright white head that has a twinge of pink to it. The head slowly fizzles and pops away, leaving not much lacing. Aroma is floral, fruity and slightly tart. Coriander. Rose hops. The flavor reminds me of pink grapefruit. Tart and slightly briny. A bit of unripe berries. The floral notes and the coriander are very important to the flavor. Surprisingly medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Licking the lips resurrects the saltiness and tartness. I liked this beer. Can't wait to give this to someone and explain all the wacky stuff it's brewed with."

"Overall: One of the more consistent gose's in Kansas City; not too much and surprisingly refreshing."

"It's not a Labor Day cookout party without Settlers of Catan and a gose.  This one pours a mostly clear rose (or, perhaps, hibiscus) color topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises lemon zest, coriander, light cracked wheat, light ruby red grapefruit zest, and a hint of sweet flowers.  The taste brings in more of the same, the lemon and grapefruit bringing in some understandable tartness.  There's a vague sense of salinity, but nothing firm manifests itself.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable brew, one I'm glad my local beer guy convinced me to buy a sixer of."

"Once I got over the hibiscus color ... Very reddish orange and tasted the beer i was pleasantly surprised.  Good amount of sour, reasonable amount of salt,  all in all a great Gose."

"Overall: a good and tasty beer, but not quite as tart and missing a few qualities I look for in a gose. Certainly a good drinkable warm weather drink."
""
""
""
"Surprisingly good attempt at a difficult style. Pinkish hue with no lacing. Tart and salty-fruity aroma. Fairly complex flavor profile. A bit sweeter than the average Gose, but perhaps that is intended for an audience that may not have tried a gose before. At any rate, it serves as an accessible introduction to the style and offers a twist on a classic. Very affordable, at least in Missouri."

"O:  Overall, a nice mildly sour beer.  I prefer that it's less salty than the other gose I'd tried.  Definitely a nice, refreshing beer for a hot summer day and one I hope they start releasing annually.  It's truly one of the unique styles of beer, and it works well with hibiscus, which I think is a great addition to lighter style beers."
"That said, this is a solid beer. Turns out I love hibiscus who knew!"
"Bottle poured into tulip glass. Aroma is floral, sour fruit, and earthy. Appearance is a beautiful reddish color. Taste is salty up front, opposite of other goses' followed by some tartness and finishes earthy and salty. Light body with good carbonation. Overall enjoyable. I'd like a bit more tartness but still really good."
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste is similarly tart with a fruity floral note from the hibiscus, bright, crisp, and dry in the aftertaste. Easily drinkable and light bodied. Overall a great summer session beer that should've come out in May. 4/4.25/4.25"

"O- I think the usage of hibiscus is very smart. Using an ingredient like that brings a tea like quality that works with the very slight tartness. Not as salty or tart as others of the style. Much more restrained take, executed deftly."
