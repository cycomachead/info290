"To me it tastes like a glass of water with a splash of beer and a tsp of salt. Certainly not worth the $ for me."

"It's a real interesting beer, but it comes off just surprisingly too fruity for my tastes, and also has a radler quality to it.  It is however a very good beer, but not usually what I look for in this style.  I would however recommend this though for fans of the style to give it a go."

"O-This is a pretty tasty beer. It manages to pack a fair bit of flavor into a low ABV package without tasting gimmicky or ""tarted up."" It is more aggressive than classic German gose, but less salty than many popular examples of the style, e.g., Westbrook. I actually like it this way. I could drink a few of these on a summer afternoon without any problem. My only knock would be the price...this guy is a bit spendy to drink in volume."
"Refreshing light sour ale. Easy drinking on a late summer afternoon at the cottage."

"There are no fitter descriptors than balanced and delicate, with nice coriander, herbal,  dill and citric notes abound. The palate - the real challenge in gose-brewing - is involving and expertly achieved; The balance between the salinity, acidity, ABV and sourness make this a memorable quencher and really set this one apart. At the tongue the aromatics are restrained but fair and fitting overall."
"one of the better gose beers i have ever had, its so bright and herbal, with notes of green tea, sweet lemon balm, coriander seed, lime leaf, and something more floral even, hibiscus or something. its complex but its clean, minimally tart for the style, just very light and drinkable. the salt here is nice too, gives the beer some body and a nice mineral character. with an abv this low too, its one i can drink plenty of, and for what it is, the price isnt bad at all. i am surprised to look and see i havent had any beers from these guys before, i see their stuff around periodically, but have always been turned off by high prices. this one is really really fair. the flavors here are as bright and summery and herbaceous as i have seen in the style, carbonation is fantastic, and the wheat malt base is very flavorful. exceptional example of the style, a nice little twist of being different in here too. i need to find some more!"

"Final Grade: 4.07, an A-. I have not had many sours, and while part of that is due to their typically high price, I also do not really enjoy the taste of a lot of them. Hors Série Gose is one of the few that has been able to break that trend, as the saltiness is the perfect cure for this one's assertively acidic flavour profile. Now I am pumped to try a few more examples of this style - hopefully its growing popularity will encourage other brewers to give this style a shot. Highly recommended."

"Hazed pale blonde colour, ring of white head, no lace. Smell is spicy with notes of lemon and green apple, bit of salt water, sour lemon candy, bit of yeast and wheat. Taste has quite a bit of lemon-lime initially, citrus fruit with a salty-sour mid palate, touch of sweet lemon drops, finishes dry. High-medium spritzy carbonation, light body. Good stuff, a nice easy drinking beer, light and flavourful, quite refreshing."

"D: This is a very good gose and I’ll be picking up more if I can. The barnyard-like qualities shown through over a nice salty base."
""
"O: By far the saltiest gose I’ve had by far, this is unique.   Got it in Toronto, drank in New Hamburg, ON, Aug 24th 2014.  I think they’ve done a great job.  The bottle and label itself are very cool.  Relatively light, sessionable beer.  Good for a warm day."
"This is a pleasant Gose, very drinkable, and less salty than Westbrook, Anderson Valley, or Leipziger Gose; that may make it more palateable to those who do not like gose-style beers.  The appearance and body are typical of goses while the aroma seems a little weak.  Still, this is a very pleasant, highly sessionable beer."

"A salty and refreshing gose, decent spice and florals open up to delve into some lively complexity here. Not too sour, maybe some light tartness to it but that was about all I registered. Creaminess from the wheat is there in body but a lot of the flavour is commanded by the salt. A tasty and light session beer, enjoy the complex tart fruit and floral character mixed with a strong earthy spice. Well balanced as it delivers a long but crisply satisfying finish. Good session beer, though the salty brine was a bit much for the most part and it did have a distinctly saltwater character to it initially. Worth trying."

"Overall - while I have very little experience with this style, I can see the appeal if you are feeling something different on any given day. I would definitely try this again."

"O - A decent attempt at this style.. It's worth trying once but I will not buy it again. I much prefer the Ritterguts Gose."
"Might have again; worth a shot if you see it."
""
"o: i was really excited to crack open my first gose ever and it didn't disappoint. the first sip was ridiculously sour, but of course there are many other dimensions to this beer, and they all opened up as i continued to drink it. it's funky, sour, and salty, but it's also light, tasty, and has a fantastic (albeit subdued) fruit profile. give this one a try"

"To my knowledge the folks at Les Trois Mousquetaires are born and bred Quebecois, but they have the technical virtuosity and detailed craftsmanship of the best German brewers. Add Gose to a list that already included Doppelbock, Maibock, Rauchbier, Hopfenweisse, and Oktoberfest and you've got the best German lineup made outside of Germany. Hands down."

"Overall: get a sense of purity and cleansing - like this beer is doing something good for you. Certainly doing something good for my tastebuds. Great for summer afternoons"
""
"O: I'm sorry but maybe Gose just isn't my style. I poured it. I'm sure this is a great example of the style but it's just not for me."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"O/D - Very interesting beer. Lot's of different flavours and interesting elements going on. Sour, salty, sweet. A good beer that I could drink a fair bit of on a hot day."

"Overall, very refreshing, but the salt is not a plus for me (yes, I know that is the style) and the lemonade flavour is heavy. I am not very familiar with gose, but this was more tart than I expected."
""
""
""
"O: Very nice balance of tart sourness and saltiness proving to be an example of the style."

"Tap: Poured a cloudy beige color ale with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of salt with light tart wheat malt notes Taste is a mix between some salt notes with light tart wheat notes and some light coriander notes. Body is quite full considering the low ABV with good carbonation. Quite refreshing though maybe a tad too salty for my taste buds."

"Body is hazy with the color a cross between peach and lemonade. Bit of a sourish wheat aroma. Flavor is of lemons, tart wheat and ripe peaches. Refreshing and quite good. Hope they bottle this sometime soon."
