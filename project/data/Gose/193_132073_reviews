"This beer blew my mind. I was confused and delighted by sip and sniff. Tingly delight."

"I really like this beer and have been drinking it a lot lately. Looking forward to drinking this in the summer. I can drink a bunch of them and not be feeling it too much and they are very refreshing. Solid beer and a good price for a sour in a can."
""
""
""
""
"A delicious, crisp, tart, salty, refreshing take on gose.  The blood orange is noticed but does not dominate.  Good salty/sour balance.  No fake/artificial flavor notes and not overly restrained like some takes.  A nearly perfect summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I'm a fan. It's unusual (in a good way) and has a refreshing quality.  It reminds me of Vichy-Celestins mineral water that I had in southern France."
""
""
"Fairly clean finish, dry middle. A pretty solid coating of the upper palate is the only strike against this brew though I didn't find the coriander either."

"below average brew in my opinion"

"Poured a clear orange body with a half-finger of bubbly white head. Overall impression of appearance is of a Gose in head, with the blood oranges shown in the color of the body. Scents of salt water, with an ocean-like quality, mingling with medium-light aromas of blood orange and spicy coriander and a light earth funk from the yeast and light lactic acid. Overall impression of aroma is of a typical Gose, true to form, but with a good use of blood orange to add an additional bright aroma to the beer. Quite nice. Flavor begins lightly sour, with notes of lactic acid with a plan yogurt quality, moderate saltiness, tangy wheat malt flavors at moderate levels and a light level of blood orange. Middle gains in sourness, with notes of lactic acid still providing the sourness, bright fruitiness of blood orange at moderate levels and a moderate level of saltiness and tangy wheat. Finish is highly tart with strong notes of lactic acid, moderate saltiness, a nice tangy wheat malt still present and a medium-light blood orange flavor. Aftertaste is tart with notes of lactic acid, grainy, tangy wheat malt and salt. Overall impression of flavor is of a classic Gose, tart, salty and true to style, but enhanced by tangy, sweet blood orange. A very refreshing flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light bodied with effervescent carbonation and puckering, drying mouthfeel that urges you to take another sip. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderful Gose that is true to style and very refreshing. Overall this is an amazing Gose. It is traditional in its base, but the blood orange takes the aroma and flavor to new levels and makes this a fine, refreshing beer. Fantastic."

"The pour is light orange with less head than "
"Pours a light colored peachy orange color that is cloudy and with a little head.  There is no lacing.  The odor is sour, citrus, orange, lemon, tangerine, sparkling, cognac, slight peach.  The taste is crisp, tart, sour at first but then fresh cut orange, lemon, grapefruit peel, no long aftertaste."
"Sour and refreshing at the same time.  A bit salty but not as much as I was expecting.  The look and smell not all that good but the sour tangy taste is different and enjoyable."
"Had in can.  When opened, there was a significant head.  Smells like sour orange.  Tastes the same, but more pungent and with a distinct saltiness.  Feels quite carbonated and rough on the teeth, much like soda.  There was also a weird grain or corn note in the aftertaste.  Probably true to the style, but I didn't like it and won't be having it again."

"Nice tart blood orange flavor with a salty finish."

"This is a gose on performance enhancers. The expected flavors are all turned up and the added citrus punch melds nicely with the generous lactobacillus treatment to yield ample pucker power."
""
""
""

""

"Tart and citrus seems to be the theme here and that's about right. First time with this style and may not be my speed. Very light (comes from their ""Session series) but very drinkable. This would be a great summer beer on a hot afternoon. You could definitely enjoy a couple or three and not feel bloated or buzzed. The blood orange adds a very nice citrus finish."
"Taste: On the tongue, bam! blam!, more and more sour, a blast and a half of fierce fruit. The tart attack never quits, it's a solid salvo that blasts anew, with each fresh sip. The lacto is hard at work here, spreading the sour. Lambics are so old-school, yesterday's news. It's fruity, it's dry, it's creamy and it's sour. What a truly magnificent beer this is. Bracing, refreshing, sweet and sour and everything nice."

"Pretty good, although one of the key things about blood oranges is the ""blood"" color, which is missing here. Otherwise, it is true to style as a gose. Appearance, other than the blood thing, was good, with a huge, though short lived, cream-colored foamy head, and a clear, honey amber color. Aroma was oranges, berries, lacto. Flavor's like nose, fairly balanced for the style, salt comes out more in the finish and is pleasant. Body's excellent. This is maybe the best, most drinkable gose I've ever had. Wish their oranges would've been bloodier."
""
""
""
"Way to tart, almost like it wasn't ripe."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a darned tasty beer. It's way citrusy for a gose, but if one isn't expecting that just from the name alone, one may be illiterate. It's definitely a repeater."
""
"Only slight hints of salt and acid. Focus is on the fruit which I like. Lots of tart orange."
"F- thin and dry"
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a minimal white head, no lacing.  Smell isntypical gose, fairly indescript, very little citrus.  The nose was somewhat misleading as thr taste is full of vibrant and unmistakable blood orange flavor that balances very well with the funky, minerally tartness of the base beer.  The feel is light and crisp with a lively carbonation.  Perfect summer session beer for anythong outdoors.  Refreshing and delicious."

"Overall, a crisp refreshing brew for a hot summer day, but definitely drink with a meal otherwise heartburn is a serious possibility with this."

"  Nice tart flavor from the orange and light flavors overall. But the salt overpowers the good flavors for me, whether or not that's correct for the style or not its still not pleasant for me."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can, into a Belgian tulip glass."
"Light, thin beer with juicy orange and a fizzy pop, candy sugar, orange jello, sweet tarts  sour taste."

"Cloudy, straw colored beauty with a sliver of white head that left quickly. Little carbonation. Tart fruit and an overall  lean aroma profile. Tart fruit pop on the front to the tongue. Blood orange in spades. Not much salt in comparison to the standard AV Gose. Clean. Bit fizzy on the palate, but refreshing for sure. Hint of lingering tartness. Really nice. Has my sour itch ready to scratch."
""
""
"The Crack! sent a spray of beer everywhere! It was overfilled and it was not as if the CAN were dented, either. I then began to question if it might be overly carbonated, but in CANducting an inverted Glug, it behaved nicely. I got a brief, fizzy finger of orangish-white head that quickly fizzed out of existence. Color was a slightly hazy Amber (SRM = > 7, "

"not my style. subdued sour, or super tart"
""

""
"O: Delicious, sessionable, and better than any other gose I've had. Its low price and easy availability makes it a no-brainer to try."
""
"I guess this just isnt my style.  I wasnt much of a fan of the original version.  The orange addition does little to change my mind."

"O: Tasty if you’re into the sourness, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you want a sour bomb."

"Taste like red bull but I like red bull good summer beer."

"Decent head to start. Quickly fades to nothing. Nothing at all. Not my thing. Looks kind of like a faded orange soda. Nose is tart, soap, with a hint of orange at the end. Taste is tart to start followed by some fruitiness. Has an aftertaste I don't love. It does have a nice, refreshing tarty crispness to it. I bet I would appreciate this beer a lot more on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"Starts with an amazing citrus flavor from the oranges.  Edns with mild tart with only some salt.  Back end could improve."
""
""
"This beer was way too sour."
"O- Very nice Gose. A major improvement over the base Gose from the same brewery."
""
""
"I have received this a couple times as an extra in trades and finally opened one.  Very pleasantly surprised,  wonderful blood orange smell and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really exceptional example of the style. Light saltiness right at the beginning and and the very end. Blood orange flavor is dominate yet not overpowering, additional flavors include peach and lime. Light cloudiness, moderately carbonated, all in all an exceptional beer for sour lovers."
""
"The taste is salt, blood orange, some peach, and light pilsner malt.  The salt is present in the beginning and the finish.  The blood orange adds a different type of sweetness to the beer.  Really tasty and one I will revisit."
"So good. So crushable."
""
"Note: I drink this from the can, so I can't accurately judge the appearance of the drink itself."
"Sour, but not super sour. Light acidic blood orange flavor"

"O:  This was my first foray into the Gose style....and I liked it!  It's almost like a Berliner in that it's a sour that is easy to drink.  I loved it and will be seeking this out especially for the summer.  Well done."
"Overall one of the sourest yet smoothest beers in a while and at 2 dollars a pop it will make any sour beer fan happy! I would get it again seems like a great summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an outstanding use of blood oranges in a beer; choosing a Gose as the beer style to add blood oranges to was a great ""thinking outside of the box"" kind of idea. Its a cool way to americanize this not so frequently brewed german beer style. This is by far the most creative and well done beer by this brewery that I have tried.  It would be cool if they made a series of fruited Gose beers and please keep packing the beer in a can!"

"Had on tap at Amsterdam Cafe"

"Only downside I could possibly see was the lack of a head. Even with a semi-hard pour I got an almost non-existent head that dissipated within seconds. I don't really care though because the taste more than made up for that!"
"Malty smell with a bit of orange; first taste has a slight amount of orange then finishes with the perfect amount of sour; great gose!"
""
"Small quick dying head leaves no lacing on the glass above a washed out straw golden colored beer. Looking at this beer before taking a sip of it I wasn't expecting anything more than a Shock Top tasting beer.  Having said that I was slightly surprised that this beer has a better taste than the look and aroma has to offer.  This beer comes with a slight sourish taste without much of the advertized orange and I liked that better, although it takes a sip or three to appreciate the taste it grows on the taste buds."

"12oz. can served in a shaker pint.  Pours a dull orange hue a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, pink-tinged, one inch white head that quickly sizzles and pops as it dissipates into a fizzy band around the shoulders.  Blood oranges are very apparent in the nose - it's almost reminiscent of Fanta orange cola.  Saltiness is evident from the first quaff and the blood orange is a bit diminished in the flavor profile; coming off spritzy and citrusy.  Mouthfeel is light and lively with a kiss of acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks.  I've only had this style a couple of times and they all have left a slightly different impression.  That said, I found this enjoyable and look forward to visiting it again during warmer weather."

"The typical Anderson Valley Gose delivers very well but the deliverance of oranges really gives this a shot in the arm. There's very little saltiness and the sweetness is tempered, what you have is a delicious beer with an amazing drinkability."
"Orange body with tart taste.  One of my favorite beer styles."
""
"Overall- a really enjoyable gose.  I would go out of my way to drink this again."
""
"At this point, Gose not my thing."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good beer - if you like sour citrus. It offers enough fruitiness to entice sour beer neophytes while still offering an interesting beer experience for more seasoned drinkers. An excellent alternative to the ubiquitous shandies."
""
"O: near challenging tartness yet delicious and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my cup of tea. This is my first dabble in this style so not really knowing what to expect here except for some reviews and the description on the can. I can taste the blood orange along with wheat malts a big tart flavor comes in halfway with a little saltiness. Too tart for my liking but I gave a good review because I think that is what this style should be. Cheers"
"Tasted from draft at The Vine on January 31, 2015."

"Smells amazing, fizzes out when can is opened"

"O: Fantastic beer, I think I found my new substitute for when Westbrook Gose is not in season.  This will be  staple in my fridge.  4.5"
"Apricot gold color with thin white head (on draft);orange juice nose;tart and salty with orange juice flavor; lite mouthfeel with goo carbonation; tart, salty orange juice finish; lite and refreshing."
""
"Why not?  This stuff pours a clear straw-brass topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises orange zest, lemon peel, very light biscuit, and a kiss on each cheek, one from Ginger and one from Lime.  We're popular.  The taste centers on tart blood orange and lemon zest, but also in the mix are mild ginger and a vague sweetness (one that underflows everything), along with a twinge of brine in the aftertaste.  The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium (leaning toward the former, though), with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.  Overall, a very enjoyable gose that doesn't overdo the tartness, maintaining a high degree of drinkability.  I'm not sure if I prefer this one over the regular gose, but I can say that I wouldn't turn down either were they offered to me.  Good times."
"Crisp, refreshing. Great summer beer."
""
"Really crisp & refreshing beer, they advertise orange & that is definitely what you get.  Sharp salty hit upfront, finishes dry with the lingering citrus, very carbonated mouthfeel, almost on a champagne level.  Would be great on a warm summer afternoon."
""
""
""
""
"The blood orange works remarkably well with the sour, tart, salty base. I'm not sure if the base would stand up as a worthwhile Gose, but this finished product is truly charming. Try it."
"It's strange. And not in the good way."
""
"O - A fine sour Gose.  A great light beer to enjoy with any dish.  Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Rock solid.  Less of a revelation than the standard Gose because the fruit actually clouds the grain, salt combination.  But the addition of the orange makes for its own combination of citrus and salt that is itself extraordinary.  As soon as I get back into the AV distribution area, I'm going to buy myself a whole lot more of this."
""
"Overall - A mouth puckering gose with a whole lot of blood orange. The sourness may be overwhelming for some - it just takes some getting used to. Otherwise, a unique brew that takes the style to another level."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is much better than Anderson Valley's original gose."

"Overall: Super refreshing beer, with a great taste, I haven't had too many of this style, but this is the best I've had so far."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light yellow color with a light fizzy head.  The aroma has a bit of funk, citrus and wheat.  In the taste, a nice snap of tartness and citrus flavor from the blood orange that may add a light acidic tone.  Pretty nice for a mass produced gose.  Light bodied, and drinks super easily.  Just a little tang mid sip that makes you want another sip.  For fans of the style, or open minded drinkers, this would be a hit."
"This beer is simply a salty sweet master piece."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I'd hope and expect for, the body is light, mildly effervescent and refreshing. It drinks cleanly and is all around enjoyable. Just like with AV's other gose, I think they knocked this out of the park. Delicious."
""
"The best Gose to try if you have never drank one. Delicious and the blood orange really compliments the gose style."
""
""
"Overall, lots of sweet and tart orange.  It's nice."
""
""
"Tasted awful, just a brutal sour drink"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Pleasantly sweet and tart, an interesting variation on gose, without as much emphasis on the salt and coriander.  Very drinkable, easy to go back to."
""
"perhaps i am alone in this, but i prefer the straight up gose they do to this one by a considerable margin. its just not adding all that much, aside from sweetness, that i really think doesnt belong in this style based on refreshment. it adds a nice color to the brew, and stains the head a little bit in the glass. the fruit adds a nice citrus tang to the nose, which i would describe as the fruits greatest contribution to the beer. its zesty and a cool wrinkle with the coriander that is pretty heavy in here too. the flavor though, the fruit never comes through as much as it does in the nose, and it just seems sort of sweet to me, covers up the salt, and presents itself more as a fruit beer than as a gose. i liked the simplicity of the other one, but i can see the appeal here too. its still refreshing, but not as dry as i would have hoped. still acidic and still brilliantly carbonated. cool project."
""
""
""
"Had to go on a wild gose chase for this one. Was not disappointed. The blood orange comes through, but you still get the salty sourness desired in the style."
"O:  A nice step up from their standard gose."
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce can, no canning date that I could find.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing at all.  The brew smells like orange soda, lime/citrus, and a bit of saltiness.  I like the taste of this, it tastes like blood oranges, salt, limes, and some Tang citrus drink.  It's sweet, tart, and a bit salty.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and is very refreshing.  Even on a cold day, I'm still liking this.  It's a good sessionable brew, just the thing I'm looking for when I want to end the night with one more good beer that isn't very high in ABV.  And I figure this would be really good on a hot day.  I'm liking this one more and more the longer I drink it!  Definitely worth trying, and it's priced well at $8.99 a 6 pack.  Yeah, I think I'll be buying this again soon."

"Sour taste too overpowering, makes beer significantly less palatable."

"Clear red slight pink body. Head dissipated very fast. Fruity soda pop aroma. Similar to flavored sprite. Wooo, this is tart. Taste is big tart with a punch of sea salt. Good amount of blood orange taste. Interesting, but good."
"Hazy/cloudy yellow wit thin head and mild lacing; strong aromas, just not too pleasing, not really as orange as expected, but more of a candy fruit; tastes of mild orange, dry an a sweet tart finish; decent mouthfeel; seemed a little week, but thhhis was honestly the first of this style I've sampled; I doubt I would be tempted to go back to this."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good Gose and worth getting on a hot summer's day."
""
""
"Poured from the can into a wine glass. Color is light to medium amber-orange, with maybe a hint of pink. Very little head. Initially I smelled a good amount of sprite on this, which was obviously a turnoff. However, 5 minutes in that aroma had faded away completely, and a nice tart orange aroma presented itself. That taste is a big tart blast, with a touch of citrus. Little to no noticeable salt. Body is light, crisp. Overall, a decent take on the gose style, would be nice on a hot day but not anything I'd buy regularly."

"A light beer with a very interesting flavor profile. The blood orange is pronounced and pairs well with the saltiness of the Gose style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've never thought the salt was very present in gose until this one where it's way too strong. Everything is completely overpowered by the salt. Mouth feel and flavor are mostly seawater with a spritz of orange in the nose. I liked the regular AV gose; I'll stick to that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like straw and oranges.  Tastes like orange soda up front--seriously, like Fanta.  I know it's real oranges, not orange flavoring, but the combination of sour bacteria and OJ lends it a pleasant, ersatz feel.  This is followed up by a middle and finish that more befit a Berliner than a gose, chewy yeast mellowing out the sour nodes nicely, and finishing on a light node of salt."

"Pours a nice golden color with white head. Tartness, coriander, orange citrus, and some raw wheat on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes tart, dry, and salty."

"Almost as good as the original. Tart, dry, just the right amount of juicy orange flavor. Could drink anytime"

"Light orange, slightly hazy with very slight carbonization.  Orange is apparent on the nose but not much else going on.  Taste follows the nose with strong, but pleasant, orange flavor that is balance well with the salinity.  All in all a refreshing beer.  Bit of sparkly carbonization on the finish."

""
"It's a very tart gose.  Bubbly with carbonation.  Pulpy blood orange.  Sharp flavors."
""
""
"I like this better than their regular Gose - the slight citrus is a bonus"
""
"Overall - I can dig it. I don't know that I could stomach more than 1 or 2 of these at a time due to the immense sourness, but I wouldn't mind one from time to time. I don't know that I get blood orange character so much as just a general orange sweetness, but it's a genuine flavor. Will buy again, if only a can at a time."
""
""
""
"Orangey in color. The blood orange notes certainly come through in both the nose and the flavor profile. I liked the first gose in the Hwy 128 Session Series but this one is really good - a true breakfast beer."
"Poured out of a 12 oz can into my stange glass, this beer pours a slightly cloudy/hazy but mainly clear light to medium golden color with a slight orange hue and lots of little bubbles rapidly and continuously rising to the top of the glass.  Has nice, big, fluffy looking white head that is well over an inch thick when first poured into the glass that settles, pretty quickly at that unfortunately, to a thin white ring lining the inside of the glass with practically zero lacing.  Has a very distinct orange/citrus aroma along with what I do believe is a hint of wheat.  Has a nice slightly sour and tart, yet also sweet at the same time somehow, citrus/orange flavor upfront along with a sort of musty, earthy bread like quality and of course a nice hint of salt.  Has  a very crisp, yet smooth, slightly prickly, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  A really fine effort here.  Quite and enjoyable beer.  Very easy to drink in the way good beer should be.  Everyone should try this beer!"

"Overall: The blood orange is an interesting addition to the gose, but to a certain extent I yearn for just the gose base. Still, you can hardly fault it. Light bodied, lower alcohol, and refreshing - if the tart aspect doesn't bother you it can be really drinkable."

"Darker golden color. The citrus is very evident. The beer is exactly how one would imagine a blood orange gose to be... which is to say, tasty and light!"

"Anderson Valley Blood Orange Gose -----4/5."
""
""
""
"A pretty well-made gose, overall - the guest fruit ingredient not as invasive as initially thought, though it does duly draw one in.  Tasty, tart, and dry, and maybe a wee bit hard on the palate, my tongue now craving something sweet."
""
""
"Overall - This beer is interestingly delicious: the flavor and body says ""alco-pop", but the dryness, salinity, sourness, and crisp malts LOUDLY say otherwise. This isn't my favorite style, but it tastes really well put together overall. It cannot be denied that this is ridiculously crisp and refreshing, and would be magical on a hot summer day."

"O.  A very enjoyable beer.  A good counter balance of taste.  Smells inviting.  Looks nice.  Could really drink it any time of year but would be perfect for a hot summer day at the beach or even while doing yard work.  I think it would be great to pair with salads it grilled chicken dishes and maybe a South American style steak with a chimichurri.  Will be getting more of this."
"Pours a slightly hazed straw color, fast fading fizzy white head. Smell: grapefruit flesh, orange peel, whiff of wheat cracker, earthy note. Taste: bitter orange, lactic, grape skin, salty cracker. Light bodied, rising midsip carbonation into tart/tangy then into a mildly salty finish. Nice, refreshing."
"Sour, salty, tart, slightly sweet, fruity citrus. Slightly bitter from the blood orange. A real treat of a beer. Goes well with all sorts of food."

"It's sharp in the feel, too, but well kept in check as the sweetness and malts come together for a good overall balance.  Crispness is kept high and lively, and it remains bright and surprisingly clean while having a nice smoothness as well in a medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like the beer - its absolutely worth buying.  I say ""put this beer in your mouth"" and I I am looking forward to the release of the Imperial Blood Orange Gose in the future - because Gose's are my new favorite style of beer too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its bright acidity refreshes the palate and creates a bone-dry sensation, accompanied with tangy fruit peels and the pleasant scrubbing of iron and salt. Its bracing carbonation ushers in a fast and clean finish with a light echo of wheat in aftertaste."

"Pour yourself a bowl of Fruity Pebbles. Substitute the milk for OJ and a fresh squeezed lemon. You just enjoyed yourself a glass of Anderson Valley Blood Orange Gose."

"A pretty good Gose, but I prefer their regular version. The taste was a bit reminiscent of orange Alka-Seltzer or Flintstone vitamins. That didn't stop me from drinking it tho...just a little strange."

"Anderson Valley's Gose is a solid beer. The blood orange addition brings that beer to a new level. It's amazingly bright, sweet & sour play well together, and it's one of the easier drinking beers I can remember drinking recently. Keep in mind though, this beer loses it's brightness rather quickly. I've had some cans that were mellow and uninteresting. Very fresh cans are a treat indeed though, draft as well. Go buy you some of this."
"Verdict: A delicious gose from Anderson Valley, really refreshing and easy to drink and the blood orange addition is very well done. I can't wait for summer to swing around as this will be perfect for the warm weather."

"Anderson Valley has really done a nice job with their gose beers. This is a delicious and refreshing beer that hits on all cylinders. Great in a can or poured into your favorite glass. The sourness and tartness are spot on for the style. Terrific, if this was a little more difficult to find I think it would be rated higher for sure."

"Can. Pours a fairly clear, glowing orange color. The head fizzles away very fast. Absolutely no lacing. The aroma immediatley reminds me of orange seltzer water. Soft wheat and grain. Tartness is perceivable. The flavor is again, akin to orange seltzer with a hearty pinch of salt. Wheat comes in on the finish. If they didn't use any artificial flavoring, I would be impressed because this beer really displays some serious tart orange flavor. Light, zesty, bubbly and refreshing. The salinity adds a crispness that I enjoy. It's pretty much an orange-infused version of The Kimmie, The Yink & The Holy Gose. Loved that beer and loved this one, too."

"overall it is a really good beer.  Very similar to their other gose (purple can) just has the strong hit of citrus.   4/5 for a solid beer!"

"I will try again…."

"Drinks very easy, I like this better than their regular Gose, well worth a go..."

"In my opinion, the best way to describe this beer is if San Pellegrino made their Blood Orange Sparkling Soda alcoholic. This beer is very thin, citrusy, and tart. Crushable in every sense of the word."

"There's a bit of a plasticy note in the initial aroma, along with some metallic saline character. Blood orange is subtle, with grain, must, and a touch of acidic funk dominating. Flavor is salty and exceedingly sour and tart. There's an undercurrent of modestly sweet and fruity blood orange, but it's a bit subtle in comparison. Metallic notes surface in the flavor, as well."

"I like the tartness of Kimmie a tad more, although it might be a bit off style.  The tartness of this is a bit more inline with style, but I'm not getting too much wheat feel.  So maybe out of style a tad, but very tasty to me."

"Overall, this is a delicious and unique take on the style. I'm very hit or miss on goses, but the addition of the tart and juicy orange here is really a complimentary flavor. I like this beer a lot."

"Overall it's kind of an interesting beer, but really just doesn't come off that great as a gose."
"Pours a light pale amber color with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Smell has aromas of blood orange juice and a slight mineral acidic sour aroma. Taste follows the nose with crisp fresh blood orange juice first to hit the palate and followed by a slight mineral flavors, salt, and an acidic sour finish. Mouthfeel is crisp with high carbonation and a light body balanced with a sticky acidic sour finish. Awesome variation on an already exceptional gose."

"Overall: the regular gose from anderson valley is often a go to when nothing else suits me on a beer menu and this blows that out of the water. the blood orange addition took most of the weaknesses out of that beer. awesomely tasty and juicy and perfectly drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""

"Not as good as the Holy Gose. Blood orange doesn't do much for it."
"Pours a  light orange color with a white head that disappears quickly. No lacing and no bubbles. Smells like blood orange and a lot of tartness. Taste is loads of citrus and blood orange. A lot of tartness with some malts coming in at the finish with some salt as well. Mouthfeel is pretty good but very very tart. It's a bit much for me. The standard gose seemed a lot easier to drink. Still this is pretty good. There are better out there though."

"16 oz. pour on tap at Hopleaf,"

"Crystalline gold with a thin, bubbly head that disappears within moments, much like regular Gose.  Aroma showcases the blood orange in a perfumy sort of way, grain bringing up the rear with a wet stone-like mineral quality.  Juicy blood orange flavor with a solid lemony tartness and light salt and coriander finish.  Like orange seltzer, but with added tartness and just a bit of grain lingering after each sip.  Super dry and light, near puckering.  If AV plans to just do this and the regular Gose year-round, I'm set."

"Taste is juicy and sour, sort of a sour pink grapefruit/blood orange hybrid. Slight flash of orange sweetness before it gets moderately sour. Clean and dry finish, puckering. Light and effervescent, quaffable and quenching. Where was this stuff back in the summer??"
"O: Very refreshing and very easy to drink - I really enjoyed this one and the distinctive flavor/aroma of blood oranges really complements the traditional gose flavors. Definitely worth grabbing this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would purchase this one or the other one again easily. You could drink this six pack in one night and I feel like you really would not be hurting in the morning. I am not going to attempt that tonight. That said I hope Anderson Valley makes this a regular thing. They make a damn good beer here. I guess its a beer? Anyway, its well worth trying. I picked this one up for $11 for the six pack, I figured it was worth the shot considering I did enjoy the other one. And it is. Maybe a bit pricey for what you get, but it's a flavorful style of beer and if you like tart/salty things this will do you right."
""
""
"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer is a amber-tinted orange color, slightly hazed and vibrant, with no evidence of the scant head that was there on the pour. Aromas of toasted grains, salt water/brine, and subtle raspberry and citrus tart notes. Flavors are very tart and sour forward, nicely balanced, with a blast of tart blood orange sweetness, ocean water saltiness, and a solid sour undertone. Orange rind and subtle roast highlights throughout. The body is full, but extremely dry and crisp. The aftertaste is more of the rich blood orange, with the tart raspberry shining through. The finish has a sour linger, although otherwise crisp and dry. Very refreshing, drinkable brew."
""
"In my opinion, and several other of my friends, this is the, hands down, best infused American-style Gose in the nation!!!"

"Smell is wet hay, a little tart, citrus and corn.  The corn seems misplaced in the nose.  I get zero oranges, just a hint of citrus rinds.  The flavor is citrus, lemon, salt, a little sweetness on the backend, good tartness.  It tastes a little like a salty lemon drop.  This is ok, not great in the style.  Smell is off."
