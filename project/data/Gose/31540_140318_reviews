"Verdict: A lovely Gose from de Garde, bright, delicate, refreshing and super crushable. The fruit flavor is fresh and juicy, plenty sour without being crippling and the coriander and sea salt flavors add a nice counterweight, stunning for the style."

"More lemon and sour than normal hose, otherwise about the same. both world class beers!"
"Pour is pale yellow, hazed, puffy white head.  Nose is very dusty brett, a hint of sea salt and mineral, orange peel, not really citrusy but husky peel, light hoppy pineapple behind.  Taste has a touch less going on.  A little bit of grain comes in up front, still a light touch of dusty brett, nicely hoppy, citrus and pineapple with a gentle bitterness.  Light body, well carbonated, semi dry finish."

"Not unlike the regular Hose, this is a mostly clear light yellow orange with a dense off white head that falls off to a ring. Plenty juicy and fruity , this has a more white wine and mineral character than Hose. Great blend of coriander and lemon as well. The palate opens sour, though seemingly more as sour as Hose. Lemony, citrusy, mildly earthy, moderately mineraly, white wine grapes and a touch of salt are all present. Decidedly unorthodox, this is extremely delicious. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is quite light and airy on the palate. The sourness lightens it as well. Excellent."

"Similar to the Citra/Amarillo Hose but less of the great citrus flavor"
