"Unfiltered in appearance, grapefruit pink in color with thin bubbly light pinkish white head, smells fruity sweet and sour. medium in carbonation...taste is very odd...not sure what hibiscus tastes like but probably this...? has a rotten fruit aftertaste that is pretty nasty. not really sour at all like I was hoping. taste kind of bland and flat...lame."

"O - Wow, what a downer. It looked beautiful, but taste was extremely lacking. I almost feel like this was not a gose. It was slightly tart, but lacked the salt and lactic flavor I was looking for in a gose. It also lacked a distinct marionberry flavor and tasted more like old cranberries, and I only got hibiscus in the scent, not the flavors. I would not buy again, nor would I recommend it."

"Poured into a pint glass."
""
"A good bit under medium bodied with a light effervescence . Acidic and drying after the swallow, the fruit note lingers nicely. Decent but not great."
"12 ounce bottle, date stamped on label of Mar 28 13. Served in a stange glass, the beer pours a slightly reddish/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is OK, and there wasn't much lacing at all. The brew smells like marionberries, flowers (which I assume is from the hibiscus), and wheat. It tastes like marionberries, wheat, and a bit of floralness (once again, from the hibiscus). Moutfheel/body is light/medium, it's easy to drink and has a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a decent enough brew, although I'm not sure if I would call this a gose or not. Regardless, it wasn't bad at all. $8.49 a 4-pack."
""
"Overall- A nice, crisp gose. Would have liked to see the salt aspect for the style but still enjoyable nonetheless."

"Overall, I have no idea how to rate this ""to style"". This is the third time I've tried a gose, and each time has been different than the previous, the first tasted like a salty, tart hefeweizen, the second was more like a really sour berliner weisse, and this one is like a boring fruit beer. This is easily the worst of the three and I won't be having it again."
"Marionberry Hibicus Gose pours a bright blood red color, with a very small head. Their is a sweet fruity aroma from the marionberries. The taste has a nice subtle sweetness, strong marionberry flavors, and hints of coriander. Easy to drink, but slightly watery, and could benefit from some higher levels of carbonation. Overall its a good beer, tastes more of a fruit style then a Gose however."

"An interesting beer and worth trying at least once."

"O: I've had a couple of these over the last year and, while it isn't my favorite, it always leaves me wanting another. I like the style and its crisp and refreshing. It's not for everyone, if you like the sour beers you might like this."

"Taste is pleasantly tart, but not sweet. The hibiscus adds a floral tinge, and the coriander imparts a lightly spicy hint towards the finish, but overall the flavor is marionberry. It's a little sour, and a nicely light session beer that breaks the mold a bit."
"Sick beer. Unfiltered wheat beer so it has this deep beautiful red color. It comes off sour at first and hits you with a huge fruit note. Virtually no hops flavor so it actually disguises itself as a beer pretty well. Therefore, not for picky hop heads or those not into sours or fruit beers. On the other hand, perfect for people into fruitier things. So drinkable and tasty."

"Pours a hazy deep pink to reddish color with a small off white head. In the aroma, coriander, and a fruity to tart berries. In the taste, starts dry to a cranberry juice cocktail flavor to dry end. A spice like bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry fruitiness to clean aftertaste. Note really sure what marionberry should taste like, but quite cranberry like."
""
"Mouthfeel is flat and smooth. Overall, I'm not a fan at all, and I think I'm going to dump this out."

"Overall it was good, and surprisingly enjoyable. It looked weird, smelled kind of off and tasted like a wine cooler, yet came together and worked. It's hard to pinpoint the reasons why it worked, but to me it did so I'd have this beer again. Not too familiar with marionberry, hibiscus, or the Gose style for that matter, but I was able to overlook the sweetness and enjoy this interesting beer."
"Overall a decent beer but not remarkable."
""
""
"O- this is an interesting style, my first sample. The fruity-acidic element works pretty well together. Would like to try more of the Gose style."
"Enjoyable."
""
"12 oz single from Rothâ€™s Sunnyslope Market in S.Salem. $2.49 Poured into a goblet, rhubarb stalk red with a small off whte head that goes fast. Fruity berry aromas with some spice..nice really Ricj raspberry/marionberry flavour with a bitter slightly saltiness underneath,spice after taste. Very dry finish but a nice mouthfeel. Hard to judge this one other than i enjoyed, but one 12 oz serving would be enough at a time"

"I've wanted to try this one for awhile. This Marionberry Gose pours a rose reddish pink in color with light carbonation that dies off quickly. The nose is light with some berry and floral characteristics but no typical Gose wheat or salt water. The flavors too, light berry and some hibiscus character. It is lightly tart, but its slight. If anything, there is more sweet berry than I anticipated. It is very light in body with little carbonation. It's approachable but nothing really impressive. This could be used as a good gateway to get girls into craft."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice overall balance with some good berry flavor, tartness, and acidity."
"O: I found this to be a very interesting beer for the style and something that is very easy to drink. The addition of marionberries and hibiscus really helps make the beer easy to drink, akin to putting fruit syrup in a Berliner Weissbier."
"O: Right off the bat, from the appearance, you can tell this beer contains both hibiscus and berries. There is a pleasant amount of tartness but overall this flavors in this beer are rather subtle. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
""
""
"You have to hand it to them for coming up with a brew like this, old world style meets extreme brewing. I think the level of tartness works here though it would have come across better if the beer was dryer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing but a little too subdued. This would be a good beer to introduce more mainstream drinkers to the concept that some beers can be tart."
"O- Not very impressive. Interesting ingredients, but under-realized."
"Overall more of a fruit punch and a beer I think. My forst Gose and from what I have read about the style it is true to it. Unfiltered wheat ale with a berry syrup to balance the acidic quality of the wheat ale. It's OK, but not an everyday sort of brew."
""
"Overall this is an alright beer, nothing special about it that makes you want to drink more of it. Might be a good hot day beer though."
""
"O: A solid fruit beer. Really it's just the nice berry flavour, blind I'd never know this was a gose, it doesn't offer much in the way of style."
""
""
""
"O- I've had a few other Gose beers before and though they aren't really my thing, this fruity more mainstream take on them sounded good to me... Boy was i wrong. This beer really misses the mark in every way for me. I'm probably going to pour the rest of this bomber down the drain."
"Overall I can think of 100 fruit beers better than this one. If I want a winey beer DFH Red &White is better not to mention the Raspberry rocket fuel called Fort. No repeat sale on this one."
""
""
""
"Overall: I love the bizarre experimentation that this beer represents. I think it has flaws, but it is refreshing and certainly drinkable. On a hot enough day, I'd have this again."
""
"An enjoyable, if somewhat specialized brew. Wouldn't be first on my list to buy again but I'll be trying other Goses (Gosen?) on the strength of this."
""
""
"O: Basically an experimental beer that's kind of hit and miss. Not undrinkable, but there are better examples of a gose out there."

"Taste brings forth the berry and coriander up front, a touch of apparent salinity on the close and a lingering fruitiness after. No hop bite though a touch of hops is offered on the aroma, quite smooth and drinkable. Light in body, touch of salty tartness though not tart by any means. Interesting entree to the style though likely a bit of an outlier.."
"The aroma is floral and tart from berries as well as slightly funky. The appearance is raspberry. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is average. Overall I want to like this beer because the concept is so cool but it is just not that good. It's is just too weird."
"Pours a murky, turbid raspberry color with a 1/2 inch foamy light red head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is somewhat tart and sour with some sour berry and hibiscus aromas. Interestingly enough, the smells actually seem to disappear as the beer warms. Taste is slightly tart with sour berry and hibiscus flavors up front followed by grain and spice flavors on the finish. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a somewhat crisp and slightly acidic mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I can see being a good introduction to sours for beginners but to me it's not worth revisiting."
"The body was very good, light, but still substantial, but not heavy or cloying. The beer had good carbonation that carried the flavors across the tongue easily. Drinkability was very good, this was a rare case where if I had another 22, I would have opened it immediately (which goes to show my point, if brewers would put these brews into sixers instead of 22s, I could have had 3-4 and still had some left over). Overall, in my limited experience with the Gose style, this wasn't really a typical example, but was still quite enjoyable. No aspect of this beer dominated, but the beer was very well combined. I enjoyed this beer much more than the number shows. It's a must try if you see it. I'll be grabbing another bottle or two."
"Overall it's an ok drinking brew but not what I am in the mood for. This isn't my thing, and this is not what I want when I want a gose."
""
"Easy drinking, with some unique characteristics, though fairly subtle overall."
""
"Overall, this is just a really fun and different beer, and one of the better fruit beers I've had in quite some time. And it's in four-packs for relatively cheap too!"
"O: Really not impressive, berry notes are subdued and the flavors and aromas are very light. Maybe thats what its supposed to be (I'm no Gose expert), so if you like these kinds of beers this may be supremely drinkable come summertime."
"I'm totally charmed by this stuff. If it's not anything like the ancient style, it's what I like about the World Beer movement. Take inspiration and make it drinkable. They could make another version without the training wheels, though. Another of the user-friendly oddball beers from Widmer."
"- Kind of a bland attempt at a Gose. It's got wheat, brewing salts, and a touch of funk, but it isn't quite there. Certainly a style of beer that shouldn't be done in large batches and with any brewers house yeast or fermentation style. This is strictly a style all in its own, and should be brewed as such. It wasn't tart enough for me, funky enough, nor did it have the fruit I was expecting after seeing its color. Want a good Gose? Hit up Upright or Breakside. Or better yet, grab a nice Berliner Weisse and add a little marionberry syrup to it."

"This beer captures everything I liked. Despite the off white head that is gone in a flash, and the red color, the beer is light, carbinated, and refreshing. No hops at all, and a light sour- light lemons. Great mouthfeel and taste."
""
"3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/4"
"Overall, I'd tone down the hibiscus, and let the berries shine a little more. The salinity is spot on, but there should also be a bit of tartness. Not the best attempt, but I'm glad to see a big name getting into the style!"
