"Decided to try one of the beers my son sent me from Texas - Real Ale 18th Anniversary Gose, a German style wheat beer with coriander & lime. Pours nicely with a full head, and a scent of citrus.  Has a hazy golden/light amber tone, typical of wheat beers.  The first sip reveals a strong limey flavor, with a slight wheat sweetness. I can barely taste the coriander, as the lime is dominate, especially on the sour aftertaste. It is very refreshing. I am not a big Gose fan, but I am learning to appreciate the style more and more!"

"Real ale added pureed whole lime which gave their gose a distinct twist.  The beer poured a hazy gold with a bubbly white head.  The aroma had distinct lime and wheat beer qualities but was overwhelmingly lime centered.  The taste was sharp and crisp that started with the bready wheat and hint of salt but quickly spiked to a tart lime that faded to a bready lime dry finish.  It was very light and refreshing which made a perfect summer brew in Texas. While I expected more salt for the style, the lime definitely dominated and accentuated the tart characteristics of the style."

"A lime gose?! If I wanted Sprite I would have purchased Sprite."

"Smells mainly like coriander seed, with some fresh lime juice and peel and a yeasty, bready note - fresh and attractive. Both the coriander and lime come through on the palate too, with the coriander again being the more prominent of the two. Light, dry, clean, refreshing. Mild salinity. Only a hint of acidity from the lime. I can't help but think that this would be even better with more acidity, and maybe more salt, but in any case it's quite nice. Refreshing, highly drinkable."

"Lots of lime citrus. Not very tart."
"Overall: A nice quencher for Texas summer and smart local interpretation. The salt, lime and wheat base find a good harmony rather than tasting like beer spiked with a margarita."

"Cloudy straw colored pour with a minimal head white head that fades quickly. Medium carbonation. Aroma has hints of lemon and lime. Fruity with a citrus/lemon/lime flavor that has nice tart edge. Very light and dry beer that finishes slightly sour."
"The briney character is present as it is sipped. There's more salt and a citric squeeze of lime. A fun sipper."
