Aromas of spiced bread with some earth salty hints and some yeast derived phenols. Salty spicy bread with hints of lemon and a bit of spicy earthy yeast character. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Might be a bit salty for my tastes, but it sure did disappear rather quickly.","johnnnniee","Jun 24, 2014"

3.93,0.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow with a thin halo of white foam. The nose is yeasty, but sweet. The taste is similar to a saison, but different. There is a lot of yeast, but it's balanced by all the beer has going on. It's slightly tart, salty, and a slight B.O., but well balanced by the fruit from the yeast and sweetness from the malt. Very drinkable, summery ale and it completely hits the spot. There is NO bitterness, but it still balances out nicely. Great beer to grab a togo bottle of.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 28, 2012"

3.9,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This was a pretty solid take on a Gose, with an interesting flavor profile that was much more quenching feeling and drinkable then you would think at first. I’ve had a couple of these now and I will continue to seek more out. It’s definitely a style that has my attention.","Kegatron","Jan 25, 2012"
3.73,-4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is seemingly no alcohol inclusion throughout. This was fairly easy drinking with the salt addition really coming out as it warms. I have not had a ton of Gose offering but of the ones I've tried, this one had the best saltiness factor but lacked a little bit in overall depth.","stakem","Jan 23, 2012"
3.75,-4.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"O- Very interesting style. Lots of good flavors with a weird salt taste thrown in. Still everything blends nicely for a good drink. Very refreshing for sure.","HosP","Jan 01, 2012"
3.48,-11.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Overall: This one could have used a little bit more flavor. The herbal notes weren't strong enough. Nice and refreshing, but I'm not sure I'd have it again.","oline73","Dec 28, 2011"
4.47,14,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Gose is a rather rare German style of beer, similar to other Weissbiers, which focus on a large portion of wheat; how- ever, a standout difference is the addition of spices and salt. Portsmouth’s starts with a cloudy yellow straw body and creamy lacing, and a wheaty nose with green banana, sweet herbal notes and a dusting of spice. Crisp up front, creamy mouthfeel beneath. Light bodied. Big smack of lemon bite, sweet malts, soft coriander and an underlying saltiness. Mild green apple, too. Fairly dry overall, but really dries up in the finish. Moreish. Delicious. Insanely drink- able. One of the best examples of the style we’ve had to date.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 15, 2011"

Alone, I didn't much care for it after the first few sips, but that would probably be the case for me with any gose.","greybeardloon","Nov 20, 2011"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a fairly clear yellow colour. Lots of white head. Smells spicy and a touch yeasty. I think i can actually detect the coriander on the nose. Tastes yeasty and spicy. I thi this is more interesting than the ccb Gose but there is a light fruity characteristic that comes through that's more intigrated than the leipziger. Light, feels lighter than the ccb Gose. Still quite refreshing. This really seems like a clone of the leipzigerr Gose. When sipped side by side with the trasditional German brew. Maybe a touch saltier","Urbancaver","Oct 16, 2011"
4.47,14,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I was really looking forward to trying this and was not disappointed. This may be the best beer I have had from Portsmouth that I have seen on their menu multiple times. Nice, light, and wheaty. This is super sessionable. It holds true to the gose style and tastes noticeably different then other wheat beers.","tigg924","Oct 11, 2011"

4.2,7.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Draught at Brewpub: This one was served in a 20th Anniversary flute. It was a cloudy, light yellow color. There was a small white head that left a little lacing. Nice nose to it. Wheat, coriander and lemon notes. Even a faint whiff of sea salt. Interesting flavor. Very dry, but not bitter. Wheat, spices and citrus. Some earthiness also. This is really different and nice!","Boto","Aug 11, 2011"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer color is pale yellow and it's slightly veiled. The head is white and sticks well to the glass. The aroma presents notes of lime and citrus. Some grassy notes too. Taste is similar. More lime and citrusy. Carbonation is present in the mouth. Medium body. Nice and refreshing. A very good summer beer. A true session beer too. Taste and refreshing. Nice.

3.52,-10.2,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy light gold with a small head. Nose is some grainy wheat sourness, lemon. Mouth is really grainy, bright wheat, sour mash, lemon, salt. Soft and grainy. Soft in the mouth. Apparently Portsmouth was the only brewery in the U.S. to make this style until a few years ago. Nice enough, nothing really exceptional but finely done.","JAXSON","Jul 26, 2011"

3.38,-13.8,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"D - I had no problem with the bottle, but this certainly isn't a beginner beer. If you like a good Berliner Weisse, keep an eye out for this one.","jsanford","Jan 18, 2011"
3.89,-0.8,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: A highly drinkable, yet supremely funky beer. Not much of a hop kick to speak of, perhaps only contributing to a touch of the dryness. This beer is unlike any other I've had, and I think the apple funk that they add covers up the usual unpleasant funk bad wheat beers all too commonly exhibit.","dudecandle","Jan 08, 2011"

4.2,7.1,4,4,4,4,5,"22 oz bomber poured into a tulip. This is the first beer of this style I will ever have. Pretty excited. The body is hazy yellow with about a centimeter of white head on top that reduces to thin lacing. The aroma is like a barnyard with lemon zest. Lost of grain kissed slightly with citrus twang. It's a really nice smell, not complex, but the aromas are very pleasant. Starts nice and tart and mellows to follow through with earthy. grainy flavors. The mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation and drinkable as the rest, especially at 4.5. I did this, would really like to try more examples of the style.","Bendurgin","Oct 13, 2010"
4.33,10.5,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Extraordinarily drinkable! I liked this a lot and wish to see more of the style. Good job Portsmouth. Make sure to keep brewing this style and I will be sure to keep tracking it down!","hopsbreath","Oct 05, 2010"
4.07,3.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I was told that if you want to drink a beer while exercising that this would be the best style to do it because the salt will balance your electrolytes.","deltatauhobbit","Sep 19, 2010"
3.09,-21.2,3.5,2,3,4,4,"All in all, this was an ok brew. A decent summer sipper if you get the chance to try. I'd recommend hunting down only if you're a fan of the Gose style. Otherwise, don't bother unless you have access to the brewery.","steve8robin","Jul 03, 2010"

3.95,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D - I drank this down pretty fast, and if I were loitering at Portsmouth and not driving to Syracuse I would gladly have had another. The low ABV and refreshing texture make it a good session option.","MasterSki","Jun 22, 2010"
4.07,3.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"S: A nice beer for a summer day. I didn't really find this representation of the "gose" style to be any different from most other wheat beers I've had, but it was still good. It went well with the Alehosue muscles!","MrDanno96","Jun 21, 2010"
