"someone told me that this recently medaled at the world beer cup or something, but i have yet to confirm that. its a heck of a nice goes no matter whether it won something or not, it should have. honey colored, not as pale as others, and with some clarity too until the bottom of the bottle. smallish white head fades fast, but there is plenty of bubbles in the beer. nose is nice and tart, lactic acidity is mid range, nothing caustic, but nice and zippy too. coriander is on the lighter side in both smell and taste, which is great, sometimes these get too foody and herbal, more mealish than beerish. this one stays light despite a richer color, and a little more body than the style average in my experience. salt is there, actually having a strange and paradoxical effect of making my mouth water after the swallow, and with the nice refreshing carbonation this is a wonderful beer for a warm afternoon. wheat malt is fresh and crockery. light citrus with the sourness, lemon rind or grapefruit flesh or something like that, when ice cold its perfect, but when it warms up and the pour gets dreggy, its not as flattering. definitely worth seeking out."

"This poured out as a hazy golden color with with a fizzy white head that faded quickly. There is not lacing or retention I this red. Lively bubbles rising to the top of the beer. The second pour give a good amount of sediment making this a milky looking tan color. The smell is slightly tart with some wheat on the nose. The taste is tart with some lemon citrus, the salty wheat comes in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer has a big carbonation to it. Overall this is a pretty solid brew. Really enjoyable."

"The beer pours a coffee w/ creamer, hazy light brown with with no head. The nose is slightly tart with a bit of funk. The taste is acidic and fruity/yeasty and a bit of salt. Honestly this beer drinks easy despite the tart funk, but finishes like I was chewing on a piece of cardboard. This beer is interesting mouthfeel, but finishes piss poorly. I've had a better gose, but none that was this milky/cloudy."

"They created a beer that was almost lost... maybe there was a reason for it not being popular. Absolutely worth finding and trying though."
"O: A pretty average Gose but not as refreshing as some Gose's I have had but I found it better than Uprights Gose. The chlorine element is the major defect but it did not kill the beer."
""
"Overall: tasty, but I prefer the Cascade variant we tasted earlier in the evening."
"The pour yields a medium golden brew with a nice fizzy white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a good dosing of coriander and citrus with a bit of salt in the background. The flavor adds quite a bit of salt, though doesn't take it over the top. Nice coriander and spice plus some orange peel. Light, crisp body with a faint acidity. Nicely done."

"O: A very interesting beer with crisp clean taste and a perfect palate cleanser. Slightly on the salt side but mostly sour yet refreshing variety that will be enjoyed often."
"D/O: This beer takes sourness to a new extreme for the style, but remains true to the clean and refreshing aspects at the same time. It has a less pronounced dehydrating effect than some others, suggesting a less aggressive salt addition. Krebs/Choc shows itself to be an adventurous small brewery in the stylistic choices they make, as in the case of this beer, even if the results aren't always entirely convincing."
"Overall a very interesting and unusual brew. No off flavor whatsoever. A very nice beer for the summer."
"Very drinkable, would be very thirst quenching on a hot summer day. A fun strange style."
""
"This is definitely a zesty, tangy beer, but the subtle caramel malt gives it a nice balancing sweetness along with the moderate carbonation. A bit more body would make this offering stellar, but if you enjoy the style and the pucker it is quite a refreshing drink."
""
"This beer is nuts! I've never had a gose before and this is certainly an experience. Not sure if I'll go searching this style out, but it was highly memorable."
""
"D - I can't stand wasabi or horseradish, so the aroma really didn't work for me. However, the rest of the beer was quite enjoyable. It's very salty and spicy compared to other goses I've had, which makes it a bit of struggle to drink in large quantities."

"Beer is light in body and very salty, nice overall. Very enjoyable. Heavily carbonated on the palate, the finish is nice too, not dry. The lacto character in this beer is subdued but it is nice. I enjoyed it, a nicer gose than most I've had. I would have it again. More lactic creaminess would make this beer better."
"The beer is transparent and light orange colored, with a half inch of white head. The aroma offers white grape juice, grape skins, white wine, spice. The flavor resembles ocean water. Salty and earthy. Lingering sea salt in the finish. A bit of a puckering sensation in the cheeks. Very bold flavor. Definitely recognizable as a gose right off the bat. A very good example of the style, I would definitely have this again."
"Taste is damn spot on. Slight salt, which balances the tart sour. This is the best gose I have had. Not too much going on I. The way of complexity... but man, this is amazing spot on. Congrats choc.... best beer to style you have made. Absolutely amazing."
"Pours a darker orange than most of the goses. Not much head. Looks pretty so so compared to the rest. Smells spicy and tart. There is almost some chili pepper. The taste is sweet and very tart. Coriander is strong. Lot of lemon zest. Under carbonated compared to the rest. Overall my least favourite other than the salt of the earth which suuuucked"
"O - nOt too bad. Want mOre salt and less tart"
"Not my most favorite style, but I can appreciate it for what it is."
"That's right, a new gose. And from the Sooner State, no less! Right on. It pours a cloudy pale golden straw (pretty much yellow) topped by a finger of white foam. The nose seemed more like that of a white wine than a beer: Mike and I agreed that a spicy chardonnay or moscato fit the bill pretty nicely. Basically it's all just spicy white grapes, with a hint of coriander, balsa, and tart lemon zest cowering in the distance. The taste returns to the usual gose territory, with notes of tart lemon, light tart orange zest, coriander, cracked wheat, light cardamom, and a twist of tart grapefruit. Not very much of a salty character here, which I've gotten in the other goses I've sampled. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, almost sticky finish. Overall, a highly enjoyable brew, not too sour, but something easily drinkable in large amounts (if so desired). Good times."
"Overall: A bit more tart that I expected. The spice flavor was intense, but good. I would consider having another."
"Since this is the first Gose I've tried, I really don't have anything to compare it to, but it seems to be in line with the style guide. I've decided not to throw the towel in on this beer, but I think the bottling in a magnum demands sharing with friends. While this one kicked my butt a bit, I will seek out a few more for comparisons sake."
"Dirty apricot with a two finger disc of white head that comes just to the lip of the tulip. Earthy wheat sets a mild backdrop for the lemon juice and peel mixed with ruddy seawater flavor profile. Distinct, yet multidimensional and well-integrated lactic tartness drives the beer and further accents the citrus from the coriander. Intriguing but so refreshing and easy to gulp that it's hard to make the bottle last long enough to contemplate it. The rustic graininess comes out further once it warms. Choc has done a nice job with this one and I'll be picking up one or two more bottles while it's still around."
"O - This is a pretty unique beer unlike any I have tasted. The beginning is pretty standard for a farmhouse ale but the salty flavor is a bit of a surprise. The maltiness in the finish is more indicative of a pilsner. This is definitely an interesting brew that you should try if you get the chance."
"O- I've never tried any other Gose's to compare this to, but this has a very lasting impressing. Great job, Choc!"
"Super drinkability, couldn't stay on it all day, but man this really slakes the thirst. This is a pretty daring take on the style works for me, I'm very impressed by this one!"
"D ~ This is my first Gose, but it will not be my last. A fantastic offering from Choc. This really is one of the most impressive 'Signature' offerings. Cannot wait to see more. Seek out!"
"A good balance of spice, tart, sour, and saltiness. The earthy wheat backs everything up. Very interesting. Will definitely be picking more bottles of this"
