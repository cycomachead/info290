Aroma has a low but nice wheat profile & I detect what I would call pilsner malts. It is crisp, clean & dry with hints of tart fruit & brine (which the brewery says should be be below what humans can distinguish as salt). Taste opens with  lactic acid sourness, wheat & a hint of coriander & finishes peppery, clean, crisp, dry with faint salinity (again) & tart fruit. Aftertaste is salty wheat, coriander with briney lemon, lime & tart green apple. Easier to drink than the American versions I have tried due to less lactic acid sourness & salt. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation that rapidly dissipates as the brew warms, lightly astringent, prickly & dry.","mothmanscott","Feb 11, 2015"

I dug the taste; not too salty or sour, hint of lemon and enough of a malty backbone to make it drinkable. Good feel; light and refreshing. Great for a hot day.

It does not have a date on the bottle so I have no idea how old it is, but I doubt the store I purchased it from would allow it to stay very long considering its a low abv. beer. Would I buy this again, probably not considering there are others that are much better, to me anyway.  Pretty boring beer for the price.","humuloner22","Oct 28, 2014"

It may just be me, but I feel that the American Wild Ale sub-style has as much, if not more, in common with a German Gose (and Berliner Weiss, for that matter) as it does with Flemish style red and brown sours.","Wobbly","Aug 01, 2014"

3.6,-7.5,3,3,4,4,3.5,"First Gose for me. Expected more coriander. Appearance looked like a standard lager but very little head, no lace. Decent golden color with a lot of carbonation action. As mentioned didn't pick up any coriander in the aroma (and taste). The salt was not noticeable in the flavor but found in the aftertaste. Similar to the salt-flavor-aftertaste you get after sipping a margarita. The mouthfeel was originally very lively but I didn't pound the beer and after sitting 10 min or so, it quickly came across almost flat. It was refreshing at first, then became more interesting than sessionable. I don't have any other Gose reference so I attempted to be fair in evaluating.","BVukelich","Mar 17, 2014"

I've read that the style in Germany can be extremely sour, almost like a Gueuze, and this one was certainly not that. But I definitely appreciate the subtle complexity that is going on here. I'm of the opinion that this is the best in style (from a style that I've admittedly had limited exposure to).

A dull coriander is present in the taste, but it's more difficult to detect comparatively. There is definitely more grain sweetness as well. However, no flavor is particularly overpowering and all blend nicely. The beer's mouthfeel is slightly tart, semi-sweet, spicy, light bodied and effervescent, with minimal funk or booze.

Leipziger Gose pours a clear gold, with a very fizzy 1""+ sized head. I am not finding lace on the glass once drank, however. The aroma is similar to a European Pils style, but a bit grainier, with the coriander and citrus scents noticeable as well. The taste is much like the aroma, but more full-flavored than one might expect. What's nice is that there's a bit of yeasty funk and sour apple hints in the mix. The salt, a signature of the style, is present, but very subtle, almost giving it a seltzer like mouth feel. This light beer finishes with an extremely crisp bitterness. Overall my recommendation mirrors my overall methods of trying a new style: try the original imports first before the local attempts.","Neorebel","Apr 19, 2013"

Some great smells on it, lemony citrus (probably the coriander), a bit of bread, some malt and yeast. Good mix of smells that seem totally appropriate for the beer's appearance. Up until the taste point, this could be a couple different kinds of beers, but wow. Very unique flavor, citric, tart, and, yes, salty. I don't think you're supposed to taste the salt in these, but there just is no missing it. Feels very full on the mouth, stays lively with carbonation though. Overall, and absolute delight to drink. As it stands, I would only really want one, but on the other hand, I think I could totally get used to it if it was the beer that was all around my town.

Color went from a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity to a hazy orangish-yellow in just a millisecond. Depending on how clear you want your beer, a gentle pour may be in order. The nose had a pronounced peppery odor, thanks to the coriander, but I could swear that I also caught some salt spray in there. Salt & pepper - what a novel concept! Mouthfeel was full and brisk and it tasted like the lemon pepper seasoning that I like to put on fish. To say that the finish was dry would be like saying that the ""Mona Lisa"" is a painting. This was alum dry! You could pour this on electronic components in lieu of dessicant in terms of its dryness. Arid Extra Dry had nothing on how dry this beer finished.

Fine lacing left behind between sips beautiful looking brew. Aroma at first was bit sulfurous with a brisk wind of sea salt and lemon peel citrus blends with coriander spice. Flavor is impressive, really unique great tasting beer I'm glad I finally gave this a try. Every time I had seen it before it was in a crazy shaped flip top bottle with a pretty high price tag. This 11.2 oz brown bottle for 3 something a bottle seemed much more fair for never having a real version of this stuff.

It poured a murky, muddied dark yellow with an orange aspect to it with a frothy one finger white head. The head dissipated within a minute or two and laced the glass. It smelled pretty salty and featured yeast, citrus, and clove like aromas. The salt hit initially then calmed down. The flavors are definitely interesting. It's primarily yeast with citrus fruits, cloves, banana, and light sodium. It has this odd effect on your tongue. The initial salt dried mine out and then it made my mouth water as the fruits hit. It reminded me of when you walk out of the ocean and you didn't get all of the salt water off of your lips. Normally I'd think that was odd but this is pretty flavorful. It drinks medium in body and is pretty smooth. It tingles the palate. I find this to be pretty drinkable. It's essentially a solid, heavier wheat beer with citrus fruits with a touch of salt.

Upon examining it further I concluded it was definitely fresh wheat malt and kumquats. Tart and orange/lemon-like. In the middle lemon appeared along with some booze and finally there was a refreshing, semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body light/med and the carbonation perfect.

Nose and flavors consist of citrus notes such as tart lemon peel and zest, salt, light toasted wheat, saltine crackers, coriander, spicy yeast. Light bodied and quite effervescent. Very quenching.

4.45,14.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"What a revelationj this beer is on-tap. I'd had it a couple of times in the bottle before, and while I thought it was interesting and pretty good, it didn't really grab me as a style or a beer. Once I had it on tap this summer at the Brick Store Pub, I just couldn't stop drinking it. It seems that at least every other time I would go to the pub I would order one of these, and it just kept getting better and better, particularly if it were hot outside. The bottles are also quite expensive, so this is relatively a much better deal. So refreshing, and the touch of salt an loads of coriander eventually made it addictive for me. Something just seemed to click with this beer on draft. Pours a super carbonated pale yellow with a very white fluffy head. Smells very slightly sour, with a hint of lemon and green apple and spicy with fresh wheat and you can smell a slight salty tang. Tastes very, very refreshing. Lots of coriander and some crisp wheat up front, and then the salty tang is quite noticeable against a background of light citrusy sourness and tannic, salty bitterness. This part of the beer is reminiscent of a salting crabapples that I remember doing as a child in the south. The salt, corander, citrus, and bitterness fronted by the spicy wheat just works- some type of alchemy is surely at work here. Thirst quenching in the mouth, with the slightest bit of prickliness, and perfectly refreshing. My new favorite summer beer.","Georgiabeer","Jul 24, 2009"

Nose is of lemons, some saltiness, yeasts, some heavy spicing. Taste ... is a LOT more mellow than I expected. I had only ever tasted a Gose before at a tasting and I wanted to rip my tongue out. This is pretty damn good. Taste is very lemony and yeasty up front, but the coriander kicks in quite nicely and not overdone, sour kicks in during the finish. Light to medium bodied - taste makes it feel heavier though it's light on the tongue, medium carbonation, slick and oily feel to it.

Taste was smoother than I would have though. Had a very wheat-like flavor, and definitely some spice like coriander. I didn't really notice the salt until after the swallow. Makes your palate feel dry like you just ate some pretzels. A dry, doughy aftertaste. It's a very smooth beer due to the low abv, and fairly easy to drink.

There are some fruit notes to the beer, some apricot, some plums. The sourness is light and not very strong. The feel is a touch watery.

3.5,-10,4,4,3,3,4,"You look at it and you'd just assume it was a hefeweizen if you didn't know better. The cloudy orange-dark-tan body topped by a large, lumpy, long-lasting white cloud of a head fill the requirements of good looking hefeweizens. The aroma then throws you for a loop. That distinctive coriander scent doesn't belong here if this was a hefeweizen. Plus, it's missing much of the banana/bubblegum esters of a good hefeweizen, although a slight phenolic notes makes this smell much like you'd expect from a witbier. On the first sip, I noticed a sour twang that toned down drastically in further sips. The coriander makes for a nice bit of character in the flavor and the salt really shows itself mostly in meshing with the backend bitterness, but I'll qualify that with the fact that I'm a salt fiend, so my salt threshhold may be a little high. There's something missing though. It lacks the bold wheatiness or the creamy mouthfeel of a good hefeweizen. It's still a very unique, drinkable beer.","trafordboy","Nov 24, 2008"

I don't know, I've never had a Gose before and it was a good beer, but my overall feeling is that it is like a hefe with a more pronounced sour fruit/tartness to it.

A bit of pepper and spice tickle the nose as well. Light and refreshing smell overall. Taste is very much the same beginning with lemongrass, apple, and hay followed by sweet wheat. Slight citrus hops midway with a mild salty bread flavor. Aftertaste is slightly dry and sweet with a touch of honey. Light and crisp body with a slick feel. Very refreshing beer, one that would be perfect on a hot summer day while bbq'ing. I'd drink this over a hefe anyday. Thanks a ton Greg for continuously hooking me up with amazing beers.

3.83,-1.5,3.5,3,4.5,3,4,"Overall: I tried this beer the day after visiting Ohne Bedenken, the other Gosebrauerei in Leipzig. It's hard not to compare the two, and if you were to place the beers on a spectrum with Berliner Weisse being on one end and Hefeweizen being on the other, this was definitely on the Hefeweizen side while Ohne Bedenken was on the Berliner Weisse side. Between the lactic acid, salt and coriander, this is definitely a more complex beer than a Hefeweizen, but it is similar in its refreshing character. If you've never had a Gose before, try this one before Ohne Bedenken, as it is more toned-down. That being said, once you've had Gose this one may come off as a bit too pedestrian compared to its counterpart at Ohne Bedenken. Of course, if you're in the U.S., this is likely to be the only exemplar of the style you can find, and I would strongly advise you to give it a try. A wonderful style for anyone who loves the variety of beer.","Windigstadt","Oct 03, 2007"

Reminds me somewhat of how some white wines taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium. As far as drinkability goes, this is a brew that grows on you bit by bit with each sip. An interesting German ale.

It pours into the weizen glass a fairly clear toasted amber hue (a bit darker after pouring the lees) with high, quickly-rising carbonation leading up to a finger of white head that reduces to a quarter inch and leaves decent lacing. I smell papaya or mango at first (surprisingly tropical I thought, although it is my first gose) but I also discover notes of tart or nutty wheat and light hops. It is quite mild on the palate, almost watery, but definitely unique, with light oxidation (paper or cardboard?), some tartness, a mild bitterness, and hints of peppery coriander and salt on top of a light, tingly body that leaves a fleeting finish. Definitely an interesting style, but I wish the flavors were more pronounced as the wheat was light and I could barely taste the spices, but this perhaps increases the drinkability.","mmmbeer","Feb 02, 2007"

The saltiness of the beer created a bicarbonate like flavor, punctuated in the middle by a dull metallic taste. Not a good start. A strange thing happened as I was drinking this beer: the taste steadily improved. As the beer warmed, it lost its metallic taste, and flavors other than the salt became noticable.

A fairly strong pour doesn't raise much of a head perhaps 2 fingers at max. It quickly recedes to a glass ring. Doesn't leave much lacing, but suds instead slide down the glass, leaving a ring at the original beer level. Has an aroma of a Belgian strong dark, very fruity in the nose. Also very sweet and slightly flowery. Maybe has a hint of wheat twang. First sip: like taking a draught of beer after coming from a swim at the shore, with spray still fresh on your lips. The salt is quite a shock for the uninitiated. It's hard for me to get a handle on the other flavors, since the salt takes over once it hits the back of your mouth. This is a very sweet and smooth wheat ale, it seems. Not too much wheat twang, either. I think the salt might be unsettling my stomach. I will attempt to review this for the style, and that demands salt, but I don't much like it, so I will take away points here. This might be a real nice drinker without the salt. The mouthfeel is made of a fairly full body, but with low carbonation it lends it a smooth mouthfeel.

The aromas show a light belgian sourness that remained thin and lightly pungent. Tastes much less salty than I expected. Though noticably salted, the dominant flavors were lemon and orange rinds with a belgin souness / tartness. Almost like a light unblended lambic quality. A little vineous, musk, herbal character persists. Flavors never dominate, and whisp away quite airy and cleanly in the finish. The beer is not what I was expecting at all, even though I didn't have many expectations. Nevertheless, a very clean beer.","BEERchitect","0"

There is a definite tanginess here, like a weizen, but somehow sweeter. The coriander is not overpowering, but is definitely present.

There was a good amount of spontaneous carbonation running all through the glass. The aroma was delicate and floral doughy presence. Small traces of spices popped through as well. The taste is definately different than anything I have had before. I would't say it is an unfamiliar taste in the sense of other Wiezen styles, but the saltiness is an unfamiliar touch. Apparently the use of salt in this style of beer traces back to some real old-school brewing practices that are not so common anymore. The salt aspect is not what I was expecting. It is much more subtle than table salt, but it lingers enough to know it is major piece of this brew. The salt and corriander leave my mouth very dry, but refeshed.

4.03,3.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Clear, coppery-gold in hue, there is a steady stream of bubbles racing towards the white head. In a variation of a Pilsner glass the head reached an apex of two very bubbly fingers. The head retention was very good, it took awhile before it started to fade, it still had good height and a tight cap lasted the entire consumption. While the color is ordinary, the big & rocky head makes this a lovely looking beer. Subsequent lacing was patchy. The nose is airy but not empty. The main fragrance, while lacking in potency, is obviously spicy-salty with a sharp earthy twang at the back. Lemony notes too, some brief hints of metal. The nose doesnt say much beyond this; however while I cant describe the smell it does trigger my mind to think hops. Even though the potency is lacking, the constant, repeated whisper is unique. The bouquet is more intriguing than inviting. Regardless, it is drinking time. The palate is amazingly refreshing. It took about four sips before I anointed this the most refreshing beer I have ever had. Move over Dortmunder, Hefeweizen, or Pale Ale Gose has won my heart! The flavors are crisp and to the point, only the earthiness is wide and found throughout. Upfront is a mild blast of salty-spice and lemony flavors. In the middle was a sweet-saltiness that made my mouth water. Interestingly by the finish the beer turned dry. While this beer is largely clean there is an odd but enduring aftertaste, it is sweet & earthy but salty & tart all mixed in one sensation. Im impressed. I can easily see why some would not enjoy this beer; it strikes some very unique cords. They just happen to the correct notes with me. The relatively lively carbonation works perfectly with the flavor profile. Not to mention the low abv. The mouthfeel is very pleasant. Medium/medium-light in body but it is perfect for this beer. It is easy to drink, I could session with this beer, effortlessly. I found it quirky and fun, of course finding more bottles might be a chore. I bought my sample in Burnsville, MN for $4.19.

Initially this beer hits up front with a nice wheaty like flavor that quickly moves towards a more citrus lemony flavor. In the middle there is a dry briney sort of flavor with just the slightest hint of salt, which just tingles on the tongue because of the delightful carbonation. There a nice yeastie like flavor that also makes its way into the mix. This beer finishes sweet and zesty, with a nice crisp carbonation and just a bit of spice, that leaves the tongue just wondering ""what the hell happened here"" of course in a good way that is. This beer is delitefully light bodied with a zesty sort of carbonation that just feels great on the pallate.

This beer is light and refreshing, a perfect beer for this hot July night. There almost seems to be a smoky note in the finish, perhaps this is all that is left of the coriander.

Smell consisted of coriander mostly, but cloves and soft fruit was in there as well which mellowed out the sharp coriander. Taste was half witte/half hefe. The cloves and coriander blend in together and the banana flavors balance it out, and then the salt hits in the aftertaste, but it's quite pleasent. It finishes wet in a way, but the salt makes you want to drink more and more, which I was amazed on how it did that to me. So Gose it is, pick some of this stuff up.

It pours easily enough, giving rise to a full head of thin, creamy white lace that holds exceptionally well and leaves thick, long-lasting rings of lace about the glass. Very fine, effervescent bubbles can be seen rising quickly to the surface, and it basically resembles any well-made hefe-weizen. Coriander is evident in the nose along with a touch of weizen-type yeast characteristic (apple and subtle phenolics). In the mouth it's tiny bubbles lend a gentle caresses as its light body passes smoothly away with a delicate creaminess. Wheat malt appears first on the palate, followed by some dark fruitiness (similar to that of a hefe-weizen, but there's no banana except for a very soft note in the aftertaste) and a splash of tartness; followed by a mild coriander flavor and some herbal hops at the swallow. Seemingly out of nowhere, salt springs forth... drying, tangy?, and oddly refreshing!!! It's not as bold in flavor as a traditional Bavarian hefe-weizen, but it's unique characteristics, less-sweet flavor, and slightly lower alcohol may give it a bit more drinkability. If you like hefe-weizens and tart (or lightly tart) beers, then this is a must try!","NeroFiddled","Jul 14, 2004"

This begs for a hot pretzel with mustard. The beer is medium bodied and creamy in the mouth. A very refreshing drink that shows best quite cold.

I guess if a Hefeweizen is cloudy, this one is like an oncoming storm. The aroma was sweet and malty with some lambic like funkiness thrown in. The taste is very light with the yeast tasting very spicy with orange peel and clove that overpowered most other flavors except a note of sourness that reminded me of a lambic once again. I could not really detect much coriander, but the salt was evident in the way the beer dried up my mouth after each sip. This is a very unique taste that is somewhat of a cross between a witbier and a lambic. The downfall of this beer is a watered down empty mouthfeel, which is a bit odd considering the body is not very lightweight. I picked up mine at Greens on Cheshire Bridge Road. In my opinion worth a try, as there is nothing else quite like it.","rajendra82","May 24, 2004"

Spicy and herbal. Earthy. Malty. The taste is interesting. Very earthy. Like dirt to an extent. Has a bit of a farmyard presence to it. Malts are sturdy enough. Hops add just a little bitterness. Rock salt is sprinkled on top. The carbonation is a little high. And the body is about medium or a little better. Interesting brew. My first Gose.

I got apples, bananas, orange, spice, and ocean air. The taste was also unexpectedly good.. It was like a normal wheat beer with added components. The spices were notable and made the beer have a wit like edge to it. However the salt was what added the most. It added a briney dry finish. It was almost like adding beer to your mouth while eating a nice salty oyster. It was refreshing and drying at the same time. Mouthfeel was nice. went down smooth as silk.. One could drink a lot of these, if not for the salt.. After a couple I did find the salt was not making my tummy too happy. and later I did feel a bit parched..

Picking up lemon notes, and there seems to be a unique, salty character to it all. Very interesting. Finish is wheat bitter with lingering coriander and some banana-y esters.

3.33,-14.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Murky pale copper hue. Pitted, frothy vanilla white head leaves spotty, sparse lace. Spicy, sharp clove and herbal coriander dominate the aroma, but are offset by mellow, ripe banana esters. Mild lemony, citric tartness. Slight papery oxidation notes prevent vibrancy. Pronounced clove lends a mild medicinal note upfront. Grainy wheat tartness comprises the dominant malt character, and is accompanied by a parching dryness provided by mild, pure salinity. Simple, breezy banana esters provides token girth. Appropriately lightly bittered due to the paltry residual sweetness. Musty, nutty suspended yeast undertone. Phenol augments as the beer breathes, and approaches rubbery in nature. Well attenuated, with a brisk, thinnish mouthfeel. Finishes with a lingering suggestion of clove studded salted, preserved lemon. A strange brew, with unbalanced elements of a wit and hefeweizen. Maybe I just missed the orange peel, or the overt salinity overshadowed it. Tasty, but rough around the edges. I'd very much like to try more of this obscure style.","marc77","Dec 12, 2003"

The appearance of the beer is truly amazing: a towering, everlasting, rocky, white head tops a coppery-caramel colored liquid. The head is phenomenal. Very slight haze in the beer. Coriander is distinct in the aroma along with a mix of esters. First taste is at once sweet and sour. Salt comes through in the hind-taste. It becomes more pronounced as you drink more of the beer, causing a mouth-puckering and unexpected reaction. I don't think I would enjoy beer after beer of this style, yet it's strangely refreshing.","Suds","Nov 02, 2003"

3.61,-7.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"You look at it and you'd just assume it was a hefeweizen if you didn't know better. The cloudy orange-dark-tan body topped by a large, lumpy, long-lasting white cloud of a head fill the requirements of good looking hefeweizens. The aroma then throws you for a loop. That distinctive coriander scent doesn't belong here if this was a hefeweizen. Plus, it's missing much of the banana/bubblegum esters of a good hefeweizen, although a slight phenolic notes makes this smell much like you'd expect from a witbier. On the first sip, I noticed a sour twang that toned down drastically in further sips. The coriander makes for a nice bit of character in the flavor and the salt really shows itself mostly in meshing with the backend bitterness, but I'll qualify that with the fact that I'm a salt fiend, so my salt threshhold may be a little high. There's something missing though. It lacks the bold wheatiness or the creamy mouthfeel of a good hefeweizen. It's still a very unique, drinkable beer.","aracauna","Sep 25, 2003"
4.08,4.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Gose pours with a large bubbly head requiring a slow pour in order to control it. The head is fairly sticky, and piles pretty high above the rim of the glass. When it finally recedes, it sticks to the sides of the glass, and forms a thick lace that stays for the life of the glass. Theres a great aroma, and lots of it. The aroma is citrusy with lots of lemony notes as well as some yeast and slight spice notes. Cant really smell any salt that is typically mentioned with the style. The color is a nice slightly hazy amber. The start is slightly smooth but the tartness kicks in quickly with carbonation that adds some additional bite. Malts add some graininess to this brew and are subtle throughout this brew. Along with the tart up front palate are citrus notes, namely lemon. Spice notes are fairly subdued, but noticeable (I probably would have missed specifically naming the coriander if the bottle didnt mention it). The saltiness seems to become more apparent towards the end. The finish is crisp and dry, again with some tart lemon notes. Definitely heffe-ish but not quite. Still, a refreshing summer brew.","byrd","Sep 17, 2003"

Taste is smooth and full of sweet wheat beer esters (banana, cloves, touch of vanilla) then the salty/pepper flavor comes through in the middle and adds a dryness and mineral content, then finally the finish is bready and yeasty.

As it warms, it has in the nose a sort of muted sugar sweetness that reminds me of saltwater taffy. The tangy flavor smacks of citric acid and suits the light body well. So it seems to start off as a simple refresher, but a very textured mid-palate leads to an almost-salty flavor that masks any big finish and lingers for minutes afterwards.
