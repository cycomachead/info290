3.65,-8.8,4,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Nice color, perhaps inappropriately clear and decent lace.  Lightly briny aroma with a hint of cherry cough syrup.  Dry, salty, just a bit of cherry sweetness in the flavor.  Medium body, fairly high carb, reasonably dry finish.  Not bad, but this is one of those things that just doesn't work as well as it seems like it should.  Perhaps heavily fruiting a gose was just unnecessary?  Either way, this beer probably would have been better without the cherry.","nickfl","Today at 07:34 PM"

Appearance reminds me of cherry 7up and the taste is similar as well with a nice sour twist to it. I like it.","GOBLIN","Today at 06:28 PM"

I enjoyed this beer, but thought the beer was missing some of the salinity that should be present in this style. Still, it was quite tasty and drinkable.","deadonhisfeet","Yesterday at 07:58 PM"

Smell is very light (after it warms a little it comes through) - a bit of sweet bread malt and berry. Taste has a bit of salt up front with nice tart cherry, follows with a touch of the malt and lingering cherry. Feel is light and slightly effervescent. Very happy to find this in 4 packs at the local grocery store!","jancona","Saturday at 10:03 AM"
