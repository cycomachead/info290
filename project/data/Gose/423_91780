Aroma is tart lactic acid, coriander & brine with a pungent hint of vinegar & something faintly strawberry like; malt profile is low but I detect a little wheat & a floral component that might be from the hibiscus flowers(?); crisp & dry. Taste opens fruity (green apples, strawberry & lemon/lime) & dry with salinity & lactic acid tartness, coriander, thin wheat & a floral hint. Less tart, but peppery in the finish; crisp, and dry in the aftertaste.

The first punch the Gose packs is the Hibiscus, fruity flavor that is incredibly smooth.  Once that taste hits your palate, the salt taste comes right behind it.  The salt taste is slightly overbearing, breaking up the overall balance of the Gose; however, it doesn't completely disrupt the hibiscus aftertaste that finishes the sip.  I would prefer this beer in the summer, as the first beer of the day.  I cannot say I would pour two in one sitting, mostly because my palate doesn't savor fruity-like tastes drink after drink.  This is definitely worth a try come next summer!","ColdBassHonkey","Oct 20, 2014"

Flavor starts with a flash of flowers and grass before becoming more berry and grapefruit, sweet and tart, finishing with brine, fresh wheat, and soft spice.  Not as sour as some, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Medium-light, slick, and drying which keeps it very drinkable despite the mild carbonation.  Well done.","wedge","Oct 18, 2014"

The nose has tart, perfume-like floral/tropical fruit notes, followed by saline, funk (minimal), and a grainy sweetness. It drinks with more salt and tart fruitiness upfront than expected, which is amplified by the beer's carbonation, and has a slightly fruity, lingering grain finish. the mouthfeel is lowly acidic, reasonably carbonated, and light bodied. It does a great job satisfying my expectations for the style - crisp, tart grain presence, mildly fruity, some funk, pleasant finish - and could easily be consumed by the liter. I'm disappointed this wasn't available until fall (in my area) - it would have been a great summer go-to.","ThePorterSorter","Oct 03, 2014"

If you are a fan of sours then this would be a cheap alternative. If you are interested in trying this style of beer, do. I really think it will be happening in the future. At least I hope so. Its a nice late summer beer. Complex, but not as good to me as say Anderson Valley. I would love to check out Westbrook's version.","humuloner22","Sep 21, 2014"

Aroma is floral, fruity and slightly tart. Coriander. Rose hops. The flavor reminds me of pink grapefruit. Tart and slightly briny. A bit of unripe berries. The floral notes and the coriander are very important to the flavor. Surprisingly medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Licking the lips resurrects the saltiness and tartness. I liked this beer. Can't wait to give this to someone and explain all the wacky stuff it's brewed with.","VelvetExtract","Sep 05, 2014"

The nose comprises lemon zest, coriander, light cracked wheat, light ruby red grapefruit zest, and a hint of sweet flowers.  The taste brings in more of the same, the lemon and grapefruit bringing in some understandable tartness.  There's a vague sense of salinity, but nothing firm manifests itself.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable brew, one I'm glad my local beer guy convinced me to buy a sixer of.","TMoney2591","Sep 01, 2014"
