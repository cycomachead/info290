4.01,13,3.25,4,4,4.5,4,"This offering from Shell's is brewed in the classic Gose style, with coriander and salt. it pours from the bottle a dark yellow to golden color with a thin cap of foam. That ring is quite persistent, being constantly replenished with the rising carbonation. The bready, wheat-like aroma mixes with just a hint of caramel. Spice opens the nasal passages, but it isn't distinct enough to identify. For a wheat beer, this thing is easy going on the palate. The extensive carbonation helps ameliorate the chewiness of the wheat. The malt and wheat flavors make the front end pleasantly malty. A slight touch of coriander rises toward the end. The palate is dried out a bit, presumably from the salt. A balance, clean brew. Now if only summer, or spring for that matter, would arrive...maybe by May 1.","BeardedBoffin","Apr 12, 2013"

The aroma is of banana, clove, coriander and salt. It is a pleasant aroma, however, I would prefer it to be slightly more pronounced. The taste crisp and sharp like a gose is supposed to be. There is a nice wheaty twang, and a saltiness that dries the beer out enough that I want to take another sip. However, the nice banana and clove notes that are present in the aroma, are not to be found in the taste, and that is a shame. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy texture. Oddly, there is a plethora of vigorous carbonation visible in the beer, but it doesn't drink as though it is as highly carbonated as it appears to be. Overall, I like this beer quite a bit. I can see how it might be improved, but I'm also guessing that it will taste much better when the weather gets hotter.","KarlHungus","Apr 07, 2013"

3.86,8.7,3.25,4,3.75,4,4,"Overall this is a pleasant and refreshing offering from one of MNs great breweries. Will be great when the warm weather actually arrives. I still wonder why they filtered this, I think it may be losing a bit of complexity without the risidual yeast, like having a filtered hefe. I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of lactic in the taste, it was there in the nose. While I can't say I'll be buying a ton of this, I will be looking forward to a couple sixers over those humid summer weekends. Unique and refreshing, reccomended to all.

Extremely refreshing beer that would absolutely be sessionable especially in the middle of a humid MN summer. My favorite part of the the beer is the mild salt character. Really different and adds to the refreshment. Very fun beer to try.","jera1350","0"
