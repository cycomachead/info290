"Copper colour, hazy. White foam head that dissipated quickly. Caramel orange malty aroma. Sloe plum, peppery, berry, spices, lemon back. Not a bad beer for SA. Worth tasting."

"Not much hints at this being a Gose as it has a deep copper hue and a thick foam. Hints of white wine, lemon lime, coriander, honey and molasses on the nose. The flavor is very malty, with some dried dark fruit. The coriander is more evident in the finish as I taste some lemon lime soda water as well. Perhaps a little salty, this seems to miss the Gose mark but I find it good to drink."

"O: Not quite what I expect for a gose, but still quite tasty. It hits some of the qualities, but its very mellow; I could have used a little more risk here. Still, one of the more enjoyable beers from Sam I've had."
"a little too heavy and not enough salt, I never thought I would type that about a beer... to me, sometimes a style is a certain way for a certain reason, so I think putting your own twist on a gose might not be the best direction. this does not come off as refreshing as the other goes beers I have had, it is worth a try for the sheer novelty if you have never had salt in your beer"

"The pour at first glance can be mistaken for a Pilsner, except for being a shade darker, and with more bubbles. As ordinary as the pour looked, the way the beer smelled was anything but. Even from an arm's length, there was a sour, floral, and mineralized smell coming from the glass, which intensified when brought nearer. This was clearly not an ordinary Pilsner. The taste stayed true to the style, but was lighter than others of the type I've had, which sadly has been only a couple. This was a bit more tame in acidity and salt, and little sweeter. Not a bad taste at all, mind you, just not all that it should be. Light and crisp on the palette, but again softer, and lacking that Gose edge. I don't mind having had this bottle, and it is certainly different than Sam Adams typical fare, but I much prefer the real German bottle, or that fantastic recreation by Westbrook more."

""
"O - Cant say I'm a big fan of this style. The fruity sweet & sour element with the saltiness was just a little too weird to me for this beer to be truly enjoyable. Not a repeat buy. However, kudos to Sam Adams for the attempt at making this style more available."

"Some clear notes of wheat and coriander still present, as well as the odd lemon soda taste. Light bodied and still somewhat drinkable. Even though it's old there's still signs of life. Would try again if fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a rather unique and nice beer, but I don't think it's a very good example of a gose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My first beer of this style, and I didn't really know what to expect. Overall I quite enjoyed it; the saltiness aspect was interesting. I think Sam Adams did a good job on this."
""
""
"Overall - Well it's unique I'll say that much. Not exactly my style but it's something that's different and unique. If you're a beer geek and want to try something different this is a good one to pick up because they are normally a good price (I got mine at Costco of all places) and it's something different. I don't think that I'll be getting another one of these but that's ok."

"Sweet flavor up front. Good fruit and mild spice. The body is medium with a slightly elevated carbonation. The aftertaste reminds me of plum. Short lived."
"Certainly a taste different from anything I've tasted before. Not really a style I prefer but, it seems well crafted and I can appreciate how others would enjoy it."
""
""
"Overall: not a bad brew at all, I don't think I would go crazy looking for it at my local beer spot but I got this in a Sam Adams variety pack and hit the spot watching a little Sunday football. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Very OK. Has nice flavoring going on."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy straw gold color with a thin, quickly disappearing white head. Aroma is mild, alcohol, pepper, and malt. The taste is interesting, briny up front, yeasty, slightly sour, not nearly like some other gose I've tried. Fades to a slight bitter finish and ends with a hint of sulfur and alcohol. The mouthfeel is rather thick, highly carbonated with a very dry finish. Overall, this beer is rather unimpressive compared to the expected style. I doubt I will be having this one again."
""
""
""
"This was my first beer of this style and I thought it was very good. A very delicate and fairly complex beer."
""
"O- The clean and crisp beer is not overly dry and the fruity character with the coriander add some depth and the salt qualities remain in the background. This very drinkable but the coriander might need other support to make this really sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is of sweet malt, bread and coriander with a hint of date or apricot. Very pleasing and drinkable! In fact, the more I sip the better I like it!"
""
"The beer pours a ruddy brown with two solid inches of foam. The wheat bill comes through in the nose along with corriander and some earthy yeast. Some mineral character. Full bodied with a heavy dose of wheat. The subtle fruit character leads to some mineral aspect toward the end. Spices follows; coriander, cloves rounded out be apricot. The tang hangs on past the end to leave the palate thirsty once again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fruit and somewhat malty beer like oranges mixed with a bit of the peel some caramel and light bit of spice. Not a bad beer at all defiantly off the beaten path and worth the try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this a good beer, I've had this beer before fresh and it's even better, with the clove and salt really showing their stuff.but as it is now it's an okay beer. It is perfect for the summer heat, however!"
""
"Most compelling part of this beer to me is the nose and that unique coconut profile."
""
"Overall Impression: A nice balance of salt, sweet (fruit), and dryness. This ale is noticeably different from most other weizens or wheat beers because of the salt added, and lack of hop bitterness. The smooth mouthfeel and refreshing fruitiness makes this a great thirst quencher, but the dryness keeps you coming back for swig after swig."

"The Boston Beer Company doesn't sell bad beers. Every offering is well conceived and polished, and Verloren is no exception. Well done, Mr. Koch!"

"Poured this Gose from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy orange color, produced a huge white creamy head, excellent retention and lacing left on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted grain, spicy coriander and lemon citrus. Medium bodied, a foundation of malted grain followed by spicy coriander, butter, and lemon citrus. I was a little disappointed with the flavor, a bit to heavy on the thick buttery taste- I feel it overshadowed the coriander, toasted malt and citrus a bit. Glad I sampled but not a Ale that I would seek out again."
""
"Overall, a respectable beer. Not at all a bad choice, but I wouldn't buy it again without some assurance that the imbalances of the flavor profile and mouthfeel had been corrected. At the very least, it got me eager to try other versions of the Gose style. Now the trick will be finding some."
""
""
"O-I give SA credit for brewing the style. I'd be interested in seeing what other examples are out there."
""
"Interesting beer. Good, not exceptional. Would buy again if on sale, but wouldn't specifically seek it out. I don't want to slam it -it was very drinkable and I didn't regret it in the least, just not as good as I had hoped."
""
""
""
""
""
"My first gose and probably my first beer with salt in it. At least on purpose. Since I've never sampled the style before, and have no comparison, I'm assuming it's a good example of style. Because Sam Adams is usually a good example of style."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Sester stange. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine, three finger ivory head constantly renewed by active carbonation. Looks nice. Aroma of wheat, coriander and light orange and sweet malt. Flavor of wheat, light apple, coriander and fruit esters; finishes with light fruit, residual coriander, rather floral and a hint of salt. Light and refreshing. Light bodied as expected from the style. A very nice light flavor progression and combination. Enjoyable."

"gose. such an underbrewed and underappreciated style. a rare one here in the usa, and indeed the world over these days. but this is a gem. crystal clear golden amber on the pour, sparkling with bright carbonation and a few fingers of fine white foam. the nose is odd, corriander for sure, toasted lightly, with some wheat malt and a curious but mild yeast strain. the salt of course doesnt have much smell, but it comes in at the end. i taste sweet wheat malt and corriander seeds, and the salt is more of a finishing element, leaving a unique mouthfeel that is somehow both dry and not dry at the same time. i found this to be much less salted and mineral driven than some of the other versions ive had, particularly genuine european versions, but i liked this a lot, and the addition of corriander i thought brought out a lot of flavor complexity. a beer id gladly pay 7 bucks for again."
"O - My first experience with this style, so I have nothing to compare it to. I liked the beer. It's refreshing."
""
" Overall a very good but not great beer, I would definitely buy again for friends that are not beer nerds. This is a huge step up from adjunct lager dreck, but highly accessible for the non-adventurous quaffer."
"Overall: this is a decent stab at the style, but a lot of things have to go right to end up with a good Gose. A good try, but it falls a little bit short."
""
"Overall – This is one tasty brew. While I do not have much experience in the gose category and hence do not really have a great perception as of yet what the ideal one tastes like, I very much enjoyed this rather soft yet flavorful and quite drinkable beer. This is definitely one to try if you get a chance."
""
"O: Very interesting ale here -- one that you don't see very often. I'm glad to see brewers try to bring some rare styles to light. I thought this gose was tasty and think it would be especially appreciated in warm weather. I don't have any other beers in the style to compare to, but I enjoyed drinking it."
""
""
""
"O-rly? - The components for a closely-brewed-to-style-beer are there but there's little in the states to compare Verloren to. Fear not, for this beer is brewed very well and tastes the part, all while playing the part to revive a heritage style from Germany. Ya rly, Verloren is a rockin' bottle from Samuel Adams, encouraging consumers to try new and different things!"
""
"Overall, it's not bad. I don't know how it compares to other beers of the style, though."
""
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of spices, salt, a touch of sweetness. Taste is just a bit salty for my liking, some spice, easy drinking. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
"Overall it's an interesting beer, if not quite impressive. It's very nicely complex; and it changes its character readily as you progress through the glass. Worth trying."
"Purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a hazy light amber body with a good half inch of khaki-colored head. Smells sweet and fruity. Sweet ripe banana, apple, lemon, and caramel comprise a pleasant balanced flavor. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Delicious with sweet and sour balanced."
"Atmosphere is good. Deep coloration, with a nice bubbly head, and a little lacing. Nose is wheaty with some orange citrus notes. Flavor is of wheat base enhanced with just the slightest bit of orange. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
"A pretty mediocre gose. I've only had one or two others, but they were both way beyond this. It's just meh. An in-between beer, with almost none of the characteristics I want from a gose. None of the salt, and very low sour that's dominated by other flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is lemony biscuits with a sharp lime peel. I can taste the salt, but it is nowhere near the tastiness of the other gose's I have had. This one is bleh....something different but not right...so not to style! No bueno"
""
""
"Gotta give it up for Sam for continuing to roll out some new takes on offbeat styles. This attempt at a gose pours a lightly hazy sunset golden-straw topped by over a finger of white froth. The nose comprises white bread, soap, lemon rind (the waxy outermost part of the rind), light coriander, and a kiss of baby's breath. The taste unfortunately brings in more of the same, with the soap really coming forth as the frontrunner. I get hardly any citrus character, and whatever spice notes are there are meek at best, busy being consumed by the soapy bread enveloping them. Needless to say, the whole experience is unpleasant, leaving a bad taste in my mouth (literally, for once). The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty insipid gose, one that doesn't come close to exhibiting any of the characteristics of the style. All of the top four Google Translate definitions of Verloren apply here: Something was definitely ""lost"" in translation, the effort comes across as ""wasted"" and retrospectively potentially ""doomed"" to failure, and I am ""forlorn"" after having partaken of it."
""
"OVERALL: An enjoyable beer. Tasted with a friend, we both detected the coriander, and really thought this beer was well made. I enjoyed the tartness and subtleness of the spice/salt combination. A bit less lactic than my favorites of the style, this is still worth trying if you get the chance."
""
"O: since this is my first gose, I'm not quite sure what to say about how to compares to other ""goses," but this is at least do-able for me, average at best, and would probably only seek again on tap or growler just to get a fresher look at this one."
""
"O: Assuming this is an accurate example, I can see why this style hasn’t taken off. It has the summer flavor that appeals to many (not me), but is fairly heavy to drink and lacks the scrubbing bubbles that people ordinarily associate with warm weather refreshment."
"O - A really simple (at first glance and taste) beer that is uniquely drinkable. Softer than one might imagine."
"T: Grainy and toasty. Definitely way heavy for a Gose. Some faint coriander and wheat with some biscuity malt undertones. A bit bready on the finish."
"O: Refreshing and easy drinking beer with well hidden alcohol."
"Overall I quite liked this beer despite the bad reviews. It has some very nice fruity notes but also some spicy notes. Tastes like a fall beer or so.... Also pretty easy drinking."

""
""
"D - This doesn't really fit in with other goes beers that I have had. It is almost completely lacking in tartness and while it has some coriander flavor it isn't as pungently lemony as others. Just kind of a thick, nondescript wheat beer."
"Overall: for the style and my liking this beer and its ranking are about as good as a Gose can be IMO."
""
""
"This is a nice beer. The malty, wheaty, hoppy flavor is well balanced, and this beer has great drinkability. I really enjoyed this beer."
"This poured out as a really nice looking orange color with a rather fluffy white head on top. The smell of the beer reminded me of a pretty standard wheat beer, I wasn't really picking up much of the coriander in there. The taste of the beer is slightly salted, it mostly comes through once you lick you lips and it kind of lingers on the back of the tongue a bit. Otherwise the flavors are soft and very mellow. The mouthfeel of the beer is decent, just a typical drinkable brew with a good body and carbonation. Overall it's a neat beer to try, it's not anything overly special just a pretty cool idea to make one of this style today."
"22 oz bottle. Pours hazy orange with a short lasting, fluffy, white head and lively carbonation. Fruity aroma is of pears and apples followed by grassy noble hops, yeast and sweet malt. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Taste is of wheat malt, spices, minerals, yeast, herbal hops and fruit. Finish is long, earthy, salty and fruity. Unusual, tasty brew. I wish the style was more available."
""
"Not a bad beer, but now I must try another Gose to compare."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer with drinking for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
"Body is medium to medium-heavy in weight with medium to medium-low carbonation. Resulting mouthfeel is surprisingly dense, but also smooth and easy to drink. Finish is dry, as might be expected from the wheat malt base and added salt."
""
"Note: Batch #1."
""
"O: Only the second beer in this style that I have come across so I am glad that I purchased this one and tried it. Seems to be pretty true to the style and easy to drink."
""
""
"I am disappointed as there arent many examples of this style readily available and this one just didnt make me want to try others."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer wasnt that bad. I have had better beer overall but i think this one serves its purpose. Its a rather flavorful, light bodied beer that is easily quaffable and very nice on a hot summer day. Body was light and but not parching or super dry. I liked this one."
""
""
""
"An ""interesting"" brew. It's a rare style...It doesn't quite compete with the original from what I remember (been awhile since I had the original.) It has some flaws, but worth checking out as a novelty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes primarily of salt-sprinkled caramel candies. As it warms up flavors of lemon rind and a bare whisper of that lactic pucker appears. Light body and vigorous carbonation. Tasty and certainly different from the average beer."
"O- This one seems pretty easy to drink. Glad I tried it, but not willing to front the 7 bucks for another bottle. It's great that Sam Adams has taken the time to look back through time and revive a long lost style, hats off to them. Keep the obscure styles coming, I will try them all."
""
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden orange color with a nice fairly dense 2 finger off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange, wheat, bread, coriander, earth, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal spiciness. Nice and very unique aromas with good balance and strength. Taste of lemon, orange, pear, wheat, grass, salt, coriander, light pepper, earth, floral, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, floral, wheat, bread, grass, salt, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a bit. Good flavor balance and complexity; fairly dry on the finish. No cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and pretty crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with almost no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice brew. This was my first gose and this was quite a nice experience. Nice flavor balance and complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink. Really enjoyable."

"O - This is an interesting brew. It is my first Gose, so I'm not sure what to think."
"O- I really didn't know what to expect with this one. I mean the second you say ""beer brewed with salt"" my mind races to over done salt rimmed glass *BLECH* this isn't like that, it's there but subtle. Although from what I hear a traditional Gose is more salt forward than this ""consumer friendly"" version."
"Overall: Tasty, with a cheerful approachability as all the flavors plan very nicely with each other."
""
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a large white head. The aroma has a lot of wheat and lemons in it, as well as some salt. The flavor has some toffee and biscuit malt. There is also a bit of saltiness and some very light tartness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I haven't had a lot of goses, but this one was as good or better than the other ones I have tried."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. It was my first gose and I was impressed."
"It's nice to see Samuel Adams resurrecting some rarely brewed styles. Poured into Chimay glass. Appearance is a slightly cloudy orange with dense white layer of head. The head retains a thin layer and leaves a decent bit of lacing. The nose features candied oranges, coriander, wheat, apricots, and a wave of citric tartness. The taste delivers most of what the nose promises with wave of orange and fruit. This dries out rather quick and becomes slightly tart with a salty finish. There are some hops that come to play as well toawards the finish as well as an unpleasant bitterness. The mouthfeel is somewhat full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is only the second Gose I have tried, but it seems to have some off flavors going on. It reminds me of some of the homebrew-gone-wrong flavors I have experience. It is worth a try to experience this style, but overall, I don't see my self going back to this brew."
""
"Overall: Glad I tried this beer, it was worth the experiance and was quite enjoyable. How ever I would like to try a few more Gose before saying too much. This was my second one, and I hear this style is making a comeback."
"Overall, this is just an ok beer. It is the only Gose I have sampled so I don't have much to compare it to, but I was expecting more salt and more tartness. It really seem like a lower quality wheat beer."
""
"The Verloren Gose Beer from Sammy A is another fine creation. The corander comes through in both the scent and taste. The beer poured a nice golden yellowinto my slender cylinder glass. There was a puffy white head that does appear to be leaving some lace. The body is a medium to light with good carbonation. Overall its pretty good."
"D+"
""
"I'm sad I bought three bottles of this."
""
"O: Overall a nice flavor. Not as pronounced as say a zeipziger, but rather a drinkable introduction into the style."
""
"Nice gose, I actually quite like it, and not as expensive as others. Good way to get exposed to the style."
""
"Malty aroma has firm fruity and yeasty notes. It pours a clear golden amber with a fairly thick, if not too persistent, off-white head. Flavor has a malty core with subtle notes of apple and banana and a hoppy, but not bitter, undertone. Or is that coriander? I get a touch of that. Salt? Well, a teeny bit of salt. Salt in beer? That’s the most unheard-of thing I’ve ever heard. Ha ha. (Or tasted.) OK, enough being a wisenheimer. Smooth texture has firm body and a fair bit of fizz, leaving a rather persistent tingle on the lips and tongue. I hope that Samuel Adams keeps us this series."
""
"Overall: A nice refreshing beer, would be a great beer to have several of if it was lower alcohol. Very interesting, I commend Samuel Adams for taking on some of these rare styles."

"From all the delicious Longshot homebrew recipes, I'd say Boston Beer could make anything. This one is just not worth making. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Liticker's in Ocean Beach."
"Verloren is an alright beer. It’s really pretty good. It really is tough to make a Gose an exciting beer. It’s not a style I frequent, but I’m yet to experience one that’s exciting. It does have a simple, straight-forward, good flavor though. This one features the salty, spicy bells and whistles and is a nice representation of the style. If you’re looking to try one, this is a pretty good place to start."
"O: Good summertime beer, but it's not blowing my mind. I'll have to give more goses a try to really be able to judge this fairly. Even still, I like this a hell of a lot more than Summer Ale, that's for damn sure."
"Only the second Gose I have had to date...that I can remember.Poured into a weizen glass a deep golden with a large sticky white crown that settles ever so slowly leaving multiple ""globs"" of lace behind.Aromas are very clean with lightly toasted wheat malt and some mineral,that's about it.Flavors are also somewhat clean with mild toastiness and mineral notes,the finish has a real shot of briney saltiness and gives the beer some character.It's not bad it is refreshing but not anything to really write home about,I would not seek it out again but would not turn it down if offered either."
""
""
""
"O- doesn't remind me too much of a gose. It actually tastes much more like an American summer wheat ale. It's really tasty though and doesn't taste like most the SA beers I've had which is good. "
"O: Not bad, but nothing special, seems to be simply average, but not a bad value if you've never tried a gose"
""
"This is my first experience with this style. I have to say, I like it. It goes down nice and easy, and is an interesting mix of flavors. The touch of spice at the end makes this one stand out a bit. Very much worth a try."
"Pours medium dark amber, high foam develops and then leaves a cm or 2 layer on top. Wheaty smell. Ever so slightly peppery nose. Light, wheaty taste. Lemony throughout. Finish comes through as peppery w/ corriander. Smooth and creamy. Pretty darn good."
"Overall not something I would seek out again, but I commend Sam Adams for giving it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an interesting and refreshing beer; I've only had a few gose beers but this one seems on par, perhaps not as tart but still, kudos, Sam Adams"
"Overall: A pretty decent brew here. I don't have any other experience with this style, but this is pretty interesting and comes off well."
"D - Very drinkable. Interesting take on the style, a but a bit mild and watery."
""
"Spiced citrus with big notes of zest and coriander. I feel like the balance of the flavors isn't where it should be and the mouthfeel throws things off more. Really good looking beer and bottle though."
"Not a terrible beer--it's very refreshing. It's just a sort of dumbed-down Gose, I think."
"Overall it's interesting to try this unusual style but I probably wouldn't get it again."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, wheaty and somewhat lager like. In the taste, dry wheat like flavors and spicy, somewhat peppery. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry peppery and notes of lemon citrus in the aftertaste. A malty wheat beer, with peppery notes and a nice lemon citrus."
""
"D/O: An interesting, unique brew. I enjoyed my first several ounces. But this wore on my as I worked through the bomber. ""Novelty beer", for sure. Glad I tried it. Do not feel a strong need to revisit it in the near future."
""
"Interesting beer, and it seems to fit the style, yet I am used to a little more carbonation in this beer style."
"This is a quite average brew. Reminds me of Bell's Oberon mixed with Blue Moon. A gose should be more interesting than this. This is very pedestrian, and I'm wouldn't buy it again."
"The feel of this beer is medium to light bodied and goes down easy. It has a smooth finish and makes for quenchable drinker. The first time have had a Gose beer and it was worth a try."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium amber color with a decent white head that leaves lots of stickage. Smells of spicy wheat and a pepper with hints of earth and salt. It kind of smells like a peppery macro wheat beer. the taste is sweet with honey like malts, a bit of a spicy peppery bite to mix things up a bit as well as a bit of mineral earthiness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Kind of an easy drinking brew, a bit different. It's only my second gose, but I think I liked the Bruery version a little better."
""
"Overall: Very approachable, with a nice flavor element but I am afraid the style is not among my favorites"
""
""
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours cloudy golden orange with an off-white head. There are plenty of bubbles rising from the bottom and side of the glass. The quantity of bubbles rising from the bottom decreases after the initial pour. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Bright orange fills the nose along with coriander, malt, and hops. It has that classic, inviting wheat ale smell. Coriander, orange peel, malt, and hops blend well to create a tasty brew. If I hadn't seen salt listed as an ingredient, I might not have been looking for it. As it stands, there is a mild saltiness. The flavors are well balanced. The aftertaste is not strong. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. It is clean and refreshing with a dry finish. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer that is an interesting addition to the Samuel Adams lineup."
"This gose was for the birds."
""
"Overall, this is good beer, and certainly intriguing. The witbier and coriander notes, when combined with lovely fruit esters and breads, strike a nice balance and work well together. I did find the flavors ever-so-slightly watery, which was especially present after several sips were taken in a row and the flavors diminished somewhat. But this is a still a very nice addition to Adams’ Limited Release series."

"O - My first gose. Has some good things going on, but at the same time doesn't make me want to seek out others in the style."
"O: I've never had an authentic German gose, so I can't really determine how closely Verloren follows in the footsteps of traditional examples of the style. I'm assuming it doesn't though, as I've been led to believe that a gose is generally tart and salty. Verloren, though, is predominantly sweet, spicy, and waxy. Odd, with an unappealing texture that makes it very difficult to drink. I doubt I'll revisit this one."
"Interesting. Very strong coriander forward. Didn't really detect the salt."
"O- I was not expecting much out of this beer to be honest, mostly because its a very uncommon style of beer and usually that's for a good reason. I really enjoyed this beer, it was not as strange as I was expecting and I wish more breweries would have a go at this style because I think it's untouched territory. I think this would be a good candidate for 6 packs and I think if there was a bigger version of this beer that it would be a real killer for bombers. Still I recommend you try it out."
"Overall, an interesting experimental brew. Never had an example of this style, so comparisons are not possible. Pretty simple flavors, though."

"Pours a hazy orangish gold color with a two finger white head which recedes to edging and leaves a few fingers of lace left on the glass. The aroma is of malt up front and then a nice big corriander aroma with a hint of salt at the end. The aroma is inviting. The taste follows suit. The base is off malt. After the malt the corriander takes the show as the main flavor. After the corriander comes a slight hint of salt. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a solid beer, it is an easy drink and refreshing. It is a good beer worth a try for sure."

"Poured a 1.5"" off-white head of medium lifespan. The body is a lovely slightly hazed golden orange. The mild smell is malt, coriander, and if salt has an actual smell I think I do get that, too. Taste is mild and mirrors the smell, and the salt expresses in the medium long finish. All in all I found this quite enjoyable though it's certainly not a powerhouse. From a marketing standpoint, I don't see why this beer is nicknamed ""The Lost Beer", because coriander and salt as well as the hops and malts used are by no means lost ingredients omitted from contemporary beer."

"Finish does build up a certain soapiness though"

"O: Not as good as other goses I've had in the past, Casacade springs to mind. The salt and uniqueness of this style really doesn't come out with this effort. Not a bad beer and drinkable, but I just wanted something more interesting."
"Bottle lists hops as Saaz and Noble Hops. Malt are 2-row pale, Munich malt, malted and unmalted wheat."
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a hazy, honey-gold coloring with a light, fluffy, white head that quickly settles out into a filmy coating. Aromas of toasted wheat, lemon, butter, and a slight pepper spicing. Flavors of light roasting, with a slightly sour aromatic highlight along the roof of the mouth. Sour notes, with a subtle coriander spicing on the end of the palate. Floral highlights, and a touch of the buttered toast characteristics. The aftertaste is tangy and slightly sour, with a slick and tangy finish. Solid body, with a sparse lacing throughout. Tasty brew."
"Overall: I really appreciate Sam Adams or anyone tackling this style. That said this tastes like a Leinie's Sunset Wheat with a salty aftertaste. The salt I find to be the most interesting thing about this beer and wish it was more present. Not a bad beer, but I think this could use a bit more refining. There have been more complex and better beers in the small batch series."

"Maybe its the style, but Im not feeling it here. Its interesting for sure, and the saltiness is a welcome surprise."

"This is an interesting beer. I've had Gose style beers previously, although not enough to be intimate with the style. This one is a slightly hazy bronze-gold color with a negligible head. The aroma has a wheat twang and notable spice (coriander) and distant citrus peel. The taste is a little sweeter than expected, with more bitterness as well. Lingering peppery, bitter flavors are central to the taste. I look for salt in the taste, but only catch it in the finish, with a sensation on the tongue. It's full in body, and very interesting. It's not a beer that I'd have regularly, though."
"Overall: Never had a Gose, so can't really comment on how well it fits the style. However, this mainly just seems like an American Wheat with some coriander and salt. Ultimately, this means that it is very refreshing, but not very memorable."
"Overall, liked this far more at the beginning than the end. An ok brew but nothing like the other traditional brew version I've had."

"3/3.5/3.5/3/3.5"
"This beer pours a cloudy dark orange color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving nice lacing. The aroma is of tangy wheat, and an extremely faint hint of tartness. It is quite weak in strength. The taste is fuller than the aroma. There is considerable wheat with a nice, sharp acidic quality that I really like. The finish of this beer is really nice with lingering acidity, and saltiness. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer. I've had a handful of examples of this style, and this one falls in the middle of the pack. Still I'd drink it again."
"O: Not bad, glad to have had another gose, but was hoping for a bit more."
"Overall not bad, but nothing special. Nice malts and salt flavors, hint of fruits and hops, nice and dry, def a summer beer. But lacking a bit of anything to set it above, and aroma is fairly light."
"A new style tick from the SA limited batch series. It pours out a hazy golden color with a finger of head. The aroma is full of spicy coriander and wheat. The taste is smoothly malty at first, rounded out by coriander and a little bit of a salt kick on the late aftertaste. Kinda like a mix between a hefeweizen and a maltier amber ale. The mouthfeel is fuller and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, it's a solid beer, but really nothing that stands out as being special. It's worth trying through. I will say that the salt/mineral quality makes it more enjoyable than the average Hefeweizen is for me."
"O: A solidly made, generally drinkable beer."

"Overall one really unique tasting beer somwhere mixing an almagamation of Helles darkness and wheat distinctness all it's own. I am digging this one, but is this a Gose? I don't think so."
"O: This is my first gose, just as it is some other people's so far, and I'll say that it it is indeed very similar to an American wheat ale and not really so much witbiers, pretty much because of the absence of Belgian yeast. The salt also adds another interesting dimension. Good beer, but I have no clue on how to rank this as far as style"

"22 ounce bottle, Batch #1. Served in a weizen glass, the beer pours a golden/orange color with about an inch and a half off-white frothy head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is nice, it smells like minerals/salt, lemon peel, coriander and some bready/grainy malt. I think the citrus and coriander flavors are stronger at first, and then after a little while the mineral/salty flavor starts to kick in. There's also some coriander, bananas and just an overall fruity flavor noticeable, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with a good amount of carbonation. It's also smooth and goes down easy. I haven't had any gose style beers before so I have no idea if this one is a traditional (or a good) one or not. But overall I think it's a solid brew, and for $5.99 a bottle I'd certainly try this one again."
"From Batch no. 1. Sampled on April 26, 2012. The pour is a slightly cloudy copper to medium amber with a white head that slowly diminishes. On the nose I get a vague malt character and a hint of citrus and spice. The body is about medium but the texture creamy and comfortable on the palate. Now about that taste; it starts out as a pleasant pale ale with a moderate grainy malt character but after a few sips the salt is easily found along with some pineapple or lemon citrus. Hops are mild but clean and crisp. This seems like a nice option on a warm but not hot day."
"O: This is my first Gose so I don't have anything to compare it to. Has a lot of rich caramel with a mineral water quality. Wheat, lemon and banana are there. Shows obvious German wheat beer characteristics. How Verloren tastes; think Weizenbock mixed with an Americanized Saison with a dash of salt for good measure. Props to Sam Adams for brewing an obscure style at such a great price."
"Poured into a Stella chalet. Pours a dark orange, with some haze, an attractive 2 inch white head, with lots of lacing. Smell is clove, carmel, banana, and some citrus. Taste is clove and carmel up front, with some banana in the finish. Body is medium large for its ABV, plenty of carbonation, more lush than dry, and good drinkability. This is a solid beer."
"Flavors seem a bit lost / muddled. Does get a bit soapy which makes it more difficult to drink. Glad they tried this style but this one needs some work IMO."
