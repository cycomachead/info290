"Light in body with nice carbonation, citrus rind (lemon) and salt.  Really nice balance and not much in the way of the musty lemonade that sometimes accompanies the style.  Delious beer!"

"Bottle. Solid beer but compared to others of same style it falls a little short. Doesn't have the tartness or depth of flavor."
""
""
""
"No where near as salty as some gose. Also not as sour but it has a delicious sea salt after taste. A good beginner gose. Its very palatable. I'm trying to figure out what yeast strain this is. Anyone have any idea?"
"The bottle was over carbonated, but it was good after I let it sit in the glass for 20 minutes."

"There may have been a bottle/corking issue; the bottles I've had were a little off.  On-tap remains amazing."

"Great little beer different and easy to drink"

"O:  A terrific gose; compares favorably to most. Anderson Valley Blood Orange is superior, but as for East Coast offerings, this one tops the list."
"excellent beer cant wait to try more from them, first Gose i have ever had"
"750ml caged and corked bottle served in a stange.  90% of the cylinder was comprised of dense, bright white foam off the initial pour.  Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution and adhering to the walls of the glass.  clarity is translucent.  Nose expresses clean, bready yeast aromas, a kiss of lemon and a hint of wheat malt.  Taste consistent with nose - light acidity, pleasant lemony quality.  Salt is barely detectable.  Clean yeast and light biscuity malts are also present.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a refreshing carbonation and an easy acidity.  All and all very pleasant and easy-drinking.  If it wasn't labelled as a Gose, I'd just have assumed it was a Berlinner Weisse.  The least salty of any Gose's I've tried.  I'd love to see this beer in tallboy cans."

"On tap at the El Gato Cantina in Burlington.  Goes great with Mexican food!"

"My desert island beer. Love this stuff. The bottles are amazing, it's always beautiful on draft or from a growler... I just can't get enough."
""

"Overall interesting, very Berliner Weiss like, tart sour lemony flavours with grainy doughy yeasty dry finish, nice coriander, touch of salt, and general gose characters too, but quite tart. Definitely light refreshing summer drink."

"A restrained gose. Medium lemon tart qualities in the front. Not much saltiness in the back with a good wheat backbone. More full flavored than the Anderson Valley version, but less tart and flavorful than Westbrook's."

"Overall- A phenominal summer brew. I hope they bottle the Gose with Currents at some point!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice and peachy example of the style. Never had a gose like this. Tastes like a Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat with a gose's saltiness. Would definitely get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Gose seems like one of the best hot day beers along with Berliners and IPAs for me. This is a nice example of the style and it is good to see it being made in New England. A style that deserves more exposure."
""
""
""

"Overall: This is a tasty, refreshing, easy drinker. I'm drinking it outside on a nice day and it's just great for that. Well done brew."

"On the whole, an exceptionally well-crafted gose. Refreshing and smooth, incredibly easy-drinking. Would pair amazingly with seafood, wish this was bottled in MA so I could take some down to the Cape for the summer."

"I'm having this after a malty Amber, and this is lip puckeringly sour. Light bodied with plenty of spritz. It becomes smoother as I drink it. In fact, the subtleties come through toward the end of the glass--there's a creaminess that really adds to the flavor. The aftertaste is surprisingly short."

"Updated from a 4 'Had' rating, would still be a straight 4 for me if not for a slightly lackluster appearance. I've had this a number of times on-tap and from the bottle and consider it a great U.S. example of the gose. It's on the funkier side of things of the style, reminds me of a berliner weisse in some ways. Tart lemony seasalt goodness, crackers/bread. Good light feel with swishy carbonation."

"O: Gose seems to be the flavor of the month in VT right now; a very good example."
""
""

"Hazy straw-yellow pour with a thin layer of white head that receded to a ringlet; minimal lacing. In the nose, lemongrass, crackery malts, herbal and spicy. Unlike some goses where the salt component is more implied than anything, it was very prominent in this beer. The beer had a very distinct three-part effect on my palate: up front, it started off like an earthy Berliner weisse, funky, crackery, with a good dose of coriander; mid-palate, tart and fruity, notes of lemon and stone fruit; finished markedly briny, confusing the salivary glands in a pleasant way. Very nice! Light-medium body, complex and drinkable, even if it's not something I'd want to stick with all night long. But definite points for complexity. Overall a good interpretation of this relatively newly-resurrected style."
"I've had Lost Nation's Gose on 2-3 occasions now from Growlers that have been brought back to MD from Vermont. I've tried 3-4 Gose's now and Lost Nation's is probably the best or one of the best out there. It is the perfect balance of saltiness and tart. A few other Gose's I've sampled were more sour/tart than the Lost Nation one, however the overall flavor profile of Lost Nation's was better. Extremely sessionable and thirst quenching. One of the most delightful summer beers / session beers one could ask for."
"Poured on-tap and served in a nonic, the beer is a bright, light, golden-yellow coloring with a thin, filmy, bright white head. Nose of tart and floral, with a grainy backbone. Subtle sour notes. Flavors are smooth fruit sweetness initially, with apple and pear tart and sweet afterwards. Smooth and crisp in mouth. The aftertaste is tart fruit and sweet, with a dry, lingering finish. Very easy to drink, and very refreshing."
""
"This was my first Lost Nation beer and I was definitely impressed. I'm excited to see more breweries producing this style, which is particularly refreshing on a warm, breezy summer evening."
""
"O-enjoyed this beer, only one I have had of the style, but look forward to trying more to get a better sense of which ones are the best examples of the style"

"Overall - It's a pretty good beer. Every time I have a Gose I wonder why someone thought salt in beer was a good idea."
""

"I expect great things!"

"Enjoyed on-tap at the Mule Bar, Winooski. The beer has a cloudy, pale straw appearance with a head forming at the sides. Nose is briny and lemony, smells like something to chase down oysters (which the bar serves). Very pleasant taste-the salt presence is in balance with lemon, citrus peel, and spice (coriander). A nice sipper on a summer afternoon, plus of the few goses I've had, this one is enjoyable and not just a novelty salt beer. Very clean finish and lively mouthfeel to coat the tastebuds."

"Poured into a hefeweizen glass. Color was a slightly hazy golden amber, with a very thin bright white head. Head didn't last long, but had nice cling, with numerous streams of carbonation rising from the bottom. Not really cloudy at all. Aroma had a small hit of bitter, but a nice malty smell, with some citrus that had a bit of kick to it from a tad of spice. Flavor was a tart lemony with a strong salty note. Not overpoweringly so, but enough to stand out. Dry in the mouth, but yet had a bit of stickiness at the same time that was odd. Overall, a nice change from the norm. Flavor was bit unusual to be sessionable, but was nicely drinkable with no real downsides."

"Some random strangers suggested to try this new brewery and I was passing by and did. What a great suggestion! I had a pint of Fose with my Philly sandwich. The sandwich was great and the salt tinged Gose complimented it nicely. Great golden color, very little head and no lacing. Bready nose, but the flavor had all the tart/salt goodness one expects from this style. Very forward and not watered down at all. An beautiful smear beer. Wishing I lived closer, this place has a good future."

"an outstanding gose, one of the more intense ones ive had. this pours a clear golden color without a lot of head, unassuming to say the least. the nose is light on the coriander, not as herbal heavy as some of them. the flavor is super bold, not understated at all. bright and snappy salty malty goodness, where the herbal element highlights the main ingredients, not takes over. there is come citrus here, and some light wheat malt, but the mouthfeel is what makes this beer so unique to me. its not quite salty, but its not held back at all, and its got this gnarly power of sucking all the moisture out of my mouth almost instantly, almost pucker in that way, but it makes me want to drink another sip time and time again, its just lovely. so much character for such a light beer, I wish there were more of these gose styles around, but as it stands this one is near the head of its class."
