Flavour is sour with tart fruity lemon and lemon peel, as well as salt. Finishes of with a long tarty fruitiness ending with notes of sweetly lemon drops","jbaker67","Nov 01, 2013"

3.73,-9,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Ordered a glass at the barrel house in Portland after getting sweaty on my bike. Damn this hit the spot. This hazy yellow beer is sour, but not wild. It has a straightforward, almost clean tang. The malts are very mild under the sour, with a subtle bready wheat and toast character. Instead of the banana and spice of normal German wheat, this is big on the tangy grapefruit and lemon zest sour.","tempest","Sep 19, 2012"

3.5,-14.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Diaphonous grainy yellow with off-white, fleeting foam. Nose is briny and sour with some hints of grain, salt, pepper and yeast. The flavor is sour for the style - lemon, grain, hints of triscuits. The finish is a littles saliated and gives off a green olive brine character dominated with lactic tart. Thin and wet. This is a tasty beer, and I purchased a grenade of it, but I wouldn't place it too high among Gose's.","harrymel","Aug 01, 2012"

3.5,-14.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is light in body and mildly salty, the salt definitely takes a back seat there. The lactobacillus character is low and there is a floral sense to this beer that isn't unpleasant. I don't know what I expected but this beer let me down.","drabmuh","Oct 02, 2011"
3.66,-10.7,4,3,4,4,3.5,"o - Overall I liked this gose. I liked the sourness to it, especially in the taste, and just would have liked a little bit of a stronger nose. Would certainly try it again.","mdfb79","Oct 02, 2011"
3.38,-17.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear golden color with a small white head without much retention and no real lacing. The nose carries a slight cider character with a light bit of malt. The flavor is a tiny bit malty with a very light dosing of salt and a bit of a red-apple character. Mild cider. Light body with good carbonation and a slight dryness. Fairly good, though quite plain.","Thorpe429","Sep 29, 2011"
3.67,-10.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer is pale yellow and clear, with minimal head that rapidly fades to nothing, leaving no lacing. The aroma is slightly sour and funky, with notes of citrus. The flavor is a step up from the aroma, with more salt presence. Nice citrus flavors. Slight sourness, but not puckering. The body is fairly thin, with low carbonation. Overall, a tasty beer. I would have this again.","Huhzubendah","Sep 12, 2011"
3.97,-3.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This was my first shot at trying a Gose and I really liked it. There’s a solid base of flavorful sweetness and spice to this but then the tartness and crispness came in to keep this not only easy drinking but even a bit quenching on the palate as well. This was unique but still very accessible to me. I’m glad that I gave it shot and I’d definitely be willing to check out others like it down the line.","Kegatron","Sep 10, 2011"

4.13,0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is a light bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Visually it looks like a very effervescent brew but when it hits the mouth it is only lightly bubbly in the mouth, yet bubbly enough to keep it light and refreshing in the mouth and feel. There is seemingly no alcohol impact in this brew, even for a listed 5% abv, I am struggling to accept that it is that. This is a very easily approachable brew and goes down very smooth. I have not had many takes on this style but this one is the best I have had yet. The salt flavoring is there without an awkward feel left in the mouth or being over-done. Give this one a try.","stakem","0"
3.95,-3.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer is a light yellow with a thin, white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is excellent. Light coriander with lactic tartnes are the most prominent notes. The coriander character is really fresh and vibrant. Salt is low, thankfullly. The palate opebs crisp, mildly overcarbonated, maybe? Flavors of wheat and coriander are present, this beer is very lightly salted, perfectly so IMO. Drying, crisp, clean and with a lactic finish with lingering coriander, this is excellent stuff. As it warms up, an aroma akin to chopped cilantro stalks appears. All told, an excellent gose, probably the best I've had","DefenCorps","Jul 16, 2011"

4.07,-0.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"No head, dissipation or lacing to speak of. Clear orange amber body, many small bubbles rising from bottom of the glass. Pretty funky nose, peaches, some other stone fruit I couldn't identify (white nectarines?) and apples, with no noticeable hop aroma. Big ass dose of tart and sour funk in the taste profile, some grassy hops. I do pick up the salt, but its pushed to the back by De Funk. Mouthfeel is medium light, not much effervescence, a bit sticky, with quite a dry finish, a very complex tasting beer. Drinkability is quite high, a good refreshing summer beer. This may be my favorite Cascade Gose so far, very tasty.","jdense","Aug 12, 2010"
4.2,2.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,5,"D: Refreshing and complex, this beer is a pleasure that could beguile almost anyone. While not extreme, it is unique enough that it does not immediately lend itself to comparisons with other beers (except perhaps to the Cascade winter gose that I got to sample from a companion's glass). I went to Portland hoping to try the gose at Upright, walked away disappointed that day, but was pleasantly surprised by this beer one day later.","beagle75","Aug 11, 2010"
4.27,4.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"With Berliner Weiss catching on to some breweries, will we see more Gose in the future? Cascade's Summer Gose would be a great example to cast and mold, even if it isn't 100% to Leipzig tradition.","DoubleJ","Jul 21, 2010"
4.64,13.2,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"D: I really haven't had much of this style, but this is a fantastic brew. I don't know why more brewers don't brew Gose.","Halcyondays","Oct 29, 2009"
3.53,-13.9,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"The body was very good, crisp, clean and refreshing. Drinkability was very good, I've had several of these at a local pub and enjoyed all of them. Overall, a very nice beer, worth trying when you see it.","beertunes","Beers"
4.25,3.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D: I think this is really intended to be a summer beer; right now I'm in the mood for other things, but this is done well enough that I'd pick it up again in the right season.","Arbitrator","0"
