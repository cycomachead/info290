"Overall this beer was amazing, I need to try more of this style for sure!!"
"Hazy gold with thin white head that disappeared quickly. Funky fruit nose. Pucker up salty/sour ""LemonHead"" goodness. Lite with a zesty lemon tongue. More please?"
""
""
""
"It took me awhile to get use to it. It tickles your palate with a salty sensation. Not overly strong on the sour side, but its different. As it warms up the natural sweetness of the beer starts to be forward. I'm glad i tried it. As for me I wont go out of my way to grab it."
"Nasty taste. Why anyone would drink is beyond me"

"Salty, very tart hard to finish. Salt taste overwhelming"

"This is my first gose, so I’m unsure how to score it. But it is interesting as all get out, far more than most wheat beers. After this I would like to try more!"
""
"Pours an opaque straw (which clears some as the brew warms), producing 2+ fingers of mineral water effervescent, somewhat lasting, frothy, white head that leaves a surface collar & a few motes & strings of lacing. Aroma has a low malt & no hop profile & offers little other than brine, tartness & is (if memory serves from chemistry classes long ago) marked by an acidic sensation in the nostrils. Taste opens with ocean water salinity & lactic acid sourness, persisting far into the sip & almost overpowering faint hints of wheat, green apples, lemon & lime in a peppery, clean, crisp, dry finish. Aftertaste is a much more potent salty lemon, lime & tart green apple version of Anderson Valley\'s The Kimmie, The Yink & The Holy Gose. Salty throughout. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation that rapidly dissipates as the brew warms, puckering, mouthwatering, crisp, prickly & dry. This style is often brewed with coriander however I pick up no coriander hints at all."

"Not a fan of sours"
""
"Just a bit too sour for me"
""
"Reminds me a lot of a Berliner Weiss. Nice and tart and light. A little bitter salty. Really good beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding!  As with most Gose not much to look at but interesting smell and outstanding flavor, perfect mix of salty and sour in my opinion.  Nice carbonation and pop on the tongue extremely clean and remarkably refreshing.  Extremely enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Hmmm... how does one rate a Gose if they have no basis for comparison? Well, I'm certainly going to try! Sours have never been my thing, but I've heard so much about this one in particular that I felt it would be a crime not to give it a try. With Westbrook in my backyard, and their stable of stellar beers, it had to live up to the hype, right? Sort of. Right from the start, the appearance is quite unappealing. Ugly even. Pours from the can in to a fluted pilsner glass with a cloudy, golden-yellow hue and a little transparency. Zero head. I wouldn't even know this is carbonated based upon the appearance. I hate to say this, but is looks like concentrated urine. The aroma is on par. Intense sour scents and perhaps a little lemon citrus are buried under a dirty urinal cake fragrance. Pretty gross really. Surprisingly, the taste completely transcends the other attributes. Fruity lemon-zinging tartness clears a path for a lingering grain flavor that imparts a little sweetness. The aftertaste reminds me a little of smarties candy, but with an obvious sour note. If you've ever enjoyed sour patch kids, this may be your beer. The body is thin & light, with a nice watery texture. Absolutely minimal carbonation. Just enough to give it a hint of effervescence. Surprisingly quenching, which invites the next curious gulp. One of the intriguing elements of this experience is that the sourness washes away pretty quickly, leaving behind a little residual saltiness. Then the salinity makes you feel compelled to take another drink. While this is certainly not for everybody, I have to imagine that the target audience agrees that Westbrook executed this one very well. If anything, this one got me curious to see what other Gose offerings are like. Isn't that the point of craft beer? To expand your horizons? Mission accomplished Westbrook."
""
""
"My expecpectations were somewhat reserved since I figured people in SC and GA that are rating Westbrook so well haven't been had much exposure to many other Goses out there.  I'm wrong.  This is the best Gose I've ever had.  It's amazing.  Perfectly sour/salty and even smells good (every other Gose has smelled bad but I've overlooked that.  If you like the Gose style you must try this one."

"By third sip it tastes like pure sea salt. Lost coriander flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The can doesn't lie; this is a delicious, light, refreshing beer. Definitely would make a fantastic summer quencher."
""
""
"Omg, so happy about this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer tasted like a wet sock at low tide.  I just don't understand the hype. What the hell is wrong with you people."
""
""
""
""
"O: I never had anything like thi before.  While I wouldn't drink this every day, I am thouroughly enjoying it.  Everyone should try this beer at least once."
""
"Had this at the Brauhaus in Philly. Great sour beer. Not overly sour just a nice hint. 1/17/15"
""
"Light bodied easy to drink. So much flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting brew. Lots of sour citrus backed by the smoothness of the wheat. Drinkability is fairly good, though it's a little TOO sour to be truly sessionable, IMO. It is quite crisp and refreshing though, one of the best in that regards. Very nice example of the style, perhaps the best I've had (not that there's too many of them out there)."
""
"Better get some before it gose."
""
"my favorite canned gose.  delicious and refreshing.  an everyday beer."
""
""
""
"This is not a good introduction to the gose genre. Now is it a good gose?  Yes, but man is it intense. Heavily dosed with sea salt and lemon, it's a fun beer, for sure."
"Overall  - Very Enjoyable brew. I'm fairly new to the style but have to go with this as my fave"
""
""
""
""
"So it seems my first experience with this style of beer will probably be my last but I am glad I tried it."
"New to the style? Take two sips. One to shock your pallet, and the next to decide if you like it. Most will either love or hate this beer. I don't expect many people to find it just ""ok""."
""
""
"Lemony, tasty salty thirst quencher. Fun sour."
""
"Well worth a try"
""
"Overall: Probably the best Gose I have had. I look forward to drinking a lot more of this style in the new year to come, especially in the warmer months!"
""
""
""
"Wonderful and delicious but a tad too salty with a nice bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I haven't had many beers in this style to compare this one with, but if you put this side by side with Anderson Valley's The Kimmie, The Yink, & The Holy Gose, I don't think I would be able to tell the difference. Made an excellent pairing with a Thai yellow curry dish. The citrus in the beer really goes nicely with the bright flavors of the curry and the sourness cuts right through the spice."
"One of the better Gose available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Super flavorful and I didn't find it overly salty as is a turnoff for me in some Goses. Great beer!"
"This was the second gose I've tried and arguably my favorite.  I loved the sour notes and how clean and refreshing this beer was!"
""
""
"Light and crisp in nature, if you are a fan of tasty sours, this one will do you right! at 4% abv, you can easily have a six pack or two..."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz can served in a pilsener glass (thanks Joe!).  Pours a dull, milky yellow with a sizzling quarter inch bright white head the immediately disperses.  Nose expresses citric acid, a light yeasty quality and a hint of brine.  Taste follows nose - pleasantly tart, citrusy and salty.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively, effervescent carbonation and a mild acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands.  Probably only the third Gose I've ever tried.  Reminds me of a salty Belinner-Weisse.  Very refreshing - I'd love to have access to this during the warm weather."
""
"Cloudy yellow. Tart and salty, its tastes puts it generally into the category of the new style tart saisons. Really well done."

"I am probably the only person in the beer nerd world who did not love this beer.  First off it has no head and looks cloudy. It smells slightly sour and not in a good way. The flavor was like sour green apples mashed into the world's worst apple sauce. I love sour beers but I drain poured this."
""
"The perfect sour beer."
""
"Sour and salty. There hasn't been a better combo since nuts and gum!! In all seriousness.. I really enjoyed this sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  It kind of sucks that my introduction to Westbrook's Gose came in the form of its variants first.  I had the Gozu first, which was much complex with the full flavor of the Yuzu in it.  Then, I had the Gose Gone Wild, which was brought by its maker to a bottleshare.  The GGW is much more tart and more akin to a classic sour.  This is great, but really kind of pales in comparison to its brethren."
""
""
""
""
"I feel bad about rating this so low. I have become serious about the world of craft beer for the last 3-4 years and am quite new to rating beers on BA. I have been learning so much about different styles and was excited to try my first gose. The saltiness and sour nature of this beer really challenges my notion of what beer is. Sadly, the sour and salty feel was too off putting for me. Perhaps this style is simply not for me or it will become an acquired taste. For now I can only say ""blech!!!"" I don't see myself even finishing this one."

"Received via trade, crisp, sour, and very refreshing. The saltiness is not as present as I was fearing. The light nature of this beer makes it very easy to drink and the sour/tart nature keeps you from drinking too fast allowing the beer to be savored one drink at a time. Big thanks to AW for sending me a can as an extra in a trade!"
""
"Very nice beer.  We have a number of NW brewers out here that make excellent gose style beers, but none of them are quite like this.  Impressive."

"O: [2.25] I am pretty certain that the German word for Zima is Gose.  That is what this reminds me of - a Zima.  It is a citrus alcoholic beverage.  I was very excited to try this when I saw it at the store.  I think that this is a one and done for me.  I feel bad - I wanted to like it more but I don't."

"Only my second ever gose so I rate as a newbie. Better as it warms up and my palette gets used to the tartness that is ever so present."
""

"Not a beer for me."

"Aroma is lemony, saline, crackery, and slightly funky. Lemon dominates, but there's some musty character. Flavor is extremely acidic. Citric and acetic acid are huge upfront, though lactic surfaces mid palate, and acetic and citric carry into the finish. One of the more sour examples of the style. Salt weaves throughout, but it's countered by lightly bready malt in the finish. A little too acetic. Wish lactic were less overwhelmed."
""
"Overall: Been looking forward to this beer for a long time.  Super tasty and levels of complexity that many other Gose do not have.  I could crush this all day long."
""
""
"Golden straw color with a stark white head that fades fast and leaves little to no lacing.  Smell of wheat, grain, funk, lemon, lime, and sea breeze.  Flavor opens up with a nice tart lemon and lime bite.  Notes of grains from the wheat weave into the mix.  Finish brings a tart, spicy and salty finish.  Prickly mouthfeel from the carbonation, light body and dry finish is nearly perfect.  Overall this is just a great beer that's refreshing and different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Canned 9/16, poured into a snifter.  Gold, yellow, cloudy with one finger of off yellow head.  Good retention.  Smells of fresh lemon and some tart candy.  Mouth feel is fizzy and sharp but exactly what was expected.  Taste is salt, sour, lemony goodness with a great balance of tart, salty, sweet and citrus.  Dry finish.  Yum!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very carbonated and fizzy!  Prickles my lips immediately.  Flavor is tart and crisp with lemon and lime and a little wheat twang. I also get just a bit of sweet fruit but that is gone quickly after each sip.  Finish is very dry and leaves a lingering tart across my palate.  I find this enjoyable but wonder if I would want more than one of these on any given day."
""
"Can: Poured a light yellowish color Gose with a nice pure white foamy head. Aroma of tart notes with light salty notes also discernable. Taste is a mxi between some tart and sour notes with a salty finish and limited coriander notes. Body is light with good carbonation. I had really high expectation considering all the noise this one is making but I thought it was an OK version of the style at the end of the day."

"Cloudy and hay colored. Good fluffy head to begins that's gone quickly. Slightly sour aroma, light grain. Tart, lime, clean, with the wheat playing second fiddle to the other components. Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Clean and sour from start to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Acidic and dry, the wheat gives it some softness and a dryness to keep it from scraping the tongue too hard.  It does meet the claim of being refreshing, as the body does lean light, but it's got that puckering sourness to it as well."
""
""
"Pours light golden with a short-lived bubbly white head that leaves minimal lacing.  The nose is crisp, spicy, green apple, lemon and a wisp of salt.  On the palate, tart, lemon and mild salinity, a touch grainy and a nice hint of must (in a good way).  It is light and bubbly and would be the perfect summer patio beer."
""
"Fantastic, pours cloudy like juice. Lemony smell and a bit of a tart and salty taste. Low ABV I could drink this all day long. Unfortunately not available in my area, because I would consume a case a week."
""
"O:  Too salty for my taste.  This beer is more of a novelty that should be shared at tastings just to finish off the can."
"Overall, a solid gose with lots of tart sour lemon and some salt."

"T: Umami is a good descriptor here. Sharply tart and salty upfront. A touch of a lactic twang with a backend of light wheat and coriander. Fades into sea salt and just a hint of citrus. Lemon is in there somewhere. Ridiculously refreshing and a fantastic take on the style."
""
"Thanks Chandler."
""
""
""
""
"My issues with this beer, and it may just be that I dont overly care for the style was that although it's only 4.0abv, It was a sipping beer, perhaps due to the saltiness. The other problem was that despite rinsing thoroughly with water and wiping off my lips, I found it near impossible to get rid of the saltiness, rendering the next beer I had slightly salty as well. Seems like this is a one and done last beer of the day for me."
""
"O-Although this beer may be too strong on the salt to be called ""authentic," the salt certainly makes it tasty and thirst-quenching. Indeed, the salt is strong, but I did not find it overpowering or annoying, and I could see drinking a few of these on a hot day. The mouthfeel is also perfectly matched to the flavor and style of the beer. A very solid effort."
"I bought this while on vacation in South Carolina. I love gose but found Westbrook to be overly sour and salty."
""
"Overall: this is an incredibly drinkable beer.  I would love to have this available in my area for hot days, tailgating and camping.  Great stuff."
""
""
""
"O:  The first time I had this beer was the first time I had a Gose.  I love this beer.  Very sour and tart but salinity balances.  Are with spiedie chicken, old bay shrimp and asparagus on the grill and it was delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky gold with little to no head.  The smell, is simply put, kind of off putting.   The taste starts off sour, then finishes in a way that's like drinking sweat.  Mouthfeel is midrange, the carbonation is  on the low side, and it has sense of being thick in a coating sort of way.  I had the amped up version of this (Artisanal) on draft and that it was tasty and explosive.   The aftertaste, smell, look, and finish need some work on this one."

"Rich hooked this 12oz can up a while back, finally getting around to enjoying it tonight... Thanks Rich!! Pours a hazy light orange with a virtually nonexistent head and no lacing... Nose is sharp coriander and lemony wheat with a definite briny element... with warmth a sorta yeasty/doughy element comes up and out of the glass. Flavor is surprisingly tart.. bright lemony lacto... the sour notes blow out most of the coriander except on the finish when it rebounds with a light saltiness... Much more sour than any standard Berliner I have had in a while and doesn’t have as much salt/coriander as the AV Gose... The body is light/medium and punctuated a bit by the residual wheat malt.. Drinkability is very high for the one (maybe a 2nd) can, but my stomach couldn’t handle much more in a session."

"Pour is hazy pale golden in color with a fairly tight white head.  Nose is citrus with a hint of lemon and strong sea salt.  Decent grain presence  Taste is fairly sour with moderate carb and lighter body.  Brighter tart lemon with plenty of salt and a fair bit of malt personality."

"Overall fairly alright but lacking a lot of malt depth that I associate with this, and a bit of an odd ball aroma."
""
"Overall - Nicely done. Balance of sour/wheat/fruits makes this enjoyable. Has the bite that gose beers are famous for but the other aspects are able to come out. Worth a drink for sure."
""
""
"Overall, I love this beer style. Sour, dry, crisp and refreshing, I could drink these all night. I don't know enough about the style to tell whether this particular one is good or bad, but all I know is overall they're delicious."

"Overall, I hope to see wider distribution of Westbrook even though I understand they are producing enough beer to satisfy their home state and limited distribution in their area.

"Pours turbid golden yellow with a tall, frothy head. The aroma is candy-like, with wheat and hints of lime. The flavor profile follows suit. The salty and sour elements compliment each other wonderfully. Lime flavors dominate the palate on the initial taste, with the saltiness lingering toward the back of the tongue. The saltiness also accentuates ""tongue-smacking"" that occurs with the sour flavors. Regarding the mouthfeel, the carbonation is just right for the flavor profile. Honestly, it's hard to drink this beer one sip at a time--it's that good. It's perfect for the summer."
""
""
""
"Pours a foggy gold-tinted yellow color with a quickly fading head. Tart, wheaty aroma...sourdough, lemon/lime, and just a whiff of coriander. Intensely sour from the start, acidic and crisp. Lemon and lime juices and salt brings to mind refreshing pool-side beverages. Fairly light and puckering, leaving the gums dry. Not sure I've ever had a Gose quite this sour. Refreshing!"
""
"Pours a murky yellow with minimal head, no light passage. Nose comprises of bready wheat and lemon zest with hints of tangy lactobacillus. The taste is where this beer shines. Starts with tangy tartness followed by huge notes of candied lemon and lemon zest. This is quickly followed by a dash of sea salt and a grainy wheat to finish. The finish is clean and balanced. A ton of flavor is jam packed into this 4% brew and this shows me how incredibly tasty a gose can be. I can see why people scoop up cases at a time of this, hopefully this somehow finds it's way into Chicago's distribution."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A delicious Gose from Westbrook, one of the most sour examples of the style and perhaps less salty, but delicious nonetheless. One of the more refreshing beers I've tried this summer, I could easily run through a case of this with ease, definitely a great warm weather beer."

"I call this the perfect session beer. If you're into sours, you'll like this as a drinkable brew that you can drink a lot of to get your sour fix, as opposed to having to crack open expensive bombers. Not traditionally funky-sour, but definitely different and definitely good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is refreshing and confusing. It's salty and that makes me thirsty...for more of this beer."

"O: First beer of this style, but regardless it's a good beer if you like session beers, sours, wheats, berliner weisses. A good standard to measure the goses to come."
""

""
""
"Overall- Just fantastic in every way. This is easily the best tasting low alcohol beer I have ever tried. I could drink about 24 of these in a day and be a happy man."
""

"I have had a few from this style, and this is probably my favorite. Like a slightly salty Berliner. It is perfectly simple and Just all around incredible. I can't recommend this enough."

""
"O: My first Gose and this one is amazing. I am a fan of sour beers and was not expecting that from this, so it was a huge bonus. I am a fan of Westbrook as well, and look forward to more by them while I’m in South Carolina. Bought in Columbia Whole Foods though I saw it in Greenville Whole Foods as well."

""
""
""
"O: delicious and sour; kind of like the beer version of Shock Tarts! And love that it comes in cans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A really nice beer and an interesting take on the style. If you ask me, this more closely resembles a Berliner Weiss, but it's very good all the same. I'm really starting to appreciate the lower ABV styles, and Westbrook's Gose is one of the better low ABV sours out there. Definitely worth your time to seek out and enjoy."

"o: Kind of one dimensional, but what a dimension!"

"O - I haven't had a lot of beers of this style, but man is this good. Fruity and tart with that hint of salty flavor and they all blend nicely."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really nice gose, well balanced without softening on the acidity."
"Bottle from michaeljstraub in trade. Thank you!! Pours an attractive hazy yellow gold color. Smell is mainly wheat with a hint of tartness and lemon like brightness peaking through. Taste is significantly tart, then wheaty and I’m not certain I pick out any saltiness. Body is full, and prickly carbonation. Perfect mouthfeel and very drinkable and refreshing. This is actually quite sour and very enjoyable."

""

"This is as fantastic as you have heard. Pours cloudy and very pale yellow with a scant head of perfectly white foam that falls fast and leaves fleeting lace. Nose is tart with citrus and something sour. A bit of wheat and sweetness and a some earthy coriander. The nose is like a kind of perfume. It's hard to describe. The taste is outrageously good. All the tartness of lemon, the brightness of the lemon peel, the earthiness of the coriander. The crisp and dry wheat malt. Rather than an outright taste of salt, there is a saline aspect in the composition of the palate. it is at once complex yet simple. It's refreshing and has an underlying sweetness that is subtle. It's dry and while it's not salty the saltiness contributes to the overall mouthfeel and texture of the beer. It's thirst quenching, it's aromatic , it is an instant favorite."

"Overall, I can see why people like this beer, especially by virtue of the fact that it's a summer-friendly beer that comes in cans. If I could go to the store and grab a sixer of this on the way to the beach or ballgame, it would be a no brainer. That said, there are a couple of beers in the style that I like a little better, just because the overall beer is a little more subtly done; of course those don't come in cans, and are a bit pricey, since they have to traverse the Atlantic to hit store shelves. If you have access to this beer and like brews with sour components, don't hesitate to grab this one."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice delicious gose, a touch sweet."
"O- this was definitely unlike any beer I've had, the play on saltiness and sourness leaves you wanting more on every dry finish. I'd love to get more of this"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Incredibly unique and delicious beer. The fact that it comes in six packs for such a low price raises the status of this beer IMO. Satisfies my sour tooth for cheap. Highly recommended."

"wow. weird....smells like a sour barbeque.... can you imagine that? yes, sour. yes, salty... interesting, very interesting... hazy light yellow, sour aroma, bbq-remember? easy to drink-VERY easy to drink, kind of sour but goes down easily. not tasting the wheat or coriander."

" The flavor is very citrus and tangy with zesty bright wheat and fruity yeast w/ slight salted lemon aspect with mild wheat flavor which is dominated by the sour elements from the yeast. There is also an earthy quality toward the end with more sour and salt lingering after the swallow. Overall this is great a lot more sour than traditional versions but a solid take on the style and refreshing - very good worthy of a try if you like sour wheats."

"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, pale, yellow-maize coloring with a halo of white filmy head and a slow flow of carbonation throughout. Aromas of tangy sweet white grapes, salt, toasted grains, subtle buttery notes, and white wine characteristics. Flavors are crisp and tart forward, with a blast of sour right behind. White grapes, sea salt, and tannins on a subtle toast backbone. The body is light, but full at the same time. Tart and salty aftertaste, which dries you out slightly, begging you to drink more. Dry, clean, crisp finish. Unbelievable drinkability on this beer. Fantastic!"

"This is my first review for a Gose, and I hope this style continues to become more popular. I don't think of sour and salt as attributes I would want in a ""refreshing"" drink, but I do believe in beers with unique flavor profiles. Westbook Gose is nicely sour, lightly salty, and extremely interesting. I definitely want to experience this again."

"Taste is delightfully sour with a nice little salty twang, like a salt-rimmed berliner! If there has ever been a beer made for chugging this is it, even this brief review will not outlast these 12 ounces. The malt is light and crackery with the carbonation wonderfully scrubbing. This is delicious, a perma-want for me, I would never, ever turn one of these down. My favorite gose of all-time, definitely more sour than any others I have had."

"Westbrook Gose is just a flat out awesome beer. It’s savory but quenching. Acidic with a mineral kick. I feel like I’m getting my daily essentials while drinking this beer. It’s a perfect summer drinker. Thanks again, Wil! Keep ‘em coming."

"Taste is out of this world for a 4% sipper. Tart pineapple, lime salts like the ring of a margarita glass. Feel is less than average carb and a step above juice, finish is crisp and dry"

""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, Its hard to say if I liked Westbrook's Gose or Gozu more. I think Gozu had a ton more citrus, but, this Gose is more traditional and salty. Either way, both are really nice."

"O- one of the best gose's ive had. It portrayed the traditional style but added a good amoint of tart citrus to the finish. The fact it comes in a can gives it an added bonus keeping that sunlight out and having a low abv at 4% is perfect for an all day sipper on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - I like one, but I don't think it is something I would session, despite the low ABV."
"a great can of gose here, i wish this was available out here all summer long. one of the better american incarnations ive seen, a little higher in salt than most, it really works. some cloudiness to the light copper colored beer, and a solid inch of long lasting white foam on top. it smells great, lots of sourness, and lots of coriander giving it an herbal element that jives nicely with the mineral content of the salt. the salt also gives it a lot of body for a low alcohol wheat based brew, its frothy and sudsy and robust in feel. the taste is balanced really, with a flavorful wheat malt and a nice coriander presence, but i dont get such an herbal hit as i do from the smell. the salt rounds out the finish, i mean, its not salty at all, but its earthy and clean, quick finishing and refreshing. it somehow feels nutritious, good for me, i dont know, one can was not nearly enough. i may have enjoyed the citrus hit of the the gozu more, but this is downright awesome with just enough lactic tartness to make it unique. lovely."

"An outstanding example of my favorite hot weather style- the fact that it's in cans for summer fun is a plus. Like a good Gose, this beer is sharply tart, and just salty enough to really taste it and whet the palate for more. While it is spiced with coriander, I could use a bit more of that for balance and to round out the finish. This can be a polarizing style- it's certainly not for everyone, but if you want a well put together Gose on the sharper side that's sour and refreshing, look no further."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich light golden hued with exceptional cloudiness. Head was minimal and entirely dissipates. Aroma is slightly sour and a touch salty with just a trace of citrus. Mouthfeel is salty,very bitter and heavily carbonated. The flavor is slightly sour with a citrus like component and very salty. The coriander is used gently and because of it it blends well with the citrus and saltiness."
""
""
""
"this is the first I've had of this style and I did not like it. I'm writing this so my rating does not discourage anyone from trying this since it has a lot of good reviews and I know many people that like this beer. I think this is just not the style for me right now."

"The label pretty much takes care of it. Sour, salty, delicious. Don't know what you need me for. It's a great cloudy lemony color. I could drink this all day. You get a little lemony citrus on the nose, but dive right in and drink this up. It's delicious. The tartness is restrained and maybe properly as the salt just amps the flavors up a bit. Great beer."

""
""
""
"Can from Adam. Thanks man! Pours a cloudy light yellow color with a one finger white head that recedes quickly. Aroma is heavy sour and salt as the can says, lemon peel, interesting. Flavor is like a tart lemonade with some salt added. A bit of wheat and dirty finish lingering. Light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Crisp finish. I like that Westbrook decided to make something different. Not bad, and definitely a change up from the norm. Tangy for sure."
""
""

""

"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is pretty much sensory overload but balanced freaking beautifully. Tart, yet sweet and fresh with grain but also salty and savory. This is no question the best gose I have had. It has a very mild spoiled grain to funk touch but all the pleasant qualities trump that minor gripe. Wow, need more of this. Thanks Josh!"
""
"O: A really nice interpretation of the style. Super drinkable and very much along the lines of a Berliner, really leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to try this one come summer."
""
"O- I've only had a couple of goses in the past but this is the only one that's been truly memorable. At first, I didn't think I could drink something like this all the time but now I'm thinking I might've been wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-high intensity, resulting in a slightly fizzy (1/5), foamy (2/5), and then smooth (2/5) mouthfeel. Closes quite dry, with moderate stickiness coating the palate and lips."
"O: An enjoyable and great session beer. It's simple, but very unique and tasty."
""
""
"O-great example of the style, refreshing and easy drinking, really enjoyed this"
""
""
"Westbrook has been hit or miss for me, but this is a solid smash over third. Simple, lovely, & a very good beer."
"Pours out very clouded golden/orange with a head that falls quickly. Love the sour edge of this. And as the can states, it is salty. Lemon edges on there too. This is a nice beer. Haven't really had a lot of gose in my time, but I'd be perfectly fine with all others tasting like this."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is really, really tasty. It takes the degree of haziness beyond the level of what the available guidelines suggest in my opinion. But outside of that, it's extremely well-done. Recommended for everyone to try - a good example of a polarizing style."
""
""
""
"light sour note, wheat malt quality. tart, effervescence in the nose. turbid dark straw color. pours with generous head that falls quickly to zero head. sharply sour, lactic/acidic, a light cereal note in the finish. dry. really refreshing. the salt and spice are done very subtly. you can perceive a touch of salinity/mineral taste in the middle to finish."
"I'd drink it again in a heartbeat."
"O- holy crap is this a phenomenal beer. A canned, refreshing sour? Sign me up!"
""

"O - I gave it a 3.75 - I'm warming to the style."
""
""
"I wish I had a case of this. While its kind of ugly looking, its very easy to drink, super flavourful and leaves me feeling quite satisfied even though this is a 4% session beer. This is putting the Gose style on the list for me and I am looking forward to seeking out more examples of this bygone style."
""
""
""
"Westbrook's Gose is as close to the style descriptors as I have ever found in the style. Perhaps many will want a drier and less malty taste and texture, I rather like the balance here as I appreciate all things ""Berlin"" in one beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably one of the most unique beers I've ever tasted. Who would of thought a salty, sour wheat beer would be so damn drinkable. Definitely a beer to seek out. Gotta tip my hat to Westbrook Brewing Co. for taking a stab at this style."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty solid example of the style. More sour and salty than others that are similar, this one is a great American version of an old German style."
""
""
"O - Westbrook is a great brewery. I've loved everything I've had from them so far. This one though I didn't like, but since this was my first gose, I choose to believe it is a good representative of the style."
"O - Great beer. It looked like a mimosa and kinda tasted like one also. Had that margarita with the salt rim taste. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

"O-my first representation of the style, so I can't exactly review based on style but I am not a fan of Gose's so far"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A unique approach to the style with the tartness and citrus, but this brings out a strong character and makes the beer unmistakeable. It's both a complex beer to sip slowly and analyze and smooth sipper for summer afternoons. Just outstanding like most Westbrook goods."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy straw with a quickly fading, fizzy head. One word best describes the aroma - sour! Smells like no other beer I've ever had! Bitter and sour strike the palate front and center followed by spice and salt notes. Finishes sour. Very light bodied with effervescent carbonation make this an extremely drinkable. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by ths beer, it was perfect with sushi on a very warm, late summer evening. Great job Westbrook!"
""
"The beer is light orange and hazy with a half inch of white head that quickly fizzes away to nil. The aroma brings sourness, citrus, funk, earth, salt. Puckering from the onset with salt character immediately following. Light acidity with spritzy carbonation tickling the palate. Sweet tropical fruit, particularly pineapple. Well done."
""
""
""

"Overall: Skanky, but deliciously, even refreshingly so. Can you imagine? Can y-- Well, you can probably imagine, but yeah. Skanky!"

""
"O: A delicious Gose. I really enjoyed this one. Nicely balanced with a high drinkability. I'm interested in trying the cans that will be fresher than the bottle."
""
"Feels ""trendy"" because of the sourness. Probably wouldn't bother with this style again."
""
"o - Overall a very nice gose, teetering on the berlinerweiss side. The salt is pretty minimal compared to other goses, and the sourness is huge for a gose, those not as vinegary as some wilds. The lightness and light sourness is what reminds me of a berliner. Whatever the style, this is a good beer I'd definitely have again."
""
""
"Overall - This is a great canned offering from Westbrook."

"O: very tart and interesting beer with one of the more extreme divergences I've encountered between smell and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. Surprised me at first because I've never had this style of beer. But it's good."
""
"Overall: Its the most intense beer at 4% abv that I have ever drank. Its not for the faint of heart! That is for sure. It was a really challenging beer for my taste buds that is how intense it was... I look at what I have wrote about the smell and flavors in this beer and think to myself ""how can I like these unusual flavors of this beer?"" For some reason they do work together in some harmony to make a unique beer."
""
""
""
"O - This is an amazing beer that really surprises you with how big it is and how much flavor it has despite being only 4%. In the year where sour wheat beers like Gose and Berliners are making a comeback, this one really stands out."
""
""
""
""
"O: great flavors and feel in what I understand to be a good representation of the style, certainly a great introduction to the Gose, as this is a very refreshing and highly drinkable beer"
"Very sour upfront, acidic and crisp, sour lemon and crabapple notes, light grainy note in the aftertaste. Very dry and puckering finish. Light bodied, very crisp and acidic. As it warms, there's a sharp note of acetic acid, like cider vinegar. Probably why the brewery recommends to drink cold at 45º. Alternately tangy, creamy, and puckeringly sour. Very quenching and probably the most sour Gose i've tried. Had to have another after the first. Great stuff."

"overall amazing. if you like super sour!"
"Can in New Belgium chalice. This beer is the tits. A sour in cans that is reasonably priced and easily found in my area is fantastic. This beer hits you with its aroma upon pouring it into the glass, redolent of salt and coriander. The color is hazy and almost straw colored. The taste is sour and salty and absolutely perfect for a Lowcountry afternoon. HIghest recommendation I could offer."

"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
""

"The color was like liquid gold, pale, yet somehow deep, due to the murkiness of the body. The foam fizzed briefly to for a thin floating head before fading away, and leaving behind a still liquid that looked like raw sugarcane juice. The smell was sour and biting, and somewhat reminiscent of a Lambic. The taste showed off both the sourness and salt, as this tasted more like an unsweetened cider than any other beer I have had before. I have had the German Gose a long time ago, but I hon't recall it being this bold. Very light and refreshing to drink, and the 4% alcohol made it quite easy to drink. The finish was a lingering, puckering sourness. I only picked a single can this time, but I think I will get more, while the days are long, and the summer sun still lurks about."
""
"Very refreshing, tart beer with lots nice lemon favors. I could drink this all day in summer."
""
""
"O- Very interesting beer. Have not had many Gose beers, but this one is by far the most tart and salty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy gold color with a large white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very subtle, citrusy and yeasty. Taste is very interesting, this is the first beer I've had of this style. Very sour, that fades to a briny salty, sweet finish. There is some slight sulfur character in the finish as well. The mouthfeel is quite good. Medium-high carbonation along with the sourness makes the beer very refreshing and crisp. Definitely glad I picked this one up to try. I always enjoy trying a new style whenever possible. I would definitely drink this again. Needless to say, if you don't like sours, you won't enjoy this, however I would suggest you give it a try because I found it's an acquired taste."

"There was another unwelcome flavor note in the finish and aftertaste - namely cheapo college light lager. What's that doing in there?! I don't get how the initial taste and the midpalate could be so much about the clean tart citrusy sourness and then devolve to that stale, backwashy Milwaukee's Best Light flavor right at the end. The good news is that the cure for that aftertaste is to take another sip and get that nice sour freshness to wipe it away... until that one devolves too. Point is the can goes fast. I'll try this again and see if my experience changes."

"O- Once accustomed to how this thing drinks, it is very enjoyable. An ideal summer beer--refreshing and low ABV. Definitely try this one if you find it--pretty solid value too. Good stuff."

"O- Very refreshing beer, very clean finish, perfect for the summer time. Low ABV, and much like a little twisted berliner style beer. Seek it out if you ""can"".."

"Totally good beer."

"Absolutely fantastic beer, sour and salty and deliciouse. Doesn't have the best nose, kind of smells like sweat. Tart somewhat salty taste is refreshing. Medium body and high carbonation give it a crisp mouthfeel. Only beer of this style I've ever had, but I really enjoy it."

"Yellow and super hazy appearance would have given this a 5 but head was kinda quick to disappear. Nose is of clove and tart wheat very nice... wow flavor is really great sour, salt prepare for the tartness for sure. Nothing to sweeten this beer out and a nice bready, biscuit character rounds out on the back of the tongue. If you like that really sour punch on the tongue this is awesome. Will buy more and more."

"Overall - Surprisingly good. I've had a lot of bad goses. This is probably the best I've had."
"This beer reminds me a lot of Berliner weisse. I do love the gentle tartness, and the balance from the salt. An almost perfect summer beer."

""
""
"Poured a clearish orange with minimal head that left no lace. A sour spell with mild spice but I'm not picking up much else. The beer is enjoyable and a little better than the aroma; the balance is there so it is not too sour or tart; some citric tastes and spice and there beer is smooth and is easy to drink. I have not had too many beers of this style but this one is light and enjoyable.."

"O: Very easy to drink and extremely refreshing, especially on a hot summer afternoon. Definitely a stand out example of the style and one I would gladly have again."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink for the style. It has just enough sourness with little if any saltiness."

"O – This is a very interesting and extremely refreshing beer. As others have said, this may be the perfect lawnmower beer. At only 4% ABV, it is extremely drinkable, and you can have a good amount before you start to feel it. I’m going to be looking out for more beers from this style for sure. Another hit from Westbrook!"
"This poured out as a very pale yellow color... almost an off milky white color with a decent looking white head on top. The lacing is thin along with the retention on this . The smell of the beer is grainy with some citric acid sourness and a touch of mineral-like saltiness. The taste is pretty tart upfront. not much of the malt comes through until the finish where the salt also shines a bit. The mouthfeel is very light, very crisp and refreshing. Overall it's an exceptional example of the style. I'm not big on the more sour Gose's but this one worked for me. Definitely worth trying."

"Pours a very hazy, light almost yellow. Nice white 1/2 inch head. Not a lot of lacing as you drink it. Very impressive at first taste. I don't think I've ever had a Gose, but I'm a huge fan of sours, and this one is right up there. Sour, salty, and amazingly refreshing. I am a huge fan of this beer and will definitely keep it stocked in my collection."

"O: Another win for Edward and Morgan Westbrook and their team. Count myself lucky to live near this fine brewery."
""
""
"O: As I said above, this is my first experience with a Gose, and needless to say I will be back to the style. What an impressive beer. Highly recommend this one!"

"Thanks to Chris. Pale blonde. Lightly hazy. Nice and tart. Light wheat. Acidity is great through the finish."
"o - i haven't much experience with goses (this is my 2nd) but this one is delicious and refreshing."
"O: Nice and refreshing, light and summery."
"I don't like to gush about beers. But Westbrook is a brewery, that in my mind, has proven their commitment to producing beers of exceptional quality. And while I have partaken of several of their offerings (and thoroughly enjoyed them) the Gose stands out as a truly world-class beverage. Light, crisp, citrusy, sour, salty, and delicious; this beer was crafted for kids who loved sour candies and then grew up. It is bright and refreshing without completely overpowering the palate, despite the intense flavor. It has a very light mouthfeel, much like a skim or 1% milk, but the flavor asserts itself onto your tastebuds and then vanishes leaving a memory of tart salty goodness that lingers for a moment and then is gone. Drink it and prepare to be amazed."

"Served this Gose sour wheat beer at the brewery, on tap, in a pint glass. Poured a cloudy lemon color, produced a small white head, and featured poor retention. Above average lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this German Sour beer consisted of malted wheat, coriander, and lactic acid. Medium in body, this ale had a foundation of malted wheat, sour lemons, sea salt and coriander. Aggressive amount of tart/sourness- Salty it made you want to go back for more. First example of this style that I have sampled, so i dont have much to compare it too, but I will say that this was very good and I look fwd to trying more beers of this style."
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy bone colored head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some grain and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic finish after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and super drinkable."

"O - Highly enjoyable brew! So glad I was able to get at least something from Westbrook."

"O - Probably the best gose I have ever had. A much bigger beer than Upright, which was way more subdued. Both very good beers, slight nod to Westbrook. Definitely not a swing and a miss."
"Hay colored with plenty of haze; good head and medium retention. Softly sour and generally clean aroma with some malts hanging out at the back. Tastes only lightly salty and mildly tart but each sip begs another. Light bodied, clean and refreshing, pretty much a perfect summer beer without being overly simple. I liked it and highly recommend it!"
"Beer is medium to light in body and really creamy, strong, mildly salty interesting. Almost no yeast comes through at all. I still like the Upright one better but this one is quite good."

"Note to ALL brewer(ies): Make more Gose's!"

"Flavor matches the aroma, but adds a delicious layer of bright tartness that puckers the sides of the mouth and tongue. Lots of wheat, coriander, and citrus. Could use a hint more saltiness, though, but it's a minor nit-pick. Mouthfeel is crisp and juicy with a perfect carbonation level. Love the sourness, and it finishes dry and clean. I could have easily downed the entire bomber of Westbrook Gose without batting an eye, but I'm glad I could share it with friends. Delicious stuff!"
"Smells of salty sea air with light notes of coriander and vague sweetness. Just enough malt sweetness to keep the salty/lemon juice combo from becoming completely puckering. Crisp and clean finish with light grain and coriander flavors. Overall a very solid stab at the style. The folks at Westbrook certainly aren't shy about variety, and as with this Gose, the results are generally positive. Well done."

"Served from bottle into a Mother Earth strange. Poured a hazy golden straw yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a very minimal amount fairly quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, meringue, lemon zest, citrus, and salt. The flavor was of sweet malt, salt, tart, citrus, lemon juice, lemon zest, lemon rine, and subtle oyster. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I have to be honest that the salt on this one really is the star of the show and makes sure to remind you of this well after each sip as it coats the palate without mercy. I thought it was kind of odd that I picked up on a subtle note of oyster meat on this one on the followthrough. However, it wasn’t too bad. Quite refreshing and an interesting flavor profile to say the least. Definitely worth a try for the true Gose fans and the curious alike."
"A+"
"O: A completely likeable, well made, and drinkable beer."
"O - Another phenomenal take on a obscure style from Westbrook. I cannot say how pleased I am to have a brewery that puts out products like this so close to my home. Keep up the great work!"
"This is the best beer that I have had from Westbrookand would love to see it in cans or 12oz bottles. If you are a sour drinker this is a don't miss beer. I look forward to consuming more over the rest of the summer."
"O - A winner from start to finish. Just the right balance of salty and sour, and no element overpowers the other. I have limited experience with the style, but this is by far the best. Well worth seeking out."
