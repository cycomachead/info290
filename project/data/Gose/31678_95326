Super light and drinkable, but has that little edge of real flavor and crispness over the aforementioned macro and others like it.

On my first sip I got wheat, grain, a little tart & coriander, but no salt. Second sip got all of that but then got a little salt too. Body is just right. Very nice drinking beer.

Grassy, funky wheat, corriander, tart lemon zest, and yogurt.  A light saltiness as well.  Taste follows the nose pretty well, a funky, spiced wit that got the lacto treatment.  I wish there was slightly more tart and slightly less corriander though.  Mouthfeel is crisp, appropriate for the style.  I wish it was slightly more tart and funky, though I do still really enjoy this beer.  I'm not a big wheat beer drinker but this is a go to summertime brew anytime it's around.","adapt313","Mar 13, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, coriander, sea salt, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, salt/spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lightly tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, coriander, sea salt, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, coriander, sea salt, wheat, cracker, bread, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, salt/spice, and pale malt flavors; with a good malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly saline/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.3%. Overall this is a very good Gose style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, salt/spice, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. It was not as tart as I was hoping for, but the flavors were very well balanced. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2015"

Very light in body with a mild, watery moutfeel, disappointingly so, this beer is moderately carbonated and feels OK on the palate. Decent stuff.","DefenCorps","Dec 05, 2014"

Head dissipates into a loose band around the shoulders.  Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution.  Nose expresses citrus, brine and a hint of coriander and sour mash.  Taste consistent with nose; however, less brine and more sour mash. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant carbonation falling just shy of bright.  This is probably my only second experience with the style so I don't have too many frames of reference to compare this to.  That said, this would make a great summer offering - reminds me a bit of a berlinner weisse/witbier hybrid.","Jwale73","Dec 05, 2014"

3.5,-7.4,,,,,,"Not sure where I'm coming out on this beer - don't think I've ever had a gose and I've been excited to try one.  It's a delicate light bodied beer - nice dark yellow color with medium haze and little to no head.  The taste as first seemed complex with a slight bit of Belgian, slight lacto acid but not at all overwhelming, and refreshing.  Can't get much smell out of it, and as I drink the beer down to better try to understand the taste profile, my thoughts keep moving to "this tastes more like a watered down ginger ale" to me - I guess the ginger taste I'm getting is a mix of the coriander and salt.  Kind of disappointing for me, but not a bad beer for fans of this style in my ever so humble opinion.  Nonetheless, I am excited try some of the other Off Color offerings.","hopley","Oct 22, 2014"

Aroma of bananas, clove, yeasty funk, pears, coriander.  As expected here.  Flavor follows with sweet bananas, yeast, corander, a bit of honey.  Mouthfeel is heavy for the style with big rich flavors alongside adequate to plus carbonation.  Overall a decent rendition of the style--described as a Witbier, but here looks to be a Gose.  As a Witbier, it falls a little short.  As a Gose, it's better than others I've had.  I would drink it again.","BMMillsy","Oct 13, 2014"

Metallic yellow color, has good shine to compensate for overall paleness, not any bubbles but what’s there are large and active. The nose is on the flat side, yeast, iron flecks, wet straw, brown dirt, the mixed white citrus struggles to maintain presence, minimal peach, apricot fruit scents, funky on the whole albeit more sugary as it warms. Medium-bodied, heavily carbonated with an active churn in the mouth. Corn syrup kind of sweetness, dough, honey and lemondrops, can’t say it is easy to discern any coriander although there is an undistinguished cooking spice thing there. Peach, yellow apple to cherry flavors. The wheat is clearer, here comes off more as bread than uncooked dough. Semi-tart ending tries to play up earthiness but, again, more metallic than the former. For its weight can be refreshing and strikes one as a dinner table beer more than a quaffer on its own.","farrago","Oct 01, 2014"

4,5.8,,,,,,"It looks like a Berliner weiße or Belgian witbier with a light straw gold body that's gently hazy and a short but creamy bright white head. The smell is a touch off-putting at first. To me it smells like spent grain, and perhaps a little bit of that "old bar" smell where dripping draft lines have left small puddles of beer in some unseen area, covered in white mold. Beyond that there's coriander, and the combination gives a bit of a wet straw or damp plywood character. The flavor is much the same, with the flavor of the lactobacilus coming in right up front, followed by bright coriander, and then sweet malt that gently fades away. It's tart, but not overtly so, and the balance of tart going to sweet is interesting. Oddly I find it a bit salty as well... ? ... and I see that it's listed on Beer Advocate as a Gose beer, but that's not on the label, nor is salt listed as a "secret ingredient"... but of course, it is (I checked their website). So now it all makes sense. Well that's great. Personally I find the salt a bit strong, but that's up to the brewer to decide. It's curious, charming, and ultimately, refreshing and enjoyable. It's not the best gose bier I've had, but I'm impressed and I'll have to try seek out and sample more beers from them.","NeroFiddled","Aug 27, 2014"

The lemon was sweet and I wanted to taste tartness. There was no saline or salty finish and it did not finish dry. It tasted like cereal grain after a while and was bland and dull.

The nose comprises cracked wheat, coriander, orange zest, lemon zest, and a touch of black pepper. The taste brings in more of the same, a mild-but-still-definitely-very-present tartness pervading throughout, accentuating and complementing the wheat. The body is a strong light, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a pretty solid gose, something I could easily drink plenty of in the coming months.","TMoney2591","Jun 26, 2014"

Low carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Very creamy and smooth. Prickly and slightly dry. I'm no expert on gose but the tartness and salt are quite restrained.

Either way its not cheap for a bottle of 4% wheat beer. Appearance is a hazy yellow-orange, ok head. Aroma is a slight bit of bile at first which must be from teh lacto? Maybe not. The bile subsides and then a decent wheat aroma takes over. The flavor was quite mild and easy to drink, wheat and yeast but i didn't really taste any saltiness at all.","ArrogantB","Mar 31, 2014"

Smell is slightly sour with malt, wheat, lemon, and coriander aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour wheat, lemon, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel is very light and highly carbonated. This is a very refreshing and easy drinking beer. It reminds me a bit of a berliner with less tartness and more malt character.

I have to say that I bought this not expecting a sour beer. I probably should have known better when I saw wheat beer and coriander on the label. (Both traditional ingredients in Gose.) I've certainly had much better sour beer, but this wasn't awful. Any brewer willing to play with lacto is rather courageous and for that they should be commended.

Light bodied with great active carbonation. A very pleasant and refreshing gose. There is a nice wheat base and the mild tartness in the finish is deftly done and fit with the other flavors.
