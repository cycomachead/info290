4.41,-0.5,3.75,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Verdict: A lovely Gose from de Garde, bright, delicate, refreshing and super crushable. The fruit flavor is fresh and juicy, plenty sour without being crippling and the coriander and sea salt flavors add a nice counterweight, stunning for the style.","kevanb","Mar 08, 2015"

3.85,-13.1,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Pour is pale yellow, hazed, puffy white head.  Nose is very dusty brett, a hint of sea salt and mineral, orange peel, not really citrusy but husky peel, light hoppy pineapple behind.  Taste has a touch less going on.  A little bit of grain comes in up front, still a light touch of dusty brett, nicely hoppy, citrus and pineapple with a gentle bitterness.  Light body, well carbonated, semi dry finish.","cpetrone84","Dec 26, 2014"

Plenty juicy and fruity , this has a more white wine and mineral character than Hose. Great blend of coriander and lemon as well. The palate opens sour, though seemingly more as sour as Hose. Lemony, citrusy, mildly earthy, moderately mineraly, white wine grapes and a touch of salt are all present. Decidedly unorthodox, this is extremely delicious. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is quite light and airy on the palate. The sourness lightens it as well. Excellent.","DefenCorps","Oct 14, 2014"
