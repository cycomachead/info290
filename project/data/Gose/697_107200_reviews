"Nice plum notes in the smell and taste. Lightly sour and the sea salt adds a unique taste and smell not found in others. The beer is not excessively  sour but that's  a plus. Nice orange color."

"This beer has, as you might expect, mildly sour plum flavors. However, the flavors are very subdued and gentle--delicate, even. I didn't taste the salt that others have noted (and that is appropriate for a gose) but I wasn't looking out for it either. Beer is rather thin and light. A little on the crisp side. Definitely refreshing and pleasant but not super memorable."

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy golden color with a thin white head that dissipated quickly leaving little lacing. Quite nice looking. Scents of fruity esters, ume plums, salt water and apricot. Very nice, crisp and inviting, not overly complex, but very reminiscent of umeboshi. Taste begins with flavors of apricot, ume plum and a nice fruity sourness. In the middle sourness increases and a pleasant undercurrent of salt water appears. The finish is sour ume plum, salt water and a hint of grainy malt. Aftertaste is sour with grainy malt and salty undertones. A very refreshing flavor that combines ume a and other fruit flavors with salt and sour and a hint of grain. Very well done. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a wet, juicy feel. Very light and refreshing. Excellent. Overall this is an excellent ale, though I cannot rightly compare it to other goses. What it is, is a nice, refreshing ale with a nice, uniquely Japanese flavor. I recommend it."

"O- my wife tasted this beer and just said it tastes weird. Anyway. I like it. It's sour sweet and salty. Give it a try if you are fortunate enough to come across this unique brew from what must be Japan's most prestigious craft brewery."
