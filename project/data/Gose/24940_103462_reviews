"I'm forced to imagine someone at Almanac genuinely appreciates lemon verbena."

"The bit of sea salt is perfect!"

"O:  this is a pretty good beer with good flavors and a nice complexity.  I don't know how true to style this beer is but this doesn't seem to have any obvious faults and it seems to hit all the marks."
""
""
"Im not super familliar with the style but I feel like all the flavors work very harmoniously. Effervescence dances on the tongue. A very light head that dissipates quickly. The lemon Verbena, salt and corriander all work very nicely together with a very strong wheat finish."
""
""
""
"This beer is in your face, especially for being so light in ABV. It's full of highs, lows and I don't knows. But what I do know is it's interesting enough that the bottle will be gone quickly. That's kind of what counts right?"
""

" Final score: 3.64"

"Drinkability – Goes down easy at 5.0%abv.  It's a nice beer."
""
""
"Overall:  A decent Gose and saltier than some I have tasted;  I enjoyed the tart lime flavor but found the beer a touch unbalanced"

"Tart lemony nose with light grains. Pours hazy gold under a big white persistent finely bubble foam collar. This highly effervescent beer has a tart, lemony, salty refreshing grainy palate. It starts with a hint of fruity sweetness but the lemony tartness soon rules. There is a faint bitterness on the finish. In the beginning the beer is like drinking a cloud but on the finish a big carbonic burst triggers the pain receptors on your tongue and wipes the palate clean. Crisp and refreshing."

"Overall it's not terrible, not great either. Pretty solid for a gose, worth picking up and trying if you see it"

"Bomber poured into a snifter. The brew appears a clear golden yellow color with a white cap that is quick to fade. The smell of this is pretty much dominated by a fresh grainy scent. Not bad but also kinda lacking. The taste is surprisingly sweet with a fresh grain aspect before getting lemony and slightly mineral-filled. Somewhat fruity at times as it opens up. This is light bodied and moderately carbonated. It is easy drinking and fits the bill for the style."
"Pours a hazy gloden yellow, small head that faded to nothing, left no lacing.  Smell is citrus, wheat and a bit of funky yeasty aroma.  Taste was quite tart, with a bit of bready wheat, finished with a salty, briny tone.  Mouthfeel was pretty light, but fitting for the beer, pleasing on the palate.  Overall, this is a great refreshing beer."
"Overall quite good; a lot more sour and tart than I was expecting, but I was very happy with, especially in the taste. The salt definitely comes through in the taste too and I like it a lot. A very good gose I'd definitely buy again."
""
"This could use more salt and less bitterness. Otherwise, not bad."

"Overall: Pretty good stuff. This probably has more German wheat beer character than other examples of the style that I've had, though not that that's a bad thing. Worth picking up if you can get it."

"Overall: pretty drinkable, but the weird plasticy thing in the flavor still bothers me.  Worth it if you are interested in goses, otherwise probably a skip."

"Overall: Reasonably quaffable and with a subtle lactic edge that's far less aggressive than many of these other goses that are springing up across the country. Still, I'm not sure why they felt the need for the verbena and would welcome its exclusion from future batches."
"Not really my cup of foam. Some intrigue but doesn't taste nice enough to quaff down."

"D: An interesting take on the style. Not the best example for my tastes (salty). I do like the overall construction of the brew."
""
""
"O-This beer has a few low points that detract from what is a very drinkable example of the style. The grainy aroma hurts the score, but the nice, clean feel almost makes up for it. The salt level here is moderate and the citrus flavors add some nice complexity. Overall, this is a good beer, but I just don't love it."

"Big yeast in this sour tasting gose. Some lemon coming through, slight spice as well. Very bready without question. Not a big sour beer, not very puckering. But a good overall sour beer. It doesn't lack taste, just not as big as I wanted the sour to be.."

""

"O: Light and refreshing. Gose well with food."

"Overall, this is a really cracking gose. Salt character is soft, but works really pleasantly with the tartness. It's a balance you don't see in any other style, but I think Almanac has nailed the way it's meant to be."

"22oz bottle purchased for $6.99. Hazy orange color, not much head. Aroma was a mild bit of wheat and then some spice, maybe that was the coriander. Flavor was not really salty, not very tart, extremely easy to drink but I have much preferred real German made gose beers to this. It just didn;t wow me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Very high; it’s almost a perfect summer quencher. I wasn’t familiar at all with this style prior to tasting this one, but I’m going to do my best to remedy that problem as soon as possible."
""
"On tap at Rock Bottom in Denver. Pours hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Aroma of barnyard funk, some yeast, a hint of salt, tart lemons, wheat malts, some definite sweetness here. Flavor follows the smell closely with tart and sweet lemons and honey, wheat malts, some light saltiness (very light), and a funky yeasty finish. The body on this was pretty light and refreshing, with medium carbonation. This really came off more as a saison to me, but had it side by side with their honey saison and this had a slight salt tinge to it. Other than that, they were very similar."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is a hazy sunset yellowish orange with a thin layer of head, consisting of broken bubbles and noticeable effervescence. The aroma offers tangerine, assorted tangy citrus, wheat, light sea salt. A touch of coriander. Nice flavor. Very fruit forward. Zesty with a tart finish. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O - Sweet and welcoming. A touch tart and sweeter, but very tasty."
""

"I wouldn't order it again."

"This pours a straw gold color with cottony foam. There’s a light amount of funk on the aroma with some distinct lemony notes. Like wet hay meets lemongrass, in the best possible ways. The flavor has a crisp grassy straw note with an underlying funk to it. It’s approachable, refreshing, delicious."

"O-One of the few and better goses I've had. The salt worked well with the tartness."
""
""
""
""

"Overall just a great gose, could just pound these back all day and night."
"A nice sour beer that has a touch of funk. Crisp and refreshing, the fruit flavors are very bright and only brought down by the grains from the malt. Not an overpowering sour this one is great for a hot summers day or an average spring one in SoCal."
"Pours a light clear golden with almost no head. Appears a bit like apple juice. The nose starts with dry wheat notes and plenty of coriander and lemon zest. The coriander brings on some floral qualities mixed with citrus fruit. The taste is light and refreshing with the salt coming through and cutting into the fruit and light tartness. The finish is heavy on lemon and almost drinks like a shandy. This is ridiculously drinkable and refreshing. Perfect for a warm summer day."

"O: 4 This is a really nice beer and very refreshing while still being interesting to drink. I could see this as a great beer for someone trying out sours for the first time."

"well made beer here, but different from other goses i have had, especially on the salt factor. its minimal here, and still adds some body, but doesnt hardly add any dryness or minerality to the beer. hazy blonde brew with a gorgeous tall white head foamy and thick. it smells like just a bit of coriander over a wheat beer, german wheat, dusty and dry, with that coriander seed perfume aromatic. the salt doesnt impact the flavor much here, it may be a little under done in that regard, at least compared to other american made examples of the style, but the beer is quite tasty despite that. the coriander isnt as pungent as it is in the nose, and the yeast does a nice job drying this thing out, cracker dry. a nice lush body gives a lot of character to this wheat driven beer. maybe a little more simple than i was expecting from almanac, who always seems to go crazy with odd yeasts and fruits and methods. this one seems a bit more basic to me, and even underwhelms when held up next to other examples of the gose style, but i like it a lot, find it extremely refreshing, and would happily drink it on the regular this summer if it were available here in colorado."

"Overall - I'm not too familiar with goses, but this sure seemed like a friendly welcome wagon into the style. Nice and punchy without becoming too cloyingly sour. Fair balance. Would definitely try again, and a style I'll try to explore sometime in the future."
"d- overall a very drinkable brew. Light, tart, effervescent ... very good on a warm night."

"Pours a murky yellow-brown with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour wheat, lemon, floral flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty, light, and refreshing, but I think the smell is slightly better on this one."

"If you wanted to try a Gose with some user-friendly drinkability, this would be one to try. I also liked the Marionberry Hibiscus Gose from Widmer, though I was one of the few, apparently. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine on Adams Ave."

"Very nice Gose from these guys!"
