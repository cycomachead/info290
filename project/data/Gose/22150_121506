4.45,-1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"this is amazing, such a puckery experience, as if the regular westbrook gose could get any better, well, it did. the addition of brett to the mix t play with the lacto is really what makes this different. its pale yellow and hazy in its look, very heady, with a ton of sediment in there too. the nose and taste are both tangy, more like the gozu on the fruitiness than anything else. the saltiness is there too, clean though for its yeasty look, and really really dry and brightly carbonated. the funk of the brett adds a layer to the sourness of the lacto, and the result is splendid. the fruitiness has a grapefruit character, maybe from some hops? you dont usually see hoppy gose. its also got a peachy creamy thing going on, which really works in the style. this is easily the most evolved example of a gose i have ever had, wild yeasts on both the hot and cold side, which make this all the more interesting from a process standpoint. thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this with me, what a treat! perhaps this is the most refreshing beer ever made...","StonedTrippin","Dec 19, 2014"

4.26,-5.3,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"I always said we needed more porn-ish references in beer names, but I think we can do better than sophomoric soft-core garbage from Florida.  Regardless, this stuff pours a mostly clear straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet/tart lemon, ruby red grapefruit juice, and a hint of almost peat-like phenols in the background (not unlike an Islay Scotch).  The taste continues the sweet/tart lemon tradition, bolder now (nearly bleeding into a well-sculpted version of Country Time...in a good way...), backed up by what is now clearly a briny character (again, much like certain Islay Scotches).  And, boy-howdy, does it work!  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this was a decidedly enjoyable beer, my favorite of the day.  The slightly-increased heft allows the tartness and brine to dance their lovely dance longer on the tongue, allowing more of the spectators (ie. my tastebuds) to recognize the quality of their motions.  Good times, indeed.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart lemon peel, lime, green apple, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, mango, white vinegar, brine, herbal, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, white bread, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and brine/pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart lemon peel, lime, green apple, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, mango, white vinegar, brine, herbal, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, white bread, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon peel, lime, green apple, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, mango, white vinegar, brine, herbal, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, white bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and brine/pale malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with very smooth, crisp, and moderately briny/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.3%. Overall this is an absolutely incredible hoppy gose style! All around fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and brine/pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. An extremely delicious offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

I think it’s a mix of hops, lacto and spice, but it’s hard to separate things out. I like it, but the initial smell was a bit of a shock. Kinda pickley. Strong yogurt sour note with tropical fruit and citrus. Taste is quite lacto sour. Big tropical hop flavor. Some butyric acid, a tad off putting. Lots of pucker.

Way more tart than expected, and I like it. Becomes almost grapefruity after a few sips. Definitely more of a sour than a gose, but it's squeaky clean. The extreme sourness masks subtle nuances.","barczar","Jun 19, 2014"

4.5,0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served from bottle in to a Westbrook snifter (pretty proper). Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour, fruit, salt, citrus, mango, and lemon zest. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon, citrus, salt, tropical fruit, sour, tart, and citrus hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an awesome brew. Alright, I will be the first to admit that I am typically brutal on most beers when I review them and am always honest about how I truly feel about them. Being a HUGE fan of this base beer and having tried Gozu when it was out, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this one the most out of the series. The citra hops added to this one took it to a whole new level. The funk aspect gets a little lost in the saltiness going on but I'm okay with that. This is excellently balanced which make it rather easy to crush. Hoping this shows up on a growler station near me as I need more of this. Make sure you do the same!
