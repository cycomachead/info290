"I am very curious to try this as Gose is not an everyday style. Also, as a U.S. Navy retiree, I am definitely a ""salty dog""! I used a heavy-hand to begin the pour, resulting in a pseudo-cascade, settling into a finger off bone-white (salt-white?) head with fair retention, dropping into a skim across the top of the beer. Color was a button-bright sunshine-yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose smelled like sea spray. I kid you not, I felt like I was back on the forecastle of any of the four ships on which I served. Man, my mouth was watering, both from the memory and at the prospect of what was to come! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was salty, sure and slightly spicy, but in both instances, they seemed muted. This lacked Ooomph! to make it a really standout Gose. Finish was dry, but it could have been so much more."

"Flavor: tastes much like a pilsener combined with a wheat beer. There is a pleasant barley malt flavor with a mild hop bitterness and just a hint of spice (from the coriander I assume, but it is not strong the way coriander sometimes shows up in Belgian style ales)."

"Bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a clear pale yellow. A thin white head rests atop. Nose is of wheat, malt, crackers. Ample carbonation. This beer was crisp and easy to drink. Nice mellow smooth flavor of wheat, lemon zest, white bread. This beer was a nice simple break from the big bold beers I've had of late. My first of the style as well. Not sure how representative this is, but I liked it. Great beer for the summer months."

"12 oz bottle from Trader’s Joe. Pours golden with short-lived white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of funky yeast, wheat malt and hint of spices. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of wheat malt, salt, spices, herbal hops and hint of citrus. Finish is long and salty. I like salt."
""
"Overall: A light, fruity and refreshing version of this style. Little in the way of salt or wheat. Improved with warming, allowing more of the malts to come forward."

"Overall not a bad beer but also not one I would get again."

"Very pale yellow color with light carbonation and mild head. Unique salty aroma. Salty flavor with a creamy, savory element and herbal, citrus and coriander notes. Maintains its head throughout the beer. Surprisingly good. Good taste, complexity and body. Could use less carbonation."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its lightness, and decent spiciness on the back. With this amalgamation of raw and unfiltered ingredients we were worried about getting a big muddled ball of contrasting elements. We were pleasantly surprised to find the opposite, as the finish, while watered, was clean and relatively spicy. This beer was actually much more reminiscent of a lighter, more watery Wit than your traditional Gose. The spice was there through clove and coriander, but any salty wheatiness fell to the wayside with more pale, overly adjuncty malts as a whole. The yeast was also a bit too overrepresented, giving palpable muck to the feel and powder dryness. While we commend Magic Hat for attempting the style, we are left wanting a bit more substance and a lot more flavor."

"I give magic hat a lot of credit for always being bold and trying new things, ambitious styles, and just overall far out stuff, but I criticize them for doing all of them within the safe realm, not quite authentic, and sort of leaning towards mass appeal. usually it works just fine for me, but you cant half ass a gose. a salted wheat beer recipe resurrected from yesteryear cannot be played safe, im sorry. pours clean and mostly clear duller golden with a finger or so of off white suds, fine lace left behind. the nose is straight coriander, fresh green leaves, not seeds or extract, very vegetative, and it detracts from the minerally salt and bready wheat malt I want to be paying attention too. the taste is equally over-herbed, with the salt only coming in the finish. its not dry, not refreshing, sort of like a pretzel... its a great snack, gets the job done, takes the edge off the hunger, but doesn't fill you up or leave you completely satisfied, like a precursor for something that never comes. that's this beer through and through, much left to be desired. I want a salty stop in the feel, and I want an effervescent carbonation that keeps it moving, and both are absent, but I cant be too hard on this. nobody makes a gose, and I love the effort to reintroduce the style to America. I also love its drinkability. maybe I wouldn't call this genre defining, but it is playing a useful role in this summers beer spectrum."

"At first, this beer is absolutely creamy and fluffy, with a nice body. That tapers off, and the crispness is left to carry it through, which it does."

"It's an interesting beer, although it's a bit choked back like most of the other Magic Hat beers. A slight touch of sourness would really bring it into focus and leave it more drinkable."
"The salty aspect reminded me of dirty bathtub water, for you readers out there with kids…I respect the experiment, and like the low ABV and drinkability, but I doubt that I’d have this again if it wasn’t included in a Magic Hat variety 12 pack."

"O- Overall, not bad but not something that I would want to drink again. There just wasn't much flavor, and the faint flavors that were there just didn't do much for me."
"I had three of these in the Magic Hat Spring 2013 sampler. Don't think I'd buy anymore of these separately. Great artwork."

"Saint Saltan pours out a slightly hazy yellow-orange color with a small head. The smell is strongly of the Magic Hat house signature yeast, with a bit of coriander and a pinch of salt. The taste is pretty heavy on the coriander, but otherwise tastes just like Magic Hat's Single Chair Ale with just a hint of salt on the backend. The mouthfeel is on the heavy side of light and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, one of the more average brews Magic Hat has put out in a long time. It's tasty, but absolutely nothing special. And, beyond the slightest hint of salt, there's nothing Gose-y about this at all."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy white head. Smell is yeasty, with coriander, hints of bread and citrus. Taste is grainy, coriander, yeast, with the salt coming in at the end and staying through the aftertaste. Very interesting flavors, but balance out well. A smooth well carbonated light bodied beer. Overall an interesting beer, good flavors, and a nice balance. Worth a try."

"I, too, purchased this from the House of 1000 beers...But I got it for $1. Others have said there isn't much memorable about this beer and I would agree. Maybe that is the reason I like it so much. Just a beer to enjoy ice cold right from the bottle and not feeling the need to remember it. Maybe I like it because it was just a buck...."
""
"What a disappointment. Unrecognizable saltiness, no spices, and where is the lactic acid? This is a poor example of a Gose. I like for brewers to brew out of their comfort zone, but they were obviously brewing outside of their capabilities with this one. Pass."

"Not half bad, just misses the mark a bit more me ... still a decent drink."

"The patron saint of gose? Why not? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear gold topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, coriander, sweet biscuit, and a twinge of sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, though everything has congealed into a characterless mass of vague wheatiness and sweetness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate and a fluid feel. Overall, a bland, meek excuse for a gose, one that comes across more as a weak pale wheat ale than anything resembling a gose. Shame, really..."

"Overall: Very enjoyable, would be great as a summer session beer."
""
"O: A little to clean and simple for me. It's almost like a more flavorful BMC-type lager... I'm sure this would be a nice easy drinker in the summer, but it's still a little too cold out in the spring to get the most enjoyment out of this"

"Overall I can't say it was terrible but if I wanted a German wheat beer I would seek out a Witbier over this offering. Not terrible just kind of forgettable."
"All around pretty nice, simple brew. I can't say I really ""know what to look for"" in a gose, but I would've pegged this as an American witbier or pale wheat if I didn't know better. Kind of an odd offering for winter, but pretty enjoyable."
"Overall - A not so interesting beer yet easily sessionable."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is salty, some grains. Taste is also salty up front, some malts and grains, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a different and pretty good beer."
