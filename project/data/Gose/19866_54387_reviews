"This is not an in your face beer. Uniquely American but European in aim. I think this is my top two all time favorite gose after Westbrook but they're very different from each other. Westbrook is more traditional in aim and cleaner with a more watery texture. The salt in the Westbrook gose is also much more prominent which is not very traditional. This is maybe a top 10 all time favorite beer."

"My favorite beer currently (occasionally) brewed in the great beer metropolis of Portland, OR."

"Overall: Really unique Gose but super enjoyable. Earthy back end really sets it apart. Tartness is present yet not overdone. Upright isn't afraid to be different and this is another great example."
"O - A very fun and well made beer. Light and refreshing with subtle complexities. Given the opportunity, I could easily drink several liters of this."

"Flavors of wheat, coriander, salt, cheese rind, definitely a smooth savory feel from the noticeable salt addition. Slight tang, but not really tart. Smooth supple feel, light but with a moreish savory quality. Very quenching and drinkable, but it could use a little more zip. True to style, and worth a try."

"Dope label - don't have much for traditional german glassware, so hill farmstead stemware will have to do. Hazy urine-orange body, foamy white head with basically no lace. Bread, lemon, honey, corriander, salty mineral-y finish. Not a style I'm in love with, but a nice representation."
""
""
""
"Drinkability is good, a quenching goose, but not very flavorful. Worth trying, not necessarily seeking out."
"Ultimately, this gose is under-salted, under-spiced and lacks in funk and acidity, but manages to stand up on its own feet simply because it is supremely well-crafted. Highly recommended."
"This is a light bodied brew with a tingly effervescent level of carbonation. It is like a savory witbier with a dirty little mineral addition. It was ok but not what I was hoping for or expecting from this brewery that I hold to high regard. This was not something I would buy again."
""

"Bottle: Poured a cloudy light beige color ale with a super huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light salty notes with coriander and solid Belgian style malt base. Taste is also dominated by a huge Belgian-style malt backbone with some medium coriander notes and some subtle notes of salt. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed and super enjoyable. Looking forward to trying more beers from this brewer."

"(O)- Light, crisp, clean, and damn refreshing and very easy to enjoy. A perfect beer for summertime. This was my first venture in the Gose style and I look forward to trying more of them if they are like this!"

"Big thanks goes out to MSquared2 for sharing this one at our Labor Day tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured golden with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, fruit, salt, wheat, and subtle tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, salt, earth, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. Gose, you say? Let's do this! I had heard good things about this brew so I was quite happy to see it make an appearance at our tasting. I had heard correct as this was a really well done brew in all aspects. Wish there was a little more carbonation though. The flavor and aroma were almost perfect in my opinion. All the right notes for the style and none of the drawbacks. The saltiness was there in both but it didn't pound your face into submission and leave your palate screaming for mercy which was very nice. The sour/tart note definitely helped to pull this one off. A really well done brew by Upright that I would love to have more of in the future. Thanks so much for sharing this one Morgan as it is currently my favorite from this style!"
""
"Overall: I would have this one again. Light and crisp. Enough salt to taste it, but it didn't dominate all the other flavors."
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spice. Taste is much the same with the spices lingering on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but not something I would really go for again."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a white head. Tart lemon on the nose with lemon zest and a subtle saltiness. Some straw, bread, and lots of yeast on the nose, too. Really pleasant aroma. The flavor is just as enjoyable. A bit more tart than other examples of the style that I’ve tried. Mild coriander and salt notes with lots of lemon zest, yeast, and cracker malts. Very enjoyable and easy to drink."

"O - Really cool beer from Upright that I enjoyed. Lots of different things going on between the nose and palate that kept me thinking more and more about what I was getting out of it. Would like to have this again for sure to see if anything has changed down the road."
""
"O: Funky but not the most drinkable. Its my first of the style, though, so maybe the style just isn't for me."
"O: My first tango with a gose went pretty well, but I can see this style being hit or miss. I really like the briny salt character of the style and hopefully I can try some similar ones in the future."
"A tasty little brew from Upright."
""
"Pours pale yellow and cloudy with a big white head. The head is pretty fizzy and fades to nothing quickly. The aroma is subdued, particularly in terms of the characteristic gose elements. It's mostly wheat spice and malt sweetness. There's some mild coriander spicing and a touch of lactic acid in the mix. Maybe, a little lemon but less than I expect and want in the style. The taste is similar. It tastes like their witbier with a little bit of gose blended in. There's a little bit of salt and lactic sourness, but this is a very mild version of the style. It's moderately dry, though I'd call it relatively sweet for the style. It's quite clean. Too clean, really. Mouthfeel is light and clean. Little to no pucker. Overall, it's a decent enough beer, though a touch boring. I just can't help feeling disappointed, since I like the spice, salt and sour of the style."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. The only other gose I've had was the one from Portsmouth. Upright's seems more like a saison than a gose, but I still really enjoyed it. The beer was salty, but not as intense as I would have expected it to be."

"Pours a hazy hay-yellow with a big fluffy white head. Smells very similar to a hefeweizen with that clove & banana aroma, looking forward to tasting this one. Flavor is very nice and refreshing, a bit like a lighter hefeweizen, there are hints of salt in there as well. Mouthfeel is very light and bubbly. Overall this is a very tasty beer, but I guess I was hoping for something a little more exciting given my love for Upright and my interest in this style. Still, it's a very good Gose and another hit from Upright."
"I'm very glad to have tried this beer. I can see from this that a gose is a cross between a saison, a hefeweizen, and a berliner weisse. This was tasty. I'd love to try another version, especially a German-made one. 4.0"
""
"Overall Impression- For my first Gose beer, this one was VERY interesting and enjoyed thoroughly. Would like to grab more from Upright if I get the chance. Highly recommend!"
"- A nice tart and refreshing Gose. The carbonation is surprisingly light. I love how tart it is.. many don't reach this level. Quite good."
""
"Mouthfeel. Medium-light body with full, fine and lively carbonation."

"D. Much different than the Portsmouth, but very good so well."
"Pours a orwngish yellow. Just like the rest of the goses. Less head than the others. Thicker, seemingly less carbonated. Smells lightly fruity. Spicey. Fruity, sweet, lote of spice. Some saltiness on the back each sip. Thicker and stronger then all of the others with maybe the exception of the ccb Gose. Overall, considerably more interesting than the others."
"O - interesting in taste but kinda weird compared to others"
"Poured a hazy orange-ish yellow, foamy and almost yellow head falls to a thin collar. Nose is of wheat, some light sourness and barnyard-type funk. Some citrus and zest notes, as well as some saltiness. Taste is composed of salt water and sour notes, more funkiness and citrus zest. Salty and tart mouthfeel, both of which stick around for qutie some time. Drying finish. Interesting, and increasingly funky barnyard notes as it warms, some real unique character here. Quite a nice gose, rated with style in mind. I've only had limited experience in this style, but this seemed to do the trick."
"Bottle from private beer store in Vancouver. Pours hazy orange, and is lacey. Some funk and sour in aroma. Initially the sourness hits, then the yeast, and the very saltines. Ultimately sour salt water. Sweet corriander. Drinkable for a glass but a pint is impossible to put down."
"O - I really enjoyed this brew! Especially since we drank it on a 90 degree summer day. Really light and easy to drink. Would activily seek this one out again. Thanks Michael!"
"Definitely an interesting beer, it wasn’t quite what I had expected from a Gose, but it is thoroughly enjoyable. It honestly tastes more like a variation of an Upright Saison than anything (which certainly makes sense given its pedigree). This should definitely be drunk on the cool side (as opposed to the cold side), as it opens up quite a bit more in the 50s and 60s on the Fahrenheit scale). A thoroughly enjoyable take and a fairly rare style of beer."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow orange color with a small head that fades away almost completely. Smell is very light, some lemon or orange. To me smells much like a standard wheat beer. The taste is so surprising and delicious. Some sweetness upfront followed by a delightful tart, light sour finish. Just the slightest hint of the salt which brings out all the flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a dry tart finish. This is the first gose I have ever had and I now wish that they were more readily available. A great beer!"
"Overall, I'm quite impressed. I hope Im able to get my hands on another bottle or ten. Also, I just burped and it tasted good."
"This pours a cloudy whee yellow/orange color, a small head that fades quickly. The smell is of lemon and wheat, small amounts of herbal scents and malts. Taste is a light zesty lemon sour crossed with a wheat beer. Nice sour right up front that is noticeable all the way through but the finish there is also a light grain that balances out the beer nicely. Nothing salty or no salt aspect on this one. I would have to say that this is medium bodied, it is bubbly with the first sip but defiantly has a little weight in the body. I think this is great, especially for a summer day"
"My first gose, and something I was definitely a fan of. A really nice warm-weather beer."
"D - Very light and refreshing. Even thought some of the flavors noted can be fatiguing they are quite the opposite in this beer, and you could certainly have a lot of it. Would drink again if it were made in large quantities. Nice to see more breweries trying their hand at this style, albeit with mixed results *cough*...Bruery...*cough*."
"O: A great light summer sipper. I like the mild acidity and refreshing complexity of this brew. The label art is tasteful as well, if that counts for anything."
"O: The Upright boys just keep making better beer all the time. This is proof. 4.5/5"
"Overall, I believe this is only the second beer of the style I’ve had, but once again I’m impressed. An interesting beer that doesn’t differ much from a saison, well worth a shot."
"Hey, I get to try another gose! No way! It pours a cloudy golden straw topped by a half-finger of lightly dirty white foam. The nose comprises coriander, orange peel, wheat, and lovely flowers (trust me, they smell like they would look pretty pretty). The taste holds notes of light coriander, salt, wheat, very light sour malt, grass, and those good-lookin' flowers again. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, a very enjoyable li'l drink, something I wish more breweries would dabble in (especially if it turns out as well as it did here)."
"The appearance of this beer, not knowing much about the style, is a tad unappetizing. It pours like a cloudy champagne color and fizzes just like it too. The aroma is like tart lemons with the coriander in place with a slight sour nose, and a decent aroma of pilsner malt. The flavor is actually pretty darn good. There is a touch of funk, the slightest of saltiness, decent wheat flavor and a good deal of fizzy lemons. I didn't think I was going to like this style, but I must admit I've taken quite a shine to it. I found the sourness to be quite mild and overall the extreme fizz seemed to really help the fruity notes of the beer come through. Overall, if you're going to make an attempt at the style, there seems like no better beer to do that with then the Upright Gose."
"D: very good. Nice and refreshing."
"D: Tasty and unique. I enjoyed this a lot and would happily drink it again."
"Pours a hazy light yellow color with a nice two-finger white head with a moderate amount of retention. The nose brings some nice citrus and lemon notes with a slight sourness to it. The flavor is lemon with some mild acidity and a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel is where this really shines. Good body and the salt is actually a pleasant addition rather than something I'd simply tolerate because it's part of the style. This was a high-quality brew. Thanks, Matt."
"I liked this beer considerably more than the 3 other people that shared it with me but I don't care. It is bright on the palate and creamy with a thin body but a wet finish. It is mildly salty but that accents the citric acid of this so well, even if the lactic is what wins out. The two acids are nicely complementary and the overall feel of the beer is very nice. I would definitely have it again...much better than Leipziger Gose."
"D - This is a great style; it is very refreshing and way drinkable. It is just too bad that it is such a rarely seen style."
"Too all appearances this beer is a wheat beer but after a sip or two the salt shows up in the mouthfeel. It is an interesting beer which works well with plain food. I liked it but did find the salt was noticeable on the gums after awhile. Nice however to see this old style available in BC"
"The beer pours a very light hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is some tart wheat with some lemons, bananas and salt. The flavor is similar. I get notes of lemons, wheat and some salt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a very light, refreshing beer that goes down very easily."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, very refreshing. Definitely a nice Gose, great for the summer. Thanks Eric!"
"D: Really good ~ see the last sentence of 'mouthfeel' as to why this is so easy to drink. Perhaps a one-time release...or perhaps a repeat performance by the fine fellows at Upright. Not the best I've had but certainly fine enough to seek out and a perfect 'spring' beer (despite a January release)."
"Thanks to Eric for sharing this one - a wonderfully refreshing summer beer, and a nicely made gose."
"D: An interesting take on the gose. I've only had the leipziger, and this is certainly an american take on it, but it is comparable in overall quality. My wife found this a tad more flavorful and enjoyable than I did. Certainly worth seeking out if for no other reason than to experience a gose beer. + a cool label to boot."
"I quite enjoyed this beer and was left wondering why more brewers don't attempt the style. Refreshing and light, interesting and flavorful. I could easily see myself drinking this regularly in the summer. Love that light pinch as the tartness hits the mouth!"
"I am guessing this is not quite like a typical Gose as it seems more Belgian than German. Salt comes through very nicely and makes the body creamy and full. Lacto plays tricks with the salt and comes across as less sour than it might normally. Coriander is there as is some wheat tang - it is kinda like a wit-saison-berlinerweissbier. Nice, but not as tart as I thought it would be. I believe this probably used a saison yeast as opposed to a more traditional German varietal. Still, I am loving this beer and would buy this again in a heartbeat, for sure. A wonderful drinking experience. Thanks again, Frank!"
"4/3.5/3.5/4/3"
"Nice, but I'm not sure what to measure it against. I guess anything gose."
"drinkability - refreshing but the carbonation is excessive"
"The body and drinkability were both good, I could easily see myself drinking a couple of these on a summers afternoon. Overall, a good beer, worth a shot if you see it."
"I enjoy this style, I think Upright did it right. I look forward to enjoying this beer through the spring and summer months."
"The beer is light bodied with a lower moderate level of carbonation. I think an increased level of carbonation would make this more enjoyable, but in its current form it's damn drinkable and refreshing. The 750ml was depleted with no great effort. I look forward to trying more Upright offerings in the future."
"D- A perfect example of a summertime thirst quencher. Right up there with berliner weisse, witbier, etc. They should make this by the gallon; I just wish it wasn't 20 degrees out right now."
"At 5.2% quite drinkable especially given it's lack of any bittering and nice maltiness. Would gladly pick this up again when it's out in bottle."
