The flavor is very malty, with some dried dark fruit. The coriander is more evident in the finish as I taste some lemon lime soda water as well. Perhaps a little salty, this seems to miss the Gose mark but I find it good to drink.","KYGunner","Aug 16, 2014"

3.67,6.4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The pour at first glance can be mistaken for a Pilsner, except for being a shade darker, and with more bubbles. As ordinary as the pour looked, the way the beer smelled was anything but. Even from an arm's length, there was a sour, floral, and mineralized smell coming from the glass, which intensified when brought nearer. This was clearly not an ordinary Pilsner. The taste stayed true to the style, but was lighter than others of the type I've had, which sadly has been only a couple. This was a bit more tame in acidity and salt, and little sweeter. Not a bad taste at all, mind you, just not all that it should be. Light and crisp on the palette, but again softer, and lacking that Gose edge. I don't mind having had this bottle, and it is certainly different than Sam Adams typical fare, but I much prefer the real German bottle, or that fantastic recreation by Westbrook more.","rajendra82","Jan 26, 2014"

4,15.9,4,4,4,4,4,"gose. such an underbrewed and underappreciated style. a rare one here in the usa, and indeed the world over these days. but this is a gem. crystal clear golden amber on the pour, sparkling with bright carbonation and a few fingers of fine white foam. the nose is odd, corriander for sure, toasted lightly, with some wheat malt and a curious but mild yeast strain. the salt of course doesnt have much smell, but it comes in at the end. i taste sweet wheat malt and corriander seeds, and the salt is more of a finishing element, leaving a unique mouthfeel that is somehow both dry and not dry at the same time. i found this to be much less salted and mineral driven than some of the other versions ive had, particularly genuine european versions, but i liked this a lot, and the addition of corriander i thought brought out a lot of flavor complexity. a beer id gladly pay 7 bucks for again.","StonedTrippin","Jan 07, 2013"

2.73,-20.9,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Gotta give it up for Sam for continuing to roll out some new takes on offbeat styles. This attempt at a gose pours a lightly hazy sunset golden-straw topped by over a finger of white froth. The nose comprises white bread, soap, lemon rind (the waxy outermost part of the rind), light coriander, and a kiss of baby's breath. The taste unfortunately brings in more of the same, with the soap really coming forth as the frontrunner. I get hardly any citrus character, and whatever spice notes are there are meek at best, busy being consumed by the soapy bread enveloping them. Needless to say, the whole experience is unpleasant, leaving a bad taste in my mouth (literally, for once). The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty insipid gose, one that doesn't come close to exhibiting any of the characteristics of the style. All of the top four Google Translate definitions of Verloren apply here: Something was definitely "lost" in translation, the effort comes across as "wasted" and retrospectively potentially "doomed" to failure, and I am "forlorn" after having partaken of it.","TMoney2591","Oct 22, 2012"

The head retains a thin layer and leaves a decent bit of lacing. The nose features candied oranges, coriander, wheat, apricots, and a wave of citric tartness. The taste delivers most of what the nose promises with wave of orange and fruit. This dries out rather quick and becomes slightly tart with a salty finish. There are some hops that come to play as well toawards the finish as well as an unpleasant bitterness. The mouthfeel is somewhat full bodied with moderate carbonation.

It’s not a style I frequent, but I’m yet to experience one that’s exciting. It does have a simple, straight-forward, good flavor though. This one features the salty, spicy bells and whistles and is a nice representation of the style. If you’re looking to try one, this is a pretty good place to start.","prototypic","Jun 30, 2012"

The quantity of bubbles rising from the bottom decreases after the initial pour. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Bright orange fills the nose along with coriander, malt, and hops. It has that classic, inviting wheat ale smell. Coriander, orange peel, malt, and hops blend well to create a tasty brew. If I hadn't seen salt listed as an ingredient, I might not have been looking for it. As it stands, there is a mild saltiness. The flavors are well balanced. The aftertaste is not strong.

All in all I found this quite enjoyable though it's certainly not a powerhouse.

The taste is a little sweeter than expected, with more bitterness as well. Lingering peppery, bitter flavors are central to the taste.

Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is nice, it smells like minerals/salt, lemon peel, coriander and some bready/grainy malt. I think the citrus and coriander flavors are stronger at first, and then after a little while the mineral/salty flavor starts to kick in. There's also some coriander, bananas and just an overall fruity flavor noticeable, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with a good amount of carbonation. It's also smooth and goes down easy. I haven't had any gose style beers before so I have no idea if this one is a traditional (or a good) one or not.

On the nose I get a vague malt character and a hint of citrus and spice. The body is about medium but the texture creamy and comfortable on the palate. Now about that taste; it starts out as a pleasant pale ale with a moderate grainy malt character but after a few sips the salt is easily found along with some pineapple or lemon citrus.
