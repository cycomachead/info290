"Overall:  Complex, creative and impressive"

"Sour, pineapple juice, lemon zest, yogurt."
""

"Bottle, Pours hazy yellow with white head.  Light fruity and salty aroma.  Taste is tropical fruits, brett funk, and a tart and light salty finish, excellent"

"Oh my, seek this brew out! Nothing short of amazing. Best beer collaboration ever?! I wish I had a case of this instead of just one"

"this is amazing, such a puckery experience, as if the regular westbrook gose could get any better, well, it did. the addition of brett to the mix t play with the lacto is really what makes this different. its pale yellow and hazy in its look, very heady, with a ton of sediment in there too. the nose and taste are both tangy, more like the gozu on the fruitiness than anything else. the saltiness is there too, clean though for its yeasty look, and really really dry and brightly carbonated. the funk of the brett adds a layer to the sourness of the lacto, and the result is splendid. the fruitiness has a grapefruit character, maybe from some hops? you dont usually see hoppy gose. its also got a peachy creamy thing going on, which really works in the style. this is easily the most evolved example of a gose i have ever had, wild yeasts on both the hot and cold side, which make this all the more interesting from a process standpoint. thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this with me, what a treat! perhaps this is the most refreshing beer ever made..."

"I always said we needed more porn-ish references in beer names, but I think we can do better than sophomoric soft-core garbage from Florida.  Regardless, this stuff pours a mostly clear straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet/tart lemon, ruby red grapefruit juice, and a hint of almost peat-like phenols in the background (not unlike an Islay Scotch).  The taste continues the sweet/tart lemon tradition, bolder now (nearly bleeding into a well-sculpted version of Country Time...in a good way...), backed up by what is now clearly a briny character (again, much like certain Islay Scotches).  And, boy-howdy, does it work!  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this was a decidedly enjoyable beer, my favorite of the day.  The slightly-increased heft allows the tartness and brine to dance their lovely dance longer on the tongue, allowing more of the spectators (ie. my tastebuds) to recognize the quality of their motions.  Good times, indeed."

"This flavor is sublime as a nicely tempered sourness glides across the palate. The taste has a pulpy natural grapefruit, tangy nectarine, fruity apricot and a bit of earthy mineral. This does have little to no saltiness, which will make some very happy, but instead highlights a very real tangy, tart and sweet."

"An extremely balanced brew. Less tart and salt than Westbrook's classic, but a beautiful balanced mouthfeel and hoppy notes. Towards the quality of Funky Buddha's Veruca Berliner."

"Tried this on tap. Hazy light yellow orange body. Aroma is sour and bready. The beer is pretty sour tasting, but is balanced well by a sharp bready taste. Sort of like sour dough."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-One of the best beers I've ever had, the extra citrus and hops really adds extra layers to the Gose."
""
""
"This beer just did NOT work for me. Too much going on. Some styles just simply do not need a huge dose of high alpha acids, and this is one of them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finishes dry and spicy with touches of sour fruits like lemon/orange (citric) closing out beer."
""
""

"Superb sour flavors with bold hops that don't overshadow the star feature (sourness). Quite a tasty and easy drinking brew."

"Pours a cloudy gold color.  1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, alcohol, and sour fruit. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation.  There is a noticeable tartness, astringency, but not soreness.  Tastes of strong dry citrus, slight pale malt, hint of sugar, slight sweet malt, and amazing sourness.  Overall, good appearance, good aroma, great blend, good mouth feel, and a stand out beer."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart lemon peel, lime, green apple, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, mango, white vinegar, brine, herbal, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, white bread, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and brine/pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart lemon peel, lime, green apple, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, mango, white vinegar, brine, herbal, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, white bread, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon peel, lime, green apple, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, mango, white vinegar, brine, herbal, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, white bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and brine/pale malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with very smooth, crisp, and moderately briny/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.3%. Overall this is an absolutely incredible hoppy gose style! All around fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, citrus/tropical hops, and brine/pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. An extremely delicious offering."

"O: 4.25 This is an excellent beer and definitely the most interesting gose I’ve had to date. The hops were not quite as strong as I was expecting, so I wish I had another to cellar for a bit and see where it goes."

"Overall - I wish every beer could be as flavorful as this at such a low ABV."

"O-One of the coolest, most unique beers I have come across. Probably won't see this one again so I am very, very happy I got to immerse myself into a full pint of this tasty collaboration."

"O: Great beer. Love the huge tartness, and some great balancing flavors as well. I think I slightly prefer the regular Westbrook Gose, but both are excellent."
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice sour that seems a bit more complex than most Gose. Would love to see how this one ages."

"Pours a pale almost banana yellow. Very cloudy. Medium white head. All fine foam. Little lacing but it could be the glass. Aroma is odd. I think it’s a mix of hops, lacto and spice, but it’s hard to separate things out. I like it, but the initial smell was a bit of a shock. Kinda pickley. Strong yogurt sour note with tropical fruit and citrus. Taste is quite lacto sour. Big tropical hop flavor. Some butyric acid, a tad off putting. Lots of pucker. A bit of yogurty body and otherwise light. Very interesting but I can’t say that I love it."

"Overall, I love this beer. While it's a far cry from a traditional gose (if Ritterguts and/or Leipziger are to be taken as examples), it's so deliciously different. The taste is really what makes this beer, and I would encourage anyone who loves sour-tasting beers in general, or pickled foods, to check it out. Stillwater and Westbrook have created something truly unique and amazing."
""
"Plenty of funk in this beer and it is absolutely delicious. Dry finish and a lingering tart bite on the back of the tongue. Lovely"

"Overall- What an interesting beer! very sour and drinkable with a nice blend of sour citrus, herbaceous hops, and brett funk."

"Pour is hazed pale yellow with a good bit of white head and some larger bubbles. Nose is quite hoppy, lots of citrus and citra hops with a light tinge of salt and a dose of acidity. Taste is similar, tons of citra hop, a bit of acidity and moderate grain presence. Lots of citrusy flavors and just a hint of saltiness. Lighter carb with a juicy finish."

"Though many of the classic gose are long gone, comparisons to American attempts are few and far between. But with recent brewing advancements in place, Gose Gone Wild doesn't only compare favorably, it likely surpasses many of them in quality and crispness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is even better than WB Gose. It is more sour and less salty."
""
"This one is amazing, Stillwater's remixes, the one's I've tried, are all really cool beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: pretty fantastic - similar to the regular Westbrook Gose"
"O- This is amazing, just doesn't taste like other other Goses or fit to style. I have not tried Westbrook Gose and based on how good this is I need to try it! I can't wait to get more of this."
""
""
""
""

"Hazy straw, small white head. Aroma is lightly sour and musty. Hay. Flavor is extremely acetic, limey tart, lemony sour, with a slightly floral, lightly bready backbone. Way more tart than expected, and I like it. Becomes almost grapefruity after a few sips. Definitely more of a sour than a gose, but it's squeaky clean. The extreme sourness masks subtle nuances."

"O: a delicious and refreshing beer overall. Not terribly complex, but thoroughly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is by far the nicest gose style beer I have tried."
""
""
"O: Really tasty beer. The combination of different acids from the hops and brett/lacto gives it an almost acetic quality, although not overbearing."
""
""
""
"O: Unique and fascinating. I really enjoy it, but it's probably not for everyone. Would have again."

"overall super impressive and tasty. one of the best."

"O: This is one of the most unusual goses you're likely to come across, but don't let that stop you. It's a complex, easy to like, drinkable beer."

"Served from bottle in to a Westbrook snifter (pretty proper). Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour, fruit, salt, citrus, mango, and lemon zest. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon, citrus, salt, tropical fruit, sour, tart, and citrus hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an awesome brew. Alright, I will be the first to admit that I am typically brutal on most beers when I review them and am always honest about how I truly feel about them. Being a HUGE fan of this base beer and having tried Gozu when it was out, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this one the most out of the series. The citra hops added to this one took it to a whole new level. The funk aspect gets a little lost in the saltiness going on but I'm okay with that. This is excellently balanced which make it rather easy to crush. Hoping this shows up on a growler station near me as I need more of this. Make sure you do the same! Tick."
