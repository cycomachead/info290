"This was super weird. Tasted like I was drinking a gose and somebody farted in my mouth. Not fun."
"O: Overall this is an interesting beer - the combination of cilantro, lime, and roasted red pepper integrate in an interesting fashion with the slightly sour and salty gose. Seems more like a combination of flavors found in food than in a beer but glad I grabbed this one."

"Overall: Interesting but wouldn't buy again. The red pepper schtick is too overwhelming, but again I do find it relatively drinkable. I like Against The Grain in general but this one didn't deliver as expected because I was super pumped for some serious cilantro taste, which I didn't get."
"I like the ambition but I don't think the roasted red peppers work at all in this beer with the lactic and citrus sourness going on. The flavor of the calamansi is very nice and would actually make a killer Gose on its own."

"O: I'll dock it points for the pepper being the only of the many ingredients that I can actually taste, but give it some credit for the red pepper flavor actually working with the acidity."

"Overall a very unique and salty Gose, would be perfect for a michelada or a bloody. For fans of Shorts Bloody Beer, etc."

"Overall: Sadly, I did not like this beer at all! It smells of vomit and with a huge aftertaste of pizza. Would not drink again under any circumstance."

"Its obvious that the ""gose"" style wants to die. But its guys and gals like these that are dragging the style into the twenty-second century kicking and screamin!"
