3.85,-2.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"very good beer, a fine and complex interpretation of the style, and one that i think is really really good. that said, its appalling that it costs some 25 bucks a bottle. there is no validity to that at all, and where i see the need to charge high prices for peach pit sours and three year old blends and all of that, this makes no sense and its frustrating to me. i can go get a case of westbrook cans for this price, and from now on thats probably what i will do. im not at all disappointed in the beer, im stoked on it actually, but i will never buy it again. salty and tangy and with some oak character to it, which i think really does add something to the style. i dont know if its spent time on oak or not, but there is a woody element to this. the salt is medium and the coriander isnt overdone like it so often is. the lactic acid is really high, but there is a yeasty must too, more mature than others. i like it a lot, but it could stand a little more carbonation and about 50% off of its price tag. i hope they arent trying to create buzz for this beer and an aura of elitism to this with its price, that wouldnt be cool, but the beer itself is very cool.","StonedTrippin","Dec 06, 2014"

3.93,-0.3,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"The beer pours a cloudy light golden yellow-orange with a fluffy white head that laces and no sediment. The beer settles quickly into a syrupy-looking, under-carbonated beer without head retention or lacing. The nose is funky upfront followed by some spice and citrus that opens up into saline (tomato-like?) and malty finish. The taste presents salinated funk upfront, unsweetened malt and a bit of yeast fruitiness in the finish. It's a light bodied beer with a semi-sweet, saline mouthfeel, less than expected carb, a touch of fruit, and tart graininess in the finish. This is a pretty drinkable (imperial) gose that accents the desired flavors without being overpowering, though I'd prefer a lower abv.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 08, 2014"
