My one knock is that I actually feel like this beer could use a bit more flavor coming in from somewhere. Yeah, there's an intense tart/sweet/salty kind of combination going on, but other than the biscuity finish and pretty slight orange flavor, there's not much else there.

Aroma has a low malt profile but I detect pilsner malts & wheat, oddly in that order. It is crisp & dry with hints of green apple, lemon, lime, brine & it may be my imagination but a little grassy hop hint. Taste opens with salinity & lactic acid sourness & largely persist overpowering hints of pilsner malt, tart green apples (sprinkled with salt), lemon & lime in a peppery, clean, crisp, dry finish. Aftertaste is salty lemon, lime & tart green apple. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation that rapidly dissipates as the brew warms, astringent, prickly & dry. This style is often brewed with coriander however I pick up no coriander hints at all.","mothmanscott","Feb 26, 2015"

The experience is not too different from a juicy IPA, but instead of big hops the Gose comes with sourness and saltiness.  Skeptical, I found this not only works, but is a winning combination.

4,3.9,,,,,,"Overall: Someone else wrote a review stating that they're not over the moon with the style. Agree on that. I was really excited, though, to try it! It seriously has been something I've been hoping brewers would attempt again. They also make a Blood Orange flavored Gose, which has an additional almost acrid acidity but some orange brightness. If you want something different, this definitely falls into the category. And despite the flavors, it kind of grows on you and in virtue of its light body and bracing saltwater-y nature is actually super easy to drink.","MudDrinker","Nov 24, 2014"

I could recommend this to those who are not too familiar or just getting into the Gose style. This really does remind me of the Malt Liquor style brew, just with more tartness. At the end of the day I could sit back and slam a few of these watching a Baseball game. This brew is worthy!","Shroud0fdoom","Nov 23, 2014"

Taste is very tart upfront with some citrus. Then the malt comes in, just enough to remind you this is a beer and not a cider or champagne. Nice salty finish with a tartness that lingers. Mouthfeel is super light and crisp. This is a perfect summer beer, although I could drink it at any time. Overall, this is pretty good.

3.33,-13.5,,,,,,"Can as a trade extra. Thanks! Pours hazy golden with a big fluffy white head. Tart wheaty aroma, lots of hay, some funk, and a bit dry and salty as expected. Flavor is sweet honey and wheat from the malts up front, just a tinge of tart, some tangy salty notes in the middle of the tongue, and finishes with some pineapple and a dirty wheaty finish. Light bodied with medium plus plus carbonation. Overall much sweeter than others in the style I've had. Still, not a huge fan of this style. A bit bland and what flavor that is there is just weird. Oh well. Another tick.","BMMillsy","Oct 13, 2014"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, very dry on the finish, a little crisp, not filling at all and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, just when I think the tartness and salty flavors would start to wear on me I end up coming back for more, so I think I could drink a few of these, especially on a really hot day.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance and the mouthfeel, when it came to the taste it had really nice balance and none of the aspects were too overpowering.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was just a little bland with a little too much grainy malts.  I would buy this beer again and I might actually get a six pack.  I would recommend this beer to anyone who doesn't mind a little tartness and if your a fan of the style then it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just what I expect from the style and I enjoyed drinking it, it doesn't feel like it should be so easy to drink, but it is.  It isn't my favorite Gose, but it is one of the better beers that I've had from this brewery.  Good job guys, thinks for doing this style justice, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Oct 11, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with solid retention, that reduces to ring of lacing that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, pear, wheat, bread, coriander, sea salt, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt, sea salt/spice, and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, pear, wheat, bread, coriander, sea salt, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity tartness and salinity on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, lime, green apple, white grape, pear, wheat, bread, coriander, sea salt, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of pale malt, sea salt/spice, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic/saline mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is an excellent Gose style! All around great complexity and robustness of pale malt, sea salt/spice, and fruit yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 01, 2014"

This is a cool conundrum of a beer. This looks and smells like an average lager. Based on how I follow ratings, I (as many others) put as much emphasis on appearance, aroma, mouthfeel, etc as taste. This beer (and maybe entire style) deserves a bit more investigation. Golden, straw colored brew with a little bit of head. Looks like lawnmowerville. Bit of sour hit to the nose, light aroma, and just a hint of bready/yeasty goodness. BOOM! Nice tart punch up front, a bit salty, and such inspiring sour notes. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Ironically, this would probably make for a nice lawnmower beer... or a sipper... or anything for that matter. Damn, I need to brew a Gose. When compared to Westbrook, AV has all of the same funky, salty deliciousness, though I found it to be a bit 'lighter' all around. Love it, recommend it.","Mikus","Sep 17, 2014"

Sometimes, if a CAN is dented, it will push the beer to the top, but in this case, the beer was up to the lip! It must have been overfilled when the lid was seamed on to get it this full. A new standard has been set. I began an inverted Glug, but “effervescent” was the operative word here. Following a brief pseudo-cascade, I got three-plus fingers of puffy, fizzy, bone-white head that was as carbonated as soda pop and lasted for just a short time before fading away. Color was a Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 – 2) and I just urinated a darker liquid. Nose was tart, yet salty. I felt like I was back at sea, smelling the breeze on the fantail.  Mouthfeel was thin, but very fizzy. The taste was initially puckeringly tart, like sucking on a lemon, but then the saltiness kicked in, mellowing the intensity of the tartness. Finish was bone dry, puckeringly dry and I could hear the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara Desert as I reached for my asthma inhaler. Well, if you are looking for something very different or if you really want a thirst quencher during the Summer months, this would be it. It was as refreshing as ginger ale, but without the sugar. Pardon me while I try to prise my lips apart.","woodychandler","Sep 11, 2014"

This is incredibly easy to drink and immensely sessionable.","KYGunner","Sep 05, 2014"

The brew smells like tart lemon/lime, green apples, bready/wheat malt and some salt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some mineralness. It's tart and refreshing. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's very easy to drink. It's a good, sessionable brew.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"This is my very first gose, and based on this one little can, it it one intriguing style of beer. Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head with good retention. Big aromas of sour fruit (sour apple and unripened cherries) and salty marshlands are dominant, with a bit of the wheatiness detectable as well. Taste is primarily a swirl of saltiness and tart fruity notes like apricot and pear. Extremely dry finish. The saltiness greatly enhanced my enjoyment of a sweet nectarine. Overall, I dig this beer and feel inspired to seek out new goses.","droomyster","Aug 05, 2014"

Nose is a touch sweet with some pale malt and hop floral. Light sweet flower petals. The taste is light crisp, a bit tart and very refreshing. This is a gentler gose than the westbrook with not so much sour that it puckers you. Just enough tartness to whet the whistle and then the saline aspects keep it whetted. A touch malty as it warmed. Light sweet hoppiness in this one and I really liked it.","utopiajane","Aug 04, 2014"

What's cool is how well the salt complements this beer. Initially I was intrigued yet unsure by the thought of a salty flavor in beer but after drinking this, I can see how it works well.","Benish","Aug 03, 2014"

Nose of tart white grape, sour notes, hints of sea salt, toasted grains, floral highlights, and subtle citrus notes. Flavors are smooth and sweet, with a lemon zest and white wine forward blend, crisp and dry, followed by a slightly sour and tart feel. Saltiness clears up into the aftertaste, keeping it mellow.

The balance of tartness is the most important, and keep in mind I'm not basing this on anything historical, or on any known beer - because there is/was no existing beer, and there was no measurement at all for pH until at least 1909, and then it was just getting started. The second part is the saltiness. The third is the spice. Beyond that you have malt and hop, but it's these three things that need to fall into line to make the beer work, and I think Anderson Valley has pulled that off. It's salty, then tart, then woody/earthy/spicy. Then you repeat. It doesn't have a lot of depth to it, but it is complex. And refreshing. And at only about 4.2% ABV you can drink a lot of it.","NeroFiddled","Jul 02, 2014"

4.25,10.4,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,"I want to preface this review by saying I have never found myself being a huge fan of the gose. Granted, I haven't tried the Westbrook version which I hear is great, but I've had my fair share. It was a style I just didn't "get". Well this beer changed my perspective on that. This is reviewed from a can. Pours a clear gold with minimal head and no retention. The nose is somewhere between an American wheat and a berliner weisse. There is noteable wheat grain character that comes through along with a bright popping citrus character. A bit of tangy lactobacillus sits in the background and just entices me to take a sip. Up front on the palate you get a wave of salt. This was the part that didn't make sense to me in the style. Well, now it does. The salt in this brew is very noticeable and almost takes on the taste of salt water for a split second. This quickly gives way to a dash of tartness and then a big zesty lemony character at the finish. The salt/citrus/tartness makes for an incredibly harmonious and refreshing combination that is incredibly quenching, especially during some of these hot summer days. The body is light and the carbonation is spritzy. Overall, this is a great bbq/summer/session brew. Forget those session IPAs (they aren't bad, just not my favorite trend)... I think these are due to catch on and catch fire in the craft beer world.","homebrew311","Jul 01, 2014"

You can pick up a touch of lactic acid tartness in a really tart yogurt, or light note of apple cider vinegar is available in the nares. Flavor a mix of tart cider, citric lemon notes, lactic acid found in greek yogurt finishes with an approachable level of brine saltiness finishes bone dry amongst all the tart and salty characters being tossed around. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied the lingering salt and lactic acid tartness really dries that palate out I'm talking a salty dry quality that makes it down the back of your throat.

Smell is actually bad, not something that gets you going for the beer. But the taste is excellent, sour and tart and even a little sweet. You notice the salt but it is faint, would have preferred a little more saltiness. An excellent thirst quencher as I had this in the heat on a boat. Overall an excellent beer and finally a Gose that I may be able to buy with some regularity.","JamieDuncan","Jun 17, 2014"

It smells a bit uninteresting, but I'm in a smelly bar, sooo... Anyways, the taste shines. Nice and tart, peach skin is a dominant flavor. Underripe peaches. A bit of wheatiness. Grape skins. Very effervescent, thirst quenching. This is a summer beer to me, forget over sweet witbiers. This and Berliner weisses are beers I'd like to see more often in America.","Jack_Malts","Jun 16, 2014"

3.99,3.6,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Gotta love when a random new gose shows up at your local. In a canned six-pack. Sweet. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a bit more than a finger of white foam. The nose comprises sharp lemon zest, light lemongrass, and a touch of ginger. The taste brings in more of the same, the lemon bringing a nice tartness. A bit of cracked wheat finds its way in there as well. For once, no real salt character is present, though a general mineral quality pervades the tartness, both cutting and bolstering it in turn. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a solid little refresher, something I hope comes around at least annually.","TMoney2591","Jun 07, 2014"

At first, it doesn’t seem that complex, because the citric, lactic tang dominates the mid- and the back of the palate, but the salty and subtly sweet, grainy notes add depth that complements the sour extremely well. It’s so crisp and drinkable, it’s kind of like the zany cousin of a really good cream ale/AAL, which I love in this weather as it is. I would happily session the crap out of this beer.","fmccormi","Jun 05, 2014"

Smell: pale malt, a little tangy smelling, mildly earthy. Taste: lemon wedge, tart white grape, then a pop of salt, lactic into a mild earthy finish.

Ordered using the entire name, which scrambled the server's brain (she was awesome by the way ... "Whaaa ... Oh, the Anderson Valley! Done!"). Arrived in a pint glass, an exceedingly pale straw color like many commercial lagers with a stippling of white foam on top. Smells vinous, a white wine boozy quality, tannic and tart with some cidery apple, cellar must, and tart lemon adding to the olfactory impression. Taste was predictably sour and salty, cider vinegar or old wine, coriander husk, pedestrian wheat malt spice and lemon rind with a briny sea salt foundation. I detect some other fruit that I cannot pinpoint more specifically. Thin to medium body like many summer wheat ales and fairly aggressive carbonation. Perhaps this style is not really my bag. I find the salt overpowering here and the whole package to be vinegar sour but without any appreciable yeasty funk or other flavors to provide balance. Its compelling but maybe not something I'd drink on a regular basis. Will try another gose soon to assess variation in the style. According to "Brewing With Wheat", traditionally gose was a fairly sour beer rather like a Berliner Weiss. This one does hit that mark.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 11, 2014"
