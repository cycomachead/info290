4.18,5,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a clear orange body with a half-finger of bubbly white head. Overall impression of appearance is of a Gose in head, with the blood oranges shown in the color of the body. Scents of salt water, with an ocean-like quality, mingling with medium-light aromas of blood orange and spicy coriander and a light earth funk from the yeast and light lactic acid. Overall impression of aroma is of a typical Gose, true to form, but with a good use of blood orange to add an additional bright aroma to the beer. Quite nice. Flavor begins lightly sour, with notes of lactic acid with a plan yogurt quality, moderate saltiness, tangy wheat malt flavors at moderate levels and a light level of blood orange. Middle gains in sourness, with notes of lactic acid still providing the sourness, bright fruitiness of blood orange at moderate levels and a moderate level of saltiness and tangy wheat. Finish is highly tart with strong notes of lactic acid, moderate saltiness, a nice tangy wheat malt still present and a medium-light blood orange flavor. Aftertaste is tart with notes of lactic acid, grainy, tangy wheat malt and salt. Overall impression of flavor is of a classic Gose, tart, salty and true to style, but enhanced by tangy, sweet blood orange. A very refreshing flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light bodied with effervescent carbonation and puckering, drying mouthfeel that urges you to take another sip. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderful Gose that is true to style and very refreshing. Overall this is an amazing Gose. It is traditional in its base, but the blood orange takes the aroma and flavor to new levels and makes this a fine, refreshing beer. Fantastic.","Auraan","Apr 03, 2015"

Feels quite carbonated and rough on the teeth, much like soda.  There was also a weird grain or corn note in the aftertaste.  Probably true to the style, but I didn't like it and won't be having it again.","citizencane","Apr 02, 2015"

Flavor's like nose, fairly balanced for the style, salt comes out more in the finish and is pleasant. Body's excellent. This is maybe the best, most drinkable gose I've ever had.

Pours a dull orange hue a slightly hazy clarity and a loose, pink-tinged, one inch white head that quickly sizzles and pops as it dissipates into a fizzy band around the shoulders.  Blood oranges are very apparent in the nose - it's almost reminiscent of Fanta orange cola.  Saltiness is evident from the first quaff and the blood orange is a bit diminished in the flavor profile; coming off spritzy and citrusy.  Mouthfeel is light and lively with a kiss of acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks.  I've only had this style a couple of times and they all have left a slightly different impression.  That said, I found this enjoyable and look forward to visiting it again during warmer weather.","Jwale73","Feb 10, 2015"

The nose comprises orange zest, lemon peel, very light biscuit, and a kiss on each cheek, one from Ginger and one from Lime.  We're popular.  The taste centers on tart blood orange and lemon zest, but also in the mix are mild ginger and a vague sweetness (one that underflows everything), along with a twinge of brine in the aftertaste.  The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium (leaning toward the former, though), with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.  Overall, a very enjoyable gose that doesn't overdo the tartness, maintaining a high degree of drinkability.  I'm not sure if I prefer this one over the regular gose, but I can say that I wouldn't turn down either were they offered to me.  Good times.","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2015"

4.05,1.8,3.5,4,4.25,3.75,4,"12 ounce can, no canning date that I could find.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing at all.  The brew smells like orange soda, lime/citrus, and a bit of saltiness.  I like the taste of this, it tastes like blood oranges, salt, limes, and some Tang citrus drink.  It's sweet, tart, and a bit salty.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and is very refreshing.  Even on a cold day, I'm still liking this.  It's a good sessionable brew, just the thing I'm looking for when I want to end the night with one more good beer that isn't very high in ABV.  And I figure this would be really good on a hot day.  I'm liking this one more and more the longer I drink it!  Definitely worth trying, and it's priced well at $8.99 a 6 pack.  Yeah, I think I'll be buying this again soon.","bluejacket74","Jan 18, 2015"

Initially I smelled a good amount of sprite on this, which was obviously a turnoff. However, 5 minutes in that aroma had faded away completely, and a nice tart orange aroma presented itself. That taste is a big tart blast, with a touch of citrus. Little to no noticeable salt. Body is light, crisp. Overall, a decent take on the gose style, would be nice on a hot day but not anything I'd buy regularly.","Thepleasantimbiber","Jan 14, 2015"

Has nice, big, fluffy looking white head that is well over an inch thick when first poured into the glass that settles, pretty quickly at that unfortunately, to a thin white ring lining the inside of the glass with practically zero lacing.  Has a very distinct orange/citrus aroma along with what I do believe is a hint of wheat.  Has a nice slightly sour and tart, yet also sweet at the same time somehow, citrus/orange flavor upfront along with a sort of musty, earthy bread like quality and of course a nice hint of salt.  Has  a very crisp, yet smooth, slightly prickly, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  A really fine effort here.  Quite and enjoyable beer.  Very easy to drink in the way good beer should be.  Everyone should try this beer!","neenerzig","Dec 19, 2014"

It's amazingly bright, sweet & sour play well together, and it's one of the easier drinking beers I can remember drinking recently. Keep in mind though, this beer loses it's brightness rather quickly. I've had some cans that were mellow and uninteresting. Very fresh cans are a treat indeed though, draft as well. Go buy you some of this.","joe1510","Nov 29, 2014"

Tartness is perceivable. The flavor is again, akin to orange seltzer with a hearty pinch of salt. Wheat comes in on the finish. If they didn't use any artificial flavoring, I would be impressed because this beer really displays some serious tart orange flavor. Light, zesty, bubbly and refreshing. The salinity adds a crispness that I enjoy. It's pretty much an orange-infused version of The Kimmie, The Yink & The Holy Gose. Loved that beer and loved this one, too.","VelvetExtract","Nov 27, 2014"

Mouthfeel is crisp with high carbonation and a light body balanced with a sticky acidic sour finish. Awesome variation on an already exceptional gose.","Fcolle2","Nov 12, 2014"

Aroma showcases the blood orange in a perfumy sort of way, grain bringing up the rear with a wet stone-like mineral quality.  Juicy blood orange flavor with a solid lemony tartness and light salt and coriander finish.  Like orange seltzer, but with added tartness and just a bit of grain lingering after each sip.  Super dry and light, near puckering.  If AV plans to just do this and the regular Gose year-round, I'm set.","wedge","Nov 08, 2014"

I am not going to attempt that tonight. That said I hope Anderson Valley makes this a regular thing. They make a damn good beer here. I guess its a beer? Anyway, its well worth trying. I picked this one up for $11 for the six pack, I figured it was worth the shot considering I did enjoy the other one. And it is. Maybe a bit pricey for what you get, but it's a flavorful style of beer and if you like tart/salty things this will do you right.","humuloner22","Oct 27, 2014"

Aromas of toasted grains, salt water/brine, and subtle raspberry and citrus tart notes. Flavors are very tart and sour forward, nicely balanced, with a blast of tart blood orange sweetness, ocean water saltiness, and a solid sour undertone. Orange rind and subtle roast highlights throughout. The body is full, but extremely dry and crisp. The aftertaste is more of the rich blood orange, with the tart raspberry shining through. The finish has a sour linger, although otherwise crisp and dry. Very refreshing, drinkable brew.","GarthDanielson","Oct 25, 2014"
