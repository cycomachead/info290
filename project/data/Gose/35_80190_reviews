"Just an average beer. Nothing wiring with but nothing special"

"Tastes better the closer you are to the start of the Boston Marathon!"
"O: interesting, but not something I would come back to; flavor was almost non-existent;"
""
"So unique, don't know whether it'd ever make it to the top of my beer list as a must get but this is the first gose I've ever experienced.  Malty goodness just rests on your palate while still maintaining a refreshing quench.  Complete lack of hop bitterness and a one-of-a-kind twang that I've never tasted before, finishes with a pleasant spice note (coriander)."

"Poured from the first set of growlers filled at their JP brewery. The beer pours a nice foamy white head that dissipates moderately. The beer itself is a clear light copper. The beer leaves quite a bit of thin lacing that lasts a while. The beer has a fairly light smell but not out of place for a gose. The notes tend to be coriander with a light hop profile and supplemented by salt with a hint of pepper. The taste is similar but with a stronger bitter hop and salt profile. The coriander is more of a background taste that complements salt. The mouthfeel is fairly towards the light end of medium bodied. Very refreshing and smooth. Overall, a pretty good after workout beer and worth getting while it's available."

"Draught @ Doyle’s: This one pours a hazy, darker golden color. It has a small white head that leaves some lacing. Lighter but nice aroma. Mainly notes of coriander and wheat. The taste is good. Medium to lighter body. Wheat and coriander are the main flavors. No real sweetness or bitterness. Crisp, refreshing. Pretty nice brew."

"An excellent Boston exclusive... I wish it was bottled. Sigh."

"This beer is the epitome of a session beer."

"O- Good beer, refreshing and drinkable."
"On tap at the Sam Adams tour: Poured a hazy light orangey color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coriander is well integrated with the malt base. Taste is refreshing with good notes of coriander and malt with light salty finish. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Well brewed and something I wouldn’t mind to have regular access during sumnmertime."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent flavorful lighter beer to drink for a while."

"The mouthfeel is thin and carbonation moderate. It felt very light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty decent beer, but it seemed a little dumbed down from the more traditional Leipziger version I've had. It tasted a little like a slightly salty version of their summer brew. While it may not be as bold as a traditional version, they did a pretty good job at incorporating those flavors into something the average craft beer drinker would like."
""
"Very refreshing with more than enough flavor for a lighter brew. Subtly extreme."
"Mouthfeel is good- light bodied, moderately carbonated (sorta prickly). I'm sure it'd be refreshing after running : ). Never had a gose before but it's tastes like a typical American interpretation of a Belgian wit or hefeweisse bier."
"26.2 is a tasty and remarkably refreshing beer. It really hit the spot on this 85 degree Marathon Monday. Kudos to the folks at Sam Adams for creating a terrific interpretation of this unfortunately underrepresented style."
""
"T: Grain and wheat with a highly carbonated mouthfeel and a lingering hint of salt at the back of the throat on the finish."
""
"Worth seeking out just to try a Gose."
