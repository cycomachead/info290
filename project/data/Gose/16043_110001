3.75,-10.1,,,,,,"The nose is tart, citrus peel, yeast, good funk.  It has a very rustic barnyard note.  The flavor is traditional gose, lots of salt, some wood, but I can't place the barrel.  Lemon zest at the end.  This is good, clean, but I never think of a gose as refreshing due to the saltiness.  Fun to try.","nmann08","Aug 27, 2014"

4.06,-2.6,5,4,4,4,4,"I tried this beer several times, on draft, at The Dew Drop Inn in Derby CT. Its a fantastic sour that left me wanting more. The salt was more obvious the second time I tried it as opposed to the first. I believe we were at the bottom of the barrel the second time I tried it. Anyways, if you can find it in a bottle at the store or see it on draft at a bar then you'd be foolish not to try it.","Matty123","May 06, 2014"
