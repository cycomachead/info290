Very refreshing to have a beer deliver on what you expect from it. The beer is also refreshing in general. It's pretty tart from the yuzu juice but not a sour/funkiness from a wild ale.","PHBoiler","Feb 28, 2014"

Front end is salty and a little coriander. Appearence is light with tons of head. Clarity is perfect. A basic gose taste leads into some light sour notes and a mild acidic back end. Nose is awesome Gose with slight sour horse blacket notes; could be a little stronger but perfection is there in subtle amounts. Excellent lasting carbonation throughout.

4.06,-4,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Well, I thought I'd like this beer more than I did, since I'm a big fan of Gose as a style, and their Gose in particular. I also really like the flavor of yuzu, and thought, for instance, that it added a nice twist to New Belgium's version with yuzu of their Berliner Weiss. Here, though, I don't think the yuzu adds anything, and in fact probably detracts from the base beer's nice hit of salt and subtle coriander. You do get some citrus, but it's not zingy in itself or particularly pronounced, it just slightly mutes everything else. I guess some may like the Gose toned down a bit, but I'd prefer the base beer in all its glory.","Georgiabeer","Jan 16, 2014"

Aromas are salty and tart, lemon meets bready malts, gentle salt and straw. Tart citrus, gentle bread and grass. Initial is firmly sour up front, lemony and yuzu elements make this a bit puckering. Middle quickly shows lactic life and straw meet salt, flaked wheat and gentle dough. Cleaner light body is quite drinkable, sourness really quite nice. Backend is tart, a touch salty but really that lactic and citrus fruit vibe really provide some synergy. Sour and quite crushable.

Light medium body, low carbonation level but an almost slick mouthfeel. Quite an interesting taste that is a nice balance of sour, citrus and salt. Yuzu juice yields a nice tartness that carries beyond the smooth finish. Another very well crafted ale from Westbrook and a new take on an old style.","tillmac62","Dec 29, 2013"
