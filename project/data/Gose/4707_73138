3.89,-0.8,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"someone told me that this recently medaled at the world beer cup or something, but i have yet to confirm that. its a heck of a nice goes no matter whether it won something or not, it should have. honey colored, not as pale as others, and with some clarity too until the bottom of the bottle. smallish white head fades fast, but there is plenty of bubbles in the beer. nose is nice and tart, lactic acidity is mid range, nothing caustic, but nice and zippy too. coriander is on the lighter side in both smell and taste, which is great, sometimes these get too foody and herbal, more mealish than beerish. this one stays light despite a richer color, and a little more body than the style average in my experience. salt is there, actually having a strange and paradoxical effect of making my mouth water after the swallow, and with the nice refreshing carbonation this is a wonderful beer for a warm afternoon. wheat malt is fresh and crockery. light citrus with the sourness, lemon rind or grapefruit flesh or something like that, when ice cold its perfect, but when it warms up and the pour gets dreggy, its not as flattering. definitely worth seeking out.","StonedTrippin","Apr 20, 2014"

4.07,3.8,3,4,4.25,4.25,4,"This poured out as a hazy golden color with with a fizzy white head that faded quickly. There is not lacing or retention I this red. Lively bubbles rising to the top of the beer. The second pour give a good amount of sediment making this a milky looking tan color. The smell is slightly tart with some wheat on the nose. The taste is tart with some lemon citrus, the salty wheat comes in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer has a big carbonation to it. Overall this is a pretty solid brew. Really enjoyable.","Knapp85","Mar 27, 2013"

3.5,-10.7,3,3,3.5,4,4,"D/O: This beer takes sourness to a new extreme for the style, but remains true to the clean and refreshing aspects at the same time. It has a less pronounced dehydrating effect than some others, suggesting a less aggressive salt addition. Krebs/Choc shows itself to be an adventurous small brewery in the stylistic choices they make, as in the case of this beer, even if the results aren't always entirely convincing.","beagle75","Beers"

4.05,3.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Beer is light in body and very salty, nice overall. Very enjoyable. Heavily carbonated on the palate, the finish is nice too, not dry. The lacto character in this beer is subdued but it is nice. I enjoyed it, a nicer gose than most I've had. I would have it again. More lactic creaminess would make this beer better.","drabmuh","Oct 28, 2011"
4.05,3.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer is transparent and light orange colored, with a half inch of white head. The aroma offers white grape juice, grape skins, white wine, spice. The flavor resembles ocean water. Salty and earthy. Lingering sea salt in the finish. A bit of a puckering sensation in the cheeks. Very bold flavor. Definitely recognizable as a gose right off the bat. A very good example of the style, I would definitely have this again.","Huhzubendah","Oct 16, 2011"

3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"That's right, a new gose. And from the Sooner State, no less! Right on. It pours a cloudy pale golden straw (pretty much yellow) topped by a finger of white foam. The nose seemed more like that of a white wine than a beer: Mike and I agreed that a spicy chardonnay or moscato fit the bill pretty nicely. Basically it's all just spicy white grapes, with a hint of coriander, balsa, and tart lemon zest cowering in the distance. The taste returns to the usual gose territory, with notes of tart lemon, light tart orange zest, coriander, cracked wheat, light cardamom, and a twist of tart grapefruit. Not very much of a salty character here, which I've gotten in the other goses I've sampled. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, almost sticky finish. Overall, a highly enjoyable brew, not too sour, but something easily drinkable in large amounts (if so desired). Good times.","TMoney2591","Sep 25, 2011"
3.25,-17.1,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Overall: A bit more tart that I expected. The spice flavor was intense, but good. I would consider having another.","oline73","Sep 21, 2011"
3.53,-9.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Since this is the first Gose I've tried, I really don't have anything to compare it to, but it seems to be in line with the style guide. I've decided not to throw the towel in on this beer, but I think the bottling in a magnum demands sharing with friends. While this one kicked my butt a bit, I will seek out a few more for comparisons sake.","stephens101","Sep 20, 2011"
3.93,0.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Dirty apricot with a two finger disc of white head that comes just to the lip of the tulip. Earthy wheat sets a mild backdrop for the lemon juice and peel mixed with ruddy seawater flavor profile. Distinct, yet multidimensional and well-integrated lactic tartness drives the beer and further accents the citrus from the coriander. Intriguing but so refreshing and easy to gulp that it's hard to make the bottle last long enough to contemplate it. The rustic graininess comes out further once it warms. Choc has done a nice job with this one and I'll be picking up one or two more bottles while it's still around.","bump8628","Sep 20, 2011"
3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O - This is a pretty unique beer unlike any I have tasted. The beginning is pretty standard for a farmhouse ale but the salty flavor is a bit of a surprise. The maltiness in the finish is more indicative of a pilsner. This is definitely an interesting brew that you should try if you get the chance.","sdmvd6","Sep 16, 2011"
