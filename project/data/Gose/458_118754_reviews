"The perfect style of beer for the Texas summer. Light in color and body, the limes are apparent in both the aroma and the flavor. The salt hits about middle to slightly after. Malt is very unpronounced and shows up toward the finish. Hard to tell if the coriander has any influence as the lime predominates."

"A perfect beach drink."
"Its not much on the sour end of things, unfortunately. Those hoping for something as tasty as Westbrook's offering will be left wanting, but there are some enjoyable flavors to be found here, mostly the soft wheat, salt and lime. The coriander I could do without in this beer and oddly, I find this better on the cooler side as opposed to cellar temp. Good enough to go back for repeat sixer purchases, but still leaves me dreaming of having Westbrook Gose in a PICC line."
"Pours out a hazy brass with no head.  Smells largely of grain and lime.  Lime and salt are the big flavors here.  Lightly tart and a bit sweet.  Grainy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is a tad flat and lightbodied.  Overall, this is OK in the can.  Way better on tap, but I'm rating this based on the can example.  On tap it seemed to be drier, tarter, and saltier (all better in my opinion)."
"O: not disappointed but probably will not buy again due to my slight distaste of wheat beers."

"O: Definitely different from the other Gose I've tried, Westbrook. I think I like Westbrook better, it was a little bit more tart, but this is really nice. Got this as a single, planning on buying a sixer next time I hit the store."

"Pours medium yellow with a redish tinge. Soured fruit notes with no hoppiness in the nose. Taste is wonderful. Light sour with a bit of lime and spice to back it up. Finished pretty dry. High carbonation which is a bit different but works for it. Overall a great Saturday afternoon six pack."

"O- Interesting take on the Gose, let's call it a Tex-Mex version of the German style given that it has a heavy lime flavour with a little bit of cilantro. Not my favorite Gose as it's not as tart as Westbrook's version, but it does have a bit more in common with Leipzeiger's version than Westbrook's."

"Pours a cloudy golden beer with little to no head. Smells like lime, a little stale. Taste is very light and limey like a Mexican lager with a lime in it, the lime really shines through definitely not in the background. Body is very light and clean. Its a refreshing pool side drinker, nothing extremely special, but super sessionable and great for outside."

"Can had more lime flavor and a bit less tartness. Perfect carbonation on the cans. Overall, a great summer refresher."

"Cloudy straw colored pour with a minimal head white head that fades quickly and medium carbonation. Aroma has hints of lemon and lime. Fruity with a citrus/lemon/lime flavor that has nice tart edge. Very light and dry beer that finishes slightly sour."

"Certainly not a brother to Saint Arnold Boiler Room, but a close cousin. Both, are great examples of hard to make unique styles. Highly recommended."
