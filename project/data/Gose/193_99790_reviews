"Pale straw with thick white head.  A bit of funk in the aroma.  Tart, tangy, citrusy and salty taste.  Refreshing and sessionable.  Not quite as crisp as it could be though."

"O: Not the most complex I've had, but enjoyable nonetheless"
""
"Glad I could find this one after having the Blood Orange variant, which I thought was really tasty too!"
""
""
""
""
"Touches on some of the positive qualities of a gose but lacks depth in my opinion."
""
""
"Thin and light body, quite easy to drink, but you don't want to chug it.  Lots of carbonation, dry finish, easy to drink (once you get used to the style)."
""

""
""

""

"Great sour, nice tart apple flavor with a hint of citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not having much (or any?) experience with the style, I'm left pretty satisfied. My one knock is that I actually feel like this beer could use a bit more flavor coming in from somewhere. Yeah, there's an intense tart/sweet/salty kind of combination going on, but other than the biscuity finish and pretty slight orange flavor, there's not much else there. Regardless, this is a beer that deserves a look. Very nice."
""
""
"Overall: This is a tasty gose. I will definitely repeat this beer."

"Pours a hazy deep straw yellow producing 2 fingers of mineral water effervescent, shortlived, foamy, white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma has a low malt profile but I detect pilsner malts & wheat, oddly in that order. It is crisp & dry with hints of green apple, lemon, lime, brine & it may be my imagination but a little grassy hop hint. Taste opens with salinity & lactic acid sourness & largely persist overpowering hints of pilsner malt, tart green apples (sprinkled with salt), lemon & lime in a peppery, clean, crisp, dry finish. Aftertaste is salty lemon, lime & tart green apple. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation that rapidly dissipates as the brew warms, astringent, prickly & dry. This style is often brewed with coriander however I pick up no coriander hints at all."

"Beer label says ""Session Series"" and fits description. I enjoyed this beers salt, tart and refreshing finish immensely and will make this a regular session beer summer or hell any season  of the year if I can find it here often in the mitten state."

"Gold color with thin white head (draft into 12 tulip);sour ball aroma; tart and salty start; sour all finish;lite mouthfeel with good carbonation; overall an easy drinking refresher."

"More or less. didn't impress me"
"O: Solid beer, tasty and refreshing, no real flaws, missing some intangibles to make it great."
""
""
""
"Light straw body. Fast dissipating head. Sorry if people like it, but the smell reminds me of puke. The vomit smell you get when you drink to much cheap booze. Taste is similar. Do not like it at all. Reminds me of drinking too much and getting sick back in highschool."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice gose from Anderson Valley and probably the best option for a year round, widely available gose, though Troublesome from Off Color certainly gives this a run for its money. Still enjoyable during winter but this is definitely one of the best warm weather options out there."
""
"this is a grat beer... if you dont like Gose it isnt this beers fault"
""
""
""
""
"O - It is a rare day when I find something truly new to me in beer.  This was extraordinary.  A first foray, I guarantee it will not be my last.  The experience is not too different from a juicy IPA, but instead of big hops the Gose comes with sourness and saltiness.  Skeptical, I found this not only works, but is a winning combination.  Thank you Anderson Valley."
"Tart, salty, crisp, nice departure from what most beers have become lately."
""
""
"Like it!"
""
""
""
"O - It is quite a refreshing brew. I am not a fan of salt, but it is nice with the dry finish. This would have been a more better choice on a hot summer day than a cold January day, but it still hits the spot."
"I'm surprised  that something so light in alcohol has so much flavor and bite.  It's dry and a bit sour.  Nicely carbonated, and very refreshing.  Reminds me of a wine cooler.  I would probably prefer this to a session IPA, because those tend to be subdued and this has a lot going on.  Would likely go well with fish or salad.  I like.    Some people giving it a very low rating are probably not familiar with Gose and are expecting a regular beer."

"Grabs hold like a sour patch kid!"
""
""
"Overall - It's good. Think I liked their Blood Orange Gose slightly better. These brews are just so dang tart that it's tough to put down more than a few at a time."
"O:  Good stuff that I thought was a one-off or rotating, some reason, but it seems to be year-round now.  Now to nab some of the fruited variants."
""

"This is some refreshing, unique deliciousness right here."
""
""
"Overall a bit like unsweetened lemonade.  Very tart!"
""
""
"I am not a fan of sour. In my humble opinion, any sour flavor does not belong in my beer. I drank enough to get a legitimate taste of this beer, but could not fathom more than a couple ounces total."
"This is my first time trying a Gose, and I must say this might be my new favourite beer type.  Unlike anything I've ever tasted before, this will definitely be one I keep coming back to!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall interesting, I'm mixed on it, it is quite refreshing and enjoyable, but so sour and tart, nice blend of the salt and flavors, actually it was pretty nice for a gose."
""
""
""
"Overall: Too tart for me to session, but definitely an enjoyable beer, perhaps better reserved for July and not late November."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Someone else wrote a review stating that they're not over the moon with the style. Agree on that. I was really excited, though, to try it! It seriously has been something I've been hoping brewers would attempt again. They also make a Blood Orange flavored Gose, which has an additional almost acrid acidity but some orange brightness. If you want something different, this definitely falls into the category. And despite the flavors, it kind of grows on you and in virtue of its light body and bracing saltwater-y nature is actually super easy to drink."
"Overall: I am not over the moon with this style, but I actually like this. I could recommend this to those who are not too familiar or just getting into the Gose style. This really does remind me of the Malt Liquor style brew, just with more tartness. At the end of the day I could sit back and slam a few of these watching a Baseball game. This brew is worthy!"
""
""
"This is a very tart beer.....I get that it is a Gose....but whammy.  The beer pours crisp clear yellow with head that is not lacing.  The scent and taste is like a sweetart.  The mouthfeel was lighter in body with big carbonation.  Overall I will not have this again.  Don't like the style."
"Crisp, tart and refreshing goes.  Strong berry tartness that pairs well with roasted meat.  Would drink again and ranks up there with Westbrook gose"

"Poured from purple can into nonic pint glass.  Nice pale golden color with a slight hint of haze.  Good white head, lacing as well, with a few scattered dollops of foam as it settles.  Nose is a little tame with some bready notes in there, and a hint of tangy citrus.  The palate was a big surprise with the lovely sour, citrusy flavors.  Nice and sour, and also very drinkable.  Some herbal qualities on the palate as it goes to the finish, and aftertaste."

"Pours a straw yellow with big white head. It looks like champagne. Smell is mostly of light bready malts with some tartness and citrus. Taste is very tart upfront with some citrus. Then the malt comes in, just enough to remind you this is a beer and not a cider or champagne. Nice salty finish with a tartness that lingers. Mouthfeel is super light and crisp. This is a perfect summer beer, although I could drink it at any time. Overall, this is pretty good. It's my first gose so I wasn't completely sure of what to expect, but I think I was pretty close. I got this and the Blood Orange version as well. Should be even better!"

"Sour grain with hints of lemon. Very tart. Good carbonation. Light and easy drinker, perfect day drinker at 4.2% abv."
""
""
""
"Draft.  Not a fan of this style.  Hay, honey, salt, funk and wheat.  That's the taste.  This is mild.  Like a Budweiser.  So, I can see this being a transitional beer for novice craft beer drinkers.  Light and drinkable.  Funky aftertaste as well.  Beertender, can I perhaps have something else?"

"Cost: $5 for a 12 oz can (bar price)."

"Can as a trade extra. Thanks! Pours hazy golden with a big fluffy white head. Tart wheaty aroma, lots of hay, some funk, and a bit dry and salty as expected. Flavor is sweet honey and wheat from the malts up front, just a tinge of tart, some tangy salty notes in the middle of the tongue, and finishes with some pineapple and a dirty wheaty finish. Light bodied with medium plus plus carbonation. Overall much sweeter than others in the style I've had. Still, not a huge fan of this style. A bit bland and what flavor that is there is just weird. Oh well. Another tick."
""
""
""
""
""
"Similar to a German Sour. Very tart and not a great smell."
""

"Listen, I admit that gose is apparently just not my style. While this is admittedly my first gose (I'm pretty sure), and by all accounts it's a great example of the style. Apparently gose is just not for me. Enjoy it if you're into it, I'll leave them for you."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, it had the tart and salty aspects that I expect from the style and it lived up to it's claim as being a good session beer for the warm weather.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, very dry on the finish, a little crisp, not filling at all and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, just when I think the tartness and salty flavors would start to wear on me I end up coming back for more, so I think I could drink a few of these, especially on a really hot day.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance and the mouthfeel, when it came to the taste it had really nice balance and none of the aspects were too overpowering.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was just a little bland with a little too much grainy malts.  I would buy this beer again and I might actually get a six pack.  I would recommend this beer to anyone who doesn't mind a little tartness and if your a fan of the style then it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just what I expect from the style and I enjoyed drinking it, it doesn't feel like it should be so easy to drink, but it is.  It isn't my favorite Gose, but it is one of the better beers that I've had from this brewery.  Good job guys, thinks for doing this style justice, keep up the good work."

"A bit like drinking seawater, but nevertheless good tasty session beer. I think they should let the beer character shine more by tuning down the salt and the tartness."

"(3.65) O:  not bad, big flavor in a 4.2% package. Leipziger gose is the standard by which i judge, a 3.65 seems about right here to me."

"Average retention after the pour, not much lacing. Good initial rush of sourness which is sustained afterwards. Saltiness comes on after the sip. Middle of the road Gose for me."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 8/29/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with solid retention, that reduces to ring of lacing that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, pear, wheat, bread, coriander, sea salt, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt, sea salt/spice, and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of tart lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, pear, wheat, bread, coriander, sea salt, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity tartness and salinity on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, lime, green apple, white grape, pear, wheat, bread, coriander, sea salt, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of pale malt, sea salt/spice, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic/saline mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is an excellent Gose style! All around great complexity and robustness of pale malt, sea salt/spice, and fruit yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall:  this is a very drinkable beer.  Tart and refreshing.  I have a hard time rating this beer because it does not hit the style, but is a tasty beverage.  Geuze is supposed to be funky like the livestock are at the county fair. But, this beer hits some of the points.  Is very drinkable......"
""
""
""
"Great sour flavor."
"O: This is my first ever Gose, and I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. This a a good hot day beer."
""
""
"O - A very dry nicely balanced tart brew, very refreshing, great with spicy food"
""
"I had this beer on tap at the Galaxy Hut in Arlington, VA.  It poured a hazy golden-honey color with lots of small bubbles around the sides of the glass. The nose had notes of something sour and wildflowers.  The mouthfeel is super light and very dry.  The taste is very sour forward with notes of salt, vinegar, and fresh cut grass. Super refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Easy to drink but a little shallow on the flavor profile, but well worth a go"
"O: A nice gose, more on the acidic side compared to a lot of them."
"Pours golden from the can with a slight white head that leaves quickly. Very slight smell of salt and spice. The taste is salt, tart lemon, coriander and other spices. Super refreshing. Light mouth with crisp carbonation that is very dry. It's exactly as described, and would be super on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
"Solid tart beer, but not a lot of complexity."
""
""
"Overall: easily available, easy to drink and just a touch on the sour side. I find myself going for this one at bars when I want to switch it up from the usual styles. seems to be the most readily available gose around and not a bad one at all"

"My first commercially-brewed gose.  Refreshing opening, very similar to Berliner Weisse but with a bit more body. Finish was satisfying as the salt countered the tartness well and lent diversity to the experience."
"This was consumed (following a mad chase of draft pours, holiday bar closings, and eventual nirvana moment of cases of cans in the bottle shop) with much anticipation. This is a cool conundrum of a beer. This looks and smells like an average lager. Based on how I follow ratings, I (as many others) put as much emphasis on appearance, aroma, mouthfeel, etc as taste. This beer (and maybe entire style) deserves a bit more investigation. Golden, straw colored brew with a little bit of head. Looks like lawnmowerville. Bit of sour hit to the nose, light aroma, and just a hint of bready/yeasty goodness. BOOM! Nice tart punch up front, a bit salty, and such inspiring sour notes. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Ironically, this would probably make for a nice lawnmower beer... or a sipper... or anything for that matter. Damn, I need to brew a Gose. When compared to Westbrook, AV has all of the same funky, salty deliciousness, though I found it to be a bit 'lighter' all around. Love it, recommend it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Try it if you were hesitant, I am a stout and IPA fan. I like bold flavors. I enjoyed the interlude with this beer, its flavorful enough but crisp and one you could drink a few of without tiring quickly."
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  I have a very hard time with the Gose style.  This is one of the better examples I have tried however.  I think the tartness and the fact that it wasn’t completely, 100% overwhelming in the salt department."
""
"Grainy wheat, sour lemon juice and a salty aftertaste. This is not terrible but, it is a style that I am not particularly fond of."

"The Crack! let loose a squirt the likes of which I have not seen from an intact CAN! Sometimes, if a CAN is dented, it will push the beer to the top, but in this case, the beer was up to the lip! It must have been overfilled when the lid was seamed on to get it this full. A new standard has been set. I began an inverted Glug, but “effervescent” was the operative word here. Following a brief pseudo-cascade, I got three-plus fingers of puffy, fizzy, bone-white head that was as carbonated as soda pop and lasted for just a short time before fading away. Color was a Pale-Straw (SRM = 1 – 2) and I just urinated a darker liquid. Nose was tart, yet salty. I felt like I was back at sea, smelling the breeze on the fantail.  Mouthfeel was thin, but very fizzy. The taste was initially puckeringly tart, like sucking on a lemon, but then the saltiness kicked in, mellowing the intensity of the tartness. Finish was bone dry, puckeringly dry and I could hear the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara Desert as I reached for my asthma inhaler. Well, if you are looking for something very different or if you really want a thirst quencher during the Summer months, this would be it. It was as refreshing as ginger ale, but without the sugar. Pardon me while I try to prise my lips apart."
" The taste has a lovely tangy citrus quality with mild wheat flavor light lemony tartness with mild wheat that gives a light toastiness w/ mild mineral aspect in the finish which is dry and has a slightly sour flavor still residing. Overall I think this is a great wheat beer with a noticeable sourness level and quenching overall refreshment factor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have an affinity for this style but in small doses. I wish smaller glass options were available. By the half point I wanted something different. 10 oz is perfect. No head after a bit but I think it is a fine effort"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this and the Westbrook are the only goses I've had, and I think this one wins out slightly IMO.  It's less sour than Westbrook's, but also lacking the salt flavor the Westbrook had."
""
""
""
""
""
"i like this as much for the beer as i do for the packaging decision. i am sick of a bomber of gose, its a beer for sessioning and drinking enormous quantities of in hot weather (at least it is for me), so its always frustrating to spend upwards of ten bucks for a bottle i will likely have to share anyway and then move on. a nationwide sixer of gose is the ticket, genius really, and although i know westbrook does it too, they dont come out this way too often. the beer itself is right on too, clean but really tart. not as salty as some, but that mouthfeel and minerality are there, along with a citrusy kick thats new to the style for me, and a ton of carbonation that really makes it an outstanding refresher. salty lemon sort of flavor to the finish, acidic enough, and just really delicious ice cold right from the can. i see they also did a blood orange version of this that i really need to get my hands on!"
""
""
""
"Nicely tart, slightly sour with a delicious bit of sweet this is a Gose with tempered salt. There's a bit of sour wheat malt, some Apple, pear, citrus, Sweetarts candy and lemon to complete a relatively complex but lightly presented beer. This is incredibly easy to drink and immensely sessionable."
"A solid beer. Far more balanced and true to style than many other American interpretations of Gose."

"Pours a amberish yellow with nice swirling into the glass.  Pour finishes with a 1/2 finger white head that dissipates quickly.  To me the taste is wate...boom sour!  The sour is very present, but not the only thing you taste.  Really can't get over how easy to drink this one is.  A 32 oz growler is gone within a few min.  Good thing is it's also extremely light on alcohol, so quenching your thirst shouldn't kill you."

"Grainy, lightly sour aroma, with a hint of coriander. Softly floral, a bit earthy, and minerally. Flavor reveals extremely tart, then sour, lemon character at the forefront, puckering. Grain is subtle in comparison. There's a lightly earthy finish. Far more tart than most. Guess I'd hoped for something less one-note. Lemon isn't my fave."

"I will be very sad if this beer ever becomes unavailable.  It's currently very easy to get and one of the only Goses in cans that I am aware of.  Another excellent summer beer or ""outside"" beer.  This is a little more ""dry sour"" than some of my favorite Goses (Rapp Brewing), but all-in-all still very good."

"Very nice gose"
""

"Probably the second best American-made Gose behind Westbrook's. It's not nearly as mouth-puckeringly sour as the WB version, but still has a nice acidic kick and a great balance of malt, wheat and sea salt."
""
"Pours a bit hazy, almost Amber golden color. Kicked up a small head that quickly faded to nothing. Aroma is of wheat, citrus and sour apple. The taste just reaches out and slaps you with its lemony tartness, followed by a bit of saltiness. The mouthfeel was very light with a lot of carbonation bubbles that just make you want to drink more. Overall, this is one of the most refreshing beers I've ever drank. I see lots of them in my future."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."

""
""
""
""
"3.55/5: Very drinkable, refreshing, and enjoyable; but the saltiness/mild sourness may not be for everybody"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good, a little one dimensional but still classic gose. A good starter for a gose, not overall strong or sour."
""
""
""
"As the rustic ale dissolves in finish, it does so with the briny, minerally and damp hay aftertaste that we've come to enjoy about authentic Northern German gose. Its racy carbonation and bright vinous acidity refreshes the palate at a very high rate, sip after sip. The beer is simply way too easy!"

"12 ounce can. Served in a stange glass, the beer pours a hazy golden color with about an inch white head that stuck around a while. There's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like tart lemon/lime, green apples, bready/wheat malt and some salt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some mineralness. It's tart and refreshing. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's very easy to drink. It's a good, sessionable brew. Good thing I bought a 6 pack of this, but I have a feeling it isn't going to last too long! $9.99 a 6-pack."
""
""
"Overall I hope I can still find a sixer of these to take up to the lake before it cools off this year. Solid gose"

"Overall - Drinkable for what it is, but not a tremendously interesting beer."
""
"T: Kinda tastes like a dry French cider. Sulfur and salt balance an astringency reminiscent of orange pulp rather than harsh lemon rind or peel. Dandelion with grassy notes. Lightly sweet from pear and apple. Lemon citrus. Nice salty balance."

"This is my very first gose, and based on this one little can, it it one intriguing style of beer. Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head with good retention. Big aromas of sour fruit (sour apple and unripened cherries) and salty marshlands are dominant, with a bit of the wheatiness detectable as well. Taste is primarily a swirl of saltiness and tart fruity notes like apricot and pear. Extremely dry finish. The saltiness greatly enhanced my enjoyment of a sweet nectarine. Overall, I dig this beer and feel inspired to seek out new goses."

"Pours yellow gold with a slight chill haze that falls off and has a beautiful fountain like stream of effervescence coming up from the center. Nose is a touch sweet with some pale malt and hop floral. Light sweet flower petals. The taste is light crisp, a bit tart and very refreshing. This is a gentler gose than the westbrook with not so much sour that it puckers you. Just enough tartness to whet the whistle and then the saline aspects keep it whetted. A touch malty as it warmed. Light sweet hoppiness in this one and I really liked it."
"Overall: this is my first Gose. It's low in alcohol and while it's not complex, it's still unique and has lots of flavors. What's cool is how well the salt complements this beer. Initially I was intrigued yet unsure by the thought of a salty flavor in beer but after drinking this, I can see how it works well."

"O- An enjoyable beer and something I could see myself buying again being a cheap alturnitive to the German Goses I can find. The saltiness is a little higher than the German examples I have tried and it doesn't have the same balance."

"A big shout out to the super woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. This beer came gushing out of the can despite no agitation. Has a pale yellow color with a 2 inch head. Smell is very sour, some salt as well. Taste was not good. Very sour, tart, lemons, a bit salty as well. Feels light and sour in the mouth and while others may like this flavor profile, it's not for me. i didn't care much for this one."

"O- Very refreshing and palate-cleansing. I could drink this all night, and its not from lack of flavor. Not sure how it stands up to the Westbrook offering, but it feels like its missing a little something. I'd have to try them side by side to discern this. Overall, very balanced and I'm willing to try again."

"The aroma has a hint of tartness and funk, followed by a light sour mash scent which comes across on the palate. It's crisp and tangy, with just a touch of sour tartness and a drying salty brininess on the finish."

""
"Very interesting. Pours decent head which goes away quite promptly. The small is a little weird but when u taste, it is quite a surprise. It is a tangy beer with flavors of pepper, citrus and an obvious taste of salt(I guess sea salt). I was a little scared to try, but WOW, all of the flavors come together and make a great sparkling, citrusy, refreshing beer that would be enjoyable anytime, especiall drank cold on a warm summer day. Not like any other, but well worth a try !!!"

"This beer is just great. AV can't produce enough of this. I wish they'd send some to New Mexico already, I don't know what the hang up is there. I'm going to go ahead and say I like this better than Westbrook Gose and I feel this is more true to style."

"12oz can. Pours a semi translucent pale yellow color with a 1/4 inch of head. Zero lacing. The aroma is tart and funky with some wheat and peppery notes. The taste is lots of tart lemon upfront followed by some wheat and earth. Finishes with some wheat and lemon and a hint of salt. Earthy at times but mostly sour citrus. Floral hints. Slightly dry mouthfeel with a bit of that puckering lemon effect. Refreshingly sour with a low abv and high drinkability. Ideal summer beer. Overall, pretty solid brew I'd grab again."
""
""
"O- Pretty decent example of the style. Nothing more, nothing less. I'd like a bit more salt and more tartness. The nose was disappointing and I thought I was going to get a bready wheat beer.. luckily, the flavour profile came through here."

"Overall, nice tart lactic fruit with a bit of salt. One of the better goses I've had. A nice refreshing summer beer."

"Interesting, but not something I can say I’ve fallen in love with. If it had a little more character besides it’s dryness, I might be more into it. At least it’s something different than the million or so blonde ales that so many brewers are putting out this time of year."

"I don't think this will win too many friends for the style, but it's certainly cheap enough. One of the less offensive brews from Anderson Valley. From the 12 oz can purchased at Special Brews in Lynnwood, Washington."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The obvious comparison is to Westbrook Gose. This is not as tart and complex, but arguably better balanced. Definitely a fantastic summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Even with only about 10 ounces of beer in this can, this still tasted pretty good. I couldn't find anything on the inter webs about any filling problems at Anderson Valley so maybe they all are like this? Those issues aside this is a solid Gose but there are others I would seek out first."
""
""
"Bottom Line: Darn good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - unique, refreshing, and good. I may buy this again if I see it again."
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a pale, hazy, corn-gold coloring with a filmy halo of head, and a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body. Nose of tart white grape, sour notes, hints of sea salt, toasted grains, floral highlights, and subtle citrus notes. Flavors are smooth and sweet, with a lemon zest and white wine forward blend, crisp and dry, followed by a slightly sour and tart feel. Saltiness clears up into the aftertaste, keeping it mellow. Light, crisp, and refreshing. The finish is clean and crisp. Amazingly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"o - overall a fairly nice gose. Missing some of the tarty sweetness that you get in the Westbrook, which I prefer, but nonetheless this is a really drinkable and tasty gose. Glad to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Anyway, gose biers can go several ways. The balance of tartness is the most important, and keep in mind I'm not basing this on anything historical, or on any known beer - because there is/was no existing beer, and there was no measurement at all for pH until at least 1909, and then it was just getting started. The second part is the saltiness. The third is the spice. Beyond that you have malt and hop, but it's these three things that need to fall into line to make the beer work, and I think Anderson Valley has pulled that off. It's salty, then tart, then woody/earthy/spicy. Then you repeat. It doesn't have a lot of depth to it, but it is complex. And refreshing. And at only about 4.2% ABV you can drink a lot of it."
""
""
""
""
"I want to preface this review by saying I have never found myself being a huge fan of the gose. Granted, I haven't tried the Westbrook version which I hear is great, but I've had my fair share. It was a style I just didn't ""get"". Well this beer changed my perspective on that. This is reviewed from a can. Pours a clear gold with minimal head and no retention. The nose is somewhere between an American wheat and a berliner weisse. There is noteable wheat grain character that comes through along with a bright popping citrus character. A bit of tangy lactobacillus sits in the background and just entices me to take a sip. Up front on the palate you get a wave of salt. This was the part that didn't make sense to me in the style. Well, now it does. The salt in this brew is very noticeable and almost takes on the taste of salt water for a split second. This quickly gives way to a dash of tartness and then a big zesty lemony character at the finish. The salt/citrus/tartness makes for an incredibly harmonious and refreshing combination that is incredibly quenching, especially during some of these hot summer days. The body is light and the carbonation is spritzy. Overall, this is a great bbq/summer/session brew. Forget those session IPAs (they aren't bad, just not my favorite trend)... I think these are due to catch on and catch fire in the craft beer world."
""
"It's clean like my baby mama out of the wash, but when I walk by the bathroom right after I am greeted with those fruity flavors....ay. Now, Raul wouldn't call this thang fruity, but the wheat and sour qualities aren't exactly making him excited. Again, it's not bad. But a bit more bite and salt would make Raul want to holla for another. But as for now it is one and done."

""
""

"Well this certainly is salty. So that is certainly covered. Definitely tart and sour. So that's covered. But it's all kind of one dimensional. Not really interesting or overly complex. I guess I'm jaded because I've had the Westbrook Gose. Decent, but I wouldn't go for it again."

"Cheers to an American brewery for doing a Gose style beer. This was one of the more interesting beers I have had in a long time and I have to say I am a big fan. I was put off initially by the poor aroma but the flavor was outstanding. By the end of the beer, the head had completely disappeared and it transformed into something that resembled a Gueuze lambic. If you're into sour beers, don't hesitate to give this one a whirl."
""
""
"Slightly hazed golden body with bright white head forming thick fine speckled lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma sharp citric wheat notes, acidity evident even in the nose. You can pick up a touch of lactic acid tartness in a really tart yogurt, or light note of apple cider vinegar is available in the nares. Flavor a mix of tart cider, citric lemon notes, lactic acid found in greek yogurt finishes with an approachable level of brine saltiness finishes bone dry amongst all the tart and salty characters being tossed around. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied the lingering salt and lactic acid tartness really dries that palate out I'm talking a salty dry quality that makes it down the back of your throat. Overall, a solid canned gose in the US of A pretty cool to know that there's more adventurous brewers like Westbrook and Anderson Valley willing to do just that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice, raggedy gose."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy gold with a foamy bone head that settles to a wisps film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is slightly tart with malt, wheat, spice, and salt aromas. Taste is much the same with sour wheat, spice, and salt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and easy to drink."

"Picked this up when I saw it because it is hard to find a Gose. Hoped it could measure up to Lost Nation Gose. Not a great appearance, kinda light with a decent head. Smell is actually bad, not something that gets you going for the beer. But the taste is excellent, sour and tart and even a little sweet. You notice the salt but it is faint, would have preferred a little more saltiness. An excellent thirst quencher as I had this in the heat on a boat. Overall an excellent beer and finally a Gose that I may be able to buy with some regularity."
""
""
""
""
"Looks piss-yellow, but this is not a bad thing. Slightly hazy. The head is white and effervescent and fades quickly. It smells a bit uninteresting, but I'm in a smelly bar, sooo... Anyways, the taste shines. Nice and tart, peach skin is a dominant flavor. Underripe peaches. A bit of wheatiness. Grape skins. Very effervescent, thirst quenching. This is a summer beer to me, forget over sweet witbiers. This and Berliner weisses are beers I'd like to see more often in America."
""

"A solid Gose but its a little heavier on the sour/tartness than the others.  I think its well done, but some of the others out there I prefer more."

"This gose is very salty, very refreshing, and very crisp. It starts out tart but gives way to a salty, slightly dry but refreshing delight. The beer has a medium creamy feel, which balances out the saltiness in a good way. It's very easy to drink and the saltiness does not become fatiguing on the palate. I enjoyed it so much, I'll seek out more."
""
"O-A tart Gose in a six pack of cans that isn't ridiculously pricey!? So goddamn cool. Very happy with this beer. I will definitely make this a steady contributor in my fridge this Summer. Very well done, both in the beer's packaging format and the overall product as well."

"O: Overall light tangy and delightful once you get over the initial shock of it. Not at all like the other gose I have had, but probably a little more enjoyable. Salty and tangy, although slightly like a watered down salty saison."

"Overall I'm a fan of this one and would recommend it to anyone who likes sour beers. Great sour wheat base with a dose of saltiness."
""
""
""
""
"Gotta love when a random new gose shows up at your local. In a canned six-pack. Sweet. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a bit more than a finger of white foam. The nose comprises sharp lemon zest, light lemongrass, and a touch of ginger. The taste brings in more of the same, the lemon bringing a nice tartness. A bit of cracked wheat finds its way in there as well. For once, no real salt character is present, though a general mineral quality pervades the tartness, both cutting and bolstering it in turn. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a solid little refresher, something I hope comes around at least annually."
""
"O: Very enjoyable and it has a nice wine-like quality that several wine drinkers I know enjoyed. Good flavors, easy to drink, and refreshing. Definitely worth grabbing if you are not in the distribution area of Westbrook's Gose."
""
""
"Overall (3.75): I really enjoy this. At first, it doesn’t seem that complex, because the citric, lactic tang dominates the mid- and the back of the palate, but the salty and subtly sweet, grainy notes add depth that complements the sour extremely well. It’s so crisp and drinkable, it’s kind of like the zany cousin of a really good cream ale/AAL, which I love in this weather as it is. I would happily session the crap out of this beer."
"Pours a clear gold with bleached white, big fluffy head. Settles quickly down to a thin ring, a few dots on the glass. Smell: pale malt, a little tangy smelling, mildly earthy. Taste: lemon wedge, tart white grape, then a pop of salt, lactic into a mild earthy finish. Lighter side of medium bodied, nice midsip carbonation hit that leads into a mildly tart juicy-ish finish. Tasty and refreshing."
"NICE; NOT MUST HAVE!"

"Slightly hazy yellow with an initially tall creamy head that fizzles to nothing. Spiced, tart lemon, light white wine, and a sort of mineral element in the nose.

This will be excellent for sitting poolside and at the beach this summer."

"Gose arrives at Beer Revolution here in Calgary and obviously one has to try this. Ordered using the entire name, which scrambled the server's brain (she was awesome by the way ... ""Whaaa ... Oh, the Anderson Valley! Done!""). Arrived in a pint glass, an exceedingly pale straw color like many commercial lagers with a stippling of white foam on top. Smells vinous, a white wine boozy quality, tannic and tart with some cidery apple, cellar must, and tart lemon adding to the olfactory impression. Taste was predictably sour and salty, cider vinegar or old wine, coriander husk, pedestrian wheat malt spice and lemon rind with a briny sea salt foundation. I detect some other fruit that I cannot pinpoint more specifically. Thin to medium body like many summer wheat ales and fairly aggressive carbonation. Perhaps this style is not really my bag. I find the salt overpowering here and the whole package to be vinegar sour but without any appreciable yeasty funk or other flavors to provide balance. Its compelling but maybe not something I'd drink on a regular basis. Will try another gose soon to assess variation in the style. According to ""Brewing With Wheat", traditionally gose was a fairly sour beer rather like a Berliner Weiss. This one does hit that mark."
""
""
"The taste has a tartness which is middling. Kisses of lemon and apple give the beer a solid character, and there's just a note of salt. Vague fruitness creeps into the scene. The beer is light bodied and overall refreshing. A hardcore gose lover might expect more, but as a refresher or someone looking to get into the style, this could work."
""
""
"Another one of those styles, that even when rendered properly, does little for me. Perhaps this would be refreshing on a summery patio, but why then introduce this into Alberta in the middle of our first (of many) deep freezes of the current winter season?"
"O: Clean, easy refreshing, but very pale and very light in flavor. Goes well with a meal or if you're thirsty on a hot day."
