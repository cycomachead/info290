I think this is my top two all time favorite gose after Westbrook but they're very different from each other. Westbrook is more traditional in aim and cleaner with a more watery texture. The salt in the Westbrook gose is also much more prominent which is not very traditional. This is maybe a top 10 all time favorite beer.","indesertum","Mar 22, 2015"

Poured golden with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, fruit, salt, wheat, and subtle tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, salt, earth, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. Gose, you say? Let's do this! I had heard good things about this brew so I was quite happy to see it make an appearance at our tasting. I had heard correct as this was a really well done brew in all aspects. Wish there was a little more carbonation though. The flavor and aroma were almost perfect in my opinion. All the right notes for the style and none of the drawbacks. The saltiness was there in both but it didn't pound your face into submission and leave your palate screaming for mercy which was very nice. The sour/tart note definitely helped to pull this one off. A really well done brew by Upright that I would love to have more of in the future. Thanks so much for sharing this one Morgan as it is currently my favorite from this style!","thagr81us","Aug 25, 2012"

Maybe, a little lemon but less than I expect and want in the style. The taste is similar. It tastes like their witbier with a little bit of gose blended in. There's a little bit of salt and lactic sourness, but this is a very mild version of the style. It's moderately dry, though I'd call it relatively sweet for the style. It's quite clean. Too clean, really. Mouthfeel is light and clean. Little to no pucker. Overall, it's a decent enough beer, though a touch boring.

This should definitely be drunk on the cool side (as opposed to the cold side), as it opens up quite a bit more in the 50s and 60s on the Fahrenheit scale).

The taste holds notes of light coriander, salt, wheat, very light sour malt, grass, and those good-lookin' flowers again. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, a very enjoyable li'l drink, something I wish more breweries would dabble in (especially if it turns out as well as it did here).","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2011"
4.12,4.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The appearance of this beer, not knowing much about the style, is a tad unappetizing. It pours like a cloudy champagne color and fizzes just like it too. The aroma is like tart lemons with the coriander in place with a slight sour nose, and a decent aroma of pilsner malt. The flavor is actually pretty darn good. There is a touch of funk, the slightest of saltiness, decent wheat flavor and a good deal of fizzy lemons. I didn't think I was going to like this style, but I must admit I've taken quite a shine to it. I found the sourness to be quite mild and overall the extreme fizz seemed to really help the fruity notes of the beer come through. Overall, if you're going to make an attempt at the style, there seems like no better beer to do that with then the Upright Gose.","Vdubb86","Jan 03, 2011"

4.05,2.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy light yellow color with a nice two-finger white head with a moderate amount of retention. The nose brings some nice citrus and lemon notes with a slight sourness to it. The flavor is lemon with some mild acidity and a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel is where this really shines. Good body and the salt is actually a pleasant addition rather than something I'd simply tolerate because it's part of the style. This was a high-quality brew. Thanks, Matt.","Thorpe429","Oct 25, 2010"
4.35,10.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I liked this beer considerably more than the 3 other people that shared it with me but I don't care. It is bright on the palate and creamy with a thin body but a wet finish. It is mildly salty but that accents the citric acid of this so well, even if the lactic is what wins out. The two acids are nicely complementary and the overall feel of the beer is very nice. I would definitely have it again...much better than Leipziger Gose.","drabmuh","Aug 18, 2010"
4.6,16.5,4,4,5,4,5,"D - This is a great style; it is very refreshing and way drinkable. It is just too bad that it is such a rarely seen style.","ktrillionaire","Jul 03, 2010"
3.65,-7.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Too all appearances this beer is a wheat beer but after a sip or two the salt shows up in the mouthfeel. It is an interesting beer which works well with plain food. I liked it but did find the salt was noticeable on the gums after awhile. Nice however to see this old style available in BC","canucklehead","Jun 07, 2010"
4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a very light hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is some tart wheat with some lemons, bananas and salt. The flavor is similar. I get notes of lemons, wheat and some salt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a very light, refreshing beer that goes down very easily.","Mora2000","Jun 04, 2010"

3.9,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"D: Really good ~ see the last sentence of 'mouthfeel' as to why this is so easy to drink. Perhaps a one-time release...or perhaps a repeat performance by the fine fellows at Upright. Not the best I've had but certainly fine enough to seek out and a perfect 'spring' beer (despite a January release).","msubulldog25","May 30, 2010"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"D: An interesting take on the gose. I've only had the leipziger, and this is certainly an american take on it, but it is comparable in overall quality. My wife found this a tad more flavorful and enjoyable than I did. Certainly worth seeking out if for no other reason than to experience a gose beer. + a cool label to boot.","callmemickey","May 19, 2010"
4.32,9.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I quite enjoyed this beer and was left wondering why more brewers don't attempt the style. Refreshing and light, interesting and flavorful. I could easily see myself drinking this regularly in the summer. Love that light pinch as the tartness hits the mouth!","ritzkiss","Apr 28, 2010"
4.79,21.3,3.5,4.5,5,5,5,"I am guessing this is not quite like a typical Gose as it seems more Belgian than German. Salt comes through very nicely and makes the body creamy and full. Lacto plays tricks with the salt and comes across as less sour than it might normally. Coriander is there as is some wheat tang - it is kinda like a wit-saison-berlinerweissbier. Nice, but not as tart as I thought it would be. I believe this probably used a saison yeast as opposed to a more traditional German varietal. Still, I am loving this beer and would buy this again in a heartbeat, for sure. A wonderful drinking experience. Thanks again, Frank!","twiggamortis420","Apr 22, 2010"

4.3,8.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer is light bodied with a lower moderate level of carbonation. I think an increased level of carbonation would make this more enjoyable, but in its current form it's damn drinkable and refreshing. The 750ml was depleted with no great effort. I look forward to trying more Upright offerings in the future.","HopHead84","0"
4.32,9.4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,5,"D- A perfect example of a summertime thirst quencher. Right up there with berliner weisse, witbier, etc. They should make this by the gallon; I just wish it wasn't 20 degrees out right now.","Pecorasc","Beers"
