"Overall, this is a really nice, very well done Gose.  The beer appeared a nice, clear, yellow color with a nice big white head that fell into a nice thin cap that lasted throughout the beer.  The beer gave off a light, sour-ish aroma.  The taste was very good, and not overly sour, but enough to be very solid.  The beer had a lighter feel; it was very easy to drink and had good carbonation.  Given the ABV, this is a beer that I could drink all day long, and would if were on tap near where I live."

"Taste is incredible. Yes, it's a salt beer. The salt actually evens out the lactic acid pretty well, and while still getting a sour taste it isn't the palate ruiner some sours can be. I could drink pint after pint of this, particularly at the low ABV."

"Overall, a good session beer, something that could be sipped after work outside, or while sitting outside during a warm late summer or early fall afternoon. I would have it again, particularly on a warm afternoon."

"O: A delightful gose. Could be more complex, but it's flavorful and refreshing."

"The beer looks gorgeous. Light yellow, dense, white head, excellent lacing, all hallmarks of a good beer. The nose, OTOH, is awful. It smells like the material used in diapers to soak up pee, and slightly used to boot. I get no salt, no coriander, no funk. The palate is also just way, way off. Downright terrible, this also does taste like a peed-in diaper. Light in body and moderately carbonated, I guess the feel is decent for the style, but boy, is this gross. Four of us couldn't finish a 4oz pour."

"Tried side by side with the new gose from Flying Dog and, well, this beer didn't fare well by comparison."
