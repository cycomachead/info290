"A seemingly odd combination of rauchbier and Berliner Weisse, but it works fairly well. Tart and smokey elements mix together well thanks to a restrained use of smoked grains. Time for other brewers to revive this old style brew."

"O:interesting smoked weisse beer, okay and I would drink more but seek out as must have, complex flavor and aroma brings enjoyment when rating this beer."

"Bottle at Redlight Redlight. Pours a slightly hazy pale orange with a good amount of tight, white head that held about 30 seconds before fading into a thin collar. Good lacing. A weird kind of funk to the aroma of this beer, almost like a spoiled cheese. I also get some orangey citrus and dry grass. Taste is very similar. The citrus up front, the grass in the middle, and the bleu cheese funk throughout. Nice carbonation, medium to high; and a nice medium-light body."
"Mouth mild creamy med bod, nice fluffy carb."
"Poured from the bottle into a hefe glass. Looks like a normal wheat beer. Aroma is light and not as smoky as expected. The flavor though is very unique. The sourness hits your first, then the smokiness lingers on your palate after you swallow. Very smooth and clean beer. Really enjoyed this one. I love the intermingling of smoke and sour. One of my new favorite styles."

"Pours from the bottle cloudy grainy hazy golden with a one finger white head. Aroma is weird! Smokey wheat and spice, yeast funk. Flavor is fruited smoked bacon, apple, hint of yeast and spice. A smoked brew for sure. Light medium body with plenty of carbonation. Lingering smoke. This is weird. Not bad, but a strange combo of light weisse and dark smoke."

"I think my love affair with smoked beers is increasing, but it's definitely not the most practical option if it's something I want to sip on for a good long while. On the other hand, I'm so glad to finally try a much better take on a Grodziskie, and this would pair marvelously with food. Really good stuff, but not as drinkable as I'd like it to be. Fans of smoked beers must try this one."

"Cloudy yellow, very little head and light carbonation. Unexpected smokiness on such a light beer. Smoke and wheat dominate, along with funk. Not much on the nose. I like the flavors, but I am not particularly fond of the way it coats my tongue. Mild, but long lingering aftertaste."

"The flavor is lightly smoked, with a wheaty smoothness. The tartness is dialed down--not a Berliner weiss sort of tartness, with a sweetness on the finish. Light, refreshing, with that great whisper of smoke keeping it interesting."

"O: A well made, easy to like, drinkable beer."

"Overall: This is a really interesting beer, I never expected a sour rauchbier to work, but oddly this one does. One I will certainly have again."
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate to light level of carbonation. The smoke verse tart lemony quality certainly makes for an interesting experience, however I thoroughly enjoyed it. The alcohol is seemingly nonexistent and it is an easy drinking brew. For someone who likes both smoked brews and berliner weisse, this really was enjoyable with a pleasant balance. I wouldn't change anything about this brew except for maybe it's availability. I would love to be able to have this again without having to bother someone from Germany to send me some!"
"D - I love Berliners, and this is quite a good one. Though the 'Smoked Berliner' concept sounded crazy, it has only a modicum of smoke character."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is through the roof on this one. Overall, a great berliner, and one that I could crush on a hot summer day. Skal."
"The initial lemony sourness never gets overpowering and is quickly replaced by unobtrusive smoked malt flavor. I couldn't tell whether the sourness was derived from usage of lactobacteria or simply by mixing the malt with hot water and sustaining the temperature long enough to allow the lemony sourness to develope from yeast action, but the individual flavors are clean and easily pinpointed at. The smoky character is of burnt wood without heavy, fleshy flavors of bacon or fat. Light bodied with low carbonation and refreshing with excellent drinkability. Abraxas is a a kind of hybrid between Berliener weisse and Rauchbier, successfully seeking balance between smoke and sour."
"Overall, reminded me of a cross between a berliner weisse (25%) and an apple cider beer (75%). Definitely hits the spot on this warm, spring evening. My only gripe is that it could have used a lot more carbonation. Definitely a solid session beer."
"The 3.8% ABV was a shock, felt a lot stronger and fuller than that, very drinkable."
