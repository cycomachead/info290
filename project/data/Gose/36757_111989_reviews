"Aroma is coriander/spices, lactic acid and a hint of wheat. The flavor is lemons, fruit, salt/minerals, wheat and a tart/slightly sour finish."

"I know it might be a silly thing to say, but man is this sour. I mean, too tart really. It just attacks the mouth like a sour candy that never relents. Just too much. No balance. Not digging it."

"O - Not only is Destihl's Wild Sour series exciting as some of the first sour beers in cans, but also because they're so readily available. What's even more exciting is that Here Gose Nothin' also happens to be damn good. Quite a bit more sour than a traditional gose, this iteration keeps it's flavor profile in line with some of the German classics for a delicious and crushable sour beer!"

"On tap for ""Sour Night"" at The Brew Kettle in Strongsville, Ohio during Cleveland Beer Week 2014.  My first gose, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It reminded me of a Berliner Weisse in terms of tartness, but with the wheat character and chewiness of a wit beer or light wheat beer thrown in.  Very light, clean and refreshing."

"Aroma was heavy on the coriander, taste was similar, with an herbal bitterness and tea-like impression due to the heavy handed coriander addition. Also hot dogs. Tart lemon, lactobacillus. This wasn't very drinkable to me. Gose is something you can quaff liters of, and this ain't that."
