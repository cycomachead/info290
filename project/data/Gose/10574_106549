3.92,-5.3,,,,,,"Bottle. Pours a opaque, golden color. Minimal head. The color is interesting, as is the aroma. It smells slightly cheesy with some unripe fruits. Lemon aroma as well. Reminds me of kiwis, too. The flavor is sharp and bright. Tart fruit flesh, lemons, rhubarb, kiwi. Mostly dry. Funky with a bit of cheese rind. Salinity is minimal. Barnyard flavors. Cider similarities. Salt actually starts to sneak up on me the more I enjoy this brew. Light bodied. Surprisingly high carbonation. Savory yet crisp. Dry. Very interesting. Very rustic and fruity. A tasty, unique Gose.","VelvetExtract","Nov 03, 2014"

While the ale effortlessly strips the palate of all thirst and leaves it refreshed, an aftertaste of musty cork and light bread keeps the palate rewarded both deep and quick.","BEERchitect","Oct 19, 2014"

Highly drinkable, refreshing, complex, and rivals even several high quality German Rieslings I've had to date. Do everything possible to try this - it's delicious, complex, and extremely easy to drink - a new staple for the style if I ever saw one.","magictacosinus","0"
