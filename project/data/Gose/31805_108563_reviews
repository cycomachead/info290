"Overall: Delicious. One of the best sours I’ve ever had. Would love to try more Funky Buddha now, having had this. Just fantastic."

"Funky Buddha makes a number of outstanding, fruit-infused sour beers, and this one is perhaps my favorite. I really wish I had easy access to this amazingly tasty and refreshing warm weather treat."

"Not super familiar with goses, but this one is salty as hell and I like it. Pale straw color, no head. The smell is all passionfruit and berry delight. It's awesome. Taste is all salt up front, berries in the middle and finishes tartly crisp. On the drier side, really wants you to take another sip. Overall, I could see myself drinking a shit load of this in the summer. If you can't find this anywhere and want to get a taste of it, try a Chobani Passionfruit Greet Yogurt. Basically the same taste, but with salt."

"Super refreshing and ridiculously fruit forward. The best gose I’ve had. Funky Buddha aromatically is the best brewery in the world."

"O- This was a very interesting beer that was quite interesting to try. The standard gose qualities definitely made their presence known and the fruit presence balanced nicely adding a nice complexity especially on the nose. Glad I got to try this, at 150 bottles its not going to be easy to land though."
"Overall - Quite refreshing and flavorful. I was afraid it would taste like a Buddha berliner, but it has avoided the pitfalls from which they suffer."
