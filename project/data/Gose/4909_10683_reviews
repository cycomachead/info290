"A pleasantly tart, sour, and wheaty beer."
""
""
""
"decent session beer that pairs well with curry."
"Intriguing beer.  Purchased in MA as imported from the former DDR - now Germany.  Well worth a try!  Would probably fit in as a thirst quencher in the summer!"

"Pours an opaque deep straw producing barely 1.5 fingers of  shortlived, foamy, white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma has a low but nice wheat profile & I detect what I would call pilsner malts. It is crisp, clean & dry with hints of tart fruit & brine (which the brewery says should be be below what humans can distinguish as salt). Taste opens with  lactic acid sourness, wheat & a hint of coriander & finishes peppery, clean, crisp, dry with faint salinity (again) & tart fruit. Aftertaste is salty wheat, coriander with briney lemon, lime & tart green apple. Easier to drink than the American versions I have tried due to less lactic acid sourness & salt. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation that rapidly dissipates as the brew warms, lightly astringent, prickly & dry."

"Pours a straw yellow with lively looking carbonation, small head and minimal lace. Aroma first hits you with salty tones but becomes more malty as it warms. I dug the taste; not too salty or sour, hint of lemon and enough of a malty backbone to make it drinkable. Good feel; light and refreshing. Great for a hot day. The first time I tried Gose I poured it down the drain. This one, my 2nd one, I liked. Either it is becoming an acquired taste or I simply like this one better."

"Overall: Really enjoyed this. Makes me want to try more of the style. Five bucks per bottle is a little steep, but I'd surely have it again."

"Overall: I was interested in trying this one. I am thankful I just bought the one. It does not have a date on the bottle so I have no idea how old it is, but I doubt the store I purchased it from would allow it to stay very long considering its a low abv. beer. Would I buy this again, probably not considering there are others that are much better, to me anyway.  Pretty boring beer for the price."
""
""
""
""
"Light, refreshing, citrusy. Not too much salt or sourness. Westbrook Gose, this is not. Much more traditional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a great beer. I wasn't getting a whole lot of wheat flavor our sourness from the beer, but it was very enjoyable. It's a nice light drink that could be enjoyed with about anything. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried a Gose (and those who have) who enjoy coriander spiced witbiers. I would buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"I'm a fan.  Not to many true German Gose's available, and this seems to fit the bill from the handful of others I have had.  It is soft and subtle, but really enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O- Very interesting flavors come together here. Very delicious."
""
""
"Pours out a hazy gold.  White head.  Smells of crackery wheat and bright coriander.  Taste is crisp, acidic, citric with fruitiness from the coriander.  Salt is very delicate.  Much more subtle than US versions.  Mouthfeel is smooth with mild prickling carbonation.  Awesome beer.  Wish this were in 6 packs."

"O: A classic brew. I’ve been drinking Westbrook’s version of this which is much more sour. This is really good, and presumably more traditional being from Germany and done to style. Unique, balanced, fruity, salty and sour, its nice on a warm night at Table Rock Lake, MO. Drank Aug. 6th, 2014."

"Of all the readily available examples of gose where I live, this is one of my favorites. I have had better ones while in Germany, but I cannot seem to find those here. This is a very typical gose and thus a good starter for those unfamiliar with this complex and challenging style. It may just be me, but I feel that the American Wild Ale sub-style has as much, if not more, in common with a German Gose (and Berliner Weiss, for that matter) as it does with Flemish style red and brown sours."
"Overall - I enjoyed this one, but given the choice, I would probably choose a Westbrook Gose."

"A very good example of the style – the murky appearance and lumps are somewhat off-putting, but the salty refreshingness is well worth it. Close your eyes."

"Overall: Pretty disappointed in this one. An odd aroma and weak flavor profile make this one I won't likely revisit.. Maybe this was a bad/old bottle, but without knowing for sure, I'd have to recommend avoiding this one."

"Tasty but I was a bit thrown off by the milk and butter hints I was getting. For me, it stopped it from being great. Still, I found it good."
""
"Overall: Fantastic beer, a style that I usually get when I find it because it is so hard to find! Enjoyed it immensely."
""
"This is an excellent specialty beer from the Saxon area of Germany. It pours burnt orange, cloudy, medium white head that dissipates rapidly, there is decent carbonation and some lacings. It has myriad of taste that comingle in the mouth, these include lactic, floral, grains, fruits, and wheat. It has no bite or edge, foes down easy, but is pretty filling."
""
""
""
"Picked this up at the Fridge in Lancaster PA. Split it with me beer guru. Great beer, not as good as Lost Nation but very good. So easy to drink and had me hurrying to the next drink. The only complaint would be the smell which I did not enjoy. really hope that I can find this again."

"Presented in a tulip with a hazy gold color and 2 fingers of white head that retained well. Smelling it, I got a big clean springtime flower garden scent with sweet lemon candy, rock salt, and white pepper. It has a light wheat taste with a pop of tanginess and rose petal up front. There's a good evolution in the mouth: the saltiness shows up but is kept in check, then it finishes sour. Feels light but silky and effervescent in the mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is the first beer I have tried in this style and I find it very enjoyable. This is a very easy drinking beer. I can't wait to have more!"
""
"First Gose for me. Expected more coriander. Appearance looked like a standard lager but very little head, no lace. Decent golden color with a lot of carbonation action. As mentioned didn't pick up any coriander in the aroma (and taste). The salt was not noticeable in the flavor but found in the aftertaste. Similar to the salt-flavor-aftertaste you get after sipping a margarita. The mouthfeel was originally very lively but I didn't pound the beer and after sitting 10 min or so, it quickly came across almost flat. It was refreshing at first, then became more interesting than sessionable. I don't have any other Gose reference so I attempted to be fair in evaluating."

"Overall, I've not had many of the Gose style--this would be my fourth ever, and the first that is from the country where the style originated. I've read that the style in Germany can be extremely sour, almost like a Gueuze, and this one was certainly not that. But I definitely appreciate the subtle complexity that is going on here. I'm of the opinion that this is the best in style (from a style that I've admittedly had limited exposure to). I can see myself buying bottles of this in the future to have in the summer."
""
""
"First time trying this style and I like it. Different and definitely something that would be thirst quenching come summertime."
""
"O: a refreshing pour that I would enjoy during warmer months. Pricey, but worth it over any of the others similar. Glad for the recommendation of a fellow customer."

"The beer pours a relatively cloudy golden orange with a thin halo of white head around the perimeter. The nose is definitely light and sweet, spice forward with a touch of saline and funk lingering in the background (accented when warmed). A dull coriander is present in the taste, but it's more difficult to detect comparatively. There is definitely more grain sweetness as well. However, no flavor is particularly overpowering and all blend nicely. The beer's mouthfeel is slightly tart, semi-sweet, spicy, light bodied and effervescent, with minimal funk or booze. This is a very easy drinking gose, but out of my price range for a repeat."

"looks light golden with a soft head. the smell is slightly sour with hints of spices like coriander of course. tastes both sour and salty with clear citrus aroma. a light body with soft carbonation makes it very drinkable. unfortunately this Gose has almost no aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing like I'm used to in the regards to Gose. Westbrook has perfected it in my opinion. This wasn't bad, but not great compared to what I've had. This could have been a bit old, as it was sitting in the cooler at my local haunt for several months. May revisit this with a fresh bottle."
"(O)- I have not had alot of experience with Gose yet, but I am thoroughly enjoying this one! I am really surprised this does not have a higher rating on this site. It is beautifully balanced and thrist quenchingly crisp. The perfect summertime beer."

"not a mindblowing beer. my first gose, i'd imagine it's a good beginner."
"It's light-bodied and refreshing, lightly crisp and almost fluffy."
"This was my first gose, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but if this is what they are supposed to taste like, all I can say is that it's very interesting and very different from any other style of beer I've tried, but it won't be a favorite style of mine."

"Overall not bad, I think it's lost something from when it was in Germany, as most of the beers I've had here and while in Germany. It's decent, but I want to try it super fresh sometime. Seems like it's not quite the same beer it should be."

"This is my first Gose and I have been looking forward to this moment for some time. This beer does not disappoint at all. If this style would be more often available, I would say goodbye to often disappointing witbier as a summer treat. Thank you, In de wilde man!"
"Had this beer at the brewery in leipzig. It was awesome. Definately something different. A great regional specialty. Having a tough time finding it in the US. Well worth a taste if you havent tried it before. Taste was awesome. Very refreshing. Bought a large bottle at the brewery. Excellent bottled as well."
""
"330 ml bottle. Pours hazy-golden with tall, long lasting, white head. Aroma is of wheat malt, spices and some hops. Body is full and smooth. Wheat malt, salt, spices, funky yeast, some sourness and tartness combine on the palate. Finish is long, salty and tart. Nice refreshing brew."
""
""
""
"O: an excellent refreshing beer and my first review of this style"
""
""
"Taste of crackery grain along with a dose of lemon and honey. Saltiness reveals itself a bit on the close yet more so as a lingering aftertaste which interplays with or gets confused with the lactic factor. Slightly sweet on the finish yet not overly so by any means. Feel is light and slightly salty with a light carbonation. Overall a pleasant experience yet not one to go out of the way for. Slightly sour, slightly sweet, slightly salty and slightly bitter. In that sense it covers it all."
""
"More thanks go to Cameron (TheBishopco) for providing this from my want list!"

"This is my second Gose beer experience, and I have to start by saying this is the far better of the two, being an authentic German brew. Leipziger Gose pours a clear gold, with a very fizzy 1""+ sized head. I am not finding lace on the glass once drank, however. The aroma is similar to a European Pils style, but a bit grainier, with the coriander and citrus scents noticeable as well. The taste is much like the aroma, but more full-flavored than one might expect. What's nice is that there's a bit of yeasty funk and sour apple hints in the mix. The salt, a signature of the style, is present, but very subtle, almost giving it a seltzer like mouth feel. This light beer finishes with an extremely crisp bitterness. Overall my recommendation mirrors my overall methods of trying a new style: try the original imports first before the local attempts."
""
""
"While a refreshing beer and quite sessionable, it falls a bit short of a summer quencher"
""
"O- Really easy drinking beer, well made, I like the balance and slight sourness. Not overwhelmingly flavorful, but this is the right beer in certain circumstances, namely in warmer weather, paired with some nice cheeses."
"This beer kind of grows on you, but its saltiness is just a little too much. Interesting to say the least. Glad I tried it, but a little too odd for my liking. A little less orange juicy, a little less salty, and it might be a solid beer. But who knows, maybe I'll grow to like this like sours?"
"O- For the first real example of the style, it makes me intrigued with what else is part of this. Tasty, salty and so very tight in feel."
""
""
""
"Definitely a different tasting beer, and probably the first gose beer I've had. Sour and citric taste (lemon and lime) that has a mild soapy aftertaste; not unpleasant per se, but different. Reminds me somewhat of a smoother hefeweizen but with a definite coriander (or cilantro) character. I'll definitely explore some more offerings in this style even if it wouldn't be near the top of my list in beer styles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Kind of a boring style overall, but I see why it has caught on. It's definitely for those who are turned off by the Belgian funk, yet still was somewhat of that taste profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: all in all, this is very good - refreshing as hell - it comes across as a hefeweizen with spicing and a pronounced citric (or is it lactic?) acidity - the yeast profile has a familiarity to it...."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy hay color gose with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of seas alt with coriander is really nice with light lemony notes also discernable. Taste is a very good balanced mix between a solid malt backbone with great notes of sea salt and lemony finish with light Brett notes. Body is quite full with great carbonation. Well balanced gose and kind of what I had in mind for the style even thought I don’t often have the chance to taste it."
"This pours a golden amber color with lots of bubbles from yeast constantly causing carbon to rise to the top. The aroma has yeast to it giving it that freshly baked bread scent with coriander in the mix. The texture is uniquely thin as I suspect from all the carbonation. With lots of spices in the taste making this an easy, light drinking beer with an overall citrusy quality. This is certainly a different style of beer making, but not one of my favorites."
"Could use a bit more carbonation."
"Fans of saison and wit styles would love this beer. Very interesting, I would definitely try more in the style."
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't have a lot of experience with Goses, but this was a really tasty, interesting beer, I'd happily drink this more regularly."
"Overall, I have been seeking this beer out for awhile but was a little underwhelmed. It is slightly different from a typical wheat beer but not too much so. Worth trying as it is a unique style but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
""
""
""
""
""
"an interesting article. pours hazy pale yellow with a lazy white head. the nose is heavy on the wheat malt, and the corriander seed is more prominent than the salt. almost herbal, or indian, rather than german. flavor is good, salt is much less than the other gose versions ive had, just subtle in the finish. the corriander and the wheat are the most dominant flavors. its spicy and yeasty and refreshing and drinkable. i dont love it, think it could use a little more body and perhaps even some more hops. an american gose, all hoppy and salty might be an interesting beer. who knows, for now, this is pretty tasty and affordable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Not what I was expecting, but very nice. The fruit flavours go well."
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is light with a faint sourness, again there is that citrus similar to the aroma. Tart, pleasing beer berry refreshing taste and easily enjoyed during the summer months. The finish is clean with no real after taste. Highly recommendable beer."
""
""
""
"I've only had a couple examples of gose and this one seems decent (and consistent). By no means would I pay for it again, but the bottle is totally worth the novelty value."
""
"This beer pours a clear, bubbly yellow with 1/2 inch head and no lace. The aroma is lemony with some wheat and hay. The flavor is mainly white grapes with very mild sweet malt and mile hoppiness. It becomes more champagne-like as it warms. It's mouthfeel is light medium and slightly dry. Gasthaus Leipziger Gose is a good beer, similar but not as tart as champagne. Recommended."
"This was an interesting experience. I feel that this will make me better in my beer reviews. I recommend this to grow your pallatte and beer understanding."
""
""
"This beer that is brewed in Germany has an appearance that is light yellowish-orange. There is a bit of carbonation which results in a fine head. While the aroma is of sweet malt there are hints of coriander and lemom. A light, easy drinking beer, it's something different!"
""
""
"overall; a very interesting drink not bad at all, like a Witbier and Berliner Weisse blend."
""
""
""
"O - Overall I wasnt a huge fan of this style. The flavors arent bad its just not my thing. Its is drinkable and not nearly as bad as I thought it would be but I really wont buy it again."
""
""
""
"Appearance is light orange with a short white head. This beer that I had been meaning to try for some time has a smell of straw, grain, lemon and green apples. Upon sipping this gose, I taste salt, wheat, acid, citrus, with tartness. Mouthfeel is easy going , a proper carbonation for the style. It really is a great quaffer for a warm day, albeit one that may cause you to pucker your lips."
"Poured into a Uerige stange. Pours a light yellow-orange amber. Fine white two finger head and active carbonation, resultiing in great retention and lacing. Aroma of faint sweet malt, coriander, strong mineral component, slightly sour. Flavor also has a dry, mineral component melded with light wheat, a hint of malt, slightly acidic lemon. Finishes dry with a suggestion of coriander and salt, somewhat sour. All flavors are light, but surprising amount of complexity for the low key taste components. Very light bodied, but nice carbonation. A very interesting, uncommon beer style that I'm glad I finally got to try."
"O= This beer really gets my goat. The bottle broke when I opened it leaving me worried I might be drinking some glass and the beer itself was totally uncarbonated leaving a sort of gross drying mouth to it. THe salt levels kept me interested and the flavor was unique but I'm mad I paid for this. This was my first dabble with this style and it was uncarbonated and potentially glass filled."
""
"overall - my first Gose. nice, thirst quenching."
""
""
"A pretty average gose."
""
""
"Thinnish body with good carbonation. Crisp, dry, clean, and refreshing. Not super exciting or flavorful but a nice accompaniment to pizza to be sure. Would love to try more examples of this style but they are sadly quite difficult to find. This one was certainly nothing earthshattering, enjoyable yes, but not as interesting as a good Berliner Weiss."
"Nice pale yellow shade with big fluffy white pillow as a head. Laces down nicely but the head doesn't stay as impressive as long as it might. Hazy, but not in a bad way; I'm pretty sure this is what this beer is supposed to look like. Definitely didn't turn me off with its looks by any means. Some great smells on it, lemony citrus (probably the coriander), a bit of bread, some malt and yeast. Good mix of smells that seem totally appropriate for the beer's appearance. Up until the taste point, this could be a couple different kinds of beers, but wow. Very unique flavor, citric, tart, and, yes, salty. I don't think you're supposed to taste the salt in these, but there just is no missing it. Feels very full on the mouth, stays lively with carbonation though. Overall, and absolute delight to drink. As it stands, I would only really want one, but on the other hand, I think I could totally get used to it if it was the beer that was all around my town. If you ever get the chance to try this beer and you haven't had it, I would highly recommend availing yourself of the experience."
"Would like to try straight from the source."
"As it stands though, this is a wonderful treat, and a style I hope to have more of sooner rather then later."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being high. Overall it was a very interesting and pretty good tasting beer. I thought the saltiness added a interesting and somewhat refreshing component to it. The citrus flavors worked well for it as well. I liked it."
""
""
""
""
"This is one easy drinking beer. It begs to be drank quickly the way it finishes on the palate. I wish I had a few more of these to session on the rest of the night."
""
""
""
""
"O- A good change of pace bier. Something I couldn't drink really often but pretty nice."
"This is my first gose and it has a very interesting smell right off the bat, its like seriously salty tortilla chips, then wheat and citrus. Color is bright yellow-orange and completely hazy. Flavor has a bit of salt and the back end and mostly wheat crackers up front. Quite the interesting beer but I wouldn't say its tart at all, citrus yes but not tart in the least."
"Pours a golden yellow with a medium white head. Aroma of light sweet fruity esters, some light grassy notes. Taste is a sweet and salted sourness, some yeast with some light fruity notes. Palate is medium body with light carbonation. Finish is a sweet salted sourness with some yeast and light fruity notes. Taste like it was fermented on a bed of sea salt. Surprisingly I was able to finish drinking this brew as the flavor grows on you. Overall an ok and interesting brew."
""
"O: Very refreshing and something that would be wonderful on that first warm day of spring, enjoyed outside. I really enjoyed the beer and would love to see more offerings available in this style."
"o: This wasn't bad but now I know why this isn't a more popular style."
"A very refreshing beer. Makes for a welcome alternate to the easy session beers of summer."
"An interesting beer to say the least. I wouldn't exactly say I like it, but I imagine this is what a Gose is supposed to be like. I also imagine this is perhaps why Goses are no longer in vogue. Worth trying, but I doubt I'll seek it out in the future."
"Overall quite a refreshing drink, bordering on apricot soda, and malt refreshment. Quite nice."
"Dr: I don't really know the style well (this is me first beer in the style), but the emphasis seems to be on adequate presentation of the sourness. Belgian sours sure do this better, and this feels simple in comparison. I look forward to trying more beers in the style. Its low ABV never shows, not that you'd expect it to."
""
""
"Overall: Interesting and different. Difficult to describe but it ended up being ok."
""
""
""
""
""
"My first chance to sample this style, and I was interested to see how the use of salt would work. The salt was reserved, adding more of a sharp tangyness than actual salinity. Moderately tart, with some coriander in the background. Mouthfeel was lean and wheaty. I can see this as an excellent hot-weather quencher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has to be the blandest of hazy yellows I have ever seen. A small white head sits on top. Decent retention. No lacing. The nose is a little barny, otherwise does not have too much going on. The palate is a tart-plosion to begin, followed by a blast of salt, and finishes with a solid chewy wheat body. The tart, salt, and light body makes this highly quaffable. The lacto is delicious and easy drinking. Finish is tart and dry."
"Overall a refreshing beer that loaded up on the crockery grain qualities and subtly spiced. Will be looking to try other versions of this style."
"Well, the mystery is whether this is a better than average Gose. I'm definitely on the lookout for some domestic versions of this wild style."
"Pours a fairly clear yellow colour. Lots of white head. Smells spicy and a touch yeasty. I think i can actually detect the coriander on the nose. Tastes yeasty and spicy. I thi this is more interesting than the ccb Gose but there is a light fruity characteristic that comes through that's a bit odd. Light, feels lighter than the ccb Gose. Still quite refreshing"
"O - kinda weird and a bit too sweet for me."
"O: well my first gose was definitely a positive experience, it's like a wheat beer with a tart finish, very refreshing"
"This is a very drinkable sour beer, and not unlike a German variation on Geueze."
"This is a super easy drinking brew that is tart and refreshing. A modest level of carbonation provides a nice tingle on the tongue. This is light bodied and an awesome take on the style. The alcohol is well hidden for nearly 5%. I haven't had many Gose offerings but this one is by far my favorite to date. Subtle salt addition with pleasant tartness. Very similar to the Berliner weisse style but with a bit of a twist."
"Perfect for a brisk October weekend, and a bargain at $4."
"Note: Nice and refreshing and I like that you can taste the malt. The coriander isn't my style, but it does add character. Its hard to score this since this is the only Gose I've come across."
"Taste is tart, with a mild and palatable sour and definitely a little sodium bicarbonate. Savory and complex on the palate, tart, with mild coriander spice delicately interwoven with some wheat and citrus flavors. Euro pale malt body is there somewhere. Light bodied but with stinging carbonation. Overall, one of the most complex, authentic, and amazing beers I've had of German origin. Could drink this regularly."
"O: This beer is very flavorful for its alcohol content, and tastes great on this hot day. I am newly interested in trying other beers of this style."
"O: The only other Gose I've tried is Cascade Brewing's seasonal Gose and it was excellent, although American brewed so I haven't yet been able to compare it to something traditional. I'm pleasantly surprised that Cascade's is spot on and holds up to this, if not is slightly better. I would buy this again if it were slightly more carbonated and more readily available."
"Well, it is an uncommon style at the current time, so no hurt in checking it out. If it was less pricey it could be a very popular alternative to american macro drinkers who would like something a little more."
"Grade: A-"
"Poured a 2"" white head which in moderate time had completely dissipated. Hazy light straw yellow color. Smells of hops, malt, and spice. Taste doesn't quite match the smell - there's more malt but less hops and the spicing is a very short sensation. I'd say this beer is refreshing, perfectly acceptable, and quality, but not a standout."
"This was a good, unique and fairly refreshing beer that I could certainly drink more of. Just wish the bottle was more affordable, or better yet, that there was a local brewery producing this style for summer."
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is begs to be gulped instead of sipped. The body is not heavy enough to stick around long but is not too thin to be forgettable. The carbonation fizzes away when held on the tongue and really moves this beer along. The carbonation may be a little strong, as combined with the drying salt, causes the flavors to fade rather fast."
"The pour revealed what I thought was initially going to be a Greg Koch special - a fizzy yellow beer until I caught some. unexpected lees and it turned cloudy on me. I had a finger of rocky bone-white head with very good retention in the creeping humidity this evening. Color went from a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity to a hazy orangish-yellow in just a millisecond. Depending on how clear you want your beer, a gentle pour may be in order. The nose had a pronounced peppery odor, thanks to the coriander, but I could swear that I also caught some salt spray in there. Salt & pepper - what a novel concept! Mouthfeel was full and brisk and it tasted like the lemon pepper seasoning that I like to put on fish. To say that the finish was dry would be like saying that the ""Mona Lisa"" is a painting. This was alum dry! You could pour this on electronic components in lieu of dessicant in terms of its dryness. Arid Extra Dry had nothing on how dry this beer finished. I think that I would now like to drink a beer."
"Pours a murky, hazy honey orange with a foamy 1 inch off-white head. Smell is of spices (coriander), yeast, and a slightly floral scent. Taste is slightly sour on the first sip with spice, yeast, and floral flavors. There is a slightly acidic sour taste on the tongue after each sip. A lower level of carbonation but somehow it feels bubbly and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good and interesting style of beer. I really don't get any salty flavors from this one. A very refreshing beer on a hot day."
"O: I don’t know if I enjoyed drinking extra salt, but I thought this beer was pretty good. Uniquely flavored and fairly refreshing, although I did drink a glass of water afterward."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Very pleasant feel on the palate. A bit over light bodied and a bit prickly and spritzy. Seems appropriate. Overall, I really liked this beer. Extremely refreshing and great for summer. I wish more breweries took a stab at this style."
"Overall: Nice and light, I really liked the mild tartness. I would definitely have another."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a good summer beer for any occasion."
"Upon trying this again I'm seeing this as my favorite Gose, The American versions are getting too sour in my opinion. This brew has the perfect balance of saltiness and sour. I'm amping up my numbers on this because I truly feel this is the best of it's class. Really great stuff and should definitely be tried at some point if you're enjoying this style."
"O: I expected Leipziger Gose to taste like the hypertension in a bottle that is Bruery's Salt of the Earth. Not so. Leipziger Gose acts more like a Berliner Weisse with a spicy twist. Very good drinkability and complexity. More goses, please!"
"O: Impressive beer, Looking forward to trying more of the style."
"Bravo."
"O: Interesting to say the least....glad i tried it and I would drink it again."
"O - I have never heard of this beer style up until today. I gotta say, this is really light and refreshing. I'll be picking up some more for the hotter days of summer."
"O: My first gose was a pleasant experience. This would be a great hot summer day beer."
"O: Very refreshing beer. This differs from the Dolenitzer in two ways: adding salt DURING the boil, and adding coriander. When you taste them side by side, you can tell the differences. I think a blend of the two would actually make the best of the two, but at this time, I believe the Dolenitzer takes the prize for now."
"Overall I think this beer is great; it's a perfect hot summer day beer. It's light, crisp, refreshing, and low in alcohol, yet flavorful and interesting, albeit in a total different way than a big imperial stout. I wish it was readily available in 6 packs like so many other beers that do a much worse job of trying to fill the same role."
"In case you couldn't guess, this is a drain pour."
"Body is light, and the carbonation is lively. This has a a spritziness on the tongue and a very refreshing mouthfeel. Tasting good at 4.6% ABV, this is an eminently drinkable beer."
"O: Very enjoyable, slightly tart, slightly sweet. Hope to have more Gose in the future."
"Good drinkin' beer, nice and flavoursome but it pulls back in the important areas to make it quaffable. Salt is not detectable - all the more power for it."
"A very dry but crisp and unusual beer. Surprisingly moreish."
"Damn refreshing. I could see myself drinking this until my store runs out this summer if it were cheaper."
"According to the history books, we almost lost Gose as a style shortly after WW2 - yet another reason to hate communism. This is a deliciously refreshing, notably unique and, I'm sure, widely appealing style of beer that I can't believe more breweries haven't tried to emulate. Tell your friends, tell your family, run out in the street in your underwear and start screaming - do whatever it takes to get others to try this style. I'd be surprised if they don't like it."
"O - Pretty cool and enjoyable beer. The salt is a nice breakup to sweetness. Would like to try more gose beers."
"I would drink this till the cows came home. A refreshing drink meant for summer and low alcohol for the long hall."
"Every time I'm able to get my hands on a new style, I take the opportunity to do so and here, this paid off. It lies somewhere between a Hefe and a Witbier with its spicy quality and salty feel making it a distinguishable style. I feel like I can drink this any day of the week and look forward to having more of this in the future."
"Overall, this brew has made me fall in love with this obscure German style. What better brew to do it than the one from the German town that started it all."
"O- I'm not an expert on this style but this is a great beer and as easy drinking and enjoyable as I've had in a long time."
"Overall very crisp and clean dryness I found enjoyable. An interesting one, and I'm glad I tried it. Perhaps a good accompaniment to a citrusy summer dessert?"
"This is pretty crazy beer, I've had Scott Smith's Here it Gose Again...East End brewed gose. This will be my first German brewed authentic version, pours a deep yellow orange golden cloudy color with a bright white head. Label calls it a beer brewed with coriander and salt. Fine lacing left behind between sips beautiful looking brew. Aroma at first was bit sulfurous with a brisk wind of sea salt and lemon peel citrus blends with coriander spice. Flavor is impressive, really unique great tasting beer I'm glad I finally gave this a try. Every time I had seen it before it was in a crazy shaped flip top bottle with a pretty high price tag. This 11.2 oz brown bottle for 3 something a bottle seemed much more fair for never having a real version of this stuff. Spicy coriander flows with tart lemon flavor perfect German wheat beer with a hint of salt, not salty you can more or less get the mineral aspect. Mouthfeel is light bodied super effervescent CO2 on the high end. Really interesting unique beer that I will be revisiting in the future...excellent stuff."
"Pours a hazy golden wheat with a quickly dissipating foam cap. Nose up front is wheaty, salty ocean spray, and sour lemon. Second nosing reveals more sea salt with clove and coriander - interesting stuff similar to a hefe minus the ocean. Taste is an interesting mix of sour red fruits, wheat, lemon, yeast spice. The finish reveals briny sea notes and a puckering sourness. Never had the style but this is a very unique beer that i thoroughly enjoyed and would drink more often if it was less than $5 for a 12oz bottle."
"O: I like the feeling of this and would like to try more in this style."
"Not overpowering, yet interesting. A very nicely refreshing and good tasting beer. Plus, the 4.60%abv lend it to being a good 'session' beer."
"Very unique and enjoyable."
"Lepziger Goze is as spritzy as my description of its flavor makes it seem. Active, refreshing carbonation. Medium bodied for a wheat beer. Finishes clean. Nothing to complain about. Overall impression? This is an extremely refreshing beer. I'd kill for this to be available in cheap six packs. Kill."
"O-A unique and interesting beer that everyone should try once. I could actually see drinking this pretty regularly, as it is refreshing and has a lot going on for such a light style."
"Finally my first Gose! I freaked when I saw this sitting on the shelf at a store that I hadn't been to in about three months. It poured a murky, muddied dark yellow with an orange aspect to it with a frothy one finger white head. The head dissipated within a minute or two and laced the glass. It smelled pretty salty and featured yeast, citrus, and clove like aromas. The salt hit initially then calmed down. The flavors are definitely interesting. It's primarily yeast with citrus fruits, cloves, banana, and light sodium. It has this odd effect on your tongue. The initial salt dried mine out and then it made my mouth water as the fruits hit. It reminded me of when you walk out of the ocean and you didn't get all of the salt water off of your lips. Normally I'd think that was odd but this is pretty flavorful. It drinks medium in body and is pretty smooth. It tingles the palate. I find this to be pretty drinkable. It's essentially a solid, heavier wheat beer with citrus fruits with a touch of salt. Thank god I finally got to try this style. I may have to go after some others."
"Light and refreshing, light to medium carbonation, easy to drink, and finishes dry. This would be a nice beer to have on a hot summer day."
"The CPJ"
"Vibrant carbonation and crisp with a lower medium body this beer seems like more of a summer chill out beer than anything else."
"O: Reminiscent of Berliner Weisse. Refreshing tartness. Great summer drink. One could say that it the the German Saison."
"Notes: My first gose. Interesting flavors to say the least. I liked this beer, but it isn't really my cup of tea for something I would want regularly."
"Overall, fantastic beer. Low in alcohol, flavors are not aggressive or over the top. Very easy drinking beer. Quite enjoyable. Outstanding example of the style."
"Soft carbonation with sweet citrus flavor up front followed by a spicy and earthy presence mid palate and an odd salty dry finish. Hints of lemon zest, clove, salt and slight hops."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly cloudy very light straw yellow/orange color with a fluffy white head. Very delicate aroma of lemon, grass, and orange. The taste is nice and light. Slightly sweet beginning with an underlying lemon sweetness flavor. Really no bitterness at all. I imagine this would be a great summertime beer but I guess it works in the middle of winter in MN. No lace on the glass. Not bad."
"D: This is the first Gose I've ever tried so I don't have anything to compare it to. Nevertheless, this was an enjoyable, drinkable beer."
"Off tap this beer was a cloudy, almost opaque, golden-yellow color. The head was one finger of off-white foam that retained itself stubbornly as a slim collar. The aroma was spicy and zesty with a nice fresh note of wheat. The flavors, impressed me. Straight up. I was hit first by the wheat malt and strong citrusy tang. Upon examining it further I concluded it was definitely fresh wheat malt and kumquats. Tart and orange/lemon-like. In the middle lemon appeared along with some booze and finally there was a refreshing, semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body light/med and the carbonation perfect. The citrus/wheat-twang/booze combination gave it an effect similar to lemonade. I found it highly refreshing and could no doubt see myself enjoying this greatly on a hot summer day."
"D- This one threw me for a loop but I'm seriously groovin' on it. Not sure if it's 'to style' (my guess is it is) but this is a damn fine beer. Price tag sucks but I'll buy it again, wait until the weather heats up for a nice refreshing drink."
"Do yourself a favor and try this on draft if you've only tried the bottled version, it's truly a night and day difference."
"Cloudy pale straw gold pour, a lot like a good hefe. Head builds pretty fast before disappearing, this is definitely the funkier cousin of the hefeweizen. Taste is very smooth with a nice sour kick. A miz netween the refreshing hefe and the sour Berlinner weiss. This beer is still very smooth, but the sharp sourness really makes it stick. Really need to have this on a nice summer day. This was my first try for the style, but this beer left more than a good impression. A must-try for sour lovers."
"If I can be allowed to call this beer the ambassador of the style, I would best describe Gose as a cross between a wit and Berliner Weisse. With its herbal spice and propensity towards a tart, dry mouthfeel it could be considered the Saison of Leipzig."
"This one is interesting, different, even from the other example I'd had. Tasty & fairly refreshing. May be the novelty of it, but I really enjoyed this. Not at all what I expected. Not a game-changer, but I also like the fact that I can reseal the swing-top bottle easily, save some for later."
"This is pretty good beer. Not really good - pretty good. Upon opening there was an immediate scent of caramel malt in the air. Poured with a fizzy, cream colored head that rapidly faded, lots of little bubble trails, and no lace. Color is a very slightly hazy amber. Aroma is that caramel malt, plus yeast, a little spice, fresh bread dough, fresh baked cookies. Flavor is good, not real deep, like the aroma, just tart enough, and a little salt at the end. Good body and great carbonation. Finish is of medium length although the salt lingers longer. Session beer."
"as for style its like the kristalweiss of the berliner weiss world. Has a nose like a berliner and an initial tart but the feel is crisper. And i nice lager like feel. Nose is of subtle tart lactose and apple malt. The malt carries like that of the sour apple and the mild sweet of a good german lager. Very jean feel. Fantastic and oh how i wish i could have a regular supply to have as a relaxation beer. The lack of creamy wheat malt gives a drinkablity of few sour beers."
"D- low abv tasty and complex. very drinkable"
"Drinkability: as I said, this is quite tasty and refreshing. The tartness isn't overdone and it makes the overall experience extremely enjoyable."
"As much as I love every other beer style from the great nation of Germany, I think this one needs to go by the wayside."
"HV"
"Notes: I've been looking for the original for quite some time and here it is. The acidity is refreshing and the salinity adds an extra dimension of flavor. It is a great beer on a hot summer day."
"d-slug it! the salt def is a plus. i know a bunch of mexican dudes that do salt and lime with their coronas, it sort of reminds me of how that tastes, but without the corona, of course."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite refreshing. It's definitely a sessionable beer during the summer months."
"Session worthy doesn't even begin to describe how easy this beer is to take down. Another great German style that could definitely fit in well with sour beer fanatics."
"A refreshing, very balanced brew. The saltiness added another level to this beer, not only in terms of complexity, but in drinkability as well. Cool."
"This was my first Gose to date, and it exceeded my expectations. Close to Hefeweizens and Wits, but I can see where the lacto and salt can really make this style it's own. I will keep my eyes peeled for future examples."
"D= At 4.5% and with this flavor profile, this is a very drinkabke and refreshing beer."
"Pours a hazy, maize color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of wheat, slight tart malt, pale hops, citrus (lemon), slight pale malt, and hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Gose. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable tartness. Tastes of lemon, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hops, and hint of wheat. I've never had a Gose before, but this seems to fit the description pretty well."
"UPDATE: now it is available in small bottles (333 ml), we found them last week in Abe's store for 4.25 $ each. The historical bottle (750 ml content) was not seen at all. Good that we kept ours from last year!"
"I love the way the tartness and salt play off each other. The Coriander just adds an extra depth to the beer. If a beer could be brewed similar to this and released in a responsibly priced 6pk...damn! Money in the bank. Until then, this appears to be the only commercially available Gose available in a bottle in the US. For now..."
"Drinkability: A very interesting wheaty beer. This beer is incredibly subtle and soft in its flavors. I could sip on several of these and do want it again. Would be really interested to try this on tap."
"I've always wanted to try a gose...and now I have. I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to get another bottle of this, but I would not turn it down. However, I'd love to find a biergarten in Liepzig and have a few of these."
"A light bodied, low alcohol, unique refresher. Not something I'll be craving often, but unique regardless."
"The larger bottle was sold in a uniquely shaped, long-necked flip top bottle, which I understand to be the traditional Gose bottle. That said, it's unique shape is a pain to store, and would be even worse to ship in a trade. Too bad."
"D-Nice summer beer. Lots of corriander and tart lemon flavors. Could be a bit drier."
"I was expecting something more extreme, but it's crisp, refreshing and def. has sourness to it. As I drink more I can feel the sourness more. Would love this on tap at a bar."
"D: A really interesting combination of flavors here. I enjoyed it, but I don't know how much of this stuff I could drink--plus, these seem to be hard to find around here."
"Dear American craft brewers, start brewing with salt! What a great beer, and what a style I've discovered here. Now, get me another bottle!"
"Drinkability - 1 is enough for me, had to try the style. A bit too flowery, herbal and spicy for me, glad I got to try it though."
"Pours a cloudy yellow golden with a smaller white head that sticks around a while. The aroma has lemons, coriander, some saltiness, and white grapes. Appreciate how the coriander is not overpowering, which it easily can be. The flavor has white grape juice, some appreciable tartness, then the finish develops some coriander spice notes and light malts. Light bodied with a prickly refreshing carbonation. I really dig this brew, light, refreshing, fruity and tart. I would drink this often if it weren't for a prohibitive price tag!"
"Huge on the drinkability meter. This was fresh, crisp, and flowed so easily. I could go through 10 of these on a long summer afternoon."
"This is a way under-rated beer that should come in six packs and be sold on every corner."
"Felt like I could drink several of these, but decided to try something else new..."
"I look forward to drinking more of this particular beer, and other Goses in general."
"An intereting beer and after having this one example, a style that needs to be explored more. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Just a little lacing is left behind. The aroma is that of a witbier. It consists of yeasty phenols and coriander with hints of lemon and sour apples. The flavor starts with wheat malt, then it turns mildly tart, then slightly salty in the finish. The spice is not really noticed at all. The body feels a bit thin and flat. An enjoyable beer and none of the unique elements are too robust so it should not scare anyone away."
"Pours a very hazy lemon straw with a fairly thick white foamy head that disappears almost entirely after a minute or so. The smell is heavy on the lemon, with dashes of cracked pepper, salt, and very subtle hops. The taste generally follows the nose, with the coriander hiking up the lemony flavor, pushing the pepper to the back, and nearly drowning out the hops' bitterness. In the end, a general saltiness coming through on the back and sides of the tongue. This overall fruitiness and spiciness makes for a pretty distinctive tasting. That, coupled with a generously medium body and low ABV, makes for a nicely drinkable brew."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/4/4"
"Notes: Naturally, this was my first review of a Gose. I was pleased with this beer because I appreciate wheat beers when they are well-made. However, it is less amazing than the rarity of this style might lead one to believe. That said, I'd love to see more German brewers start brewing Gose beers again, as well as get some American interpretations out there. As far as rare styles go, it's rather mundane, but if Gose was a more common style, I'd choose this when I felt like a light wheat beer but not a hefeweizen."
"I think the taste is a treat--I get the salt/sea/spice/brine at the beginning, and then that gives way to a prickly sweet taste with some apple flavors and a tart wheat backbone, with a bit of the brine and salt again in the finish. The mouthfeel is light, smooth, and bright. Truly a one-of-a-kind beer, I would consider moving to Leipzig just so I could have this all the time."
"D: In the summertime this would be the perfect solution to a hot day. Crisp, refreshing, lots of lemon....this must be what widmer is always trying to attain....lol"
"D- This is a very enjoyable and drinkable beer. I would purchase it again if it wasn't so expensive."
"D- this one was different for sure. not sure i would order this again, but i couldnt pass up a style i have never tried before."
"As the beer warms, I finally taste the salt, don't think it really adds much to the taste. If this is true to style, the Gose is not my cup of tea."
"D-Excessively so! Tons of flavour with a very interesting salty spiciness. All of this with a low ABV--glad to see this rare style rescued from the beer graveyard! Nice stuff for sure!"
"First time every having this beer and hopefully I can try more this style."
"It is a light beverage, and as such, is fairly easy to drink (for a sour anyway). Unfortunately, there just isn't much more to it than that."
"Cloudy golden yellow color with a decent sized white head that fell quickly with no lacing. Predominate aroma is orange followed by wheat and a light acidity. Flavor is very interesting and unique. This is my first Gose, so I didn't know what to completely expect, but I'm actually digging the light saltiness in the background. Flavor lightly tart, but it's not on the same level as a Berliner Weiss, there plenty of coriander it's followed by a crisp wheat twang and some more citrus qualities that were present in the nose. Very orangey, and I like it. Crisp, light body, refreshing. Interesting stuff. Doesn't taste a whole lot different than other German wheats, except the addition of salt, which really isn't overly-present. But it was pretty good, and I'm glad I had the chance to try this style."
"My first gose, I really enjoyed this beer and am looking forward to finding some more. I never thought that I would enjoy a beer with salt in the taste, go figure."
"D: I'd never had one of these before, but I had a bit of an idea going in what this would be like. The tart sourness is actually quite refreshing. The low ABV makes it an easy drinker."
"d - fairly drinkable in that its easy on the palate and alcohol is not an issue, the spice and saltiness of the finish gets a little old for me"
"D: So So, not my favorite of styles."
"Pours a bright, see through, yellow color with medium sized fluffy snow white head. Big wheat aroma in the nose, sans the clovey/fruity esters given off by most Weizens and Wits, this is more rugged in its wheat profile, more grainy in aroma. An apple juice sweetness lay beneath its flavor, very crisp and refreshing, lightly spicy and a mild tangy sourness hits the tongue late on the finish. Very drinkable, an enjoyable pounder any time but this one would be sure thing come mid summer. The only ive had in the style and would like to try more."
"Interesting flavors. Low in alcohol and yet, surprisingly refreshing. I would like to see other examples of this style."
"The flavor profile is not one that I personally love, but the balance, nuance, and boldness of flavor in such a small beer is astounding. Not just a curiousity, this brew delivers the goods."
"Classic example of a weizen, very drinkable, to be sought after."
"D: Quite drinkable--this is light and fairly low in alcohol, and the uniqueness of the beer keeps me wanting another sip."
"D: very drinkable and a great summer beer"
"Quite a unique brew, which I think would be very decent without the salt, but is intriguing for its inclusion. Its a hard to find style, but if you can come across one I'd recommend the purchase. Just drink a big ol' glass of water afterwards!"
"Poured from the cool long neck swing-top bottle into my Gaffel Kölsch glass. Leipziger appears a mildly cloudy pale straw yellow color with a good inch of fluffy bone white head. Nice, lingering foam, leaving some spotty lace in its wake as I sip my way to the bottom of the glass. Nose and flavors consist of citrus notes such as tart lemon peel and zest, salt, light toasted wheat, saltine crackers, coriander, spicy yeast. Light bodied and quite effervescent. Very quenching. I could see this paired with a variety of foods. I'm thinking crackers topped with boneless/skinless sardines packed in olive oil with a squeeze of fresh lemon."
"Overall this is a very good beer. The price tag would keep it off my casual drinking list. Will buy again for a special occasion."
"It was better than I was expecting as I am not a fan of sour wheat beers, but this one is not as offensive as most and was decently enjoyable, a small glass is satisfying for me, maybe not the most drinkable brew."
"NOTE: This was sampled at Max's in Baltimore. They had three kegs available, and my sample was taken from keg #3 of 3. I have been told that each keg has tasted differently- which makes my review somewhat less relevant to the overall assessment of this beer. It seems that someone can easily get a 'good' glass of this beer, and next door someone might get a 'bad' glass..."
"Mildly hazy yellow-orange with a thin white head. Retention is decent, and there's patchy lace too. On the nose, this is fabulous. Savory with salt and coriander, coupled with a mild tartness, this is just so refreshing! Fresh cut cilantro comes to mind as I drink this light bodied beer. Mildly tart with a combination of lemony and lactic sourness. The tartness really opens to palate to the combination of the salt and coriander, this works wonderfully! Mildly wheaty/bready, this is excellent. Dry and mildly tart on the finish, this is an exceptionally drinkable and refreshing beer."
"Nothing spectacular here, but still, this is a very easy to drink and appreciate beer... the sort of thing one could easily drink all day without doing too much harm. Nice."
"Overall, it went down ok, but it wasn't something I really overly enjoyed either. Just ok. A little too watery, a little too salty/tart, and just not enough to make me chase this one again."
"Tap @ Hamiltons. First gose I've had. Poured a hazy, but bright yellow-gold with a fizzy yellow head. Lots of tiny bubbles in the carbonation. Floral aroma, as in, I smell rose bushes. Toasted bread, lemon, and wheat. Popping mouthfeel that enhances the acididy of the beer. Sweet, spiced flavor with a lot of acidity. Tangy wheat and a strange lime/yeast/flower petal taste. Dry crisp finish. It was nice, just impossible to pin down what it was. Interesting, and a good sour."
"D: OK, I would probably not have more than 1 of these in a sitting but it was easy to drink that one."
"This beer is light yellow and clear. It pours with a serious head but it falls away to almost nothing really quick. There is steady carbonation, small bubbles. I'm drinking this out of a Radeberger pilsner flute, the best vessel I could find. The smell is interesting. Spice, I can't quite put my finger on it, corridander maybe. The taste, its amazing, lactic sourness, sweetness, spice comes through. This beer is so refreshing. My wife loves it as well. Its a great drink, all around. Well done. Why are you still reading? Go get it!"
"A nicely refreshing, and surprisingly sour fruity beer. Right up my alley."
"D - An extremely unique and refreshing beer that is very drinkable. The aroma is spectacular, it smells like oil squeezed out of a fresh lemon peel, though the flavor is not quite as good. This one is a must try if you come across it and the style is deserving of the revival is it experiencing."
"D: Light yet complex. Nice intro to sours, but not much heavier in flavor than a diet lemony water drink."
"On tap, served in a pilsner glass. Hazy gold color, thick white head, tiny bit of lacing. Aroma of wheat and citrus. Very tart lemon taste, some malt. Well-balanced. The beer had a real piquancy to it, and was very refreshing on a hot summer day. Will have it again."
"D: This is one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had. Goes down smooth, and doesn't feel like much, I'm sad I can't get this more readily, because after a long hot day, this would be prime-time. Excellent beer, highly recommended."
"What a revelationj this beer is on-tap. I'd had it a couple of times in the bottle before, and while I thought it was interesting and pretty good, it didn't really grab me as a style or a beer. Once I had it on tap this summer at the Brick Store Pub, I just couldn't stop drinking it. It seems that at least every other time I would go to the pub I would order one of these, and it just kept getting better and better, particularly if it were hot outside. The bottles are also quite expensive, so this is relatively a much better deal. So refreshing, and the touch of salt an loads of coriander eventually made it addictive for me. Something just seemed to click with this beer on draft. Pours a super carbonated pale yellow with a very white fluffy head. Smells very slightly sour, with a hint of lemon and green apple and spicy with fresh wheat and you can smell a slight salty tang. Tastes very, very refreshing. Lots of coriander and some crisp wheat up front, and then the salty tang is quite noticeable against a background of light citrusy sourness and tannic, salty bitterness. This part of the beer is reminiscent of a salting crabapples that I remember doing as a child in the south. The salt, corander, citrus, and bitterness fronted by the spicy wheat just works- some type of alchemy is surely at work here. Thirst quenching in the mouth, with the slightest bit of prickliness, and perfectly refreshing. My new favorite summer beer."
"Overall this is a tasty beverage. This is my first gose and was fairly impressed. Worth a shot."
"So refreshing, but I was hoping for a deeper flavor profile. Not bad. But I'd rather go with a Berlinner Weisse or hefeweizen."
"Drank on tap at Brauhaus Schmitz. Pours a glowing yellow color with small white head, looks like a glass of sunshine and smells of a sweet, citrus lemongrass. Intial taste of slight honey and corriander, then a solid lemon flavor, not too overpowering though. Great summer beer, not too heavy, could drink all day under the hot sun."
"D: Rather drinkable. Not sure if I'd session this, because I like beers with a bit more flavor. Still, a solid brew."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy, golden color with a two finger white sudsy head to it. Head recedes rather quickly, not much lacing to speak of - spots here and there. Nose is of lemons, some saltiness, yeasts, some heavy spicing. Taste ... is a LOT more mellow than I expected. I had only ever tasted a Gose before at a tasting and I wanted to rip my tongue out. This is pretty damn good. Taste is very lemony and yeasty up front, but the coriander kicks in quite nicely and not overdone, sour kicks in during the finish. Light to medium bodied - taste makes it feel heavier though it's light on the tongue, medium carbonation, slick and oily feel to it. It goes down very smooth, and is hitting the spot on this warm and muggy night. Not sure I could put away more than two of these but a nice beer none-the-less."
"this brew pours up a clear gold color with a big white fizzy head. the nose is pretty faint, light fruits, faint malts. the taste is salty, lemons, faint malts, easy drinking and refreshing. light bodied, low carbo. Would make a good sessioner. ""I can finally afford a young crazy stripper wife!"""
"On a whim, picked up a bottle at the Wine Gallery Boston for $4.99. I've only had a gose once, and it was years ago. Poured into a short stange glass. Very cloudy yellow body. Bubbly white head, but a noticeable lack of carbonation bubbles. Slight lacing on the glass. Smelled a bit peppery, lemony, and grassy. Taste was smoother than I would have though. Had a very wheat-like flavor, and definitely some spice like coriander. I didn't really notice the salt until after the swallow. Makes your palate feel dry like you just ate some pretzels. A dry, doughy aftertaste. It's a very smooth beer due to the low abv, and fairly easy to drink. While not abundantly flavorful, I could drink a few of these. It's bottle conditioned, so watch out for the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. A nice (re)introduction to an obscure style."
"Who would think that all those things together coulc be so good."
"A crisp, light-medium bodied, easy drinking wheat. The slightest dip in carbonation lends it a different feel, I found, in varying pours from the 750ml bottle. Very nice feel, usually and for the most part."
"I had a bottle, which I poured into a glass. I didn't decant to try and remove the yeast, I swirled the yeast just like a hefeweizen and added it to the glass. The spicy taste and the saltiness came right out when I drank the beer. I liked the taste. Very little hop bitterness. I found it easy to drink, but the saltiness might get to some folks."
"330 mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Opaque light-gold color with chunks of yeast floating around. Small, fizzy white head. Aroma is briny and tart with lemons, wheat, and bruised crabapple. Flavor is muted and refreshing. Rather wheaty with a light citric tartness, a whisper of spiced apple cider, and aspiriny coriander reminiscent of Hoegaarden. Watery and drinkable."
"I'd highly recommend this for anyone who's into Berliner Weiss or peach lambic."
"Barring its prohibitive cost, this would make a wonderful summer session ale for me."
"Again saltiness and coriander in the aftertaste. Light body."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, slight soury. The taste is pretty nice, better than I expected, malty, with some yeast, tangy, slight lemon/grapefruit. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice one, glad to have the bigger bottle of this brew still left."
"Drinkability: Well, that was weird. Dunno if this is a style/beer I could have too often, but it does seem like it would have its place and time. The abv% is low, the flavors light and fairly refreshing ... I'll give it a hesitant recommendation, especially if you're lookin' to knock out a style!"
"C: Great beer! In comparison to a traditional Kriek, this beer definitely has the balance I prefer, though this doesn't mean the Kriek is/was poor. Definitely more in line with a Berliner Weißbier. The floaties in the beer also add a cool effect to the experience and leaves no doubt to the fact that this is unfiltered and bottle conditioned! Prost!"
"M + D: Crisp, refreshing and yet it has a bit of a moderate body - not too light feeling at all. A wonderful dryness follows, and I'm always a sucker for that. An enjoyable and unique beer. I'd actively seek it out again, and it would make for a wonderful session choice."
"i don't really have any other reference point, but this was interesting and enjoyable. that said, absolutely not worth the price as a regular drinking beer. since this is probably the only one you can ever get your hands on in the states, try it once just to check this off your list of beer styles and move on..."
"Great session brew alternative. It's like a Saison Light."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body. Smoothness from the wheat. This is my first gose. I like the style based on this one."
"D-I don't really know how I would rate this regarding drinkability. It certainly expands the borders of flavor for me and in a positive way. I just don't know if this is my choice for any particular reason. Its worth a try and enjoyable if you let it get a little bit warm. The fruit esters come out then."
"Overall, this was crip, tasty and refreshing. A wonderfully light and airy brew with still a ton of complex flavor. Great for a hot summer day or a 75 degree night in February as was the case this time."
"D: This beer and style really has a nice and easy drinking thing going for it. The flavor is a bit strange and it takes some getting used to, but I dig it. Just has that nice touch of sweet and savory goin for it, and then it has that medicinal flavor. I am pretty sure if you drink this when you have a sore throat . . . CURED! Great beer and I dig the style. Look forward to tracking down more of these."
"D: Drinkable in the same way that water with lemons is drinkable. I could probably go for some heavier fare though."
"Huh. Well, that's a funny beer. It's sour and subtle. I can't say that I particularly love anything about it, but it's a fairly unique beer in my experience. The predominant flavor is yogurt of the Berliner Weisse variety of yogurt flavors. The spices are subtle with coriander coming through strongest. There are some fruit notes to the beer, some apricot, some plums. The sourness is light and not very strong. The feel is a touch watery. I think that I would prefer it a bit colder, not that I'd like the flavor diminished but it would help the feel. Okay beer probably won't seek it out again."
"Pours a hazy golden amber, kind of muddy looking, thick white head forms, tight bubbles, slowly settles down to a thin ring and layer, some lace spots. Smell is neat, some sweetness, honey, oats, banana, light fruit, some saltiness, orange peel, almost witbier like, light spice, pretty interesting. Taste is interesting, very light on flavour, almost a tea and salt combination, almost jasmine, salt, slightly vegetal, acidic finish, some spice, but slightly watery, vinegar/brine. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Saltiness feels a bit funny, but otherwise I could see this being refreshing in the summer."
"You look at it and you'd just assume it was a hefeweizen if you didn't know better. The cloudy orange-dark-tan body topped by a large, lumpy, long-lasting white cloud of a head fill the requirements of good looking hefeweizens. The aroma then throws you for a loop. That distinctive coriander scent doesn't belong here if this was a hefeweizen. Plus, it's missing much of the banana/bubblegum esters of a good hefeweizen, although a slight phenolic notes makes this smell much like you'd expect from a witbier. On the first sip, I noticed a sour twang that toned down drastically in further sips. The coriander makes for a nice bit of character in the flavor and the salt really shows itself mostly in meshing with the backend bitterness, but I'll qualify that with the fact that I'm a salt fiend, so my salt threshhold may be a little high. There's something missing though. It lacks the bold wheatiness or the creamy mouthfeel of a good hefeweizen. It's still a very unique, drinkable beer."
"D - A great beer that I could drink every day. Superbly balanced and highly unique. Refreshing and low in alcohol; this is a tough beer to beat in terms of drinkability. Take a witbier and a Berliner-weisse, and Leipziger Gose would be the child. Though this is my first time trying a gose, I would not hesitate to buy more if it were available. I do hope to see more beers of this style in the future, as this is an extraordinary beverage."
"Bottle from Winking Lizard. This brew is a cloudy yellow-gold color with a thick white head that diminishes slowly. Patchy lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus and yeast. Medium-bodied with a tart fruity character, and flavors of yeast and spices along with mildly sweet wheat. The finish is fruity and leaves a tart citrus aftertaste. Decent overall."
"Drinking Gose demands an acquired taste for nearly spicy beer. I had this one from the traditional glass bottle which has a thin neck and then a fat base. The aroma is certainly the spiciest that I have ever tried which is unique for a German beer. There is also some fruitiness as well. There aren't many outstanding East German beers which is why I appreciated Gose, and also for it's daring taste. Worth a try."
"Notes from 02/24/06."
"D: A unique brew, I'm glad I finally got to try something from this style. Pricey, but worth a go."
"Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Triple Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a honey brown with a big eggshell white head and left just an intermittent lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is sweet honey, with banana, clove, and just a hint of pectic tartness. The flavor is wheat malts, crisp green apples, just a lightly mild funky tartness and a salty mixture that sticks to your teeth. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and slightly dry. This would be a wonderful drink on a hot day."
"D- a real sleeper in my fridge, i had no idea gose would be this appealing. perfect for warm weather, clean and thirst quenching, i only wish i had a bigger bottle."
"Clean and drinks well for such a puckering offering. Enjoyable change of pace."
"This was a really interesting, light and refreshing beer. Definitely a nice change from the typical warm weather brew."
"D - Drinkability is good. This one is fairly light and refreshing throughout. Several could easily be consumed in one session. I can see this one being very good on a hot summer day. But alas, it is October and there is a chill in the air. This is my first exposure to the gose style and has piqued my interest to try more. Will I have this one again? Probably not."
"Pours a light, solid body with a two-finger head that sticks around and leaves some lacings. A sharp citric smell hit my nose first, and there are hints of spices like clove. Reminded me of a wit in the smell dept. Smooth and medium-bodied, orange and lemon peel seem to be the main things I taste, giving it a somewhat sour and tart feeling. It is also a little veggie-like and a little grassy, like a mix between a hefe and a pils or a cheap, adjunt filled American macro. Also some spices and hints of hops and finishes slick. I don't know, I've never had a Gose before and it was a good beer, but my overall feeling is that it is like a hefe with a more pronounced sour fruit/tartness to it. I'd have this again but I am not going to actively seek out more beers made in this style."
"Another interesting summer option, but unfortunately, like most summer beers, IMHO well short of great."
"d - makes me thirsty, the salt keeps it from being refreshing"
"Gose is not exactly the interesting beer I'd hoped it would be. I'm not exactly sure what could improve this beer. It's my first experience with a Gose, so I don't have much to compare it to. At the end of the day, it's an above average beer that I probably wouldn't seek out again."
"it is a crisp refreshing beer though I don't see myself drinking it often."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Salty and tart, mildly acidic, with a dry malt backing. Coriander is up front as well, lending further depth to the flavor. What an odd combination this is - but it somehow works. The body is light and the finish is dry and fairly clean, with a hint of tang from the salt lingering on the tongue."
"D: Great citrusy flavor with a slick palate makes for a thirst quenching summer time beer. Overall a decent good brew and drinkability."
"A great beer."
"This is my first experience with Gose, and I have to say that I'm a big fan. Very flavorful and a bit of a departure from other beers."
"Pours a somewhat cloudy golden hue with a fluffy three finger bright white head that dies down to a thin layer of foam. Lacing is pretty non-existant with a fair amount of bubbles racing to the top. Smell is very fresh and clean consisting of lemon, fresh cut grass, and some wheat. A bit of pepper and spice tickle the nose as well. Light and refreshing smell overall. Taste is very much the same beginning with lemongrass, apple, and hay followed by sweet wheat. Slight citrus hops midway with a mild salty bread flavor. Aftertaste is slightly dry and sweet with a touch of honey. Light and crisp body with a slick feel. Very refreshing beer, one that would be perfect on a hot summer day while bbq'ing. I'd drink this over a hefe anyday. Thanks a ton Greg for continuously hooking me up with amazing beers. I look forward to our future trades again and again :)"
"drinkability is decent. this is a unique brew, that could use more richness on the palate. the aroma is unique and nicely concentrated, along with a taste that falls short of anything special."
"Pours a hazy straw-to-apricot with a very quickly disappearing white head. Scents of lemon, orange zest, and coriander. Much of the same appears on the tongue, with some slightly sour/sharp twinge that calls to mind salt and margarita meeting at the rim of a glass. Finshes off a little like a SweeTart. Feels a touch thicker than the average wheat based beer. Refreshing and not at all cloying in spite of the rather intense fruitiness. A nice summer brew I'd take over the standard weiss."
"Worth a try..."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, it's my first beer in this style and I enjoyed it. It's a very good lighter beer to drink for a while."
"THis intersesting style of a bier pours out super carbonated, very murky. A yeasty, thick mustard-grain color. The beers holds a three finger head leaving good lacing for about two minutes. The aromas are summery, lemons,barley grains, corander, much like a Belgian wit.Effervescent, light mouthfeel tart lemony flavors, spicy corianders, bitter oranges. The flavors left at the corners of my toungue is actually quite salty, making another sip after sip come easily. It is very interesting to drink something as unique as this, personally I prefer a good Wit or Hefe, but the flavor profile matched exactly the description. A very true representation of the style. It only tastes better fresh in Berlin!"
"This has an appealing mineral vibe, and its dryness of texture/flavor, as well as the yeast character, makes it drink much like a Belgian saison, although there are clearly differences. As much as I enjoy it, its sharp/tart/dry elements wouldn't have me returning that often. Now...how exactly does this comply with the Reinheitsgebot? I thought the use of things like coriander and salt in any German beer was strictly verboten..."
"The mouthfeel is light and fairly thin making it more drinkable, but the aforementioned salt taste results in thoughts of drinking beer brine, which I imagine would be displeasing. It is possible that this style simply creates a dissonance with my palate. I'll have to search out another as confirmation or try this again down the road. As a gose novice this is not what I would describe as an enjoyable tasting beer, but its fringe qualities are."
"D: A nice drinker."
"Btw, I *just* poured the last of the bottle and took another sip and I'm just getting a smidgeon of malty sweetness that I didn't notice before. Another added treat to an already most enjoyable brew. Thanks again, Alan!"
"Drinkability is high as it is easy to drink and good flavor and low alcohol make it even easier. A very sessionable brew."
"Overall, I think this was a great Beer. However, it was over-priced (almost $18.00 at Sam's in Chicago). I should mention that it came in a different bottle from the one shown in the picture, but definitely the same Beer."
"Poured a nice hazy golden brown color with a nice fluffy white head that dissipated into some chunk lacing. The smell is of buttery malt and pepper, a noticable creamy funk (definitely the coriander and white pepper spices). The taste is of light coriander and white pepper. There is a bready malt that carries the salt flavor to the back of the brew. There is a noticable lemony citrus sourness to this brew. The feel is of a moderate bready malt and light to prickly carbonation. A nice bready malt brew with a kick of spice and salt to give this a unique flavor"
"I was expecting some sourness but it didnt materialize. The salt was a little distracting, but then Im not a fan of salty foods so it may not be for others. Id like to try another brand of Gose."
"Apperance pale yellow with haze huge white head that went down quickly and left a nice lace around the edge. Smell sour and acidic come to mind. Taste much the same as the smell a little like a lambic. Mouthfeel light in body high in carbonation. Drinkability is good I could have one or two of these on a warm summer day not the best on a cold NY night."
"D: Not bad at all. Would make a great summer beer."
"I like this brew. It's pretty tasty and goes down OK. The acidity might be a bit tiring after a few, but I guess that's why the traditionalists add syrup. As I'm getting near the bottom of the bottle, I'm getting a little tired of it. I imagine it would be mighty delicious with some thrown in."
"Overall, recommended. A very interesting, almost extinct style. Lots of flavor given the ABV as well. You may not like the salt, but hopefully you'll appreciate its uniqueness."
"Pours a clouded amber gold. Nose is yeasty and citrus. Flavor is yeasty, slightly wheat-y and leaves a long citric flavor on the tongue. It seems like a cross between a Belgian brew and a German. Quite interesting really. Definite spice influence, though I have to admit that my palate for spices is immature, so I cant pick them out as I should be able to. On the mouth it is low in carbonation but slightly thick in ingredients. Extremely drinkable. Like I said, this was the last bottle to be had where I bought it. If you see it, go for it."
"Overall I wasn't impressed, it just didn't have a good complex, taste, or feel. I wouldn't drink this again."
"Pours deep copper with a nice white head. The beer was bottle conditioned so there are a few floaties in the glass. The aromas off of this one are a bit funky, but give way to that of the ocean, cranberry, and sour cherries. The flavor is crisp and tart with hints of the sour cherries. The finish is quick and dry. A very nice brew, its too bad there are not more examples of this style out there."
"D: If you can get over the taste and smell, this would probably be fairly drinkable."
"this acidic character asserts itself more when i take a sip. dry, wheaty with a lemony zing at the finish"
" Body is light, crisp, and occasionally a tad foamy, but just about perfect for conveying the unique blend of flavors. This is quite tasty and refreshing - I imagine it would be a nice change of pace from a hefeweizen as a thirst quencher on a hot summer day. I'll definitely be buying more of this."
"Overall: I tried this beer the day after visiting Ohne Bedenken, the other Gosebrauerei in Leipzig. It's hard not to compare the two, and if you were to place the beers on a spectrum with Berliner Weisse being on one end and Hefeweizen being on the other, this was definitely on the Hefeweizen side while Ohne Bedenken was on the Berliner Weisse side. Between the lactic acid, salt and coriander, this is definitely a more complex beer than a Hefeweizen, but it is similar in its refreshing character. If you've never had a Gose before, try this one before Ohne Bedenken, as it is more toned-down. That being said, once you've had Gose this one may come off as a bit too pedestrian compared to its counterpart at Ohne Bedenken. Of course, if you're in the U.S., this is likely to be the only exemplar of the style you can find, and I would strongly advise you to give it a try. A wonderful style for anyone who loves the variety of beer."
"D: Really no idea what to expect from this one, other than a vague recommendation that it would be 'kinda like a berliner-weisse'. Well, liking that style a good deal boded weel for this Gose, and it did not disappoint. Quite tasty, amazingly easy to drink (gone in 5 or 6 sizable sips). This is one I'm glad to have tried, will recommend, and will look forward to having again."
" Overall a good brew. I had wanted to try this because I love new styles and this was apparently the only one in its style. That struck me as odd, so I have been actively seeking it out. I am now very glad that I did because it was a wonderful light brew that really brought a little something different to the table. I would easily buy it if I ever saw it in a store, it was just that good. Try it if you can find it, it should not disappoint."
"Was pleased to see an example of this style available at a store near me. Pours a somewhat murky orange coloration, with white heading that holds up well. Smell has some light fruit, and a somewhat metallic quality to it. Taste starts off with a bit of tartness, followed by a wheat presence and then ending with a metallic twang. Reminds me somewhat of how some white wines taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium. As far as drinkability goes, this is a brew that grows on you bit by bit with each sip. An interesting German ale. One that I might not drink all the time, but one that I am sure I will visit again. Cheers"
"Seems pleasing enough to consume, but not sure Ill be back."
"Drinkability: I am totally powerless to resist it's refreshing uniqueness. Everyone wins when they play Duck, Duck, Gose."
"Gose pours a golden yellow color with a white head from an oddly shaped, long necked, 750 ml brown bottle with silkscreened art and a flip top cap that popped nicely when opened. There is a nice, light citrusy aroma and a touch of coriander. There is a very citrusy flavor that stands out the most to me. There is a touch of wheat in the end. Flavorful and a nice summer beer. I'm surprised more variants of this style aren't available."
"16.9oz bottle. Hazy orange-golden with a moderate off-white head. Really nice spice, lemon, yeast, earth, caramel and honey aroma. Flavor is a bit disappointing based on the aroma. Malt, spice, yeast and orange up front, with a dry, lactic finish. Yeasty and thin bodied. Really unique."
"D - A unique wheat ale which is sessionable and easy to drink with a variety of snacks. I chose aged gouda but this is a great ale for summer all by itself."
"Thin and watery body, it has carbonation  but still feels flat. The 4.6% is no problem to drink  almost like a sour British pale ale, but one that has fish swimming in it."
"Quite a unique and surprising beer, fairly well done."
"Overall a very nice experience. An interesting style that is hard to come by in these parts. Very drinkable and suprisingly complex."
"Split a bottle of this brew with Stopper. Poured into a snifter at room tem. The beer is a clear copper hues with .5 cm fluffy bleached white head that fades to a thin surface layer quickly. Aroma is grainy and fairly lagery. First sip reveals an average body with fine fizzy carbonation, lite to average texture. Flavor is kind of funky with white grap and mild vinegar notes mixing with some lactic sourness. Is this beer past prime? Not sure. No hint of alcohol or any hop presence to speak of. Fairly drinkable, but tough to decide if I like the beer or not. Definitely unique."
"Mouthfeel- slightly tart, yeasty, sweet. Again, this reminds me of Natty's Dunkel-Weizen. A froth on the palate releases some hop bitterness. I get a little of the salt on the finish-coriander is faint and is lost in the yeast for me. Beer is very tasy. I was expecting something more complex but I am not disappointed."
"Drinkability: Wonderful, indeed. Once this beer was poured and tasted, everyone was asking for a second taste and soon the supply was gone faster than any other entry. Everyone agreed this beer was great to drink and could easily spend the afternoon quaffing Gose. Kudos to Beer Advocate member, JewelsVern, who searched out this wonderful beer and brought it to our annual tasting."
"Bottle was purchased at State Line (Elkton, MD) and served up in my Pinkus Alt glass, which is like a double-scale Koelsch Stange. While I was glad to find it (in apparently excellent condition), sadly German session beers don't really make sense at $3 a pop."
"Fine print: I know nothing of this style as this is the first Ive ever had so hard to pick accurate numbers for the beer stylistically. That being said, very cool and Id gladly pick up again. Cheers."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I could session this for sure."
"An odd combination, but actually a pretty good beer."
"Certainly worth a try if you can find it. This Gose would be well suited to enjoyment on warm spring or summer day. If only there were more, readily available examples of this relict style"
"Overall enjoyable. I think I would enjoy this more on a warm summers eve. It is refreshing (I think) and light on the pallet, easy to drink. Only 3 different types of this beer listed on BA, shame."
"Cheers!"
"Bizarr-looking brown bottle from Florian's. Gusher of a bottle! Wow this beer is tough to pour.. anyway... Bright yellow slightly hazy translucent body with a couple of inches of white head that dissipate over not too long, leaving a little lacing. Smells sweet, citrusy, yeasty, fruity, pithy, and spicy. Pith, yeast and spice characterize the flavor, Somewhat sour. Kind of aqueous in both flavor and mouthfeel. Cleaner finish. Light-bodied. The sourness hurts the drinkability somewhat. Unlike any other beer I've ever had... Similar to a witbier or maybe some Unibroue. A funky unique beer that takes a little getting used to, but grows on you after a while. Glad to have tried it."
"Half-liter German bottle brought home from the Capital Ale House in Richmond - brewed with coriander and salt, and bottle-conditioned. It pours into the weizen glass a fairly clear toasted amber hue (a bit darker after pouring the lees) with high, quickly-rising carbonation leading up to a finger of white head that reduces to a quarter inch and leaves decent lacing. I smell papaya or mango at first (surprisingly tropical I thought, although it is my first gose) but I also discover notes of tart or nutty wheat and light hops. It is quite mild on the palate, almost watery, but definitely unique, with light oxidation (paper or cardboard?), some tartness, a mild bitterness, and hints of peppery coriander and salt on top of a light, tingly body that leaves a fleeting finish. Definitely an interesting style, but I wish the flavors were more pronounced as the wheat was light and I could barely taste the spices, but this perhaps increases the drinkability."
"I'm glad I got to experience this (my 85th style), but this offering seems to lack substance, with the flavors not really coming together, nor the salt/coriander combo stepping forward enough to express themselves."
"Body and mouthfeel are both light and airy. Mouthfeel is almost fluffy with a very refreshing and thirst quenching drinkability. The 750 disappears quickly due to the low abv of 4.6. The world's most expensive lawnmower beer."
"Gald I tried it, but won't be back. I like salt, just not in my beer. This is one of those struggles where the brewer did exactly what they intended (so I read), but it just doesn't work for my taste."
"Drinks okay, this minus the cardboardy taste is pretty much how I rember this tasting the one time I had this in Germany. Worth a try, not to my tastes. I'm never really impressed with most rustic biers unless they are loaded with heft & flavor. This is what it is"
"My first and only gose beer, purchased from Whole Foods for $3. The beer was completely translucent hazy orange with almost no head. The aroma was sour and hinted at wheat, the flavor was odd but good. The bottle states it's brewed with coriander and salt, I didn't detect either. Nice to have tried but now I must move on."
"M&D - the beer, this style is incredibly drinkable. a smooth and easy flavor combined with a low-ish ABV lead to that. you could easily make this a session beer"
"Hazy orange bodywith a ncie cream head. Smells of sweet malts and spices. Yeasty tasting with some orange and other fruits. Didn't mix well with the other beers I tried that night. Worth picking up some more, at least of the style."
"D - Outstanding. This may be a favorite sessioner! I hope that more breweries start brewing this style....I love it!"
"Murky light brown color, slight orange hue. Small, very slight off white head. Smells a tad like sea air to me, with a slight honey note. The taste is like a very watered down butterscotch, with honey, tiny little bit of maple syrup, but not much. Finishes clean, decent mouthfeel with a tiny bit of carbonation."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Could definitely drink several of these. Quite refreshing. Seemed to go nicely with the sausage, cheese and crackers I was eating."
"Pours hazy gold, with limited yeasty cloudiness and a sea foam head that sticks to the beer and the glass like glue. Aromas of sharp coriander, wheats, and, yes, just a touch of saltiness. Smells like a Belgian witbier with a sharper edge. Sharp spiciness, full carbonation, then turning sour with lemony citrus notes. And that's about it. Not too much depth here, but the aromas and flavors that are here are unique. Refreshing, acidic mouthfeel that leaves the palate refreshed. Easy to drink (with a low ABV) as well. Very interesting, unique beer... not sure if it's stupendous enough to justify the price, unfortunately."
"A cloudy golden yellow beer. Has a huge bright white head with some lace. There is a light fruity peach like aroma. With a spicey background and a hint of corn. The head had a distinct salty taste that preceded the beer taste. Some, albeit a light version, of the usual flavors, clove and banana notes. But the acidic body ends up dominating the flavor. different, nice not fabulous"
"This was my first Gose. I have nothing to compare it to, and I have no idea how old this particular bottle of beer was. It poured a cloudly brown similar to an Alt-style beer, with a pure white head about half an inch thick. The initial taste was strange, and a bit unpleasant. The saltiness of the beer created a bicarbonate like flavor, punctuated in the middle by a dull metallic taste. Not a good start. A strange thing happened as I was drinking this beer: the taste steadily improved. As the beer warmed, it lost its metallic taste, and flavors other than the salt became noticable. By the time I finished, I was sorry to see it go. I'm definately going to give this style another try the next time I find it."
"This is an interesting style for sure and Im pretty sure I like it."
"Taste is mostly coriander but its not dominated by it. The wheat malt taste is there in full force, while light hints of bananas also make an appearance accompanied by a slight sour lemony flavor. There's a unique bite of salt at the end. Interesting beer and very cool."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, goes down almost too easily. This beer is a nice change of pace and quite refreshing. I could see myself drinking buckets of this on a hot summer day. A style that I wouldn't mind seeing explored a bit more often. Track yourself down some of this and give it a shot!"
"Poured into a Weihenstephan weizen glass. Slightly hazy dark yellow, touched by brown. Large and lazy particles float about. A fairly strong pour doesn't raise much of a head perhaps 2 fingers at max. It quickly recedes to a glass ring. Doesn't leave much lacing, but suds instead slide down the glass, leaving a ring at the original beer level. Has an aroma of a Belgian strong dark, very fruity in the nose. Also very sweet and slightly flowery. Maybe has a hint of wheat twang. First sip: like taking a draught of beer after coming from a swim at the shore, with spray still fresh on your lips. The salt is quite a shock for the uninitiated. It's hard for me to get a handle on the other flavors, since the salt takes over once it hits the back of your mouth. This is a very sweet and smooth wheat ale, it seems. Not too much wheat twang, either. I think the salt might be unsettling my stomach. I will attempt to review this for the style, and that demands salt, but I don't much like it, so I will take away points here. This might be a real nice drinker without the salt. The mouthfeel is made of a fairly full body, but with low carbonation it lends it a smooth mouthfeel. Again, drinkability suffers because I don't much like this, but I will try to seek the other Gose listed to see how it compares."
"Drinkability: A low abv and firm spicy flavor make this beer a winner."
"A curious drink - something a bit unique - but nothing that I, personally, was impressed with, or that I was particularly craving more of when I was finished."
"An interesting style and good beer. Another good summer quencher alla Berliner Weissebier; but not nearly as tart and more robust balanced flavors."
"Mineral salts and coriander, like seltzer and a Quebec style spiced beer. Really woke up the taste buds, and went with food. Needed much water after. Very foamy head, light copper coloured body. Middle grainy mouthfeel.I had to try this style, thanks for sending jpm30."
"Drinkability: This is interesting, and kind of refreshing in an odd way, but it's not something I'd like to drink every night. Might be an interesting beer to pair with pork or cook bratwurst."
"wow.. unimpressive looking and smelling but what a drinker. Definitely going to check this out with BBQ parties this summer.. it would go great by the pool with some steamers and roasted veggies. the salinity works for me like the sourness of belgian beers works for me."
"Expectations were low after a friend described it as a 'salt' beer that he was not impressed with. So the saison-looking beer was neither a surprise nor a certainty. The aromas show a light belgian sourness that remained thin and lightly pungent. Tastes much less salty than I expected. Though noticably salted, the dominant flavors were lemon and orange rinds with a belgin souness / tartness. Almost like a light unblended lambic quality. A little vineous, musk, herbal character persists. Flavors never dominate, and whisp away quite airy and cleanly in the finish. The beer is not what I was expecting at all, even though I didn't have many expectations. Nevertheless, a very clean beer."
"a very nice german beer. i will add leipzig on the list of places to visit next trip to europe. Will an american brewer dare try to brew a gose...?"
"Not a bad brew. But not a very good one either. Similar to an under-carbonated Wit."
"Mouthefeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The carbonation gives the beer a good all around lift. The beer has a pretty dry finish. Overall a nice sessionable beer. A very good drinking beer."
"Wow! Very surprising. Why there isn't more of this around I don't know -- it's really very good. Get some if you can."
"Verdict: This is a great ""small"" beer. The ABV is only 4.6%, but it never feels light on body or flavor. It's a sublime, effortlessly drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: Overall a good beer and a interesting style that I'm glad I tried at least once. Would I buy it again, probably not. I really don't care for salty beer."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Overall, I could say that this would be my go-to beer for those hot summer days were it not so darn hard to find and just a bit above my threshold for session beers as far as price is concerned. Nevertheless, I could easily drink a bunch of this beer in a session with no problems at all. This is the kind of beer that makes me happy to advocate."
"Mouthfeel is dry and lightly carbonated."
"This is my first gose (not that the world is crawling with them) so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I did, however, expect something more aggressive with respect to both coriander and salt. It's my understanding that this is another one of those odd German beers to which people occasionally add flavored and colored syrups. If I was in charge at Gasthaus & Gosebrauerei, I'd eliminate the need to add anything to the beer by simply making it goser."
"Pours a light head that dissipates quickly leaving a little lacing behind. It has a dark brown to gold appearance that looks fairly clear and crisp. The smell reminds me of as sweet bock bier. It's very fruity like apple and berry coupled with a hoppy smell. This bier is salty, the first bier I have ever had that is bitter and salty. Slightly spiced with salty flavors and hops."
"Drinkability: Extraordinary and unusual; has some similarities to a witbier but much more interesting"
"This gose poured a cloudy, yellow color with creamy, white foam that persisted a while but slowly settled, leaving a film coating the glass. The smell was floral with a touch of coriander and a light malt aroma. The taste was lightly sour with the flavor of wheat malt and coriander, very much like a witbier. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with light body and good carbonation. The lightly tart taste lingered. This was a very refreshing brew, though it seems to taste slightly differently each time I have it. Proabably a delicate beer."
"Beer is good. Happy brackish beering."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that could easily be a staple. Not horribly expensive for an import and very good beer for the price... got this one from my father who paid $3.99. Great beer and would recommend to anyone."
"This brew pours a cloudy orange color with a billowing white head. The aroma is of banana and coriander; like a really big witbier. The taste is of banana and coriander. It walks the fine line of being mellow while still being flavorful. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter the medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. It is sad that this style is so overlooked by American brewers."
"My first gose. Poured out to a slightly hazy brass color with a tiny bubbled white foam head. Medium high level of carbonation. Some notes of lace were present. Aroma of sea salt, wheat and grain, and sweet bread. Taste was quite light and mild, with overtones of mild orange, grain and malt. Some traces of yeast and corn. Slight tartness toward the finish, and overall rather dry. Mouthfeel was decent, but far from special. Carbonation lit the tastbuds up with hints of flavor that never really made it to fruition. Average drinkability. This isn't a bad beer, but reminded more of a well made American Macro. Worth a try."
"Overall: Wow, this is different from anything I've ever had. It's got some nice muted weizen characteristics and incorporates them beautifully in with the little spicy saltiness."
"Drinkability: Easily the best I have had from the style. And the worst."
"Poured off the tap at Dilly Deli in Cincinnati as a hefty sampler. Poured a beautiful pale yellow that was slightly hazy, but had a tremendous thick white head that lasted forever. Wheaty aroma with some twang in the background. The flavor begins with strong wheat, with some yeasty coriander. Finishes with tartness from the addition of the lactic acid. Didn't really get the salt profile that I read about, but there were some citrus hints as well. A lot more heavy on the mouth than expected from the looks of it. Drinkable, but not my favorite style."
"The mouthfeel is sharp and has a bite to it. Surprisingly quite full in body. I am glad I had the opportunity to drink this, but it lacks the high drinkability of most wheat beers, thus this beer seems to be lacking it's place in my beer food pyramid."
"The mouth has the feel of a good pale wheat, but with a little kick from the salt/spice/herb combo that is accented by the carbonation. This has session beer written all over it."
"I didn't what to think with a beer whose ingredients include coriander and salt. But was I surprised by this. Gose poured to a nice amber colored with a fizzy head that vanished in a instant. A nice spicey nose with a hint of wheat. At first taste you get hit with the spices and the salt comes in on thru the backdoor. It was like coming out of the ocean and getting a mouthfull of sea water. But have no fear the salt taste goes away within seconds. Overall an awesome beer and certainly one to try."
"Wow! This was a real summer quencher. Poured hazy sunshine yellow from the tall porcelain stoppered flasche. Aroma was fruity and lemony with hints of spice and floral notes. Head was creamy white and lingered leaving some lacing on the glass. Taste was acidic even lemony, hints of spice and traces of saltiness that this style is noted for having. an overriding sour taste was just the thing to take the edge off of a hazy, hot and humid Saturday."
"Drinkability was good, if you want something light and goes down easy."
"Very drinkable brew, I can't understand why it isn't made by more breweries. Hard to describe, think of wheat beer Gatorade. I would consider this for everyday use if only an American brewery made it. Alaskan brewing has shown mastery at making Altbier maybe they should try Gose?"
"I'm pretty sure I reviewed this one at one point, but apparantly i'm mistaken. This is a rare beer as only a handful of breweries in one region of German even make it anymore! Anyway it's now widely available in the states, and although it is quite pricey ir is definately a nice taste experience. This is a light gold, off-white brew with a big head of white foam that dies quickly and leaves almost no lacing on my glass. Aromas are all coriander, and citrus, just like a classic wit or wheat, but it is spicy as well and it does not have a strong hefe-y sort of flavor to it. Taste is salty/sour and spicy with the nice wit notes in the mix as well. No real fruity banana or German yeasty esters show their head though! Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the finish is dry, drinkability is pretty nice. A real ""one-of-a-kind"" brew that I quite like, but don't drink often...It will be cool to sup this one in Germany at the source soon..."
"Tasted at a homebrew club meeting. Interesting. The salt, coriander and wheat are indeed all in there. Kind of horsey and sour, with a definite lactic quality. I guess it's a beer that's exactly as advertised! Salt gives it a softened water taste. Then it finishes with a little sweetness. Not to my personal taste, but a pleasure to have discovered this."
"Very interesting style; haven't had anything like it before, still trying to wrap my mind around it. Certainly worth a try."
"I liked the look of it and the taste of it, but never came to an agreeement with the smell of it. Still, I will certainly try this again, with the expectation that there's more to appreciate."
"Half-a-liter bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy orange color with two fingers of head. There is a nice amount of lacing present. The smell is fruity and salty, a weird combo. Orange peel mixed with sea salt comes to mind. The taste has lots of citrus as well. Lime and orange take over, with some saltiness on the finish. Even a little peppery spice. The body is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is good too. Thanks to Kev for introducing me to this style of beer."
"fruity nose with corriander very reminescent of a wit style aroma although a bit under played on the some of the spice. good mouthfeel, nice refreshing wheat character...mixed style sort of...cross between a hefe and wit. clean aftertaste with just a hint of sourness in the finish."
"A salt beer? Hmm. Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small head that has good retention and leaves a small amount of lacing. The aroma is a little sour with something else that gives it a sharp edge. The flavor has a citrus thing going on, but then has a strange salty drying sensation at the end. Light body. I didn't enjoy this one much. Just not my thing."
"Drinkability- This is a great summer beer. So easy to drink and one of the most refreshing beers I have had. The price was a bit steep ($4.50 I think), but it was worth it. I'm wishing I snagged another couple of these. Damn!"
"Nice 3 finger head that falls slowly to a very healthy coat. Hazy orange color. Nose is pretty nice. A lot going on in there. I get lemon-spritzed banans most prevalent. The flavor is still not as impressive as I would hope. I get a saltyness initially, moving to a grainey flavor, but not harsh, and finishing a light fig or raisin. The feel is a solid moderate with a moderate carbonation. Drinkability is a little better than I gave it before. It is a well rounded beer. I'd get it when looking for something different. Bumping it to a solid 4 all around"
"Pours a hazy pale gold under a thick one finger white head that has lots of body but doesn't stay very long. A few spots and strings of lace cling to the glass. Distinct spicey nose, with the coriander mixing pleasantly with the citrus of a usual German weizen. The mouth is highly carbonated and fairly light. There is a definite tanginess here, like a weizen, but somehow sweeter. The coriander is not overpowering, but is definitely present. There is a slight saltiness in the finish, rather like mild perspiration. The sweet fruitiness is a touch like lemonade, or perhaps a Berliner Weisse. Certainly an interesting brew, although I can't say I would want more than one glass under most circumstances."
"I feel fortunate to say that there are about 3 stores within ten minutes of me that carry this on a regular basis (let me rephrase...it is probably never restocked since its first shipment). The bottle has a jovial german man who seems to be happy about something. This poured out a hazy straw color with a nice sticky head forming right away. There was a good amount of spontaneous carbonation running all through the glass. The aroma was delicate and floral doughy presence. Small traces of spices popped through as well. The taste is definately different than anything I have had before. I would't say it is an unfamiliar taste in the sense of other Wiezen styles, but the saltiness is an unfamiliar touch. Apparently the use of salt in this style of beer traces back to some real old-school brewing practices that are not so common anymore. The salt aspect is not what I was expecting. It is much more subtle than table salt, but it lingers enough to know it is major piece of this brew. The salt and corriander leave my mouth very dry, but refeshed. I can say that this not a style of beer that I am crazy about, but it is a very unique beer that I feel honored to have tried. This is true old-school German brewing."
"A really unique beer, which always scores points in my book. Pours a light yellow orange amber color with a poofy white head. Smells spicy and dusty. Those scents are even more pronounced in the taste, which is pretty complex. Nice herbal hop taste with lots of complex spicy backgrounds. The use of corriander and salt is definately apparent, and in my opinion pretty interesting. This beer also has a pretty apparent funky taste as found in Belgian styles, a good surprise I wasn't expecting. Really nice and smooth mouthfeel makes this beer particularly refreshing and a pleasure to drink. If you want something out of the ordinary go pick up a bottle of this stuff. The dude on the front of the bottle looks like he's having a blast."
"D- This is a very unique smooth beer. It has a good pale malt taste with a nice spicy finish. Very nice for a summer quafting beer. Nothing to shock the tastebuds but a good solid beer."
"Very cloudy amber, nice color. Gentle 1cm white head, no carbonation apparent. Wild aroma, salty hops with a little matchstick, faint malt and lemony hints. A bit empty body-wise, it tastes rather meaty, vegetal, mineral, all over a tart background a bit like sour bread and rhubarb. Sour and Salty aint no friends. Light body, light carbonation. Bleh, hopefully the other gose defends this style better, because this one is one of those select few that deserves twice more points for the appearance than taste."
"This is a beautiful thing."
".5 liter bottle. Pours a hazy yellowish brown color. The large foamy head lasts a long time, and there are nice clumps of lace on the side of my .5 liter weissbier glass. The aroma is fruit (lemon and apple), yeast, spices, and a little funk. The flavor is fruity, much like tart apples. There is a malty wheat flavor, and little hop flavor or bitterness. The balance comes from the salt. There is a coriandor flavor, but it is not as strong as in many spiced Belgian beers. Very crisp and refreshing. This beer tasted weird to me at first, but the more I drank, the more I loved it. I could drink this stuff all the time."
"This is only the 2nd bottle I've had of this very distinctive beer (bought off the internet, as it's not distributed here). The first time, a couple years back, I thought I tasted the salt a lot more than I do now. I think this would be a perfect beer with some semi-soft cheeses (like Chimay's wonderful cheeses)."
"Light-medium bodied, I was a bit at a loss as I had no experience to compare this one against."
"Slight cloudy/murky light orange in color, strings of carbonation rise to the top, a thin, active head. Has a very odd, but receptive nose of salt, coriander, and some outdoor type freshness. Massive twang in the palate, sharp wheaty and malt offerings up front. Lemon zestiness, similar to hefe's, but more crisp and flavorful. Maintains a decent medium body, coriander and some metallic tastings. Stays the same, even as it warms to room temp and beyond, finish is slightly tarty, crisp and creamy, what a superb brew, oh so easy to quaff, and oh so tasty. Here's to you, here's to me, go get the Gose!"
"Edit: I found out that it is from E. Germany after my guess. There must be a ton of beers from East Germany that are excellent but very difficult to obtain ( in the US) even to this day."
"Clear, coppery-gold in hue, there is a steady stream of bubbles racing towards the white head. In a variation of a Pilsner glass the head reached an apex of two very bubbly fingers. The head retention was very good, it took awhile before it started to fade, it still had good height and a tight cap lasted the entire consumption. While the color is ordinary, the big & rocky head makes this a lovely looking beer. Subsequent lacing was patchy. The nose is airy but not empty. The main fragrance, while lacking in potency, is obviously spicy-salty with a sharp earthy twang at the back. Lemony notes too, some brief hints of metal. The nose doesnt say much beyond this; however while I cant describe the smell it does trigger my mind to think hops. Even though the potency is lacking, the constant, repeated whisper is unique. The bouquet is more intriguing than inviting. Regardless, it is drinking time. The palate is amazingly refreshing. It took about four sips before I anointed this the most refreshing beer I have ever had. Move over Dortmunder, Hefeweizen, or Pale Ale Gose has won my heart! The flavors are crisp and to the point, only the earthiness is wide and found throughout. Upfront is a mild blast of salty-spice and lemony flavors. In the middle was a sweet-saltiness that made my mouth water. Interestingly by the finish the beer turned dry. While this beer is largely clean there is an odd but enduring aftertaste, it is sweet & earthy but salty & tart all mixed in one sensation. Im impressed. I can easily see why some would not enjoy this beer; it strikes some very unique cords. They just happen to the correct notes with me. The relatively lively carbonation works perfectly with the flavor profile. Not to mention the low abv. The mouthfeel is very pleasant. Medium/medium-light in body but it is perfect for this beer. It is easy to drink, I could session with this beer, effortlessly. I found it quirky and fun, of course finding more bottles might be a chore. I bought my sample in Burnsville, MN for $4.19. I really dug it, and I cant imagine how wonderful this would be fresh! Recommended."
"Pours a nice hazy golden color with deep hues of dark amber colors throughout. A firm white head about an inch high forms and laces the glass quiet nicely. Aromas are a bit spicy, with a slight coriander and peppery notes, but then move to more wheaty lemony citrus like aromas. Smells pretty damn good. Initially this beer hits up front with a nice wheaty like flavor that quickly moves towards a more citrus lemony flavor. In the middle there is a dry briney sort of flavor with just the slightest hint of salt, which just tingles on the tongue because of the delightful carbonation. There a nice yeastie like flavor that also makes its way into the mix. This beer finishes sweet and zesty, with a nice crisp carbonation and just a bit of spice, that leaves the tongue just wondering ""what the hell happened here"" of course in a good way that is. This beer is delitefully light bodied with a zesty sort of carbonation that just feels great on the pallate. Overall this beer and its style is fantastic and a nice change of pace from some of the other beers I've been trying lately."
"Pours a clear copper color, it is well carbonated which supports a tan head. The aroma is of grain-wheat with notes of lemon and some light spice notes. To me this has a clean appetizing aroma. The beer is sweet up front with a lightly sour finish. The sourness seems to be both a combination of the wheat used and the yeast/ bugs used, though it is quite light and in almost not there when compared to some of the other sour beers of the world. This beer is light and refreshing, a perfect beer for this hot July night. There almost seems to be a smoky note in the finish, perhaps this is all that is left of the coriander. The beer itself is non-descriptly spicy. I have a feeling that this light beer is showing its age a bit, while still quite enjoyable, it was not as pronounced in its uniqueness as the brewing process would suggest."
"Nice. Quite salty, spicy and citric. Some cloves. Lightly tart and acidic. Mouthcovering palate, while not being to heavy, left me wanting more after every sip. NIce dry, light, yet palate covering, everything seemed to be in its right place. Cool bottle too. Great beer. Thanks Per."
"I'll be honest, I was a little scared about the salt part of this beer, but this was pretty good. Poured out a dark orange/golden color with a nice amount of carbonation in this beer. A good quarter inch stays with you the entire time. Smell consisted of coriander mostly, but cloves and soft fruit was in there as well which mellowed out the sharp coriander. Taste was half witte/half hefe. The cloves and coriander blend in together and the banana flavors balance it out, and then the salt hits in the aftertaste, but it's quite pleasent. It finishes wet in a way, but the salt makes you want to drink more and more, which I was amazed on how it did that to me. So Gose it is, pick some of this stuff up. A good shake up for the summer months instead of all those witte's and hefe's."
"Doesn't this beer break some kind of purity law or something?"
"The story of Liepzig's ghost beer coming back from the dead is probably more interesting than the beer itself, although it's subtle tartness and dryness from the addition of salt do give it a really unique, refreshing quality. It pours easily enough, giving rise to a full head of thin, creamy white lace that holds exceptionally well and leaves thick, long-lasting rings of lace about the glass. Very fine, effervescent bubbles can be seen rising quickly to the surface, and it basically resembles any well-made hefe-weizen. Coriander is evident in the nose along with a touch of weizen-type yeast characteristic (apple and subtle phenolics). In the mouth it's tiny bubbles lend a gentle caresses as its light body passes smoothly away with a delicate creaminess. Wheat malt appears first on the palate, followed by some dark fruitiness (similar to that of a hefe-weizen, but there's no banana except for a very soft note in the aftertaste) and a splash of tartness; followed by a mild coriander flavor and some herbal hops at the swallow. Seemingly out of nowhere, salt springs forth... drying, tangy?, and oddly refreshing!!! It's not as bold in flavor as a traditional Bavarian hefe-weizen, but it's unique characteristics, less-sweet flavor, and slightly lower alcohol may give it a bit more drinkability. If you like hefe-weizens and tart (or lightly tart) beers, then this is a must try!"
"Unusual and very enjoyable; a beer to do interesting food pairing experiments with."
"Looks like homeade ginger beer with its refreshing, hazy, caramel orange color. The beer pours a nice, sponge like, off white head that starts a t two fingers and retreats to a solid one, throughout. The aromas are of (who'd a thunk it) spicy corriander and sea salt. This begs for a hot pretzel with mustard. The beer is medium bodied and creamy in the mouth. A very refreshing drink that shows best quite cold. An intriguing element of savory from the salt adds local color to the beer. Perhaps the salt is so you keep on drinking? Brilliant glass of suds."
"Exact same bottle as in the picture. The bottle says brewed with coriander and salt."
"Delicate lemony citrus notes are followed by a strong spicy coriander flavour. This is balanced by a pleasant sour twang that lingers on the tongue. Hard, mineral driven finish. Light bodied, moderate carbonation. Very unique & interesting."
"The beer came is a 0.5 liter brown bottle with label that looked like a blast from the past. The beer, when poured into an imperial pint glass, displayed extremely fizzy carbonation and a body that was yellow with a cloud of brown yeast that would not let any light pass through. I guess if a Hefeweizen is cloudy, this one is like an oncoming storm. The aroma was sweet and malty with some lambic like funkiness thrown in. The taste is very light with the yeast tasting very spicy with orange peel and clove that overpowered most other flavors except a note of sourness that reminded me of a lambic once again. I could not really detect much coriander, but the salt was evident in the way the beer dried up my mouth after each sip. This is a very unique taste that is somewhat of a cross between a witbier and a lambic. The downfall of this beer is a watered down empty mouthfeel, which is a bit odd considering the body is not very lightweight. I picked up mine at Greens on Cheshire Bridge Road. In my opinion worth a try, as there is nothing else quite like it."
"Notes: Not too exciting. Would be nice on a warm day. Theres just not much depth, and the mouthfeel is slightly lacking."
"Hazed deep golden appearance. Orange luminates from the beer as well. The one finger off-white head has good retention. Lace is droopy, but decent enough. Aroma's nice. Spicy and herbal. Earthy. Malty. The taste is interesting. Very earthy. Like dirt to an extent. Has a bit of a farmyard presence to it. Malts are sturdy enough. Hops add just a little bitterness. Rock salt is sprinkled on top. The carbonation is a little high. And the body is about medium or a little better. Interesting brew. My first Gose. Not one I'd need to return to anytime soon though."
"Excellent drinkability. I'm surprised that this style is not more common. Clean and light bodied enough to drink several of these in a sitting, if on an unlimited budget."
"Update: 1-12-2007 - $13.99 for 750ml bottle from Tulley's Beer and wine Wells, Me."
"Nothing here really leaps out, but there are nuamnces enough to keep your interest. Each element carries a pleasant signature, and they merge nicely into a balance that yields a unique result. If it suits your tastes, with its spicy identity, then it's quite drinkable, and I found it just so. A year ago I'd likely have turned up my nose at this, but my preferences have shifted to the point where I find this something I can truly enjoy. It makes me wonder what new and wonderful changes another year will bring."
"Pours a darkish yellow with a huge fluffy head. The head looks like a science experiment gone awry. Smell was hefe with a twist. I got apples, bananas, orange, spice, and ocean air. The taste was also unexpectedly good.. It was like a normal wheat beer with added components. The spices were notable and made the beer have a wit like edge to it. However the salt was what added the most. It added a briney dry finish. It was almost like adding beer to your mouth while eating a nice salty oyster. It was refreshing and drying at the same time. Mouthfeel was nice. went down smooth as silk.. One could drink a lot of these, if not for the salt.. After a couple I did find the salt was not making my tummy too happy. and later I did feel a bit parched.. But that is a small price to pay for a tasty brew. Much better than the other Gose I have had."
"Drinkability: It's certainly a chuggable beer. I'll give it that."
"Sampled 12/31/03"
"Pours a light golden color with a great fluffy head that left some light lacing,aroma is of lemons with a hint of mineral.Taste is light and refreshing pretty acidic with that saltiness showing thru in the finish and aftertaste wich was more pronounced than what I thought it would be.A great easy drinker I think would be great on a hot summer day here in Carolina."
"Drinking this gose is much more an experience about mouthfeel and refreshment than taste, and on that simple level, it's an enjoyable brew, perhaps one of the best beers for a hot summer day. I could drink a ton of these, but I think my tastebuds would get bored."
"As far as I know this is the only commercial example of Gose available in the US and it is the only one that I have ever tried. With that said, I wish there were more. I would like to see other brewer's versions. It has a slight hazy copper color with a large head. The aroma is delicate and subtle with aromas of citrus and spice. The body is smooth and thin. There are tastes of orange and it reminds me of pretzels from the use of the salt. There is a slight sourness in the refreshing finish. Bring on more Gose!"
"The taste is nice, much like a typical Weiss beer (a mild banana taste from the yeast), but a tiny bit different, a little dry, virtually no aftertaste whatsoever, just a bit of residual sweetness. This is no doubt due to the salt in this brew. Very nice, light, extremely easy to drink. A great summer brew."
"Thanks to chaduvel for slogging this out to UT for me. Pours a hazy mandarin copper color with a big, fluffy, creamy, slightly off white head. Nice. Smell is light orange with some tangy wheat notes, coriander, and yeast. Taste is smooth wheat malt up front that quickly gets tangy/sour, and accented with coriander. Picking up lemon notes, and there seems to be a unique, salty character to it all. Very interesting. Finish is wheat bitter with lingering coriander and some banana-y esters. This beer has a big mouthfeel for its strength, and gets better as it warms. Glad I got to try this!"
"Drinkability  I thought the salt was a little overpowering, although I guess it is typical of the style."
"Taste is grainy wheat with underlying spice. Saltiness doesn't come through until later, it's cumulative. The more you drink, the more saltiness on the palate. While the beer is smooth and creamy in the mouth, the saltiness builds and makes this brew less than drinkable, at least more than one bottle at a time. But a unique experience that I would recommend and I will indulge in again."
"John"
"sinec there are only two of this style in the database i figured they're fairly hard to come by, so i snatched one up as soon as i saw it. can't compare it to anything else in the style (again, as there are only two), but this one is different nonetheless. not bad, just different. it pours a cloudy amber colour with a lovely foamy head. so far so good. the smell is quite different. a bit sweet, a bit salty, a bit stale almost. complex but strange. the taste here is also not overly appealing at first, but it is quickly warmed up to and whilst not exceptional, is solid just the same. there's a bit of fruitiness here but it is peppered with salt, if you will. just a very strange style to try to review, in all. i say go try one and be the judge yourself. some will love it, others will hate it. i, on the other hand, fell pretty much in the middle on this one. i'd like to sample the style again to compare, but won't be breaking down any doors to seek it out."
"nice appearance, hazy yellow with a big thick head that had excellent retention and good lacing. There wasn't much of an aroma, somewhat like a fresh bag of potato chips. The taste was dry, kinda salty with a hint of the coriander. The finish was pretty dry. I wasn't too impressed with this beer, thinking the odd ingredients would somehow be more pronounced. If I didn't know better, I'd think this was just an above average macro."
"So it gose."
" I imagine this beer would go well with food,maybe chips or cheese? An interesting effort but probably not one I would go out of my way to find."
"Murky pale copper hue. Pitted, frothy vanilla white head leaves spotty, sparse lace. Spicy, sharp clove and herbal coriander dominate the aroma, but are offset by mellow, ripe banana esters. Mild lemony, citric tartness. Slight papery oxidation notes prevent vibrancy. Pronounced clove lends a mild medicinal note upfront. Grainy wheat tartness comprises the dominant malt character, and is accompanied by a parching dryness provided by mild, pure salinity. Simple, breezy banana esters provides token girth. Appropriately lightly bittered due to the paltry residual sweetness. Musty, nutty suspended yeast undertone. Phenol augments as the beer breathes, and approaches rubbery in nature. Well attenuated, with a brisk, thinnish mouthfeel. Finishes with a lingering suggestion of clove studded salted, preserved lemon. A strange brew, with unbalanced elements of a wit and hefeweizen. Maybe I just missed the orange peel, or the overt salinity overshadowed it. Tasty, but rough around the edges. I'd very much like to try more of this obscure style."
"Cloudy light orange color, looks like a hefeweizen, has a huge creamy head that clings to my glass. Aroma is that of a hefeweizen, spicy wheat smell. Taste like wheat and mild spice, I can't really taste coriander yet it is a bit salty. Light bodied with a kind of a watery mouthfeel, finishes a bit sour, very drinkable and not bad, but not sure if I would buy this again."
"Thanks LBB for something different."
"An intriguing style, rarely encountered, and quite easy to appreciate. If I'm ever in the mood for a mellow, dry brew that won't go and blow my mind, gose it is!"
"I'd wanted to try this style of beer for quite some time, and was pleased to finally get a chance. The appearance of the beer is truly amazing: a towering, everlasting, rocky, white head tops a coppery-caramel colored liquid. The head is phenomenal. Very slight haze in the beer. Coriander is distinct in the aroma along with a mix of esters. First taste is at once sweet and sour. Salt comes through in the hind-taste. It becomes more pronounced as you drink more of the beer, causing a mouth-puckering and unexpected reaction. I don't think I would enjoy beer after beer of this style, yet it's strangely refreshing."
"Highly Recommended. Trad. Lambics fan will love it."
"Drinkability: A pastiche of other, more familiar, beer styles. A healthy dose of wit, a sizable portion of hefe, and a dash of gueuze (I wonder if there is a similar etymology here). A great beer for food, especially bratwurst and other German delicacies. I suspect I'll be having a few of these next summer during grilling season."
"You look at it and you'd just assume it was a hefeweizen if you didn't know better. The cloudy orange-dark-tan body topped by a large, lumpy, long-lasting white cloud of a head fill the requirements of good looking hefeweizens. The aroma then throws you for a loop. That distinctive coriander scent doesn't belong here if this was a hefeweizen. Plus, it's missing much of the banana/bubblegum esters of a good hefeweizen, although a slight phenolic notes makes this smell much like you'd expect from a witbier. On the first sip, I noticed a sour twang that toned down drastically in further sips. The coriander makes for a nice bit of character in the flavor and the salt really shows itself mostly in meshing with the backend bitterness, but I'll qualify that with the fact that I'm a salt fiend, so my salt threshhold may be a little high. There's something missing though. It lacks the bold wheatiness or the creamy mouthfeel of a good hefeweizen. It's still a very unique, drinkable beer."
"Gose pours with a large bubbly head requiring a slow pour in order to control it. The head is fairly sticky, and piles pretty high above the rim of the glass. When it finally recedes, it sticks to the sides of the glass, and forms a thick lace that stays for the life of the glass. Theres a great aroma, and lots of it. The aroma is citrusy with lots of lemony notes as well as some yeast and slight spice notes. Cant really smell any salt that is typically mentioned with the style. The color is a nice slightly hazy amber. The start is slightly smooth but the tartness kicks in quickly with carbonation that adds some additional bite. Malts add some graininess to this brew and are subtle throughout this brew. Along with the tart up front palate are citrus notes, namely lemon. Spice notes are fairly subdued, but noticeable (I probably would have missed specifically naming the coriander if the bottle didnt mention it). The saltiness seems to become more apparent towards the end. The finish is crisp and dry, again with some tart lemon notes. Definitely heffe-ish but not quite. Still, a refreshing summer brew."
"This beauty pours a gorgeous dark cloudy copper color with swirling yeast dregs and a grandiose crown of a head that is creamy and rocky. Fantastic lacing that lasts the entire beer. Salty yeast and wheat aromas with hints of vanilla, banana, pepper, and coriander, definitely can smell the coriander. Taste is smooth and full of sweet wheat beer esters (banana, cloves, touch of vanilla) then the salty/pepper flavor comes through in the middle and adds a dryness and mineral content, then finally the finish is bready and yeasty. Amazing! I could best describe this beer as a combination of a superb Hefeweizen with the best components of a Wit beer added. Awesome. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had."
"In sum, a solid tasting hefe-weizen with small but sizable untraditional additions. One of the true great finds in the world of beer."
"This was my first experience with gose. I really have no idea what the beer is, besides a hard to find german style. Very odd, but definitely an experience, and not unpleasant at that."
"PintofAle nailed it - like a cross between a wit and a hefeweiss. A friend of mine said it tasted like a Rotbusser (obscure German wheat/oat ale) with coriander added. If you see this - try it. Excellent brew."
"A lemon zest character is one of the predominant, fragrant aromas that arise from the glass. Strong floral smell. As it warms, it has in the nose a sort of muted sugar sweetness that reminds me of saltwater taffy. The tangy flavor smacks of citric acid and suits the light body well. So it seems to start off as a simple refresher, but a very textured mid-palate leads to an almost-salty flavor that masks any big finish and lingers for minutes afterwards. If you even think of serving this at refrigerator temperature, smack yourself around a little bit. The aromas and flavors are too interesting to subdue."
"This is not your typical German beer. I really enjoyed it, it reminded me slightly of Allagash white. One I would recommend to anyone, especially a fellow BA."
"Another beer of ethereal quality from B. United."
