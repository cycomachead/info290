"Darker than your typical Gose, as if barrel aged. The aroma has a faint oaky sourness, almost like balsamic vinegar. Strong lemon flavor characteristics along with a bit of ginger. Light bodied, medium high carbonation. Much sweeter than the Goses I've previously had and with less salt. Make me think of Radler, but much heartier."

"This is a superb sour, truly exceptional and quite impressive for this coming from an American brewery. Very much worth seeking out and trying, should be considered as a reason to visit Richmond for beer fans."
