This highly effervescent beer has a tart, lemony, salty refreshing grainy palate. It starts with a hint of fruity sweetness but the lemony tartness soon rules. There is a faint bitterness on the finish. In the beginning the beer is like drinking a cloud but on the finish a big carbonic burst triggers the pain receptors on your tongue and wipes the palate clean. Crisp and refreshing.","pat61","Nov 15, 2014"

The smell of this is pretty much dominated by a fresh grainy scent. Not bad but also kinda lacking. The taste is surprisingly sweet with a fresh grain aspect before getting lemony and slightly mineral-filled. Somewhat fruity at times as it opens up. This is light bodied and moderately carbonated. It is easy drinking and fits the bill for the style.","stakem","Oct 15, 2014"

Taste was quite tart, with a bit of bready wheat, finished with a salty, briny tone.  Mouthfeel was pretty light, but fitting for the beer, pleasing on the palate.  Overall, this is a great refreshing beer.","timontheroad","Oct 14, 2014"

Flavor follows the smell closely with tart and sweet lemons and honey, wheat malts, some light saltiness (very light), and a funky yeasty finish. The body on this was pretty light and refreshing, with medium carbonation. This really came off more as a saison to me, but had it side by side with their honey saison and this had a slight salt tinge to it.

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour wheat, lemon, floral flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty, light, and refreshing, but I think the smell is slightly better on this one.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 27, 2014"

I also liked the Marionberry Hibiscus Gose from Widmer, though I was one of the few, apparently. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine on Adams Ave.","mactrail","Mar 09, 2014"
