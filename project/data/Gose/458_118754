3.75,-2.8,,,,,,"The perfect style of beer for the Texas summer. Light in color and body, the limes are apparent in both the aroma and the flavor. The salt hits about middle to slightly after. Malt is very unpronounced and shows up toward the finish. Hard to tell if the coriander has any influence as the lime predominates.","LittleDon","Sep 03, 2014"

3.85,-0.3,,,,,,"Its not much on the sour end of things, unfortunately. Those hoping for something as tasty as Westbrook's offering will be left wanting, but there are some enjoyable flavors to be found here, mostly the soft wheat, salt and lime. The coriander I could do without in this beer and oddly, I find this better on the cooler side as opposed to cellar temp. Good enough to go back for repeat sixer purchases, but still leaves me dreaming of having Westbrook Gose in a PICC line.","twiggamortis420","Aug 30, 2014"
3.25,-15.8,,,,,,"Pours out a hazy brass with no head.  Smells largely of grain and lime.  Lime and salt are the big flavors here.  Lightly tart and a bit sweet.  Grainy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is a tad flat and lightbodied.  Overall, this is OK in the can.  Way better on tap, but I'm rating this based on the can example.  On tap it seemed to be drier, tarter, and saltier (all better in my opinion).","goochpunch","Beers"

Finished pretty dry. High carbonation which is a bit different but works for it. Overall a great Saturday afternoon six pack.","TownDunkel","Aug 02, 2014"

Not my favorite Gose as it's not as tart as Westbrook's version, but it does have a bit more in common with Leipzeiger's version than Westbrook's.","Stevedore","Jul 24, 2014"

Taste is very light and limey like a Mexican lager with a lime in it, the lime really shines through definitely not in the background. Body is very light and clean. Its a refreshing pool side drinker, nothing extremely special, but super sessionable and great for outside.","zander4dawin","Jul 22, 2014"
