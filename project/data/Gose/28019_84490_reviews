"Verdict: A very nice take on the Gose from Sante Adairius, simple and balanced, refreshing with pleasant bright qualities. I would love to enjoy this in quantity during the summer months."

"A hazy, light straw yellow with a dense white head, this looks good. The nose is brilliant. Bright, sour, focused, with a blend of funk, earth, mushrooms, a touch of sulfur, salt and coriander all on a wheaty, bready base, this smells excellent. The palate mirrors these flavor notes, with the robust wheat base, dextrinous and lending a backbone for the lactic and Bretty flavors. Refreshing. Very nice."

"Overall - Had this at the end of the night, which was probably foolish.  Nice beer, but perhaps I missed some of its nuances."

"One of the best takes on a gose I have encountered. Neon yellow/orange with floral and citrus right away. Ever so slightly funky. Not as salty as some other contenders, but the sea salt is there. All around solid."

"Salty poo.  Better after 10 minutes in the glass to air out, but still nothing to write home about."

"On tap at the brewery. Pours a dark pumpkin color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is stone fruits and mild saltiness, funk and banana. Flavor is vivid dried apricots with mild coriander and brine. Really fruity, brett C, high carbonation, dry finish. Really came together well."
