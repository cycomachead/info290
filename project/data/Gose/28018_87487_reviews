"Wow. This beer should get more attention. Best beer so far in FL. Just an excellent combination of flavors and a very nicely done gose."
""

"On par with Westbrook for sure...near perfect gose (or at least a near perfect American representation)"
""
"The tight malt, drinkability of this beer and interesting fruity/melony aroma and flavors make this gose stand out.  It's hard to judge carbonation but it could also stand with a bit more sour.  Really well done.  I hope this style takes off,  the craft world could do with a few more like this one."

"Overall: Elegant and sophistocated Gose. Its easily the best Gose that I have ever had. It is effortlessly better that Westbrook Gose. I have honestly never heard of Rapp brewery before, but I will be keeping an eye out for them now. This beer has absolutely no flaws."

"NYE growler share courtesy of stevencon. Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow. Thin white head and same collar. Aroma is lemony and very light dry barn-like funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with a slight briney-ness to it. Nice light body and mediumly carbonated."

"D: First Gose for me and this one is not bad at all. Without any comparison this seems to be pretty well done to style. Would make for a great beach beer. Glad to have tried. I don’t think Gose will be a fav of mine but I look forward to trying more."
"o - Overall I liked this gose a lot; I'd put it slight after the Westbrook and Cascade goses I've had as one of the best. Light and crisp with some nice lemon tartness like a berliner, but the salt comes through in the taste for sure. Worth seeking out and would like to have it again."

"Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and Fruity Pebbles aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour fruity and salty flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is refreshing, tasty, and easy to drink."

"O: This might be the only (first) example of the style I've had, but I find it quite enjoyable. Nothing I'd always have in the fridge, but easy to drink, refreshing, and definitely an interesting style."

"O – I haven’t had a lot of Gose with which to compare it, but I really like this. Easy drinking, refreshing, and tasty. Plus, the 4% ABV means I can finish the growler without hurting myself."
