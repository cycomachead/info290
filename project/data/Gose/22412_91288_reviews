"They should look to Westbrook or Rapp Brewing for a better idea of what a gose should be."

"This Gose doesn't really make Raul want to GO(se) for another (see what Raul did there?) but it's aite enuff."

"Overall this is pleasant to sip but not very interesting. Still, it's a refreshing tangy quaff that might be a good introduction to the style. For those who demand a vinegar smell, it may be too mild."

"Overall it's my first time trying this gose style and its definitely something I would like to try more of. This has a lot of the great hefeweizen qualities but adds the great sour notes."
"O: This is a well made gose, and it's nice to see another memeber of this rare beer style around. Hope they bottle this one to allow the number of bottled goses I've seen to increase to two."
"Overall Impression- First time enjoying anything by this brewing company and was very pleased! I hope California keeps continuing the trend of brewing sours! Would highly recommend this one."
"This is a fun gose which would be appropriate to drink during most days. Keep it going Noble...."
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and lemon-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly salty flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice mouthfeel that makes this one easy to drink."
