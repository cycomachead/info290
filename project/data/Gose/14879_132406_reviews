"Overall: An enjoyable gose, though neither quite as sour nor as salty as one might hope for. Still, it does make for a refreshing citrus beer, without dragging along ridiculous levels of hops."

"Recommended. Despite the high ABV this is definitely more of a traditional Gose than are many of the sharply citric, and quite popular, ones on shelf today."

"O - It is not a bad tasting beer. It is light and refreshing. It has enough tartness to keep me interested in the entire 22 ounce bottle."

"22 ounce bottle.  Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about a half inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly.  There's a small amount of lacing.  Aroma is on the weak side (but it's not bad), the brew smells like lemon peel, white grapes, green apples, wheat/grainy malt, lime, and a bit of salt.  It tastes like lemon, salt, wheat/grainy malt, citrus peel and some earthiness.  I think it's more salty than tart, I expected more tartness out of this.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating with low/moderate carbonation.  Overall it's decent and I'm glad I tried it, but at $8.99 a bomber I wouldn't buy it again.  I can't say I've had many Gose ales, but I thought most of if not all of the other ones I've tried were better than this was."

"O: I prefer my sour beers to be sour. This is tasty but I think the sweetness is a bit of a detractor. Not bad though, I hope Hoppin' Frog makes more sours in the future"
"Sweet more like a wine cooler one and done"

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lacing cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart lemon, lime, tangerine, pear, apple white grape, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, sea salt, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart lemon, lime, tangerine, pear, apple, white grape, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, straw, grass, sea salt, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, tangerine, pear, apple, white grape, coriander, clove, wheat, bread, herbal, straw, grass, sea salt, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a good malt/tartness/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly acidic/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice gose style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. My only real complaint is that this is obviously not soured with lactic acid bacteria; more likely acid malt or regular acid, but is a very enjoyable and balanced offering otherwise."

"Excellent drinkability, solid flavor (if a tad underwhelming), and a fair price for what it is. My only complaint is that I wish it were more tart, but that's just how I prefer my Gos√©'s. Would recommend to a friend and would buy again."
"Wow. Very impressive. My first Gose, but this far exceeded My expectations. Reminds me of the salty sweet tartness of a matgarita, mixed with the body and mouthfeel of a delicious unflitered wheat ipa. Good stuff!"

"To answer the question on every one's mind.  Does this come close to Westbrook?  Yes, it does.  Is it better?  No.  At least for my personal tastes.  King Gose Home is a great beer and I'm excited Hoppin' Frog decided to experiment with it.  Salty, sweet and slightly tart.  Well done."
