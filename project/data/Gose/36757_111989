What's even more exciting is that Here Gose Nothin' also happens to be damn good. Quite a bit more sour than a traditional gose, this iteration keeps it's flavor profile in line with some of the German classics for a delicious and crushable sour beer!","BeerFMAndy","Dec 20, 2014"

4.25,14.9,,,,,,"On tap for "Sour Night" at The Brew Kettle in Strongsville, Ohio during Cleveland Beer Week 2014.  My first gose, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It reminded me of a Berliner Weisse in terms of tartness, but with the wheat character and chewiness of a wit beer or light wheat beer thrown in.  Very light, clean and refreshing.","Radome","Oct 18, 2014"

Tart lemon, lactobacillus. This wasn't very drinkable to me. Gose is something you can quaff liters of, and this ain't that.","emerge077","Apr 18, 2014"
