"As soon as the bottle opened you could smell a harsh acidity and tartness.  The beer followed that to a tee.  There was a nice brininess to the body of the beer and it was carbed well.  It was just above and beyond the level of sour that I expect from a gose.  The sour level was challenging rather than quenching."
"The incredible lacto tartness and builds up of vinegar flavor is a negative. Any real oyster flavors or aromas are overwhelmed. Subtlety is not in night shift's repertoire."
"It's a gose but not. Tons of lemon and a healthy dose of salt. Unique and well played."

"Seems like Night Shift has their lacto chops down but lacks in the quality control/consistency department of some of their other brews. Berliners and now Gose from Night Shift have all been good so far, lactic excellence. Only thing that turns me off is the build up of that vinegar feel towards the end of my glass."

"O-Goses are wonderful that is all you need to know.  This is another yummy one."

"According to my notes, ""This beer is tasty, give it a good score."" This really is one of, it not the best, examples of a Gose I have ever had. It's nicely sour and tart, and it's not so salty that I felt sick afterward (thanks, stomach). This is worth seeking out."

"What a complex brew. I haven't written a review in a while. I decided I rather had then stare at my phone while with friends trying beers. Felt compelled to write something to recall this one later. Aroma is very sweet but not overly so with notes of pineapple, orange, salt, wet towels and flavor following with salt, more wet towel, perfectly tart citrus, lemon pepper and coriander. Gotta try this one."

"13 oz pour in a goblet at Row 34 8/3/2014. Color somewhere between straw and golden, pours cloudy and opaque. Filmy head. The aroma is a bit muted with sour fruit and seaside tones. Slightly tart twang, the saltiness is barely perceptible. Finishes with a bit of funk. Light body and carbonation."
