"Pours a very hazy honey-gold, thin white head. Sweet wheat and tart lemony sour on the nose. Medium sour with hints of orchard fruits and a nice mineral note in the finish. Medium body, a bit slick, medium-low carbonation."

"Overall - Too salty for me.  Lingers in the aftertaste.  Not offensive, just too much."
""
"Aroma was heavy on the coriander, taste was similar, with an herbal bitterness and tea-like impression due to the heavy handed coriander addition. Also hot dogs. Tart lemon, lactobacillus. This wasn't very drinkable to me. Gose is something you can quaff liters of, and this ain't that."

"O: Bad can? The off-notes were nearly overpowering, any decent flavors were a brief flash between weirdnesses."
"If there was more of a head, and if it was fluffier instead of comprised of tiny bubbles, this would look like a solid DIPA. All orange/shades of amber with a slight golden edged hue to it. Head naturally disappears quickly, leaving nothing but clusters of bubbles ringing the glass. Great nose for a gose (ha, it rhymed!), very bright and zesty, like salad dressing you want to drink. Taste doesn't disappoint, lime zest, vinaigrette dressing, spice, and a great salty finish. Would be awesome with craft mustard on pretzels. Slightly thicker mouthfeel that most gose beers I've had (or remembered), but still refreshingly crisp and effervescent. Really tasty."
"Overall the beer was good for the style. Some fruit notes balance the sourness, light body, good for hot summer days"
"Good overall, rating would be higher but other two sours I had recently were a little better."

"O - Solid Gose that I enjoyed drinking. This is a nice option for warm summer days."
""
"Overall, an excellent beer. Well put together and perfect for a hot summer day."
""
""
"This is a nice Gose. Flavorful with a nice sourness."
""
""
""
"I've recently started enjoying sours. This was worth trying, but honestly the salt in the taste was overpowering. I liked the tart sour character and malty backbone, but just couldn't get past the salt."

"Poured a cloudy orange body with one finger of thick, fluffy white head. A very nice looking beer. Scents of salt water, delicate German malt aromas, a light lactic sourness, light bready malt and a light fruit ester presence. Overall impression of aroma is of a true to form gose, very nice. Flavor begins highly sour, with notes of lemon zest, lemon juice and a slight lactic sourness and a medium-light saltiness balancing the sourness. Middle opens up further sourness along with a light hint of grainy malt. Finish is dry and highly sour with notes of grainy malt, lemon juice and salt water. Aftertaste is sour lactic acid, lemon juice, fading to grainy malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a good Gose that tends more towards the sour side of the style, a good take on the style. Mouthfeel is light bodied with effervescent carbonation and a sour, puckering feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a true to style gose, nothing wrong. Overall this is a good gose. It has a nice sour flavor, fitting the style, keeping the saltiness present and complementary and having an excellent aroma and mouthfeel. A very nice example of the style."

"Solid Gose, mixed with a bunch of funk sourness. I loved it..."

"The aftertaste keeps you puckered up. I am going to follow this with another Anderson Gose, so I hope this stuff doesn't make me sick!"

"Pours amber in color with a fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Smell has aromas of acidic sour aroma with notes of apples pears and coriander. Taste is intensly sour,acidic and somewhat salty. Really intensely sour gose with a mineraly dry finish. Not the traditional gose I was expecting but a good sour bomb non the less."
""
"How do you rate something like this? Says ""gose"" on the can, but doesn't look or taste like a tradition gose. That's not to say it's bad. It's actually, quite good. But not a typical gose. Darker, a bit heavier, it has a meaty aroma and taste. Much less dry with fruit like flavor characteristics. Lots of coriander. Light body and high carbonation."
""

"Poured out the can into a shaker glass.  Didn't get any head, hazy yellowish orange.  The nose is dominated by the vinegary lacto smell, then a little flowery, then some citrus, and I get a little of the coriander.  The taste is the highlight of this beer, almost perfect amount of sour, balanced with a nice malty sweetness, I do get the salt at the end, and there is a little orange citrus too.  The carbonation is a little low, if there was a little more carbonation it would be more refreshing.  Overall an enjoyable beer."
"Overall, interesting beer.  I get a lot more tart sourness than salt or coriander."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 10/13/2014. Pours hazy deep orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, green apple, wheat, biscuit, light honey, coriander, sea salt, white vinegar, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Outstanding aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/acidic yeast, spice/salt, and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, green apple, wheat, biscuit, light honey, coriander, sea salt, white vinegar, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, green apple, coriander, sea salt, white vinegar, wheat, biscuit, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/acidic yeast, spice, and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spice/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic/salty mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding gose style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, spice/salt, and bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Drank this straight out of the can, and man it was great! Strong citrus smells, and the flavor is fantastically balanced for a canned sour."

"The best beer I've had in such a long time and I don't know if I can ever go back."

"Very sour!  Just as good as Westbrook Gose, but a bit less salty."
""

"Really refreshing, salty and tart."

"I don't understand how this could be appealing. It tasted like a homemade batch gone horribly wrong. I just don't get it. My daughter loves it though. She's 22, what does she know?"
""
""
"I would work this into my regular rotation if it wasn't $4 a can."
"Mild Saltiness..balanced malts..nice easy finish. Might be my favorite Gose. Not a big blast of coriander like some Gose(Westbrook)."
"mouthfeel is good and I think its a good sour"

"A little darker in color and saltier than most gose.  Very good, but there are better options."
""

"Received this as an extra and was pleasantly surprised. It's got a great smell with the taste just coming in a little below; like a non-salty version of Westbrook. Overall, really enjoyed it and look forward to more in the future. Destihl Brewery is now on my beer-dar."
"a great gose, maybe the most sour example of the style i have had. so much pucker here, and a bigger malt bill and body than i am used to in the style, more than just wheat, or more deeply toasted wheat that gives both a light amber color and a bunch of body to this. its hazy and weird looking for the style though, and doesnt have a ton of head, it certainly doesnt hold it long. the nose is light on the coriander and heavy on the lacto, sour fermented as much as it is traditional sour mash or kettle sour in its complexion, where is where its mature sourness comes from i have to imagine. the salt is light in the flavor but it adds body and accents the sourness really well. i didnt no know they canned this (or anything), so its cool to imagine it in that context too. ive never had such a sour one of these though, its almost caustic, and hurts the drinkability that the style is supposed to have. its also a little slower down because of all the body, but i cant help but be impressed with this overall, its dynamic and fun, and i will definitely buy it again if i see it around. a little more carbonation would really help, but i like this a lot as it is, appreciably different. bravo!"

"Overall, this is probably my favorite gose to date. It is tart without destroying you with sour and it is incredibly refreshing. I would drink this while mowing the yard all the time in the summer....too bad it's December."

"Destihl Brewery Here Gose Nothin' -----4/5."
"First offering from Destihl.  This is a tart refreshing beer. However, it is not brewed to style and has a bit of an overwhelming lime flavor.  Not sure where to rate it because I usually rate to style.  As a gose, it is 3.00.  As a refreshingly tart beer, it is probably 3.75.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt but Westbrook is far better and Boulevard Hibiscus Gose is more enjoyable.  Worth trying if you come across it."

"So, I guess I learned a thing about prejudice.  Or maybe I didn't.  I still don't like the vibe these guys put off, but I have to give credit where it's due.  This beer is excellent."

"Oh, my heavens!  This is the absolute best Gose I've ever had that wasn't from Germany. This is right up there with Ritterguts! I am a fan of Destihl, but this was just amazing."
""

"If you like sours you will love this   You get an initial love bite right off the bat but then it becomes apparent there is alot of flavor behind it .  I think this is the first Gose I have had in a can so wasn't that excited about it initially but I'm a believer now ,  get some of this"

"Overall: Picked this up on a whim, happy to see it hit our market. To me, this one was slightly better than Westbrook's Gose, which gets a ton of love. Not sure the Midwest is ready t embrace salty sours yet, but we could do much worse than to start by loving this one."

"O - A pretty, delicious, flavorful, higher-abv gose. For me, this outshines every other American gose I've had. Anderson Valley, Westbrook (not by much), Sour Note, the list goes on. Extremely flavorful, tart, salty. Very much a gose, and a lot less like what most microbreweries are doing with goses, blurring the lines between gose and Berliner. Keep it up Destihl, I think this is their best canned release yet."
""
""
""
"Overall:  I think this is a decent Gose. I was really surprised how much this beer tastes like a dill pickle. Which is slightly weird.  Westbrook Gose is far above and beyond this Gose. Dial down the salt and coriander; let the lactobacillus shine through and you will have an outstanding Gose."
""
"Overall: Hell yeah this is one heck of a brew.  Bright tartness is the biggest player but balanced wheat and fruit notes are perfectly complimentary.  Good for you Destihl, knocked this one out of the ballpark (except for using the wrong form of palate in the description on the can but hey no one is perfect)."
