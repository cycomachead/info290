"16.9 oz bottle, pours straw gold w/ slight haze. 1/2 inch head fades, nice lacing on glass. Active carbonation. Smell is wheat, funk, coriander, & citrus. Taste is salt, coriander and citrus, fades to malt and white grape. Clean and very balanced. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and effervescent with a dry finish. Very refreshing. If you've gotten on the gose train try it-very nice without being over the top."
"Ritterguts Original Gose -----4/5."

"Poured a slighitly hazy off yellow with a small head.  Tartness comes through immediately to me and makes this a refresher!"
""
"I have had only a few examples of the style so I figured today would be a good day to revisit it while getting the grill out for the first time this year.Pours into a cylinder a hazed orange tinged light golden with a nice looking white head atop.Toasted grain and slightly metallic in the nose along with some lemon zest.A healthy dose of lemon/lactic brings some sourness to the palate,with me not being a fan of anything very sour it kinda turned me off a little,toasted grain and the hint of salt/brine in the finish.I know the gose is becoming a fashionable style right now but it's not my thing,this is a good example though and I tried to rate accordingly."

""
"Disgusting, not the Gose style I'm used to, tastes like dirty socks"
""
""
"Overall: I can see why this is one of the beers generally recommended as a staple example of the style. This is a nice, well-executed gose, not too overdone on the salt or sour aspects, with a pleasant depth of character. Will repeat."

"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet wheat and light citric tartness, a hint of coriander. Flavor is light wheat, citrus, mild lactic tartness, hint of coriander and salt; interesting light lemon tartness in the finish at the edges of the tongue. Medium bodied with peppery active carbonation. A really nice example of the style, with all flavors handled lightly, but nicely balanced. The tartness is well supported by the wheat body. Both coriander and salt are deftly integrated. I'm not a sour beer fan, but found this nicely made, lightly tart beer to be refreshing and tasty."

"Very solid gose. Literally dissipates in your mouth."
"Lemon zest and yeast with the salt is very nice. A great gose!"

"Had it alongside Leipziger Gose of Bayerisches Bahnhof in Ohne Bedenken in Leipzig. This one is slightly more complex and agressive, sourer and saltier, the other one is more refreshing. Nice beer, but for me the style is much less exciting than, for example, geueze or witbier. Similar to Berliner Weisse. Interesting, unique, must-try for beer geeks - yes, but if that would be the only available beer style out there, I'd drink much more water and wine, for sure."
""
"Pours a cloudy, dirty straw yellow with a white head.  The beer shows active carbonation and a fine, foamy head with plenty of lace.  The aroma is funky, earthy, musty, a bit straw like.  The flavor is nice with some tartness, wheat, straw, hops and lemon peel.  Slightly savory but in no way salty or brine influenced.  This beer is perfect for what it is, it has balance, hops, grain and a bit of that sour that beer loves seek.  A lovely beer and perfection to style.  Would be worth revisiting."
""
""
"Pale orange, slight haziness, and a small white head that lasts for the duration as a ring of bubbles. Fragent tart smell: lemony citrus, apples, flowers, fresh wheat, and brine. Flavor is very light...slight lacto start, green apple tartness, salt, lemon, berries, and grain. Light and quite drying. Nice balance between all the elements."
"Color is light gold...head is small, white, and tightly foamy. Aroma has a hefeweizen like lemony twang with floral, light spice, and fresh salty cereal grains. Taste is clean, lemony, slightly tart, lightly salted, floral, a little soapy, and white bread dough. Dry through the finish, but otherwise fluid and fluffy. Nice Gose indeed..."
"O- Eh.  It might be more true to style than Westbrook Gose, but still not as enjoyable for me."
""

""
"O: Not extreme in any way yet distinct."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Piquant acidity wisps away quickly while ensuring a high rate of refreshment and drinkability while its soft saltiness lingers to highlight echoes of bread dough in aftertaste. Otherwise a light bodied ale, the taste of brine that clings on tightly to the mouth gives the ale an impression of fullness that has a bit more staying power on the palate than expected."
"Big fan of the style and this one did not let me down.  Had it side by side with Lost Nation Gose to compare.  This one was slightly more funky but not quite as clean.  Great beer that I would love to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really love the malt-to-tang ratio in this one. Tang is still on top, but the bready malt character mellows and balances it out."

"My first sour. really enjoyed it. Best way I can personally describe it is if Mead had a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well rounded gose."
""
""
"Overall: A great benchmark for the style, isn't overly tart or malt forward. You get both aspects without one drowning the other out. I would definitely buy more of this in the future when I'm looking for a Gose fix."
""
""

"I can't say that it's perfect for every occasion, or for volume, but it's a perfect situation choice for a hot summer day. The tartness and the saltiness open the tastebuds, and besides it's just a delicious beer. The fiancee really liked it as well--her first gose--and said it was more refreshing than a shandy and tasted much better. 4.25/5"

"I may have missed the salty qualities that the style should have, and a judge might deduct points, but the overall flavor is very nice."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about a half inch off-white head that didn't stick around for too long. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and tart, the brew smells like tart fruit (citrus, apple), wheat, peaches, and some salty herbalness. It tastes like lemon/lemon peel, wheat, earthy herbalness, salt, tart peaches, and tart apples. Moutfheel/body is light/medium, it's tart and refreshing with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, good thing for me I bought 2 bottles! $5.79 a bottle."

"O - Great beer. I really enjoy how different this style of beer is."
""
""

"Smells of tart lacto, big nodes of red cherries. Tastes like cherries up front, corriander and salt near the middle, and it finishes with the sharp esterless-ness you get out of a low-hop european pils. Basically it's like a combination between a good Berliner Weiss and a good continental pilsener, and it's much more balanced than any of the America goses I've drank. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is very tasty â€“ an excellent gose, and an examplar of a style that's catching on at long last. Recommended for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost clear light amber with quick fading white head. Nectarine, lactic with some herbal oakiness and white wine notes. Taste: wheat cracker, lactic with some stone fruit sweetness and tart red grapes, mildly oaky again. Light bodied, building delicate carbonation. Really tasty."
""
""
" The flavor is pretty full of wheat with creamy quality combined with yeast and light salt which supports and doesn't overwhelm with a gentle toastiness in the malt and gentle lemon tanginess which goes with the salt creating an urge to return for repeated sips with that salty berliner type tang you expect. Overall definitely tasty and lovely with delicious wheat and very highly quaffable-one of the best of the style I have had. I appreciate the subtlety -there is not too much going on, very traditional quality yet excellent for the season -a perfect warm weather beer which is quenching and refreshing."
"Overall, a solid take on the style. Could easily be up there with some of my favorites--plenty of tart and salt, but isn't just an overpowering sour bomb. There is actually subtlety of flavor going on here."

"O: I'm no Gose expert, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here and predict this is a pretty accurate take on the traditional style - simpler and subtler than Westbrook's Gose, for example, and maybe not as appealing to a more ""Americanized"" palate, but I found it delightful."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this. Best gose so far to date. The 'sour German beer' comment on the back label is truthful through and though. I'll be looking for this again, no doubt."
"O- A tasty beer, I feel that I will be picking this up some more this summer."
""
"O- glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. I really wanted to love this beer, but it's just not for me."

"It has an uncommon taste for today's brews, but it's quite enjoyable."
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Quite tart, almost within the family of lambics but without the lingering aftertaste. Not nearly as flat as the initial appearance, but the carbonation is still well below my expectations. The body is on the thin side--reminds me of apple juice. Frankly, this is a bit disappointing."
""
""
"Golden yellow in color with a two-finger head that's quick to disappear, leaving a ring of white bubbles around the surface. The smell is briny with coriander, wheat, and bread yeast. It tastes of tart lemon, wheat, and bread, and finishes salty. The combination of sour flavors with salty ones is surprisingly pleasant. The body is light and it's very drinkable."
"Light to medium body. Really good and refreshing. I really like this!"
"Bottle from Proof. Pours a clear straw with bubbly white head that faded pretty quickly to nothing. No wisps, collar, anything. Aroma is grassy and dry yeast tartness. Taste is tart throughout, slightl pear fruitiness, and slightly metallic. Light body and low carbonation. Very drinkable though."

"Though I am pretty inexperienced when it comes to the style, I'd say this is a good amount more sour than the one other I've tried (Lost Nation Gose) - which makes this one a little less refreshing/drinkable, but still a nice interplay of salty&sour and German malt flavor."

"This is excellent. Tart, crisp, refreshing, and delicous."

"For my first encounter with a gose, things went well."
""
"This is a great example of a gose - far more tart and saline than the Freigeist offering I've had several times, and probably a little bit more authentic as doesn't have any spruce added as a major component to the brewing process. It's not mind blowing, but it doesn't need to be. It's refreshing while holding a unique flavor profile and fills itself with subtle flavors and textures. Recommended for those wanting to try a more sour offering of the style that's German brewed - I would say, for the sake of the beer's freshness, that this must be consumed best on tap."
""
"O: Not as refreshing or complex as others examples of the style, so it would not be one of the first Gose beers that I would reach for. Easy enough to drink but just not quite as interesting as others."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink but seems to lack the complexity of some of the top beers in the style."
""
""
"Far more tart than anticipated, this reads more like a sour than other examples I've tried, and is likely the most authentic. Somewhat one note, but I like that note."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the first time that I have sampled a beer of this style and I enjoyed it very much. I usually like beers on the heavy end, but this proved to be an interesting change of pace."

"O-well-balanced and refreshing Gose"

"A bit pricey at $10.99 for a 16.9 oz. bottle at Friar Tucks."

"The beer pours a dark, hazy gold with a fizzy, white, soda-pop head that quickly fizzles away. In body the beer is dark, yet translucent, showing murky, cloudy hints of the other side of the glass, along with a healthy torrent of bubbles. No particles can be seen in the beer. On the nose, the beer smells lightly tart and wheaty, like a wheat flake and a subdued Berliner Weisse. Light saline notes also puff upon the tongue, though I donâ€™t think I would detect them if I didnâ€™t know this was a gose. Lemon citrus is light, yet bright on the nose, giving a nice pop and inviting you to drink the beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes initially tart, nearly puckering, but this mellows into a soft, bready sweetness with just a touch of saltiness, and a deeper earthy sense to suggest that this is a gose. In flavor, the beer begins as sharp lemon-lime citrus, which mellows into sweet lemon, then lemon bread, and then slowly works into a soft, fluffy, wheat flake flavor that finishes soft and comforting on the tongue for a decent amount of time. In the middle of the taste, the earthy and mineral flavors can be distinctly sensed as the lemon citrus dies down. The aftertaste is soft, but distinctly flavored with wheat malt notes. In the mouth, the beer feels fizzy, yet light in body. The carbonation is at soda-levels, with a slightly sharp effervescence that snaps upon the tongue and gives the beer a crispness. The mouth is left wet with acid-canceling saliva on the cheeks and a very soft chalkiness. Overall, this beer is hugely refreshing and very tasty. Itâ€™s not quite as salty as I was hoping it would be, but itâ€™s the first old-world gose Iâ€™ve tried, so I blame new world interpretations for making me expect big salt. The beer is soft, yet nuanced, like a well-crafted ginger ale with alcohol and deeper citrus flavors. Itâ€™s crisp, refreshing, and perfect to slake your thirst in summer. Try this beer."

"From the bottle, it pours a medium golden orange brown with a thin foamy white head. Not much lace clings to the glass and the appearance shows a wheaty haze, but with bright small, champagne-like bubbles rising. There is a slight orange-lemon malty aroma & a crisp but mild tartness, some sweet wheat hefeweis, a little bright lemon soapy snap (coriander) and a nice subtle salt rounding out tongue. A little mild in mouthfeel but refreshing cafÃ© beer for hot day, especially by the ocean. Great refreshing summer sip for those who like sour beers or are open to variety; very few others are similar."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is one that I'd definitely pick up. It has sparked my interest in the style and I look forward to trying others in this style as well."
""

"Yes, I do like it. Too bad I can't order this by the liter."
""

"pour is slightly hazed amber with a filmy white head. The nose has grain notes up front, candied sugar, lemon, light sea salt. Taste is very sour and much more sweet. more lemon and some tangerine. Grain notes are almost gone, salt comes in towards the back of the palate. Light body, very dry assertive carbonated finish."

""

""

"Fairly solid gose, almost like very hard water beer or something, I wish it had a little bit more bready malts and chewy sense though in the palate and flavor. I wouldn't pass this up though, great warm weather beer and one to session nicely also."
""
"O: A very good gose, a bit pricey at close to $6.50 for the pint, but you don't see this style too often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour a pale orange. Quite cloudy, though that's not exactly a surprise after following the label's advice to stir up the yeast before pouring. Foamy white head. Decent retention. Lemony lactic-forward aroma. Some coriander and brine. Some nice fruity malt flavors in the background - apricot and blackberry. Taste is lactic tart with some nice spice and fruit flavors and a salty undercurrent. It's quite yogurty lactic. Like unsweetened yogurt mixed with lemon rind. Little to no malt sweetness and absolutely no hop character. Light to medium mouthfeel. There's a little body to the beer, but it's pretty crisp. The lack of malt sweetness makes the beer feel quite clean. Fun beer. Always nice to find a gose. This would be a fun beer to pair with food."
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight sourness on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and refreshing."
""
""
"a very unique beer, even for the already unique gose style, which I keep hearing pronounced differently, but that's another matter. the pour is cloudy and pale, underwhelming to say the least, but the nose is really inspiring. it smells like a funky wheat beer, almost like a saison, as there is plenty of interesting yeast and some lemony funk, but its also sour I think. a sour gose? hmmmm. the taste does confirm a touch of sourness to this, really different. the salt isn't as intense as in some versions of the style, which is fine with me, its just enough to dry up the finish and keep you asking what the hell this beer is. super different. the wheat malt and the sourness make a clever combination unlike anything ive ever tried. it got too much for me after a bit, and im glad I had help with the bottle. nice feel, well carbonated and a very light body. I think I would like this best as a summer beer. there is so much going on here between the salt and the sour, crank up the alcohol and itd be more like a cocktail than a beer, but its very inventive, and apparently quite traditional at the same time. id recommend this only to the adventurous beer drinker."
""
""
"Overall an interesting beer, well done gose, very refreshing and drinkable."
"This is wonderful. Tough to make a comparison as this is a style that is just hard to find. Overall, highly drinkable and enjoyable if you are one who likes sours."
""
"Poured into a weizen glass. Pours golden with a thick white head and lots of visible tiny bubbles. The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving little splotches of lacing on the side of the glass. There is only the slightest bit of haze in the beer. There are aromas of lemon, barley and wheat malt, and a slight tartness from the lactic acid. The saltiness comes through in the flavor, which combines well with the tartness of the lactic acid. There's the wheat and barley malt flavors as well as the lemon. The body is light with moderate carbonation. There's some tartness in the aftertaste and this beer is very drinkable. This is a very good beer."
""
"This beer poured out as a slightly hazy golden color with a foamy white head on top that faded quickly. There is no retention or lacing on this one. The smell has the lactic acid coming through strong with some subtle wheat but not much coriander. The taste of the beer has a dominant tart flavor up front with a soft wheat finish. The slat and coriander are very subtle. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied, nice carbonation and drinkable. Overall I feel the lactic acid is a little too much on this beer. Perhaps it's just me. Either way it's always fun to try these types of beers to see how they differ. Worth trying."
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ An interesting beer for sure. Lots of tart sour citrus taste but not over the top and in your face. It comes through at the beginning and the end of each sip. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this beer again, but I'm glad to have tried."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy hay color gose with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of tart notes is pretty dominant with some light salty notes also distinguishable. Taste is also dominated by some salty notes with quite strong tart notes. Body is quite full with great carbonation. Not bad but not what I was expecting at all. A lot more tart and lactic acid notes then expected with almost no coriander."
""
"Beer is medium-light to light bodied, with medium to high levels of carbonation for the heft. This makes the beer quite propulsive on the palate, slightly prickly, but generally a fast sipper. The salt adds to the drying effect of the beer itself, making this quite dry, with a bit of stickiness on the mouth after each sip."
"B-"
"Pours a pale yellow color with a tall white head. Not like the other examples of Gose that I've had. There is a slight saltiness to the nose, but it's more lactic than expected. Nice lemon peel and a bit of spice (coriander?) to it. Some sweet malt aroma, too. The flavor is a nice mix of sweet and tart with lemon peel and lactic acidity. A subtle salt and spice flavor is present. Really just light and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O: Good. The only thing missing here is a hint of coriander to help fully round this one out. I think a blend of the two Gose's from the region would be a good drink. This one is preferred though."
"Very pleasant and refreshing Gose, although I would have preferred more of funky goodness."
"In short: An acidic, saline, crisp, dry and very refreshing example of the style that survived the enforcement of the Purity law."
"I would say this is a little bit more traditional than the Bahnhof variety just because I get more of the strong wheat beer taste here, but honestly I think they're both excellent beers. Everyone should make a trip to Leipzig to try them."
"D: If you like sour beers, this is a wonderful one."
"Certainly a very interesting beer, but not one I could imagine drinking regularly."
"Drink again"
"Overall, an interesting and unique style, much less brew. Worth a look if you can find it."
"The bottle looks good, but I don't like this old man on the front label. Fine sourish-spicy aroma. Tastes really good, I think a mix between Berliner Weisse and a hefeweizen - a little bit sourish with woody notes, but also fruity like lemon and apricot. Very refreshing. Very enjoyable!"
"Drinkable and pleasant."
"D_My first Gose and I found it very drinkable. Refreshing, tart and sessionable"
"Overall: What an amazing beer. I had tried the Bayerischer Bahnhof Gose on tap in the States, and this put B-Bahnhof to shame. The lactic acid is assertive but not as dominating as it is in a Berliner Weisse. I suppose it can't be if you want the coriander and salt contributions to come through. And while the salt gave it an earthy quality, it never becomes savory. The salt complements the sweetness of the wheat malt and coriander in the same way that you add salt to cookies and other sweets. Overall there are some unique flavors here that all come together to make something unexpected and remarkable. While B-Bahnhof plays it safe, Doellnitzer/Ohne Bedenken goes all the way to make an incredible beer. If you are anywhere near Leipzig you HAVE to stop by Ohne Bedenken or pick up a bottle in a local liquor store/supermarket."
"Overall and easy drinking beer I'd have again."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Bottle thanks to Chris. Aged prosciutto and faint fennel seed. Pours coarse with yellow gold and silky float of white. Pepper soaked cascade in pink and green with some cinnamon. Very floral with Christmas potpourri and pumpkin over a salty body. Again, unique. Lemon sour towards the back end, with a remarkably crisp and bright finish. Rather astonishing."
"Not hard to drink but does not go down as easily as a wit or heffeweisen. Every sip reveals new flavor nuisances but this complexity becomes cloying after a while."
"Hazy yellow grassy color with a thin white head that recedes quickly. Aroma of buttery corn and yeast. Flavor is initially yeasty, but not overpowering. Flavor evolves to corny malt and finishes crisp with zesty lemon and some spice, sorta peppery. Some spicy lemon lingers. Relatively low drinkability due to the yeast/lemon combo that was a bit much for my pallete."
"drinkability is very low due to the intensity of flavors.. a sipper and i'd probably max out at a 6 oz. serving. good for something different and always relish the opportunity to try new styles."
"Finally found this beer, and got a bonus of it being on sale as ""no one wants to drink that crap"" Well i dont know why as I didnt find anything wrong with it. It pours maybe a shade or two darker than a normal hefe, but not as dark as a dunkle. Not too much head on this one, might be due to the salt. Smell is also reminicent of a hefe with an added spicy element. Taste is smooth at first with the banana and clove esters usually associated with German wheat beers. However at the end the salt is slightly noticable and drys the beer out in the mouth. I had been told that this beer tasted like licking a salt lick, that is not the case. Carbonation is nice, and this one goes down pretty smoothly. Not sure if i would drink a lot of these in an evening, but one or two with dinner would be fine. I will definately give this a shot again"
"This was a very well made beer, unfortunately Iâ€™d set my sights on something absolutely unique, and the Gose style was not."
"Surprisingly hoppy smell. Hazy gold with a nice creamy head. Very visibly carbonated with the carbonation lending a tang to the flavor. Almost takes like a belgian triple, but certainly closer to belgian in flavor than any other german beer. Cloves and banana came through along with a nice malt sweetness. Definitely worth checking out if you can find it."
