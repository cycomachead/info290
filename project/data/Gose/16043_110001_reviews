"The only Gose I've found I liked. Some say it's too salty, not for me. It was refreshing, tart and crushable. This is recommended."
"The nose is tart, citrus peel, yeast, good funk.  It has a very rustic barnyard note.  The flavor is traditional gose, lots of salt, some wood, but I can't place the barrel.  Lemon zest at the end.  This is good, clean, but I never think of a gose as refreshing due to the saltiness.  Fun to try."

"I tried this beer several times, on draft, at The Dew Drop Inn in Derby CT. Its a fantastic sour that left me wanting more. The salt was more obvious the second time I tried it as opposed to the first. I believe we were at the bottom of the barrel the second time I tried it. Anyways, if you can find it in a bottle at the store or see it on draft at a bar then you'd be foolish not to try it."

"Awesome brew. The $22 price tag was a little more than I wanted to spend, but looks like it was well worth it. I'll be buying another bottle or two at some point."

"Glad I had a glass, not a huge fan of sour beers, but this was refreshing and although fairly 'fizzy' it hit the spot after wandering the streets of Rome and getting lost while trying to find a few sights."
