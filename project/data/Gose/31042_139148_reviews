"Little bit of funk up front; tart and fresh with the saltiness kicking in subtlety at the backend.  Decent."

"I've had all 3 batches of this beer.  It has evolved so much, it has that traditional funky smell.  Salty sourness and that beautiful hazy color."
"Very average for a gose.  Probably the worst smelling beer i have ever had, straight up full baby diaper.  I had to struggle through the smell to drink the rest of this one.  If you pinch your nose, it tastes pretty good"

"Pour at a bottle share. Sour bready aroma. Very light golden body. Good tart sweet taste. Slight bitter taste. Pretty good."

"Overall - I do not think it is quite on par with Westbrook, but I would certainly buy this if they canned it."

"Super solid gose. Great earthy and salt notes. Needs a bit more souring and coriander."
