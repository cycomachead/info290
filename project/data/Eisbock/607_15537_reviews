"holy shit suprise. The first of its kind to have such definition. It may be that my palate has been excericed by two bottles of jolly pumpkin but this beer has so much dimensions its unbelievable. Pour is a deduced hef. Head isn't as big... Doesn't last as long. Nose is a mess of things... Toast, smoke, molasses, and earthy minerals in a lace of digestive notes. Licorice and banana equally fused. Palate is rich and lean and a touch of dough. A molasses hef. And astringent notes of mineral and acidic fruit hints. Dark fruit tart. Black berry and dry maple syrup. Bread finish of banana. Too dry to be associated to banana bread. Too roasted yet it still has a lot of carbonation. Its a big brew. With a lot of undertones. The best american eisbock i've had. Wheat rich... But not dominating."
"O - Not so much. I thought this one was ok but not anything mind blowing. The combo of strong flavors and 11% ABV. really make this one hard to drink."
" The taste is fruity and earthy w/ some mild toasted grain and vegetal notes with a lot of wheat cereral-like flavorsfrom the dark wheat and mild fruity almost prune-like element with a light date and dark brown sugar quality. The eisbock finishes with a warming dry finish. A pretty high drinkability score for an 11% beer, but is is not to be taken lightly. The Eisbock has a smooth quality that makes you forget about how strong it is until halfway through, not one I recommend having more than 1 of. I sipped on this for a while, a pretty good example of the style."
"Drinkability: Damn good despite the abv."
"Ok, since I am lazy, I'll just direct you to please read my (glowing) review of Ramstein Winter Wheat...then multiply that times ten. Despite pouring with very little head, modest retention, and decent lace, if you close your eyes, the aroma of dark chocolate mixed with modest alcohol essence will have you thinking that you're smelling a Russian Imp Stout. The taste also revealed hints of dark fruit and caramel, but the chocolate and roastiness dominates, and the finish on this beer I found to be slightly dryer than the Winter Wheat. Again, the alcohol is definitely more noticeable in this offering (and expectedly so), but it blends well with the dark fruit/chocolate/malty balance. Thick and smooth on the palate. Once again, another dangerously drinkable offering by this brewery. Give someone your car keys when drinking this."
"D: Not really. Nice flavors but it just don't quite come together."
"Poured a dark brown, pretty hazy and opaque. Head didn't last long but left a few trails of bubbles here and there. My initial thought was that is was slightly reminiscent of Aventinus, which is confirmed that it's basically a weizenbock with the ice distillation. Wheaty twang with lots of plum, raisins, and caramel. Alcohol is well hidden, only shows as a warmth in the throat. Wonderfully chewy and raisiny. Banana and clove with a touch of vanilla and a woody earthiness... how strange, is this oak aged? Regardless, it is a complex flavorful malt bomb on your palate and everyone needs to try this at least once."
"drinkability is good. nice balance, but the low carbonation does detract from it somewhat. not quite as much depth and complexity as in some eisbocks, but still pretty tasty."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Pretty smooth for the ABV, just a bit of warmth. Just lacking the complexity I hoped for, but still really nice stuff. Thanks Alan!"
"D: Wow. Amazing. No hint of the ABV at all. Probably the best eisbock I have ever had. Would love to try the rasberry one side by side with this one since it has been a while since I have had it."
"Way to easy to drink this one. It may be 11.5 percent but I'd never guess from the taste. I nursed my way through a 16 oz growler that I shared a bit of with the Mrs. and If I had a 32 we would be on our faces. Delicious and sneaky stuff."
"Pours a rich ruby brown color with a very small wisy off white head, not much of a head at all. The aroma is of dark fruit, booze soaked cherries and raisins followed by scents of clove and banana. Nice aroma, not overly strong. The flavor is of alcohol vapors, clove and banana, followed by a solid roast malt flavor. It seems to lack a depth of character. Some of the dark fruit pops up in the end as well as a sour cherry note. A moderate body with very soft carbonation; finishes with a sour bitter bite. Though I did get a bit of an alcohol presence in the taste, this eisbock doesn't taste overly boozy or cloying. It could use some more clove and banana flavors but the flavors that are there are good."
"12 ounce hand bottle. The beer pours a dark brown color with no head. The aroma is dark fruit and caramel malt with some alcohol. The flavor is dark fruit, alcohol, caramel and some chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"D: Excellent drinkability. High alcohol and insane complexity make this one a slow sipper."
"Nice one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and mostly flat. The carbonation levels do seem appropriate though and match the flavor profile nicely. Drinkability is high for a beer of this ABV. I would have guessed it was closer to 7% if I didn't already feel the strong buzz kicking in after around 16 oz. or so. This is definitely a solid beer and one that I would like to drink again."
"d- for a beer thats 11.5% this stuff goes down like nothing, easy to drink and very bold and full of flavor. wish this stuff was more widely available."
"D - This is extremely drinkable stuff - I was worried 64oz would be too much, but it went quickly with everyone seeking out refills. It's not quite as good as the Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock, but it was much more sessionable (as much as any Eisbock can be sessionable I suppose). Worth seeking out, especially as proof that high-gravity German-style beers needn't be malt bombs."
"D - 11.5%? For real? This is crazy good and the alcohol is not there at all as far as I can tell (until I finish a couple of glasses, at least)."
"D: Scary drinkable. You know the booze is there you know it is a high abv beer but your cant help yourself with this great beer."
"Drinks easy for the style & abv, but I'm sure this one would reward you with a stellar hangover if you stayed on it past a liter of it, beware! To me this is easily the most eclectic eisbock I've had & the star of the trade (so far)! I bet this would drink so great by a fire in ski country, went down a treat on a fairly warm night in the NC piedmont!"
"Expectations were high, & I stuffed my bag with growlers(of course), but fuck me if I just pass up their great Winter Wheat from now on with a snobbish ""meh"" & just pester for this throughout the year."
"Oh and head retention and lacing are superb!"
"unreal how good this one really is. I am simply floored. I knew it was going to be a stunner, but wow. I would want this one on tap every day of the week, it is just that damn good. Big thanks to mIke for getting me this, soo worth it."
"D- Well the verdict is out and this stuff is top-notch. 11.5% is nothing to take lightly but barkeep, can I get another? Dangerously drinkable, I will look forward to having this treat whenever possible."
"Pours black with a brown head. Nose is molasses, raisins, alcohol, smoky tone. Flavor is boozy, yes. Raisins, figs, soyish tones, fight over that and clearly show. Watered down coffee liquor tones are there too. Overall pretty intense. Feel is smooth on liquid. Carbonation is slightly nibbling, but overall a bit subdued. This is a nice beer. Due to the style rarity, I suppose I won't really ever have the kind of exposure to it that would leave me highly educated. But this certainly doesn't suck. Just be prepared for a unique drinker and something that is pretty intense."
"Mouthfeel is probably a hair over-carbonated. Just a bit too fizzy. Medium bodied. Was slightly underwhelmed by this one, which is surprising, given the amazing rep I'd had from it. A previous growler was better, this one seems past its prime after only a few days in the glass."
"I was fortunate to get a growler of this from the brewery. Poured it into my Duvel glass and the color was very dark almost black. Has the aromas sweet malty notes, hints of chocolate maybe caramel. The taste is incredible because there is so much going on. Once again hints of chocolate and caramel with a distinctive malty sweetness, possibly hints of licorice and it leaves you wanting more after the lingering flavors leave your palate. The mouthfeel is like a beefed up winter wheat. I'm not sure how much I could drink this in one night, thankfully I split the growler with my buddies as this one filled me up rather quickly."
"Good malt taste with a licorice aftertaste to it...slightly chocolate. Despite its high alcohol content, it's a nice balance that goes unnoticed. I'm not familiar with Winter Wheats, but this was quite good."
"D: This beer rates ""exceptional"" for this category because the aroma and taste are both so interesting and the alcohol, though 11.5%, is almost absent. SO drinkable. Couldn't be better."
"Very dark brown with a thin skim of tan foam. Not much in the way of lacing, but that's to be expected. Malty, caramelized sugar aroma with some dried fruit and vanilla notes. Toffee flavour up front with some raisin and alcohol, light chocolate and vanilla. Alcohol showed up towards the end and there was a hint of smoke present. Full bodied with low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Quite good and very drinkable for how robust it is."
"By the way, the official name of this beer is Ramstein Ice Storm Eisbock. Not sure if it was changed recently or not."
"An outstanding eisbock. Complex and potent, yet smooth and drinkable. A wonderful winter wheat ale. Thanks again John!"
"Overall, I'm a fan. Just wish we could get more of it!"
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is spicey, with hints of the fruit and chocolate and a stickyness that seems appropriate with this concentrated brew."
"Poured a dark mahogany color with a light tan, quickly dissapating off white head, that left spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate, nuts, bananas, roast, smoke, and dried fruits. Chocolate, wheaty taste, more dried fruits, with lots of sweet malts in the taste. Peppery alcohol, very nice."
"Ruby coke brown, light quickly fading head. Strong coffee and tobacco aroma, very dry, enough that it creates a ashes-like aspect. Gentle woody component accompanies dark bitter chocolate, cocoa even. I must say Im a bit shocked at the almost total absence of any fruit hints. The malt is there most definitely, big, thick, but perhaps a little too dry for the beer to deserve its praise in my mind. Focus of flavours seems to be geared toward coffee, cigar and roasted chocolate. A beany aspect also gets uncovered after a few sips and bring up a vegetal tone that I could live without. Medium bodied, light to moderate carbonation level. Lets sum it up by saying this is a very stoutish eisbock which doesnt wear its 11.5% at all."
"I have had the Aventinus recently, and this is WAY different. Aroma is nearly the same as the regular Winter Wheat. Clovey/chocolately and no real hint of alcohol. There is a slight and lasting head that is nice and brown. The color is pitch black. Now the fun begins. Flavor is smooth and creamy, almost to the point of being light and fluffy. Chocolate nmalt flavors dominate over the alcohol to the point of making this beer deadly. Where the Aventinus removes enamel, this satisfys one's thirst for beer. Wonderfully balanced and drinkable, perhaps the best Eisbock that I have ever tried."
"Thanks again to yen157 and vidaloca."
"Extremely dark beer and very thick. It has a thick head which isn't huge but lingers. The smell is somewhat similar to many wheats with the presence of bananas but one can also smell the presence of alcohol.The taste contains the banana flavor. As far as mouthfeel is concerned, it is thick but goes down smooth. This is very drinkable but has a high alcohol content, so a few of these might have you feeling it."
" The body is full with mild carbonation and a very rich and smooth mouthfeel. It is nice and hearty; I guess you could say chewy. Roasty flavors are huge in this one, more so than in the Winter Wheat. The toasted wheat flavors are also in tall order. Bits of chocolate are in there as well, although they are hidden a bit in the mass of complexity. Dark fruits meet with currants and hints of clove in the finish before it gets nice and dry for the aftertaste. The aftertaste is toasted and lingers for a bit (longer than you want to wait for your next sip). The alcohol is nearly invisible, but you can find it here and there. This is a work of art."
"Great viscosity, carbonation, everything. Damn near perfect. This is a beer perfectly suited for a nightcap, not for its strength, but because of its finesse and elegance."
"Backwash: After a few false starts, I was very happy to get my hands on some of this. It was worth the effort. As I mentioned, this just became available, and the kegs were heavily carbonated and extra-cold in preparation to fill growlers, so more impressions are likely. All I can say is that rarely have I enjoyed a liquid lunch so much! This beer is the essence of craftsmanship. If you get a chance, visit the brewery and you’ll see the attention lavished on all of their products."
