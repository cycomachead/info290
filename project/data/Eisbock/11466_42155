3.97,0,,,,,,"D - While I don't have a whole lot of Eisbock experience, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Nice representation of the style overall. It's great to see this little brewery tackling a more obscure style that you don't see very often.","ffejherb","Beers"
4.7,0,,,,,,"D - Excellent beer. Hats off to you Roger. Excellent, would love to challenge you with getting the alcohol notes out of there, but difficult with a 12% ABV.","MisterClean","0"
