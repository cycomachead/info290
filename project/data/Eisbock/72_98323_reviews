"I really enjoyed the Cuvee Barrique from Schneider & Sohn, but this one just doesn't do it for me. I applaud their creativity with this series, but I think this beer could have been done much better. I certainly wouldn't purchase it again at the high price."

"Overall this is another phenomenal offering from Weisses Br√§uhaus G. Schneider & Sohn. Everything they do is exceptional and this is no exception. A perfect example of a an eisbock. I highly recommend trying this one."

"O - Figs not raisins define this wonderful example of an eisboch."

"The beer displays a dark brown / burgundy body, appearing nearly still. Nice aroma, featuring port, sherry, oak, dark fruit, plums, figs. Smooth and complex. This one drinks like a port wine or after dinner digestif. Alcohol presence is there, but not overpowering by any means. Light to medium in body with no carbonation. A fun beer to sip and enjoy."
"This was a recommended pick from my local craft beer store geek. Although the bottle is 11.2 oz, I suggest you share this in sherry glasses and not a full glass pour. Very rich. Would be a great after dinner beer to share with a group of friends."

"The complex ale really shift from sip to sip to give new flavors and textures along the way. But as it tells a remarkable story, its sour twang pushes it slightly over the edge as it begins to impede drinkability and its sultry malt character."
"Overall: Was excited to try this, as Eisbocks can be so hard to come by! It was therefore disappointed by the lightness of the flavor and aroma, as well as by the lack of melanoidins. The banana/bubblegum/clove combination was strong enough to have fooled me into thinking this was a Dunkelweizen. Still, this was a tasty beer with some interesting characteristics to keep a sipper occupied."

"Definitely sip this beer. If you can chug a mug of this beer and survive, you're a better man than I am. Or Woman. Did I mention boozy?"
"Overall: Interesting stuff. Wine barrel aging definitely mellowed this out and added some additional complexity. Biggest complaint is that it was completely flat. While flat can work for some beers, a little carbonation would have gone a long way on this one."
"Overall: The maturity in the pinot noir barrels makes this beer delicious and balances out the sweetness qualities well. I'm going to have a hard time finding this one again."

"O: This is a very pleasant sipping beer-it definitely tastes strong-but the alcohol does not detract from the taste."
