"O: I was very pleasantly surprised by this. It did have some overt booze to it, but nothing egregious and all-around enjoyable."
"O: Aside from being a little over carbonated this was a wonderful beer and definitely a great first impression to the brewery. Loved the flavor."
"D - While I don't have a whole lot of Eisbock experience, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Nice representation of the style overall. It's great to see this little brewery tackling a more obscure style that you don't see very often."
"D - Excellent beer. Hats off to you Roger. Excellent, would love to challenge you with getting the alcohol notes out of there, but difficult with a 12% ABV."
