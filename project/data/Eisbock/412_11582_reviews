"O - Not a ton of depth, but intense flavor profile and the price is right."
""
"O:  a fun quaff for sure and possibly enough different from other eisbocks that it is worth seeking out (and would make for a good addition to a tasting event); the 9.2% ABV is 100% hidden ... pound-for-pound, it's the biggest, most well-hidden alcohol in any beer I've tried ... amazing."
""
""
"Malty aroma has a strong overtone of caramel, rather sweet. Pours a barely translucent chestnut with a fairly thick tan head. Mouth-filling flavor has a malty core with notes of caramel and cloves, a hint of fruit, a fairly strong alcohol bite, rather sweet. Somewhat syrupy texture has a fair amount of fizz and leaves a sweet, edgy, malty finish. Prosit!"
"F: Medium body with an alcohol burn"

"Very malt, not my bag"

"A beast and true to the style. Perhaps a bit more malt flavor would be nice as the fruits are dominant but would I purchase this in the future? Surely."

"O - In some ways I prefer this to Aventinus Eisbock just because it's so smooth and easy-going, but in comparison this lacks in the flavor department. Good flavors and balance going on but just feels kinda muted/plain."

"12oz. bottle served in my New Belgium Globe chalice.  2351202 indicated on the back label.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, half inch, off-white head that dissipates towards the shoulders leaving a soapy slick in the center.  Nose is quite rich - vinous notes and cocoa.  Taste follows nose; however, it comes off a bit duller.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a light acidity.  Not sure that I've ever had an eisbock at this point; however, I found this beer decent but a bit lackluster."
""
"Exceptional beer. Not overly complex flavor but sometimes, that's a good thing. But the flavor is sharp and just REALLY good. Thanks to the Germans for this happy mistake of a beer"
""
"The finish is semi dry and s the sweetness fades there is a light bitterness that lasts for a few minutes. Overall a tasty and satisfying beer that will surely leave a lasting impression. I would have rated this higher but I suspect I bought a fairly old example that was warm on the shelf and exposed to in store lighting. No bad flavors to report just slightly subdued flavor from what I was expecting. There is possibly a bottled on date but it was just numerical and not readily decoded."

"Kulmbacher Eisbock has a very thick, beige head, thick lacing rings, and a clear, dark, ruby-brown appearance, with lots of rapid bubble streams. The aroma is of rich, dark-roasted barley malt, chocolate powder, cream, and a faint odor of coffee grounds. Taste is of very rich, sweet chocolate, chocolate powder, dark-roasted malt, dark fruit, brown bread crust, and there is a slight hop bitterness. The alcohol really shows itself here, especially as it warms down the throat. Mouthfeel is mostly medium and smooth, and Kulmbacher Eisbock finishes dry, sweet, and boozy. Overall, this is just fantastic, and I rate it world class! RJT"
"06/19/13 At Rattle N Hum, NYC, from bottle. Very syrupy. On the malty side. Nice balance of sweet & bitter. seems to have a long aftertaste of strong coffee, Viennese style, strong, bitter, refined. Definitely a cold weather brew but since I've never come across it, now was the time. Grab one when you can. Superior drink but not for the faint of heart."
"Sugar cane and dark berries with hints of alcohol. Small traces of coffee beans."
"Smooth, distant chocolate tones with a nice finish and a light lacy head."

"O: Very nice and complex with plenty of different notes. Everything seems a little intensified because of the freezing process, which of course makes sense. Definitely gets me interested in other beers in the style (even if some people consider it a pseudo style because of the freeze distillation and thus not even a true beer)"

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/23/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, brown bread, cherry, raisin, prune, fig, light chocolate, and toast/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, light chocolate, and toast/yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, light chocolate, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent eisbock style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall – This is a very nice Eisbock with tons of sweetness and a good roastedness.  A rather tasty and big sweet brew."
""
"Review according to BJCP 2008 guidelines (style 5D). AROMA: strong malt aroma with some notes of dried plum and alcohol. APPEARANCE: dark brown with average retention due to high alcohol content. ivory colored head. TASTE: very rich sweet malt flavour with notes of dried grapes. smooth alcohol presence with a finish of malt and alcohol. PALATE: full smooth body with a bit of alcohol warmth. medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: a very strong, full and enjoyable Eisbock. Recommended."

"Mouthfeel: I find the beer to be less syrupy then other eisbocks that I have tried. But it clearly follows the style. Medium in body light in carbonation."
""
""
"Has a moderate malt richness, but makes up for it in creamy flavors of vanilla and chocolate that make it a trip for a hot sundae. Surprisingly also not much banana which would be right sometimes to style as with some doppels I've had but this one eschews that ester which makes it more enjoyable for me. Drinks so easily, wonderful beer."
""
"Overall, a good example of the eisbock style, very easy to drink. Thank you Shelton Brothers for importing yet another excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 3/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast, alcohol, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight caramel malt, hint of syrup, hint of hop, and. Fits the style of a Eisbock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, alcohol, yeast, slight caramel malt, slight hop, and hint of pale malt. Overall, malt-centric, balanced, the alcohol warms to a pleasing degree, and another good brew from Kulmbacher."

"This is Korbinian with a slightly better mouthfeel. I just can't get into the dark fruit doppelbocks anymore, and this one is par for the course, ho-hum doppelbock. Taste isn't very exciting, nothing different vs. Korbinian or Celebrator, and this is an Eisbock with a relatively low ABV."
""
""
"O - This is a solid and tasty eisbock. Not as good as Aventinus but who cares? It's still enjoyable and worth seeking out if you're in the mood for this style."

"Overall a superb eisbock, very rich and flavorful. Could only really drink one in a sitting though."

"O - The originators of certain styles always seem to maintain their beer's status through the ages, especially when it comes to German breweries and Kulmbacher Eisbock, the original Eisbock, is no exception. This heavily malty beer pulls off a ""big"" beer with little awareness that it's a big beer. The alcohol level just over 9% slips by almost unnoticed as does the fullness of the beer, due to it's complex but relaxed profile of dark fruit, caramel sweetness, and bready malt. Kulmbacher is a beer that effortlessly warms the bones on a cold winter day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark, end of the SRM scale. Not much of a head. Aroma is definitely malty-sweetness, caramel. On initial taste, very cold temp attributed to med-high spikey carbonation feel in the mouth. As I let it warm to room temp, the carb dropped and viscosity became thicker. Left very little lace. Hops are absent on aroma and taste. High alcohol in taste and afterwards, left a very warming effect. I don't drink a lot of Eisbocks but this one will be worth another purchase in the future. One in a session is good enough based on the high ABV."

"O: Really nice eisbock. Big malty notes as you'd expect. Well balanced with no real alcohol in the flavor. Smooth and easy drinking despite the sweetness and strength. Honestly a delicious brew."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in an 11.2 ounce brown glass long-neck style bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O: Wanted the Schneider Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock, but they didn't have it. I 'settled' for this, but ended up very pleasantly surprised by this complex brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall its a pretty flavorful ice house kind of beer but not really something I would seek out again. Guess I am more of a fan of doppelbocks."

"One of the more complex and interesting beers that I've had the pleasure of tasting. The Eisbock was dark and rich with the obvious presence of the 9.2% alcohol. Definitely a little sweetness, plenty of roasty flavor, caramel, and Germanic beer fruit notes. Wonderfully balanced and very drinkable in spite of the heavy nature of the beer."
""
"I'm hard-pressed to notice a big difference between this eisbock and some of those big, bold doppelbocks I also love and crave. And this is a good thing! This eisbock is big and bold in flavor and character, and for a high ABV beer, does a supremely excellent job of balancing things out. Most definitely a good beer for a cold, late Spring winter storm while the hardwood fire burns in the fireplace...and I can easily think of other occasions where I would enjoy this powerhouse beer...!!!"
""
""
""
"All in all, a very nice beer, strong but balanced, if a little malty and sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is smooth with a medium-full body. It has a subtle carbonation that massages your tongue."
""
"M: pleasant smooth malt roll, however, a few notches more dry in the finish than desirable - ends up being much more drinkable for it, though....mild+ bitterness seems to distract from silky bliss....more body (at least) would be nice"
"O- Having never had an eisbock before I went in expecting this to be very sweet, boozy, and sticky. I really enjoyed this beer, very nice balance of sweetness and toastiness. Incredibly drinkable for the ABV as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown to black with two fingers of head. Head lingers well and provides some lacing on the glass. Dark, chocolate malts dominate the aroma with some sweetness present. Taste has a bitter pop up front but followed with a maple syrup and slightly present chocolate through the middle to back - the sweetness enhances towards the back and becomes richer. Nice brew."

"O/D-At $2.25 for a 12-13oz. bottle, this is well worth it. A $2.50 buzz. Struggling to find critical words for this beer. Cheap, surprisingly agreeable and fun."

"O: Goodish beer, mediocre eisbock. I would not have again and would recommend the Aventinus Eisbock in its stead."
""
"O: I’m not sure I could handle a six-pack of these. A flavorful, alcoholic bock that goes down like water? I’d be ruined in a half-hour. Hell, I couldn’t even keep this one in my glass for more than 10 minutes, and I was consciously trying to sip it – the sign of great beer."
""
"D: some tasty lager from germany. im sort of a sucker for Eisbock's cause of all the flavor. so many directions, definitely an enjoyable brew."
"The aftertaste keeps the sweet malty thing going with a little bit of rauch (roasty smoke). I like it and would like to drink it again. Actually, I intend to try others of this style - this is easier drinking than most double bocks and such."
""
"Cheers!"
""
"My sample was the Kulmbacher Eisbock version, same ABV 9.2% so I assume this is a legitimate version of the Reichelbrau. My experience with eisbock must be in relation to doublebock since that is what I know. This beer is excellent, clean taste and really a bud tickler, not too much of anything (like carbonation, molasses flavor or hidden spice) and all within the beer itself, no overwhelming factors. That is such a tricky thing to pull off, so many of us are ready to pounce on ""boring"" but believe me, this beer is not boring, and well worth a good try, if of course you are favoribly disposed to doublebocks. They are definitively German after all, so not for the less than bold taste buds, but if you like a nice crisp bock, on the higher alcohol level, this is a solid yes recommendation, this beer is unique and delicious."
"Overall this brew was worth the wait. It has aged quite well and possesses some wine like qualities. I have only had a couple samples of this style and so far i am totally impressed!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. For being 16 years old, this brew is seemingly timeless. I have picked up on more signs of oxidation and age in beers that are only 1/4 as old as this one. This is a fantastic display of a beer that can last the test of time if cellared properly. Fantastic stuff. Now to get a brand spanking new bottle to have as comparison."
""
"O: Outstanding. Wish I'd gotten the sixer instead of just one."
""
"Pours dark brown to black with a off tan small head. Aroma dark caramel and roasted malt, as well as in the taste. Some nice dark fruits, plum, dates, figs as well rounding out the taste. Smooth going down and great carbination. The Alcohol is really well hidden a really great beer"
""
""
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours dark caramel brown with a light tan head and plenty of tiny bubbles in the glass. The head dissipates moderately quickly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of dark roasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor follows the aroma very well. There are dark roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate, and the alcohol comes through in the flavor as well. It has a nice sweet flavor along with some back end bitterness. The body is light medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean and smooth. The beer is a sipper with good alcohol warmness, but it is very easy to gulp this flavorful beer. This is an excellent beer that I recommend trying. I agree with a previous reviewer that this beer has the complexity of a solid Belgian quad with the qualities of a solid lager."
""

"Germany has been going through a beer de-evolution, however not in this case. The Kulmbach brewers hit this ball out of the atmosphere in every way. This beer was the best thing I have ever drank and edged out a Robert Mondavi Cab worth over $300, and 30 year old Highland Park which are my second and third respectively. I often fantasize about taking a trip to Germany just for this beverage because for my taste buds this beer was rapturous and cathartic."
""
""
""
"Overall, still boozy and rough, but in the most glorious way possible."
"T: Raisin, dark malt, rye, dark chocolate and a touch of peat on the finish. Alcohol is a bit evident but the mouthfeel makes this super drinkable."
"This beer was freaking amazing. Smell was old, malty, woody, smoky malt. Taste was unexpectedly dry. Very little sweetness for such a strong, dark beer. Woody, smoky flavour was still there. Just the right amount of bitterness was present, seemingly all from roasted malt. I didn't taste any hop flavour (thank god). Very thin and refreshing, yet the alcohol was still very well disguised. Not sure how with such moderate bitterness and low sweetness. This is simply an amazing beer. The only eisbock I've ever had, so not sure how it compares to others, but I am thoroughly impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid, a nice change of pace."
"O: wow, I've never had an eisbock, but this is spectacular at least by the smell and taste. I liked the appearance as well, slightly unique to me with the lacing doing what it did. Of course, I would have this again and am really intrigued by eisbocks."
"Poured a dark brown with a thick, creamy tan head. The aroma was of toffee and molasses with some raisin. The taste was a mix of fruity flavors, some raisin, fig flavors. It had the complexity of some Belgian quads with the drink-ability of a good lager. This was my first of this style, and I would definitely buy this one again."
""
"This beer pours a clear, deep brown with dark ruby tones under the light. There's no head or lace. It's aroma is of dark cherries with a hint of dark chocolate. The flavor is sweet malt with cherry cough syrup, dates, and a vinous backbone. The mouthfeel is warm and syrup like with a full body. Kulmbacher Reichelbrau Eisbock is a very good beer, recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, dark fruits, and some alcohol aromas. Taste is also of dark malt and dark fruits with some nice toasty/roasty flavors on the finish. There is a definite alcohol kick in the throat with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good eisbock that is tasty and dangerously drinkable."
""
"O: While Kulmbacher's Eisbock may be ""the original German Eisbock," I didn't find it to be exorbitantly interesting - nor was there the hidden layer of complexity that I was looking for."
""
""
"Overall: this is a very tasty and enjoyable beer. Not really sessionable, but tasty enough to warrant having again."
"Overall; Very drinkable, thou not as heavy as color makes it out to be. ABV is balanced nicely here. Would recommend trying thus beer."
""
"I think this is how one of these should taste, well done."
"O: Excellent drinker that goes down very easy. Good sipper on a cold eventing. Well worth a try."
""
" A real treat, the best eisbock I've had this far. Well worth the $3. I can't believe how hidden the alcohol was. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich dark brown with and orange hue. This offering starts with a finger of head, but there is little to no retention. Dark fruits are distinctly present in the nose. Sweet malt along with some caramel are upfront in the taste. The finish is nicely bitter with a bit of an alcohol bite at the very end."
"Overall: For my first eisbock, this was actually better than I thought. What a great introduction into this style of beer that is not attempted by too many breweries. Will have more of this again in the future."
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down good and has nice flavor. It is a little bit of a sipper, but i wouldn't mind a couple glasses of it. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer. It is my first Eisbock, but I am looking forward to trying more. I recommend trying this one out. A tasty and new beer experience that I think you will enjoy. Got it for about 2 bucks as well, so you can't beat that."

"Obtained from Michael Jackson's Beer Club Jan 2012."
""
""
"In short, a malt juice (not in a negative way) with toasty-bready qualities, dark fruits and warming alcohol. (330 ml, BB date 10-26-2010, into small chalice.)"
"O: Very enjoyable and matched nicely with dinner of sausages."
"O - I really enjoyed this. Great flavors and a nice mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable."
""
"O: I enjoy this but wish I knew I had a fresh bottle. No freshness date on the bottle I had, but assuming it's slightly dated. Would easily try this again. Great for the winter."
"Notes: This packs quite a mighty wallop an incredible tasty beer as well as being a hearty meal in a bottle. Cheers."
""
""
"O-a lot of flavor and complexity in this one could make it a go to beer"
"This is a an import by Shelton Brothers, Belchertown, Ma. and doesn't appear to be the same beer pictured. This is a 9.2% bottling."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Full flavored and delicious, as an eisbock should be."
"O- Somewhat disappointing to me. This beer is certainly NOT an Aventinus Eisbock. No way. No how. Smells better than it tastes."
""
""
""
""
"definitely worth seeking out, it's a great eisbock."
"overall - this might be another go to beer for my malt fix however it is a little pricey"
""
"I'm really glad I picked this up. It is rich and complex. Almost nothing like the few American examples of the stye I've tried."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a nice strong beer to drink for a while if you like the heavy sweetness."
"O: Malt bomb with the added complexity of the fruit and smoke. I really enjoyed this as it reminded me of a Belgian Dark. Great effort and worth the expensive price of the sixer. Target this."
""
"Overall it's a good beer. This is the first eisbock I've had, so I'm definitely curious to check out other beers in the area. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"OMG what a malt bomb this is. looks like dark red irish beer but has no hops to be found. All malt here. smells of coco and toffee by far. taste is oily and heavy on the palete. A whole new world of beer for me. overall ok but need to sample others of this style to gain more information and compare. cheers"
""
""
""
"Overall: Very malty which for me is not very drinkable but still on point for the style"
"O: A good beer. A tad boozy for me. Although I like that it don't burn like a lot of other boozy beers. Love the mouthfeel of Eisbock's."
"My first eisbock and what a boozy doozy it is. This pours a heady, bready, warm dark brown. Big malty nose with a lot of booze—that is, I can definitely smell the alcohol. It runs hot, but not horribly so. A slow sipper. Let it warm. Picking up a lot of stone fruits with each subsequent taste. Dried stone fruits. Figs, plums and above all dates. Sweet and strong, like a dessert wine."
"Overall this is a great beer. My first time trying an Eisbock (that I can remember anyway) and if this is a good representation of that style then I expect i'll be looking to try others."
"Overall: A fine depiction of an Eisbock. Malty, pleasing in its ways, yet ass kicking through and through."
"Overall: Pretty decent Eisbock but lacks some complexity."
"Atmosphere is ok. Body is very dark, a mediocre head, and no lacing. Nose is a full combination of malt and sweet components. Flavor is robust and malty with a heavy bittersweet component. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Comments: This was a staff pick at BeerCrazy, Urbandale, IA (homebrew/Beer afficianado type place). It was a good pick, and with staff picks, that certainly doesn't happen all of the time. I really liked the complexity of the beer and to my knowledge that's what a bock, or an Eisbock in this case, should be."
"As one would expect, heavier than a regular bock, a bit slippery though, perhaps needed a bit more carbonation."
"Overall: I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one until now. Super solid and a great example of the style. This would be a nice beer for a cool, spring evening; however, since it's available year-round, I think it would be great for the winter too. The weight may slow me down a little bit, and the ABV would certainly be a factor to consider if I wanted more than one, but it's definitely worth the purchase."
"Unfortunately I tried this one after having tried the Schneider Aventius Eisbock. This is still a good beer, and benefits from a different set of noticeable aromas and flavors, but Aventius is simply an awesome taste experience that this one can't quite stand up to."
"O: A good beer. Complexity not too high and the flavors are good. I'd buy this again."
"o - Overall a decent beer. Not my favorite, but a really nice mouthfeel and pretty easy to drink. Woudl give another shot."
"Medium brown head with some reddish highlights, tan head, no visible carbonation with quick dissipation and minimal lacing. Uh oh, another oxidized beer, notes of butt sweat and cotton candy instead of wet cardboard, some floral hops. Taste mirrors the nose, this had some noticeable complexity re turbinado sugar and floral hops that were subterfuged by the oxidation. Too bad, this was the one Eisbock that wasn't so fricking boozy as to be almost undrinkable. On a positive note, I might try this as some future date, but for the foreseeable future, no Eisbocks for me."
"Even with a very gentle pour, I still got a finger of light-tan head, albeit rather briefly. The color is simply marvelous - a deep, dark-brown with NE-quality clarity and garnet highlights. The nose smelled of dried dark fruits, like raisins and prunes, along with a burnt caramel sweetness. Oh my! I saw where someone else drank one of these as the last thing that night and given some of my days and nights of late, this might be the last thing I would drink, ever, if I did it late in the evening. Danger, Will Robinson, danger! Proceed with caution. Mouthfeel was big and creamy with an initial burst of caramel sweetness and alcohol heat on the the tongue, subsiding into dried dark fruit. Finish was likewise initially hot, then giving way to a caramel sweetness that lingered well after the swallow. Whew! One at a time, please! Other than its drinkability, this was a phenomenal beer. I love when they get rid of that pesky water to make room for what really counts - alcohol! As it warmed, it also began to take on the scent and taste of dried tobacco, especially cigar tobacco. Wild! The more that I roll this around in my mouth and mull it over in my mind, I fully agree with the previous reviewer's, flipper2gv, assessment of it as a Quad-like beer. Well-played, sir!"
"O: Very solid brew. Germans again showing how big taste without getting overpowering should be done. Shows a very nice amount of balance in the taste and it would have been a much better brew with a more appropriated mouthfeel."
"Very drinkable but not for sessioning. It makes me want to really explore this style."
"Pours dark brown with a slightly tan head. Nice fruity/malty aroma. Sweet taste of caramel, dark fruits, raisins, slightly roasted malts, toasted marshmallow finish. The alcohol is surprising hidden, and it is surprisingly easy to drink, somewhat complex. Nice finish."
"O (D) - this is really good beer. It's interesting and complex, and aside from some minor issues with being a bit sweet and the alcohol showing a bit too much, it's nearly flawless. (take this with a grain of salt, I don't know the style very well)"
"Note: [Eisbocks:Lagers::Barleywines:Ales] so perhaps Eisbocks will go through a refinement period similar to what is happening to Barleywines now. You read it here first (I hope)."
"Good stuff. Kulmbacher’s the original eisbock and is classic for a reason. Smoothly blended flavors, not too intense."
"Dr: It's an extremely drinkable beer for the ABV. A delightful example of an eisbock, albeit of a lower ABV than it could be. Many doppelbocks can easily hit this ABV, so why brew an eisbock this low? It's very affordable in Germany, even by German standards. You'd get floored if you tried to session this, but I doubt anyone would. It's not worth jumping through special hoops to acquire, unless you're an extreme eisbock fanatic and you don't mind the (style-relative!!) low ABV."
"(D)- I am not very experienced with Eisbocks, but this is pretty good. Not over the top in any way, but a solid straightforward one."
"Poured a dark brown with a small tan head. Roasted malts on the nose with some fruit sweetness. Caramel maltiness in the taste mainly, with some sour fruit essence and a noticeable alcohol presence. Just enough hops to be noticed in the background. Medium-bodied and nicely drinkable."
"Poured a 2"" head of tiny velvet bubbles. Clear dark umber brown color. The smell pumps off a lot of alcohol, plus sweet malt. The taste is a rich velvety malt with an amazing mouthfeel and a fully satisfying richness. The booziness and long finish reminds me a little of a bourbon barrel aged stout but obviously without the vanillan aspect of bourbon. Really a powerhouse of a Bock concentrated into an Eisbock."
"Pours a moderate brown with a tan head. Lacing sticks around a bit. Nose is solid malts with some caramel, toffee, and some woodiness. The mouth is a little bready - slightly chewy. The maltiness is very nice. It is impressive how well the elevated ABV is buried in this very smooth and balanced brew. This is a very good beer. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys German style brews and would be a good introduction for those that don't."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and thick with some chewiness too it. Overall a nice drinking eisbock with plenty of flavor and a little bit of kick to it."
"O - Very enjoyable. ABV is high but well hidden. I would recommend it."
"A sip is loaded with malty caramel and more dark fruit, nice creamy body with a slick bready finish. Alcohol not very present early on, probably needs to warm up a bit - there's alot going on here, I can imagine the drinkability getting problematic...in a good way."
"Pours a nice mahogany like color when held to the light it gives off a nice reddish hue with a two finger khaki colored head which disapates to skim and leaves some lace rings which disappear around the glass. The aroma is of dark fruits, caramel malt, molasses, and brown sugar, very sweet, and very inviting. The taste is much of the same a nice sweetness comprised of caramel, molasses, chocolate and some dark fruits. The taste is very inviting and very smooth with just a hint of booziness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a touch of boozy slickness. Overall it is a very solid beer, nice big inviting aroma and flavor. The alcohol is very well hidden. A very smooth easy drink, it would be easy to get yourself in trouble with this one. Overall a very good beer."
"D: Very drinkable for ABV. Flavorful and surprisingly smooth - frankly, the color surprised me and I didn't know what to expect after that. Well worth a try."
"O: A nice sipper to end the evening. Really liked the dark fruit flavors and was surprised at how drinkable it was."
"Notes: This is a very enjoyable beer with nice complexity and excellent drinkability."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I thought this was a nicely drinkable beer but not quite up to the standards set by the Aventinus Eisbock which is my model example of this style. I don't regret having it but will wait for the Aventinus before having another Eisbock. My overall impression is of a well made beer worth trying that has much to offer."
"The Eisbock is very good, the color is a really nice deep reddish brown. The beer has a really nice aroma too, it's sweet and malty. The flavor is of dark fruits and malt, sweetness of brown sugar in the mix as well. The head lasted from start to finish, the beer is good at a chilled temp or at a warmer one too. Worth a try for sure"
"Cherry wood brown with minimal lacing and fingers. Poured a low head using a Beck's .4l Pilsner/lager glass. Didn't feel like getting the tulip out. Smell is sweet with a hint of molasses or a caramel munich malt smell. Hop aroma is mild and quite pleasant. Taste is sweet with a slight alcohol bite in the middle, nice smooth finish. You can't really notice the 9%. To me the defining characteristic is the finish. It leaves you wanting more every sip. Mouthfeel is nice with just a lil dancing of carbonation on the tongue. This is definitely a beer I want to keep around regularly. Unfortunately I have to drive pretty far to get it since my local haunt store does not carry."
"I fully expect someone to tell me that I had an old bottle. Not great. :|"
"This is the first Eisbock I've tried and I'm definitely going to look for others to compare to. Enjoyed thoroughly."
"This is the good stuff. Rich intense but smooth malt profile. All the flavors melded into a well-rounded brew."
"D: Although the beer definitely tastes strong, the alcohol is well masked."
"An intensely, bold, sweet malt bomb with a boozy edge. Very drinkable and mild for this style. Its a sipper though. Molasis, ripe dark fruits, prunes, raisins, plum, dark cherry and candied sugar with floral hints in the background. Honey suckle, and some smokiness of oak. Hints of vanilla. Bold, strong, and sweet. Pretty sticky and thick bodied. Very enjoyable taste, but its a slow sipper with a slight edge of a bourbon burn."
"Pours a stained-glass clear dark amber brown. Head quickly fades to just a dusting on the top. Smell is aged, caramel, smoked candy and fruit. Very malty and dense. The taste is very similar to the smell with a spicy note and a nice bitterness on the trailing edge. The ABV sneaks up on you pretty quick as it is not noticeable while you're drinking it. A very good beer."
"D- very drinkable, even on a 70* night, would def. get this one again"
"D= only limited by the ABV%. Otherwise very memorable."
"Into a snifter poured a dark deep brown/ruby, thin head quickly dissipated. No lacing left on glass. Smells real sweet, ripe fruit, raisins, molasses. Taste is very sweet, huge malt sweetness, sweet fruit. Pretty full bodied brew, sweet and syrupy. Drinkability was actually pretty damn good,the 9.2%ABV was hidden very well with the full flavor beer."
"The drinkability wasn't good for me on this one. The aroma and mouthfeel weren't bad at all, nothing outstanding but at least enjoyable. The sweetness was just overwhelming. There were some nice dark fruit flavors that made it through but there were quickly overshadowed. Not a drainpour by any means, but not as enjoyable as I would have liked."
"(Bottle courtesy of guyinchicago!). Pours cola color with off-white head. Aroma of raisin, port, and some wood/cardboard. Taste is sweet with little alcohol bite. Full bodied and sticky texture. Smooth, but somewhat boozy finish. A nice winter beer!!"
"This Eisbock is proof positive grand beers are awaiting those who dare explore off the well-beaten path of the American craft superhighway."
"Drinkability: Another port like beauty. I bought several bottles and I'm glad I did. Another winner from Kulmbacher."
"Tasty, complex, balanced and smooth. Really good beer...I remember first trying this and another eisbock, and not really being into it, a few years ago. I am now."
"Overall this is a great beer and the best Eisbock by far I have had to date. Although you can't session this it's quite enjoyable on a cold February evening, not an everyday brew but still great."
"This beer pours a dark smooth brown, almost black with a healthy head. The smell isn't strong, but pleasant. The taste and the mouth feel are where this beer shines. It's pretty malty, but the flavors are also pretty full and disguise the 9.2 ABV quite well. This is an excellent winter beer, very drinkable, and a nice introduction to ice bocks."
"Pours a moderate amber-copper color with a pretty good off-white head. A bit of spotty lacing on the way down and a nice, thin collar around the edges of the beer. The nose is pretty sweet with some dark fruits and a touch of oxidation. Not all that much alcohol. The taste is a bit of caramelized malt with some fruit and quite a bit of sweetness. Not much booze comes through in the feel, though that might be because it's quite sweet, bordering on cloying. Not a bad beer but half of this bottle was more than enough for me."
"I surprisingly dig this one. A full body drinker, this one should be made a winter seasonal, but I'll be happy to find it any time of year."
"D-Very drinkable but the spice and reciprocal maltiness. Overall, a damn steal at $3.69 a bottle. Probably one of the best value beers on the planet, and then some."
"11.2 oz. bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Poured a deep brown with two fingers of tan head. Deep malty aroma with some molasses. Big, rich full bodied mouthfeel. Lots of malt with more molasses and caramel. Some noble hops to balance things out. Warming, but not alcoholic. One of these is plenty. Top notch bock."
"A heavy, thick, ""warming"" (via the alcohol) beer for cold winter days. The nose is a bit of a let-down, but everything is there for the taste buds to enjoy. I don't know how often I'd want something this thick, but it's good to have available nonetheless."
"prevalence of raisiny and breadcrust flavors: the malt contribution is, predictably, robust and smooth and dynamic. spice (perhaps partly attributable to ethanol heat) and hop flavors shine through nicely, however, enhancing the beer's overall dynamism"
"Overall- Flavorful as it warms up. Alc. isn't overpowering yet warming. Excellent night cap beer."
"D: I love Bocks, and this was no exception. Was a real crowd pleaser."
"This Eisbock has some nice fruity elements you don't get too often with bocks and lagers, but the poorly integrated alcohol hurts the beer in the end."
"Drinkability is good for a beer of this strength."
"Nice mouthfeel as the carbonation and malt body offer a slight viscous creaminess as well as a moderate grainy texture. A complex and decadent dessert."
"Bottle. Pours a deep brown with a spotty beige head, appears clear ruby when held to the light. Nose is really malty, not overly sugary, with lots of nice dark fruits, peat, a little smoke. Very good. Sweet and a bit peaty/smokey in the mouth. Dark fruits like figs and dates shine. A little too much residual hop bitterness, though that's kind of nitpicky. I guess I'd like it to be a little creamier and more thick. This is maybe the first eisbock I've had, and it's bold, pretty strong, balanced, and impressive."
"D: Excellent craftsmanship. Enjoyable experience. Nice how the flavor and body changes with amount of time in mouth. Transitions from the initial sweetness to resonate into the more complex nuances of hops and grain."
"Overall a rich and complex flavor. Definitely worth a try."
"Nice easy drinking doppelbock."
"D: Probably a little better than the Aventinus Eisbock, and certainly less boozy and harsh. Dangerously easy to drink."
"Drinkabilitiy is decent, drinks much smoother than 9.2%, a bit of bitterness and minerality but not much, some sweetness and a touch of dryness, and not much for stickiness like I expected. A nice warming winter beer."
"Poured into tulip from 12 oz bottle. Pours mahogany in color with rocky off white head. Very little retention, virtually none in fact. Smell is of sweet malt, some sugar, and sweet ripe fruit. The only thing I really didnt like was I definitely noticed the alcohol in the nose. Taste was rich and complex. Some yeast, sweet fruit, malt with candi sugar, some ""earth"" tastes as well (you know, the taste of earth?). Mouthfeel was medium bodied, very smooth and velvety. Overall a great beer. The ABV is well hid in the taste but definitely noticeable in the nose. For what I paid for it this is definitely worth every penny."
"All I have to say is wow. This is awesome all hail this beer!"
"D - I like it but would tire over session."
"drinkability - this is a fine representer of the style, I have a couple more of which I will age"
"D: Not something I could do all the time. But very interesting, and enjoyable."
"The palate opens quite full, again with plenty of Vienna/Munich malt flavor. Moderately fruity as well, there's plum and a little prune. Spicy on the mid-palate, and the alcohol does come through as well. The alcohol is a little spicy. Mildly sweet with burnt toffee on the finish, this could use some age to lend some oxidation. Light carbonation, this feels quite good on the palate. Despite it's heft, the mid-palate feels a little lacking in that it doesn't seem quite as tight as it could be. Solid stuff, just not super-drinkable."
"D: Fair. This is a decent beer that drinks easily for it's strength, but doesn't stand out as a beer that I'll revisit anytime soon."
"D: This is exceptionaly drinkable for an eisbock -- smooth and balanced, I'm sure the age helped, but this is an exceptional beer overall."
"D - The only hit on the drinkability would be the high ABV, but we aren't rating the beer on that, are we? A very good example of an Eisbock. I have my misgivings coming into this, but I would buy this beer again in a heartbeat, and I would certainly recommend it to my friends. (Why again was it that I questioned a beer from Germany?)"
"D: A really nice enjoyable sipper. Classic example of the style."
"It's viscous and rich on the palate, though not overly syrupy, with flavors of dates, molasses, figs and earth. There's a bit of anise-like spiciness mid-palate, and a moderately toasty and bitter malt character that keeps the sweetness in check. Alcohol is surprisingly hidden, though the viscosity alludes to the beer's potency. Very smooth and inviting on the whole, I'd happily drink this again. Eisbock isn't a style I have much experience with, but this is better than most I've tried."
"D: This should be a ""one and done"" type of beer."
"I find the sweetness a little overpowering for my palate, but it's a very nice beer apart from that."
"D - Almost too easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"I wouldn't drink this again. I don't like it. Not one bit. Okay, a little bit. But a small bit. The price wasn't terrible, but if you pay for something you dislike it's too much. Overall, it's a terrible drink and the drain is looking thirsty."
"Taste is spicey rich prune, gingerbread, dark toast with some other subtle elements lurking. Feel is silky, slightly oily but not viscous or thick. It is very smooth."
"Opens to a nose of german malt and yeast. A coca cola color with a subtle head of sugary lace. Not tight bubbles but substancial. Lets outs a nose of rasins, molasses, assam tea earth. Palate of earthy malt and a bitter of black tea and a zest of black cherry sours. Alcohol comes out as it warms but lets some interesting qualities. Really expands."
"D: Tasty and I could enjoy a couple."
"Notes: First eisbock, I believe, and it is relatively close to the range I was expecting. It's a brew worth having around for an assertive and yet somewhat delicate malty craving."
"A nice example of an Eisbock, not as deep and complex as the Aventinus Eisbock, but a very good beer none- the-less."
"d: I bought this completely at random and had no idea what to expect. It wasn't quite as rich and flavorful as I hoped and it was a bit on the hot side. Pretty good overall, but not something I need to revisit."
"Nice beer. I'm no expert on Eisbocks, but I feel like this holds its own with the likes of Aventinus. Worth a try for sure. Malt lovers rejoice!"
"There were a couple strong points. The alcohol was extremely well hidden; I would not be surprised if this was a 4% brew. This did not change as it warmed up. I was also shocked at how quickly and easily I finished this beer, especially considering its overall unpleasant taste and high alcohol content. If this was a little more complex and didn't have such a bad aftertaste, I could see myself drinking this frequently."
" ~ This is a very good beer. I have this bottle and another I am cellaring for the future. I'm very interested to see how it changes with the guidance of time."
"Taste: Fizzy up front, dry toasted caramel, and straightforward malts. Quite sweet in the middle with raisins, more toasted caramel and has almost a cola character to it. Finish is semidry and black cherry cola."
"D - This beer is a pure pleasure. As I drink and review I feel the alcohol roll over and through me. This is a beautiful beer that suits its intended purpose, but don't get carried away (or you'll need to be carried away). If this is your beer for the evening just remember ""drink slow, drink slow."""
"Tasty, recommended."
"D - pleasantly surprised, was only $2.95, great deal for the ABV and quality, heat is never overpowering and has great malt characteristics, overall really enjoyed this - will seek out aventinus weizen-eisbock to compare"
"Very drinkable beer, but not necessarily more then a couple at a time."
"Not sure I'm having the beer the brewer intended tonight - I distinctly recall a significantly better beverage. There's a couple more bottles in the fridge; I'll re-rate when their turn comes around."
"Comments: I received this beer as a BoM pick. Thankfully, I have one bottle left over to cellar!"
"My first eisbock and this one's not for the weak-hearted. Reminds me of a weizenbock minus a bit of the wheat-like character and with some added fruitiness."
"Notes: Best before 14/09/10. A very nice beer that is pretty sweet but not cloying and has enough flavors to balance it out. The alcohol is present and provides a nice warming, but it is very well masked. Very enjoyable beer that is a great way to finish a night. I highly recommend trying it."
"D - This was a really good beer. It was sweet, but not overly sweet - nice blend of malts and sugars going on. I saw this sitting by itself on the shelf so I thought I would try it. I am glad I picked it up. I could definitely have another."
"D - Can definitely detect the alcohol in this one, so it's not something I would pound back. Very drinkable but I wouldn't drink two in a sitting."
"D - wasnt sure where to go with this one...first time with an Eisbock. not a fan of things overly sweet, but this has enough going on, and enough history behind it to make it a bit special."
"This one's moderately drinkable given the sweetness, metallic taste, and 9.2% ABV."
"D: This is a big beer, very drinkable but I couldn't have more than one. Went well with my thin crust pizza, although I think it would even be better with some additional age."
"Drinkability? 1 bottle at a sitting does me just fine and I think that's what the brewers intended...a brew to sip and savour when one needs a perk me up after a strenuous day at work. Thank goodness for that *accident*. Read the label if you're missing the reference. ;^)"
"D- A nice, sweet sipper. Warm, but for the ABV and style, this is nice. The more I got into it, the nicer this got."
"M/D: Full bodied, smooth, carbonation is medium. Drinkability is fine. Very solid beer."
"D - the sweetness makes this one a slow sipper."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch tan head that didn't stay around for very long. However, there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is very malty, the brew smells like caramel malt, dark fruit (raisins, cherries), and toffee. It tastes like dark fruit, caramel malt, molasses, and a bit of peat. The 9.2% ABV isn't very noticable at all. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and coating, with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it goes down easy and is enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good Eisbock, I'd buy this again in the future."
"The alcohol is barely noticeable and the beer almost drinks like a session brew which is very dangerous..."
"On tap at the other side. Pours beautifully dark black in the middle with dark but clear edges with hint of red. Nice white frothy head. Sweet fruity smell with cherries, figs. Taste follows but also with chocolate hints. Alcohol comes through on the back end with nice bite. Thin feel with mild carbonation. Great for one, bit too sweet and strong for more than that."
"Yay!"
"Overall: A fine beer, but didn't quite live up to my expectations seeing as it is rated as the 6th best Eisbock in the world."
"This is a solid offering. With 9.2% alcohol it's low abv for the style, but tasty nevertheless."
"Good drinkability despite the high ABV. Easy to drink, and I'd have another if I had one."
"This beer is full bodied, and definitely something to be enjoyed on a cold winter night by the fire."
"D: Smooth drinker but the alcohol starts to catch up with you in the end. Glad to get to try this one from my BotM club."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pour a rich dark clear mahogany color with a small light tan head that quickly disapated into a ring with lacing that slides back into the brew. Super malty aroma with hints of sweetness and dark fruit. Big malted toffee sweetness and a slight sour finish. Very tasty. Highly drinkable for this high an AVB."
"Pours from the bottle to a dark brown color with little head or lacing, but that's all that went wrong. Nose is a very complex mix of licorice, coffee and malty toffee, but at various times, I also got bubblegum and cotton candy. Mouthfeel was very full and pleasantly biting, and the taste built on those complex scents in the nose. Although the 9.2% abv was well hidden in both the nose and taste, it made itselfd known by way of the long warming finish. A ver enjoyable beer on a cold night."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a small head. Smell is of caramel and malts. Tastes like it smells caramel and malts, the alcohol taste becoming stronger as the beer warms. Feels medium bodied in the mouth. One of these was enough for me. Overall a different and not bad brew."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Nearly black color, faint highlights. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Rich malty nose. Starts sweet almost cloying, raisin/molasses flavor, clean finish. You don't notice the high ABV. $1.35 for a 330ml bottle from John's Market Place Tigard, Or 7-10-06. $3.00 330ml from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me. 12-18-09."
"Overall not bad but lacking the depth that I'd expect from a beer this big. The alcohol was formidable & wasn't justified by the flavor. I have to wonder if my expectations were skewed by the wheatwine I'd reviewed just prior to this (from the night before). I feel like having them adjacent to each other emphasized the simplicity of this one."
"Notes: Tastes like this could have been a nice Dopplebock before the process that made it an Eisbock."
"This beer reminds me of some awesome scotch ales I've had before."
"Ordered a bottle of the 2003 vintage at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA for $8. It came in a red wine glass and appeared a near-black red. It drank like a great dessert wine. Sure it was thick and sweet, but it was a joy to sip after dinner. The flavor was rich with sweet dried fried fruits like figs, raisins and cherries. There was a typical candied leather taste that you find in a lot of old, dark beers. And some fresher notes of molasses (very light) and caramel complimented the dominant dark fruits. Heck of a beer."
"D - This is a very good beer even with the abv and warmth from it it still pretty easy to drink worth trying sometime"
"Notes - a really nice and complex beer. Makes me want to sample more of this style."
"The Eisbock is a fairly thick brew, with a slick and viscous mouthfeel. It is pretty easily drinkable, despite the high abv (which is deceptively well-hidden)."
"D-This is the real deal. This is so delicious and yet so clean and smooth...I love this style but more often than not the beers lean too hot on the alcohol....not this one...this is just loaded with character and flavor but no heat at all...great beer...."
"M/D: Creamy and kind of heavy, but not a beer that I would characterize as ""thick"" per se. The beer has a nice malty sweetness in the finish, but it isn't too sweet, and as mentioned before, nor is it too complex. This is a beer with little nuance but a ton of character. This is a very enjoyable beer, and good enough to drink more than one at a time."
"This is a terrific beer, the first of this style I've tried. I'll be getting more for sure."
"Overall, a pretty nice beer. Chalk another one up for the Germans."
"this may be my first Eisbock I've had and i really liked it. Very good color and aroma, plenty of balance to make the alcohol standable, interesting aroma and a very good and interesting dry and bitter flavor. I will definitely get this again as soon as I see it. ."
"A great eisbock."
"D: Quite drinkable, if not for the high price I would definitely seek out again. Apparently eisbocks are hard to come by in North Texas."
"The beer is thick, full bodied, full palated, and a tad syrupy. This is a sweet malty beer with the tastes of figs, raisins, maybe some nuts and some booze soaked florals. The sweet malts predominate and there isn't much hop or spicy yeast to speak of. The roasted, sweet nutty flavors come out more in the finish. The beer is low carbonation and does have a bit of throatiness because of the high ABV. The aftertaste is boozy, sweet, and raisiny, similar to the overall taste and experience. This is a good beer, a sipper for sure, but quite nice for a cold day."
"Pours dark brownish/red with red highlights. Not much of a head. The aroma is a mix of alcohol and caramel malt with a lot of malty sweetness. The predominant flavor is nuttyness as well as alcohol, dark fruit and malt. Not too much hop flavor. Tastes about like a concentrated bock, which judging from the way it is made, is probably what the brewers were going for. Medium mouthfeel and definitely a sipper."
"Soft, toasty mouthfeel, but with an ABV that doesn't mess around. Easy to drink, but it's definitely a beer that demands your respect. Otherwise you might find yourself waking up on the floor at 3am."
"Pours dark amber with no head at all. Smell is slightly muted with only a hint of malt detectable. The taste is slightly smokey malt. Very sweet but somewhat thick with more than a hint of booze. There is also a slightly wheat;like taste as well. Very easy to drink even though the alcohol does cause a numbing on my tongue asI drink. The aftertaste continues to be extremely sweet. Dangerously drinkable for such an alcoholic beer."
"Overall Impression - This is of course a strong beer, and it's wonderful. The only complaint that I really have is about the head retention, or lack there of. Otherwise this is a great beer and a perfect example of the style."
"D: loses points for sweetness, but overall the abv is well hidden and it has a nice flavor"
"D: Nice enough if you like the style, not really my taste."
"My first eisbock, and I definitely have to get my hands on another bottle."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours an opaque caramel with a decent little white head, no lacing. The aromas are sweet dates, brown sugar and a subtle hint of booze. The flavors follow the nose. It is sweet and mellow up front with a nice little alcohol kick in the finish. The beer is smooth as silk and has a creamy mouth feel to it. A very nice beer to sip on a cold winters night."
"This beer is a dream. You would never guess the alcohol by drinking it. I can feel my mind shutting off. Beer is smooth, sweet up front, full bodied, no solvents, no aftertaste, drinkability amazingly high."
"Verdict: Rich, malty, and boozy, this is just what you'd expect from a good Eisbock. Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, this is well worth a try. I just wish more brewers experimented with this style."
"Very tasty, but too sweet to drink much of... like even a bottle."
"A delicious brew, but a little rich, and the alcohol could spell doom for a lightweight."
"Good Eisbock. A real malt atomic bomb. I'm not sure that I'd ever want more than one in a sitting. There's not a ton to say about it. It tastes like a bock extract, all candied dates, raisins, brown sugar and syrupy French toast. It's much more of a straight German malt sweetness than the Aventinus banana bread treacle, though both are pleasant in their own right. I'm probably being generous on appearance. The head is a joke but I'll give it the benefit of style comparison. Good beer for a cold, hungry night."
"With each sip I feel more relaxed and at peace with the world. The malt character is wondrous (and I'm not a big fan of malty beers in general). I could sit here and sip this all night, but alas my bottle has run dry. An exceptional beer. I will most definitely compulsively buy more bottles when I next come across them."
"D: Delicious and terrifyingly (I am aware that this is not a word) cheap. I would recommend pacing yourself though. This is not light on the ABV."
"Price was a litle higher but well work it. Even made their factory a fanpage on my Facebook and a definate stop if ever going to Germany."
"Drinkability - Wouldn't want to go too far with this one. Knowing it's 9.2 keeps this one going for a long sipping spell. You could certainly drink more and more, but would end up in trouble. It's very drinkable, but suggest letting this warm and enjoy it at a good range of temps."
"overall: this is a hell of a beer and perfect for the when the weather is starting to cool down, absolutely delicious and the beginning of my rectifying my negligence in drinking beers from germany, prost!!"
"Nutty malts hit first, followed quickly by a spicy, medicinal booziness that coats the back of the tongue. A few hints of dark fruit and toffee, but not as much as the nose suggested. Still, a very palatable Eisbock, and the medium body and tight carbonation level helps that. A little syrupy at times, but overall Kulmbacher's Eisbock drinks very smoothly. Solid beer."
"affordable. with a well masked high abv. decent tasting. fits almost all requirements for one of those nights where you just wanna feel alchohol but not punish yourself with a bad beer."
"This is a great beer. I wish I could get my hands on some more Eisbock's. This is a great step in the right direction. An after dinner drink for sure. Something I highly recommend."
"D: This is a very complex beer. To receive it's full potential you must concentrate. But it's a very special beer."
"Very dark brown pour of a stunning intensity, with a small tan head, that soon diminished to a film but left a few spots of lace. Large sweet bread aroma, mixed in with brown sugar, dark fruits and warming alcohol. Sweet malts unsurprisingly dominate the flavour, with a strong brown bread component providing a muscular base. Plump and juicy raisins combine with dates to deal a pleasant fruitiness. The finish is warming and slightly drying. The high ABV obviously makes this beer a sipper, though it actually drinks a lot lighter than it is, in part due to the medium-light body and pillowy carbonation. A dangerous brew, then, but one with which I would happily dance again."
"Full bodied but I disagree with those who call this syrupy -- no way. It is well carbonated, so much so that it feels lighter than it really is, and this helps with the drinkability. I thought this was going to be one I kinda had to fight my way through, but i instead found it to be highly drinkable. A very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a super dark reddish brown, with a thin tan head. Smells strongly of liquid malt extract, solvent alcohol, and licorice. Taste is super malty, like malt bomb levels, chocolately hints, rasins, and licorice in the taste as well. A hint of earthy bitterness too. Surprisingly dry finish for such a malty beer. Mouthfeel is super chewy, thick and rich. Medium carbonation. Very good drinkability, the malt flavor almost completely hides any alcohol in this strong beer. Highly recommended. Tastes like a dopplebock on steriods."
"D: Like I said, it certainly will fool you for being a 9.2 abv. Overall I liked this brew. It's a honest beer and one that you should try if you come in contact with it. I would probably just drink one of these at any one time."
"D - This is a very heavy, but pleasant to drink beer."
"D- The high ABV definitely makes this one a sipper. Overall, this is a solid brew that is definitely worth picking up."
"This brew kicks other's asses at the ABV level. It's a desert in a glass and not obtrusive like other beers at the alcohol level."
"Overall this is a highly worthy brew and would fit well in a dessert setting."
"D- This beer has a good malt flavor but still has the smoothness of a lager and is very drinkable. Especially at the 9.2%ABV."
"Alcohol well-disguised, but the finish is kind of tart and unrefreshing. Similar to the Sam Adams Imperial Stout in the intenseness of the sour fruits used and similarly undrinkable."
"Goes down fairly smooth for 9%, but the alcohol starts to spring forth the warmer it gets. Good for an after dinner treat."
"D: High quality brew here, another one that lives up to it's reputation. I'll probably try one of the other big Eisbock's in the future to see how it measures up. Not a beer I'd drink everyday, but one that delivers when the mood strikes. Give this one a try if you're looking for something unique and German."
"This is a good beer. I'm not usually a German beer fan, but this was nice."
"Overall it's good but I would prefer a doppelbock which usually don't seem as sweet and are a bit more drinkable."
"Notes: Not bad,not bad at all. Creamy and filling. A good beer."
"D - Good overall. Still thought it had a bit much alcohol flavor though."
"I'd never even heard of this beer before but randomly picked it up in Wisconsin since I never see any Eisbocks around. Glad I did as this is fantastic."
"Kulbacher Eisbock is a clear copper beer with a leathery beige film of a head. It has a sweet, tart aroma. It is medium-full bodied and syrupy. It's very sweet, tast and malty. The flavor is very clean and strong. This is nice. I've never had an eisbock. It's kind of like a barleywine."
"T/M - Medium mouthfeel that sits well on the tongue. The taste is also of pungent malts and higher alcohol but the overall impression is that it is very smooth and comfortable in the mouth. There is a slightly hoppy aftertaste. Powerful brew."
" My first ""Ice bock"" and it's really very inspirational, a wonderful sipper!!"
"For an Eisbock, very drinkable. The style can sometimes be somewhat boozy, but this one didn't seem that way. Almost had some creamy flavors to it. Recommended, especially as an intro to the style."
"This beer poured a dark opaque brown with a big fluffy tan head. The smell is some lightly roasted malt with a dark fruit undertone, very appealing. The taste starts off with some sweet malt with some caramel character that goes into some fruity and breadiness before it's smashed by some very aggressive alcohol. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and creamy with some understated carbonation and some warming from the alcohol. A surprisingly drinkable beer for having such a high ABV, my first introduction to the style but it's something I've always been on the lookout for. Definitely worth a try."
"5.0 D: Damn fine beer. Very drinkable. This could be a staple of anyone's beer diet."
"It should be obvious that I think this one is better with some age on it. Fresh is not nearly as good, or special."
"sweetness, alcohol and phenols cut down drinkability slightly."
"There's a fairly strong alcoholic presence at the back end of this one which stops it from being too drinkable. It is an interesting slow sipper but I don't think the flavor is as exciting as the smell."
"D: A very nice beer to me. Sweet and strong, this beer is rather wine like in presentation. I like it a lot. This is the perfect beer to ring in the start of Spring."
"Aroma: Massive Munich malt aroma, with that distinctive rich, dark caramelly malt. Notes of fig, prune, dates."
"Food Pairing Recommendations: Smoked cheese and sausage, Bavarian pretzels, maybe even beer-battered onioin rings."
"In a lot of ways this is sort of typical for an eisbock, but it is quite good. It has a nice head when poured. Not sold black but quite dark. Aroma is pretty standard strong bock affair- very malt, dark raisiny fruit, some brown liquor, and a bit of an earthy, wood-like base. The aromas are much more noticeable in the bottle compared to in a glass (a snifter, even).The flavor follows the aroma in all ways- quite estery, sweet, dark fruit, all malt and no hop. I mean, you should basically know what you're getting into with a 9% iced bock. Mouth is moderate, not too viscous at all. It's good but nothing new or different really for the style. Drinkability and flavor diminish a bit towards the end, becoming syrupy and more whiskey-like"
"D: spot on for an Eisbock"
"D- This is crazy easy to drink. Very smooth and goes down with out a hitch."
"D: this is my first-ever Eisbock, and hooray what a cracking booze this is! In a sense, the dark-fruit character and the really deep, full-bodied malts make this lager firmly in line with my preference, but my biased palate surely couldn't be so... satisfied if there was no balance, which there surely is in the most elegant form. Considering how little presence at which the alc. has made itself felt, I find this lager equally enjoyable as a Russian Imperial Stout, albeit in a very distinctive way. A sheer (icy) beauty."
"Although there's great contention now for which country makes the best pilsner or Weißbier, I think the Germans can rest comfortably knowing the rest of the world hasn't quite caught up yet with their ability to brew a magnificent eisbock. Kulmbacher's may be proven yet to not be the pinnacle of the style but it's still at the apex of my list."
"Very good beer overall, I would definitely go for it again."
"Definitely one for a very cold night..."
"Overall: The is very rich and tasty. The mouth feel is full body with a slight alcohol warmth. The finish is slightly bitter but not aggressive. This is my first Eisbock and I have enjoyed drinking this beer. It is extremely strong dark and a malt bomb."
"Notes: Das Legendare Kulmbacher! What commands respect more than snowflakes and shimmery foil?"
"Drinkability: Surprisingly little alcohol heat or prickle for the style, which was a pleasant surprise. Can't say this one came close to Aventinus Eisbock (which still defines the style for me), but it was a pleasant, enjoyable-enough brew which I'd be glad to try again."
"I had expected so much more from this... I want more flavours and a much stronger body. Still a good beer."
"The taste is, again, very nutty with a nice and well balanced malty goodness. There is a bitterness that lingers, but this is a well balanced beer with a yeasty essence one can only get in a fine German brew."
"Deep red colour, small beige head, creamy. Some lacing. Aroma is malty, sweet. warming, jam, honeylike. Flavour is sweet, honeylike,a bit metallic reminiscent of samichlaus. There is caramel and it has a vinous quality. Mouthfeel is smooth woth small bubbles, medium body. There is a faint bitterness in the finish. This beer was very good, but it is so sweet that it got a bit overwhelming at the end."
"Lots of roasty, chocolate malt flavors. Strong flavors come on hard and fast, then *poof*, gone just as quick. Hop bitterness and alcohol help contribute to the extreme dryness of the beer. I really dig this beer, my first eisbock....will seek out again."
"D: Almost gave it a 5. Had to hold back because of the high ABV. Easy to sip, knocks you on your can pretty quick. The ABV is well hidden on this one."
"Overall - This is a very sweet tasting eisbock with a huge alcoholic kick to it. Excellently portlike with rich flavors, this is a great after dinner digestif or a conversational drink with a cigar. A must try for everyone. I definitely recommend it. Looking forward to picking up a 6 pack to age."
"2.2/5"
"Dark mahagony with tan lacy head. Outstanding nose with hints of the fruitiness to come. Initial hit was slightly tart, followed by a vaguely syrupy sweetness. Very complex finish. Alcohol lingers long after the swallow."
"Overall: excellent brew. Lots of flavors, very balanced. Ive had too many extrem beers lately, so this one was really nice to try. It kicks ass with simple means."
"Drinkability is good, this a smooth big beer. Very dangerous this one. I just fought through the DFH Palo Santo Matron and thought this might be in a similar vain, but aside from the color and heft, there is no comparison - the DFH was a hot mess, and this one is exceptionally well made. Pretty reasonable price too IIRC."
"Drinkability is rather high for the high ABV. Goes down a bit to easy maybe? Great beer!"
"A decent eisbock but this one just didn't cut it for me. Too sweet and boozy. Quite nice to sip at, slowly, tho. Worth a try!"
"Drinakbility: I really enjoyed this brew as part of a session, but I do believe that the ABV would be a bit limiting."
"Medium body, lower carbonation. Some warming from the alcohol. Complex, and very enjoyable."
"drinkability is decent. this is a rich and solid brew on the palate with a comfortably high alcohol tag and a smoothness that so embodies the style. cheers!"
"Overall, a very nice sipping beer, perfect for drinking after a meal."
"Overall, this is a pretty stellar beer. It is a bit warming on the finish, but I really enjoyed the chocolate notes."
"Pours a blackish body with a faint tan-head that dissipates slowly and leaves some lace patches. Malt smell is prevelant - sweetness to it. Like caramel and sugary stuff (bubblegum, cotton candy). Also a little syrupy in the smell. Taste and mouthfeel further this. This is thick, like almost milk shake through a straw thick. And oh so sweet. The sweet malts drive this beer and even finishes with a sweet touch. Hints of dark fruit there; something to just tweak it so you're not drinking sugar water. If it weren't for the high ABV (which is almost completely hidden - there is a slight burn after awhile if you're just sippin') I could session this anytime."
"Too drinkable for the style, beware!! One of the best eisbocks I've had!!!"
"Pretty good pick here, this being the first time I've had an eisbock, so I didn't know what to expect. I didn't feel the ABV though. You might wanna wanna watch out with this beer, with 9.2 it could creep up on you and kick your ass."
"D: For the style, this is almost exact to bjcp specifications, plus it's one of the best tasting Eisbock's I've tried to date. I could drink this more so than any of Eisbock, despite the high ABV. This would make an incredibly good winter beer or camping beer by the fire on a brisk summer / fall night."
"d: Complex and dessert like. Tasty, but just a bit sweet, as eisbocks can be. Watch out for the alcohol...whoa. Enjoy in moderation."
"Fell in love with eisbocks after my friend gave me one of his homebrew eisbocks. Pours deep amber with off white head. Aroma is fig, raison, and sweet malt. Flavor is slightly hot but not overpowering a nice charecteristic of most eisbocks. Mouthfeel is medium to thick with little carbonation. Dark fruit dominates and finished bitter."
"taste is thick, strong, and tart, sour malt, some cocoa, some licorice, a little roasted toffee, end is somewhat bitter."
"The feel of the drink is full-bodied and well-carbonated, making it quite easily quaffed despited the burly booze numbers. Superb drinkability and a superb drink."
"Drinkability: This is like a kicked up Ayinger Celebrator... not quite at drinkable becuase of the ABV, but if you want a similar sipper this is your beer."
"This was my first beer in a series of good beers a few nights ago and I remember this being deliciously malty. Moderately thick, creamy yet slick mouthfeel -- just real smooth. Had the right balance of bready, toffee, almost nutty, and dark fruits involved in the taste. Not too sweet, no real smokiness involved; just a great strong beer for a malt lover. This went down pretty quickly and the alcohol presence did not make itself known until the morning after."
"Pours a deep dark ruby color with little head and no lacing. Interesting sweet aroma that touches on a fruity overtone. Thick full mouthfeel very nice. The flavor is what really pulls this ice bock together. The malts are extremely sweet almost too sweet but then there are flavors of figs and raisins with some caramel and even a touch of chocolate. Very complex indeed. The finish is smooth and of course sweet. Enjoyable but definitely on a limited basis."
"Deep brown color with a tan head. Poor retention. The nose is quite smokey and has a good amount of dried fruit, candy and roasted malts. More of the same in the flavor department. A delicious brew. Full body goes down well. Could drink this all night."
"drinks like a nice big beer, smooth, sweet and a nice alcoholic snap. Another good Eisbock"
"This was my first Eisbock so I didn't know what to expect. It pours a dark carmel with lots of carbonation that rushes to make a thick tan head. The head dissipated slowly to nothing, once all of the carbo cleared you could see that it was clean. There was a small sweet roasted hop scent with a little malt and some spices thrown in. Lots of alcohol and a little bitter hint of hop is all that I could taste, and a hint of malt. It was thick and creamy with a bitter alcohol aftertaste. I'm not to sure about this one, the high alcohol taste was nice but a little too much, there wasn't a lot of flavor but it did have a nice kick. This one seems like it would be better with age."
"I think I found a new beer to buy every time I see it, this is a good one to have on hand, especially for the winter! I likey very much."
"had fresh and a 2/12 year aged... wow, what a beer, fresh: it hides the alcohol wonderfully, aged: like a fine sherry ... a very drinkable beer that glides down the throat ... lots of plum, belgian berry, some alcohol spice, berries, the aged has the same with some oak ... an absolute wonderful brew... got from LS and the aged from biggreen at the july08 Htown tasting..."
"Overall, this is a complex brew that's made for sippin'."
"First eisbock ever. Please take into consideratoin."
"Flavor... sweet cherry... burnt caramel on the sides of the tongue, nutty, roasted pear notes. warm from the alcohol content... Finishes surprising clean/smooth for such a rich beer. Well balanced."
"Drinkability: As far as taste goes, I rate its drinkability 'high'. But it is 9.2% alcohol, so one bottle of this goes a long way."
"Finish has some bitterness and alcoholic warmth. Not ideal for summer consumption but this one hit the spot just fine anyway."
"Pours dark caramel with a thin white head. Aroma of toffee and molasses. Taste similarly sweet and rich. Tastes like a meal, with a thick mouthfeel. Finish has somelingering bitterness and licorice-like alcohol. I will definitely have this again. Although this beer is very heavy, it is a very nice beer."
"T / M / D: Sweet, almost like cashews nuttiness. Some dark fruit essence in there, toasted malts, and notes of caramel and raisin. A very nicely balanced flavour and mouthfeel, which is rich but not quite thick. A very smooth drinker, and a very easy drinker considering the ABV... almost too easy, as I find myself drinking it rather quickly."
"Highly recommended..."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, especially if you like eisbocks. It's a pretty well-balanced brew all around."
"When I first cracked this beer open I was almost sure I wouldn't like it. I was hit with a huge sweetness as soon as the cap popped. It ended up being a really nice surprise. An eisbock that held up this well for almost 12 years is a treat to drink. Thanks Jeff!"
"D: Really enjoyed this one. Very nice drinkability with a noticeable alcohol spiciness in the finish/fade providing a good warming."
"Light carbonation, just right, full feel. Very nice drinkable, could have several, but for the 9+%, keep this around for after dinner. Yes!"
"I'm not usually a huge bock guy, but this one really impressed me. So smooth and rich, with good balance and complexity."
"D: This is a great nightcap as a sit and watch some playoff hockey. Not too sweet and you are not killed with the alcohol. Well done beer."
"Pours a very dark brown color, clear with ruby tones coming through. Initially a nice foamy tan head is formed, but it quickly dissipates to a slim covering. Aromas are incredibly malt rich, plums, a little chocolate, toffee, leather and a pretty high alcohol presence. On the palate, the malt richness continues, and the alcohol is noticeable, but this is one of the smoothest 9% beers I've ever had. It has an initial candy like sweetness, but it is balanced by the alcohol, hops provide just a shimmer of bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy provided by the low carbonation and borderline syrupyness. Overall, a really nice brew, a style I would love to make someday."
"Pours dark brown to black and looks like coca-cola in the glass with little head. Smell and flavor are both of strong dark malty caramel and alcohol. Notes weren't particularly long on this beer, but the strong toffee like caramelly sweetness was what mostly stood out. The alcohol wasn't overpowering in the flavor though. Decent beer, but didn't wow me."
"D - Very full flavored beer with quite a bit of complexity. The malt and caramel characteristics are particularly intense and the almond flavor is quite unusual. Easily drinkable for such a strong beer."
"This beer pours a very dark almost black color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, plums, and dates. The taste is like the aroma, but with a hot alcoholic finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a cream, velvety texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a nice eisbock. It is fully malty, has depth, and is not overly sticky. I will certainly drink this again."
"Pours out a ruby-tinged leathery brown with some slow-moving, lazy bubbles making their way to the half-finger head. Surprisingly the head holds up extremely well. Leaves some isolated blotches of lace. Smell is intense with caramel maltiness but never goes so far as to smell worty, which I find a good number of extremely malty beers to suffer from. I also get lots of raisins, almonds, pistachios, honey, and rustic bread. Flavor profile is totally chewy with malt, caramel, nuts, bread, dried fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. Very sweet but doesn't really ever get cloying. Ends on a rather bright and slightly acidic note. Some roastiness and mild bitterness help to dry things up in the finish. Minimal alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is just a bit sticky and is rather light in body when considering the flavor profile and level of alcohol. Lively carbonation also helps to lighten this up. So delicious and drinkable. This one has a lot of finesse."
"Got a bottle of this at a bowling party I was at yesterday. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. This beer is a dark brown color with a big tan head. Head has great retention. The huge head settles to a nice 1/2 inch after about 5 minutes or so. Good lacing. Sweet, roasted aromas of caramel, dark chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit are present. The taste consists of sweet, roasted malt with flavors of chocolate, caramel, coffee, followed by a slight bit of hops. Great flavor here! Has a full bodied crisp, yet smooth and creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink the way good craft beer ought to be!"
"The first ice bock I've ever had, this poured a very dark, translucent reddish-brown with only a little thin tan head. It smelled like prunes and oak with some hops. I tasted similar to its scent, although it was a bit sweeter than expected. It was like prunes and molasses mixed with hops bitterness, and slight alcohol warming in the aftertaste. The texture was thick and oily like an imperial stout, but it was still fairly drinkable. Overall it was very different than I expected, but it was pretty good."
"D- For me, it was very, almost cloyingly sweet so I was glad I was splitting a bottle."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Note* beer paired with a coconut tart, coconut sweetness went well with the higer abv"
"D- This one goes dow incredibly easy and hides its high ABV very well. A tribute to classic German brewing traditions."
"Poured a clear amber/ brown color with a nice off-white head that stayed a while. Aroma is of roasted malt, caramel, and chocolate. Flavor is made up of caramel, chocolate, toffee and some dark fruit. Alcohol is hidden well. Mouthfeel is pleasant and this is a nice beer."
"D - I'm not as familiar with the Eisbock style as I'd like to be after imbibing this beer. It's smooth and very enjoyable. It reminds me of a really smooth doppelbock."
"D: A pretty nicely balanced as well as rich and drinkable eisbock, not too heavy not too light. Though I prefer the aventius simply for the alcohol heat the accompanies the aftertaste, but this is still a very solid offering to be sure."
"D: i may have found my Aventinus substitute. two of these and I am ready to party. Pick this up and you won't be disappointed."
"D: This is a fine beer, but I'm not quite blown away. Still, a good example of the style and one that I would considering picking up again."
"I've only had this one one time before, but judging from my old notes, I should be looking forward to the ""28""."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thin head that fades to a slight cap. Very sweet malt aromas with hints of soy and Karo syrup. Taste is somewhat similar, but slightly drier than the aromas. More Karo and sweet malt with a very slight bitterness on the finish. Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel, but this is one sticky sweet monster. For dessert only."
"This was the first eisbock that I've rated. Very similar to a good German doppelbock, like Celebrator. Sipped on this for well over an hour on a cold night. Too sweet for more than one at a time most likely."
"I grabbed this one just by visually shopping at my new favorite store here in Albuquerque. When the ""beer guy"" at the shop told me it was a lot like Celebrator and that I could even do a side by side tasting, my immediate thought was something along the lines of: ""Brother. You are really putting your reputation on the line here."" It was my first suggestion from him and anyone in the store for that matter. I took his advice though and took a bottle of Celebrator to do a side by side tasting. The two are virtually twins I feel, with minimal characteristic differences. The Celebrator has a more roasted quality and the Kulmbacher has a sweeter edge...and also 2.5% more on the ABV. Overall I appreciated this one quite a bit and was surprised how similar it was to Celebrator."
"Poured an 11.2oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a dark brown, almost mahogany, with a large 2 inch head that dissipated quickly. Nose is of raisins, dark fruit, and syrupy malts. Taste is raisins right off the bat, with a syrupy maltiness in the middle finishing with a lingering alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is full. Definitely not a session beer (unless you want to hit the floor) but on a chilly winter night, 1 hits the spot."
"Thanks so much to Mike from Carolina Brewmasters for bringing this treat to the Christmas party. I do love Eisbocks, although I've tried very few. Nice malty syrupy sweetness, a smell of plums and raisins to die for. Great all around, would love to get my hands on many more of these."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet to drink more than 1 or 2, but one of these on a cold winter night would really hit the spot."
"D: One of the rarer styles to find, but certainly a style I could get into. Kulmbacher makes a very good strong lager at a good price, less than $3 for the 11.2 oz. bottle. The alcohol is there, it is noticable, but this does not really take away from the drinkability of the beer like it can in some other styles of beer when the alcohol content is not to style. Definitely worth a try for strong beer fans."
"Kulmbacher Eisbock pours a mahogany brown that shows red highlights when held up to the light with a light brown head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is strong and malty with a bit of fruitiness. The taste is pretty much the same, very malty with some fruit. The alcohol is fairly well hidden in the flavor, but it does rear it's head a bit. This is a very good beer, but I couldn't have another."
"Overall, it tastes like an extra-sweet doppelbock. It is very well done and tasty."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Body is heavy with just enough carbonation to remind you that this is in fact a beer and not some kind of crazy liquor. Slightly warming as it goes down due to alcohol. Velvety on the palate. This is a beer I'd not be opposed to buying again, though I think that I prefer Aventinus Weizen Eisbock over this one, it was just so much more exciting in my experience, much more profound. However, I've no qualms about finishing this sixer I've of this stuff."
"Drinkability- This beer was okay. Something nice to drink in the winter."
"A damn nice beer, and oh so smooth! A real malt lover's treat. This was lush, soft, welcoming, a ride over slowly cresting hills. This was one of the smoothest beers I can remember, which is a testament to Kulmbacher for creating such a easy flowing, high octane (you were warned) beer. This screams for some fully bloomed Bleu cheese, all creamy & smooth, to echo the mouthfeel, or some dry aged cheddar to completely contrast it. A great sipper and cold weather brew. Definitely recommended!"
"great drinkability, for the nature fo the beer. remarkably easy drinking, all things considering. a pretty damn good beer, a bit desert-y, but obviously well crafted."
"Drinkability- One of the few of the style I have had. Good stuff, but meant for winter of fall rather than summer. Thick and strong tasty beer."
"Those who like Celebrator Dopplebock (as I do) will likely find Kulmbacher Eisbock a rewarding experience, I know I'll be keeping a six pack in the fridge."
"Overall - An amazing brew - this blew me away... it's so rich and complex and amazingly well balanced... Highly recommended.."
"Poured into a chalice a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, a nice fizzy tannish head which does not last long, basically not sticky lacing at all. The nose is sweet, malty, I'm getting some cherries, figs, raisins, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, nice touch of dark fruits, and caramel. There is a slight spiceness near the end. Medium body, well rounded brew. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, recommended."
"Poured into a belgian beer snifter the Eisbock is a deep rich brown color with an off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves relatively no lace. But when held up to natural light, the beer gives off some very impressive cranberry/mahogany hues. A very pretty color for sure. The nose is big and malty. Scents of banana, clove, prune, and date waft up out of the glass. I also get a molasses smell here too. The taste is sweet and rich, with a noticeable spicy kick at the end. Fruity sweetness (the aforementioned fruits, and some cherries as well), but also a slightly hoppy bitterness. The high alcohol is present in the taste, but does not detract too much. Strong, smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish. I'd give this beer higher marks in drinkability if it weren't so sweet up front. But it's still a fine beer, and another solid eisbock to add to the list. Worth seeking out."
"Pours a clear tawny brown/red, very rich looking, small off white head, some lace spots, leaves a solid ring. Smell is malty as hell, dark fruits, alcohol, dates/figs, light roast, very nice and complex. Taste is very malty too, toffee and dates, raisins, fruity finish, light roasted malt and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, warms on the way done but very smooth. Very nice, drinkable eisbock that tastes great and hits hard, definate winter sipper."
"like this one; time is crucial; the longer you leave it, the better it becomes!"
"One of my new favorite beers. The nose is very fruity and speaks of a little maple as well. The mouthfeel is excellent. The taste is just wonderful. It comes in a six pack which is another reason I like this beer so much. - You don't have to down a whole bomber or 750 in one sitting. Great beer. Highly recommended."
"This beer poured a deep brown color with an amber hue. The head is tan, thick and rocky. The smell is sweet and very malty. The taste is quite malty as well.there is perhaps a little spiciness as well. The mouthfeel is full and a bit syrup like. The alcohol has a warming effect as it is swallowed. Overall, Id consider this an interesting big beer that Id recommend picking up if you ever get the opportunity."
"This would probably make an excellent dessert beer. Used insuch a way, it's drinkability is high. Definitely not a session beer with it's high abv, not to mention it would probably be rather filling. While I don't rank this quite as high as the Aventinus Eisbock, I'd still happily drink this again."
"Hope to have this beer quite a few more times, and try this style out many more. This is a great and unique brew."
"The beer pours a dark cola brown color, with a hint of orange. The beer has very nice head retentention and very good lacing. The nose really comes across with cola and rootbeer, with a hint of vanilla. Not the least bit overdone and quite impressive. On the palate the beer is very rich and sweet, with lots of chocolate, vanilla and cola. The combination works very well, as the beer is just delicious. The beer has a fluffy smoothness, with a plush mouthfeel. I've had this beer on a number occasions, but today's version is just excellent. The abv. is well disguised, and hence the beer seems very, very drinkable. I was tempted to order another, but one more of these and it would time to park the car and call a cab. Excellent beer. What a treat."
"D: At 9.2%, this is a sippin' beer. Any more and you are courting trouble. Enjoy those sips though, they are good."
"Thoughts: This is my first Eisbock and it will NOT be my last. It was a nice change of pace from the Belgians and American pales I have found myself into lately. Thanks to Mike @ Davidson's Liquors here in Denver for recommending this one. He never steers me wrong!"
"11.2 oz. bottle with some code on the front label. It pours deep blood red with light carbonation and is topped with a half-inch, light tan head that leaves moderate lacing. The bouquet is quite nice, with notes of rich, syrupy dark fruits (cherries, raspberries, grapes/raisins), molasses, chocolate?, vinous malts, port wine, and maybe a dash of hops. It tastes thick and malty, with notes of caramel, molasses, dark fruits, cherries, chocolate, and a mild bitterness, but is, alas, a bit too cloying, hence the lower score. The body is thick and sugary, with low carbonation and a drying, medium to long finish. Overall a bit too cloying for my palate, but I guess thats an inherent risk when a hophead like myself samples ultra-malty beers such as eisbocks."
"Overall, I can definitely recommend this one. Relatively complex, pretty well balanced and nicely drinkable. Halfway through the glass, I've decided I like this better than EKU 28, another eisbock from this brewery."
" The taste has a nutty and fruity flavor with mild vinous dark berry aspect which is similar to cherry with dark plum and mild toasted grain in the finish with some light spice which blends with the yeast flavor. I am very pleased to have the chance to enjoy this eisbock again, it is fresh and so drinkable, very quaffable lager worth having multiple times!"
"Thanks for sending this my way Alkey!"
"Overall: A solid beer. The alcohol, although high, is hidden very well. The medium malt and low hop characteristics make this one drinkable 9.2% beer. I picked this up for a couple bucks at the local takeout bar, definately a great value. If you see one and like bachs then you won't be disappointed with this offering."
"Poured deep brown color with a brown head. some lacing but not too much. aromas of sweet malt, fruit. The taste of this beer is exceptional, smoothly malty with some coffee and chocolate accents. perhaps the faintest hop presence if any. One of the best tasting beers out there. My favorite beer in this style, by far. The mouthfeel is fine but I have trouble noticing it because of the delightful flavors of the beer. At 9.2%abv the alcohol is amazingly unobtrusive, no burn at all. This is the most drinkable high alcohol beer I've ever had."
"Notes; Delicious! What a yummy, heart-warming treat! I thought the alcohol would be more dominant, but it's the right amount IMO to balance the malty flavors. Drinks very well, and one I'll definately revisit."
"Impression: solid beer. I've had eisbocks I like more, thinking of Schneider's Aventinus. The high abv does not define or dominate the flavor, to me an unspectacular German lager with a lot of fermented malt character (and concomitant high abv). Wonderful nightcap year-round, adjust serving temperature for outdoor climate."
"Overall not a bad beer. Although smooth, this one needs to be taken slow. First time trying this style - not my first choice when going dark."
"Drinkability. It's a sipper for sure, but this isn't really my thing. Ill have to try more."
"Got a bottle of this at City Wide in South Bend. has the date 22.10.04 stamped on it, which im going to assume is the ""made on"" date, otherwise this is a spectacularly old bottle (bottle design IS different from the picture here). Pours very dark, almost black but not opaque. big foamy head disapates to just a healthy ring. Odor is of currants and booze and some chocolateness. Flavor is quite good, especially as im not usually a fan of eisbocks (mainly because so many brewers screw up the style). Tastes of fruits, including some plums and blackcurrants, as well as soft alcohol and malt flavors. Very tasty indeed. Not overly assertive but you know you're drinking a prize of a beer with this one."
"Note: It shows better as it warms up. I haven't had this in a very long time. It is a great way to wash away the memories of all the recent almost non-alcoholic Utah beer I've been trying."
"Alcohol kicks butt in this one. Watch it."
"A very dark brown pour that produces an active and frothy tan head. Heads fades quickly however leaving a settled, calm brew. The nose is large on plums for the most part with rasiny notes and a sweet zip of molasses. Wow, this is a BIG beer....The taste offers up some great complexity...semi-sweet plums off the top, again surrounded by dark molasses....some nice spice in the middle followed up by a sweet, candly-like finish with a warming alcohol trace. The initial plum notes linger nicely. Mouthfeel was somewhat creamy but headed toward a dry, slightly chalky finish. Fine drinkability, although I probably wouldn't have more than one in a sitting. It makes for a nice sipper on a cold winters night like tonight"
"Exits the bottle with a moderately thick pour showing off a dark brown color with burgundy highlights. Creates a 1/2"" thick, dense tan colored head which slowly diminishes to a spotty film. Nose shows off aromas of brandy-soaked dark fruit cake, chocolate covered malt balls, caramel, molasses and dark brown sugar along with a hefty blast of alcohol. Palate is quite thick, sticky and oily with a moderate level of carbonation present to tame the candy-like sweet aromas. Taste is rich,sweet and very malty. Lots of raisin, fig, brandy, molasses, smoked maple syrup, and burnt dark caramel notes dance lively on the tongue. Again the 9.2% alcohol comes through to warm it all up and cut down any overwhelming sweetness. Finishes with nice noticeable semi-dry roasted malt aftertaste. Also love the prism design label. Good stuff here!!"
"12oz. bottle poured a clear see through reddish/brown color with a small tan head that leaves almost no lace. Smells a bit sweet with lots of toasty malts. Taste is very malty also with some toasted and caramel flavors. It has a light feel to it and a little dryness from the alcohol which seems pretty well concealed due to the big malt flavors. This is a very easy to drink brew but the high alcohol content keeps it from being one that I would have too many of."
"D-Quite pleasant. A very relaxing and warming eisbock."
"Drinkability- Quite drinkable for an eisbock. I still think it could use more alcohol and bit more complexity however."
"Clear and dark brown with a purplish, ruby hue and a fluffy tan head. Some chunky lacing. The foam quickly settled to a ring with some fine bubbles capping the beer. The aroma was malty and fruity, with notes of raisins, plums, cocoa, and alcohol. Slight roast. There was also a bit of soy sauce when the bottle was first opened, but this quickly faded and wasn't detectable after a couple of minutes. Very sweet, a bit sugary and boozy towards the finish. Dried fruits, raisins, figs filled out the middle with soft, dark malts and a bit of licorice in the background. A light bitterness appeared near the end. Significant alcohol warmth. Lowish carbonation resulted in a fairly creamy texture. Not bad, but a little too sweet for me. Not one of my favourite eisbocks, but worth a try."
"Deep, chestnut brown color. No head to speak of. Aroma of syrupy sweetness. Somewhat sherry like. Raisens, burnt currants come to mind. Sweet malty flavor. Solvent taste-more so chemical then alcohol flavor. Very metallic like-almost like sucking on a piece of steel. Good, full mouthfeel to it. Not overly syrupy. An ok eisbock. The ""different"" flavors to it knock it down a peg or two."
"D - A very tasty beer, very filling, 9.2% abv....my kind of beer."
"Malty and rich, this is a sweet beer, and that might put some off, but others who love sweeter beers will find a well-balanced sipper here."
"Drinkability - I don't think I could drink 3 of these in a row. The taste migh not agree with me, but that is just me. It is almost like somekind of beer/wine/mixed drink. I will buy it again though."
"D - Very impressive drinkability, due in part to the well hidden alcohol. Recommended."
"Makes for the perfect nightcap on a cold, windy eve."
"Pours light cola brown and clear with a small creamy, cream colored head that recedes quickly. Aroma is large sweet maltiness, some ripe fruitiness and light pruney aroma. Also some buttery toffee sweetness and breadiness in the aroma. Taste is a big sweet malt bomb with some white grape and cola flavor. There is a light amount of alcohol in the taste that is well balanced and nicely warming. Light to medium body with a little tingle from the warming alcohol, no discernible hops here. Sweet and delicious a nice night cap today."
"An outstanding beer that hides its alcohol content very well."
"This is a strange beer. I haven't had anything quite like it yet. Very sweet, with various fruit flavors emerging as I drink. It almost smells like fruitjuice. I'm not enjoying this too much. Just too sweet for me. This is my first experience with an Eisbock, and it's not looking too good. I may try another if one is recommended, but this one is not for me."
"A clean dark brown beer with deep mahogony hightlights. Has a small creamy beige head. There is a strong chocolate character to the aroma with hints of coffee and vanilla lingering in the background. It pours like silk into your mouth. The cascade of flavors over your tongue include sweet nutmeats, chocolate, caramel and coffee. A sensory dizzying experiance. A bittersweet chocolate and coffee note finish things off. And then there's the alcohol warm tummy. Yumm yumm in the tumm tumm."
"D- I'd sip it all night."
"Kulmbacher Eisbock was a dark red brown color with a tan head. The head was average in size but soon dissipated to a thin spotty layer. The aroma was fruity, malty, alcoholic and very interesting. The taste was sweet, malty and fruity upront and finished dry with warming alcohol. The body was full and lighly carbonated. Drinkability was good, but it is definately a sipper. Overall this is an excellent beer. Recommended."
"Really, quite an enjoyable brew and an interesting style. I have a few bottles of this, definitely going to try aging one and seeing if it can develop a little more. Recommended for something refreshingly different."
"A very nice Eisbock and a treat to drink. Very enjoyable on a cool fall evening."
"D: Quite good considering the strength!"
"Opinion: This is a good beer. The malts come across as a tad heavy, but that is not a flaw since they concentrated this beer. A beer like this is hard to make. There is very little (if any) support from the hops, so the finish is a tad cloying...but the alcohol quickly takes care of that. I am really enjoying this beer, but I surely couldn't drink too many as you can tell that it is strong (Starkbier!). I would drink this one again...later."
"Makes for an outstanding dessert beer."
"Drinkability: It took me a while to put this one down, I don't know if it's the style or this one in particular, but I wasn't a big fan."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a nice brown color beer with a medium foamy head with above average retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet cookie dough with dry figs and raisins. Taste is quite sweet without being disgustingly sweet with some dry gigs, cookie dough and plums. Body is about average and alcohol is well hidden. Very good beer and Im sure it would be interesting to cellar a few of those."
"Dark brown beer pours with a half-inch head that quickly fades to a tiny edging of bubbles around the glass. Aroma has nice dark malt, fruit, tobacco, and almost a bourbon note from the alcohol esters. Flavor is pretty complex. Starts of a bit sweet and fruity, like chocolate covered plums, then moves to a little more roasted flavors, quickly to alcohol sweetness, and then a nice bit of bittering. Alcohol flavor also lingers as it warms the esophagus. There's a good bit of just plain old malty goodness up in the front of the flavor as well. Takes a few sips to really pull it out for me. After a few sips, there seems to be a lingering sweetness, almost saccharin-like in taste. Mouthfeel is solid, carbonation a bit brisk. Drinkability is ok, but the sweetness gets a little tiring after a while. A bit more bitterness would go a long way in balancing this one out, but it's a good sipper for a cold winter evening. But for similar malt flavors, more complexity, and better balance, I'll dake a dark blegian ale over this any day."
"P.S. That bottle is my photo!"
"Overall, smooth with a sharp alcoholic bite. Rich and complex, a good choice for an occasional ""sipping"" dessert drink."
"I used to like the malty beers more than I do now. This one is quite sweet but not overbearing. It just seems like an eisbock would be a little more coating and heavy than this. I'll have to get some Aventinus Eisbock and compare!"
"pours with only about an inch of head, after that it goes away just as fast as it bubbled up. no much carbonation at all as expected. Tastes wonderful goes down easy even at its high 9.2 abv, the alcohol doesn't bite at all. reall an exceptional Bock, and not that expensive"
"Very thick mouthfeel but yet a thin finish. Easily drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden."
"Overall an interesting beer. I am intrigued by the flavor, but I think overall I dont like the flavor more than I do like. However, it is a nice beer to sit and sip on, but Id prefer others to sip."
"D - Very solid Eisbock. As with most eisbocks the alcohol will quickly sneak up on you. I definitely would seek this one out again."
"Pours a dark brown with red tint when held to the light. It has almost no head which disapears quickly to a very tiny film around the glass. Smells of overripe apples, raisins, something plumlike, with a tiny bit of citrus at the end. The taste is of dark fruits (plum,grape, mainly raisin), caramel, and a slight hint of lemon zest, Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with excellent coating. The aftertaste is lingering and only then is the alcohol really noticed. Very warming, so you cannot have many of them, but still fairly easy to drink at 9.2 percent. This is my first eisbock and i think i will return to the style after this. Especially in the winter months."
"Tastes of caramel and toffee. Raisins abd plum. Lightly sour. All flavors a bit muted so not very overpowering. Big in the mouth though. Sticky but again muted enough so as not to be cloying. Sneaky smooth for 9.2 ABV. Pretty tasty stuff."
"Dark brown color wirh some hints of ruby at the bottom part of the glass. It leaves almost no head but a wisp of foam stays on the top. Smell is of caramel and nuts--hazelnut, pistachios. Taste is much the same with a cherry or fruity essence on the finish. There is also a slight metallic quality noticed.Pretty sticky mouthfeel but that is somewhat expected for this style. A good beer but it is not really the ideal style during the middle of July."
"Taste is heavy on the prune flavors, with some grape, raisin and currant elements to boot. The only real complaint is the heafty alcohol isn't completely hidden, and shows itself in the mouthfeel more than I'd like. Still, quite a good beer, and one I'll look for again."
"Super dark body with the faintest traces of reddish edges, almost cola look. Head is just over an inch thick. Nose is sweet booze followed by dark cherries, buttery caramel, and brown sugar. I can taste black cherries, rum and caramel closed out by light sugar. This really is a pleasure to sip on. It tantalizes the tongue. The alcohol isn't completely hidden but it seems to add to the flavor in a pleasurable way. A nice eisbock for a very cheap price."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty sweet with a long, warm finish. A great nightcap."
"D: Extremely thick and sweet, but cloying and overbearing. Very good bock style beer."
"Drinkability is a solid, BAM! Give me another! If I can find a way to deal with the 9.2% ABV, Zowee! This is some impressive brew. Zum Wohl! Und Prosit. MK"
"Drinkability: this is a dangerous brew. Easy to drink and enjoyable, but the alcohol is up front enough to warn you about having too many in a session."
"Deep brown/coffee like color with slight ruby hues. Strong tangy dark malt sensations hit the nose with hints of nutty raisin. Alcohol is not too strong luckily. The flavor is more brown sugary malt with a slight hint of chocolate. Very sweet and lightly tangy. Mouthfeel is nice, medium thickness, decent carbonation. The drinkablity rates well as surprisingly this beer is not that alcoholic, nor is it too rich for the palate. Nice flavor and a fine Eisbock..."
"Drinkability is good, the alcohol noticed seems to belong and aides the flavors."
"Very very worth a try."
"Dark brown with ruby tints. Head was non-existent despite a strong pour. The aroma was raisins with a slight whiff of alcohol. Taste was similar, with some toast and pepper at the end. Very smooth mouthfeel, with the carbonation making it almost creamy. A very good brew, would probably enjoy more in the winter, and would probably not want to drink too many."
"Extremely high drinkability for the ABV, proceed with caution."
"The 11.2 oz bottle pours a bright dark toffee color with hints of ruby into a pilsener glass. A good three quarter inch head drops quickly to a light persistent ring. Beautiful color very similar to Ayinger Celebrator, the aroma as well is reminiscent of Ayinger's Dopplebock. Malty sweet with a distict caramel tone. The Eisbocks taste is a perfect match for the smell, malty sweet caramel malts with definite toffee tones and a hint of chocolate. A good bitterness rounds things out. The alcohol is noticable, though not prominent, this beer would be great on a cold rainy day. A nice medium mouthfeel, slighty cloying, but not overly so. I would definitely have more than one right now, given the option. This is a very nice beer."
"Quite drinkable, in spite of its complexity and pop. I have no idea how old it is, thanks to my total idiocy, but I'm willing to bet that age has treated this well. The fruit complexities are great, and the alcohol is not at all overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Just the one, thank you. Whew."
"Pours deep mahogany with a thick head, very carbonated. Was rather pungent in the nose, moderately heavy sweet caramels and fruits (bananas and other pseudo syrupy smells). Taste was also sweet, as expected, but was not syrupy like an ice wine. So, yes sweet and rather heavy but I was expecting more (which would have been overwhelming). Very impressed, although you probably don't want to choose this as a session beer by any means, something very unique and enjoyable to try."
"Drinkability is good but could easily get overbearing. I really like this beer but I'm definitely feeling it after doing a side by side comparison with the New Glarus Eisbock."
"Good beer to accidentally stumble upon. Since I had no prior expectations of the beer, I asked the bartender to serve it up. Pleasantly surprised with the full, rich, caramelly, nutty aroma. After tasting, I would have easily mistaken it for a dopplebock. Heavy, ruby color projects a haze and expected head retention. Thick and nearly chewey, the texture blends well into the heavy malts, dates, figs flavors. The sugars and density hides the high alcohols very well. A great winter time beer, even if sampled in the spring."
"Overall, not bad. Variety is the spice of life!"
"Drinkability is rather good, though the sweetness make keep me from wanting more than a couple of these at a time."
"Beer is good. Happy eis-beering."
"Very complex on the palate, heavy on the roasted malts and dark fruits, the raisin and molasses, and is beautifully matched with a heartwarming alcohol slide and creamy smooth mouth. A slightly strong finish with the alcohol at its warmest, bready and sweet, and lasts. It just makes you smile. Delicious."
"This beer is very delish; a great example of the style. It's so smooth, it just pours down my throat. Alcohol is very well hidden. I could drink this all day! (Or not!)."
"Very drinkable for a beer of this caliber, and most definitely a sipping beer. I could drink several of these in a row, but why bother? This eisbock is one to be savored and enjoyed."
"Taste; toasted caramel malts with some sweet molasses, and very rich. The vinous quality comes through in the flavor as well, with some grapes, and other dark fruits. There's also a bit of a nutty taste in the finish to go along with a slight alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is full bodied, and very creamy. This goes down pretty easy, though it's definiely one to sip."
"For such a rich and high alcohol beer, it goes down pretty easy. Even though I have no problem easily downing the pint, something tells me not that I don't want more, but that I don't need more. Its that nice fufilled ""one is enough"" feeling."
"This rich brown/garnet beauty poured a small tan head that did not last long. The initial aroma was of fruit and was sweet; reminded me of grape juice. As the beer warmed the caramel malt and fusel alcohol characteristics came out in the aroma. The mouthfeel is full, smooth with a good alcohol bite. The flavor is full, molasses-y but balanced by the alcohol warmth. The finish is my favorite part of this beer. It has reserved phenolics that blend well with the dark caramel flavors that last forever but without being overbearing. Get it, drink it, experience the Eisbock!!"
"D- A rare treat that opens the eyes to a beer / style you never knew existed and having shared a brew, wanting more!"
"Mouthfeel is medium. Coats the mouth well and hangs around for a while. Drinkability is okay. A unique flavor and noticeable alcohol make this a sipper. Its definitely noticeable on my stomach. This one might have suffered a bit in the voyage over, making it a bit muted. Ill stick with my Aventinus."
"This eisbock poured a clear, deep garnet color with creamy, light brown foam that persisted, clinged, coated, and left lace on the glass. The smell was malty with a hint of cocoa and a distinct Munich malt aroma. The taste was malty and lightly sweet, with some Munich malt fruitiness, moderate hoppiness, and a taste of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel was very, very smooth with medium-full body and modest carbonation. This beer was warming, and had a light sweetness in the finish and aftertaste. This was an enjoyable beer."
"Sweet almost maple syrup smell mixed in with some strong malt aroma as well. Dark brown tinged with red. Wafer thin head. Big malt flavor with molassess and maple syrup in the finish. A very faint hint of spice and dark fruits in the very last part of the after taste."
"Dark brown, but not opaque. Light khaki head that doesnt last too long. Turns to a ring. Nose of whiskey malt, butter/marmite toast, alcohol. Weird but inviting. Sweet sugary malt with a vegetal edge. Whiskey alcohol with a soapy vanilla sweetness. Interesting. Like a toned-down Samichlaus. Full-bodied, silky/soapy, and syrupy in the finish."
"Cheers!"
"Overall very tasty and I will buy again the next time I see it."
"Very tasty, but definitely a one-at-a-timer."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4"" light brown head over the beautiful clear dark burgundy brew. Dense head lasts very nicely, with slow fading lacing with lots of foamy bits. Aroma is dark malt sweetness, dark fruits, and easily apparent alcohol, all melded together into a creamy scent. Taste is smooth dark grains upfront, in the middle, and at the close, with a touch of alcohol warming all the way down. Mouthfeel and drinkability were incredible for a brew of this abv. Scary drinkable, will have to pick this up again."
"12oz bottle with a prisim like label - pretty cool. Pours a deep mahogony brown with a 1 finger dark tan head, OK longevity and OK lace. Smells of heavy caramel malt with dark fruit, hints of vanilla and coffee. This is an awesome beer. Rich caramel malt flavors mixed with dried dark fruit (fig, raisin etc.) Vanilla and coffee are pesent on a lesser note. Alcohol is present but for 9%, its not that noticeable Very creamy, thick and smooth. Clean and complex. A bit pricey for a sixer at $13, but a damn fine beer. A beautiful example of the style. I think I will keep my other 3 in the fridge until next winter."
"This beer poured a deep brown with some red hues coming through. It had a quarter-inch head almost caramel in color and a decent amount of carbonation. Smelled very strongly of raisins with a slight bready smell and undertones of chocolate. Taste was rich with malts and fairly alcoholic through the middle. Very sweet. Mouthfeel was lighter than I expected but still syrupy, and seemed to go down smoothly. I tend to enjoy thick and creamy but this was pleasant change. I don't know if I would recommend several drinks in a sitting, but it says ""enjoy me after dinner""."
"This is a mighty tasty beer - drinkable, crisp, malty, flavorful, and with a kick."
"Although I have had a few Eisbocks over the past couple of years, I believe this is the first one I have reviewed. Per the Reinheitsgebot there appears to be much consistency within the parameters of the style. She pours a deep ruby red color with a tawny head that dissipates quickly. There is a surprising amount of carbonation, although hard to see, considering this is such a high gravity brew. The aroma is not necessarily complex; however, beyond the overwhelming presence of malt, there is a good representation of a fresh hoppy smells as well as some stewed fruits. The palate is defined by a somewhat syrupy start and the signature eisbock astringent finish. The flavor is sweet and intense (similar to some American barley wines) with a defined crisp, yet delayed, hop finish. A good, well balanced beer, but not one that bowled me over."
"Poured an opaque brown into my goblet. Proffered a healthy ½ inch head which devolved into creamy lacing. Exquisite smell of spiced fruits. Tastes of toffee and a hint of butterscotch. In many ways it resembles a doppelbock, but with a much more serious character. Later had a taste of raisins. Had a creamlike mouthfeel with light carbonation. Left a palatable alcohol aftertaste. An admirable offering, but at $13.99/6-pk, reserved for special occasions."
"I drank a lot of this during thanksgiving out of the 22 Oz sized bottle and it wasn't nearly as good. For the big bottle subtract a whole point from all these scores; it was good but not great."
"BB 10-02-06. Good beige and lasting head and dark brown almost black beer. Nose is strong and alcoholic, good roasty chocolate like maltyness and a porty note. Taste is heavy alcoholic with plumb and citrussyfruity touched maltbomb. Again very rich malty giving some roast, caramellic and darkmalted overall. Not too sweet and brew can handle it and overall very full and tasty. Well drinkable and recomendable if you like the style."
"Taste: Flavors of dark cherries, raisins, and molasses mirrored the aroma. A light burnt flavor hovered underneath. Some spirit-like alcohol came through in the middle. The finish and aftertaste were where the sweetness really developed, along with some light spices, but it never became too strong."
"overall a great brew and definitely worth a try."
"Pours a dark, bloody garnet with a few mm's of whitish head. Nose is rich and malty, with some caramel sweetness to balance the grainy bitterness. Taste follows suit, this stuff truly is liquid bread with sweet and bitter malts and a considerable warming presence thanks to the 9.2%. Mouthfeel is super rich and chewy like sourdough bread. I could probably handle a couple of these but would be full and in need of a nap afterwards. A formidable eisbock here."
"Very dark brown with a slight redish hue. Head did'nt last long,and no lacing. Smell is sweet,with a hint of roasting.Mouthfeel is silky,with a bite. Taste is rich, and sweet. The alchol comes through big in the finish. I would recommend trying this beer soon!"
"I will really enjoy this one and am quite curious to know how this style ages...this is my first Eisbock, but I imagine this one would cellar quite well."
"Only a 3.5 for drinkability though, as I wouldn't exactly crave this stuff in a July heatwave."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, thick and syrupy. Very full bodied and while not cloying it was kind of clingy. Great beer for a chilly night."
"Drinkability: A fantastic beer, but slightly too sweet to have more than one of. I feel like I had my dessert already, and I haven't even had dinner! A great after-dinner beer or nightcap, but don't plan on making a session out of it."
"Drinkability: Very much like a dessert in itself, even more so than some Imperial or American Double Stouts. I only say 3.5 because it's so rich that I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. However, I'm surely enjoying myself as I finish the bottle on the other side of the coin. Surely more than worth a try, and I can't wait to try some other Eisbocks (as I'm pretty new to the style)."
"Drinkability was quite good. I wish this one was still available."
"drinkability: Not very drinkable, but considering the alcohol content, that is most likely a good thing. I can feel the warming in my stomach and the loosening effects of the alcohol after finishing half the bottle."
"Smooth mouth that doesn't stick or burn. One of the more drinkable versions of this style."
"Drinkability is superb for an eisbock. One of the better ones of the style that I've had."
"Dark brown with a ruby glow around the edges. The head starts off big and creamy but for some reason dissapears. The smell is sweet with alcohol and roasted malts. A full body with a syrupy texture. Sweet alcohol hits the tongue at first and rounds off with roasted malts. Has a minimal sweetness and a sweet finish. Big and malty. Kind of a switch up for a hop head like me."
"A solid Eisbock. Poured out to a murky brown red color with a nice 1 inch head that held up well throughout the beer. No lacing was noted. Medium carbonation level. Aromas of dark fruits, spice and malt are well balanced. Taste is along the same lines at the smell; flavors of dark plumbs and grapes dominate, with a slightly spicy touch that renders the 9.2% ABV very well concealed. Finish is a bit malty and tart, with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich. This brew is best as a sipper, but could also be consumed similar to a dark lager. I wouldn't have more than one of these at a time, but it would make for a great after-dinner treat from time to time. Recommended."
"Very drinkable as a night-cap or a dessert."
"Overall, this is a fine drink. My first Eisbock and I am very impressed by this one. Flavorful and smooth, while still bold and heavy. High abv is not unpleasant in anyway. But still this is a sipper, best enjoyed on a cool night."
"Pours into a snifter a very deep brown (almost black) with a nice tan head that doesnt stick around. Aroma is very malty and sweet, with hints of caramel and molasses, toasted bread, rum soaked raisins and plums and of course alcohol. Flavor is again very malty with strong alcohol notes; big molasses flavor along with dark fruit notes (plum, raisin and fig), toasted bread, hay and a slight floral and grassy hops background with strong alcohol overtones. Mouthfeel is crisp with a big body and moderate carbonation, the finish is sweet and phenolic with a strong alcohol bite. Interesting beer for sure, but the alcohol is almost overwhelming, i could see 6 months or a year mellowing this beer out alot and increasing the drinkability and complexity."
"Sweet & incredibly malty. Caramel, some light touches of dark fruit. Dries up just enough to keep it from becoming cloying. The strong alcohol that was hinted at is very nicely meshed into the flavour. Full bodied, smooth & rich. Easy carbonation. A nice & hearty nightcap."
"Bottled version: Bottled on 10/24/2004. Used to have a German friend of mine ""smuggle"" this out of Germany in the 90s, before it was ""legally"" available in the USA. This is everything that I look for in a beer. Very deep brown, almost black color. Aroma is a mix of complex smells; dark fruit, malt/bread and yeasty. Taste is even more complex, with a proniunced malt character throughout. Hard to capture in words; suffice it to say that this would be my last beer on my way to see my Maker. Although very high in ABV, very drinkable. Definitely don't drive after a session with this one. Beer nirvana fer sure!"
"Very very drinkable... I could definitely get myself in some trouble with this beer. The high alcohol is hardly traceable in the taste, but you can certainly feel it. Immensely enjoyable beer."
"Color is dark. Almost black, with hints of ruby at the edges. Poured into my snifter, there's a hefty dose of brown head that dies quickly, yet offers moderate rings of lace on the glass. Aromas are chock full of malt sweetness. Caramel. Dark fruit notes (plums? raisins?). Same for the flavor, with an infusion of alcohol kick as well. Sugary finish with belly-warming ABV. Exception to this lovely beer was the much thinner than expected mouthfeel. Just left me wanting more OOMPH! Very drinkable."
"The body is a dark brownish red hue. Smallish tan head that left some webbings of lace. Sweet and malty aroma with notes of dark fruits. Some caramel and light roasted malt are there as well. Sweet fruit and caramel malt up front on the flavor. Lighter notes of chocolate and molasses are in the mix. Its sweet but not to sweet and the alcohol is kept in check for the most part. Pretty good thickness to it and its a bit sticky from the sweetness. Still goes down smooth and drinks well for the strength."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet sweet malty scent that boasts of crystal, roasted, and pale malts. It has a warm feel as well as a dry fruity lager yeast aroma. The taste is great. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and warm. It has an elevated abv., but it still goes down easy. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's full of malty flavor and a smooth, easy drinkabilty."
"Drinkability: Due to the high alcohol content, this beer is good once in a while but really not a session drink. A really nice beer that is affordable at under $2.00 a bottle."
"$2.49 for a 12 oz. bottle at Once Upon a Vine."
"Wow, I never got around to rating this. I'm suprised. These notes were taken at a recent tasting with a friend in Philly. Dark cola and rum coloured beverage, with a similar stature and fizzy little khaki hiead that dies from a quick booze binge death! Aromas are all candy sweet and alcoholic. Doughy malts hold it together but the hops are kinda missing and replaced with macerated and dried dark fruits, walnuts, and more. Taste is fiery but the booze is controlled by the sweet thick, syrupy, maple and fruit flavor of this one. Mouthfeel is thick and tingly, drinkability is good, but it *is* an eisbock, and therefore I couldn't do anymore than 12oz by myself and even that is pushing it!"
"Poures a deep rich tawny brown a larger than expected light brown head,aromas of orange dipped in chocolate stick out most with an underlying woodiness,the alcohol is light but noticable.A very smooth mouthfeel to this beer ist slides down very easy,hard to believe this is 9.2% as easy as it goes down for me.Flavors really come out more as it warms the raisin aspects really show more along with sweet caramel with almost a lactic type flavor in the finish.Very complex but like I said easy going down for such a big beer,really enjoyed this one."
"Final thoughts: excellent if you like dense, sweet beers."
"A bit too thick for my tastes. I guess I'm not comparing it properly against this unfamiliar style, but as a beer it is just too syrupey for me."
"Drinkability is very solid. Nicely crafted beer. Generally have to be in the mood for these types of beers but this one is balanced enough to provide solid experience at any time."
"Drinkability: A sipper to be sure. One to savor and enjoy. A nice style and would make for a great nightcap. Strongly recommended."
"Cheers"
"How can this beer be only $1.95 a bottle???"
"This I like. Not a bad buy at $11 for six. The first of the sixer had an off-flavor of some polymer plastic resin sort. That was the only one with this, so we'll call that a fluke. The rest have been great. Will buy again. Foolishly drinkable for 9.2% ABV, I might add."
"* - Bonus points to anyone who remembered Hulk Hogan's awful TV appearances on behalf of Right Guard in which he used this phrase."
"This beer kind of misfired for me. It was freshly delivered from Boston, thank you Clarkvv. A nice brown colour, but kind of sourish, some malts and toffee and stuff to sweeten some toastedness, lacking complexity to go with dinner. The Niagara Eisbock versions are sure a whole lot better."
"Smooth, full mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. Quite easy to drink. A few of these would be nice on a cold night. I'll be seeking this one out again sometime!"
"Provides a nice warming as I sip from a tulip glass. A very enjoyable late winter night's friend."
"My first eisbock, and from the limited worldwide selection it is probably one of the few different ones I'll ever try. Unless more brewers give it a shot. Kulmbacher Eisbock is dark brown in color with a short and tan head. Aroma is of really dark and rich malts, this presents a figgy smell. Taste is very full of malts, almost syrupy, with dark fruit flavors. Distinct alcohol taste is also fairly strong. I like the overall taste of this beer, but the alcohol taste and high ABV combined hamper the drinkability for me."
"My first eisbock. I enjoyed it but I struggled to describe it well."
"This beer has an espresso crema streaked light tan head and a dark brown body that allows light to pass through it. It has rootbeer characteristics in the nose and a roasty sweet espresso and cream taste. Light bubblegum notes in the taste as well. It has a nicely balanced sweet and hoppy aftertaste."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for the trade. This beer is dark brown/copper with a thin light tan head. Very little lacing. The aroma is very sweet with caramel, raisins and malt. Medium-bodied and chewy with a flavor that is very unique. It has some aspects of a Barley Wine, a Scotch Ale, and a Bock. Syrupy sweet with malt, molasses, raisins and brown sugar. There is a faint woody character at times too. The finish continues the sweetness but there is a bit of hops bitterness there. I am really unfamiliar with this style but I like it."
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer was a complete and absolute joy to drink. Everything was just about right. I had Kulmbacher's EKU 28 last night, and this Eisbock is 1000 times better. A powerful sipping beer that will keep you interested for many hours to come. I love this beer, and can't wait to get more."
"12 oz bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and consumed in January 2005. Hard pour necessary to get a one-finger tan head over a black liquid. To the light, it's a deep brown mohogeny color and is crystal clear. Smells of caramel chocolatey/coffee and alcohol. Oh, tastes divine! Alcohol persists gently throughout, but the malt sweet jumps in several times in several different incarnations. First caramel then subsiding, then chocolatey then subsiding, then toffee-ish. Any hopping is low. Fine carbonation rises off the flat of my tongue and forms a mild acid that cooperates with the alcohol burn. The ending is alcohol and leaves a dry malty aftertaste. Medium thick body. This beer does not sit on my tongue like syrup, which is good, because the sweet would probably be too much. Boy, the toffee & bock mix very well over the alcohol base in a way I've never had before. Also, acid from carbonation can be hell with some beer characteristics (such as sour or alcohol), but this one turns the potential downfall into an asset. This truly is a work of art...get it if you can find it."
"A very dark coppery brown with a thin tan head. The aroma is rich with prunes and chocolate (combined with the malt, its almost like a liquid prune brownie.) The flavor is sweet and rich with caramel added to that prune brownie. The body is thick and the brew is warming as it goes down. Its odd how this beers 9.2% ABV warms on the way down while some beers 12% ABV are hardly noticed."
"Had this on tap at Rich-O's Public House. Pours a brown color with a small head that leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma smelled just like hot wort. Sweet and sticky with some dark fruit. The flavor didn't match what I'm used to with an Eisbock. Very smooth and enjoyable, even slightly mild. Nice flavors of dark fruits with a bready feel. Finishes smooth with a slight bitter bite. Body is just right on this one and the drinkability is very good for having 9.2% abv."
"On-tap poured into a chalice. It pours a ruby/brown color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell has some dark fruit and a weird fresh wort smell, fairly grainy. The taste is malty and sweet, with some grapes and a hint of alcohol. More of that new wort grain flavor. The mouthfeel is fairly nice and the drinkability is great for 9.2% abv. Different, but good."
"Sampled off tap at Rich-O's Saturnalia festival. 10oz, served in an Aventinus Eisbock glass. The beer poured a rubied brown color wtih one finger of head that sticks heavy atop the beer. The nose was rum-raisin, bready, almost wort-like. Very full aromas, and very good. The flavor was mellow, but full, with raisins and figs blending into a nice bit of bready tones. The beer was thickand easy drinking and all around good. Compared to the other eisbock beers I've had recently,this one stands very tall. Such a nice beer. It renewed my faith in the style."
"I finally got to try this brew at a meeting last night, what a treat! It pours dark brown with moderate creamy head that leaves heavy lace. Aromas of sweet caramel malts, dates, molasses, and alcohol-laden fruitcake. Huge flavors of creamy caramel, dried fruits, sherry, sweet-rolls, with a nice touch of spicy hops rounding out the finish. Creamy, velvety mouthfeel that is tongue-coating and thick. Heavy bodied with soft carbonation. I felt like I was drinking a creme brule', in a good way. A thouroughly enjoyable beer!"
"Pours a thick purple/brown color, with only a small amount of foam on top that is quickly beheaded. Smell is very alcoholic, lots of raisin and sweet maltiness. Taste is sweet and full, with alcohol playing a large part of the experience. Mouthfeel is fairly slick and full, but it is somewhat offset by the adequate carbonation."
"I can't lie, the main reason I got this beer was the kick ass label. How could you pass up a label that has sparklies and shimmers all over it? I know it doesn't sound too manly, but hey, it's a cool logo. At any rate, it was an equally good beer. Very deep in color with a nice fluffy head to it. the head lasted a while, then went out to a laceing. The smell was good as well, with smells of ""heavy"" malts, dark fruits, and a small hint of alcohol. The taste was similar, but a lot smoother than I pictured it would be. I thought it would be a little harder to swallow, due to the high alcohol content, but that prooved to be the contrary. Very drinkable, for the simple reason that it had high alocohol in it and it was smooth. That alone is good enough reason to knock a few back! Very good brew to keep you warm during the cold winter nights."
"This is a fantastic beer for a cold winter afternoon, and though it is 9.2 % ABV one of these, defintitely two, will warm you up."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer a lot and I think I will be making a trip back to LB's to try it again before the keg is gone."
"Rust colored and slightly hazy pour had low carbonation and miniscule head. The aroma was wine like  sweet, raisiny, and with no indication of hops. The taste was vinous, dry, and sweet, with notes of grapes, brown sugar, and molasses, and just a hint of smoke. The alcohol content was very well hidden with no burn whatsoever, and the mouthfeel was satiny soft. Very drinkable for such a bold brew concentrated by freezing."
"Pours with the appearance of Coca-Cola, only thicker. This actually describes the body, head, and carbonation quite well - just like a Coke. Very complex nose, with notes of toffee, prunes, molasses, and raisins. Palate is equally complex. Almost a pure molasses taste up front, deepening to dried fruit and a malty sweetness. Finish is relatively dry, with an almost briny character. Thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. And man, does this pack a whallop. I've had about two ounces and am already starting to feel a bit drunk. That of course cuts down on the drinkability - at 9.2% it's difficult to drink an entire bottle on your own, and it's smaller than 12oz. Regardless, this is a very nice beer."
"This is a substantial, full-flavored brew. It pours almost balck, but with very little head. Smell is rich nand malty with essence of plums/raisins. Taste doe not disappoint. Rich malty falvor throughout to a semi-dry finish. Fruity essence with a detectable alcohol taste, but hardly overpowering for the abv. Mouthfeel is rich and full, close to syrupy. Very easy to drink for the high abv. This is my second brew from this brewery and both have been very good (EKU 28 was the other) This would defintely be a winter warmer in January. Highly recommended."
"This brew has a black colored body with brown trim when held to the light. Nice cascading effect with the head, its a bubbly tan head. The scent is a heavy chocolate malt smell, similar to a barleywine. The taste is a big bang of malts, chocolate and sweet, hint of alcohol but well masked. Hops just barely audible. Smooth creamy feel to the beer. This is a big bold beer, with a nice malty taste."
"Special thanks to brewandbbq for sending along bottle #21472 (brewed on July 11, 1996) as an extra to a trade in 2010; a 14 year old beer that still drinks beautifully - a bit lighter in color than the one I reviewed but still with plenty of carbonation (in fact it looks better than the one I reviewed); the fusel alcohol has faded and the beer has taken on a lovely nutty flavor"
"I've had some better eisbocks but this one is very nice."
"This brew could be labeled the little brother of EKU 28."
"Kulmbacher's stunning Eisbock greets you with rich, caramel-drenched maltiness at every step of the way. It's aroma is bright and alluring; almost like fresh, sweet wort in the brew kettle, and in fact, the aroma can be enjoyed in and of itself, with inotes of deeply baked oatmeal cookies, caramel, raisins, prunes, subtle chocolate, and waft of alcohol. The bold malt flavor conquors the palate with an onslaught of almost-burnt brown sugar that mellows across the palate to reveal deep caramel, toasty grains, splashes of raisin, a light slap of alcohol, a swirl of floral/herbal hops, prunes, and then lingering bitterness, black licorice candy, and a hint of coffee-like roastiness. Wow! For lovers of big, rich beers, this is a cannot-miss. A classic of the style!"
"Brilliantly clear deep garnet hue. Head recedes into a lean, frothy layer. Rough, sparse lace remains. Suggestions of fresh, moist pipe tobacco, candied plums, and rum soaked raisinbread caress the nose. Swirling and time release gentle wafts of dark chocolate and a kiss of herbal hops. Absolutely seductive aromawise. In flavor, upfront is a toothsome mélange of unrefined brown sugar, dried dates and concentrated caramel. Sweetness is lightly offset by an undertone of deeply toasted malt, with trace roasty hints, but this brew is nearly bereft of hop bitterness. Hop flavor integrates agreeably, in its mildly floral, and slightly herbal tones. Black licorice and peppery ethanol arise mid palate to provide contrast to the pervasive sweetness. Surprisingly lightly bodied. A notch more viscosity would have bolstered the hefty malt backbone aptly. Turns lightly nutty late, with hints of carmelized almond leading into the sweet, yet thin and immaculately clean finish. A true dessert beer that envelops, but weighs heavily on the palate. Superbly crafted and really a quintessential eisbock. I'd love to taste the doppelbock from which this is derived, before it was ""eised."" Will the alcohol in this brew negate the impending sugar rush? I could run a marathon right now..."
"Drinkability & Notes: A prime example for the style and quite balanced too boot."
"Overall an exceptional eisbock. Also I believe I tried the new model of this beer because the bottle is different from the picture that is posted. A must try for eisbock fans. The fruity flavors warming alcohol mix perfect together"
"6 months bottle. Big props to TAR Finely laced thin off-white head over a dark molasses brown hue. Deeply rich aroma, sweet as expected, but bearing woody and lots of smoked undertones. The great chocolatey malt is intertwined with the candyish toffee. Subdued hop profile complements the malt fest with dignity. In one word, the aroma is effective. A first sip reveals its awe-inspiring complexity. This is rich and decadent, smoky with superb chocolate flavors. Understated fruitiness, maple and mildly bitter tobacco finish. Medium to full bodied with appropriate carbonation, rather restrained not to disturb and to let the malt expands as it deserves to. Wonderful and extremely contemplative lager, not unlike celebrator."
"Pours black with brownish hues and a nice head that fades quickly leaving a fizzy tan ring. Carbonation is present and the smell is of dark roasted malts and bit of cherry. Very aromatic. The taste is crisp but the esters of this beer swirl around the tongue and leave a delicious aftertaste. Very fruity and suprisingly strong. There is a bit of alcohol that warms the stomach but this is a very nice brew. Sweet fruits of cherry and plum come to mind with bits of spices to make your tastebuds cry out for more. This is an overall pleasing beer that I wouldn't mind enjoying anyday of the week."
"Generous head that fades to a ring and ruby-black color. The aroma is malty-sweet, alcoholic, cherry Twizzlers candy, and has some winey notes. Flavor is filled with alcohol warmth and sweetness mingled with sweet malts and brandy-like flavors. Finishes warm, sweet and alcoholic. A complex, strong and interesting beverage best suited for sipping after dinner."
"Mouthfeel is phenomenal. Silky smooth, clean, and light carbonation. This is one of the best bodied beers I've ever let roam my mouth. Great taste, full of pleasing aromas, and a killer body. What more could you want?"
"this is very drinkable and much more relaxed and restrained than eku 28."
"Pours a clear deep dark amber color that is topped by a light brown head. Intense aromas of malt waft from my glass; meaty, dark malts, and alcohol. The taste is smooth, thick, and creamy. Lightly sweet and very well integrated. The alcohol is well hidden as well. Damn this beer is a malty wonderland, only a hint of hop bitterness. The malt certainly plays center stage here, as it should in a bock. This is so smooth, no harsh notes to take away from the thick malt flavors, this beer is ripe with melanoids, and notes of raisins too. Just a great beer that demonstrates the characteristic bock flavors wonderfully."
"It pours a dark brown (almost black) with some ruby highlights and a tan head. The aroma is malty and grainy with some metallic and fruit notes. It is really complex with tastes of plums, dark fruit, and cherries that seem to linger in the aftertaste. It is almost syruppy and has a slight grainy feel to it and finishes with quite a punch of peppery alcohol. Very nice."
"Yes, I love hops, and crave them at times, but malt sure has its place too. The flavor is so clear and crisp that it presents itself distinctly and concisely. Put it in a milkshake and you'd have an old fashioned malted, I swear. It's condensed, and carries the high ABV, and that along with some substantial sugar contents sensibly limits the intake potential, but however much you see your way clear to drink, rest assured, you'll enjoy it. As long as you can remember it, that is."
"Appearance: Dark ruby chestnut almost black with a large bubbly tan head leaves uneven rings of lacing. Aroma: Deep plum notes and dark toasted grains a touch of alcohol but nothing overdone. Taste: Deep layers of plums and alcohol with a sweet grainy toasted sense to it this is an awesome brew, wasn't expecting anything spectacular I have been wowed. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied lager nice full robust tones. Drinkability: Very very drinkable not a cloying bone in it's structure, with awesome flavors you just want another bottle after it's done."
"Comments  Ah, the Eisbock. The original iced beer (no, its not the original orge beer from Eisengard). You really love it or really, really hate it. This and the EKU 28 are the only two examples of the style that I see on a regular basis here in the US. I personally enjoyed this one very much (although Im only a quarter done with it at this point). Its kind of like a fine port and does especially well as an after-dinner dessert (skip the tiramisu and pass the eis)."
"Is the smokiness really in this in the malt or emergent? Either way, that character along with the multitude of other complexly intertwined flavors give this beer nearly endless interest, though they also limit its drinkability somewhat, restricting it to mostly dessert and nightcap duties."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Best before date of 10/22/04. 9.2% ABV."
"A very warming beer ironically enough, Medium to full feel, smooth, but a little too sticky sweet. Somewhat flat after a bit of time in the glass. Barleywine like feel. A good beer to have but one that wouldn't work if you want to have a couple."
"The beer as it distances itself from the bottle pours a deep ruby color with a behemothic head, the texture creamy, the color a toothsome light tan as the head slowly fades away to nothingness, the lace forms a tight skirt to conceal the glass. Nose is a bit plum like, malt laden; sweet, crisp and refreshing, start is quite sweet, and lots of malt, top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops are delectable in their spiciness, very dry and long lasting aftertaste, and quaffable tis true, a bit of a belly warmer to boot, well worth a try."
"The moderate mouthfeel slides back a little too easy, and the warming ABV is a god-send on a bitter cold night. I was encourage to buy this beer after a recent sip of from a 7-year aged bottle that was sublime - cant wait to see where my extra bottle goes with time."
"Deep and dark brown with reddish highlights. Seems crystal clear under a bright light. Good 1/4 inch head of medium bubbled foam. Simple but thickish lace. Nice aromas, raisin bread and fig, with a burnished wood quality that reminds you of old mahogany furniture with leather upholstery. Full-bodied with low carbonation. The flavor is jam-packed with malt complexity -- ruminess and candied fruit, chocolate cake and alcoholic cinnamon-like prickiness that stand in for the non-noticeable hops. Starts like a slug of liquid fruit cake and finishes with some real mince meat pie beefiness (maybe just a bit much). A little thick and sweet, but a perfect brew for the long nights of Winter."
"Just kidding...This stuff rocks!! It takes over where the smell leaves off with the wanting of more! Huge amounts of malty richness, thick and chewy, not overbearingly so, but plentiful in its presense with great dark caramel mixing with toffee. The dark fruits are unimaginably yummy! Plum, prune, fig, and raisin, touches of banana tangyness; then there's some molasses spicyness with some nice little tid bits of smokened earth, brown sugar, chocolate, and black cherry. The sweetness is so rich and deeply dark its wonderful! The feel has one tiny flaw, I so wanted to give this the full 5 in mouthfeel but it has a thinnish start and a bit in the finish and is over a little to quick, but overall this sucker is full and thick with a incredibly creamyness and nice chewyness, some stickyness with great lingering malty chewy sweetness leaving notes of dark toffee and tangy dark fruits on the palate. Just a nudge of alcoholic warmth but barely noticeable. One awesome brew thats super yummy, creamy smooth and full of flavor! Strongly Recommended."
" This one is a big beer. It has a lot of flavor with some kicks of warming alcohol from time to time. There is a huge backbone of sweet malts accompanied by some fruit flavors. Spices are mild, but help to balance a bit. The overall flavor is a bit too sweet, but it only hurts it a little. The roastiness of the aftertaste really dragged me in. I made sure not to miss this one when I saw it again."
"This beer pours a very dark, nearly black, glass. Good head that ends up leaving lace. Smells very malty and maybe some caramel and coffee. Taste is roasted malt with a hint of coffee. Reminds me of a good Scottish ale. The alcohol is well blended for the strength."
"First of the style for me so a tough one to review. Deep cola like color with amber hues and a glow of orange. Not much in the way of head or lace. This is a big, lumbering brew that reminds me of a dobbelbock that had a shot of bourbon dropped into it. Malty and very alcoholic on the nose, and in the mouth. I picked up the same raisin, chocolate, and nuttiness that I get from the German D-bocks, yet this baby leans towards being a cross between a beer and a cognac, or other fine,smooth warming spirit. A nice drink to welcome an incoming blizzard. If you drink more than two, make sure the blizzard has canceled all the next days activities!"
"(330 ml bottle). ABV of my bottle was 9,2%, seems also to be brewed in a 7.5% version. Nearly black (= dark ruby when held to the light), good to moderate creamy tan head. Started drinking it too cold, surprisingly weak initial aroma, improves as the beer warms up - malty, but not very complex. Flavour is malty sweet with burnt notes - not nearly as cloying as EKU 28 (thank God!) but also less complex. Alcohol is well hidden. OKish mellow aftertaste. Good beer, but it doesn't exactly take my breath away."
"Cheers aplenty to jeffboo for giving me this bottle he brought over from a European sojourn!"
"Deep, deep garnet hue. Nice clarity. Good sized beige head recedes to a thin coating quickly. Frothy beige rimming laces bountifully. Big and thick aroma. Prunes and figs. Molasses and cherry. Alcohol and sweet maltiness. Great nose. Big and chewy mouthfeel. Body, full. Flavors do not compromise. Big on molasses, figs and dates. Alcohol is present, but not overbearing. Big dark fruit tones. Cherry and plum come to mind. Brown sugar mixes in with some deep maltiness. Pretty nice flavor. I like this eisbock. It is good."
"Deep tawny with a small head that fizzles out as the beer stands. No lacing is evident on the sides of the glass. Nose is an assortment of sweet malt and dark fruit. Notes of currant, molasses, sugary-sweet malt, toffee and phenolic qualities appear on the palate. While this eisbock is sweet, it's never cloying but rather complex. An herbal vinous note becomes evident on the finish, but it hardly dominates. Additional alcohol presence can be detected on the dry finish, as well. Mouthfeel is turbid, oily, smooth and overall fitting for the style. This beer possesses very little carbonation. Drinkability is strong for a brew with such strength and character. Well done."
"I am really happy to see that this beer is being brewed and available again. This bottle was tasted last night at Spuyten Duyvil in Brooklyn. Appearence: Dark, purplish brown. Smell: Malty, sweet aroma. Taste: Malty, rich, plummy flavors..also figs, caramel. Mouthfeel: is rich, full, enveloping. Drinkability: It's a wonderful, fulfilling beer, but not one that anyone is likely to want to have more than one of in an evening."
"I normally don't drink this style, but like to grab beers off the shelf that I haven't tried. This poured a lovely dark maple sugar color, with a small head that has long since faded away...happens when you've been nursing the beer for over an hour. Aroma is strongly of alcohol, with an added earthy/dirt/wood sort of note. You do taste the alcohol, I also thought it was a bit sweet and syrupy at first, but it has mellowed a bit as it warms. I hesitate to call the mouthfeel heavy...let's just say it's decidedly more than medium. Actually this is not a bad sipping beer, but at that abv, I would recommend maybe only one at a sitting. Not a bad beer, but not one I need to have again anytime soon. pat"
"This is a beauty, indeed. A thinker rather than a drinker."
"Yet another one I shared with friends. This beer was dated July 11, 1996. It has been in my fridge for years. As soon as I cracked open the cap I could smell the current fragrance with a hint of maybe dates or figs. It poured a nice almost deep ruby brown. As far as the head, there was none to be found. In this case, this did not seem to be a problem. This beer was a really nice surprise, as it has a hefty 9.6 ABV yet really smooth with no overpowering taste of alcohol to be found. It had a very nice full mouth feel with a sweetness like treacle (sort of molasses-like). Too bad I had only one. My friend commented that it reminded him of Traquair House, so we had to open on of those for comparison! Not too far off, so if you like that, you will no doubt appreciate this. This one is richer."
"The drinkibility isn't very good mostly because of the alcohol content."
"This beer came in an silver ice flake specked bottle. Little lettering refers to it being Original Bayrisch Gforns. Someone else can translate. It poured a very dark amber color that you can barely see through. It formed a light tan foamy head that left a solid wall of lace on the glass as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and for lack of a better word, dust. A heavy flavor of malt, caramel, toffee and others. A very meaty taste to it. A medium, viscous finish with sweet alcohol effect. Definately a sipping beer for cold nights. Probably why they put the snow flakes on it."
"A true sipping beer that is very thick and meant to be enjoyed as sherry or an apertif. Very malty and licorice as well as other dark fruits come out in this dark beer which is high in alcohol and very warming. It gets even more complex as it warms and it has an almost chocolate, roasty Barleywine character. As tried in Austria very fresh and very strong in a nice old bar/tavern in winter."
"532"
"Even in the aftertaste, this beer somehow managed to avoid being cloying. Thats astonishing, considering the fact that many English brewers START their best bitters with a gravity LOWER than what this beer finished with! In my book, any beer that can age or more than 6 years and still taste great, is deserving of a fine score This beer isnt exceptional, but its a treat nonetheless"
