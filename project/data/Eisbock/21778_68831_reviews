review_text
"The beer pours a brownish-red color with a tan head. The aroma is very heavy on the toffee and brown sugar/molasses notes. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of toffee and molasses notes, as well as a good bit of dark fruit such as cherries and figs. The alcohol is also quite present. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A pretty good Eisbock."
