"Aromas of all the listed spices. Don't get much vanilla in aroma, but get more of it in the taste. The flavors work well together and for an eisbock, there's no hint of boozyness whatsoever, which I prefer. Smooth and quite enjoyable. Would seek this out again next season."
"O - the various spices make this different to other strong eisbocks.   in no way sessionable, but a nice cool weather sipping beer."
"I'm glad I picked this up. Hitachino can often sit on shelves here in New Mexico but there are some gems among their brand. This is one of them."
"Certainly not an eisbock in the traditional sense, and a little more one-note and bitter than I prefer."
"Bottom line, it's strong and pretty good overall. I had higher hopes based on my first sips."

"Food match: I would recommend this brew after that big traditional Christmas dinner but before or with that traditional Christmas pudding."

"Pours out a copper orang with a thin, frothy, off-white head.  Spicing is subtle in the nose.  I get mostly citrus-related notes: the coriander and orange peel.  I also pick up a lot of caramel.  Reminds me of a winter release of a typical biere de garde.  Flavor is loads of caramel, orange, bread, honey, lightly toasted grains, with a fairly mild yeast character.  Cocoa in the finish.  Mouthfeel is silky and a bit sticky.    I really enjoyed this, and it reminds me of some French bieres de garde that are released around the holidays.  I should have saved this for Thanksgiving dinner; it would have gone perfectly with it."

"A truly unique and pretty good stronger ale, a lot to like here. Also a lot of love-it-or-hate-it spicing. Personally, I tend towards liking this ale which feels most like a Belgian saison but with notable Asian influence."

"Spiced beer or Imperial Amber? Christmas Ale with Witbier spices? What is this mess? And, why do I feel like there is no such thing as a fresh example?"
"Pours amber orange cloudy with a light layer on top of white foam. Orange nose with a wheat back. Slight sour. Some citrus taste. Label speaks of other spices, but all I get is orange. Good, not great."
""
"It's certainly spicy, but not the most balanced or relaxing brew I've ever sampled. Looks alright, with an pleasantly spicy aroma. However, the flavour is rather harsh and dry due to an excess of spicing. Not much fruitiness to speak of and the malt takes a back seat. Subdued hops - mostly pine. Body is satisfying enough. Despite its strength, the malt just doesn't stand up to the spice regime. Someone chucked a rack into the mash if you ask me. Interesting but not particularly drinkable - no need to hunt it down."
"O: quite a fantastic blend and balance of all the flavors - nothing stands out too boldly... seems to have that signature Hitachino flavor at its core... dunno how they do it, but their ales are fantastic!"
"O: Awesome! Well-balanced, unique flavor, and refreshing and smooth."

"Pours a nice orange amber color with minimal head. Smell is very sweet and fresh. Taste is pretty good. One can taste the coriander and orange peel along with faint vanilla bean and nutmeg and cinnamon. Slight spiciness at the finish and the 8% AB hits you pretty good. A very good refreshing beer. Hitachino hits the nail on the head on delivering taste on this one."

"Without saying on the label exactly what ""Commemorative Ale"" is commemorating, the ale really tries hard to capture the taste of Christmas desserts with gingersnap cookies and they do that to perfection. If this is not their intent, then they are way off target."

"D: This was a nice winter warmer with delicate and complex scent and taste. Can't be too cold or you'll miss all the subtleties. The body was great, and the finish was smooth. Well hidden alcohol too, so it was easy to drink. Would be really interesting to age, but still nice fresh. Solid brew."

"330ml bottle: 2011 version. This one pours a hazy amber color. There was almost no head on it, and what was there was off-white. This one has a really nice nose. Definitely spicy, with coriander at the top of the list. A bit peppery too. The taste very good. Peppery and coriander notes on top of a malty brew. There is a slight tartness and bitterness to the taste. Definitely some fruity notes, and very complex. A really nice brew."
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with a foamy bone head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells slightly better than it tastes in my opinion."

"Light body, the aftertaste starts with a soft sugariness, but quickly overwhelmed by a too strong spiciness."
"2010 version. Pours a amber to brown with a full, frothy and easily two finger head at pour. Cloudy in appearance - looks hearty. Head disappates over time. Not much lacing. Smell is spices and orange citrus. Strong orange gives it alcohol presence even on the nose. Taste is semi-sweet with more spice presence - vanilla and coriander. Orange peel is present and gives some burn on the back of the throat but not overpowering."
"Cheers"
"Overall very drinkable spiced beer reminiscent of a belgian."
"This beer, and the brewery, ignite an expectation of greatness that is not executed in this brew. The expectation of greatness almost is the downfall of this beer itself. If I had discovered it in a back alley, I'd want in engraved on my epitaph... it's intriguing texture, body, and mouth filling properties ... with citrus, banana, dominican republic essence, session potential, paired with balance and complexity .... yay beer. but i've seen you do better"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy caramel orange amber with a half-finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, orange, banana, holiday spicing, especially cinnamon. Festive. Flavor follows with caramel malt, orange citrus, coriander, cinnomaon clove and a hint of ginger. Well integrated. Finish somewhat thinner with residual spices, caramel and orange. Very pleasant creamy medium body. I enjoyed this take on a Belgian inspired holiday ale."

"Overall always a beer I look forward to. Have had the last few years and it continues to ease in the winter season. Great mix of german roots and new age spices."

"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow citrus hops and coriander, with a faint gingerbread like malt. In the taste, a mellow gingerbread like malt with an orange citrus hop, coriander, and some other spices to make it come alive. A slight bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry orange citrus hop in the aftertaste. Nice hops, spice, and mellow malt."
""
"Overall, a very nice beer for this style and I'll have to pick up more from this brewery."
"O: This beer was one of those that had such potential but kind of fell short. It is worth a  try but kind of unimpressive"
""
"O: Although the alcohol was well hidden from the taste, this is an interesting beer that is probably better off as one to be sipped."
"11.2 ounce bottle into tulip, bottle code of NY.11.11(presumably November 2011?). Pours hazy reddish orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big bubblegum, coriander, orange peel, banana, cinnamon, pepper, wheat, caramel, vanilla, biscuit, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas here with good strength and complexity. Taste of big banana, bubblegum, pepper, coriander, cinnamon, caramel, clove, nutmeg, orange zest, wheat, biscuit, and yeast spices. Slight spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, banana, bubblegum, pepper, orange zest, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of flavors with good complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very easy to drink for 8%; with hardly any alcohol warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a great spiced amber ale. A lot of great flavors that have nice complexity and balance."

"O- A nice surprise, I wasn't sure what I was getting into with this one and it was really good. The 9.0% ABV was equally surprising I didn't notice it at all. If you run across this one try it."
""
""
"O: Not as spicy as I was thinking it might have been - the spices are more subtle and that improves the enjoyment of this beer. Very interesting flavor profile but slightly lacking in the nose. Glad that I tried this beer which is a good example of the style."
"To be fair, I think this is probably a good, well made beer, but I just don't like it at all. It's got some spices I can't identify and I don't care because I'll never drink this beer again unless it's all I have. I have had a lot worse beers though."
"O: Kiuchi Brewery does it again. I am blown away by this ale, even 3 years after its prime. The only problem is that now my store has run out, and I doubt they will get it again. So sad!"
"The sweetness of the drink should not die so quickly. I also did not appreciate how dominating the booziness was in the finish."
""
""
"O: The spice notes are not as pronounced as I expected which is nice. Beautiful blanket of Belgian funk really takes over and I love that. Strawberry, banana and citrus notes are huge. Finishes similar to a funky Saison. Complex with no alcohol presence."
"This beer poured out as an amber color with a cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer was a little on the spicy side with some sweet malts shining through. The taste of the beer has some nice herbal flavors that I found pretty interesting. The mouthfeel was well balanced and was drinkable with a good carbonation. Overall this beer was pretty good, it's one that I would be interested revisiting."
"A sweet, aromatic brew, this is one time I'm glad Hitachino Nest comes in a small bottle. While I enjoyed this ale quite a bit, a little bit of this intense beer goes a long way."
""

"D - I'm glad I picked this up. Well balanced and highly drinkable. The high alcohol is not very noticeable. This is definitely one of the better herbed/spiced beers available."
""
"The spice mix in this beer works well, this is a bit of an odd bird, but pretty enjoyable. Would go great with dessert, or most Asian food"
"Overall an interesting and complex beer with nothing offensive but doesn’t seem worth a repeat purchase to me."
"O - bit of a unique beer. for high abv doesnt feel overly boozey but then we can be getting used to drinking 7%+ beer. worth a try"
"Not a bad brew. Mostly malty with hints of interest here and there. I had thought that maybe it had simplified and diminished a bit with age but the bottle says still good for another year, so take that however you like."
"O - This is a very strange beer...and one that I'm not sure what my opinion is. I think I'm tending towards liking this, but without a really good reason. The carbonation is distracting. There is so much going on in the flavors that I feel like this beer really doesn't know what it is trying to be...the flavors are diverse but not well integrated with each other (even after 3 yrs of age) and sometimes even clash. Why do I like this?...I don't really know - but I do like it."
"Overall: A nice brew. Not too strong, with complex flavor. Carbonation in my bottle was very high, and took away from the experience a little. I bought a couple more Kiuchi beers to try, hopefully they won't overflow with foam like this one."
"Price = $15 at the Gramercy Tavern"
"O: If you want a high-gravity hefeweizen that has full flavor, this beer is perfect for you."
"Caramel pour with lively, tight carbonation. Massively fruity aroma, redolent of ripe tropical fruit. Up front very spicy, very fruity, with some caramel malt following in the wake. A bit of bite from the alcohol. Spice is pleasant at first, but grows almost oppressive toward the end, ending on a quite forceful spiced note that is almost, but not quite, too much."
"I actually mistook this for the 2004 New Year Celebration Ale at first (my favorite of their beers, and with some age on it, maybe my favorite Belgian Strong Dark Ales...sadly missed, that one) - glad I picked it up anyway (though unhappy to be out nearly $6 for the exploding bottle). Cheers to Kiuchi, busy at the moment bottling water for quake victims - here's hoping for a full (if not speedy) recovery."
"Overall pretty good. A big flavor even though the aroma is lacking. I would like to see a bit more vigorous head and lacing. Would drink this one again."
"D: very pleasant and smooth; not too heavy; the perfect dessert drink to finish a dinner"
"D - very nice. First time to have this but it's a winner. Sad hitachino has such poor consistency."
"The beer pours a hazy orange in my glass. Whatever little amount of white foam initially crowned the beer disappeared *immediately*, very disappointing. The nose is a bit better though, vanilla comes through very prominently. The cinnamon and nutmeg come through a bit as well, with a slight, welcome citrusy aroma from the orange peel and coriander closing things out. That great vanilla note is greatly diminished in the flavor, which hurts the beer a fair bit. It had really provided the foundation for the other spices and influences to come in over the top of in the aroma, and without it there's no real support for the various flavors. The body is solidly middle of the road, appropriately in the background. The carbonation though is way over aggressive, creating a distinct, harsh, fizziness with each sip.I believe this is my third beer from Hitachino Nest, and I still haven't found one that impresses."
"D- Glad I split the bottle, not a winner."
"D- another tasty brew from kiuchi I would love to have this on xmas eve with some kind of tasty fall spiced baked good."
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, with a sticky finish. Drinkability is good, although the bombardment of spices may make it a bit overwhelming at times."
"Got this as a Christmas present & it's an instant favorite! Research says that it's brewed as a new Year beer. I want to make this a tradition!"
"D: drank decent and was a good herbal beer that reminds me of a sahti style beer. I didn't know the japanese had it in them."
"D - A rally good spiced beer with plenty to offer."
"drinkability is so so - the beer is rather pricey (little less the $5 a 12oz) the medium body with the high carbonation makes the beer very filling"
"Smooth creamy. A very good beer but very hard to place the style. Saison? Triple? Herbed/Spiced? It is not any one, but a good winter warmer nonetheless. A bit sweet and boozy for a session. Just one is plenty."
"Really good brew! My only other Japanese beer experience came from Sapporo (who is to Japan as Budweiser is to the USA, I assume). This was a welcome surprise on an impulse buy! (I liked the owl on the bottle)"
"D-- Decently hidden ABV. Listed as 8% on the bottle. Pretty easy to drink but for me too much cinnamon. Would have liked to have seen more orange paired with it. Otherwise a very solid spiced beer and one of the better ones out there that can be found on a regular basis."
"Beautiful orange color with off-white low profile head. Nose is slick and sweet smelling. Very floral with notes of pale caramel. Palate is fat but balanced by creamy carbonation. Floral and caramel flavors, a bit boozy, but a long spicy finish."
"D - This is an enjoyable interesting beer it has a good taste that pretty easy to drink worth picking up if you see it at the store"
"D: Quite quaffable but in small quantities. I would try this well balanaced ale again for certain, but not for a few months."
"Interesting beer. Sometimes this is what it's about for me - something original, difficult to categorize and stays with you for a while. First of all, yes, 5 for appearance. Hazy ochre orange with a mountainous head that started at about 3 fingers and was still 1 finger at the end of the glass. Brilliant. An eclectic aroma of orange, spice, lemon, coriander, cinnamon and a slight hint of vanilla. Alcohol is well hidden in this bad boy, noticeable but not hot or overpowering. The flavours are again an interesting orgy of witbier, strong ale and American Pale ale. Maybe it doesn't fit perfectly into any particular category according to BJCP, but who really cares. An individual."
"D- I wasn't really digging this at the start, but it got better near the end I thought."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it isn't a great beer either. I think it may have come together better with some age, but I'm not enthusiastic about it enough to bother trying."
"Appearance - cloudy orange amber. Smell - I did not pick up much aroma at all with this beer, maybe a little yeast though. Taste - spices come through strong with a solid backbone of orange maltiness. Mouth feel - not cloying and just less than a barley wine. Drinkability - Tasty full bodied brew I would think about buying another. Overall - nice beer with a lot of spice. I don't remember what I paid for it."
"This brew pours a murky copper hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves a frothy two finger head and sticky lacing everywhere,the aroma is very herbal/spicey/peppery with some orange and vanilla in there aswell,it has a nice full creamy mouthfeel with tastes of spicey orange peels,vanilla and fruitcake laced hops,overall a nice brew that once again for this brewery is different to most other breweries brews and ive gotta say i havnt had a bad brew from this brewery yet even though this brew isnt my favourite from this brewery it is still a top notch brew so if you havnt tried their brews yet and see them i recommend you do."
"D - A tasty strong spiced brew. The beer is nice for half the glass, but as it warms seems to become more alcohol influenced and the attenuation isn't there. The yeast notes of pineapple and spice seems to fit sippin' in winter"
"not the best kiuchi beer ive ever had, I would want the body and malt to both be bigger to offset the spices, worth trying but wont be looking for it again."
"D: Good winter beer, nice and spicy, would be good on a cold night."
"A pleasant, subdued, but still thoroughly flavourful holiday ale, one with strong mirror-world BSDA holiday-season tendencies. The large-ish (8% here) alcohol is well integrated, manifesting in nothing more than a particularly suitable warming, and as the last few hours of 2009 zoom by, the label's fortune cookie-esque English translation of a decidedly forward-looking upbeat New Year's saying actually hits the spot right now."
"All in all doesn't blow my skirt up though, the elements go together quite well, but it's a combination that simply doesn't pull it together, at least not over my palate. Perhaps not listed properly, this would make a decent saison, although that's still not high up on my list of preferred styles either."
"D: A good winter warmer and for that I should have read the side of the bottle. I picked this one up at Mitsuwa to go with some sushi and I can assure you the two don't mix well. However, I will admit that was my own fault for incorrectly stereotyping this beer as a Japanese beer for Japanese food."
"this was a great introduction to micro beers from Japan, I have the inside scoop on a number of new ones that should be hitting shelves in Alberta soon. I think the bottles alone will make these quite popular and the fact that the beer inside is quite good won't hurt their cause"
"Kudos to the nest for constantly trying interesting styles. No one else in Asia is doing anything like it."
"D - Interesting beer but is almost like a meal in a glass with how heavy it is mixed with aal the spice and citrus."
"D: A good, drinkable example of a spiced beer. Goes down very easy with very little trace of the 9% ABV."
"Pours a slightly hazy ruby red color with orange hues a huge, thick yellowish-beige head that last throughout, coating the glass in chunky lacing. Spicy citrus aroma with hints of cinnamon, vanilla, lemon zest and orange peel. Very carbonated but still has a creamy medium body. Light fruit notes of cherry, lemon, orange peel, with hints of vanilla spicy cinnamon and slight alcohol warmth in the finish. The ABV is very well masked."
"d: nice brew that does pack a bit of a punch at 9%, but a great brew"
"2009 Edition with vanilla beans, corriander, orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon. This beer pours a cloudy amber color with a nice head that hangs around for a while. The orange peel and corriander come through strong in the aroma, but the other spices are still there. A touch of alcohol and very little malt or hops in the smell. The flavor is all about the spices. Very spicy. The citrus components mix with the nutmeg and cinnamon to create a powerful flavor that overwhealms all other flavors. Malt and hops are hidden. The alcohol is also apparent. It has a medium mouthfeel, but the way the spices coat the mouth, it makes it seem more full. The drinkability suffers here, in my opinion. There is just too much spice and too much alcohol that isn't balanced. Interesting beer, but not one of my favorites. Oh yeah, I didn't get any of the vanilla bean."
"this really should be classified an herb/spiced beer. reviewing it as a winter warmer might bring down the score."
"commemorative ale 2009!!! i know ba calls it a winter warmer, but i'm looking at it like an herbed/spiced beer. kind of in the same vein as anchor's happy christmas merry new year beer. i mean with vanilla beans, corriander, orange peel, nutmeg and cinnamon and whatever else, how can it not be a spiced ale? whatever... burnt amber, tan head, very very good retention, but little lace. nose is vanilla right off the bat, and maple syrup, citrus, and cinnamon seem to be the other highlights. very strong, very pleasant nose. taste is a well balanced mix of everything i already mentioned, but the corriander and nutmeg come out a lot more, some sourness arises (like grapefruit sour) and there is a tiny bit of booziness to it that mixed with the carbonation produces a touch of a prickly feeling. this beer could easily be confused as representing a few different styles, and that is what is cool about it and interesting about the brewery itself. cutting edge, always pressing the limits. pricey, but a definite must for the kiuchi fan."
"picking up just to try."
"drinkability is good. good balance. really cool and interesting beer."
"Pours a cloudy darkened amber, medium sized off white head forms, drops down to a thin layer rather quick, some spots on the glass, very murky. Smell is neat, wine, citrus, vanilla and oak, caramel, some dark fruitiness and yeast, light bit of sourness, smells nice. Taste is similar, caramel, very woody, vanilla, sherry, kind of milky, alcohol, bread, oranges and a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth going down. I liked this, pretty interesting combination of flavours and aromas, not too spicy which is my usual complaint about winter warmers. Thanks Chris and Kyoko!"
"D, notes: This is the totally wrong time of the year to be drinking this beer (I drank this in August and am writing this review of notes). That being said, this is a pretty solid, well balanced brew that handles its spices very well. A nice sipping beer."
"Warming the back of the throat and palate. Medium-full body, smooth, almost creamy, rich, no hop bite at all. Get one and enjoy it. Drinks like a Belgian dubbel."
"Won't be getting this one again..."
"Have been looking for more beers from these guys. I've had alot of the others, most notably the red rice ale. So when I happened across this I had to buy a few. First thing I noticed is it's more carbonated than it should be. I feel like this beer has a smoother taste hidden behind the excess of bubbles. It's still a decent beer and has a higher than expected ABV. Worth trying, you might like it more than I did..."
"This is a pretty nice beer, though one at a sitting would be my limit."
"Drinkability is not bad...not super tasty, but pretty smooth and easy going down in spite of it's size. Not something, however, that I wish to revisit anytime soon."
"D - The drinkability suffers a little on this one from the high residual sweetness; although it hides its 9% alcohol well. The spices and sweetness seem a bit cloying at first, but I am liking it more and more towards the end of the glass. The spice character is quite complex, in the flavor at least, and the orange notes in particular are excellent."
"Excellent stuff - Definitely recommended..."
"Pours a muddy amber/red color with tons of foamy off-white head. Super long lasting retention and spotty lacing, with a yeasty sediment at the bottom of the bottle, falls nicely into the glass. Smells primarily of orange peel and spices like coriander and nutmeg. Tastes of orange peel, bread, vanilla, nutmeg and coriander. Medium in body with lots of effervescence in the carbonation. Has a nice spiciness and hides the alcohol well. An interesting beer, but not what I would expect from a winter warmer, very citrusy."
"Poured into a snifter. This commemorative ale pours a murky, orange-amber color with a ton of off-white head that drops very slowly, that leads to really nice lacing. Strong sweet malt aroma, with some citrus and spices thrown around in the nose. Sweet flavors of citrus and tropical fruit, with a slight sour/tart ginger hint. High carbonation level, with a nice clean mouthfeel, but I get that from almost every Hitachino beer that I have had. I am gld I had a chance to have it, but not quite what I expected."
"It tasted good, but was just too sweet for me. After my last sip I knew I wouldn't want any more. But, for one bottle, it was worth the try. One thing to note, it masks it's 9% abv perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised, and buzzed, to read that on the label after this one."
"D: Drinks really nice for 9.0%abv. smooth, enjoyable and festive spicing makes this a good try."
"Pours a very carbonated hazy orange/amber with a huge head that fades to a healthy cap. The smell is really nice- beautifully integrated aromas of wood, orange peel, vanilla, spice, and Belgian yeast smells of bread, clove, and spice. Very dry and no one aroma dominates. Taste is similar, but a little less subtle. Sweet orange flavors up front followed by spicy hops and a slight woodiness and then more subtle flavorsthat fall away of orange peel, vanilla, and a slightly sour graininess. Mouthfeelis a little overcarbonated early on in the beer followed by it being slightly washed out and a touch tannic. Interesting beer, but a little out of whack in the mouthfeel department."
"Sláinte"
"Definitely not one of my favorites from this brewery. It's not bad in any way. It's just not the big rich ale I was hoping for."
