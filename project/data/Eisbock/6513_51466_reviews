"Like the BrewDog's TNP before it, this has much going for it in terms of forging new vistas, yadda, yadda, yadda, and is a definite slow sipper, but suffers a bit too many side effects from all that consolidation of flavour. There appears to be good reason why the brown spirits craftsmen of the world go about it the way that they do, as opposed to this one. Interesting, in a circus side-show, gaping appreciation sort of way, if that's you and your wallet's sort of thing."

"Bottle @ home (of course not the whole bottle :-) ). The bottle looks great, the beer in the glass light brown, no head. Complex fiery-alcoholic aroma. Starts the same: incredibly strong, very alcoholic, like fire on the tongue. Goes down burning, like an earthquake, shows interesting fruity notes, like apricot. Very warming but also well balanced finish. Very prickly aftertaste. Really an incredible beer, a hot beer. Well done record!"
