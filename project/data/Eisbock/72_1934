3.92,-7.5,3,3.5,4,5,4,"11.2oz bottle into weiss glass. Cloudy mocha with a tall tan head that quickly drops to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is banana, bubblegum, clove, and alcohol. Taste is clove, alcohol, phenol, fig, banana, bready malts. Certainly malt-forward, but the sweetness is held in check by the other elements. Medium-full body, very creamy and sticky around the mouth, velvety soft carbonation, with an astringent finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 04, 2015"

The standard "Tap 6" Aventinus was already one of my favourite beers to begin with - but Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock manages to blow its (still-impressive) little brother completely out of the water. This is an incredibly well-made beer, and of the several-hundred different brews that I've reviewed on this site, it would not be a stretch to say that this is definitely one of the best of the bunch - the perfect way to celebrate 850 reviews. Great value at its Ontario price point, and an absolute must-try - I'll definitely be picking up a few more bottles, to ensure that I will be able to enjoy this stellar brew even after the local stock runs dry.","thehyperduck","Feb 25, 2015"

Has that German Hefe yeast flavor going on and finishes nice and dry but with a rich maltiness. Wonderful estery smell one would expect from a Weizen style. If you like the Weizenbock from Aventinus you will enjoy this beer. Basically an Imperial Version of that beer.

I have not had a bottle of regular Aventinus quite this young, but that beer has been amazing at all ages (just s good with 3-4 years as fresh, just wonderfully different). I think this beer will simply get better with age. However, it is quite enjoyable at this age too, but one has to be in the mood for a bit of a tussle.","allforbetterbeer","Feb 09, 2015"

3.6,-15.1,,,,,,"Malt driven, supported by yeast and banana flavor, with a lot of spicy cloves and alcohol, enwrapped by sugar. Alcohol becomes too present for my taste as the malt sweetness begins to vanish, gets supported only by sugar. Beer turns from very sweet to sharp bitter in a split-second, due to the alcohol. Carbonation is fine, supporting the body of the beer. Oily, honeyed mouthfeel. This may just be a little too extreme for my taste, I dont find many nuances in this beer, as my tongue seems to get numb by the obvious alcohol. First impression is surprisingly refreshing, medium-bodied, fruity and warm. Then my palate gets hammered by lots of sugar, followed by alcohol and alcoholic bitterness, which warms my belly. Although I dont love it, I have to admit that the beer by itself is somehow convincing. Its something you should take your time with, to adjust to the taste and furthermore the goal of the beer. As this is the first warm week of Spring in this year, I find it hard to imagine the streets around my room covered in snow. But I think thats when you should drink this, to warm yourself up. When it is very, very cold. And you don‚Äôt mind a sugar rush, followed by an alcohol overdose, because it fits to the overall situation. This is a special beer for special ocasions, you shouldn‚Äôt drink it as an every day beer. Get ready for it, and try to enjoy.","aleigator","Nov 04, 2014"

AROMA: sweet malty aromas with some esters reminiscent of dried grapes and prunes. strong vinous alcohol aroma present with a port like character and some bready-like notes. no hop aromas. APPEARANCE: deep brown color and hazy with some material in suspension. average deep ivory head with good retention. viscosity derived from alcohol with pronunced legs. TASTE: sweet malty character with some caramel and vinous notes, balanced by a strong alcohol presence that is not harsh or solventy. Low bitterness just needed to balance the residual malt sweetness. low esters giving a somewhat clean lager profile. finishes sweet. PALATE: full and velvety body, reminding a liquor. low carbonation. very present alcohol warmth. OVERALL: an extremely delicious lager with a great balance between malt and alcohol.","titvs","Sep 23, 2014"
4.5,6.1,,,,,,"Aventinus pours a gorgeous caramel-brown color with a thick, creamy head that shows great retention. The nose is full of a delicious banana-bread smell (banana and spices), there are also notes of hops and citrus.  The mouthfeel on this medium-bodied beer is quite smooth with a nice, dry finish. The taste is super balanced, picking up on the same bready, banana, peppery notes from the smell.  Great use of hops to cut through the sweet, maltyness of this beer.","kellyej","Sep 21, 2014"

T: This beer is very sweet. The noble hops are fighting a losing battle here. The finish struggles towards dryness, thankfully, otherwise this beer would be too sweet except for sipping or drinking with food. M: The body is in line with the flavor: medium to heavy. Texture is creamy and lingers just a little on the palate. Carbonation is adequate for the heavy sweetness. D: This beer was good, and I think it probably has come to define the style. Therefore, it would be hard to rate it low. It is not really my favorite style due to the intense sweetness, but it does manage to bring together two very different styles: hefeweizen and doppelbock. I guess there is some value in that.","chickenflea","May 31, 2014"

4.09,-3.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"This big hearty brew lived in the fridge for quite some time before hitting the glass ... I figured this one could handle a little aging. Bought a bottle in Edmonton and basically forgot about it for a while. Purple label and dark-looking contents recall a bottle of prune juice, which in fact jives fairly well with what this heavy hitter tastes like. A lot better and more interesting than prune juice per se but that's one element in the flavor profile. Quite an impressive tan head forms as you pour, and I was immediately struck by the color: Its lighter than expected, a reddish copper/orange darkening to brown. The rich sweet aroma included plums, fresh Concord grape juice (not present in Aventinus proper), rum, treacle, and dark bread, with the overall effect evoking port wine or cask-aged rum. Palate was one for the ages, a ton of different dark, sweet, tangy, and bitter elements that vie for one's attention. Banana and bubble gum fruit esters make their requisite appearance along with a shit ton of clove and cinnamon spice notes; I lost the former sweet fruit notes about halfway through my glass but the spice remained steadfast. Some mild acidity almost like red currants and then a huge aromatic alcohol burn like that found in many tripels warms the mouth and gathers steam over the course of the journey. Whoa. Numbing primes the palate for an onslaught of bitter and earthy yet somehow still sweet flavors that recall doughy black licorice (remember those licorice pipes with the red sprinkles on the end to simulate fire?) ... Potent raisin, prune, and sweet bread pudding flavors work well with a somewhat buttery or creamy mouthfeel that coats the entire palate. Some tobacco leaf emerges late. There was a notable quantity of brown sediment at the bottom of the glass that looked like wet cigar. Didn't sample this, sorry. All in all a pretty heady experience, one I'd certainly repeat but only as a rare treat. Freezing and concentrating the original Aventinus brings out additional earthy, bitter, herbal, and spicy components and the fruit is downplayed, with what remains of the latter moving firmly into raisin/date territory rather than banana. Should be on any dark sweet beer freak's bucket list and not particularly hard to find.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 02, 2013"

Poured in a weisse vase, the beer is a deep, dark, chestnut-highlighted brown coloring with a slight haze, no head, and a collection of carbonation bubbles settling onto the surface that you are unable to see throughout the body. Looks solid. Aromas of date and fig all over the forward nose, with a solid richness throughout. Earthy tones, with cherry highlights and a boozy kick. Flavors of roast and old world fruit sweetness on the forward tongue, with a blending of date and fig forming a solid backbone, along with some rich, roasted caramel notes. Earthy tones round everything out, and there is a definite kick of booze throughout the beer. The ABV also has a wine-like character to it. Smooth, robust body that the carbonation lightens, but you still get to enjoy chewing on. Wow! Richly sweet, earthy aftertaste with a building warmth as you go. The finish is robust, smooth, and leaves a cloying layer of caramel and fruit sweetness. Holy hell, this beer is tasty, big, and apparently ages amazingly well.","GarthDanielson","Aug 27, 2013"

Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fairly large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, fig, banana, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, wheat, clove, pepper, and light floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity notes. Taste of big raisin, fig, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, banana, molasses, dark bread, wheat, clove, pepper, and floral earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, pepper, wheat, clove, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent eisbock style. Damn nice complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for such a big beer. A very enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

This beer didn't have the greatest drinkability, it's for sure a sipper, but the flavors did do a good job at holding my attention but one bottles is just the right amount, no way I would anymore than that, it would get too sweet and boozy. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, It was very good and full of nice fruity aromas that were pretty pleasing and it had just enough wheat in it. What I liked the least about this beer was how boozy it was, I know it's !2% but the alcohol seems a little harsh to me and I think it could have hidden better. I might buy this beer again for special occasion, but I don't see my getting it again in the near future, but I would I feel like it's worth trying, I think wine lovers would really like this. All in all I wasn't really impressed with this beer, but I wasn't disappointed either, I just think that that alcohol could have been hidden a little better and that really hurt the drinkability, but the other than that the flavors and aromas were pretty nice. This is my second beer from this brewery and I for sure like the Wiezenbock the most and I would like to try more of their beers and I will be on the look out for more examples of this style. It's a nice sipper, but I wouldn't call it a favorite.","StoutHunter","Jan 26, 2013"

Some bubbles can be seen rising from the side of the glass, but not many. It appears darker than the regular Aventinus. There are aromas of banana, sweet malt, bubblegum, dark fruits, sweet malts, and some alcohol. It is all the aromas I loved in the regular Aventinus, but intensified. The taste follows the nose. The banana flavors are strongly represented from the yeast. The sweet malt provides a nice backbone for this beer. There are dark fruits in the flavor as well. The alcohol is detectable in the taste, but it blends well with this beer. It does not come across as boozy, but well balanced. The body is full with solid carbonation. The beer is smooth with a clean finish. The alcohol provides a nice warming feel. I wouldn't mind having a few of these put away for cold winter months. This is an excellent beer that held up very well despite the age.","acevenom","Jul 26, 2012"

4.45,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Served from bottle into a frosted Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock glass (proper). Poured a deep dark red-orange (almost brown) with a three finger light tan colored head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wood, spices, subtle sweet alcohol, dark fruit, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, spices, sweet alcohol, dark fruit, and wheat. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The balance on this one was truly awe-inspiring as all the components in this one blended really well together and none of them overtook the others. You would never guess this one to be 12% as it wears it so well. Definitely a must try for anyone who calls themselves a beer fan.","thagr81us","Jun 07, 2012"

Pepsi colored with a very quick massive head and just as suddenly no head. Wonderful aroma of dark fruits. Plums, raisins, grapes. Hints of chocolate. Very thick and syrupy in the mouth but in the best of ways. Just kind of coats the mouth. Wonderful tasting and the alcohol really sneaks up on you. This is probably the most malt heavy beer I've had and this hop head loves it. Roasted grains, lot's of dark fruit flavors. Hints of chocolate and bananna. Just enough sweetness to keep it balanced and a pepper spice finish. I love this beer. Highly recommended!","wcudwight","Aug 14, 2011"

The smell of the beer is a lot like the Aventinus with just a bit more booze. The taste is pretty similar too for the most part. The mouthfeel is the difference here, it's a bit on the flatter side from the cask and the aftertaste of the beer gives off a bit of a boozy heat that warms the chest. Overall I like both brews a lot, I may even like this more from a bottle. Both are great beers to try and I would like to have them again.","Knapp85","Jul 06, 2011"
4.07,-4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer is a burnt orange hue, with a small head that dissipates rapidly, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma brings bananas, dark fruits, wheat, clove, and alcohol. Quite tasty. Bananas soaked in alcohol and a rum characteristic work well together. Sweetness and alcohol are present throughout, making this bottle optimal for sharing, as I wouldn't want more than half the bottle. The beer is medium bodied with moderately low carbonation. Overall, a very good representation of the style, though I seldom drink beers of this ilk.","Huhzubendah","Jul 05, 2011"

Toasty malts in the taste, caramel, and a wallop of candy and dark fruits--raisins, cherries, bananas, figs. The fruit balanced out the inevitable spiced rum alcohol bite of this semi-distilled 12%ABV eisbock. Medium-bodied and chewy, very nice and drinkable. Definitely to be savored slowly.","Rifugium","Jun 17, 2011"

I've had this one before but never reviewed it. This smells super, and syrupy sweet. It wreaks of sweet dark malts, raisins, figs, and light yeast. The nose is even a little sweet for me. This beer is very yeasty and very heavy on the raisins. Wow is it sweet. It's hard to even rate to style when a beer is this sweet. It's borderline cloying. It drinks medium in body but the sweetness prevails above all other aspects. Does this beer taste good? Yes, but in small quantities. The alcohol content doesn't even matter to me because this is super malty (and understandably so) and super fruity. I just can't get past the sweetness. It's a nice style to try but this beer specifically just isn't for me.","aasher","Apr 28, 2011"

The aroma is strong with caramel and figs and spices. The taste starts with notes of fog and caramel and then finishes with a slight alcohol taste, but not nearly as much as you would think for a 12 point beer. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth fo the amount of alcohol. Overall a great beer... But leave it to one.","csiewert","Apr 25, 2011"

Smells vinous, with blackberries and black cherries, and gives the impression of Fruit Roll-Ups or raspberry Tootsie Rolls. It is very smooth and quite malty, with a dark, rich flavor, and only a light sweetness. Vinous and dark fruits pop up, with burnt sugar, dark caramel, noticeable wheat, mild bitterness, and just a hint of oxidation.

Taste is banana, wheat, spices (heavy on clove at first), bubblegum,...then followed by dark fruits and a little bit of chocolate. The yeasty flavors linger throughout the whole taste, as well as the alcohol. The alcohol doesn't seem to be as well balanced as was hoping for, but nonetheless, it is an amazingly delicious beer.

The nose is like a concentrated Weizenbock. Big notes of banana nut bread, with clove and cinnamon. A slight hint of bubble gum mixed with dates. It really is a classic aroma profile. Just a touch of alcohol wafts as it warms to room temperature. The flavor profile is much the same. At its root is a classic Weizenbock with squishy brown bananas, over toasted bread, clove and just a slight nutty flavor. Brown sugar and figs intertwine with just a hint of its 12%. The alcohol in this beer is masterfully hid. Something I wish American Brewers would pay more attention to. It's not big, in your face flavors that just hide the alcohol leaving it to return when the beer warms up. This beer has intermingles the alcohol letting it play off all of the other flavors and aromas, making itself into a big boozy banana nut bread. The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer.

The alcohol isn't cutting through as much as I thought, but the malt certainly is. I smell some kind of fruit dipped in alcohol. It's refreshing and pleasant. Decent amount of carbonation cuts through my pallet. Notes of sugar and dark fruit are present with an alcoholic after taste that almost reminds of of cough syrup, but in a good way. Perfect for sipping. There's more carbonation than I would like, but what can I do?

It is cloyingly sweet, but what do you expect?! Alcohol is mostly hidden but still felt a bit. There's a mixed hop bite to balance the sweetness a bit, but it doesn't do much more than take the edge off of it. Some peppery alcohol develops as it warms in my hand.

The problem is that some of the subtleties of Aventinue now have to wrestle with an almost overpowering booze note. It comes through as hot, even though this bottle is probably about 7 months old. Flavors, though, are clove, banana, rum raisin, and toasted malts. It's clean and nice, though too hot. Prickly feel, I really wish this was a bit smoother.

4.32,1.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes, based on a cask pour into my Uprising Chalice at Novare Res' Schneider event. The beer is a plain brown, opaque liquid. It has a big tan foam head. The beer is too dark to see within it, but I can see bubbles popping on the top of the head, so I imagine there is some rising carbonation. It has a toasted caramel and toffee aroma. Perhaps a better way to explain it would be to call it caramelized sugar. There are alcohol and oak notes in the nose as well. It's very appealing. This si a strong, bready beer. It has a fine wheat taste. It also has some dark fruit flavors, like plum or fig. There is also a little bit of caramel sweetness and alcohol to round things out. It has a heavy body and low levels of carbonation. There is some mouth coat, but it is not excessive. There is a good burn in the finish, as one would expect from the ABV. Overall, it feels like an intensified beer, but maybe that is because I know it is an eisbock. Considering the strength of this one, it is very drinkable. I wouldn't order too many rounds, but I could certainly enjoy a few glasses over a long period. Don't let the ABV scare you off, this is a fine beer that is worth trying.","ToasterChef","Jun 30, 2010"

The real flavor comes at the end where the sour funk and acidity hit you taste buds instead of hopps. The funk is not bad though, think of a mild lambic or farmhouse sasion. This of it this way, the beer still has balance, close to perfect balance when you concider the alcohol and sour funk flavors goin on. Mouthfeel is smooth from the natural cask.

Nose is fairly vinous, with some additional dark fruits in the background and perhaps a hint of chocolate (this seemed more prevalent in the nose). Taste consistent with nose but a little booze also comes out - not as boozy as I anticipated though. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and sparklingly effervescent with a little bit of residual heat.

The flavors echo the aroma, but grow more complex as the beer warms. Starts out showing caramel cola, figs, brandy and a light bitterness. As it warms the caramel character becomes lightly smokey, hints of brown bread, raisins, dried cherries and bitter orange come forward.

Tastes like a pumped up Aventinus but with banana present only in a sweet overripe flavor and feel at the end of the sip. Slightly past medium bodied with active carbonation, drying, with a sticky finish. Considering the alcohol this is just as drinkable as Aventinus.

Taste is rich malts, caramel again, no hops, dark fruit. Creamy texture with ample carbonation. The beer definitely gets better as it warms.

Personally, I think this beer would be a tremendous success at 9% or 10% and would still fit within the Eisbock style guidelines. As it is, it's just a little too boozy and warm.

Roasted toffee and sweetness classic for the style. The yeast is detectable and adds a variation to the sweetness. However, if you weed through the huge thick sweetness you can find a very deep, ripe fruit, dark raisins, and sugary plumb lending to the beer's sophistication.

The smell is intense and complex, with layers of sweet molasses and dark brown sugar followed by raisins and plum, hints of toffee, and maybe a touch of black currant. Taste is equally intense and offers similar flavors including, oddly, coca cola. Alcohol is forward and present but doesn't distract. Mouthfeel is influenced by the warm alcohol, but not dominated by it. Fine bubbles tickle the tongue while a medium thick consistency coats nicely. Based upon the aroma, I expected this to be a touch too sweet for real drinkability, but while it is indeed sweet it never gets cloying and if not for the somewhat scary 12 percent I would be glad to have another.

3.95,-6.8,3,3,4.5,4.5,4,"I'm a huge fan of the original Aventinus so when I first heard about this brew (back in the late 90's?) I couldn't wait to try it. I ordered some of the striped bottles back then and liked them a lot. Later, this brew finally arrived where I lived so I bought some more. I still thought it was good, but not as good as the regular Aventinus. I bought some more bottles on a few more occasions over the years, but they seemed to be hit-and-miss. (I think some of the bottles were old.) However, about a year ago, I had some of this eisbock on tap at the Brickstore in Atlanta and loved it. That restored my faith in this brew. Recently, I bought another bottle to try. I see that my bottle says 2007 on it. That made me a little nervous about it still having a fresh taste, but thankfully I'm enjoying this bottle quite a bit. It pours an unattractive, murky brown with little head. The aroma is a mix of classic weizen, but with some "stink" to it. I can't quite place my finger on what the stink is. Maybe it's just a phenolic that's a little bit out of control? Thankfully, the taste is better than the appearance and aroma. It tastes a lot like the regular Aventinus, but with more concentrations of everything. The alcohol seems to be well-hidden. Overall, I like this bottled brew, but I still think the regular Aventinus is easily superior. Hopefully, I'll get the chance to try some draft Aventinus Eisbock again in the future. It's been a little too long to remember for sure, but I think that version was better than this bottled version.","ohmybock","Jun 09, 2008"

Mild banana strong upfront tart apples and deep raisin notes galore. Mouthfeel is bubbly with carbonation coming real lively, body is medium to full texture is syrupy especially as it warms although it never comes of cloying to me.

4.15,-2.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Aventinus Eisbock pours a murky, deep woody brown that shows red/orange when held up to a light, the head starts off about one centimeter thick but falls to thin film of tiny bubbles in a short time. The smell is typical weizen yeast banana and clove but it is subtle here, there is also a fair level of bready wheat and the dominating solventy alcohol. The taste is upfront alcohol, solventy and slightly hot peppery and syrupy slick. In the taste I'm getting much more of the clove ester than the banana but that is there too along with the wheaty grain in the background, there is no mistaking that this is a real german Weizen. I don't get any bitterness at all in this it is totally overwhelmed by the malt and alcohol, but I guess that is fine for the style. Mouthfeel is very smooth warming and slightly slick the moderate carbonation keeps things from feeling too flat and heavy. Overall this is a very good beer I may have expected a bit more however, that being said I'm really not that disappointed. For a beer of it's strength this eisbock remains very drinkable, is still quite well rounded and a is definitely a classic wheat beer.","fank2788","Mar 03, 2008"

The taste is of a concentrated hefeweizen with added prune juice. Banana and clove flavors mixed with sweet dark fruits. No malt bitterness in this one. The flavors are very strong but the sweetness will be a bit cloying towards the end. The feel is moderate with soft carbonation and a slick finish.

Tastes just as complex as it smells with sweet caramel, more grapes, a certain tartness, grain, and nice alcohol heat to finish things off.

Poured with a ton of head for being 2 years old, off white and more bubbly than thick. The body was a nice shade of brown, not as dark as a porter, but clearer and less opaque than a brown ale. There were some particulates floating in the bottem too. The head stayed around for the entire drinkage, which was a rather long time as I sipped it through dinner and dessert. The smell was of various sweet malts, mostly caramelly and nothing to impressive, but still very appetizing. Tastewise I was blown away. Brown sugar and caramel mix around many lighter malts to create an intricate profile beyond my ability to decipher. The mouthfeel was almost perfect, but actually not as thickly bodied as I would have liked for the alcohol content and the flavor. The carbonation was a little heavy as well. It was a well carbonated port like brew, and it reminded me a lot of port. Very easy to drink making me want another one moments after I finished the first.

I probably should have prefaced this review by saying that regular Aventinus is one of my favourite beers of all time, so I was practically giddy about trying this one.

Globs of yeast float around. Color is a very murky brown, and slightly unappealing. Aroma includes alcohol, grapes, an unidentifiable but distinctly sour smell, apples, and dried fruit. Taste is distinctly malty, with essentially no bitterness. It's quite sweet, with vinous and vanilla notes in the forefront, along with the distinct solvent taste of alcohol, which is quite pleasant with the other flavors. The bubble gum and banana flavors I hear about are also present, but subtle and harder for me to detect. There is a distinct smokiness in this beer, not unlike a pinot noir or merlot wine. The mouthfeel is syrupy, but fairly thin compared to what I was expecting. The drinkability is very high, except, I imagine, when you get to number 3 or 4 and realize you're tanked.

A strong, sweet raisin scent poured out of the bottle with the liquid immediately. There are also notes of molasses, pepper, mint, and alcohol. The taste is syrupy-sweet, with huge maltiness. I suppose there's a bit of flavor reminiscent of wheat, but perhaps I wouldn't have said so if I didn't have a label to read. The alcohol is also quite forward.

He did say help myself to anything. The beer pours a dark mahogony almost ebony into a goblet with no head to speak of and what appears to be some solids (yeasts, protiens) which are to be expected based on how this beer is made and matured. The nose is very rich and sweet with a little alcohol detectable and a port-like fruitiness. Held up to the light the beer reveals a soft crimson color at the center of the glass surrounded by dark edges. The first sip surrounds my tounge and tastebuds in a rich velvety sugar-plum sweetness that rounds out with a very strong alcohol taste.The mouthfeel is superb - thick, full, warming, and the beer finshes smooth with a subtle hopiness and a very similar tartness to a nice strong barley wine. The second sip is much more malty and reveals the distinct wheat flavor of the weizen-bock bier that this brew began as and the many levels of fruitiness in the finish - date, fig, black cherries soaked in rum. Overall this beer is a very complex and robust example of an Eisbock, maybe owing a good amount of it's unique character to the fact that it is a weizen bock. This is truly an amazing beer.","miskatonic","Sep 29, 2006"

The alcohol gives the beer a strong ethanol smell, almost like a fortified wine, only tempered by a lot of sweetness. The taste is explosively good¬Öintense malt and wheat flavors, sugary and syrupy, lots of warming, with a n incredible artesianal bread-like quality. It¬ís like drinking alcoholic wheat-bread syrup that¬ís been laced with fruit and spice. Caramel and molasses are prominent in the flavor as well. The finish is a marathon of lingering flavors, with a liquor-like warming. It¬ís a beer that¬ís worthy of intermittently short sips, spaced between long and contemplative sips.

On the palate, the first thing to show itself is hugely sweet dates, then a flash of sour fruit comes in before a big, raw alcoholic burn takes over at the tip of the tongue and back of the throat. That alcohol burn is way too harsh and detracts from the mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer significantly. Overall, interesting effort, but it lacks balance and subtlety while displaying all the pitfalls of "extreme" beers.

The mouthfeel was a thick, syrupy maltiness that slid about and around the tongue and left lingering alcohol taste on the pallette. The beer opens up and allows you quick glimpses into its narrow and interesting complexities: brown sugar and raisons along with other flavors poke up at you. Although the abv is aparent at the finish, this beer remains still deliciously drinkable although still hindered by it.

Taste was heavenly with powdered sugar, plum, wheat, chocolate, grape....the complexities were nerely innumerable. Mouthfeel was also a plus as there was a nice hoppy character accompanying the wheat and fruit flavors, making for a melange of different tastes to pick up on. This is some pretty strong juice, so for the unseasoned beer drinker one might be enough, however I think a couple bottles of this could potentially do quite nicely for just about anybody wanting to try an exceptional beer experience.

Ditto on the flavors. Tastes like weizen concentrate (which it IS, of course). This is a real treat for anyone who loves characteristic German wheat flavors. The only area that the taste loses points in is that I feel the sweetness could be put a little more in check. Aside from that, this is pretty damned stellar. Does a great job of hiding the alcohol.

Taste is sweet for a second, then overpowered by raisiny alcohol that carries through the finish and beyond. The malt flavor is mostly dark fruit, with a hint of spice, much like a dubbel or grand cru. The mouthfeel runs even a bit thin, not syrupy as expected. Carbonation is adequate, its quite smooth, I don't really detect any grainy or chunkyness despite what I could see in the appearance.

The aroma is a combination of the typical clovey hefeweizen smells and rich, fruity malt. The aroma profile is nice, but I was expecting a little stronger from an eisbock. The taste makes me think of a dunkleweizen on steroids. An initial strong attack of weisse flavors is joined by dark fruity malts. A bite of alcohol is noted, but the 12% is still covered pretty nicely. The malt flavors become more prevalent as the beer warms up and some of the initial strength of the phenols subsides. Strong, well-layered flavors are the highlight here. The malty finish seems to last forever and caps off a great beer with a flavorful reminder of the strong taste of Aventinus' Weizen-Eisbock.

I was hoping to get over the initial flavor shock and pick up hints of something. None to be found. My tongue could simply not get over the whiskey and yeast. How could something as wonderful as Aventinus be mutated into something like this? I am told it is the same recipe, just finished off in the Eisbock manner.

A soft hop comes up to lend some presence to the finish. Lingering is a nice carmalized, almost burnt, malt. Afterwards I felt the yeast as it touched my throat.

Copper brown that is mildly cloudy and a thin head that quickly settled to a thin ring around the glass. Smells primarily of alcohol and perhaps some spice from noble hops (Saaz?). The taste is sweet alcohol and some bock character. The alcohol sting stays thoughout and after really searching beneath it, I could pick out some othe flavors. There was a hint of clove and, oddly, a hint of cocoa. Mouthfeel was medium-thick and carbonation was moderate. This bock wasn't 'bock' enough for me and the alcohol was just way too much.

The eisbock is quite alcoholic and sweeter. In mouth, wheat chunks are to be found playing around with lovely aventinus flavours, but it¬ís very heating which makes it less friendly on a sunny day. Dark ripe fruits and pancake syrup character is quite appealing, but this remains vastly inferior to the regular to me, although I prefer the lower level of carbonation in here.","Rastacouere","Nov 01, 2004"

The flavor is of Black cherry, banana and spice with a dose of yeast and a warm alcohol, along with slight chocolate in the background .

The latent carbonation was soft and steady. The aroma was mostly alcohol with some red cherries thrown in the mix. The wheat based origin of the beer was not quite evident on the nose, as there was nary a hint of banana. The taste was again quite different than the unfrozen Aventinus, with the front and center flavor being peppery spiciness. The fruitiness showed up in the form of rum raisins, licorice, and plum. There was some evidence of oxidized character in the form of tobacco juice like bitterness. The hops only provided an aromatic floral background with minimal bitterness. This beer is much closer to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, than a Weizenbock that it started as. The alcohol is more concentrated than the non frozen version and it does not hide quite as well. Very warming and spicy, but a bit harsh. As a result, the drinability takes a hit.","rajendra82","Oct 05, 2004"

Liquify it, drink it, and you'll get an idea. The mouthfeeel is luxurious, the drinkability better than it should be for such a high ABV.

Very warming. Perhaps august in Atlanta isn't the ideal time of year to drink this one. Maybe closer to Christmas this would be more appropriate. Still real good, though.

Tons of overripe banana and overripe apples along with a richness to the malt that's not present in the pre-iced version (the richness is nice, but the yeast-fruit flavors in the regular Aventinus are more refined). You feel the alcohol more than you taste it. It warms the stomach and lightens the head. If you drive to the bar alone, it's perhaps best not to combine this with the Dogwood Winter barrel-aged.

It is much thicker than Aventinus and provides much more of a kick. The presence of a higher alcohol content is definitely noticeable and takes away a bit from the experience.

Some major band-aid plastic and vitamin coating phenols flying all around a big ethanol heated alcoholic smack, with hints of some dark fruits and malty sweetness that can be sensed just before the alcohol or after a long time of off the rim sniffing. Taste is very nice and malty sweet with nice subtle complexities. A good load of fruityness both ripe and dried variants that contain some plum, raisin, and dates and there's a wonderful caramel smoothness coming into the finish lingers some; but that start is quite complex in the wheats, malts, and fruits with a pleasant mesh of everything. The midway point has a good little hop bitterness and building point which then lightly soothes out to a nice mellow finish of caramel which is very congenial and has some nice little agreeable plastic yeasty notes that never overwhelm as so does the alcohol which sits behind it all waiting to take charge upon bigger gulps and slightly burn with a spiced alcohol. Feel is pretty thick and chewy, nearly full, smooth for sure with a favorable creamyness and alcoholic edgeyness in its finish. Smooth drinking, but watch for that eye drooping alcohol, I'm sleepy...What a nice brew. Nose was a bit much on the plastic, but the flavors and ABV make up for it; head swimmingly delicious!","tavernjef","Dec 16, 2003"

Taste is heavy on fruity cloves and alcohol, though the alcohol is welcome and seems like it belongs. There is also a heavy bready malt backbone..nice. Mouthfeel is good at first with a nice chewy quality, but it turns quite syrupy in the slighly medicinal aftertaste. Drinkability suffers from this.

Smells like rich wheat, but sweeter. Tastes much like it smells, but feels thicker, yet still lively. The chunkies are still going crazy and the lacing is fantastic.

This beer could be referred to as Aventinus Weizenbock on steroids. It pours a thick ruby-tinged amber color with a creamy beige head. Chunks of yeast float in the dark, hazy liquid. Typical weizen notes are presented in the bouquet -- clove, banana, and yeast -- and are complemented by a sweet date character. Taste features more of the same, with notes of figs and a subtle hint at the strong alcohol content of 12% abv. Speaking of which, this brew masks its strength quite well. If you can find it, this is always worth drinking. If not, its predecessor, the original Aventinus, will suit just fine.","Jon","Jun 14, 2003"

Alcohol marches through the flavors with hobnail boots, heavy on the tongue and warm in the belly. Finishes with a lingering, thick bittersweetness at the back of the tongue. Sampled in a small pilsener glass, as the glass is drained down to the narrow neck, the carbonation is so vigorous the beer appears to be almost at a boil.

A sharp snap of alcohol hits the nose at first, then thankfully yields to signature Weizen esters comprised of assertive bubblegum, and ripe banana.  Mellow clove and light chocolate notes complement the esters, then mild wheat tartness round out the aroma.  Smells like a Weizenbock, albeit w/ a more pronounced alcohol heatiness.  Tastewise, dark, fruity date - like sweetness starts it off, then is ensued by a melange of clove phenol, raisiny notes and smooth wheat graininess.  Mellow chocolate persists as a constant foundation, adding additional richness.  Bittersweet, peppery alcohol is mild, but when combined with the inital dark fruitiness, a black licorice character is left.  Understated banana esters provide meager contrast to the rich malt profile.  Full in body and viscous in mouthfeel, w/ lower carbonation than their Weizenbock. Finishes with superficial Weizen wheat tartness and light bubblegum ester immediately ceded by throat coating alcohol warmth.  Wow-- this is a big brew, to say the least.  This eisbock makes no attempt to hide the alcohol character, yet manages to integrate it into the overall profile nicely. It's not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated and retains the signature Weizen esteriness.

The chocolate malt flavor is more present in this version but does not blend well with the very harsh alcohol flavor. Its like someone took a imperial stout and dumped a shot of cheap vodka in it.
