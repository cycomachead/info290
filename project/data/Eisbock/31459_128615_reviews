" Overall Impression- This is a well designed dark ice process big lager (eisbock). Very judicious selection of hops and malts along with care and control in the brewing, aging and ice process has yielded a really unique vinous-like bock. If you didn’t know what you were drinking you’d swear it was a rich fortified wine of immense gustatory sensation. I love Bock, I drink a lot of it, but it pales in comparison to this. I have had a lot of high gravity doppel bocks but this is a new experience – very much like one of the intense beers Brew Dog were experimenting with but easier drinking. If there is a drawback, it is that the alcohol is a tad evident now for some palates, but a few month/years in the cellar will certainly improve this eisbock. I will be buying a few bottles to cellar because I’m deeply curious to see what bottle aging will produce – if they last that long."
