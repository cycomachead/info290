Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, half inch, off-white head that dissipates towards the shoulders leaving a soapy slick in the center.  Nose is quite rich - vinous notes and cocoa.  Taste follows nose; however, it comes off a bit duller.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a light acidity.  Not sure that I've ever had an eisbock at this point; however, I found this beer decent but a bit lackluster.","Jwale73","Jan 12, 2015"

Taste is of very rich, sweet chocolate, chocolate powder, dark-roasted malt, dark fruit, brown bread crust, and there is a slight hop bitterness. The alcohol really shows itself here, especially as it warms down the throat. Mouthfeel is mostly medium and smooth, and Kulmbacher Eisbock finishes dry, sweet, and boozy.

Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, brown bread, cherry, raisin, prune, fig, light chocolate, and toast/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, light chocolate, and toast/yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, cherry, plum, fig, light chocolate, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent eisbock style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 27, 2014"

This heavily malty beer pulls off a ""big"" beer with little awareness that it's a big beer. The alcohol level just over 9% slips by almost unnoticed as does the fullness of the beer, due to it's complex but relaxed profile of dark fruit, caramel sweetness, and bready malt. Kulmbacher is a beer that effortlessly warms the bones on a cold winter day.","BeerFMAndy","Jan 05, 2014"

On initial taste, very cold temp attributed to med-high spikey carbonation feel in the mouth. As I let it warm to room temp, the carb dropped and viscosity became thicker. Left very little lace. Hops are absent on aroma and taste. High alcohol in taste and afterwards, left a very warming effect. I don't drink a lot of Eisbocks but this one will be worth another purchase in the future.

My experience with eisbock must be in relation to doublebock since that is what I know. This beer is excellent, clean taste and really a bud tickler, not too much of anything (like carbonation, molasses flavor or hidden spice) and all within the beer itself, no overwhelming factors. That is such a tricky thing to pull off, so many of us are ready to pounce on ""boring"" but believe me, this beer is not boring, and well worth a good try, if of course you are favoribly disposed to doublebocks. They are definitively German after all, so not for the less than bold taste buds, but if you like a nice crisp bock, on the higher alcohol level, this is a solid yes recommendation, this beer is unique and delicious.","JimTeal","Oct 31, 2012"

There are dark roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate, and the alcohol comes through in the flavor as well. It has a nice sweet flavor along with some back end bitterness. The body is light medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean and smooth. The beer is a sipper with good alcohol warmness, but it is very easy to gulp this flavorful beer.

4.23,2.4,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Even with a very gentle pour, I still got a finger of light-tan head, albeit rather briefly. The color is simply marvelous - a deep, dark-brown with NE-quality clarity and garnet highlights. The nose smelled of dried dark fruits, like raisins and prunes, along with a burnt caramel sweetness. Oh my! I saw where someone else drank one of these as the last thing that night and given some of my days and nights of late, this might be the last thing I would drink, ever, if I did it late in the evening. Danger, Will Robinson, danger! Proceed with caution. Mouthfeel was big and creamy with an initial burst of caramel sweetness and alcohol heat on the the tongue, subsiding into dried dark fruit. Finish was likewise initially hot, then giving way to a caramel sweetness that lingered well after the swallow. Whew! One at a time, please! Other than its drinkability, this was a phenomenal beer. I love when they get rid of that pesky water to make room for what really counts - alcohol! As it warmed, it also began to take on the scent and taste of dried tobacco, especially cigar tobacco. Wild! The more that I roll this around in my mouth and mull it over in my mind, I fully agree with the previous reviewer's, flipper2gv, assessment of it as a Quad-like beer.

Many doppelbocks can easily hit this ABV, so why brew an eisbock this low? It's very affordable in Germany, even by German standards. You'd get floored if you tried to session this, but I doubt anyone would.

It's much more of a straight German malt sweetness than the Aventinus banana bread treacle, though both are pleasant in their own right. I'm probably being generous on appearance.

Large sweet bread aroma, mixed in with brown sugar, dark fruits and warming alcohol. Sweet malts unsurprisingly dominate the flavour, with a strong brown bread component providing a muscular base. Plump and juicy raisins combine with dates to deal a pleasant fruitiness. The finish is warming and slightly drying. The high ABV obviously makes this beer a sipper, though it actually drinks a lot lighter than it is, in part due to the medium-light body and pillowy carbonation. A dangerous brew, then, but one with which I would happily dance again.","bobsy","Sep 09, 2009"

The aromas are much more noticeable in the bottle compared to in a glass (a snifter, even).The flavor follows the aroma in all ways- quite estery, sweet, dark fruit, all malt and no hop. I mean, you should basically know what you're getting into with a 9% iced bock. Mouth is moderate, not too viscous at all. It's good but nothing new or different really for the style.

Lots of alcohol and a little bitter hint of hop is all that I could taste, and a hint of malt. It was thick and creamy with a bitter alcohol aftertaste. I'm not to sure about this one, the high alcohol taste was nice but a little too much, there wasn't a lot of flavor but it did have a nice kick.

On the palate, the malt richness continues, and the alcohol is noticeable, but this is one of the smoothest 9% beers I've ever had.

Leaves some isolated blotches of lace. Smell is intense with caramel maltiness but never goes so far as to smell worty, which I find a good number of extremely malty beers to suffer from. I also get lots of raisins, almonds, pistachios, honey, and rustic bread. Flavor profile is totally chewy with malt, caramel, nuts, bread, dried fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. Very sweet but doesn't really ever get cloying. Ends on a rather bright and slightly acidic note. Some roastiness and mild bitterness help to dry things up in the finish. Minimal alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is just a bit sticky and is rather light in body when considering the flavor profile and level of alcohol. Lively carbonation also helps to lighten this up. So delicious and drinkable.

You are really putting your reputation on the line here."" It was my first suggestion from him and anyone in the store for that matter. I took his advice though and took a bottle of Celebrator to do a side by side tasting. The two are virtually twins I feel, with minimal characteristic differences. The Celebrator has a more roasted quality and the Kulmbacher has a sweeter edge...and also 2.5% more on the ABV.

Scents of banana, clove, prune, and date waft up out of the glass. I also get a molasses smell here too. The taste is sweet and rich, with a noticeable spicy kick at the end. Fruity sweetness (the aforementioned fruits, and some cherries as well), but also a slightly hoppy bitterness. The high alcohol is present in the taste, but does not detract too much. Strong, smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish. I'd give this beer higher marks in drinkability if it weren't so sweet up front.

The nose is large on plums for the most part with rasiny notes and a sweet zip of molasses. Wow, this is a BIG beer....The taste offers up some great complexity...semi-sweet plums off the top, again surrounded by dark molasses....some nice spice in the middle followed up by a sweet, candly-like finish with a warming alcohol trace. The initial plum notes linger nicely. Mouthfeel was somewhat creamy but headed toward a dry, slightly chalky finish. Fine drinkability, although I probably wouldn't have more than one in a sitting.

Creates a 1/2"" thick, dense tan colored head which slowly diminishes to a spotty film. Nose shows off aromas of brandy-soaked dark fruit cake, chocolate covered malt balls, caramel, molasses and dark brown sugar along with a hefty blast of alcohol. Palate is quite thick, sticky and oily with a moderate level of carbonation present to tame the candy-like sweet aromas. Taste is rich,sweet and very malty. Lots of raisin, fig, brandy, molasses, smoked maple syrup, and burnt dark caramel notes dance lively on the tongue. Again the 9.2% alcohol comes through to warm it all up and cut down any overwhelming sweetness. Finishes with nice noticeable semi-dry roasted malt aftertaste. Also love the prism design label.

There was also a bit of soy sauce when the bottle was first opened, but this quickly faded and wasn't detectable after a couple of minutes. Very sweet, a bit sugary and boozy towards the finish. Dried fruits, raisins, figs filled out the middle with soft, dark malts and a bit of licorice in the background. A light bitterness appeared near the end. Significant alcohol warmth. Lowish carbonation resulted in a fairly creamy texture. Not bad, but a little too sweet for me. Not one of my favourite eisbocks, but worth a try.","DrJay","Feb 07, 2007"

Aroma has nice dark malt, fruit, tobacco, and almost a bourbon note from the alcohol esters. Flavor is pretty complex. Starts of a bit sweet and fruity, like chocolate covered plums, then moves to a little more roasted flavors, quickly to alcohol sweetness, and then a nice bit of bittering. Alcohol flavor also lingers as it warms the esophagus. There's a good bit of just plain old malty goodness up in the front of the flavor as well. Takes a few sips to really pull it out for me. After a few sips, there seems to be a lingering sweetness, almost saccharin-like in taste. Mouthfeel is solid, carbonation a bit brisk. Drinkability is ok, but the sweetness gets a little tiring after a while. A bit more bitterness would go a long way in balancing this one out, but it's a good sipper for a cold winter evening. But for similar malt flavors, more complexity, and better balance, I'll dake a dark blegian ale over this any day.","aaronh","Aug 31, 2006"

3.8,-8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Although I have had a few Eisbocks over the past couple of years, I believe this is the first one I have reviewed. Per the Reinheitsgebot there appears to be much consistency within the parameters of the style. She pours a deep ruby red color with a tawny head that dissipates quickly. There is a surprising amount of carbonation, although hard to see, considering this is such a high gravity brew. The aroma is not necessarily complex; however, beyond the overwhelming presence of malt, there is a good representation of a fresh hoppy smells as well as some stewed fruits. The palate is defined by a somewhat syrupy start and the signature eisbock astringent finish. The flavor is sweet and intense (similar to some American barley wines) with a defined crisp, yet delayed, hop finish. A good, well balanced beer, but not one that bowled me over.","SeanChouffe","Dec 31, 2005"

Tastes of toffee and a hint of butterscotch. In many ways it resembles a doppelbock, but with a much more serious character. Later had a taste of raisins. Had a creamlike mouthfeel with light carbonation. Left a palatable alcohol aftertaste. An admirable offering, but at $13.99/6-pk, reserved for special occasions.","WTexas","Dec 28, 2005"

Aromas of dark fruits, spice and malt are well balanced. Taste is along the same lines at the smell; flavors of dark plumbs and grapes dominate, with a slightly spicy touch that renders the 9.2% ABV very well concealed. Finish is a bit malty and tart, with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich. This brew is best as a sipper, but could also be consumed similar to a dark lager.

Taste is even more complex, with a proniunced malt character throughout. Hard to capture in words; suffice it to say that this would be my last beer on my way to see my Maker.

Doughy malts hold it together but the hops are kinda missing and replaced with macerated and dried dark fruits, walnuts, and more. Taste is fiery but the booze is controlled by the sweet thick, syrupy, maple and fruit flavor of this one.

4.51,9.2,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"12 oz bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and consumed in January 2005. Hard pour necessary to get a one-finger tan head over a black liquid. To the light, it's a deep brown mohogeny color and is crystal clear. Smells of caramel chocolatey/coffee and alcohol. Oh, tastes divine! Alcohol persists gently throughout, but the malt sweet jumps in several times in several different incarnations. First caramel then subsiding, then chocolatey then subsiding, then toffee-ish. Any hopping is low. Fine carbonation rises off the flat of my tongue and forms a mild acid that cooperates with the alcohol burn. The ending is alcohol and leaves a dry malty aftertaste. Medium thick body. This beer does not sit on my tongue like syrup, which is good, because the sweet would probably be too much. Boy, the toffee & bock mix very well over the alcohol base in a way I've never had before. Also, acid from carbonation can be hell with some beer characteristics (such as sour or alcohol), but this one turns the potential downfall into an asset. This truly is a work of art...get it if you can find it.","mentor","Jan 21, 2005"

I thought it would be a little harder to swallow, due to the high alcohol content, but that prooved to be the contrary.

Finish is relatively dry, with an almost briny character. Thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. And man, does this pack a whallop. I've had about two ounces and am already starting to feel a bit drunk. That of course cuts down on the drinkability - at 9.2% it's difficult to drink an entire bottle on your own, and it's smaller than 12oz.

It's aroma is bright and alluring; almost like fresh, sweet wort in the brew kettle, and in fact, the aroma can be enjoyed in and of itself, with inotes of deeply baked oatmeal cookies, caramel, raisins, prunes, subtle chocolate, and waft of alcohol. The bold malt flavor conquors the palate with an onslaught of almost-burnt brown sugar that mellows across the palate to reveal deep caramel, toasty grains, splashes of raisin, a light slap of alcohol, a swirl of floral/herbal hops, prunes, and then lingering bitterness, black licorice candy, and a hint of coffee-like roastiness. Wow! For lovers of big, rich beers, this is a cannot-miss. A classic of the style!","NeroFiddled","Aug 11, 2004"
3.94,-4.6,4,5,4,3,3,"Brilliantly clear deep garnet hue. Head recedes into a lean, frothy layer. Rough, sparse lace remains. Suggestions of fresh, moist pipe tobacco, candied plums, and rum soaked raisinbread caress the nose. Swirling and time release gentle wafts of dark chocolate and a kiss of herbal hops. Absolutely seductive aromawise. In flavor, upfront is a toothsome mÃ©lange of unrefined brown sugar, dried dates and concentrated caramel. Sweetness is lightly offset by an undertone of deeply toasted malt, with trace roasty hints, but this brew is nearly bereft of hop bitterness. Hop flavor integrates agreeably, in its mildly floral, and slightly herbal tones. Black licorice and peppery ethanol arise mid palate to provide contrast to the pervasive sweetness. Surprisingly lightly bodied. A notch more viscosity would have bolstered the hefty malt backbone aptly. Turns lightly nutty late, with hints of carmelized almond leading into the sweet, yet thin and immaculately clean finish. A true dessert beer that envelops, but weighs heavily on the palate. Superbly crafted and really a quintessential eisbock. I'd love to taste the doppelbock from which this is derived, before it was ""eised."" Will the alcohol in this brew negate the impending sugar rush? I could run a marathon right now...","marc77","Aug 10, 2004"

4.37,5.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"6 months bottle. Big props to TAR Finely laced thin off-white head over a dark molasses brown hue. Deeply rich aroma, sweet as expected, but bearing woody and lots of smoked undertones. The great chocolatey malt is intertwined with the candyish toffee. Subdued hop profile complements the malt fest with dignity. In one word, the aroma is effective. A first sip reveals its awe-inspiring complexity. This is rich and decadent, smoky with superb chocolate flavors. Understated fruitiness, maple and mildly bitter tobacco finish. Medium to full bodied with appropriate carbonation, rather restrained not to disturb and to let the malt expands as it deserves to. Wonderful and extremely contemplative lager, not unlike celebrator.","Rastacouere","May 12, 2004"
4.47,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black with brownish hues and a nice head that fades quickly leaving a fizzy tan ring. Carbonation is present and the smell is of dark roasted malts and bit of cherry. Very aromatic. The taste is crisp but the esters of this beer swirl around the tongue and leave a delicious aftertaste. Very fruity and suprisingly strong. There is a bit of alcohol that warms the stomach but this is a very nice brew. Sweet fruits of cherry and plum come to mind with bits of spices to make your tastebuds cry out for more. This is an overall pleasing beer that I wouldn't mind enjoying anyday of the week.","stewart124","May 03, 2004"

The taste is smooth, thick, and creamy. Lightly sweet and very well integrated. The alcohol is well hidden as well. Damn this beer is a malty wonderland, only a hint of hop bitterness. The malt certainly plays center stage here, as it should in a bock. This is so smooth, no harsh notes to take away from the thick malt flavors, this beer is ripe with melanoids, and notes of raisins too. Just a great beer that demonstrates the characteristic bock flavors wonderfully.","Gueuzedude","Apr 01, 2004"

4.08,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Yes, I love hops, and crave them at times, but malt sure has its place too. The flavor is so clear and crisp that it presents itself distinctly and concisely. Put it in a milkshake and you'd have an old fashioned malted, I swear. It's condensed, and carries the high ABV, and that along with some substantial sugar contents sensibly limits the intake potential, but however much you see your way clear to drink, rest assured, you'll enjoy it.

This and the EKU 28 are the only two examples of the style that I see on a regular basis here in the US. I personally enjoyed this one very much (although IÂ’m only a quarter done with it at this point). ItÂ’s kind of like a fine port and does especially well as an after-dinner dessert (skip the tiramisu and pass the eis).","RoyalT","Feb 27, 2004"

4.32,4.6,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"Deep and dark brown with reddish highlights. Seems crystal clear under a bright light. Good 1/4 inch head of medium bubbled foam. Simple but thickish lace. Nice aromas, raisin bread and fig, with a burnished wood quality that reminds you of old mahogany furniture with leather upholstery. Full-bodied with low carbonation. The flavor is jam-packed with malt complexity -- ruminess and candied fruit, chocolate cake and alcoholic cinnamon-like prickiness that stand in for the non-noticeable hops. Starts like a slug of liquid fruit cake and finishes with some real mince meat pie beefiness (maybe just a bit much). A little thick and sweet, but a perfect brew for the long nights of Winter.","ADR","Jan 04, 2004"
4.89,18.4,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Just kidding...This stuff rocks!! It takes over where the smell leaves off with the wanting of more! Huge amounts of malty richness, thick and chewy, not overbearingly so, but plentiful in its presense with great dark caramel mixing with toffee. The dark fruits are unimaginably yummy! Plum, prune, fig, and raisin, touches of banana tangyness; then there's some molasses spicyness with some nice little tid bits of smokened earth, brown sugar, chocolate, and black cherry. The sweetness is so rich and deeply dark its wonderful! The feel has one tiny flaw, I so wanted to give this the full 5 in mouthfeel but it has a thinnish start and a bit in the finish and is over a little to quick, but overall this sucker is full and thick with a incredibly creamyness and nice chewyness, some stickyness with great lingering malty chewy sweetness leaving notes of dark toffee and tangy dark fruits on the palate. Just a nudge of alcoholic warmth but barely noticeable. One awesome brew thats super yummy, creamy smooth and full of flavor! Strongly Recommended.","tavernjef","Dec 20, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4," This one is a big beer. It has a lot of flavor with some kicks of warming alcohol from time to time. There is a huge backbone of sweet malts accompanied by some fruit flavors. Spices are mild, but help to balance a bit. The overall flavor is a bit too sweet, but it only hurts it a little. The roastiness of the aftertaste really dragged me in. I made sure not to miss this one when I saw it again.","ElGuapo","Dec 20, 2003"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a very dark, nearly black, glass. Good head that ends up leaving lace. Smells very malty and maybe some caramel and coffee.

3.9,-5.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"First of the style for me so a tough one to review. Deep cola like color with amber hues and a glow of orange. Not much in the way of head or lace. This is a big, lumbering brew that reminds me of a dobbelbock that had a shot of bourbon dropped into it. Malty and very alcoholic on the nose, and in the mouth. I picked up the same raisin, chocolate, and nuttiness that I get from the German D-bocks, yet this baby leans towards being a cross between a beer and a cognac, or other fine,smooth warming spirit. A nice drink to welcome an incoming blizzard. If you drink more than two, make sure the blizzard has canceled all the next days activities!","moulefrite","Nov 29, 2003"
3.78,-8.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"(330 ml bottle). ABV of my bottle was 9,2%, seems also to be brewed in a 7.5% version. Nearly black (= dark ruby when held to the light), good to moderate creamy tan head. Started drinking it too cold, surprisingly weak initial aroma, improves as the beer warms up - malty, but not very complex. Flavour is malty sweet with burnt notes - not nearly as cloying as EKU 28 (thank God!) but also less complex. Alcohol is well hidden. OKish mellow aftertaste. Good beer, but it doesn't exactly take my breath away.","Sigmund","Nov 23, 2003"

Notes of currant, molasses, sugary-sweet malt, toffee and phenolic qualities appear on the palate. While this eisbock is sweet, it's never cloying but rather complex. An herbal vinous note becomes evident on the finish, but it hardly dominates. Additional alcohol presence can be detected on the dry finish, as well. Mouthfeel is turbid, oily, smooth and overall fitting for the style. This beer possesses very little carbonation. Drinkability is strong for a brew with such strength and character.

This poured a lovely dark maple sugar color, with a small head that has long since faded away...happens when you've been nursing the beer for over an hour. Aroma is strongly of alcohol, with an added earthy/dirt/wood sort of note. You do taste the alcohol, I also thought it was a bit sweet and syrupy at first, but it has mellowed a bit as it warms. I hesitate to call the mouthfeel heavy...let's just say it's decidedly more than medium. Actually this is not a bad sipping beer, but at that abv, I would recommend maybe only one at a sitting.

As soon as I cracked open the cap I could smell the current fragrance with a hint of maybe dates or figs. It poured a nice almost deep ruby brown. As far as the head, there was none to be found. In this case, this did not seem to be a problem. This beer was a really nice surprise, as it has a hefty 9.6 ABV yet really smooth with no overpowering taste of alcohol to be found. It had a very nice full mouth feel with a sweetness like treacle (sort of molasses-like). Too bad I had only one. My friend commented that it reminded him of Traquair House, so we had to open on of those for comparison! Not too far off, so if you like that, you will no doubt appreciate this.
