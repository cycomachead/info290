"Overall a very nice sipping beer, that becomes even better as it warms up."

"D - A solid Eisbock that's lower in alcohol than I expected. If you're in Europe and you dig this sort of style this might be worth seeking out, but it's not something for which you should set up an international trade. That being said, I was sad we didn't have more of it to share."
"nice and dark amber with a slight mocha head... nose of apple pie and straw with a nice hint of chocolate. this is carried over into the palate nicely with a unnoticeable abv and a nice american brown ale malting character but with a completely mellowed lager feel and a nice ester quality that didn't come out syrupy but almost velvety. some coconut hints... a very easy drink."
"A really nice beer and different from what I expected. I would not be surprised if they changed the recipe as I got none of the sweetness that is in reviews from last year and before."
"OVERALL: I can certainly see why this one wins awards quite regularly. A great strong bock that would be perfect for the winter months. I think the palate could be beefed up a little, but other than that, this is a world class brew in the style. I'm glad I found one of these all the way into June. Will try to get some more for the winter months next bock season. Recommended."
"Pleasantly hoppy and surprisingly dry, rather Belgian in character but with more of an emphasis on hops than on yeast. Autumn leaves, tobacco, grape must, and clove provide an earthy foundation to bright, vaguely tropical, heavily floral and citric bursts of hop bitterness. Some sassafras and chicory sound off as well. Almost refreshing but also a bit funky - probably a good cheese beer."
"Overall: Great beer. This is much more than just a bock."
"Overall: What a beer, very nice, perfectly in balance. A real treat."
"What an absolutely phenomenal beer. I just happen to see a single bottle of this sitting on the shelf of my local liquor store and thought ""what the hell"". I'm glad I did."
"-Probably the best dutch beer I have tasted, and can easily hold its own against the top of the belgian range. Overheard an other American at the bar describe this beer as ""mind blowing"" and I can't say he was too far off with the description."
"Taste is malty with chocolate(malt) and coffee notes. A medium maltbitterness of the roasted malts adds a nice depth to the beer. Together with the probably bottom fermented yeast it gives this typical German touch to the beer. Mouthfeel is dry and lingering maltbitter. The alcohol is warming. A beer for cold winternights."
"Moderately full mothfeel, but enough carbonation on the tongue and bitterness to keep it from being cloying. All in all a nice winter warmer indeed!"
"Nice lightbrown head staying well and a dark brown beercolor. Nose is great combination of sweet caramellic malts and yeasty (blackcherrie/berry)fruitesters. Furter giving almond and a hint of sourness all together very fine. Taste is full caramalty also but also giving chocolateroast, moderate sweetness before going into nice bitterness. Alcohol well hidden and a very good balanced brew alltogether. Good carbonisation makes mouthfeel good and very good drinkability for a winterwarmer, maybe even litle too easy."
