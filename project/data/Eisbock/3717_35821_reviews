"Overall: Unlike any eisbock I've previously encountered, in that it's totally lacking all the rich, complex maltiness and potent, pleasing flavors one would expect and hope for. If this is the concentrated, post-freezing results, I'd be curious to see what the heck they started with."
"O/D - Not too shabby. Not overwhelmingly good but good enough to keep your attention."
"D- Very sweet and slick with a booze burn makes this delicious beer a sipper."
"D - Pretty good stuff, not great. The well-hidden ABV is commendable."
"A rich colour, with a strong reddish hue. Very little carbonation. Taste is non aggresive and pleasant, with a bit of a sweet overtone, and some caramel notes. Not too complicated, but a pleasant experience overall. Goes down quite easily (in part because of the low carbonation)."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. fairly interesting, but doesn't quite have the depth and complexity i usually expect in an eisbock."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, lightly oily feeling, medium carbonation, some alcohol burn going down. Overall not bad but pretty plain."
"Pours a mahogany colour with a tick tan head, but quickly dissipates without too much lacing. Smells of raisins and caramel. The taste is a bit subdued of raisins, brown sugar, and spices. A little bit thin in the body, but still quite smooth. Very drinkable and nice, but not outstanding. I barely notice any alcohol."
"An interesting high-octane brew, definitely more suited for a cold winter's night."
"For a 9.5 ABV it is surprisingly drinkable, and a good first introduction for me to the Eisbock style."
"Not sure this is my type of beer. Too much alcohol, IMO. To sip..."
" This is an eminently drinkable beer regardless of style or ABV, but for an eisbock that approaches 10%, it doesn't get much more drinkable than this. In fact, drinkability is where this beer truly excels."
"This is a seriously vinous Eisbock (not sure how long it was cellared). The shows almost Belgian notes in the finish with some chocolate ( like bakers chocolate) in the midbody. A very refined and large eisbock with almost no sweetness left in the beer. A great beer from Quebec."
"They have changed the label on this. Told to serve at 50 degrees plus (what happened to Celsius?). Pours a dark thicker looking brown. above average mouthfeel, above average carbonation and in the taste, good chocolate and malting . The alcohol is there though not extreme. Some raisin, anise is good. Though I got this fresh from Metro Joanette, it has a few months bottling on it and sweetness is not too much. Refreshing and satisfying."
"New label and name, but same beer. Pours a deep mahogany colour showing lots of ruby when held up to the light. What head there is dies within a couple of minutes, and the liquid looks still and heavy. Strong treacle and caramel aromas assault the senses. Sweet brown sugar and dark fruits dance a sublime waltz of flavour in this well crafted eisbock. Heavy feel of liquid caramel, and little carbonation make this hearty drinking, and despite the ABV the alcohol is MIA. Nice!"
"Overall, I enjoyed this one more than I expected but I doubt I'll go for it again. An end of evening, after-ski type of beer."
"D: one is enough, strong but still drinkable,"
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color bock with a huge foamy head with good retention but no lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with too much sugar for my own taste. Taste is dominated by cardboard notes (oxidized) with some over the top sweet. I could also detect some dry fruits notes which I am sure would have been great had they not been dominated by the cardboard and the sweetness."
"It's a very good beer. Too bad there isn't a little more protein for a stand-up head."
"D- Very smooth and easy to take considering ABV. A nice strong beer to turn to on a cool day."
"Pleasant."
"As eisbocks go this is very drinkable..not overly complex but has a character like a very mellow malty tripple bock with just enough herbal hopping to offset the big malts and keep sweetness out of the mix. 2 thumbs up!"
"Thanks to Beersignal for the sample!"
