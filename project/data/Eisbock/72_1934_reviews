"O: not clear at all and highly carbonated - both odd for the style; flavor and aroma were tremendous;"

""

"Overall: One of the best beer I have had in a while, and I was surprised when I first taste it by how excellent it is. Will surely have it again."
""

"Bottle shared with a friend. Dark brown color with a creamy off-white head. Loads of banana in the aroma with some cola, chocolate, and alcohol mixed in. Very complex. Huge malt presence and very sweet, but not cloying. Full bodied, strong, smooth and warming. Not an everyday drinker, but a nice treat from time to time."
"F- Smooth"

"O: this is a pretty good beer I'm not sure it is amazing but it has some great kick to it."

"-One of the best beers i have had i will remember this for time to come and drink many more"

"O: This is the daddy. I'll never forget the day I tried the original Schneider Weisse for the first time. I've been lucky enough to sample their product fresh in Munich consistently over the past two years. Sadly their bottled product does not compare to drinking the real thing fresh, however this is a true advertisement of what this special brewery is capable of. A true magnum opus - herzlichen glückwunsch, Schneider."
"wow, so complex and layered.  big dark fruit, almost grapy or vinous.  hint of clove and pepper and lot of sweet bready notes"
""

"Overall: Make no mistake, this is a heavy hitter - it's more deserving of an octane rating than an ABV. That said, if you're prepared to spend the time sipping and appreciating the multitude of flavours on offer then it's a very rewarding beer. Drinking more than a couple in one session probably isn't a good idea unless industrial-strength hangovers are your thing (don't ask ...!)"
"11.2oz bottle into weiss glass. Cloudy mocha with a tall tan head that quickly drops to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is banana, bubblegum, clove, and alcohol. Taste is clove, alcohol, phenol, fig, banana, bready malts. Certainly malt-forward, but the sweetness is held in check by the other elements. Medium-full body, very creamy and sticky around the mouth, velvety soft carbonation, with an astringent finish."

"Earthy fig/date aroma and flavor they lingers a good 10 seconds.   Delish!"
"Final Grade: 4.76, a mind-boggling A+. The standard ""Tap 6"" Aventinus was already one of my favourite beers to begin with - but Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock manages to blow its (still-impressive) little brother completely out of the water. This is an incredibly well-made beer, and of the several-hundred different brews that I've reviewed on this site, it would not be a stretch to say that this is definitely one of the best of the bunch - the perfect way to celebrate 850 reviews. Great value at its Ontario price point, and an absolute must-try - I'll definitely be picking up a few more bottles, to ensure that I will be able to enjoy this stellar brew even after the local stock runs dry."
""
""
"Overall:  this reminds very much of good Trappist, along the line of Rochefort 10 and Chimay Grand Reserve, although a bit more sweeter.  A nice beer to sip on during winter times."
"Color is a dark redish brown with a one finger head that dissipates quickly. Nose is ripe Asian pear. Feel is very rich. Taste is a little boozy, touch of sweetness, and then a big malty finish. An outstanding beer. Pour slowly to minimize sediment in your glass."
"Bottle of Schneider eisbock drank"
"Only beer that I have ever consumer whilst slaying a dragon....See you in hell."
"Great beer. You can tell this is a big beer but is a very easy drinker at 12%. Has that German Hefe yeast flavor going on and finishes nice and dry but with a rich maltiness. Wonderful estery smell one would expect from a Weizen style. If you like the Weizenbock from Aventinus you will enjoy this beer. Basically an Imperial Version of that beer. I plan to snag more of these and enjoy in these winter months."
""
""
"I'll defiantly buy this beer again."
""
""
""
"To me this is the perfect beer. Dark, malty, and high in alcohol without being too boozy. Perfect."
""
""
""
"Conclusion: This is one of the very rare beers that I think will actually get way better with age. I have not had a bottle of regular Aventinus quite this young, but that beer has been amazing at all ages (just s good with 3-4 years as fresh, just wonderfully different). I think this beer will simply get better with age. However, it is quite enjoyable at this age too, but one has to be in the mood for a bit of a tussle."
"O-A very big beer and one that I enjoyed more with each sip. There is a lot going on and the alcohol is obvious, but if you know what to expect, this beer ticks all the boxes. My only knock would be the soy flavor that felt somewhat odd and out of place."
""
"O: Great sipper for a cold evening (or morning)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a almost black clour, with a big off white head. Good retention. Smell of dried fruits, spices, vanilla, clove, banana, lemon, alcohol.  Medium body, one expect some more. Taste of prunes, figs, whisky, coffee, banana, spices. This is a hell of a beer, complex, rich and one that I sure will buy more."
""
"o: ultra sweet and indulgent beer, if you're into that kinda thing.  it's great, but i won't be seeking this out again in the near future"
""
""
"It just didn't work for me.  I've had others by Schneider and enjoyed them, but didn't care for the Eisbock."
""
""
"Overall, this is a well-balanced, acutely flavored, winter beer."
""
"Incredible taste and surprisingly light"
"This tastes like liquefied cinnamon-spice banana bread with raisins. Just a mild warming sensation from the 12% ABV. Very good."
""
""
"O: Certainly one of the best eisbocks out there, if not the best. It might not technically ("
""
"Overall merely an okay beer."
""
""
"Heading back to my local to pick up a couple more to cellar."
""
""
""
"Dark brown / amber with insanely large coffee tinged head. Smells heavy, if that's a thing.  Alcohol stands out, with cherry and fig. Malty, syrupy, chewy mouthfeel affects the taste.  Sweet.  Hints of honey, butter, treacle, bubble gum.  Alcohol burn on the back end.  Didn't notice the hops at all.  Interesting.  Definitely has more of a candy thing going on than most beers."

"Poured into a tulip glass, dark brown, kinda murky, looks a lot like a cola. One finger head that faded quickly to nothing, no lacing. Aroma is somewhat wine-like, with some molasses, dark fruit, and sweet malt notes. The flavor is dried plums, figs, and some nice tart flavors. It has some qualities of a good quad, but with a lot more carbonation. The mouthfeel was thinner than I expected, but very nice on the palate. Overall, this is an outstanding beer, awesome in all respects- even my wife gives it the seal of approval!"
""
"Glass- Chimay branded chalice"
""
"Eisbock is one beautiful winter beer! Beer lovers will find this worth the buy hands down, but is also very approachable for everyday Joe seeking something new and warming for the cold winter evenings. Thumbs up!"
"Drank this with five years on it. Very complex, intense combination of flavors. Truly one of a kind."
""
""
"O – This was one of the, if not THE, best aroma experiences I’ve had with a beer.  The sweetness is a bit cloying but I do like the alcohol warmth.  Unfortunately the flavor does not equal the aroma."
""
""
"First off, I was very excited to try this and I love big malt beers and Barleywines. However, something about this did not sit with me well. The sweetness was cloying. The mouthfeel was too syrupy when I usually enjoy that from a Barleywine. There was a licorice/anise thing which I don't like. I also think maybe the yeast strain threw me off, because I usually love beers this big, but do tend to stay away from a lot German and styles because of the yeast funkiness. Just means I have to keep trying stuff til I figure it out."
"Pours a very hazy dark brown.  Creamy head never really goes away. Aroma and flavor is of dark fruit and a bit of alcohol.  Definitely more of a sipping beer."
""
"Great taste. Extra bite in the end. Awesome taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy mouthfeel with an overarching yet unusually pleasant note of prune. Luscious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - A likable dark beer. Not overly boozy.  Goes down nice."
""
""
""
""
"O:  the most quad-like beer I've tried that wasn't a quad.  and while it has some licorice notes (which I HATE), it's got so, so much more ... great wine/grape notes, plenty of fruit and not just dark fruit but lots of that, too, and while the alcohol is burning my throat, the flavors are so intense that I can't taste liquor.  fantastic brew and a style I definitely will revisit."
""
""
"O: Granted, this is my first experience with the style, but I feel like it was pretty much a decent quad with more faults. The already dull flavors of raisins and prunes with an added ethanol note? Not to mention the bubble gum, which I have never found appropriate in any style. I'm all for experimentation and innovation, which this style has in spades, and I did enjoy this beer on the whole, but I respectfully won't be returning."

"Overall: A big, bold, badass bock from Bavaria. (I don't know if this beer is really from the Bavaria part of Germany but I was on alliteration roll there.) Enjoy it slowly!"
""
""
""
"Why don't Eisbocks get more buzz? They give plenty. They're tasty. This style can hang with the old ales and the barleywines of the world. I'd love to see more of these from American brewers."
""
"Overall - a truly new experience, a sipper of the utmost quality given the huge ABV in this beer. Deliciously like a more intense aventinus, I only actually wish the flavor stuck around a bit longer and was even more intense. Still a world class beer and a phenomenal sipper for a quiet night with a book with the snow continues to pile outside,"

"O-liked sipping this a lot, great mix of flavors"
""
"Malt driven, supported by yeast and banana flavor, with a lot of spicy cloves and alcohol, enwrapped by sugar. Alcohol becomes too present for my taste as the malt sweetness begins to vanish, gets supported only by sugar. Beer turns from very sweet to sharp bitter in a split-second, due to the alcohol. Carbonation is fine, supporting the body of the beer. Oily, honeyed mouthfeel. This may just be a little too extreme for my taste, I dont find many nuances in this beer, as my tongue seems to get numb by the obvious alcohol. First impression is surprisingly refreshing, medium-bodied, fruity and warm. Then my palate gets hammered by lots of sugar, followed by alcohol and alcoholic bitterness, which warms my belly. Although I dont love it, I have to admit that the beer by itself is somehow convincing. Its something you should take your time with, to adjust to the taste and furthermore the goal of the beer. As this is the first warm week of Spring in this year, I find it hard to imagine the streets around my room covered in snow. But I think thats when you should drink this, to warm yourself up. When it is very, very cold. And you don’t mind a sugar rush, followed by an alcohol overdose, because it fits to the overall situation. This is a special beer for special ocasions, you shouldn’t drink it as an every day beer. Get ready for it, and try to enjoy."

"This is an enigmatic beer. It has a classic Doppelbock aroma, but carries it in a huge ABV format that, realistically, is impressively integrated. It's a very good beer, but I don't know that such a potent variation is really needed to carry the flavor any better than it already is in their regular Weizen-Doppelbock."

"O: This is one of my favorite beers brewed, ever, if not my absolute favorite. And yes, I've had BCBS, Ola Dubh Special Reserve 30, St Bernardus Abt 12, Espresso Aged Yeti, Celebrator...I would order this over any of those."

""
""
""
""
"O: This is a big time brew and a delicious one at that."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The only thing that prevented me from giving this magnificent beer a perfect 5 rating was its lack of a frothy head and lacing. I know the high alcohol content killed the chances of this brew having any kind of a pillowy, frothy head but for a sticky beer you would imagine it leaving crazy lacing all over the glass. I've tried American style eisbocks as well as other German eisbocks but none compares to this one. This has got to be the king of eisbocks!"

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 5D). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 2927260214. AROMA: sweet malty aromas with some esters reminiscent of dried grapes and prunes. strong vinous alcohol aroma present with a port like character and some bready-like notes. no hop aromas. APPEARANCE: deep brown color and hazy with some material in suspension. average deep ivory head with good retention. viscosity derived from alcohol with pronunced legs. TASTE: sweet malty character with some caramel and vinous notes, balanced by a strong alcohol presence that is not harsh or solventy. Low bitterness just needed to balance the residual malt sweetness. low esters giving a somewhat clean lager profile. finishes sweet. PALATE: full and velvety body, reminding a liquor. low carbonation. very present alcohol warmth. OVERALL: an extremely delicious lager with a great balance between malt and alcohol."
"Aventinus pours a gorgeous caramel-brown color with a thick, creamy head that shows great retention. The nose is full of a delicious banana-bread smell (banana and spices), there are also notes of hops and citrus.  The mouthfeel on this medium-bodied beer is quite smooth with a nice, dry finish. The taste is super balanced, picking up on the same bready, banana, peppery notes from the smell.  Great use of hops to cut through the sweet, maltyness of this beer."

"Pours a light murky brown. Flavor is rich without being too sweet. Figs and dates are prominent. Went really well with the pepper steaks i had."
""
""

"Sweet and subtle at 12% ABV. This one's nice amber color finishes with currant, grape, and a hint of smokey flavor. One of my favorite new finds."

"Great taste, fruity sweetness mid palate with a spicy finish"
""
""
"In my humble opinion, this is the most sublime beer ever made! It is truly (for my palate, anyway), ""The Nectar Of The Gods," and I am certain they serve this in Valhalla!"
""
""
""
""
"One hell of an interesting beer. I keep buying it and I'm surprised at how delicious it is every time! I've never tasted another craft like it. Sweet chocolate and raisins with a spicy finish. If you like Belgian Darks, get your hands on a bottle of this. Pour, partake, and drink like a Sir.     Enjoy!"

"O: I am excited to try this beer when the weather turns cold. Still a nice change of pace for the summer, and a very drinkable brew despite its high abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A bit too hot for me but a tasty malt bomb. 3.75"
""
""
""
""
"O: clearly a top-of-the-line ale, although you need to want that sweet, fruity, boozy drinking experience. My first eisbock, I liken it to a quad or a wheatwine - rich and deep, totally enjoyable, but not something I'd reach for casually."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: My first Eisbock and this was a treat. Reminded me of a big boozy quad. Glad I got a classic of the style to establish a benchmark."

"A huge beer that drinks big but has some important key characteristics. The mouthfeel is so extremely smooth and creamy that it could probably support a 20% AVB, unreal MF in this one. There is nothing harsh in the beer or overdone, it finds a nice balance of sweetness, alcohol and huge flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is super intense. It pours a murky brown colour with very little head. Not all that appetizing. However, the smell is really pleasant, completely overloaded with spices. The first whiff really hits you. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste, but not nearly as much as yo might expect from a 12% beer. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel. Not a session beer, but good for once in a while!"
""
""
""

"Overall: This beer is very good for its style. It is not my favorite style, but it is wonderful with grilled pork and chocolate."

"O - My first eisbock. More fruity than the American double bocks I have tried. A good summer beer, even with the 12% abv. Highly recommended for those who like eatery Belgian beers."
""
""
"A: The pour is a dark caramel color with plenty of hazy reddish highlights. A tall creamy off-white head sits on top. S: The smell is clove, banana and raisin and yeast. T: This beer is very sweet. The noble hops are fighting a losing battle here. The finish struggles towards dryness, thankfully, otherwise this beer would be too sweet except for sipping or drinking with food. M: The body is in line with the flavor: medium to heavy. Texture is creamy and lingers just a little on the palate. Carbonation is adequate for the heavy sweetness. D: This beer was good, and I think it probably has come to define the style. Therefore, it would be hard to rate it low. It is not really my favorite style due to the intense sweetness, but it does manage to bring together two very different styles: hefeweizen and doppelbock. I guess there is some value in that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A big, sweet, malty, and strong beer. As mentioned, like a big aged barleywine with no hops left. What was most appealing to me was the persistent head and creamy mouthfeel. Too sweet and hot overall though. Still, I can see holding back a few of these for an extra cold night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic brew, you only have hints of its potency. I wasn't quite expecting it to be like this, but I'm glad I picked it up."
""
""
"Had in Munich in a Weiss Haus...literally a perfect beer, if you like that sort of thing. Very dark, far mire so than the doppelbocks, and stronger than the many ""ators"" available (Celebrator, Optimator, Triumphator, etc.) due to extremely cold fermentation, I was told. Sweet but still distinctly German, unlike the wine-like sweet geueze of France or the barleywine old brown ale of England. Powerful, so beware."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is so smooth. A touch medicinal."
"Overall - Delicious beer - excellent mouthfeel, taste unlike anything experience before. Worth $4.50 a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Good to really good. A truthful representation of the style but some aspects of the flavor profile don't work for me. Too much clove is more of a problem than the booze. Still, a must try."
""
"Overall - big, tasty brew that doesn't disappoint!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Do yourself a favor and let this warm. It begins with a strongly prickling carbonation that, when it eases off, levels out into just about the smoothest drinking experience I've ever had. Crispness still adds liveliness but is perfectly even, but the richness, robustness and absolute silky smoothness of this beer is impressive. That the alcohol doesn't add massive heat, it's not overly cloying, and it doesn't display any one of dozens of flaws a beer like this could is testimony of brewing genius."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The ""eis"" (ice) part of Eisbock definitely adds potency to an already flavorful brew by concentrating the flavors and ethanol. A special occasion brew, to be consumed without food -- and with a friend -- to maximize the experience. This is really good!"
"O: Being a fan of the original Aventinus, I thought I would find this more appealing. This is the first example of the 'Eisbock' style I've tried, so I don't have any direct comparisons. I can say that I much prefer the regular Aventinus and this one was just too sweet and boozy for my tastes."

"What an intense and extraordinary beer. I didn’t see that coming. Taste keeps mutating and revealing new fronts. Great sipper and highly recommendable."

""

""
""
"O - Very good beer with fairly intense flavor for a strong beer, worth it."
""
""
"Pour is a murky brownish dark purple with a tight tan head. Nose is much like regular aventinus, lots of esters, banana, lemon. A hint of peppery spice with a good bit of dark berry fruits. Taste has a touch of booze through the finish, full bodied with strong carbonation and a light burn. Lots of dark berries, light banana and a touch of spice to it."
""
""
"This is a great beer, but with a doubt a sipper."

"O/D-Another highly regarded overseas brew that I struggle to appreciate. It's good and the style is fairly rare to see. Still, I won't go out of my way to purchase again."
"I've noticed that only one of Schneider Weisse's Brewpubs is listed here (the one in Kehlheim). They have a second one right near Marienplatz and the Hofbrauhaus in Munich!!! It's actually the original site of Schneider Weisse's brewery but due to bombing in WWII, they decided to move the brewing part to a more spacious location in Kehlheim. The Weisse Braeuhaus is the name of Schneider Weisse's brewpub in Munich and it's a institution with the locals for a very good reason: THEY CARRY the ENTIRE SELECTION of Schneider Weisse beers (even the limited edition ones) and they have amazing food as well- the cook there just came out with a cookbook containing rare collections of old German food recipes, most of which also feature either beer or organs as a main ingredient! http://www.schneider-weisse.de/index.php?lang=en&tpl=brauerei.brauhaeusser"
" I've had a few beers in my day and this one has to rank in my top five."
"M - Light/medium bodied but incredibly dense and silky on the tongue.  Feel is fantastic"
""
""
"Overall: Smooth sipping beer to be enjoyed in a snifter. Complex flavors"
"O - The Eisbock is definitely a top of the line and complex beer. While I prefer the more basic weizenbocks, this one definitely is worth a try. The flavors make it seem like your favorite hefe was loaded down with malts and alcohol. The blend is a complex one and this rewards patient sipping - even if it is pretty drinkable. As the bottle says, Prost!"
""
"This is a terrific style and while you will not drink 5 of these in a session it's worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer defies style classification, as it shares characteristics with a weizenbock, a Belgian strong dark ale, and a wheatwine/barleywine. For that, it is interesting. It is just hard to get past the booziness and the sweetness."
""
""
"O- Big, strong, and roasty. A great beer for winter."
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
"O- Not my favorite, but that doesn't matter. According to the style I feel like they did a good job covering up a 12% beer while keeping it light bodied. I'd say the nose could use a little clean up with a dry hop, but that would be against the style; I'd do it anyway though."

"This big hearty brew lived in the fridge for quite some time before hitting the glass ... I figured this one could handle a little aging. Bought a bottle in Edmonton and basically forgot about it for a while. Purple label and dark-looking contents recall a bottle of prune juice, which in fact jives fairly well with what this heavy hitter tastes like. A lot better and more interesting than prune juice per se but that's one element in the flavor profile. Quite an impressive tan head forms as you pour, and I was immediately struck by the color: Its lighter than expected, a reddish copper/orange darkening to brown. The rich sweet aroma included plums, fresh Concord grape juice (not present in Aventinus proper), rum, treacle, and dark bread, with the overall effect evoking port wine or cask-aged rum. Palate was one for the ages, a ton of different dark, sweet, tangy, and bitter elements that vie for one's attention. Banana and bubble gum fruit esters make their requisite appearance along with a shit ton of clove and cinnamon spice notes; I lost the former sweet fruit notes about halfway through my glass but the spice remained steadfast. Some mild acidity almost like red currants and then a huge aromatic alcohol burn like that found in many tripels warms the mouth and gathers steam over the course of the journey. Whoa. Numbing primes the palate for an onslaught of bitter and earthy yet somehow still sweet flavors that recall doughy black licorice (remember those licorice pipes with the red sprinkles on the end to simulate fire?) ... Potent raisin, prune, and sweet bread pudding flavors work well with a somewhat buttery or creamy mouthfeel that coats the entire palate. Some tobacco leaf emerges late. There was a notable quantity of brown sediment at the bottom of the glass that looked like wet cigar. Didn't sample this, sorry. All in all a pretty heady experience, one I'd certainly repeat but only as a rare treat. Freezing and concentrating the original Aventinus brings out additional earthy, bitter, herbal, and spicy components and the fruit is downplayed, with what remains of the latter moving firmly into raisin/date territory rather than banana. Should be on any dark sweet beer freak's bucket list and not particularly hard to find."
""
""
""
""
"O - Really good. Would definitely get it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - When the weather turns cold, I could drink this one everyday. This is a great sipping beer."
""
""

"Excellent taste and unobtrusive nose. You get full on this one and the strength of the brew leaves you feeling nice and mellow. Just takes one good goblet! I loved this beer and would go back for a second tasting or two but I suspect this won't be on tap long. A beautiful, drinkable strong!"
""
""
"O - Incredibly rich, complex yet finely tuned beer. 12% alcohol content is well incorporated into the flavour and it's presence enhances the experience and all the complexity of this incredible beer. Very impressive."
""
"A real delicacy, not one to pass up. Can't wait to get my hands on an old vintage. Top-tier brew."
""
""
"O: Delicious brew - flavor profile is very similar to their Tap 6, but everything is kicked up a notch. Alcohol is hidden well and this is actually a very easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - my first of style and I am unsure. All too sweet and alcoholic reminds me more of hooch than beer. Better as it warms as the sweetness aligns closer to barley wine style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interestingly complex beer. Probably the most complex I've had yet. I really did not know what to expect but it did tasted pretty good. A sipper."
""

"Caramel and bananas, brown sugar, rum, slight bite of alcohol heat. Smooth and full bodied, chewy and rich. A big beer perfect for a snowy December night."

"o - Overall I thought this was a great beer; super easy to drink. Tons of bananas, malts, and dark fruits, and some Belgian notes in the taste. Great beer; one of those ones I see everywhere but rarely buy, and I need to buy it more often."
""
"Overall: This is my first eisbock, so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but this was a really good beer. If it wasn't for the astringency mentioned above, this would have scored higher (not sure if this is typical for the style or not), but even with that, it's still worth a try."

"Picked up a bottle of their reserve/anniversary series. This one was brewed in 2006, released for 2013. Poured in a weisse vase, the beer is a deep, dark, chestnut-highlighted brown coloring with a slight haze, no head, and a collection of carbonation bubbles settling onto the surface that you are unable to see throughout the body. Looks solid. Aromas of date and fig all over the forward nose, with a solid richness throughout. Earthy tones, with cherry highlights and a boozy kick. Flavors of roast and old world fruit sweetness on the forward tongue, with a blending of date and fig forming a solid backbone, along with some rich, roasted caramel notes. Earthy tones round everything out, and there is a definite kick of booze throughout the beer. The ABV also has a wine-like character to it. Smooth, robust body that the carbonation lightens, but you still get to enjoy chewing on. Wow! Richly sweet, earthy aftertaste with a building warmth as you go. The finish is robust, smooth, and leaves a cloying layer of caramel and fruit sweetness. Holy hell, this beer is tasty, big, and apparently ages amazingly well."

"I had my bottle with a plate of softer Italian cheeses, the names of which i have no idea, but some of which I would say were roughly similar to parmesan that has the wetness and gooeyness of a Muenster. Just an amazing way to have this beer, which is how you can have it at Brew Beers & Ciders on Soi Thong Lor, Soi 13 in Bangkok an incredible new beer oasis in the world's capital of boring beer which offers 200 kinds of beer. Heroes these guys and the others who now seem to be successfully fighting off the triple whammy of three separate taxations that have effectively taxed imported beer 300 percent. Or at least for now."

"My first eisbock! Bottle #2012 79464. Pours into my tulip brownish purple, cloudy, with a creamy looking light khaki head. Aroma is huge aromatic fruits, figs, plums, black cherry, pears, caramel, chocolate. Flavor is a mix of chocolate fig and salty caramel. Intense mix of flavors here. Hints of spice and light alcohol bite. Creamy mouthfeel yet plenty of carbonation. Very sweet. Tasty stuff."

"O - Because of the mild to med throat heat, I'm thinking this would be an excellent winter offering. I rated this just below perfect for the sole reason that its my first stab at this style so I don't really have anything to compare it to. That said, there is nothing bad to say about this brew."

"first off... I love high octane.. so right out of the gate we are off to a good start... @ 12% alc./ vol... I am in my comfort zone... poured into a snifter from a 12oz. bottle... looks and pours similar to a barley wine!... so far so good, smells much like a barley wine as well...lots of black cherry and a slight hint of vanilla...the taste is full of black cherry and is very carbonated...the finish is short with some lingering heat and slight flavor... all in all... I like this very much... minus the carbonation..."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/21/2011. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fairly large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, fig, banana, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, wheat, clove, pepper, and light floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity notes. Taste of big raisin, fig, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, banana, molasses, dark bread, wheat, clove, pepper, and floral earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, pepper, wheat, clove, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent eisbock style. Damn nice complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for such a big beer. A very enjoyable offering as expected."

"Overall: When I heard about a second Aventinus beer that was a hybrid with a bock, I was struck with joy. After drinking this beer, I remember my dad telling me ""Don't get too excited over things; Something about it will be bound to disappoint you"". This beer is a good choice, but the feel really killed it for me. I guess I'll be sticking to the original."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of the style, but since this is my first one I'm mainly going off of how BA describes the style, and it seems to pretty similar to that. This beer didn't have the greatest drinkability, it's for sure a sipper, but the flavors did do a good job at holding my attention but one bottles is just the right amount, no way I would anymore than that, it would get too sweet and boozy. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, It was very good and full of nice fruity aromas that were pretty pleasing and it had just enough wheat in it. What I liked the least about this beer was how boozy it was, I know it's !2% but the alcohol seems a little harsh to me and I think it could have hidden better. I might buy this beer again for special occasion, but I don't see my getting it again in the near future, but I would I feel like it's worth trying, I think wine lovers would really like this. All in all I wasn't really impressed with this beer, but I wasn't disappointed either, I just think that that alcohol could have been hidden a little better and that really hurt the drinkability, but the other than that the flavors and aromas were pretty nice. This is my second beer from this brewery and I for sure like the Wiezenbock the most and I would like to try more of their beers and I will be on the look out for more examples of this style. It's a nice sipper, but I wouldn't call it a favorite."

"a little bitter fruit-y, a little almost over-ripe fruit-y to the point of a slight vinegar. a little bit like a wine, the alcohol comes through in the nose, and then again on the back of the tongue. have to keep it cool or i bet the alcohol will run rampant over the taste. medium to thick feel on the tongue and overall a decent brew considering it's 12%. reading over others' reviews the 'ripe cherries' description hits it on the head. such a difference in the german/austrian versio of high abv brews versus the belgians'.... i've had it before, i'll have it again, but it's not tops on my list for the higher abv taste. but they did do a great job on it...."

"D- I was a bit surprised how boozy it was, but it was delicious. I'm not sure I could handle more than one."
"The flavours where very well balanced and the beer went down better than I was expecting whilst still having to be sipped. The aroma was really something special though with each smell complimenting the previous."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fresh, I'm sure the booze would knock my tongue out, but it's done a good job of evolving into something soft and mellow...ish. I seriously can't imagine how boozy this would be with only a month or two of age on it. The warmer it gets, the harsher it gets - and the less I want to drink it. Worth a try, but drink cold!"

"Overall: Very delicious and lush with lots of depth and layers of flavor. Again, I really liked the aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer, with the 12% ABV not immediately apparent."
"O: I like this beer, especially for the fact that it is 12% and it masks the alcohol relatively well. You can still tell it is there, but it still tastes like a beer. There were only a few downsides, where I thought it was a bit too fruity and I would have liked more head...even though it's hard for a high alcohol beer to have a decent head, this didn't have one at all."
""
""
"Overall, I feel like I'm not being fair to this beer. It's obvious it's an excellent beer, but wheat beers in general are not my thing."
"Purplish burgundy with off-white head that fades. Aroma of dark wheat, prunes, grapes, booze. Tastes of prunes, grapes, dark wheat, medicinal flavor, booze, minor apricots. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Slick mouthfeel. Pretty tame for 12% ABV."
""
""
"O - Aventinus Weizen Eisbock might be a high alcohol beer but this one is showing significant signs of age leading me to believe I waited a little too long to crack this precious beer open. Its thick maltiness creates a beautiful marriage with the yeast esters but peeking notes of soy sauce disrupt the flow. 2006 in 2012 is good but not as wonderful as it could be."
""
"From what I understand, this is a difficult and time consuming beer to make. First it must be brewed to a higher strength, then frozen to concentrate, then lagered for a long period of time. This one is a nice alternative to other high strength, highly hopped ales like American Barleywines, Russian Imperial Stouts and Imperial IPAs. Highly recommeded-just to expand the palate perspective! Merry Christmas!"

"Wow - what an experience - so many input components that I was unfairly waiting for at least one of them to go off the rails, but, nope - mea culpa - everything is oh so very well balanced and integrated. A hallmark for this uncommonly available style, which given its inherent nature, needs finesse and subtly in order to be even remotely drinkable. This has both, and more, in spades, so grab one if you can."

"Full-bodied with medium carbonation. Feels somewhat syrup and sticky in the mouth. Well-integrated alcohol provides pleasant warmth to the finish without making it harsh. The richness of flavour in this beer verges on decadence, making it a real treat if you fancy something sweet. Love it."

""
""
"O: There's a reason this is one of my all-time faves. World-class, this beer is."
"Drinkability : a very nice good beer in the style Eisbock. To drink very slowly at cellar temperate in cold of winter."
""
"Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock is one of the most interesting beers I've tasted. It me over an hour to finish the 11.2 oz. bottle, and when I was finished I thought to myself that I was just growing accustomed to the beer's intensity and complexity. I'll be revisiting this one soon."

"Overall - Enjoyable and different from most beers out there. I had this out of a wooden cask one time and drank three of them. I don't know how I did that. Wasted youth. Anyway, it doesn't impress me as much out of the bottle, but perspective is a funny thing."

"Overall - Excellent, my first eisbock, id describe this somewhere between a heffe, a belgium strong ale, and even a port wine. Fantastic fruity notes, big alcohol flavor in each sip and nice amouth of sweet suagrs and spices. A must try."

"O: Definitely a nice beer. The alcohol is present, but I wouldn't have put it at 12% ABV based upon taste alone. Well balanced, a fair amount of complexity. Definitely not a beer that I would drink all the time, but it is certainly well-crafted."

"The most important part: Taste. I'd have to say that this is a very well flavored wheat ale. I want to say it had a mango taste to it coupled with a strong wheat taste. Very smooth and easy to drink. Favorited."
""

"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours dark cloudy toffee brown with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the side of the glass, but not many. It appears darker than the regular Aventinus. There are aromas of banana, sweet malt, bubblegum, dark fruits, sweet malts, and some alcohol. It is all the aromas I loved in the regular Aventinus, but intensified. The taste follows the nose. The banana flavors are strongly represented from the yeast. The sweet malt provides a nice backbone for this beer. There are dark fruits in the flavor as well. The alcohol is detectable in the taste, but it blends well with this beer. It does not come across as boozy, but well balanced. The body is full with solid carbonation. The beer is smooth with a clean finish. The alcohol provides a nice warming feel. I wouldn't mind having a few of these put away for cold winter months. This is an excellent beer that held up very well despite the age."

"Served from bottle into a frosted Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock glass (proper). Poured a deep dark red-orange (almost brown) with a three finger light tan colored head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wood, spices, subtle sweet alcohol, dark fruit, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, spices, sweet alcohol, dark fruit, and wheat. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The balance on this one was truly awe-inspiring as all the components in this one blended really well together and none of them overtook the others. You would never guess this one to be 12% as it wears it so well. Definitely a must try for anyone who calls themselves a beer fan."

"Pours a woody, ruby haze with a short-lived fizzy cap of a tan head. The nose is quite sweet - cherries, candied sugar, malted wheat, bit of booze - rather pleasant. The taste carries a lot of the same qualities and the alcohol is well masked/incorporated. Not all that drinkable but about as easy-drinking as you could hope for at this ABV."

"O: One of the best beers I've ever had. It has all the flavour of a dark bold Belgian with the texture of a German Weizen. It's actually ruined the Belgian quadrupel/strong dark ale for me. If you don't like this beer I don't like you."
"O: I've never had an Eisbock before, so I've nothing to compare to. However, the beer is full of great aromas and flavors. I would definitely pick this up again...especially if I find it for $4.99 on sale again. I think I would clean them out."

"Poured from a 33 cl little into a pint glass, bottled in 2011. This a dark brownish tea color with a massive but short lived tan head with a significant amount if carbonation still bubbling up from the bottom. The smells are very present and strong, ripe fruit, plums, candy and toffee malts. The feel is thick and full of carbonation. The taste is good, lots of malts, small hop bite, ripe fruit, sugar and a notice alcohol flavor / burn."

"O: Drinks like a beer with a much lower ABV, there are hints of the alcohol in the smell and taste but it is pretty well hidden - this beer could really sneak up on you. I really enjoy the smell and the flavors of this beer and will definitely be having it again. Though I might add that this is not really a sessionable beer unless you are the ultimate champ - just too much ABV."

"Bottle. Pours brown with a long lasting, off-white, foamy head. Aroma is of barnyard yeast, wheat malt, brown sugar and alcohol. The body is full, smooth and creamy. Taste is of dark fruit, wheat malt, yeast and brown sugar. Long, warming finish. The bottle was old, but the brew was still great."
"500mL bottle. Pours a dark brown with light brown hues and a half inch of head. No lacing. Aromas of banana, cloves, booze, and dark fruits. Flavors of banana, cloves, earth, dark fruits and a bit flowery. Some chocolate and vanilla. Almost too sweet. Doesn't taste as boozey as you'd expect from a beer with 12% Abv. Heavy mouthfeel. Overall, not something I could drink all the time but a decent beer."

"Some times I run across a beer that I feel is a beer, but not really. This is one of them. I could easily pour this and show it as a slightly carbonated sherry or so other fortified wine."
"This beer is truly unique. I don't believe I've ever had anything like it. It lacks the malty complexity of Ayinger Celebrator, but the high carbonation and acidic fruitiness adds a different kind of complexity alltogether. A marvelous drinking experience. One of the very best beers I have reviewed to date."

"Pours a dark brown color with a nice two finger cocoa head on it. Good lacing in spite of the 12% abv. Very well carbonated, and the head sizzles down to a sliver over the first couple minutes. The nose is excellent, raisin, plum, prunes, malt, and slight hops are the main culprits. Really rich and complex nose.. Well balanced as well. Wow.. Then there's the taste. This is my first beer of this style, and I love the taste. Same profile as the nose, and where did they put the 12%abv?? The feel is rich, creamy, and complex... a total home run here. Overall, I love this beer. It's so complex and tasty that I will definitely have to search for this again. Cheers!"

"O: This is for sure one of the best beers I have ever had in my life. It's so amazing I just can't get enough of it. Well worth the price."
""
""
""
"Remarkably, despite the 13% ABV and the syrupy pour, this is not an overly sweet beer. It is well balanced and tremendously crafted. It's an absolute winner; highly recommended!"

"very smooth"

"O-- Biggest negative is how boozy it is but otherwise this is exceptional. A lot of balance in the body and a lot of flavors. Total winter beer and just a treat to have."
"Appearance is a dark brown with maroon to orange highlights when held to light. The head is thick and dense, but no lacing left behind. Powerful scents remind me of black licorice and root beer - very unique smell. There is a lot going on in the taste - both good and bad. Banana, clove, dark fruit, molasses. It's very complex. But the finish and after taste reminds me of cherry cough syrup. This seemed to get stronger as I drank it, and finally, I couldn't take it anymore. The alcohol is very prominent, and its effects are quickly felt. The mouthfeel is syrupy and slick. I'm not sure how to grade this beer, as it is so complex, but I did not care for it personally, and will reflect this in the overall score."

"This is a after dinner digestif like the brewer says. From what I had heard, I wasn't expecting this superb beer. Instead, I was impressed and welcomed. This is a unique beer from a great brewer, enjoy!"
""

""
"Overall: i did enjoy this beer a lot, the sweetness is more apparent as it got more towards room temp. Something that i will revisit when i am in the mood for this style"
"Pours a purple-mahogany into tulip glass. Small light tan head that dissipates very quickly. Not much lacing. It smells fantastic. So many different things going on. I can smell caramel, chocolate, and fruit. Earthy smell as well. Taste is chocolatey-sweet with hints of fruit and a mild bitter finish. Good carbonation. This is one of my favorites. My first taste of this beer was at the J. Clyde in Birmingham, AL. If you like dopplebock, I think you will love this beer."
"D: this brew is big and bold and a serious sipper. i genuinely couldnt imagine drinking multiple of these in the same night. drinks like a belgian strong dark with some more heat. a very interesting style that i would love to get my paws on some more of."
""
"Overall this is a really special, unique beer. Flavorful, rich, concentrated. Will definitely pick up another."
"O - definitely a world class beer."
"DRINKABILITY: Due to the high alcohol content, I wouldn't have more than one of these at a sitting unless there's a designated driver available, but that one serving will give you a delicious very strong dark lager -- smooth, well balanced, and absolutely delightful to drink."
"This is a completely different beast than the regular and probably different from any other beer I've had. The deep, dark fruits carry in a completely new way to my palate. Rounded, boozy, enticing. Very nice offering. I need to find other eisbiers..."
""
"O-Decent, but I would try others of a similar style before coming back to this one."
""
"This is my 1st brew of this style and even though it is a 	wheat eisbock, it is pretty spot on as far the description goes. A very nice sipper, or a gulper if your goal is to get shit faced quickly (not my goal). This is a great brew and I'll give er an A fer shure !!"

"It pours a murky chocolate brown with a tan, controlled head. The most identifiable smell coming off of this beer is the aroma of sweet wheat. What a great malty aroma! Tastes like a bigger version of the Aventinus, more concentrated flavors, but just the slightest hint of booze. This velvety beer is dangerously drinkable for 12%. This is something I'd like to keep a stock of, hell, everyone should always have this in their fridge."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really strong beer. The alcohol is super hot. The flavor is good, but really overshadowed by the alcohol."
""
"O - This is a pretty good beer for being as big and bold as it is its a good sipping beer worth getting sometime to try"
"O- The regular Bock version is out of this world and this concentrated version is another home run. Absolutely stellar beer."
"One final note: I’m starting to fear that eisbocks are hangovers in a bottle for me. Woke up the next day with a pounding headache from a shared bottle of this. The same thing happened the last time I had an eisbock. Is there a pattern here? Am I going soft? Or are these things just packing too potent a punch?"
"Overall: Very good beer overall. This is my first eisbock and this one has made me curious to check out other beers in the style. I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try."
"O - This is a very complex, big beer. A great beer. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very happy to have made this my #150 review."
"Atmosphere is great. Light carbonation pours into a thick, foamy head which lingers before cratering down to a thin blanket of foam which remains throughout the experience. Nose is a really great combination of malt, fruit, and sugar components with a nice rustic tone. Flavor is a woody malt, well balanced with bittersweet and fruity components. Bittersweet and a little pungent with big alcohol. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"O- This is an awesome beer and worth trying. This is a well balanced sipper. I am just enjoying this more and more with every sip, definitely will be stocking up!"
"Mouthfeel is lighter than expected but still packs it in. Nice creamy texture as it goes down. Overall, as expected, this is one great beer. Amazing how easy it is to drink for such a high ABV beer."
"I don't want to be too repetitive with my praise, but this is the kind of beer you look for if you like giant English barleywines and BSDAs/quads like I do. While I've never had it ""fresh", I can only guess that time has been nothing but good to this beer, because it's both smooth and powerful. Very memorable, and, in my opinion, exactly what you're hoping for if you pick up a beer like this."
"B-"
"O: A solid Eisbock."
"D/O- Split this with my main squeeze fdkayti, proved to be a good amount for each of us. Would recommend and definitely have again!"
"O: Without a doubt this is a world class beer. I prefer it to others including Ayinger Celebrator, Trappist Westlvleteren 8 and and Trappist Rochefort 10. That's a bold statement, but this is an excellently crafted beer. Not to mention that bang-for-the buck it's cheaper than standard Aventinus and it can't be beat. I'm glad I have more in the fridge!"
"Good beer, but not the gem that I may have hoped for given the reviews. The wheat qualities are noticeable, but pretty subdued. I certainly like it, but can't seem myself drinking it that often, as it is not good enough to justify the investment that 500ml of 12% brew requires!"
"Overall: Aventinus on steroids! Big-time sipper here, pretty darn complex and enjoyable."
"O - Great fragrance and immediate taste that seems wel balanced at first until the very end of the drink. For the most part it was great. Just a bit put off on the finish."
"Great balance and complexity. Too easy to drink for such a high ABV. Absolutely delicious."
"Overall this is a fine, fine eisbock. It's less complex than the ultra-good (for the style) bottled rendition of Aventinus-Eisbock. It is super-smooth and super-drinkable for such a big beer."
"The most active beer I've ever seen. As soon as I popped the top beer started gurshing out. I put my mouth over the bottle to keep the beer from spilling but the beer kept gushing. I thought man I'm gonna get drunk this way. Pepsi colored with a very quick massive head and just as suddenly no head. Wonderful aroma of dark fruits. Plums, raisins, grapes. Hints of chocolate. Very thick and syrupy in the mouth but in the best of ways. Just kind of coats the mouth. Wonderful tasting and the alcohol really sneaks up on you. This is probably the most malt heavy beer I've had and this hop head loves it. Roasted grains, lot's of dark fruit flavors. Hints of chocolate and bananna. Just enough sweetness to keep it balanced and a pepper spice finish. I love this beer. Highly recommended!"
"O- Absolutely delicious. Quite potent. Definitely a ""keeper"". Will purchase again and again."
"This is certainly not an anytime beer, or one to have frequently, but everyone ought to try it. The eisbock style started because of a mistake - a wonderful mistake indeed."
"Very sweet with tons of fruity flavor, but it doesn't really deviate from that much. A nice beer, but certainly not the best German style ice distilled beer I've had. Although, it would be interesting to see what 5 or 10 years could do to this beer."
"Light gold a bit hazy body, white head, multiple streams of carbonation, quick dissipation and a thin ring of foam around edge of glass. There's something wrong here, wet cardboard, obviously oxided, overpowered any aroma and flavor nuances. While I'm not sure we would have enjoyed this re the wheat after being pounded by brown sugar, prunes, raisins etc, we all noticed this was one frigging boozy monster. The low light of the tasting. Another of my big deviation beers, the booziness reminded me of Founder's Devil Dancer, and while their are proponents of both of these beers, I'm not one of them. Pass."
"O: A fantastic beer, much better than other eisbocks I have had."
"More like plantain in the mouth semi sweet chocolate covered caramel in the middle with an abrupt almost dry finish. Non-oxidized sherry and port like notes. Dried fruits like fig and dates and a nutty component. Very nice rich and creamy."
"Warming, lighter body, low carbonation. Complex. Very nice to have this, quite enjoyable."
"Overall: Unbalanced brew. The alcohol is very disturbing"
"Overall-My first ""Eisbock"". Definitely reminds me of the Weizenbock, just a bit boozier. The flavors were nice, would like a little less booze and carbonation. I prefer the Weizenbock, but I'd liek to believe this would be an A/A+ beer with age."
"This is a full bodied brew that is lightly carbonated. For 12% abv, the alcohol is well included and is matched with an array of flavors to make it quite enjoyable. I have not had a lot of experience with the eisbock style, but this was enough to spark my interest into having more."
"This beer poured out of the cask as a dark muddy brown color. The head on the beer was nowhere in sight, no lacing here either. The smell of the beer is a lot like the Aventinus with just a bit more booze. The taste is pretty similar too for the most part. The mouthfeel is the difference here, it's a bit on the flatter side from the cask and the aftertaste of the beer gives off a bit of a boozy heat that warms the chest. Overall I like both brews a lot, I may even like this more from a bottle. Both are great beers to try and I would like to have them again."
"The beer is a burnt orange hue, with a small head that dissipates rapidly, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma brings bananas, dark fruits, wheat, clove, and alcohol. Quite tasty. Bananas soaked in alcohol and a rum characteristic work well together. Sweetness and alcohol are present throughout, making this bottle optimal for sharing, as I wouldn't want more than half the bottle. The beer is medium bodied with moderately low carbonation. Overall, a very good representation of the style, though I seldom drink beers of this ilk."
"Overall: at $4.99 a bottle this is worth it. I have never tasted a better beer. I give it an overall rating of 666!"
"O: Overall this is an excellent beer. Probably my favorite wheat beer to date. Such strong, yet well balanced flavors, and still very easy to drink. I certainly will be trying this one again."
"Certainly not a beer I can imagine anyone drinking often. From the first sniff I knew this would be a huge beer and I was right. Good flavor but the big ABV hurts it, regular Aventinus would be my choice out of two, fo sho."
"O - holy shit i had no idea about the alcohol or its presence, although you want to say its overly hot i feel it actually provides part of a balance that the hops can't and don't."
"Overall this was quite an overwhelming experience for me. I didn't even really look into whether this beer would age well or not, but WOW, it does! I haven't had this beer fresh in a very long time but I remember it being fairly hot and all of that has passed for sure. This is what Sam Adams Triple Bock wishes it was. I think I'll pick up a few more of these to age and advise you all to do the same :)"
"Had this on tap, and I found it pretty amazing. Poured a cloudy reddish brown with a finger of foamy white head. Caramel and sweet fruits in the nose. Toasty malts in the taste, caramel, and a wallop of candy and dark fruits--raisins, cherries, bananas, figs. The fruit balanced out the inevitable spiced rum alcohol bite of this semi-distilled 12%ABV eisbock. Medium-bodied and chewy, very nice and drinkable. Definitely to be savored slowly."
"I guess it's good. The soapy thing is just something I have a hard time with. I have one more left but think I will just pass it on."
"Bottle 2008/8167. Pours a light cola brown with a short lived head and leaves very light lacing - appears to be lightly carbonated and scaring me right now as it looks like the pannepot disaster i drank recently. Nose has pure cola, ginko nut, with a smooth vanilla bourbon note. Taste is somewhat spicy with chicory coffee and sea salt caramel, finishes a bit astrigent and acidic to some extent thats nice because at 12% you dont taste or sense a hint of alcohol."
"jd"
"O- one of my favorite all time beers, and my favorite wheat beer. Get this beer, and enjoy every drop."
"Overall, this was a great find. Enjoyed this beer from start to finish. I think that it hides the 12% well but definitely brings some heat to this brew. I cant wait to get my hands on some more."
"O - This is very tasty, just overly sweet for my palate, definitely a sipper and I really don't find myself saying that too often."
"I love it. Highly impressed."
"O- Love this find. Not often that I find any eisbock, but if anyone happens to see this one, go for it, it will be like a fine wine of beers for you."
"I'm happy I finally had a use for my big bubble top Aventinus glass that just seams to sit in my cupboard. An interesting brew and if my memory serves me I liked the unfrozen version even more then this and I liked this quite a bit. I need to thank liamt07 for knocking yet another beer off my want list"
"O: This is a truly amazing brew. Gets the banana bread taste like no other beer has ever had. Just a tiny tad too sweet, would have preferred a bit more nut-like taste in the brew (but for this I guess I only need to drink the regular Aventinus). Drinkability is pretty high for a beer this strong."
" -J"
"drinkability: another amzing beer from them"
"overall - a bit more intense than the regular Aventinus."
"Notes: Condensed Aventinus, what is not to like? If one does not mistake it for the regular version (sorry sis, it wasn't me. I wasn't there :P) this is quite a nice savoring ale. BTW, since they don´t mention and it is a relatively recent twist done by freezing the brew... Esibocks are not done according to the reinheistgebot? :P"
"Definitely worth trying but far from being a session beer. I was one and done"
"This bottle was shared with zep9865 during our mini tasting before DLD. This beer pours a murky raisin brown with a beige head that laces the glass. I've had this one before but never reviewed it. This smells super, and syrupy sweet. It wreaks of sweet dark malts, raisins, figs, and light yeast. The nose is even a little sweet for me. This beer is very yeasty and very heavy on the raisins. Wow is it sweet. It's hard to even rate to style when a beer is this sweet. It's borderline cloying. It drinks medium in body but the sweetness prevails above all other aspects. Does this beer taste good? Yes, but in small quantities. The alcohol content doesn't even matter to me because this is super malty (and understandably so) and super fruity. I just can't get past the sweetness. It's a nice style to try but this beer specifically just isn't for me."
"This beer enjoyed at the Abner in a pint glass. Pours a reddish brown with a trace of off white head that leaves no lacing and has little retention. The aroma is strong with caramel and figs and spices. The taste starts with notes of fog and caramel and then finishes with a slight alcohol taste, but not nearly as much as you would think for a 12 point beer. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth fo the amount of alcohol. Overall a great beer... But leave it to one."
"O - An excellent eisbock, with a nice complexity and harmony of flavors and body."
"Just drank a pint at the Bulldog Tavern and Emporium of Fine and Most Excellent Brews and Spirits. Average head and carbonation with a credible amount of lacing. Smell of alcohol and malts. Color was bodacious. Mouthfeel was like heavenly night blooming jasmine with a hint of mirliitons and cypress buds. Taste was equally balanced with flowers and trees. This brew should be in the Hall of Fame of eisbocks. I'll never forget tonight and this brew even if was overpriced compared to ma favorite IPAs."
"D: A very good sipping beer.  "
"Overall: A very tasty Eisbock from Germany."
"A really good bottle, i will plan on getting a few to drink and some to age, and see what happens, i don't need any heat to mellow, but just want to see what will happen and these are cheap, should be fun."
"Prickly but light carbonation in a medium to heavy body, this beer is a phenomenal offering from Schneider. The fruity depth rivals that of the most well done Russian Imperial Stouts, and the ease of drinking is top notch. At 12%, this is more than a little bit dangerous."
"O: An interesting brew. The concentrated alcohol drowns out a lot of the softer hefe notes that I felt the standard Aventinus had done a fantastic job of retaining. That said, the alcohol accentuates a variety of new flavors; notably the molasses, liquorish and spice. I’m not sure if it’s worth the trade off though."
"Picked this one up a while back at some liquor store or other, as it sounded good and the price was solid (about 2 bucks, as I recall). Poured a slightly less than clear amber color with a creamy white head. Aromas of wheat, booze, dark fruits, banana and clove. Thick and full bodied, boozy, with spicy wheat, cloves, bananas and booze soaked raisins."
"Producing a drinkable eisbock is hard enough. Producing one so downright beautifully flavored is sheer art. If you're in the mood, this beer will take you where you want to go. Be careful."
"Overall: It's good. I am not a great friend of ""bocks"" of any kind, but I can give this one the respect it deserves. At 12% ABV, it is a good sipper."
"I'd guess this should hold up to some age and that should mellow the alcohol. There is a really good if not great beer hiding under that alcohol."
"This is like the bigger blacker cousin of aventinus. Delicious and hot while strikingly drinkable while being a HIGH ABV beer. This is somethin else."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and the finish clean. Incredible for a 12% beer. Well, I say beer, but really this has lost much of it's connection with the beer family. And the evolution is something to behold. I expected this to be good, but this is exceptional. Well played German brewers, well played."
"Hides its high abv very well. I have to say it again: dessert quad. Easy to drink and leaves me wanting more."
"Not as drinkable as the standard version due to the alcohol concentration, but it still has the nice body and carries the quailty that Schneider is famous for."
"Overall, a really fine beer. If you like wheat and intensity both, this beer combines them perfectly."
"-not a big fan. i drank the whole thing, but it was more like soda to me. oh well. was excited for it, but cant like em all i suppose"
"D: I was really impressed by this one and surprised at how much I liked it. The strong flavors of spices and hops really made this a great sipper. Highly recommended."
"D: It's very tasty but to me this is a desert beer. I wouldn't drink more than one of these! In the meantime, its too intense for my girlfriend so I have to finish 12 ounces, , shouldn't be too hard though..."
"D: One bottle would pretty much be the limit on this. I split this between a few friends and even just 5 or so ounces was a good warm up. The alcohol is definitely there, though not overbearing. I definitely prefer the regular version, though this is still a very good Eisbock."
"Not bad, but I much prefer regular Aventinus."
"D. Extremely drinkable. This beer is pretty much everything that I was expecting. It is a amped up version of an already amazing beer. Has some alcohol aroma and flavor but doesnt drink at all like 12%"
"D-really great, the 12% abv is not obvious, will definitely get again"
"Drinkability- I thought this was pretty good. I would have it again."
"Pours a opaque dark brown with a 1 inch tan head that lasts for the whole beer. Sticky ring lacing on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits, caramel, wheat, and alcohol sharpness. Tastes of overripe dark fruit, caramel sweetness, and alcohol. This beer was very carbonated in my opinion and had a very sticky mouthfeel. An alcohol burn was present with each sip. Drinkability is above average but with the alcohol burn and the almost sickly sweetness I don't think I would get this again."
"I have a 2007 in my collection that I'm excited to try in a year or two! This beer just gets better as it warms and with age; I think it's going to be epic."
"This was my first Eisbock. Drank it on an empty stomach...wow. A noteworthy experience but not a beer I would have multiples of. Good for a winter night by the fire to feel the warmth, but a night out on the town and I would be looking at the bottom of the bar stool. I would definitely drink it again."
"This beer must age well, with a possibly two-year old bottle still providing good aromas and flavors. Although it reminds of a wine, the mouthfeel is much thicker with a stronger taste of alchohol than in the aroma. It is not very drinkable to me due to the high abv and sweetness."
"D - Yes sir! This stuff is delicious and I never would have guessed it was 12%. Hot damn. Very warming, yet refreshing."
"Pours a deep brown, almost black color with effervescent off-white head. Aroma is rich with dried fruits, yeast, and bread. The taste is huge dried fruits, plum, raisin with typical Weizen banana and a big cereal malt flavor. Alcohol flavor is very strong but well matched with the big malt taste. Palate is full-bodied and thick with a long-lasting malty aftertaste. Wonderful beer."
"I can drink this stuff all night... if I pace myself right"
"This is my first Eisbock. Maybe this just isn't a true representation, but reminds me more of a Belgian-style beer. I'm not complaining though. Prost!"
"Im glad I had the opportunity to try this. This beer might be a regular for me."
"D: obviously is not a one sip beer, if you have the time to enjoy one, this can be a nice choice"
"Price = $3.99 at Whole Foods"
"11.2 oz. longneck brewed to 25.5 Plato; this bottle (#035611) has been in my cellar for at least five years. Fairly clear raspberry brown hue is punctuated by a few chunks, and capped with a light tan head that nearly disappears by the end. Smells vinous, with blackberries and black cherries, and gives the impression of Fruit Roll-Ups or raspberry Tootsie Rolls. It is very smooth and quite malty, with a dark, rich flavor, and only a light sweetness. Vinous and dark fruits pop up, with burnt sugar, dark caramel, noticeable wheat, mild bitterness, and just a hint of oxidation. It has a well-carbonated, thick and smooth body that is chalky and dry, with a warming finish. This unique beer is delicious and imminently sippable, and makes a great addition to anybody's cellar."
"Piece by piece, node by node, everything in this beer is good. But, like I said, it just don't jibe together very well."
"A classic wheat doppelbock, this is a concentrated version of the original and revered Aventinus Weizenbock, and a welcome recreation of a brewing storage error."
"D: Very surprising. Drinks like an old ale on top of the already perfect Aventinus. Alcohol heat is not bothersome and hidden very well behind some very nice yeast and bready notes. Has the signature Aventinus flavor profile that makes for an incredibly drinkable Eisbock."
"D: I believe this has improved over time, mostly in the nose, however, the appearance appears to have suffered. I'd chalk that up to using a different glass and probably a different serving temp. Quite drinkable for a %12.00 beer. (3.5)"
"This eisbock is totally great."
"Salud!"
"Complex, very challenging. I know what I want with it, Ice Cream! But it's best by itself. Banana, Caramel, Cloves... Watch out as the 12% is almost undetectable with this childhood inducing creamy beer. Don't drink as much as you will want to, it will catch up with you in the morning! But, enjoy!"
"Pours a very murky brown color that seems to be layered...much lighter at the top. Definitely an unfiltered, bottle conditioned brew. Tiny white head that disappears in an instant. Scent is very wheat-like with some definite banana aromas. I also get some yeast, clove, and light chocolate. Taste is banana, wheat, spices (heavy on clove at first), bubblegum,...then followed by dark fruits and a little bit of chocolate. The yeasty flavors linger throughout the whole taste, as well as the alcohol. The alcohol doesn't seem to be as well balanced as was hoping for, but nonetheless, it is an amazingly delicious beer. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, but remains very well-carbonated. Alcohol burn towards the end. Drinkability is fairly high considering how tasty this is, but the ABV will creep up on you in an instant, so be careful!"
"EDIT: Flavors become more readily apparent as the beer warms and loses carbonation as it sits in the glass. If you refrigerate this beer, I recommend that you leave it to sit out for about 10 minutes before pouring."
"d-oddly very drinkable...not something you would usually say about a 12% beer. You imagine sipping this by a fire after shovelling snow for a couple hours."
"Drinkability - i love this style of beer, would have it in stock again for those who want something a little different but good."
"D - I don't really know how to call this part. This is a one and done beer, meant for sipping. It's a huge beer, but handles itself well enough, I think."
"Pours a murky and dense rusty brown, with some sediment eveident here. Finger or two of eggshell head, OK retention. Nose is big: strong raisin, caramel, loads of butterscotch and fusel alcohol (almost resembling vodka at times, yowza!). I can sense the heat coming. Tastes of dark fruits, plums, raisin, thick and massive caramel and butterscotch notes again. Dark fruits take a real backseat to the butterscotch as I move through this. Medium high carbonation, large and filling mouthfeel almost. Great body. This was a sipper for real, heat was really here."
"Overall this is an amazing beer to experience, but I think I still prefer regular Aventinus."
"Drinkability: At 12% ABV, this is a hefty beer. However, I get no heat. Ultimately, I think this beer could use perhaps a couple years to become truly excellent. I have a great respect for G. Schneider & Sohn, and they will always have a place in my refrigerator."
"This particular bottle was picked up just today, but was bottled is September of 2007! Never underestimate the little beer distributor. This is a great cold night, warm by the fireside beer that has gotten richer with age, (i've tasted an earlier vintage and there is a big difference in depth of flavor). I wouldn't have another I don't think, pretty rich... but is great while you have it."
"Drinkability: Too strong to be very drinkable, but certainly not bad in any way."
"D: Interesting and flavorful beer. I think only the mouthfeel and the hidden ABV, would keep me from having quite a few of these delightful brews. This was suggested by this site and my beer guy at local Binny's. I have been tempted to try this style for some time and look forward to trying other representations from various breweries in the future."
"Pours a murky deep brown with a light tan fizzy head. Recedes quickly. Nose is dark grapes, bread, sweet spices & caramel malt. Taste is complex as well, dark fruits are forefront, some phenol noticeable, cloyingly sweet and mild finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied. Large format bottle is nice looking, great label, wish I liked this more than I do! Not a favourite style of beer I guess. Drinkable for sure, smooth on the palate and easy to enjoy."
"D- A nice brew with an interesting flavor. I haven't had many Eisbocks so its tough to compare."
"Overall I always love this beer and have had it on several occasions. I'm a big fan of the regular Aventinus so this is right up my alley. If you want a desert sipper, or something to brag about in front of your BMC loving friends, take a few of these home. Just be careful, they go down way to easy and will easily get you hurt LOL! Cheers!"
"Slightly thinner body, lower carbonation, a little sticky and dry. Drinks pretty well, although there's a somewhat off putting astringency which is almost tart. It wasn't an infection, but just something that I wasn't really into."
"Drinkability is really good. I wouldn't recommend drinking them back to back but you could!"
"D: This is fairly boozy but then again, it's 12%!"
"This is a well-developed and remarkable brew. It appeals to my love for big, strong beers, but the tartness and malted wheat make it unique. One of my favorites! I wonder how it ages..."
"D- The flavor and aroma of this beer were phenomenal, however the 12% really made itself known, and drinking more than one or two of these could be dangerous."
"As much as the flavor of this one is pleasant, the drinkability is terrible for me. It's just too intensely sweet and flavorful and there's too much alcohol."
"It's like a perfectly good Aventinus drenched in vodka. Not a fan."
"Cheers!"
"D-This beer is almost too easy drinking.ABV is non-existent."
"Eric"
"I'd say that, when compared to regular Aventinus, this is less spicy, more alcoholic and perhaps a bit less sweet as well."
"Overall - A surprisingly drinkable beer given the 12% abv. The big caramel combined with the wheat and alcohol warmth make this a very drinkable beer for the abv. This would be a great beer to drink over the cold holidays in front of a fireplace with some smoked Gouda."
"Massive clove and green apple notes, that were either absent or passed undetected last time, were present, both in taste and aroma while the malt character seemed smaller against the other beers. It was interesting to see that how a beer that seemed very malt forward by itself had other elements (fruit, spice) that came out beautifully when contrasted against others. It was easy to detect the base German beer character too, that seemed lost in the previous bottle."
"Very full on the palate and sptrizy too with some morishly banana notes. Moving towards a richness here but still some way from Ode to Joy. More John Stuart Mill than it should be."
"I can see why this beer would be rated as someone's personal favorite."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied with little carbonation, but it seems to fit the style and makes this beer very smooth. The alcohol is really hidden fairly well considering how high an alcohol content it is."
"I poured into a nonic glass to a huge tan head without trying. It is copper colored with suspended yeast. The aroma is sweet, spicy, and loaded with booze. The taste is pretty much the same. It reminds me of a tripel. I really enjoy the spiciness of this beer. It does help mask the alcohol, which is present, but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is viscous, just the way I like it. The alcohol has a nice warming feel to it. This is a perfect beer for a chilly autumn evening, like this evening, or a cold winter day."
"Poured into a tulip. The body is dark mahogany with about two fingers with of rocky off white head that rapidly dissipates into soapy lacing. The smell is rich full of dark fruits, caramel, yeast, and alcohol. This smells really sweet, it reminds me of blueberry pie for some reason. The taste is dark fruits up front; figs and dates with a bready feel to it and slight traces of alcohol. The body is held up nicely with sweet malts. The carbonation is a bit higher than I expected. It's a little fizzier in my mouth than what I had anticipated, however the body is nice and heavy and not as syrupy as I would think a big beer like this would be. All things considered, I think this is rather drinkable, even though it's still a bit of a sipper."
"drinkability; this is a very drinkable beer but it will destroy anyone who drinks too much...I don't care how much tolerance you think you have. Drink and enjoy with nothing but respect and be careful, it goes down smooth and the alcohol will catch you by surprise but by that time it might be to late. Not a party beer but celebration drink for a special occasion."
"Schneider Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock pours a dark brown almost maroon dark shade of some color that's dark. Almost not even a cap of sparse bubbles floating on top, no stick. Smell is all clove and banana and some deep toasty malts. Really cant deserne any of the alcohol, it is hidden almost to well. Taste is all in the bananers, that are dipped in caramel and slight chocolates as well. Clove and other spices and the alcohol is masked in taste even better than the bottle. Feel is above medium but smooth as hell out the wooden cask. Carb is not so high but the character is. Cant drink to much of this stuff but it is still a great beer."
"This is a lovely beer. It's surprising just how gentle it is for all its extremity. It really stays true to its weizen roots, which give it a lovely roundness, and temper the big and boozy notes that appear throughout."
"D - Really good exspecially given the abv's really nice could see myself drinking a bunch more as the weather is getting colder."
"Very drinkable. I love this beer! Delicious."
"Beer is medium to light in body and pretty carbonated in the mouth, its sweet but not cloying. Its very malty up front but not hot at all. OK, I'm impressed. This beer is quite drinkble for the 12%, in fact I drink it before it hits me and start another doppelbock, not the smartest thing I've ever done. Its smooth and has a great finish that not too dry. There is no aftertaste and its a great drinking beer. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Drinkability-Other than the 12%abv, this beer is really drinkable."
"M/D: The body is nice and rich, the carbonation is spot on. The drinkability is only limited by your capacity to handle 12% beer for an entire evening..."
"A brilliant beer with lots of great flavour and almost perfectly to style."
"D: Good but quite strong. Lovely beer after all. Schneider quality"
"overall - quite good, but i'm not a fan of clove, so i wouldnt seek this out again."
"it's pops like the weizenbock. Feels like it too. Sits on the border of dessert and gastronomy beer. Nose of bubble gum candy, rosemary earth pine, wheat malt of mild grit, and acidic beet sugar. Finish of banana, burnt clove and sour plum. Incredible. Better than the littler stuff. Broader yet not affecting abv outside of a wonderful warmth in the throat."
"This beer pours a tawny oak with a massive 3 finger explosion of beige head that leaves just a slight bit of lacing as the beer disappears from my glass. The nose is like a concentrated Weizenbock. Big notes of banana nut bread, with clove and cinnamon. A slight hint of bubble gum mixed with dates. It really is a classic aroma profile. Just a touch of alcohol wafts as it warms to room temperature. The flavor profile is much the same. At its root is a classic Weizenbock with squishy brown bananas, over toasted bread, clove and just a slight nutty flavor. Brown sugar and figs intertwine with just a hint of its 12%. The alcohol in this beer is masterfully hid. Something I wish American Brewers would pay more attention to. It's not big, in your face flavors that just hide the alcohol leaving it to return when the beer warms up. This beer has intermingles the alcohol letting it play off all of the other flavors and aromas, making itself into a big boozy banana nut bread. The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer. You expect it to be a little harsh or astringent with the booze, but this is mellow and creamy smooth. This is a great beer, best served with warm fires and good company."
"Actually, I was surprised at how easily I could drink this, granted, one is enough, but I drank it much faster than any other 12% I've had."
"D: Highly recommended, very drinkable, but not in quantity (too sweet and strong). This is a great selection if you just want one beer, anything before or after it would be somehow diminished. One of my favourites; will definitely be drinking again."
"I'm a little torn on drinkability. The taste is outstanding but with the alcohol barely evident it would be an interesting session beer if you really wanted to get sloshed but not real often. Terrific, unique stuff."
"One hell of a brew."
"Poured chilled into a wide mouth wine glass. Without getting near the glass I can already smell alcohol and slight sugary malt notes. No head, and the hue of the brew is a murky cola color. Upon taking a proper whiff this smells like a strong bock beer. The alcohol isn't cutting through as much as I thought, but the malt certainly is. I smell some kind of fruit dipped in alcohol. It's refreshing and pleasant. Decent amount of carbonation cuts through my pallet. Notes of sugar and dark fruit are present with an alcoholic after taste that almost reminds of of cough syrup, but in a good way. Perfect for sipping. There's more carbonation than I would like, but what can I do? At 12% this is a great beer to take your time with, you'll definitely only need one of these."
"Thick cloudy dark brown brew, no light passes through the center of the glass and only a glimmer around the edges. This even though the glass is not very wide. Thin white head clings heavily. Nose is gigantically thick and sweet, a ton of dried fig and raisin, then banana, bread, nuts. Taste is thick, syrupy, sweet, very creamy, flavors same as the nose. It is cloyingly sweet, but what do you expect?! Alcohol is mostly hidden but still felt a bit. There's a mixed hop bite to balance the sweetness a bit, but it doesn't do much more than take the edge off of it. Some peppery alcohol develops as it warms in my hand. Huge, thick, sweet... very tasty and very filling."
"This is one fantastic beer, quite easily one of my favorite Germans. Well worth trying."
"A classic and a keeper, glad I found a bottle in the fridge."
"TRY IT!"
"Hazy apricot brown with quickly receding sandy head. With the nose I'm getting clove, booze, rum raisin, banana, and some bubblegum. Taste is about what I expected, exactly like a concentrated Aventinus. I'm sorry to say, however, that in this case, making the beer stronger did not make it better. The problem is that some of the subtleties of Aventinue now have to wrestle with an almost overpowering booze note. It comes through as hot, even though this bottle is probably about 7 months old. Flavors, though, are clove, banana, rum raisin, and toasted malts. It's clean and nice, though too hot. Prickly feel, I really wish this was a bit smoother. The hotness subsides a bit as the drink goes on, but still give me regular Aventinus."
"Very drinkable despite the heavy malt character. Alcohol exerts itself at the end but isn't boozy at all. Luscious and enjoyable."
"D - The high ABV and the rich taste makes this a beer that you need to take your time to enjoy and don't drink to often, but when you do you will really enjoy it."
"Drinkability -- I've always been curious about this handsome purple bottle. Glad I finally pulled the trigger. It's rich with dark fruits, earthy yeast and spice, and paired with the fluffy mouthfeel it makes for a satisfying beer."
"Reviewed from my notes, based on a cask pour into my Uprising Chalice at Novare Res' Schneider event. The beer is a plain brown, opaque liquid. It has a big tan foam head. The beer is too dark to see within it, but I can see bubbles popping on the top of the head, so I imagine there is some rising carbonation. It has a toasted caramel and toffee aroma. Perhaps a better way to explain it would be to call it caramelized sugar. There are alcohol and oak notes in the nose as well. It's very appealing. This si a strong, bready beer. It has a fine wheat taste. It also has some dark fruit flavors, like plum or fig. There is also a little bit of caramel sweetness and alcohol to round things out. It has a heavy body and low levels of carbonation. There is some mouth coat, but it is not excessive. There is a good burn in the finish, as one would expect from the ABV. Overall, it feels like an intensified beer, but maybe that is because I know it is an eisbock. Considering the strength of this one, it is very drinkable. I wouldn't order too many rounds, but I could certainly enjoy a few glasses over a long period. Don't let the ABV scare you off, this is a fine beer that is worth trying."
"D-good beer overall. I would drink this beer again. Seems like the perfect beer to cap off a night of drinking."
"Tasty and complex - not an easy drinker, and the 12% packs a wallop."
"D - Drinkable brew but one that should be sipped rather slowly this brew didn't do much for me. I wouldn't seek this brew out again, happy with just the one"
"Drinkability: Given the ABV of this beer it is rather smooth and unabrasive. Definitely should not be consumed too quickly."
"(D)- An interesting and fascinating beer. Its already 4yrs old, but it could hang out for another 4 yrs with how potent this bad boy is. Malty as hell, with a good sweetness. One of these is plenty for me; this is so rich and filling. A slow sipper definitely"
"D - This is a very complex beer that one must bow to. A must try but a sipper none the less."
"Picked this up, based on the recommendations of the authors of The Naked Pint. So glad I tried it, outstanding beer. Smooth, warm and intense all at the same time. Appearance: dark brown, reddish, very little head or lacing. Feel: almost syrupy and thick, maybe slightly viscous but the alcohol taste pushes through so it's not overly sickly sweet. Taste: cloves, bananas, malt, dark fruits, definitely can taste the alcohol but not in an obnoxious way. Smell: bananas, cloves, dark fruit. Drinkability: I probably wouldn't want more than one of these in a setting, due to the high alcohol content but I'll definitely have an occasional one for a special treat."
"O: Very rich and complex. Never had a beer like this and I like what they did here. More a weizen than a bock to be sure, but elements enough of both styles to be worth trying."
"A very dark burnt amber color with a thick fizzy off white head. A fair amount of sediment stuck at the bottom of the bottle, which is pretty tough to pull up and adds a light brown haze cloud to the glass. Smells very malty and grassy with a fruity alcohol aroma. Taste is great. Malty like a wheat beer and malty like a bock. A sharp oily sting covers my pallet. Cheers."
"Overall, this brew is a classic and is wonderful, heavenly, outstanding, etc. If you can age a few bottles - do it; I've had this at 4 yrs and it was noticabley better."
"Overall - Once again, Aventinus is the true king of beers"
"D: A contemplative effort for sipping, the flavour is very good and well worth the price for fans of Aventinus."
"D: Considering what this is, it ends up being a very nice sipper."
"D- Really complex beer; I read that this is just a higher ABV version of Aventinus weizenbock, but I must say I don't agree. The complexity is awesome; making for a really enjoyable beer."
"This might be a nice nightcap and good example of the style (actually a Weizen-Eisbock, not a lager Eisbock), but I think I'd rather drink normal Aventinus."
"Drinkability: extremely drinkable, especially considering its monstrous 12% ABV. I am really enjoying this one."
"D= A tasty brew for me and you. This is a decent beer by all means. The alcohol makes itself evident in the belly however. I may toss a few of these away to see what it does but it's by no means bad."
"D: Strong- this is a sipper but a very good beer nonetheless"
"Pours a reddish-brown colour with thick off-white head. Smells of cherries and heavy malt sweetness. I can notice some of the alcohol in the taste, but not too much. For 12% abv, this hides the alcohol ridiculously well. It tastes of cherries and brown sugar, with the sweet malt. It is quite smooth and easy to drink, which could be dangerous at this abv."
"M: Above medium body, tiny bubbles of carboration."
"Seek out and buy a case."
"D: The alcohol content is rather well hidden so this beer is relatively easy to drink but is better to be sipped."
"One of my all time favorite beers, this is to wheat beer what Westy is to Belgians, a world class beer all the way around."
"Drinkability is in my opinion hampered by the high ABV, but to be expected from an EISBOCK. If you're not expecting to get much done after the sitting-- enjoy a few bottles. I'm going to hunt for a few more of this delectable libation."
"This is a hearty beer and the alcohol is a bit to much for my taste. It will take me a while to finish this one..."
"D: Great for the alcohol content. I could have several it wasn't for the ""getting me too drunk"" factor."
"Smooth, full bodied...and creamy! Wow, this has a great mouthfeel. Booze definitely hits late, but hard. Has a very warm slide down the throat. Big collaboration of honey, toffee, and fruits...although, I'm having trouble picking out the exact fruits. Overall, through the syrup like texture, it's mostly sweet and malty...no real bitterness to speak of, and definitely a great eisbock!"
"Enjoying a rare gravity keg, aged, verison of this beer at Maxs in Baltimore. It pours a hazy, thick, light chocolate brown body and off white creamy head. Smells of bananas, and sour funk mostly. Tastes of mild malt at first, followed by sweet banana, and a mellow hint of alcohol. The real flavor comes at the end where the sour funk and acidity hit you taste buds instead of hopps. The funk is not bad though, think of a mild lambic or farmhouse sasion. This of it this way, the beer still has balance, close to perfect balance when you concider the alcohol and sour funk flavors goin on. Mouthfeel is smooth from the natural cask. Drinkability is average for a beer of this style. This is a pint or two type of beer, not an all night'er."
"Drinkability - at 12%, not going to throw back 5 or six of these (plus too expensive for that anyways), but this one that i'm sitting back and enjoying is truly a pleasure, you wouldn't know that this beer checks in at 12%ABV"
"Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, really syrupy and cloying, I usually dont have a problem with that if the beers massiveness can balance it out, but I dont get that here."
"D - Are you kidding? Palate and liver killer. One is nice, though."
"D- (non-session) I would enjoy having this beer anytime. It is balanced and eisbocks are what helped get me into the game of craft beer. Mmm such nice grape flavors and complexities. Seek out if you have not tried it."
"pours a dark, ruby red/brown with a quickly dissipating tan head that flows like a waterfall in my bud's pilsner. the smell is sweet prunes and lots of ruby port. liquorice, alcohol, and lots of plums overwhelm the nose with a sugary sweetness with faint backrounds with soft english malt. the taste starts with a coating grape tartness that engulfs the mouth in a syrup like manner. high alcohol warmth, banana, dark rum, and caramel spices. probably an after dinner sipper in my opinion because of the high ABV, heavy mouthfeel, and sugary maltiness, but still a great treat. thanks tippebrewcrew2."
"D: This is a really great beer. I put some bottles in my cellar - I think it will be even better in a couple of years."
"Kinda dirty rusty brown color with a pretty thin off white head. Smells of raisins, alcohol, plums, and banana...sweet and boozy. Taste is much the same except that I get some clove in the taste that was missing in the aroma. No hop presence can be detected. Lots of sweet doughy, sugary malts. This is just too sweet for me. Nice thickness and the feel is quite smooth going down. It's just sweet to the point of overkill."
"D: Very hot beer. I would like to taste this one with a few years on it. Fresh though, one is plenty for me."
"Drinkability: Really interesting. Pretty complex flavors and smell. Hot though-- the boozy, solventy aspects get to be a little much. A good one to share--12%. I'm going to cellar one."
"Nice head on this one with strong aroma of raisins and alcohol. Mouthfeel is really great--it's thick like a cough syrup, in a good way. Great winey aftertaste, too. Doesn't have the spice and clove flavors of Schneider Aventinus, but it tastes like a condensed version of that beer. Thick and glorious."
"This beer contains so much that it needs to be savored by it's own."
"D: This is fantastic. The mixture of flavours are well balanced. I could drink this plenty of times. Tastes like the non eis version but with more pronounced flavours and hotter."
"D: A very interesting brew. Very concentrated and bold flavors."
"For a strong and potent beer this was very drinkable. A very enjoyable sipping beer overall, I'm looking forward to exploring the style of Eisbock after this one. My only complaint was that it was a little too sweet for me, almost cloying to my palate. I thought it exhibited some very complex flavours but after a while the sweetness was just overloading my buds."
"Drinkability: Best with a meal - the alcohol gets noticeable after awhile, but it doesn't hurt this sipping beer. I think it like the original better, but this was an enjoyable brew. I do wonder how this beer would have been if I had gotten more of the sediment in, but if the whole purpose of this beer is the fact that it's frozen off the original, then maybe having the sediment out is best."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with above carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's very delicious but the alcohol is noticeable making it a little less drinkable. Overall a very good tasting and smelling beer. It could have had a little better head retention and a little less carbonation in my opinion, but still an excellent beer."
"Overall Impression: This beer is essentially a concentrated version of Aventinus Weizenbock. The flavor is intense and the incredible finish just keep going and transforming. Seriously, I did not think it could get any better than their Weizenbock, but I stand corrected. Hey, sometimes it feels good to be wrong ;)"
"Pours a very deep brown color, completely opaque, with a strong medium sized brown head. (I'll probably use the word strong quite a few more times during this review.) A very tight nose at first of concentrated malt sweetness slowly opens up to reveal strong notes of rich raison/prune fruits, alcohol and some clovey spice. Not even the slightest 'off' aromatic or flavor component from the age, not even much in the way of oxidation actually. Flavors of nutty dark bread, raison, plum, banana, cinnamon sugar and tobacco, pretty high complexity here. You are reminded instantly of the high ABV, very warming and well, strong. Excellent stuff however, extremely well made and pretty drinkable for its size. Worth trying, especially with some age on it."
"I am really kicking myself for having missed this on cask when it showed up in the area."
"Personally I enjoy this version over the standard version due to the concentrated taste. Of all the qualities this is what stands out the most for me. Prost!"
"D: My first Eisbock and a very nice, classic German brew, exactly what I wanted. This style is definitely a close cousin of the Weizenbock, but it's a little less robust due to it being a Lager. A good spicey brew for a nice autumn/ winter day, a classic which deserves a reco."
"Ages as well as any barleywine and provides an excellent alternative for slow sipping."
"This is a strong beer in every sense: smell, taste and ABV. So intense and delicious. I've tried this back-to-back with regular Aventinus and remember preferring the original, though this is still an awesome brew. I will definitely be buying this again."
"Cheers!"
"D-a very huge tasting beer, but this beer is orgasmically delicious very drinkable minus the abv which is the only deterent i personally wouldn't mind taking the risk if i was able to buy cases of it at a time i highly recommend you try it"
"Drinkability: I like other eisbocks I have tried better. I do like the banana and lat flavor but the alcohol is a bit too harsh here for me to want another. Very boozy and complex, but just a bit much for me."
"A beer to be reckoned with, 500ml of 12% beer can take you for a whirl - part way through the pint you notice the warming. A nightcap for sure and with the high level of sweetness I'm not sure if I can really rate it very high on the drinkability scale. I imagine some time in the cellar would smooth this one out a bit."
"4/10/10 edit. So lucky to be here at Max's for their last gravity fed keg of this nectar. This particular keg is very fresh, and the head retention is spectacular. It's a creamy, milky looking head, looking more akin to the foam on a latte. Lacing is likewise very nice... considering this was gravity fed, I was greatly impressed by this beer's appearance. Always an excellent beer, out of gravity feed keg it's nearly mindblowing."
"D - Decent. The alcohol isn't all that well hidden. After having this a second time, I like it a bit less than the first time. Not something I'll actively seek out again."
"Really enjoyable but whoa! Between the sugars & the ABV, I kind of wish I'd split even this 12 oz. bottle with someone."
"Drinkability - Very inviting and rewarding when you sip slowly to enjoy the complexities. A testament to what can be accomplished through the brewer's art."
"Victory!"
"Overall an enjoyable beer and one I'd recommend to those who for some reason think wheat beer is 'girly'."
"This stuff is good when used as jet fuel, but excellent when used as beer. I'm only 1/4 of the way done with my glass, and I am already feeling it. I don't see myself picking this up regularly, but as a one off when I'm in the mood it is right on target."
"I don't know what to say. This beer is intense, making it difficult for me to fully embrace it... yet it's rough character and unique taste are well matched to the 12% alcohol content. I beleive I would try this beer again, perhaps in a different glass."
"A nicely souped-up version of the regular Aventinus, but I really don't think its as well-rounded as the regular Weisse or Aventinus. Its a lot more intense in flavour, but becomes boozy to quickly and seems too brash and rough in comparison to its lighter brethren, and more refined eisbocks like Kulmbacher's."
"I first experienced this beer at the Schneider Haus in Munich in '06, and then bought 2 cases of it at the Specs Warehouse in Houston, TX upon my return. Finding and experiencing the delectability of the Eisbock remains one of the highlights of my beer-drinking life! (I'm a little curious as to why it wasn't ranked in the top 100, though..)"
"poured a deep reddish mahogany from the cask into a 12oz tulip. Smells of spicy banana and some alcohol. Taste is very similar to the bottled version with the alcohol being a little more apparent which could just be a temperature issue. Lots of banana and spice. For 12% this is very smooth and drinkable. The abv is noticeable, but not unpleasant. I feel very lucky to have this on cask. top notch wheat beer from schneider as usual."
"Will give this one another go-around at a later point in time to see how my palate has changed and if the alcohol will still try to punch it into submission."
"Grabbed this one cause I've loved the Aventinus weizenbock every time I've had it. This was, as advertised, just a bigger, stronger version of that. Deep maroon-amber color with a small head and a touch of lacing. Huge syrupy brew - lots of fruit, molasses, caramel, and maybe a whiff of hops. Overall, it was good, but maybe in the liqueur department more than the beer department. I'd definitely have it again, but it was just a little too much, so I'll probably stick to the normal weizenbock when I'm buying."
"On a side note, I didn't finish the last few ounces of the bottle. Not because it was a ""drain-pour", as some say, because it certainly wasn't, but because the sediment kicked up into the glass. Normally this wouldn't bother me, particularly for a Weizenbock, but the sediment wasn't the cloudy haze you normally see, it was very solid and chunky (probably due to the age), which was really unappetizing. Not a fault of the brewer, so I didn't factor it into the scoring, but something to consider if you see an older bottle of this Eisbock."
"D: Despite the relatively high alcohol content, the beer is very drinkable. A great mix of flavors and a very enticing aroma. I would gladly drink this one again and seek out some more eisbocks."
"Very nice, definitely worth a try."
"D – Very strong, so not a daily drinker, but it is still a delicious desert wine, errr… Eisbock."
"I'd never had a weizen eisbock before, and only one weizenbock, so I didn't quite know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised though at the taste of this beer. It has dessert wine characteristics to it's flavor. While I don't believe I will become a huge fan of Aventinus Eisbock (just too many other options out there), I did enjoy it greatly."
"D: I wish this beer was more readily available. I could drink the Aventinus line for a very, very long time."
"Going back to the LCBO to get a few more for cellaring. An excellent winter brew, glad I picked it up. Just loved drinking this beer. First rate, and my first A+ brew on BA!"
"500ml bottle pours a dark black brown with a generous amount of foam lacing the duvel glass. Smell is of sweet dark fruits. The taste is of dark fruits with this slight tingle to it. The abv% is well hidden considering the 12%. Never had a beer of this style, and its quite interesting. Don't think you would figure out it was 12% without knowing. Interesting brew."
"Like Aventinus' Weizenbock, it never disappoints, and has few peers...a superior ""winter warmer"" which perfectly punctuates the Solstice."
"D- Slightly boozy and warming. This beer is very rich and complex, a very nice sipper."
"I like this. I really like this. I love wheat beers and Belgian Strong Dark Ales and this has a bit of both going on. But, honestly, other than the two I bought on top of this to cellar, I don't think I'll come back to this one too often. The regular Aventinus is absolute perfection--and 8.2% ABV is more than enough to get me buzzed. This one falls into the category of too much of a good thing."
"From tasting notes 12/01/09"
"Overall, one of the best deals at the piss-poor LCBO for $3.95 for a 500mL bottle, will definitely pick up a bunch more to enjoy and a few to cellar as well... as I think a bit of time to round out some of the astringent alcohol qualities of it would do wonders"
"Overall, this is a really good beer, but not as good as the original when fresh. I'm sure with some age on it it would be perfect."
"Surprisingly drinkable. I mean, really, it's 12% or so and the alcohol is well-hidden, mostly present through some warming in the belly. Great, great beer."
"What a great beer, superb. I find it hard to believe ints 12% as i can not really taste that high of an alcohol content."
"Thanks to Phyl21ca for sending me this about 18 months ago!"
"It pours creamy and dark and right from the start, you know you are dealing with as serious brew. The nose is clove, spice, and sweetness, harknening back to its German wheat roots. Its flavor profile has clove, banana, and a variety of other flavors that make this complex, but not muddled, bold but not over powering. While this is no denying an alcohol presence, it is felt more in the core than in the mouth. Truly, this is an exceptional beer that should be savored."
"D - Whoa - where did this beer go? I want more, but one is probably a good number for this one."
"Drinkability: I really like the flavors, but I think I prefer the standard offering to the iced version as it's not nearly as hot and I felt I could focus more on the flavors and not be distracted by the higher ABV (which comes with a pretty significant punch, me thinks)."
"Overall this was more buttery than I remembered but not in a bad way. A very unique beer and one that's well worth a shot."
"D: Although this beer is quite smooth, it has some very strong flavors that I'm not enjoying all that much. It's not a bad beer, just not to my liking."
"I had this beer out of a St. Bernhard flute glass a couple months back and I remember really loving it. Out of the oversized wine glass, I was a bit disappointed."
"It's very strong, not something to drink a lot of - rather logical since it's 12% ABV - a good thing to sip a little of, but, although it has a good, interesting, firm character, it lacks complexity and well-roundedness."
"Notes: A malt heavy beer with a good level of spice. The mouthfeel thanks to the carbonation was also very good. Maybe the high level of carbonation muted the flavor a little."
"Very boozy with strong flavors. Hard to be more drinkable at this ABV. None the less, this beer is outstanding. Unique style and a must try for beer lovers."
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a bit too much carbonation sting, but I wouldn't expect anything different from this style. Drinkability is very high despite the monstrous ABV...this one is definitely a sipper but it is one that I want to keep reaching for over and over. Awesome beer, worth a try for sure."
"I'll definitely be getting some to cellar for a year or two."
"D: this is a must try for anyone that wants to see the extreme side of the hefe. All the same flavors are here, they've just been amplified. Worth seeking out."
"All in all, a very good beer. This beer works as an excellent nightcap."
"Overall, this is a very good take on a weisse beer. I'm not the greatest fan of weissebiers but this was very enjoyable. Pretty complex and tasty, would definitely recommend."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Duvel tulip. Bottle number 2007/14259 indicated on the back label. Poured the color and consistency of cola with a 1.5 inch sizzling and popping head that gradually recedes into a broken, sudsy cap (no lacing) - big clumps of floaties present in the solution (maybe I should have decanted this first). Nose is fairly vinous, with some additional dark fruits in the background and perhaps a hint of chocolate (this seemed more prevalent in the nose). Taste consistent with nose but a little booze also comes out - not as boozy as I anticipated though. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and sparklingly effervescent with a little bit of residual heat. Pretty drinkable considering the abv - somewhat reminiscent of a Quad IMO; however, this is my first eisbock. I have to say that I am intrigued and look forward to sampling more of this style."
"D: For 12% alcohol I'm impressed."
"It's recommended, if you've never had it. It could become your new dessert beer, if nothing else."
"Compared to the regular Aventinus, I like the concentrated spice, malt and fruit flavors in this, but not the concentrated solvent and alcohol flavors, plus it lost some balance along the way. Still, I enjoyed it."
"12% is barely noticeable - i'd have rated it ~6% by taste alone. tastes great. strong kick is not for guzzling, but could sip this all night."
"Alcohol will get you, but won't hit you, no, you will be laid down caressed by invisible weightless hand."
"O: Great beer. I need to pick some more of these up and put them to bed."
"A (no doubt!)"
"Notes: I am blown away. Again, to take a world class beer and actually improve on it? Incredible. This was one expensive beer, about $0.42 per ounce but it is worth every penny. Everyone reading this should seek out and try Aventinus Eisbock. Prost!"
"Pours a two-fingered light tan head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Cloudy brown/amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty dark fruit nose. Flavor is sweet raisins and alcohol, a very unusual eisbock. $5.10 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Definitely a sipper, something unique that is very well crafted."
"Well for a beer of this strength, it still remains fairly drinkable."
"Bottle dated 2008 with number 16584. Poured a reddish dark brown with no head and a lot of big chunks of yeast in it. Smells of bananas, cloves, bubblegum, and alcohol. A lot of malt and spice in the flavor. Some caramel, chocolate, a lot of toffee. Clove. Mouthfeel is lighter in body than I would have expected, but very creamy. Some slickness to it. Drinkability is good, especially for 12% alcohol."
"Pours a clear dark reddish brown, with a thin tan head. Smell is strongly of alcohol and raisins. Taste is fruit like malt flavors up front, a toffee middle, and alcohol and a hint of earthy bitterness in the finish. Dry, mouth-puckering finish. You can really taste the alcohol in this one. Mouthfeel is very rich, low carbonation. Drinkability is where this beer looses its marks. After having about 1/3 of the beer, it starts to get a bit cloying and the alcohol really starts to shine through. This is a very good beer, don't get me wrong, but the alcohol does really shine through on this one, which makes it a bit rough drinking the whole beer. I like normal Aventinus better."
"Dark chestnut brown, slight ruby tint, cloudy from the yeast, frothy tan head that quickly fades to a thick tan ring of bubbles. Not much lacing, but not much expected. Aroma smells like weizenbock, with a pinch of alcohol. Strong notes of yeast, banana, clove, strong dark fruit, and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy and fluffy, high carbonation. Flavor is dominated by sweet caramel, and banana and clove weizen notes. Every taste is a combination of new flavors, honey, rum, chocolate, dark fruit, bread, other spices, etc. Alcohol is also well hidden in the taste, but still provides a strong warming presence. Finish is very soft and smooth, not as sweet as in the beginning of the drink, but still a rich combination of flavors. A nice sipper/night cap, extremely sweet and boozy, to some this might barely resemble a ""beer"""
"Alcohol is not as evident in the taste as the smell. Overall the flavor gets a little overwhelming after a while, which hurts the drinkability. However, mouthfeel seems perfect. Still amazed how much the 12% is supressed."
"Bottled 02-2008, drank 11-08. Entire bottle poured into a 22oz snifter. Murky chestnut, tiny head dissipates to a small fuzzy ring with little patches floating about. Interesting sweet aroma of grapey-bubblegum, cola, and clove. Alcohol is noticeable but not bad or stinging, more of a warmth. It drinks with a soft mouthfeel, and finishes clean and medium sweet. The flavors echo the aroma, but grow more complex as the beer warms. Starts out showing caramel cola, figs, brandy and a light bitterness. As it warms the caramel character becomes lightly smokey, hints of brown bread, raisins, dried cherries and bitter orange come forward. Very interesting and complex beer, drinks well enough, although a little sweet and the alcohol is nothing to sneeze at."
"Absolutely amazing! If this beer were a woman I would have sex with it."
"When poured, the color was a dark brown, brown is what I didn't expect. You don't see a brown ale and the foam is a off white or cream in color. The smell was of spices. Nice pleasant aroma with a touch of roasted malts, wheat and a touch of yeast. The taste of spices, wheat, malts and a soft type of fruit was evident. There is a great balance of all the components that make this ale one of the best Weizen-eisbock's. This is another winner!"
"Big rich body, moderately high carbonation, higher than I'd expect, but the flavour profile is so huge that this doesn't impact too much."
"Overall - This is one of the best smelling and tasting beers in the world, but unfortunately it cannot be called the best beer in the world due to minor weaknesses in other areas. Still, anyone who likes wheat beers and beers over 8% ABV absolutely must try Aventinus Weizen Eisbock. It is absolutely amazing."
"Delicious, but I doubt I'll have more than one. Definately a sipper to sit around and enjoy for a while."
"This is virtually 3 beers in one. A bottle of this size is enough to give a pretty calming buzz. Despite that I honestly don't feel the drinkability is as low as most other beers in this ABV range."
"Final thoughts: This is a very big beer, lots of deep rich fruits even grapes, slight sour yeasty taste, lots of alcohol, slow drinker but good taste"
"[1x]"
"Overall, a well done beer for such a high ABV. Not one I would want in multiples or frequently, but a good sipper to sit down with and enjoy occasionally. I'll take the regular Aventinus for a day-to-day basis."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, even at 12% with the burn."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle #25963 bottled in 2008. Nearly opaque reddish dark brown, cola like head. Smell: intensely malty, overripe plum, dry-sweet pear smell, caramel, spice, hints of clove and overripe banana, a little wheat malt to balance the sweetness. Taste: dark and bready like a very sweet pumpernickel with dates. Caramel, a touch of alcohol that incorporates an anise flavor, yeasty, wheat tang, clove spice. Tastes like a pumped up Aventinus but with banana present only in a sweet overripe flavor and feel at the end of the sip. Slightly past medium bodied with active carbonation, drying, with a sticky finish. Considering the alcohol this is just as drinkable as Aventinus. This is the only eisbock I've been able to get a hold of, and as an Aventinus fan this is a nice novelty and of course quite tasty, I could see grabbing this to try alongside an Aventinus in the winter months."
"D: Complex beer where the taste is often overshadowed by the strength of the alcohol."
"This is a great beer, but I couldn't drink this often. One, this one bottle gave me a good buzz, and two, honestly I'd rather have the normal Aventinus."
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with chunky sediment and quickly dissipating tan head. It smelled like dark chocolate covered raspberries and molasses and heavy honey wheat bread, with a bit of alcohol. It tasted like dark chocolate and raisins and honey wheat bread, with some rich molasses or caramel, and a bit of cherry and sour yeast and alcohol. It was fairly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a great scent, taste, and body. It was very complex and bold, and had noticeable alcohol. So this is definitely more of a sipping beer. But age will clearly mellow it out and perhaps make the flavors even richer. At that point, this beer will go from being great to being top 50. I can't wait!"
"Why did I only buy one?? Why?"
"D- Judging by the alcohol content, I'd call this a ""heavyweight", but judging by the pallet, I'd say I could enjoy at least two of these bottles in a sitting. Despite the fact that this is a ""big"" beer, I'd say it's quite drinkable!"
"taste is tangy, sour malt, nuts, spice, and a little bit of fruit, end is somewhat bitter."
"D- the 12% ABV is not to noticeable which is nice"
"Poured dark brown/black with a 2 finger tan head. Short-lasting, leaving a beautiful little galaxy-shaped film of head on top. Spicy aroma of cloves, bread, apples, and other ripe fruits. Later hints of caramel and malt come to the nose. Texture holds a semi-thick mouthfeel similar to a Belgian quad. Tastes are surprisingly similar as well. Flavor accents of malts and cherries, as well as some cloves and banana. Sweet without being cloying, with a nice dry finish. Delicious! A very smooth and drinkable beer."
"With a nice cool day for once in my neck of the woods, it was nice to take some time and appreciate this monster for what it is: meant to be drunk on cool days and warm you up. The alcohol isn't masked, so it's easy not to overdo it, I suppose..."
"-edit had another fresher one and the appearance and smell were fabulous, it is great either way, aged or not."
"For a 12% brew, this is very easy to drink. Multiples would be hard pressed but as a sipping beer, this is a-ok."
"Bottle number 2008/03808 poured into a 0,3L Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock glass. Lovely dark brown color with an orange colored hue when held to light. Consistent carbonation feeds a 3 finger head; some floaties bobbing in there as well. Nose is malt, clove, banana, caramel, and toffee. Looks and smells delicious. Taste is rich malts, caramel again, no hops, dark fruit. Creamy texture with ample carbonation. The beer definitely gets better as it warms. Alcohol is masked completely other than the light head you'll likely get by the time you're done with it. I'll buy some more and plan to cellar this one."
"I'm amazed that Aventinus Weizen Eisbock is only the third beer of this style that I've ever reviewed. While it isn't a sock knocker-offer like Kuhnhenn Raspberry Eisbock, it's a damn good beer that is fun to sip and savor. It's also widely available and cellars well. I'll be coming back to this one again."
"Had beer at beer fest in Seattle, poured into Four Ounce glass. It was poured out of a pitcher, I am not sure why it was in a pitcher and didn't come out of a tap or a bottle. It felt a little flat, didn't have a bad mouth feel, but it wasn't really one that I totally appreciated. I liked the taste, it had a good taste from what I could tell, perhaps I should try it in the bottle form from the local place and give it another look. I will look for this at world market in the future."
"Very pleasant winters beer, brought back from a Berlin beer trip, glad I found it."
"D - The only downside because it is VERY substantial and you will feel the alcohol - a 150ml bottle would be optimal"
"Drinkability is this one's only weak point. The flavors are rich and intense, and the alcohol has a potent bite to it that makes this one a fantastic sipper that should be treated with care and caution."
"Hardly any carbonation, but just enough to scrub the palate after each sip. This beer is like a tasty port but with the mouthfeel and drinkability of a good beer. The clean finish and lack of high complexity make this beer dangerously drinkable! I keep wanting more after each sip."
"This beer pours a dark reddish brown with a big fizzy head that quickly disappears into nothing and leaves minimal lacing. The bottom of the glass has small chunks of yeast that would of been larger had i not swirled the the last few ounces before pouring. The smell has a medicinal aroma with ester and alcohol. Tastes of smooth and creamy malt flavors with clove, cinnamon and banana. The mouthfeel has a medium body with lots of carbination and a smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability is good although I could not see myself drinking more than one due to the high abv and price."
"overall, this was an enjoyable beer"
"drinkability is very good but 1 will be plenty for me for a few months"
"Drinkability - Very good drinkability, but the alcohol is too high to be a session beer."
"I could not drink many in a sitting, but I will definitely return."
"Perhaps, I would argue, this beer is most suitable for the winter months. I could imagine being housebound with only a few bottles of this strong stuff, with a the blizzard roaring outside, and not a care in world. On the other hand, this beer does just fine on this rainy June day."
"This is one expensive ass 11.2 oz bottle! Never had an eisbock, so here was my chance...was slighly flustered by the fractured looking yeast cake that made it into my bottle. Was thinking infection...this one must have been in the warehouse a WHILE (the cap left rust dents on the bottle lip)...Anyways, after checking to see if this was normal and I wasn't going to die, damn. This is one heavy beer. I was slightly buzzed earlier in the day, but this brought me right on back. Heavy in every taste imaginable, although not hoppy. Very syrupy and boozy (WHICH is the point!). You can still taste the wheat through it all. Impressive beer, but, I couldn't even finish it. I love me some big beers, and maybe I just didn't want to get drunk, but you wouldn't taste a bud light for 5 hours after having this. Or want to..."
"D - Pretty tasty but also very serious at 12%. A little goes a long way. I would like to try this with some age on it as the alcohol burn would certainly subside a bit."
"Weizen-Eisbock is good beer. There's no question about that. I like it quite a bit. It has a nice, deep flavor and is solid all-around. The high abv is the obvious thing that holds it back. It's just too much and hurts the overall experience to a degree. Personally, I think this beer would be a tremendous success at 9% or 10% and would still fit within the Eisbock style guidelines. As it is, it's just a little too boozy and warm. Having said that, the flavor still manages to succeed. It's an easy recommendation, but I can see it being a little better with a tweak or two."
"A half-liter bottle poured into my standard snifter. Appears a rich, dark crimson brown color with about a finger of off white head. The foam ebbs within seconds settling to a very thin layer. Nose and flavor are of caramelized bananas, figs, raisins, cherries, brown sugar, chocolate, and cloves. Rich, syrupy and full bodied with light, but ample carbonation for the style. Tasty stuff, worth seeking out."
"A masterpiece of brewing, I will remember this in old age and smile."
"theres more carbination then I would have guessed, the beer jumps all over your mouth. I get some dark fruit flavors, date maybe? Definetly a spicey characteristic as well, cloves, pepper, and tobacco. This is a very good beer and highly drinkable at something like 12%. It has a syrupy after feel, but one is rewarded with each new sip."
"Bottle from 2005. Pours a cloudy brown with a small, off-white head. It has a strong smell of alcohol and clove and secondary smells of soy sauce and cheese. Wasn't thrilled about the soy sauce and cheese aspects. Tastes of pepper, spice, clove and banana and bubblegum."
"Overall Impression - Not a very often seen style. Easily drinkable, but the with the level of alcohol and the flavors not being as prominent, it would not be something that I would regularly search out."
"Fairly biased to the sweet side, but easily drinkable. Only gives off a hint of the 12% alcohol."
"D: Not a multi beer kind of beer... One is the right amount. Sit back and enjoy this one.. Complex and strong."
"D: It's an interesting idea, but in the end, it was way too big for me. I didn't come close to finishing the bottle. If I'm going to have this in the future, I'm going to have to split it with three or four people."
"This is a big, BIG beer. It falls short of its little brother, the regular Aventinus, being less drinkable but no more complex. Still a great beer, and one I will be drinking again."
"D: Not the most drinkable extra strong beer, but it is drinkable enough, provided you don't have more than a bottle at once (maybe 1.5-2 max)."
"very thin head that settled to an island in the middle of my Le Merle goblet. tastes of dried pomegranate with alcohol and a hint of banana and dried fruit up front. sweet with a slight sour aftertaste and alot of malti-sweetness. a unique ale that i would have again, but definately after a meal and perhaps paired with a rich dark chocolate desert."
"I finished this beer and enjoyed it to the end, but it had a pretty strong and lingering effect on me well after it was gone. Approach this one with respect."
"Drinkability: At 12% ABV there will only be one a night of these but each sip is smooth, sweet, and leads on to another. The warmth of the alcohol spreads gradually but is soon felt."
"Good drinkability marks. It went down easily, and without any argument from me. I later got some more to use in a chili I was making."
"D: Very drinkable for its 12% ABV. However, you'd be well advised not to have too many."
"Awesome beer."
"D = Not an everyday drink but great for a nightcap after a heavy meal. A must have. Easily one of the best beers I have ever had."
"All in all, this beer is a must-try for any fan of Aventinus and for 90% of wheat beer fans in general. Highly recommended, if not required!"
"Beer poured a burgundy brown with no head. Very thick beer as light does not pass thru. Nose is heavy on the dark fruits, very wine like. Taste is plums and currants, finishing with light hops. Mouthfeel is full, pretty smooth, with no carbonation. Drinkability is dangerously good. Alcohol is not present when sipping but I am gradually warming as I partake. This is an outstanding beer that must be tried if you are a wine and beer lover!"
"Notes: This beer is big, bold, and beautiful."
"The is a reasonably drinkable beer. It is fairly strong in alcohol and taste which limits it to a certain extent. If you like dopplebocks, this is definitely worth trying and enjoying."
"D: a bit of a sipper, very good, wouldn't typically expect these flavors coming from a lager...age probably served this well"
"Love me a big bold boozy beer, but there are times when the alcohol overwhelms and when it is incorporated for the good of the overall flavor. This veers toward overwhelming, though isn't at all un-enjoyable. Just a bit hot, and probably would've been 10 times better if the alcohol was a mere 9% or so."
"The normal Aventinus is great and this is a concentraded version if it, can't go wrong with that. Very good stuff!"
"D - this drank way too easily for having a 12% abv. Great beer and I will definitely drink again."
"Pours very dark brown with just a slight head forming on the pour. Smell is very dark malts, and dark fruits. Flavor is huge! Incredible mouthfeel. More dark fruits and a very good Weizen taste. Very little if any sign of the high ABV in the taste. Maybe just a little heat, but that's hard to notice. Goes down way too easy for a beer this big. Tastes great and doesn't get old at all. Very complex, very big, very good beer!"
"I don't know what to make of this. It's decently thick, not a bad beer, but frankly, it's like they took the ""normal"" version and in trying to intensify it made it worse. Too boozy."
"Velvety smooth, thick creamy mouthfeel, this beer is one of the best wheat-style beers i've had. I couldn't imagin having more than one of these in a sitting, very filling, almost like a meal in itself, not to mention the high alcohol content!"
"OVERALL: A great drinkable and enjoyable sipper. I'd like the alcohol to be a hidden a little better, but that doesn't take away from the quality of this one. Definitely one to seek out and try. Recommended."
"Mixed in the taste I pick up cherries, chocolate, grapes, root beer... maybe some other fruit in there as well. Very complex and interesting. Alcohol is not very noticeable and hidden well. I haven't really had too many of these stronger wheat beers before but this one is pretty damn good. I'll definitely check out more in the future."
"Pours a dark garnet, brown, and rust juice color. No head and there is no way to see any bubbling in this beer. Even when you hold it up to the light. The aroma makes me think of a bozey cooked fruit. Pie filling cherrie in a can that have been cooked slow, stove top, in cognac. Very dark fruity and roasted flavors. Dark cherries taste like they've been roasted in the oven in some sherry or maybe even port wine. Viey tastes and palate mix with a well tempered alcoholic warmth and dark fruits. Great sipping beer. Perfect digestive."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied with a good amount of carbonation."
"Props to Henry for expanding our horizon with this beer at our tasting. Pours brown with a nice, sizable head that fades to a clean lace. Smell is very sweet toffee and caramel with subtle flowery notes. Much more complex than other double bocks. With a sip there is an instant flood of flavor- wow. Roasted toffee and sweetness classic for the style. The yeast is detectable and adds a variation to the sweetness. However, if you weed through the huge thick sweetness you can find a very deep, ripe fruit, dark raisins, and sugary plumb lending to the beer's sophistication. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and only shows after the glass has warmed and my taste buds have acclimated but even then only at the very end of the taste. The complexity of this beer really stands out among its brothers of similar style. Very good beer"
"This is just too good. Thanks a lot Rob, for this tasty bottle."
"Too easy to drink. Tempting to chug it down, but good thing I didn't, since I'm already feeling it well before the end. Could get into trouble with these pretty easily. I don't think this beats Samiclaus in the beefed up doppelbock category. I wanted it to be something else. Not super complex. I wonder if I had decanted this one whether I would have liked it better. It wasn't quite the malt bomb I hoped for. No regrets though. Very good beer; would like to try again."
"Could drink more than one, but probably not a good idea."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown reddish color. Light tannish head - diminishing. Flowery aroma, malty & hoppy but very flowery. Some alcohol. Flowery taste, some alcohol and, fizzyness. Very good. Tastes a lot like a Belgian triple or strong ale."
"Dangerously drinkable."
"Numbered batch bottles so there may be variations from batch to batch, but worth a try to the advanced beer drinker."
"D- good. I doubt I'll have a few of these in a sitting, but I have no doubt that I will be buying this again."
"Poured into a snifter a hazy dark brown color with a smallish off white head that fell quickly leaving behind zero lacing. Aroma is lightly smokey, some raisins and mustiness. A little bit of fruitiness comes through as it warms, hints of banana and spice with some earthy, funky yeast. It almost has BSDA nose to it. Flavor is quite strong, notes of grapes, apples, bubble gum, rum soaked dark fruits, yeast, and spice. Lots of heat from the alcohol and the subsequent burn on the way down. It tastes pretty good, but the alcohol is just a bit too much for me."
"D Insidiously hides the towering ABV, I would drink several of these in a night before I start being a little too honest with my friends, and only then realize the predicament I was in."
"D= This is a big beautiful beer. Though it wasn't much to look at, the concentration of flavors was incredible. Even the huge ABV is pretty well concealed, making this more drinkable than it should be!"
"I'm guessing it might be a tad expensive(£6) but its a great example of why i'll be buried with a bottle of a schneider beer in my right hand and a BrewDog in my left!"
"Overall its a very nice, sweet sipping drink. Not too heavy and the ABV givs a boozey warmth which is detectable when it warms a bit towards room temp. All around very nice."
"This doesn't have the toasty bread, sweet malt and rich dark caramel qualities of a normal eisbock. It does, however, share the fluffy, creamy fullness and dark, spicy, fruity, (nearly refreshing) character of dunkelweizen - and that makes for a dangerous drinkability. This is presented as the original eisbock and while I can't confirm that, I can say that it is still one of the finest examples of the style (wheat based or not) that I've yet to try."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce glass into a hefeweizen glass. It pours a deep mahogany with a thin white head that leaves quickly. The aroma is phenols and alcohol. The flavor is deep molases, medicinal herbs and an overriding note of alcohol. The alcohol lingers in the finish. The beer has a full bodied chewy mouth feel. With its well hidden 12% abv the brew is a sipper. A very good beer that was nothing like I expected."
"Future outlook: Not stylistically one of my favorites, but a nice, interesting change of pace. I might get this one again to serve the same purpose sometime down the road."
"Best before date may be the 238th day of 2008, in which case this would be a bit late. Poured into a snifter, it's particulate and dark brown with fluffy pale tan head. I get a very sweet smell, apricot maybe, with just a bit of skunk, yeasty and alcoholic. I taste immediate toasty bitterness, quickly mellowing with caramel sweetness. It's pretty full bodied, carbonation still holding up with warmth. I'm not sure I've ever had a wheat dopple bock before. It's warming and sweet, although I would not say approachable. A delicious darker brew for the adventuresome palate.."
"Same as smell, starts off very and ends with subtle and nice bitterness that is very pleasing. I would jump at the chance to have a session with this beer."
"A good beer that I would gladly purchase and push on others to consume. I will be buying more of this in the future, that is for sure."
"This is a beer that will knock you on your butt if you aren't paying attention to that high abv. Poured a dark ruby color with a big head and lively carbonation. Head dissipated to a thin covering as I nursed this badboy. Smelled the typical weizen aromas and a bit of brown sugar or raisins. You get the same thing in the taste and get some real sweetness with the kick of alcohol. I could feel the alcohol more as the beer warmed while I nursed it. This Eisbock has a nice mouthfeel that has a bit of a medicinal feel to it. This Weizen-Eisbock hides the alcohol well though I still know it is there and therfore one in a sitting is more than enough for me."
"D - Amazingly decent, much better than the massive ABV might suggest."
"Notes - This is an incredibly deceptive beer. The taste belies the strong alcohol percentage. One of the best beers I have ever enjoyed, to this point."
"The head retention is short but the aroma is great - a bit boozy, sweet malt, yeasty, dark fruits, chocolate, a bit more banana bread and clove maybe... The finish has less citrus I think. Very smooth"
"Man, do I love this beer. Just when you thought Aventinus couldn't get any better, they went and froze the sucker. Who needs water, anyway? Pours a hazy dark brown with a good head from a steady pour. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is of ripe plums, raisins, sweet malt, cinnamon, blueberries, and a very little bit of alcohol. Thick and mouth-coating, pulling back just short of syrupy. Flavor is of bruised plums, braised pears, raisins, and sweet red apples. Finish is sweet and lingering, and warms as it goes down. I would never in a million years have guessed this was a 12% beer. Excellent brew."
"6/4/7/4/15 (3.6/5)"
"Overall: This is POWERFUL. I mean... WHEW. I've had some Belgian 12%'s but the alcohol wasn't nearly as noticeable. This seems like it'd do a pretty good job cleaning engines... or killing brain cells. (catch the reference?)"
"Pretty hard to drink more than one of these beasts."
"Pours dirty brown with lots of floaties and clouds. Strong off-white head that lasts. Banana bread, cane sugar, yeast, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and cake batter fill the nose. Rich, full mouthfeel and taste. Great balance between the wheat and banana / yeast esters and spice. A great winter beer."
"As my beer taste refines, I like to try new things. Enter Aventinus, as recommended by some friends. Pours with more carbonation, but settles out quickly. The nose is a bit yeasty, but very pleasant. The taste is full and immediate. The cloudy chocolate brown presentation some find a bit imposing, but after a taste, I find myself willing to want another. The taste is smooth and exotic. So many flavors come across the palate that I find my taster confused, but very pleased. It is difficult to pinpoint the flavors, but raisins and a bit of beechwood come to mind as I recall my dad breaking a branch to allow me to smell and taste the unique beechwood flavor. This is one German brew that comes up tasting like the monks of Belgium had a hand in the recipe. This brew is outstanding! It has some sweetness about it, but not like the Christmas brews. It is certainly worth a taste, especially if you enjoy the Belgian brews."
"D - A real intoxicating treat. Could easily go in place of a cordial."
"d: I struggled a little with the 11.2 ounce bottle. I'm glad to have tried this, but I'll go back to the original."
"Pours a dar, clougy brown with very small beige head. Aroma of wheat, chocolate, plum, raisin and alcohol. Stronger fruit and alcohol taste than regular Aventinus. Tastes of raisin, plum and blackberry. Nice warm alcohol presence."
"D) Good drinkability for an eisbock, The extremely alcoholic presence detracts a little bit. I wonder if cellaring would help it mellow at all. Sounds like time for an experiment"
"D: For a 12% beer this is pretty easy to drink. I can't say I would have more than one, but it does go down pretty nicely."
"Healthy body with dialed carbonation give a smooth mouthfell with a bit of tingle on the tongue in the dry finish. A very easy drinker for this rather big beer...highly recommended."
"Also of note--glassware truly makes a difference with this beer. My first time I had it in the traditional chilled Aventinus glass, and the second time was in a standard chilled pint glass. To get the full bouquet and flavor experience you need the traditional glassware."
"This one keeps me coming back for another sip. Sure it is strong, I want more."
"Drinkability suffers for obvious reasons, as the ABV is quite high and leaves a good buzz afterward. The flavors, though, call for more, even with the definite booziness of the beer. It is, overall, a very balanced brew, and probably of the most--if not the most--enjoyable Weizens I have ever enjoyed."
"Drinkability: Sip, savor, repeat. Recommend. Super sweet and grotesquely unbalanced in a rich dessert kinda way. The ABV is blended in rather well. Delightful!"
"UMAMI!!"
"Good beer to enjoy at a leisurely pace and would definitely buy again. Even for a weizenbock I was still very suprised about the large amount of yeast in the bottle. Maybe I got one of the end of the barrels. Give this a try if you can get your hands on one!"
"This is my first Eisbock on tap and it was well worth it. Went great with the pizza I was eating. Recommended."
"D- Sip this bad boy and enjoy the full flavored compelexity. I would love to try this again, given the right situation."
"I can't believe this is derived from Aventinus. I enjoyed this version so much more and it was oozing with flavor. For my first of the style maybe I'm rating it quite high with nothing to compare to, but it deserves it."
"I arrived home and poured the eisbock into a goblet. It was as the Phantom said...""tremulous and tender; hard as lighting, and soft as candlelight"". Such succulent sweetness! As if an entire school of fish of were traversing across my tongue, cascading myriad flavours to the fathoms below. Sweetnes unfolding into tartness fading away into absolute savoury perfection. Such a relief of thirst! And such a fire of warmth! I need fear not a single winter's night in the valiant arms of this faithful libation. How delightful is it to know that the nectar of the gods exists, and that you have dared to drink of it's delectable deliciousness?"
"A strong beer that looks like a barleywine and tastes like a barleywine mixed with wheat. Not to be repetitive, but this beer is a lot like a good barleywine. It's a bit sticky and a bit heavy on the alcohol, but the flavor and smell are excellent. It's sweet, spicy, malty and full of barley and wheat. There's a lot of fruitiness, mostly raisin. The full, rich flavors and smooth feel hide the alcohol as well as can be asked at 12% abv. I love Aventinus, and this beer is a bit like a barleywine version of it. That might be hard to imagine, but it's a great, big, strong beer that you can sip like a fine port. Don't let the drinkability score fool you. It's good for what it is, but I'm not going to give it a high score just because I've never had another Eisbock."
"Drinkability is very good on this beer. This beer has a ton of taste, but a lot of them balance each other out that allows one to keep drinking. This is a great beer that ends with a very warm feeling in my tummy. Great beer to warm you up on a cold night."
"D: Easy does it, and a little intense, but that's to be expected. Excellent, as long as it's taken slow."
"D- i liked the idea of a stronger flavored aventinus, but this had just too much noticeable alcohol and felt like i was sipping a glass of hard liquor. maybe this style just isnt for me. one bottle was just about more than i could stand."
"D: This is a big beer and all you need is one. It is absolutely a sipper meant to savored and enjoyed. Don't rush this one for sure. Very solid in taste and flavors. I will definitely keep some in the cellar."
"This beer has tons and tons of different smells - (fruit, flower, hops, cloves, and very well rounded). All of the smells turn into tastes when you drink it. There are aftertastes of the alcohol and a smoothness feel. Definitely have another to drink."
"Upon reading other reviews, it seems that something was off. I had zero caronation, and no yeast."
"D. While too sweet, quite enjoyable and refreshing. I will definitely revisit this one again soon."
"This is very port like. If you want to impress some wine people bring this. Very interesting and unique. Something to sip and savor when the cold winds moan outside."
"Drinkability is fairly moderate. Flavor is alright, but alcohol is quite high. Really limits the beer."
"Taste is a malt fest. Dried fruit is a little more pronounced than the smell, leaning towards raisins. Slightly viscous with good carbonation and alcohol warming. One of these is enough for me. Overall very impressed."
"Overall very drinkable. I'd probably have this one with a nice hearty steak the next time."
"M/D - A full bodied syrupy feel throughout. Carbonation seems to keep it very active in your mouth as well. A very drinkable beer with a very high ABV that is very well hidden."
"D - this is a tasty beer, but the super high ABV and price limit its drinkability. Still, I'm down for enjoying one every once in a while, and when I do I usually enjoy it a fair bit. Give it a shot IMO"
"D'ability - 12% ABV and drinkabilty generally don't go together, but this goes down nicely."
"Overall - Wow! *followed by wide eyes and a huge smile* That was literally my first reaction to this when I opened the bottle and smelled its contents. My gf can attest to this. My nose was quite happy from the beautiful sweet aromas wafting to it from the tulip glass and my tastebuds became quite ecstatic from the tastes. This is a very well balanced beer that can certainly kick you in the ass. Candy currant buns, figs, and a shot of brandy. Reminded me a little bit of a JW Lees Vintage Harvest Ale, but a 2007 bottle isn't as ripe. I'm going to have to buy a few more to age for 5 years or so. Lovely, a beautiful sipper. I would like some Belgian dark chocolate to accompany this. Please do yourself a favor and try one if you see it."
"Drinkability: 12% abv? That's pretty high. But every last point is worth it for this delicious bastard of a beer. Incredibly complex tasting and smelling, smooth, and very attractive - this one's one of my favorites."
"Has a medium body with low carbonation that does not really add or distract from the drinking experience. A great beer but one serving is enough as the ABV will lay you out quickly."
"Chewy, caramel malts hit first, followed by a prickly booze note, wheat, and musty, resinous hops. This eisbock is complex, tasty, and plentiful in its flavor. Mouthfeel is a plethora of sensations: thick, sticky, chewy, and spicy. Certainly not for the faint of palate, as the tall order of booze works its magic on both the tongue and body. Surprisingly, it complements the flavor without overpowering some of the more subtle notes. Aventinus has definately set the bar for German wheats, and their Eisbock is no exception. Heavy, powerful, and delicious, this is a beer I hope to encounter again."
"This is my first of this style and I can't say that it's something I'd revisit with great frequency. I'm just not much of a wheat fan, but I'd choose this over some other wheat styles."
"watch out... it's 12% ABV!!"
"A full body is a bit light on carbonation and a little syrupy. For 12% this is very drinkable."
"D - I thought it would be less of a sipper, but I had to take it kind of slowly. Still a very fine beer and glad I had it."
"Pours an inviting dark brow, dark enough to reject light, with a modest one finger near white head. The head recedes but never leaves, coating the top of the beer with a slowly swirling layer of tiny bubbles. The smell is intense and complex, with layers of sweet molasses and dark brown sugar followed by raisins and plum, hints of toffee, and maybe a touch of black currant. Taste is equally intense and offers similar flavors including, oddly, coca cola. Alcohol is forward and present but doesn't distract. Mouthfeel is influenced by the warm alcohol, but not dominated by it. Fine bubbles tickle the tongue while a medium thick consistency coats nicely. Based upon the aroma, I expected this to be a touch too sweet for real drinkability, but while it is indeed sweet it never gets cloying and if not for the somewhat scary 12 percent I would be glad to have another. Highly recommended..."
"M - Very impressive beer. Incredibly easy to sip given the strength."
"High abv, but this pulls it off. An interesting brew."
"This unique brew is the color of mahogany with lots of fizz in the pour but virtually no head and no lace. The aroma is of chocolate, licorice and roasted almonds, some alcohol, very nice. It shows low carbonation and gives a mildly oily feel. It has a sweet smooth raisin and molasses flavor with warming alcohol and toffee. Pretty strong but drinkable, very balanced. Really coats the tongue with malty candy. Great."
"There is an honest-to-God burn on the way down. Medium-bodied otherwise, but a tad bubbly. A very strong and heavy beer. Dark and full of alcohol."
"Pours a dark brownish color and smells of strong, sweet and alcoholic caramel. Rich and flavorful, but short of cloying. Taste rich concentrated malt flavor, some toffee like notes and overall pretty good. Surprised by this one."
"Due to the alcohol this is no session beer, two of these will have you talkin funny."
"2004 vintage. Brown color with a fully developed, but then quickly diminishing white foam. Fairly powerful nose with hints of fresh pastries, apples, banana, vanilla, along with hints of blackberry and mocha. Flavor is loaded with complexity. A thick coating of caramel and toffee coats the palate, along with hints of fruit pie, vanilla and clove. Coating mouth feel. Wow, an intense, badass brew."
"D: pretty high abv, but very drinkable. ABV will limit how many you can physically ingest though...this is one dangerous beer!"
"D- pretty damn delicious"
"Whoa the taste is fantastic, sweet, syrupy, brisk carbonation, boozey but not overwhelming. The beer is slightly balanced by some faint hop essence but this is hard core wheat, fruit, honey, etc. Beautiful beer very tasty and inviting. And at 12% the alcohol is barely present."
"This comes out of the bottle a deep, semi-transparent brown with a thick beige head. Aroma is strong and malty with a hint of molasses and a touch of hops. Flavor is rich and smoky, mainly malty but with a little hop taste. Texture is fairly smooth and with a nice ragged alcohol bite."
"I'm a huge fan of the original Aventinus so when I first heard about this brew (back in the late 90's?) I couldn't wait to try it. I ordered some of the striped bottles back then and liked them a lot. Later, this brew finally arrived where I lived so I bought some more. I still thought it was good, but not as good as the regular Aventinus. I bought some more bottles on a few more occasions over the years, but they seemed to be hit-and-miss. (I think some of the bottles were old.) However, about a year ago, I had some of this eisbock on tap at the Brickstore in Atlanta and loved it. That restored my faith in this brew. Recently, I bought another bottle to try. I see that my bottle says 2007 on it. That made me a little nervous about it still having a fresh taste, but thankfully I'm enjoying this bottle quite a bit. It pours an unattractive, murky brown with little head. The aroma is a mix of classic weizen, but with some ""stink"" to it. I can't quite place my finger on what the stink is. Maybe it's just a phenolic that's a little bit out of control? Thankfully, the taste is better than the appearance and aroma. It tastes a lot like the regular Aventinus, but with more concentrations of everything. The alcohol seems to be well-hidden. Overall, I like this bottled brew, but I still think the regular Aventinus is easily superior. Hopefully, I'll get the chance to try some draft Aventinus Eisbock again in the future. It's been a little too long to remember for sure, but I think that version was better than this bottled version."
"D-Dangerously drinkable. A seriously top notch beer."
"(I hope my marks aren't too high for the style. Admittedly, I don't have any other experience with Eisbocks so I may be a little over-generous.)"
"Bottle 01568. Pours as black as velvet can get, with a thick, pillowy rootbeer head in a snifter--could be the fifth horseman of the apocalypse by its intimidation... complex scents-- citrus fruit, freshly mown hops grass, and a grapefruit mix... thin and crisp on the tongue... lingering aftertaste that holds like a pilsner... citrusy notes abound, with the slightest alcohol... hops are subdued, while the malts are impaling! HEAVY.... These guys are the masters, and though above my usual palate, this beer is a steam roller, obliterating any pre-existing taste in the mouth andforcefully asserting its power... memorable and warming."
"malt malt malt :D"
"Overall Impression - Very strong, but more drinkable than I would have thought. I would definitely put this in my regular rotation. Give it a try."
"Finish is rootbeer syrupy too."
"A dark brown beer with mahogany highlights. HAs a small tan head that bubbles away quickly. There is a sweet dried fruit character in the aroma with a hint of banana in the background.The taste is all raisins and fig with a strong alcohol push on the finish. Leaving a plum after taste."
"At 12%, it is a definite sipper.."
"This is a phenomenal beer. It's characteristics bring to mind the best of many differenct styles, from best bitters to weissbiers to heavier German ales. A must-try."
"Damn good beer. Very simple in flavor, any more complexities and it may have interfered with the simple humble quality of this fine beer."
"I tried this beer on December 23, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a dark brown with a fluffy tan coloured head which didn't very long. The aroma was malt and sugar. It was a sweet smell. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, slightly creamy, and medium carbonated. The flavour is primarily malty, but there is a peppery sense to the taste as well as an almost licorice taste."
"examples of the style, I cannot wait to be able to try this one again, it really is that good!"
"This beer was the first I had on a walking tour of brauhaus's in Munich (reviewed from notes). This brew poured into a pint glass had a wonderful deep purple color with a great tan head that didn't seem to go away. The smell was extremely floral with hints of wheat, yeast, deep malt characteristics. The taste was similar to the smell with a very floral start that melted into a yeast and clove filled finish. The beer was thick, but not too much. Only negative would be I could only drink the one being at the beginning of the tour and all."
"This is enjoyable to sip and savor. By no means what I was expecting - awesome!"
"Definitely go buy a bottle."
"This beer is amazing and I was rather excited to see Trappeze Pub had it on tap. Since tapping the first keg, I have had at least 15 of these beers. Appearance is dark brown with purple colors mixed in. Smell is predominantly of sweet, dark fruits (e.g., plum, apricot) as well as banana and clove. Taste mirrors the smell with a bit more sweet and spicy clove. Mouthfeel is nicely sticky sweet and perfect for the style. I will drink this beer whenever I see it on tap!"
"D - This is a pretty good Eisbock (only the 2nd I've had), but I thought it was quite good."
"Overall, alot like a Belgian strong dark ale. Very deep and fruity with a wine character. Recommended, just don't pour out the yeast."
"D- What an experience. A very unique beer that is very candy-like. Makes for a great night cap. I've had this on tap fresh as well and both forms are delicious."
"d - yum! this is a very big beer with lots of beautiful characteristics."
"Pours a medium cloudy, medium to dark brown color with dense, plentiful tan head and great tracing. Aromas of sweet, boozy, clove scented dates and prunes. Plenty of alcohol in that aroma, no hiding it; but it's not over the top or harsh. On the palate, it is THICK, and I mean thick. It's like they took Aventinus and reduced it. Flavors of chocolate, caramel and toffee really dominate. Fruity esters are much more muted than the original with the alcohol basically pushing them out. This is one beer to reckon with. Overall, I'd say they've really done a great job with making it drinkable and not cloying for 12% abv (compared to most of DFH's offerings)."
"Overall - A pretty good Eisbock although i think it could to with a bit of age to mellow things a bit... not a patch on the Kulmbacher Eisbock... certainly worth a try though..."
"An unfortunate (and expensive!) loser."
"NOTE: Let this beer warm slightly.."
"D: No surprise here, it's a sipper only. However, that's not due to the alcohol, which is present but not overwhelming. What hurts the drinkability (at least for me) it that it's both syrupy and clove dominated."
"Pours a beautifully ruby, cloudy, over carbonated beer that settles to a nice off white head and long strings of bubbles. Banana bread smell, no hints of hops, some fruity easters. Complex malt characteristics, vanilla, melanoidins, no hoppiness. Full body, definite alcohol warmth. Easy to drink, but the sweetness lingers to the point of almost too much by the end."
"D: Feels like drinking a weak liquor. Definitely has the warming feeling in the stomach."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for a beer of this strength, the fruit notes are very unique and add a lot of character to the beer."
"I think ive found a new favorite! And to think i bought this by mistake! I meant to buy the 8% abv weizenbock. Haha oh well. I will get that eventually."
"Pours a dark amber color and has quite a head that fades very quickly but leaves no lacing. I can tell it is pretty carbonated just because it sounds like a cola after I pour it. Smells like I would expect from a bock up front with some wheat smells afterwards. Raisiny, malty, a little bit of wheat, and a hint of alcohol coming up the rear. Tastes absolutely phenomenal. A smooth mellowed out caramel, malty taste with a hint of the wheat but very little alcohol. The alcohol really sneaks up on you in this one since it comes in at 12%. The mouthfeel is really smooth and goes down easily. Its very drinkable but I can't see myself drinking much else for a while after this."
"At 12%, this is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Quite drinkable considering the monstrous ABV..that being said, one bottle is probably enough. A nice deviation from the ""regular"" Aventinus that is well-worth a try."
"Cloudy reddish hue with thick head. Nose is clove, some smoke and banana. Taste- very rich brew- honey sweetness with the spicy malts. Finish is hot and dry. Mouthfeel is thick but not too syrupy. This is the definition of liqiud bread. Drinkability is high given the booze level in it. Luckily the richness counterbalances as more than a couple bottles of this would be a quick end to the evening. Very nice beer."
"drinkability is excellent. although the brew has a decently heavy body, it works to its advantage. wonderfuly complex with an excellent profile in aroma and taste. prost!"
"D - Definitely a session beer, one a night for me. This isn't my favorite type of beer, but I definitely appreciate it. I would only buy this once every couple years as a celebration type of beer, and only to share with another. Even though it's not my favorite, I'm trying to review it based on and compared with other similar beers/styles. It's definitely above average for me, but I wouldn't want to drink this on a regular basis."
"Bottle left at my house by dispholidus1 for long enough that i can justify drinking it. Pours brown, walnut colored. Big solid head of foam. Bubbles rise constantly. Smells of candied plums, dark chocolate and ethanol. Taste is malty and sweet. A pleasant nuttiness. Fruity complexity, with touches of strawberry, cherries, dates, plums, chocolate and caramel. Ethanol bite just on the finish, but very smooth otherwise. Velvety and thick, medium to full bodied. Very drinkable and enjoyable. A treat, and an affordable one at that (even when i actually have to pay for it!)"
"Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock pours a deep hazy amber with a foamy head that fades to almost nothing rather quickly. The aroma is sweet and syrupy with tons of dark fruitiness, with hints cooked corn. There is a deep earthy aroma as well. The flavor mirrors the aroma, sweet and syrupy with lots of dark fruits, and dark caramel. Lots of spicy alcohol comes through in the end, making this one a sipper for sure."
"D- Very easy to drink and highly refreshing for such a full bodied and high gravity brew. The cloves and spices especially are phenomenal, concealing the alcohol beneath layers of delicious complexity and leave the pallet and the mouth craving the next sip and regretting the moment that the last drop is gone. I think this is one I would drink all night if my wallet and my liver could handle it."
"Appears a big deep murky caramel amber brown hue, large highly carbonated effervescent tan head forms quick and fades slowly. The lacing is thick and clings effortlessly to the glass. Aroma contains tart apples, figs, and raisins with a slight vinegar or fermented cider edge to it. Fusel alcohol flows as well as concentrated sticky brown molasses and toasted caramel notes, spicy with clove and effervescent carbonation tickling the nose hairs. Flavor brings a flood of dramatic caramel and burnt brown sugar malt sweetness with layers of alcohol ripened dried fruits glazed with sugar. Mild banana strong upfront tart apples and deep raisin notes galore. Mouthfeel is bubbly with carbonation coming real lively, body is medium to full texture is syrupy especially as it warms although it never comes of cloying to me. Drinkability is actually pretty awesome for a German ice beer, it focuses and concentrates all of the likeable characteristics"
"Aventinus Eisbock pours a murky, deep woody brown that shows red/orange when held up to a light, the head starts off about one centimeter thick but falls to thin film of tiny bubbles in a short time. The smell is typical weizen yeast banana and clove but it is subtle here, there is also a fair level of bready wheat and the dominating solventy alcohol. The taste is upfront alcohol, solventy and slightly hot peppery and syrupy slick. In the taste I'm getting much more of the clove ester than the banana but that is there too along with the wheaty grain in the background, there is no mistaking that this is a real german Weizen. I don't get any bitterness at all in this it is totally overwhelmed by the malt and alcohol, but I guess that is fine for the style. Mouthfeel is very smooth warming and slightly slick the moderate carbonation keeps things from feeling too flat and heavy. Overall this is a very good beer I may have expected a bit more however, that being said I'm really not that disappointed. For a beer of it's strength this eisbock remains very drinkable, is still quite well rounded and a is definitely a classic wheat beer."
"Had this from the bottle at Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL in 09/2007, dont know how I forgot to rate this. Poured an attractive caramel/brown color. Had a nice white head that hung around a while. Aroma is sweet, possibly of caramel and brown sugar. Flavor is sweet up front, but finishes with a bit of a sour note. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is high for a beer with an abv north of 8%. My first weizenbock."
" I've seen cellaring has been recommended...I look forward to revisiting this one over the next few years."
"I greatly enjoyed this beer. I related it to a favorite of mine, celebrator, except having a bit of a stronger more mature taste to it. The maltiness was well balanced with the alcohol warmth, combined with a deep caramel oak flavor. The higher alcohol feel was present, yet it wasn't over powering. It made for easy sipping beer that could be enjoyed over and over again."
"Drinkability: Wow. For its strength, this beer is not that complex, but it sure is good, and it is dangerously drinkable. Mmm."
"D: The drinkability is scary. It would be easy to drink a few of these before the alcohol kicks in. This beer was thoroughly enjoyable."
"Not a lot of carbontion, but still pretty smooth. Finish is dirty."
"D - Sorry, this is a delicious and balanced brew, but I could not do another, this is potent stuff. I'd recommend this one with confidence at any rate though, as it is quite tasty."
"If it weren't for the high ABV, this would be a session beer but I would recommend that any beer drinker, no matter your style preference, drink at least one. Due to the thickness and overall bearing of this drink, I would recommend sipping, not just tossing it back, as the preferred method of enjoyment."
"Single bottle purchased for $3.50 from Gary's in Madison... Individual bottle number of 08545 on the back purple logo sticker... pours a mahogany-brown, ruby-red hue with a foamy head that soon dissipated... smell was very rich and intense, with plums, figs, and caramel... taste strongly complemented the aroma, with thick, rich, sweet caramel, dehydrated fruits, caramel, and figs... strong malts dominated this brew, and the very hefty 12% ABV was noticeable both in the nose and taste... good, thick mouthfeel but average drinkability due to the strong alcohol percentage and ultra-rich, very thick flavor that dominated the pallate and took over this beer... this is seriously flavorful stuff, very overbearing and powerful, and is better off sipped... strong, thick, rich, and dominating, this was certainly an interesting sample that should be enjoyed over a period of time... Worth a try, with a noticeable grape-taste..."
"Drinkability - This beer has awesome drinkability for its high ABV. The flavor and smell were on point. I could've easily had the entire bottle to myself. I will definitely get this again."
"Still well carbonated after almost 3 years. The alcohol is very well hidden and plays a role more in the taste, enhancing the fruity flavors, than the mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep mahogany with little to no head. Smells of deep, complex, rich malts mingled with noticable banana and clove scents and some licorice too. As it sits in my mouth the first thing I notice is that I can hear it bubbling in my mouth! It really comes alive in there. Taste is of dense malts, deep. The banana and clove aren't nearly as prominent. It is a fairly thick beer that coats the mouth. The aftertaste is bready and boozey."
"This is very tasty. I think I still prefer regular Aventinus but this is a heck of a great beer."
"M/D: Big thick, sticky, full body. Alcohol is there in bunches but very tolerable, also pretty warming. Carbonation is light to medium. Good beer, but I don't know how much I could drink. Very strong, very big, very good."
"Overall, the booziness in the taste and mouthfeel was too much for me."
"Quite good and interesting, but the original is far better, and you can have more. This is one and out..."
"Thank you again Dan."
"This was the first Eisbock that I have tried. All positive comments aside from the taste. I guess I was looking for the same experience one gets if you compare a glass Johannesburg Riesling with a glass of Eiswien- indeed the alcohol and sugar content of this Eisbock is stronger, but the flavor of this beer was not what I expected. It has a very strong syrup flavor and reminds me of port wine. I am eager to try other beers of this style."
"It's a bigger beer than an Imperial Stout. I'm glad I bought it, even though I can manage only one per sitting.Recommended, even though I prefer the Kulmbacher Eisboch."
"I will be buying more."
"D- Too big to have many, but enjoyable. A great winter beer!"
"Edit: not as drinkable as I thought. The fact that it is 2/3 the size of a bottle of wine, just as strong, and as sweet as port makes it a little hard to finish. Still tasty though."
"In the end, this is a drinkable beer, though I don't know how many of these I could put away in the course of an evening."
"Overall quite enjoyable -- similar to the original, but kicked up a notch. Unfortunately, this is a slightly less subtle brew than it's weaker cousin; the more delicate flavours I expect from the regular Aventinus are here overwhelmed by the alcohol and malty sweetness. None-the-less, it is extremely tasty and highly recommended."
"Alcohol level in this brew can make it a challenge to drink, definitely worth saving for an after-dinner dessert and then in small quantities. Large quantites can be headache inducing, but overall this is still a really good and complex brew that is worthy of a try."
"D - Good beer. Not as good as the other Aventinus but still good."
"Probably only the 4-5th time I've had this over the years; typically I am not a fan of German wheats, but lately, I've been trying to expand my horizons, and this is the beer to do it with... Awesome and would cellar like a champ."
"D - This is obviously a big beer, and not for the weak of palate. I feel a little overmatched here. Wouldn't want to drink a whole one myself (very often anyway). Better for sharing between 2 or 3 ppl and take it slow."
"Pours a muddy dark brown color with a huge tan head that dissipated fairly quickly into a slight cap. The cap was gone by the end of the glass leaving a flat muddy looking brew. The smell is strong. Caramalized bananas, honey nut clusters, cereal, brown sugar, concentrated raisin juice (if there is such a thing), medicinal phenols. The taste is of a concentrated hefeweizen with added prune juice. Banana and clove flavors mixed with sweet dark fruits. No malt bitterness in this one. The flavors are very strong but the sweetness will be a bit cloying towards the end. The feel is moderate with soft carbonation and a slick finish. Definitely a strong aroma and taste with this brew but the sweetness is off the hook and limits the drinkability. The alcohol is not detected but I'm sure its strong."
"Tastes of cloves and other spices, once again lots of plum and raisin, huge warming alcohol and molasses. This is one hell of a night cap."
"The body is moderate, not too heavy which is surprising given the maltiness. The alcohol tingles everything. You can definently feel the alcohol, but boy does it go down well. Compared to the first time I had this, I could possibly take more then just one of them."
"At first I wasn't really liking this brew, but it grew on me as I sipped it. It's not like any other beer I have had to date."
"The story behind this beer is really cool. Read the back of the bottle. Serendipity at its finest, and reinvented to boot!!!11"
"Very fruity, big alcohol punch, lots of spritz in the mouthfeel. Better than a macro, but not in the same league as its supposedly simpler cousin. Comparisons to a barleywine are apt. Too harsh edged to be a true hit if you like the other version of this brew. Try it so you know and then go back and pick up some of the other."
"Pours a dark caramel brown into a tulip with some yeasties left floating around to make things interesting. Has a fluffy light tan head that fades pretty quickly with virtually no lacing left behind. Smell is very complex and sublime with malts, cheries, grapes, esters and alcohol wafting above it all to let you know this brew means business. Tastes just as complex as it smells with sweet caramel, more grapes, a certain tartness, grain, and nice alcohol heat to finish things off. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, somewhat weightless, with the edges rounded off a bit making it very satisfying going down. Many people have described this beer a lot better than I can, but I know what's good, and this is good."
"My favorite eisbock is still my favorite. The last time I had it I thought it was just a bigger version of the normal Aventinus weizenbock, but this time around it had a little different characteristics. Really good."
"D: This beer does not hide what it is, a big old ice beer, but I don't care, it is still incredibly drinkable and fun to drink as well, just having this beer do its work in your mouth is worth the price of admission."
"This is a great beer. It is very drinkable for its high alcohol content. I wish I can do this again tomorrow."
"d: very warming and certainly a sipper"
"This is my flag beer...I love it...its pretty much bottled sex"
"D- Having never had Aventinus or an eisbock, this beer absolutely blew me away, such great balance and bouquet of flavors, I can't wait to try this again, it should be noted that even at 12%abv the alcohol takes a backseat to the wonderful blend of fruits and malts"
"Bottle 011124. Aroma of chocolate, clove/banana and toasted malt. Hazy dark brown with light tan head that fades to a slight collar. Falvor is chocolate banana up frront, which steps aside for huge alcohol and malt. Tail is phenol and alcohol. very warming."
"Drinkability: One in a sitting is enough for me. Very rich."
"Sweeet deal...and not to mention this buzz appeared out of nowhere."
"Drinkability- Doesn't seem like 12%. Just finished this and a Gonzo Porter and not feeling much of anything...not to mention the Hopsickle I had earlier while making my chili and cornbread. One of a handful of eisbock's I've had. Was expecting more, but still good and very drinkable. Flavor is good but not as thick as expected. Have had this one on tap before and had better results. Rating is based on a combp of this consumption and past ones."
"I would reccomend trying this one."
"D: This is a winter beer or one meant for servings as a special after dinner substitute for desert. I enjoyed it but doubt I could repeat it too many more times before the sweetness became overbearing. ."
"D - A very good beer, but being big can hit you hard. This should be sipped and enjoyed"
"I wanted to get this one for awhile, but only saw it recently for the first time. Pours a cloudy brown color with high carbonation and a thin lace of head around the edges of the glass. The high alcohol content is definitely present in the smell and as sweet malty and a little bit fruity aromas. The taste is superb, malty slightly bitter and wheat flavor. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth with the alcohol leaving tingly feeling. I would of liked to see a little more head, but it is an extremely well balanced beer, that is hard to improve on. This is my first eisbock review a I'll be looking out for more in the future."
"This beer is super foamy, dark brown with a ton of head but not much lace. The smell is strong with alcohol but the malt pleasantly breaks through. This beer is super smooth and sweet. There are some grain in the taste and closely resembles a barleywine. It is an all a round great beer with a nice warming feeling."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and the mouthfeel is very fine. All of this combined with the wheat makes for a near creamy smoothness. As noted previously, the alcohol is deceivingly absent, but there is a distinct warming effect. Pleasantly enjoyed as an Aventinus sipper. Shares all the qualities of the standard Aventinus, but amplified. I particularly enjoyed this being that its a colder evening. Pair this with any sort of cake or pastry featuring fall fruits."
"D) seriously unbelievably easy to drink. you'd think such a radioactive beer would require some effort to get down the throat. I'm now on #2 on reviewing this, and it just keeps getting better. If it wasnt for the crazy alcohol content, I'd drink many more of these"
"A big beer, with tons of flavor, but even packing a punch of 12% it goes down easy. A beer I will definitely revisit."
"Overall, I like it, but I prefer the wiezenbock much more."
"This was a pretty incredible beer. I've got one more in the cellar (closet...) and I think I'll pick up a few more from the store where I got it. 2005 edition. Poured with a ton of head for being 2 years old, off white and more bubbly than thick. The body was a nice shade of brown, not as dark as a porter, but clearer and less opaque than a brown ale. There were some particulates floating in the bottem too. The head stayed around for the entire drinkage, which was a rather long time as I sipped it through dinner and dessert. The smell was of various sweet malts, mostly caramelly and nothing to impressive, but still very appetizing. Tastewise I was blown away. Brown sugar and caramel mix around many lighter malts to create an intricate profile beyond my ability to decipher. The mouthfeel was almost perfect, but actually not as thickly bodied as I would have liked for the alcohol content and the flavor. The carbonation was a little heavy as well. It was a well carbonated port like brew, and it reminded me a lot of port. Very easy to drink making me want another one moments after I finished the first. With 12% abv, consider this one dangerous."
"Overall: This is one complex beer, and a must try for any beer drinker. I love the story of how the first Eisbock was accidentally created (see Todd's review for more info) and I'm glad they decided to recreate it for those of us who weren't around 60 years ago. I'd love to cellar some of this and see how it emerges a few years from now."
"12 ounce bottle, bottle #051076. Served in an oversized wine glass, the beer pours a cloudy mahogany/dark brown color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both low. The aroma is very nice, it smells like dark fruit, bubblegum, bananas, caramel, peppery spice and some alcohol. It tastes very malty, like dark fruit, alcohol, pepper, cloves, and bananas. The alcohol is noticable, but it doesn't hurt the overall taste of the beer too much. Mouthfeel is medium/full, with medium carbonation and a coating finish. Drinkability is good, but not great. Overall I think this is a good beer, I'd definitely buy it again and recommend it to others."
"An interesting and complex beer,definatly a sipper that goes down easily.Had a lot of Beligium characterictics to it. Would love to drink this beer again,would be great on a cold winter night."
"D - The 12%ABV limits the drinkability but I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants to adventure into different beers. Good on the odd occasion."
"Drinkability: Well at being 12% alcohol it would be hard to have more than 1 or 2 of these during a single night...."
"I consider it a great example of German brewing excellence and quality. A bit strong to be a 5 in drinkability for me, but it won me over. Such a great beer that was just another in a list of many that Michael Jackson promoted. The drinkability is great, a wonderful beer that is important traditionally as well flavor wise IMO."
"I think this is an interesting drink but lacks the drinkability of beer or the more etherial subtleties of spirits."
"D- It is one big beer that isn't shy. I would probably buy this again but wouldn't go searching for it."
"Enjoy!"
"D. The high abv limits the drinkability, but this will definitely be my favorite cold weather evening beer. A great beer all around. I am glad I bought some to cellar so I can track it's maturity."
"D: Certainly an assertive beer in its own right, but rolling over the palate, it offered dynamic change from weak to strong."
"Glad i had this though, as it is near impossible to get around here, and to get it at the source was a rare treat for me indeed!"
"Thanks to cburian for sharing this with me!"
"Very drinkable for 12% ABV. Highly recommended."
"Overall: My first foray into Eisbocks, Aventinus has seriously raised the bar for others of the style. Highly recommended."
"Poured a nice hazy dark amber almost brown with a decent head that slowly diminished to a ring. The aroma was dominated by dried fruits. Dried fruits also dominated the taste followed by wheat, a strange almost BBQ sauce-like flavor was also present. The beer was rather heavy with the alcohol being slightly abrasive. This one took me a while to drink, but I do enjoy it, especially as something completely different from anything I usually drink."
"11.2oz bottle, labelled 2006. Pours a murky, muddy brown with some little bubbles on the side of the glass. Aroma is wheaty, but not particularly strong. Taste is all Aventinus up front, but then feels heavier and more alcoholic on its way down. Almost warmer. I probably should have prefaced this review by saying that regular Aventinus is one of my favourite beers of all time, so I was practically giddy about trying this one. Flavour is good (well, it would have to be), but I'm not sure it's necessarily better than regular Aventinus. But it certainly goes down the throat more like hard liquor than a beer."
"Overall: I was not a huge fan of this beer. The taste was nice, but I think the alcohol taste masked the true flavor of this beer. Nice to say I have had it, but I probably would not buy it again."
"This is totally different from the other eisbock (Kulmbacher) I have tried, which I don't think was made with wheat. But I may be wrong. This is a great and unique beer."
"Highly recommended. This is an excellent eisbock. I think it's time to buy some more..."
"Drinkability - As this being my first Eisbock, I'm at a loss as to comparisons. However, I will say this is quite the sipping beer to be enjoyed throughout the evening. Don't try this at home without appropriate supervision! :) I'll have to put some of these away to see how well these mature. To my taste, I didn't find this high ABV as appealing as other offerings. I'll have to expand my experience with Eisbock's to provide a fair comparison."
"D - Very good. Not something to take lightly. Better suited for a cold day and I had this on a hot one. Would like to try it in the winter."
"D- I think this beer makes for a fine dessert beer, but I would only drink it in the winter months. Given the style, it is a very enjoyable beer, perhaps one of the finest."
"This is a very drinkable beer for being 12% ABV. It is also very complex. I'm certainly glad I tried it."
"D-whoa dangerously good. Aventinus is a superior brewery and the Eisbock is no exception."
"This is a very drinkable brew that is not heavy handed in the taste when it comes to alcohol despite the aggresive 8% abv. Enjoy it on tap or in a bottle."
"Aventinus Weizen Eisbock pours a mahogany brown color with a thick head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malt, banana and clove. Taste is intense, a stronger version of Aventinus for sure. In addition to banana and clove flavors, there were some medicinal flavors floating through the mix as well. Not really off putting, but definitely present. Alcohol is more felt than tasted, but I think there's a hint of it in the taste too. There is a thick mouthfeel that I really enjoyed. Recommended."
"I don't feel as crippled after this as I do after a Brooklyn Monster Ale or a Bigfoot, but you have to respect the alcohol. Drinkability for this beer is ""Would you like to drink a second one?"" The answer is a most resounding YES."
". needs to be more ...syrupy? ...but i have wanted this for a while and am not sorry i got it..if i had a cellar i would buy a few!!!"
"This was one of the most interesting beers I've had in a while. Its not a style that I visit very often either. After an aggressive pour I still didn't get very much head at all. It was a very dark brown and had a sweet molasses smell to it. First few drinks I pulled a brown sugar and kind of a hot cinnamon taste from it. Is a good mid body beer with a little bit of tobacco taste in it as well. The alcohol is recognizable but I would have never guessed 12%. Drinks more like a 8 or 9. A great beer overall. When I got down to the end of it I notice a ton of sediment. That's to be expected."
"Syrupy malt presence, sweet as hell, and very full and creamy. Diacetyl and clove fight with dark caramel-toffee malt, no real significant hop flavor. Wheat makes it so very easy to drink. Finish is full-bodied with lots of flavors left over. The first time I had this I thought it was the tastiest double digit abv beer I'd had. It's still way up there."
"Overall, this feels like drinking liquor. Pairs up nicely with a cigar, but a little harsh to drink. A sipper at best. Very strong and interesting aromas though."
"M/D: this is a suprisingly smooth and esy to drink beer. there is a noticeable alcohol in the finish, but nothing bad, or too intense. overall its a good beer and very enjoyable"
"Poured from the bottle - A purplish brown with an soft white head. Good complexity in aroma and body. Flavor is sweet and rich with cloves and citrus tastes. Warming alcohol mouthfeel with alot of yeast and bread in the finish. Try this along with a piece of quality dark chocolate."
"Overall, this beer was extremely enjoyable. I would not hesitate to get it again, and in fact, I'll probably try to get it often."
"Dark caramel color with a nose of candy corn and/or dark candy sugar. Flavor is the same with stewed dark fruits - raisins and prunes with yeasty burnt currants. It was not without a certain character reminiscent of a dark/ strong belgian ale. Because of that I will take the regular Aventinus over it for its bock/weizen character. Really good though."
"Original rating: 3.5/5/5/5/5"
"D - Wow. I've had high ABV's before, but nothing like this. Be careful, this is like a couple of Bigfoots kicking you in the pants. Clocking in at a mere 12, this guy mirrors and even mocks the 19% Dogfish Head WWS, in my experience. It's bitter, but overall that should be countered by a cautious sipping."
"Pours a dark translucent brown with a thin head and little lacing. The aromas are of banana, clove, and toffee. The taste is complex and quite nice if a little bit on the sweet side. More clove, cinammon, baked apples, bananas, and a long sweet malty finish with lots of clove on the finish as well. Quite spritzy in the mouth, medium bodied. Not really cloying even though its a somewhat sweet beer. Surprisingly drinkable given the alcohol which is well hidden. A nice after dinner sipper."
"B'ham UK April 2007"
"Medium-bodied, with very little carbonation. Tasty as hell, but too malty and alcoholic to be drinkable."
"Dark, murky brown with a thick tan head that is well retained. Aroma is very complex, banana, fruit (cherries and figs), tobacco, brown sugar, and spices. Flavor of caramel, clove, banana, and quite a bit of alcohol. Fortunately, the alcohol serves to cut the sweetness and spiciness, balancing the flavor quite well. An excellent beer, one of my favorites."
"d: i enjoy heavy beers & this one is easy to drink vs. others. an excellent beer -- reminds me why i really like this style of beer -- too bad there aren't more brewers out there making this complex beer. can't wait to have the 2nd one i have in stock!"
"This is a more refined but bigger version of the regular aventinus doppelbock. The beer is basically a German version of the barley wine. Dark and very fruity ( almost clove-like ) on the nose. This is a sipper that evokes the complexity of doppelbock but with bigger finish with higher ABV."
"Drinkable, in that I'm very much enjoying drinking this as a dessert after a filling dinner. But is it drinkable as a session beer, did I hear you ask? A SESSION BEER?!... Yeah, I didn't think you asked me that."
"This is whole different experience than drinking the original. You can't really compare the 2 to each other, but each one is a unique and great drinking experience in and of itself."
"I'm writing this review as I drink this from a standard pint glass. Poured from an 11.5 ounce bottle (# 04029, 2006) with a quick fizzy head that dissipated quickly. Globs of yeast float around. Color is a very murky brown, and slightly unappealing. Aroma includes alcohol, grapes, an unidentifiable but distinctly sour smell, apples, and dried fruit. Taste is distinctly malty, with essentially no bitterness. It's quite sweet, with vinous and vanilla notes in the forefront, along with the distinct solvent taste of alcohol, which is quite pleasant with the other flavors. The bubble gum and banana flavors I hear about are also present, but subtle and harder for me to detect. There is a distinct smokiness in this beer, not unlike a pinot noir or merlot wine. The mouthfeel is syrupy, but fairly thin compared to what I was expecting. The drinkability is very high, except, I imagine, when you get to number 3 or 4 and realize you're tanked. Oops...I just burped...and the banana taste was bold! All in all, one of the best beers I've tried thus far. Very high recommendation."
"This is quite the unique beer; I cant say Ive had anything else like it. Smells much better than it tastes, to me. It's odd, I keep thinking of a Belgian strong dark ale crossed with a German Hefe. Not a session beer at all, but its hitting the spot tonight, and I think its well worth a try. Thanks to Khaismus for sharing!"
"D- I would have a bottle, but not very often."
"The pour into my too-large Aventinus normal weizen glass raises almost no head at all, just a thin tan layer that quickly (and noisily) fades to nothing. There's a lot of thick, chunky sediment in the murky brown/red/copper body. I suppose I should have poured carefully, but I didn't expect this from the style. A strong, sweet raisin scent poured out of the bottle with the liquid immediately. There are also notes of molasses, pepper, mint, and alcohol. The taste is syrupy-sweet, with huge maltiness. I suppose there's a bit of flavor reminiscent of wheat, but perhaps I wouldn't have said so if I didn't have a label to read. The alcohol is also quite forward. For something so huge, the mouth isn't absurdly thick. Carbonation is minimal, though. A bit rough, overall."
"This beer is truly a seamless melding of a weizen and an eisbock. Definitely a joy to sip and savor."
"This beer was immensly rich and complex. It was rediculously drinkable considering the 12% ABV. This beer is truly a masterpiece. I can find no flaws."
"D: Great stuff, though I prefer the subtler Weizenbocks. Great flavor, though I don't think I could/should drink more than one of these in one sitting. It's 12% abv and there is no hidding it. All in all though an all around good beer. Try it for yourself!"
"The 12% is dangerously well hidden and quite warming on this chilly February evening. I'm glad I finally got around to having this classic."
"Welcome to hella-sweet gummy wheat land, and not a word of that is a knock. No, this is one extra-large grain-gracious Bavarian bock. Sure, the ABV sticks its fingers up your nose and leads you willy-nilly by the nostrils, but the warmth it imparts keeps it cozy and worth the mild degradation. So sip away, you saucy sots, and savor it as it demands of its imbibers."
"Drinkability- This one is definitely a sipping brew at 12%. Still, it's delicious and interesting, and easy enough to drink for what it is."
"Drinkability was fine, with the stipulation that it is definitely something you want to sip rather than gulp. Overall, very good for its type, but I prefer the regular Aventinus personally."
"I could drink this all day. Well done Eisbocks are tough to beat and this is nearly the best that Ive had. The booze Is covered remarkably well. The phenyls that do come through are pleasing and add to the feel by warming and soothing the mouth, tongue, and throat. Appears deep and dark and deceivingly purple, more a reaction to the bottles label then the beer itself. Medicinal aromas and rich spices, bananas and jams, fermented mystery fruits that you might find in your great aunts cupboard Caramel, bubblegum, yum, yum, yumThis is so good! If I ever find this on tap it will lead to one hell of a drunken night, or rather, a great drunken couple of hours followed by a hellish and sleepless night and an even worse morning. This beer is like an M32 grenade launcher. Its versatile and can hit you six times in 3 seconds. I love it."
"Oh my. At first I thought something was wrong with this beer- it poured think and cloudy. Then I remembered, well, this is a special beer, and the combination of wheat, dunkel and bock, and then sorta frozen, I really shouldn't judge until I take a taste. Very malty, bready aroma's. Taste is, like....a regular Aventinus on steroids, but legal. Such an intense flavor it's almost hard to decribe . There is sweetness, and some traditonal weizen flavors as well- banna and clove. But everything is strong AND mellow. That's the beaty of this beer. Just an exceptional beer. Very warming and delightful by the fire."
"This beer was very enjoyable. Though the sheer strength of the flavor (not to mention the relatively high alcohol content) keep this from being the perfect session beer, it is still very drinkable. This is my favorite 12%+ beer, and I'd gladly take it over any barleywine I've had. This would beer an ideal beer for a cold winter's night. Prost!"
"Thicker than a weizen and smoother than back. Easy to drink, but the ABV can be a bit too much, even with the bottle size."
"Drinkability is good but it is a sipping beer for sure. The alcohol content is always noticeable and kills the flavors after a while. I expected a bit of this effect from the style but not quite as much as received with this beer. I'll take a regular Aventinus, please."
"D - This is a tremendous dessert beverage. Skip the chocolate cake and have one of these."
"Such a delicious brew. Perfect dessert beer after a beefy meal. Good when fresh, better when aged. Store some away for better drinking down the road."
"D: Still good, certainly didn't mellow like many beers, but I think I will split the rest with other BAs; too much for one sitting."
"Overall I found this to be a very enjoyable beer and will look fo it again when I am inthe mood for an eisbock."
"The beer pours a very nice little head that falls leaving a good lacing behind. The color is very dark dark amber color. The color is sweet and very good. The taste is wonderful stuff, it is strong with great flavors of the original weizenbock. The mouthfeel does still have a bit of a bite to it, very carbonated. Overall the drinkability is very nice, something I would have once in a while."
"Slightly opaque, dark amber-brown brandy body. Two fingers of dirty off-white head rapidly dissipates leaving a bubbly ring. Ripe grapes and berries on the nose with dark chocolate, licorice, cedar, brandy, and grape puree. Alcohol is there too, but not up front. Very complex, inviting aromas. Slight tanginess up front. Sweet fruits, banana, grape jam, pear brandy, and mild, smooth chocolate-caramel. Alcohol comes in the guise of sweet tropical fruits and bananas and plays a major part in the finish, accompanied by tangy yeasty malt. Warming and liqueur-ish; a sipper. Vibrant, bubbly carbonation lifts up an otherwise, full-bodied, syrupy beer. More drinkable than it should be!"
"Cheers!"
"Deep walnut brown with a small head. Heavy caramel in the aroma with some molasses and chcoclate covered cherries. The same flavors are echoed in the taste along with a little brown sugar and cloves. Well carbonated with a medium-full mouthfeel. Easy to drink for its strength. This is a really nice sipper to relax with."
"Something to bring in the new years, or to start welcoming the new year. Pours a cloudy brown with a lot of sediment. Smells quite pruny. Tastes like whoa...prune juice, vodka, caramel, bit of apple and spices, and all of it quite strong. Overall it is a sipping beer and one you must approach with an open mind. Definetly not a session beer, a sipping nightcap type beer. It's a little too fruity for my hoppy palate, but just my opinion only."
"Poured from the bottle into a 12-oz pint glass. Deep rich brown color with a 1.5 inch head. Some orange hints shining in through the light. Overall, it's a very dark and even cloudy beer. Very interesting looking; not sure if I've ever really seen another beer quite like this. Beautiful bouquet. Sweet and malty aroma with hints of plum, raisin, and prune. Floral and fruity, but not citrusy at all. This beer smells very nice. Quite tasty too. Some molasses in the flavor; maybe some far-away hints of vanilla. I can taste some banana as well. Again, I get raisin and prune in the taste as well. A nice hop freshness settles in on the roof of the mouth as well. Very rich and malty, like a good bock should be. The mouthfeel is a tad thin, but still solid. A very drinkable beer, and one that I could enjoy a few of in one setting. Watch out for the high alcohol content, which I was actually unaware of when I purchased it. I would definitely recommend this bock to fans of the genre and to neophytes alike. Seriously, the more I drink it, the more I like it. This is a very nice beer."
"Overall: This is a beer probably for a more refined palette than mine. I could appreciate the fruitiness but the alcohol to me gave the beer an unpleasant character. I doubt I'll try it again."
"This is a new MUST HAVE for my beer stash."
"This beer is so robust, maybe the ultimate winter warmer? Still it comes short of the mighy Aventinus, but not by much."
"This is a nice sipping brew. Personally, I prefer the original Aventinus. - but this is a nice twist on it. Sweet, thick and strong. Too much for more than one - but, one to sip and savor is nice."
"Overall, this is above average, but not excellent. I prefer their other weisen."
"-Oelergud"
"D - The gargantuan alcohol burn makes this a slow sipper, not a sessioner, but I will return to this once in a while when there is time to slowly enjoy this fine brew. I drank this by candlelight when our power was knocked out one snowstormy night and this was the perfect warming beverage for the occasion."
"Pours a dark carmel brown. Thin head,and some lacing. Smell is of dark malts,fruits,and carmel. Body is thick,and smooth, with some carbionation. Taste is of dark fruit,especially rasin,with a very nice alchol presence. This is a big tasting beer,but it was smooth,and easy to drink."
"D: Very tasty and not filling, goes down easy for a beer with such a high ABV, I drank it pretty quickly, but if I were drinking a second, I go a little slower. Overall, this is a very good beer."
"Thick swirling sediment permeates the caramel highlighted amber body. Fizzy, instantly vanishing head of big tan soft-drink inspired bubbles that disappeared completely and left no lacing. Ample carbonation streams pierce the surface and lend the appearance of soda. Thick aromas of alcohol soaked dark fruits, cloves, bread crust, and bananas. The taste is sweet, sticky, and thick with cloves, bananas, and plums. This is instantly warming. Light peppery carbonation keeps the alcohol drenched cloves moving, but they still manage to hold their grip through the finish building in intensity alongside the bananas. Strong wheat beer accents have been bumped up and given a medium heat alcohol edge. Slightly drying in the finish. This is certainly Aventinus plus and enjoyable, but I prefer the regular Aventinus."
"Drinkability - this is very good, complex, and rewarding. At 12% abv, it is obviously not sessionable. Enjoy in small quantities and with food."
"The mouth is medium bodied, complex with an wide array of malty and elegantly sugary elements interplaying all along the palate, ample carbonation preventing it from ever getting syrupy. Thus, it's quite drinkable and damn pleasing from start to finish. Wonderful."
"Drinks okay, a by the fire sipper."
"Very nice overall, but only for a nightcap or special occasion. Regular Aventinus is better in my opinion."
"D- not very drinkable in large doses, something to definitely drink occasionally, takes a while to get through a pint of the stuff"
"D - Rather good. Dangerous drinkable for a 12%'er. Honestly though, I will probably never have this beer again. Aventinus is vastly superior to its own eisbock counterpart. The alchol just kills the beer here. For the same price, I can drink MORE Aventinus and get drunk less quickly. An excellent beer, but with a better cousin."
"This ones delicious and really well done. The alcohol is wonderfully mild making this extremely easy to drink."
"i sipped on it for about an hour...drank it straight out of the bottle...i only know the color cuz my mom asked to try it and so i gave her a little bit thinking she would be disgusted by it but she thought it was real good ...i was shocked ....must try it"
"Found this bottle at my friends house while house-sitting and it seems to be at least a couple of years old judging the label I saw and the currently used version of the label. He did say help myself to anything. The beer pours a dark mahogony almost ebony into a goblet with no head to speak of and what appears to be some solids (yeasts, protiens) which are to be expected based on how this beer is made and matured. The nose is very rich and sweet with a little alcohol detectable and a port-like fruitiness. Held up to the light the beer reveals a soft crimson color at the center of the glass surrounded by dark edges. The first sip surrounds my tounge and tastebuds in a rich velvety sugar-plum sweetness that rounds out with a very strong alcohol taste.The mouthfeel is superb - thick, full, warming, and the beer finshes smooth with a subtle hopiness and a very similar tartness to a nice strong barley wine. The second sip is much more malty and reveals the distinct wheat flavor of the weizen-bock bier that this brew began as and the many levels of fruitiness in the finish - date, fig, black cherries soaked in rum. Overall this beer is a very complex and robust example of an Eisbock, maybe owing a good amount of it's unique character to the fact that it is a weizen bock. This is truly an amazing beer."
"Taste? Yuck. All alcohol. There's way too much booze in this guy. I greatly enjoy the Weizenbock, but this is overdone. I miss the banana and clove notes. This is just a disgusting mess. I will never have this again."
"EIther way, very enjoyable and a great first impression."
"Tasty, but the sweetness and high abv would make it hard to drink more than one in a sitting."
"I really enjoy Aventinus, so I hoped this would be a natural extension. In fact, its extraordinary. The beer pours a deep ruby-brown color with thick off-white foam. The amount of head is remarkable, given the strength of the brew. The aroma is amazing. Its a fabulous mix of ultra-ripe fruit (plums, raisins, banana), molasses, sugar, malt, and spice. The alcohol gives the beer a strong ethanol smell, almost like a fortified wine, only tempered by a lot of sweetness. The taste is explosively goodintense malt and wheat flavors, sugary and syrupy, lots of warming, with a n incredible artesianal bread-like quality. Its like drinking alcoholic wheat-bread syrup thats been laced with fruit and spice. Caramel and molasses are prominent in the flavor as well. The finish is a marathon of lingering flavors, with a liquor-like warming. Its a beer thats worthy of intermittently short sips, spaced between long and contemplative sips. Otherwise, the intensity can be very overwhelming and taste-bud fatigue can slip in. However, enjoyed over the long-term, this brew is exceptionally rewarding."
"I'm afraid to go near an open flame...I'm afraid to go near my wife...."
"Prosit!"
"Drinkability/Overall: a phenomenal beer. Insanely drinkable for a 12% eisbock. Interesting wheaty-sour/dark fruit complexity. A nice amped-up version of their already stellar weizen-bock."
"Drinkability/notes: Absolutely superb, a must try."
"Drinkability: My tastebuds are still saying ""Wow"". I admire this version as much as regular Aventinus, albeit for the deft ice filtering and clean flavor. Fantastic--I wish I had six more."
"D - a treat! Hard to believe it's as strong as it is until you're done with a bottle. Enjoy!"
"Pours a delicious looking dark brown with an off-white bubbly head. The glass it comes in is also damn sexy. The nose gives a lot of malt, yeast, acohol, and sherry. When I drink this, I get the heat of the alcohol, as well as the malt from the nose, but I also get raisins and cherry. This goes down creamy, with light carbonation. It's heavy, but delicious, although when I wad one it felt syrupy and cloying. I can do 1-2 of these max."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Delightfully active and graceful in the mouth, and very refined... I was expecting something maybe along the lines of Scaldis, with its big ABV... this is a pleasure, so full of character. Almost too big for even a dessert beer, yet easy drinking... yes, quite a paradox. This is a difficult beer to review, so sample one for yourself and tell us what you think."
"You wouldn't and probably couldn't drink more than 2 of these at a sitting so I have to rate this a bit low even though it is one of the best beers I have ever consumed."
"D: My first eisbock review. I don't know if I'm crazy about this one, but it is still quite good and seems to fit the style description perfectly. I think I'll try this one again on a cold winter night."
"D: 2004 doesn't seem to old for this beer but I feel a lot of the flavors are muted than they should be. The nose was the first hint. Very good regardless but I'd like to try this beer with a bit more bite so I know what I'm missing."
"P.S. This is the most drunk I've ever gotten from a 12 oz. bottle, so be forewarned. I emphasize the word ""nightcap."""
"Aventinus overdid themselves with this beer. A mistake, that was well worth being mistaken for. A world class Eisbock."
"Drinkability is way high, if you like this style go no farther. Prosit und Zum wohl!, MK"
"Truly a smooth, blankety mouthfeel, without feeling like you have sweaters on your teeth. Fizzy only when swirled, and settles to a near-creaminess. Drinkable? No. Worthy to be sipped, savored and enjoyed? Absolutely!"
"Probably would be thicker if not thinned by the 12%, still very full, rich, and moderately syrupy. Sweet and sticky in the finish, but with remaining power and strength. The beer improved greatly as the brew warmed to room temperature and expelled its pin-prikling carbonation. A good 'beer alternative' to a port wine or brandy."
"Overall: This is my first expereince with the Eisbock style. Amazingly rich and flavorful."
"Drinkability is good a very enjoyable brew big on taste, malty is growing on me. Want to thank babydoc and BCG BIF for this bottle."
"I'm keeping in mind that the bottle might be a little old, but I thought for the abv, it would have aged fine. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy this."
"Mouthfeel is rich and full bodied, and very easy to drink for the high abv."
"Taste is pretty much the same ... but what I really marvel at is how well the alcohol is concealed. I've had many brews this strong, or nearly so and none of them concealed the alcohol as well as this one does. The taste kind of reminds me of some American barley wines, like Alesmith, or Stone or even North Coast's. I really enjoy the flavors here. Mouth is smooth, with low carbonation. I could really drink lots of this ... I'm really enjoying this one."
"Dark and cloudy teak colored beer with virtually no head. Aroma hints at sweet flavors, with cloves, figs, and molasses present. Very bakery/patisserie type smells in here -- rich, warm, inviting sweetness on display. On the palate, the first thing to show itself is hugely sweet dates, then a flash of sour fruit comes in before a big, raw alcoholic burn takes over at the tip of the tongue and back of the throat. That alcohol burn is way too harsh and detracts from the mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer significantly. Overall, interesting effort, but it lacks balance and subtlety while displaying all the pitfalls of ""extreme"" beers. Still, I can imagine that if you want a warming drink in the winter time and don't want to drink liquor or mulled wine, this would do."
"Beer poured deep, cloudless mahogany color with a quick, fizzy head that didn't retain very well and left no lacing along the sides of the glass. The nose was quite good: dark, complex malts with strong tones of dark fruits and a lingering, sweet spiciness. The scents coming from This one are quite good. The mouthfeel was a thick, syrupy maltiness that slid about and around the tongue and left lingering alcohol taste on the pallette. The beer opens up and allows you quick glimpses into its narrow and interesting complexities: brown sugar and raisons along with other flavors poke up at you. Although the abv is aparent at the finish, this beer remains still deliciously drinkable although still hindered by it. I wouldn't reach for more than a few of these in a row on a single sitting, but I would drink it regularly if more available to me."
"11.2oz brown bottle with bottle # 00490/2005 on the back. Pours a murky brown with some sediment. No head or lace to speak of. Looks thick. Smells of dried dark fruits, brown sugar, alcohol. Very complex. Again dried dark fruit and brown sugar. Very fruity. Thick and syrupy. Hard to drink on a warm June night. Not the best Eisbock I have had but it shoul age very well. I think I will buy some more and stash them away. This one was just too young."
"The taste isn't boozy at all, unlike the telling smell. I get a ton of alcohol warmth, but the main show is a very tender yeast and wheat. It reminds me of cream cheese a bit. Very soft and delicate the way they work together. Tons of dark fruit and sweetness work their way around in here, especially at the end where the nice ""spike"" of tartness hits. I half expected this to be a sludgefest, but this is surprisingly smooth and well carbonated. I'm sipping this thing way too fast, and the crisp finish only leaves me wanting more."
"Was definitely worse when it was cold, but even as it warmed up the alcohol was just too much (I felt this about the EKU as well). Too bad."
"The brown body starts off with small specks of a head that quickly disappear. Alcohol and bananas are fighting to be the dominant aroma, but alcohol wins. Clove and phenols are also in the nose. The taste has all of the above as well as a bready flavor, brown sugar and a cough syrup cherry. The mouthfeel is chewy and somewhat sticky. This has good drinkability, but I think the looming 12% abv might disagree."
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color beer with a small dark foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma is just plain incredible mix of dry fruits (figs, prunes and raisins) with some floral malt. Taste is also dominated by the sweet fruit aspect but doesnt go overboard. Alcohol is well hidden and body is just above average. I probably wouldnt drink more then one in a session but I would love to smell this aroma over and over again."
"This pours a dark burgandy with a medium head. The smell is very strong almost wine like with alcohol and a smoked aroma. The taste is very powerful and concentrated with a dark fruit flavor,again wine-like, with a smoked wood flavor also. The m/f is heavy with the flavors all mixing well. For a beer that high in alcohol this is very drinkable. This is a beer that should not be missed."
"Overall a very tasty treat, and very easy to drink."
"D - This beer curiously hangs somewhere in the limbo between a fortified dessert wine and a big beer. It definitely needs to be enjoyed as a nightcap like a glass of port wine or perhaps a cordial. If not, might I suggest the excellent Aventinus Weizenbock instead?"
"Be sure to drink warm! All the good properties come out as it warms."
"I was pleasently surprised to find this one in the blue mountains of Sidney. Poured a murky eggplant color into a wine glass with little head and faint ruby hue towards the bottom of the glass. Smell was delicious, dark over ripe prunes, red wine aromas and some chocolate notes in there as well. Taste was heavenly with powdered sugar, plum, wheat, chocolate, grape....the complexities were nerely innumerable. Mouthfeel was also a plus as there was a nice hoppy character accompanying the wheat and fruit flavors, making for a melange of different tastes to pick up on. This is some pretty strong juice, so for the unseasoned beer drinker one might be enough, however I think a couple bottles of this could potentially do quite nicely for just about anybody wanting to try an exceptional beer experience. Final thoughts: fabulous, this is a beer with some great complexities going on. Not only is it a great style of beer, but also one with alot of personality. Cheers"
"This is the best eisbock I've had to date, and I think it owes quite a bit to the wheat. If you like the original Aventinus, you'll LOVE the eisbock!"
"I'm glad I tried this but I won't be making a habit out of it."
"D: Very good, especially considering the strength."
"Thick cream colored head topped this dark brown beer. There was a strong smell of malt with hints of banana and alcohol sneaking in for the ride. The beer was very thick with profound malt flavors. There was also banana and hints of coffee noticed. The alcohol left the mouth dry and in need of another taste. This was a very good beer that needs to be enjoyed slowly and over a period of time. If not, the alcohol is bound to sneak up on you."
"Ruddy chestnut colour with a thin, light brown head. Fine bubbles formed sheets of lace on the glass. Bready yeast aroma with some warm alcohol, banana, clove, bubblesgum, and a vague tropical fruit character. Candy sweetness, breadiness, and banana hit the palate right away. More fruit, including banana, comes out towards the end. Spice stays quite mild throughout. Great depth of flavour with mild alcohol warmth. Full, almost heavy body, low carbonation. Smooth texture with some dryness due to the alcohol. Great complexity and balance - very enjoyable. Thanks northyorksammy!"
"Drinkability - a potent form of wheat brew, a good pick now and then."
"The sweetness of this seems to cloy, surprising in that I feel regular Aventinus is the near-perfection of balance. Still, an interesting and valid 'big beer'."
"Overall this is an awesome beer with flavors are intersting and complex. The high ABV is well hidden but certainly sneaks up on you. Make sure you don't have anything but relaxing to do right after drinking this one."
"Pours a muddy brown with a thin, white ring of ""head."" Amazingly strong weizen aromas of banana, clove, and bubblegum. I'm truly taken aback at the how assertive this beer is while smelling it. I, in no way, have to stick my nose in the glass and sniff for this beer's character; it's all upfront. Ditto on the flavors. Tastes like weizen concentrate (which it IS, of course). This is a real treat for anyone who loves characteristic German wheat flavors. The only area that the taste loses points in is that I feel the sweetness could be put a little more in check. Aside from that, this is pretty damned stellar. Does a great job of hiding the alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and fairly slick with a little bite on the tongue. I am impressed with how drinkable this is, especially at its alcoholic strength. Those who do not phenolic beers should steer clear of this one."
"This is probably not a great session beer. It is a bit high in alcohol. Also, the flavor is pretty aggressive. It is a good beer though. I am glad to have had the chance to try it."
"2 year old Eisbock served in a pilsner glass. Murky brown with no head at all, but some mild carbonation. Smell is slightly alcoholic with a sweetness of wheat extract. The taste is enhanced by the stellar body which I chewed through. Large doses of clean wheat flavor and tight yeast flavor mixed with a good alcohol taste, fruityness starts to bloom in the middle of my tongue in the aftertaste and draws me back for more. Lovely stuff."
"Slight off-white head over a foggy tawny mahogany body. Yeast was swirled and decanted. Head fully dissipates, leaving some streams of rising bubbles. Smell is vinous and sweet, with coffee, chocolate malt, figs and prunes, cherries, toasted rye bread and date nut bread, maybe a hint of walnut. Taste is sweet vinous, peppery, warming, chocolate-covered cherries, burned sugar, roasted hazelnut. Very complex. Wow. The alcohol is definitely right there: no hiding 12%, even behind all this flavor. But what an amazing amount of flavor. Red wine. Just got a piece of Ghirardelli dark chocolate -- what a match! Also, what a thick, creamy mouthfeel. This is smooth as silk and thick as caramel. However, it's for sure a one-at-a-timer. Will I have this again? Absolutely. Will I have it again tonight? Don't think I could. Exceptionally drinkable for what it is."
"Musings: This beer will kick your ass. It is a delicious malt powerlode that will knock you out. Highly recommended."
"D - Drinkable. Another excellent brew from this brewery."
"Deep brown color, only slight head after pour. There is an abundance of chunky sediment throughout this one, which kind of turns me off a bit, but what the hell, I still think it will be good. I even tried to leave behind the yeast but there was no stopping it. Aroma is a nice rasiny, chocolate, alcoholic experience. Taste is sweet for a second, then overpowered by raisiny alcohol that carries through the finish and beyond. The malt flavor is mostly dark fruit, with a hint of spice, much like a dubbel or grand cru. The mouthfeel runs even a bit thin, not syrupy as expected. Carbonation is adequate, its quite smooth, I don't really detect any grainy or chunkyness despite what I could see in the appearance. A good strong malt flavor overall, but alcoholic enough that you might want to just have one of these and then switch to something less potent..."
"Overall: I like the dark melanoidin malt profile and its sneaky strength. The phenols are spicy and compliment the malt very well. I'm a little worried about the lack of esters but don't really miss them. A great multi-faceted brew. Good job. Needs more dextrins for improved head."
"i've only had a couple of each, but i think i prefer this to the original aventinus weizenbock, perhaps because of the ridiculously high abv! i can only imagine having 1 at a time, but i enjoyed this time and look forward to the next."
"Poured into my Pils glass. A rush of carbonation bubbles race to the top but no head remains after the initial pour. Caramel, figs, plums and grapes are the main things I get from the first noseful. The malts dominate the the full body leaving a sweet syrupy and fruity finish. The alcohol only enters into the equation as it hits my stomach. At $3.00 a bottle this is a steal for what's inside."
"This seems to be a beer that opens up as you drink it, revealing more layers along the way, and I imagine that goes for subsequent samplings."
"Drinkability - Definitly not a session beer, has a pretty high alcohol content and rich taste so its a sipper. I dunno as I would buy another, I have had a couple other eisbocks I have enjoyed more at a lower price."
"A very nice beer for sippimg after dinner or on a cold winter day. Smooth and easy to sip."
"D: The density of the elements and the high alcohol content make this an excellent sipping beer for the winter months. A simple creation, when one considers its core tastes of brown sugar, rum, and plums. Yet its depth is its strength, each element heightened to an elegant extremity. Excellent for drinking while discussing seminal issues with good friends or pondering works of art alone in the semi-darkness."
"I guess I'll stick to the Weizenbock...and leave the eis zum die kuhle leute( sorrry, high school Deutsch many years ago)."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is limited by the 12% abv, but the ale is nicely balanced and the wheat adds a distinct taste."
"d - I could drink it til I drop. At 12% abv that might not take long. I intended for it to last longer than it did. Great beer for those ""special"" occasions --- like Wednesdays or Thursdays. Personally, I'm saving it for days ending in ""y""
"Drinkability - It's very tasty and I enjoy drinking it but I know one bottle an evening would pretty much be the max for me."
"Overall, the Eisbock is an experience for anyone wanting to try a very complex and enging beer. The beer is smooth to drink, almost syrupy, but the 12% will soon catch up to the palate. I strongly recommend trying the Aventinus Doppelbock first, then trying this sweet baby. That will give you a sense of the order of the process of making this beer as well. If you don't like the Aventinus, try the Eisbock anyway. If you don't like it, sorry I suggested it."
"Quite drinkable considering the big ABV. Just pace yourself or you'll wake up on the floor."
"Aroma is very sweet, with a bit of cooca and reolant with mature fruit, a tiny bit of banana in there too. Taste very full and complex, with plums and raisins mingling with caramely sweetness and a spicy hint of alcohol. Body is nicely full and the eisbock drinks dangerously smooth. Finish is sticky sweet with with a lingering touch of tartness. Very fulfilling beer, worthy of aging if you can hold on to it that long."
"The alcohol presence is very strong and aggressive which takes away from the drinkability. However, the complexities of flavor make this lager one to seek out."
"Drinkability: This made for a nice flavorful Eisbock in the beginning, but i think the strong alcohol presence aftertaste at the end kind of ruined it. But what do I expect from a beer with an alcohol content of 12%?"
"Very drinkable for the style, well balanced, and has unique licorice/molasses twist to the smooth aftertaste."
"I love the regular aventinus, the eisbock version is very good; it suryp-like, medicinal, and slightly burnt (at least this sample). I aroma is rich with concentrated malt and alchol, with hints of chocolate. the flavor is thick and full of carmelized malt with a burnt chocolate flavor that warms as it goes down."
"Now, I should mention that this one has been in my cellar for about a year and a half, so its a bit mellowed. In fact, Ive had fresher examples of this brew on several occasions and I can tell its quite a bit richer than my review might indicate. The nice thing about this one (and regular Aventinus as well) is that it combines wheat beer and eisbock/dopple-bock flavors, which is a combination ya dont find to often. Anyway, highly recommended."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is just as good as the rest of it. It is highly carbonated which perfectly complements the taste of the beer in my opinion.This beer is full bodied and, I believe leaves nothing to be desired in the way of mouthfeel. I would drink this all day if I could without getting alcohol poisoning but then I would become spoiled. I will definitely buy this one again, provided I can find it."
"Slick mouthfeel and surprisingly easy drinkability with the high abv. My first eisbock. I will definitely try more."
"Bottle number 040372. Beer poured out a burnt caramel color. Smells of yeast and banana, wonderful! Taste is caramelly with a strong presence of banana and various fruits. Mouthfeel is very syrupy and has an alcohol burn in the end, though not enough to take away from the beer. Drinkability is good, though I wouldn't want to have a lot. One is probably enough in a night."
"This was enjoyable but Ill need much more experience with Eisbocks to make a good judgment. Also this is a 12% beer, so not the kind of beer you want to down a 6er of. Give it a try anyhow, see what you think."
"The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, obviously. Lots of residuals stick to the palate. Finishes a bit dry. As far as eisbocks go, this is pretty much as drinkable as it can get."
"Body is medium, definately not dense enough for the carry the flavor well. Vigorous carbonation keeps the belches coming. Worth trying, but I'll take the regular version any day."
"Its 12 percent and you know it. Its quite unlike anything else german that I have had. Its pretty damed worth a try for beer geeks everywhere; it may be a notch below giant belgians, but damned close."
"My bottle had enough yeast in the bottom to dam a river, so be careful when pouring yours."
"-UF"
"This was an 11.2 oz bottle with a label date of 2002. Dark cola brown in color with a tall light tan head that left light streaks of lace. Very big fruitiness in the aroma, raisins mainly. Some syrupy molasses with a light chocolate note in there. More sweet dark ripe fruits in the flavor with some caramel. Light chocolate and some spiciness. Pretty interesting flavor with some other small things in there. Pretty thick but not as much so as other Eisbocks Ive had. Pretty drinkable stuff that I would like to try a younger version of."
"This is one strong looking brew. It pours a dark brown color. The head is massive, thick, and looks as though it could support the weight of the empty bottle on top of it. And it doesn't leave, rather it stays forever (must be the wheat). The aroma is of dark fruits, spices, caramel, and alcohol. The taste is of dark fruits and spices, with a strong alcohol burn in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a might fine brew for sipping."
"Drinkability: Great beer that holds eisbocks as one of the finest styles available in my mind. Not for the weak, but also could be enjoyed by many who enjoy ports and cognacs. Couldn't really see myself drinking this more than every once in a while because of the strength of it, but it is phenomenally smooth and soothing after a long day. Just be carefull; this one packs a mean wallop!"
"First drink floored me. Outstanding balance of flavor. Caramel was the most dominant flavor but it has some plumb, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee...ohhh yeah perfectly balanced. Big welcomed warming finish. For 12% this is well hidden though. Is there a better brewery for these types of beers on the planet? I haven't found it yet but I have lots of searching still ahead of me. What I've enjoyed in the two styles i've gobbled from this brewery is the rich, deep complexity and contrasts of flavor that they seem to thrive on, and pay particular attention to. Thanks."
"Very, very nice chestnut brown color. No real head. I have to knock it down a bit due to the floaters. This thing is way chunky!! I havnt had this much sediment in a beer in ages. Even after a few days of refrigeration and a careful pour. Good aroma-the banana and cloviness is subdued Im assuming by the eisbock process. Nice sweet malt in the backround of the aroma. Some banana and phenolic flavors but mellow and sedate. No hop bitterness. Good, soft malt flavor. A well done and well balanced sweetness. A slight trace of alcohol but not much. Very smooth body-amazing for 12%. An extremely enjoyable beer and dangerously drinkable."
"This is one huge, ass kicking beer. 2002 vintage poured into a widemouth DT glass. Caramel brown, head dissipates somewhat quickly but leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is spicy, loadoed with alcohol, some wine notes. Taste is rich, syrupy, very sweet and spicy with cloves and brown sugar making their way to your tastebuds. Lots of alcohol present, very warming. It would be great on a cold day. Drinkability is low however due to the pronounced alcohol content. Finishing one of these must be done patiently."
"A good beer to sip, perhaps in even less than the 11oz. bottle size. The flavors did not really provide that much for me. An enjoyable beer, but my first of the style. Perhaps, this is just not for my taste."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Bottle # 18995: Poured a dark ruby color with a small off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Wheaty, clove, and some banana in the aroma. Sweet caramel taste, pepper noted as well. Alcohol burn. Creamy mouthfeel, this was different but awesome!"
"Fairly smooth, moderate carbonation makes it easier to drink initially than the abv would suggest...although that alcoholic burn does come out and slow the pace considerably. Smoother as it warms, although the alcohol gets a bit more prominent, overpowering the malts. Thus, while I enjoyed it quite a bit, I can't say this would be a regular plunge. Probably very nice for keeping warm on a frosty day, which is when I'll be trying it next I'd imagine."
"Overall: Well worth the time, but I wont have another."
"This beer has a rich, heavy mouthfeel. Highly carbonated. Big-time warming effect. This is definitely one for sipping with the high ABV. This beer has vague similarities to Aventinus (IMHO), but if I tasted them blind I don't know that I could pick them out as relatives."
"This is a good beer to try, highly recommended. I just noticed it says ""12% abv"" - wow - this hides it very well at the colder temps, I was guessing 8 or 9%. If you see this, do give a bottle a try. But drink it cool, not warm."
" Aroma is rich and complex. Prunes, brown sugar, roasted malt, and a touch of wheat are enveloped by a huge alochol presence. Palate is similar to the nose - lots of roasted malt tempererd by a touch of wheat. Notes of dark fruit (prune, plum) and brown sugar followed by a huge alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is pleasant - thick, slightly syrupy, slightly chewy, and a little foamy if agitated. A slow-drinking pleasure - be sure to reserve the better part of your evening to enjoy this phenomenal beer."
"Opinion: This is a super nice beer for anybody that enjoys a lot of flavor in beer! I highly recommend it!"
"The color is a very hazy dark brown with big sediment chunks floating around near the bottom of my mug. The creamy head is average-sized and off-white. The aroma is a combination of the typical clovey hefeweizen smells and rich, fruity malt. The aroma profile is nice, but I was expecting a little stronger from an eisbock. The taste makes me think of a dunkleweizen on steroids. An initial strong attack of weisse flavors is joined by dark fruity malts. A bite of alcohol is noted, but the 12% is still covered pretty nicely. The malt flavors become more prevalent as the beer warms up and some of the initial strength of the phenols subsides. Strong, well-layered flavors are the highlight here. The malty finish seems to last forever and caps off a great beer with a flavorful reminder of the strong taste of Aventinus' Weizen-Eisbock. Highly recommended."
"Brown goo on the bottom of the cap. Pours a brownish/red color. Yeast in suspension is very chunky. Little to zero head. What bubbles are left are very small. Sweet, malty, phenolic nose. Alcohol smell. Strong alcohol in the taste. Very hot. Whiskey aftertaste. Yeasty. Does not change much as I drink. I could barely finish it and considered dumping it. I was hoping to get over the initial flavor shock and pick up hints of something. None to be found. My tongue could simply not get over the whiskey and yeast. How could something as wonderful as Aventinus be mutated into something like this? I am told it is the same recipe, just finished off in the Eisbock manner. It works for some other Eisbocks I have had, but for this one it completely stripped away the blend of flavors that make Aventinus great and replaced it with an unpleasant alcohol burn."
"Alcohol doesn't burn and makes this very drinkable, but 12% is a bit much for more than 1."
"Worth a try none the less. Seek it out if you can."
"Beer is good. Happy eisbock beering."
"Drinkable in a leisurely sort of way. Certainly true to style, this beer is a kick in the senses."
"12 ouncer sampled, bottle is now a new squarer shape...pours a rich and unusual slighly purple/brown color, moderate off white head and just a bit of lacing.Nose is quite fruity, plums, bananas, apricots. This is a strong, rich and flavorful sipper. Its heady and intoxicating @ 12%. Lovely, soft and warming on the tongue. Complex notes of more fruits, wood,alcohol, brandy, yeast and sweet Malt. Fine stuff, well worth a try."
"Bottle 023817. Pours a deep dark purplish brown with a thin head that immediately disappears leaving behind tiny carbonation bubbles hitting the surface. Smell is sweet caramael, molasses, raisins, plums, banana, and just a touch of spiciness. Taste is sweet and fruity upfront giving way to caramel, wheat, and oak flavors and an alcoholic spicy finish. Hops aren't really detectable, but they must be there since the sweetness stays in check and never becomes cloying. Mouthfeel is full bodied, slick and mildly carbonated--great for sipping. This is a really nice beer---extremely drinkable and tasty for it's alcohol."
"Bottle 2004/13385. Pours smokey/hazy cola, with minimal head, but a smattering of bubbles rising from the bottom. Diminuitive head. Nose is molasses/prunes/dark fruits, perhaps a touch of white grapes as it warms... Taste hits with dark fruits/prunes, sweet malts. No hop bitterness, just enough to offset some of the sweetness. Mouthfeel is moderate, slick. It dries at the finish, with alcohol making its presence known throughout."
"I was thinking that wheat would be a big playere here, with this billed a weizen eisbock. Well, i didn't find it to be that exactly. I didn't pick up on wheat in the nose. No worries though. This was a steal at 3 bucks a pop."
"Most of my favorite beers are of ordinary strength, but every now and then I'll find a big beer of such complexity and flavor that I can't deny it its rightful place. This is such a beer. Absolutely wonderful!"
"Bottle number ""2004 / 06223"""
"WTF is up with this one? Excellent Eisbock  thank you bottle number 043924 in 2005!! An easy pour produced a clear amber brown chalice with a massive ivory tan head that laced my glass. Swirl this one and the aroma will come alive with fruits, orange, clove and malts, which also came through in the tastes  along with grains and intense apricots. Extremely full bodied and chewy, the 12% would drop your ass if you quaff in a hurry. Makes a perfect sipping drink after dinner, just like one would do with a fine brandy. Im addicted, put some in the cellar and enjoy! Most unforgettable brew to-date."
"Drinkability-I would definitely have another one, however due to high ABV I would limit it to only 1 per night"
"Poured into a snifter. Dark purply brown, near black, with no head. Sure there were bubbles, but I blinked and they're gone. Malty, fruity nose, some spices that my olfactory inventory lacks and therefore I'm unable to name. Like a rum cake. Taste is malt, carbonic bite, and more malt in a bath of alcohol. Lovely. I like this one. Pours down the gullet a little too easily for me to be comfortable with at 12%. Tasty. I paid $3.79 for a 330ml bottle. Worth every penny."
"Poured a dark caramel almost Coke like color into the glass. Big fruity somewhat fermented like bouquot. No head whatsoever to speak of. Very minimal lacing as well. Has a tart grape like taste upfront finishing with serious licorice aftertones. Presents a medium and effervescent mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer. Again, definitley a sipper due to the high alcohol content."
"Poured a dark cloudy brown brew with a tan head that dropped immediatly upon pouring. Vigorous streams of CO2 run up the sides of my tulip glass. The aroma is magnificent rich in banana and a touch of clove with a sweet malt and alcohol that blends so well it reminds me of the perfume of an exotic flower. The taste is sweet and syrupy with a dry wheat malt flavor balanced by a sweet carmalized malt flavor that balance very well. The finish is very warming and full of alcohol and clove flavors also linger. The mouthfeel is viscous and the high carbonation lends a crispness that adds a clean refreshing quality. Very drinkable to the point of being dangerous due to the very high alcohol. This beer is stronger than some table wines so definetly drink in moderation."
"Notes: Very thick body, with a thin finish. Probably due to the high alcohol. The regular Aventinus is better tasting, but this is still very good. Really warms you up."
"Drinkability: For me, bad. It's just too boozy, too hot, too saturated -- it's just too much."
"Poured a hazy, dark brown body, with some sediment. Aroma of bananas, clove and tonnes of spices. A masterpiece IMO. Alcohol is deceptive, and this is quite a quaffable beer in my opinion. Fruity, estery and has a nice wheat backbone. Definitely recommended."
"This is a 2001 bottle #08519. Appearance wise, the head died down immediately, but I do have a deep rich brown brew to sup. The initial upfront carbonation has died down as the beer has warmed. Aromawise, there's the anticpated rich maltiness, but I am picking up some woody notes as well. I am also getting some banana notes as well. Tastewise, it's best to let the beer warm up a bit from the fridge. Initially I thought there were some sharp edges to the flavors. Now the mouthfeel is well lubricated from the alcohol, it sort of surrounds the whole taste experience. I get low flavor at the start, and then the malt hits. It's a bit hard to describe, but it's sort of toffee meets brown bread. Finish is a bit wheat beer banana-ey."
"Tastes incredible! Golden syrup melts off the tongue with clove oil tingles. Sharp bitterness, alcohol warmth throughout, and an alcohol bite as it goes down. Very fruity throughout. Brandied cherries. Buttery and almost flaky like a strudel."
"D- Very nice big wheat beer that has a big alcohol warmth to support it. It also has a nice maltyness to support the wheat and the alcohol. Even without a hop presents this beer has a nice complexity and a wonderful taste."
"The beer pours a hazy dark ruby red/brown color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that fades to lacing. There are loads of yeast floaties present. The aroma is good. It has a dry and warm wheat and crystal malt scent. It has clove aroma and a slight yeast fruitiness. The taste is good. It has a rich and flavorful malt taste that goes down smooth and finishes warm and fruity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine eisbock. It is warm and flavorful; an excellent drinking wheat beer."
"When it comes to ice beers, this is the real deal."
"Drinkability and Overall: While not being my favorite Eisbock, this is a unique and interesting intepretation of the style. The addition of wheat is enjoyable, but as beneficial as I had hoped. But still, it's a quality beer and a good choice."
"Thanks to Horst for this one!"
"Out of this 11.2 oz., bottle numbered, beer poured a cloudy, rusty brown, ruby hightlighted Eisbock. To the light it yield a clear true garnet. The short head quickly ancored to a dusting of swirl and edge which for the first third of the beverage left a lace. Initially the nose was of a South American dark chocolate which soon came into its boldness of Bananas Foster. This is a malty, sweet, concentrated nose of mashed ripe banana, a tropical compliment, clove, and etoh. The medium to big mouthfeel found a slight syrup to the roof of the mouth with much body and texture. Soft, smooth, creamy come to heart. Fruit of the nose, fig, and clove were right upfront. A soft hop comes up to lend some presence to the finish. Lingering is a nice carmalized, almost burnt, malt. Afterwards I felt the yeast as it touched my throat. For the last 2/3rd's there was no lace, just the etoh riding the curves of the Rapsacallion chalice, slowly, delibertly. The 12 ABV was balanced well; carbonation was perfect for this selection. I found this Weisen-bock not particularly complex, but it was rich, creamy and a sheer delight to enjoy this day. This is a belly warming brew."
"I was much more impressed with the Eisbock than the weizenbock. Very complex, very rewarding. I'd like to hide a few bottles from myself and give 'em a whack down the road. Thanks for the sample Joe!"
"Bottle Number 124960. A good looking dark brown beer with some clarity. Its vanilla colored head gives up sweet spicy aromas, as well as caramel sweetness and the wheat, yeast and big alcoholic flavor with grainy wheat and cloves, raisin/prune vinous complexity, sweet bread. Very drinkable for 12 %. Ice and Fire we will return to this again!"
"this is a delicious, strong winter beer. sweet caramel overpowers any of the original aventinus wheatiness. a true accomplishment and one that must be savoured."
"In all honesty, I prefer the standard version, but this is a nice diversion."
"Poures a hazy brown/amber with a nice blooming fluffy head,great aromas of cinnamon and clove with a little smokiness in there along with some lighter caranel notes.Big flavors picked up alot of cinnamon upfront with some caramel and dried fruit along with some late smokiness.Wow what can you say about this brew smooth as it gets going down sweet but not overly so,I will go back to this one sometime to be sure."
"Transparent caramel/amber color with an off-white two finger head on top which reduced to a thin layer. Smell is loaded with bananas and tangerine with hints of clove. Aroma also has some fruit esters consisting of hints of raisin. The alcohol is almost totally hidden with only a slight nuance of it coming to prominence as the beer warms. Taste is of banana puddingso mainly banana flavors with bread and vanilla wafer undertones. Also a slight spiciness makes this beer initially sharp on the tongue. Most of the reviews mentioned the alcohol content being prominent, but I just dont see it. If anything I think it adds to the sweetness of this beer. Mouthfeel is good as well, but not the most notable portion of this one. Too bad I dont have any more of these. Ill have to pick up another on the next trip to the store."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly cloudy dark brown color with lots and lots of yeast chunks everywhere. There is no lacing on the glass. The smell has lots of roasted malt character, with some caramel sweetness and a hint of alcohol. The taste is also very sweet, with lots of caramel and toffee, some dark fruit, and just enough alcohol to warm you up nicely. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkability suffers some from the 12%, but this is still a damn tasty brew from Schneider & Sohn."
"Certainly different and not for the faint of heart. Might go down better paired with food, I suspect something cheesy or blood-rare. An acquired taste, and one I probably wouldn't recommend. Just not my thing."
"A cloudy, dark brown beer sports a small, grayish-beige head. The beer is chock full o' flakes. The nose is spicy, tangy, fruity and very yeasty. Front is sweet and spicy, really dominated by yeast. The middle is an intense, syrupy malt, setting up a spicy, tangy, alcohol finish. Wow. This is an intense, tangy, fruity, yeasty beer. Aventinus on steroids."
"Drinkable? Need you ask? This is the digestif of beers. The dessert tray stands untouched save for some cheese and fresh fruit. One has little need of anything else."
"An 11.2 oz. volcano of a bottle, #019171. After the beer stopped foaming out the top of the bottle, it poured with a small head on top of purple/maroon colored beer. Smells malty and sweet, and also slightly vinous/ Tons of alcohol in the taste, with tart berry flavors abounding, and malty bread flavors. Slick and oily in the mouthfeel, and a assload of alcohol burn, good carbonation."
"Recommended"
"a barleywine tempered by the taste of some wheat and over-the-top barley. This is not an ice-filtered weizen. Barleywine aroma and colour. The original Eisbock? Well that's something, although I thought that happened in the WWI transportation to the Kraut troops."
"This beer pours a brown color with very little head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma was very weak, but alcohol comes through well here. The flavor had a lot of alcohol in it as well, but it has a raisin sweetness. The mouthfeel is pretty thick on this one, but the alcohol character is too upfront and unmasked."
"Very dark brown with much red and little gold. Beige head vanished within seconds. The nose was extremely yeasty and the alcohol content was obvious. Lots of caramel with some burnt wood also. Tasted of coffee grounds and severe alcohol. A challange for me to drink because of the alcohol content, but not bad at all to taste. Spices mixed with carbonation and alcohol make this a helluva kicker going down! Semi-sweet aftertaste."
"This beer pours a nice brown color with a small head that flals to lightly ring the beer. The nose is rather light, with some raisin coming through, but lots of alcohol hit me as well. The flavor is full of raisins, but also a very strong alcohol character that isn't hidden by the malts at all. The feel is very thick. Drinkability is just okay. I am not a real big fan of this beer. Its not bad, but still not good."
"This is a good Eisbock no doubt, but my money is spent on the Kulmbacher Eisbock though"
"poured a deep garnet-blood red that is hazy in the center and a thin head that dissappears completly after a bit. winey/vinious aroma with alcohol and the german wheat beer aroma lying underneath it, estery and bubblegummy. good amount of carbonation that cuts through a little too much of the decent body on this beer. a thickish wheat beer upfront in the taste followed by a spicy phenolic finish with a good amount of alcohol. I couldn't even finish this though, either wasn't up to it/or couldn't. I was hoping for this to be better than what it was...worth a try at least."
"Overall, I found myself liking this beer the more I sipped. The alcohol content isn't subtle by any stretch and that limits this beer a bit. However, it was a nice late night relaxing beer that will ensure that Santa's reindeer crashing onto my rooftop won't roust me from the blissful slumber I will soon embark on once I finish this beer."
"12 oz single from Red Wagon (Rochester, Michigan) obtained and consumed in December 2004. Poured in a manner to retain the sediment in the bottle. Copper brown that is mildly cloudy and a thin head that quickly settled to a thin ring around the glass. Smells primarily of alcohol and perhaps some spice from noble hops (Saaz?). The taste is sweet alcohol and some bock character. The alcohol sting stays thoughout and after really searching beneath it, I could pick out some othe flavors. There was a hint of clove and, oddly, a hint of cocoa. Mouthfeel was medium-thick and carbonation was moderate. This bock wasn't 'bock' enough for me and the alcohol was just way too much. I'd like to recommend Kulmbacher as a much better representation of the style."
"Yes yes yes."
"Deep caramel with a very vigorous, thick light tan head. Sweet candy and caramel tones on the nose. Rich wheat also noticable. Lots of tropical esters, dark wheat, and candy tones dominate the palate. Very thick and concentrated flavors on the palate. Thick and coating mouthfeel. Almost syruplike texture. An intersting version of a world-class beer. Always worth a try, but definately not an everyday brew."
"Rather clear brown hue with ruby hints, bottle-conditioned with a few floaties around. Aroma is indeed reminiscent of an aventinus in the breay malt profile and gentle spiciness + plummy and banana fruitiness, but the difference lies in the heating factor. The eisbock is quite alcoholic and sweeter. In mouth, wheat chunks are to be found playing around with lovely aventinus flavours, but its very heating which makes it less friendly on a sunny day. Dark ripe fruits and pancake syrup character is quite appealing, but this remains vastly inferior to the regular to me, although I prefer the lower level of carbonation in here."
"I had no idea what to expect from this one, and had no clue that I was going to be drinking something 12% ABV. Pours a dark red like black cherry. Fizzy white head quickly disappears. Aroma is of tart fruit, almost like a soured belgian ale. The flavor is of Black cherry, banana and spice with a dose of yeast and a warm alcohol, along with slight chocolate in the background . Similarities to hefeweizens are there but with more of a strong belgian or barleywine character. Incredibly smooth and rich, this is very easy to drink and a highly recommended beer."
"The reddish brown body was clouded with oodles of yeast. The initial fizz of carbonation was cola like, and the resulting head did not last. The latent carbonation was soft and steady. The aroma was mostly alcohol with some red cherries thrown in the mix. The wheat based origin of the beer was not quite evident on the nose, as there was nary a hint of banana. The taste was again quite different than the unfrozen Aventinus, with the front and center flavor being peppery spiciness. The fruitiness showed up in the form of rum raisins, licorice, and plum. There was some evidence of oxidized character in the form of tobacco juice like bitterness. The hops only provided an aromatic floral background with minimal bitterness. This beer is much closer to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, than a Weizenbock that it started as. The alcohol is more concentrated than the non frozen version and it does not hide quite as well. Very warming and spicy, but a bit harsh. As a result, the drinability takes a hit."
"The taste is unimaginable. I mean it. You have to try it, because reading about it does you no good. It is at once aggressive and caressing. It is cloying -- pure chocolaty, malty, dark fruit death. Then it changes to banana, and plenty of it. Then it introduces a hint of soy sauce. Have you ever had bananas Foster? Liquify it, drink it, and you'll get an idea. The mouthfeeel is luxurious, the drinkability better than it should be for such a high ABV. Both times this was my finishing beer in a night full of German brews, and both times, it marked my demise. Respect it or pay the consequences."
"Lovely in its intensity. Can't move through this quickly. I like that malt intensity without it being cloy."
"Pours frothingly into a tulip glass with it's large off-white head receding to 2 fingers while guarding the deep amber liquid. Huge aroma of bannana and other fruits with just a slight hint of alcohol. Taste hides the alcohol remarkably well. It does warm as it is going down the throat though. Mouthfeel was slightly sticky. Definetely an interesting beer and style, one which I will try to sample more."
"Surprisingly drinkable for a high alcohol brew...this one could be dangerous."
"Almost reminded me of the sports drink Orbit when I first took a look at it. I recomend that everyone hold it up to a light after they pour themselves a glass. This beer is a cross between Kwak and a Banana daquieri. A good level of carbonation makes it easy going down, which is good because you can really taste the booze. But the alcohol flavor works well with the fruity flavor of the beer itself, so it doesn't detract from the easy of drinking."
"Poured a cloudy reddish brown, with a finger and a half or so thick sandy-offwhite head that dissipated into a thick haze over the surface. Real nice lacing. The smell is very powerful of banana and cloves. I didn't get any vanilla out of this, but I damn sure smelled a lot of banana and a lot of cloves. The taste, too, seemed almost exclusively these two things. Exceptionally spicy. This one also makes no secret about its 12%abv, either. It's right up front and you know it the whole way down. Very warming. Perhaps august in Atlanta isn't the ideal time of year to drink this one. Maybe closer to Christmas this would be more appropriate. Still real good, though. This stuff is also really thick and almost seems to leave a thin coating in your mouth. Very good. Very smooth. Will definately buy this one again."
"Incredibly drinkable and intense. Only the cost and rarity prevent me from having this as often as I like."
"Overall: Its like imbibing Liquid Alcoholic Bananas at times, way, way, way over the top but I dearly love it!!! Fantastic!"
"This is the less appealing cousin of the great Aventinus Wheat Beer. The taste of the malt and alcohol overwhelms some of the fruit tastes and other flavors, making this a less drinkable beer than regular Aventinus. Still, it's a complex and rich brew, well worth trying."
"This beer is not tiresome nor too sweet and will have me coming back for more!"
"Poured into a snifter glass. Pours a dark chocolaty brown with some ruby highlights. Minimal head. Smell is of chocolate, brandied fruits, spicecake, and a touch of caramel. Alcohol is evident in the nose. Taste is like Aventinus on steroids. All the lovely clovey spice and cocoa flavours are concentrated. Alcohol is clearly present in each sip, but not overpowering like in DFH WWS. Mouthfeel is smooth albiet a bit heavy. Drinkability is good but not great. It makes a great after dinner drink and goes well with strong dessert cheeses. A great weizen eisbock!! Snuggle up with this on a cold windy winter night and you wont be sorry."
"Drinkability: Be carefull with this one as the alcohol is high. Take it slowly and just enjoy every second."
"Well, this is more of a winter beer than a summer one, but it's still enjoyable. A very portish quality to this one, and though it doesn't quite improve on the Aventinus, it's definitely a nice sipper and I hope to have this one this winter."
"11.2oz bottle: This one is fizzy when pouring, but almost no head resulted from it. The color is an opaque brown, with a tinge of red. It has a wonderful aroma. A very fruity nose, with hints of caramel, yeastiness, and a hint of the alcohol. A thick, yet subtle palate of fruits and caramel. Some of the alcohol is evident in the taste. A bit of the wheat come through also. It also seems to fizz a little in your mouth. Very Nice!"
"Tan 1/2"" head over a dark brown brew, and laced admirably. Deep grainy aroma, with alcohol character apparent. Flavor indicates a chewy wheat brew with hearty consistancy. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent for the style."
"Malty, caramel, rum, and plumbs all mix together in the aroma. Fizzy, soda-style, light brown colored head disappeared after a minute leaving only a ring of bubbles around the surface of the beer. Yeasty banana flavor quickly overrun by a sweet caramel malt flavor which fades just as the alcohol warms the stomach. Dark brown colored beer with an amber hue. Lots of large floaties of varying shapes, which would worry me in any other beer. Definitely a beer to be enjoyed at cellar temperature. On the sweet side, but there are plenty of interesting flavors in there. A big, strong, malty beer."
"The eisbock version of Aventinus has more doppelbock qualities and less weissbier qualities than its original cousin. You definitely have to be prepared for this beer or it will knock you for a loop. I noticed some of the bottles at the store just had the number on it and no year. I picked up the dated one, and after two years of ""store-cellaring"" this brew was fabulous. Be prepared when drinking this one."
"Taste is very nice, smoke, malt, nutty(?), wheat. Warming as it goes down. Very complex and nicely balanced. Very nice aftertaste. A full-bodied, smooth, lightly effervescent beer that I could drink all day long, if my publican could keep it in stock, and I could remain conscious. :)"
"A taste of Marichino cherries soaked in rum, mingles with citrusy and spicy flavors. A big alcohol blast and taste of cloves begin to dominate as it warms. This is a big and dangerous brew!"
"This may have been a bad bottle. Poured out a brownish-amber color with very little head and lots of yeast in there. Looks like a thick brew, the yeast just stays still everywhere in the glass. Smell consisted of malts, carmael, bubble gum, a little fruity notes also hits the nose. Taste consisted of figs, caramel, malty, spiciness as well, with a touch of sweetness that shows up at the end. Blended well together. Mouthfeel was nothing to worry about as well, full bodied beer and also creamy. May have been a little outdated, but the taste held up nicely."
"Medium brown with a few scattered floaties and very little head after the initial pour. Aroma is sweet and a bit spicy with a fair bit of alcohol evident. Taste is surprisingly good. Sweet and malty with plum and raisin. A touch syrupy, but with the high ABV you won't be chugging it."
"Really impressed...but also really glad I split the bottle with my roommate."
"This brew has no head, is a cloudy, murky brown color, with huge chunks of yeast floating about. Lovely bubblegum, wheat scent. Syrupy mouthfeel, loads of sweet malt, wheat flavors. Alcohol bite noticeable. Bubblegum flavors, banana, cloves. This is an intense beer."
"Pours out to a murky dark brown, forming an large-marge, poofy light tan head with excellent retention and average lacing. Flittering bits of particulate and flocculant yeast settle to the bottom and rise again. Swamp soup. Thick layer of yeast on the bottom of the bottle. Carbonation is moderately strong, ~3 carbs. Aroma is bursting with fruit....raw apple cider, black cherries, a whallop of cloves, bananas in bushels, yeast. Mmmmm, mmmm. Mouthfeel is effervescent which hides it's dense body with a slick, non-cloying finish despite it's alcohol strength and body. Meshuggenah. Taste is like Aventinus with 'roid-rage. Amygdala overload. Firm alcohol presence is Mixolocrian...Sticky sweet malts in 3/2 hemiola cacophony over 5/4 silk chanteuse. Smoldering finish tills the cows come home. Toffee, caramel, banana, clove, raisins, dates, brandy...a sublime punch in the face. Rzzz! Weasels ripped my nads! I think me likes...me likes! The cat's pyjamamamas."
"Tasty! Quite sweet up front, ginving way to bannanas & a pleasant dose of cloves. Plums & raisins bounce around before the whole thing dries out & finishes rather cleanly. Throat wamrs slightly, but the high alcohol is well masked. Thick, syrupy, easy carbonation."
"Drinkability  I felt like a king drinking this bottle. What an amazing example of this unique and often overlooked style."
"This review may be a little skewed from the beer being sampled after the Whiskey-barrel aged Dogwood Winter, but it's still a good beer. That being said, the original is really better. The head could be better, it was a little weak. The body was a dark, dull brown that was quite cloudy. Tons of overripe banana and overripe apples along with a richness to the malt that's not present in the pre-iced version (the richness is nice, but the yeast-fruit flavors in the regular Aventinus are more refined). You feel the alcohol more than you taste it. It warms the stomach and lightens the head. If you drive to the bar alone, it's perhaps best not to combine this with the Dogwood Winter barrel-aged. Luckily, I had my wife to drive me home."
"Pours a hazy, deep purple-amber color that is topped by a tan head. Aromas of deep fruit, banana, and a bit of alcohol are found in the nose. The taste is sweet, and the beer has quite a light body despite being concentrated. The alcohol is found starting in the middle and going through the finish of this beer. There does not seem to be enough beer here to stand up to the alcohol. There are some nice notes of clove, a hint of banana, and concentrated fruit (raisin is dominant). As it warms up a bit the body becomes smoother and creamy, though the astringent alcohol remains in the finish. Overall this was just a bit disappointing, the ice-concentration left this beer a bit unbalanced, though it is still pretty good."
"Deadly smooth for its 12% abv"
"This stuff is fierce."
"Beef Notes: I was interested in this one, as I like Aventinus, but it turned out to be just plain disappointing, though I was into it at first. I don't think I'll be coming back."
"I had to wait for almost 6 months to get a case of this stuff from my local store and it was worth the wait. The best part about buying in quantity is being able to drink 2 in a row."
"Big alcohol up front. Smooths into malty wheat and really yeasty. Spicy. Cloves shoine through and banana not as evident. Rich maltiness throughout. Rich malty aftertaste that lingers sticky on the palate. The bit of alcohol burn in this one brings down the drinkability but still a nice beer. Happy to cellar the others for now."
"This is a wicked brew, chock full of flavors. It pours a dark muddy brown with yeast floaties and a tall stiff head that thins out gradually. The beer smells awesome, rich roasted and caramel notes, deep nuts and candied fruits, sugary rich malt and nutty yeast aromas. The flavors are thick and layered baked apples and cinniman, clove, nuts, plums and, oh yeah alcohl on the back end. This is a beer that should be savored slowly to appreciate the layers of complex flavors. The mouthfeel was chewey and rich with well balanced carbonation. A tsaty beeer indeed"
"The primary flavors to me are wheat and hops. There is an undercurrent of citrus, but it is not a real aromatic beer. The taste is a divine mix of wheat, hops, and a sweetness that appears to come from a fruity (citrus?) undertaste. This could be an addictive beer if it was actually available at more locations. Unfortunately, in the Philadelphia area, as far as I know, Ludwig's is it, although I haven't tried the Austrian Garden, yet."
"Extremely carbonated, the 11.2oz beer overflowed my 14oz pilsner glass faster than you can say Weizen-Eisbock. The head soon completely disappeared. I swirled the last oz of beer in the bottle and poured the yeast into my glass. The beer has a light brown/red cloudy appearance. The nose is full of raisins, the typical hefeweizen esthers (cloves/bananas) and a touch of alcohol. Taste is malty and fruity with a definite alcohol finish. The alcohol kick in the finish cuts down on drinkability a bit. Otherwise an excellent beer; perfect for a cold winter night."
"Whoaaa this beer is not for wimps. One of the few beers I've had that began to bubble out of the bottle after I cracked the crown off it. Pretty damn carbonated, but once it's poured out of the bottle it seems to lose much of it. Brown body with a lot of yeast sediment even before I pour out the entire bottle. Very nice dark fruity aroma with strong notes of clove and spices. Amazingly the alcohol is hardly noticeable in the nose. Has very vinuous flavors with a rich malt profile to back up the wallop of alcohol in the finish. I'm really surprised how strong the alcohol is in the taste while the aroma gives no hint of this. This beer actually made my eyes water upon the first sip. It is quite warming. Mouthfeel is superbly smooth and actually a bit dry. I would want to drink this all night, but it probably isn't a good idea. This is one, however, I would love to keep in permanent supply."
"The first time I had this, I did not know what to expect. I had had regular Aventinus many times and I had to try this when I saw it on the menu. This beer has an aroma quite similar to regular Aventinus but I sensed more of a chocolatey smell as well as more of a sense of alcohol. Aventinus itself, is a strong beer, 8% but this is 12-13%. It is much thicker than Aventinus and provides much more of a kick. The presence of a higher alcohol content is definitely noticeable and takes away a bit from the experience. I don't recommend anyone having more than two of these in a relatively short period of time. Still, with all this said, it has a very good flavor and is worth trying."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Bottle number 13049, 2002."
"Alcohol is so obvious, and the sweetness is so sickening, I don't know if I'll be able to finish the bottle."
"Notes: What a great combination of flavors in this beer. It's like a wheat beer that has been involved in some bizarre beer-changing experiment. The result is a very enjoyable beer that I really savored and enjoyed. Very well-done."
"11.2 oz bottle with classy purple and silver label. Pours a hazy dark brown with no head and no lacing. Aroma is striking, with dark fruits like plums and figs, a touch of molasses, and a hint of a high abv. Mouthfeel is thick, well carbonated, and a tad vinous. Taste is enormous. Dark fruits and molasses in the forefront, some fermented grapes, and a nice malt backbone. Finishes sweet and wheaty. Characteristics of an excellent Bavarian doppelbock, like Celebrator. Very satisfying and highly complex. So good, it oughta be illegal."
"Very drinkable for such a strong beer. I prefer the regular Aventinus."
"Only my second of the style-my first being the Kulmbacher which I warmed up to slowly. This bottle poured a deep chestnut and was just loaded with beer diamonds-way to much chunckage. I poured it through a fine mesh strainer and returned it to its glass. Stil lots of crunchy bits afloat. The head was marginal and subsided to a mini ring. The lacing was moderate. Aromas were very melon like, with a streak of blue cheese.The alcohol ripped through my sinus cavity and left traces of banana malteds as it did. In the mouth the beer is thick and indeed very warming as the alcohol makes itself known and is not shy at all. Flavors are deep and blown over by the high alcohol levels. Melon, raisin, some nutiness- Roquefort cheese flavors chime in loudly. Some sweet milky chocolate and of course, rich malted flavors surface and prove quite pleasurable as the beer warms, and as the taster warms! Sit back, relax and make sure you have the following day slotted for a late sleep in."
"Bottle 007787 11.2 oz- Deep cloudy dark chestnut color with some burnt reddish hints in its highlights, a nice tannish head appeared puffy and whipped tight becoming crusty but faded fast to a thick fluffy ring around the edge, lace in fast drippy sheeting. Holy phenolic nose with alcohol! Some major band-aid plastic and vitamin coating phenols flying all around a big ethanol heated alcoholic smack, with hints of some dark fruits and malty sweetness that can be sensed just before the alcohol or after a long time of off the rim sniffing. Taste is very nice and malty sweet with nice subtle complexities. A good load of fruityness both ripe and dried variants that contain some plum, raisin, and dates and there's a wonderful caramel smoothness coming into the finish lingers some; but that start is quite complex in the wheats, malts, and fruits with a pleasant mesh of everything. The midway point has a good little hop bitterness and building point which then lightly soothes out to a nice mellow finish of caramel which is very congenial and has some nice little agreeable plastic yeasty notes that never overwhelm as so does the alcohol which sits behind it all waiting to take charge upon bigger gulps and slightly burn with a spiced alcohol. Feel is pretty thick and chewy, nearly full, smooth for sure with a favorable creamyness and alcoholic edgeyness in its finish. Smooth drinking, but watch for that eye drooping alcohol, I'm sleepy...What a nice brew. Nose was a bit much on the plastic, but the flavors and ABV make up for it; head swimmingly delicious!"
"Worth diving into once in a while. I think it would be hard to put down more than one of these at a time."
"John"
"Pours brown, with a reddish hue. It forms a chunky, tan head. The aroma is of wheat, chocolate, biscuity/toasty malts, and a bit of fruit. It has a nice solid malt backbone. The flavor is malty and toasty, a bit sweet, with a dark fruit, fig-like flavor. it finishes sweet and malty with a bit of alcohol warmth. It is full-bodied and warming; a very enjoyable beer on a cold winters night."
"For a 12% brew, this is impeccibly drinkable, on par with many of the other high abv greats from Belgium, Unibroue, etc. I've got 2 more of these in the back of the closet chilling out. I want to see what they're like in 2006."
"I had this one a few nights ago and whoa! This is an intense and amazing brew. Obivously it tastes similar to Aventinus except all of the flavors are much more intense. Strong alcohol content isn't noticed until the finish but it has a hard kick. Lots of complex flavors that are concentrated down here. A must try!"
"Sweet fruity wheat nose with strong yeast notes. Decent tan head on the pour with some light brown floaties in the center of the glass. This head leaves quickly. Iced tea appearence there after with lots of yeast floaters. Fruity sweeter initial taste with a quick big ABV blast follows quickly. The finish leaves plum skin and tropical fruit on the tongue. The ABV is not as hidden as I thought it would be. The mouth is quite thick and its finish is dry on the tongue and moist and wet on the roof of the mouth and throat."
"Was surprised to come back to Australia and find out they had started to import this. Really nice beer. Lots of vanilla, chocolate, banana, wheat, yeast. Smooth soft palate, with some alcohol in the finish. Quite pleasant to drink, especially for its strength, yummy!!"
"I believe the term decadent is listed in the dictionary with a picture of this beer next to it. I don't know what the alcohol is on this beer, but i was definitely feeling the 10oz I got of it. Oh so drinkable, like the best milkshake you've ever had, but the alcohol definitely sets some limits."
"Mmmmm... Poured out a brown type brown at Anam Cara. This tastes like a belgium, but more like the German taste occurs to the mouth. a touch sweetandquite the bit spicy. Eisbock all the way; this one knows who is the boss of the night. Advantage Eisbock when trying to take the score."
"If you want a beer that makes some noise as you pour, this is it. A constant hissing during the pour and after, as the head gradually recedes. It is a deep and hazy garnet colored beer. A hefty cream colored head layers the top. Nice retention is noted. The nose consists of licorice, fusel alcohols, taffy and sweet, carmelized malts. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light and airy and effervescent. Flavors consist of molasses, black licorice, ethanol, dark malts and freshly ground black pepper. This beer has got some character."
"Basically the beer is nice and easy drinking. It sort of tastes like a cross between celbrator dobblebock and a dunkelweis. But deffinatly be careful, this is a 12% alcohol beer that'll sneak up on you and knock you on your ass."
"Wow, this beer is off the charts, one of a kind taste. strong clove, wheat, bannana, gum, and yeast flavors followed by a little alcohol bite, and a bananna gum kinda aftertaste. I am a fool to try to reduce this beer to words. This is a true classic, the numbered bottles really kick ass."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Aug 4th, 2003: Pours a dark amber-brown with a medium beige head and thin lacing. Pours a dark brownish-amber with a medium beige head and thin lacing. Aroma of sweet cherry, banana and cloves. Kind of rich, with a strong malt and alcohol presence over the wheat. This style is still somewhat of a mystery to me. Like a cross between malt liquor and a Weiss? The alcohol is very noticeable throughout. The finish is malty and fruity (plum). Definitely worth a return visit."
"Thanks Evan."
"Poured a lovely, massive tan head with a rich brown cloudy beer underneath. Nice aroma of cloves, raisin and banana. Flavour was of slight plum and banana and banana and banana. Way too much banana! I love the original Aventinus but the banana flavour in this was far too overpowering! I will try another bottle or two this week to see if I can prove myself wrong."
"This is fantastic if you like sweet beers. I do not so I was left a little cold. Opaque brown body, refined small bubbles. Large head. Sweet rye bread aroma. Taste of alcohol and rye bread. Sweetness pretty disturbing. It would be hard to believe if I found they had not brewed this in cinamon casks. Smooth mouthfeel with the elegant bubbles tickling. The flavor of this beer rocks, but I cannot get over the sweetness and the high alcohol."
"This brew poured a large invigorated head of creamy light brown small to medium sized bubbles with an opaque brown body. The head lasted a fairly long time but left no lacing. It has a mild malty aroma with a hint of its high alcohol content. It also has a ery strong burnt roast flavor without the smoke. You can feel the alcohol hit even after the first couple of tastes. Not a brew you can drink too many of in a sitting. I agree with an earlier post about the high alcohol content tingle this brew produces. I think I would prefer a smoother beer without this tingle."
"Note: I rate high ABV beers that hide their alcohol content well, with a high drinkability, despite the fact I could not drink several in one evening."
"A dark, deep brown brew with a tanish fizzy head that died quick. The aroma hit me before I had even poured half of the beer. Tropical fruits with a heavy dose of banana and cloves fill my nose along with sinus clearing alcohol fumes. Taste is heavy on fruity cloves and alcohol, though the alcohol is welcome and seems like it belongs. There is also a heavy bready malt backbone..nice. Mouthfeel is good at first with a nice chewy quality, but it turns quite syrupy in the slighly medicinal aftertaste. Drinkability suffers from this. Drinkablity is something I love about the original Aventinus so I'm a bit dissapointed. Even at 12 % this could have been better in that department. A good beer nonetheless"
"a bold attack on the senses...the perfect nightcap...just the thing to knock me out and send me to Slumberland."
"Quite an interesting beer to look at. Thick head with fine bubbles. Firm head, too. The beer looks like a mix of caramel and butterscotch. Looks a little like real cider, too. Chunkies float around, unsure whether to sink or float to the top. Highways of bubbles run up to keep the head full. I could just watch this beer for hours. But I think I'll smell it. Smells like rich wheat, but sweeter. Tastes much like it smells, but feels thicker, yet still lively. The chunkies are still going crazy and the lacing is fantastic. I can taste some apples and pears as well. Very drinkable beer, too, despite the obviously high alcohol content."
"After initially trying this beer and having recently consumed a different bottle, I thought a re-review was in order. This sample comes from bottle Number 009466. This beer could be referred to as Aventinus Weizenbock on steroids. It pours a thick ruby-tinged amber color with a creamy beige head. Chunks of yeast float in the dark, hazy liquid. Typical weizen notes are presented in the bouquet -- clove, banana, and yeast -- and are complemented by a sweet date character. Taste features more of the same, with notes of figs and a subtle hint at the strong alcohol content of 12% abv. Speaking of which, this brew masks its strength quite well. If you can find it, this is always worth drinking. If not, its predecessor, the original Aventinus, will suit just fine."
"Drinkability: I can't remember any other brew this strong going down so easily! Take caution with this one, or the morning after will be ugly!"
"I need more of this - to age, just to see how the character changes. It'll be interesting to follow this one up with one of my stash of five year old bottles of ""regular"" Aventinus. Amazing what you find when you clean out your beer cellar."
"This particular brew poured an envigorating tan head. There was very little lacing with this brew on the sides of my mug. It had an aroma of clove to it. The carbonation was observed rising to the top. It had a brown body. This was a smooth tasting brew and definitely one to be sipped and not guzzled."
"This bottle, however, was very different. No banana aroma or flavors at all. Very dark and roasted flavors instead. Perhaps this is due to the bottle being aged. But this too is very enjoyable. Nice flavor timeline. Wow can I sense the alcohol in this beer  straight to my head. A real belly warmer. Highly recommended. Too bad I missed this on tap at the extreme beer event at the Blind Tiger. Much thanks to schoolteacher and biruchan for the bottle."
"Herr Schneider, der ist gutes Bier."
"Pours a murky, prune juice brown. Vigorous microscopic carbonation bubbles stream up the side of the glass, only those right beside the glass can be seen, the others are lost in the murky depths. Aroma is sweet and yeasty. Flavor is akin to a barleywine - strong and sweet, with weizen yeast fruity notes and other dark fruit, prune and date, crowding it aside. Alcohol marches through the flavors with hobnail boots, heavy on the tongue and warm in the belly. Finishes with a lingering, thick bittersweetness at the back of the tongue. Sampled in a small pilsener glass, as the glass is drained down to the narrow neck, the carbonation is so vigorous the beer appears to be almost at a boil. A bock on steroids, the Arnold Schwarzeneger of bocks. This was what he is talking about in the Terminator when he says ""I'll be bock."""
"Bery drinkable but be careful as it has a high alcohol content."
"16689 from 2002. The color is a nice and murky dark brown. The head was large at first but then dissappears like gravity just ate it. There is a very malty sweet taste and very noticeable alcohol. The mouthfeel makes this tolerable, very creamy and coating. I disliked the aftertaste, just straight up alcohol pretty much. The warming effect was desirable though. This is a very nice brew, not something I'll buy all the time though."
"There is a little bit of warming from the alcohol, but not a whole lot. This beer does have quite a kick in the pants though. If you were not awakened by the intensity of the flavor and mouthfeel (which you had to be), once the alcohol actually hits you, you know it packs a punch. The flavor does not tell you of the high alcohol percentage this beer has, but you will know it."
"Pours very dark cloudy brown, small head, and minimal lacing. Aroma is powerful - banana, dark fruits (raisin and plum), maybe some apple in there,too. Flavor starts with some banana, middle has the other fruits mixed in with alcohol, and ends dry with a strong alcohol feel to it. Very light carbonation, and a good bit of warming alcohol parade around the mouth."
"Looks a lot like a bock but that is where the similarity ends. Dark brown in color with a nice thick head. I could taste the alcohol right off, masked only slightly by the rich malt and yeast flavors. Nice texture and mouthfeel. A beer to be careful with because of it's combination of drinkability and high alcohol content. An interesting and unique style."
"F."
"This is a strange wheat, an Ice bock, I think the freezing process increases the potency of this style, an Ice beer. Cloudy golden-orange color, huge thick white clingy head, fruity yeasty aroma of alcohol, cloves and bananas. Malty sweet fruity, spicy flavors, has a kind of strong alcohol taste in the start and finish, not bad for its high alcohol content."
"Pours a cloudy deep brown with a highly carbonated tan head that fades to a thin, carbonation fed layer rather quickly. Pineapple, raisins, mollasses, cloves all on the nose. Very complex. The fruity taste dominates but the cloves are also present. Highly carbonated and the alcohol is well hidden. Verrry smooth. Pretty nice mouthfeel & very drinkable for 13%abv."
"No. 15298 of 2002: This beer poured a huge off white head that held for awhile then subsided to nothing with no lace. It was a murky dark brown color. It had an aroma of malt, cloves and bannanas. A flavor of malt and caramel with slight elements of the alcohol present. A medium, slightly syrupy body to it. I find this to a more rounded beer than the EKU."
"Take the regular Avenitus wheat doppelbock and pour in a shot of whiskey! I don't want to simplify it, but that's what this reminded me of. Poured a large head, retained for a few minutes, and then disappeared entirely (no lace at all). Initially, tasted very much like a somewhat maltier and smoother dark wheat beer (lots of clove, refreshing). As I progressed, however, the alcohol became more and more noticable. By the end, quite boozy (as much as I've tasted in a beer). Still, quite enjoyable and impressive (but be ""vewy, vewy cayweful!!"")"
"Poured with a magnificent tawny tan head, liquid is ultra-murky brown. Lots of yeast in suspension. Nose is concentrated maltiness that pulls no punches as to what awaits...which is rich syrupy, candy like fruity flavors including cooked banana mixed with sharp alcoholic notes. Very heady. Finishes with an alcoholic burn in the throat...one ass-kicking beer! Wish it were more availiable."
"Wish my glass wasn't empty already!"
"Clear deep amber to brown color as it sets in the glass with a modest and semi-creamy head, the color a winsome light tan, as is erodes a fine and sticky sheet of lace covers the glass. Nose is sweet malt with hint of caramel and bubble gum, fresh and quite pleasing, the start is somewhat sweet, rich in malt, top is light to medium in feel. Finish has a mild carbonation, the hops meek, pleasant, slightly tart aftertaste, and a quite quaffable brew tis true."
"Turbid dark garnet hue, covered by a light beige head that readily settles into a tight, dense layer that manages loose lace.  A sharp snap of alcohol hits the nose at first, then thankfully yields to signature Weizen esters comprised of assertive bubblegum, and ripe banana.  Mellow clove and light chocolate notes complement the esters, then mild wheat tartness round out the aroma.  Smells like a Weizenbock, albeit w/ a more pronounced alcohol heatiness.  Tastewise, dark, fruity date - like sweetness starts it off, then is ensued by a melange of clove phenol, raisiny notes and smooth wheat graininess.  Mellow chocolate persists as a constant foundation, adding additional richness.  Bittersweet, peppery alcohol is mild, but when combined with the inital dark fruitiness, a black licorice character is left.  Understated banana esters provide meager contrast to the rich malt profile.  Full in body and viscous in mouthfeel, w/ lower carbonation than their Weizenbock. Finishes with superficial Weizen wheat tartness and light bubblegum ester immediately ceded by throat coating alcohol warmth.  Wow-- this is a big brew, to say the least.  This eisbock makes no attempt to hide the alcohol character, yet manages to integrate it into the overall profile nicely. It's not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated and retains the signature Weizen esteriness.  Although intense and delicious, its palate drenching nature diminishes the drinkability."
" A remarkable beer but somehow more, and less than I expected. Aventinus provides the same unique flavors in a more subdued fashion, without the thickness the Eisbock."
"Dark brown with swirls of sedimentation.  The aroma was spicy with evident alcohol.  The flavor was cloves with high malt and slightly alcoholy.  The carbonation was big and it effervesced on the tongue.  Very full of complex flavor and I like this more than the Aventinus (stronger flavor).  An excellent beer that I would love to have again, just not more than one or two at a time."
"Not as complex as I though it would have been, the head lacks big time with a thin ring of lace … other than that this is a great brew. Alcohol is deceiving in a way as it lurks around to sneak up on you."
"oh baby.....what a beer.   murky apple cider appearance, thin foamy head.  aroma of caramel apples, cloves, and some banana....tons of malt...and sweet alcohol.  above average carbonation, with a thick chewy mouthfeel.   massive body on this one....lots of wheat and yeast flavors with caramel malt flavors in the background. a definite hop presence and......... oh yeah...an alcohol bite that is very noticeable, and very welcome.  an awesomely powerful beer, huge in every way!  alcohol warming effect immediately.  11.2 oz of sheer bliss in a bottle!"
"Why mess with perfection and freeze Aventinus to take the water out of it just to make it stronger? The best thing about this beer is how the head is so thick and snaps, crackles, and pops all the way to the bottom of the glass. Other than that, I am not impressed and don't understand the hype associated with this beer. The chocolate malt flavor is more present in this version but does not blend well with the very harsh alcohol flavor. Its like someone took a imperial stout and dumped a shot of cheap vodka in it. I would rather see them try and brew a triple bock instead of just taking water out of the dopple bock to get a stronger more maltier beer. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. What's next, kegs of Chimay?"
"I am stunned."
"Monster, craterous tan head.  Menacing hazy brown color, lighter at bottome and grows increasingly dark as it rises.  Big wheat and yeast aroma.  Clovey and slightly peppery.  Delicate and brutal."
"132"
"This beer is awesome!!Pour slowly this thing is packed with carbonation,Huge on the nose,packed with bannana,clove from the weizenbier yeast.Creamy and rich thoughout the taste explodes in your mouth!First german beer to impress me since I lived there."
"No. 00626 of 2002 - a reasonably fresh bottle. Monster head atop murky mysterious liquid. Fruity aroma and floral, bourbonish taste. Brings back college memories of Southern Comfort (and, unfortunately, grain alcohol). Smooth, soft mouthfeel with the yeast providing something to really sink your tongue into. Although seemingly benign, a large gulp gives numbing indication of its wicked disposition. Drink slowly (and pour slowly - the head's a killer). Perhaps too over the top, especially at this young age, also since regular Aventinus is just as pleasurable. Regardless, an inspiring beer."
"What a great idea, ""Lets take an alread intense beer and crank it up a notch or two."" I hope they continue to make this, I also hope that someday we get some to sell up here in Oreon."
"Well aware of this story, Hans Peter Drexler, brewmaster at the Schneider Brewery, decided to recreate this classic ""mistake"" in a modern controlled facility. Thus, the Aventinus Eisbock is reborn sixty years later. Now it's brewed in limited qualities throughout the year."
"A tasty dopplebock loaded with weisse and whiskey flavors.  Packs a potent punch to even the most robust of drinkers. bottle number 01171 - 2001."
