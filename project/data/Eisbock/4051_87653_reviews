"You can really taste the burnt caramel flavors from the Stein process. The smell is complex .  A really interesting beer."
"Serving type: bottle."
"Light brown with a finger of off white head..smell is of malty sugary toffee..taste follows the nose with a medium body mouthfeel and and a slight touch of booze on the finish.."

"Pours a reddish brown with a two finger caramel colored head. Smells very bready and slightly nutty with mild toffee sweetness. The flavor is divided.  It's half sweet bread and half alcohol. I like it,  but I feel I might grow tired of it."

"This is some tough stuff to swallow. I'm always happy to down a glass of some boozy brew as long as there's a chicken leg and a hot bath to slide into. This is not going to do the job. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
