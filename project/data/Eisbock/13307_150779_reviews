"Malty and spicy doppelbock character up front, but then the beer is surrounded huge raspberry candy flavor and sweetness."

"i am one of the few apparently who was floored by the fresler tripplebock, not sure if thats  the exact base of this one, but my inclination is yes. i get a little less of that honey soy glaze thing that stood out to me so much in fresler, its been replaced by the intensity and authenticity of the berry, which is not at all subtle here. murky ruby red brown color, short head but its hangs out, there is some real density to this. yeast in the nose is a mikkeller classic, belgian a little, but this is a bock beer after all, and thats there too. the berries are tart in the nose, while the grain is sweet, nothing candy or fake about the fruit at all, its just the essence of the berry, and its lovely in the nose. the grain is deep and rich and layered and a lot more than the usual suspects. it has a hefty mellowness to it, if mellowness can be described that way, with the mouthfeel of a port wine, plus a little prickle of carbonation, its just soft and rich and patient, but also huge. the berry lasts longer than the malt in the finish, thank a slow cool fermentation for that i suspect. almost tart there on the back end, tannic a little too, this has a wine character in that way. just as dynamic as can be on its own, but if you want a special treat, have it with a little dark chocolate and let the flavors really come out. better as it warms too, worth the money, but i always say that with mikkeller stuff."

"Full bodied but trailing with a malty-dry texture, the toasted char, fruity tang, alcohol spice and grain-derived astringency all aid the beer in its dry drinkability. But part of the bock beer's charm is its complex and savory sweetness that is largely scrubbed out with all those balancing nuances. Complex? ...or complicated?"
