"Like the Winter Solstice, a beer like this comes along but once in a year. Kuhnhenn has a habit of making special (and rare) beers but Winter Wonder Lager continues to be one of my favourites in their portfolio. There's as few beers like this one as there are places to buy it; if you're ever in the Detroit area and happen to spot a bottle, don't pass on it!"
"OVERALL: A very flavorful and enjoyable higher ABV brew for sure. Not as hot as I had assumed it would be either. In the end, this is a good beer to sip on over an evening, which I gladly did. A better look would help make the experience more enjoyable, but that is a minor issue. Thanks again for the brews dad! Recommended."

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, 2012 winter solstice bottling. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, cherry, apple, pear, apple skin, molasses, pepper, clove, coriander, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of huge sweet raisin, plum, cherry, pear, apple, molasses, caramel, toffee, pepper, clove, herbal, toast, brown sugar, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, clove, herbal, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of malt and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish surprisingly. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Doppelbock style! Huge complexity, balance, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"(O)- Honestly, this is probably only the 3rd or 4th Eisbock I have ever had, but this one is really inviting on a cold winters day. Rich and sweet, but with its very bubble gum forward yeast profile, this is an intriguing take on the style based upon the others I have had. Kind of wish I had gotten a few more to see what time does to it."

"Overall: The alcohol is just a bit too overwhelming and the flavors are not particularly well-defined"
"Big thanks goes out to the GBX Crew (beeruser & funkydelic) for sharing this one during a recent tasting! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass. Poured a brownish orange with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, sugar, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, sugar, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really was surprised by this one upon inspection with both the flavor and aroma. The sweet alcohol aspect on this one is really what sealed the deal for me on this one. It added a nice level of complexity. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance to do so."
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is full of grain and with a dose of sugar and grapes thrown in. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of grapes and brown sugar, as well as some cherries and a ton of booziness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"The palate, on the other hand, is a lot more flavorful. Quite sweet, almost bitingly so, with a definite kirschwasser taste, fruit and almond-like pit tannins. Some fruit - dried apples, raisins and prunes - as well as a little leather, are present. The alcohol is present and potent, though not as prominent as I'd expect. Apart from a little caramel, though, this does start to fall off on the palate. Bitter (almond skins) on the finish with brown sugar, a little licorice and some prunes, this beer is full in body, lightly carbonated. Decent, enjoyable even, in 2-4oz servings, but 12oz is a bit of a chore."
"o - it isn't winter, but this winter was a wonder and this beer is supreme for an eisbock. if you aren't looking for big bold malt bomb with a smooth glazing of 13% then this is not for you...however, if you are looking for that, this beer hits it. loved it."
"overall: it was good, and it tasted great for how high the ABV was but it just wasn't worth 7$ a bottle."
""
"D: No thanks (1)"
"O- Nice sipper, lots of different notes from toffee, caramel, bready, fruit, and chocolate. I was glad the beer did not taste and feel like the smell (intense alcohol)."
"Overall pretty good, a nice end of the year beer to drink. The booze is definitely there but not quite drinking like a 13%, maybe more like 9-10%, not sure if that's the sweetness balancing it or the age but more drinkable than expected. Quite sweet too, syrupy, nice malt flavors and wheats, bock flavors, etc. The sweetness is dominant but goes fairly well overall and not crippling."

"Cheers!"

"O: I like eisbocks and I like Kuhnhenn, but this was a bit too much for me."
"Tons of rich toffee and caramel initially on the nose, once it warms up though it becomes one of the most complex aromas I have ever encountered. Light alcohol notes, hints of dark cherries and fruit, light chocolate and almost a root beer like touch as it really comes up near room temperature. To say the aroma was inviting would be an understatement, this was intense. Smooth, full, thick body on this one really let the flavor just coat your tongue, and again this was an expierence all its own. A malt monster, caramel and light molasses notes led the charge until a soothing, candy like chocolate and toffee notes come in. But it was the fruit like cherry notes and rich cola flavor that set it apart"
"This is an epic, brawling, rude, in-your-face big beer with a ton of depth & taste (not to mention the 58% alcohol). Very good."
"Overall I was pretty ambivalent about this beer â€“ nothing was not badly but nothing made me excited about my next sip either. Worth a shot if you see it around, especially if eisbocks are your thing."
"Pours a moderate brown color with some amber coloring in there as well. Very thin off-white head and a few legs down the side of the glass. Slight collar. Nose is loaded with dark fruits and some alcohol. Slightly spicy as well. Taste is a bit oxidized and really quite warm. Warm as in lots of booze, even for an eisbock. Low carbonation. Decent but probably way too young. Normally Kuhnhenn hides alcohol better than this."
"Beer is sweet and much thicker than I was expecting. It's not bad tasting at all it's just a little simple. It's sweet with a mild alcoholic bite and a relatively plain finish. Easy drinking for a 13% + beer and as far as eisbocks go it was above average in my opinion. I'd have it again except I trend toward the lower ABV spectrum on beers."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Not enjoyable, maybe this will be better with time, but not ready yet."
"D - Very solid and perfect for this cold and snowy Christmas Eve. The alcohol is hidden very well and I'm looking forward to seeing how this one ages. Recommend."
"Overall, another winner from kuhnhenn. This beer provides the warmth similar to a lot of the other big kuhnhenn beers. I had no idea what the style was on this one when I opened it, but at first smell, I knew it was bigger than a typical lager. Get some!"
"Bottle. 2007 vintage. Poured into a CCB snifter. Pours an opaque rusty mahagony color with zero head, only a razor thin collar around the glass. The aroma is intriguing with notes of dark fruit like cherry, plum, and raisin. The booze is pretty evident upon the first sip of this brew, not in a bad way, but in a ""let's just sip on this"" way. Sweet and malty with a heavy mouthfeel this beer starts sweet with dark fruit notes that transitions to a long drawn out finish with some bitterness. Big and chewy. Alcohol warms you as you drink. Pretty nice although the lingering bitterness is not that pleasing."
"4.0 D: Another solid effort from Kuhnhenn. Could be a bit more complex, but good overall."
"Perhaps I did not have this beer under the best circumstances but it was damn near undrinkable. It was a cool night but this beer really warms you up. It has the aroma of christmas time and the look of a dortmunder. The cluster of flavors just bombards you but nonetheless the alcohol is not hidden at all. I only had a taste luckily because I could not have taken anything more than this. Way too alcoholic to drink more than 4 ounces."
"Wow. Hot mess. Rocket fuel for beer snobs."
"Above average drinkability for the ABV. Not a bad beer overall, but definitely not a great one."
"O: This is a very interesting beer and when I had it on tap at the brewery I really liked it. This review is from a bottle with a few months age and it starts to marinate on itself and lose some of the nuances that it had fresh (odd as many beers develop nuance as they age)."
"Thanks, Barry. 09 vintage. Murky rusty copper body with a thin cap. Ridiculously sweet bubblegum aroma. Booze, caramel and spice make up the rest of the smell. Horrific bubblegum syrup flavors abuse the palate; this is like Bubble Yum dissolved in moonshine, and then heavily spiced. Incredibly syrupy and heavy on the palate with a wearying spicy and syrupy finish, this is abysmal."
"The beer is full bodied with low carbonation and distinct alcohol warming. Quite enjoyable, though potent."
"Medium body is nicely carbonated. A cellar worthy lager from Kuhnhenn."
"Drinkability: so very drinkable. Could easily drink this for quite a while. And its not infected!!!"
"Drinkability: An odd, complex, and unique beer. It's definitely an eisbock - that is, it's a malty brew with Belgian yeasty overtones - but this one has a lot going on in places. Typical of Kuhnhenn - the brewery that seems like it's done in some guy's basement, rough edges, high abv%'s, small batches and all - to produce something like this. The 13% (or 15%, or 12%, or 18%, or whatever this year's batch is - also very Kuhnhenn-esque!) is definitely feelable, if not noticeable in the taste or aroma. A potent lager win for Kuhnhenn, even if the alcohol retardation is occasionally noticeable and the sweetness is rather formidable."
"A 12 ounce bottle thanks to DrJay. Bottle states - 2007 vintage, 15.5%. Uncapped and poured into my Ithaca shaker glass. The lager appears the color of murky iced tea with a good inch or so of quickly fading, light tan head. Nose and flavors consist of sherry, brown sugar, molasses, plums, sweet cherries, fermenting over ripe apples, alcohol (although it wasn't as hot as I was expecting), sweet caramel, a peppery spiciness, overall, quite sweet and a bit boozy. Medium to full bodied with ample carbonation levels. A noticeable alcohol burn in the throat after each sip. The sweetness gets to you after a bit and that hurts the drinkability. Plan to spend an hour plus sipping this one, or better yet, share it with a friend or two."
"This would probably be a little better if I had given it some time to mellow. As is, it is a little too hot and boozy."
"I find it to be quite easy to drink, as a one-and-done kind of bottle. You won't really want to slam back multiples in a session."
"D: not like other eisbocks in drinkability and smoothness"
"D - This is a definite sipper, and it's going to take me over an hour to finish a 12oz bottle. I don't like it quite as much as the Eisbock, Cassis, or 5th Dementia, but it's still a decent brew with well-hidden alcohol. I'd be interested to try this fresh, and it looks like I might get the chance at the Winter Solstice party."
"Overall a solid example. These malt bombs are not particularly my bag, but I am sure many would like this..."
"D - Sorry. Too big and too BIG. One is good, and I hope I get another in the future!"
"Very much a barleywine, smells like a barleywine.. or an Eisbock. Thick creamy mouthfeel, this is emminently drinkable. Caramel brown and it looks thick. Big abv like a good ready to drink barleywine. Sugar and background spice, lots of caramel malt.Dangeroudly drinkable."
"Kuhnhenn makes kick ass beer. This is simply another example. It really is very good. I do think it'd be slightly improved with a little less sweetness and a lower abv. Those two tweaks would really drive this beer to excellence. As it is, it's very good. Definitely worth seeking out. Thanks for the bottle, Derek."
"D- A hot bloody Mary beer. Maybe this is too old, maybe it's just bad. This is not all that interesting or good."
"D: Poor, very strong with an unattractive mouthfeel."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, I probably held onto this one a little bit too long but it's still a good beer to sip on for a while."
"More like a midwest triple bock."
"Wow. Not much in the way of balance here. Perhaps there is a time and place for this one, but it escapes me at the moment."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy amber color beer with small foamy head with minimal retention and almost no lacing. Aroma consists of deep sweet malt with some dry raisins notes also noticeable. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt with notes of dry figs and raisins. Although taste is very sweet it avoid being cloying. No discernable alcohol even thought ABV is quite significant with a full body with limited filtration and some low carbonation. Very well done and definitely something I would want to try again."
"Thanks again, GrandCruDrew"
"With a vigorous pour you do get about an inch of tan head that fades to just a skim in a couple of minutes. Body is a murky dark swampy brown. Nose has fones of ripe grape, port, sweet malt and a bit of citrus twords the end. Enters the mouth with big electric dark fruit notes. This brew is nicely sweet with overly ripe apple tones and a malty spice based pofile. Maybe some creamy dark toffee notes come through on the back end of the palate. This is a really hard to define brew style wise. Alchol is well hidden but does warm the belly well. Mouthfeel is very attractive for such a big beer. A wonderful sipper for any time of year."
"Notes from 3/04/08"
"Notes: It's 39 degrees outside today. Almost like... dare I say... WINTER?!? I think this has about a year on it and could easily use 2 more."
"D: This is the definition of a sipper and is a big, big beer. Big thanks to Jan for the opportunity to try it."
"Thanks to kkulacki for picking this up for me. Pours a dark walnut brown, touch of thin bubbles on the surface. Laces thickly, like concentrated prune juice. Smells of plums, black currants, slight hint of a European hop, strong alcohol. Tastes strongly of alcohol, interlaced well with a malty, fruity base. Prune flavor and tart cherry flavor, along with a dry caramel and ethanol kick. Huge and syrupy. full bodied to the MAX! A hardcore, liquor-like, evening-by-the-fire beer. Very strong and decadant."
"A great winter brew. It'll warm you up, that's for sure."
"D- Certainly one to sip on. I enjoyed this one a lot but it is so strong 1 is all you need."
"This is a great sipper but one a night is about all you need. A great brew, I enjoyed every drop of it"
"Pours a murky rustic amber hue with a half finger off-white head that quickly dies down to a ring of bubbles on the outside of the glass. Swirling the glass leaves some legging on the sides. A big whiff of booze up front with oak, dark fruits, and thick molasses. Very powerful in the nose, but not over the top. Apple cider sweetness at first with a thick alcohol warmth and some toasted almonds. Oaky wood flavors with some grape and caramel malt on the tongue as well. Full body with a very subtle, but present, carbonation. Definitely a sipper, take your time and truly enjoy this beer. Kuhnhenn puts out another beer that tops the charts, keep up the good work guys."
"Almost like a braggot. Very malty but layers upon layers of honey comb, caramel and toffee. Thick creamy delicious mouthfeel. Again a fruity quality very uncanny of a lager. Berry characteristics than going into more dark fruit flavors. Boysenberry being a standout. A tremendous beer with that signature malty sweetness that I've come to love in the various Kuhnhenn beers I've tried."
"it was 15.5 abv"
"Drinkability: This is definitely and Eisbock. Strong and warming. Great on a cold winter evening. Sip not drink. You will not pound this beer without serious consequences. 15.5%ABV is like drinking 2-3 beers at once. I would think that this is best served as an after meal digestive or winter warmer."
"Pours a clear amber, think white head, very brilliant colour, little bit of lace, settles down to a thin ring. Smell is crazy, very intense, caramel, some fruity alcohol, the bubblegum, but amped up in every aspect, pretty fantastic. Taste is more of the same, very malty, toffee, bubblegum fruitiness, alcohol, clean bitter finish, excellent. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. A sipper, at 15.5% covers the alcohol extremely well, this fucker sneaks up and smacks you good and hard. Thanks a lot Russ!!"
"drinkability is good, much more than you'd think at 15.5%. definitely a sipper, but very good."
"Taste was sour and foul buttery. Diacetyl failure. One sip and I sent my sample down the drain."
"Had on tap at Cole's yesterday afternoon for an astounding $8.00 a pint.Poured a clear deep rich golden with hints of deep red thruout a thinner white head atop,massive malt in the nose dark fruit and grape skin mainly with big alcohol and brown sugar lingering.Full chewey mouthfeel a beer to drink as a nightcap not at 4.00 in the afternoon like what I did,big sweet tones on the palate alcohol infused prune and raisin with that grape skin note the alcohol hits with a sweet burning onslaught in the finish.This beer will put hair on your chest and I was feeling it right away,great brew just be careful with it."
"2004 vintage. Pours amber to golden in color and clear, an aggressive pour shows only a faint gathering of cream foam that quickly recedes. Aroma is sweet and malty, some appley sweetness, sprite like smell and some port like alcohol wafts up. Taste shows an apple and ginger like sweetness, a strong bready and caramel character, and a good size warming and dry alcohol finish. Fairly light in body for its strength, a nice spiciness hits the tongue from the alcohol, there is a faint tart apple quality that lingers. An enjoyable nightcap, I think this 04 has already peaked and will not go too much longer. Still, a nice after dinner treat."
"Not that I would ever be classy enough to do this, but this would make the perfect beer for a reduction into a marinade for some red meat. I'm imagining venison stewed in a couple bottles of this for a couple days, and wishing I had the kind of money to drop on a meal like that."
"The most interesting aspect of this beer was the nose. A weird yet interesting mix of aromas, especially the bleu cheese notes. That reminded me that I have a small chunk of Bleu d' Auvergne in the fridge and oddly enough, the pairing works quite well. A dangerously drinkable beer. Tough to find outside of the brewery when they have it. If you find it, buy all that is available. I did."
"On tap at the brewpub, listed as 15.5%. This beer was a hazy, deep amber colour with a bit of a reddish hue. The short, off-white head showed great retention and left sheets of fine lace on the glass. Complex aroma with a mixture of bubblegum, orange, banana, and floral hops. Alcohol became evident as it warmed. The huge sweetness assaults the palate, but other flavours help bring this into perspective. The bubblegum, orange, and banana character appeared again, but this was supplemented by pineapple and lots of citrus at the mid-point. This created an intensely complex fruit character. Low bitterness overall, with mild alcohol and a lingering sweet finish. Heavy body that was on the syrupy side, but didn't become overbearing. The carbonation was well-integrated and refined. I was surprised at how well the alcohol content was masked in the flavour, but this stuff really messes you up fast. An exceptional winter beer, I highly recommend it."
"Poured amber with a tan colored head that give way to nice lacing. Smells of alcohol and fruit. Apples, grapes, and bubblegum with an alcohol finish flood my mouth. Mouthfeel is very thick and warming. Halfway through the glass and I feel my face getting a little flush. Very drinkable, not sure I'd get another growler to myself though."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the glowing burnished copper brew. Head fades quickly to an uneven layer of bubbles, not unexpected for the style, and average lacing for this abv is actually impressive. Aroma is bubblegum fruitiness, with warming alcohol, even in the nose. Flavor is sweet maltiness upfront, with the bubblegum carrying in here as well. A vinous tart close, and subtle warming is the only indication of alcohol here. For the style, the mouthfeel and drinkability are stupid good. Wow. Check this out if you can."
"12ozer bottled in 2004 and picked up at the brewpub. Pours out thick deep reddish brown with a good sized off white head. No lace and the head quickly drops down into the murky body. Big dark ripe fruity notes come out as soon as this is poured. There is a touch of alcohol peaking though but nothing to hint at 15%. More sweet fruit notes are released as this warmed. Some notes of toffee and light maple syrup are noted as well. The flavor is equally big in fruits mainly of the dark variety. Some molasses and caramel. Very rich malty flavor that hides the alcohol extremely well. The sweetness manages to keep from being cloying as well. This stuff is very thick with a big warming quality to it. Right after the first sip you know this was strong stuff with the way the warming is. Pretty damn drinkable too in my opinion. I would have liked more than one bottle even though it took me awhile to finish. This is just an ideal beer to be sipping on in the cold months or anytime for that matter."
"12oz bottle. 2004 bottling. Fiery crimson with russet edges. Small head of thin off-white big bubbled foam fades quickly leaving no lacing patterns. Bubbles stay and form a halo ring though. Pretty stuff. Aromas are intense. Brash, alcoholic, phenolic, yeasty, fruity, suede-like, and leathery are some terms i'd use to describe the aroma of this brew. There are also some uniquely fruity (pear) notes tucked into this complex and elbaorate spectacle of aromas. The first sip is intense in flavor as well. Fruity pear notes with some leather in the mix as well. Also some German hop notes, and a biscuty o-fest malt character as well. It's very interesting to see such subtle flavors come through in such a big beer. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and coating a warming sensation is evident in the sip and swallow of this concoction as well. Drinkability is good for this interesting concoction but not amazing. This is some damn fine nectar on it's first birthday but I can only assume that it was all too brash in its youth. Not a world class champion like the raspberry eisbock, but a good German styled double-strength eisbock all the same. However, I must say that Southamptons version simply demolishes this one. Another Kuhnhenn master piece, but not my favorite from these truly talented brothers."
"(much thanks to cjrmellor)"
"I really enjoyed this brew overall, also was available in bottles. I hope they make more next year, I'll definatly be looking for it."
"I'll use it in a sauce (or 'as' a sauce!)"
"2004 vintage, 15.5%"
"Pours to a copper-red color with a minimal white head. The aroma is fruity and sweet with a candi sugar smell. Hops are not present in the aroma, but a bit of alcohol is. The flavor is candy-like...sweet and semi-fruity. It is a pretty easy drinking brew for the 15.5% alcohol level. A tasty digestive brew, after StuBob's stir fry."
"from the tap at my favorite brewery. poured a nice amber with a nice size off white head. aroma, grapes, apricots, blackberries, yeast, alcohol, honey, and hints of yeast. flavor, dark fruits, grapes, apple, apricots, alcohol, hints of chololate. as this beer warmed up the alcohol became stronger.this is a nice strong beer. they bumped up the alcohol to 15.5"
"Highly, highly drinkable for such a heavy alcohol beer. Almost good enough to session. Very lively in the mouth and the powerhouse of flavors realy balance the alcohol well."
"Another amazing Kuhnhenn's experiment in pushing the limits of beer without resorting to twelve tons of hops to do it."
