"Poured from a 330ml bottle. Pours a dark chestnut brown colour. Notes of roasty malt, dark fruits, brown sugar on the nose. Taste is sweet, boozy and unapologetically malty, with notes of marzipan, molasses, nuts and grapes/raisins. Rich, deep and warming."
"O: Exceptionally smooth and delicious beer, perfect for a cold winter night. This is actually my first Eisbock style beer and I really enjoyed it, I will most definitely be trying others."

"O - A solid brew, loads of flavour as deceivingly smooth. ABV is very well hidden and the flavour profile is quite complementary. Definitely worth picking up and super glad I was able to take it for a spin."
""
"O: Everything is very concentrated and is unapologetically malt forward. I have never had the regular (341 ml) bottles but this special edition bomber is a great sipper that will be an excellent brew to cellar. Worth picking up a few if you can still find them."

"Overall: An average offering. Some good components but doesn't quite add up."
"a solid example of an obscure style from a brewery I didn't know existed until recently. I'm pretty stoked that I'm still unaware of gems like this from my own backyard, cheers chickenm for increasing my awareness"

"Hermannator Ice Bock pours deep, inky red black, with a thin, brown head. The aroma is alcohol, chocolate and dark fruit, with hints of chocolate and caramel. Sweetness comes through first in the flavor, with a big rich maltiness backing it up. Tons more raisiny dark fruit, with some nice roastiness and a sweet, toffee finish. Dark fruit sticks around after the beer is gone. The alcohol is well hidden, this is a beer that could really sneak up on you."

"o - overall, solid eisbock. nicely made and very drinkable. the fruitiness makes the malts very tolerable."
"O: Very tasty and easy drinking eisbock. The best I have had of this style so far."
"Overall, I thought this was a pretty good, balanced beer. At 9.5%, very easy drinking. I would buy again but I think this was a seasonal."
"Drinkability: Given its high alcohol, this is actually light enough to enjoy a second bottle in an evening."
"Fresh 2010 bottle. Pours dark ruby brown with a thin tan head that quicky fades away. Aroma is mild but sweet. The taste is very chocolately with sweet malts, molasses, and light fruitiness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Good drinkability even though it's a little bit too sweet. The alcohol in this is very well hidden."
"Not a deep and contemplative beer. Just good tasting and strong. If you need to warm up on a cold Vancouver night this one does the trick very well."
"Light/medium, spot-on carbonation, perhaps a little thin on the mouthfeel for the style. Not perhaps as bold or as layered as others in the category but with a little age this beer really shines as a smooth, drinkable eisbock. Thanks Dave!"
"Thanks to canucklehead for the bottle!"
"D - very sweet and thick"
"Thanks Seldom Seen. I think this bottle was aged as much as two years and that was a good thing. Poured black with little head to speak of. That meant understated carbonation. There was a tad of lace. Delicious rich malty, and that was in the aroma. Cocoa, and a touch of roast.More imperial porter, with above average mouthfeel, than the hoppy versions from a brewer in Niagara Falls of the same style."
"drinkability is pretty good. decent balance. a little underwhelming."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown, almost black, slightly hazy, thin light tan head forms, drops to a thin ring around the glass, no real lacing, not much head sticks around, looks okay. Smell is nice but a little weak, caramel, iron, light chocolate and roast, raisin, light fruitiness, vanilla, nutty, sherry, some alcohol but well hidden, not too bad. Taste is similar, sweet and fruity, grapes, caramel, apple juice, raisins, chocolate milk, alcohol, sherry, vanilla, pretty neat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, some warmth but very smooth for the ABV. Been waiting to try this one for a while, glad I finally could. Nice beer!"
"I've been trying to track this down for years, but they tend to be sold out by Christmas. So a big thanks to Seldomseen for this trade!"
"At 9.5% this beer is not to be taken lightly. The effects are quite noticeable after one beer."
"Overall: Unfortunately, in my College days, I drank this stuff to get smashed at Christmas parties. I enjoy it more now for its complexity and rich character. Great stuff. Definitely not a daily drinker but a great Christmas treat(odd I say this in june...)"
"Bottle courtesy of mgermani: Poured a deep cloudy brown color bock with a small bubbly head with almost no carbonation. Aroma of dry fruits (figs and plums) with some toffee malt. Taste is a mix between some sweet toffee and caramel malt with great notes of dry fruits such as figs and raisins. Body is full with some light carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I really appreciated that one except maybe for being a bit too sweet and rich."
"Overall; a good winter beer, and a good strong dark beer. Would buy again (if available) AAA++++."
"One of Canadas better eisbocks but needs work...do something with the heading on this brew and youll be there VBC."
"Thanks HogTownHarry for this very limited release ""ice"" bock."
" Pours a beautiful deep and ever-so-slightly translucent brown/black/red, with a slight head. Nose is slightly sweet malts. Taste is syrupy and sweet, with some chocolate and tasty roasted malts on the finish. Mouthfeel is full and good. Drinkability very high on this one. Nice brew! Best of the recent beer club."
"Wow, what a treat. This was brought to our beer tasting club by one of our resident Canadians. She'd been talking about it for ages so we finally got a chance to see if it lived up to its name (preview: it did). Poured super dark crimson and clear with a tan colored head. looks great. Smells plummy and ethyl alcohol-like and fairly inviting. Taste is sweet caramel with some chocolate flavor. alcohol really quite understated. smoe roastiness and dark fruity flavors like dates and prunes. A thick cough-syrup and water texture thats very easy to drink and enjoy. Probably the best Eisbock i've had."
"Pours as deep an amber color as I've ever seen. Its like an incredibly infused tea color. A 2 finger head falls to absolutely no head over top. The nose is rich toasted melanoidan munich malt with a thick caramel sweetness hanging over top of it. I think these two aromas are strong enough to keep any fruity fig notes from coming through. Flavor is strong, but not as bold as I was expecting. The initial sip brings a thick caramel that sits over a deep toastyness. This moves towards a very deep caramelized prune and fig. The finish is lightly bitter, fading quickly. Feel is thick with a light carbonation...very filling. Overall, this is a nice brew. The bottle says its 9.5%. I'd expect a touch more alcohol in an eisbock, but I'm feeling it a little in my cheeks. This is one to find if you happen to be in B.C on Vancouver Island. Nice."
"I love the new 6 pack with smaller bottles as it makes easier to drink one without the alcohol ( 9.5 abv) taking effect. This is an improvement on last years beer as that sweetness has been decreased and the smoothness has been increased. Lots of nice cakey flavours and a malty finish that makes the alcohol hide its face. Very drinkable and very refined."
"This one is sold exclusively in 650ml bottles with a foil based labels which have a tendency to peel back while still on store shelves. It's a great little beer that won't last long. Get it while you can."
