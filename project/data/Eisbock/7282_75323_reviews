"Overall: Not my favorite eisbock, as the Aventinus eisbock is a tough act to follow. However, it is pretty darned tasty, loaded with a depth that cool temperatures can mask. I'd repeat this beer, were I to stumble upon it on tap anywhere, or find it on a shelf in a place where the Aventinus were not available."
"Hofstetten Granitbock Ice pours clean, brilliant chestnut with a thin film for a head that dissipates to nothing. Raisins, alcohol and rich sweet malts dominate the nose.  It has rich dark bread malt flavors and traces of fruit but it tastes a little metallic – like when you are doing carpentry and are holding nails in your mouth, there is a dash of salt in the finish and the alcohol is a touch too hot. It has a full body and the carbonation is below average."
"Aroma of dark fruit, licorice, roasted malts, brown sugar, faint rum ABV. Taste sweet caramel, malt, molasses, plums, faint soy & booze."

"Overall: aroma is great but I wish the flavor tracked more with the smell.  Not quaffable in any conventional sense but a soothing sipper, good on a cold November night."

"o: I wish it tasted as good as it smells."

"Mouthfeel: Sweetened and smooth borders on a halls medicine or a liquid candied."

"Beer is heavy-bodied, with carbonation of low intensity, resulting in a smooth (9/10) and just slightly foamy (1/10) mouthfeel that's perfect for a heavy, high-ethanol beer of such intense sweetness. Ethanol felt lightly as warmth in the nostrils and a light burn on the throat and tongue: ethanol generally well-hidden. Good for the style Closes dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"Bottled in 2011 so a little age to this.Poured into a snifter a deep walnut brown no head to speak of.Aromas of roasted nuts,caramel, and a sour frutiness,almost like a fruitcake with a light sourness added.Flavors are nutty and cake-like with a tinge of rum,again a lingering light sourness is there.Mellow in the mouth...almost to mellow but it's a nice sipping nightcap."
"O not your typical Eisbock, rather little malt sweetness and instead sourness, very well hidden alcohol for 11,5%"

"Overall: I have a few differnt eisbocks I have been waiting to try ever since I had the Aventinus Eisbock which is absolutely world class and one of my favorite beers ever. This didnt quite live up to that high bar, but it is still a good brew that is worth trying inside the style."
"Straight up pour gives a one finger light brown head that vanishes instantly, leaving no lace. Murky brown color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Bourbon nose, flavor is alcohol flavored molasses, some dark fruit with a dry finish. $8.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."

"O: This beer is rather easy to drink compared to other beers in the style because the alcohol is very well hidden from the taste and it's not very malty or full-bodied in nature."

"Poured a brownish body with one finger offwhite head and some lace on top of an aroma that was strong, almost like a sticky sweet smell if that makes sense, barley malt aplenty, yeast pokes out and some dark/sweet fruit. The brew is creamy, smooth, the yeast makes it fluffy on the tongue and easy to pass, with a balance of caramel and toffee sweetness and good malts that border on roasted and some fruit flavors that border sweet fruit and dark fruit but I can't really pinpoint them. There are not really any citric type fruits like orange that sometimes poke out with a good amount of yeast in a beer, but the finish is a little crisp and these bitter citric hops poke out on the finish, overpowering the sweet malts and dryer malts. A very good beer that has a great balance of hearty maltiness and sweetness."

"O - This is a very different kind of eisbock, with the sour tastes, kind of interesting. It really grows on you as ypou drink it, so give it a chance."
""
"D - Well, it smells amazing, but the flavor is not at all what I expected. The tartness isn't unpleasant, but it is odd and I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. Overall, it is a good brew, but a more traditional version with more sweetness in the finish would have been better."
"An amazing beer, and one that makes me understand why a brewery would make an eisbock. The concentration of flavor in this beer is flat out amazing."

"Notes: Dam this snarling beast has big sharp pointy teeth with a sinister malt backbone. Did I mention this beer is incredibly sweet. Cheers."
""
"Thanks PapaStrudel and redliner8!!!"

"Notes: Nice offering, does not make it to the notch of the very few eisbocks I´ve tried but it is pretty good. Repeating this rarity is unlikely given the price tag, which might be its biggest flaw."
