review_text
"A clear mahogany in color with a tiny tan head. Aromas of fine whisky and Molasses. Taste is a rich molasses flavor up front, then a huge toffee component, followed by rich oak and a bit of bitterness to balance. Mouth feel is super rich. Overall a nice rich eisbock."
"A magnificent beer that drinks more like a port with the high alcohol you would expect."
