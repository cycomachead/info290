3.54,-0.6,3.25,3.5,3.75,3,3.5,"The newest offering from Neil over at Strangeways. Murky brown coloring. Very light on the palate for an Eisbock. Flavor is nice, dry fruits, some malty sweetness, the alcohol comes through somewhat but for 10%+ this beer goes down remarkably easy. Overall, not a bad offering from Strangeways, this beer is not overly impressive, but well done and definitely worth a try.","VeganUndead","0"
