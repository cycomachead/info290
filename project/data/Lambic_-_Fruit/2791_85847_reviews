"Lighter tasting pumpkin lambic. Not too sweet. Some spice notes present. Decent, not great."
"Bottle pour. Murky copper color with small head. Aromas are of apple pie with cinnamon and a little allspice. Flavor is slightly tart pumpkin, biscuit/pie crust, esters. Smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a lighter body."
"Overall: Interesting stuff. It's enjoyable, but tastes more like a spiced cider than a beer, and if it wasn't printed on the label, I would never have guessed that there's any lambic component to this whatsoever."
""
"Light brown to copper in color and slightly hazy in appearance.  No head is present.  Lots of cinnamon and some pumpkin in the aroma.  The flavor is packed with cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice.  It's over spiced and cloyingly sweet.  The mouth is massively carbonated and sticky."
"Great amber color with a floral aroma.  Not much pumpkin flavor. But has an impressive white head.  Overall, a good beer."

"O. An unusual pumpkin ale worth trying."
""
" Pours up a hazy yet brilliant copper with a big bubbly white crown. Not gettin a whole lotta aroma. Some spicy pumpkin pie. Taste is tart red apples. As the beer warms up I get pumpkin and mild pumpkin spice in the finish. Mildly acidic. Nice lingering sticky sweetness in the finish also. Crispy carbo. Medium bodied. A very linear brew. Straight to the point and not too complex. Pretty solid"

"An interesting take on the lambic style I hadn't thought of. The appearance was a dark orange, almost red with a thin white head. The smell was full of bright fruit such as raspberry, but also a lot of pumpkin as well. The taste started with a lot of pumpkin and finished with a tart finish. Quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels like a weak pumpkin beer; like the base beer doesn't quite match the style, but the pie spice has been thrown in as an afterthought. Quite soft drink-esque."
""
""
""
"I am not one to say that I would jump off a cliff to gt a bottle of this, but it was still very enjoyable, and I could see myself with another glass in hand when this one comes around again. Seeing as I am fairly new to lambics, only having a few of the Kriek and Framboise styles, I did not have a lot to compare this to. For me, this was a very tasty experimental beer. We will see if anyone else releases a pumpkin lambic. Way to go Timmermans for creating something new here."
""
"This one's been sitting around since Halloween, might as well try it. Pours a clear dark orange with small insta-fade off white colored head. Smell: light pumpkin pie aroma, mild fruity tartness. Taste: green apple, spice cookie, sour candy. Don't get any pumpkin, but the tartness is refreshing. Easy to drink, but a bit high on carbonation, like sparkling cider. Buuurp. I wouldn't try it again, but it's not bad."

"O: Kind of an odd beer and I'm not sure what to make of it. It's kind of like drinking a sour pumpkin pie. It isn't terrible but it definitely isn't for everybody."
""

""
""
"Nice clean refreshing taste with dominant cinnamon flavor followed by a little nutmeg and cloves. Slightly sweet with some sour also. Nice orange amber color. Did not detect much pumpkin flavor at all. Overall I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor. Good to try once a year for the holidays."
""
""
""
""
"Poured at a good temperature with a large, foamy, cream-colored head that settles after a bit and a little lace. Color is a lovely clear red amber. Aroma is super mild, bare tart and spice. Flavors like nose with all qualities magnified; chiefly nutmeg and pumpkin, some tang, dry. Body is fairly thin and carbonation ok. Finish is like flavor, average length, not up to Timmermans usual standards."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale orange with Minark head. Nose starts with earthy notes followed by pumpkin flesh and some sweet notes, honey, and light vinegar. Taste starts with pumpkin and spices. This is followed up by a bit of honey and sweetness. This lambic definitely leans towards the sweet side of things. Mouthfeel is light and effervesnt. Overall, interesting but light in flavors."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great change of pace beer with a nice flavor that fell a little flat of greatness."
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of those beers that is so unique it is hard to rate. If you are expecting something along the lines of Good Gourd or Pumpking with an emphasis on the pumpkin pie spices, than you'll be disappointed. This is exactly what it sais it is, a pumpkin lamibic. With equal hints of spicy, sweet pumpkin and hints of sour."

"This Sour Pumpkin Ale is a beautiful exploration of what can be. But this variety's over-sweetened fruitiness lands it with a sense of over-doing it. It just becomes a bit too sweet. However I do think that this level of sweetness is necessary to allow the slimmest tinge of pumpkin aroma and flavor to annunciate."
""

"o: well. as i'm sure i've mentioned it is interesting. i like the idea, and its brewed well. the pumpkin and apple cider combination is ok, but not great. its a little pricey, so if you don't think you'd like the combination, it might not be worth it. i'd been curious for a while so i went for it. not blown away, but definitely not a drain pour"

"M: Lighter side of medium. Highly carbonated."
""
""
""
"I really like that this is nicely balanced, easy drinking, and not a giant sugary sweet mess. I think this might be my pumpkin beer of choice for the year. We may have a new champion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, only just okay. It's very sweet indeed and a little sickly, which really harms the drinkability as far as I'm concerned. The acidity is very much tamed and dumbed-down, and the pumpkin is almost just an afterthought: it's like the particular flavoured syrup that happens to have been put into this Starbucks lambic-lite."

"Being a big fan of pumpkin beers when I saw this pumpkin lambic I had to give it a try. This beer proves that price does not correlate with greatness. The appearance was excellent, a dark orange brown with frothy head. Unfortunately, after that everything fell off the cliff. The aroma was similar to Martinelli's Sparkling Cider with maraschino cherries. There were subtle notes of pumpkin pie spice, but nothing like a good framboise. The taste was even more disappointing: very little sweetness, watery sour apple peels and hints of pumpkin pie spices. Considering the high price, I really felt cheated. Where is the pumpkin?"

"Where's my pumpkin. Sweet and loaded with apple. Taste like a Lindemans."

"3.5 D: I never know what to make of sweetened lambics, but they always taste good. I feel like I'm drinking a soft drink half the time, but I guess it's not so bad."

"Hm, definitely pretty different but definitely still tasty. I kept battling in my mind whether this was more of a regular pumpkin ale or more of a lambic, and by the end - I still don't think I've decided. It's got characteristics of both, but just maybe not enough of the lambic qualities. Had this been a little more tart, it might be a different story."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/20/2012. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of tart green apple, pear, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, gingerbread, clove, pepper, brown sugar, toast, grass, and earthy yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; smells like apple pie with some pumpkin. Taste of tart green apple, pear, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, gingerbread, brown sugar, pie crust, grass, herbal, clove, and light yeast spiciness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, gingerbread, brown sugar, grass, pie crust, pepper, clove, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity of fruit and malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance; and almost zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, fairly crisp, and foamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected for 4%. Overall this is a very good non-soured fruit lambic. Nice malt/spice balance and complexity, with moderate tartness; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this quite a bit."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's interesting - like a gingerbread sour. I did like it a bit better on draft than in the bottle. The bottle was more musty and subdued."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with above average carbonation. Overall, it was a decent beer but the sugary fruits dominated a little too much. A little more of a funky, sour lambic presence could have really helped balance it out. It was a pretty unique and interesting beer overall though. I think they also could have labeled it apple pie instead of pumpkin and nobody would think it odd."
"O: This is definitely an interesting beer and one that I am glad I decided to pick up and try - there is a little too much apple/pear cider flavors/aromas in it to be great but definitely worth trying in my opinion. Very easy to drink but it almost reminds me of a combination apple and pumpkin pie."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and tastes a little like apple pie and pumpkin pie."
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White head, moderate retention. Mostly clear lacing, sticking to the glass. Light copper body. Aroma Includes a nice, earthy green apple-like pumpkiney flavor? Very slight horse blanket in the distant back ground. Taste is very cider-like with again, I suppose a faint pumkin flavor. Honestly the beer tastes more like a cider than a lambic. Doesn't taste bad at all, but totally unexpected."
""
""
""
"The feel is pretty fluffy and nicely crisp in a body that manages medium though it threatens thinness. The flow keeps up, though, and the carbonation almost builds up the body."
""
"Picked up a bottle at Rick’s in Alexandria. Served in a tumbler on Thanksgiving. Nose is somewhat acidic with quite a bit of spice. The flavor is overwhelming spice. Loads of pumpkin pie, and a bit cidery as well. Cider component really comes out as it warms, with the spice/cider combo making it taste like liquid Apple Jacks. Not a fan."
""
"O- this made a great dessert beer after my entree of quail. Not very strong in the pumpkin, but very enjoyable."
""
""
"OVERALL: A success from the worlds oldest Lambic brewery. The pumpkin was soft and let the other flavors come out more."
"This is an oddity of a beer. It's not really pumpkin, and it's not really a tart lambic. As long as you're not expecting that (and why would you given the name...ugghhh), it's really not a bad beer. I'd love to have this one with a hearty feast. I think it would pair nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As I said, not much pumpkin but plays like a cinnamon spiced apple cider. I can dig it. Not your typical pumpkin beer and a beer that could easily been a disaster gives somewhat complex and interesting flavors."
"this missed the mark for me, after a ton of anicipation. i thought this would be a fusion of two great styles, but instead it seems to take the worst elements of both rather than the best. opened with the thanksgiving feast, more sober than i usually am at that time. it pours a light hazy orange color, a little dull, with an inch of white bubbly froth. the nose is both sweet and tart at the same time. less funk or sour than i was hoping for, as call i can really smell is the spice profile usually associated with a pumpkin beer. flavor is really odd, and not totally nice. theres some allspice and clove up front, with a lot of brown sugar sweetness, but then a tart yeast comes in making the whole thing seem off, its almost vinegary, which doesnt compliment the fall flavors or aromas at all, and then the sugar comes back in the finish, making for one strange ride. nobody who i shared this with hated it, but we all thought it was a let down. thin body, effervescent carbonation, low alcohol, and just something flat out off. i dont know, as far as the style goes i thought the jolly pumpkin version did a much better job, but maybe these two styles of beer are incompatible after all..."
""
"Pours a hazy deep orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, a light sourness, with a note of spice. In the taste, sweet fruitiness, a mellow spice, and a small tartness. A small spice like bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small spice and a small tart fruitiness in the aftertaste. A bit sweet, but interestingly different."
""
""
"Overall: I was excited to try this when I saw it for sale but it falls into the category of sweetened Lambics and just is not that interesting"
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some apple cider and pumpkin pie spice aromas. Taste is much the same but only mildly sour. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it isn't all that sour and doesn't really have any real pumpkin aromas or flavors."
""
""
"*I had to muck with the appearance rating to get the letter grade I wanted. Please see my profile for more information about my ratings system."
"Beer is at first quite gourdy with big pumpkin up front, dry finish, second taste is all tart and then on out it is just tart. I don't think I like it and I won't have it again but I don't regret drinking it."
""
"Overall: I thought this was a very interesting beer. The words cinnamon lambic were used by more than one person. The pumpkin was overshadowed a bit, but I liked the beer."
""
"The beer is medium to medium-light in body, with a medium-level amount of carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is slightly thin, though carbonated enough to produce a slightly creamy or ""soft-bubbly"" effect. At times, this is a bit thin or watery across the palate and a bit dissastisfying as a result. Closes slightly dry, mostly wet, which likely arises from lack of acidity in the beer."
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip glass. Pours a medium pumpkin amber with a fine off-white two finger head with good retention and lots of lacing. Looks nice. Compelling aroma of light pumpkin, lambic yeast and seasonal spices; peppery. Initial flavor is pleasantly sharp and spicy, mostly from carbonation, developing into sweet / sour apple, pumpkin and pie spices, especially cinnamon. Finishes with spice bitterness and light, tart apple. Light bodied, as appropriate, with active and spicy carbonation. A very nice, refreshing light sparkling lambic with a nice seasonal combination of flavors. Surprisingly bright flavors for the low ABV."
""
"Not going back to the well on this one for sure."
"O - Like most sweetened lambics this has very little relation to a traditional lambic. It does work as a nice fall dessert beer that isn't too heavy, and I have to give it to Timmermans for being unique. Not worth the money though IMO as its closer to a thin bodied pumpkin spice ale."
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Very tea-like with earthy, natural tasting cinnamon flavoring and a bit of pumpkin. I am having a very difficult time putting down a fair reviewing score here. As a lambic this is a bit of a failure. As a pumpkin brew, it is ok. However, it was overall super unique and enjoyable...just much different from what might expext from the description."
"I'm glad I only paid a few bucks to try this on draft rather than a handful of money for a big bottle that I don't think I could finish by myself. The single glass is hard enough to finish."
"O: Let's face it…this style of beer does not sound particularly appealing. But honestly I found it quite enjoyable. I'm not a fan of a lot of pumpkin beers, but have enjoyed this one on multiple occasions. Recommended if you're looking for something different to celebrate the fall weather."
"This poured out as a nice orange color with a big white fizzy head on top. The retention is pretty good on this beer as well as some sticky lacing on the glass. The look of this is really quite nice. The smell of the beer has a subtle sourness on the nose but mostly dominated by spices and malt sweetness. The taste of the beer actually reminded me more of an apple spice more than a pumpkin spice. The mouthfeel was bubbly and light, it was a little on the warming side as well. Overall it was a good brew, not something I would need to buy again but it was fun to try."
"Pours an orange-tinged shade of amber. Mild haze. A couple fingers of sticky white head. Very good lacing. I'd be interested to know if the coloring is natural. I'd guess no. Aroma is light, mineral-ish lambic funk overlaid with fairly mild pumpkin pie spicing - nutmeg, cinnamon. Tends toward the cider side of lambics with little sourness. A touch of caramel sweetness. Taste is similar. This is a very light lambic and quite drinkable. I guess it's on the sweet side but not terribly so. Very mild pucker. Not too much spice. Mouthfeel is light with lots of creamy, gentle bubbles. This isn't a beer that's going to wow anyone, but it's light and enjoyable, and there's definitely nothing wrong with that. It's a fun, little pumpkin beer and an interesting spin on lambic."
"Overall unimpressive. It's hardly a lambic and has almost no pumpkin flavor. The spiced cider flavor is dominant and out of place. Definitely passing on this one in the future."
""
"D - Another pumpkin down!"

"Pours dirty gold in body with white bubbly head that forms a solid film over top. Aroma of fruit tartness, sour edges, subtle pumpkin slides through, and some funkin' spice. Whew, that's tasty. Dry character with light pumpkin, cinnamon, fruit tart with sharpness reminiscent of kiwi, mild funk and goat. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Dry body but some slickness is left on the tongue. Very refreshing. A lovely drink."
"Pumpkin Lambicus pours out a dull shade of faded orange with some gold spots popping out. The head is minimal and barely makes a dent. Flat looking after a minute or so, no stick on the way down. Swirls don't even bring anything back. The smell is subtle pumpkin with some spice, some buttery appeal, pale malt and pear. Not really tart scented. A small pucker on the first sips, with some faint pumpkin and subtle spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, all very light. The buttery appeal comes through in the taste as well with some plastic notes. Not all together real smelling/tasting, but not all together a horrible beer. I not a fan of Pumpkin beer or anything fall seasoned, yet I got through this one ok. The carb is minimal and barely there, and the body is light which aint all that bad. It just could use more bubbles. I think this is a good effort and with some more years of trying the same thing with a stronger/sturdy body, Timmermans may be on to something here, just get rid of the butter scents."

"750 ml bottle, back label says produced on 21/08/12 10:22. Served in a flute, the beer pours a clear golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and tart, it smells like apple cider, pumpkin, and pumpkin pie spices. It tastes like pumpkin pie, apple cider, brown sugar, and some light tart apples. It's more sweet than tart tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has a good amount of soft carbonation. It's also easy enough to drink. Overall I think this is a good and interesting brew. I wasn't sure what to think when I saw ""Pumpkin Lambic", but I'm glad I bought this, I liked it. $9.99 a bottle."
""
""
"Tastes good, but nothing else about it is all that appetizing. Still a good sessionable beer that I would drink again, but probably don't need to buy any more bottles."
"Incredibly drinkable. Gulpable. This 750mL bottle is going to be gone before I know it."
""
"Overall: Very different but really enjoyable. Not one to get several of, but one to come back to once a month or so during the fall. This is still going to be one of those beers I look forward to in the fall as I have never had anything like it."
""
"Pumpkin IPAs, pumpkin barleywines, and now pumpkin lambics. Sure, why not? Served in a snifter, pale orange-amber color with a slight haze, and a thin but well-retaining white head that receded to a wispy layer and rejuvenated with a quick swirl. Aroma was thin, but promised something tart and acidic with a bit of funk and spice. Taste wasn't overly sour or tart, but there was some of both there, citrus zest, apple skin, pumpkin flesh, hints of grassy funk, ginger, and very subtle spice...this wasn't a typical autumn-spice pumpkin beer. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, crisp and drying, interesting and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was pretty tasty, more of a gimmick to be honest. Not spectacular and a little too sweet but it's pretty much one of a kind and I can appreciate the effort."
"O-I was kind of skeptical of the pumpkin lambic but I am extremely pleased with this offering. The Belgian brewery did a fairly decent job. There's a lot of room for improvement, but for a fairly untouched style, this is impressive. One of the best pumpkin beers I've had."
""
"M/O - Light body and above average amount of carbonation. Leaves the palate with just a hint of cinnamon spice and a light tang-like finish. For a flavor/style combo that you rarely see this one is a treat and I very much enjoy it."
"O= This beer is a suprise. A wonderful mix of everything great about sour beers and pumpkin beers. Check this baby out because it's well worth it."
""
""
""
"Very cool idea. I was really excited to have tried this. It's off-the-wall enough to win me over. Timmermans isn't known for making their lambics very sour, so the mellow sweetness wasn't entirely unexpected. Until one of the other Belgian lambic brewers takes a stab at it, they have the monopoly on pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice burnt orange, moderate creamy head from nitro pour, good retention. Scent brings an unusual, but inviting, blend of pumpkin pie and tart earthiness. Taste combines a slice of pumpkin pie (good quantities of pumpkin, spice and malt sweetness) with a firm but not overly powerful tart, green appleish and earthy taste from the process. Medium bodied, nitro doesn't make the beer overly creamy. Unique, flavorful and would have more. Odd how the sourness can bring out the pumpkin notes even more - well constructed."
"Mikkeller opened my weird-ass-lambic door with his coffee-spiked Spontankoppi, and now I'm walking down the hall with a pumpkin lambic straight outta Belgium. Here goes nothin': It pours a clear golden-amber-orange topped by over a finger of off-white foam. Honestly, when I think ""pumpkin beer", this is what usually pops to mind (you know: something that looks like a friggin' pumpkin!). The nose comprises nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, dry wheat, and a touch of vague funk in the background. It's an odd combination that ends up being inoffensive and just a tad off-putting. The taste starts off with a short bit of mild wheat, then charges headlong right into some straight citric sourness. Near the finish, the sourness tapers off a bit and blends nicely into the aforementioned spices, the usual suspects of the pumpkin beer realm. It's a strange combination, really, but not a bad one surprisingly. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, definitely not your average flavored lambic. As things progress, the spices seem to soften in the face of an increasing sourness, but some funky wheat tries to take its place and keep the fight alive. There's something about this strange dichotomy of flavors that keeps me from completely enjoying it, in the strictest sense of the term, but I can't at all say it's bad. It's good, just in a confusing way..."
