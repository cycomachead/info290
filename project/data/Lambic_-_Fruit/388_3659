I could not help thinking of a cherry soda, since this beer has that type of feel. Not much foam forms at the head. This beer is pretty light, and I wouldn't say you can drink the whole bottle, but at least half easily.","JulioH","Sep 11, 2014"

I am usually more fond of framboise so now is the time to crack a LPF to see how it compares to this Kriek. If you have any 2012 vintage (10' sticker) Lou Pepe Kreik, it's drinking amazing right now. Unless you prefer bracingly sour beer, it probably can't get better than this at this point. Or who knows with the endless possibilities of aged Cantillon :).","MarcWP","Aug 12, 2014"

4.57,-0.7,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"2011 edition thanks to drlovemd87, this is special beer, and while not as tart as i expected it to be at this age, it has a lot going for it, thats for sure, and probably worth at least some of the hype it gets. the color is incredible, electric dark pink, hazy, with an oddly white head for how tinted the brew is. its glowing, intimidating, exciting, and about as colorful a beer as i have ever seen. the head doesnt go anywhere either. the nose on this is wonderful too, fruity, cherries obviously, all the way. i get the tart pie cherry type, or maybe even tarter ground cherry, but its certainly not the tree cherries we get around here. the yeast is amazing, its opened right up here, super summery, and funky as they get. timeless in some way, not dusty, but rustic and classy, insofar as those can be aromas flavors. the cherries carry through the whole flavor, starting just a little sweet, but finishing with a nice tartness, not mouthwatering or particularly sour, and with very little acidity, but like a slightly under ripe cherry, hard and yet to develop its sugars completely. the yeast works magically with this cherry complexion, floral and familiar, but higher end than anything i can recall. the beer is frustratingly easy drinking, given that these are so rare, expensive, and downright special, but this is in many ways a beer for massive consumption. it would never turn the stomach, its not that sour, and its low abv keeps it easy drinking too. the carbonation is splendid, all kinds of fizz to this, but never abrasive. its nowhere near as sour on the whole as anticipated, but this is a cream of the crop as far as funky beers go, especially fruited ones. infinitely superior to the lou pepe gueuze i think, and just an overall sensational and memorable beverage. a touch beer to dissect really, because the unity of the whole thing is so much more than the sum of its parts. i believe they call that synergy, and this beer exemplifies it. wow.","StonedTrippin","Mar 03, 2014"

4.27,-7.2,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Bottle from Tipples. Awesome score here and had to leave work early to snag it. 2010 sticker poured into a tulip on February 15, 2014. Pours bright bright darkish red and totally clear. Bright pink fizzy one finger head on top and dissipates quickly. Aroma of lots of vinegar, tart cherries and cherry skins. Flavor is sour vinegar up front and then lots of cherry skins and tart but sweet cherries. The balance here is outstanding. Not medicinal at all, cherry is highlighted but not overpowering like the New Glarus cherry brew, and it comes together beautifully. A nice vanilla oak in the backdrop that really mellows this out. Juicy cherries but lightly dry finish. Medium light mouthfeel, full flavored, and big bubbly carbonation. While cherry isn’t my favorite in beer, this balances it as perfectly as possible. Very nice.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2014"

The nose is a blast of sweet cherry wine (insert Tommy James reference, with or without Shondells), with a hint of light apple cider in the back for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the cherries come through with a bit of tartness, though with a clear restraint that keeps things from peeling the enamel from my teeth. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a very tasty cherry lambic, one that more than deserves the praise it receives.","TMoney2591","Feb 16, 2013"

The taste is actually a lot more subtle than I expected. It is definitely tart but it seems to be nicely balanced as well between the tart vs the sweetness. The mouthfeel is sharp and crisp, it feels clean and doesn't coat your mouth with any syrupy cherry flavors. Overall I enjoyed this actually.

Cherries and raspberries lead the charge onto the palate with some acidic notes quickly in tow. A sugary sweetness lingers with a moderate acidic tartness. The finish is primarily sour with a touch of hay funk. A smooth, even mouthfeel with low carbonation. Really on point here. Just lush and smooth as it rolls around in the mouth.

4.33,-5.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"2007 Vintage. Pours a dark red color with a medium, light pink head that disappeared quickly. Scent was quite acidic at first with sour cherries and other red berries. Tons of oak aromas with a subdued funky aroma (not one of the funkiest Cantillons I've had). Some spiciness with barnyard hay and some more berry...raspberry. Taste is very tart cherry at first, but casually transform to sweet and juicy. Slightly acidic with some lovely oak barrel flavors. Not the most sour Cantillon I've had, but very complex. Makes me wonder what this tasted like fresh. Probably like Cantillon Kriek. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer was fantastic. Not the best Cantillon I've had, but they're all so good and all so different (even when it's the same beer, just a different batch)...this one was great though!","DovaliHops","Jul 21, 2012"

4.5,-2.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek pours an almost intimidatingly vibrant ruby red. The two fingers of dark pink foam that crown the beer briefly, before disappearing without a trace, is similarly impressive in terms of vibrancy. The nose has a solid ripe cherry presence, before fading into aromas familiar to anyone who's had a great lambic. There's a little bit of wood (barrels? cherry pit? both?) that plays well with some of the more earthy brett aromatics. Meanwhile there's also some wet hay. The cherry aspect of the flavor profile has just a hint of sour/tartness to it, but otherwise it forms a nice opening before letting all those woody, earthy, and barnyard notes to fill out the beer. The body is light and crisp, with a positively champagne-like carbonation. Superb mouthfeel. This is my first time drinking one of Cantillon's Lou Pepe beers, and I'm not sure how much better this is than their regular kriek, but it's definitely a fantastic beer.","axeman9182","May 11, 2012"

4.97,8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Hard to review this one as I really found no flaw with it...in my eyes the perfect Kriek. Pours a hazy grapefruit pink body with an inch of pink coral head. Smell is brilliant. Fresh tart cherries, oak, slight tannic dryness, a touch of musty funk. Tastes flawless too. Starts off with a kick of fresh cherries, very tart but balanced acidity, lots of oak notes and a little barnyard wildness on the finish. Also picked up some floral, almost perfume-like, notes on the finish. Mouthfeel was less thin than the standard Kriek and perfectly carbonated even with the age. Overall, I can't see a Kriek exceeding this one. Not sure if the age made the difference here but it sure didn't hurt. Seek this one out and buy it if a recent vintage is on the shelf.","DrewZ926","Dec 29, 2011"

This beer opens with a lactic tart cherry hit, lots and lots of cherry/berry flavors, some pie crust in the taste and brett charecter and oak. On the finish this beer is like a perfect sour cherry.

4.2,-8.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Split a bottle with a friend. Ah, this is the way fruit beers should be. The cherries complement the base beer without overpowering or oversweetening. There's still that biting citric sour character, but with a gentle layer of the fruit blending in with the funk. That said, this wasn't a life-changing lambic worth the extra cost of a Lou Pepe, but a fine example of the kriek style.","tempest","Nov 06, 2011"
4.18,-9.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Sharp and sour with a very enjoyable earthy cherry flavor that doesn't retain any residual sweetness. There is seemingly no alcohol impact on this brew. It carries with it a pretty big salivation factor. I couldn't get enough of this. Surprisingly for being the same vintage as what I had on tap recently, the experience from on tap verse the bottle is drastically different. This bottle was more sour like the normal Cantillon offering while on tap it was much more fruited and sweet tasting. Certainly worth a try by either means.","stakem","Nov 03, 2011"

The taste is big cherry and a mild amount of sourness or funk. Not particularly sweet, which is nice. It actually drinks quite easily and is almost surprisingly quaffable. Good carbonation, not too excessive like some sours seem to get. Overall, I think I was expecting more, but quite enjoyed what was delivered.","seeswo","Oct 10, 2011"

You can tell it is going to be a puckering beer as soon as you smell it.

There is a mild funk, but I didn't detect it here nearly as much as some of the other cantillon they had there. The flavor is eerily like cherry pie. Cooked cherries with a tartness and a little too much sweetness, but only a little bit. Mouthfeel is nice and light with lively carbonation. I really enjoy this beer.

First sip is mouthwater puckering that hits both the front and back of the mouth. Cherries and wood dominate. Lightly bodied.","ATLbeerDog","Jul 24, 2011"
4.89,6.3,4,5,5,4.5,5,"It's an opaque, ruby red with a shocking amount of carbonation considering the complete lack of head.

4.62,0.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"The palate opens with a brilliant blend of bright cherries, a little leather and a dense, complex parquet of cherries and lambic. I can't really describe it better than saying that that's what I want a kriek to taste like - intensely sour but never wearing on the palate, incredibly fruity but never "girly", pleasantly oraky and moderately tannic with an illustrative blend of oak tannins and skin tannins. Soft, frothy and fluffy on the palate with a mildly fruity and pulpy character, this beer is a masterpiece on the palate. I drank about 25oz, and could have gone for another 25 if I didn't have to go home. A stellar kriek, I'm being stingy here only because I think the 07 was the best possible kriek there is, and this isn't quite there yet.","DefenCorps","Jun 29, 2011"

Nose expresses tart cherries up front, followed by a sweet quality and some sourness, perhaps grapefruit seeds. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of a cinnamon character reminiscent of atomic fireballs, as well as vinegary cherries and a saltiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation that falls just short of being still. Acidity and astringency stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks.

4.8,4.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"a phenomenal beer every time. fresh, aged, whatever. reviewing the 2008 (bottled 2010) version. pours a glowing red with a lively pink head that shrinks to a collar pretty quickly. collar stays around the whole time. very pretty. nose reveals many layers of different fruit (strawberry, cherry, citrus), earth, must, funk, cobweb, vanilla, oak, and what is coming off to me like almond paste (like the semi-sweet chalky/pasty stuff in the little metal tube they use for those delicious Moroccan cookies). wow. there are wine barrel hints in there in the back end for sure as well that brings almost like a bloody minerality. taste is divine. the brightness of the cherry and tartness hit first, but before sour can take over, edges are rounded out by vanilla, wood and nuttiness, while grapefruit pith notes come in adding a touch of bitterness that helps lift everything back off the palate. once again, something very reminiscent of wine comes through in the back end of the taste, and if it isn't wine barrel aged, i'd be surprised. creamy, medium-full body that tingles just a bit from moderately prickly carbonation drinkability? i could drink this all night, and everything about it makes it feel like a special occasion. epic good. cantillon does it again.","timtim","Feb 16, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight sour, funk, and raspberries. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, and raspberries. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation.

Nose is sour and funky with just a hint of vinegar and lactic acid, some vanilla oak, and a very fresh cherry aroma that also has a hint of sweetness. Most Krieks I have tried smell more like a Kirsch brandy, where the cherries here smell much more fresh. The flavor starts off very sour and acidic, but quickly and seamlessly moves to the oak vanilla and very fresh cherries that throughout seem to give an illusion of sweetness, but I don't think that there is anything sweet to this beer at all.

Poured a darker shade than the Kriek, quite opaque and deep, like a rich mahogany, with a fluffy, pink cotton candy head. Much more dry than the regular Kriek, rife with a deep cherry pit and funk that were tied together seamlessly. As with most Cantillons it was really tight, dry, and sour. I was thinking "black cherries" the whole time where I didn't really think that from the regular Kriek. I've had several vintages of this, and at different ages, and it's always sublime.

It tastes about as highly sour as my senses can register, there could not be a more sour initial taste. Puckering and enamel-etching, and delicious throughout, at least based on my current tastes. The sour flavors don't last in the after-taste, there's more a mix of cherry sweetness and some kind of saltiness. Excellent.

The fruit was almost completely faded and it was insanely funky. This beer has hints of earthy oak and plenty of sour barnyard funk that balance out the cherries and sugar added but again the cherries are prominent.

Incredible tartness works the side of the tongue, but the sweetness of the cherries and malt balances this and makes it into something divine. Lots of lemon and citrus zest and some grapefruit.

The nose is of tart cherries, of course, along with an almost medicinally citric sourness. The acidity is pungent, and the aromatic experience is not dissimilar from smelling mentholatum. Much less sour than I expected, but there is a wonderfully full tart cherry flavor. Every bit of the fruit's flavor ended up in the beer, which is a triumph in my book. Some leathery and bitter orange flavors emerge around the edges. Crisp but unobtrusive carbonation, light yet substantial heft, and fairly dry finish that is somewhat muted by the impressive cherry flavor.

The taste is an explosion of vibrant sour cherry, a nice zingy acetic sourness, spicy oak, and a tart finish. Not particularly funky, but there is a slight hint of ripe cheese in the depth of this beer. Very complex and deep. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and quite smooth.

Also a fair amount of fruit and a very mild yeast influence. Flavor is of the best aged lambics. Mildly funky at first with a typical sour punch in the mouth that isn't overly powerful. Definite wood influence on the palate. Calmly there, but not overpowering at all. Feel is typical. Not a ton of bubble, but a little bit. Extremely drinkable. In my limited experience with lambics, this is by far the best I have had. And rightly so for $21 a bottle. If you see it, try it. Worth the money IMO. Bloody marvelous.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"

A really beautiful - perfect - appearence. A pungeant funk aroma. Not fruity - certainly gueuzey though. Surprisingly not much fruit in the taste either. I might not have guessed this is a kriek. Perhaps the fruit aspect has softened with the time its been aged ? Whatever the case any fruit notes are certainly faded (at best!) That however, would be the only thing I could hold against this beer. This is a sipper, only if you can resist the urge I had to keep going back for more. More of a "puckerer" than a "sipper". You lick your lips and it's like you just ate a ton of sour candy. Leaves that sugary residue in the mouth/on the lips. So sour - it's fantastic. This actually has become like a crazy rose wine in many ways. That may be the msot accurate way to describe it. It really burns a hole in the of the mouth. Kinda burns! And this is at 7 years old - again, fantastic. Very tart. I could have used more flavour but the whole experience of the mouthfeel is nothing short of incredible.

The smell invites me, "Drink me. Drink me." So I do. And I'm not disappointed. Tart, acidic tones hit up front. Sour and puckering. But in that good, lambic sort of way. (Or in reality, I should say, "in that good, Cantillon sort of way." Because not many do them as good as Cantillon.) There's a nice cherry pie sensation, but this beer is more about the funk and tart than it is the sweet. Cherry tones are juicy, yet tart. The funky barnyard tones are present, but subdued, and enjoyable. Oh yeah, bring it on. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly. A bit cleansing. And the body is about medium or so. This one is incredibly drinkable. Glad I've got her all to myself.","Bighuge","Sep 02, 2004"

4.2,-8.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"No head whatsoever over the deep red liquid. The appearance tempted a few ladies in our party to try my "fruit beer", but they were not impressed. Oh well, their loss is my gain, more for me. Aroma is the expected Cantillon lambic funk, which I won't even attempt to put into words, if you've had one you know what I speak of. Suffice it to say, after many different brews from them, apparently this is the way it is supposed to be. Flavor is a duet of sourness and cherry splendidness, which is an event for the taste buds. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, I will enjoy Cantillons whenever I can, for they are such rarities around here, and should be enjoyed as such.","ppoitras","Jun 05, 2004"
3.94,-14.3,5,3.5,4,5,3.5,"Enjoyed with Oakes, tiggmtl, kimchee and martint thanks to Nexxus. It pours a beautiful dark bloody red with a short-lasting pinkish head. Aroma is not too intense for a lambic although some of the characteristics I look for are in there. Blood orange meets cherries, strwaberries, blood, leaves, cinnamon... As it warms up, theres a solvent or toothpaste quality emerging and it seems far less complex like a minty cranberry juice. In mouth though, the cherry flavors is good and clean. Its quite sour, cherry flavored lemon juice alike, but the acidity is clearly mostly lactic. Orange fruity flavors, dry finish which is surprisingly not too astringent. Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. Im impressed at how this is still somehow well balanced and rather thick. Accessible Cantillon, but the best? I think not.","Rastacouere","May 23, 2004"
4.42,-3.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Got this at Monk's back bar. It poured a hazy crimson and had no head. There is some barnyard and cherrty in the aroma. There is little carbonation in the beer, but it doen't really detract from from this fine beer. The sour cherry is up front and then the funkiness hits. It finishes with some vanilla and a slight woodiness. It is not as complex as the botled version, but more mellow. Still it is excellent.","ark57","Apr 19, 2004"
4.73,2.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I shared a bottle of this which was bought at Cantillon after we toured the place. Seeing it in person made me appreciate Cantillon beers so much more. Anyway, this Lou Pepe Kriek was pretty damn good. I'm pretty sure it made me smile. It poured a deep but not dark red colour with a light pink head. Very nice to look at. It had that funky lambic smell to it in the background, along with cherries and spices. Reminded me a bit of Quelque Chose but not as sweet. Taste was again full of cherries and spice, like cherry pie kind of, very mellow compared to other Cantillons I'd sampled. I wonder if it's because it's straight from the brewery so it's so fresh? Don't know, but it's good. It was soft in my mouth, not syrupy at all for how fruity it is, and yeah, I could drink lots more of it if it were around. Definitely worth trying, especially if you can get it from Mr. Van Roy himself!","erica","Apr 07, 2004"
4.72,2.6,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"The tasted is softly acidic (for a Lambic) and it is accompanied by a rich body. There is a definite dry, tart, tannic cherry note here. The time spent on the cherries seems to have increased the body quite substantially. This is quite good, and quite different from what I was expecting. It is a bit softer, and a bit better integrated than the standard Cantillon beers. It is nicely sour, with notes of citrus & vinegar. The finish is woody and reminds me of cherry skins. This is certainly a beer I could drink a lot of. The cherry flavor is quite good in this beer. There is no sticky sweetness, like that found in the more commercial versions, instead there are these intense, chewy, mouth filling, cherry skin, dry, tart flavors that just proclaims that there are cherries in this Lambic. I really like this, and it certainly has grown on me as I finish the bottle.","Gueuzedude","Apr 03, 2004"
4.61,0.2,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"In the end: Highly recommended by me, and absolutely amazing fresh. It may be $30 here in the states, but it is still worth every penny. C'mon treat yourself!","francisweizen","Mar 31, 2004"
4,-13,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at Monks. Slightly cloudy dark red low carbonated look in the glass. Nice cherry/musty nose. Intense sour cherry hourse blanket barnyard laden taste. Abusive to the palate. As you drink the brew mellows on the back of the tongue and refreshes. I liked it but this is sure not for everyone due to it's intensity. Viscous mouth with a dry tart cherry finish. Crafted and blended by an artist. An experience.. not just a beer, and not one you could drink alot of in a row but a great apartif.","frank4sail","Mar 29, 2004"
3.88,-15.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a deep burgandy with a rim of pink foam. Smell is vinegar, open air, hint of fruitiness. The taste leads with cherries quickly overpowered by sour vinegar notes, while the finish is dominated by cherries and an acetone-like flavor. Mouthfeel is very soft compared to the other Cantillons I've had - no harsh drying astringency in the finish, just a smooth road to the next sip. Very drinkable, but I prefer the Lou Pepe framboise.","jlervine","Mar 09, 2004"
3.25,-29.3,3,3,4,2.5,2.5,"Pinkish head, dark red color, sour sour sour cherry flavor and aroma, with some leather & other stinky notes. There must be a great food match for this beer b/c it's tough to drink by itself. Perhaps some marscapone? Boon's Mariage Parfait Kriek is so much better","jcalabre","Feb 19, 2004"
4.05,-12,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This lambic poured a hazy, ruby color with no foam at all. The smell was a modest sour cherry aroma -- nice but subdued. The taste was tart cherry, somewhat sour, with a bit of horse blanket. A very good flavor overall. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp and tart with medium body and low carbonation. The slightly sour cherry flavor lingered pleasantly on the tongue. This was a very good kriek lambic, good to the last drop.","UncleJimbo","Feb 08, 2004"
4.15,-9.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I had two of these, and could have kept drinking them, it's very good. Dark cherry color when poured, opaque. No head. Aroma is of fresh cherries, with some barnyard meets cinnamon. Taste has a measure of tartness, I actually didn't think this was as tart as the regular kriek. Very enjoyable, I also noticed some dry mustiness in the finish.","PatandDavid","Feb 01, 2004"
4.03,-12.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Dark purpley red with a fluffy pink head. True lambic aroma, sour, horses. Cherries of course. The flavor is SOUR. So sour the tongue mistranslates it as almost salty. Past that there's a lot going on underneath. Cherry is subtle here. Not the sweet soda beer of Lindeman's (which I do admit having a soft spot for) and instead a true lambic with the flavor of the fruit.","aracauna","Jan 05, 2004"
4.2,-8.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A very good brew. Not as assertive as some of there others stuff, but very tasty all the same. smelly barnyard/dirty nappy aroma. Very sour and quite tart, complex array of flavours attack the crap out for tongue, very sour, yummy and even refreshing, i'm yet to have a shitty beer from Cantillon.","rastaman","Jul 29, 2002"
4.5,-2.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A true rare treat enjoyed at the Boston Beer Summit.  Pure, unadulterated cherry lambic beer.  No blending.  Clean cherry aroma, slightly sour and band-aid like with a hint of being tart.  Flavor is a strong mix of band-aid and sour tartness.  Cherry flavor doesn't come through but is enjoyable nonetheless.","Andy","May 12, 2002"
