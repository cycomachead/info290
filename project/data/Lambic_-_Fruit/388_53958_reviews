"My first Cantillon! 2013 Vintage. Had a strong barnyard/hay nose, taste was extremely funky but also crisp and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Tasted amazing.  Smelled like I was working a cat with a UTI.  Horrible, but awesome at the same time."
""
""
"Taste evolved as the beer warmed over several hours. I recommend drinking this beer closer to room temperature. The elderflower takes center stage of this lambic and showcases as green, herbal, medicinal, floral and peppery. It's quite unlike any other Cantillon or for that matter any other beer I have tasted. The green pepper flavor is off putting at first but opens up into something that is quite interesting and complex. Wet grass, pungent fresh cut weeds, a sweet floral aroma and a peppery floral overtone. The lambic base is sour, funky and slightly cheesy. A nice experience for sure but I'd choose a classic geuze next time."
""
""
""
""
"O: Uniquely flavored lambic like Cantillon knows best. I'm not very familiar with elderflower in any other context so it would be hard for me to identify the exact contribution on the beer but the floral to wet leafs nose and flavor would be my assumption. Nice beer overall"

"-- Weird one. Big perfume, lots of metallic bitterness, and a blast of funk. A bit too astringent at then end - fragrant but not sweet. Interesting and well done, if hard work. 4"

"Smell is sour, traces of oranges and spices. In mouth, sour lambic explodes followed by tropical aromas (citrus and orange. Bitterness is sour and bitter. Nice Cantillon again."

"Had it on tap on Zwanze Day 2014.  Outstanding."
""
"Lemonade infused with dandelions, ginger, and cat pee. Palate just as spicy - white peppercorn, medicinal herbs. Also apricot preserves. A good beer but better in small quantities due to intense herbal flavor."
""
""
""
"Very good as expected."

"mamouche has been a whale for me, so getting a full pour on tap at hops and pie yesterday was a delightful treat, unexpected, and fully wonderful and up to the hype. elderflower can be so soft or so intense, and using it right in anything from lotion to tea can be a balancing act, which is why i am so impressed with the beer here. at its base is a lambic i know and love from cantillon, perfectly mixed between musty woody funk and lactic sourness, with a fuller bodied wheat base and only as much carbonation as is absolutely necessary to keep it moving. the difference here is this delicate blooming elderflower presence that transports me to distant fields in nicer weather with warm breezes blowing endlessly. its beautiful. not the least bit perfumy, but absolutely brightly floral in the smell, while it takes on a bit more bitterness in the flavor, but not a hop bitterness that comes at the end. its all up front here, and the softness of the floral smell is never lost among the intensity of the base beer, which is a wonderful testament to the artisan skills of the brewer, as if we needed another from cantillon right? this is as well refined as anything they make, more interesting than many, and frankly just absolutely delicious sour beer. the elderflower is used to perfection here, and while i also enjoyed the mikkeller spontan version, i think the cantillon adds more than just lactic acidity, but also a beautiful oak and funk profile that makes this a much more layered and complex drink. elite stuff worthy of trying at nearly any cost."
""
""
"Well, I gotta give this one credit for providing flavours that were, on the whole, new to me, and agreeable enough, at that - the peppery florals go a long way in ameliorating the harsh acidity still present (it is Cantillon, after all), and the funk keeps mostly to itself. Good, and interesting overall, but I can't quite say that the stiff shelf tag (even for these guys) would be really worth having another go, even if presented the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I wasn’t sure that I would enjoy an elderflower sour as much as I do the more traditional fruited lambics, however after a just a few sips I am convinced! Mamouche easily ranks as one of my favourite Cantillons and I will certainly be purchasing it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting but not particularly tasty due to some of the weirder elements. Smells amazing though!"
""
"M: Very dry but only lightly carbonated for Cantillon."
""
"June 26, 2013 corked and capped 750 ml bottle from Tipples. Pours hazy golden almost tangerine color with a half finger of white fizzy head that quickly recedes. Aroma...well this is interesting. Peaches, vinegar, floral notes, light dry oak and sourness, and yes, dill pickles. Somehow not off-putting though and the sweet peachy smell is nice. Flavor is pickle juice, sour vinegar funk, dry oak, light peaches or apricots. Weird. Light bodied but sweet with prickly high carbonation. Finishes dry. This is unique to say the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - As usual for this brewery, it was solid all around and could be considered a staple example of a lambic, but the elderflowers really do make this one special. It will be interesting to see how this will age, but I am more tempted to drink this fresh while I can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to say, this beer is unique. I think I'm enjoying this more than most other people. It seems to be less appreciated among the Cantillon lineup. I personally can find little faults in it. If you've never chewed on a piece of prairie grass or flower while out on a hike or other outdoor activity and enjoyed it, then you might not be a fan of this beer. Sometimes you want to feel closer to Mother Earth, and if you want to do that while enjoying a beer in your living room, seek this beer out to do it!"

"Overall: Way different than I could have expected. The flavor is very plant influenced, and it is unlike any beverage I've consumed. Definitely not my favorite Cantillon, but is very interesting and worth a try."
""
""
""
"O-another solid Cantillon lambic, found the floral and herbal notes of the elder flowers quite enjoyable"
""
""
"O - Glad I tried it but not one I'd pursue regularly."
""
""
""
""
"As every other beer I've had from Cantillon, this one is just great. The fact that it's a little different than the other varieties I've had makes it that much more special, and the fact that it was completely out-of-the-blue makes it just unspeakably awesome. The only drawback is that I now have one more fantastic 'Loon beer that it will be hard to resist paying an arm and a leg for anytime I see it randomly appear on a shelf or online."
""
""
"O - Phenomenal, but probably my least favorite Cantillon thus far. The green pepper tonasco flavor really threw me off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the most interesting beers I've ever had. The flavors imparted by the elderflowers are unique and unexpected, but they end up working well with the base lambic. A bit less drinkable then most other Cantillons but still a great beer that's worth seeking out to try at least once."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-light intensity, resulting in a beer that is foamy (2/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5), a very satisfying, full and gently rolling mouthfeel that's perfect for this or any sour beer. Closes surprisingly semi-dry, with light to moderate stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
"A good Cantillon but not a great beer, the floral notes overpower a little."

""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. I can see why some people hate it, but I absolutely love it. It is very unique and masterfully executed. It made the Cantillon Iris next to it seem like such an uninteresting, bitter lambic. Eduardo, can you please send me another bottle?"

"I had no expectations for this one but for me the elderflower addition gave off a nice herbal and floral feel that combined amazingly with the Cantillon funk. Might be my favorite of their beers so far."

"750 ml capped and corked bottle, bottled on 07 June 2012. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours golden/orange with about an inch off-white head that didn't stay around for very long. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and tart, the brew smells like tart lemon, herbs/flowers (which I assume is from the elderflowers), oak, and some funk. It tastes like tart citrus, elderflowers (herbal/floral taste), green pepper, funk, oak, and some apricot. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's well carbonated and enjoyable to drink. I thought this was a good brew, I'd like to pick up another bottle at some point. Bottle from Etre Gourmet."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very interesting brew with intense flavors."
""
""
""

""

""
"Overall, very good. Despite the characteristic Cantillon sourness, it is a rather delicate beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice muted version of gueuze with light floral and funk presence. Really liked this and could sit and drink for awhile. Reminded me of classic but a bit softer with the elderflower presence"
""
""
""
"O: My goodness. I enjoyed this beer immensely. I don't even know what to say, other than this might be my favorite of all the Cantillons I have tried before. So delicious. I need to seek out more of this for future consumption."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a dry, musty barnyard funk presence that lingers over light fruit notes, pale malts,  musty brett and toasted oak into a slightly acetic, dry finish.  The sourness is kind of tame but there is a lot of farmhouse/barnyard character and lactic funk, especially creamy cheesiness in the back end.  Flower petals are also really prominent adding an odd, lingering bitterness.  Not overly complex or as sour as I like from cantillon but packs plenty of funky bitterness and unique flavor.  "
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. A unique experience. One of the best Cantillon I've ever had"
"OVERALL: This is definitely a flower dominant lambic. The floral aroma and flavor really do take the lead here, which, unfortunately, quickly became quite challenging. I understand that many people quite enjoy this one, but for me, at this point at least, I found this difficult and didn't go back for a second pour. Not something I'd want to drink again for the next little while at least. At least not this fresh. Perhaps a couple years in the bottle would make a big difference."

"Overall. The most interesting beer from this brewery that I've tried so far, wasn't expecting the herby aspect. Thanks again for this treat from across the pond, Jeff!"

"Poured a light pale golden orange in color with pale yellow highlights and a thin bubbly head that leaves nice wisps of lacing sticking to the glass. Definitely has the signature cantillon bretty barnyard funk character wtih nice citrus, good acidic in the nose, slight pineapple and mango fruit and oaky wood. The wood oakiness with barnyard bretty funk meld very well with citrusy accents, mild grapefruit twang, pineapple notes and a touch of corky flavor. The brew was light to medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a funky bretty horseblanket, citrusy oaky sour and slight dry finish. Finally got to try it and I wasn't dissapointed at all."
"Fun to try and extremely drinkable. The vegetal bell pepper of this took me by surprise."

"Bottled June 8, 2012. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a large white head that goes down quickly. Scent is...oh my...weird. Smells like dirt. Probably the least appealing Cantillon aroma I've ever smelled. Once I give it another whiff, I get more than just dirt. There is definitely the earthy dirt notes, but there is also a clean, fresh-cut bell pepper aroma. Bell pepper, dirt, and funky sour notes mesh for quite an interesting aroma that can grow on you after a few whiffs. Taste is very vegetal at first, with a good amount of sour. The bell pepper and vegetable come through in the flavor, leaving the dirt aroma behind in the nose. No dirt flavor...very tasty actually. Refreshing vegetable and sour flavors. Slight acidity, but not much. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, almost puckering sour. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is the most bizarre Cantillon I have ever had. However, I respect them for creating something outside the norm of lambic. The vegetable notes are superb on this beer."
""
"Overall: This beer was like nothing I've ever had before, and I loved it. Probably my favorite Cantillon to date."
""
"O-this is some delicious stuff, executed wonderfully. Not my favorite type of sour but unique and well above average."
"Enjoyed this one while pre-gaming going out jazz club hopping in New Orleans at Avenue Pub! Served from tap into a wine glass. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, bell pepper, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, bell pepper, floral, sour, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. When I had this out of the bottle back at Zwanze Day 2011 I experienced a bell pepper flavor and I thought that it might have been a figment of my imagination. Now that I’ve got to have it on tap as well and still pick up on the bell pepper it appears to be pretty solid evidence. There is nothing wrong with this fact at all though as it actually seemed to fit in quite nicely with the brew and add a nice earthiness to it. A well done brew that I can’t wait to see how it ages in the bottles I have laid down in the cellar."
"Pours a cloudy golden body with a thick white head that faded to a good lasting film. This beer smells like no other I’ve had, but that’s probably because I’ve never even hear of an elderflower before this. The nose is very peppery, like that of a red bell pepper, and vegetal. That characteristic musty Cantillon funk is right in there next to the strange notes of bell pepper and citrus. Smells like a musty of garden. The taste is better than the nose in my opinion as a little bit more funk and lemony citrus mixes with the pepper and vegetables, but overall this isn’t my favorite lambic. The mouthfeel is very airy, bubbly and fairly dry. I’d like to try a bottle of this beer in a few years when it’s had at least half a decade of age on it to see how it has changed. Definitely an interesting brew."
""
"O-Might be my least favorite Cantillon to date. I can see why others would like this, but I think I prefer Iris in comparison to this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-light body, medium carbonation, crisp, easy to drink, average acidity and sourness, doesn’t assault the mouth and gullet. This definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea but I was a fan."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I just can't get behind this offering. As we discussed at the table, you either love it or you hate it, but even if you love it, more than a 6 oz offering could become a task. If you are adverse to any sort of herbal/floral beers, avoid this for sure."
"Jean Van Roy is my hero, but I truly question the decision to blend delicate lambic with a flavor this dominant. By far the worst lambic Cantillon has produced IMO."
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting, for sure, but I don't care for it as much as the sours that use other adjuncts"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very floral and herbal aroma with those elements dominating the taste as well. The sourness in this beer is either harsh or appears so, I cannot tell. Mouthfeel is excellent but this beer is not doing it for me even though I find myself going back for another whiff and another sip. I am glad to have had it but it either is not as good as other Cantillons, or challenges my palate so much that I am baffled. Regardless it is fairly above average compared to some other swill (Mariage Parfait, I am looking at you!)."
""
""
"As far as unique experiences, this ranks a 5. I've never had a beer that's really been remotely close to this, however if you line up Cantillons and force me to pick one, this would be near the bottom of the list. Not sure what age does to this, but a fairly fresh bottle is mostly pepper and nothing else."
""
""
""
""
"O- excellent marriage of fruity sweetness, botanical pepperyness and lactic acidity."
"Bottle shared at Woodshop 7 at Beachwood BBQ in Long Beach. Light peachy color with a small white head. Strange floral scent, obviously the elderberry flowers. Plenty of acidity but rather subdued flavor, mainly your typical funky lemony citrus pith notes with a touch of bitterness."
""
"D - one of the more interesting Cantillon offerings I have tried to date. I think I prefer their wine barrel and fruit lambics over this venture into the plant world. Although it's harder to get it's worth a shot, as are any in Cantillon's line up."
""
""
""
"o: Great peppery gueuze-like lambik. Really interesting! and unlike other Cantillon's I have had."
""
""
"Mamouche pours an opaque light orange, with minimal white foam capping the beer. The nose has a lot of funk to it, with a bit of acidity present as well. There's just a faint hint of oak, and a subtle spicy-herbal aroma that seems to build in intensity a bit as the beer warms. The flavor has much more pepper/herbs to it, with a light touch of fruitiness shining through as well. There's some wet hay, barnyard funk, but definitely not as much as in the nose. Can't really say the beer tastes tart or sour either. The carbonation is nice and bubbly, but the body is noticeably more full/chewy than you'd normally expect for the style. Mamouche is a decent wild ale, but definitely not up to the usual standards of what I expect from Cantillon."
""
""
""
""
"I know this is kind of a love/hate Cantillon; I really really enjoy it. This is delicious. The aroma really hooked me."
""
"Nice of Monk's to have this one on tap at their latest Cantillon event. I actually had not had this before, so I figured I'd give it a try. Poured a hazy golden-yellow color with a small cap of delicate white bubbles that faded to a ringlet, streaking the glass with lacing until the last drop. Champagne-like bubbles blipped from the bottom of the chalice. Aroma of barnyard funk and wildflowers. Crisp taste, more of the characteristics noted in the nose: wet grass, cardboard, very floral, tart, but not overly so; mid- to end-palate displays heavy flavors of green peppers, pickle brine, and a touch of white wine and cheap Champagne (ps - all Champagne tastes like cheap Champagne to me). Light body, prickly, and quite drying, as expected for the style. Decent overall."
""
""
"Wow. This is an exceptional beer from Cantillon as part of a strong range of exceptional beers. It's a lovely twist to a really well made lambic. Amazing stuff."
""
"Similar flavors, bell pepper, green organics, cracked pepper spiciness, lightly floral, less so in Zwanze 09 vs Mamouche 11. Medium bodied, dry with lingering spice. Unique and tasty."
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with an orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with a very nice floral presence from the Elder flowers. Taste is much the same with a slightly bitter quality on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good lambic with a nice floral presence in the smell and taste."
"O: Glad to have finally tried this. I have been waiting about 8 months since Oktoberfest to open one of these in the spring and today was the perfect occasion. Highly recommend doing this after finishing a long afternoon of yardwork."
"O- A really nice beer, the elder flower flavor is really interesting and makes for a complex, fascinating beer."
"O: One of my favorite lambics. I really liked the elderflower smell and how much the flavor followed. I mostly find fruit lambics have the sourness overwhelm the extra flavor and that didnt happen here. Very nice."
""
""
"O: The flavors were light and slightly restrained. It was still a nice beer, but wasn't all that tart or sour."
"D - Definitely my favorite Cantillon so far, would like to put this up against fresh Gambrinus side-to-side, I definitely wouldn't want to age this much, that fresh berry is just so damn good."
"O - Ahhh... I love Cantillon! A Spring Time wonder."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: This was good and I loved the nose, but it's too bitter for my preference and the astringency is a bit distracting. I'm not sure that I'll buy this again, but it was worth a try."
"A really nice, different lambic. The flowery character really works. Well balanced."
""
""
"Elderflower is one of my favorite flavors, and Mamouche is a nice display of it. Balanced, spicy, herbal — it tastes like a handful of spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yeah, the beer was sour, floral and all that, but I thought the pepper was a distraction. Ultimately, this one kind of fits the bill that the more rare Cantillons aren't worth pursuing. I have a bottle, so I'll get to try it again, but for now, this is one of the more disappointing Cantillons I've had, even if it is a decent beer, it doesn't compare to their more accessible beers like the kriek or classic gueuze. A pretty dry beer all around as well."
""
""
"O: This was my first experience drinking a Cantillon beer and I think I am hooked. Thank goodness my sister in law lives on Belgium and can start hunting these down for me."
""
"This is not as aggressively flavored with Elder Flowers as was the Zwanze version, but it still forms a significant portion of the flavor profile. It does work though, but it may take a bit of getting used to the peppery, somewhat astringent, green sap like flavors that the elder flowers contribute. This is a quite interesting, thoroughly enjoyable beer (it is a Cantillon though, so, coming from me, that should be taken with a grain of salt)."
""
"Kinda thin an oily feeling."
"Very awesome."
""
""
"This was a pricey, hard to find 10oz of beer...but worth it to try once."
""
"O-- Not really a sour person, per say, as my reviews are of IPA, DIPA, and IS but this is very approachable. Probably a good lambic to start off with. Just my opinion but a better option to drink fresh than age."
"The color on this is an indescribably wonderful golden orange. The head starts off about 2 inches high in a snifter and over the next two or three minutes gradually settles into a semi-thin white layer with visible carbonation on the side of the glass. The nose starts off tart if a little musty, but finishes with some spice, plums, grapefruit and floral aroma. This one is incredibly complex upon first sip! Starts off a little spicy, as in serrano pepper, but quickly reveals many more layers. The elderflower is present, but very subtle lending some floral notes and grapefruit along with the lemony tartness that is evident without dominating. Many other flavors emerge such as ripe apples, The mouthfeel is phenomenal. There is ample carbonation, but the texture is creamy and culminates in superb balance. The low abv makes this easy to drink the whole bottle to yourself, or start your night by sharing with others. Well worth the hype, Cantillon has yet to disappoint me."
"Zwanze 2009. Pour is a hazed golden amber with a tight bubly head. The nose has the dusty funk found in so many cantillons with notes of lemon and a huge blast of flower petals. There is a hot type spice and its a little seedy. The taste follows the nose, juicy citrus up front, a dusty funk takes over with the huge flower petal that takes over. A jalepeno spice has an interesting presence with more citrusy flavors and some light bitterness. The body is light and creamy but has an active carbonation and a very dry finish. Extremely unique beer, rare flavors I haven't seen before."
"O: Very nice brew, near the top for me as far as Cantillon goes in my limited experience. Very glad I got the chance to try this. Charley!"
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this; I was expecting something similar to Iris, which I did not like, but instead it was more like a slightly floral Classic Gueuze, which is great. I would drink this again for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: delightful beer. Would happily drink this one again, though maybe on someone else's dime."
"O: I had no idea what to expect from this beer, but it exceeded those expectations. As with the Cantillon beers I have had so far, this is delicious, but the Elder flower added a very interesting element. I am kicking myself for not purchasing another bottle."
""
"Unlike Fou Foune, this is ready to go out of the gate with some nice funk and mouthfeel happening. Perhaps I just prefer this style of ""fruit lambic"" in the first place. Very, very good, and can be compared to some far ""rarer"" gueuzes/lambics I've had in the past."
"Taste is earthy and floral with some light green pepper. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, not too sour but lightly tart and very rich. Overall quite tasty and refreshing."
"O - I really enjoyed this Cantillon, again Jean-Pierre has displayed masterful balance in this brew that somehow retains the classic Lambic sourness, but also offers up some interesting flavours. Recommended."
""
""
""
"This one pours with an audible crackle of the CO2 being released. Slightly soapy crystal white head. The color is dusty, rudy, brownish gold. The aroma is pleasant, s bit of classic funk, some old dusty barn, and a floral perfume. The nose leads me to believe I'm in for a great experiance. My first sip leaves me perplexed and a second confirms my fears. Mamouche starts with a delicate soft sourness and slight lemon-y funk. Then I get this strange vegitile flavor, it is slightly floral but reminds me more of tomatillos. While I like some of the aspects of this beer I can't get past the vegitile tomatillo thing. Otherwise this is a flawless lambic, great mouthfeel, its fluffy and not thin. In the end the pluses of this beer just don't outweigh how I felt about the flavor. But I can at least respect this as a well crafted product."
""
"O-Another fine example of what Lambics should taste like and this is a new one for me but it definately will not be the last as the Elderflowers add a beautiful touch to this to make it totally different to the rest of their range and another one of their brews that if you find it you buy it and looking forwards to sampling the rest of my Cantillion haul cheers."
"Pours a golden color with a thin off white head. Very cloudy looking. Nose is jalapeño, pickle, funk, and floral notes. Amazing nose. Taste profile follows suit. Unique, but very tasty beer. The pickle and jalapeño really come out in the taste. Feel is medium with excellent carbonation. Great beer overall! Really lucky I got to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"It IS the best time of the year! This just arrived today. It pours a light to medium bodied dirty and muddied apricot orange in color with a creamy off white head. The aromas consist of a very acidic sour with a boatload of grains and perfume. It is very, very floral with a lot of earthiness. I get a lot of dandelion and tea leaves. It also has a lemony citrus aspect to it. It's borderline potpouri that's been allowed to ferment. It's very interesting and very dry. It drinks relatively light in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a very different lambic, and better than Iris in my opinion. Cantiloons!"

"Overall this beer is better than a 3.5 but it isn't a 4. The cumulative score represents my thoughts on this one."
"Overall: I was really excited to get to try this, but it didn't really live up to my expectations. The smell turned me off. I don't think I would search this out again."
"O - Very nice. I would have to say this was my least favorite of the three but it was still very good none the less. Glad I finally got to try it."
"Pours a fairly clear orangish with a nice white head. Loots pretty typical. Smells hugely of chili spice. Peachy fruit, some floral aromas and toasted chilis. There is funkiness underlying but the chili overpowers. Was not expecting that. Tastes sweet and lightly fruity and before BAM! more chili hits hard. Well carbonated and drinkable but the chili kills it for me :("
"I really dug this beer, one of my favorite lambics in recent memory. Any Cantillon that sticks at 5% I always enjoy to the bone, while the ones that exceed that go in different directions for me. I gulped some glasses down pretty quick, a bottle to the head would be easy."
"Massive vegetal, herbal and floral presnce with minimal funk on the nose and tongue. A real unique but strange beer. Glad to try it, don't think I'lll ever seek it out again though."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, refreshing and zesty on the tongue. One of the most unusual yet delicious beers I've ever had. Even at $10 per glass, I went back for more - it's almost tough to explain this beer without actually tasting it."
"O-like the spiciness. I think my dad would like this."
"interesting although at the same time the elder flower really comes off strong."
"An herbalist friend advises that elderflowers are used as a mild skin astringent and to open pores and promote perspiring (diaphoretic) - such a reaction was not attributable by this taster, although it was a rather hot evening! A unique offering - looking forward to Zwaanze Day to try the newest one."
"8.0/10"
"The palate opens spicy, again with a blend of crushed white pepper and a jalapeno-like vegetal spiciness. Moderately pefumey, the mid-palate brings out the base lambic. Wonderfully lemony and lactic, this has a solid lip-smacking tartness. A little oaky with some vanilla and tannins, this beer dries out on the finish with a blend of lemon and pepper. Light in body with absolutely wonderful carbonation, this is airy, creamy and the combination of sourness and spiciness on the finish is unique. Excellent stuff, though I feel like the elderflower character is just a little overdone."
"M:"
"Light crisp feel but the carbonation seems a little bit exposive. Overall an interesting beer. I'm having a little trouble summing it up here because it seems so unique. Enjoyable and worth trying."
"O: This beer is excellent, complex, fun and intriguing. I wish there was some to buy from the brewery because it's amazing!"
"This beer is fantastic and so drinkable, less acidity that many of Cantillon's offerings - on par with something like Fou Foune. Light apple tartness, biscuity malt, elderflower that vacillates between a sort of musty weediness and a more floral, sweet hay. Light and buoyant mouthfeel, lush carbonation. Complex and so drinkable, one of my all time favorites - wish it wasn't so hard to get. Just superb."
"Wow, this is one that I've had on my wants list that I just assume I'll never end up with. Hell of a beer to review, and to do it blind is just way too exciting. Big thank you to"
"Overall a great beer and another winner from a brewery that can do no wrong it seems!"
"This beer poured to be a hazy orange color with a thick white head. Right away you can smell a strong interesting aroma of floral essence. Sour, smooth, great beer overall. I've become a big fan of cantillon beers!"
"cheers"
"Mamouche. From a bottle, pours a lightly hazy orange with a large white head that recedes fairly quickly and loudly. Beautiful look. Nose is herbal, mint-like, softly funky, a touch cheesy. Flavor is very heavy on the elder flowers, which comes across with a heavily herbal quality. When they tend toward minty I'm not sure if I like it. As it breaths it balances out a bit. It's actually a fun beer, kind of singular, not one of their more funky or sour offerings, but definitely well executed and pretty tasty."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a bold amount of carbonation. One of the most unique brew's I've had in awhile, it's funky, salivating and fizzy on the tongue. Certainly worth a try if you get the chance. Thanks again Kiel."
" I enjoyed the taste which has plenty of herbal qualities which I would compare to fennel and perhaps a slight tinge of very mild pepper and cooking herbs like sage w/ a pinch of anise, maybe. It is very hard to put my finger on what is contributed by the elderflower since I never had it before and I am sure some of the flavor comes from the yeast and other bacteria making it even more complex. I think you really have to have an open mind since it doesn't have much in the way of sweetness. It is very earthy and compares in a way to Gruit with the astringent herbal notes. Overall I say it is not the best I have had from Cantillon, but it is definitely unique and worth trying -especially if you enjoy more earthy/herbal flavored beer."
"d - Finally found a Cantillon beer I didn't like. Normally I can't get enough of Cantillon's but I did not want any more of this one. I wasn't sure what elderflowers would smell or taste like but apparently it's peppers. Most people at the tasting enjoyed this one a lot, but to me it was too spicey and dominated by peppers. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"Pours golden with a big, foamy white head. Some good lacing as it went down. The nose brought forward quite a bit of jalapeno skin and green peppers. Very odd. There is a bit of light floral character there as well, in addition to some mild herbs. The pepper character is really overwhelming, and takes the flavor even more. Really odd and not very enjoyable. Some vegetable character there as well. Coasts the mouth. Really very strange and I did not enjoy this one."
"O: Unique and enjoyable, but ultimately not one of Cantillon's top offerings."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability will be limited due to the floral nature of the brew. Overall, I thought this was the most one of a kind brew of the night. So floral and sour at the same time. Very unique, and for that I give it props. Skal."
"Nicely carbonated. Flavors are very floral, very earthy, slightly woody, citrus notes, and a extremely well balanced tartness. Very refreshing, something I could drink everyday and never get sick of."
"Notes: This is a fine lambic. I will say that the appearance and the nose outdo the palate. Recommended for a drink now lambic."
"D: A worthy new addition to the Cantillon range. I find this very drinkable. My memory is a bit hazy after the brewery tour, but from what I recall I bought this 75cl bottle at somewhere between 5 and 7 Euros from the brewery, which to me seems very reasonable. However, I have no idea what the imported price would be like."
"Medium bodied, nice carbonation as previously noted. Far from my favorite from Cantillon, but still a very interesting lambic."
"Super pungent nose, like you stuck your nose in a spice mill, just tons of pepper, overwhelming at first with some floral perfume emanating. Bretty taste, perfumey spice throughout, with a musty floral earthiness throughout but not too acidic. The dominant character is from these elderflowers. Really odd. Tons of assertive bretty flavor, good carb but not spritzery. Not my favorite cantillon but nice to try for sure. I'll revisit the madouche - i mean, mamouche version."
"D: Overall a decent if unremarkable beer. Glad I got a shot at it."
"D: Not one of my favorite offerings from Cantillon but they can't all be winners. Flavor is a bit weird and the spiciness just doesn't work with the sour flavor this beer has. Not bad by any means and I'd love to try it again in the future... I'm just not as eager to revisit it as I would some other lambics."
"(D)- Certainly a different look at the style. Fun and engaging for sure."
"Bottle. 2009 Zwanze. Opens with a very minimal pop. The cork was completely crappy and took a lot of work to get out. Slightly hazed yellow straw color with a nice head. The aroma is floral wih a then strong green chili notes and some bread like qualities. The taste is also fairly floral with the chilis making their presence known. Lingering bitterness. Some citrus zesty lemon notes as well. Light mouthfeel. Overall, an interesting beer that is drinkable but has a very unique flavor that I think is either love it or hate it."
"The body and carbonation levels are appropriate for the style (good). Overall, I felt this beer was extremely unique, but it was more of a noteworthy curiosity rather than an enjoyable drinking experience."
"Overall, I like it better than the mamouche. It has more elderflowers and it works better with the spices. Somewhat drinkable."
"Wow! Cantillon never dissapoints! Loads of citrus, lemon peel, oak, and sharp crisp tartness! The floral aspect isn't over the top; rather the mild funk and strong tartness are in the fore-front. Finishes slightly dry...mild carbonation. Light to medium body. And of course, like all Cantillon lambics, booze isn't noticeable. This is why I love Cantillon beers! I haven't had one yet that I didn't love...but this one specifically is just simply wonderful!"
"Good stuff. Unique for sure, and very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good. The elderflowers really add a lot of character to the beer and make it a unique addition to the Cantillon line up. Not my favorite Cantillon, but still quite good and definitely worth seeking out."
"1/25/2011: 4 or 5 bottles later and I find myself loving this beer. Very unique and enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Very drinkable stuff, more funky than sour and acidic. Really nice!"
"Shared a bottle with Sammy at Beer Bistro in Toronto. Pours a pale yellow with huge white fluffy head. Smell is quite sour, with some herbs and berries. The sour flavour is pretty big for me, though I haven't tried too many sour beers yet. I had to have a glass of water part way in to cleanse my palate a bit, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Huge carbonation level."
"Bomber at Beerbistro shared with Ken. Cloudy yellow with orange tinge, and alcey. Funky aroma, but pleasant not barnyard, with some herbs. Lambic, some sourness that is hidden behind herbal and definate elderberries. The palate feels a delayed harshness. A break of water helped to get through it, and I imagine food would certainly."
"Drinkability: Flowers are beautiful :)"
"I think this is a beer that you're either going want a lot more of, or not have again. I don't care a ton if I encounter this again."
"As I mentioned, this is one of the more accessible Cantillons I've come across (unless I'm becoming immune). Its hugely drinkable, and a pleasure to consume. Super-win."
"750 ml bottle into my Narke tulip...Pour is nothing to discuss as this beer is all about the elder flowers. Going in I had no idea what one smelled like, now I know, and I won't be searching them out again. A super strong acidic chilipepperish aroma attacks your nose from the start almost stinging it like a whiff of a strong medication. I can almost visualize waves of the aroma coming off it like its some cartoon characterization..The taste is much of the same, but thankfully its toned down a bit and not nearly as harsh. The astringency is much weaker, especially as your drink it, I guess you almost get used it to. Its certainly a unique flavor, something probably worth trying but one that is just not for me, despite a relatively high score that I give it for its uniqueness and effort."
"D - I personally liked this one and enjoyed the floral notes. I would def drink again and would love to see how this one ages as well."
"D - This was pretty easy to drink. I could have had a significant amount of this one. I get the feeling that the elder flower flavor is pretty polarizing - if you don't like it you probably won't enjoy this very much. Thankfully I'm in the like it camp."
"Drinkability: Interesting and not something I would pursue again. A few ounces would have been plenty. It does taste better after it breaths some."
"D: One could probably drink a lot of this, but I'm not sure I would really want to. I could smell it all day though!"
"D: Profoundly interesting. What an experience. This is a great beer to share with a few folks. I am thrilled at the opportunity to try this rare delicacy."
"Beer is medium to light in body, slightly more body than other Cantillons I've had recently. Pretty bitter as well, very herbal in the bitterness still I'm getting some flowery / hoppy characters in the back. The beer is almost spicy in a sense, still pepper character in there. Beer is overall balanced and unique. The oddest lambic I've had from Cantillon. Still pretty good."
"Overall, a very unique beer, but as states above, the elderflowers really need to be toned down."
"Sour perfume is the result. An interesting, if two dimensional beer."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty yellowish color lambic with a large foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing as well. Aroma is absolutely dominated by elder flowers and is somewhat of an acquired taste. Taste is also dominated by elder flowers and provides a floral and somewhat peppery taste to this beer which is well integrated with the tart and oak from the base lambic. Very refreshing overall though a bit too much flowers for my taste."
"Taste is quite sour/tart, caught me off-guard after drinking an '84 gueuze that was more sweet than sour, wonderful sourness in this beer and definitely picking up some of the spice that the flowers contribute, definitely finished dry but left you wanting more."
"D: This was indeed one of the more interesting beers I've ever had. And in this case, interesting wasn't a polite way of saying ""not very good"". I enjoyed this experience and hope to have other years of the Zwanze beers."
"The beer is salty and earthy, with notes of citrus, oak, dill, and musty cheese. The Elderflower tastes herbal and rather strange, but interesting. The finish is dry and moderately sour with a lingering floral presence. This is a unique and enjoyable beer, though not particularly drinkable. The few ounces were enough for me."
"D: Not the most drinkable. Unique and one of a kind for sure."
"Drinkability ... finished the 750ml by myself quite easily and then wondered why I didn't buy another bottle or two!! but I'd opted for a fresh St. Lamvinus to travel back with and the luggage was getting heavy. So glad I got to taste Zwanze 2009 though. Cantillon's 2009 released beers are amazing even for their high standards ... this is the third I've tried after Blabaer and Fou Foune that have been just ""wow""!!!"
"Lots of carbonation, and very sessionable."
"D: Well, considering that is not my favorite style... GREAT drink!!! Exceptional for sure, would love to have this one again if possible."
"Overall: I only like this style of beers if they are of extremely high quality. About the Zwanze I can only say I didn't like it... I LOVED IT! A unique beer, with a unique taste. A great experiment from the Cantillon brewers. This must be the most well balanced Lambic beer I ever had (together with the Dirty Horse from de Struise brewers). I think this beer might become even better over time (I think it is still a bit young), so in case you manage to get your hands on a bottle now, be patient, it will be rewarded for sure! (by the way, the brewer advised me to open my bottle at least 30 minutes before drinking....)"
