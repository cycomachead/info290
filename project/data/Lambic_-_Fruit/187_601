3.91,2.1,4.25,3.75,4,3.5,4,"Overall / Drinkability:  I really like black currants.  I grew up on them as a kid and have always enjoyed their flavor so this beer was indeed like drinking a carbonated black currant drink, but with more tartness than what you would find if you were to get a carbonated black currant beverage / sparkling juice.  Something of a dessert beer I think to have that fruit flavor counter a sweet desert that you're eating, although it could be an after-dinner drink as well.  So I greatly enjoyed the beer but I didn't see a need for more than one per evening.","damndirtyape","Feb 08, 2015"
4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/16/2013. Pours fairly clear dark red color with a 2 finger dense dark pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light strreaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart blackberry, black currant, red grape, candi sugar, hay, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of big authentic berry fruitiness, candi sugar, and light earthy yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart blackberry, black currant, red grape, candi sugar, hay, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blackberry, black currant, red grape, candi sugar, hay, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and robustness of big authentic berry fruitiness, candi sugar, and light earthy yeast notes; with a good sweetness/tartness balance and minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly slick, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is an excellent sweetened fruit Lambic style. All around great robustness and balance of authentic berry fruitiness, candi sugar, and light earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 07, 2015"

3.72,-2.9,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style, but the sweetness was pretty high and that made it much more of a dessert beer, but in the end I still enjoyed it.  This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little cloying, a little mouth puckering, not too acidic, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but the sweetness would prevent me from drinking the whole bottle so about half the bottle is a perfect amount for me.  What I like the most about this beer was the sourness, it was mice and sour, I liked it.  What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, it was just a little too high for me and I wish it was toned down a little.  I would buy this again when I'm in the mood for a beer like this and I would recommend it to someone who likes sweet and fruity dessert beers.  All in all I liked this beer, but i didn't love and I think if the sweetness was toned down a little it would be a pretty good beer.  It's not my favorite Lindemans beer or my favorite of the style, but it's not bad by any means.  Nice job guys, this was a solid fruit lambic, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Jan 23, 2015"

Cloudy, darker fuschia color, topped with a full two fingers of pinkish-lavender head, which receded mostly but never completely disappeared, leaving random specks of lacing on the glass. In the nose, berries and more berries, somewhat vinous, with a little musty funk. Not bad. A little bit of puckering tartness up front in the taste, giving way to a wave of sweetness, currants and grapes, candy, jam, Jolly Ranchers, Juicy Juice...overload, simply too sweet. A subtle grassy finish. Let's just call this a fruit beer, not a lambic. Medium body, mouthfeel was syrupy with sweetness, but still had a tart twinge that kept the drinkability decent. Overall, I'd say maybe it's a good dessert beer, but not something I'd purposely buy again. I really just wanted something from Lindemans I hadn't tried yet to christen my glasswale.","Rifugium","Apr 10, 2014"

Promoted as a peach flavor which I was able to find traces of in the flavor. The appearance was an amazing purple with a grape-hued head like nothing i've ever seen... almost like grape juice but a beer. The taste was a little sour which I found as distracting from what could have otherwise been a great peach brew, but I imagine that is the nature of cassis. Overall, if you are looking for a great fruity drink, I can totally recommend this in place of a red dessert wine.","shigg85","Feb 26, 2012"

3.58,-6.5,4,3.5,4,3,3,"Poured a dark red with an average sized pink head that was mostly lasting and had fair lacing. The aroma was strong with black currants, a moderate dark bread malt and a light sweet yeast. It tasted sweet and acidic from beginning to end with the finish being strong with black currants that lingered on the pallet for an average amount of time. Mouthfeel was medium in body and dry in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall quite tasty and would be great mixed with a nice chocolate stout.","KajII","Mar 09, 2011"

The beer pours a lovely dark ruby color with good-sized pink head--plummish I would say. The aroma suggests an earthy cellar with fruity overtones. It is appetizing and suggests good things to come. The mouthfeel is bubbly light. The sourness of the lambic melds nicely with the tartness of the black currants. A fruity sweetness balances it. The sweetness is not overwhelming and mixes in well.

This one has a fair amount of tart/sourness to offset that though. A bit juice/wine like and would be a nice dessert beer to pair with things you would normally pair fruit with.

3.58,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours into a deep, somewhat hazy maroon, crowned by a frothy head whose color elicits images of red wine settling into the stained khakis. Though this head dies away at a moderately quick pace, it leaves a fine coating of lace along the edges of the glass. There is a smell of berries (to be expected), with what I will call a root-y background (a combination of woodiness and soil-ines), as though the aromas were coming from around a dewy berry bush. The taste generally follows suit, though the rootiness is diminished in favor of a tart, pomegranate-like profile. Like pomegrantes, these berries have a thick, heavy effect in the mouth, though this is somewhat balanced by the nice carbonation.","TMoney2591","Feb 03, 2010"
4.33,13.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Pours a dark and hazy red color beneath a creamy and bright pink head. The visibly high carbonation sends out a rich and bold berry fruit aroma.

Unlike other fruit lambics it is really hard to pick out the fruit notes in this beer. The taste is very sour with lots of musty basement character as well as some red wine like character. Most fruit is in the aftertaste, but it works well with the sourness. Mouthfeel is somewhat full and definitely on the sticky side. Not a beer I would want to sit down and drink for a session, but I bet it would go great with a creamy desert.","zoso1967","Feb 01, 2010"

On the tongue, the carbonation reminds you this is not wine, and the flavors are a little more muted than the nose would lead you to believe. There is an earthy component that is very refreshing adnd serves to cut the sweetness a bit.

Starts off with a red wine flavor but quickly transform into a fresh fruity tart bomb. The feel is moderate to full with tingly carbonation, good swing between sweet, sour and tart.

It was very sugary sweet up front, with berries and currants cutting the sweetness at the midpoint. Leafy mint and moderate tartness lingered. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation. It was a little palate coating and had a decent texture. Quite easy drinking and a good fruit beer. The sweetness was a little high for my tastes, but worked well with the tartness.

High carbonation has a crisp chamagne-ish mouthfeel to it. I'm pretty much giving this 3's across the board because it is my first Lambic and I'm not used to this.

Contributing musky, moldy, oak-ey aromas fade as the flavors prevail with sweet fruitiness. A mellow spiciness are astringency just adds to the complexity.

The best lambic I have ever had is the New Glarus Cherry Tart, but this Cassis is a close second. For those who like sweet, sugary lambics, this is not for you. Lindeman's does a great job of capturing the nature of black currant, sort of watery in texture but sweet and tart create a flavor burst that mellows with fruity dry flavor, almost like a red wine. What I was most impressed with was the smell. the first thing I did when I opened it was smell the cork, it was almost like a musty, but fruity cellar. Very refreshing, reminds me of the northwoods in the spring or fall. This is not something you would have a session with (is any lambic), I think it would be best with some dank food, or to actually cook with.","dfried","May 17, 2006"

It pours a dark cherry red with notes of purple and pink, and it's topped with a beautiful strawberry frosting color head that rises to an inch and a half and sticks everywhere, and not just on the first glass. Damn that's a pretty beer. It smells sweet with berries (currant, blackberry), and a slight musty/farmy aroma. The last pour (with all the dregs) smells of currant preserves. The taste follows suit with a good tart/bitter quality and additional notes of dark cherries and oak. Delicious. The body is both medium and syrupy, both smooth and dry. The carbonation at the beginning is nice, but the beer is better as it warms. As far as drinkability - I was taking sips for the whole 2 hours it took to drink, and I'm surprised it even lasted that long - good thing I was trying to savor it.

Medium bodied with a nice medium carbonation--not as fizzy as some other fruit lambics I've tried. As far as drinkability goes, I could drink this all day, every day, in place of soda.

By far the most complex smelling Lindeman's product I've had. Taste: Tart grapes (currants), sweet but herbal notes this is an awesome tasting lambic. Sourness is perfect not as lip puckering as a Cantillon but not as candy as the Kriek, Framboise, or Peche. Mouthfeel: Spritzy and light to medium bodied very bubbly, solid.

4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I'd love this if I liked black currants. Even so, this is very good, and a nice change from the cherry flavors I'm used to. It's a great aperitif for our Chinese New Year celebration.","RockyTopHeel","Jan 23, 2004"

4.51,17.8,5,4,5,4.5,4,"I didn't know what black currants tasted like but I tried this one anyway. Because I never had it and wanted to try it. So.... it was so pretty in the glass, for starters.. a deep purple-red colour, with a nice pink head. I actually wasn't turned on by the smell at all, I honestly thought it smelled musty, like I was inhaling the dusty outside of the bottle... but then maybe that makes it more like the traditional lambics than other Lindemans lambics... Anyway, I got over the smell and finally took a sip and after a second i loved it! In the 1st second it was almost too much, tasted like berries you might find in the woods that you're not supposed to eat. But then I got over that and it was just great. It tasted very fresh, like something in the woods. I dont know how else to describe it really.. Fresh, fruity, tart, berry-ish, tasty. I think I made a sour face, but no worse than eating a sourpatch kid, like it was a sweet-tart kind of feel. Mouthfeel was very nice, not too thick and not thin at all. Drinkability, well, even though I loved the taste, it would get to be to much if I drank it all night. Splitting a bottle is enough for one evening, but I'd drink it again any day!","erica","Jan 06, 2004"

4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This brew was a lovely dark purple colour with a small head of foam. The aromas were of black currants, sugar, and more. The taste is sweet and sour, quite lovely, and reminscent of a black currant cough drop. The mouthfeel is a bit astringent, but nice and the drinkability is good as well.","francisweizen","Jan 04, 2004"

3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Deep red in color that you can see through, with a large pink head that doesn't seem to disipate. Very carbonated. There is a very fruity and aromatic smell that is a little too strong for me. The taste starts sweet and ends tart. Not very bitter at the end but yet very sweet to start with. Its a little too fruity for me but thats what I ecxpected. If you want somethingfruity this is worth the price.","Elemental","Nov 16, 2003"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep cranberry in color with an attractive creamy pink head. Not nearly the super dark extracted color of the Framboise. Aromas hint mildly of garden mint and sweet brambly cassis fruit. Some tartness in the mouth, yet still aimed at the international market-though not much as the framboise. However, if this steers a person in the direction, and or, perpares the palate for the likes of Cantillon, this brew has carved its niche. Should be widely appreciated.","moulefrite","Oct 30, 2003"
3.97,3.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The aroma of friut lambics always suprises me. Other fruit beers often seem artificial and overdone...not a good friut lambic. Of course, I always seem to think that they're more fun to smell than to drink. No difference here. Deep purple, almost black color with a dark lavender head. Charachteristic tartness and candylike sweetness. Very fizzy and very thin. This one was an adventure to drink.","Suds","Sep 01, 2003"
2.9,-24.3,3,3,3,2,3,"Dark purple color. Medium head. Aroma is fruity and berryish. Kind of sweet and grapelike at the start yields to some tartness at the finish. Very carbonated, if not for the malts and the tartness at the finish I would think I was drinking a soda pop. Probably the least beer like of the 3 fruit Lindeman's Lambics. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is tart and slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Aug 29, 2003"
4.15,8.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I'm not sure what currants taste like, but I'm getting something that smells and tastes like grapefruits. Or an alcohol sweet tart. I was a bit put off at first, but the more I drink the more I enjoy it.","roguetester","Aug 15, 2003"
4.72,23.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Where do I start. This is my first Lambic, it pours a deep purple and has an enormous head that really lasts. The aroma of currants dominates everything about this. It gives you that pucker you expect, without overdoing it, and finishes nicely. The more you drink, the more the complex flavors start presenting themselves. This is a great after dinner, Sunday afternoon, kick back and relax drink. Looking forward to trying Lindemans other Lambics","Indybeer","May 20, 2003"
4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a grapey purple color with a tall creamy light purple colored head that fades into a creamy and sticky lace. Nose is medicinal with notes of mint and cough syrup. Moderate in body and quite tangy. Taste starts off with a candy-like sweetness, a juicy fruitiness, and fresh jam followed by a strong tartness with notes of black currants. The sweetness and tartness balance each other very nicely. If you like Sweet Tarts you should enjoy this brew. A fine beer for Sunday brunch.","Morris729","May 11, 2003"
4.18,9.1,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This beautifully plum colored Lambic has a nice dry fruity aroma with staying power. Medium in body and low in the hop department. Reminiscent of a dry fruity wine. Dry oak with residual sweetness and ripe berries up front and a tart jam finish. Fairly complex, despite the lack of an alcoholic presence. Behold the rose head!","BeerResearcher","Mar 18, 2003"
4.45,16.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Pours a deep purple with a nice pinkish head. The black currant flavors are ever forward and tasty. Slightly sweet and nicely tart. This is a fine brew. I love black currant, and this brew just adds to that love affair. This is my first lambic and I'm stoked on it. I hope the other lambics I'm bound to try will be good too.","scottum","Mar 16, 2003"
4.12,7.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a murky dark purpleish color....the head in enormously pinkish...lighter pinkish. The aroma is wonderful. It's black currants mixed with mustiness. The mustiness is kind of faint behind all of the sweet n sour tug of war going on, but it's nice to notice. This tastes more like a lambic than just fruit juice with carbonation, like some of the others are like, enjoyable nonetheless. This one has that certain musty character in the aroma and flavor....quite enjoyable. The highly sour, super tart black currant flavor obviously is dominative. A wonderful lambic from Lindemans. I enjoy the Kriek more still....the sweet tooth in me I guess.","AudioGilz","Mar 11, 2003"
1.76,-54,4,3,1,2,1,"The high point of this beer was when it was still in the bottle. After pouring this ruby purple color beer with a light purple head everything after that was down hill. The smell was overpowering and I had a feeling I was smelled Eucalyptus Oil. The taste was, well after the first sip of this beer, which tasted very tart and had a sour taste that puckered my tongue to my stomach. This beer from Lindemans is there absolute worst brew! One sip and the rest went down the drain! No kiding, it tasted like sour, puckering, tart Eucaluptus leaves! There might have been berries, but I could'nt find them.","BeerManDan","Feb 04, 2003"

4.27,11.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"The color is a rare to me Deep Purple color with the head portly and the remaining lace, nice clinging sheets. Nose has hints of yeast, black currants, and malt, also a light sweet and sour tone present, quite different. Front is sweet with the grape taste quite evident and a skimpy top. The finish is highly acidic with little or no hops to speak of, the aftertaste quite dry and a real change of pace, once again a good after dinner drink.","Gusler","Dec 26, 2002"
4.5,17.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy (bottle conditioned) ruby body - almost purple tinged - with a thin and creamy light pink head that holds very well and leaves some lace throughout the glass. The nose is quite bold, with a tart and sugary-sweet berry aroma that's laced with some earthy and musty lambic character! This is surprising since most of the Lindeman's products seem to be almost completely devoid of lambic character. The body is light/medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation. The flavor is huge! I don't know how to describe it other than just intense black currant! It's tart, sour, sweet, ripe, juicy, fruity! The tartness predominates in the finish and it dries out fairly quickly. At first I found this to be my least favorite of the Lindeman's line, but I've come to appreciate it for its uniqueness. It makes a better apertif than after-dinner drink, although it can be enjoyed just as any sweet wine might be.","NeroFiddled","Dec 06, 2002"
3.55,-7.3,4,4,3,3.5,4,"A little more purple than the framboise. It was also more dry than the other Lindemans fruit lambics. A little medicinal in the beginning.

4.37,14.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This was a pinkish amber or it was karrant.  Anyway this was great the color was good and the head was a pinkish color also that left a little bit of a lace behind.  The smell of the fruit was very strong.  It tasted like cotton candy from the fair.  The sourness make its a little hard to drink these badboys down for a while and of coarse the price did not help either 13 dollars a bottle.","kunzbrew","Sep 21, 2002"

The flavor was of currents and slightly of malt.  The finish was tangy with current elements.  This one tends to be a touch sour as opposed to the framboise.  I like currents and was hoping that it would hold up as well as the framboise, but the sour aspect hurt it some.","Wildman","Aug 02, 2002"
4.02,5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Dark purple color, big black currant aroma alongside an oaky earthy smells. Sweet, tart, fruity currant flavor. Effervescent mouthfeel. A nice treat (one is plenty though) when poured into a champagne flute and slowly sipped.","John","Jul 17, 2002"
2.62,-31.6,3.5,4,2,2.5,2,"Yikes. Well this stuff smells great, like fruit punch. The appearance is a deep reddish purple, looks like carbonated wine. The smell is quite powerful, and the "beer" has a thick red head on the top. I guess thats the proof that it truly is beer. The taste was not too great, and was far too sweet for me. Some may enjoy this, but as one who rarely drinks wines or champagnes, I will stick to beer that tastes like beer.","IrishRedRock","Jun 23, 2002"
2.22,-42,4,2,2,3,2,"The rocky, light pink head tops an attractive, slightly hazy deep ruby hued brew.  Belgian lace is left down the glass.  Sugary, black currant aroma w/ a hint of tartness.  The lack of complex "wet horse" Brettanomyces in atoma as typical for style is lacking in this brew, leaving the aroma akin to that of a wine cooler.  The taste is dominated by a borderline overbearing sugary, one - dimensional sweetness, while the tartness is perceptible in the finish.  The black currant flavor is quite assertive and when coupled with the sweetness leaves me with the impression that I've just tasted a carbonated wine cooler.  This is not a good example of Lambic.  It lacks the tartness and complexity of a true lambic and is cloyingly sweet.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Not recommended at all.","marc77","Jun 11, 2002"

Your tongue is left dry and wanting to drink more of "the desert" at once!  I first tried this a week ago at a tasting in Phila. and had to go out a buy a bottle this week to taste again (it is still great) .  Not quite as sweet as their other lambics.
