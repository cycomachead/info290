"Quite tasty. Champagne-like carbonation. Intense fruit flavor. 2012."
""
""
""
"One of many world class beers from what may be the best (and certainly my favorite) brewery in the world. To get any attention on this highly U.S. centered site, you know it must be great."

"Bought this for my 5yr anniversary... Honestly I thought this was champagne. Worst night ever, I ended up cheating on my wife with a midget."
""
"Bottle courtesy of Diego shared at the Ryan’s tasting. Achie machie!!!!! Big barnyard and horse blanket nose. This is one sour/bitter beer. Super dry and crisp, it was so sour I could barley pick out any flavors, I guess apricot? Update: ’05 vintage was suffering from autolysis and had a huge burnt rubber nose.."

"Overall, this is the first Cantillon that I have had live up to its insane hype. Their other beers are good, but this is delicious on a whole other level. The fruit and sourness mingle perfectly and give a balanced flavor to satisfy cravings both flavor components. My favorite part of this beer is how well the fruit stands up to the base beer and displays its flavors. Great beer!"

"One of the best beers I have ever had, if not the best. Lots of funk and amazing flavor."
"First lambic I ever had, very enjoyable. Had out of the bottle at the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"So happy I finally had a full pour of this, after having samples at numerous tastings over the years…& I gotta say, much better fresh. Goes without saying: this is an excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
"Amazing beer, got alot more fruit as it warmed up, great mix of sour and funk."
""
"I wish it were winter so we could freeze it into ice blocks and skate on it and melt it in the spring time and drink it!"

"Wife said it smelled like a mix of a gym locker and dirty socks. I told her that's an exquisite description and exactly what I was hoping for. Everything about this beer is stellar and lives up to the hype. Nearly flawless, gym sock funk and all."

"Overall- What is there to say about this beer that hasn't already been said Catholic Priests? Fruity, refreshing and keep away from children."
""
""

""
""
"2014. An amazing beer in every sense. A perfect combination of funk, sour, and fruit."
"Had side by side with dG Imp Apricot Bu and CCB Apricot Grove.  I realize neither are lambic, but Fou was such a clear winner.  Always a treat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a seriously killer beer. has all the funk you could want while remaining not only drinkable but refreshing as well. amazing fruit and sour qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The apricot adds a richness and body that makes this lambic one of my favorites from Cantillon.  Very well balanced and drinkable compared to some of offerings.  Meaning I could drink many of these, which I cannot say for some of the more raw and sour versions"

"Fou' Foune (2014) - Brasserie Cantillon - Brussels, Belgium - Lambic - 5.00% ABV - This decadent lambic style sour poured a murky, golden-straw color, with a white head that dissipates immediately. The nose featured aromas of puréed apricots, funky Belgian yeast, and tart acidic notes that are quite pleasant to the nostrils. The mouth was outstanding; flavors of ripe apricots are prevalent up front, followed by hints of lemon peel, musty earth, white wine, and funky yeast that create a memorable taste. The mouthfeel was light bodied, with enamel eroding acidity and a bright, apricot finish. This was my first time having Fou', and wow, it was quite delightful. Thanks again for the bottle, @ehrenblanche! 98/100"

"Balanced, sour and smooth. Not getting a ton apricot, finding myself not caring either.  as it starts to warm, more fruit flavor is coming out."
""
""
""
"Really nice and fancy and I can't wait to just have one of these but not to drink, to look at."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very good beer that develops in ur mouth and takes you for a great cantillon ride!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- The best nose I've experienced from a lambic, so much apricot that actually gets better as it warms"

"O- very dangerous beer, too darn good."

"O- A bucket list beer that was wonderful. Hope I can try again someday."
""

"O:  I'm lucky to have walked up on this tasting.  Luckier, still, to get to try a few sips of this terrific lambic.  One of my beer bucket list moments."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow!!!! Wow!!! Wow! Wow! This was life changing!"
""
""
""
""
"This is the best sour I've ever had. It's a fantastic achievement."
""
""
"This requires no review and speaks for itself. Amazing."
""
""
""
"-- Knife edge balance - fizz, fruit, funk, all perfectly aligned. Not too much pucker, just some apricot stone sulfur, tart more than wild. Top class. 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
"I rated this 4.5 on Untappd and might give it the full 5-star review next time, if I'm fortunate enough to try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I did a side by side with batch 1 and the 2014 batch. Both very good but I think the batch 1 was the winner."

"This beer pours a hazy golden amber with a ton of head that dissipates quickly into an outer lace. The smell is full of apricots, perfectly identifiable, and sweet. There is also a faint musky funk that compliments the apricots. The taste is very similar to the nose. A ton of sweet apricots followed by a nice funk. The feel is light but full bodied. Heavy carbonated but sweet and juicy. I feel like i am taking a big bite of an apricot when i drink this beer. Very solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The complex classic Cantillon Lambic flavors combined with fresh apricot is a perfect match. If you're fortunate to see this beer buy it, if not trade for it. Even better travel to Belgium and have it at the Brasserie (like I did) - Nothing beats it. (5)"

"What i really have to wrote here os that i am a sour hater. Is was at the Borefts beerfestival two weeks ago where Cantillon was with some brews. Had some sips of a glass from a friend. Not my thing...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2013 vintage. Very sour, acidulated and apricot taste is moderated. Bitterness is short."
""
"This is a typical Cantillon brew. It comes a little yellow and a little murky due to the apricots. It is nicely carbonated. The aroma and taste have all the Cantillon goodness, though as usual this holds not true for every palate. The aroma is sublime like smelling a crate of ripe apricots. Later also the typical Cantillon lambic aromas kick in. Taste is a little more tart and less fruity than the aroma but still very much apricot. This is a great Cantillon with sublime fruitiness, if you can get this fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is no surprise to me why this is the consensus favorite from Temple of Sours.  The flavors are very subtle, but perfectly balanced.  Perfection is unattainable - IMO - but this ale gets very close.  The fruit/sour/funk aspects meld so nicely, it is hard not to give this a perfect score. This is my favorite Cantillon."
"Well, this is excellent. Cantillon does not make beer. They make magic. Consistently. Find and drink."
"Matches the hype. A ton of oak with enough fruit and tart edges to balance it all out. Complex and tasty to the point of absurdity."

"Overall, a stellar sour. I usually prefer sours with a noticeable amount of balancing sweetness. I can't remember the last time I had a beer this sour that I enjoyed so much. I can see why BAs seek it out, but at this price I probably won't ever buy it again (or if I do, I'll trade it to someone who's never been able to find it). Not recommended for those new to sours. If you're new to sours and you happen to stumble upon a bottle of this, do yourself a favor. Stash it somewhere and explore several other sours before drinking it, otherwise you may not enjoy it and could possibly waste your money (and the beer)."

"O: Highly drinkable, nice subtle flavors, and good complexity. Though it’s tasty, I don’t quite understand the fascination with this beer. I’d prefer St. Lamvinus or LP Kriek by far."

"Overall - I'm very glad to have had the opportunity to try this on tap. This is a world class beer, but I am surprised at how closely this compares to other American sours I have had. I do think this beer is slightly over-hyped after trying it, there are many American Wilds that rival this that aren't in the top 50 IMHO."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: Dry, complex and awesome quality. Drank this one on site at Cantillon. Was an awesome experience!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad to have had the opportunity to try this, but not worth vigilantly seeking out, in my opinion. I'm with the bros on this one: a very good beer, but not mindblowing by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"IMO, this is a bit of an over-hyped brew, but it's still very nice and enjoyable. It's a damn fine, highly drinkable, earthy sour, just a bit over hyped... Very solid, I just don't believe it's tops in class, but definitely a top 10-15 brew for it's class. Recommended, yes, even @ $30/750/ml"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely one of the best sours I have ever experienced. The buzz of something this rare showing up in a town this far from a major metropolitan area was justified. Very happy to have experienced this even once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good lambic and it feels almost sour like but Top 12 in the World, absolutely not!"
"I hyped this beer up pretty highly, perhaps too much so. While it's a very clean, perfectly sour beer, I expected a little more fruit presence. The fruit comes out a bit more as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, once again I'm knocked back to reality. Reality being that Belgian lambics are still king of the sour beer world. You get caught up with the American sour beer scene that you almost forget the superiority of Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen when it comes to ""sours", ""wilds", or whatever you want to call it. On top of those two you also have Rodenbach, De Cam, and Boon also putting out some top notch stuff. Give me an Apricot Mariage Parfait and I just may come in my pants. But babble aside, Fou Foune continues to be that gracious creation it's always been, and a beer by which all other sours should be measured against."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have been waiting forever to try this whale, as it was my #1 want for over a year. Fou Foune is everything I expected and more. The fruity apricot balanced with the perfect acidity make for a near perfect lambic. Seek it out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Funky, moderately tart saison flavours, with minimal fruit presence and a lot of blue cheese. Not quite what I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not my favorite from Cantillon, but it could grow on me over time - that is, if I can ever get my hands on a bottle of it. Too bad the hype has sucked out the facility of obtaining what is a marvelous and delicious sour such as this one, but it's definitely delicious and incredibly refreshing no matter how you cut it. I'd love to try a fresh bottle of this some day. Highly recommended, but don't pay more than $25 for it if you can help it."

"Pours a slightly hazy, almost milky, orange hue. It's really resembles peaches. There is an of white head that sits around a half finger size for the entire drink. Tart, acidic, funky, unripe fruits on the nose. You can tell it's going to be delicious. It tastes similar to the nose with a slightly sharper carbonation than I'm used to with other Cantillon beers. You could close your eyes and take a sip and feel like someone liquified the skin of a peach. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect. I would like it just a tad more creamy, and a tad less sharp. This is one of those beers that deserve the hype. It's worth it."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-I can see why this beer is so highly sought after. Easily one of the top three Lambics I have tried. What a goddamn treat to try this beer. An beer that can absolutely change the way anyone views beers, regardless of their previous experiences."

"Re-re-reviewed: 2014 vintage. Bottled 21 August 2014. Thanks Tim! Poured into a Cantillon balloon glass 10/19/2014 for our first anniversary- 2 months of age. Essentially, I just want to re-reconfirm that fresh Fou' Foune is delicious, and this year's Fou' Foune is not lacking in apricots. The best advice I have to anyone who's opening up a bottle soon is to serve it at cellar temperature, aerate it and let it warm up a bit- the apricots truly come out as clean, crisp stone fruits in the nose that dance along your palate as you sip it. Great mouthfeel, soft, velvety but with a nice crisp, dry and thirst-quenching finish. There is no defect to be found in this beer- it is still my favorite beer after all this time, and worthy of its status."

"Overall, a beer that more than lives up to the hype. Of course, I'm predisposed to like it, given my penchant for beers that are sour and the use of apricots in beer, but that also means that I could have been easily disappointed, given the reputation of this brew and my high expectations."

"MF – A medium light body with a dry finish. 4.25"
""
""
"Lovely radiant yellow, like liquid sunshine. The nose is sweet, astringent and a touch funky. The apricots give it a huge citrus sweetness that is nicely balanced with a pithy bitterness. It rounds off to a nice pucker, which makes it totally refreshing. This lives up to the hype."
"TOTAL - 48/50"
""
""
""
"I am not a fan of apricots but I am a fan of sour beers and this is one that does not dissapoint. The tart feeling that you get when you sip it and then the tasty fruity flavor that envelops your mouth keeps you coming back for more. My only downfall with this is that I cannot get this all the time. It is a special treat for those beer lovers that know and appreciate a good beer when they taste one. If you ever see this beer on a list somewhere it is definetly worth a try!"

"Overall: Incredible. This beer has so much to offer but so easy to drink. It's an intense sensory experience but has many subtleties to explore. One of the best beers I've had. Extremely expensive to order at a restaurant in NYC but worth every penny."
""
""
""
"Appearance is basically the same. Aroma is much fruitier and a bit more funky/musty and just overall more intense than the 2013. Ditto for the aroma, with the slight herbal quality from the 2013, not being present in this one. Mouthfeel and drinkability are just as incredible as last year. Overall enjoyed the 2014 quite a bit more, though to be fair this I had this about 5 months fresher than the 2013."
""
""
""
""
"My first Cantillon! Finally. Large format bottle from Tipples, capped and corked, with an Aug 30, 2013 bottling date. Cracked Feb 9, 2014. Pours into my tulip hazy apricot yellow with a very large fluffy and fizzy white head that dissipates relatively quickly. Aroma of apricots, lacto, yeast funk, dusty dryness. This smells both mouthpuckeringly dry and sour. Flavor is apricots up front and tart lemons, with another punch of sour in the middle. Finishes dry but soft with oak and apricots lingering with an extra lacto sour punch. Light bodied with medium to high carbonation. A yummy sour beer with lots to like. The fruit really comes out as this warms a bit so make sure not to drink it too cold. Keeps improving as I go here. very nice. Looking forward to trying my Kriek now."

"2013. Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a bright orange/yellow with a nice fluffy two finger head. Looks great. Smell is even better. So juicy, tart, loaded with apricots. Smells so fresh and vibrant. The taste its very apricot forward, with some funk on the backend. There's a decent amount of sourness here, but it doesnt take away from the fruit too much. Delicious. The mouthfeel is so creamy, coats the whole mouth with a fair amount of carbonation. The apricot and funk lingers for days. As it warms you get a few more flavors. Some green apple in there. Really glad I got to try this."

"O - come on. There is just no way this could ever have lived up to the expectations I had for it. That being said, this is one hell of a beer and probably the best I've had from Cantillon. The smell drives this beer and the flavor is outstanding."

""
""
"Hazed orange, ring of white head with some lace. The nose here is just insane, juicy apricots, fruity, funky and acidic, musty barnyard notes, fruity-lemon as well, but the apricot on this is just out of this world, top 3 if not the best smelling beers of all time for me. Taste is good but a step down from the nose, that being said it still is fantastic, big puckering sour upfront, apricot and fruit, lemony, tart all the way through, acidity is fairly restrained, but the fruity funk here is just crazy, apricot aftertaste. Dry puckering mouthfeel, medium carbonation and body. This blew me away, I thought it would be good but this was near perfect, drinking the whole bottle alone was a pleasure and would love to do it again sometime."

"This is the best, and most balanced sour I have ever had. It is just unreal. This is what a sour should be. Thanks to my buddy who was kind enough to share this bottle. If you like sours, you will fall in love with this beer. I would pay lots of money for a full case of this stuff. Just a very special beer."

"Vintage 2013, pours a hazy orange color with a little off white head. Huge apricots, citrus and slight funk on the nose. Tastes of peaches, apricots, citrus with a nice acidic sour, funk balance through out and leaves a pleasant dry tart finish. Each sip leaves me wanting more. One of my top 5 beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer really stands out as the best sour I've had. It truly has fantastic balance. It's so delicious drinking with the fruit being the all star in this beer."
"'13 tastes like a moldy, juice-soaked carpet, but '12 and '14 are on point. DON'T AGE THIS BEER. Your enamel will thank you"

"Overall: A very impressive fruit sour from Cantillon. However, since it was nearly a year old, I was not able to enjoy it fresh as the brewery highly recommends. I'm betting the fruit character is much more intense and vibrant, and I look forward to this beer being released next month. Hopefully I get another bottle, after which I will update or add on this review to reflect that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has been 6 or more months since I've had this...but it still haunts my memories of what great Cantillon can be. For sure this is not one to age. I've learned...I'll be drinking my next bottle days after I have it home and the sediment has settled. If you can buy it...YOU'RE DAMN LUCKY."
""
"Going to calculate mainly the fresh ones give it around a 4.8."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, an excellent drinking experience. This is only the second Cantillon Ive had to date, the first being St. Lamvinus. If I had to choose a preference, Id probably go with St. Lamvinus over this one, but no doubt that both are absolutely excellent. Highly recommend."

"the great and mighty fou foune, I finally found one. at a hole in the wall called novare res in downtown Portland, maine. this was on the last page of an incredible beer list. I ordered one and was told they were out. I threw a fit like a baby, said id driven 600 hundred miles to get one, and she said she would be right back. she offered me a 2005 lou pepe instead, but I just couldn't switch gears that quick. after sitting there debating what to do for a few minutes, the manager or owner emerged with a bottle of fou foune for me, all dusty and looking very much like something special. they chilled it for a few minutes, before serving it up in a very cool old mail bin with two cantillon wine glass type containers. the beer pours faded orange in color, rustic looking, cloudy, with a white head like fine champagne, rising and receding to about an inch. the smell is just mental, lots and lots of acid here, a fine lambic is the base. lacto and lemon, tart and funky. the apricots seem to add a floral element, a fruity sweetness to balance the sour, but I don't distinctly get apricots just by smelling it. it has the interesting effect of making my mouth water for every tasty treat ive ever had all at once. im watering like blue razz blowpops, sour nerds rope, lemon shaved ice, and porterhouse steak all at once. this sensation alone makes this beer a 5 out of 5 overall. nothing in the beer or culinary world has ever had this effect on my palate, and ive been around both a few times. the taste is very impressive, again, a mellow but distinct lambic as its base, I start to taste the apricots. they have a gentle fuzzy feel and flavor, like licking the outside of one. there is a sweetness there, but the juicy character of the fruit and pulpy morning time flavor profile are not dominant. what is dominant is the yeast. the best of lambic, tart and dry as any beer ive consumed. its acidic, and the lower the bottle gets and the warmer it gets, the more this is pronounced. my last yeasty sip is impossibly sour, putting hair on my chest to say the least. its dry on the palate after an insanely effervescent carbonation experience, but I taste the beer for miles and miles after the swallow. not sure ill have another beer again for awhile (yeah right). this is a one of a kind brew, an art form really, and worth all of the accolades its received and then some. nothing like it on the planet, and easily the best 50 bucks I have spent in awhile. not sure lambic will ever be the same..."
"Dyan shared a bottle of this with me a few months ago and it absolutely blew my mind. Fou Foune is one of the best lambics on the planet and one of my favorite beers at the moment. If you are anywhere near this beer pick it up, more than one would be ideal. Thanks for the bottles, Lum!"

"Overall- Easily in the top 5 beers I've had. Truly outstanding. Lives up to it's hype and more."

""

"Adding fruit to lambic likely began simply as a means of not wasting precious produce in the days before refrigeration; anyone who's ever tried to eat local knows how short the growing season is and how difficult it is to find use for a whole harvest before it spoils. It turns out that, in the case of Fou' Foune anyhow, this practice happened to make one of life's most sublime treats."

"I could/would drink this all day long..."

"Overall: Bam! This baby hits the spot. I really don't know what is better, the smell or the taste. This has to be one of the better sours that I have ever had. Very satisfied."

"O - Solid apricot / peach lambic that balances the light sweetness of the fruit with the tartness for the lambic. The tarter aspects defintiely dominate compared to the other flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is close to my favorite Cantillon and close to my favorite beer. The apricot integrates so well with the standard gueuze/lambic flavors...much better than cherry or raspberry, in my opinion. The result is balanced, complex, bracingly tart, drinkable, and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The aroma and flavor are absolutely the best part of this beer, which is nice since those are usually the two biggest factors in a beer for me. This one definitely looks great as well, but with the huge apricot aromas and the complex stone fruit flavors bouncing around with the brett funk and huge acid, the flavor and aroma are what make this a world-class beer. I'm glad I got to down a whole bottle of this by myself instead of the half ounce pour I was lucky enough to have at a tasting earlier this year."
""
""
""
""
"D - Fantastic complexity and balance. The apricots are fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- As already mentioned, a straightforward fruit lambic, fresh, lively, amazingly drinkable for the style, though maybe not as complex as i expected"

""

"Apricot lambic is a good idea."
""

"A very big thanks to DaveHack for opening this gem. The beer poured out as a slightly hazy orange color with a white head on top. Good retention and moderate lacing. The smell is awesome. Very fresh and fruity despite the souring of it. Excellent nose on this beer, I could smell it forever. The taste is tart with a fruitiness to it also. Very well balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth, not as pungant as some sours. Overall this is excellent. So glad I got to try this one."
""
""
"O: amazing. Had this beer at the brewery which only added to the overall experience. Love it. Balanced yet nuanced. Every sip presents something new."
""
"O: World class beer. It might be the best apricot sour I have ever had. However... I was expecting it to be a bit more ""in-your-face"" apricot. The fruit is there, but it's not as intense as I would have imagined. Still... I'm grasping at straws to find a flaw with this beer. Wonderful. I can't wait to try this beer with a few years in it to really make the sourness intensify."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a wonderful beer. The great depth of an aged lambic really shows the brett character along with the nice well rounded but full tartness. The fruit flavor really comes through and can hold its own with the tartness and they both work very well together. Delicious. Thanks Emerge for sharing."
""
"As it breathes the fruit really comes out and it becomes a much brighter beer. This beer is amazingly well rounded, and the balance is incredible. Juicy apricots are contrasted with a touch of leather, barnyard and funk on top of a nice integrated and gradual sourness. The fruit is what shines here though and it makes for an incredible lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very well done fruit lambic. Thanks Mike!"
""
""
""
"O- 8/10 sourness. Very good sour. Night peach and citrus with lots of tart, funk and sour going on. Would like to try one with 5 or so years on it to see if the carbonation and acidity mellows."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad to have finally tried this one, was definitely a treat, and one of my favorite beers."
""
""
"Bottle shared with Damico at Torst. Pours a pale orange yellow color with white foam head. Aroma of peach, funk, and slight vinegar. Has a sweet tart taste with gentle notes of peaches and perfect foamy mouthfeel. Great body for the style. A big thanks to Damico and a great day."
""
""
""
"Higky recommend"

""

"My expectations for Fou' Foune were high, and they were surpassed beyond belief. This is such a masterful beer in nearly every sense of the word. Most definitely the best sour I've had to date, and possibly the best beer I've ever had, period. Fou' Foune is a masterpiece, a work of art, and a one-of-a-kind benchmark of the style. Make it your life-goal to get your hands on Fou' Foune if you haven't already."

"O- This was a great fruit lambic that definitely lives up to Cantillon's esteemed reputation in the beer community. The beer is definitely typical of Cantillon and carries the Cantillon musty funkiness that is so unique from they're brewery. The funkiness balances terrifically with a nice peach presence and is highly drinkable for a sour. Glad I was able to try this and I wish obtaining bottles was a little bit easier."

"Overall: Better than I remembered from my last tasting. Not my favorite Cantillon but certainly a well done and very traditional fruit lambic."
""
"OVERALL: Really enjoyed this, and it definitely won the Cantillon fruit lambic showdown at the Kebab and Cantillon dinner party. The fruit was really nice and in enough force to put on a show, but not so much that it dominated the nose or flavor profile. Delicious and quite complex, this one is actually worth all the praise it gets. Glad to finally have tried this while paying attention. Cheers guys!"

"Poured a pale golden orange in color with pale yellow highlights and a nice thin bubbly head that left some good frothy lacing sticking to the glass. Definitely had the signature cantillon bretty barnyard funk upfront on the nose with fresh peach apricot fruit notes, good citrusy notes with oak wood and nice acidcy for sure. The peachy apricot fruits came acroos more on the palate alongside great sour acidic notes with oaky wood accents which brought out more flavors, a touch of vanilla and plenty of brett barnyard horse blanket character to go around. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a fruity, semi sweet, bretty funky, woody, acidic sour and dry finish. I definitely dig this beer all around but I thought the 09 vintage was way better."

"I can’t believe it took me so long to try this. Hazy lemon colored pour, small white head. Tart peach aroma. Flavor is sour peach, grapes, tannins, citrus, lemons...wow. Finishes nice and sour, I was sipping for a bit. This is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is cloudy orange with no head and no lacing. Smell is heavy with fresh peach which integrate nicely with the funky base. Notes of wheat, lemon zest, and tons of acidity. Taste is just like the nose. Heavy fruit, nice fleshy peach character, followed by heavy acidic sourness. Delicious. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, delicious brew, one of my favorite cantillons."
"With full bottle pour, appearance is hazy brown with golden hues at the edges and generous white head. Nose is quite assertive with tingly candied apricots intermixed with light barnyard that thankfully stays in the background. Gorgeous sourness on the palate with the fruit in there at the same time, and it glides across the palate beautifully like a good Champagne. Loads of pleasing tartness on the finish. Incredibly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth the hype? Maybe. Super solid regardless. I would say definitely drink it within a year like the bottle says if not sooner. The apricot is too good. Had a 14 month old bottle and I could easily tell the difference in apricot levels although the older one had a heftier sourness to it."
""
"O: I've never had this beer so fresh and it's quite remarkable to see how much fruit aroma and flavor it packs in. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- A fantastic lambic with plenty of apricot and very sour. Pricey but worth every penny, I can't wait until I get to try this again. Could be more complex, but with how fruity and sour this is it work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an easy review...two words sum up this beer: well-crafted and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. A hazy orange golden beer with a moderate white head. The aroma is very fruity, filled with peach and apricots and a clear sourness. The taste is very well balanced and very fruity (apricots, peach, a touch of citrus). This is a wonderful lambic, near to perfection and a must drink for every lambic lover."
""
""
"O: most excellent lambic, so happy to have tried this finally. It's not overwhelmingly flavorful, but delicious and balanced for my tastes."
""
""
"O: The fruit is spectacular here, but it’s not quite as complex as I would have hoped. Still a worthy beer, but I think its ratings have gone up due to the difficulty in obtaining it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think this just might be my favorite Cantillon to date. This also drinks so incredibly easily, it was hard to nurse this I wanted to finish this in nothing flat it's so delicious and have more."
""
""
"O: The apricot flavor here is fresh and assertive, and works well with the base lambic."
""
"(O)- Just superb in every way. It has been awhile since I last tasted this (almost 2 years), and it is great to try it at a fresher stage since the bottle I had back in 2010 was an '05. So vibrant yet so sour and fresh tasting. Had to go back for a second pour."
"O-Yes definitely a Cantillon beer and no doubt fans of the brewery will like this brew but for my money I think either the standard gueuze or a rose de gambrinus is just as enjoyable if you are looking for eithe a straight gueuze or a fruit lambic and don't see the hype associated with this beer...other than it is hard to get."
""
"Super dry and effervescent. Plenty of fruit funk and sour qualities. You get some of the apricot but it's like the dry intense flavors of dried fruit. Very enjoyable. Again with this style its so complex and delicious that it's hard to describe. But in my personal opinion, not as great as I was hoping for and I think Zwanze 2012 was much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Terrific. One of the most delicious and most unique beers in the world. I really can't find anything to fault. Though I am sorry to have consumed my only bottle."
""
"Overall: This beer is flawless. That is all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A stunning beer. 750ml of heaven."
"Pours a deep clear golden color with a huge white head that slowly dissipates but remains a cap on the top. The aroma is quite tart with lemons and sour apricots dominating the nose. A solid hit of funk and light plastic phenol round out the nose. The flavor is fruity with apricots with a lemony tartness and hints of sour cherries and plums. A solid hit of horsey funk round out the flavor nicely. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel. I think I'm going to go against the grain on this one a little bit here. This is a fine beer and I enjoyed it, but I can't see what all the hype is behind this one."

""
"This is absolutely fantastic. Just delicious, and crazy drinkable. Putting down a 750 of this is no problem at all. Like a delicious apricot mimosa. Drink this."
""
"750mL 2011 bottle. The fresher this beer is, the better. More of a juicy Yellow Bus style peach nose with fuzzy skin and rich juice. Taste is not quite as aggressive. Really nice- not one I think is worth to hoard but rather to crack open immediately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle shared at the September 2012 Santa Cruz tasting. Pours cloudy orange with an off-white head. Aromas of juicy fresh apricots with vinous grapey chardonnay accents. Tart apricot flavor, very vivid and fruity and fresh, lemonhead candy, damp oak, pixie stix. Words cannot describe. Sooo good."
""
""
""
""
"O: The taste and smell of this sour are fantastic. Thanks to Rutager for sharing this whale."
""
"O-I’m hard pressed to think of many beers that surpass Fou Foune in quality. It is one of the best fruit lambic from probably the best brewery in the world. I need like 70 more bottles of this."
""
"Cost: $35 for a 750 ml bottle (bar prices)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Gave me a boner"
""
""
"Verdict: Fantastic lambic from Cantillon. Probably my favorite lambic they make. I've had older vintages, which are very special, but something about the fresh fruit is just so perfect."
""
""
""
"O - A good sour but nothing spectacular. The flavors and aromas are just so light and delicate to almost non-existent. This bottle was maybe 4 months old, so maybe something a little fresher would help?"
""
""
"O: Very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. Easy to drink and extremely enjoyable (I could happily have a couple of these but that seems unlikely with how difficult to find and expensive this beer is). Not overly sour but quite tart."
"O: For a sour beer, this is quite pleasant and very easy to drink because the fruity flavors of the apricots help to balance out the sourness."
"Rating 98/100"
""
"O - Definitely a great beer but it was a little bit of a let down for me. I thought the apricot was going to stand out a lot more then it did. Still another nice offering from Cantillon and glad I finally got to try it."
"My frist Cantillon and it sure as hell will not be the last."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good lambic and I am glad I got the chance to finally try it since I have passed on it in the past. Highly recommended and would drink again"
""
"Pours a slightly murky light honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with wood and apricot aromas. Taste is the same and has a fantastic apricot flavor that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a great level of carbonation with a very crisp and somewhat dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional beer and by far the best Cantillon I have tried so far by a longshot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this beer was basically every bit as good as the legend tells. It's a freaking delicious beer, however, as far as apricot goes I found The Bruery's Filmishmish to deliver more"
""
""
"Looks nice: cloudy, honey-orange color, with about a 1/2"" cap of delicate white bubbles for a head that recedes to a small ringlet, leaving soapy lacing on the glass. Distant, dry aroma, citrus zest, musty, touch of apricot. Tartness hits you up front on the palate, very drying, more citrus pith than anything, lemon juice, afterthoughts of candied apricot and grassy funk. Don't drink this if you have chapped lips. Fairly light bodied, a bit on the thin side, acidic, but with a good drying balance that improves the drinkability. Nice, but nothing really special going on here, but if you're a beer scene noob, you'll love it."
""
"O: a good beer, overall. A little watery and not terribly complex, it's still tasty and refreshing."
"M - Medium body, moderate to high carbonation."
"This is medium bodied, with great crisp drink-ability. This is an absolute gem; all that it's cracked up to be."
""
""
""
"Apricots and funk on the nose. Hints of acetic acid perhaps behind it all but minimally if at all. The fruitiness builds with time and the temperature of the beer increasing. Stellar funky nose that develops over time. I need to spend more time to think about this, in order to really do this justice, but I don't want to think too much The body has a strong effervescence that bites the tongue giving the beer a body that I think it would otherwise have lacked. More apricots in the body, with nice barnyard notes that pair well. A great beer I am glad to have 5 more of to consume over time and consider its growth..."
""
""
"lineup for me, but I am loving every drop of this and will look forward to having it again someday."
""
"Overall: Awesome beer. Glad that I was give an oppurtunity to try such a hard to get beer. I probably wont see another bottle of this beer in my life time. This is my second Cantillion I have tried and its very nice."
""
"Could drink a lot of this...yeah right. Loved it. Huge thanks to egrace84 for the share!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazingly drinkable brew, perhaps one of the most drinkable Cantillons I've had the pleasure to sample. The soft sweetness of the apricots cushions the palate beautifully. Lovely beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is alive with a clean and zesty texture that introduces its finish as soon as it does its initial taste. Drinkable, palatable, digestible... sure, but it takes a lot of concentration to understand the quick procession that this beer does, dancing across the tongue. It's incredible that a fruited sour ale delivers this intense of a dry beer without exposing any flaws in taste, astringency in texture, or wavering of body. Flawless? ...almost."
""
""
"4.5, 4.5, 4, 5, 4"
"D - My favorite Cantillon thus far next to St. Lamvinus. The fruit has faded a bit in the drink, which is a slight disappointment (drink the 2010 asap), but the nose is really spectacular."
""
""
"Drink- Damn tasty beer. I understand now, why so hard to get and why no one would say where bottles are."
""
"Overall this is world class, no bones about it. Flavor profile is exactly how you would want a fruited lambic to be, balance of fruit and funk is second to none. I don't think I would drink anything but Cantillon from June-August if I could readily track it down, but alas that will never happen. I prefer St. Lamvinus to this slightly but that is a personal preference, both are the two best Belgian lambics for my money."
""
""
"Clear gold in colour, with a white head and light lacing. A dense ring of retention remains. Nose is acetic with a typical Cantillon funk, light oak and a generally piercing acidity all around. Apricots are a bit hidden intially, but begin to reveal themselves more as this moves closer to room temp. Taste wasn't as sour as I had anticipated (7-8/10 sourness?), but still quite acidic in its own right. More white balsamic vinegar, Cantillon funk, only a sliver of oak, and similar to the aroma, warmth aids the revealing of the apricots. Some sweetness in there as well. Lighter medium body and sourness carries well into the finish. Fairly exquisite, and had my nose on this one for a better part of the time. Definitely a sipper, took me and the girlfriend over 2 and a half hours to get through this 750ml. Hoped for a bit more apricot flavour - perhaps a fresher bottle would've had more of this (eagerly awaiting one from a trading partner - will re-review!)"
""
"O - I could go on and on about this amazing brew. Cantillon doesn't make a ""bad"" offering, this one is great. Bottom line, if you have even a remote interest in this style, you owe it to yourself to seek this out. Even if you don't like the style, if you find it, drink it, odds are your mind will be changed. The price tag was hefty but zero regrets. Drinking it at Moeder just added the cherry (or apricot) on top."
""
""
"O: $30 for the bottle, which was worth it if you can swing the price. I'm so glad I finally got to try this, if you see it splurge. You'll thank me later."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As amazing as any Lambic (or any beer), soft and approachable for Cantillon. Masterpiece."
""
""
"O - A world class treat. I am so excited to drink this one. Clean, funky, fruity and good."
""
""
"4, 4.5, 5, 4.5, 4.5"
""
""
"Pleasant blend of apricots and funk. Mild tartness with a clean finish. One of the best shelf Cantillons."
""
"Overall, very enjoyable if you like your beer sour. Really nice flavour and aroma."
""
""
""
""
"Cantillon Fou' Foune pours a hazy tangerine, with about two fingers of white foam. The head retention is surprisingly good for a lambic, but there's not a speck of lacing left behind. The nose is an absolute apricot bomb, loads of fresh fruit jumping out of the glass. Lurking behind it is some wet hay brett funk and a light lactic sourness. It's a beautiful aroma, but a little bit more balance in terms of more funk and sour to compete with the fruit would really make this perfect. My thoughts on the flavor profile are fairly similar. The big blast of apricot up front is great, but the wild aspects of the beer almost seem like they're just sneaking into the picture on the back end. I really like this beer now, but I think with another 6 months on it, it would be absolutely sublime. One thing that doesn't need time to improve though is the mouthfeel. THe body i crisp and light and paired with a wonderfully bubbly, almost champagne-like carbonation. Fou' Foune is another absolutely killer beer from Cantillon, quite possibly my favorite that I've had from them. It's a shame it's relatively hard to get your hands on, because I'd love to see what a little age does to this beer."
""
""
"Overall Impression- While I waited for a month and stood in line for over an hour to get my glass of this, I had WAY too high of an expectation for this lambic from Cantillon. It was still very nice and enjoyable but would like to get my hands on a bottle of this since everyone agreed the bottle version was MUCH better. Still would HIGHLY recommend enjoying this one if you ever find it but didn't find it to be one of my top beers produced by Cantillon."
""
""
"This pours a hazy orange color with a huge 3 finger head from the tap. Had to let it settle before taking first drink. Aromas are pretty strong with plenty of funk and fruits. Amazing smells. Taste is lots of funk with subtle but delicious hints of apricot. Nice acidity in the after taste. Somewhat sour but fresh. Mouthfeel is thin bodied and good carbonation from the tap. Overall this is truly amazing. So glad I got to try this. Will look to drink from a bottle in the future as I've heard its better from the bottle."
"Pretty amazing, would drink over and over."
""
"Wow...I'm so happy I finally get to review this beer. Bought it off a Belgian website. Bottled August 25th, 2011---fresh baby! I heard fresh is the best way to go with this beer. Pours a very hazy, straw yellow-orange color with a large white head. Very fizzy. Scent is just as funky as I was hoping it would be...quite funky. Sweet apricots in the aroma with some grass and funky cheese. Definitely some sharp cheese aromas. Lots of barnyard funk with a bit of stinky gym socks. Considering this is a fresh bottle, the aroma was much more funky than I was expecting...which is great! Taste is tart at first...not sour. Switches to sweet apricots, funky/strong cheese flavors with a ton of barnyard flavor. Then the apricots come back in, but more sour this time. Finishes even more sour than it started. Great finish to this beer...scratch that, THE BEST FINISH. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some puckering notes and very highly carbonated...could use a little less carbonation. Drinkability is high as it could get. Overall, another AMAZING beer from Cantillon. Now that I've tried this gem, I will be seeking out more."
""
""
""
"From 750 ml bottle into in de verzekering tegen de grotto dorst lambic/gueuze glass.  Low white head atop hazy light gold body. Aroma of green apple and most certainly apricot. Slight sweetness. Taste citric, with nice apricot. Tongue smacking, mouth puckering greatness. Awesome. "
"I can see why this is highly sought after. I am happy that I was able to secure one with the recent Cantillon distribution in MA."
""
""
"O: Great! the best cantillion so far."
"This poured a slightly cloudy orange yellow in color, with a great apricot aroma and noticeable tartness, even from the aroma. Simply amazing. There’s a big effervescence to this that lets the flavors dance across the tongue. The apricot floral-fruitiness is subdued, but its present and tasty. It’s tart, with a lingering, dry finish and a touch of sweetness like a firework going off. Half a pour wasn’t enough but its more than many had. Can’t wait to have another!"
""
""
""
"O: The flavors seemed slightly muted overall and it didn't wow me like I thought it would. It was still an above average lambic, but I expected more fruity flesh and a little more tartness."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the Beer Revolution Anniversary. Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is big apricot, some lemon funkiness, lactic, along with a bit of sweetness. The taste is tart with a bit of initial sweetness. Lots of apricot, tart lemon, signature Cantillon funkiness. Finish is tart. Medium body. Low carbonation. The fruit is really prominent here, more so than in other Cantillon lambics. It also has a bit more sweetness than other Cantillons, but certainly not too much."
"This is one of my favorite beers, by far the best in the Cantillon line for me. The balance of juicy fragrant fruit and expressive lambic in this beer is what other makers of fruited wild beers should strive to emulate. The best quality"
"With plenty of carbonation and a lightish body, the mouthfeel is just right. This really is a fine drinking experience. I'm glad I got a chance to try it!!"
"3.5/5/4.5/4/4.5"
""
"O: This is an excellent fruit lambic, and perhaps one of the best beers of any type that I've ever had. Fou'foune is an experience not to miss. I can't recommend it highly enough."
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel is very light bodied and nicely carbed up. A nice amount of sourness hits the gullet, yet not extreme. While I really enjoyed this, I could not get another glass, I went with Iris instead. I really want to try a fresh bottle of fou foune and make a solid decision on it."
"-GFunk"
"O-a nice crisp and refreshing lambic"
""
"This is the real deal. One if the best sours I've had. I could drink plenty...if it wasn't so hard to get and expensive. Definitely a treat!"
""
""

""
""
""

"Overall – Just a fantastic beer. I traded one of these away earlier this summer and am kicking myself for it now. One of the better Cantillon’s out there for sure."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin white head that fads to a patchy lacing. The aroma is very delicate, notes of citrus, peach, pineapple, sour lactose and a hint of funk. The taste is similar to the aroma and just as delicate and complex. There is more citrus then I was expecting in the flavor, lemon being the prevailing flavor. It is only slightly sour, which allows for the other fruity flavors to breath. The body is medium light with a medium carbonation and it is exceptionally easy to drink. I didn't want my glass to end, but alas all good things must come to an end."
""
""
""
""
"Fou' Foune is a notable fruit lambic but it is far from being one of my favorite Cantillon offerings. Without the knowledge that this beer was brewed with apricots, I never would have guessed that it was. Furthermore, the beer seemed to lack some overall complexity. Based on the scores that this receives, and on its price point, I was expecting more."
"I really enjoy the unique fruitiness of this lambic, unlike any I've had so far."
"O: It wasn't as good as what I was hoping for when I first heard apricot lambic, but still a pretty solid brew. Maybe its different out of the bottle. If i could find a bottle, I wouldn't pass it up. Cheers."
"Whoa $23 for a bottle...definitely worth trying once. I have another bottle to let sit for a bit, but don't plan on opening it for awhile. Highly recommended, although some people may get an upset stomach after drinking...."
"O- An incredible beer, I'm a big fan of Cantillon but this is probably one of my favorite beers from them. Very refreshing and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad to have tried this. Are there any better fruit lambics than the ones Cantillon makes? Not really. 4/5"
"O - The best Lambic that I have tried to date. The balance between fruit and sourness is a masterful display of brewing that leaves you just wanting a whole lot more. This beer deserves the hype."
""
"O: I'm really glad I got to try this. I kept wanting to come back to it. Couldn't let it sit for very long between sips. If the bottled version is even better, then I'd love to get some."
""
"I think it's at its peak. Fantastic."

"Pours a hazy orange with a loose white head, not much lacing. The smell is tangy, then sweet, like wood sorrel and honey. The taste starts off with some sour notes, not too strong, with some round floral and fruity notes in the middle, with a dry finish. It's crisp and clean in the mouth, with lots of carbonation and a thin body. Glad to have had a chance to try this one."
"Just had this beer 2011 vintage 750ml and boy was I impressed with this one. Now I know why people are always looking for it. This beer pours a beautiful orangish color with a small white head. The head was the only part I was expecting more from. The smell is huge vibran apricots up front followed by a tart funky slightly barnyard smell. The flavor is again huge on ripe apricots with a nice sourness and funk in the finish. Not to acidic just right on the acidity. The mouthfeel is light and juicy with the apricot flavors well carved and overall an amazing lambic. Just outstanding."
""
""
"I had heard a lot about this beer and it didn’t disappoint. I think that the fact that this was a fresh bottle really helped, or at least gave me what I was looking for out of this, as those vibrant apricot flavors just made this. This is an fantastic Lambic and one that I will be seeking out again in the future."
""
"O: I’m really disappointed with this beer. I had really hoped this would be amazing as it’s impossible to find and everyone wants to try it. Really, it reminds me of their gueuze, just not as good. Certainly not bad and I’d try it again but I wouldn’t jump through the hoops that people do to try this (it’s just not worth it). B to B + range."
"I think this is a good beer, but no beer should cost $30+"
""
""
"O: this has become a religious experience. I can see why people hunt for this. My hunt starts now since I just finished this bottle. Do not pass this up if you come across this bottle!"
"A great Cantillon, love the aroma and apricot flavor mixed with that classic Cantillon bug funk, a true treat for a surprisingly low price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not quite the super sour bomb that I was expecting, but surprises are always good, especially when the result is an insanely delicious beer like Fou Foune! Highly recommended, one I will certainly buy every year from now on!"

""

"O - For me, my favorite Cantillon beer that I have had (including Blabaer). I have a couple more bottles of this but can see myself making the plunge for more."
""
""
"O. Awesome citrus poppy goodness throughout this one, worth the hype and the hunt although with the right people it might just fall into your hands."
""
"Rather mild for the usual Cantillon's that I'm used to, but still delivers that sharp acidic twang that is the signature of the style. Also a rare one where they recommend consuming it within a year of its production, rather than aging it as long as you can hold out. I feel lucky to have had the chance to sample this, though still not a huge fan."
""
""
"O: This is an amazing fruit beer and one that incorporates a rather mild fruit very well. Light, crisp, flavorful and aromatic. I wish I could get this more readily."
"Also, something about the nose and taste seemed to evoke a Tripel slightly."
"O - What can I say, for a sour there's is some flavor to taste, great! You guessed it, this stuff is not made for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I absolutely love this beer! Having it on-tap at Brouwer’s during Seattle Beer Week in May was awesome, but in the bottle it holds up just the same. Lambic is growing on me, but this is done so perfectly it is hard to find anything bad about it. Crisp. Clean. Beautiful. Delicious. The list could go on..."
"O - This is the best fruit lambic I have ever had. It really captures the apricots, and I can't imagine aging this any longer as the fruit sweetness is perfect. However, its not as mind shattering as I thought it would be. Is it worth $28 and the hunt of landing a bottle? Probably not...but it is delicious and really well made."
"2012 vintage addendum: The 2012 isn't as fruit-forward as the 2011 was, but is a lot more sour. It still maintains the apricot flavor, but it's more mixed in with the other flavors than out front as it was with the 2011."
""
""
"O-I know i stated earlier maybe i might of cracked it too early but after this i think i did the right thing as the flavours just hit you and suprisingly i really dont like apricots off the tree but this drop even though the Apricots are there they just become a nice mix of the Lambic itself without being the forefront and now i understand the hype this brew deserves cheers drink if you can find."
""
""
""
""
"o: I'm pretty new to sours and this is honestly an awesome experience. I would highly recommend this beer. My wife even liked it a lot as it seemed more champagne-like than what one thinks of as a typical beer. Very complex overall."
"2010 vintage poured on tap at hamiltons tavern. Pours a nice, golden staw color, hazy, no head. Only a few specks of foam hang around. Nose has soft apricots, belgian yeast esters, hay, and a pinch of sweet fruity candy. On the tongue it follows suit, sour apricots, dry, yeasty, in the middle thru the end Im reminded of an easy saison. Finishes with a dry champange feel. Although not very heady, lots of carb bubbles come thru in the mouth. No bite. Not overly sour, only slightly puckering. I am very excited to have tried this. It has been a huge want for me and it makes me even more anxious to land a bottle of it. Thanks santa."

"Still not converted but I would drink this again when offered."
""
"Poured a corked and capped 750ml into a Cantillon tumbler. This beer pours a ultra hazy Orange with a 2 inch cap that quickly disappears into just a thin line around the inside of the glass. Just a hint of soapy lacing lazily slides down the inside of the glass. The aroma is funk and apricot. Wet grass and damp earth. Grapefruit pith layer with apricots. Fantastic stuff. The flavor is spot on apricots. Underneath is lambic funk. Old closets with damp earth. Citrus pith with crab oranges. All wrapped up with fresh apricot. The mouthfeel is spot on. Fresh and crisp and finishes bone dry. Cantillon really knows how to make faNtastic beer. I truly wish I could buy this year round."
""
"O - Awesome lambic. The apricot is delicious and blends well with the sour notes and also with the yeasty funk. Very nice (4.5)"
"This one was very different from the other Cantillon I have drank. This is very fruit forward and the fresh apricot is very apparent in the taste. Right now the funk and sour taste is there but not nearly what it's like in other Cantillon. I look forward to drinking and aging a number of these."
""
""
""
"I just can't get over how good this beer smells, I'm only merely impressed by the other aspects, solid stuff for sure and I'm not mad I have a few more to drink but I'm scared the fruit will fade if I age it. I may have spent my kids Collage fund on this stuff but this works well for me because as far as I know I don't have any kids. Yeah Me!! 1000 beers in and still no children Woooo Hooo!!!"
""
"O: Great sour. This one deserves the hype that is has. I hope to cross paths with this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A lovely, enjoyable fruit lambic - all the expected talking points are there, and in admirable balance - no palate wreckage today, mon ami. Fruit, malt, funk, and brio, all in well-blended moderation. This bottle is certainly going down faster than any of its colleagues who have gone before."
""
""
"Overall a worldclass beer. One of my favorites!"
""
""
"This bottle is dated ""Bottled: August 18, 2011"". It's the youngest I've ever seen a bottle. This beer pours a slightly cloudy dingy tangerine orange in color with a slight white head that turns into a lacing around the edges of the glass. The aromas are of fresh, lightly sweet, and tart, juicy, mouthwatering candied apricots witha slight acidic sour. It has to be one of the most impressive noses of any lambic. The flavor features tart and juicy fresh apricot, plenty of sharp citric acidity, light oaking, must, and light funk. It has great flavor and finishes light and dry, which makes it even more drinkable. Overall this is one of the finest lambics I've had to date. This is my third time trying it and I appreciated it most this time, at just over three months old. It was a treat!"
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall this was a good beer but not any better than any other Cantillon fruit lambic, in fact, I prefer St. Lamvinus and Vigneronne to this beer. Good lambic and glad I go to try it, but not at all worth the effort/$$$ to pursue again..."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best out there. One of the best Cantillon’s, one of the best lambics. Everyone needs a bottle of this."
""
"---"
""
"Nice ruddy light orange color, hazy with flashes of gold. Upon pouring, a generous off-white foam rises and recedes quickly. Great balance of apricot and funk in the aroma. Not too overbearing, sweet apricot notes dance around the bugs. Flavor and mouthfeel are both fantastic as well. Light, dry and incredibly quenching - I finished it in just a few gulps. Haha. Again, light apricot, nice progression from sweet to sour to tart to musty to tart. There's a giant celestial apricot on the label. If i lived on the moon this would probably be my go-to beer."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy light peach color with a fluffy bubbly head. The nose is wonderful, lots of a fresh earthy mushroom, lambic funk, touch of leathery brett, notes of dry oak, strong peach and appricot sweetness in the back. The taste is great, very funky, earthy mushroom funk, a touch sweaty, bright peach and appricot flavors with a faint sourness in the finish. Medium body with a lively carbonation and silky smooth on the palate with a rather dry finish."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Very salivating and extremely satisfying across the board. There is no alcohol inclusion readily apparent despite the brew getting warmer than ideal during the session. I could absolutely kill this beer all day long. I would have no regrets choosing this as the only beer to drink for the rest of my life. A beautiful, perfect aroma is one of the best I have ever smelled in a beer. I strongly consider but hesitate giving this a perfect 5 rating... If a 4.99 rating were possible, that's what I'd give. I was lucky enough to have multiple draft pours of this beer 5 months ago so I knew what I was in for. Opening this bottle exceeded all expectations."

"O: Like much of what Cantillon produces, Fou Foune is a world class beer. I still prefer some of their others, especially when you factor in accessibility, but Fou Foune is a treat. Seek it out if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"SkÅL!"
" Fou'Foune has a totally complex amount of flavor with the apricot taste mixing sweet fruit with a tart and mild floral quality while at the same time mild spice and a woody tinge is blended in with slight lactic acidity which never seems to outdo the fruit, just augments it with a seriously intense amount of tropical notes. The apricot skin sour flavor comes out with slight lemony lactic tinges and hints of bitter tannin at times. The woody toastiness works very well alongside the floral and mild sweet flavors from the fruit. with a jammy apricot flavor the sour and complex amount of sweet tangy fruit notes linger until the last sip. The yeast at the end seems to give a more oaky quality that wasn't as evident in the first pour but even that is seriously tasty in its own way. The expectations for this beer were met and completely exceeded. A less aggressive sour than some cantillon beers but it impressed me even more with its balance. I am totally won over by this beer and the drinkability is ultra high to me."
"O: Another knockout brew from Cantillon. Can they mess anything up? So happy to have another one of these to try in another year or so."
"This is my favorite Cantillon to date. I don't see how it gets better than this. Thanks again, Ian!"
"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer and glad to see it has lived up to what I hoped it would be. The nose is pretty much perfect; I loved how much the apricots came through in it. Something I will certainly try and get more bottles of, and would be itnerested to see how it ages because I thought it was pretty perfect fresh. If you like apricots, this is our outstanding sour."
"O: really tasty, had this on cask at Moeder Lambic a couple of months ago and it was one of the best I've ever had--tasted exactly like strawberry-banana yogurt. In the bottle it was a little more sour and a little sharper, but the flavors were the same. Smell was really exceptional."
"O - Glad I was able to procure so many bottles of this online. It's amazing and I don't think I will be trading any of these away."
"My favorite Lambic fruit. Fantastic fresh apricot smell with a little earthiness. It smells like country. The taste is apricot, apricot, apricot, and a slight lemony sourness. No toot tart, well blanced, It so easy to drink, so refreshing, so well done. A must have Lambic !"
"Overall - Cantillon really does a terrific job with fruit lambics. They're more acidic than funky, which allows the fruit to shine. In this case, the fruit flavor is perfect and manages to showcase without being a fruit bomb."
"O: Definitely my favorite fruit lambic, though overall I still prefer Iris. The apricots here are really quite sublime, and the entire beer is amazingly delicate yet rich in flavor."
"On tap at beachwood bbq."
"Been wanting to get one of these for a while and was not disappointed. One of the better ones I've had."
"Overall: Just amazing. So refreshing, I was really bummed I couldn't just buy a whole glass. Loved the fruit and the level of sourness. I will definitely try to find this again one day."
"cloudy golden color with almost no head from the pour. Lacing on the walls of the glass appear to have sediment reminiscent of fruit pulp. smell is almost entirely of apricot with very little funk to remark on. Taste also has a ton of apricot, along with some sourness. Taste also has a bit of a woody taste as well. It's fantastic as the apricot is so obvious. One thing to love about cantillon's fruit lambics, the essence of the fruit is not lost with all the wild critters fermenting it and this one is no exception. This may be my favorite Cantillon."
"Overall: Epic. Certainly one of the best sours/lambics I've ever had, and one of the best smelling beers I've ever encountered as well. This beer deserves it's reputation. Track it down!"
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with a big white head. In the aroma, tart and fruity. In the taste, a dry tartness, and note of peaches, very similar to a dry white wine or riesling. A small sour bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry tart fruit in the aftertaste. Nice sour fruitiness, especially peaches, with a nice dryness."
"M: Soda Fizz. This has a very lengthy finish and again I have to note that the carbonation is most impressive. I figure it would easily be fantastic 10 years from now."
"Pours cloudy yellow with very little head after the pour. Smells of pure funk - barnyard aromas, musty, yet inviting. A little bit of old moldy-like wood. Acetic vinegar aromas permeate throughout. Tastes sour but not overly puckering. Hints of apricot. Tastes vinegar-like and inviting: great tasting. If this is a prime lambic example, I'm hooked!!!"
"O: Not much to say here that hasn't been said. This is obviously an excellent beer. Cantillon does amazing things and continues to impress me with every beer of theirs that I am fortunate enough to consume. I was very happy I had the opportunity to try this, and I would obviously drink it again."
"Though I'm curious to try an older vintage, I couldn't imagine enjoying this beer without the fruitiness. A phenomenal expression of natural sweetness and a superb lambic."
"Very glad I got to try this. My only problem is that my girlfriend absolutely loved it so now I have to find a bottle or two for a special occasion. Oh well, can't complain."
"O: Another fantastic lambic from Cantillon. Not a traditional fruit, but it certainly works. I have been wanting to try this for some time and it did not disappoint. Great beer."
"the cuvee of all these was a fuzzy, funky reflux-inducing treat, the dreg blend was like butter... so thankful for this once-in-a-lifetime experience, cheers to all the contributors"
"Cheers!"
"I got a pretty small pour of this and it was gone pretty quickly. Glad to have tried this, I'd like to be able to sit down with a bottle sometime."
"Overall - an excellent, excellent beer. I hope I can land a bottle or two in the future."
"Had the 09 vintage a couple of days ago from the bottle and I was blown away. This beer is even better than I remembered it to be. The apricot is phenomonal."
"Overall: I love sours and had many of them, but this one is like a geuze with pure lemon juice added, making it a bit unbalanced IMO. Just expected more of this one, although would never turn one down"
"Truly a world class beer that deserves it's standing among the elite lambics. Not worth mortgaging your house over, but undoubtedly something to seek out and try if you should ever get the opportunity."
"2010 bottle, shared with my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend. I have had older bottles of this, but never one nearly so fresh as this. The brew pours a turbid orange hue and is capped with a nice, albeit short-lived, white cap of froth. Wow. It smells so strongly tart, fruity and funky. It tastes like a tart Gueuze macerated in copious amounts of the juicy and tart flesh of apricot and peach - first and foremost - but it also suggests hefty doses of nectarine, Alphonso mango, Mandarin orange supremes, papaya, and loquat. Very very tart. One of the most puckering beers I've had, sip after sip. Many standard nuances of a Cantillon brew (ex.: grassy, woody-tannic and/or bright lemon-y) are obfuscated by the brutal funkiness of this heavily fruit-laden Lambic. Strong acidity here, from the sharply tart malic-tartaric-citric acid notes (akin to sour candy), to the heavy malt vinegar nuance, and finally rounded out by the pungent overipe-rotten orchard fruit notes and a musky hay-straw-barn funk. Overall, this beer is a stunner. Relatively fresh, like this bottle is, the brew is as intensely fruity as any you're likely to encounter. Give it 5 years or so, such as the bottle urwithdave shared with me recently, and the brew is equally stunning, but radically different. The fruit is a ghostly nuance after 5 years, and all of the elements are expressed in a divinely sublime manner, as opposed to the shocking intensity of the fresh brew."
"Overall this was an outstanding beer that I was fortunate enough to be able to try. While I have been venturing into sour beer, the 08 version of this beer is the best I have ever had and confirmed my love for wild yeast. Outstanding."
"Overall: It is a cruel joke that this beer is so hard to come by in the United States. I am beginning to wonder if I should move to Belgium just to be able to drink Cantillon all the time. Seriously."
"O - Easily one of the best sours out there. The sourness is strong but if you can get by it you are in for a treat. The fruit is a perfect complement to all that funky goodness. I can't wait to have this on-tap in a few days."
"D-Without question one of the finest fruit sours I have had the opportunity to enjoy. I honestly can find nothing ""wrong"" with this beer. If this could be my summertime lawn mower beer it would! A refreshingly tasty, tart, flavourful and satisfying brew!"
"The first time I had this beer it was 6 years old and it was a sour bomb. The fruit was barely kicking, but it was still enjoyable. I would have to say I prefer the fresh bottles for the great balance of sweet and sour. My favorite fruit lambic to date."
"Flavor is delicious--tart and fruity with hints of peach sourness hitting the sides of the tongue. Very bright and fresh, and the tartness doesn't overpower the palate. The apricot gets a bit lost after a few sips, but that's to be expected. Excellently carbonated, the light body glazes the palate with ease. Just a well-crafted beer...Fou Foune is a Cantillon sour at it's finest."
"O: I was really glad to have stumbled upon this beer and was happy to give it a try. Would definitely have again."
"10/10"
"There's a nearly perfect amount of effervescence to this beer. The active carbonation really assists with the acidity. Overall, this is one of the best lambics I've ever had. I still can't believe that a KC beer bar got in at least a half-case of Fou' Foune. I consider myself very very lucky to have been able to try this beer. It's one of the rare instances in the beer world that lives up to every bit of its hype. This is a world-class beer."
"O - what can I say? My introduction to Cantillon brews was a success. I use to think (in my younger days) that Lindemans was the essence of what a lambic should be. I realized later that beers should pull their greatness from natural ingredients and not added sugar. Cantillon really shows that natural ingredients can come together to make a beer that really puts the fruit it was aged with in the forefront."
"The feel is good. Nice crisp and light body with soft carbonation. Overall this one is the real deal. It's easily quickly becoming one of my favorite sours."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, peaches, apricot, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, peaches, apricot, and a slight tart note. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is nothing short of excellent. Everyone at the tasting (including myself) agreed that this was one of the Top 5 beers (out of 45) that we tasted during the night. The aroma was quite inviting and pleasant on the nose. The flavor was very complex and smooth at the same time making this one really easy to drink. This one even looked quite nice as well for a lambic. Really glad I have a bottle of this sitting in my cellar to see how it develops over time. Definitely get this on your palate if you have not before. It is definitely worth trading for without a doubt."
"D - great taste, it is a sipper at becomes alot to drink the whole bottle."
"overall: great"
"Poured clear orange golden color with minimal fizzy white head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Good tart apricot & yeasty aroma. Medium to full body with tingly sticky texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy funky fruit flavor with a solid tart fruit and small alcohol bite finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout lambic."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and lingering after swallowing. Another absolutely wonderful beer from Cantillon - excellent flavor and great use of apricot."
"Pours a hazed gold color, orange highlights. Minimal ring of bubbles, leaves some lacing. First scent brings a definite tart and sour profile, fruit punches through quite aggressively with appricot being backed by peach, a fresh malted grain profile peeks through along with some musty earthyness. Taste is quite impressive - sour and tart without becoming overly puckering, strong fruit notes without being too sweet. Apricot supported by notes of peach and even a touch of berry. grains are musty and lightly damp but freshly dried. Medium bodied, great carbonation level. Great great beer from Cantillon. Bold fruit notes and n control tartness."
"It's was a true pleasure to finally sample the iconic Fou' Foune from Cantillon and it was worth the hefty price tag that came per ounce. One to sip and savor, in my opinion."
"Tried on bottle and tap. I prefered the tap version as the apricots were so intense in the aroma as the bottle had more funk and barnyard. Apricot, lemon and peach flavors. Moderate acidity for a Cantillon. The palate could be drier and the carbonation more lively but this a stellar offering by Cantillon once again."
"O: Simply put, this is the best blended lambic I have ever had. This will be a tuff one to beat as well. This is also the most refreshing sour beer I have ever tasted. Bravo!"
"O: I really love this, the apricot goes along perfectly with all the funky, earthy flavors and sourness of the lambic. Absolutely delicious and highly drinkable, another incredible creation from Cantillon."
"Hazy orange pour with much carbonation. The aroma is out of control. Floral, sour and funky. I'm getting peaches more than apricots, but the idea is there and well expressed. Stone fruits, shall we say? Unbelievable. I want this inside me. And so I do. The sour and funk are so complimentary to the fruit that it's hard to discern the flavors from one another. It marries so well as to make them indistinguishable nearly as separate flavors. Damn! This is a beautiful beer, an inspiration for these clearly darkening times.."
"Overall, this beer was very good but the hand pump/cask serving seems t have curtailed the sour acetic character a bit. The result s a well balanced softer beer but I prefer the more tart funky bottle and regular tap version."
"O- I've been blown away by this beer every time I have it. Hands down the best brew I've ever had from cantillon and one of my favorite beers ever. I can't say enough about how amazing this brew is. Get some in your body any way possible."
"All of these things that I speak of seem to work in harmony with each other and not overtake one another. Very light and delicate, and very refreshing and balanced. I would love to drink one on a hot summers day. I shared a glass with my brother whose beer of choice is Bud Light Lime and he loved it. Now he loves lambics and sours and because of this beer he went and bought a case of Cuvee Rene. Thanks Fou Foune cause you may have turned someone from the dark side."
"Served slightly chilled, a huge head appeared on a fast pour decanted into one glass to share between the three of us. Hard to tell how much sediment was left, but I would guess 1-2 ounces. Color was a light yellow with a gold hue up to the light with a couple tiny bits of sediment swimming around. Smell was sharp fruit and some vinegar. Described by Ari as ""smelling a peach pit."" Notes of peach and apricot skin were very evident. The taste was an intense combination of resiny sour apricot and fruity acidity, while much funk was almost nowhere to be found. Unnoticeable alcohol on the palate and finish, but a slight burn from the acidity was present. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and I'm sure it would have been a cinch for any of us to drink over a liter of this. I've had Fou'foune a few times (many courtesy of Weisguy), including a fresh 750 of the 2010 bottling, but this bottle stood out as nearly a whole nother beer than what I tasted before. Much more fruit on the nose and tongue, while the balanced acidity made for a very enjoyable lambic."
"375ml bottle with Japanese label on back. I believe it was '09. Thanks Kyle for this one. This was not my first time having this beer. But this bottle was exceptionally good. Poured a nice hazy golden orange. Unbeleiveable aromas of peaches and apricots, unlike any other fruit Cantillon I have had before. Great acidity, definitely a little Cantillon funk, but very mild. Just like the aromas, the flavor was spot on apricots and other stone fruits. Very enjoyable."
"O: No disappointment here. I've been wanting to try this for a long while. Cantillon keeps supplying a consistent, clean and funky brew that leaves no doubt nor regrets."
"Drinkability and overall - I can only drink one glass of any sour beer at a session and lambics not my favorite style. However, this beer is complex and mixes the sweetness of apricots and the sour of a lambic well. A world class beer."
"Notes- This is a good take on a lambic- one of the best fruit beers I’ve had. Despite the complexity of the apricot, sourness imparted by the wild yeast, and medicinal notes it’s all balanced very well. A respectable entry by Cantillon. I'd get it again in a heartbeat."
"Bracingly sour and tightens up your jaw. Finish of apricot jam. This is really a two part flavor of intensely sour unripe apricots and then bright and soft ripe apricots. Oh but how much flavor there is. Any kind of funkiness is sort of drowned out."
"Overall, definitely up there among the best sours I have ever encountered. Wonderfully complex, fruity, and refreshing. Definitely will get this every opportunity I get."
"The feel is light and spritzy; it is clean and refreshing. It is easy to see why this is a favorite, as it is so enjoyable in every aspect. Another example of Cantillon's incredible proficiency in fruit lambic production."
"O: Well what else can you say? Another world class beer from Cantillon."
"Light bodied with soft carbonation. Draft may be a lot less carbonated then from bottle, so I'll have to track down a bottle for comparison. Refreshing, easy to drink lambic, with mild but present tartness, sweet fruits and earthy funk. Well made beer."
"As much as I liked this, I can't justify spending the extra $10 to $12 over Gueze, Kriek, or Iris. It's really not better than them, and IMO, Iris is still the best one out there."
"With pardonable exaggeration, I would say Fou Foune has all the characteristics of ""the perfect beer."""
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty average. The sourness destroys the palate, so it makes having more than one a bit of a chore. Overall, a very good brew, not in my top 10 sours, but very solid. Skal."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"This is truly a balanced and highly enjoyable lambic. It's also somewhat rare around these parts."
"Drinkability is great like usual. Nice sourness with a good helping of fruit and funk. This on-tap version seemed to have some extra grassy bitterness to it, which I liked quite a bit. It helped to bring out some of the earthier and more floral aspects of the beer. Anyways, I hope I get to see this beer on-tap again some day. Excellent stuff."
"This is my first review on BA. I waited quite some time before I decided to start reviewing beer. I waited until I had a better trained pallet and understanding of beer, so enough about me lets talk about this wonderful delight known as Fou Foune. I shared a 2010 with Shades Of Gray who so graciously opened my eyes to many Cantillons. First the look of this beer was very appetizing. Its an burnt orange-ish color and leaves a very nice head, full of lacing. Smell is very fruity, definitely strong apricot notes and some funk. Taste, WOW, I'm blown away. Very tart (as to be expected). Just a perfect mesh of carbonation, tart, apricot, and some what earthy in a very good way. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is it left me wanting more. Extremely quenching to the taste buds. . Again Big thanks to Shades Of Gray."
"Notes: This beer got better and more fruity as it warmed, so I would recommend drinking it at cellar temp., at least. Room temp. might be even more beneficial."
"D: I've experienced one or two offerings in my time so far that have redefined what I thought beer could be and how incredible it could taste. There's no doubt in my mind that this is one of those offerings. It's a beer that I'm almost scared to finish for fear of not know when it'll grace my lips again. Worth all the accolades it receives. A once in a lifetime drink."
"Pours a golden orange honestly it is the color of an apricot. The beer has a big head that leaves some lace. The aroma is lots of barn-yardiness, but with a lot of apricot fruitiness in there as well with some both clean and dirty laundry. The flavor smacks you in the face right away with apricot, fresh, delicious apricots. The beer is very very sour. It's also really dry with a dryness akin to say a brut. The fruitiness continues with some lemon rind earthy on sour notes. Dominantly this beer is packed with sourness and apricot flavor. The palate is fizzy but remarkably full and easy to drink. Just one damn fine beer."
"D - Drinkability is quite good for Fou' Foune. Even though I'm not an apricot fan, this is still a great brew. Apricot flavors are pretty mild overall which makes it work very well with my palate. The more it warms, the more it smooths out which adds another appealing dimension to this fine elixir. It encompasses all the great lambic qualities I've come to expect form the folks at Cantillon."
"B: 50, 5, 14, 17, 9 = 95"
"2009 bottle served in a white wine glass at room temp. Pours a nice, slight thick orange-gold with a thin ring of white bubbles persisting. Beautiful nose full of peaches, apricots, slight funky brett. Really round in the nose. Like most Cantillon, it's fairly bracing and hard in the mouth. Really big peach, apricot presence. Full and round, vinous and white wine like. The fruit is great at this age, but a hard, slightly metallic age tells me this one would likely get better with some years on it. Very enjoyable, kinda like a slightly more acidic Duck Duck Gooze."
"Cantillon makes incredible beer. While I don't believe this one will supplant St. Lamvinus as my favorite, it's not too far off. It's chock full of flavor, and is very deep and complex. It will challenge even the most sophisticated palate. If you happen to run across one of these, jump on the opportunity. It's worth at least one purchase...even with the steep price tag."
"Paired *exquisitely* well with triple-creme cheeses. Not only one of the best sours I've ever had, probably the best beer + cheese pairing I've ever had."
"Overall, a very drinkable sour beer. A bit weak of aroma, but what is there is nice. Fairly sweet. I could drink a lot of this one."
"Bottle. 2008 vintage. Pours a slightly hazed orange amber color with a slight white head that collars around the glass. The aroma is awesome with definite ntoes of apricot along with some acidity and funkiness. Light mouthfeel with some good carbonation. The taste is really nice with a balance of fruit notes (apricot, grapefruit) and sour acidity. This one does leaves you puckering a bit but not overly so. Overall, a really good beer and one I am glad I got to try."
"VERY puckering in the mouth. I get small hints of apricot and tons of acidity, enough to rip away the enamel on your teeth. As the beer dries, a cheese aftertaste is left with the puckering sourness. I was puckering a lot as I drank more and more of Fou' Foune, but I still liked it overall."
"D - Love this, but it's not like you can session it without burning out your taste buds. Great stuff though, want to have it again."
"There is little sweetness to the flavor, but a lot of apricot. The finish is dry and sour. The coat is sweet and fruity but not oppressive. It is a very drinkable beer. Another fine Cantillon product. I wish I had more of it."
"D- The sourness and acidity will limit the drinkability for sure. However, I had a full bottle between us and I didn't have any problems. My taste buds were completely destroyed afterwards, but man did I ever love these brews. The 05 was better due to the intense sourness, but the 09 was definitely much more fruity."
"D - for me à little bit to sour , but its à awesome brew"
"A tasty lambic but this is hugely sour."
"D- I don't know how much more than one glass I would want. It seems to be the perfect amount because of how sour it is. I can confidently say this is the most sour beer I have ever had."
"750ml corked and capped bottle. Poured a translucent, straw gold with a bright white, frothy/creamy head. Nose reveals apricots, grapefruit and cork. Taste is extremely salty - some apricot peaks out in the flavor profile; however, it is very much masked by the saltiness. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively, refreshing carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Acidity lightly stimulates the salivary glands. This is delicious - extremely tasty and really quite refreshing This is one lambic I could drink all day. Probably my favorite Cantillon to date. Reminds me of Cascade's The Vine to some degree."
"D - A bit of rot-gut ensues from the acidity in this beer. Great brew but it's a sipper and definitely best split a few ways I'd say. Thanks again Adam!"
"Overall I want to find cases of this stuff so I can drink it constantly. Thanks Adam for giving me the chance to finally try this one. Now I want more."
"D: This beer grows on me more each time I have it."
"A little past its prime."
"Reviewed on: 04-04-2010"
"D - Extremely drinkable sour. Definitely lives up to its reputation and doesn't disappoint. Tons of complexity here with new flavors being discovered throughout the bottle. Matches my experience with other Cantillons I've had. Very good cold/cool, but they turn into simply amazing with a little bit of warmth. Too hard to wait for them to warm up from the start for me (can't wait to dig in), but definitely worth it...although discovering new aspects as the temperature changes has something to say for it too."
"D- Fairly high... prob. one of the most enjoyable sour beers I've ever had."
"Overall awesome, great fruit, tartness, funk, an awesome wild/sour beer with tons of great fruit flavors. Wish I could drink tons of this if it wasn't so expensive and hard to get."
"The nose is pure fucking apricots. Ridiculously fresh and fruity, the dried apricot character is excellent. Not as oaky and tannic as the 2009 vintage, this smells great fresh. Again, a great, clean, lemony sourness with a beautiful fruit character, this is a nice, fruity vintage."
"Wow taste on this is very tart and sour, it's crazy. Even though the sour is so mouth puckering its really tasty and quite drinkable, each sip just makes you want more and more of it. Super dry finish. The '09 had the most fruit flavor as you'd expect, and the '01 was the most sour beer I've ever had, it was crazy. No way you could drink a whole bottle yourself but amazing for a tasting."
"As I admitted to my bartender when I ordered it, I have no idea how to truly properly pronounce this beer's name, let alone attempt to define it. I was just excited to see such a touted lambic on draught in my neck o' the woods. It pours a hazy orange straw with a tall head of deeply longevitous (yeah, I said it...now, if only more people would use it...) white froth. As it died away, lingering on as the worst people tend to, it left some nebulous lacing behind. The smell wafting to me is of banana, peach, funk, flowers (pretty ones, I do believe), and a surprisingly healthy amount of vanilla. It's like brewer's potpourri. The taste doesn't bring this high esteem down any, either. Tart berries; sour peach, apple, and grape; a tiny bit of bitterness; and a slight hint of oak (or some kind o' wood, anyway) round out the puckering flavor profile. So this is a true Belgian lambic, eh? I'm impressed. The body is on the lightest end of the medium sub-spectrum, with a sharp, moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. I may not be able to guzzle this tart monster, but I sure as hell want to. Get some!"
"750ml bottle, 2008 version...The beer pours dark peacy with a much darker center. The head is white, rises about a finger and is gone pretty quickly...The aroma is on the lighter side, light tart fruits, mixed with sourness. Not overpowering in either regard so its balanced giving some of what you look for in a fruit lambic...Holy moses, that's one sour beer. Didn't think it would be that tart from the aroma. Its got a huge tart bite sour, not a mucky horse blanker leather like a lot of Cantillon's. Here you get a lot more of the fruit not sweetness but the actual taste of apricots on the finish. Super balanced and flavorful...The feel is great, sticks to the mouth, very tannic...Drinkability is off the charts. It gives me everything I love about a lambic, sourness funk, but balanced enough that you can drink this all day, while at the same time not being such a fruit beer that's its super sweet or dominated by the apricot...Overall one of my favorite lambics, right up there with Blabear."
"An absolute pleasure to drink and I am quite sad that this is being discontinued. A one time pleasure I guess... Thanks to Luk13 for the bottle in a trade."
"Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and buttery, with great light carbonation. This is a sickeningly sessionable lambic that goes down way too easily."
"Thanks to whoever shared this at the first sexual chocolate release. It was my first time trying this fine lambic. Im very sad to know that this one will soon be retired. :( Hazy bright gold pour with thin fizzy off white head. Apricot aroma. Leather, horse blanket, apricot, and mango. Very tart, dry, crisp and refreshing"
"Appearance is a cloudy, hazy pale straw gold with a thin fizzy white head that leaves minimal lacing. I'll be smelling this beer all night, long after I leave here. Extremely sharp, acidic and funky with mild apricot fruit sweetness and cheesy funk. It's hard to stop smelling this and actually taste it. Flavor starts initially apricot and oak sweet before becoming overwhelmed by acidic and vinegary sweetness which actually finds a way to become even sharper and more nasty funky in the finish. Not for the faint of heart or novice to the style, and maybe not the best bottle to represent this particular beer, but for a complex fruity and sour lambic this is near impeccable."
"J"
"I'm glad I had a chance to try this since I can't seem to find it in bottles in my area. Since the apricots are so subtle, overall this is probably best described as a slightly sweeter version of their Classic Gueuze."
"D: Easily one of my favorite beers (from Cantillon or otherwise). I could drink this stuff all day, and I'm glad to have another bottle."
"Wow! The most tart beer I've ever had! I've had a lot of sours...krieks, gueuzes, lambics...etc. This definitely ""takes the cake"" for the biggest tart factor! Very impressed though overall with the flavor. Besides the rediculous amount of puckering tart, theres really no apricot noticeable anymore...not that it hurts the flavor one bit IMO. The HUGE funkiness comes in after a couple seconds and has a long lasting aftertaste. Leaves a sweet and enjoyable flavor on the lips for a few minutes as well. High carbonation, tart, lemon/citrus, light body. As the beer warms up, the funkiness really comes in even bigger! Wow, what an extrordinary...off the wall beer!"
"D- extremely. I can easily do a few of these. But they ran out shortly after. 5.0"
"Razor-blade-like cutting sour notes on the palate. Dry and prickly, and almost needle-like. Dusty hay, funky, fruity, and absolutely delightful. Try it if you ever have the chance."
"Slight sulfur, tastes kind of like flowers. I'm not picking up on the fruit so much. Its pretty sour. I think it smells better than it tastes. Overall drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good as well."
"Deliciously mouth puckering. Great sour middle and finish so fruity and delicious. Apricot really takes the lead with oak later on. Good acidity levels and perfect carbonation. Not nearly as thin as majority of sours out there and it really helps that out. But hell it is cantillon. Little heart burn kicking in from the acidity and funky undertones. Could drink this for hours on end."
"D: Very nice drinkability, although anything over 10oz. or so might get to be a little much. Overall, absolutely fantastic. In my opinion, blew Saint Lamnivus (which we had side-by-side) out of the water."
"Overall a very good beer, but it just was a bit too much on the fruit for me. Still very glad I tried it."
"Overall I really like this beer, although it's not quite as impressive as some other Cantillon offerings."
"D: fairly easy to drink, this is definitely more of a summer beer. Not the most impressive beer from Cantillon but still very tasty. A little more expensive than I'd like but a nice beer. Glad to try it."
"Bottle: Poured a pale hazy yellow color lambic with a huge pure white foamy head with good retention and some great retention. Aroma of sour and tart notes are dominant and somewhat off-set by some light fruity apricot. Taste is a wonderful mix between some light apricot, some tart and sour notes with some well balanced acidity. Body is quite full with great carbonation. Very well made with a great balance between some tart notes with some fruit and well balanced acidity."
"This may well me my favourite fruit lambic - it transports me to a different place and whispers softly in my ear. A treat that I need to get more of!"
"Drinkability: High, this is now one of my favorite cantillons, right behind Blaeber"
"This glass is disappearing quickly, but the overall palate and sense destroying nature of it would make me want to limit my intake. Still, seriously drinkable for the style."
"D: Really enjoying this one but it is a sipper."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, tart, making one salivate...but easy drinking and perhaps even refreshing if given the proper setting."
"D: Pretty impressive offering from Cantillon. The flavor really carries the day despite some flaws in the mouthfeel department."
"Overall I found this beer to be an excellent pairing with monks pomme frites."
"Odd, and not altogether enjoyable beer. I would run back to the Rose de Gambrinus, St. Lamvinus, Iris, or Blabaer before hitting this one up again."
"D: Good, this one was served in a small proper cantillon glass. I could easily sit back and enjoy an entire bottle though. One of my favorite sours."
"I'll definitely be buying some of these bottles to throw in the basement. Outstanding."
"D: A great beer that is best shared with others but I will enjoy a few glasses for myself. A few more years on this beer will do wonders"
"The beer is light and crisp with a nice dry finish that makes it incredibly drinkable. The flavor is sharply sour, but the finish is dry and compliments the flavors well."
"This was another wonderful beer from Cantillon. They are still one of the top breweries in the world, in my opinion."
"D - Not my favorite from Cantillon, but I do like this to change it up every now and then. Looking forward to trying the 2009 release here soon."
"D: This goes down too quickly, and should be savored."
"D - Cantillon makes some bad ass Lambics and this one is no exception this is what a real fruit Lambic tastes like worth getting your hands on to try"
"D: I've had this beer once before, but I was still amazed over how sour it is. By far one of the most sour beers I've tried. All in all, it's a great beer - wonderful fruity character and intense rustic flavors."
"Drinkability is great. Truly sour, but very tasty. The acidic notes are balanced by a healthy dose of funk, all under a light fruit banner. Only a Cantillon brew can reach the level of something this complex, yet so drinkable. Cheers!"
"Another wonderful Lambic from Cantillon. This is what a fruit Lambic should be. Not artificial flavor and syrup that so many other examples are. Highly recommended. I have to give a big thanks to biggreen for sharing this with armock and me."
"I await with interest what they are going to try next?"
"D: Glorious torture. It is insane how your throat collapses. Amazing beer. Cantillon is nothing short of an amazing world class brewery. If you see their beer you buy it."
"Crisp body is delicately carbonated with a nice dry finish. Another amazing lambic from Cantillon."
"Overall, yup...after this I am loading up on a few bottles for my cellar. It's amazing how people go nuts over the new rarest sours, yet forget about Cantillon. They easily make the best and most consistent sours in the world. If your a sourhead and have been following all the hype behind American sours, do yourself a favor and pick this up. It'll make you forget all about trading for $30 sours from Lost Abbey."
"Pours a lightly hazy orange/golden, very thin and fizzy white head forms, disappears to a tiny ring, no lacing, looks like a lambic! Smell is real nice, definite funk, lemons, wood, apricots, peaches, vinegar, quite acidic in the nose, some bready malts, nice. Taste is similar, sharp and acidic at first, sweet sour middle, like those old school peach candies, apricot is subtle but there, peaches, lemons, lightly woody, nice vinegar and acetic finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very drinkable. Another great lambic!"
"Pours a light... apricot... color, a cloudy yellow-orange with a relatively sparse, but dense head. Aroma is an immediate signature Cantillon sour yeast element, but ripe fresh apricots are blended beautifully into this one. The sour lemony acetic quality of the lambic is divine paired with the apricots in this. A joy to inahale. The taste is a blast of the sourness I adore from Cantillon paired with a complex fruitiness. What is biting into a fresh lemon at one moment tastes like sour apricots the next moment, or orange zest. If I dare sayso, this is one of the best authentic authentic fruit lambics I have tasted. Body is light, with tight medium carbonatioon that leaves me puckered. As sour as this is, the fruit really enhances everything from aroma to drinkability. Lasting tart apricot finish keeps me going back for another sip. Exceptional."
"Light, refreshing and has a great sour aftertaste. Very nice beer for it's style... Cantillon makes great beer."
"feel is crisp and acidic, but just slightly thin. carbonation is quite mild. keep in mind that we had to let this sit for nearly ten minutes to warm up."
"D. Acidic and sour but and easy drink on the patio on a hot day."
"D - Not something I'd drink heaps of but something I'd want to have on hand every now and then."
"Tap at toro 1st annv. Must of been a half barrel as it's lasted a couple days. Very excited to try because i just bought a bottle and wanted to see how long to age it. I'd say 2-3 years in bottle will be perfect. Had next to beatification batch 2, which was much more sour, and it was great to go back and forth between the 2. Apricots come thru but only when it warmed up and on the super long finish. A femenin brew but personaly i enjoyed this cold as it was so refreshing. Too bad it's not available all the time and around $10 for a 750 because it is the perfect summer brew. Very nice and again a pleasure to have a shot at this on draft."
"Light bodied with a medium level of carbonation and a dry, slightly puckering mouthfeel."
"Bracing sourness at first that gives way to a puckering fruity apricot flavor. Dry finish with occasional notes of musty wet barrel, slightly tannic, with succulent apricot pits, stems, and fruit. After getting acclimated to the fairly intense sourness, this was an absolute dream. Excuse me while I polish off the bottle..."
"Had this immediately after having an Upland Blueberry. No comparison. This place is still far and away better at producing any kind of fruit lambics than anything here in the states. Plus, this stuff is available here on my local liquor store shelf. Why again am I trading rare beers for sours produced here when this stuff is readily available? A treasure. Pours a slightly hazy golden with the barest head. Glows in the glass. Smells very sour and acetic with some savory/salty notes, and pure, zingy apricot on the finish. The taste is awesome. Sour, salty, and with absolutely vibrant apricot flavors. Tangy and sweet notes with some light funk/barnyard right at the end. Wonderfully blanced and laser like in flavor. The mouthfeel is juicy, clean, and absolutely knife-like in how it cuts through the palate. Delicious, as always. I think this is one of their better lambics. The apricot really lends itself to the style."
"solid beer, get if you can."
"Drinkable beer, a little less biting than some Cantillons such as the kriek."
"D - If you didn't take another sip after the first one, you would swear this is undrinkable. As I said earlier, as it warmed up it really came into its own. I find it really hard not to like anything from Cantillon (not that I'm trying to hate it). Well done again Mr Van Roy! I only wish I had another bottle."
"For a beer with such a strong fruit component, it's just too dry. I am not sure why, but it's a bit offputting."
"Drinkability is astronomical. I had 16 ounces, and felt like I hadn't even gotten a good start. Could have finished an entire bottle and then started on the next."
"The aroma was beautiful. Rich sour funkiness with huge touches of apricot mixed in. Light peppery and spice notes come through as it warms, but the sour funk was so hardcore. The flavor was puckeringly good. Rich apricot and apple vinegar sour notes are all over this one. As it warms like barrel notes, lots of spice and a long drawn out and very dry. Super drinkable and very refreshing, this was one of the best sours I have had. Worth the wait."
"Drinkability: after having a few ounces of this the sourness became less shocking and more pleasant. But after completing the glass over a long period I had enough for the session."
"For a lambic and its funkiness this drinks incredibly well. I will most likely seek this out whenever possible."
"D: If you're craving sour, this does the trick. Worth every one of the $25 it costs. Extremely sour but easily drinkable for someone versed in lambics. Would buy again."
"8/4/9/5/16 (4.2/5)"
"I think the apricot sweetness would disappear completely with any additional age put on this one. But the sharpness and dryness would continue to develop. Its already fairly sharp and dry so who knows what extremes it could reach! Definitely not a low class sweet fruit lambic. This is a winner."
"Drinkability- This about pushed my limits of sourness. It tore up my stomach as well. Only for the people who can tolerate extreme amounts of citric acid. Tasted just fine, but hard to complete an entire bottle for me at least."
"Wow, this is a seriously funky and acidic lambic that is pretty harsh on the taste buds. Very tasty stuff."
"had this on tap at Zwanze day and had to bump up the taste score. This stuff is really great."
"Amazingly drinkable, would love to have this consistently, especially in the summer."
"2011: Fresh, this one is less fruity and slightly more sour than the previous two vintages. Not as interesting to me as the '09 and '10 batches. Still very good."
"D: Honestly, as awesome as this brew is; one and done."
"Poured into an Eb's snifter a pale yellow with some slight haze and a thin, quickly dissapating head. Aroma is definite Cantillon tart, sour fruit with some definite funk in there. FLavor is of the tartest apricots I could ever imagine. THis one is one of the most puckering beers I have ever tried. Very dry and refreshing, though. One is an experience. Interesting and very good lambic."
"Pours a nice clean yellow/light orangey color with a slim stark white head. Nose is pure cantillon lambic funk with some slight fruit. Taste follows with a very present apricot flavor hidden behind a wonderful blanket of tart barnyard funk. Really impressed with the noticeable apricot in here. Mouthfeel is uber dry and super tart. Drinkability is very fine for the style. Overall, this is defenitely one of my favorite brews from Cantillon. A very good offering, I just wish the goddamn price was a little nicer. Very good lambic, strongly recommended for all the sour heads out there. Great."
"Still, one of my favorite Cantillon beers. How I need to get some more bottles! I'm also wavering between a 4.5 and 5 for flavor - I think a fresh bottle might bump the taste score to that elusive 5."
"Pucker up!!!"
"Drinkablity is precious, if you've come this far and shelled out the dough ($30 in my town) then you'll probably wish you'd be able to drink another bottle. Chances are, you can't. I'm saving the dregs for homebrew. If I come close, I'll drink it all day long, albeit not terribly quickly. This is as sour as it gets! A special vintage bottling indeed."
"Popped the cork on this bottle to find out that it was from early 2006. Poured this one into a Cantillon glass to a bright golden color similar to what you would get in a pilsner with a small white head that dissipates after about a minute to just cover the top of the beer. The smell is quite exceptional with a slight funk fading into a great apricot sweetness, almost exactly what I expected it to be. The flavor of this beer was even better than the aroma. Right up front you get a great dryness that quickly fades into a mouth puckering sourness. This eventually turns tart and the after taste gives you the apricot sweetness. The mouthfeel is quite full considering the beers color with lively carbonation. This beer is a pleasure to drink and a geueze/lambic that would please connoisseurs and novices alike. Although the price was a bit high, this was well worth it."
"A wonderful fruit lambic with some of the most intense sour flavors I've ever had in a beer. This may be Cantillon's sourest. Dope."
"D: 1 bomber is plenty for anyone i would guess. really extreme flavor and smoothing sourness. Price is a little steep to justify."
"75 cl bottle. The beer poured a hazy golden, cloudy body with a slight head on the first pour. The second pour gave a much thicker head. The nose was fantastic with solid earthy funky notes. The taste was also funky and earthy but nicely sweet with a touch of acid on the backend. Overall a fantastic beer, another one from Cantillon."
"not a pedestrian beer, full flavored and what one would expect. if you like this style you will like the fou' foune it is exceptional."
"I generally like my lambics straight-up, no fruits or sugars. But I'll make an exception for this one, this is great."
"D = Very drinkable."
"D: A wonderful sipping lambic, with a bold tartness in aroma and flavor and long-lasting memorable mouthfeel. A little like a quenching, pucker-inducing lemonade, ideal for a summery day. Low ABV at 5%, but this isn't really a style you'd want to drink much of. Expensive ($6 for this pour) but worth it, and one I'd love to have again. Recommended!"
"Sour! Apricot. Looks, smells, and tastes like an apricot. Kinda peachy too. Nice head, ample carbonation, sourness mellows as it warms and the palate becomes used to it. Spicy aromatically. Soupy and peppery. Clean. Nostrils even feel the funk. Palte burns somewhat. Lingeringly sour but it also hits the front lip. This is a serious beer. Wonderful. Served on tap during Pucker Fest at Belmont Station in Portland, OR."
"Another fantastic Cantillon beer. It needs more funk and depth to be among the best. Still is ethereal stuff."
"D: Complex with great balance. Apricot really comes through as it warms, teases the palate leaving you wanting more."
"On the palate the apricot is there but again subtly integrated into the gorgeously tart and crisp lambic backbone. Bone-dry as we expect from the real lambic makers; very refreshing and drinkable, complements food wonderfully...some of the best brewing art on the planet. Lowish lambic ABVs are a plus for drinakbility in my book. Stirring some yeast into the final pours intensified and added more yeasty notes...I recommend trying it. If any beer is worth more than $20/750ml, this is one. I just bought more. I want to move to Brussels."
"Overall: A nice balance between sourness and fruity and funky flavors."
"I had this on tap at the Map Room in Chicago, poured into a Cantillon glass. It was on my top 3 list to try when I saw their draft list (where else in the Midwest would I find this beer on tap?). It was kind of light yellow colored, hazy, and initially had a huge head. The smell was sour and acidic with a hint of citrucy fruit. The taste was sour and tart with a very mild apricot flavor. It was awesome. I could have easily had more, but there were other beers to try."
"A treat to experience on tap @ Spuyten D. in Bklyn. as part of their Yeast fest of a week ago. Pours soft, cloudy tangerine, with a minimal off white head, with minor lacing. Funky, fruity nose. Moderatly sour brew with a slight nod in the flavor profile to the adertised apricots. Long lasting sour/bret notes linger and linger in the mouth. Pleasantly sour and soft. Very tasty stuff, delicate and complex on tap. World class lambic, go get some."
"Poured into a flute. Pours a hazy straw color with a head that settles down to a film. Smells like the normal lambic brett funk. Taste has crisp lambic tartness. The apricots used in making this are hardly tasted in the beginning but get a little stronger towards the end. Very good effervescent mouthfeel. Another very drinkable lambic from cantillon."
"I drink cantillon products all the time and have never had anything like this. No idea if it is a temporary gastrointestinal problem on my part (comment 4/28/06, it was almost certainly a beer issue) but there are no other indications that it is anything but the beer."
"Drinkability: This beer was difficult for me to drink at times and hard to put down at others. I will definately give this one another try later."
"Apricot colored liquid below a small, slowing forming head. Initially bright and vibrant fruit aroma of apricot and peach, which becomes less apparent as the bottle nears final consumption. Other aromatic Cantillon lambic qualities are also present, but in a subtle way. Unbelievably harsh citric acid flavor, with very little character besides an extreme amount of sourness. This is an unbelievably intense lambic, probably the most sour lambic ever. Its so strange, because I adore the three year old Grand Cru, but that beer has so much more depth and character, besides the sourness. This is just cutting, with very little fruit character."
" The flavor is awesome. Fruit flavors of oranges, peaches, and apricots. Then, the dirt, the dust, the must, and the funk. This is amazing. The mouthfeel is puckering, to say the least. As always with Cantillon lambics, drinkability depends on whether you like sour beers or not. I love em, and this is one of my favorites."
"Taste: If it were any more acidic than this, it would puncture your stomach. But the fruit shines beautifully once again, showing oranges, tangerines, peaches and a little passion fruit. Finish is sharp and dry, but with a very long tongue flipping aftermath. The drinkability of this elixir was strongly debated amongst those who were kind enough to share it with me, and as usual concensus was not achieved. I was on the ""yes"" side, because I already dusted off a 750 by myself in Brussels, however I didn't enjoy the bottle I had at Delirium Café as much as this one. But I agree with the fact that this isn't for everyone. I'm not saying this to pass off as a snob, I'm just saying that there isn't enough Pepsid AC, Rolaids or Tums on earth to cure what this Beer would do to anyone with ulsers or acid reflux."
"Thanks once again to Stonecrusher for the continued education."
"Drinkability/notes: Like blue cheese, most definately an acquired taste, but once acquired, there is a profound attraction. A beer and a style that must not be missed. A friend commented that is very much like a Brut Champagne. Discarding one's preconcieved notions of beer is the best way to experience a lambic for the first time."
"Pours a golden color, with a slight tint of orange, a fizzy head, and a negligible haze. The aroma is pretty funky: apricot is notable right off the bat, followed by a grassiness, horseblanket, musty earth, wood, and a serious vinousness. The first taste is a powerful, mouth-pckering, roll-up-your tongue, wrinkle-your-face sourness. Lots of acid. This lambic sure isnt sweetened. After the first few sips, and your mouth is prepared, a lot of funkly, fruity flavors come out. The apricot hides, and I could only pick it out as a faint effect of the finish. The musty, horse flavor is present through the taste. This is an extremely dry, extremely astringent brew. Theres a high level of carbonation. Pretty much no hop flavors at all. This is one sour, but subtle beer. The more I drank, the more it grew on me. I wouldnt drink it on its own againbut I think it would be fantastic with food. The beer would go great with some intensely rich foods (I kept thinking that this would be great with oysters Rockefeller)."
"This beer came a hefe-like cloudy orange and gold with a thin creamy head. Smelled powerfully of apricots and a crazy wild yeast. The pungent smell reminded me of black earth and turned milk in the Russian River Supplication sort of sense. Im guessing there are a lot of strange bacteria at work here forming this beer into something very unique. Tastes of powerfully sour nectarines, oranges and raspberries. The flavor is so intense, its hard to identify just what fruits were used here. It nearly tastes like vinegar its so tough. Theres also a sour milk flavor here as well. Fortunately, theres a creamy apricot in the finish. Wow. When the waitress said its very sour she wasnt kidding. The mouth feel is thick and the sourness really puckers the mouth quite a bit. However, if you drink this slowly, you just may enjoy it."
"BB 12-20-20. Not much head due to hardly any carbonation. Beer is deep golden and very hazy. Nose is heavy messed in with dusty barn, horsesweat, oaknotes, cheese and IMO overdone and litle sewer like. Not bad but for me just too much. As is taste that is oversoured edgy and unbalanced. Some oaknotes in the back and dry but this sourness is just too much and think this one needs many years to get for me to an acceptable and balanced taste. Who knows but another one I have is put all the way back into my cellar. Drinkable but very rough IMO."
"D - This was surprisingly easy drinking. Not that I would ever want to drink this when I wanted a beer, it was an ok one time experience."
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer right here is exactly why I love lambics/gueuzes so much. The sourness!!! The tart flavor is almost unbearable, but not quite, and it makes this beer damn near perfect. One of the best Fruit Lambics I've had to date. If you love to sour, funky flavors, you'll love this to death."
"This may be for some...but it certainly was not for me, or the three others that helped me drink this bottle. None of us were impressed in the least."
"at $28 a bottle this isnt something I wouold go for everyday but this is one of those beers out there on the ledge of what beer can be. (beer all you can be). I found it easy to drink after the initial blast. This beer is one to drink for hours, the smell, the look, the crazy flavor can keep you talking all damn day. This certainly is not for everyone in any way shape or form but damn I gotta give props to Cantillon for producing something so amazingly original and hard to really describe till you experience this beer. I guess that is the point after all, you need to ""experience"" this beer if you like non fruity lambics. I personally prefer the Organic Geuze just for sheer drinkability but I wouldn't be adverse to picking this up again sometime down the road just to be reminded of how amazingly out there this brew is... WOW..."
"I've had this more than a few times at Monk's and I must say I enjoy it each and every time. Although the kreik is more robust, and stands to lend more flavor, this is still a real treat. The beer is a murky yellow tan color with high carbonation and no head. The smell is unmistakeably Cantillon; as the lambic base and its sharp acidity sting the nostrils. Once sipped, the fresh apricot flavor comes through, but when paired with the lambic it falls a bit flat, and really can't hold its own. I like the weeds, the musty flavor imparted by the Brett, even the way in which the fruit lends a slight sweetness and a bit of a foil to the uncompromising sourness. Make no mistake, this aint some US fruit beer. This is unabashedly raw and I love it. A great one to try."
"This beer poured a very cloudy/hazy/milky peach gold color and formed a small bubbly snow white head that disappeared quickly and left no lace. A small amount of carbonation is present in the murkiness. The aroma is definate lambic with barnyard elements and grass masking a suttle peach aspect. The flavor was the powerful presence of lambic sweet/sour brought crashing in by the definate astrigent nature of the body and finish. All and all a refreshing lambic for a relaxing afternoon."
"On tap the the Sunset Grill, only 5$! Calm headless amber hue shows orange-red hints. Aroma is enticing and funky with strong horsey, sweaty and barnyardy component. It definitely has a sweet connotation, honey-like blended with the horsey fruits (apricot, orange, pink grapefruit). Yep, this is a lambic, very fruity, limey, citric, lactic and funky. Yet, its aggressiveness is rather limited in mouth. Its tart of course, but pretty mellowed out. I assume the bottles are far more authentic in that regard, here, the mouthfeel is so lightly carbonated that it feels a bit lifeless. I wish I had an explanation for the name though! (Foufoune means buns in the sense of bottom or behind)"
"Taste is of apricots. Sour, tart. Typical Cantillon, which is always a good change of pace. Not acidic. In regards to mouthfeel, this could use more carbonation. But hey, you get what you get with spontaneity, if you know what I mean."
"Other comments: Holy crap this one's sour! Of course, Cantillons are typically sour, but this is outrageous! Can give you heartburn or acid reflux if you drink too much of it. Couldn't get through the entire 750ml by myself, so I'm going to use part of it to make dressing."
"D-This is one hard beer to drink. I finished my whole glass but I won't be getting this one again."
"Pours a light golden peachy color with a slight minimal white head that leaves no lace. Initial aromas are pungent and citric, with just a slight hint of fruit and some of those classic barnyard aromas. For flavor this brew is crisp and delightful. There is a beautiful balance between the sourness and a slight sweet fruity like flavor that can best be described as a citrusy lemonade.. Following there is a nice bite of tartness to the brew, and a refreshing carbonation. Overall this brew is highly drinkable, though I would never think that Cantillon would use apricots in a beer, but hell it works."
"Picked this up at Smokeless Joe in Toronto. Pours a lovely hazy peach colour with a white head that doesn't stick around for long. Smell was very pungent, very sour yeasty smell, but similar to the other Cantillon I tried. Taste was a tart if not downright sour apricot that was very dry. It was a very mouth-puckering mouthfeel that dries out the mouth. All these comments sound rather negative, but I really liked the taste, it makes you feel alive, and in my case, more sober for the long walk home. I would recommend this as it is a very good example of a Lambic, like it ot hate it."
"I can't rate this one too highly, it just wasn't something I can see drinking all the time. But don't let that discourage you, you might enjoy it much more. Heck 6 months ago I couldn't stand IPAs and now I love them."
"75 cl cork dated 2/2002. Glowing peachy golden color with a carefully poured cream colored head. Yeasty barnyard funk aromas as well as some fuzzy subdued apricot/peach aromas. It is really a culmination of those fruits that have fuzzy skin, like peaches, apricots and kumquats. Some would debate, but only domestic, Belgian apricots are only used in this brew, and it takes on aspects of all fuzzy-skinned fruits. It has a barnyard, wet-dog funk to it not unlike other quality lambics. Quite leathery and earthy. Really hits the sour portions of the tastebuds. Once again Cantillon delivers. Predominant taste is of tannins of unripened apricot skins. Rather acrid, yet wholly enjoyable for lambic lovers everywhere. Just make sure you drink within it's window of oppurtunity when fresh fruit is in it's character. Other unfruited lambics stay longer and are better aged."
"Peachy color. Light peach. Thin and fluffy white head sits on top and is well retained. Lacing comes in patches. Carbonation looks to be moderate.Aroma is acidic, citric, estery, vinegar-like and fruity (as in green apples and nectarines). A little wet blanket on the nose as well. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly and more than slightly puckering. Not quite as mouth puckering as some of the other Cantillon selections I've had though. This one is held in check somewhat. It's pretty refreshing. The horse blanket is there. And the acidity is definitely there. Very slight apricot. Grape skin and unripe green apple. Nicely put together. Somthing keeps begging me to drink more of it. That's a good sign."
"A slightly cloudy pink/orange pour with a typically small head. The nose was big on tart, sour fruitiness. Huge tang up front and tartness that hits you like a cold bucket of water. Lemony notes and very big lime bitterness along with vinegar notes that make you pucker up! The fruitiness is very toned down. A pinch of apricot but burried beneath all of the acidity and tartness. Some light earthy notes and fresh grassy layers. Nice acidity although not to the degree of the gueze for example. For me this is a great beer for a starter or even a night cap. The perfect summer beer. I absolutely loved it."
"The first I have had of this type. Extremely sour, like vinegar. Even in the aroma.Recent arrival at Smokeless Joe's. Bartender insisted this was it, not on way to the skunk. Good I split it with a friend and could have done so with three other friends. After first acid bite on mouth (which I still feel 7 hours later), it grows on you. Like a highly acidic apple. A bit of apricot aroma but we tasted nothing sweet or fruity. Yeast but overpowered. Must have with food."
"Fou' Foune is refreshing in the way that Cantillon lambics tend to be. A fantastic beer that ought to be experienced by lambic fans."
"This lambic comes from the last traditional brewer in Brussels. The beer is aged for two years in wooden casks, and apricots are added, which produces a bright orange color. The head retention is high from the use of wheat that helps accent its color. The aroma gives the impression that this beer is going to be sour, which is the case for lambics especially from this brewer. At first, the beer almost puckers the mouth, but you are rewarded for continuing. The apricot flavor is soft and subtle amid the complexity of a wood aged lambic. It is almost syrupy and coats the tongue well."
"ng"
"Jean Pierre Van Roy is simply one of the best brewers in Belgium, and the world! Cheers to you sir!"
"Mouthfeel is fine and soft. A challenging beer, and not recommended for the novice lambic drinker, but I enjoyed it. And that nose!"
"Ive been mesmerized by the Fou foune label for the past two months. Its perhaps the most dignified and artistic label Ive even viewed, and to boot its a little bit funky, just like this beer (I had some second thoughts calling this a beer). The beer is a cloudy orange copper and looks amazing in my flute. A thin layer of foam formed across the top. It smells like most lambics. The first sip begins mellow and then its tartness expands to its full potential. My cheeks puckered a little before the fruity apricot aftertaste filled my throat. Man the aftertaste is refreshing. The funk is sour, yet not overbearing, and adds some zest and zing every step of the way (hints of lemon, apricots, and of course yeast). I wonder if the Belgiums enjoy a cube of sugar is this fine offering? Anyway, this was a new experience for my in terms of lambics and highly memorable."
"A orangish light gold color to this beer, that is more light gold than anything. Pours with a lively carbonation. I can't detect any apricot in the aroma, though there is a slight fruitiness, but mostly smell sour. The taste is of course quite acidic, with general musty character as well. If I did not know this beer I would have no idea that it was made with apricots. The lambic beasties have completely obliterated all signs of the apricots. As a lambic type beer this is quite good, though seems a bit simplistic compared to some of the other offerings. Tastes more of a citrus type fruit, which comes from the acidity. I am a bit dissapointed in the apricot character from this beer, but it is still quite good."
"The body is a hazy, glowing yellow with a peach cast. The creamy, bright-white head holds well at first and slowly drops to a thin collar and whispy surface foam. Sweet apricot is present in the first whiff, but it reveals it's seductively intense and complex lambic character upon closer inspection. The sweetness of the fruit is squelched in the flavor, although there is definite apricot character. The sweetness appears right at the start, but immediately vanishes as it's overtaken by a sharp, drying acidity that retains control until the swallow where lambic character lingers in the finish along with more fruit. Quite exceptional. Intense. Complex. Refreshing."
"This is Cantillon  The Lambic Master. We are truly NOT Worthy!!!"
"Very good. Hints of sweetness, due to the apricot, well balanced with a sour, dry, acidic finish, very refreshing brew. Quite complex, with hints of apricots, oak, lemon, sour yeast. Just another great brew from cantillon."
