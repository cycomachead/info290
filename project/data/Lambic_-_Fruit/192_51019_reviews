"Not a huge fan of fruity beers but not bad for a Lambic. Started sour and finished sweet and not too bubbly on the mouth-feel. A drinkable Kriek but most likely a one time deal."

"Delicious sour tasting beer with a red hue. very tasty."

"This is for the 2015 version, while the look was pleasing and different, the smell was nice. The taste was weird; trying to have the sour taste of La Follie (spelling might be off), it also attempted to have the taste of wine, which kind of threw me. The feel was thin and hard on the tongue. Overall, I gave it a 3.75. I would not buy it again though."
""
""
"overall: very nice though nothing to knock your socks off."
""
"The tastes of both the golden ale and the Kriek are both recognizable.  A little more tart would be better. Very drinkable"
"Overall, this is mediocre.  An uninteresting one note lambic that is not worth trying."
""
""
""
"Nice, tart, cherry aroma.  Blandish flavor.  Dry with just hints of cherries.  Spicy aftertaste."
""
"Disappointing taste. Medicinal and not in that good lambic, aged way. Faint nose. The finish is empty. This is a soulless encapsulation of capitalism and other pretentious, completely unrelated beer things."
""
"2015 version with Oud Beersel.  Tastes like New Belgium got all of the leftover Oud Beersel lambic barrels that were unblendable, racked them onto some old sweaty gym socks for a few months, pasteurized, then spiked with Robitussin cough syrup at bottling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This brew isn't screaming anything to me! It's not adventurous not taking you to a new level of lambic goodness. It's like someone put watered down sour cherry flavored syrup into a bottle of Steel Reserve. Hey, atleast Steel is a hell of a lot cheaper than this swill and doesn't proclaim to be ""craft"" beer. Mediocre at best. I cannot recommend this brew."
""
""
""
"Tart cherry in aroma and flavor, though the consensus is it could be more tart."
""
"Disappointingly tasteless. Slight cherry-ish taste. Faint nose.  Unsatisifying ending."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall:  pretty good Kriek.  Nothing in your face.  Great gateway sour.  I like it quite a bit.  Not love it."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Westy chalice a very nice clean/clear light ruby red color, very nice carbonation, with a pretty nice white fizzy head, leaves some nice small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is tart, kinda yeasty. The taste is pretty nice, tart, some cherry notes. Medium body, at 8% ABV it is hidden very very very well, with a slight dry finish. Overall a tasty brew. It's been awhile since I've had a lambic/kriek brew, just might buy it again, even if it's for the cool looking color."

" The taste is very nice with fruit in the intial taste with semi-tart cherry quality with a light malt flavor which is slightly sweet with a mild sour flavor of yeast in the finish which is pleasantly dry ...the cherry has a fresh flavor without any harsh acidity and flavor is slightly sweet but not cloying and malt body is mostly dry which balances the fruit with a slight bready flavor. Overall this is a very decent fruit beer not as intense as expected considering the collaborator yet it is very drinkable and would definitely enjoy this again."

"This is a fun beer to drink. It's got a lot to make you ponder. But its flavors don't quite do the trick. 3.75"

"Clear dark cherry red pour with a one-finger pink head. Sour aroma of cherries and cranberries. Initial taste has a strong cherry flavor that is more sweet than sour. Light bodied. Tartness starts to come out a bit more as the beer warms for a nice fruity lambic taste. Finishes dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Transatlantique Kriek pours a red color with a nice large lacing pink head.  There is a sour, and crisp malty aroma.  The taste has a nice sweet lighter Belgian candy flavor, crisp, and some cherry flavors.  Nice body, nice flavors.  Overall its a nice beer, nice but not overpowering fruit flavors, good crisp backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overal: Fairly one dimensional but still tasty. While that alcohol is masked well, I'm not sure why this needed to be 8%. I think for what it is it would have worked much better in the 5% range. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad I tried it, but in the future, If I want a similar drinking experience to this, I'd rather just drink straight Boon kriek."

"O: Nice attempt by an American brewery at a Belgian classic. My first lambic from the USA. It feels midway between a dry lambic like Cantillons, and a sweetened version like Lindemans. Got in Raleigh Wholefoods, drank in Clyde, NC."
"This was a pleasure to share with friends. The 8% abv was hidden as this drinks so easily."
""
"Pours dark red with pink 2 finger head that doesn't stick around too long. Sour cherry dominates the nose as expected. Sour notes are definitely there. Initial taste is.... All over. Sweet cherry, sour cherry, and some earthy notes, maybe leather. I like. Mouthfeel is full, creamy even with a pretty low carbonation on it. Overall it's a solid kreik. It tastes like it should in my opinion and is right there with the any straight Belgian kreik I've ever had."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Lambic. Good fruity notes with a balanced tartness and sweetness."
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful translucent cranberry red with a luscious pink head. The nose is distinctly Cherry with floral notes. The mouth feel is active and rich, due to nice carbonation. There is a nice Cherry taste upfront, that isn't too sweet or artificial tasting. The end taste is moderately sour, but not mouth puckering. Overall, I thought this was a nice brew and a great way to end a meal."
""
""
"Bottle share at Proof. Looks like carbonated cranberry juice: light pink head, thin collar. Aroma is of cherry, lemon zest and a light tart funk. Taste is dry, tart cherry, a hint of lemon and cranberry? Light body, low carbonation. I wish this had more of a carbonated bite, or something to play with the tartness of the cherry/lemon."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear red with a pink head. Very fruit beer-esqe. Nose is antiseptic with mild cherries. Flavor is extremely dry. Extremely. Strong cherry tone. Medicinal funk. It's bone dry though; that being the main thing you notice here. A very good and ""old world"" beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fairly edgy, tart, and somewhat complex kriek ale, the cherry definitely in charge, but it seems to have a multiple personality disorder, as it wafts from fruity, to woody, to yeasty in its impression. Not an overly bad thing, but it makes the blend appear to not really be working. Something interesting to sip on in the nice Front Range autumn sunshine, so I'm glad I got to try it here, as the retail bottle price seems a bit steep, from what I've heard."

" Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 5/21/14. Bought locally in Austin at Spec's."
""
"All the components of a classic kriek are here yet, nothing really pops. Somewhat mediocre."
""
""
""
"Bottle from Tipples. Pours bright ruby reddish almost fuscoa purple with a pretty pink head that fizzes out after about a minute. Aroma is dry wheat malt, sweet maraschino cherries, not a lot more here but pleasant enough. Flavor has no real sourness expected from the style, but not medicinal. Light tartness if I look hard for it. Seems like an amped up Sam Adams cherry wheat. Cherry juice and malt are dominant with almost a bit of a lager taste to it. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly slick, with low plus carbonation. Not an unpleasant or offensive beer by any means, but it's hard to believe that the same brewery made both this am La Folie."
"O: A good looking brew but just not 100% there in the taste. Its just missing that funk that makes a good lambic great and a kriek jump out and smack you in the face. This is definitely fruity but has that sour beer, Brett funk that could make it a great beer rather than a different and unique brew, which it is just not anywhere near other American wilds or Belgian Sours."
"I enjoyed this sour overall. It's a great layer of flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, not bad but much better beers out there. It kind of falls off in the middle of the drink and then come back in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As some other reviewers have asked, I have no idea where the bad reviews are coming from...the label says Kriek, it's a Belgian sour beer. Is this typical New Belgium? Nope. Is it a proper rendering of the Belgian Kriek style? Absolutely. So it's pricey...so are most really good Belgians. As far as I am concerned this is a PHENOMENAL beer. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: No one at the tasting was really impressed with this mismatched brew. We had the La Folie afterwards and really liked it. But the Transatlantic is a ""miss."""

"O-base of this beer just doesn't come through for me, the cherry flavor is actually decent, but sweetness comes through and no base makes this miss for me"
""
""
"Pours out a brilliant, clear red with a light pink head. Smells of fruit ""country"" wine, cherries, and grain. Malt body is a bit grainy, but the flavor of fermented cherry is great. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Sweet up front, but tart and dry in the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate in body with some prickly carbonation. I'm loving this beer, and I'm having a hard time figuring out the low ratings. Are people expecting sweet cherry bullshit Lindemans?"
"I've never been one for looks if it tastes good. This beer honestly poors like cranberry juice with a pink head. It's unusual. I had this beer early on, when I was just beginning to like beer and it was off-putting. But I saw a bottle and I hadn't seen it for a while so I tried it. Wow! Now that I'm used to beers being tart, I am just again pleased with New Belgium. It's not too tart but it definitely scratches the itch for one. The cherry flavor is a complement, not overpowering. Extremely pleased and a little surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wishing for more tartness and cherry character. Not one I'd revisit."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle to flute glass. Intense red in color with a quickly dissipating pinkish foam. Pleasent aroma of cherry gives way to a light bodied tingly efervecense and a rubbish dryness to wrap it all up, sadly the taste leaves much to desire since it' s almost nonexistent."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this one. Pink, bubbly foam head, both large bubbles and smaller ones. Ruby red body - darkish pink. I loved the smell - tart cranberries, sour cherries, a little sour apples, little balsamic oak-iness, cherry pie, definitely fruity. Taste followed the noise though in a subtler less sour manner than expected. Fruity for sure with slight funk notes (though maybe I was reaching), quite sweet though I wouldn't say overtly artificial like other reviews have but really quite fruity - not syruppy in either flavour or mouthfeel - which was medium and smooth, I think I would have wanted the carbonation a little tighter. All in all I really enjoyed this beer, definitely light on the sour, more sweet and gentle tart fruit notes but really enjoyable."

"22 ounce bottle into globe glass, bottled on 1/2/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear pale ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, cherry skin, apple, pear, grape, hay, light pepper, red wine, vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of cherry, yeast, and funk notes; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, pear, apple, grape, hay, red wine, light pepper, light vinegar, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, cherry skin, pear, apple, grape, red wine, light vinegar, light funk, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of cherry and yeast flavors; with a good sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good fruit lambic style. Good balance and complexity of fruit and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Man, I heard this was not too great, but this is almost offensive (given the price tag of $14 as well). Did they blend the Boon kriek with their Fat Tire amber ale by any chance? None of the curious and rustic aspects of the Lambic come through here - worst off, it just tastes bizarre and reeks of off-flavors. This has to objectively be one of the weirdest and simultaneously mediocre beers I've ever had. I'll be extra careful about trying any of the Lips of Faith beers in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fair attempt. I appreciate the fact that it's not stunningly sweet, like many of the fruit lambics can be, so it redeems an otherwise lackluster beer. Not bad by any means--I didn't have any problem finishing the whole bottle--but I wouldn't exert myself to have it again."

"Pours a ripe ruby red color with a finger of pinkish foam that dissipates quickly. The nose is round ripe cherry pie,vanilla and a touch of wet musty barrel. The palate follows the nose with a nice round cherry front end but the mid to late palate falls quite short with a wet compost funk that comes through slightly muddy destroying the enjoyable cherry notes. Not bad just nothing very special especially based on the price."

"D: This was a mild dessert beer, but the scent and taste and body were all a little disappointing. At least the alcohol was well hidden and the finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. But it wasn't much worth drinking. Not recommended."
""
""
""
""
"I don't care for the style but I keep buying them hoping to find one I like. I'm still looking. This doesn't look or smell like a beer, doesn't take much like one. It's doesn't go down easy. One of these days I'm going to stop buying these damned things."

"Overall a little too light in flavor for the style. If you were just introducing someone to the style this would be okay but falls a little flat compared to other offerings."
""
""
""
""
"I have many great lambics but would not buy this beer again. I do not feel the same way about other beers on the Lips of Faith line, but this one was just not for me. I actually did not finish my beer which is rare. The only use I could make of it would be to cook with it."
""
""
""
""

"Overall meh, very light for a kriek, very light sour and little cherry, some cough syrup flavors too."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours dark red with a half inch light pink head that fizzled away quickly. There's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is light and subtle, the brew smells like tart cherries, bready/grainy malt, and a bit of musty funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some red grapes and a floral flavor noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a little watery with a decent amount of carbonation. I think it's an OK beer overall, but at $16.49 a bottle I won't be buying it again. Should have grabbed another La Folie instead!"
""
""
""
"Overall. I can't help comparing this with the Belle Royale I've been drinking recently. It's like a very watered down version of that beer without the barrel. I guess that's the problem with drinking lots of great beers, the standards rise. Nothing bad tasting, just not big enough flavours in a beer that could be great. I'm going to guess that profit was a factor in this one as far as the amount of ingredients goes. I could be wrong, but that's what it tastes like to me."
""
"D - Just really digging this. Like the balance of ale and cherry and not as overpowering in the ABV, either."
"T: The carbonation here feels way light, and it weighs the flavors down a lot. Thick concord grape, cherry juice and cherry skin flavors. A bit of a cranberry flavor as well. It's definitely not sour, and barely tart. There's some bitter cherry skin on the finish with a wave of smooth grain. It's not terrible, but I wouldn't say it's one of the better Krieks out there."
""
"D: im really enjoying this. more cherry flavor than acidity but again, I am enjoying how this brew came out. cherry pie flavor to the max. if this brew had a bit more acidic, tart nature it would be over-the-top."
"Overall its an average cherry beer. It doesn't have the medicinal flavors that some other Kreik's have but its not that interesting."
""
""
""
"O: Not horrible, but for over $15, I expected more."
""
""
"The beer is transparent and ruby hued with an inch of pinkish purple head. The aroma offers sweet cherry juice, fruit punch, Shirley Temple drinks, very subtle funk. The flavor brings cherries, cherry juice. Lack of funk, wild yeast, personality, complexity, etc. Essentially missing the characteristics that can make drinking kriek a heavenly experience. Alcohol begins to emerge more as the beer warms. While there is some cherry presence, this beer is boring and uneventful. New Belgium should stop cutting corners, mass producing a huge lineup, and get back to focusing on quality. This is the brewery that produced corked and caged La Folie. What happened?!?"
""
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable but offers little in flavor. With a second opinion was described as Natty light with cherries. Dissapointed in the lack of aroma and flavor. Appearance and carbonation were its highlights."
""
"O: Overall I was very happy with this beer. It is a beer that includes cherries and does not taste like cough syrup! I keep comparing it to wine, which is the closest thing this would compare to. It is an ale, however it has enough flavor that I get way more fruit character than beer character. I highly recommend this beer to those looking for a nice mellow kriek, or wine drinkers who are wanting to make the transition to beer."
""
"O- Disappointed with this beer, particularly considering how good the La Folie was by New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wish it was had more acidity and a concentrated cherry flavor. As it stands, it's dull and uninspiring. The color is the most vibrant thing about it. Now that I think about it, it does remind me of a Boon kriek (which it is mixed in with), and has the same candy artificiality. Honestly, my homebrew attempt at a Kriek was better."
"O - New Belgium's Transatlantique Kriek is an excellent entry-level kriek that completely abandons the sugary ""fruit beer"" notion and focuses on engaging real cherry flavor and tartness with very subtle yeast funkiness. It's approachable and enjoyable. So when I say ""entry-level", it means die-hard Belgian kriek fans may find themselves disappointed in the lack of yeast funkiness and sour bite to the finish, but by no means is this anything less than awesome."
""
"Overall: Pleasant and easy drinking but still disappointing; more so after reading the back story on this collaborative kriek."
"O: I enjoyed it, all told, but it was not the special brew for which I'd hoped. Decent lambic. Would not recommend."
""
""
""
"O - I have given New Belgium several chances and they consistently brew beer that makes me say meh. In this instance, the $16 bomber makes me angry. The best thing about this beer is the aroma and the smooth 8% abv."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty nice bottle art, it pours a dark ruby red with purple tinged foam which has receded pretty quickly. Mild carbonation stems from the center of the glass, lacing isn't too bad. Aroma of sour cherry, oak, some grape and a sweet malt. Other dark fruits are there as well, a touch of citrus and strawberry meld well with the alcohol. There is some definite complexity to the smell, it's pretty good. The taste however really comes up short. Much of the intricacy of the scent becomes lost as the taste becomes dominated with cherry. Initially a mild sour at first, it has a very sweet malty finish, leaving the beer pretty one dimension-able. The feel is poor also, as it too is dominated by this time carbonation. Very fizzy finish, but I'll at least give it that I don't taste much of the alcohol. Overall my impression of this is that it's like drinking cherry soda spiked with cherry pucker. I'm pretty new to lambics, but based off the overall score I think I'd be assuming correctly that this is a poor representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
"unfortunately the best feature of this beer is the bottle, damn it looks cool, but this beer is average at best. the pour is flamboyantly pink, thicker than most krieks, with airy white lacing all over the glass. the nose is overly sweet, even for the style, like canned cherries that you get on your Belgian waffle at denny's. not nice. I don't get much of that tart acidic lambic yeast character at all, just more like a sweet American syrupy fruit beer. the flavor is equally disappointing, its lacking that sharpness. especially for almost 20 bucks a bottle, this is a farce. teeth rotting sugary finish, cherries seem artificial, and the pucker is entirely absent. also the alcohol stands out a bit, which is unbecoming to a kriek. I was really let down by this, and to charge that price makes me angry at new Belgium, who hasn't done anything at all to impress me for some time now. too much body, fine carbonation, but its too late for the feel to help anything. overall save yourself some money and skip this substandard offering."
"This bitch pours a lovely cherry red with a light pink loose foam that falls in a minute or so. Smells nice and earthy with plenty of cherry and sweet hints of vanilla and some butter. I keep sticking my nose in for another whiff, which usually means it's complex and I dig it. Flavor is tart, with a little bitterness, some leather, some manure, some soil and grain and cherries. Medium on thin with moderate on low carb and a nice, wet finish. I think I might like this."
""
"O: A pretty decent take on the style overall. I'd like it to be a bit more sour and tart, but it's enjoyable and drinkable for an 8% lambic."
""
""
"O -Not overly sweet or tart. Easy to drink, but I wish it had more punch. Smells much nicer than it tastes."
"2013 version. Pours a beautiful, bright red color with a small, light-pink head that goes down quickly. Scent is somewhat funky and tart, but NOTHING along the lines of a lambic or American wild ale. Definitely has more of a fruit beer aroma, which is somewhat misleading since they call this one a kriek. Anyhow, the cherry comes through in the nose, along with some grainy malt aromas. Taste is tart at first, but QUICKLY becomes a mediocre fruit beer. Flavors of cherry and cranberry are present, but they are overtaken by grainy, cereal-like flavors that make this beer a bit underwhelming. Where you would want tartness and fruit flavors, you get a strange medicinal alcohol flavor. Pretty disappointing, just like the one I had two years ago was. Mouthfeel is nice, highly carbonated, and suits the beer that this one should be. Overall, not even close to my favorite Kriek, let alone fruit beer. Considering Boon plays a part in this, they should increase the quality of this one. Not undrinkable. Not bad. Overpriced. Would not buy again."
""
""
""
"O-I like New Belgium and I like the story of collaboration with Boon, so I am disappointed this is not a better beer, and not just because it is about $18 per bomber. As noted above, this brew is just is not that interesting. The flavors are lacking in intensity, and there is no sour or sweetness to make you want more. (I have also had the previous blend, and was similarly uninspired.)"
""
"We poured this Lambic from a bottle into pint glasses. The Lambic pourewd a clear reddish color, produced an off white pinkish head, featured poor retention and left moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of pale malted grain and cherries. Medium bodied, there was a base of malted grain, and a dominate flavor of sweet/tart cherries. Overall, the brew was decent but it tasted more like cherry juice then it did a lambic."
""
""
""
""
"2.5 D: At a price of $12.69 for the bomber, I feel thoroughly boned. Aside from the cherry flavor, this doesn't much resemble a kriek. It's a poor excuse to come up with an interesting name that appeals to beer geeks."
""
""
"This was OK. While the lack of depth and balance to the flavor does hurt it, I still found it strangely drinkable considering. Maybe the smoothness of the body for a bigger beer kept this in the game more than I thought it would. Anyway, it’s disappointing as a Kriek and not worth the price for it but I do have to give it some credit here."
""
"O: Again, not really bad, just doesn't live up to other krieks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I didn't have any problems finishing this, but I never thought of it as a very good kriek either. Wouldn't but again."
""
"O: Like a sour cherry lollipop and sugary water. Meh."
"Poured a deep crimson red in color with a pinkish colored head that left a little lacing sticking to the glass. I had hints of cherries upfront almost like it was cherry juice, slight acidic notes, some citrusy qualities and a little vinegary as well. The cherry character was more apparent on the palate alongside vinegary, oaky, and tart accents. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, and tart finish. It was pretty good beer but would not get more due to the stiff price tag."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent job. It may be a little past its prime. No fruit flavors and a more bitter than sour, but still pretty good."
"D - Very drinkable. The cherry flavor is nice and strong from start to end. The beer could have used a bit more depth, it had a nice delicate flavor to it."
"A boring kriek, though not at all bad."
"Had really high hopes for this beer, but at $15 a bottle, it is nothing but disappointment. How is it the most expensive lips of faith beer is also one of the worst?"
""
""
"Just getting my feet wet in the world of lambic and fruit beers. This offering is a bit simple and a good starter, not very intense. In short, a thin blonde ale with tart cherries. Not a good value at $15 for the bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am not that impressed. The beer is beautiful to behold and smells wonderful but the flavor lacks any depth."
""
"Hawaiin punch red. Small light pink head. Nice amount of funk in the nose. Arm pits, pencil shavings, pool toys, sour cherry, wine barrel, tomato vines. Flavors are mostly barrel soaked cherries. Mild cough syrup, brett, pool toys. Medium body and rather dry. This would make a great gateway sour for someone looking to get into the style."
"Light to medium bodied with below average carbonation. Has a dry finish. I am not very impressed by this beer. It was stored properly. Just not very good."
""

"O: Solid Kriek, wife hated it, but she's CZ, so don't mind her...price per oz and taste for kriek, worty buy."

"O - The sweetness makes this a definite sipping beer. While the drinkability on this is high, I feel the sweetness is a bit too overpowering and would benefit from more of a funk."
"This is a beer I've had a couple times, but each time its a disappointment. The beer certainly looks like a good lambic, with a nice bright red, but the aroma is a medicinal, candy cherry. The beer is not all that sour or lambic-y. There is a little tart cherry, but straight blonde base beer is like 75% of the beer equation. I'm not sure if there is wild yeast in the bottle, but it doesn't seem like this beer has developed much over time. The sourness is only noticeable, and in the end there is a good deal of artificial sweetness in the finish of the beer that is very off-putting. Truthfully, it's better than a lot of back-sweetener fruit beers but if you think this is a lambic like Cantillon, you are mistaken."
"O - Decent, but lacking the complexity of a World-Class fruit Lambic. Probably good for a sour ""newbie", but not really for me."
"Pours a dark red hue with a paper thin head that disapates into a steady ring clinging to my glass aroma of cherries funk and oak. Taste follows the nose, tart up front then cherries with an aftertaste of funk and oak. Pretty good, different than the norm and not overly sweet. I like it!"
"Overall, I do not like this beer. It is not a kriek at all. More like a fruit beer, and not a good one."
"Served from bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip. Poured a reddish pink with a two finger pink head that subsided to a half a finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherries, wood, earthy, and very subtle funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherries, tart, wood, and an earthy note. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great either. The flavor profile on this one seemed to be really dilute which was quite unfortunate. If I am honest this one really reminded me of some of the reasons why I enjoy Cantillon so much, but it just fell short. Worth trying to say that you have but I would leave it at that."
"Overall I like what the lager did to this beer, it took away some of the sweetness and added a bit of complexity. Worth a shot."
"Overall: The mouth-feel and appearance really work for me. The taste does not rise to the level of the appearance and mouth-feel. The cherry notes, really the overall taste, and the level of sourness leaves me wanting more."
"overall it was ok, nothing special by any means but still worth trying."
"Not sure what I expected here but this wasn't quite it."
"Opinion: I will have to go back and read the hype on this beer. I can't recall what their angle is, but this beer is bordering on foo-foo. When you set it up next to Le Terroir or La Folie, there is no comparison. This beer is mild enough to appeal to a Lindeman's drinker but isn't quite as sweet overall so it may be more appealing to some. For me, if I am drinking a sour beer, I don't want there to be any doubt. I prefer to pucker up and have the enamel cooked off my teeth. This beer doesn't do that."
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Color is a rich pink with a think head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is slightly sour with a slight barnyard funk. Taste is of raspberry/tart cherry with a touch of sour and a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is borderline medium, thicker than I would have guessed, and fairly dry."
"I felt like I was drinking a cherry soda rather than a Kriek Lambic. This is one beer I would not be buying again anytime soon, as there are many other Krieks I have enjoyed and would rather have."
"With the exception of La Folie, all of the Lips of Faith beers I have encountered have been too weak in flavor. That is not to say that they are watery, but they all have so much potential... Transatlantique Kriek has the same issue. This would be much better if it were funkier and more complex."
"D- l ended up liking this more than i was told i would. its pretty subtle for a lambic. id be happy to drink this again."
"Reviewed from notes. Pour is bright, bright red with a lightly-pink-hued head that bubbles up and falls down without leaving anything behind. The nose is a bit sour with quite a bit of cherries. Nothing all that complex. There is some moderate funk and a bit of a cherry-pie presence. The flavor is more of the same. There is a strong cherry presence along with a bit of funky sourness. Mouthfeel is nice as it positions the tart cherries against the acidity. An okay beer, but if I'm going with a New Belgium sour, I'd prefer La Folie (preferably C&C)."
"D: Not bad for a sour, doesn't taste very good but you don't tire of drinking it. This is a pretty big disappointment. The beer is, in a word, bland."
"Pretty fun Kriek, a decently dry and tart version of the style. Somewhat spicy and boozy, setting it a little apart from a Belgian. Lemongrass, menthol, diacetyl, and pale malt provide the backbone. Somewhat thin on the body end, but it's buttressed by the base ale. This is a good drinker with some noticeable flaws."
"Overall, a good beer, but not very accurate for the style."
"this is a comfort beer without being too hot...actually the heat is cloying....there it is and there it went....more the flavor and olfactory of alcohol without the btu's..."
"Who knew the French knew how to cross the Pond? Just wonderin'. This apparent bit of proof pours a slightly hazy ruby red grapefruit juice topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light cherry, ruby red grapefruit, and what seems like a light cocoa. The taste brings in more cherry, along with some oak, cedar, and a touch of dark peach. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I enjoyed this bit o' kriek: It's nothing mind-blowing, but pretty tasty nonetheless."
"D: Very sour, nice sweet pie flavor. Not what I'm used to but for the style, its pretty good."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light not watery. The lactic tones are never to the puckering level. Alcohol is nowhere present in the flavor. If its possible the beers mouthfeel is bland. The beer isnt a drain pour but I became quickly bored with it. This beer was a major let down."
"ried grapefruit. The cherry flavor lingers a bit after the finish. M- The light mouthfeel has a dryness to the texture but not really an astringent quality. There is no alcohol heat noticed. D- This beer is a bit mild once you get past the cherry flavor there is not a lot of support. The lambic critters don't offer much depth or support to the fruit either, just a light tartness."
"Drinkability: Rather disappointing from a brewery that delivers La Folie; easy to drink, but closer to a fruit beer than a kriek"
"Reviewed on 1/10/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear red with a small ring of white head. Aroma of diacetyl, cherry, oak, and must. Flavor still retains some diacetyl with tart cherry and oak notes. Sweet and a touch syrupy. A little tough to drink by the end of the glass but not bad."
"taste impression: starts sweet, with a solid lambic punch and right before the sour fruity flavor gets overwhelming, a nice dryness imparted by the alcohol comes along to balance out the flavor. any hop characteristics are masked by the intense sour cherry flavor. this would be a good beer to give to someone who likes wine."
"D: This is one of those beers I use as an example of why I don't take New Belgium seriously."
"Pours a light clear red. Mild nose, some cherries, not offensive or medicinal which is really something, I'm finding. After about 10 krieks today it's difficult to pull out nuances and general descriptors here. My notes say ""Succeeds in being not sweet, fails in otherwise succeeding."" Then my notes just say ""A bit metallic an"" and it ends there. Another classic."
"Poured like an opaque black-cherry soda, with a small head that dissipated quickly atop a translucent dark ruby. Cherries and plum made up the bulk of the aroma, with little else other than the fruity aromas. Nice tart notes stand out over the cherry sweetness, and it has a nice boozy warmth to it. Lighter body than the abv would suggest, and carbonation faded quickly- all with a sour aftertaste. Went down a bit quickly, but not one I could see myself drinking all the time."
"D: Pretty easy drinker, but just not that great of Lambic. I'll try it again if they re-release it in 2011."
"This is a decent, but not great, beer. I enjoyed it for the most part. As far as the flavor is concerned, I would have liked a little more of everything: sourness, funk, cherries, etc. It would be a nice introduction to sours for the uninitiated. All in all it's not bad, but if you're looking for a top-notch sour, look elsewhere."
"The feel of this beer is light with a sweet aftertaste. It goes down with ease and is pretty silky."
"Hmmm....medium in body, really creamy in the mouth, good levels of carbonation, there is just one thing wrong with this beer, it tastes terrible. Its straight lactic acid, the cherry tartness is so late and completely absent in the front that it comes off as medicinal completely. Its like cherry candy mixed with yogurt...not my thing. I've had a lot of ""lambics"" and this misses the mark completely. There is no citric or acetic brightness, there is no forward cherry flavor or sweetness at all, it's a tart mess. Lactic bomb. Its not a good stand alone flavor IMO. Parallel beers balance it with fruit or make the sourness harsher with additional mixed acids. This tastes like an amateurish attempt at a sour ale by a homebrewer that realized that if he just added 1 ounce of lactic acid per gallon you would get a sour beer. Will not repeat."
"Overall, not drinkable. I won't finish a lot of this beer. Just doesn't have a lot going on. There are much better lambics out there."
"Notes: An interesting brew, and unique. But...I'm pretty sure I could tell you that it's got Boon in it. Don't really see the New Belgium influence on the beer. Glad I bought it though!"
"- Overall I am not too impressed with this one... and I am curious as to what this would be like soured.. blended, and aged. Overall ok. For $14, most likely won't be buying it again."
"22oz bottle into a Hopus glass pours a crisp dark ruby red with a thin light purple head that diminishes to a ring and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet cherry and not much else. The taste is loads of tart cherry with an interesting malt backbone. The alcohol in this one is not that noticeable due to the extreme tartness of the beer. This is an interesting lambic, but it does not begin to compare with it's true Belgian counterparts."
"The pour was a delightful carmine red with a thin, glass edge head. Smells of cherries with a light malts and subtle brandy. Taste is fruity with a light tartness overpowered by ligering fructose. The beer does have a slight ""soda"" feel but is not sickeningly sweet. This is not a beer that you can drink everyday but it is a perfect pairing to the end of a meal or as an introduction of belgium krieks for a signifcant other."
"Not a very good kriek but still an enjoyable beer. The beer is a dull maroon with a small but dissipating white head. Somehow, the look fits the beer. The aroma is mostly cherries but not terribly clean. There's some cough syrup in there. The beer is also a bit sweet and lacking in intensity of flavor. It's a washed out kriek that's easy to drink but not compelling. There's some sour character and acidity. It's mildly tart on the palate. Feel seems appropriate. Good enough fruit beer."
"D: Pretty good. Nice, a good sour hit, but does not have the long lingering sourness I would expect. The finish dry, and very clean."
"O= overall, this looks like a beer my wife should be drinking, but the 8% abv makes it manly enough for me to drink with familiar people in the privacy of my own home;)"
"Drinkability: It's a relatively high alcohol lambic, but having one bomber of these in an evening is just enough. This is a really well put together beer from Brewerij Boon and New Belgium. An interesting way to brew a beer, though I can't imagine it being that cost effective. I'll be adding this to my crate again in the future."
"O: Good introduction to what kriek should be, rather than the artificial candy sweetness of another more well known brand. Still a very bland offering that seems to want to please everyone, and succeeds in pleasing very few."
"Transatlantic Kriek was somewhat of a disappointment for me. As I said before, there is nothing wrong with it, but there isn't anything that really draws me to it either. When it is priced in the same area as a lot of belgians that are pretty good beers, that is problem."
"D: Goes down very easy, nice kick, alcohol is well hidden. This is one that I could sit with all night."
"VERY NICE!"
"D - While this isn't the most true to style beer out there I still liked it for the most part La Folie is a lot better but hey NB is trying to do something different"
"D - Excellent. Very refreshing."
"Sour and fruity - softly cherry-like, with some very mild cough syrup kind of flavor under a nice sourness. Soft floral/perfume tones. Soft sweetness. Finishes softly tart. Tastes good. Feels nice. Good drinkability."
"The best thing about this beer is the way it hides the 8%abv. This has the potential of being a fantastic high rated brew from a company that knows how to make a fantastic sour ale."
"(D)- I am not very impressed with this Kriek. Its rather boring. I enjoy breweries trying more obscure beer styles, but I am not a fan of this one. Particularly when the style is referenced, this doesnt follow it well. For $11.99 a bottle, I was even more disappointed."
"drinkability - gets better as it warms but starts to fatigue as it gets near the end"
"D - Interesting, but not worth seeking out."
"drinkability: ok"
"This should be a good beer. It's got a really nice kriek in there somewhere but the mix isn't doing it any favors. They ruined a perfectly good beer by getting too creative. Disappointing."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is above average, but perhaps lower then it should be for the style. Drinkability is average for the style. It had some nice cherry flavors but tasted more like a cherry juice then a lambic beer."
"Why mix what seems to be a perfectly good kriek with a regular 'ol lager? Totally dilutes the tart and sour aspects of a lambic, you can tell what was in place before the lager addition as some mild acidic and sour notes are there. That said, it is still plenty enjoyable and is by far the most chuggable lambic ever created. The cherry flavors taste really good and natural. Slight medicinal sting at the end, but does not detract from the beer in any way for me. Grainy malts are expectedly prevalent and lend some sweetness to the beer. Mouthfeel is great and glides down the throat with ease and the 8% ABV is nowhere in sight. I enjoyed drinking this beer and will not have any problem finishing this whole bomber by myself, but going into this thinking authentic Belgian Kriek - one is bound to be disappointed."
"D - Hmm, not really enjoying this beer very much...and I really wanted to also. Should've listened to knucks999 - warned me it was a bit off, but I had to try anyway. Just strange...tastes more like homemade red wine that was made with a bad kit and not totally fermented out before bottling. I'm usually a fan of the New Belgium Lips of Faith series beer, but this one totally misses the mark for me."
"Drinkable, not spectacular..."
"Pours a medium dark red color with a white head. It is very clear. The aroma is tart cherries with some light funk. The flavor is tart cherries with some vanilla and oak. There is something at the end of the flavor that is a little off but it doesn't take away too much. This tastes a lot like a dry red wine. Low carbonation and thin-medium mouthfeel."
"D: This is a good beer, but it is not exactly a good example of the style. There is still something that tastes artificial about it to me. However, it is a stepping stone to other beers."
"What am I going to do with the 750mL I have at home? I was expecting so much more from this, especially since I'm not in love with their Kriek, either. How long can I age something with that much fruit in it? Would that even help?"
"My memory may be a bit weak, but I think this is actually weaker than the original, lower alcohol release. I was at least expecting a bright cherry note here, but that isn't here and neither is a pronounced funkiness or sourness. Somehow this beer has been a disappointment from what I was even expecting; it is just too bland overall. Still this is not a horrible beer, just not exactly what I was hoping for."
"Very sprightly, fizzy, without much head. Tart but not sour. I don't taste much malt, or Belgian oddities. Flavor recedes as you sip. It has its charms but I am not so eager for another bottle. Claims 8% abv but it really does not seem that strong to me. I always look for New Belgium offerings but I hope they go back to the more strongly-flavored version of the kriek."
"Glad I got to try it but unless I get tired of watching my friends wince at the sourness of most of what I serve, I won't be looking to pick it up. Possibly for someone who doesn't like beery beers or sour sours though."
"Overall, this is my first New Belgium brew and consequently my first from the Lips of Faith series. I feel like this beer has potential, but isn't one that I would visit again unless they revamp the recipe or lower the $15 sticker price."
"All in all a decent beer."
"D - Good, but slightly less bitter would be more drinkable."
"D: Not one of New Belgiums winner, I feel like this beer has a serious identity crisis. It thinks it's a lambic but everything screams fruit beer or cheap wine. Body is too watery and it takes away a lot from the already light flavor. A stunning beer to look at though..."
"Pours a light ruby red color body with a smallish pink foamy head, diminishing. Clear. Sour aroma, strong. Some fruitiness, cherries. But almost a fake cherry smell, like extract. Strong sours, earthy, farmy. Reminiscent of a red wine. Mouth watering smell. Dry fizzy taste, somewhat dry aftertaste. Light cherries, fruit. Almost non-existent. Nutty aftertaste. Very good taste, extremely drinkable. Somewhat puckering. Clean tasting. Almost like a sour fizzy candy, less fizzy, but still that sharpness."
"And then, the taste. The sour is minimal, the cherries more pronounced, the flavor flat. 2 dimensions, pedestrian, a dry Lindemans. The sparks on my tongue comes more from carbonation that sour, it's a fizzy soda with a hint of disappointment. A Kriek version of Fat Tire, the safe way to brew."
"Pours a Kool-Aid like cherry skin, yet clear red woth some visible carbonation and a super quick, flash-in-the-pan head. The aroma is candy cream cherries with maybe a touch of barnyard mingling around. Interesting, but a little too candy-sweet for a lambic in my view. The taste has a tart strawberries and cherries and crem taste right upfont. The middle takes a more general tart fruit flavor with some earthy lambic yeasty goodness. The finish is ripe fruit and must. The palate feels more carbonated than it looks. Fruity and tart, but lacking complexity and sophistiction. Not worth the $15 a 22oz bottle I spent."
"This is a really fun beer that I can gladly recommend to anyone."
"This ruby red lambic is a blend of two. The nose is all cherry, with a good dose of the sourness being revealed. Cherry follows in to the taste, and dominates the palette. It is delightfully sour with a complex herbal bitterness that helps round out the beer. Although it is 8%, this one is refreshing with a lasting, slightly bitter finish."
"d: i think that this is a great take on the style; has the tartness of a traditional kriek but it is rounded out by some of the sweet mellowness of the malts; i would have it again and i thoroughly enjoyed it; and my girlfriend liked it and she rarely likes beer"
"D - This is a nice drinkable beer with definite lambic/ real fruit character that could serve as a great introduction to the style for a novice. The lambic character isn't as intense as a traditional Kriek, but the fruit is very nice, despite a minor note of cough syrup in the middle. I am not sure why this hasn't been reviewed better than it has been, but I certainly enjoyed it. It was a bit on the expensive side for a beer that was only 55% lambic, but I picked it up at a store that marks its beer up too much IMO, so it may be more reasonable elsewhere. Overall, it is a very drinkable beer that retains a lot of the depth of its base; it is almost a sessionable lambic."
"D: Probably the worst of the Lips of Faith beers. In theory, this should be great, but it just comes out as a sugar bomb with hardly any features of the actual lambic."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/3.5"
"Overall, it's not a beer that I'd return to frequently. It's not explicitly a lambic, and this sort of in-between state makes it unappealing. Nevertheless, it's still an interesting beer that's fun for something different."
"While I applaud New Belgium's experimentation, sometimes you just can't improve upon tradition."
"Avoid. I really like New Belgium, and a lot of the Lips of Faith beers. This is just bad though. There is nothing Lambic about this. They need to go back to the drawing board with this. I feel cheated, and I need a good beer now."
"pretty good for a fruit beer. better than most."
"drinkability - overpriced lacking flavor = will not being buying again"
"D - This is a very nice fruit beer. A steep price tag but a very good beer."
"Drinkability is good. Not too sour, nice change of pace for me. I liked this very much, and all in attendance enjoyed the chance to savor this. Wish I had brought a few more back to work on my friends who are just getting into sours."
"Overall, somewhat of a disappointment. I love Boon's brews, particularly the Oude Kriek, and I generally enjoy New Belgium's lineup, but this mixture didn't showcase the strengths of either."
"Drinkability= A sipper. Not something I would SEEK out again. But this was a good beer that I was glad to try."
"The beer is light bodied, and well carbonated for the style. The 8% abv is well hidden in the flavors, but the flavors are just slightly lacking on this one. The La Folie is one of my favorite beers, and I had high hopes for this one, it fell short of expectations."
"This is a very drinkable sour beer - I cannot believe that this is 8% ABV! You don't get alcohol in the taste or the aroma."
"Dramatic beer. Poured with a giant pink foamy frothy textured head wth a load a lace. Color is clear slightly brown tinged rose red. Aroma is a mild cherry with a little spice. Flavor is malty cherry pie, more on the sour side. Clean. Body is good and ditto carbonation. Finish is decent. Not overdone at all. Easy and balanced. Tough to be a session in this style. Good beer overall though."
"the finish for this is lingering cherry and a very clean tasting beer with sharp carbonation. a highly drinkable beer here and just an all around good kriek to drink on."
"Pretty good drinking, but not my cup o'tea (beer)"
"I'm not normally much of a sour beer drinker, but this one is excellent."
"edit: i drainpoured the last 6 or 7 ounces, so drinkability takes a hit."
"Pours a clear, deep red color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of cherry, tart malt, and acid. Fits the style of a Lambic. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with an average carbonation level. There's also a noticeable tartness associated with this brew. Tastes of cherry up front, tart malt, slight sweet malt, and some yeast. Overall, different than the other Kriek's I've had, but still quite drinkable."
"Pours a luxurious dark ruby red with pink head that recedes to a thin rim lace. Nose isn't as assertive as other examples of Kriek, and I'm able to note a slightly herbal sour cherry with a hint of barnyard funk in the background. Luckily the barnyard isn't there on the palate, as the sour cherry with light baking spices take over. Not as sour as beers known to be sour, and not as cherried as most cherry beers, especially when compared to Lindeman's. Drinkable, but not exciting as far as a Kriek goes."
"Drinks alright, the ABV is well hidden, but not really interesting enough to want more than one bomber. Pretty much a one & done for me, was hoping for way more, not much of a Lambic"
"I have been a HUGE fan of the lips of faith series until about an hour ago... Bottle La Terroir. Thats worth the cash. I wouldnt pay $5 for this bomber let alone 10"
"D - A bit of a mess in my opinion. Not bad but I expected much more after having tried many NB sours at various festivals. More lambic is needed in my opinion."
"I don't think Transatlantic Kriek is a bad beer, exactly. For the ridiculous price, however, I expected so much more. I'll be more wary of the Lips of Faith series in the future."
"Picked up a bottle for $12 at Liquor World in Fayetteville, AR. Poured a bright pink-red with a short off-white head. I dont know what kind of problem most people are having with this beer, but I though it was pretty good - a sort of middle ground between the sweet, thick Lindeman's Kriek and the super funky Drie Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek. There's a good portion of juicy cherries, but there's also a nice balance of mellow earthy, barnyard aroma and flavor. Most krieks seem to fall on one end of the sweet-wild spectrum, but this is a delicious compromise."
" Palate wearying, and would never touch again with a ten foot pole."
"Sour, unripened berries on the front of the palate followed by a sharp apple cider and vinegar finish. Flashes of sweetness from toasted crystal malts and cherry pie, but its lost in a messy, boozy sea of tartness. Body is uncomfortably carbonated and thin, pricking the palate in all the wrong places. Even though I'm not a huge sour beer fan, I can distinguish a well-crafted sour from one that's not. Unfortunately for New Belgium, this falls into the latter category. Pass."
"Overall, my girlfriend liked it and I thought it was ok. Everyone else...not so much."
"The idea behind this beer clearly reveals a passion and international appreciation for the art of brewing, but the execution is sloppy and it seems like a waste of such noble intentions. The Lips of Faith is a premium series with a premium price tag that this beer just does not live up to. Considering New Belgium has been trotting out some exceptional sours, though on an extremely limited basis, this disappoints thoroughly. Looks great, sounds great, tastes thoroughly mediocre. And that's a bad miss."
"Split a 22oz bomber with my wife. Poured into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a bright raspberry red with a 1 inch pastel pink head that recedes into just a thin layer resting on the top of the beer leaving just a spackle of lacing all over the glass. The aroma is a bright cherry vinegar with oak, lemon zest, diacetyl and a bit of Belgian candy sugar. The flavor isn't nearly as dynamic as the nose is. All of the flavors are just dull versions of the aroma. Tart cherries, lemon, oak, sacramental wine and sweet apple cider vinegar. Also the butter is a bit more powerful then I would have wanted. My biggest problem with this beer is the finish on the flavor profile is overwhelming sweet. The sweetness on the finish overshadows much of the crisp tartness of the Boon Kriek. The mouthfeel is cakey dry, leaving the palate wanting just a little more. This is a good beer. I love seeing American breweries taking a leap on new styles for them."
"Drinkability? I'll finish the bottle but it isn't a thrill a sip for me. I doubt I'll buy this again and whoa...the alcohol is starting to kick in now. Nope. Not my cup of tea at all. I loved the previous edition..."
"Just kind of average for me. Well balanced and drinkable."
"I liked it upon first impression but the more I drank the less I liked it."
"D: I've been wanting to try this for a long time, but wasn't really impressed by this one, intriguing idea though."
"Pours a clear ruby red, some dark orange highlighting, thick off white head forms, settles to a solid ring, tons of lace sticks to the glass. Smell is great, fresh cherry juice, oak, quite woody, lemon acidity, charred wood, very fruity, nice sourness, blackberries, good stuff. Taste is similar, tart cherries, fresh fruit salad, lemons, charred wood, nice acidity, sour fruit/cherries near the finish, vanilla, oak, great cherry flavour. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to low carbonation, very drinkable stuff, ABV is not apparent at all. Seems like this is much better on tap than in bottles, because this stuff was pretty dope."
"By no means a terrible beer, but within its style, there are better options."
"Poured a candy apple red color with good carbonation and light foamy white head.Nose is cherry and some funk. Taste is dark cherry, effervescent even, rather weak. ABV is well hidden though. Mouthfeel is rather bland, not much going on besides a bad cherry taste. his beer was a ripoff! DO not waste your money."
"This lambic tastes more bitter than anything but a sour alcohol, you can barely detect the cherries. A very disappointing lambic."
"Easy to drink, refreshing, Not a bad effort if a bit pricy, I'll recommend it but try more local tries if I seek this again."
"Clear and tawny colored, poured with a small white head that dissipated quickly. Massive diacetyl aroma with a hint of Maraschino cherry beneath it. It's like buttered cherry. Or cherry butter, more accurately. The taste is equally vile and buttery, with surprisingly minimal fruit flavor and no sourness to speak of. Slick, coating mouthfeel, no finesse whatsoever and a horrible lingering diacetyl finish. This beer is a fucking trainwreck, avoid at all costs."
"Conceptually this should be a homerun out of the park, but ultimately the blend isn't flattering to either producer. Boon Oud Kriek kicks TK's ass all up and down, and conversely La Folie gives Boon a run for it's money. In the end this is neither here nor there, but it's better than Dark Kriek, just double the price, which seems justified for importing Boon Lambic to CO to blend this brew, but too much $$$ for what you end up with."
"Update - just read this is a blend of a kriek by Boon and a golden lager by New Belgium. That makes a bit more sense, and while the taste of the brew obviously remains the same, my expectations would have been a whole lot different."
"D: Pretty easy to drink, wouldn't be a good session though, one because of the price, and two the effort made to make this beer is impressive, best to cherish it. An interesting beer, and a very cool collaboration between Boon and New Belgium. I really want to try the original though."
"Really easy drinking beer w/ a good balance. No real bold flavors although the tartness is great and not overpowering."
"22oz bottle $9. The first whiff from the bottle is like red wine vinegar. The beer is bright pink with a decent head fro a brief moment. The secodn glass I poured, the head was super foamy and pink and looked cool as shit. The aroma is more vinegar, cherries and dirty socks but in a good way? The smell really grows on me despite the fact there is a buttery cake aspect to it. The taste is weird, definitely a little bit of sour, but the syrupy cherry flavor is the main flavor. The flavor was kind of a disappointment to be honest."
"The body is between moderate and light but finishes very dry with the lingering cherry vanilla notes. Carbonation is low and considerable for style, but not offensive. Overall great to see this one back. Ideally I would have liked to see it not filtered but should age nicely."
