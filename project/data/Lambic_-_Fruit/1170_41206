The flavor is a pucker factor times ten with strong tart and sour raspberry. The raspberry is a very natural freshly picked flavor with some earth tones and maybe a bit of mineral. The puckering flavor obviously translates to feel but it's without the vinegar feel. This is a straightforward, unabashed raspberry sour!","KYGunner","Jul 26, 2014"

The aroma is very acetic, with citric acid notes, and raspberry sweetness. There is a subtle touch of yeasty funk. Flavor is one of the most sour things I've ever tasted. Notes of oak and raspberry weave a tapestry along with the acetic, citric, and lactic acid, creating a really rewarding experience. It's impressive that, despite the incredibly sour taste, there's enough berry and wood character to shine and really make this beer a standout. Definitely couldn't drink a full bottle in one sitting, though.","barczar","Jul 24, 2014"

The acidity seemed to mellow toward the aftertaste as the beer became sweeter. One also could detect vanilla with the modest sour notes. The aftertaste further displays quite a bit of natural seedy raspberry flavor. It is easy to tell his is made with real berries.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 22, 2013"

The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the sour flavors are much stronger compared to the sweet ones.

Holy crap, this one was a GEYSER! The cork literally removed itself once the cage was off! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a pinkish red with a minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, sour, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really hate that half the bottle ejected itself into the sink as most people really seemed to enjoy this one the most of the lineup. I can see why as the combination of the raspberries with the sour/tart notes just simply worked together.

3.95,-5.3,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle. 2009 vintage. Pours a slightly hazed orange amber color with zero head. The smell is rather a sharp raspberry tart nose with some slight barnyard types. Slightly sweet upfront with a nice tart raspberry sourness. Some apple notes as well. Slightly mouth puckering. Ends rather cleanly. Very drinkable. I'd like to see the raspberry flavors a little more prevalent.","kbutler1","0"
4.47,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served in a mini snifter. Pours a light pink color with a nice white head and moderate lacing after a few good swirls. The nose pulls through some really, really excellent and fresh raspberry notes along with some good levels of sourness as well as a bit of oak. The taste is strong raspberry with really nice levels of acidity. Good oak component. The sourness level is really great with the fruit flavor and this is one delicious brew--by far my favorite of their lambic series.","Thorpe429","Oct 19, 2010"

4.18,0.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Really liked this one. Not overly complex, but it really doesn't need to be. It's as-advertised, sour/tart notes and raspberries. Upland keeps getting better and better with every batch they release. Recommend.","Sean9689","Sep 03, 2010"
4.07,-2.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D - Decent, actually, fairly good, it could be much better though. The lack of a body is disheartening. It's still decent and the nice tart finish is very good.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 21, 2010"

3.75,-10.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Decent offering from Upland -- probably the second best sour I've had from them behind the blackberry. The raspberry really isn't all that evident, not that that's necessarily a bad thing. Probably a better beer than my rating may reflect, but nobody's going to be confusing this with something from Russian River or Cantillon.","WeisGuy","May 18, 2010"

A notch or three below medium bodied with decent carbonation. Kind of fell a bit flat on the palate. I hope the other flavors have fared better.","ClockworkOrange","Nov 26, 2009"

I find myself enjoying this beer, despite the flaws, and I am having no problem getting through the whole 750ml on my own. Alcohol presence is not detected at all, flavors are smooth and refreshing on a warm day. Easily drinkable, may be a good entry fruit lambic for those not used to the more sour flavors typical of the style.","portia99","0"

4.37,4.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Color wise this one sows the fruit tone in the body very well. A bit of an orange red tone makes up the body on this one. Head is a skim and even then just barely, but the bubbles do hang on to the walls of the glass. The sour raspberry feel does shine through on the nose. It includes a horse blanket funk that adds a nice complex smell. Sour feel is quite soft as you take first sip. The fruit profile is prickly and juicy all over the tongue with a nice raspberry feel. There is a powdery sweet feel that hangs on to the back of the tongue and mixes with the sour feel nicely. Considerably yeasty throughout. Mouthfeel is pillow like soft and very enjoyable. Super drinkability for the style.","SPLITGRIN","Jun 27, 2009"

These start to get a bit bland after a while, though they are certainly valiant attempts. In particular the super aromatic notes of the raspberry is just to powerful for this beer to remotely stand up to, so the nose is all raspberry. My particular, general apathy towards raspberry beers makes this one a bit less enjoyable than the other Upland Lambics, but it is certainly on the same level as the others.","Gueuzedude","Nov 09, 2008"
