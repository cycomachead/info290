The palate is exquisite with just the right amount of lemony tartness with just a hint of sweetness in the back. The story here is deep, dry, raspberry flavors as raspberry as it is possible to get with traces of malt and wheat in the background. Light body with medium high carbonation. Nothing cloying or over sweet. Grab a bottle of this, a baguette, some smelly cheese and sit in the park all day and watch the roller skaters.","pat61","Mar 02, 2015"

3.99,6.1,3.75,4,4.25,3.5,3.75,"fortunate enough to have this one on draft. a really great beer all up, enormously better than their base kriek i think. the fruit is less medicinal, and the lambic base comes through more. i see more grain, more sourness, and a better mouthfeel that isnt so weighted down by fruit sugars. the raspberry nose is robust, and the flavor is just as true. a little tart, a lot summery, and all fruit on the finish. clear in color, way more clear than the kriek, with a brilliant ruby red as its base, but not a whole lot of head. i smell what i taste, and im fine with that, although this is nowhere near as dynamic or compelling as the best framboise on the market. i do think its a step up from the elementary kriek in its fruit authenticity and its dryness, which is only medium, but way less sweet than the cherry. i also think its more drinkable for the same reason. again, nowhere near as good as some of the more mature beers they do, oude kriek for example, but awfully good and a darn good presentation of what raspberry can do in a simple base beer.","StonedTrippin","Oct 06, 2014"

I definitely did not make a mistake here. Unfortunately, this one didn’t shine as the last bottle that I had. All of the right flavors were there, but they just weren’t as intense as I remembered the bottle being.

There were also chunks of sediment in the pour and they dispersed along the bottom of my Founders snifter. The aromas are surprisingly of very fresh raspberries or a raspberry dessert. I expected them to be muted but they're actually quite pungent and feature both a nice sweetness and nice tart aspect. The flavors begin sweet before fading into a light raspberry tart. The finish is kind of strange, which could be from the sediment. It tastes kind of yeasty and bitter on the finish. It's almost like the flavor you get when you bite into raspberry seeds. It drinks fine and isn't overly sweet or tart. I can see why some people wouldn't like this and I can see why some people would. It's almost right in between sweet and sour framboise. I guess it depends on your preference. Overall, a pretty decent beer in my opinion.","aasher","Apr 09, 2011"

Taste is very similar to the nose with an intense berry flavor blast (mainly raspberry, other berries too) up front with only a slight bit of sour lambic coming through on the finish. A bit of fruit rind/stem bitterness after each sip. Carbonation level is somewhat high which makes for a crisp soda like mouthfeel. The beer leaves the palate a bit sticky after each sip, again like a soda. Overall, this is a fantastic raspberry lambic that is quite different from ones I have had in the past.

4.49,19.4,3,4,5,4.5,4.5,"D - This is an unusually drinkable example of the style. If there is a weak point in this beer it is the aroma, which is a bit weak and lacks some of the spectacular complexity found in the nose of other classic fruit lambics. The flavor, however, is perfectly balanced and the funk and sourness are masterfully restrained to the point that they allow the beer to remain easy to drink while maintaining the complexity of a great lambic.","nickfl","Sep 20, 2007"
4.23,12.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"D: A very good fruit lambic, funkier and tarter than Lindemans, not as dry as Cantillon, but a solid drinking beer, a very good lambic, in my opinion, very tasty and drinkable.","Halcyondays","Sep 05, 2007"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured out of 375ml bottle with 8-2-11 exp date. Poured into a lindemans framboise flute. The color was red with a brown hazy but certainly more red than brown. Head foamed up a nice size but bubbles not very lacy more like a champagne head that dissipated a minute latter to settle in to a thin layer of foam out line the meniscus.The smell of raspberries, yeast funk, with a sugary tartness with a residual of sourness. Taste raspberry tart candies with a little dryness to sweetness of the beer but still more sweet than dry. Mouthfeel is tart and pops with a lightness, and a steady carbonation helps give a little for body to the mouthfeel. Its good framboise for those looking for more sweetness in their fruit lambics. A little more complex than sweeter framboise such as Lindemans or Cherish but less complex than Boon, Cantillon, or drie fonteinen framboise.","sfoley333","Aug 31, 2007"
4.27,13.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Not bad for a sweetened framboise, not overly sweet and enough tartness to provide a nice balance. It doesn't rise to the great heights of the more ""traditional"" offerings from Oud Beersel but it's still excellent in it's own right.","ViveLaChouffe","Aug 14, 2007"

Flavor runs with aroma, however edging more towards a tradition raspberry tart and some preserves. Aromatic and bold phenols climb in bed with a bouquet of roses. Fuming and crisp, however a touch sugary and lacking for a totalitarian fruit Lambic. Thanks for sharing Logan!","CharlesDarwin","Apr 27, 2007"

About as tart as a raspberry, tame as far as lambics go but pretty nice. Grassy profile. Screaming to be paired with a dinner salad with raspberry vinegarette. Mouthfeel lost a few points for the thick sugars that hurt my teeth, although its not as bad as some *others*. Much better than the gueuze. Not a bad beer but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.

3.68,-2.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice burgundy color, but with only a faint bit of froth on top. Aroma of tart raspberries and wild yeast present, with a mild smell of alcohol. Taste is strong, initially I notice sweet raspberry flavor on the front of the tongue, which becomes slightly tart, but not overdone. Alcohol is somewhat evident in finish, but doesn't affect the drinkability. Very bubbly, and feels slightly thin on the palate. I felt this was more drinkable than many other lambics as the sourness was not as overpowering as I could have been. I was able to enjoy it without being turned off by any overly strong flavors...","bennetj17","Feb 19, 2006"

I've tried the ultra sweet ones (e.g., Lindemans) and the ultra pucker ones (e.g., Cantillon) and they were OK, had their good points and bad, I could appreciate what they had done, but overall, I have yet to find any that I really just enjoyed sitting there and drinking. Well, I finally found one. Fresh raspberries, but in a subtle, toned down way that allows the beery lambic to also be present. Not overly sour, but enough sour to keep it from being boring.

The head is over 1 thick and lasts throughout the session. The smell is grassy with a bit of raspberry thrown in. I can already tell by the smell that this is more of a traditional lambic. The taste proves it, it isnt over the top sweet. It has a good sweet-sour balance and the raspberries are not overpowering. One of the best lambics that Ive had so far.","TheEclecticGent","Jan 29, 2006"

Nose has a delicate sweet aroma of raspberries, with a nice tart background, a real foreshadowing of things to come; start is sweet, with a pleasant feel to the palate.

This is a nice quaffable fruit beer; not sweet either so none of that horrible sweet raspberry flavor is present. Definitely a good session beer. It does not reach contemplative though; a good Lambic, in my mind, is incredibly complex (this one isn't), yet at the same time eminently quaffable and thirst quenching (this one is).","Gueuzedude","Aug 14, 2005"
