A crisp note of lemon peel, as well as a higher carbonation invite the funk, which turns quite sour, with a dry aspect to it, while it never overpowers the cherries. Instead, the cherries seem to rejuvenate, while the sourness increases, evoking a refreshing spriziness. The sour aspect includes a fermented fruit note, as well as a glimpse of vinegar, among wooden malts, which turn more recognizable towards the finish, together with sweet, ripe cherries, as the funk settles down. A fruity, slick cherry flavor remains on the tongue for a longer while, with the sourness already faded.","aleigator","Dec 07, 2014"

Pours cloudy and dark, a reddish-brown hued body with a small, pink-tinted head that settles down quickly. Not much in the way of lacing but there usually isn’t in authentic kriek. Body is moderately thin, with very light but present carbonation. Aroma of tart cherries and some other lighter berry notes, with a touch of oak and hints of vinegar. Taste very much follows the nose; good sourness and tart cherry flavor, lighter oak notes, decent acidity and some traces of vinegar underneath that are well-integrated and not overbearing. If anything it’s a little thin in terms of boldness of taste and very slightly watery. Not a super sour-cherry bomb but has a bit of puckering in the finish. This would be a nice introduction to the style for someone who’s ready for an authentic, unsweetened kriek but not for something as full-on atomic as say Hansenn’s Oude Kriek. Very nice but a bit on the pricey side.","tobelerone","Jun 03, 2012"

The sourness is just perfect, one or steps back from being cloying, pulling off the rare feat of being very extreme but not seeming too harsh or gimmicky. The more traditional yeasty lambic nodes do a wonderful job of balancing out the cheeksucking sour of the fruit.","mynie","Oct 14, 2011"

Not quite on the same level as Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen, but a notch below. Lots of cherry presence in both the aroma and flavor, despite the bottle approaching six years old. Mellow and easy to drink. Nice tartness throughout. I definitely recommend it.","Huhzubendah","Oct 13, 2011"

Much to this beers' disadvantage, I've had the 01 and 07 Lou Pepe Kriek and the 08 Schaerbeekse Kriek multiple times in the past month, and it doesn't really stand up to those giants, but it's still an excellent beer. Funk is low, there's some oak character, just a little vanilla. A little vinegar appears towards the finish, rather balsalmic like, but when coupled with the cherries, it's more like a light fruit vinaigrette.Drying on the finish with a moderate to high acidic character that's a blend mostly of lactic and lemon with a little acetic, this one does attack the enamel. There's a lingering cherry character on the finish, dry and with plenty of skin tannins and a touch of acetone. Light in body with medium-high carbonation, this beer feels great on the palate. The alcohol is well hidden, though I wish they could drop it to a more manageable 5% to allow for true sessioning and complete destruction of the stomach lining.","DefenCorps","Jun 20, 2010"

Nevertheless, tart cherry is there, but extremely well balanced with the leather, the must, the funk of the gueuze base. Mouth is dry, puckering just a bit, kind of light in body. Tastes sour, with a bit of vinigar, the must and funk, the tart cherries... if this is as classic and authentic version of the style, then sign me up as a fan.

Taste is a mileau of rich flavors  sour, tangy, plenty of cherry, and a fairly subdued sweetness that coats the top of the mouth (nothing like Lindemans et al). Can feel the alcohol in the chest, seemingly a bit strong for a lambic, but quite pleasant. The delicious sour taste remains on the lips for some time.

4.3,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Acquired at the Publick House in Brookline, MA. This beer was moderately tart. Didn't end up noticing that soured pale ales were mixed in! Anyways, this was an opaque reddish-pink color and had a relatively small head. The taste had a balanced sourness, and a noticeable cherry flavor. The aroma had the usual funk to it, but it wasn't overpowering. A little hoppiness, but not over the top. One of the more easy going lambics that I've had. Thoroughly enjoyed this beer and well worth trying (the XX Bitter is amazing too!)","EmilNoldSinclair","Feb 17, 2007"
4.65,10.7,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As I popped the cap some cork soaked beer flew at me and there was carbonation flowing through the cork still. As my corkscrew began to spin into the cork, the cork started to fall apart. It eventually got through and the cork came out with a lot of pressure behind it. Pours a nice deep dark red color that looks like candy. There's a lot of carbonation and the head retains very well. The smell is of horse blanket that's not overly done. It also has a slight smell of cherries. There is a cork flavor that has been incorperated into the beer. There's horse blanket flavors, but not picking up on the cherries, just the sourness. The mouthfeel isn't harsh even though there was so much carbonation. Overall this was a very good kriek, but I expected more cherry flavors. I will have another ne sometime when I have an extra $15.","Erdinger2003","Feb 08, 2007"

The smell is of fresh sour cherries, a lambic tartness, and a touch of barnyard in the nose. Flavor is quite sour, but not as sharp as offerings from Cantillon. The lambic tartness and the sour cherry tartness blend to create a sourness that is sour, but not acetic. Tart and refreshing with fresh cherry flavors and a clean metallic finish that fades into light barnyard/cheese flavors. The mouthfeel is clean and light and quite refreshing. Quite drinkable- would be amazing on a hot summer day.","Georgiabeer","Jan 07, 2007"

Not much cherry intensity in the aroma, instead its more like a Gueuze. Vinegary, sour, lightly oakey, wild yeast notes. Excellent! The taste is much the same with a little more fresh cherry. The tartness is pleasant, and cetainly not overdone. Light body, with tight, sharp bubbles. This is an excellent Lambic. The cherry flavor hangs in the background and serves to balance out the tartness nicely. I'm very glad this wasn't overly sweet like many other examples.

Taste is very sour, funky, and full of dry cherries. This is no sweet lambic, but it's far more approachable than the Cantillon varieties. The mouth is very nice - medium bodied, and a bit tingly. It's definitely hard to drink on its own, but paired with food, it shines.

4.65,10.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,4,"750 mL green punted bottle with cork and crown. Lot no. 0005, best before September 2008. Before deciding to drink this tonight, I did a bit of research on Kriek De Ranke. I had no idea it was as rare as it is: 1500 bottles per year. I feel lucky to know at least three places nearby to buy it, all at around $15 each. The bottle was chilled and then set out to sweat for a few minutes before opening. The cork slid out easily enough and proved to be quite moist on the bottom. It feels really old-school to have this bottle sitting in front of me, completely bare with no label after the wrapping is removed... Poured into an Ommegang cervoise, this kriekenbier is a glowing, hazy ruby color with the palest of pink foam caps. Sour cherries are immediately apparent in the nose, along with some puckeringly tart brett aromas, all sharp and funkily tannic. Actually quite thrilling, to be honest. The sour cherries greet the palate at the beginning of the first sip, then they disappear, cowering before an incredibly aggressive smack of sour lambic funk. This really has an unbelievable flavor -- unmistakably a fruit beer, but so terribly dry and crisp I feel like I'm drinking a glass of wine. Honestly, this has the most bone dry finish of any beverage, period, I've ever tried -- save, perhaps a gueuze or two. The undeniable acridity of this beer increases as it warms, turning it into more of a sipper and less of a spring evening refresher, but it otherwise conveys a killer drinkability. I think I'll want to always have a bottle of this around for special occasions.","orfeu","Jun 01, 2006"

That being said, I love all of De Ranke's other beers but had not had this one until last night. It's great, as expected. Pours a ruddy, light brown color filled with ruby highlights and a nice pink wispy head. Really good looking beer here. Smells of sour cherries up front, with plenty of lemmon juice and a grassy, earthy, hayfield naturalness. Taste is tart and sour, but not overwhelmingly so, due to the sweetness of the fruit, even though they're tecnhically "sour" cherries. After the initial puckering effect however this beer becomes much more complex and offers all of those excellent grassy, wet hay, lambic funk characteristics. I like the way the beer chagnes a bit and becomes softer as it warms up, not that it should be too cold to begin with. Like I said before, I don't always drink lambics, but occasionally when I pick one up I'm always glad I did, as they're always interesting, delicious, and hedonistically good beers.

Tones of sweet hay and straw (yes, I have tasted hay and straw) give this beer a great flavor. The cherry is there, but subdued in the background behind the funk.

I didn't get much fruits in the aroma, but I know I liked it, just not as much as I hoped, perhaps some more cherry intensity would have been extremely benefiting for it and lead me to give it extremely high ratings. Ah! Yeah, after sipping now I understand, cherries are indeed there among more leather and dust. This is very yeasty, but that was expected. This is quite tart too, but that was expected too, I surprise myself hoping for more. Mild alcohol feel in middle-mouth. More yeasty cobwebs in the finish and a light bitter touch. Mouthfeel is thin-medium which fits well, but perhaps a touch too fizzy and carbonated. Overall, there are plenty of flavours I love in there, but I kept wishing they'd appear better blended in the next sip. It tastes old although it isn't (1.5yr). Definitely worth seeking out nevertheless, especially if you're a Fantôme fan, you'll find yourself enamored swiftly enough.

There are notes of wood, cherry, tannin, musty, leathery, and cherry stone in here. This is quite good, I was not expecting something so much like a lambic in character, I wonder what their other beers are like.
