"A little too much cough medicine flavor for me."
""
""
""
""
"Opened 2 batch 2 bottles together. Really jammy, however the aftertaste was slightly reminiscent of band-aids. Did not feel this one lived up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a world class beer from one of the best sour breweries in the world; I'd put this right up there with their Oude Gueuze Vintages as their best beer (never had Framboos), and one of the best sours I've had in a long time. Loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Then a medium funk and a good tart quality comes up. Oak cleans up the beer. A touch of sesame comes up. Not the most exciting Drie F or fruited  lambic, despite the hype."
"Not sure if we got an infected bottle but we had a large sour tasting last night and this was by far the worst of the bunch.  For lack of a better description, it smelled and tasted like band aids.  We have 10 people all agree on the assessment and we ended up drain pouring the remaining."
""
""
""

"Fantastic fruit flavor! If we're being picky, it's a little on the tart side and the carbonation is a bit distracting. But that's being really picky."

"Looks great, smells and tastes like a mix of Raspberries and Band Aids. 2013 vintage. Expected much better."

"curious that people freak out for this and happily drop 50 bucks a bottle for it. its good, but its also weird and has some unpleasant features i thought, although it definitely improves a lot as it opens up and warms up over time. the color is murky pink, muted and old looking, still with a nice bit of off white head on top and plenty of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. the nose is amazing, a nice mix of wood and the two fruits, with a slight edge going to the cherry in my opinion. nice funk levels, lots of lacto, dry, enticing, unique. the flavor starts off fine, like any other fruited lambic really, but it goes weird about halfway through. at first i start tasting iodine and band-aids, but it does beyond that to a novocaine almost hospital medicinal plasticy thing that lasts forever on the palate. not sure if this is denaturing fruit or weird bottle conditioning yeasty notes or what, but its intense and its sharp and its not very appealing. this drops out a bit after it warms up and breathes, and i also am getting used to it as i drink this beer, but it never really goes away, and i think its a distraction from the intended flavors of this beer. mouthfeel aside from the numbing aspect is nice, with a dry feel and big boy carbonation. the fruit and funk are great, and acidity is only mid range for the style. i like it more and more as i drink it, but to call this one of the best lambics going is a huge stretch for me. i appreciate it but dont love it at all."

"Verdict: A delightful lambic with an excellent representation of both cherries and raspberries. Despite being only 5%, the sour cherry really shines through and balances well with the raspberries and the touch of citrus zest really and mild funk emphasizes how delicate of a beer this is."

"Brief notes from a bottle tasting: dense fruit, raspberry forward. Jammy, syrupy and slightly medicinal. Some band-aid phenols. The funk is there in full force but takes a back seat to the fruit. I think it might benefit from some age. Overall a very nice lambic but not a favorite."
"Exquisite body flavor and carbonation. It was in my top 3 at a recent bottle share."

"O - Not sure if this bottle was off, but the numbing taste and sensation was really off-putting, I will have to re-review this one the next time I have it"

"O- probably the best beer i have had from 3f. Its sourness is matched perfectly by its sweet finish. Definitely worth the hype."

"Pours a light red color with a pink head and good clarity.  The aroma has faint dark cherries, tart wild yeasts and plenty of horse blanket stank.  The taste is very tart and fruity, nicely layered and sufficiently dry.  Oak tannins round out great notes of cherry and berry.  Long standing sour notes.  Light bodied crisp and satisfying.  This is world class lambic, seldom seen in my area."

"This is definitely a top notch beer. The balance of the fruit and sour flavors is very impressive, but other than that, not too much beyond what you’d expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I just don't get it.  Cherries and Raspberries don't complement each other.  Overall nose and taste is medicinal to me."
""
""
""

"Overall a great lambic, apart from the slight medicinal notes in the fruit (although this comes out more in the aroma than the taste)."

"The feel is sprite, light, bubbly and carbonated but not too sharp."

"I am a fan of Lambic's but nothing about this beer worked for me."
""
""
""
"Well, this was awfully disappointing. I assume this was a bad bottle. They had 4 of them there, but I only got a pour from one. No way this is what this beer is supposed to taste like. I'll have to revisit this one again if I can ever find it."

"Pours a deep, reddish purple like the color of cherries. An inch of pink infused cream colored head that holds pretty well. Head remains at the surface and a thick collar. Fair legs, and poor lacing. Aroma is a ton of cherry and an odd funk. Smells almost like cherry cough medicine. Taste is lightly tart, rich raspberry more than cherry flavor, and an oakiness. Medium body and high carbonation, with a fruit-like stickiness to the mouthfeel. Great beer, but the slight cough syrup-like quality is off putting in the aroma and flavor."

"I've noticed that people have noticed the ""band-aide"" presence in both the '07 and '13. I believe it might just be a matter of bottle variation with some of them having it and some of them not. I based my scores off the '07 we opened which was far superior to the '13 we had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, this bottle was something of a disappointment. I've heard many people say this is as good or better than Framboos, which I've not had the opportunity to try, but I have to think that either that's not true, or Framboos is significantly overrated. At any rate, I certainly wouldn't go after this particular beer again."

"O- what a fantastic beer, perfect to split with the wife. Went down much to quickly and easily, would love if this was an annual release. Biggest detracter is the price point, if u can bite that bullet your in for a real treat!"
"Tons of funk and tons of fruit. Sourness builds with each sip and reaches a nice Drie level with that authentic Lambic presence."
"Overall - Really good. Quality fresh+sour fruit and funk flavors, very very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is quite possibly the second best fruit lambic I've ever enjoyed, behind only Cantillon's Fou' Foune. They are hard to compare to one another due to the different fruits utilized, but this one is outstanding, with aggressive notes of oak and funk alongside a fantastically ripe raspberry element. It's too bad this bottle costs so much and is only produced ever several years, because it is truly amazing."
"Drink- Its very good. I like it. I'll just call it Wælsbro and say I spent too much for this, but tickers gonna tick. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, I may have overpaid but novare res had it and I didn't, so I pulled the trigger.  No regrets either. Phenomenal from top to bottom. Just layers and layers of sensory satisfaction. The raspberry is dominant over the cherry,  but allows a (yet another) layer of flavorthat doedoesn't come from either fruit alone. Super funky with big raspberry tartness.  As it warms the tart mellows and the bottom of the bottle gets better and better. Just heaven."

"O- I had extraordinarily high expectations considering the $40 price tag I payed for this, but I was very impressed. Worth every penny"
"O- very fruit-forward right now young; I'd have to imagine this will be even better in a few years. I'd lay down any other bottles you have right now for a while- this is a lot like how VSB drank out of the gates- a bit rough around the edges, but transforms into a worldbeater a year later. Yet, this is phenomenal even fresh."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The fruit is really intense in the nose, but the lambic shines in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dotss of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, funk, cherry, and raspberry aromas. Taste is much the same with super sour cherry, raspberry, and funk flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with really nice sour fruit and funk qualities all around."
""
"O - This is definitely good stuff, but I can't see myself trading my cellar to get more of it. Fruitier and less aggressively blue cheese than the fou'foune, mamouche, and golden doesjel which I drank in the same session"
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark red beer. A little foam forms and dissipates quickly. Normal aroma, fruits, lambic, bretts. Taste is very uniform, it is sour, raspberries, and not dry at all. A bit on the syrupy side, but still very enjoyable."

"Armand has once again knocked it out of the park. The fruit tandem in Hommage gives the beer a bit of a heafty upstart without being malty or sweet. Its the perfect balance and layers of complexity that take sour ale to irresistible levels."

"Bottle 2013 vintage drank one year later. Pour a thick burgundy red with very low head. Aroma is fruity and nicely showcases raspberries, blackberries and cherries. Definitly funky, decent horseblanket presence. Menthol notes reminds me of old 3F lambics. Taste is rich raspberries and cherries. Intense sourness, mostly citric, is balanced by fruity sweetness. Full bodied and rather low carbonation which accentuates the richness of this fruit lambic. This is not your everyday fruit lambic, it is however wonderfully complex for a lambic this age. 4.3"

"EDIT: The last glass of Hommage was the best anything I have ever had. The dreg hits once again."
"O- This wasn't at all what I was expecting, but the fruit, barrel and funk are all really interesting and different. The aroma alone is pretty incredible. A really wonderful beer."
""
"Taste: fruity start, raspberries, very sour, quite cheesy as well , aftertaste is burning sourness, bit cheesy, little dirty, raspberry jam, bit metallic."
"O: Easily one of the best beers I have had. Was hard not to drink it down too quickly. Didn't expect the fruit to taste as fresh considering it is six years old."
""
""
""
"Was very fortunate to procure this bottle, and slay my #1, personal ""white whale""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured a deep cherry red. Nose was straight up raspberry jam. A delicate balance between cheese funk, sweetness from the raspberry and tartness. By far the most complex out of the three bottles we had. Although well balanced flavors, all of the flavors were explosive."
"Overall. A fantastic lambic that has probably lost a lot of it's fruit flavour going by the ingredients. Worth the $70? No, but what beer is. A fun experience for sure."
"This is clearly a well-crafted lambic. I thought that raspberries would be the dominant fruit, but I was not disappointed that the cherries came through so strongly. The plastic flavor in the flavor was enough for me to knock down the flavor and overall score, but everything else was solid."
""
"750 ml bottle generously shared by cpferris. Big thanks to Chad. Pours a reddish amber with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is lots of cherry, some raspberry, a light medicinal note, and funky oak. The initial taste is sweet with some cherry and raspberry. There is also lots of funky oak and a light medicinal note. The finish is tart and funky. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Quite Tasty."
""
""
""
""
"o - overall unreal beer. just phenomenal. one of the highlights of an INSANE day."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a rusty brown with no head. The nose is a ripe, almost rotten, tomato that's very potent and possesses almost no sour. No additional fruit comes through. The taste changes to a beefy sour, but seems more like drinking a V8 with some gueuze mixed in. It almost tastes like rasberry, but not quite. The aftertaste is a slightly vegetal/fruity with an interesting bitterness that lingers. It's very drinkable regardless and presents an unlikely mix of both vegetable and fruit. Worth trying again, but I wouldn't hold onto this beer any longer..."
""
"O-I think a lot of the slack this beer gets is unwarranted. It holds up very well to Framboos and despite having some plastic character to it, it doesn’t detract much from the beer. It’s an incredibly good lambic and one I look forward to having again."
""
""
"O: A delicious beer for sure! Not quite as good as Framboos, but this is very nice, smooth, and refreshing - very easy to drink."
""
"Overall: This is a very good fruit lambic. It might have been a bit better a year or two ago, but still very nice. I probably won't have it again, but not because I wouldn't be willing."
"O-- Sick ass beer. Was fun to savor one of the highlights of the night was to have this."
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely one of the most interesting beers I've ever had. Nice acidity and fruit presence, though the slight plastic presence is distracting. Still, very enjoyable in small quantities."
"OVERALL: Completely not wasted on me. This was the only sour I gladly went back for a second pour on. I will admit that I didn’t expect this to be that good. However, the fruit flavors were delicious and decadent, and the sourness played unbelievably well with the fruit component. Perhaps a little one dimensional if I’m honest with myself, but that one dimension is definitely other-worldly. Look forward to the day I get to drink this one again. Thanks again for sharing Ron and Jeroen. This was a game changer."
"Cheers!"
""
"Thanks to jh1982 for bringing this whale to the party."
""
"O: Very good"
"O - This beer really did live up to its reputation, changing nearly every time I took a sip. The pucker is strong but it is still manageable. I hope they do make this again, I would love to try it fresh."
"All is forgiven upon the first sip. This Lambic is heavenly in flavor, with a super tart lactic punch to the sides of the tongue offset by a decadent, funky raspberry jam note in the middle. Mouthfeel is dry, tart, and refreshing with a perfect carbonation level. Overall, an amazing beer; I am grateful that I got the opportunity to try Hommage. It's a shame the nose hadn't held up, but the deliciousness more than makes up for that fact. Thanks again Michael!"
"O - My favorite 3F fruit lambic to date. The nose was not as good as it could have been, but age might have something to do with that. Saying that, the 2007 Vintage we opened was not nearly as funky in the nose as the Hommage. I wish I was sitting on 3+ like some people, but a alas this was my only bottle."
"This is a tart brew that is very funky. It is medium bodied with a modest level of carbonation. A very solid salivation factor follows each sip of this brew and there is seemingly no alcohol inclusion. It was nice to finally get a chance to try this brew and for that I say thank you Nate. With talks of this being released again, I look forward to seeing the difference with a more fresh bottle. Regardless, this one is worth seeking out."
"Overall this is an incredible sour beer, plenty of fruit with the sour flavor pushing the envelope yet still so drinkable you want to go back again and again. The fruit flavors are great with subtle oakiness, a really top notch example."
"i enjoyed this, was one of my favorites for the night. very interesting flavors and not overly raspberry forward."
""
""
""
"I hate to compare to the Coolship Red we had earlier, but it's inevitable: that brew was on a higher level. This one is good, but doesn't quite get to that top tier. Really glad to try it."
"O: Solid, I like this more than other framboises or krieks I've had, good acidity, fruit and wood balance is nice, excellent depth, good dirtiness, complex and long finish"
"Overall a majestic beer that I am delighted to try. From one of my favorite breweries, I would expect no less. 5"
"Pours a pinkish-red color - similar to a rose’ - with a thin cap of head. Carbonation bubbles stream up the side. The smell is incredible on this - pungent raspberry jam is dominant with a faint barrel funk. The taste is more sour and lactic with the fruit falling towards the end, but still quite prevalent after 4 years of sitting in the bottle. Tart lemons, balsamic vinegar, and fairly acidic but not overwhelming and quite balanced. A moderate level of carbonation keeps things lively on the acidic and keeps things refreshing. Overall one of the best sours that I've had - an almost perfect balance of fruit and sour and very glad that I was able to get a bottle - and given the scarcity, will likely be the last one I’ll come across."

"Had this many times since it's release back in the summer of 2007. The appearance was very nice but short lived with the Hazy reddish-orange thin pink head. Aroma is raspberries, sourness and slight mild acidic nose. But as I drank more bottles over time, it they became more and more medicinal phenolics and a touch of plastic notes (Band-aids). A little dry with a solid lactic tartness, woody raspberry pit note, and a medicinal / phenolic finish that doesn’t come on quite as strong as it did in the nose. Mouthfeel gets used to the acidity and funk as the raspberry notes pick up in intensity a bit. Still a kind of dry with a raspberry pulp flavor with touches of cherry skins to it. Carbonation is definitely on the light side! Hopefully the next batch will produce a much more fruity smell and taste and not the phenolic/band-aid aromas."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was very impressed with this. After all the other great beers this one really stood out."
"Holding up quite well. Phenolics could make this bad, but they are in check enough to let the rest of the beer speak for itself."
"Extremely tasty, very tart on the first taste but maybe a little sweeter at the end of the bottle. I think it actually tasted better once the darker sediment was in the glass, deep fruity sweetness balanced very well by the acetic bite. I could drink a lot more of this, so good."
"Notes from 8/12/11. 750ml. Thanks to beddachedda or westcoastbeerlvr (not quite sure). Second time that I’ve tried it and this glass seemed better, somehow. Pours a cloudy golden pink. Aroma is a big and wonderful sour raspberry flavor - the sour cherries just seem to punch up the berry flavor - with some nice funk, mildly cheesy. Taste has a lot of sourness and is quite dry, at this point. Tons of berries and funk on the palate. Everything comes together well. Pretty good pucker - ~7/10. Otherwise, the mouthfeel is appropriate to the style, not too effervescent but fairly light. Tried at the same time as Malvasia and preferred that one but only by a small margin. Another excellent lambic from 3F."
"O: Amazing complex raspberry flavor that is just awesome. Very well put together. Definitely one of the greats."
"O: Not always a big framboise fan, but this was pretty damn good."
"Overall: One of the best!"
"O- this is a great beer and has change in some interesting ways according to some. The fruits still give it to ya and the sour funky goodness is kickass."
"O- Overall, this was a treat, but I would doubt I could get through a whole bottle at this time. This is a different machine than the scharbeekese, which Im not entirely sure is a fair comparison."
"O: Amazing sour, really delicious and drinkable. Great fruit presence is balanced really well by all the funk and tartness. Absolutely delicious."
"Shared by fellow lambic enthusiast Weisguy for our small sour tasting. 750ml Valentine’s Day 2007 bottling ♥ Hommage pours medium amber red and not too dark to see through. The smell is crazy! I get very rotten, sweet fruit--especially raspberry--along with funky puke, poop, rhubarb & cheese. The taste definitely connects to the smell, but is much less offensive to me with tons of funky raspberry & hearty fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is not very dry, but a bit sweet. Not very close to what I was expecting and in a negative way because it was hard to get passed the smell. I think this may have been an off bottle or improperly stored. Will re-review if I get to try it again."
"Poured into my Russian River ""tion"" glass and this beer appears quite oily with a rather vibrant reddish brown appearance capped with just a slight bit of off-white head. Leaves some lace and looks very oily in the glass. I heard and read the descriptor ""band-aid"" used to when characterizing various funky beers, but up until this one I had never actually experienced in first hand. Smells exactly like a band-aid and this is quite musty and funky on the nose. Some aspects are appealing while other are a little off-putting. Getting some fruit in the form of raspberries that were perhaps sitting in someone basement wrapped in a ace bandage for a decade or two. The smell is unique enough and enticing enough to warrant a higher score than I might usually give for a bouquet as foul as this. Taste is certainly an improve as the band-aid has taken a backseat and the fruit, funk, tart, and sour qualities make a push to the forefront. Earthy raspberries are the focus and dare I say that the smell and the taste are worlds apart with the taste being highly superior. Very nice mouthfeel with spot-on carbonation. A nice lambic, but not necessarily earth-shattering in anyway."
"Pour yields a bright red body with a thin white head that nearly immediately fades to a thin collar around the edges. The nose brings forward some slight earth along with quite a bit of musty raspberry. In the background, there's a bit of light oak. Overall, the nose is kind of like a damp vineyard. There's a bit of bandaid lingering in the background of the nose, though this disappears in the flavor. Taste has a good amount of raspberry and damp earth. Light wood and a moderate amount of acidity. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a sour, dry finish. Not too much funk anywhere, more toward a light earthiness. Overall, a very nice beer with the mouthfeel as the highlight."
"Appearance: an amber red color with a light pink head which turns to a nice lacing. Smell: whooaahhh.... This must be the best smelling lambic I ever had. The waitress was not even close to the table and I could already smell it. Raspberry upfront, extremely natural smell. Funk is there nicely blended with some citrus notes. Taste: Lives up to the smell. Raspberries but hardly any (fruit)sugar there. Fine notes of strawberry, brett, citrus and some wooden tones. Mouthfeel: a very refreshing, medium carbonated, medium bodied and crisp drink. Drinkabillity: everything about this beauty is just awesome. Extremely well balanced. Another absolute masterpiece of Armand. Hats off!"
"The beer is ruby hued with an oily, thin head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very musty, funky, and fruity. Dank basement comes to mind. The flavor is quite tart, with plenty of raspberries and a hint of cherries. Also a bit of oddness and bandaids, though these characteristics don't completely overrun the beer. The finish brings a puckering sensation in the cheeks (the ones on your face). A quality lambic. Recommended."
"O: A masterful stroke of the brewing arts. One of the best fruit lambics ever made"
"Overall this beer is would be world class if not for that one off-flavor. Can't wait to give it another shot."
"D-this has a nice little balance to it. not the funk I would have expected from a drie fonteinen beer but the fruit flavor is very pronounced. actually more acidic than I thought it would be but not burning. the body is so juicy and creamy on the palate it is very inviting. the flavors are subtle and well integrated."
"Very drinkable. Tasty and smooth with a nice solid bite of sour tartness. Not exactly everything I was hoping for, but quite good nonetheless."
"Pinkish-ruby pour with a thin head that fades into a thin ring. Big, in-your-face aroma: Raspberries, plastic/bandaid funk, vinegar, and vinous. Flavor follows the nose with a big tart raspberry juiciness and leathery/earthy funk. Very sour beer. Bubbly on the tongue with a dry, funky finish. The funk was almost off-putting at first, but I found myself being unable to put this one down."
"D- Although this was very good I dont know I could finish a bottle myself, but I would certainly try."
"drinkability is great. great depth and balance. good sourness. a kick-ass sour!"
"Pours a deep rust color with a very light haze and thin white head. Head retention is light around the edges. Super funky with lots of red wine vinegar on the nose. Quite sharp and acetic with big tart raspberry aromas coming through as it warms. Taste is dominated by tart and lightly sweet fresh raspberries and huge funky notes. Lighter oak and vanilla sweetness on the finish mixed in with raspberry and funk. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation and a lightly sweet and tart finish. Drinkability isn't extremely high on this one, but it's very complex and enjoyable nonetheless."
"D - Welp, color me impressed. This went beyond my expectations and is right up there with any other lambic I've had in the past. Yet another winner from 3F. Awesome."
"4/4.5/5/4/4"
"This is quite close to perfect, perhaps the best ""fruit"" beer I ever had."
"2007 bomber - thanks to Yves Panneels for helping me track this beer down. Shared with buds this weekend. Pours a cloudy, cherry red with a small foamy head. Great nose of tart fruit and raspberry. Nicely carbed. A little wood and mineral flavor adds to the sweetness.. Has an insane amount of berries floating on the palate, mixing with the funk to make this a fantastic fruit lambic for me. Yummy stuff!"
"D - I've had this a number of times, and it never fails to disappoint. It's worth every penny, even with the exorbitant price tag. Extremely well-balanced and integrated flavor profile, with loads of fresh raspberry - what's not to love?"
"D - Good stuff, can be a sipper as it is so tart/funky that you kind of have to drink it slowly."
"Thanks to Alex for sharing this on Bry's birthday. 750ml bottle served in a Bells tulip...A reddish mud brown water poor, light pink head, good retention...The aroma is great with a ton going on. Funky, a super fresh and most accurate raspberry taste, there is also a distinct aroma of strawberries. The funk is the perfect amount...Taste is great, funky, the exact amount of puckering tartness to make you happy but not so much you can't drink the whole bottle yourself. Light sweetness adds to a great drinkability."
"After having several of these I would conclude that this is a really impressive fruit lambic, one of the best I've had. However, the acidity had increased significantly with age and I don't see it improving any further. At about 1.5 years this was stunning."
"Overall, this was a great beer. It would have been even better had it not had the medicinal flavors in the aftertaste. This one is very drinkable. I am curious to know what the next batch will be like."
"D: Quite a treat. Looking forward to Hommage's return in the near future."
"Really liked this one, I must track down some bottles for the cellar! Trade me some!"
"Beer is thin and strongly acetic. Finishes dry ultimately with this odd bitterness in there. Very drinkable although I imagine the high sourness would eventually get to me. Mouthfeel is good."
"D: What separates Belgian lambics from their American counterparts is the immense amount of complexity that separates itself from the funk, wood, and earth that are present as a result of the bacteria. This is a prime example. An amazing beer that really shows off European fruit lambic handywork. Outstanding. Definitely give this a try if its ever available."
"D: Very nice beer. Super easy to drink."
"Tasted from bottle at Lush CBC event courtesy of Dr. Bill. Pours red-orange with a thin pink head. The nose is of Kirsch cherries, sour apple and raspberry, and vinegar. The flavor is a drying sour with cherry, raspberry, and bitter blood orange. There is also a bit of a sweet grenadine on the mid-palate. The carbonation is very much alive with a medium, almost tannic body. The finish is very long with cherry flavor. This is an amazing beer that I feel lucky to have tasted. Thank you Dr. Bill!"
"Overall, one of my favorite beers of the tasting, right alongside Deviation and Blauw. Can't wait to give this beer another try."
"D: Weighing in at 6% or so, this is a sessionable dream. I'm glad I splurged, the lambic did not disappoint."
"D: Nope, I really hope this one is infected."
"D - I was a little hesitant to spend this much on a beer but it is worth every penny. Extremely smooth sourness with a boatload of raspberry goodness."
"Ohhhh myyy goddd!!!! This is unbelievably good! Pours a delicious looking cloudy red with big head that instantly recedes to form a ring at the top. No lace, as to be expected. Smells like the Clone of Dr. Funkenstein! Musty wood, sweet raspberry, wet earth, and a touch of broccoli (???). Tastes of raspberry and wood with slight chocolate notes. It's sour sweet and tart all at the same time! There's little to no astringency, but a zing that you could associate with raspberry soda. Very balanced, the taste of the raspberry isn't masked by the sourness at all. What's wonderful about this is the fact that the fruit really shines here and the sour is almost secondary. This is the best lambic I think I've ever had!"
"Pretty much the main beer I went to Novare to try and it didn't disappoint at all."
"Palate awesomely dry and sharp. Really stays with you. An awesome fruit lambic overall, one of the best I've tried yet."
"Drinkability is top of the line, not just for lambics, but for all beer. Nothing short of miraculous."
"D-Without question one of the most odd, interesting, sour, dry, astringent and complex brews I have ever had. It is such an amazing train wreck of flavours you are urged to come back time after time for another sip. I doubt I could ever drink this with regularity---I value my taste buds!---but to sit and enjoy a bottle with friends, absolutely!"
"I can't believe how sour this beer has become with the aging. I wish I could have tried this fresh to see how prominent the berries were. Either way this beer is very complex with lots of delicious flavors bouncing off of one another. I picked something else up with each sip. I'm not the biggest fan of raspberry beers or raspberries for that matter but this beer was very impressive. All sour heads should seek this one out."
"""Dill pickle... sorry. A bucket of pickles."""
"I drank the entire 750ml OK but, unlike the Blabaer, there were no tears when the bottle was empty, and I quickly moved on. I'm wondering whether a different bottle of Hommage may have given a different story? As somebody else said, pretty good, but something missing?? Will have to try another one :o)"
"4.5/4.5/4.5"
"Drinkability: I would score it higher but the amount of tartness, dryness, and acidity holds it back."
"This was a really nice bright pink color with a tenacious head that was only slightly less colorful. The smell was delicious raspberries with a hint of lambic. The flavor was really outstanding like eating raspberry jam with huge chunks of raspberries. The fruit component was fantastic. i didn't detect much funkiness and it was only slightly tart but overall I was very impressed. This is probably the best fruit lambic I have had if not a close second to Cantillon Fou Foune. Amazing beer."
"Good stuff, probably the most sour of the 3F beers I have had. Difficult to come by, and personally I would buy a couple bottles of the Oude Kriek to drink instead of going out of my way to find another bottle of this. Delicious though. Cheers!"
"Overall blown away here. I have alot of sours to go through in the coming week and this was the start of it. I have to say, I am simply thrilled. The price of this one makes it a bit difficult to follow through on but I have to say it will be oh soo worth it in the end."
"Beautiful clear ruby red color with a white head that sits atop it. Head falls gracefully until it just sticks around the glass. Aroma is largely of raspberries, but almost like a very light raspberry. I mean that in the sense that it isn't the over the top flavor and slight astringency one would get from actually eating a raspberry, it's more like a raspberry juice was used. There's also some definite cheesy notes in this that I find a bit distracting; various barnyard funk notes are also perceptible, but hidden beneath to me, which is unfortunate. Taste is another story, I actually enjoy it qutie a bit. Same thing again with the raspberry taste, there's no slightly astringent, kick-you-in-the-face raspberry flavor that I love, but it is enjoyable. Lactic tartness is one of the other things that comes right to the forefront, followed by some very pleasing funkiness. If this funkiness and/or the raspberries were a touch stronger, this beer would be much better, especially if some of the cheesy notes were no longer coming through in the nose. About medium carbonation with a decent body on the tongue, followed by a nice dry finish. A good beer that I'd surely have another of, however, price and availability do limit that."
"*NB - the raspberries are much more subdued in this one than I expected, would not age it further."
"D: I don't remember what this cost, so I'm able to judge this purely on the ""would I have this again?"" criterion. Yes, I would. I really enjoyed it and thought it was a phenomenal beer, even while triple-fisting it next to Toronado 20th and Cable Car. Please don't tell me how expensive this was."
"Taste is more sour fruit and a lot less funky. A decent amount of sour/tartness comes through in the flavor. Personally, I would like more funk and less fruit, I guess aging my bottle should accomplish this. Decent beer."
"Overall, probably one of the best brews that I've tried to-date, and certainly the best I've had in the style."
"D: This is a fantastic beer. Great, razor sharp fruit profile and clean flavors. Good balance between the fruits and the rustic lambic flavors. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"The carbonation is spot on for this beer, and is very well done. As for drinkability, I could drink this anytime anywhere. Unfortunately the hefty price tag prevents this..."

"Perhaps my favorite of this brewery's offerings."
"Overall, I am glad I got to try this gem. It was very good, but we all thought it was lacking something. I would love to get another and lay it down in the cellar."
"Consumed last weekend at The Trappist for a paltry $46, reviewed from memory, woo. Hazy pinkish-purple color, pours with almost no head, though there's plenty of carbonation for the style. The aroma is largely macerated raspberries, backed by a mild funk and an odd note of tomato juice. The raspberry aroma on this beer is phenomenal, I couldn't keep my nose out of the glass. The taste is similarly exceptional - raspberries are dominant, faintly sweet up front, sour in the finish. Sourness is moderate, while harsh acetic acids are minimal. Light in body, puckering and dry. Amazing stuff."
"8/5/8/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"Pours candy pink, with pinkish-white cloudy big head. Smells funky, alcohol though low, penetrates the nose. Great mouthfeel,the sourness is there but well delivered without being over the toip (moderated by oak) raspberries lambic bullseyes the style. Satisfying aftertaste. Oh so drinkable."
"Notes from and tasted on 10/11/2007."
"Bottle purchased in the Netherlands. Beer poured a clear, deep red color with a slight pink head into my Cantillon glass. The head receeded quickly. The aroma was strong upon popping the cork, vibrant framboise, a bit funky and tart as well. The raspberry taste was lovely and fresh tasting. What you would expect for a true version of the style. Some oaky notes as well. Overall a well rounded and damn fine beer that I wish I had more often but it is to be savored."
"I really loved the funky fruit character of this lambic. It blew away my expectations..."
"Pours a dense cranberry color with a very light thin head. Smell is funky, tart, cherries, and oak. Flavor is lightly funky, tart cherries and vinegar with a medium body. I got more cherry than raspberry from it. Pretty good and nicely sour."
"Nicely tart, but the action really came through on the funky character of this beer. Really nice. Great composition of fruit lustrous aromas and Thanks to DA for dropping some cash and bringing it to share. Defiantly worth sharing at a tasting."
"Pours a clouded pink with a pinkish head. Nose is funky. Barnyard-esqe. Flavor has a biting raspberry to it, but still it's smooth. This just typifies what a fruit lambic is. Feel is spot on. Overall this is precisely what I would expect it to be. Amazing stuff and masterfully crafted. I'm not really sure where there could be improvement. Perhaps a bit more framboise complexity? Regardless. Who cares. It's beautiful. Worth the high price."
"Deep magenta color. Rich fruit flavor, it's nice to taste an authentic raspberry fruit flavor. I havent felt like I've had a good raspberry lambic in awhile, even with rose and oud beersel framboise. I don't love this beer, but it's a nice lambic style."
"Drinkability: Fairly mellow and easy-going for a lambic. Very nice."
"Not as intensely fruity as I was perhaps expecting, and it is on the soft side for a traditional Lambic (even for a 3 Fonteinen one). A bit harder, with a more pronounced fruit character would make this just about perfect. It seems to be missing that jam-like (sans sweetness of course) fruit intensity that I was expecting, though I like that this is quite dry and quaffable. Still this is a very good beer, though I have a feeling this won't age nearly as well as the Framboos has / did."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sour, with phenols of funky plastic, and exotic plants."
"Drinkability: The sourness is pretty intense, but I could get through a bottle by myself to savor the beer. Worth seeking out, but it isn't available in the states yet."
"Cheers!"
