It pours a brilliant rose with a quickly dissipating pinkish white head that produces fine light lace. Cranberry leads the attack on the palate with a big lemony tart finish spiced with cinnamon. Long, lingering lemony cranberry tastes. Has a very prickly effervescence. Good balance between the initial sweetness and the finishing lemony tartness.","pat61","Oct 27, 2014"

Aroma of toffee, caramel, oak, even some chocolate, along with the expected cranberry fruit. Smells pretty rich, not a huge lacto tartness here that I would expect from something claiming to be in the lambic style. Flavor is lots of funky cranberries, plenty of sweet caramel malt, oak, and a bit of metallic oxidation. On the sweeter side with light tartness from the fruit. Medium plus body with high prickly carbonation. Very much in the style if their big fruit beers, and less so in the lambic/wild/sour category. nevertheless, a nice little fruit beer.","BMMillsy","Oct 17, 2014"

Not a bad thing, but I was expecting more of a trad -lambic with some cranberry imparted in the flavor. Hopefully some age will drop out the sweetness a bit and make the base beer shine more.","guityler83","Sep 07, 2014"
