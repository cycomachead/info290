review_text
"Has a huge strawberry nose with traces of tartness. It pours pinkish, reddish amber with s slight haze under a white ¼” finely bubbled foam cap. The palate starts failrly sweet then finishes with a touch of tart and big strawberry from start to finish. Drinkable but a little too sweet for my tastes."

"O: good for style but could be more complex and a touch more tart."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/30/2012. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lightly tart strawberry, strawberry jam/candy, hay, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with big notes of sweet strawberries and some light yeast and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big lightly tart strawberry, strawberry jam/candy, hay, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big strawberries, strawberry jam/candy, hay, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice robustness of big sweet strawberry flavors with some light yeast and earthy hop notes; with minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected for 4%. Overall this is a really solid standard fruit beer. Nice robustness of big strawberry flavors with light yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. It really doesn’t fit the Lambic style profile very well at all; but as a standard fruit beer it is quite enjoyable, as long as you don’t mind the sweetness(which wasn’t that bad in my opinion)."

"Overall: quite a nice lambic - very natural strawberry fruits that aren't as overly sweet as some, being balanced with earth malts and lemon citrus tartness. The price being over AU$130 a case of 24 (2014) is a little prohibitive however."

"people hate on timmermans for no reason. i mean, sure, its a level or two below the best of the best lambic types, but its a very approachable version, a possible gateway to the real good stuff, and more widely available than some of the really special ones. it serves a role. this one is very strawberry heavy, to the point where the yeast and grains are less detectable. similar in that regard to the framboise they do. pale red tint to the pour and a nose of fresh strawberry jam. it is very sweet, which detracts from drinkability, but the fruit is authentic, if a bit overdone. great carbonation cleans it up pretty well though, and in general i like this much better than some of the other common strawberry bombs coming out of belgium. i think this is a cool beer, and one that may turn people on to more tart and acidic traditional lambics, although this one is lacking much of that character. fun beer, not world class cellaring beer. thats okay sometimes."

"Overall, I didn't have high expectations. So, the fact that I found it rather curious and I finished it, says a lot. Definitely liked it better than I thought I would. Worth a try."

"O: Really like this, my first strawberry lambic. Would go well with fruity desserts and creamy cheese. Complex and interesting."

"One of their better sours. More fruit presence here."

"Pours a hazy light reddish-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of those cheap strawberry candies, strawberry syrup, and a slight aroma of the strawberry flavored medicine made for children. Taste is much the same with slightly sour strawberry candy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but slightly artificial with the strawberry presence and quite sugary."

"Hmmmm, so-so. Drinkable enough, and the sweetness allows it to go down easily, but it certainly isn't a quality lambic. The chunky sediment is rather vile. Smells nice, if one-dimensional, but the flavour has some vague off-notes that detract from the overall character. The body also has something that isn't quite right; a sort of dry viscosity that feels somehow artificial. An OK brew if you want something sweet and fruity, but falls far short of the true potential of lambic."

"Overall this was good. My wife thought it was excellent."

"When I opened the 25cl, bottle I immediately smelled the strawberries. Colour is orangy, like a regular gueuze beer. Flavour is pre-dominantly sour, strawberry flavour is there, but discretely. Glad it isn't one of those extremely sweet beers, it is sour but moderately. Nice refreshing beer to drink on a hot summer day."
""
""
"O: Just a so-so lambic – I’ve had much better."
""
""
""
"O- The big candy flavor is all artificial strawberry and there is no malt or hops to challenge it. The carbonation helps to cut the sweetness a bit but it is not enough."
"Smaller bottle helps with the enjoyment. Have this with some cheesecake."
""
"Low C-"
""
""
"O: The flavor and aroma of the beer is just a little too sweet (artificial) for my preference. Pretty easy to drink but a little too sweet to be sessionable."
"Body is medium, effervescence is light, just wafting across the tongue. A solid lambic but not a standout."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a three finger white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, strawberry, cream, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, sugar, cream, strawberry, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I had this one a little while back out of the bottle and really enjoyed it. However, the on draught version left something to be desired. There was more of an earthy note on the nose that was a little abrasive with all the other aspects going on here. The flavor was very light which made it easy to drink, but not the most enjoyable thing I drank this night. I would suggest this to a new craft beer drinker that was a fan of fruit, but for the refined Lambic drinker, I wouldn't bother with it on tap."

"Taste calms the sweetness down and a little bit of tartness and some earthy yeast/malt comes out. I actually kind of like it, although admittedly, I tend to like fruit beers from time to time. This one is not as cloyingly sweet as some and there is a light touch of funk underneath...maybe because it is 2 years old...is a welcome addition. ""Belgium's Finest Limbic Beer"" it is not, but a nice little fruit beer? Sure, I'll be happy to quaff this again."
""
"O - Lambics are not my usual thing so take it with a grain of salt but I don't think this is something I'd go for again."
"Overall, I liked this beer the most of all the other fruit beers I had had. I've tasted the Samuel Adams strawberry and raspberry beers, but this one I enjoyed the most. I would definitely have another one. Even right now! This is one of those beers you can drink a whole six pack (if they sold it) in one session. Recommended if you want to try a fruit beer but don't know where to start."
""
"The super-sweet fruit beers like these are what gives fruited lambics and other well made fruit-forward ales a bad wrap. While the beer tastes much more like a wine cooler than a beer, It's slightly embarrassing to find it beside better beers in the craft beer section of the store."
""
"Definitely backsweetened. Lots of strawberry flavors (I may even git a tiny hint of natural flavors). I stand by strawberries and cream. Candied sugar sweet. Its like a Lindemans lambic. Fantastic dessert beer for sure. but in terms of lambics, its missing any kind of funk or acidity."

"Overall a very sweet and tart Lambic that was mildly refreshing. It’s a brew that would be great mixed with a good imperial stout..."
""
"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a somewhat cloudy red orange amber. Thin head, but some lacing. Strong strawberry aroma with some funky notes. Flavor is sweet, strawberry juice prominent. Sweet-sour finish. Pleasant and drinkable. No complexity and not a great lambic. Perhaps a bit cloying to drink a lot of this at a sitting, but I enjoyed this glass."
"Overall: a decent beer if you're into strawberry lambics. Otherwise, you will probably not find anything in here to like."
"M. Lively carbonation but a heftier medium-thick body make for a disturbingly oxymoronic mouthfeel in this ‘beer’. Feels more like a thicker cream soda in texture than any beer I’ve ever had. Definitely not worth the sticker price for me, I can’t recommend it."
"O - This has alright drinkability. It goes down pretty good, and has decent flavor. It has too much sweetness though. Really, it just doesn't stand up to most of the lambics out there. It has no sourness or funkiness. If you want a sweet strawberry, you have found it. My girlfriend did love it though."

"Pours a ruddy golden strawberry blonde color, closer to the color of the bottle than the foil wrapper. I smell strawberry puree, and taste something akin to a strawberry jammy flavor mixed with a basic Belgian pale ale. Cloyingly sweet, effervescent, with a dry finish. I’m really not excited about this, and I still have two more bottles left."
"Wonderful smell, horrible taste. Can't recommend spending the money just to smell it. Pass on this one."
"Smells of pints and pints of ripened fresh fruit. Pours a hazy garnet colored body with frothy white,but,short lasting head. Laces glass continuosly.Tastes of tart strawberry; it's a liquid dessert!"
"O: To call this a lambic is a disgrace to the style."
"This poured out as a pink color with a fizzy white head on top that leaves not retention or lacing on the glass. The smell is like a strong slightly sour strawberry soda. Very sweet taste here, not much of a sour flavor of tartness at all in this one. The mouthfeel is a little bubbly but mostly feels a little watered down despite the strength of the flavor. Overall it's more like strawberry candy in a glass or something."
"Overall-- this is too sweet, not tart enough, and just not really good. I will buy some more of the framboise for my wife, but will be passing on this one."
"As with the other Timmermans lambic that I tried (the framboise), it is overly sweetened-quite reminiscent of strawberry fruit snacks. Overall a bad representation of a fruit lambic with no wild or tart character-it is entirely one dimensional. Tasty, but I can get Welch's Strawberry soda for a fraction of the price."
"Poured into a tulip snifter. A ruddy reddish color with a small cap of head that did retain decently well. Aroma filled up the whole side of the bar with sweet and sour strawberries. In the taste, good fresh strawberry flavor and a small tartness. Semi-sweet upfront greeted by a nice restrained sour tang of wild yeast funk. Has all the trademarks of a good fruit lambic, mild sour, complimentary fruit, mildly effervescent, smooth and easy to drink. Overall, I was happy with this little find. A decent lambic, if you dig strawberry which I do."
"The first sip was the best, it all went down hill from there. It is light and heavily carbonated on the palate and sweet, very sweet, with a lot of fruit but the more I drank the dryer it got, the dryer it got the more sulfur and cloying it got. By the end I regretted this experiment and my sweet tooth. I won't bother having it again."
"$5 a bottle, can't recommend it. Unless you just like to smell beers."
"Taste is light sweet strawberry up front with light rustic, earthy yeasty character underneath, and a juicy, lively, zesty light tartness. It’s dryish, not overly sweet, crisp and zesty but the character is all a bit light and subdued and there is not enough “lambic” rustic character for me."
"I really had no clue what to expect going into this beer, it was an interesting Lambic but really sweet and artificial tasting for my likings. My girlfriend felt the same way. It's nothing I'd order again."
"Thanks to schmittymack for bringing this one over a couple weeks back. Poured a light brown color with a head a shade or so lighter. Aromas of artificial strawberry mostly, some sweetness and candy. On the palate this one is light bodied and unimpressive, with syrupy sweet artificial strawberry and candy sweetness."
"Strawberry colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are both dominated by sour strawberries.It reminds me of a non-alcoholic strawberry daiquri.Something that is best suited for the warmer months.I would buy again but not at 10 dollars for 11 ounces.I would recommend to try at least once if you like lambics."
"Opinion: This is an alright malt beverage, but it is much more foo-foo than any beer that I would like to consume regularly. I mean, there was no yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle? This is a commercialized ""lambic"" beer if I ever saw one, and may be a good starter beer because it is a whole lot better than the Cranberry Lambic that Boston Brewing makes...but that isn't saying much as it is horrible too. I personally will stick with Cantillon and the likes and leave this for the ladies...or newbie beer geeks."
"This is terrible stuff. Disgustingly sugary with nothing else of quality to round it out or otherwise make it worthwhile. The label dubs it, ""Belgium's Finest Lambic Beer."" Bunk. More than half the bottle went down the drain."
"A bad interpretation of a lambic that does not taste like a lambic. Far too sweet. I could not drink this."
"Drinkability: Not the best taste, but very refreshing. Would drink again, but I would rather drink a lindemans."
"Basically a soda pop with a very low ABV. Amp up the ""beer"" qualities a bit, and this may score somewhat higher. Still, for a soda-pop, it's a pretty enjoyable soda-pop. I'm OK with stuff like this, because a) ladies who don't like beer often like this stuff and b) even I can't drink Saint Lamvinus everyday."
"Pours translucent pale red, with a white head. It smells like a strawberry pie. Taste is like strawberries but weaker then I was expecting, also less sweet which in some ways makes it have more in common with other beers compared with most lambics. The beer is also pretty smooth. Its a good beer to sip."
"Verdict: not worth searching for on its own merits, and the price pushes it further into the ""don't bother"" category..."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink, but doesn't offer a lot of complexity. You'll probably get bored with this beer pretty easily if you don't do much tasting."
"D: The beer wasn't too difficult to drink but I don't think that I would try another one of these."
"I've had a small eye on this for a while now, but was never able to pull the trigger. Let's see how it goes, shall we? It pours a slightly hazy ruby red grapefruit juice topped by a finger of nearly white foam. The nose is unsurprisingly strawberry-heavy, resembling very closely the strawberry syrup I used to put on my pigs-in-blankets back in the day, sweetness included. The taste is more of the same, but the sweetness is partially cut by a low-lying tartness, akin to real strawberries. The body is a hefty-feeling light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly sticky finish. Overall, a decent little fruit lambic, but nothing I can really rave about by any sense of the imagination. Pretty tasty if you're into the strawberries, though."
"18 month old bottle."
"D: This was a bit too sweet for my tastes. Perhaps best used as a dessert beer or aperitif"
"Drinkability: I wouldn't exactly describe Timmermans craft as ""haunting", it's just simple, sweet stuff, more akin to a malternative or even one of those Jones sodas."
"D: This is strawberry candy in beer form. Which is fine, except there's nothing more to it than that. It's fine for what it is, the sugary fruity mixed drinks that Conan loves, but for the true lambic lover this is even more lacking than Lindemans. It's been told that Timmermans has made some amazing true to form lambics, and I'd love to try those, but this is clearly strawberry daquiri territory."
"""They out-Lindemans'ed Lindemans."" ~acme"
"For strawberry beers its not bad, for a lambic is below average. Not at all sour, a great starter for someone not into beer at all."
"At least the Lindemans Lambics have something else going on than sweet sugar and artificial flavoring. There is no funk and no tartness to speak of. Just cloying sweetness. I will avoid this from now on."
"Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
