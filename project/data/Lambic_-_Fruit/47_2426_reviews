"Had this on tap at the Beer Museum in Bruges."

"O: A nice introduction to the style but there's no comparison if you've had New Glarus"

"A nice respite from a night full of sours and while it is beautiful to look at and the mouthfeel is amazing and round/full the subtle cherry flesh flavors aren't stacking up in turn. It is quite sweet and refreshing  at 4% ABV but at the cost of $9 a 12.7oz bottle I'd say tick it off."

"Cannot get past the niquil taste.  May be better with a few years on it but drinking the 2012 in late 2014 proved pretty disappointing to me.  By a different one for a few bucks more would be my advice."
""
""
""
"All in all, I like it, and it was definitely a good bargain. I could drink a beer like this year round."

"this is still really well made cherry beer, but it isnt my favorite that they do. its still seemingly immature, sweet from the fruit rather than puckery from the lambic, but the freshness and authenticity of the fruit make it a worthy drink for me, and there still is a sturdy hit if funk mid palate, even though the sourness of the lambics we love the most doesnt really even show up. the cherries are ripe and juicy, not medicinal at all, although they crowd out any malt flavor for most o the drink. carbonation is fair, but the sweetness of the fruit makes this a beer i only need a little of, more of a cordial at this level than a beer, but you cant help but be impressed by the vibrancy of the cherries, and with the texture of the beer overall. its obviously a quality brew, but i think more time, less fruit, more lacto character, and a little more carbonation would really make this special. still, anytime you get good belgian kriek, you dont complain."
"D:  Drinkable. Not overly sweet, but not acidic or tart either. Straightforward cherry flavors."

"O: it's a fruit beer, it's very much flavorful but brings a slow, plodding counterweight to the meager brightness it reveals... cancelled out the semi-dry, earthy tones of the Manchego I started eating towards the end - so don't bother with that - fared a little better with the kale Gouda... that's all the cheese I got right now"

"Deep ruby red pour with a dark pink one-finger head. Strong aroma of fermented cherries. Great dark cherry flavor upfront with a slightly tart edge. Light to medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Can also taste a hint raspberry and a little oak flavor but the cherry really stands out. Finish with a really nice lingering dark cherry tartness."
""

""
""
"O - Pretty clean version of the style - a bit boring and one dimensional. Also I think it's too sweet. More like cherrysoda then a beer."
""
"O:  pretty tasty.  Balanced well.  Fairly basic in flavors and complexity.  Would drink again."
""

""

"O- for the price this good will buy it again when in the mood.. recommended"
"Pours crimson with good clarity and a seductive pink undertone. The head is loose cherry tinted foam that fell fast. The nose is ripe black cherries. A hint of woody oak and a brief whiff of barnyard. Taste is sweet and ripe fruit that has a modicum of tartness on it in and of itself. The barnyard is not very prominent on the palate. The wood is airy and light. The carbonation is almost right but could stand a few more bubbles. The malt is a but a touch of crisp wheat and a hint of weight on the palate. The beer is dry. What it isn't - is sour or acidic. It lacks that boldness and it is sorely missed. While the fruit is lovely it just does not engage the palate fully without that aspect. It drinks easily and a bit too easily ."

"This is a drinkable lambic, but it doesn't stand out at all. I would prefer more sweetness, more tartness, and more evidence of wild yeast."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep reddish purple color with a small bubbly pink tinged head that dissipates slowly. Aromas of sweet and tart cherries dominate the aroma. Hints of tart lemon, balsamic, brown sugar, and earth round out the nose. The flavor is quite a bit sweeter than I was anticipating. Dark sugary sweet with plenty of tart and sweet cherry flavor but seriously lacking in much lactic tartness to offset the sweetness. Hints of almond flavor and a bit of earthiness round out the flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Super easy to drink, more tart than a Lindemans but less than I was expecting."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad lambic, certainly not my favourite as I lean towards the unsweetened verson. Love the scent, taste is okay and mouthfeel not bad."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas although it's not quite what I expected from a Lambic."

"A very decent kriek."
"O - fail. Sad, but really not as good as their gueuze at all. Just too sweet and such a lightweight taste for dollar."

"Overall- Disgusting example of a kriek. You can do way, way better than this with other shelf krieks.. even Lindeman makes a better one. Look for the likes of Hannsen's or Oude Beersel."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: It's an easy one to enjoy when you're in the mood for a lambic."
"Tasted to me like a cherry Halls, not bad at all, but still sweet and not that complex."

"o - more of a fruit beer than a lambic. homeless man's version of new glarus wisconsin belgian red."
""
""
""
"O: While this beer does have its rough spots, it's still worth a shot. Not the most spectacular lambic out there, but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
""

""
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Excellent kriek and a great way to kick off ""kiek week."" This is a nuanced and subtle kriek, certainly not what you might expect if your only exposure to the style was the Lindeman's Kriek (which is, nonetheless, excellent). This beer would be good with food and certainly is sessionable. I would love to have the opportunity to plow through a few gallons of this beer. Recommended...if you can find it."

"Little touches of tartness and sharpness from the carbonation. Fairly light bodied. Big sweet cherry pie flavor. Little bit of mustiness and some metallic notes that dissipated after letting the beer breathe."

"It had a nice, smooth, sour/tart taste to it. Cherries were long gone. Smooth body...not much carbonation after 30 years. Overall it was a good beer, but like I said, it was more about the experience of drinking a 30-year-old lambic, which I doubt I'll ever have again."

"Could also use more carbonation."
"Dark Pink, spotaneous fermentation. Very cherry aroma, the real deal. A little too sweet, soft carbonation, a little tart, very drinkable.A touch of spice, I would like more tartness and more spice.Stephen's bottle.Perhaps not the bang on, but a worthy try."
""
""
"O: Definitely not a beer I'll revisit in the future. It's basically like drinking a bottle of cranberry-cherry juice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite a simple tasting, yet refreshing and tasty beer."
""
""
"This pours a maroon, reddish color with only a slight head. The scent is very rich with cherries giving the aroma more of a cherry wine rather than a cherry beer. It’s very sweet to the nose. The taste is very sweet and refreshing. There is not presence of alcohol at all in the taste. Texture is flat with a touch of carbonation as it finishes. At 5% abv wow! This is something you could give to a kid and they would think it’s cherry juice. Not bad, different, but could use a little improvement to become a great lambic."
""
"O: this beer has been made to sell; it is not made for beer reviews; very intelligent brew."
"O - overall an average lambic at best"
"Overall- Solid lambic for the price. Obviously no Cantillon or Fontenien, but I would choose a Lindemanns over this specific Boon."
""
"O-A cherry forward lambic. Big fans of sourness and funk present in some of the other krieks probably won't love this one but is really tasty and easy to drink which is a big plus in my book. Lacks complexity."
""
"D - this is a good kriek - not as sour or funky as others I have had, but it is still delicious in its own right, especially if you like cherries."
""
"Overall: It's not a Lambic you have to grow into. It's not a sour bomb, or a funk bomb, or a beer nuanced by years of wood aging. It's sweet, it's flavorful, it's not the most complex wild brew, but putting snobbery aside you can't tell me it's not delicious... Just keep that in mind if you are put off by the score. Cheers."
"This is a really nice lambic. It lost points for me because of the creamy, diacetylic notes that I got in the finish. Otherwise, this lambic is flawless and definitely worthy of your time and attention."

"ABV is 4.0% by the way."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an enjoyable, easy-drinking, refreshing beer, but I find the flavor to be a bit light for my palate. I also thought it was a bit under-carbonated and lacked the sparkle of a really good lambic."
""
""
"O: Nice cherry flavor, but not nearly tart enough."
""
""
""
"Sere in tap at Local Option. Appearance is bright red with moderate Haines. The nose is full of ripe cherries, oak, and waves of tartness paired with mild funk. Taste is all fruit with big sweetness up front followed by mild tartness. Mouthfeel is under carbonated with light body. Overall, this Kriek sits somewhere between sweet and tart, the result is somewhat boring in the world of fruited lambics. I wish it swaye one way or the other."
""
"My first Kriek, so forgive some ignorance here, but comes off as slightly alcoholic cherry soda with a bit less fizz. Sticky, coating mouthfeel is the biggest detractor for me and sweeter than I anticipated. Not really my style, but trying to be objective in the scoring as I have a good feeling that there are better examples of the style out there..."
""
"D - A rather poor representation of the kriek style, but a decent and respectable brew overall. While I can definitely see myself trying this again, I probably won't seek it out; there are just bigger and better things in the lambic style for me to try."
"O-pretty good lambic, not overly sweet. Would buy it again"
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent Lambic to drink for a while."
"O- Overall this beer was good but nothing great. I haven't had many krieks, so I didn't really know what to expect. I think it eventually becomes overkill, I let my g/f finish the other glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an alright beer, though too sweet and candy-like for my tastes."
"BOON Kriek is pretty bloody red, red as stoner eyes with trace amount of small bubbles that are off white looking and foamy off the tap. Smell is cherry up front with some artificial like scent. Some plastic and a small malt build. Taste is terribly sweet, cherry, some vanilla extract, mild funk, this one is on the sweet side. Feel is a bit sour, yet sweet overpowers that. Feel is a bit up from light with a syrupy feel on the way down. Minimal carb. 5oz's was plenty, and perhaps too much."
""
"They also make a Framboise and Geuze that we get here in the states, but i think their Kriek is the shining star of the lineup."
"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting, but I think I like Framboise better as a flavor for a fruit Lambic. When first poured, if I didn't know it was a beer I would have guessed I was served carbonated black tart cherry juice. As it warmed up and rested a bit, I could tell some other flavors were trying to get out from under the cherry, like the bitterness at the end which I thought was a hint of a spicy/earthy hop, but it was so hard to pull out I'm thinking it was my imagination. Great appearance, good aroma, but just okay in everything else. As for drinkability - when paired with food it's a nice drink (went well with chocolate pudding, I suspect it would be even better with chocolate cake) but by itself it's just okay as a sipper."
"OVERALL: A pleasant fruit lambic, would pair excellent with port wine cheeses and spreads, or with waffles and fruit for breakfast."
"Hazy red pour with about a finger of light pink head. Hardly any lacing, but otherwise a pretty beer. The aroma is like smelling cherry juice with only hints of tartness. Really nothing other than the fruit apparent from the aroma. The taste continues this. cloyingly sweet cherries without much else. The sweetness doesn't really get to me, so I think the drinkability is high. The mouthfeel is medium with a low amount of carbonation. If you're looking for a good kriek, keep looking. You haven't found it yet."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a lot sweeter than I had anticipated. The cherry sourness plays very well with the lactic lambic tartness. Great gateway beer."
""
""
"Very pleasing tart cherry flavor compliments a very well-balanced maltiness. This is one of the best examples of a lambic kriek that is widely available in many markets. It's not too tart, yet carries enough pleasing fruit flavor to make it worthwhile seeking out."
"O: Nice kriek. Was looking forward to trying this one and I'm happy with it. Could be a little funkier and more sour for me, but the nice cherry flavor. I will probably buy again and put it down for a long time."
"O- Too sweet for my liking. I read on this site that the sweetness is from the fruit not from artificial sweetners. I am not so sure about this though. This amount of apparent sugar seems unlikely to survive the prolonged warm storage this bottle was undoubtedly subjected to unless it was pasteurized. I like the slight tartness and do enjoy the cherry flavors. They are just a little pronounced for my liking. More like a shout in your face than the more subtle flavors I like in a complex, balanced beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice tart kriek at a great price point and high availability. A total easy drinkier. My bottle was listed at 4%, not the 5% BA lists here."
""
"O - Not the most complex kriek, but good for what it is."
"Nice but lacking in depth. I'm guessing this is a more commercial kriek with added sweeteners. Plenty of cherry flavour, but it's too sweet and doesn't have enough funky lambic character. Easy drinking and goes down well, but forgettable."
"This basically tastes like cherry candy. Not cloying, but not far from it either. Going in, I thought this was one of their unsweetened offerings but I should have asked before ordering."
""
"Overall: A tasty beer. Would be a good introduction to real lambics for a beginner. Very easy to drink. More sweet than funky/sour."
""
""
"On the whole, a pleasing example of the style, well worth keeping an eye out for, and certainly a genial way of introducing a friend to the (admittedly much broader) world of sour beer."
"M-light and bubbly, beer flavor was just not my thing."
""
"D/O - very drinkable, but this is a baseline kriek. Fine for the price point, and a great basic lambic. Had no problem downing the bottle."
"Dark blood red with a modest pink head. Sweet and artificial cherry nose. Just a touch of sourness. The flavors are pretty much cherry cough syrup and artificial cherry flavoring. Sweet with barely a hint of sour. Medium body with mild carbonation. Nowhere near what I want in a kriek."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a decent kriek that is unfortunately obviously improve-able. There's just too much that could be done to make it better, which detracts from the positive characters that are there."
""
"O - Dissapointed no to have any funk in this beer and it smacks of extract rather than genuine fruit."
""
""
"This beer pours a beautiful cherry color with a nice one finger cherry red head. The smell is like cherry cough syrup with not even the slightest hint of sour or funky. The flavor follows suit with a cough syrup or cough drop cherry flavor. The mouthfeel is actually decent for the fact that this beer tastes so disappointing. Overall would not buy again or recommend anyone to buy this"

"Sad because Boon Oude Kriek is fantastic, and Boon is more than capable of producing exceptional traditional kriek lambic. This beer sadly represents catering to the Belgian market for sweets and crap alcopops."
"Not real good, to much cherry, not enough beer."
"Poured from the bottle, this burgundy colored lambic produced a tight head which quickly fell. The smell of tart cherries was welcoming. However, the flavor was a bit one dimensional for me. Sweet on the front and dry on the finish. I did use this lambic in my cherry brownie recipe and the brownies were amazing."
"Disclaimer: I rate backsweetened lambics to the style of sparkling fruit juice, not actual lambics."
"Not real sure how I feel about this one. The juicy mouthfeel really makes it drinkable and a nice dessert beer, but it really lacks depth. Even a stronger flavor like sweeter/sour-er cherries, or even some of that Belgian sour funk would have made it much more appealing."
"Overall: Enjoyable, but clearly not an overly complex example of the style"
"The 2011 Bachelor Party Extravaganza's winding down a bit, moving to some ""dessert-style"" beers. This one pours a clear bleached ruby topped by a bit more than a finger of light-pinkish foam. The nose is nothing but sweet cherries, aching to be set ablaze in a fit of jubilee. The taste keeps this pattern fresh at the start, with those sweet cherries really popping on the tongue. Then, near the finish, a very light (but still noticeable) tartness creeps in for a brief appearance, bringing in a small currant flavor. The body straddles the line between hefty light and light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly watery (though still mildly effervescent) feel. Overall, a nice lambic, something not too sour and not too sweet."
"O: overall not one of the best Krieks I have had, but does suit the style very well."
"Pours a bright red color. Somewhat dark, though still bright. Light pink head. Starts out at a single finger and some pretty good retention. The nose carries some fragrant cherries, though there's only a mild tartness and no funk. The flavor is all cherry and tastes too sweet. Nothing there to balance it out and no real indication that this is a lambic. Medium body with good carbonation. Fairly sweet. Mildly tart. Decent enough on a hot day, but nowhere near what a lambic should be."
"T-M- Has a upfront sweetness of cherries and a red wine bitterness. Refreshing light tart and a smooth watery mouthfeel put this down as a after dinner beer."
"O - Really not impressive. It is not much better than Lindeman's weak offerings. Sweet without much funk or sourness, though at least these characteristics are hinted at."
"Beer is thin and has this mild sweetness to it, the finish is mildly tart from the fruit, mild lactic acid creaminess to the whole thing."
"(D)- A very sweet and rich interpretation. Very straightforward here with not a whole lot that makes what great lambics are great; a funk and sourness; this has neither. Boon's Oude Kriek is on a whole other level than this one."
"overall this was just what the doctor ordered and really nicely done. i think my favorite style may be changing."
"Drinkability – I found this to be an enjoyable kriek, but find the watery middle and mild tartness to be a little confusing on the tastebuds. This beer is neither sweet nor tart. Both characteristics are there, but fail to be fully announce their presence. The apple core bitterness that I am picking up is also a little off-putting within the overall flavor profile. This beer has a lot of potential within the juicy cherries that appear up front, but loses some steam in the finish. The fruit is still there, but not to the same extent. Approachable and enjoyable."
"Pours out bright red with a pinkish-white head. Obvious cherry aroma. Fairly light tasting; all cherry and no beer, and not extraordinarily flavorful at that. Smooth and easily drinkable though, and a fair enough after-dinner beer, though definitely not the best of the style."
"Pours a dark red, fluffy and dense pink head. Nice lacing and strong retention. Pretty! Nose has some marschine cherry, mild medicinal notes, some lactic presence. A general yogurt feel to it. Taste has more cherry sweetness, mild lactic notes and this mysterious yogurt comes through again. Mouthfeel has some slight tartness. Good feel with some good cherry flavour. Tastes way better than the nose would indicate."
"A middle-ground for true kriek lovers and those who prefer fruit drinks. Overboard on the sweeteners but still does the trick on a sunny day."
"D-this is a poor attempt at a beer, flabby, flat, and watery. too malty and artificial with way too much sugar and not enough anything good."
"Very much a lambic with training wheels. Lacking the sourness, brett character, dryness, or complexity of a great Kreik. The beer tastes like it was pasturized with cherry flavoring added after. It would probably be great over ice cream or to cook with."
"One of my favourite, more standard Lambics, this one, as it's easily enjoyed with a touch of funkiness to keep you interested. A great choice for someone just starting out."
"A pleasant, well-balanced fruit beer - the tartness is definitely on the low side (especially considering the particular guest component) compared to some of its compatriots. Unfortunately, the one-sided fruitiness kind of limits this to dessert fodder, but at 8 bucks a pop around these parts, methinks it was good to try just the one time."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and refreshing because the cherries are well incorporated into the taste."
"D: A tasty beer, but overall not one of the stronger fruit lambics out there."
"D: Good but not great. Would be a great beer for someone getting into the style. Really great with chocolate."
"A rather ""normal"" kriek, good as aperitif or digestif."
"D: Nowhere near as bad as the Boon Framboise, but it's not the best kriek out there either. Stick with Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen."
"To clarify, when we talk about this beer being sweetened it is not to be confused with other non-traditional beers that use artificial sweeteners. Fruit is used to sweeten this beer."
"The feel of this beer is light in body and is pretty easy drinking. It goes down quickly and leaves a nice aftertaste that stays for a short while."
"more cherry massivity. light body and mostly lacking in recognizable malt characteristics and yeast contribution. a touch of lactic acid"
"D - Incredibly drinkable, I could easily pass this off as cherry soda, and, at 4% ABV, could drink it all day. Perhaps not as tart and funky as other offerings, but this would be a superb choice for getting your feet wet in the Lambic world!"
"This beer is light in body with a lightly sparkling carbonation. There is not a lot of depth or complexity but its a refreshing and drinkable brew."
"DB- The flavors here are all good but sweetness devours it. This is the first time I have had a lambic with sugar outweighing tartness. Strange but not bad. The appearance carries the score."
"Pretty solid mouthfeel+carbonation, but I guess I've been spoiled on lambics for Cantillon, I was hoping for gut-wrenching sourness with a huge cherry taste. Easily drinkable and more or less enjoyable, but I can't see myself ever getting this for the price."
"D: Goes down easy. Very refreshing."
"This is quite a bit sweeter than I remember it being. Still a tasty lambic. Glad to have scored three *really* dusty bottles recently."
"D- Its not for me. It tastes like a girly wine spritzer. Will not buy again. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a Cantillon and hope for the best."
"Also this beer is spontaneously fermented, so it sounds as though it would be very inconsistent. Potentially it could be a different beer next around."
"Boon might not be at the top tier of Lambic and Geueze producers, but this Kriek is nonetheless very tasty. The beer presented in a corked and caged 750 ml bottle and poured into a white wine glass (all I had around while on vacation). The kriek was a clear garnet in color with a fine pink cap that lasted but left little lacing. The beer smelled and tasted very bright from sour cherries. The beer was not too sweet but nicely balanced with enough tartness. Overall, the expression of the wild character was limited, the amount of fruit flavor had that effect on the beer and it appeared that the beer was not bottled conditioned which can definitely help the bugs do more work. This is a good beginner beer, but for the more advanced beer drinker, this might be disappointing"
"Spritzy and light, just what I was hoping for when I picked this one out, but it falls a bit short as the sweet is so much more prominent than the sour and the funky. I would certainly drink this again, as it is readily available and not too expensive. However, it doesn't quite do it for me in terms of a great lambic."
"D: In the end this is one sweet cherry bomb. I think some people might appreciate the sweetness more than I do. In the end I just think this lacks the refinement and subtlety that makes good krieks one of my favorite beers."
"A deep, thick looking cherry red pour with thick poof of prickly pinkish hued head. Scent is of strong, tart and sweet cherry - almost like pre packaged pie filling. While its not what i want out of a beer necessarily, i think it smells fantastic. Taste is very syrupy and almost medicinal, strong musty cherrys, cola, cranberry and touches of grahmn cracker. Medium bodies, syrupy and coating. The scent is the beers best quality and thats about all i enjoyed."
"Nice cherry red with a soapy pink head with food retention, this is decent. The nose has a big cherry character, quite fruity, like a cocktail cherry. Rather sweet, artificially so, this is simple and lacking in funk. Mildly medicinal too. The palate opens with a cough syrup-like character with berry sweetness, low sourness and low funk. Medium light in body highly carbonated, this is way too sweet and rather disappointing."
"D- Great overall leaves me wanting one more to split."
"Here's hoping my 200th will be a bit more impressive!"
"D - Though it is not tremendously sweet, there is no real tartness to balance, and so it is somewhat cloying."
"I was surprised by how much the cherry flavour came to the front in this lambic as I figured that it might be a much more austere beer with the lambic notes dominating. The cherry taste was deep and delicious with just right amount of sweetness. I never got sick of this beer and realized just how great a blender Boon is with his lambics"
"D- Because this is not overly sweet and because it is so light and refreshing, this has great drinkability if you can enjoy the fruit flavor and lack of traditional lambic tartness."
"D: Nice enough kriek, but stick to the bottled Oude Kriek if you don't like the sweet stuff."
"D- Eh. Too juice-like. Needs moar sour."
"On tap at Camping in Beersel. Pours a bright red like a jar of bar cherries topped with a frothy deep pink head. Aroma of tart cherries pounds the nose from a foot away and is followed by touches of sweet brown sugar and hints of the mild lambic sourness that is to come. As expected cherry dominates the palate as well. There are hints of vinousness and a general red fruitiness but this isn't particularly depthful. Still, the sweet/tart character of the cherries mixed with the sourness of the lambic, which also dries the beer a little, makes this a very balanced and pleasant beer - as cherry beers go especially. I very much enjoyed it on this and other occasions."
"D- easy to finish. very juice like and unlambic like. disappointing. i wont be buying this again."
"375ml bottle, best by date 2 Apr 2013. Pours a deep, dark red almost a mahogany, with a decent fizzy pink head, a touch of lacing. Aroma is cherry, tart, almost like a cherry cough syrup, with a touch of funk. Flavor is similar, bitter tart cherries with a bit of earthiness. Mouthfeel is the lighter side of medium, well carbonated, bitter, and dry at the finish. Good beer."
"M/D - Light to medium bdoied with some stickiness to it. Good carbonation for a very lively feel. In all, just a little too sweet for my liking."
"Not a bad beer and worth atleast a try."
"drinkability: overall it is what it is. If this helps people get into real beer than great."
"Beautiful color, deep cherry. Little head that vainshes realatively quick. Faint, almost non-exsistent bubble, slightly viscous. Smells and tasts of cherry, dissapointingly not sour. Great on a hot day like today. This would be good poored over some good vanilla ice cream"
"While I'd rather have a Cantillion Kriek anyday, this is a pleasant drink."
"Mouthfeel was creamy and silky smooth, but overall this was slightly dissappointing. I thought it might be more 'challenging'. Good beer though."
"Picked up a 75ml for about 4 euro in Ghent. Bottled in 2007. Reminds me of cherry sugar candy and there's a mild vanilla edge in the aroma. Very juicy, but not too thick (like Lindemans). The beer finishes on a fresh, dry cherry note. Quite nice if you like sweet fruit lambics."
"d - don't like it."
"D - very drinkable."
"It was quite ok, very drinkable, but slightly too sweet."
"D: A good beer, though I would have liked some more complexity. Can't argue that much, a thoroughly enjoyable and drinkable beverage."
"Won't have again."
"D: Highly clean and refreshing in the finish - I don't think I would get tired of drinking this one."
"I'd say this particular kriek is closer to a Lindeman's in taste, although not quite as sweet."
"this one exceeded my expectations, but still isn't my favorite style or even flavor within the style. still, very drinkable."
"Drinkability is lower for me, this is just another candy beer with really no semblance of the base lambic, more like a wine cooler. Not worth the price, even though I got it on sale, I was hoping it would be funky with a slight cherry tinge. Instead it tastes like cherry slurpee syrup again in oak barrels. I now realize I was thinking of the Oude Kriek, whoops! I couldn't finish this, to sweet and syrupy."
"M&D: with the mildly sprizty mouthfeel echoing the refreshing fruity flavour profile, this super-light-bodied Kriek Lambiek proves to be a very easy-drinking beer in the summer. The lack of complexity is a minor disappointment, but not so much as to decrease the overall drinkability."
"Pours a like shirley temple. Smells of light cherry syrup and candy. Taste is very refreshing. Pretty sweet with a whole bunch of cherries, but not too sweet. Nice dry finish. Good Lambic, would definitely drink again!"
"Light and refreshing, but I cannot have more than one. Nicely done, but I prefer a more pungent taste."
"Very thick and creamy. A fizzy high carbonated feel. Light to Medium bodied. As with most fruit beers, I can only drink one every once in a while. This one is not the best, and for the price, I expected much more."
"Quite good representation of a lambic; not as bold as some, but that is made up for in its smoothness."
"Overall, very good. Exceptional for the style. Very drinkable. I was surprised that it was still very good after 5 years. Probably helped mellow it out."
"I would love to cook with this beer as well as to try it along side a dish containing dried fruits or fruit juice reductions."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, but not particularly enjoyable. The acidity and fruit character are weak and the complex funkiness of a fruit lambic is completely lacking, leaving this beer as a dull example of the style."
"The taste and fell, though, are weak. It has only very mild cherry flavour, and mild earthy, yeastiness. It's a bit sour, but not much, only faint tartness, and mostly just dry, watery, and bland. It lacks the sour-yeasty lambic taste of even the supposedly too fruity Lindeman's and doesn't compare to the Melbourn Bros., both being more fruity and more lambic-yeasty."
"The smell of the beer is sweet with hints of cherries, and it has a bit of tartness. The beer has a subtle sweetness to it with a combination of hints of tartness. The sourness is very late in the beer. I was expecting a bit more sourness, but this is quite nice. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and carbonation. I could probably drink only a few of these. Solid beer though."
"D = This is a decent aperitif, but I can think of much better,"
"I couldn't finish either of the Lindemans fruit lambics I previously reviewed, so this is a step in the right direction. Extremely approachable, yet it is not an offensive syrupy mess. There is a hint of ""wild"" character, I doubt a newbie would even pick it out. Not something I'll chase down again, but certainly recommended to anyone looking for an intro to fruit lambic."
"A deep cherry color, quite clear, with a nice pink head. Not super carbonated though. Smells of cherry and also slightly tart with a woodiness to it as well. Almost cherry candy type aromas. Not very sour tasting at all, though not that sweet either. A little bit of a tannic edge finishes the beer off. Quite mellow for a lambic. Overall this has a nice cherry flavor backed by a pleasing light acidity. This would be a good first lambic beer for those who have not had the style, but in the end it just does not hold up."
"Mouthfeel is very dry for the level of sweetness. Lots of prickly effervescence. Extremely drinkable, great dessert beer."
"D - My favorite Kriek so far. Wouldn't drink it too often though. Especially when it's about $15AUS & rarely available."
"Dark strawberry jam color with a fizzy grape juice looking head. Aroma of cherry lollipop with a hint of acidity and cool cement. Straight up cherry lifesaver flavor with tartness tingling the sides of the tongue at the back of the mouth. Not much lambic character to distinguish behind the sweet cherry flavors. Pity. I'm afraid I can't even take this beer seriously. Double pity. However, on a few sips, the late finish reveals some funky tartness not explained by the cherry. It must be the lambic poking through after all. But it's only on random infrequent sips. Triple pity. My final revelation is the taste of cherry soda mingled with the smoke of fireworks. Too bad I couldn't have gotten buzzed off this as a kid on the fourth of july while lighting bottle-rockets. Quadruple pity."
"This I beleive to be the best sweet cherry lambic on the market. Brewed in Lambeek, this pours a cloudy cherry red with good head. The nose reeks of cherries, and leads you to beleive it will be harshly sour like cantillon kriek..The taste is shockingly smooth. Those of you looking for the sour face puckering taste of a geuze or cantillon type brew, do not buy this. This is full of cherry flavor and goes down like fruit juice. just the right amount of carbonation helps. sharp cherry flavor in the finish. mouthfeel is perfect, could drink this for a week straight. I wouldn't recommend doing that though, as It would probably cause on wicked hangover from the sugar. That would be the fructose that sticks to your lips. Great brew. Usually I only enjoy framboise or cassis lambics, when they are sweet like this (and should really be classified as fruit beers) but this is the exception. The only disadvantage is the outrageous price for a little corked bottle. worth the buy, but only for a special occasion."
"Feels balanced, delicious and what I expect in a lambic (not like Lindemans, which is also excellent, but not quite as polished)."
"Taste is a little sweet and has a strong syrup taste of cherries and blackberries. The wood come through a little. The sourness is almost invisible, but shines through every now and then. A nicely balanced beer with sweetener, that has a very good drinkability."
"Review added 10-27-2007, translated from french 1-27-2008."
"D- a great light kreik, nothing really overpowering, very smooth and delicious, a great introductory beer to sour ales too because its present, but not very strong, and is perfectly matched with the cherry flavor"
"A finish of cherry sweetness extends well past finish and revisits a memory of the fruit going into the next sip. This is a richer Kriek that focuses too heavily on cherry flavor and sweetness. If only the flavor and body held true to the complex aroma mix, this beer would have fared much better."
"Nice bottle. This beer pours a dark red color with a tall pink head that has nice retention. Quite cloudy as well. Smells like cherry candy - slightly tart, but not overly. Lots of cherry aroma. The flavor is like candy as well. Sweet, thick, and only a hint of tartness. Lots of thick cherry flavor. Very nice. Not nearly as sour as most lambics, but extremely tasty beer. I'd have this one any day. The body is thick and the drinkability is great."
"I liked it - the flavour is lovely and aroma fantastic. A good product from a wonderful brewer. Albeit, this is far from the best of Krieks, but it was certainly worth far more than the 1,50 euro I payed for it!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep reddish color lambic with a super huge pink foamy head with perfect retention. Aroma of sweet cherries with some tart notes. Taste is also dominated by some sweet cherries with tart notes. Not as sour as some other example of the style (Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen) but I dont believe any sugar was added maybe just cherries with a sweeter taste profile (but I might be wrong). Body is full with some low filtration and some great carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable and refreshing beer for summertime."
" Totally worth a try."
"Overall, a good dessert beer. Not overwhelmingly sweet and quite tasty."
"All that being said, this beer is very plain and that becomes noticeable towards the end of the glass. It is still a fine beer but I will get the Cantillon next time."
"D-Very tasty but the drinkability is limited due to the profound tartness."
"a decent lambic, but doesn't have the tartness or complexity of a true lambic. it's kind of one dimensional with the cherry. However, it tastes good, but this is a lambic damnit! I want some tartness and sourness. this doesn't realy ive me that. The head was decent for a lambic and there was a tiny bit left over throughout. A decent beer, but nowhere near worth the 8.99 I paid for it."
"Overall this is a fine fruit lambic, and a good one to get to know the style on, since it's not as sour as others."
"Tasty but overly sweet IMO. I couldn't too much of this and although its nice it lacks complexity I've tasted in other fruit lambics."
"I expected more out of Boon Kriek than I got. First and foremost, I expected more explosive cherry flavor. It's an enjoyable little fruity sipper, but there's no way I'll buy it again if I have to pay the same $5.99 that I paid for this bottle."
"An okay cherry lambic for what it is, nothing earth-shattering or mind-blowing. Would make a decent dessert beer. I do like cherries, but this does become rather one-dimensional and old hat after half a glass. So be it."
"D - Alright. Cherry lambics are pretty common and generally better than this one. I won't have it again, but if your idea of the perfect lambic is a sour cherry soda, than hunt this down. It is easy to drink and I got through it with ease."
"D: Not exactly my pint of beer but was very easy and light to drink. Its not too sour so may be a good beer to start someone on lambics."
"A bit disappointing but still a solid kriek. I've come to expect alot from Boon however this isnt a big bold sour lambic like cantillon kriek or kriek de ranke but it is pretty solid"
"Pours a deep burgundy with a stable head. Strong tart cherry aroma. Flavor is very tart and a bit sour up front, with fruit, some carbonation in the middle and lingering tanginess. Some bubblegum. Light mouthfeel and definitely not cloying. Might re-review later because this is my first non-Lindeman's lambic."
"An enjoyable beer, and a nice change of pace, but not all that great. I've had better lambics, but I've also had worse. Middle of the road, and at least worth a try if you've had many of the others."
"Drinkable, I could see this served with a fresh fruit tart, some zabayone or perhaps a flan."
"This beer doesnt do a whole lot for me. Its not horrible but there are better fruit flavored beers out there."
"I'm very picky about fruit lambics and this is one of my favorite Krieks."
"D: Really not bad. Easy 5% but the cherry flavor is just a little too much for me..."
"Depends how you feel about cherry flavours with this one. It isn't bad, but I really wouldn't look for it again, it just hasn't excited me."
"Overall: I was hoping for more sour and earthy aromas and flavors. As is, this is a pretty good sweet lambic."
"D: Easy, count this as a session beer, at 5% many could go down, try it with your girlfriend..."
"Ruby red with no head. Real sour cherry smell. Black cherries. Smells like the fruit really smells/tastes, not like that weird cherry flavor you run into so much. Tastes very light, again, like real fruit. Very small taste compared to the smell. But it grows. Tart, sour cherries, with the lambic sourness too. Not too sweet. Again, like REAL fruit. Very dry finish. Very pleasant."
"All in all a good drinking lambic. Maybe a touch sweet but enough complexity to keep it interesting."
"A nice kriek, though on the sweet side compared to Cantillon. Drier and more complex than a typical Lindemans."
"Sweet! Massive carbonation makes a virtual slushy in my mouth. Dry wood stacks up on the sides of the palate as the foam melts. Mainly tastes like cherry hard candy, and cherry taffy. I'm going to let it sit for a bit to deflate. This is a foam munster. There's a twinge of sourness. The grapeskin sourness is like an after thought of wild fermentation. Drinking this makes me feel like I sucked some nitrous. It roughed up my throat. I suggest drinking it colder."
"37.5 cl green bottle, corked and bailed. Date on back label 10.12.2006. $4.95 at Lee & Edwards in Roanoke, VA, price tag dated 12/03."
"This is clearly one of the more complex and delicious krieks that I have drunk. Really nice!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Light to medium in the mouth with a soft carbonation, if it weren't for the complexity in the taste this would sure be a lot easier to put down. Easy drinking, but very savory. This is one to enjoy after the party's over, when your tastebuds crave to retire with something unique to remember."
"Overall - A very good kriek. Very refreshing and very drinkable... maybe ever so slightly on the sweet side though..."
"Well I like this style as an indulgence, but was actually a bit surprised by how sweet this one was. Muddy henna red when poured, there's some pink strawberry colored foam on top (which has lasted). Aromawise, while I can pick up the Kriek, I can pick up the sugar as well. Tastewise, It should be figured out by now that I think the sugar (?) overpowers the Kriek more than it should. The cherry is evident, just not as to the fore as would be nice. Some tartness there, but you have to look."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Pours a dull reddish brown color with a fizzy head. Sour cherry smell. There are some lambic smells, but they seem to be covered up by the cherries. The flavor is real cherries, but not a lot else. From the aroma, I was expecting this beer to be very sour, but the sour flavor never came. The fizzyness and the cherry flavor together make this feel like a soft drink. There's nothing terrible about this beer, I just think it could have been so much better."
"The cork explodes so watch out. The beer pours a nice light red with a foamy pink head. The smell was of cherries, but the complexity was lacking. The same with the flavor. The cherry taste is alright, but the complexity is not there. It's a simple, fizzy cherry alcoholic beverage, without really being anything special. One of the more dissapointing lambics I've had, but still tasty."
"dark magenta with inty bubbles sticking all around the edge. even smells sour. smells of fruits, hard to pick out the cherry notes. also smell woody characteristics. every sip seems so different from the last, some over poweringly sour and bitte, while others seem much more mellow. i wouldn't even say that it tastes that much like cherries, i think i taste it cause i a supposed to. so ahrd to describe the flavors, but i get a pleasent wet carboard kind of taste, mixed with the sourness and a pop of fruit at the end. much crisper when cold, much more sour as it warms. you canr eally taste it waround the outside of your tounge, i dont know what taht means, just an observation i have never noticed before. Surprisingly heavy as it sits in the old gut for awhile, might just be the acidity."
"Mouthfeel is nice and fluffy. Bubbly carbonation runs over my tongue. Easily drinkable brew and quite a tasty treat. Not your everyday beer, but nice for a change of pace. I look forward to trying some more lambics and seeing where the style takes me."
"I felt the Lindemans was a better brew."
"A nice Kriek, but definitely not my favourite. Still a decent brew though."
"The smell of sour cherries was very strong. That was the high lite of this Kriek. The taste fell quite a bit short, compare to the aroma the ale gave out. The flavor of a sour substance was evident, but not much on the cherry side. Although pleasant, it came up short for a good Kriek."
"Finish is mildly sweet with a finish that sweeps you into the next taste"
"More of a Spontaneously Fermented Lambic Ale with Real Cherries, rather than a proper Kriek in my humble opinion, but damn good nonetheless, and one that I certainly continue to enjoy the odd bottle of once in a while."
"Clear, rosy red beer, well carbonated. Small, wispy, white head fades to a ring. Somewhat faint nose: cherries, sweetish, not much tart, a little earthy funk. Sweet, carbonated, cherry-flavored drink. Again, just a little earthiness, but very little tartness, bite or character. Finish is somewhat bitter, but still very tame. A little disappointing."
"355 ml bottle with cork and cage (the one in the picture, actually) opens with a slight pop, but no gunsmoke. Pours a port-colored brownish-red (translucent to opaque). A hard pour brought on a small off-white to reddish-brown head that lasts a few minutes, then collapses back to a thin covering over the beer. Aroma: nicely balanced fruity & sour aroma. Cherry and some other dark rich berries. Fresh and clean, not musty. Flavor: nice crisp clean fruit with a gentle moderate soourness of lambic. not as intense as some, which improves drinkability. Less complex and a little sweeter than others. Makes for better drinking when looking for something easy to drink."
"dry and wine like in body, medium feel, still some lambic left in this kriek, good sourness."
"Efferescent creamy aroma a tart cherry taste that lacks the creaminess that the aroma promises, mouthfeel and texture is a little thin, a hint of sourness starts coming on, and I'm basicaly stood up by the malt, which never shows. I like Lindemanns better."
"12 ounce green bottle, corked, purchased in Kansas City for $5.50. 5% abv listed on the back label, as is the date 18.10.2005."

"Anyway, this one is better on tap."
"Deep ruby color. Small head. Aroma is cherry, with a subtle touch of brett that fades very quickly. Medium bodied Kreik. Cherry flavor is evident yet very subdued. The tartness, sourness and brett are all there but they seem muted. It nicely balanced, but sort of toned down. Its not watery or anything. But all the flavors seem toned down a couple of steps. It like they turned it down to a 7. If I can understand the Flemish on the label its best before 17 09 2006 so its not a old bottle or anything. Its sort of a Kreik Light.. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is sweet."
"I would definitely recomment this beer."
"Boon Kriek pours a deep red color with a quick-to-form, quick-to-fade bubbly off-white head. A thin, rubber-band sized head stays and leaves wonderful lace down the tulip glass. Smell is fairly dominated by cherries and some barnyard funkiness. Sour, acidic, and mildly fruity bouquet. Taste affirms this, as expected. Big notes of acidity, sour cherries, and some residual sugar reside in the taste department. An excellent balance of sweet and sour, acidic and tart flavors. Effervescent mouthfeel keeps things interesting along the way. Serving this chilled in the summertime would be a wise idea, as its thirst-quenching qualities are endless. This makes an excellent apertif and is an excellent lambic in the most traditional sense. Definitely worth a try."
"The appearance pretty much tells you what this beer is going to be like. It's a deep reddish color with an off white head with shades of pink. This is going to be a very fruity beer with some sweetness. This is definately a beer for cherry lovers. Nothing but cherries in the aroma and the taste. It might turn some beer lovers off, but the sourness of cherries are in my opinion an excellent choice for an addition of the lambic style. Here's a tip: give this beer to a woman who thinks you're crazy for being so obsessed with beer. A perfect beer for after dinner."
"16 10 2005, green corked bottle. This beer pours a red/amber mix with a light pink head that quickly reduces to a small lace that sticks to the glass all the way down. The aroma is all sweet-tart cherries, as is the flavor. It's quite enjoyable and not overpoweringly sweet or tart at all. The finish is very dry. This is easy to drink, very enjoyable lambic...worth a try."
"The beer pours a beauteous cherry red, the head a purple delight, modest in size, frothy in texture and as it dissipates rather quickly leaving behind clumpy bits of lace. Ripe cherries dominate the nose, tart and vinous, crisp, fresh and quite sniffable, the start cherry sweet and the top lean in its feel. Finish is spitefully acidic, tart, sweet cherry aftertaste and dry as a desert bone, a decent Lambic, not great, but not bad either."
"2011 edit: wow, how my tastes have changed, as now I only like Oude Krieks, the drier the better"
"Pours a rich garnet-red with a fine, pink head. Rich cherry aroma with hints of brown sugar and ever-so-slightly spicy. Also has a rather vinous character to the smell. Tart cherry flavor, but not overpowering like other fruit lambics I've tried. Nice mouthfeel of rough carbonation and the thickness of the beer itself. Very dry finish. Pretty straight forward and a good cherry lambic."
"Nice looking scarlet red hue.  A slight collar is all this beer offers for a head.  Wafts of brown sugar and sour cherry hits the nose immediately.  The oak and wood characteristics really add a nice dimension to this beer.  Tart, acidic qualities dominate the taste profile otherwise, but not in an obnoxious way.  Very slight candied flavors are present if you look hard enough.  Nicely carbonated mouthfeel.  This is one of those beers that beckons another sip from you even though it is fairly tart.  Enjoyable."
"An easy drinking kriek that is somewhat dry and cherry flavor is not overpowering. Its not assweet as Lindemans but is somewhat sweet and not too tart but has enough tartness to make you pucker a little. I think it could be  bit drier and have a little more tartness to help balance the sweet side. I would like to try the Marriage Parfait if I could find it."
"Normally i find kriek to be better than framboise, with most of the lambic produces, but with boon i found the opposite, thats not to say this isn't bad, this has lots of fruit, but lacks a bit of tartness, and tends to be a bit sweet, still very refreshing."
"Ruby in color and a bit hazy, topped by a thin but persistent head that manages to leave a lace.  The expected sweet cherry aroma is followed by a more complex tartness and slight hint of wet horse - like Brettanomyces.  The flavor is very sweet overall, but has more complexity when compared to the ubiquitous and cloyingly sweet Lindeman's Lambics. The cherry flavor is prominent, but subtle green apple acetaldehyde and welcome contributions from lactic acid bacteria add a pleasant tartness.  The taste grows on me as I begin to discern the understated complexities of the overall tartness...  The sweetness gives way to a pleasant, crisp and dry finish w/ lingering cherry flavors.  This is certainly a tasty Lambic-- the flavor is skewed towards sweetness, but there's enough overall complexity and lightness to make it quite drinkable.  Boon Kriek is unique and definitely worth trying, but doesn't seem to be a showstopper."
