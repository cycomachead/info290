"Very reddish hue on the pour. Pink head. Lots of bugs on the nose. Very biting flavor profile. Probably too much so. Not at all rounded. Beyond sour, it's tart and really grabs the mouth and yanks at every taste bud you have. If you don't like sour beers, you certainly will not appreciate this at all."

"Really tart, dry finish with a little funk that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.  Tasty, but I found myself wanting more fruit, less sour."
""
"Won in Upland sour raffle. Split with my buddy who took the drive. Pours and drinks like a very tart lambic, but neither one of us really picked up much if any blueberry. Still very enjoyable."

"Pours a murky dark reddish-purple with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, berry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour berry and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a fairly one dimensional aspect with the sourness."

"O-One of the better blueberry sours out there, not world class but very solid."

"This one was shared during the big Upland sour tasting amongst a large group of BAs! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a purplish red with a half finger pink head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, blueberries, funk, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, blueberries, funk, tart, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This was my second favorite from this tasting which included all of the Upland fruit lambics and Sour Reserve Batch 1 (which took #1). We figured no one had brought Blåbær so this would make a decent substitute. We were right on that aspect. While not as funky like most Cantillons, this one definitely carried a similar flavor profile. With this one being MUCH easier to obtain I would not think twice about pick as many of these up as possible based on my two experiences with this brew. A definite must try for anyone who calls themselves a sour fan. If you haven’t tried it before, you need to do so…"

"Overall a great sour. I just wish the blueberry had been a little more prominate."

"Overall: This is Upland sour is in the middle of the road. Blackberry and kiwi are still my favorite Upland sours!"

"This beer pours a dark blue color with very little light getting through. The smell is tart and funky with A nice blurbery aroma. The flavor is tart not sour and the blueberry flavor is very noticeable. The mouthfeel is slightly fuller than expected but good. Overall this is a great beer."
"Overall, this is a fine beer. If somehow Upland could figure out how to get the nose into the mouth, they'd have something really special on their hands."
""
"D - I remember liking this more when it was fresh - I wouldn't age this batch further to be honest. It's lacking complexity with lactic acidity dominating the other flavor elements. Still, an improvement from the flat early batches. It was really easy to put down a bottle, even with minimal help."

"The beer pours a purple hue with a fizzy, purple head. The head is very thick at the start, but fades quickly into nothing. No head is left and no trace of lacing left. Beer looks flat. Smell is of fresh blueberries and a earthy funk. You can smell a good mixture of tartness from the blueberries. Taste is semi fresh blueberries with a decent tartness. A small hint of funk is present, but this isn't as sour as I would like for a Lambic. Carbonation is very low and this beer is almost flat. Overall a disappointing Lambic offering. I have heard this is one of the weaker Lambic offerings from Upland and without having the rest I hope the consensus is right because I have 5 other of the varieties to drink at some point."
"Like I said, my least favorite of the Uplands I've had. No real sourness, weird funk, and weak fruit. Can't win them all; might be better fresh."
"O - I liked this one quite a bit, seemingly more than most who have reviewed it here. Another solid offering from Upland."
"Okay beer. Rather overhyped, wanted more."
"Tart, puckering mouthfeel with slight acidity that lingers into a vinegary acetic finish.  Lots of vinous dark fruit, especially blueberry, ref grape and dark cherry.  There's a subtle oak presence which contributes to the earthy character but the slick, flatness/lack of carbonation hurt this beer."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a clear, blue/purple tinged copper color with a minimal head that collars around the glass. Nice aroma with notes of tart blueberry, fruit, and slight acetone. Light mouthfeel. The blueberry isn’t as good as what I wanted. Not overly sour. Not too carbonated and wish it had a touch more. Some apple fruit notes as well."
"Its not all that carbonated, but that doesn't negatively affect anything in this case - just super smooth, easy to drink, and VERY tasty. Recommended."
"Mild carbonation on the palate. Finishes decent enough. Dries out on the finish. Puckeringly tart blueberries in the flavor. Sour lemon-like citrus, yeast, lactic-acid wrinkling the palate a bit, more funky flavors. This definitely is tart. I was surprised my wife took to it so well, but she downed it quickly and happily. I savored mine a bit more, but it was a pleasure to have. A nice tart beer with just hints of fruity sweetness to keep me sipping."
"Overall, an easy drinking sour. Nothing special, but still very enjoyable. I have liked the others a bit better, but I do like this one."
"O: It was a bit pricy around $18.00, I'm sure I have had better for less. But, I would still recommend this beer to any lover of blueberries and sours. Give it some age and it could blow you away. I'm going to hold on to one for a year and see what I think this time next year."
"3.5 D: By no means a bad beer, but easily the worst out of the four offered for this release. Big hit of blueberry, but not much else."
"The beer was a little undercarbonated for my tastes as I find the bubbles help carry the fruit aromas and flavors while adding acidity. CO2 also makes the beer seem brighter and more lively. Overall this was a delicious beer, but I think more lambic aroma and taste would really take this over the top. Perhaps what this beer is more time in barrels to give the critters a chance to break down even more of the sugars, as I tasted a tiny bit of residual sweetness. I think that more time before fruit addition would help get more wildness and sourness in the beer."
"....I think more carbonation may have made this a little better for me."
"(D)- A nice lambic. I look forward to see what time will do, but this is quite nice coming from the states."
"Update: I shared a second bottle of this last night with my girlfriend. This bottle actually did give off slight and subtle blueberry aromas. They were still disappointing but at least they were present. The flavor too only gave slight blueberry, leaving me wanting more prominent blueberry."
"Andrewinski1 was generous enough to share this one with me. Poured into a tulip. Pours a slightly hazy shade of violet with about a finger of lighter colored head. Kind of a sweet batter aroma to this. Andy said it kind of reminds him of blueberry pancake batter and I think that is spot on. It's slightly tart in the aroma with a decent balance of sweetness. The taste is a bit on the subtle side. Barely tart and barely sweet. It's kind of the Switzerland of beers. I really like the nice light body but I think the carbonation is a bit much. Overall, I dig this. It kind of underwhelms but I'll still stand by it as a sound effort."
"I like the lively mouthfeel. The sharpness of the bubbles works well with wild ales. Not a terrible beer but it noticeably falls short of other similar versions. My 8 ounce share is enough for me, and I'll enjoy it."
"My first offering from Upland and it is a good one. These seem to be fairly well sought after, but the reviews can go either way. I can say that the '10 version of Blueberry is legit. The best American fruit beers are still made by New Glarus, but Upland may be on to something. Low bottle counts make it difficult, but try this if you can without giving up the farm."
"Drinkability: Nice to try but I won't be seeking this one out. I like the ideas they are trying but they need to work on the execution, up the berry content, and remove the wet book/cardboard aromas and tastes."
"The beer didn't really look all that great, a nice red color to it. The smell was definitely fruity and sour, and I was excited to try it. Got a nice hit of blueberry flavor, just like you'd expect, and then it quickly dissipated, and I was left with just the sour aftertaste of the lambic. Overall, it had a really good flavor, but I just wish it would have lasted a little longer. Pretty smooth to put down, I just don't think I'd want to drink blueberries all day."
"Figured I would pop open one of my two bottles of this. After a hefty battle with the cork... pours a very nice reddish/purple. Looks pretty cool. Smell is full of blueberries with a slight lactic sourness. As other reviews state, it does remind me of blueberry cobbler. Taste is actually a good balance of sweet and sour. I would prefer it to be more sour, but the taste of tart blueberries is excellent. This is definitely not in the same league as most belgian lambics... but if you take it for what it is, it's damn tasty. Mouthfeel is a little lacking, pretty thin. Drinkability is high, I had no trouble finishing the whole 750 myself over the course of an hour or two. Not sure how long I'll hold onto my other bottle, I enjoyed this one a lot."
"d - Overall I think this was my favorite of the Uplands we tried that night (we tried Blueberry, Strawberry, Peach, and Dantalion). Would love to have again."
"The lactic is underplayed because the beer itself is not very sour unfortunately. I'm really rooting for Uplands but so far their lambics have been mediocre. Beer is thin with only a hint of tartness at the corners and back with nothing really to prop up the rest of the beer. It is nearly a flavorless lambic."
"D: I was honestly a bit disappointed. I was really looking forward to the possibility of another great blueberry lambic, but this one did not deliver. This is a decent beer, and I would be willing to try it again, but I won't seek it out."
"D: Nice."
"A nice blueberry lambic. The first I have had, next for Blauw to compare head to head with LeBlue possibly."
"Upland's Blueberry Lambic '10 release was our second tasting in the home collection series. This was brought in by my buddy, 'Lil Bear who was given this beer by my brother & myself as a ""Thank You"" for driving down to Bloomington with us to pick up our reserved lambics last December. We all agreed it was a little premature to open this bottle so early in the aging process, but it was a grand symbolic gesture we all enjoyed. Poured a fizzy pink/purple. There was a very surface souring that just kinda teased my taste buds. Like I mentioned this may have been too fresh, but that worked well with the fresh Michigan blueberries used in making this drink. My overall impression was of Greek yogurt with unripened blueberries on top. I can't wait to open my second bottle of this in a few more years."
"Overall - I was a little bit let down with the Strawberry lambic last night, but the Blueberry got me back on track. The fresh blueberry flavor plays well with the lactic backbone, yet I can see this aging well as it gains more sourness. Recommended, and I may be trying to obtain more bottles."
"D: This one is honestly a bit of a disappointment. Not much of a lambic in any sense. No tartness, not really dry, and -bal effect is almost completely missing. A great fruit beer if it were described as such but in the category that it is, average to below average overall."
"Very drinkable. With the light fruit, and moderate sweetness make this a very drinkable lambic."
"Pours a really magnificent blueberry color with a nice pink head. Really attractive coloring. While this was quite nice, I was immediately distractive by the overpoweringly-assertive nature of the blueberries in the nose. It was a symphony of blueberry breakfast items with loads of blueberry syrup and pancakes plus a slight amount of tartness. Really well done. The taste nails the fresh blueberry as well and adds in a touch of sourness. The mouthfeel is a bit tart and a bit sweet. Drinks incredibly well. I think the blueberries are the highlight of this one and I won't be waiting long to drink my other bottle. I think the fruit character that really makes this beer will be gone well before this really sours up, if that happens."
"D- This beer was the only Upland Lambic that night that held any sort of light in the lambic world. It's flavors could have been a little brighter and more full but I think the fullness would come out more in a aged bottle. See Upland if you get your shit together you can make a decent lambic!"
"Light carbonation, extremely drinkable, I liked it a lot. Persimmon was better in my opinion, but this is no slouch."
"The best Upland lambic so far, this is really good stuff."
"I enjoyed this beer, but was disappointed by it at the same time. The carbonation issues are no fun, and they ruin what could probably be a decent brew."
"This is a light bodied offering with a lower than expected carbonation level. It is easy drinking and is approachable without too much puckering quality. I think the general consensus about this brew is that if you took away the blueberry stained appearance of this brew, you would probably not be able to figure out the fruit addition based on flavor and aroma."
"D- Consumed in a tasting with several blueberry lambics and this-though a decent, enjoyable brew overall-was the at the bottom. Great opportunity to try this rare brew-but there are many others out there much better."
"D-not bad, drinkin after blabaer so pales in comparison. quite sweet and lacking the tartness I was hoping for. little complexity as well. not bad, but falls well short of the previous beer."
"Another interesting lambic from Upland, but nothing really spectacular. Would be great to get a little more of the blueberry character - perhaps these flavors diminished over the past year. If only I could get a Blabaer to compare."
"D: A pretty decent lambic/American Wild with a nice sourness and balance. Not the best, but certainly good."
"D: This was an easy drinker but compared to the few other examples out there it just does not stack up. I did thoroughly enjoy this beer though I just wish more blueberry came through."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to almost no carbonation, this is virtually flat. This has some great traditional lambic character vs. American wild. But I think the flatness takes away but this is still good stuff. Thank Russ!"
"drinkability is pretty good. alcohol is hidden very well. balanced sourness. nice funky depth. great fruity character."
"Bottle shared at Woodshop 5.0. Pours the color of ripe blueberry flesh, sort of blueish pink, with no head. Aroma is reminiscent of blueberry maple syrup but with more sharpness to it. Tastes like overripe blueberries, the kind that if you eat they're a little too soft and mushy and don't taste as bright and sharp as ripe ones. Pretty tart but the acidity/sourness is toned down here compared to any expectations one might have for a 'lambic.'"
"Edit: Again... big thanks to Bobby91w ... Bobby is a great trader."
"M&D- Well this one is flat as can be. Nothing lively under the tounge which takes away from the drinkability. It has a nice taste but the lack of any ummphh keeps me from wanting more."
"D-While this brew has it's short coming overall it is a pleasant tasting and nicely done brew. I certainly enjoyed my pour and wouldn't hesitate to try it again. With some tweaking and proper carbonation this could becomes a truly stellar beer."
"I think this brew has a lot of potential and will re-review if I get to try another batch."
"M/D - Rather fizzy in the mouth and the beer leaves the mouht very dry. Maybe blueberry just isnt my flavor of choice, but this one just did notquite do it for me. Certainly not bad, just not great in my book."
"Much better than the peach. Beautiful blue color with a periwinkle frothy head. Wow it actually has some carbonation. We all noted that this had more of an ""authentic"" blueberry flavor rather than what some of us found to be artificial fruit flavors in some of the other lambics we tried. Relatively low acidity- especially compared to a lot of the other beers we sampled. I would definitely like to try this again in the future, although from what I hear the subsequent batches weren't as good."
"This is a very stange beer, unique, somewhere between a wild ale and wine, but still disappoints given the lack of carbonation and subdued funkiness. The lack of carbonation plays better here than in other Upland lambics, but I would still love to see it carbonated."
"Slightly puckering feel, but overall comes off a bit light all around, which does make it really drinkable."
"750 ml capped and corked bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours purple with pretty much no head at all. It smells tart, like oak, blueberries, and some funk and vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, I can taste vinegar, blueberries, oak, and some vanilla. However, the taste is subtle, and I wish it had a little more kick to it. Mouthfeel is thin, seems a bit watery to me. Not much carbonation either, however there is some slickness which is nice. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. I think it's an OK enough beer, but there's definitely some room for improvement with this. I'll have to try another batch in the future and see how it is."
"Overall I am getting underwhelmed by this series in general. I have a couple others to try, hopefully they will redeem themselves a bit, but I would pass on this one for sure."
"I had higher hopes for this lambic, but it's just decent rather than transcendent. Pours a beautiful purple, but with no head. Stemmy blueberries on the nose with quite an impact. The aroma fades on the finish. Not quite as lush as I'd like. A little thin and sour to start as far as the taste goes, but the blueberries make an appearance toward the finish as nice, clean fruit. The mouthfeel is thin and a little sour. A little perfumy overall, and a bit stemmy. Could be lush, or could be bracingly sour, but it straddles those lines without really deciding which direction it would like to go and without making a statement. Somewhat pleasant, but could be so much more."
"750 ml bottle acquired in a trade a few months back, opened last night with my girlfriend, poured into my Belle Vue flute glass, pretty much flat with a miniscule head that disappers immediately, no lacing or anything, just a still body that looks like the cranberry juice I had with breakfast, would have thought it would have been darker with it being a blueberry lambic, smell consists of mild tartiness, soft berries, vanilla, light oak, and funk, taste is quite weak and I kept thinking over and over to myself, where is the fruit, very light tart at the beginning, then it turned into pretty much juice without a sweet or sour fruit flavor, just bland and starightforward, did not change once it warmed, too mild for a lambic, just dry in the finish with no taste to go along with it, it is like barely flavored juice with a tonic water finish, not much of a mouthfeel, dry and once in a while mildy tarty, low level of carbonation was one of its main problems, for something that was both corked and capped, you would expect the contrary, taste did not linger at all, taste more like it was aged in a ziploc bag than a wooden barrel, could drink more of this stuff because of how light it is but would not want to, no complexity and is not anything close to other interpretations of this style, this was the worst of the Upland lambics I have had so far, almost half the bottle ended up being poured down the drain, very limited fruit flavor and the lack of carbonation pretty much ruined it, would not drink again, this was the second time I had it and it was the same each time, so can eliminate the idea of it being a bad bottle, certainly not worth what I traded for it, not recommended"
"Drinkability- Really tasty brew but damnit they need to get the carbonation in check. A $15 beer needs to be carbonated, regardless. Gripes aside I liked this one more than all except for the peach (which also wasn't carbonated). The fruit and wood are fantastic accompaniment to the light sour of the brew. Thanks Matt!"
"Easy to drink since it tastes like old blueberry juice."
"750ml bottle thanks to tjthresh. Interesting purple-pink color and a smell nothing close to blueberries. It is close to funky fruit lambic though and the aroma is one of the qualities most of these uplands get right. Flat mouthfeel, fruit juice flavors, too juicy not enough sour or blue berry or funky enough but the aroma is cool and misleading."
"D_The potential is here but there are some definite faults. not sure where they went wrong but it needs the flavour component amped up a notch. I preferred the Blackberry to this one."
"I have to say this lambic was a bit of a disappointment. The flavor is there but the lack of carbonation really knocks this one back on most categories. A few more bubbles and this would have been a really good beer."
"Because it's less funky than many lambics, it's also very drinkable and finishing off the bottle was no problem at all, which I can't honestly say about some lambics. A decent effort but would benefit from more carbonation and/or funk."
"Pours a nice blueish color, some carbonation, not much of a head, not much sticky lacing either. The nose is malty with scents of raspberry/cherry, not much blueberry at all. The taste is malty, soury, with some raspberry/cheery, again not much of a blueberry taste. Medium body. Drinkable, dissappointed with this brew."
"If this were carbonated and had more of the traditional Lambic notes (acidity and funkiness) then it would be absolutely outstandingly awesome (runaway best from this years Upland Lambic release in all likelihood). The fruit adds such an interesting character to this brew, but without the CO2 and other traditional Lambic notes this is merely interestingly good. I am really digging the similarities to a fruity red wine. Definitely an experience and it is quite easy to polish of the bottle of this."
"Poured from a corked 750ml bottle and served in a tulip. This beer poured a hazy, dark red with a thin head of pinkish/tan foam that quickly faded into a thin film. A small amount of slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma consisted of oak, sugary blueberries, and a hint of funkiness. The flavor was made up of muted blueberry notes, wet wood, and a very light brettiness. Finished mostly dry, but was not very acidic or puckering. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and minimally carbonated. Almost still. Goes down like uncarbonated fruit juice. After trying their strawberry lambic, this was a bit of a letdown."
"Not much blueberry in the flavor, either. The blackberry definitely had a much stronger ""berry"" component. Mostly acidic vinegar that was a bit thin, some citrus zest, and the faintest hint of blueberry. Not sure if I had a bad bottle, or what, but the mouthfeel was unacceptably flat."
"Poured a hazy, reddish golden color, with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of brett, light berries, leather, funk, and hay. Taste of dry berry skins, some sweetness, tart, funk, and a lengthly, sour finish. Good, but just short of Cantillon's."
"Notes from and tasted on 12/16/07"
"I am betting this would be better if there was more carbonation. The flavor and mouthfeel might go up a half point just based on that. If you have a bottle of this I would suggest sitting on it and keeping it in the 70s to encourage a bit more carbonation."
"Dark magenta color with no head. Terrific aroma displays the purity and glory of freshly picked and crushed blueberry, along with a light hint of oak and funk. Flavor is initially dominated by the essence of real blueberry, followed by a light hint of pie and then some nice tartness on the finish. While not Blabeur, this is a very nice blueberry sour."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth here. Goes down easy with a subtle puckering sourness. I have to fault this particular bottle as it almost had no carbonation whatsoever. I'm really hoping my other blueberry bottle doesn't have this problem, as it does take away from the overall brew. Cheers to Upland for creating all these lambics!"
"Thanks Bob!"
" The oak really jumps out both in the nose and flavor. The blueberry flavor is there but more present after you swallow on the tongue it lingers then you say ooohh yea nice!"
"Thanks again Mike; you are thee man!!!"
"Overall, its a good beer with a nice flavor and tart taste. Its a little pricey at 15 bucks a 750mL but its still fun never the less."
"Overall, this was a great Lambic, suprisingly good coming from the Midwest and not overseas. One for warm weather, or if you're craving something sour. Maybe not as approachable to Lambic novices, but great for those with a taste for the sour side."
