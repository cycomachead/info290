Maybe I got a bum bottle or my tongue was off that night, but compared to 3F's Intense Red Kriek and Oude Kriek, which I love, I found this one overpoweringly and one-dimensionally tart, lacking the bright, distinct fruit character I was hoping for. Still a wonderful sour all things considered, but more assaultive and less complex than the other cherry 3Fs I've had.","JonahNW","Oct 27, 2014"

The pour is gorgeous- inky hazy purple, pink foam that settles quickly with acid cut. But the aroma kills the experience. Cherry pie tries to peek through huge band-aid and plastic. The taste is salty, sharp, but medicinal with sucrets and some numbing character. Overall, this is one of those scroll past expensive lambics and probably the worst in show for Drie Fonteinen.","tarheels86","Sep 22, 2013"

I preferred the 7-year old Oude Kriek and its decadent finish, but this was a nice treat as well. Tart, notes of balsamic, enamel decaying bite.","dirtylou","Aug 31, 2013"

4.06,-9,3.75,4,4,4.25,4.25,"apparently one of the harder to find beers from these guys, and it is a real beauty. this is the 2010 vintage. it pours a cloudy pale red color, like a strawberry frosted donut, with some suspended yeast and only a small white head that settles quickly. the nose is the classic kriek smell, tart cherries, sour yeasty notes, and some mild residual sugar. the flavor is surprisingly not sweet, and it finishes dryer, which I really like in this kriek as opposed to others. the cherry flavor is very authentic and up front, but it doesn't dominate the funky yeast lambic essentials. in other words, its in wonderful balance. the finish is super sour, more so than I remember in any other kriek ive had, this one zaps all the moisture right out of my mouth. better carbonation than you gather from the appearance, and a light enough body, with hardly any sugar left over when you swallow. its really got an extraordinary mouthfeel. this is by far the best kriek ive had, its quality and tradition shine through. still, this is a style of beer that is hard for me to drink too much of, so I was fortunate enough to have a lot of friends, old and new on hand to share this with.","StonedTrippin","Apr 27, 2013"

4.27,-4.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Ah yes... That expensive bottle that always just sits on the shelves. Split with my doppelganger this past weekend! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a New Belgium globe. Poured ruby red with a half finger pinkish white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacint throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour cherry, cherry, and BIG funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, BIG funk, earth, and cherry. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The guys at GBX warned me that this wouldn't be what I expected it to be. I must say, they were completely correct on this fact. If you are looking for something with pucker-power, this is not the beer for you. This one was more of a fruity funkiness brew. It was really well done however, and quite enjoyable. Definitely glad I finally decided to shell out the dough on this one. Might be buying more in the future to see what that funky note does with time in the cellar based on this first taste.","thagr81us","Mar 03, 2012"

The cherries in this are excellent. The body is smooth and creamy with a nice tart/sour kick. Light, spritzy bubbles. Slightly more acidic than I remember the regular Oude Kriek being.

It's probably the most sour nose of an beer not named Cantillon. This one is pretty sour. It's so sour that you can't get much cherry, or perhaps I should say any traditional cherry or a cherry pie/cobbler. It's almost pure acid. It's also a little vinous. I like it, it just isn't overly complex. It can't be. It drinks lighter in body with moderate carbonation. This is a really nice Kriek and I've had it before. 2005s are insane right now but I feel this is in its awkward teenage stage, at just under two years old.","aasher","Jan 26, 2012"

At the price of this bottle I’ll probably not be sampling this one very often, but I certainly intend to have it again. Everything here is clean and crisp and I can easily see why many prefer their fruit lambics on the young side before the Brett and funkiness take over. I also think that the variety of cherries used does differentiate this from Kriek’s made with other tart cherries. On the label it describes these cherries as being prized by the makers of Kriek. I understand that now and it isn’t hyperbole.","drtth","Jan 26, 2012"

It pours a cloudy tawny-rose topped by a few fingers of pink-tinted white foam. The nose comprises tart cherry, light cobweb, vanilla, light caramel (very akin to caramel corn), dank oak, lactic acid, lemon zest, and a twist of ruby red grapefruit. The taste brings in more of the same, though the lactic acid and sour citrus notes seem to cloud the cherries out a bit. A touch of white wine vinegar is tossed into the mix as well, just to liven things up a bit. It's surprising that the tartness isn't more powerful, especially considering the effect it had on the back of my teeth. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, rather sticky finish. Overall, a very nice lambic, though it's hard to really enjoy it for an extended period of time (without experiencing some negative side effect of the sourness). Though I feel the cherries were talked-up a bit too much, I'd gladly take another glass, but I doubt I'd shell out the $35+ for it very often in the future.","TMoney2591","Nov 06, 2011"

The taste is again huge with cherry flavor without sweetness, cherry pits, a decent amount of sourness, with a good lactic tartness on the finish. Medium body. Low carbonation. I found the carbonation to be a bit low and felt the beer would have definitely benefited from more carbonation. Still a phenomenal beer. It reminded me a lot of the fresh Lou Pepe Kriek I had on tap a few weeks ago. I found the Lou Pepe to be slightly more enjoyable, but certainly loved this as well.","jethrodium","Jul 17, 2011"

Head retention is low, and there's also a small amount of lacing. Aroma is tart cherries, barnyard funk, vinegar and some oak. I think the taste is just like the aroma, it's all tart cherries, funk, vinegar and oak. The sourness isn't overpowering at all, but it's a pretty good tasting brew. There's also a lingering tart finish. The beer just tastes better and better the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has medium/high carbonation and it's somewhat slick and very easy to drink. I think it's a pretty good overall brew, and it would be interesting to see how this one ages. My only complaint about this beer is the price at $33.99 a bottle. But even then I don't think I was ripped off for the price, and I would likely buy this again at the same or similar price if I come across it.","bluejacket74","Beers"

Wow, great color on this beer, and leaves me with high hopes for the amount of cherry that must be in play here. Nice funky brett notes come out at first, notes of wood, leather, and mustiness. Only a small amount of cherry comes out in the nose, but it starts to show more as it warms. Flavor is bracingly tart and acidic. Nice mixture of acidity, oak and tartness, with hints of lemon in the front, followed by an earthy, herbal, almost cheesy like flavor, and just a touch of cherry on the back end that almost turns medicinal as it warms and gets to the bottom of the bottle. Musty, funky, and sour are the best words to describe this. Perfect, medium body on this with some abrasive carbonation at first, but turns light and delicate near the end. Wow, what can I say? I wish this one came in a 33cl bottle, because the 750ml is getting to be tough to put away by myself. Should have shared this with others, but I be a glutton for the evening. This is one of the best Belgian fruit lambics I've ever had and certainly blows away Lindeman's kriek in not only flavor, but also complexity.

This is from '06. 750ml into a tulip, this beer pours a clear glowing garnet color with a finger of cherry-red foam. The nose is muted at colder temperatures, but it begins to open up around 60 degrees. Sour cherries at the forefront, juicy and sharp, with a leathery, barnyard-like funky backbone. The cherries are beautifully expressed in the aroma, swirling brings out one of the most intense tart cherry aroma I've come across in beer. On the tongue this beer is sharp and acidic from start to end, massively fruity but subtly complex. Earth, leather and tobacco undertones lead into a crisp, biting finish. The sourness is very lactic and concentrated, and the beer on the whole is surprisingly clean, which really helps to showcase the character of the fruit.

Nice head that is tinted pink. Absolutely magnificent in the glass with the light hitting it just right. The smell is sharply sour, but witth a touch of cream as well. Predominant component aroma is sour cherrries. Very little barnyard funk, but very nice zingy cherries. The taste is complex with cherrry sourness and unlike the aroma, quite a bit of funk. There are also some fairly pronounced phenolic notes, but these are fairly well integrated and fade a bit with the beer opening up. The cherrry flavors are very pure and sort of float over the other flavors in the glass. Still, its not a perfectly harmonious whole and although good, something is lacking a bit to bring it all together. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and a delight. Good drinkability, but the phenols and lack of totally integrated whole make it a bit challenging.

Has one of the more pronounced fresh cherry aromas out of any other kriek I've had. I get a little faint earthy hop in the background. Flavor gets kicked off with intense acid and a touch of rubber and woodiness. This segues into a bright, fresh cherry flavor (along with some mild accompanying sweetness) which rides out into the drying and tart finish. Has a bit of a fungal element in the aftertaste.

4.29,-3.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"pours a dark pink color with orangey tints. no head whatsoever. very, very tart smell also shows a lot of gueze. in the mouth, immediatly very dry, austere, very tart and puckering -- as in, I could feel my cheeks sucking in. very dry finish. delicate cherry flavors, gueze funk, tartness and some cherry funk too. interesting. still not as good as the cask oude kriek though.","texashammer","Nov 24, 2005"
4.6,3.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall: A damn fine Kriek, serve it very lightly chilled to get the best and the difference that the Shaerbeekse Cherries will be very apparent then. This is well worthy of a purchase, but at $17/$18 a bottle unfortunately this will never be a staple in my fridge, in fact I would go so far as to say that the bottle I purchased at Somerville Supersaver in NJ and lugged West and then shared with BAs Davo and Erica before the Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival will probably be the only one I ever buy in the US. It was a pleasure to revisit this marvelous Kriek, it is indeed one of the better traditional Krieks out there, but it is just too damn expensive to drink in the US, sadly. Maybe Ill snag one more bottle to stash away, I have a feeling that this one will age nicely.","TheLongBeachBum","Nov 13, 2005"
4.21,-5.6,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"holds up well to its blended brothers- takes top prize in the drinkability category and despite its medium harshness still caters mostly to friends of cantillon. a brewing achievement and worth a try.. although i'm not sure i would drop another $17. one time treat.","goodbyeohio","Oct 16, 2005"
4.45,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"From March 1, 2005 1 pt. 9.4 fl. oz bottle. Purchased for $21.13. Pours rosy purple in color. Aromam is of cherries and smells like a cherry wine. Deep fruity aroma. First sip reveals a little sour taste with some musty earthy elements. Definite oak in the flavor. Some vanilla coming through in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light on the tongue with a soft water sensation. Flavor develops as you let the aftertaste settle on the tongue between sips. Not meant to gulp but to savor. Not as sour as other krieks.","mjohn27603","May 23, 2004"
4.85,8.7,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Release 2005. Great presentation with beautifull red collored beer tiny pink head. Nose is magnificent too giving lots of cherrie carracter, cheese of aged hops and some of the finest funky geuzeaccents I've ever expierienced. Great sourness and slight oak note on a leather sadle there to complete this perfect nose. Taste is extraordinary also having finest sour cherrie, great dry carracter overal with good bretty horsesweat bathing is sour, slightly noticable alcoholic wheatymaltjuice. Yes this is something extraordinary fine. Maybe litle souredy and not 100% mellowed down but guess this one could rise to a 5 by a year of what age.","paterlodie","Beers"
4.53,1.6,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle brought back by MartinT to whom it was given by JorisP. Cheers to both. Enjoyed also with Oakes, Kimchee and tiggmtl Appearance is a beautiful bloody red with a thin pink head. The red is so brilliant that it scores a 5 anyway. Aroma is complex of lambic funk. Spicier than most with cinnamon, cloves. The cherries are very nice, feeling unriped, both black and red cherries, intense and bold for a lambic. Earthy mold. Palate is very lactic with its typical yoghourt sourness, balsamic and citric, moderately salty. Funky brett with nutty, earthy branches and leafy undertones. It didnt strike me as spectacular from the first sip and sniff, but it grew on me and I realised I drank my glass very fast. I like its grapey vinous character and as weird as it sounds, to me, this is a quaffable offering despite its a real crime to just think about drinking this fast! This is a very complex kriek, with a good backing medium body and medium-high carbonation. Just what a brewery!","Rastacouere","0"
