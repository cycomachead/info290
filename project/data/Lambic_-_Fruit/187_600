4.54,18.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"The flavor profile is World Class.  It is intense in cherry flavor, somewhat complex and perfectly balanced with both sweet, sour and tart elements.  It begins with a burst of sweet cherry over a rich malt background that is biscuit in nature.  In the middle, a rich tartness effervesces.  As the sweetness fades, a subtle sour undertone emerges.  The finish is a slow fade of tart black cherry over a subtle sweetness and just a hint of sourness.","tillmac62","Mar 16, 2015"

Tall, frothy pink head which lasted well and left some lovely Brussels lace. Powerful aroma of black and sour cherries. Reminds me of a cherry starburst. Medium sweetness and a pleasant tartness. Medium-full bodied, smooth, spritzy, sticky and a lip-smacking tart finish. Delicious. 9.","magpieken","Feb 25, 2015"

4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/17/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy pink head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sweet/tart black cherry, cherry skin, candi sugar, straw, grass, light pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with balanced authentic cherries, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big sweet/tart black cherry, cherry skin, candi sugar, straw, grass, light pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sweet/tart black cherry, cherry skin, candi sugar, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness and balance of authentic cherries, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly syrupy, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is an excellent sweetened fruit Lambic style. All around great robustness and balance of authentic cherry, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth and refreshing to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 02, 2014"

Smells rich of cherries and a hint of malt along with some lingering scents of earthy/vegetable scents. Tastes just as good as it smells, a rich cherry taste with a slight after taste of malt, sweet but yet just the right amount of tart bite to it. Mouthfeel is very light with a lot of carbonation which makes it have like a soda feel to it, like someone else mentioned perfect on a hot summer day, ecspecially here in maine.

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, slightly mouth puckering, not too acidic, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for a after dinner dessert beer, but i think I would have no problem drinking a bottle to myself, it just might take me a little bit to finish it. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste, it was pretty good and it did a good job of really showcasing the cherrys and making them the star of the show. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad at all, but I think it would be a little better if it didn't have light cough syrup like aspect to it. I would buy this beer again and I would be interested to see how it ages. I would recommend it to people who love fruity and tart cherry beers. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer, I went into it thinking there's a good chance it could be a cough syrup bomb and the aroma didn't fully disprove that, but once I got to the taste I started to enjoy and appreciate this beer.So far this is now my Favorite Kriek and my favorite beer from Lindemans. Good job guys, this beer made for one nice dessert beer, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Aug 02, 2014"

It's still an absolute pleasure to drink but, make no mistake, 'tis no true lambic.","biegaman","Jul 28, 2014"

Deep, dark, ruby red, cloudy, with a half-finger of pink head that retained well and left lots of lacing on the glass. Looked beautiful! Nose is pretty much pure cherry sweetness. Lots of cherry sweetness in the taste, but actually a surprising amount of tartness, especially up front, which I didn't expect, knowing Lindemans' m.o. Cherry candy, and not much else to speak of here. Crisp and syrupy mouthfeel, light-medium body, mildly dry in the finish, with the sweetness lingering to the aftertaste; moderate carb. This is a great dessert beer. Lambic purists will tell you that true krieks shouldn't be as sweet as this, and maybe they shouldn't. In that sense, this isn't very exemplary of the style, and we all know that Lindemans flavors their beers instead of using fruit in the brewing process. But that doesn't mean this can't be a good beer.","Rifugium","Feb 04, 2014"

Tall, frothy, bubbly, pink colored head that starts a tall couple of inches and settles unevenly into a sparse surface coating. Aromas of rich, sugary sweet cherry, both tart and darkly sweet. The nose is similar to cherry cough drops. Flavors are sugar and syrupy sweet cherry, almost like a maraschino, with a bitter tartness at the tail end of the palate. Smooth, thin body that gets frothy and effervescent at the end. Richly sweet cherry aftertaste, with a solid linger following a slick, clean finish.","GarthDanielson","Jun 26, 2013"

3.75,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This poured out as a nice looking red color with a thin pink colored head on top. The smell of the beer is of cherry which is a good thing. The smell has some light wild yeast aromas in there too giving a little bit of funk on the nose. The taste of the beer is of sweet and sour cherry. It seems to start sweet and end with the tart. The mouthfeel is similar to a carbonated wine. Overall it's not a terrible lambic in my opinion, however some think that Lindeman's is just too sweet all around.

Still, this is a pleasure to drink and I could see how this would be very accessible to people who think they don't like beer. Sweetness is high but it doesn't come off as cloying nor as a fruity cooler pretending to be a beer. I couldn't drink a lot of it (due to sweetness) but one is great. This would definitely pair well with all kinds of desserts (especially anything chocolate). If there's any brett in here I'd love to try this aged with more showing; I'm not picking up on any and feel it could really use a little.","eat","Dec 31, 2011"

There is also a slightly acidic quality to this one. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. A bit of a sticky residue in the mouth after each sip.

Big cherry flavour on the palate with a fruit juice sweetness and mild tartness. On the balance, this fruit lambic is more sweet than sour. My guess is that the base beer was blended with the cherry juice mentioned in the ingredients list, and that the sweetness comes from the cherry juice itself. It's light-bodied, with the sugars giving it a slightly sticky mouthfeel. On the whole, this is a pretty simple fruit-bomb, but the fruit flavour is very rich and natural.

Sweet with plenty of tart cherry tang that really dominates the palate. Hardly any lactic sour or musty characteristics. It is pretty much all about sugary sweetness contrasting with the sour cherries. This is not a bad thing necessarily, but this is definitely not the most complex lambic out there. Mouthfeel is light to medium and seems a little less sticky than a lot of other offerings from this brewery. The sugar keeps this from being a session beer, but it is drinkable for the style.

The taste is mostly the same, but the cherries are now moist, fuller, more pronounced, with a slight hint of yeasty earthiness near the base. It doesn't sit very heavily on the tongue, and the carbonation is light and unintrusive, making for a highly drinkable and highly tasty brew.","TMoney2591","Feb 14, 2010"

Surprisingly and perhaps disappointingly there is not much sourness here. I'll be fair and keep appearance and drinkability at the average mark. Kool Aid and cheap wine coolers are big sellers. This is easy to drink with no big boozy taste. I just don't know why anyone would opt for this? To me craft beer is all about the best ingredients, not artificial crap!","jstilwell","Feb 12, 2010"

The cherries actually reminded me a little of the Luden's cherry cough drops I had as a kid which is not necessarily a bad thing!

The taste is of fruit punch and red grape juice with an overlying cherry syrup sweetness. Some metallic notes as well. Similar to the framboise but the cherries don't bring in too much of a tart flavor like the raspberries do.

I found this beer to be extremely easy-drinking and it passed the ol' lady taste (she only drinks sweet lambics and nothing else, so if she likes it then it is sweet) and very little tart/sourness. Taste is almost entirely cherry with a hint of straw or razzberry. Take this review with a grain of salt because I love cherry flavored drinks (i.e. Diet Cherry Dr. Pepper), so I found this to be a great drink.

All together, this really was an amazing beer. Those belgains really know what they are doing.","RiekerStarBrew","Nov 25, 2007"

Really sweet and artificial tasting, but has a bit of a tart edge towards the middle that lasts to the finish: which then holds some hints at lambic funk, but it is drowned out by the sugar. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and syrupy and has a spritzy carbonation. This is really too sweet to enjoy fully, especially since I know in the back of my head that for the exact same price, one can have a really good traditional lambic that isn't cut with other stuff to make it more accessible and boring.

Simplistic and straight forward, it is perhaps a bit easier to drink than the Framboise, but I do like cherries better than raspberries.

The beer lacks some of the more funky lambic type aromas, which may be good in some folks' opinions. The flavor is a blend of tartness, strong cherry notes, along with some slight puckery astringency and a pretty good dose of sweetness to counteract the tartness. The beer is tasty overall but it doesn't go out on a limb like some of the other lambics. Still it is pleasant and it may be a good beer to suggest to a friend who isn't really into other craft beers.

Nothing like other beers, very fruity.. but very tame, subtle, and still a bit complex. Yes, its sugary, and tart, that doesn't neccessarily make it horrid, just very different. The overpowering (to me) yeasts and sour cherry flavor tell me to pass this one to the women.","stoutman","Jan 06, 2004"

I was quite surprised that this beer was not as carbonated as I expected, nor was it overly sweet or tart. Never really at any point makes my lips pucker. Has a mellow cherry flavor to it that is not overdone in any way. It could actually use some more tartness to liven things up a little. A nice Lambic to have every now and then, and it gives me a chance to break out my proper Lambic glassware...woo hoo!","IrishRedRock","Nov 10, 2003"

The cherry aroma was nice if a bit artificial seeming, but the underlying mustiness scared me. Taste was a very nice balance of sweet and tart, but a cardboard aftertaste really killed it for me. Very welldone for a fruit beer IMHO, but I'm no expert on the style. I'll try others, so I'll give good marks just for encouraging me to try more of a style I've been neglecting.","Sixpack595","Oct 16, 2003"

Aroma: Tart cherries oh so nice, vinous wine like presence here a simple a bit one dimensional and sweet but perfect at the same time. Taste: Predominantly one rush of cherries but so well textured and mellow and spritzy but put together so well, perfectly aged I have to seek out other examples of Lambic next mission is Cantillon. Mouthfeel: Bubbly like champagne tickles the senses with each sip yet slight syrup texture so sweet like candy could definitely drizzle this upon some cheesecake for a devine experience. Drinkability: Low abv tastes like candy easily consumed but very sweet keeping this one for me a true dessert beer, it's awesome the beer that makes many a folk realize that beer is such a broad term.","WVbeergeek","Sep 22, 2003"

Definitely not what I am used to in a beer. I loved it thought. $11.00 a bottle at the local beer bar is pretty expensive though. I could go for another one.

I like this one a lot.","Brian700","Jul 21, 2003"
4.35,13.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"There was very little head on the beer, if that is what you could call it. It was sort of some frothy bubbles that ring the side of the glass. There was some lace as well. The color was thin, bloody burgandy, which was imperveous to light. It was difficult to even see what was going on inside. Only occasionally could you see some particles floating around. The aroma was tart and earthy with a fair bit of damp, grassy notes deep in the nose. The taste was tart, but not total mouth pucker tart. Wonderful sour notes of dark syrupy cherries and lemon. The mouthfeel was thicker than the taste would let on with zesty tiny carbonation bubbles. I could drink a thousand of these all summer long if my wallet would let me.","GreatPondBrewer","Jul 07, 2003"
3.7,-3.4,3,3,4,4,4,"This brew has a strong Cherrie smell. Large purplish colored head of small, large and medium bubbles with a cloudy pinkish brown body. It leaves a nice lacing as it goes down. Refreshingly nice sweet fruit juice flavor with a lot of carbonation. It is very interestingly nice. My first Lambic and I kind of like it. If you like wine coolers you'll love this brew!","TheDM","Jul 07, 2003"
4.13,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"It poured a lustrous ruby red with a bit of lace that migrated quickly to the sides of the glass. The smell was different from any of the other lambics I've had. To put it roughly, it smelled like a nice pilsner with marischino cherries and a wet horse blanket all tossed into the same room together. The "pils" and cherry notes were strongest. The taste was very good with a large sweet cherry flavor leading the way, followed by a very sharp acid bite and then a subdued, mellow cherry finish. This beer will definitely make your mouth pucker. Easy to drink, and very interesting, this is one beer that I enjoy.","jlervine","Jun 14, 2003"
4.32,12.8,4,4.5,4,4,5,"An attractive pour somewhere between crimson and burgundy. Topped with a finger's worth of tight pink foam that laces heavily along the sides. Sweet black cherry scent that is noticeably more natural than the notes one finds in many fruit beers. Despite the strength of the fruit smell, foundation of clean grains is present as well. A crush of sweet but not syrupy cherries dominates the taste. This reminds me of a genuine fountain-made cherry phosphate but with enough underlying (and relatively dry) malt taste to prevent it from being unidimensional. Fades to a nice balance between fruit and grain, with a cleaner mouthfeel than I expect from something this sweet. Entirely too drinkable for one's own good (or the good of one's wallet). My first lambic will certainly not be my last.","BitteBier","Jun 05, 2003"
4.05,5.7,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Burgundy hue, a finger of pink head, healthy retention, thick sheets of lace. Delicious black cherries dominate the nose with faint hints of maltiness. Alluring. Scrumptious palate, pleasantly tart but there is a perfect undertone mix of tangy and sweet cherries... nice malt undertones too. Ideal carbonated, medium-light body a simple pleasure to drink. Lovely acidic/tart aftertaste, slight puckering affect, leaves you wanting more. Indeed it lacks some flavor depth and complexity but this is still a tasty treat. Screw wine, drink lambic!","bditty187","Jun 04, 2003"

The aroma was very sweet and filled with fruity scents. The taste was very sweet and it reminded me of a good wine. The flavor is very strong of cherries and very enjoyable. This is not a beer drinker's beer, but it is more of a sweet wine drink. I really enjoyed the taste, but I wouldn't call this a beer. It's also quite expensive and has a very low ABV.","clvand0","May 10, 2003"

As Paul McCartney once sang, I Look High, I Look Low, I'm Lookin' Everywhere I Go, Lookin' For A Home In The Heart Of The Country. If I can only get used to that musty smell.

Sweet ripe cherries, lightly malted a real treat to the nose. Cloyingly sweet at the start, top lanky and the finish tart with a moderate acidity and a very light hop presence.

Yeah, a lot of cherry to the aroma, but a little too much cherry soda for me. There is a bit of hay mustiness, but I could have used some more. Cherry is naturally the predominant flavor, a bit of grape. On the oversweet side. As many people say that Lambics are brewed sweeter these days, I long for a return to the sour side -- more pits, stems, and skins. There is a decent dryness to the finish, distinguishing it from many American fruit brews, so at least there are two impressions in the complexity department.

The aroma is candyish with super sweet cherry backed by mild tart notes. The body is light with a very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor is astoundingly rich with tart and sweet cherry, but also reveals a bit of lambic character in the finish along with some lingering sweetness. Still, it dries out with a touch of sour astringency. Although I personally find this to be overly sweet and lacking in lambic flavor and aroma, I still feel it warrants high marks based on it's massive character.

These beers really test the limits of how much fruit can be packed into a mere 750ml bottle. Pure, intense, natural. I find these a lot less cloying than it seems others do. While sweet on the attack, the finish is as dry as a whistle. The impression of sweetness seems perfectly balanced. The fruit was simply very ripe, and that's what carries through the flavors.","putnam","Sep 23, 2002"

Nose is tart cherries mixed with a soda pop sugary sweetness. Taste is a refreshing tartness followed by sugary notes and a cherry tartness emphasized by by the light-bodiedness from the wheat malt. Finishes up tart and very refreshing, my only complaint here is that it's just a tad too heavy-handed with the sweetness. Still, it would be too easy to drink mass quantities of this beer...it's just too damn expensive to make that a reality!

It kills me that Lindeman's markets a beer this sweet - I wish they'd make a more traditional kriek as well because I know that the under-lying lambic is a quality product but here it is completely obliterated by the cherries and, especially, the sugar.","Realale","Sep 11, 2002"
