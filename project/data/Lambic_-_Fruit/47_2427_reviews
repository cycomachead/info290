"Decent framboise, nice juicy raspberry aroma but the fruit is a bit less present in the flavor. Mildly sour, soft lambic flavors."
"OK beer not as good as Lindemans by along shot."
""
"O: This needs to pick a direction and go with it. Either fruity or sour. Instead the lack of direction leaves it rather average"

"Overall: This brew is pretty enjoyable, considering the ABV. It's a very good lambic that is open to all crowds in the Lambic field. It's not too adventurous and yet it's drinkable beyond repair. I guess what people are looking for nowadays is acidity that will burn both your tastes buds and enamel off your teeth. All in all, this brew is worthy."
"An odd beast for a raspberry lambic, with notes of apple and rhubarb throughout in addition to tinned raspberries, but really let down by lack of carbonation and a very thin and watery body, which applies to taste and feel. Not real sour, either."

"Pours a slightly murky reddish brown color with a decent sized off white heads that dissipates rather quickly. Aromas of raspberry jam, a hint of molasses, and a bit of earthy funk. The flavor Is lightly tart from the fruit with lots of berry flavor. Hints of dark caramelized sugars with a touch of citric tartness and earthy funk. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent enough brew, but I felt it could have had more of a pucker factor."

"Final Grade: 3.83, a B+. Boon Framboise makes for a nice summer treat, occupying a comfortable middle ground between sweet, fruity flavoured lambics and the funky, sour ones at the opposite end of the spectrum. While this is a good beer with a pleasant, tart, vinous flavour, it's not exactly wowing me. I'd be lying if I said I planned to buy it again any time soon, mostly because it's a little pricy in this market, but given the lack of good lambics around here it's still worth a pick-up or two."
""
""
"O/D - Sweeter than some takes on the style, but good. Liked it but the tartness could have been amped up."
"I liken this to a summer spritzer as opposed to a traditional Lambic. It's quite tame on the more traditional characteristics of the style but at the same time it's very refreshing and perfect for a light, fruity, thirst quenching beer on a hot summer's day."
"O - A delicious fruit lambic that is very refreshing on a hot summers day."
""
""
""
"I'm growing to like the lambics/sours. This is a very nice raspberry lambic. I'd love to have it with a slice of chocolate cake!"
""
""
"Pours a deep ruby color with a bit of haze and sediment. The aroma is full of raspberries and malty sugars. In the taste, tart raspberry and lemon flavor. There is a bit of oak but otherwise pretty jammy and slightly acetic. Has a slight musty quality and ever so faint bitterness about it but overall this reminds me of a wild raspberry champagne, not that Ive had one to compare. It is not as sweet as other berry lambics, which is refreshing here. I prefer this to the overly sweeter versions. This is a nice, balanced, lambic."
"O: Love these traditional lambics. Reminds me of Cantillon’s Kriek in its dryness, fruitiness, and no added sugar. Drank it on my 41st birthday, May 15, 2014. I read afterward that there are cherries in it, so I wasn’t just imagining it on the nose."

"I like Boon Framboise more than these scores may let on - it's only fault is not being as satisfyingly sour or seductively sweet as its compatriots. Still, it's a remarkably enjoyable offering, one worth the bigger price tag. And it's also a safe bet for initiates - this will make you plenty of friends."
""
"(3.5) D: This was good but not a lambic I would revisit given the generally subdued qualities. Just wish there were more lambics to choose from in Ontario stores."
""
""
"Overall - I can see this being a good intro into sours beers. Its got a light tartness but is in no way overpowering. Most of these types of beers are also a little cloying, this one keeps the sweetness in check. That being said, it is a little one dimensional - but decent and refreshing nonetheless. I'll pick up a few more bottles to have on hand to introduce others to the style."
"Overall - A very good lambic, that I certainly enjoyed, certainly a refreshing beer in the spring. Because of the price point for the quantity, this isn't something I'd pick up regularly, but would have again if offered."
""
""
""
""
"O: I found the tartness of this beer to be refreshing at first, but it became a little overwhelming toward the end. I am not sure I'd have this again."

""
""
"O - Overall, I find this a little weak. Accessible, but not exactly bursting with favour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not the best Framboise, certainly easy to find and not expensive to boot. A decent example of the style, but just a bit above average. Beats Lindeman's offering for sure."

"Great raspberry forward but lacking a bit of sourness and some of the complex flavors wild microbes bring in great lambics. Still a nice Framboise to sip on with great fruit and funk aromas. Smell is very nice. After having a lot of good and bad sours this stacks up pretty well. I probably would have been tougher on this earlier on in my reviewing but I now realize the true dedication it takes to brew a beer even this good."
"O- This beer drinks more like raspberry soda than beer. If you are expecting a Cantillion or a FFF sort of experience pass this bottle on by. In all likely hood this is the last bottle of this I will ever buy."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer for the price. At $7 for a bottle its far from the most expensive lambic out there, but its not overly complex. Probably wouldn't buy this again, but its a nice, fairly cheap, entry level framboise."
"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2013 Bottle with 9-27-2016 enjoy by date, enjoyed July 29, 2013. Pours a pretty deep red color with a small pink head. Aroma of sour vinegar and raspberries, with a bit of yeasty funk to boot. Flavor is up front raspberry with a twinge of sourness. Lingering yeast and raspberry. High carbonation and relatively light mouthfeel. Always love more raspberry, but overall a refreshing sour here. Not bad, but after a bit there is a strange unpleasant funk left in my mouth. I dunno what it is, I am new to lambics."
"Very enjoyable and drinkable sweeter fruited lambic like the Girardin Framboise."

"o - i wasn't expecting much and didn't get it. reminded me of a manishevitz wine. i won't go back to this one."
""
"Wasn't expecting too much from this, thankfully so. Almost more of a juice than a lambic, as it was pretty one-track minded and not very complex at all. An easy drink, no doubt, and something that may be nice to open with someone who doesn't care much for beer. But don't purchase this expecting Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen quality and you won't be too upset."

"An aged version. I love how the fruit holds up on this. And the beer has a superb clarity - at first. Then all the sediment starts getting in on the game and things change up. Consistency of flavor is the most interesting thing here. Brewing mastery that keeps the drinking experience interesting, even after so long. A real pleasure to be able to drink."
"O - So drinkable and tasty, this fruit beer is great for a raspberry beer but not that great as far as lambics go."
""
"Served ice-cold this is a perfect thirst quencher on a warm summer day. Drinking this on a freezing december night it brings back memories of summer, which is not the worst thing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a tasty lambic I have enjoyed over the years. I had it a few weeks ago at the BBF and happy to have gotten a bottle to take home too. World renowned and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This was by far my least favorite of the three. The flavors were just too barnyard dominante for my tastes, and the light, bubbly, airy palate is just not my style. This one was relatively hard to drink, and there's no way I'd be able to drink a bottle myself. Not my beer."
""
""
""
"If you like your lambics a little less sour than some of the heavy hitters, this is your man right here. Bridging the gap between the sweeter Lindemans or Mort Subite style and the sourbombs from Cantillon and others, this is a solid brew indeed. But if you're looking for that sour fix, this probably won't be your thing."
"O: A bit too young to enjoy at this point, but I could see this developing quite nicely with some age. No where close to the heavy hitters, but decent enough for off-the-shelf at €12, I guess."
""
""
"I haven't much experience with lambics. There just aren't that many available where I live. This framboise from Boon is a lot different than the offering from Lindemans. Where this one is very tart and acidic, the other is quite sweet and fruity. I suppose it's all a matter of preference, though die-hard fans of sour beers will probably insist that this one is more representative of the style. I like them both."
""
""
""
"Drinkability is ok, it's a reallly fruity lambic, not oude, which I prefer. But not what what was on the label either, so I can't ding them too much."
""
""
"Pours a clear crimson red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, sour raspberries, and raspberry puree. Taste is much the same but only mildly sour with some nice fresh raspberry flavors. There is also an acidic quality on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is neither too sweet or sour with some nice fresh raspberry aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O - Well, color me impressed how well this beer held up. It just so happens I got to try a bottle from 1995 the following week and it wasn't as good as the 1986. The perfect amount of sweetness, tart notes, and oak for me to enjoy with this much age."
"O: Pretty good but sort of simple. Some more funk/tartness might help."
"On a new style run tonight...my first Framboise and it’s pretty good, but also pretty one-dimensional. Alcoholic tart raspberry juice."
"Overall: I like this beer quite a bit. It's not as candylike as other framboise lambics I've had, and it's got a good overall balance and composition."
""
"O - I expected much more after sampling the Marriage Parfait earlier. I guess the two are completely different beers."
""
""
""
"Drink- Eh, Ill pass if I see this one again on tap. Wonder if any different from a bottle."
"A simple, sweet, raspberry beer, though too sweet and not complex enough to drink in much quantity."
""
""
"O - I was afraid this would be sweet, but was pleasantly surprised. The raspberry presence is very nice and the other components work well to yield a nice Framboise."
""
"Aroma deep deep raz, seems sweet. Slightly medicinal. Moderately sweet on taste, moderately tart, slightly puckering.  Perfect balance between sweet and tart. Tasty. "
"D - Overall, a decent and balanced Belgian lambic that was easy to drink. The premium price may be a bit steep, but compared to the price of Cantillon around here, it's not that bad. And to be honest, this isn't too far off from the Cantillon 100% Kriek I had the other night."
""
"O - Worth a try, but not worth continually dropping 7 bucks a bottle."
""
"A fresh balanced and nice sour ale."
"A flavorful lambic to me has the same effect that cat nip has to an awaiting feline. I wish I had another one to open, but at $7 a bottle, that's unlikely."
""
"O - Not the best offering from Boon but on a hot night with serve a thirst."
"Pretty light body. Drinkability is good. Not as complex as some fruit lambics but pretty nice if maybe a little on the sweet side."
"O: this is a nice authentic lambic, lacks the depth that Cantillon features in their brews, but worth a try nonetheless"
""
"Nicely done here, nothing is overly sweet or cloying like other sugared-up lambics can be but perhaps I was looking for just a bit more fruit flavor. It's still a nice beer and one I'd like to have another of sitting in the cellar for a bit longer next time."

"O- I think I'm finally starting to realize the craze of Lambics/gueezes/sour beers. They may or may not be the best beers you've ever had, but they sure as hell challenge your pallette and nose. Though this was ""cheap"" compared to others in the style, it certainly was still an experience and a pleasure to drink as I introduce myself to these styles."
"Not overly impressed, not the worst by any means."
""
"A very good beer overall, delicious with chocolate. With the first glass I had some trouble with the funky earth flavor but my taste buds assimilated thereafter. It is on the pricey side but I would buy this beer again."
"This poured out as a reddish looking color with a pink fizzy head that rapidly faded away. The smell of the beer is sweet and tart with raspberries. The taste of the beer was full of tart raspberry flavors with a bit of acidic vinegar in there too. The mouthfeel was not carbonated at all and felt like I was drinking a chilled wine. Overall this brew isn't the greatest in my opinion but it might be worth trying if you like this style."
""
""
""
"O: a good beer; I will try this more often; interested with what to pair it..."
"Both Boons I have had were similarly sweet- candy flavor. It really reminds me of robitussin. Not what I look for in a Belgian Lambic. More similar to a raspberry soda. I wanted to point out that there wasn't yeast/sediment/dregs on the bottom of the bottle. Seeing that pair with the taste really makes me think the beer was pasteurized, back sweetened, and forced carbonated like a keg."
"The CPJ"
"Poured a 1"" lavendar head fading fast. Dark violet in masstone but clear and watery during pour. Smells of raspberry syrup. Taste is raspberry, far far less sweet than other fruit lambics, but still so much fruit it overwhelms the beer aspects of the beer. And although the sour is present it is far less funky than I'd anticipated."
"Color is much paler and more natural than the Lindemans, with a thick foamy pink head. Similar raspberry funk aroma. Flavor is of tart raspberry juice with a funky edge, perhaps the oak. I'm pretty sure this lambic is hopped, because there's a really interesting play between the sour flavors of the lambic and bitter undertones in the beer. Where by ""really interesting"" I mean ""enough to get me to finish the quarter bottle""."
"O: decent but needs just a bit more sourness"
"O: This is probably the driest beer I've ever had; I can deal with this to an extent but when it totally takes away from enjoying the fruit, it's just no good. Fruit, funk, or sour- this beer needed more of at least one of those to be good. I can see why these are a cheaper option..."
"There were Parts of this beer I liked and some not so much. Pours a dark red, maroon, cloudy with visible sediment. Smells strongly of raspberries. Tastes strongly of raspberries, little alcohol is Present in the taste. Sour and tart and quite refreshing. Dry mouthfeel. I liked the taste of this beer and would consider drinking it again."
"O: Yet another beer from Boon that doesn't do it for me. Sadly they all can't be oude kriek."
"Much of the subtle character of the classic lambic notes are swamped underneath the immense raspberry flavor, sweetness, and feel. A good Framboise but there's a few nuances that make it almost world class."
"Overall: Nice brew, tastes like fresh raspberries."
"Overall: I would drink this again-- not as good as many other lambics I have had."
"O- The bitterness in the finish is a bit to strong but the nice bright fruit in the nose turns darker in the taste. There is not much depth in this beer with a little tartness and hints of funk hidden underneath."
"Overall a very refreshing beer with a complex flavor and great raspberry presence. Something is missing though..."
"this is what i am loving about my new sour craze the ones i least suspect are totally blowing me away in every way!"
"O: An easy drinking fruit lambic. Went very well with the chocolate dessert it was paired with. Would certainly consider picking up a bottle."
"( 33/50, 5% alc/vol, Home, from 1st Rochester trip) At the top of the glass, the beer becomes a bright and powerful red, but at bottom, it swims a pinkish orange hue. The head of white-orangeish bubbles starts low and stays at a healthy disc of dense bubbles. Good strong aromas of sweet raspberries. Though I would suspect their natural origin. Sour, acidic lambic aromas, well displaying the oak maturation. Smells creamy, sorbetlike. Like a raspberry yogourt. Slightly sulfurous, acrid raspberry flavours. Dry, oaky, old lambic acids come up with a metallic, odd bile-like acrid flavour. They smells right, but they don’t taste fresh at all. Still, as you finish the bottle, it gets easier and easier to handle. Great natural raspberry sediment. Acidic and sour, but the sourness is at an odds with something in the beer. The raspberry bitterness seems like raisin tannins. Acrid and powerful. Leaves a dry impression and robs a bit from the fruitiness. Sample is a year old, from the shelf of Beers of the world! So handling might have been an issue. This lambic would be much, much better served fresh in a barrel. This sample is a far ways from the coasts of Belgium. Would warrant another try. Otherwise, fresh red fruit-seeds, raw lambic acidity and a sulfurous, bile bitterness that puts us at odds with nice fruity flavours, oaked and aged."
"O: The flavor of the beer is excellent, and it avoids the artificial sweetness I taste in lindeman's. Good beer. I wonder what would happen with a year or two on it."
"O - I love the Boon fruit Lambics, I think they are some of the most drinkable fruit beers around, period. I have yet to be disappointed with one of these offerings and will continue to hoard as much as I can find. Cheers!"
"(D)- Easy enough to enjoy and savor, but a let down considering the style and other beers this brewery has out there."
"Drinkability: A good framboise lambic- most of them either have fake fruit flavor and no sourness or, even if they have a real fruit flavor also lack the sourness. This has both of those good fruit lambic flavors, but, again, this beer doesn't ever quite assert itself. Still more than worthy, though."
"Beer is thin but the heavy fruit presence on the palate makes the beer seem thicker. It is jelly flavored, strong raspberries and sweetened, at least it tastes that way. Eh, there's nothing wrong with it, there is even some mild tartness from the berries on the finish, it's a big big fruit beer."
"The beer appears a light brown hue with delicate rouge highlights and a quarter inch of head that dissipates within a few moments. The aroma brings raspberries, sugar, and jam with a touch of oak and just a slight funk. The flavor is overly sweet, with a formidable sugary raspberry presence. The sweetness becomes cloying after just a small pour. This beer was not in the same echelon of the great Belgian fruit lambics I have grown to love."
"I'm really impressed how well the fruit character has held up for 15 years. Tasting very ripe and juicy and bursting with raspberries. Other Lambic character is a bit muted by the fruit and the beer could certainly be more sour and sharp."
"D- Easy to drink, but very, very sweet. I would recommend this beer for this style."
"I do have a latent fear of sugary, fruity malt bombs, and likewise, enamel-dissolving acetic acid attacks (I'm looking at you, Cantillon), so it is quite pleasant to come across a level, fruity lambic such as this. Everything that the eponymous fruit promises, rendered in beer form. Good stuff."
"D: A generally well made, drinkable beer."
"D- If I am in the mood for a very dry framboise, this is it!"
"D - Low ABV? Check. Tart and delicious? Check. Awesome!"
"D-Very drinkable, like a fruit drink, not like a lambic. Some have suggested that this is a good beginners lambic, but if this were my first, I wouldn't have been motivated to try others. Especially at this price point ($10)"
"I tasted again today- same feelings."
"D: The beer is quite easy to drink."
"Sweeter than Cantillon, but heads and shoulders above things like Lindemans and St-Louis."
"Overall, a nice lambic in many ways but nothing ever really takes hold even to make me notice. Definitely not a bad beginner lambic, especially for the price."
"D- very drinkable, except for the price...a nice lambic, wish it was easier on the wallet."
"The feel of this beer is light and goes right through you and is leaving some interesting flavors on the way down but no heavy feel in the mouth feel. A great fruity beer."
"Boon Framboise was like an intermediate beer framboise, not the syrupy, fruit pop that some mass-produced fruit lambics are, but also not the challenging, battery acid, enamel stripping sour offerings from the more artisanal producers. The beer was a deep ruddy pink with a seemingly perpetual effervescence. The nose was full of raspberry and a mineral and earthy aroma. The beer tasted very fruity and dry, but again had minerally tang that I wasn't a fan of. The carbonation ample and paired well with a hearty vegetarian meal. Nice drinking, but at $12 a pop, I won't be a repeat buyer."
"I was looking forward to this beer and was disappointed. There is nothing wrong with it, but compared to a Cantillon or a Drie Fonteinen, I don't think it stands up."
"I could drink this all night until I started to miss my stouts. At 5% ABV I could drink this all night and still be able to spell stout."
"Small pour at Lambic Summit event. Of course it's trendy to dismiss this among the 3 Fonteinen and Cantillon offerings, as the previous rater predictably did, but in doing so one looks beyond the merit this beer offers. Pours a cloudy deep maroon. Nose of rich, seedy raspberries. Jam-like and really full. Much more naturally sour than the Boon Kriek given the nature of the fruit used, which makes the beer much more palatable. Really full-on seedy raspberries in the mouth. Pretty decent balance between sweet and tart elements. Certainly not as dry, sour, and complex as the unsweetened lambics at this event, but pretty good still. Finish is a bit weak. The best of the three Boon offerings at the summit."
"94 Points"
"D: I think this is the definition of a middle-of-the-road lambic. No real outrageous flavors and not really tart. Flavors are pleasantly mellow but body is a bit too carbonated at times. Still, worth a try as this one'll ease you into the more complex sours."
"Some of the harsher flavors are stopping me from appreciating this wonderful smelling brew. I think I might just go buy a pack of raspberries instead."
"The aroma of this brew is primarily raspberry sweetness with a very slight underlying of funk and earthiness. The taste is tart upfront with a sweet flavor of raspberry through the body and a lingering amount of sourness. Light feel with a moderate to low level of carbonation that leaves this brew feeling a bit watery. For the most part this brew tastes sweet and makes my mouth salivate, however it finds a way of finishing with a bit of dryness. The drinkability, it is hurt due to the watery aspect but it is easier drinking that say lindeman's take on fruited lambics that get a bit too sweet for me. Overall not bad but not something I would drink again."
"Always interesting and pleasant to drink."
"D= This is one of the better framboise that I have ever had. In my opinion I would say this is better than Lost Abbeys FdA. This is sort of the peak of framboise for me."
"Flavor is sweet, not sure if this has sugar or sweetners added...but it's refreshing, and no-where near the sweetness of a framboise like St. Louis or Lindemans. Tart aspect is decent and long lasting. Light, crisp mouthfeel...high carbonation. Fruit flavors are strong of raspberries, and the tartness contributes to the overall flavor at the perfect time to keep this beer from becoming too sweet. Very tasty, an easy drinker...a recommended Framboise!"
"D: I really don't understand the point of these sweetened lambics. If you're going to go through the trouble of making lambic, do it right."
"Notes: 2004 Vintage Mariage Parfait. This is a fairly sweet and fruit sour, but the raspberries also add a tartness as well. Some other fruit and acidic and funk aspects come out, but this is a very raspberry-centric beer. Pretty good and enjoyable beer, even if it didn't wow me."
"Deep Ruby in color, hazy with spritzy head. First scents are of tart and acidic raspberries, slightly herbal and medicinal. The taste brings what the nose dictates with hints of red wine vinegar, very artifically build to it. Medium bodied, dry. A decent beer that avoided being too tart or sweet."
"The palate opens quite medicinally sweet with raspberries and a mild harshness. Jammy, mildly fatty even. Mildly artificial in sweetness, this beer is medium light in body with a mildly metallic finish. Not terribly impressive."
"D- I would seek this out again. It was easy to drink and was perfectly balanced. I highly reccomend seeking this one out. Like I said earlier, it was a very pleasent surprise."
"Notes: One of my first non-sweetened lambics and I thought it was quite enjoyable. Not too sweet yet not pushing any extreme boundaries on the sour side either. The price is a bit steep so I would probably on continue to buy this one for special occasions."
"Very sweet with a nice sour funky tartness that is puckering without being overbearingly acidic. Nice oak tannis and slightly vinous with slight vanilla. Soft carbonation with a huge raspberry flavor and less funk than I expected. Well balanced and very quaffable."
"D: REally sweet to drink too much, but very enjoyable."
"For the taste, starts with some funkiness and ends with sweet raspberries. Fairly nice. Nothing earth-shattering but fine for what it is."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a cloudy red-purple with just a very thin layer of lace. Smell: cranberry-raspberry juice, fairly neutral yeast note, a little vinous. Taste: very juice like, but it's got a nice raspberry taste and tartness, and a little grape skin. Active carbonation despite the lack of head. Not bad."
"Dark red maroon color with a fizzy reddish head that fades quickly and leaves no lacing. Smells very sweet with raspberry notes and not much else. Tastes tangy sour upfront with some woodiness. Rounds out with a deeper, more subtle raspberry flavor than some framboises. Finish is puckeringly sour with some malty notes and tannins. Beer is on the light side of medium bodied with a somewhat sticky finish and lingering sourness. Light carbonation makes this fairly drinkable if this is your cup of tea. I personally do not find this beer appealing as it is not fruity enough or funky enough to catch my interest."
"D: I actually poured this one out halfway through, and that's unusual for me. Just couldn't drink it."
"D: An OK framboise, if you like them on the sweet side."
"Overall, a solid framboise (especially for the age!) and very happy to get to try this old of a beer."
"Had a bottle with dessert at the Farmhouse. This is a heck of a framboise. I sincerely wish Lindemans, which seems to be everywhere, was this good. It's not an ""oude"" fruit beer, but it still incorporates wild yeast and oak barrel character. To begin, there's a big, pure raspberry taste and aroma that's only slightly sweetened. The background has a crisp toasted oak with a hint of vanilla. The yeast adds a mildly tart lemon juice note and blends with the barrel to give off peppery and earthy background notes. Delicious. One of the best young fruit beers I've had."
"It is highly drinkable, not overpowering with sweetness and not prohibited by sourness."
"Pours a hazy, brown color with tan along the bottom of the glass. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of raspberry, tart malt, sweet malt, and acid. Fits the style of an Lambic - Fruit. Mouth feel is smooth, crisp, and slightly sharp. There's an average carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt, fresh raspberries, slight sweet malt, and noticeable acidity. Overall, a great flavors, good blend, and easy drinkability."
"Deep reddish-mahogany body, ruby tinted white head. Beautiful sweet raspberry aroma is juicy and slightly tart. As is the flavor. Raspberry juice with a touch of sweetness as well as a very mild, tart, brett-ish note on the finish. Some oaky vanilla notes too. Good introduction to the world of traditional lambics. Not stupid sweet, but not overly tart or funky either."
"I'd say one to try but nothing extreme"
"Not sure why this beer has been slammed - perhaps the 2000 vintage has aged more gracefully."
"D - Good would have some more but after having a rasberry tart from New Glarus would prefer that over this one."
"I find this framboise to be much more drinkable than most. It is very well balanced and not too strong on the tart or sweet flavors. I would still be worried a bit about the heartburn tho!"
"Overall: Really drinkable. The sweet fruity raspberry flavor is delicious then quickly becomes sour/tart, which fades to a sweet flavor making you want more. This is a great fruit beer, currently my favorite since it has the sweet/spicy malt character at the end."
"Overall I would say this is one of the better lambics I have had, though at this point i have not had many."
"Overall this is a nice apertif or dessert beer. The fruit component isn't overly sweet, but I still find myself craving something sour and truly complex like the Oude Kriek. Maybe someday an ""Oude Framboise"" will exist..."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It took me a minute to get into the tartness, but things were great from there out. This is a very nice Lambic."
"Drinkability.i like this beer alot ease to drink with one of my favorite berry flavors ,the price is expensive but worth trying even once ,this goes great with cakes and fruit tarts ,cheese cake you bet go for it."
"Overall it was a balanced lambic that was both easily sipped and gulped."
"A nice lambic, great fruit presense and quite sweet. That being said, a nice tartness and bitterness cuts through the sweetness providing a good balance. As much as i love the fruit, i wish there was a little more character to this beer. Still very good."
"The aroma is fruit, mostly raspberry but with some vague bread and a hint of iron. The taste is mostly tart with a very light sourness, light yeastiness, and faint berry flavour. It's tingly and rather dry with everything being mild. It doesn't have a strong tart berry flavour or as much of a lambic quality as I was expecting but it's still quite good and very crisp and refreshing."
"3.3/5"
"D - Well, if you like Lindemans et al, this is another one for you. Fruity, with a very straight forward raspberry flavor. Funk? not here. It is what it is, but if you're looking for depth in a lambic, look somewhere else..."
"Drinkability is OK here but Russian River has the market on sour beers."
"Poured a reddish color with a big pinkish head that dissipated pretty quickly. Aroma was of sweet raspberries. Flavor was also dominated by the taste of raspberries. Has a bit of sourness to it. Mouthfeel is very light, had kind of a wine feel to it. A nice beer that is probably to sweet to have more than one."
"Sweet and a bit sticky, good dessert beer. Extremely drinkable, but simple and on the cloying side."
"Looked to pour a rose color out of the bottle, settled on a light crimson color, with a nice white head at first, then a thin film. The aroma has a nice raspberry tang to it, and a slight lambic funk. The raspberries come out nicely in taste, nice and tart, slightly sweet at first, with a underlying oak and perhaps wheat just riding below the surface. The mouth is well carbonated, tart and puckering, good enough body and all. Overall, not nearly the best framboise that I've had, but still plenty nice."
"Nice raspberry bown color with a creamy pink head. The nose has a good amount of fresh tart raspberries, funky manure and musky oak. The taste was tart and sour with some light fruits and funky oak. A crisp body goes down easy. This is a damn fine lambic. Great balance between sweet and sour."
"Medium body with low carbonation. Nice to have the body mellow when the flavor is so sour. Easy beer to drink but I would recommend this as an after meal dessert more than a stand alone drink."
"not thin, slight texture and astringency. lively carb."
"this beer is pretty easy to drink. i think it would be better paired with food rather than a standalone drinker."
"D: Probably won't ever buy this again considering the price, but if I did I could see having a couple."
"heavy and slightly thick mouthfeel. there is a mild raspberry flavor hiding behind the lambic tartness. this one has much more of a bite and less sweetness than lindemans."
"This is a great beer for those warm summer afternoons."
"not as watery as i thought, actually quite decent..the excessive tartness makes this a one off for me though."
"hazy light brown with some reddish hues peeking through here and there. pinkish white head that shrinks to a thin coating pretty quikly, and leaves some, but not much, lace. nose is very nice raspberryish with some beer scent that come through just a tad. taste is sweeet, yet balanced very well by the sourness. tastes very real. hard to describe, this is outside of my usual realm. i do know that i've tried a few other lambics before and this is above and beyond the other framboise i've tried. perhaps i'll have to delve into this side of beerdom more often, i really enjoyed this as my dessert tonight."
"D - An interesting one that's for sure. I'd possibly drink it again but not on a regular basis."
"Pours a dark red color with a thick head that recedes with some lacing. Aroma is nice and sweet with an intoxicating, unmistakable strawberry scent. A slight sourness in the nose as well. Taste is very sour though with the strawberry taking a backseat in the mouthfeel. A bit funky as well but that's par the style. Still quite drinkable and not too sweet."
"Very true to the style."
"A tasty, unique (as certain oak, wine and gueuze characteristics intertwine in the lambic), refreshingly tart/dry, brew."
"Drinkability: This is a nice, mild, and drinkable lambic, light and tart but not too sour and definitely not too sweet. A good summer beer if you're looking for an alternative to the usual wits and weizens."
"Boon Framboise is a beer for the lambic lover much more than it is a beer for the fruit beer lover. My lambic experience is still in the novice stage, but I'm pretty sure this isn't a classic of the style, raspberries or not. Even though I'll be able to make it to the bottom of the bottle with no trouble at all, this will the last bottle that I ever buy."
"quite drinkable and quenching. a more than suitable framboise. that i'll try and rememeber to come back to when in the mood for the style."
"The taste leaves me a bit underimpressed. Notes of berry, plum, tart, wet paper, and some definate earthy notes; alot like eathing a blackberry that has yet to fully ripen. Accordingly, a sour tongue-lashing ensues after each sip. It's surprisingly refreshing and juicy, but the carbonation level is a bit flat for a corked bottle. Bottom line: it's not a bad choice if you're in the mood for a sour brew, but I can't imagine ever drinking more than one and I might look to other, better lambics than this."
"The smell was mainy sweet raspberry and with a slightly sour tinge, no doubt coming from the yeast. The taste, however, was practically an inversion of that: a tart puckering sensation to start and ending sour  though not necessarily because of the raspberry, more from the yeast. The sweetness detected in the smell was mostly absent. The carbonation was lively on the palate, but the overall feel was a bit watery."
"Once again, an okay dessert beer, or would do well complimenting chocolate, especially dark chocolate. However I'll be nursing this one for quite some time, with no need to run out and buy more until I have a special occassion for it."
"drinkability: surprisingly drinkable since the fruit flavor and sweetness are comparatively mild. if i didn't mind the goat smell/taste, i could probably have a few of these in an evening."
"I didnt really enjoy this beer, but that is a personal opinion. I know this is a true lambic (not the overly sweet, artificial fruit beers that others have labeled as 'lambic'. Good for the style, just not for me."
"Poured from a corked 355ml bottle. The beer pours with a nice red color and a large lightly pink head. The head sinks down to two finger widths that stays around and leaves some nice lacing. Smells lovely with a nice balance between the raspberries and the barnyard lambic smell. Taste is amazing. The balance between the sweetness of the raspberries and the acidity and tartness from the brett fermentation play together very nicely. The beer also feels very good in the mouth. The beer sets lightly on the tongue with a high level of carbination that almost tickles the tongue. A great framboise from Boon."
"Drinkability is very good."
"A great value sour lambic."
"Overall, this was quite drinkable. Has a ""real"" taste to it as compared to others in this style. Very traditional feel. More like a good champagne than others that tend to be more like a fruit juice. Classy. Not too sweet."
"I really like the Boon over any other Framboise I've tried because the presence an flavor of the raspberries come through, while the overpowering sweetness and tartness are somewhat curtailed. It's all in the balance."
"Notes: One of the better lambic's I've had the pleasure to drink."
"This is more of what I've been looking for in a lambic. Fairly clear red beer with a champagne head. A big waft of raspberries and horse blanket, oh yeah! Initially it starts out mouth puckering sour but after a little while you really don't notice that at all, this allows you to appreciate the sweet-tart raspberry flavors, yum. A very light body, way lighter (and dryer) than Lindemanns. Excellent drinkability I wish the bottle was bigger."
"Smells like strawberry shortcake. There's a great interplay of fresh fruit, tartness, and your usual musty/funky lambic aromas. Flavorwise, an easy tartness gives way to soft raspberry before that mild tartness reenters in this finish. Some may be curious how this compares to Lindemans Framboise-- well, Boon's features less raspberry flavor but I think the result is greater balance. I'll take Boon's."
"served, at Kulminator, with great ritual and care, with the basket to preserve serving angle, and all. I must confess I am impressed by this ritual. smells like a perfect balance between beer and fruit, with characteristic lambic tartness and slight funk. this is my ideal version. great balance. delectable and addictive. dry finish. oh so good."
"Overall: I don't have alot of experience with the lambic styles. This is only the second Framboise lambic I've had. I prefer it to Lindeman's on it's own. I find that it's not as sweet and just seems more well balanced; though I think Lindeman's wins as far as pairing with desserts."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Moderate carbonation accentuates the interplay of fruit with the wild yeasts... it flattens out a bit towards the end however. As far as lambics go, this doesn't venture too far outside the safe zone... but that's fine. This beer is a refreshing aperitif and palate cleanser between courses, and is worth trying."
"I really couldnt ask for much more... except another bottle!"
"D - The bitterness is a tad overwhelming, but otherwise this is a nice beer."
"37.5 cl green bottle, corked and bailed. $6.95 at Lee & Edwards in Roanoke, VA. Date on bottle 26.03.2007, price tag date of 12/03."
"I didnt really enjoy this beer. The raspberry part was OK, but the lambic had a stuffy, odd yeasty note that didnt go too well with the fruit."
"I enjoyed this with a cherry cheesecake for dessert."
"Tonight we shared a bottle of Framboise (I even let her drink her's out of my Linderman glass). Sweet and heavy raspberry aroma with a crisp bittersweet taste. A nice dessert drink to keep on hand."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is an underrated lambic that is full of character and very entartaining and unique. it really satisfies the palate wihtout overwhelming it. One of the better lambics I've had. It just really hit the spot on this late Sunday night."
"Not as light as I expected, more of a medium bodied feel, with very delicate carbonation. Drinkable, surely, but perhaps a slight bit out of balance. A nice quaff, but give me Rose' de Gambrinus anyday."
"Drinkable and smooth but a bit of overkill goin' on."
"Tasted the 2000 vintage. However it didn't say marriage parfait it had the 6.2% alcohol and on the back label they're mentioning Marriage parfait. Appearance is very nice with its pinkred colour and pink foam. Smell is sour, cherry/framboise notably but not as fresh as a fruitgeuze could be. Somehow I had that feeling as if a litle bit of motoroil drupped into this beer. Forgot that as soon as I took the first sip. Tasted it blind but liked the taste and aftertaste. Nicely balanced sour-fruittaste with some bitterness at the end. Hardly any malttaste but who wants that in a framboise beer."
"Taste is tart up front, hints of funky sourness. The sourness really builds as it warms. The funkiness grows too. There's some light sweetness but not much. Most everything is overwhelmed by the tart raspberry flavor. Lightly bitter and spicy in the finish, gingery. The mouth is a little thin but does not detract from the enjoyment. Tasty and tart, very easy to drink for the style. All in all a nice surprise and one I would not hesitate to pick up again."
"Finished dry which was ok. With all the tartness, the dryness just made the tartness that much more stronger. Good or bad? It's really personal preference in that department. This was ok, but for the price was it worth it? That'll be for you to decide."
"Bottle: Poured a deep red colored beer with a medium head with average retention for a lambic. Aroma is comprised solely of raspberry. Taste is also dominated by raspberry with a little tart and sour ending. This one is a guilty pleasure for me since I know it taste more like fresh raspberry juice then beer but I like it nonetheless. Very refreshing, I could drink a lot of this."
"Overall: A very nice Framboise, not too sweet, not too syrupy, but with a nice sharp/sour feel that lends a tangible Old School aspect to this one. Worth trying, if not to just remind you that not all Lambic-Framboise are for Girls!!"
"Pours a muddy red-brown color with no head and instant fruit aroma. Looks like port wine, but muddy. Aroma- gentle beer smell with light berry aroma, some sweetness, and being-in-the-woods organic (leaves & flowers). Overall very nice aroma. Flavor: not at all sweet like the aroma- slightly sour with the berry flavors. Not bright fresh strong fruits like I have had in some others, but musty and mulled. That doesn't sound good on the page, but it really tastes better. I am not a fruit beer lover, but this is pretty good, and would be a good way to cool off on a hot day when you want something light and refreshing with good flavor."
"This was a 1997 bottle drank with Kimchee, Martint, tiggmtl and Oakes. It pours darker than I expected, a rather deep brown, dirty soil alike with barely no head, but lots of flaoties. Aroma is very leafy with raspberry ""coulis"" notes, like youd put over a good ice cream. Hints of old books, dirt and earth. In mouth, acidity level is disappointingly low, its earthy with raspberry grains flavors, but ultimately just too sweet to be enjoyable. mouthfeel is thin-medium with moderate carbonation. Cloying finish with more of the leafy aspect."
"A pleasant suprise. This was an undated vintage bottle (late 90's probably). This poured our a dark pinkish colour with a small off-white/pink head of foam, that lasted for a bit, and left some interesting lace on my glass. The aromas are of sweet/tart raspberries and lambic funk. The taste is tart, sour, funky, and berry-like all at the same time. The mouthfeel is quite nice, as is the drinkability. This is the half way point between Cantillon and Lindemans. not quite traditional, not quite sweet. MOR."

"Addition: I later noticed a stamped ""best before"" date in a white space on the bottom of the back label of 06-06-2004."
"offerings this was a definite step above in quality."
"Smells lightly funky with lots of sweet raspberry aromas. Lightly sweet with a bit of raspberry seed taste to go along with the raspberry fruit flavor. A bit of sour acidity as well as a faintly musty taste. Fairly simple for a lambic type beer. A light red color that shows brilliantly clear."
"The mouthfeel is thin, but leaves a fruity residual taste behind, again, very wine-like. I guess if you're into this sort of thing, this would be drinkable for you, but it's not my cup of tea. It's not unpleasant, but perhaps it's more an acquired taste I'll work on. I have some Lindeman's Kriek, Geuze, and Framboise in the mini-fridge, we'll see what happens..."
"Pink/red, cloudy brew with a pink top. Aroma of raspberries and lambic sour/mustiness that's expected out of the glass. There may be even a hint of woodiness in the aroma. The body starts out med/light with a good wheat/malt base to balance the slightly sweet but potently sour raspberry flavor. It finishes dry and lemony and the carbonation seems to add complexity to the flavors on the tongue. I do like the sweet/sourness of this one and generally like all the Boon beers, highly recommended for the lambic explorers."
"Got this for my girlfriend and she liked it alot,poured a raberry-red with a bg fluffy head.Had kind of a musty smell wich was more preverlant to me than the rasberry smell.Started off very sweet like rasberry syrup almost but finished with some nice tartness.Almost sticky sweet,a little too fufu I guess for me,seemed real drinkable though."
"As Im in a bit of a sour mood, I thought this evenings samplings should all be Lambics, so here goes number two. A deep sanguineous color on the pour, the head modest in size, frothy in its consistency, the color a winsome raspberry red, as it evanesces quite quickly, the resultant lace a bit thin and clumpy. As one would expect the nose is like smelling a Raspberry tart, sweet and sour, crisp and clean, and a real treat for the beezeer. Start is ambrosial, chased quickly by the tartness, top is slender in feel, with the finish astringent, raspberry sweet, tart and quite dry, once again a quite good lambic, not great just quite pleasant to the palate"
"Hazy ruby raspberry red. Purple tinged white head recedes steadily into a thin, spotty layer that leaves sparse foam aggregates. Vibrant, freshly pressed ripe raspberries hit the nose at first, then are ceded by mellow lactic tartness and subdued hints of damp wool and must. A mildly tart lactic wash initially in flavor fades into a sweet and sour melange of ripe, sweet raspberry and sour, citric kumquats. Understated, ghostly wisps of dryish, bready grain emerge late. Light in body, but with a pleasantly smooth, coating mouthfeel. Finishes with a snap of fruity fructose sweetness that yields to drying, clean tartness. Quite an enjoyable lambic. It's not overly complex and seems intermediate in character between the cloyingly sweet Lindemans and the puckeringly deeply tart classics. Boon Framboise nonetheless retains an elegant quaffability."
"Smellability is high, but drinkability is pretty low due to so-so taste, and disappointing mouthfeel. Certainly not up to Boon Kriek or Marriage Parfait in my book."
"Compared to the Lindemans this frambroise is a little thin in body and flavor. A really nice red color with a sweet reapberry nose. I thought that the taste was a little thin not much fruit more of a champagney taste to it. Worth a try but only once."
"You think its gonna be sweet when you smell it, but its only slightly sweet at the start, then tart, slightly sour and lots of fruit, very nice and refreshing."
"Raspberry and astringent nose (wild yeast).  amber in color with a white lace.  Malty slight raspberry taste followed by slight bitter finish.  Not as sweet or as tart as lindemans."
