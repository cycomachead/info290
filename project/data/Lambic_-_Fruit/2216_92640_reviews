"Has a lively carbonation, bready soft malts, which interact well with the huge, but gentle cherry fruitiness. At no point does the sourness of this beer roll over the fruity cherry impression, which comes along with red vinous grapes and a subtle oak defined maltiness. Bretts stay in the background of the composition, they only support the cherries with an enjoyable tartness in the end, accompanying the fermented fruits. Oakiness goes incredibly well with the bursting cherries print, exposing their full-bodied, smooth fruitiness. Wine and oak define the body of this beer, leading to a well balanced, superior cherry fruitiness."
""
"The palate opens quite pronouncedly sour, lactic and lemony with a leathery sour cherry character being most noticeable up front. This then yields to a fruity mid-palate with plenty of cherry flavor ranging from the bright tartness of sour cherries to the floral and fruity complexities of the sweeter varietals. Funk in the form of earth and barnyard are present. Drying, faintly sweet and very tart on the finish, this is very enjoyable. A faint oiliness is present, a heft from the cherries that isn't present in a regular kriek (including the Lou Pepe) adds a unique dimension to this beer. It does, however, get in the way of the lemony base lambic and the tannins from firming up on the finish , leaving it just a little watery instead. All said, though, this is a marvelous beer, though maybe not worth the $24 or so it goes for retail."

"I really like a lot about this beer, awesome sourness, huge cherry nose.  But I can't get over the fact that it reminds me exactly of all the terrible cough medicine I used to drink as a kid."
""
"This is medium bodied, moderately carbonated and overall very enjoyable. Calling it intense red is very fitting. The cherry character is the star of the show...almost to a fault as it hides what I love about 3F. Still worth trying and something I would buy again if the price was right."

"12.7 oz bottle poured into shaker. Clear red to purple with no head or lacing. Aroma is tart cherries, cherry cough syrup, sour cherry, breadcrumb malt, and some oak. Taste is moderately sour with lactic acidity under cherry skin flavors, lightly sweet cherry juice, and if you focus there’s a little wood and leather bitterness; the medicinal flavor is prominent, which I find unfortunate. Light to medium body, sticky texture, low carbonation, and a lip-puckering dry finish."

"What a beer! Thanks to clay station for acquiring and sharing this rare beauty. A ruby red color like a fire truck, true to its name, an intensity and vibrancy not seen since atrial. Not much head on it, but it doesn't need one. Aromas of exploding pie cherries and cherry jam, funky as anything I've had from these guys, and quite heavy in the lacto. It's mature and my mouth is watering hard. The cherry flavor is so robust and sour, like candy almost, brilliantly alluring, sexy, oh man. It's even more cherry forward than their other krieks, although I don't know by how much. Sour too, I thought it might be cloying, but it's just perfect. Oak mellows it's feel a lot, it's really dry too for what it is. I wouldn't change a thing here, but it would be so sick to line all these krieks up for one tasting. You can taste it for miles, more depth with every sip, and a pungency uncommon even in the wild ale world here on the yeast. Up there with any I've ever had, I'm in love!"

"Thus far the best kriek I've ever had! Intensity is the proper description of this one! Delicious!"
""
""
"Pours an extremely dark garnet hue (which is what Helltown's Kriek should have looked like instead of pink lemonade). Wads and wads of cherries on a sour tone. Kind of a punch in the mouth with not as much nuance on the character as I would have hoped for. But it's still good. Just as a sour should be in all aspects. Definitely glad to have a chance to try a new version of the real deal."

"I enjoyed the heck out of this beer.  In terms of pure fruit beers it is one of the best I have ever had, but judged against other lambics it lacked a bit of the complexity to put it in the upper echelon.  4.25 is a harsh rating honestly, that is more of a comparison to other lambics.  Compared to other fruit abominations I have tried, this is a 4.5 easily."

"Pour is transparent blood red with almost no head, a touch of dark purple foam on top.  Nose has lots of cherry up front with a moderate amount of funk.  It's gets a bit leathery after the traditional  earthy mushroomy funk with a bit of rubber band.  Taste is stronger cherry, pitted ripe dark red cherry.  The funk is lighter, a touch earthy and some rubber band through the back.  Fairly sour finish with a light body and strong carbonation."
"one of the best krieks there is. so damn sour but so much cherry flavor too. just amazing. body is full and drinkability is to die for."

"Deep purple ish red color with a pink head. Free of sediment. Smell of fresh cherries, musty oak, sourness. In the taste, tart fresh cherries, lambic sourness, hay. The cherries really exhibit fine flavor and the sourness rounds things out perfectly. Nearly puckering but still quite balanced. Medium bodied, medium carbonation and finishes with cherry, tartness and a semi dry oak. Overall, it's an easy to drink, balanced sour and very tasty."
""
""
"Cherry bomb with the same 3F classic sourness and funk. I was expecting something sweet after what friends said but this is sour and funky to me with a boost in cherry presence."

"2 year old bottle. Pours beautiful red, no head, but beautiful. Smells of vinegar and cherry. VERY dry, unexpectedly so. Tastes of vinegar, cherry, and a bit of salt. Oak and wine notes throughout but more present at the finish. Finished dry and sour, but with a linger that I also didn't expect. Great beer."
""
""
"Overall- Awesome lambic. More carbonated than I remember from having it at The Festival before it was available in this country. So goddamn good. Juice."

"O: Sour to the extreme: don’t drink unless you’re alright with having the enamel stripped off your teeth. But damn is it good (if not addictive). Cheers."

"Pours a colorful, beautiful ruby red with a pinkish bubbly (thin) head. Not really carbonated (bottled in November 2012). Love the smell of sour cherries. The taste is of the same. Tart and sour cherries. This is mouth puckering, love the feeling on back end of my cheeks. Light to medium body, slight carbonation, tart too. Overall, a delicious sour brew."

"Overall this is a delicious lambic with great cherry notes. Intense cherry notes. Some nice dryness and sweetness that slightly balances the acetic tones."
""
""
""
""
"O: Drinkable but a dominated by an intense cherry flavor. I like cherry but it has an artificial and medicinal quality to it. Somewhat enjoyable and I'm glad I tried it, but I will not purchase again."
""
"Overall good but not great, it's a decent beer with nice cherry but a little too much in some ways and not enough in others. This doesn't seem like a 3F beer, more like a cheaper Belgian kriek than the awesome stuff they usually put out."
""
"O - Overall I enjoyed this beer, carbonation is lacking but the cherry isn't too fake."
"Light body with minimal soft carbonation. The big fruit aroma didn't translate in taste, unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So yeah, this is pretty intense. A good deal of pucker power in this one. It proved far too intense to pair with my duck breast, but as a stand-alone beer it's a great drink."
""
""
"Drie Fonteinen Intense Red Oude Kriek ---4/5."
"I was told by the store owner that this was a one-off beer, because 3F had accidentally used too many cherries. If that's the case, then I'm glad that I got the chance to try it out, and sad I didn't get more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent but probably my least favorite Drie Fonteinen to date. The must is out of control and the cherries just can't make up the difference. Compared to the Allagash Red this was nowhere near as good, and they are about the same age."
""
""
""
""

"Wow! No added sweetener and an experienced lambic blender makes for one badass brew! Expensive, but worth every penny."

"(O)- Very disappointing considering Armand is behind this; it is not up to his usual mastery of the style. Also considering the $16 price tag on this, you are better off with something else for the style."

"O- Good kriek. Maybe a bit overvalued by price, but I'd drink again for sure."
"375 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a dark red/purple color with a half inch pink head. Both the head retention and lacing are good. The brew smells like tart cherries, raspberries, and some funk. It tastes like tart and sweet cherries, raspberries, grapes, funk, and some blackberries. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with low/moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I liked it. However, it is pricey at $17.99 a bottle."
"I suppose that one could call this a balanced fruit lambic, especially from this particular brewer. Maybe the intent was otherwise, but the cherry, while pungent, isn't quite the palate-wrecker I was expecting. Tasty, like an unsweetened fruit pie, and well worthy of a try."
"The carbonation is somewhat subdued leaving a light tingle as the light er bodied lambic goes down smoothly. Light tartness that reverberates through the jaw."
""
""
"A"
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Tart red cherries upfront. Then some lemon zest, vinegar, light bready malt and unripe raspberry. Just a touch of oak and cranberry as well. Finishes medium dry with a lingering red cherry sourness to it. Lacks much carbonation, which would do well to help these flavors along. Just doesn't have the complexity of the Oude Kriek or the Schaerbeekse. Not bad by any means, but nothing too special."

"D - Intense is appropriately named when it comes to the cherry flavor."

""

"overall, a decent lambic. tart and to the point. ""made with 40% cherries""..."

"Amazing depth withi one dimension"
""
""
""
""
""
"Huge cherry flavors with a touch of funk and vinous notes. This is great in terms of fruit flavor. A total cherry bomb, but it comes at a price. I think I may have paid $18 for this 375ml. Oh well, a nice treat."
""
""
""
"I'd go as far as to say that this is probably the best fruit-based beer that Drie Fonteinen makes. Simple but so deliciously in your face. Intense Red is aptly named and totally awesome!"

"Bottle from Tipples to tulip glass. Pours a deep dark red with a very smal bright pink head thanks to a vigorous pour. Big sweet and sour cherry and vinegar aroma, dry, and maybe a hint of the oak and vanilla. Flavor is sour cherry vinegar up front with an oaky finish. A bit of a musty undertone. Not as dry and effervescent as I expected, with only low to medium carbonation. Lingering cherry malt left on the palate. Very much on the lambic and wheat flavor more so than the cherry overall, which is good and keeps it from being medicinal like I get from some krieks. Overall a solid offering, but would not spend $18.99 again for 12.7 oz."

"As a side note, it kinda makes me mad. 3f here is like a rock band that decides to make a weird and mostly crappy album just to see if people will praise them for it."
""
""
"For the price I had to pay for this beer at a bar, it probably ranks as the worst beer purchase I have ever made."

"O/D-Definitely worth a try. The cherry came off as a bit artificial in some aspects of the flavor. Then, the other parts were great and made up for it. A sample pour was good enough and I don't think it would be worth $20 for a 375ml."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Okay, but not what I was hoping for. This will age well, I'm sure, but the cherries need to subside substantially."
""
"Verdict: Definitely an enjoyable beer from Drie Fonteinen, but I'm not convinced it's better than Oude Kriek. It needs a bit more carbonation, but the cherry is definitely front and center, and executed perfectly. It just doesn't offer too much else like their Schaerbeekse Kriek or Oude Kriek."
""
""
""
"Very interesting kriek. Its so heavy on the cherries, it tastes like a thin but flavourful cherry jam. Highly recommend trying at least once for any sour head out there. Don't know if I would recommend buying more than one bottle though, given its price point ($19.99 for a 375ml bottle). You're better off spending another $5 on a Golden Blend, which is a deliciously world-class sour."
"If resting entirely on first impressions, the beer is a less dry Kriek than is expected from the great brewers. But a few sips in the beer begins to open up in highly unexpected ways. Sure, its not as tart or as sharp as traditional Lambic, but if you are like me- a big fan of the more balanced Flanders Reds, then this Kriek might also find favor."
"Overall: I really prefer my kriek to have more carbonation than Intense Red has. It has satisfying sourness and nice funk profile to balance, but the carbonation could be a deal breaker for serious sour beer afficianados."
"O - Expensive, flat, and sort of boring. This was just not very good. The aroma is nice but this is a serious downgrade over the standard Oude Kriek."
""
""
""
"O - Cherries, and lots of them. Nice fruit without being overly sweet."
"O: A beautiful-looking beer with a potently funky nose, a very mild fruit character, and a surprisingly moderate acidity level on the palate. Certainly not my favorite kriek ever, but definitely enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell is incredible, the taste is good, and the mouthfeel is lacking. I believe Oude Kriek is the better beer, but I would just be nitpicking. This is still tasty stuff."
""
"O: very good beer, incredibly interesting. It's more cherry-full than Lou Pepe Kriek, and almost like a pinot noir. I would probably buy at least a few more at this price. I'll be interested to see how it ages since there is so much flavor at this point."
""
""
""
"Overall. A fantastic kriek as expected. Would like to try this again in a few years to see how intensely sour it will become."
"Anyone calling Intense Red ""fake"" needs a reality check..."
"It's good. Loaded with enough cherry to kill a moose."
"I know I've been spoiled by some other sours because I wouldn't necessarily describe this as ""intense."" It is very tasty though. I would be happy to drink it again."
""

"O - Great beer! Wish I got more."
"Overall: A tastefully done kriek. The cherries are really in your face, but almost taste slightly fake. For that reason, I cannot get behind this beer. My vote is to stick with Cantillon Kriek as the #1 cherry beer."
""
""
"I really had no idea what to expect from this one, but I really enjoyed it. Strong fresh cherry jamminess overpowers some, but the flavor is so good it doesn't matter. Not as complex as some other 3F, but delicious nonetheless. I wish I would've ordered more"
"The beer is a deep ruby color with a pinkish-purple head. The aroma is all about the cherries. in your face sweet and tart cherries, gravitating to the sweet side a bit. I don't want to say the beer is one dimensional, because it isn't. However, cherries really steal the show here. Juice and jam, with just a bit of oak and tart character. An outstanding beer, even if not my favorite kriek lambic. Armand has created a nice little deviation here. A wonderful pairing with chocolate."
"Overall - It is an intense cherry flavor. Delicious cherry if nothing else."
""
"Overall: Not the most sour, funky or complex lambic ever, but if you're looking for a cherry bomb, this one is for you."
""
""

"Bottle shared at the RateBeer Gallery event in SF. Pours deep cranberry red with very little head. This beer is ridiculous. Absurd cherry pie aroma and flavor, complete with cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg. Tart but not really sour. Literally a beer expression of eating cherry pie or cobbler or something. So goooddd. The grown-up real Belgian version of NG Wisconsin Belgian Red."
"From bottle at The Festival. Beautiful dark red pour with thin pink head. Beautiful, bright berry aroma - cherries of course, but so much more - raspberry and even blueberry notes, really fruity, very subdued lambic character. Taste is also very fruity without being overly sweet - low lambic character but mostly because of its young age rather than too much sugar. Palate is smooth and silky, med-dry with medium carbonation. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark maroon. Too dark to see through. Looks almost black in sufficient quantity. Small pink purple head. Only a ring of bubbles lasts more than a minute or two. Smells strongly of cherries. Good acidity. Solid lambic funk. There are some deeper berry and red wine flavors. Taste is actually sweeter than expected. There's a ton of cherry juice in the beer. Some light horse blanket funk. Mild to medium sour pucker in the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty normal. There's some body to the beer. I really enjoyed this one, but it wasn't quite what I expected. Lots more juicy cherry sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is worth trying, but is greatly lacking in funk, sour, and complexity. I look forward to seeing what time will do to this though. If you love Kriek's, you'll still enjoy this. If you don't..."
""
""
"Opaque ruby, substantial fizzing but little to no head accumulation, just some surface bubbling. Cherry pie, some sawdust, pine forest. More cherry-pie fruit, some apple pie spice, deep sourness, an oak quality, less complex than a traditional kriek. Mildly cloying in the mouth, which works itself out. While it's supposed to be billed as an aperitif, I would suggest only a small serving to let the acidity open up the mouth for other things."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm sorry, but I think the emperor has no clothes. This strikes me as a batch that wasn't very good, that then had a ton of fruit dumped in and still isn't very good."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a deep and dull looking maroon with a light pink halo of head that modestly laces. The nose is quite potent with booming notes of cherry (not cough-syrupy) and funk. The taste presents even more aspects of the cherry including the leaves, pit, and twig, mixed with some funk...interesting. The mouthfeel isn't nearly as tart as expected with bold cherry sweetness upfront and a semi-dry, lingering tartness. I expected something that was a lot more tart and dry, possibly just a bit underdeveloped. I think this is definitely a potent kriek that highlights the cherry in a unique way. I'd let it hang out in your cellar a bit before opening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Woh, another masterpiece from Armand. This is very complex and actually, I would not advise to try this to someone unused to Drie Fonteinen. But this is definitely one of the best offer from this blender. And I see this aging very well."
""
""
"Beautiful pour. Hazed dark blood red color with an iridescent dark pink head from a hard pour. Aroma is pure cherry flesh, slightly tart, light vanilla, graham cracker by cherry pie association; sweet and fruity but not particularly ""lambic""-y. Flavor is fairly sweet to start; fresh cherry pulp and skin with a light sour finish. Some acidic and doughy notes linger in finish. Medium thick body with very soft carbonation. From the color and aroma I'd guess this almost has too much fruit? I'd expect trying this again in event just a few months might be a much different/enjoyable experience, but fresh this is disappointment lacking much depth, complexity, acidity or just all around, good ol' lambic ness."
""
""
"Overall the beer feels too young and lifeless. It's not particularly fruity and the acidic character is far to weak/fleeting, and the body is just way too watery. It has a great impressive bold nose, but then it makes what happen next even more disappointing."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark red with a foamy red head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with cherry fruit, cherry skin, and cherry juice aromas. Taste is much the same with intense sour cherry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic cherry presence that is super tasty and easy to drink."
