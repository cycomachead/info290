"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style and it seemed to be inline with the other lambics from Lindemans with this one showcasing apples and I think it does a good job of it and it makes for a good dessert beer.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little refreshing, clean, a little crisp, a little sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think half a small bottle is the perfect amount for me.  What I like the most about this beer was how well the apple was showcased.  What I like the least about this beer was that the funky yeast didn't show up in the taste like it did in the aroma.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a nice dessert beer and I would recommend it trying it, especially if you like apple beers and dessert beers.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I think the sweetness and lack of complexity held it back a little, but in the end I did enjoy it for what it is.  It's not a favorite Lindemans beer and it's a little above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a tasty apple lambic, keep it up."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/9/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lightly tart green apple, pear, white grape, hay, grass, candi sugar, light honey, slight funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of apples, pale malt, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of tart green apple, pear, white grape, hay, grass, candi sugar, light honey, slight funk, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, candi sugar, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of apples, pale malt, and fruit yeast flavors; with a good sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is a very good sweetened fruit lambic style. All around good robustness and balance of apples, pale malt, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. This is more pleasantly flavored than the other variants, but still a nicely enjoyable offering."

"Not something for everyday. Pretty interesting beer. Great with all types of fruit desserts, such as a fruit tart! I give it a 81. This cost 6 dollars at total wine ... Not worth the price for sure !!!"

"O: A pleasant beer, not as sweet as most of the beers in the style, which is a good thing. No complexity but you don't really expect anything more."

"O: One of the more preferable flavors in my opinion. Still way to sweet for me to drink regularly. I gave the second half of the bottle to my unknowing wife, who as if on cue exclaimed: “It’s like a jolly rancher!”"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden amber with a decent head. Tons of sediment at the bottom. Smells like apple and tastes like it too. Nice clean and refreshing. Reminds me more of a champagne than a beer. Sweet with no link to a beer. Nonetheless, a nice refreshing beer for a summers day."

"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
""
"I really like Lindeman's Framboise (raspberry juice! great!) and have been curious about the apple for a while. So, the apple is good but not amazing. It's like fizzy apple juice--which is what I was hoping for--with a hint of beer taste, which makes it more interesting than apple juice. It tastes light and not too too sweet, and I would definitely have it again, but I would probably go to the raspberry first."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A sweeter and tasty apple Lambic that is a rather easy and pleasant drinker."
"Loads of tart or sour green apples in the flavor with a smooth enough malty character hidden deep within. It is what it was meant to be."
""
"I was not anticipating a good beer after the aroma, but this is really quite good. It's not as good as their Kriek or Gueze, but I haven't had any other Pomme Lambics to compare it against. I'm sure it's not the best in the style, but it's still very tasty. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Starts with sweet apple, then a blast of sour green apple (not as an intense sour as compared to other lambics though). With a musty finish with a touch of funk. Mouthfeel is light with above average carbonation, a bit sticky from the sweetness."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice crystal clear golden in color with a thing white head. Some lacing was seen with each sip unlike a hard cider or a Redd's even. The aroma is of fresh apples and grain. That taste wasn't as strong as the aroma but was pretty good. Lots of apple taste with a slightly dry finish. Not too sweet as some other hard cider type drinks"
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd recommend it to anyone serving cheese, fondue etc."
""
"O- this was much more sour than expected, much more than their framboise. I dint know if the two years of age has anything to do with it or not. The sour notes were very enjoyable, but the apple flavor itself seemed rather one dimensional"
""
"Overall I could see why this was marked down with a new ""apple ale"" every five minutes this one was pushed way in the back. Still like the sour cherry and Framboise it taste more real that that artificial stuff. Even for just under 6 bucks its really not worth a revisit."

"Overall it's not that cidery but it's not quite beer either. It's alright, but considerably sweeter on the palate than on the nose."

"overall extremely sweet. desert beer here. it is what it is."
""
""
"Crisp and bubbly mouth. Drinks spritzy and refreshing. A nice beer to toast with. Tart green apples. Sweet juicy flavor. Light tart finish. Not cloying and not too funky. A nice balance of tasty goodness here. I dig it, and my wife loved it. I could see this being a regular in the warm months, and would make a nice alternative to cider in the fall!"
""
"Overall this is a solid fruit Lambic, the fruit in this case being apples, is there in abundance. This is a sweet, refreshing brew which will go down well on a hot summer day. I don't think I could drink to many of these in a row without something a little bitter in between in order to balance out the sweetness but the sour helps to balance the sweetness and this brew is well balanced between sweet and sour."

"Poured from a bottle into a flute, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, yellow-gold coloring with a steady flow of carbonation and a frothy, light, bright white head that forms a sparse surface coating as it settles. Aromas of apple tart and sweet, with some subtle grassy highlights. Flavors are more richly sweet than the nose leads you to believe, with a tart, candy-like apple sweetness blended with hints of a roasted apple sweetness. Light, crisp, and effervescent in mouth, the beer has a tangy sweet aftertaste. Light, crisp finish with a subtle tartness lingering behind."

"O- Very nice tasting beer, bit too sweet and not sour enough for my liking though, could easily confuse it for a cider"

"O: Delicious and refreshing beer. Glad to have found this one though it was overpriced. Not one I would particularly go out of my way for as a cider where available would do the trick if you are going for this sort of flavour. I do enjoy it immensely, and it has more body than most ciders. Would go well with fatty meats."
""

"Overall: Well I preferred this to the Lindeman’s geuze, but it is still a little worrying that this stuff is marketed as lambic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the better pairings of beer and apple. The lambic retains enough presence that you don't wonder why you didn't simply grab a cider."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a flute glass. Very bubbly appearance and a solid head is retained. Towards the bottom of the bottle were numerous floating particles as well. The nose is, not surprisingly, apples with some brown sugar as well. The taste is very sweet, almost like hard cider with the apple being the dominant flavor. Although this has a one-dimensional approach at first sip, the beer's complexity becomes apparent at times, hints of sourness especially. Overall, a good beer that will definitely turn some off with its pungent apple taste but once you get past that, there is much to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"In this case, I must say that my enjoying of this beer definitely comes from bias on my part to its flavors taking me back to my childhood memories, where candy was quite predominant. It's still pretty mellow, and exactly as I expect an apple beer to be. Looking forward to trying more from Lindemans soon."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the wet juiciness of the included fruit. Each sip of this beer left your mouth watering for more, but with just enough punch and pucker to the tartness to make you take your time. The nose is fresh and soured, again, with all the necessary fruitiness and pop for a solid execution. The feel follows suit, making the case for this guy even stronger."

"I've only had the pleasure to try Lindemans apple and raspberry lambics, and I definitely prefer the apple to the raspberry. When poured, the head was a beautiful and fluffy white with the color of the beer being a cloudy amber, similar to the color or apple juice but without the clarity. It was tart and crisp, sour with the pleasant tastes of the wild yeast very much in the background and subdued. The carbonation was very appropriate; not overly or under. Medium thin mouthfeel. Lindemans pomme lambic was enjoyable and easy to drink; it's a great ""celebration"" beer that can easily be used in place of a Asti champagne."
""
"Final Thoughts: Literally like drinking sparkling apple juice. Would I drink it again? If I'm in the mood for something sweet."
"O: strongly apple flavored beer suitable for non-beer lovers as an introduction to the lambic style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff is tasty. But I'm slightly biased towards green apple. It doesn't have a strong beer character, and even the ""lambic"" notes are secondary to the tart and sweet flavors and aromas of the apple. This stuff is certainly delicious but I'd have to limit myself to one. Almost more of a juice than a beer."
""
"O - Maybe a touch too old, but its still a tasty fruit lambic. The general hatred towards this brewery is understandable but fruitless (pun) in my opinion. They don't produce uber limited stinky brett walez, they make attainable and well priced sweetened fruit beers. If you like apples, you won't hate this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like Lindemans Apple!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall another good lambic from Lindemans, though not my favorite, as I like dark fruits better. This one is straight up sweet green apples; I think if you like hard cider and apple juice you would really like this one."
""
""
"Pours slightly cloudy reddish-golden beer with decent off-white head and specific sediment. Smell of cider and green apples, no more. A taste follows the smell - sour apples, good carbonation, light body. Very light and drinkable summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Lindemans stange. Pours a light orange amber with a small white head. Pleasant sour apple aroma. Carbonated sweet and sour apple flavor finishing with sour apple and a slight bitterness. Pleasant light bodied lambic, much like a sparkling cider. I enjoyed it."
"Overall, this is a nice tasting beer, but it's a bit too sweet and not sour enough for my taste. When I'm drinking a lambic, I want to know I'm drinking a sour beer. This is sweet enough to almost make one confuse it with a cider."
""
"Tried a bottle of this at Gigs in London. Pours a golden yellow/orange colour. This instantly reminded me of a Jolly Rancher with the strong apple flavour and slight sour finish. It would be hard to drink a lot of this, but its crazy how much apple flavour they were able to get into it. Interesting beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: a really delicious lambic, i enjoy it not necessarily more than their other lambics but rather just differently, the fruit notes are more up front and sour, its really delicious but one would have to be my limit on this one, delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Instead, the sweetness here really kills it for me, but thankfully, it isn't as bad as some of their others, but nowhere near as good as the gueuze."
""
"D - Another fantastic Lindemans offering, but I wouldn't expect anything less from a brewery that's quickly becoming a favorite of mine. Definitely another one to revisit this summer on a nice hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pleasant, tasty, and refreshing, but not quite as complex/balanced as their Framboise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, anfantastic beer for peoplenwho are not a fan of bitter hops in their drinks. Excellent post-nosh brew."
"O- A great example of this style, but not my first choice of a beer, since this isn't my favorite style. Great if you like a fruit beer, though."
"O - Clearly not the most authentic of lambics but it is very refreshing and bloody tasty. Give it a shot."
""
"This beer has a clear golden body with a bit of nice white head with good retention.A bit of spotty lacing clings to the outside of the glass. The aroma was not as sweet or cloying as the framboise. It gave me hope that maybe this would not be the sweet mess that that beer was. Some green apple and very mild funk. The flavor was like a melted green jolly rancher. Sweet, sour apple, not very appealing. Mouthfeel was way too heavy and carbonation was too low. Interesting beer, but it was really just not at all my preference. Way too sweet, almost like sucking on a hard candy."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer far exceeded my expectations. I had had many cider style beers and wines before but this one did a great job of actually keeping the apple flavor and really bringing it to the front. As far as the apple flavor category goes this went above and beyond other offerings. It put the framboise to shame."
"O: I probably enjoyed this more than most people do. I'm a fan of hard ciders, and this one tasted like a hard cider aged in an oak barrel. It's complex, refreshing, and damn good. I don't know if Lindeman's just uses apple syrup or the real thing...and...frankly, I don't care because the result is amazing."
""
""
""
"O - a good example of a apple lambic."
""
"Overall I enjoyed it as I enjoy almost all of Lindemans offerings."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 355 ml bottle into a Lindemans flute. Dark champagne color and very clear with active carbonation. Two finger head that quickly dissipated. Smells really nice of apple, pear and some herbals, very sweet smelling. Taste mimics the aromas very closely. At first this was terrifically refreshing but as it went down and warmed a bit, the sweetness got a big cloying for me. This tastes very similar to pear ciders that I have had but with more carbonation. I would turn to this for a refreshing summer beverage."
""
""
"Nice, crisp apple flavor with the slightest sourness on it. Reminds me of, again, apple jolly ranchers. Thin with higher carb and a wet finish. Yummy beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 8 oz flute glass. Pours a straw yellow, with a one inch white head, that falls quickly. Very little lace. Smell is very strong apples and champagne. Taste is like hard cider and champagne were mixed 70% cider and 30% champagne. Body is fairly thin, I don't have very much experience with the style, I assume this is usual. Lots of carbonation and easy drinking, if you can handle some sour apple. This is so different than a beer, it amazes me that it is called beer. Not a bad change of pace."
""
"Overall, enjoyable, but I think that the black cherry flavor is more enjoyable personally. This one resembles apple juice/ cider too much for me to believe it is beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredibly delicious and would complement any apple pie as a desert treat."
""
""
""
"My first ever lambic. Such a treat!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Below average fruit beer. Seems more like a cider."
""

"O - This is a nice ""gateway"" lambic. There are better out there but this one is nice to share with a newbie."
"D:  4.5"
"Appearance is gold with a nice foam. Hay this is a Lambic. So rate this as if it was not a traditional beer. Smell is of green apples, nice. The mouthfeel is very strong with bubbles and sits nice on the tongue, lays there slightly. The tastes is of a good green apple, a good old granny smith. Overall this is a Lambic and is nice. May we suggest you mix this half and half with some carmamel porter. Ahhhh, and that is from the Dutchman Hans. Enjoy this lambic."
"Have you ever had a green apple blow pop? If so, then you know what this smells and tastes like. Add in a fizzy translucent golden appearance, and a spritzy feel, and there you have Lindemans Pomme. It is better than, say, cider, but worse than the other sweet Lindemans fruit Lambics."
"O - Not a big fan of the apple. Finding I like framboise much better. If you really like apple flavor this is worth trying. Otherwise I'd pass."
"Poured a 2"" white head which dissipated quickly. Clear apple juice gold color. Smells mildy of sour apple. Taste is a fairly clean and tart green apple and truly it's like you just bit into a fresh one. It's not nearly as sweet as I anticipated and for that reason it stands completely opposite the last apple beer I tried which was more like apple pie. The sour of the lambic style comes through nicely in the end. A classy and refreshing fruit beer."
"O - I wanted to hate this, but it wasn't too bad, really. Obviously sweet, and a far cry from ""real"" Lambic, but pretty tasty for what it is."
"Pours a mostly clear light yellow color, with a white head, lots of effervescent bubbles stream non stop from the bottom to the top, a champagne type of look. Smell is mostly of granny smith apples not much else. Feel is light, high carbonation, a little tartness from the apples is present. The taste is kind of what I expected, its got a load of nice granny smith apple sourness which I like, followed by loads of sweetness, this is far closer to an apple cider than a beer. Overall an okay beer, not something I would normally get, perhaps a good dessert beer. None of these fruit Lindemans are my type of drink and if I had to choose one I prefer the frambrosie or the kriek over this."
"O - This was very enjoyable. I expected it to be too sweet, but it wasn't at all. Outside of the semi-artificial apple scent, this met my expecations going in."
"O: tastes great on a hot day but too sweeet to drink more than one."
"Overall Impression- Had very high expectations for this beer because of seeing the Beer List @ 33 Wine Bar (Limited amounts of Cantillon, Lindemans, 3 Fonteinen, etc.). Beer was WAY too sweet for a lambic but didn't mind it. A very 1 sided beer with no real complexity and this concludes that this should be a ""Fruit Beer"" and not a ""Lambic w/ Added Fruit"". I'm on to the next Lindemans now!"
"O-Overall this beer isn't too bad. I like to drink this kind of beer, specifically this brand, every once in a while to spice things up. It's not my favorite style, but it's good to have every once in a while."
"PROST!"
"This beer was shared and reviewed with the girlfriend. This beer pours a bright gold, lightly hazy, and moderately light in body. My girlfriend says it has a fingernail's worth of head haha. It smells like a slightly sweeter version of the green apple Jolly Ranchers. It tastes like overly sweet apple juice with a sour tinge. It's also along the same lines as the Jolly Ranchers. It's a little too sweet. My girlfriend says it's not even close to the Peche. It drinks light but a little sticky, from far too much sugar. The flavor doesn't really linger too long. Overall it isn't Lindemans best effort but it's drinkable. It's a little sweet but it's ok."
"Overall this tastes like a green apple cider plus a cup of sugar. Definitely one of the poorer offerings from Lindemans and no where as good as the Peche or Framboise."
"D: I'd drink again, but not a second glass or buy frequently at all. A dessert beer definitely!"
"This lambic pours as a golden color with a decent looking white head on it. There just a bit of haze in there once it's all in the glass. The smell of fermented apples are there along with a little bit of funk and some sweetness. The taste of the beer is decent in my opinion. I think that it's a pretty reasonable mix between sweet and sour. The mouthfeel is pretty light and can be drank pretty quickly. In my opinion this beer doesn't compete with Floris Apple from Belgium."
"O: Very tasty. Although it gets a little sickly. 3.5"
".... maybe not something to compete the truly serious brews, but certainly a great party beer ...."
"It seems like the quality of a Lindemans lambic is in how much the real complexity and character come out underneath the fruit and how well it's balanced. This is a good beer, but less than Framboise, with my favorite thus far being Peche, the very first one I ever tried."
"Poured the color of cider (turbid). 3/4 inch head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of cider and candy apple flavoring. Taste was rather unlike any other beer. The taste reminds me of apple champagne, if they made apple champagne from artificial apple flavoring. The most notable aspect was the slightly sour/bitter taste that was somewhat tricky to detect. I would have almost missed it if I hadn't been analyzing the flavors. The small alcohol presence came through and tasted like an American Adjunct-type flavor. The aftertaste starts out purely sweet apple candy flavoring. The finish is reminiscent of apple wine or champagne."
"Notes: I like this beer as a novelty beer. It is interesting but only in small amounts or as a dessert beer."
"If I'm gonna drink a fruity beer, give me a Samuel Smith's Cherry Ale..."
"Drinkabilty - Very easy to drink but all the sugar and sweetness would be too much after a bottle or so. Not very much booze so yea you can drink alot but i wouldnt do so. A nice change up or to have on hand for a female that doesnt like beer."
"Pours like apple juice but with a beer head. Smells like apple juice more then a cider though. Taste is strongly of apples with a finish of wheats and spices. It is a pleasant taste though not strong. It is very smooth and very easy to drink. If the cost were not so high it would be too easy to drink."
"Drinkability - Tastes great. Not a session beer, but makes a great gateway beer for newbies getting into new styles."
"On most days I would not give two Schlitz for Lindeman's Pomme; but when I'm in the mood, yeah, sure."
"Though this was so incredibly undrinkable after the first 5 ounces or so, it almost became a chore to finish the 12 oz bottle."
"D- designed to be consumed en masse, despite mixed feelings about this stuff it goes down easy."
"This beer poured nicely and looked promising with gold color and a nice head. It had a strong green apple aroma but was too candy sweet for my tastes. It was more like a champagne or cider than beer. I'm not a huge Lambic fan but I was hoping it would pair well with Pad Thai. I couldn't finish it. If your are a Lambic fan, it might be for you."
" ~ This is a light and fruity tart brew. It has great character and based on the brewing method it is an extremely intriguing brew. I will have this again."
"Had this before, but decided to re-taste it to see how my opinions of it have changed, if at all. It pours a clear apple juice (almost apropos, right?) topped by a nice finger of white foam. The nose comprises green apples and white grapes. Everything's very sweet-smelling, let me tell you. The taste continues this sweet tradition, with a combination of green apples and white grape-peach juice. Tasty, despite the sweetness. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a moderate carbonation and a mildly sticky finish. Overall, a nice little treat, a bit sweet for a proper lambic, but I still generally enjoyed it."
"The overtly sweet tastes make this a little less drinkable for me."
"Easy to drink - good enough beer, delivers what you'd expect."
"D - Like I am with apple juice and cider, this beer is incredibly quaffable. The alcohol is low, but it's borderline too sweet from the fruit syrup."
"Otherwise, it's a pretty average lambic that drinks easily, looks fine and tickles the tongue just enough. I am not sure how much of this I can stand, but a single glass goes down nice and fast."
"Pours a clouded golden yellow with a slight greenish tint. Frothy whitish head with awesome retention and lacing. Aroma is fruity and tart, green apples (Granny Smith-like) with only a trace of the impending doom of sweetness that follows in the flavor. Flavor starts off pleasantly tart and sour, like biting into a crisp, fresh Granny Smith, before an unrelenting syrup sweet green Jolly Rancher flavor takes over and refuses to clear the palate long into the finish. Better than I expected, but still disappointing and missing the mark from a true lambic. Was a nice way to try this in their holiday gift pack, but I wouldn't purchase this separately."
"Drinkability: this beer is very refreshing and easy to consume. Not a beer to have frequently, but a few times a year is just about right for me."
"Probably not for the hardcore BA who only wants the top of the heap for each style, but I have a soft spot for Lindemans and more importantly it's one of the few beers the Boss likes so I can purchase them whenever."
"D: Medium. Only thing working against this is the strong tartness."
"Had as Pomme Lambic. Aroma is strong, rich and fruity, rather sweet, more like a cider than a beer. It pours a clear, bubbly straw yellow with a thick white head. Flavor is quite lip-smacking, fruity and sweet like a cider but having subtle hints of hops and malt. Sure could mistake this for a cider, though - but it's still a satisfying beverage, and that's what matters. Texture is smooth, lively and fizzy, leaving behind a nice sour apple finish."
"Drinks easily and is a good fruit lambic. Refreshing as well. Not the best for the style, but a decent choice."
"Very drinkable, verges on cloying, though. A little more complex and apparent funk notes that the Framboise I recently had."
"O: Like most Lindemans offerings it is easy to go down. This one is quite the thirst quencher."
"looks a straw-yellow color, smells like green jolly-ranchers. it also tastes like green jolly ranchers. it had an impressive head around it with a lot of lacing. it's taste is super sweet, a little sour. real nice, tastes like apple juice for sure. pretty drinkable, but very sweet. definitly on the sweet end of lambics"
"D- Easy to drink and very enjoyable. Like drink a good granny smith apple."
"D: An after dinner beer, one glass should suffice."
"- Too candied and sweet... nice apple touch, but rather tart which is good... but the sweet backing kind of kills it... though it is a Lambic, and that is the style. Drinks very well."
"The beer itself is drinkable, but at $6 a pop, I don't think I'll be trying this again. It's too sweet and predictable for my tastes. It's not awful, but there's so many other sours/lambics that are much more interesting."
"Apple character is dialed up really high here--not bad at all, but this is certainly at the far end of the sweet Lambics. If you want more of the Lambic flavor to come through, let it breathe and warm up a little rather than drink it at the cold temperature (38-41° F) that is advised. Pair this with a walnut-and-grape chicken salad sandwich."
"Good mouth feel and carbonation. Very refreshing - just a bit one dimensional."
"Pours a apple juice colored yellow with a white head and mountains of carbonation, good lacing. Smells of apples and light grain and malt. Tastes of granny smith apples with malt to lessen the sour. Mouthfeel is very nice and drinkability is high."
"DB- The Lindemans fruit formula. It is almost like candy-soda-beer. I enjoy the flavor but can see where others would not like this."
"Highly drinkable, this is one of the wife's favorites!"
"definatly a beer worth a try thats widely available. age has done this beer justice, mellowed it out some, and brought just a touch more funk out, but i wouldnt paticularly go out of my way to age it again."
"a little too sweet to have more than 1 of these. not the best lambic i've had, but decent."
"Really a decent Fruit Lambic. Pretty simple, but enjoyable. Again, this is not something I will get all the time, but it is a good refreshing summer brunch or hot afternoon beer on an occasion."
"D: For me, I'd only have one of these. I probably wouldn't go out and buy these in any quantity unless for a special occasion."
"(D)- A tasty brew that could easily substitute champagne for any occasion. Fruity for sure with a tart crispness. However, it being a fruit lambic, it just tastes like an alcoholic apple juice. A gallon of this would be easy to consume though; goes down extremely easy."
"Very easy to drink. Flavors are not to my preference but not offensive. Could be enjoyable under the right circumstances."
"This one is a little bit too sweet for me, and the 375ml bottle was more than I wanted to finish on my own."
"I wouldn't pair this with to much, it really is desert on its own. However, creamy cheeses would work very well with this. Be sure to serve it cold between two and three degrees Celsius. And Enjoy!"
"The mouthfeel is super sticky and very bubbly; the beer is a sipper, unless you have a sweet tooth."
"Drank this in a pint glass. Color is rusty/hazy with sediments spinning about. There is a decent head that leaves a ring down the glass."
"Not a fan of the overpowering sourness, but seems to be an all around quality beer for its style."
"There isn't much complexity to the Pomme version, but the apple flavor is really superb. A great after dinner sipper. Hell, I could drink this for breakfast!"
"Overall, a pretty one note lambic.Big apple sweetness, but not much else. It was enjoyable, but it tastes a bit much like a Jolly Rancher for my taste. A good introduction to the style at least."
"D-I like the lambic style, and this is good. Wish it weren't so expensive."
"Serving type: TAP"
"Poured into the Lindemans flute. Slight chill haze and pale golden in color. Very minimal head that does not hang around for long. A little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is sour apples with just a hint of funky barnyard. Musty and appetizing all at once. The flavor starts with a dose of green apple that does not totally go away but gets complimented by some mild funkiness. Not as lip puckering as many other lambics but it still has a noticeable tartness. Light body with lively carbonation that seems to go well with this beer. Refreshing and easy to drink for a lambic. Worth a try if you like sour apple."
"Final Notes: A must-try for green apple fans. Makes either a great dessert beer or breakfast beer. Liked this one a little better than the Framboise."
"D - Very good but very apple cider/apple soda like. Easy drinking and quite tasty."
"D - Well, great if you like apple juice, it's not really my thing."
"Drinkability: Another exceptional fruit lambic by Lindemans. Definitely worth a try."
"d: I'm sure this is as they intended, its just lacking in tartness and is too sickly sweet for my taste."
"Big active white head on top of a bubbly, hazy, light gold brew. Fair ammount of lacing. The scent is pretty sour, apples and barnyard. Very sour taste, makes ya pucker up. Apple juice is the main course, pretty sweet. Very active mouth, pretty thin and wet. Me likey"
"The only difference between the nose and the palate is its a little sweeter on the tongue. This is one of those beers that are great on a very hot day but having more than one or two and it becomes a little to sweet for my liking."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow with a white head. The aroma is strong apple with some light tartness. The flavor is a mix of apples, both sweet and tart. The beer tastes a lot like apple cider. Medium high carbonation and medium mouthfeel. This has nothing in common with other Belgian lambics but as far as fruit beers go, this is a good one."
"An enjoyable fruit-laden lambic, one that relies on the inherent tartness of the apple, with little in the way of extra sugar, rendering a decent balance between the tart and the sweet. Along with the cassis and the raspberry versions, there seems to be a divide developing in this line of entry-level fruit lambics, i.e. sweet, vs. not so sweet."
"D: Very easy to drink. I could easily have lots of these in a sitting but it's a good beer to start out before moving on to other styles."
"Drinkability: It's good, and I'll drink it again, but I don't think I can drink more than one per night."
"The aroma from this hits you immediately. Pour this into a snifter and it just blasts your olfactory senses. It's not just a sharp sour apple aroma, a little alcohol and wood bleed through. It has a fairly standard cider look to it with a bit of foam. High carbonation gives this a club soda feel. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a green apple peel tartness with a little lemon and oak underlining it all. Certainly not a preference of mine, but for a lambic it is very pleasant."
"Gezondheid!"
"Pours a hazy, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong apples, tart malt, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Lambic - Fruit. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. There is a strong tartness present, as well. Tastes of apple, yeast, tart malt, and slight sweet malt. Overall, an average lambic."
"Really great, but something this dry needs food or a meal soon after."
"My first Lambic. Very good, but not very beer-like at all. Basically it looks like apple juice. It smells like sour apple. You pretty much get what's advertised here. Taste like apples, of course. It is slightly sour, but nothing unbearable. The drinkability is very high on this. I look forward to trying more Lambics after having this."
"Drinkability: A very good lambic- probably my favorite one yet. Very fruity, but that's expected."
"D- I would have no problem drinking all of this by myself. The big candy flavor profile this one brings off though leaves me to only drink up to 12oz at a time before moving onto something else. Good beer for the girls or people who say they don't like beer."
"Really enjoyed this. Couldn't do anymore than 1 at a time though."
"Unfortunately this beer was to sweet for me and with kind of aggressive carboration. Very enjoyable on a hot summer day in between two lagers, but no more."
"D - This is one of the few fruit lambics that I can drink the whole pour of granted I only get the stuff when its on special at the bar but its worth a try sometime"
"Somehow I think I'm being a little too generous here. Anybody else remember the horror that was Apple Bach from Cherryland? Anyway, poured with a smallish off white head that soon subsided and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is solid tart apples. Flavor is solid sweet tart apples. Body is ok and carbonation is fizzy. Finish is like flavor. Doubt that I'll ever have another."
"Overall, this isn't great."
"The feel is a bit powdery and crisp, but the sweetness adds a very full body. This beer was too sweet for me. I am the same with sweet and dessert wines. They are just too much for me. Still the flavor is good, and I like the hints of sourness present in it."
"Overall, a nice fruit beer, whose simple flavour and quenching body make it an easy drinker. I'd take the framboise any day, but this is pleasant enough."
"D- Highly drinkable and with nothing to convience you otherwise... maybe if you dont like apples."
"D: this makes a good dessert beer, but not much else as its sweetness can get to be cloying after a few sips. Like I said, it has a pleasant taste, but it tastes nothing like a beer."
"This came in a gift pack with a bottle of the framboise and a Lindemans fluted glass. The glass is very nice and the lambic was above average also. It pours a hazy pale yellow with a frothy layer on top. I love the smell. It is like pure fresh apple juice. The taste is sweet and sour. It starts as sweet apple then the sour lambic follows and the sweetness comes back at the finish. It feels dry but no carbonation. This the other lambics it seems to be a great drink for toasting. I probably would not want more than 2 in a sitting."
"D- if you like green apple jolly ranchers, this is for you. if you dont, then you should probably avoid. one bottle was plenty for me."
"Overall a plesant drinker. One glass is about all I can handle though. Great dessert beer."
"I've had all of the Lindemans fruit lambics (thanks to my wife who is obsessed with them) as well as their other offerings and this is the first one I've taken the time to give a grade. I'm very torn as to what way to go. Lindemans obviously takes a different approach to their lambics than other Belgian brewers. They are making an approachable sweet fruit beer than is very non-offensive and gives any alcopop a run for it's money. i don't know whether to grade it on what I think a lambic should taste like or what Lindemans were trying to achieve with this beer. Tastewise it is very similar to NG apple ale but sweeter. I'm going to grade this on what I believe the brewery was trying to achieve with this beer. On that note it is a decent beer although I have a very had time drinking a full glass of these kind of beers."
"CHEERS!!"
"D: In my opinion, one of the better Lindemann's as the flavor at least varies a little here and has a bit of character with the building sourness and trace of cloves and Belgian yeast flavor. I'd have this again given the opportunity but wouldn't be too excited to seek it out. On the other hand, quite a sessionable beer."
"D: Goes down very easy....however it is very sweet and sour so that may limit the amount of drinkability."
"If you're in the mood for something sweet, this was a nice little dessert number."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a rather small pure white head that settled into a ring. Very nice granny smith apple aroma, quite sweet which reminds me of the green apple jolly rancher. The taste is of sweetened apple juice, more red delious than granny smith. Some nice apple skin tartness. Definitely very sweet, not much tart or sour. Very nice apple flavor. A nice light feel with tingly carbonation, again sweet on the palate with a touch of tartness. A very sweet lambic with very little balance but great apple flavor. A very nice dessert beer but like most Lindemans, I would really only want one in a sitting."
"Drinkability: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts here. Perhaps it is the tartness or just the refreshing nature of the style, but I find this beer eminently drinkable."
"M&D - lively on the tongue with a dry champagne like finish, medium bodied levels of sweet fruitiness and tartness fom the apples and yeast, a nice lambic"
"This is worth re-buying especially for non-beer drinkers or wine drinkers."
"Good drinkability but it tastes a bit too much like apple juice for me. Cider would be a cheaper alternative."
"Body is light, but effervescent, and pleasant on the tongue. The drinkability is very good, not as sweet as some of the other varieties offered by this brewery. Overall, a refreshing change of pace if you're in the mood for something different, or want a mild sipper with a meal."
"drinkability is decent. for BAs who love sugary liquids, solace can be found here, but the fruit and sweet notes seem to overpower any chance of other notes to balance them out."
"Beautiful light golden color, slightly hazy, with large rocky head with good lace all the way down. Nose is straightforward apples, apple cider-y, and a sharp miscellaneous citrus zing in there too. Palate offers a great sweet 'n sour flavor with apple as the focus, and the yeasty bready flavors are there to complement nicely. Finish is long and sweet, and is very appetizing."
"D: The sweetness of this was almost too much for me. Tastes mostly like thick sparkling apple juice with a tart kick. A little more subtlety would have made me happier."
"It works for what it is, I'm not the biggest fan of fruit lambics, but there is no fault that I can find with it either. If you have a hankering for apple then this lambic won't let you down."
"Holy apples batman. Purchased a bottle of this at a local beer store, probably my favorite lambic from Lindemanns. Its a good drink. Yellow and cloudy in color. Carbonation formed a complete and tall head, three fingers, fell off by head remained steady. Nice carbonation, filled the area with an huge smell of sour apple. Its an apple beer and it does not fail to deliver apples. Goes down easy, a very good beer IMO. I need to research lambics more to see if its a good example of a lambic. I've heard people complain that Lindemanns does not make ""true"" lambics. Not sure about this."
"All in all, a delightful beer."
"This would go well with a Thanksgiving dinner or chicken salad."
"Had this over dinner w/ my non-beer drinking wife b/c she tried the Framboise earlier and now all of a sudden likes lambics. Poured a clear gold, almost yellow even, body w/ a well-carbonated two-finger head that quickly died and left little lacing. A tart apple smell, almost like apple juice and little else. Goes down watery and slick but not in a bad way. A quite tasty and easy going ""fruit"" beer and I enjoyed the glass I had. Taste is more sweet than tart, as I didn't find myself puckering at all like some tart lambics I've had. More than a glass or two of this, though, and I'll probably be feeling a little ill."
"Poured into my unibroue tulip glass on Easter Sunday to enjoy with dinner. It pours a very cloudy tan/yellow color with little head. There is a huge smell of granny smith apples on the nose. Very tart. The taste is good, it tastes like crisp apples. It reminded my a lot of a hard cider. I probably couldn't pick out the difference. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth. It wasn't bad, but I would prefer most of the other flavors over this, especially framboise."
"**Thank you to Nick and Candace for the complete review**"
"Great for what it is. Overall just not my thing."
"Feel and Drinkability: This beer is definitely heavier on the palate than the Floris, it also has a drier finish which compliments the forwardness of this beer's more forground lambic flavor. Carbonation feels spritzy. This beer is easy to drink, though I think that if I'm in the mood for something like this I'll srping for the Floris instead."
"Very drinkable indeed. Good summmer and fall drink."
"D: The brewers at Lindemans are geniuses when it comes to Lambics! I've not had a Lambic yet that even comes close! I will always be a fan of this brewery! I could drink this stuff all day long!"
"NOTE: ABV is 4%, according to the label."
"D: Lindemans knows what they are doing in the lambic category. I enjoyed the very sweet and mature mix of flavors."
"Notes: This beer really delivers on what it promises, an apple based Lambic and so I will give it a high rating for accurately portraying those tastes."
"Taste is also good if unsurprisng..could it be Apples? the interesting thing here is that I can taste a variety of apples as the drink progresses across the palate, and it isn't as sugary as I was expecting from Lindemans..much closer to the Kriek than the Framboise in sugar content. If both of those sound crazy sweet to you, stay away. Otherwise, mouthfeel is close to a sparkling wine and drinkability is mixed but good: Very easy to drink but so rich as that you probably won't want another."
"Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. The sweetness hinders the drinkability somewhat, but I could still drink this for a while."
"wouldnt be bad with desert , but hard to drink more than one"
"3.9/5"
"Taste: Tart green apples. Not as big of an apple flavor as I expected."
"M & D: Kind of syrupy, yet a good sipper. The sweetness gets kind of grating though. Very much like some good cider."
"All and all, highly drinkable and a good thirst quencher (though the artificial sweetener leaves a quite unpleasent dry feeling in your mouth)."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth"
"D: Too strangely artificially flavored for me. Although i am sure they use real ingredients; they wind up with green jolly ranchers."
"D = I could drink this stuff at the drop of a hat, very good."
"I did a lot of complaining in this review but overall it is an interesting beer but it's just not what I expected. I'm glad I tried it but I don't think I'd try it again."
"I've found another Lindeman's offering I'd rather have then the widely available framboise (raspberry). Give this to a non-beer drinker and see how they'll react. Delicious!"
"I mentioned in another review that I was a bit disappointed by the ABV % in the Lindemans. I have found a nice trick to raise this in the Pomme. Get some apple schnopps that's about 20 proof and poor a shot in the glass then pour your Pomme. It makes the beer a tad sweeter but doesn't over do it. It's adds more alcohol as well as a bit more taste :-)"
"D- I like it. I liked the cherry more as this one seems to be more imbalanced, but I still wouldn't mind having another."
"Drinkability: Bit too fruity for me. Still good though. Not your typical beer either. Maybe an after dinner beverage?"
"D- Reminds me more of apple juice/cider than beer no thanks for me."
"Tastes and smells like sour green apple candy. Not much more to say about it.. it is a sour tarty/fruity beer that is good for a change of pace or to suggest to those who do not like your typical malty hoppy beers. Drinkable in the sense it is not too strong, but too much of that fruity taste gets old kind of fast."
"D- Drinks good, but too much sugar to pound back"
"It smelled and tasted just like a sour apple airhead... the chewy, sugary candy. Wow, this beer had so much flavor. It was a mix between apple juice, apple cider, and some sparkling sweet flavors. I couldn't find the beer in this Lambic either. I could of had a couple bottles, the sweetness would have been something to deal with, but it was too good. I recommend to all, but wheres the 'beer'?"
"Pours a cloudy yellow-ish color with a white head. Aromas of green apple and cinnamon. In the taste, again green apple and cinnamon. A bitter, sweet and sour apple mouthfeel, with a dry green apple and spice aftertaste. Taste almost like apple cider, dryer than most Lindeman's, and not as sugary."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and actually one of my favorite in the Lindeman's fruit beer collection. It actually leaves a bit of the funk in rather than drowning it in syrup. This particular bottle must have a bit of age on it, but it doesn't taste bad at all. I would certainly drink this beer again, and recommend it...though the score from this review won't be the best because of this particular bottle."
"Taste is sweet with a distinct apple juice taste. Body is sweet and sticky. This beer has been sweetened. There is absolutely no malt or hops to be tasted here. Even the expected tartness is not present. I understand that this is really great for people that don't like beer, but not for me. I will be mild in my judgement."
"A great drink for an apple lover like myself."
"The bottle says serving temp between 38 and 41 degrees and I agree. The colder temp brings out the best in this beer. And, as I mentioned before, if you love the green Jolly Ranchers, you will indeed love this beer!"
"D: Perhaps a bit too sweet and not tart enough to really be a lambic. But for what it is, pretty tasty on a hot day."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D- pretty good, little too sweet for alot of it"
"Great for desert, but let's not forget breakfast. Leave the mimosa for someone else, this would pair well with an omelet, or French toast. Have at it!!"
" Very low alcohol makes this easy to drink and it makes a fine desert-style beer."
"D: A very drinkable beer overall. A great mix of sweet and sour tastes. Nice, smooth mouthfeel makes it an excellent session beer or a nice beer to drink all night. Drinking this beer is like eating green Jolly Ranchers with a kick."
"Drinkability: Apple cider plus a cup of sugar. Some would say you have a recipe for disaster, but you really just have a recipe for Lindeman's Pomme."
"D: A little dryer than the other Lindeman's lambics. Pretty drinkable though, I'd like to pour back a few of these every Sunday morning. Solid beer, very solid."
"D- As stated above, this is definitley an aquired taste beer, especially for those not accustomed to the lambic style. The sourness is such that I cannot sip this one and keep a straight face, making this a slow sipper by necessity despite the relatively tame ABV."
"Not as good as the framboise but that is my personal taste. Appearance was very light with a light head that stayed the entire time. Smell was very upfront almost like apple pucker or a hard cider. Very heavy on the sour apple. It was good but was to sweet and to sour at the same time. Couldn't even think what to pair it with. Good but not good enough. D- was not as good due to the taste and sweetness."
"Picked this bottle up in a Lindeman's gift set. I was a little leary to try this one as I had hear it tasted like an apple Jolly Racher. The beer poured a slightly cloudy golden yellow color with a slight off white head. The beer had a candy apple nose and a touch of earthiness to it as well. The was actually like an apple Jolly Rancher, very syrupy tasting that leaves a sugary taste on the tongue that is not overly pleasing. Worth a try but I don't think I would go back."
"Makes for a pretty good dessert beer."
"Pours a cloudy gold with some white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Nose is, surprise, surprise - apple. To me it already reminds me of an apple Jolly Rancher. I give it a 3 because it reminds me too much of the candy and lacks maturity. Taste is nasty. Tastes like sour apple. Like that candy was melted and morphed into a drink. It gets more tolerable as times goes on, as is typical with Lindemans brew. But really. Eck. You might as well put this in a bottle and let your kid drink it as apple juice, if it weren't for the alcohol in it. No way am I going to be able to finish this bottle...or an inch more of what is in the glass. Horrid. The only thing I can think that would save this is a proper pairing with food."
"Drinkability: Good for a few sips and then just becomes too cloying"
"This is my third fav from lindemans. almost tastes like a hard apple ale. pours light yellow green. smells like apples that have been like mustified or something. not tart but more smooth and has a bit of a creamy funk to it. Its real good but it has a lot of pearish flavor to it as well. It has a great mouthfeel and is very drinkable. Not quite cider. not quite ale. in reality not quite lambic. this is not sour at all so those of you looking for a traditional lambic stay away. good brew though IMO."
"Like the other Lindemans offerings, this one is plenty tasty, but off the charts in terms of its sweet cloying feel. We had a small bottle and I know I couldn't have finished the sucker. The flavor itself was nice, a similar, but more sophisticated flavor than a green apple Jolly Rancher - very candy-like. Not a bad beer and I'd recommend it to anyone that like sour apple."
"Definitely worth trying. Can't wait to venture into other Lambics!"
"Pours a dark amber/blonde color with minimal head. Strong hints of apple in the nose with some sourness detected as well. Taste is tart and similar to apple cider. There's some sourness at the back of the throat but it's more like a mild pucker. It's damn irrestible and very easy to drink. You might not notice that it's a lambic at first. Excellent all-around."
"Don't drink and review."
"The beer from the 350ml caged and corked bottle pours a hazy deep gold color with a modest creamy white head, that fades away leaving the lace to seal the glass with a fine sheet. Nose has a terrific Granny Smith Apple sweet and sour aroma with a wet gunny sack musty tone, astringent, but likeable nonetheless. Start continues the sweet and sour astringency with the top light in its feel. Finish has a barbarous acidity, followed by the green apple sweet and sourness, face-puckering dryness, but it has everything I look for in a good Lambic."
"It goes down very easily, and it's very drinkable, although you will get a little syrupy after a while."
"This was my first attempt at this style as far as evaluating. Previous fruit flavored beers have left a mark on me as too sweet or tart and I am pleasantly surprised with this offering. I will have to keep Lambics in mind for the future. I would also recommend serving this warmer than the 38º to 41º referenced on the label unless you are drinking in the heat of the summer."
"The taste tastes of fresh green apples with a slight sweetness and some wheat and yeasty flavour as well. It has a medium body and light carbonation and tastes ever so good. I love green apples. ;^) Man, that fruity flavour lingers on in the aftertaste and I can't help taking another sip or 2 to satisfy my taste buds. Good Fruit beer!"
"D- This is a nice flavor, but not very beery. I'm a little disapointed, but it's quite drinkable."
"I like this beer,its my 2nd offering from Lindemans and my favorite so far.I will have this again the future.Good beer."
" Palate is more sweet green apples, a touch of sweet pale malt, and just a little bit of lambic astringency. A lingering sugary sweetness becomes kind of cloying on the finish, limiting the drinkability. Overall, though, an enjoyable dessert beer."
"had at BJ's, damn that waitress was cute!"""
"Yellow-gold cloudy concoction with a minor bubbly head and very little lacing. The smell is of sour, crisp apples and some earthy/compost-like stuff. The taste comes off as a fizzy tart apple and yeast blend, like granny apple soda or champagne. Kind of a refreshing experience for a few sips if you think more soda than beer, and it seems drinkable enough, like any soda could be, but it is too sweet for me to want more than a taste of this stuff I think. I recommend you ask for a sample size of this before you commit to a full portion. It was alright for a try though."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a cloudy beige color lambic with an average bubbly head with good retention. Aroma of semi-sweet apple is dominating with some light tart and oak notes. Taste is also dominated by some apple notes (probably apple concentrate) and some light tart and oak notes. Full body with some average carbonation. I would have like more sourness and oak which would have brought more complexity and would have been a perfect match for the apple."
"D - This is probably my least favorite offering from Lindeman's, but it ain't bad. It's much more beer like than a cider, and the tart green apple flavors are quite refreshing."
"Decent drinking, but can be a bit cloying especially as it warms. Very nice in the summer when chilled."
"Pours a cloudy yellow/amber, thin white head, leaves some decent lacing, thin ring sticks around, otherwise kind of unappealing, kind of dull. Smell is very sweet, sugary, apples, sourness, strawberry and a touch of vanilla, but overwhelmingly sweet. Taste is insanely sweet as well, tastes like a sour apple jolly rancher, very sugary. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, almost cloying. Much too sugary for me, weird synthetic apple aroma/flavour."
"Very drinkable, but its just not beer to me."
"Recommended"
"Hazy gold, topped with a big, puffy white head. I was half expecting this to pour bright yellow-green, to match the unnatural color of some of their other varieties. Hold a decent couple millimeters of head throughout. Heavy, syrupy green apple scent. Very much like sour apple hard candy. Not entirely what I like in a beer, of any variety. The flavor is somewhat more beer-like, with light wheaty grain barely surfacing under the omnipresent green apple Jolly Rancher syrup. Nicely effervescent though, with a soft, fuller texture. Not a whole lot going on aside from the apple. With the malt, it comes across as one of those $1 apple pies you find in the gas station. The definition of the word cloying. Some faint lambic sourness, but not much to make note of. Really, half a bottle was more than enough for me, and it took me a while to get through just that. More like a sickly sweet apple soda than a beer. The bottle was a gift, so I can't complain too much."
"Pours a light, hazy yellow with almost no head. Smells of sour apples with an astringent note to it. Tastes crisp, sweet up front and a sharp finish to it. The apples are dominant but not nearly so pronounced as in a cider. The trademark lambic sourness is definitnely present & adds a nice interest to the flavor. The mouthfeel is soft with low carbonation. Drinkability is great! Very refreshing and an alcohol content that could make this one a session beer. I like all of the Lindeman's line & this one is no exception. Yummy!"
"Drinkable if your into sweet beers. Luckily I love apples and apple flavoured things but there are better beers that use apples that actually also taste like beer."
"Special thanks to Amanda at Mr.Goodbar for the sample!"
"D- Nice little drink, but for the price and bottle size I could find something else to hit my lambic jones."
"My first review of this one felt unfaire and I had to revisit this one after consulting BA:s and SHBF:s style guidelines. Good drinkability, even though it's not as refreshing as a kriek, it goes down quite easily."
"Too sweet for my tastes, like the other Lindemans I've had, but good for what it is and great to bring people into the world of better beer - drastically different from any ""real"" beer."
"This a cloudy, straw-colored beer with little to no head. The aroma is sour, yeasty, and prettymuch smells like green apple jollyranchers. This is an intensely sweet beer with a cracker dry grain contribution that knocks out the bottom to make it drinkable. The luscious green apple flavor is tasty but obscures this beer's complexity. This is a great beer if you feel like drinkin candy."
"The taste was the same as the nose except at the finish, some good tart apple rhine gives a good semi-dry finish. The last lingering quality felt like you had a greenapple jollyrancher!"
"from Lindeman so far. Good stuff."
"About what I expected. The taste is certainly not bad, just not very interesting and too sweet (like most of their lineup). I could see it paired with a fresh fruit dish, salad, or a tart dessert."
"Lindemans Pomme threw me no curveballs. After drinking Cassis, Framboise, Kriek and Peche, I knew what to expect from the apple version. If you like incredibly sweet, moderately complex fruit beer, and don't mind laying out some cash on occasion, give this one a whirl."
"Poured into my stange glass. Nice head, and GREAT retention. Smells of green sour apples. Tastes nice but artificial. I would like to re review the previous lambics because I think they might have the same quality. Taste is good. I really think I might need to try some other lambics to understand the style. I like this beer, but from other people's reviews it seems like I really need to try other beers from the style to really understand it. Mouthfeel is good and clings well. The beer goes down fast cause it's liight and tastes like candy."
"This 750 ml; bottle set me back $9.45 at my local North Coast Coop in Eureka, CA. It poured a nice interesting peach color with a large and white foamy head. Lots of lacing made you realize this was not just apple cider. Nose is apple however, and not much else. Very sweet with moderate carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Quite drinkable but way overpriced for what you get."
"Poured into a flute glass. Appears a slightly cloudy, pale yellow amber with under an inch of white foam. Smells of freshly sliced, tart apples. Tastes of crisp, tart green apples, pleasantly sweet and sour flavors. Moderate carbonation. Very refreshing and clean. I tried half the bottle with ice, and the other half without. I prefer this beers with a little ice to cut down the sweetness a little. I would love to try this again with some nice, sharp cheese."
"Drinkability: A very tasty beer, clean, tart, apples, apples. It's difficult however for an untrained taster to separate this style from a sparkling apple cider. Definitely a different, smooth mouthfeel, but very similar in flavor upfront."
"Pours a apple cider yellow/pale amber. Mild carbonation and a small fizzy head that quickly leaves. The aromas are like the squelching juice from a Granny Smith or a Fuji apple dripping down your chin after a juicey bite. But no farmhouse, earthy aromas though. The flavor really captures the apple, Granny Smith particulary, tart and dry. Yet very juicey. Hints of teh Belgian countryside, but does lack a bit of the ""lambic"" style tartness that I was looking for. Just fruity and apple-y. Nice to sip while sittin up in bed after a draining evening before."
"Very disappointing. Perhaps mildly better than Lindemans Peche, but close enough to be tied for the worst beer of the Lindemans line-up of beers."
"Yet, I kind of like it. I had the kriek just a few weeks ago, and either I hated it because I really don't like cherries as much as I think, or because it just wasn't as appealing at the time, or whatever, I don't know. What I do know is, it was a long day, it gazed at me from the fridge shelf, and I was intrugued, and its turned out to be quite refreshing. Now, I doubt I""ll go for it again any time in the remote future, but hey, what the hell."
"Overall - A decent Lambic, but not my cup of tea. It's still worth a try if you haven't had it before. Cheers!"
"Overall, it is between cider and a mamosa - substitute apple juice for orange juice. Personally, my least favorite of the four main fruit lambics of this brewery - too cidery and sweet - Maybe cider drinkers (and Jolly Rancher enjoyers) would appreciate this more. It does pair well, though, with salad with apple slices in it."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable at 4.1%. A bit pricey for what you get, however."
"My Christmas Eve beer... Pours a hazy brown color, like an apple cider with a foamy head. Aroma is overwhelmingly one of apples. Taste is quite tart, a touch of the sour lambic, but for the most part a fruity apple flavor. Sweet aftertaste, but not too cloying. Very drinkable; not a beer I'd drink every week, but pretty tasty."
"This lambic pours a somewhat translucent golden amber with a nice frothy head with good retention, and thins to some lace. The smell is strong apple with a nice yeasty qualities. The taste is quite sweet, and reminds me of a snakebite with overly sweet cider. Different and rather pleasant, but with a bit of a sour aftertaste. It has low carbonation and is rather light. I'm not inclined to drink many of these, but I'd easily have another."
"This brew pours a deep straw color with a sponge-like foam over the top. This beer is slightly hazy, with moderate lacing and reminds me of apple cider. The aroma is unmistakably apple, it seems to leap from the glass to your nose. The flavor is not as sweet as some other beers from Lindemans but it is slightly tart and its faintly sour in the finish (it seems like a combination of apple cider and Jolly Ranchers). The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation giving it a champagne-like zing. Overall this beer is quite tasty and very easy to drink once you have one you will definitely be hooked."
"The beer poured a cloudy gold with an off white head. The aroma was green apple. The taste was really more of green apple cider or cocktail than even gueze, but it was wonderful stuff. The feel was wonderfully dry and crisp allowing you to really see the beer underneath this one. I like fruit lambic's, but this is the first pomme I've had and I found it to be delightful. Now this is heavily influenced by my love of green apples, but I have definately added a favorite I will be searching out and purchasing this beer. If it was up to me I'd have it for breakfast every day it was just a wonderful beverage."
"D- much too sweet for me, other lambics ive had are more sour, less carbonated, less sweet, thats how ive come to understand the style, even those arent super drinkable, this is ok at best, would not really recomend this one"
"Pours with a frothy head and an off-gold body that seems to have a tinge of green apple skin color to it. Aromas are of tart green apples; you can even smell a bit of the peel, it seems. On the tongue, softly tart apple flavors present first, before a cloying sweetness takes over. The whole thing is more Juicy Juice apple flavor rather than anything real. Quite acidic in mouthfeel, like a baby lambic, with medium carbonation and body. Overall, this is only OK; I can't imagine drinking this as anyting other than a dessert accompaniment. And even then, there are better choices out there."
"Taking one for the team after this one is kicked at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse, Ename tripel will be flowing on draft imagine how lucky we are to have a true tripel flowing after this candy inspired fruit ale. Appears a pale golden apple juice with a light white colore head leaves thin specks of lace with each sip. Arom has tart apple, granny smith if you will pretty sharp acidity quality in the smell. Taste howevery is overwhelmingly sweet with Jolly Rancher green apple abundancy with more sweet than tart literally sugary in flavor not so much ciderish but more or less arificially injected with concentrated sugars. Mouthfeel leaves a dry coating on the palate lighter body overarl with spritzy carbonation for this lighter bodied ale. Drinkability well no thanks especially after trying so many fine beers over the years at the Creekhouse."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Sep 22nd, 2006: The beer is a hazy golden color with a medium white head that dissipates fast. Slick lacing. The aroma is all Granny Smith apple, with a bit of yeast. Light and crisp body with a tart apple character. Sour apple dominates the flavor, with a mild sweetness showing up here and there. The finish is mild and fruity with touches of spice. Decent overall."
"interesting but not good"
"This brew pours a very cloudy, almost milky-white color, topped with a short and airy foam. The aroma is dominated by an intense green apple smell. Its almost reminiscent of home-made cider and apple skins. Theres just a bit of grain notable as well, and a bit of tartness. You cant discern if the tartness is from the beer or the apples. The flavor is bold and notably sweet. Theres a nice juxtaposition between the sweetness and tartness that works very well in this brew. The body is fairly light, and the finish is lingeringly sweet with a fleetingly sharp twang. All in all, this ones very good. I wished that Id had more when it was finished."
"Tasty and flavorful Lambic here. Sweet enough that your girlfriend would drink it but with enough subtle flavors to keep a beer geek interested."
"-Oelergud"
"This thing is tarty enough to be refreshing, but a bit too sweet. Very silky mouthfeel. I'm new to the world of lambics, but this seems to lack substance aside from the apple. Nonetheless, it's worth a try, though next time I'll probably go back to the gueuze or try something new."
"I think this beer would rock with creamy cheeses, like Brie, maybe some bleu cheeses or even some goat cheeses. Stone me. Im no lambic rookie, I love Drie Fonteinen and Cantillon but I can dig a Lindemans because I know what I am getting. This is not a bad beer. I was expecting something a little different but I didnt mind it. Hell, Id drink it again. I purchased my 750ml bottle in Omaha, NE. Try one, you never know"
"Dull gold/amber colour, pretty hazy, with a short cap of white foam off the pour. Larger bubbles settled into a ring, while fine bubbles remained on the surface. Some lacing. The green apple aroma is dominant, but there are notes of apple skins, tartness and a peculiar earthy sweetness as well. There's a solid tartness present, but it's overshadowed somewhat by sweetness. Apple flavour is present throughout and the finish is of intense sweet apples. Medium/light body with a bit of stickyness. The carbonation is adequate, but not as lively as I'd hoped. I liked this beer, it's tart and palate cleansing, but it didn't make a huge impression."
"Notes: I enjoyed this beer, but I didn't care much for the candy flavor. I was hoping more for a cider flavor. It's just too artificial. My least favorite of Lindeman's offerings."
"Aroma is huge with tart green apple...very now-n-later apple smelling. Body is a dull gold with a thin white head. Flavor is massive artifical candy green apple. It tastes good to me though and I would definitely have one again. Im a sucker for candy and this is just a candy beer with a bit of a base maltiness to prevent it from just being syrup."
"Light brown  frothy white head  jolly rancher sour apple, caramel, yeast, pepper nose- candy red apples, sour green apples, caramel (caramel covered apples)  medium body  sweet/sour aftertaste Light brown  frothy white head  jolly rancher sour apple, caramel, yeast, pepper nose- candy red apples, sour green apples, caramel (caramel covered apples)  medium body  sweet/sour aftertaste"
"D- This is a wonderful green apple cider that was delicious. Not sweet and not overly bity but just a nice crisp drink."
"Drinkability  I had no problem drinking this but its certainly not a Lambic and completely lacks the requisite malt base."
"This was an OK impulse purchase. Seemed thin, a little stringy, if that's the word. Tasted more like a cider than a beer. It did have a nice, fizzy mouthfeel from the carbonation, but, again, the flavor of apples predominated rather than appearing as an additive."
"Overall: Nothing repulsive. Absolutely no beer base, and it definitely is not a lambic, it is.well, erm.nothing more than expensive Apple Juice. A chick beer hands down. Nice enough, but I find it hard to acknowledge that I am even writing a ""beer"" review for this alcopop. Shockingly predictable, just as I imagined."
"As if this beer isn't good enough from the bottle. Even smoother, richer, and cleaner from the tap. Very cider-like with apples and berries under a very sugar sweet maltiness and added apples. Very tart and acidic, evident in aroma and flavor. Vigorously carbonated for a playfull effect in the mouth. Astringent feeling, but not overly so. Finishes with a big apple flavor, syrupy sweetness and carbonated dryness and tartness. Sweet almost to the point where it hurts the teeth. Though I love the beer, the sweetness and apples over-take what would be pronounced Belgian Beer flavor."
"This beer is very one-dimentional but it's simple and right-to-the-point. It could be a huge hit for the non-beeries. The sheer simplicity, along with the enjoyability, made it rank high for me. I would much rather have a complex, traditional lambic, but this one still makes for a great drink."
"D: This is pretty much apple jolly rancher juice. You like those candies you'll probably like this stuff. The wife loves this stuff."
"This lambic is just way too drinkable. It's incredibly refreshing and crisp."
"Notes: Certainly not one of my favorite styles as I tend to gravitate towards more traditional lambic styles and other spontaneous fermented products like Guezes, and Biere de Garde but, and a big BUT, this is a well brewed beer and I can appreciate the quality presented here."
"ok,i love apple anything, so im gonne like this no matter what. this pours out a nice sunset color. looks welcoming. smells like a big fat green apple. granny smith style. taste? oh man, your either gonna love it or hate it. i love it. its like a liquid green apple jolly rancher. sour and a bit puckering, apple all over. oh my. lively carbonation. its like a candy for the beer drinker. one is easily enough and it takes care of my sweet tooth perfectly. my new favorite offering from lindemans."
"This is absolutely wonderful!! This may, in fact, replace the framboise as my favourite offering from lindemans. Poured a cloudy golden orange with a thick soapy foamy head. Tons of carbonation bubbles both streaming upward and clinging to the sides of the glass. I'm typically not a big fan of carbonation of this level in my beer, but for this style, the more the better, I say. The smell is almost candy like. Sweet green apple is about all you're going to get from this one. The taste is quite sweet with tart green apple dominating. Nearly un-noticeable level of malt at the very end. You really have to be searching for it. Mouthfeel is very pleasant with a nice moderate carbonation sting to it. I almost wouldn't even consider this beer; mildly alcoholic apple soda is more like it. Nevertheless, I completely enjoyed it and will certainly buy this one again."
"12 oz bottle, 9 oz sample. This brew pours a deep straw color with a web-like foam over top. This one is modestly hazy, with no carbonation apparent. This one reminds me a lot of apple juice in the way it looks. The aroma from this one is definately unmistakable apple. It is somewhere between a nice apple cider and the apple jolly rancher candies; slightly real, but somewhat artifically sweet. At least you can't say it lives up the the promise of apple. The flavor is not as sweet as expected. It is definately focused on the sweetness of the apple, but as I swallow the beer, I get just a hint of funkyness and sour, more than I have in any other Lindeman's product. Aftertaste is slightly wheaty. Mouthfeel is on the light side of moderate, with a very light carbonation just working its way out of sulution as it hits my tongue. I enjoy the light zing of sour and tartness, if from either the apple or the beasties used for fermentation, as it lends distant thoughts of other lambics that I enjoy more. Overall, this one is tasty and very easy to drink. It is over done on the sweetness, but it also has very faint wispers of what it could be, so that makes me happy."
"This isn't a bad brew, but it was a let down for me as the apple flavoring tastes more like candy than a fruit. With that said, there are still so few apple brews that I have to recommend it. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, too!"
"Pours a hazy apricot body with a small offwhite head. Attractive lacing drapes the goblet in sheets. Aroma is greenapple bubblegum and apple cider. A hint of spices. Mouthfeel is light medium with soft carbonation. Taste is greenapple bubblegum and apple cider. A touch of wild yeast acidity. Slight mustiness, befitting a lambic. A hint of spiciness that seems to be cloves. A decent fruit lambic, but not my favorite even from this brewery."
"Great for the ladies but not for me. Nearly identical to a Demi Pomme made with Kronenbourg and Sour Apple Syrup."
"Pomme. It's a good thing. The best thing about this beer is the aroma. Like the other Lindemans offerings it's like smelling a big bowl of fresh (apples, raspberries, cherries, peaches). The aroma makes my mouth water. I definitely like the green apple characteristics of this beer. The sour flavor matches very nicely with the sourness of the Lambic base. For my money this is the least sugary sweet of the Lindeman's fruit beers. Worth seeking it out."
"I really like this one: Extremly refreshing, yet quite complex."
"THe only disappointment is the price...I paid almost $7 for a 12oz bottle. But if money is no object, or if you're a big fan of the style, definitely give it a try."
"Drinkability- Because of it's sugar content and extreme sweetness, I found this really hard to finish 12 oz or so. There is no way I would have been able to consume the whole bottle. No very highly drinkable, but could work as an afterdinner drink to share at a party with a dessert or something. About 6oz is enough for me."
"Very one dimensional with the thick flavors of sour green apple but you can't expect this to be a big, complex lambic. Very sweet, yet refreshing. The one problem is a lack of carbonation, and a little light on acidity. Those two components really hurt the mouthfeel. The sweetness makes this one difficult to drink many but a good refresher."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! I'm a huge green apple fan and this really hits the spot. It's intense and refreshing; very nice. The taste is good. It has a nice green apple flavor that is mildly tart and full of fruit flavor. It goes down like candy and really satisfies. This is one delicious beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is another great offering from this brewery. I'm not a fan of the less fruit, more sour lambics. This one is highly drinkable and very enjoyable."
"A real thirst quencher, reminiscent of a very good hard cider."
"D: This obviously isn't an everyday beer or one to drink in large quantities, but I find it to be very enjoyable and definitely one that could be enjoyed by those who are uninitiated to the world of fine beer."
"Drinkability: My first taste of this new offering and I am curious. I wanna try a bottle and see how the delicate flavors hold up in a bottle."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and nice. But I can't drink too much- the cloying sweetness overpowers me after a half-bottle."
"Yellowish color, a little dull in luster. Thin flat-lying head in a chalice. Laces are thin with scant minimal strings. Highly sweetened but distinct apple aromas, lives in a candy-ish sour ball realm. Light and carbonated mouthfeel. Certainly puts some apple into the Pomme appelation as far as the flavor profile, not as earthy as it should be, but definitely more defined than you find in something like Unibroue Ephemere. Nevertheless, it seems a little bit plastic and on the artificial side, at the same time that its ""busting out all over"". Interesting slide into a chalky almost oaky wrap-up. Can't say that its really a beer that meets a lot of things I look for in the many styles that are available in the world today."
"worth a try in the way that it is different from such fruit-overpowering products like the framboise and the peche, but still cannot hold a candle to the cuvee rene... or even the gueuze. $5 wasted and this beer sampled.. i don't feel like a total ass, but my money could have been spent more wisely."
"Small bottle, foil, cap and a small cork, no freshness/bottling indication. Pours cloudy light tangerinem with a near white fine, slight head and leaving slithery, stringy lacing, nose of sugary apples. this a quite sweet, sugary brew, undernotes of slight sourness. Dessert beer or perhaps with a salad. Sweetness takes away from complexity."
"This is an odd one. It tastes and smells artificial, like green apple candy. There's some lambic character beneath, but the apple flavor dominates. I can't imagine it's real, and that's hard to say as it comes from Lindemans. Hmmmm... I guess I'd have to say I'm disappointed. It's way too sweet and artificial tasting to me. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I wouldn't have more than one, and I don't think I'll ever bother with it again."
"This seemed like a good midday nice weather sipper so that's what I did. Pours a light golden with a modest fizzy head. Some lacing rings but not too much. Aroma is strong on the apples. There's a tart acidic element in there but its more sweet and sugary than anything else. I'm getting a small bit of brett or something similar in the backdrop. Taste is dominated by apples. A strong granny smith flavor ensues. There's not really a whole lot else going on. A definite sweetness arises but the tartness of the granny smith flavor with the sugar sweetness seem to work off each other quite well imo. I like the acidity and dryness in the finish. This is refreshing. Very cidery but that's probably expected. I might not be able to drink too many of these or really want another for awhile but I enjoyed this bottle."
"My second Lambic. Pours out to a mildly hazed golden yellow color with a small head of white foam. No lace. A medium high level of carbonation. Aromas of apples, sweet malt, sour fruits and some floral notes meet the nose well. Taste is near exceptional; full fruit flavors of apples, lots of sweet candied sugar, yet the sourness factor arises and changes the focus of the palate to the more subtle notes of mild malt and grass. Mouthfeel is smooth and zesty, very refreshing. Drinkability is good. This is a great alternative to many fruity wines and has really opened my mind to the Lambic style of beer. Recommended."
"Overall: Given that this is a Lindeman's fruit lambic I expected it to be on the sweet side, but this was too much. I definitely prefer Lindeman's other fruit lambics to this. It's like drinking a sour apple Jolly Rancher."
"Last night at the Long Island Beer festival I was hit in the mouth with something awesome, and I'm not talking about one of the 8,000 too many fat dudes with hair gel walking around. If there were a best in show award it would surely belong to Lindemans Pomme Lambic. Pomme Lambic pours out from its bottle like my Platonic ideal of Apple Cider, resting in my small plastic cup with little to no head, but a menacing apple-juice colored body. I asked the man serving me this exceptional delight what the ABV was and he responded ""8%"". Knowing this I smelled the lambic, expecting harsh alcohol fumes, but only receiving apple. First sip, sweet Jesus, I left my frail mortal coil down somewhere in Long Island and ascended into beer heaven, where I'm never drunk and always buzzed, and water fountains dispense Guinness. I am not a lambic conneisseur, and so it is difficult for me to describe this in terms of other lambics. What I can say is that it has a sharp apple-y and refreshing edge, with a super smooth and full body. The slick liquid coated my tongue, and as for aftertaste... there was none to speak of, just apples. Overall, imagine every crappy ""malt alcohol beverage"" you've ever had, take that, pretend it tasted delicious, and combine it with your favorite hard cider. If you find this lambic on sale, buy it, cherish it, never leave, marry it and don't cheat on it, you won't regret it."
