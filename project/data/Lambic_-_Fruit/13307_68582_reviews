"Poured into a tulip glass"
""
"Pours reddish-brown with a faintly red head, short and fizzy, falling without much lacing; hazy.  The nose is powerful and delicious, big, ripe raspberries, jammy with some tart notes in the background.  On the palate, the fruit is much drier and the sour and acid comes through nicely with a nice, yet subtle, dose of funk as well as some spicey, peppery notes.  Clean and refreshing.  A really tasty brew."

"Some of these Mikkeller sours are hit or miss but this is pretty freaking good for not being one of the double or triple fruited ones."

"Love the nose on this beer--fresh raspberry jam. Funky tart raspberry tastes. Highly recommend."

"2014 vintage. Smell of rasberry juice, wild yeasts and candi sugar. In mouth, it's very sour. Rasberry taste follows with a strong tartness. Bitterness is fruity and specially sour. Overall, it's a nice beer. Sour fans only. Very tasty and you know rasberries are real, not a weird syrup or jam."

"Good, but very barn yard funky upfront.  Lots of funk in the nose too.  Finished with a hint of sweet berrys."

"Dark and cloudy ruby red pour with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Strong sour smell of raspberries and the taste follows with a really nice sour flavor upfront. In addition to the raspberry flavor, there’s also some dark cherry notes. Very juicy flavor and finishes with a nice lingering tartness."

"Overall this is a good beer, but it feels just slightly incomplete for me. The raspberry is hinted at, the sour starts to pucker, but then gives way to a cheese curd finish. Very interesting, and I would definitely have again, but it just needed something more to get to great for me."

"Puckering raspberry acidity with a seedy dry finish. Juicy and fruity, though I'm told not quite as sour as the latest batch on draft. Light to medium bodied, easy to drink. Overall it's pretty good, not as wild or funky as I'd hoped, but it seems to be a good stand in substitute for scarcer traditional framboise lambic."

"Bottle: Poured a deep reddish color ale with a nice large pink color head with good retention with some light lacing. Aroma of sour raspberry notes with some tart notes. Taste is also dominated by some tart raspberry notes with some acidic notes and some light funky notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. A tad too acidic for my taste and missing some funky barnyard notes but still plenty satisfying."

"Pours a mostly clear dark pink+orange tinted red. Smell is geuze-y plus raspberry juice... funky barnyard, citric, slight band-aid thing, but not going too far into funkland. Taste: sort of a cranberry-raspberry motif... raspberry, acetic, nice acid and sweet balance, oaky vinous edges. Nice and intense without getting esoteric."
""
""
"O/D - Doesn't really wow, but it definitely does the trick. Acidic enough but the fruit flavour could be more tart. Good."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - This ranks right up there with the LP Framb IMO. The balnace between sour and fruit are very impressive. Recommended"
""
"Didn't really have any expectations for this one and it was a pleasant sour. Good fresh raspberry flavors with a nice authentic sourness."
"Pretty awesome, big raspberry but doesn't hold back on the sour/funky flavors."

"12.7 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a cloudy reddish/purple color with about an inch and a half light pink head. Head retention and lacing are both good enough. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like tart and sweet (mostly tart) raspberries, oak and funk. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some lemon and a little bit of grape and vanilla. Lots of tartness in this one! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good fruit lambic, I'd like to try this one again."
""

"Pretty bottle and it pours a murky guava hue with a frothy two finger head that doesn't stay for long and leaves some subtle tight sporadic lacing,the smell is raspberries,vinegar,funky feet and sour cherry,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,a touch rough and overcarbonated and I know it's raspberries but I get sour cherry and lots of it first up followed by funky white wine and vinegar finished with a über sour raspberry tartness and overall I was abit let down with this and it def needs some age on it cheers."
"O: An impressive lambic; extreme taste that's perhaps too much of a mix of sweet, sour and funky, but a good brew, that definitely provides a good fix for a sour craving."
"Poured a light red body with minimal pink head that died quick with lace patches on top of an overtly razzy aroma and little bits of sweetness as well. Stronger than other lambics so it's a little boozy in the finish but other than that a pretty good beer and textbook lambic. Has a strong raspberry taste that is sour/funky but not too strong and has a minor bit of razzy sweetness but not sugary/over sweetened. The tartness is just right for me as I can keep drinking this beer without getting sickened by being over tart/puckering or over sweetened/cloying and a great dessert beer."

"Overall: tart and refreshing; an extremely drinkable beer. Good stuff."

"Overall: A really nice fruit lambic; the sweet and tart flavors complement each other and there is plenty of funk"

"A really nice framboise, maybe not quite as complex as some of the bigger lambic makers, but still a nice treat. Look forward to trying the other versions."
"D: This was a very nice raspberry lambic. The scent and taste had a great balance of sweet fruit and sour funk. The body was appropriate, but the finish was really intense, so it must be sipped. Could age for a long time, but pretty enjoyable fresh. Sold brew."
"O: This beer has a very bold amount of funk; the nose is akin to a gueuze. I liked this one because the fruit made the taste a little more palatable but wasn't sweet."
"O: I love how the tart funkiness in the aroma of this beer continues to intensify as the beer warms. I really enjoy the fact that this one is not sweet and has no natural or artificial sweeteners added. This one is kind of intense, similar to a gueze, so if you do not like those you might want to avoid this one. I really enjoyed this one and look forward to trying some of it's sibling offerings."
""
""
"O- For the price, even with it being cheaper than usual, I should've just stuck with the go-to Belgians, but it was definitely worth a try. Had the spontankriek and this blew that out of the water. Worth a one time buy"

"Pinkish red body, rose head with light lacing and a ring of retention. Nose has sour new tennis balls, raspberries/berries, chlorophenol and general funk. Tastes has raspberries, strawberries, tennis balls, with a sour and fruity finish. Medium feel, high carbonation. Better as it warms."
""
""
"O: Raspberries and sour funkness...how yummy!"
"D - Very tart and acidic. Nicely balanced and good kick."
""
""
"Overall: I was really pleasantly surprised. I would like to have seen a little bit more of that traditional lambic funkiness, but that's only a minor complaint. This ranks in the upper echelon of raspberry lambics I've had."
"The beer pours a cloudy ruby red color with a small layer of off white head that fades away quickly. The color is quite nice. The nose is full of raspberries with some lambic funk and a strong oak presence. The flavor follows from the smell, but the raspberry fades towards the end of the sip leaving you with oak and a lemony tartness. The mouthfeel is on the thick side with lots of smooth carbonation and an extremely dry finish. This is a very nice lambic. My only complaint is that the fruit goes away a bit too quickly."
""
"On-tap. Wine glass. Enjoyed on agt´12. Dark pink color, chill haze appearance. Pinky froth creates a copious, rocky & lasting crown. Aromas of toasted malts, molasses & fresh acidic/sour berries. Gentle malty upfront overwhelmed by strong acidic touch. Light body. Moderate to low carbonation. Oily texture. Tartaric/acidic apples & pears in the middle. Low sugary & fruity finish lingers into the aftertaste. Worth to try !!"

"Pours a hazed, dark pink/ruby with a thin pink head. Earthy and seedy aroma of black raspberry, jam, leaves, and dirt. Crisp, refreshing flavor. Dry and effervescent with a sweeter flavor than expected but a light raspberry tartness to balance the fruit. Some oak and lemon as well."
""
""
"The beer pours a dark ruby raspberry color, well carbonated to maintain a thin white head that dissipates quickly. The nose presents a tart fruity funkiness that screams sour ale raspberries. it doesn't pop as much as a raspberry ananke, but does well to present the fruit forward. The taste is quite distinctly sweet raspberries up front followed by a great mix of funk and bitterness in the beer's finish. The mouthfeel is effervescent, light-medium bodied, well attenuated, and a funky, tart, bitter aftertaste. Overall, this is a bit overpriced, but definitely a solid raspberry sour."
"O- I have had better framboise, but I have to look a lot harder to find them."
"Not too shabby of a fruit lambic - the pungent tartness is there, no doubt, but it also has the good grace to allow the malt and other fruit characteristics some lesser airtime. A mid-level example of the style, when you're thinking of stepping up your game beyond the introductory, sugar-heavy players."
""
""
"This was a lot better than expected. I approached this beer with some trepidation, but this is a very well done raspberry sour. It's fairly expensive, but it's a really nice legitimately lambic-ish raspberry sour, and that justifies the price for me."
""
""
"O- A tasty raspberry lambic, wine adds a nice twist to the beer. Price tag was high, but I am very happy that I picked this up. Worth trying if you enjoy lambics."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. I'd certainly drink this anytime."
""
""
""
"O-Not a bad effort. The beer was not as complex as the best lambics out there, but the fruit flavors were genuine tasting, not artificial as can sometimes be the case with fruit lambics, IMHO. If you dig raspberries, here you go!"
"wow, the second spontan beer for me and definitely my favorite. this one pours a really robust ruby red, almost artificial looking, like this color is digitaly enhanced or something. a nice white head rests on top, stained pink just a bit. the nose is crazy raspberry. this feels more intesely raspberry than the kriek did cherry. its fruity but not sweet, with a really funky tart yeast backing everything up. the yeast and the fruit combine to do wonderful things. this isnt a sour in the classic sense, but it is tart rather than sweet. that funk on the raspberries is totally unique, like nothing ive tasted before, and i really really like it. its not a beer i could drink a lot of, but its a nice one to try. its got a medium body and supercharged carbonation. an excellent product, as all mikkeller beers seem to be."

"Where I have found Mikkeller beers to be ultra challenging and complex, I have also been critical on the aspects of those complexities that I have found unrefined or too challenging to my palate. I cannot say any of that here- this is an authentic tasting sour beer that deserves the stage with Hanssen's and Boon."
"This beer is a bit pricey at $12, but if you're trying to explore sours, sooner or later you have to plunk down more money than you'd like. I'm glad I tried this one. It was a very educational pour. I wouldn't advise this to someone new to sours. In fact, I might come back to it someday after I've had a few others."
"A good sour beer, lack some brett vibes though."
"Served from bottle into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass (proper!). Poured a deep dark ruby red with a one finger light pink head that remained throughout the glass. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, fruit, raspberry, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, funk, raspberry, fruit, and very subtle tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Upon taking the first smell on this one I was quite excited as it really reminded me of Rose de Gambrinus minus the usual Cantillon funk. It was also quite a nice looking brew as well. The flavor however had a earthy note to it that cut into some of the sweetness which definitely hurt it slightly for me. I really wish that would not have been the case as besides that this was a really good brew that could have received very high marks from me. Haven’t had it before? What the Hell are you waiting for?"

"O: by far my favorite of the spontans thatbive gotten to try, very nicley done, gear tartness and fruit flavor, the musky oak bitterness worked a bit better with this one, and felt a little tones Down on this one."
"O: For the style it was really good. Refreshing and sour with lots of fruit. I am kinda of hit or miss on Lambics. However, this one was good."
""
"Agressive pour yielded wonderful head that dissipated to some thin nice lacing. Nice cloudy dark purple color with a soft sour scent with a hint of rich raspberry. Mouthfeel is just a tad nicer and better carbonated than the Spontanale. Overall a wonderful raspberry lambic with a nice sweet undertone from the fruit to offset the tartness."
""
"O: This is a high quality lambic from a brewer that never fails to surprise. I'm really digging this beer. It's not often that foreign brewers do an authentic lambic well. I hope that the rest of the beers in this series live up to this ale's standard."
""
""
"D - I liked this quite a bit - it's better than the lower-end lambics we get in the US (Van Honsebrouck, Oud Beersel), but doesn't quite stack up with stuff like Hommage or Veritas 006. Still, if the price was right I'd buy this again - hopefully soon, as I hear these are coming Stateside."
"A nice lambic but the overall flavour profile lacks the complexity of the best 3F and Cantillon beers."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. There is seemingly no indication of the alcohol in this brew. It is drinkable but a bit of a mess that never quite comes together to be an enjoyable brew. There are just a bunch of things about this experience that are off-putting. Worth a try? Absolutely. Something I would have again? Probably not. A 375ml bottle split between 2 people was more than enough."
"Overall; simple and solid, extremely drinkable and unlike the Spontonkriek, the higher abv is undetectable."
