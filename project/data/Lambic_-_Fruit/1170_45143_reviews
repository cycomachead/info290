"Wow. This is by far the most sour thing I have ever drank before. So sour that I didn't get much of the kiwi."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This sour is more sour than average, but is very enjoyable."
""
""
"O-Just too sour.  And that is something I never thought I would say."
"This beer is harshly tart, like most other Uplands, and painfully so. The kiwi flavor peeks its way through, but in general, the tart quality is overwhelming and wholly cringe and pain worthy."
""
""
"Over the top acidity. Tasted some of the kiwi fruit but this is an acid enamel pealing bomb. Not sure why Upland bottled and sold this."
""
""
"Very sour, kiwi, oak, nice funk, light fruity sweetness, lactic"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If you like excessively sour beers, you'll like this.  I get the kiwi up front, but then it's all sourness."
"Brutally sour. One dimensional. Much better options out there."

"O - One dimensional, sensationalized beer that is getting way too much hype."

"Bottle: Poured a light yellow color lambic with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of paint thinner is pretty intense with quite a bit of acidic notes and sour notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by paint thinner notes with intense sour notes and quite a bit of acidic notes. Kiwi is quite hard to distinguish. Body is light with good carbonation. The paint thinner notes were a big turn-off for me."
"This was by far the sourest Upland I've had to date.  Not sure I was getting much kiwi in the taste or smell, but it was enjoyable for someone that likes enamel stripping sourness."
""
"I cannot believe the high marks this is getting. It starts out ok with a nice, hazy gold/tangerine color. Lacto heavy citrus nose. The first sip is where everything goes wrong. Extreme puckering and enamel erasing blast immediately. Lacto overpowered everything in this. Couldnt finish it. Complete mess. I love upland, but this falls flat on its face."
""
"Overall:  Another nice fruited lambic from Upland; not as sour as some of the others"
""
""
""

"Overall: I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this, especially after seeing some of the other reviews complain of rampant sourness and minimal kiwi flavor. This is less sour than, say, La Folie, and has a lot of flavors other than ""sour"" going onâ€”it hits the kiwi perfectly, but there's also some creamy sweetness and funk. Superb."

"pour is hazy pale amber white a white head.  Nose is bright kiwi with faint brett notes.  Fruit and tart.  Taste has more barrel, lots of fresh sawdust and kiwi behind.  Funk is lighter than most uplands but barrel is very present.  Finish is extremely tart and has a bit of acetic acid.  Body is light and highly carbonated."

"Have had this multiple times in the past year.  Basically this is just pure acid.  The liquid in the bottle has barely any kiwi flavor to it and is so sour that it feels like the enamel is being stripped from my teeth and it attacks the lining in my stomach.  It's barely drinkable.  This was from the first lottery batch.  I hope the second round is more palatable.  I enjoy sours, but this one needs more kiwi flavor and less sour."

"2010 Bottle - sourness was over the top. Kiwi was way in the back but was still slightly present. Very good but I think a bit past it's prime."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with low carbonation. Pretty good, but the carbonation could be a touch higher. Overall, a nice lambic. As compared to the Cherry Lambic, the extra hint of kiwi sweetness adds an extra dimension."
""
"Overall, this may be the most sour beer I've ever had, and I think that is the combo of a sour fruit with the lambic base. It does display some kiwi flavor, but no copious amounts. This is really a beer for those that like to pucker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Finally I get to try some of the best Upland has to offer. This is worth the hassle and should be opened very fresh. It's already more bitingly-tart than if expected and I wouldn't want to lose any more balance from the kiwi."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is probably the most sour of the Upland ""lambics."" A toned-down acidity and more kiwi character would have been nice."
"Cost: $25 for a 750 ml bottle."

"Overall- The most sour beer I've ever had. Damn, 10/10 sour easily. Beatification and Sour Reserve #3 are a lot more complex and interesting while delivering that 8/10 sour quotient here. Its disappointing that I'm not really getting any kiwi fruit qualities. This is not necessary to age at all, I can't imagine how sour a 09 Kiwi is right now..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really tart lambic from upland that reminds me of Sour Reserve with a hint of kiwi to it"

"Insanity sour level with a super subtle but nice kiwi note. Flatness hurts it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another great offering by Upland outside of their everyday beer. This ranks just shy of their Malefactor (Gilgamesh) in my books. It's balanced very well, with a strong sour presence yet plenty of other fruity characters to compliment nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Nice little sipper here. Nothing amazing, just really good. The price of admission is really high, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Almost gueuze-like, this beer is just earthy and sour. I feel like kiwi would be a tough flavor to impart into a beer, but I wish I could get some fruit from it. Maybe it would be fruitier fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Delightful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I thought this was a really nice lambic, but I was hoping for more fruit. I'd definitely have more and enjoyed it a lot."

"Medium body, well carbonated, dry and mouth-puckering on the palate. The kiwi has lost a step due to age, but this is one of those sours you feel in the back of your gums after the first few sips. I'd like to try a fresher bottle next time to see how the fruit comes through, but this was a really enjoyable one."
"Overall this is my second favorite of the 5 or so Upland fruited lambics I have tried to date. Still not as awesome as the Persimmon, but heads and tails above the various berry offerings I have sampled. Not sure how this may have changed over time in the bottle but I hope I can sample a fresher bottle down the road."
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some general fruity aromas. Taste is much the same and the kiwi does come out a bit more in the flavor and has a super acidic finish. this beer has a very high level of carbonation with a super crisp and acidic mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great taste that is super drinkable."

"There's an overall clean, nearly all lactic sourness that commands the beer and shows restraint with the complexities of heavy must, horse hair, or mushroom earthiness- this all allows the actual kiwi to shine through the more aggressive sour flavors. Though the fruit flavor seems melon-like, I can also see the influence of kiwi playing a pronounced role in the flavor spread. Well done Upland, well done!"
""
""
""
"Steer clear if you dislike enamel-melting sourness. Otherwise, Kiwi is the strongest offering from Upland yet."
""
"Overall this one is a treat to drink. Great balance of sweet kiwi fruit alongside the tart/sour, musty and barnyard qualities expected from a lambic. Another great job by Upland and I look forward to cracking the remaining beers Al has kindly sent me."
"O: A really nice sour!"
"O- fantastic fruited lambic from upland. absolutely seek this one out if you are a fan of the style. not as kiwi forward as I had imagined, but the complexity and pucker factor make this one a cant-miss."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good. Surprising that it's not a Belgium made lambic, this one is easily as good a some of the Cantillon I've had. Must try for sour fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My first of the Upland lambics, and this definitely has me looking forward to the others. Sour and funky, but also a nice fruit presence."
"This is a beer I can see drinking again and again. That was my only bottle, so anybody reading this with a bottle, I'd prolly trade you something good for it."
""
""
""
"4/4/4/3.5/4.5"
"Bottle from the most recent batch. Orange gold, huge white head. Great sweet and sour aroma. Lactic sour bites the nose but the sweetness of the fruit is just as potent. Flavors are wonderful. The sour is eye crossing at first but the sweetness of the fruit cuts it like a knife. Great balance. Tons of carbonation. Yet another great lambic from Upland."
""
""
""
""
"(D)- I like this one alot. Very heavy on the acidity/oak/funk realm and like on the fruit. Not a ton of discernible kiwi in this, but its there. Definitely one of the better Uplands."
""
"Pours a cloudy gold with a very small head, surprising considering the reputation the Upland Lambic have for being gushers (I did chill it for about 20 minutes in the freezer). Aromas are tart and funky, with lots of oak, lemon juice, and a definite tropical fruit aspect. I don't think ""kiwi"" would be my first guess, but I can see it. Taste is similar to the nose, tart and tropical with a good amount of oak and funk. Surprisingly refreshing, with a crisp mouthfeel, medium body, sharp carbonation, and dry, puckering finish. Definitely one of the most sour beers I've tried, very well-crafted and delicious! Can't wait to try the others!"
"One of the better sour offerings from Upland. Caleb's got this program dialed in."

"MF/O: Fizzly carbonation and it's dry flavor only intensifies the sourness of this beer- it's like the end of a box of sour patch kids. No kiwi that I could find (kind of disappointing in that way), but overall really good"
""
""
"Overall: This is in my top 2 of the Upland Lambics that I have tried so far. Blackberry is the other Upland that I really enjoyed."

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottled on 12-6-10, Batch 134-08. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch carbonated white head that fizzled away quickly. No lacing, either. Aroma is mostly tart fruit, along with some funk, lemon peel and a bit of kiwi. The taste is nice and tart, the brew tastes like lemon peel, funk, tart apples, kiwi and oak. This is definitely a tart and acidic brew. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high but soft carbonation and it's very easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good brew, and it's my favorite of the Upland Lambics I've tried so far. $19.79 a bottle and worth every penny!"
"Loved this beer. Im partial to anything that makes me pucker without leaving a bad taste in my mouth."
"(Zep9865, Kyle). This one pours a dark and murky, dirty gold in color. It smells both lactic and tart and is on the verge of gueuze, interestingly enough. I even get some California Chardonnay notes from the oak. Unlike the Persimmon, I don't get fresh fruit let alone any kiwi. The flavor is nice and tart, almost a sweet and sour. The kiwi fruit doesn't really show itself. It eventualy does pick up some melon character though. It's an interesting beer to say the least. It is somehow fruity without showing the premiere fruit. It finishes like it should, like a dry lambic with soft fruit character. It features really nice and interesting flavors. Overall this is a fine beer and is easily one of Upland's best."
"4.5 D: One of my favorites. I think I would appreciate this just as much if it didn't have any kiwi. It really doesn't need it. Tons of flavors with a solid moderate acidity make this a great beer."
"I like this one; it's super carbonated and super duper sour. I'm starting to like these Upland Lambics."
"The body is nice and light with moderate carbonation. Again, very clean on the finish. Overall this is pretty impressive. Nice and sour with good fruit flavors. Best of the Uplands I've had so far."
"D - I liked this significantly more than Batch 1 - it seems as if each release of Upland lambics is superior to the last. These always seem to empty very quickly at tastings and they're superb for breaking up an onslaught of heavier beers. I'm looking forward to cracking all the other flavors I have cellared away."
"Big sour kiwi flavor. Like trying to eat an unripe, hard kiwi. Salty mineral flavor lingers on the tongue. This beer is very sour but still holds it's drinkability. I like the clean finish on it."
"O - A solid beer, especially if I wasn't expecting a fruit lambic. There's some nice flavors from the fermentation and I think the Upland lambic program has potential, but this beer isn't quite world class. Still tasty, though."
"O: A very interesting brew. Blisteringly sour. Intense, strong, and complex. Although small amounts would probably be best. A great beer to share with friends."
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a small white head. Smells of the very destinct lambic funk with some great fruityness coming in. Taste is pretty tart up front with some nice kiwi fruit tastes coming through in the aftertaste, this is like nothing else I have ever tasted. Mouthfeel and carbonation are lambic all the way. Overall amazing beer."
"O - Nice beer, not one of the best, but it's good and delivers on what you think it should be. Gets a bump up in overall because kiwi itself is a unique beer to make and they did a good job. Expecting even better as they continue to make these."
"Having them side by side, this is clearly the worst of the Upland lambics. The kiwi taste is not overly strong in the first place and placing it in a beer doesn't help that flavor come through. A decent beer overall but nothing like advertised."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! A gusher! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a minimal white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, kiwi, funk, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, kiwi, BIG funk, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. The sharp funkiness of this one really threw me off a bit as I was expecting the kiwi to dominate on this one. However, it was a pleasant surprise for sure. While the funk was definitely the star of the show, the kiwi did manage to add some sweetness to the brew while the sour notes helped to cut it a little too. This made this brew quite drinkable and enjoyable. Really glad I got to try this one, but not my favorite of the series that I've had."
"Pours a highly carbonated hazy yellow. A good amount of head that dissipates quickly. Smells lightly fruity. Not so much kiwi but something light and fruity. A nice sour funk but this is a beautiful beer. Tastes very unusual. Kiwi i suppose but not what i expected. Almost a butter hint. The funkiness is great and melds well with the base beer. Overall very tasty. Something I'm very happy to have tried"
"Overall this was about what I expected"
"Beer is thin and really bright on the forward palate. Not as tart as the others but a nice acetic and succinic punch gives your taste buds a wake up call. Pretty heavily carbonated on the palate gives the carbonic boost to the lactic smoothness, thinning out the sourness and carrying the beer to the finish. I really enjoyed it. Not as good as the persimmon or the raspberry but definitely in the top few I've had."
"Overall, a terrific fruit lambic. Along with Persimmon lambic, this is my favorite offering from Upland Brewing Company thus far."
"I really preferred the persimmon"
"Pours a semi-cloudy orange like color with a frothy white head that dies down rather quickly. The nose is of funk, sour tart fruit, a small amount of kiwi, and more funk. The flavor is just brilliant. The kiwi is extremely well integrated without taking over from the base funk with this sour. The mouthfeel is full with bubbly carbonation all around the palate. Probably one of my favorite Upland lambics and can't wait to try the rest of them."
"Reviewed on 5/13/2010. Bottle thanks to FlssmrBrewAlum. This was a delayed gusher (but luckily I didn't lose too much). Pours a super cloudy dirty orange with a thick white head that quickly subsides. Tons of yeast sediment. Aroma of potent funk and sour fruit (kiwi I guess). Flavor of sharp citrus, kiwi, and sour funk in the finish. Great palate for a lambic-- just a touch of acidity but overall very drinkable. This was one of the most enjoyable lambics/sours I have had in awhile."
"Reviewed from notes. Batch 1, a big thanks to Chris for sharing this. Poured into tulip, color is golden yellow with no head. Smell is hay, berries, sweet malts and bready dough. Taste is very interesting - Coconut, kiwis, cloves. The kiwi is suprisingly good, not a flavor I thought would come through in a beer this well. A tiny hint of sourness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and near still, some acidity in the finish. A very good beer but I wouldnt exactly say it is a lamic. Good drinkability for whatever the style actually is."
"Pours a moderate golden color with a wee bit of haze. There is a slight white head that has some lasting power. The nose brings some tart, light kiwi notes. It's not overpowering, but it is definitely there. I really like what it does to the beer when combined with a bit of funk, oak, and sourness. Kiwi is certainly a fruit that more brewers should be using with regard to lambics. Maybe the flavor fades really quickly and that's why. Either way, this beer combines the fruit with the sourness and mild funky plus oak quite well. Nice feel and drinks incredibly well."
"A good wild ale overall. Worth seeking out."
"Probably the most Lambic like of any of the Uplands I have had, my guess is that the extra time in the bottle has funk'd this up nicely; though this is still quite a long ways from emulating any of the remotely traditional Lambic blenders / brewers. On the other hand the kiwi influence is pretty non-existent at this point. It is interesting how fast this beer fades in the palate. After a couple minutes presence, flavor and complexity of this beer seems to drop out quite a bit; this is even true after taking a break from the beer for about an hour. Now if Upland can only figure out how to carbonate one of these, capture the vibrant fresh fruit character and have a base beer that is actually funky all at the same time then they will really have something; perhaps some of the new batches have done this.... Hmm."
"An easy to drink unique sour worth trying. I tasted the rareness in batch 1 but I'm looking forward to tasting the improvement in batch 2."
"Drinkability: Drinks fairly easily. I don't think that I could pick out any kiwi on a blind taste. I have been much more impessed by their other lambics."
"DR- Great. Could have a lot of these if it was possible. Would drink again given the opportunity, but not seek it out. Given the rarity I would go with a Belgian anyday, but great to see an american brewery progressing so well in this style."
"Edit: Just had a batch 1 and batch 2 blow it out of the water."
"d - A very enjoyable sour from Upland. I think I liked Batch 1 better, and thought the smell of Batch 2 was a bit funkier. Would like to try again sometime."
"Poured a hazy golden orange with yellow highlights that had a finger of head and left a little bit of lacing sticking to the sides of the glass. The aroma was quite nice and gave characteristics that it would be nice and sour with acidic citrus notes popping out along with slight brett, oak, and green apple but really was trying to find the kiwi within the nose after every whiff. The taste was quite similar to the nose consisting of acidic citrus, green apples and oaky bretty accents. Sip after sip and no real big kiwi character on the palate but it did have faint pineapple notes. The brew was medium body with a good amount of prickly carbonation which had a sweet, sour, acidic, and dry finish. It drank really good but I wish it had big kiwi flavor alonside a sour punch; oooone daaaay."
"D: Probably the best of the Upland lambics that I've had, with the Blackberry being surpassed by this one. Still, a bit too sweet for me, but a nice beer."
"Pours a hazy-yellowish color with a half to full finger of white head. Smell is brett, some more funk, and a very little amount of kiwi. You can smell some fruit and slight citrus, but not really kiwi. Flavor is tart with some citrus. Kiwi is extremely hidden. I wonder if the kiwi's they used weren't ripe enough, that would explain a lot. It is a good beer, but I was hoping for a ""kiwi bomb"" I guess, as I love kiwi's, but I'm pretty sure I did see some kiwi seeds, bonus. Quite a bit of carb on this one, felt really good and it felt really crisp and lively. Drinkability is really good, I wish I had another bottle to share with friends, but there's always next release!"
"D- This beer is fantastic. This years was better than when I have had it before. I am glad I really got to try this one out and wish I had a bottle for the cellar. Do yourself a favor and seek this one out. It just shows you that even a good lambic can be brewed in the midwest. Upland..your beers may be a little balnd at times but your lambic shine through and through."
"Poured a recent BA tasting event courtesy of hannot, this is the '10 vintage. Pours a very unique cloudy off-yellow color with a foamy head. Pretty to look at. Some mild and earthy fruit characteristics on the nose. Taste is 6/10 on the pucker-meter with fruity tartness dominating and some hints of kiwi in the aftertaste. Best part is the chunks of kiwi lining the glass and accumulating for a nice finish. Very refreshing and bright."
"It's a refreshing incarnation of lambic, more of a success than the last batch, and definitely something i'd drink again."
"Recommended."
"Drinkability- Really tasty brew that pretty much fits the mold for the Upland Lambic family. Really fruity, really woody and ultra drinkable. The carbonation was much better in this one than the previous years but it was a bit much this time around. Split the difference and we have a winner. Thank much Matt!!"
"D: Of all the varieties of fruit out there, kiwi is one of my LEAST favorite, though it's probably the texture more than the flavor I dislike. That said, I was happy with this 'lambic' and found the subtleties of the fruit usage pleasing. Not an amazing beer, but a good one and one I'm glad to have been fortunate enough to try."
"I now believe that a lot of the hype on this one was because of how limited it was, continuous trend of this brewery's lambics being too sweet, far from what breweries in Belgium has to offer, might drink again, worth trying but wait until next year when more of it is released and you do not have to trade too heavily for it, do not think this one will age and become any better either, I actually think it will do the opposite"
"That said, pretty cool to try one of only 48 bottles in existence."
"No carbonation and kind of watery in the finish...the lack of carbonation wouldn't be too much of a problem if there beer had a drier finish, still it's pretty easy to drink and more brett character to keep it from tasting just like juice (like the blueberry)."
"This is a standout lambic."
" Wish more of these could have made it through the barrel explosion but minus the 2 bottles I seen drank there are still 46 more bottles"
