"Raspberry galore, sweet but not too sweet, light tartness, more viscous than the sours I'm used to."

"O:  This beer is pretty good.  It isn't as good as some but it has plenty of fruit flavors, tartness and a decent amount of complexity.  I think I might pick up another bottle to see how it changes after a year."

"One thing's for sure- it sells its raspberry character well!"

"as lambics go, im not sure this is my favorite, not tart enough, not acidic hardly at all, and lacking the wild fermentation characteristics i usually look for in the style, but as a fruited belgian ale, i absolutely love it, and its head and shoulders better than its immediate peers. natural looking purple pink raspberry color, a short lived stained pink head, and some chunks of yeast and maybe even a few raspberry seeds in there, it looks the part. the nose is great, jammy but not overly sweet, authentic fruity character and a little belgian yeast funk and fruit, but not the sourness true lambic usually possesses. i love the fruit flavor, not quite as true as the nose, mellowed by an oak hit here, but its still the chief flavor agent, and a genuine one at that. no corn sugar, no cavities, just true raspberry beer. its affordable and tasty, well carbonated and light, and overall extremely well made for what it is. not really passable as a sour, but im not sure its trying to be one. highly respectable brew here, better than some of the other fruit editions i think too, really summery and real fruity, i almost feel guilty for liking this as much as i do..."

"This pours a raspberry red in color, straight up. The aroma smacks of raspberry jam in its character and intensity. The flavor has a raspberry tartness with a sweetish but not cloying finish. Much preferred this to the more common “bar” framboise."

"Quite the opposite from the Weyerbacher Riserva I tried before this. It pours a dark ruby with a 2 finger head and smells of raspberry candy. Full on raspberry candy. Taste is similar. There is nothing tart about this, and I feel as though I am drinking a raspberry syrup. Sweet and thick from start to finish, this is more like a raspberry punch than beer."

""
"Shared with wife at Gainesville HOB. Pours deep red with pink head. Huge sweet raspberry aroma. Flavor is super sweet and tart raspberries and sugar. Something slightly weird on the back end like sweet-n-low flavor. Not bad. Wife liked it, but I have had better raspberry flavors in my beer. Slightly artificial was off-putting, but this smells great."
""
""
"O: This is not how I like my Lambics - this is like a beer with raspberry-lemonade."
""
""

"Poured into a pint glass."

"Pretty nice and refreshing lambic here. Not much ""sour"" happening, rather lots of sweetness. Huge raspberry flavor gets coupled nicely with a bit of cherry, too. Pretty similar to Lindeman's Framboise, though it's been quite a while since I've had that one, so I don't know if I can say for sure which one is better. Very close, though, and would both go well with this quesadilla."

"Had this on tap several times, but from memory. Looks really inviting, like I take a 36 oz tankard of this stuff! Smells of bread and ripe raspberries and floral-ness...I'd swim in this stuff. Taste is fruit forward, and lightly sour, but not over the top (although I love this too), and fresh raspberries (duh...) and bread. Mouthfeel is appropriate, carbonation is low, and everything is well balanced and considered. I'd drink this until the end of time."
""
""
"O: This is an enjoyable and drinkable fruit lambic that doesn't have artificial flavors and has much more tartness compared to sweetness. It almost feels like you're having a very strong raspberry sorbet."
""
""
"Pour is blood red with pink hues and a dark pink head. The nose is overly sweet and singular, loads of raspberry purée and raspberry syrup. Taste is just that with maybe a touch of tartness. Decent carbonation and syrupy feel. Simple and too sweet, no lambic notes or depth."
""
"Reasonably smooth, somewhat tart while still being refreshing and sweet. Dessert in a glass. The equal of Duchess du Bourgogne."
""
""
"O - a nice treat every once in a while."
"D: drinkable and enjoyable. I would have this again, but I wouldn't want to buy it/drink it in large quantities. 4.0"

"Pretty good lambic. Every now and then I really enjoy these beers and this is definitely one of those days. Nice raspberry jam flavors mingle well with the yeast notes."
""
""
"Pours a clear cranberry juice color with a reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of raspberries and raspberry juice but there is a slight hint of cleaning product aroma as well. Taste is of sweetened raspberries and raspberry juice with some grain/malt flavors on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good fruit lambic but not as good as some similar ones I have had in the past."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this beer was a little fake tasting. The amount of fruit flavor was so intense the beer tasted unpleasant and overwhelming. Lindimans has a better showing in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this lambic. I will definitely be purchasing this one again."
""
""
""
"Overall:	Not bad, a little tarter than most frambroise that I have tried but that is not a totally bad thing. I do think the overpowering carbonation does create an issue with the tast."

"4.5, 3, 2, 3, 2"

"O: Of the St. Louis beers, this is by far the best one I've tried. Unlike many commercial framboise lambics, this one is not cloying."
""
""
"O - An enjoyable fruit lambic - one with over the top fruit. First time trying this one...surprising given how available this one is. Not the best Framboise I've ever had, but solid quality, enjoyable, reasonably priced and easy to get...sounds like a winner to me - thinking I'll be getting this again in the near future."
"O: This beer was borderline cloying for me. It ends up being very drinkable though. Just one at a time."
"O- Superbly drinkable, great tasting, too sweet for a session beer though."
"Disclaimer: I rate backsweetened lambics to the style of sparkling fruit juice, not actual lambics."
"Picked it at the Gourmet Store at Siam Discovery in Bangkok. I was preparing for a romantic evening with my lady on the 58th Floor Club Room of the Lebua State Tower on the Chao Phraya riverfront. A fruit lambic ?? Always works. Split the beer into two small but sturdy pours into the available wine glasses. The liquid was a bursting rosy red crowned with a shouting pink head. Hardly any retention and no lacing at all. This was a little comical as I found the appearance to be very child friendly. The nose was full of raspberry tartness. This didn't smell like a beer at all, except for the yeast aroma that was unmistakably Belgianesque. For me, thats when the love affair and appreciation ended (for the beer) - the taste was too sweet for my liking, like a raspberry candy. Maybe i was not used to lambics, but this tasted artificially sweet. Of course, it was tart as hell, thankfully to give some credibility to the taste. Beer was medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, I wouldn't go out of the way looking out for this one again, though it definitely is a lady pleaser, and maybe suitable for an after dinner sit out."
"O: Good beer for the style. Nothing I'll drink regularly, but nice to have something most people will enjoy."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured ruby red with a three finger pink head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberries, strawberries, and cream. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. I really enjoyed this one as a nice palate cleanser as it was not abrasive to the tongue at all and left a rather pleasant aftertaste. The fruit on this one was definitely the start of the show as one would expect from this style. This is a definite must try and could be a good gateway brew for some females who are fans of fruitier mixed drinks."
"Just a great lambic."
"Pours a deep reddish color with a small pink head, decent retention. Aroma is full of raspberry and a hint of sour. In the taste, berries coupled with the apple cider like quality of the St.Louis geueze base beer. Tart, lightly sour, and very fruity. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with a smooth feel and a lingering tart raspberry note. Overall, not bad, but I was hoping for more funk."
"O - Not a bad beer, tastes fine, nothing overly complex or amazing, but I didn't hate it."
"O: Delicious sour framboise. 4.5"
"This limbic pours out as a red bubbly liquid with a pink fizzy head on top. The smell of the beer is sweet and full of raspberries. The taste is also very sweet and should be drank like a dessert or something. Lots of sugary raspberries in this brew. The mouthfeel is a little thick but still has a good carbonation to it. Overall this could be switched with a Lindaman's and not many people would notice the difference."
"Aroma is sweet sweet sweet raspberries. No funk or sourness to be found. This was definitely back-sweetened. Same thing with the flavor, as a cloying sweetness overshadows the fresh taste of the raspberries. Syrupy and a bit too thick on the palate, a re-chracterization of this beer would do it good. If you like sweet fruit beers, this is one to try. If you are expecting a funky or sour lambic, stay away, because despite what others here have said, you aren't going to find anything remotely traditional here."
"Very good. Compared to Lindeman's this is more funky, perhaps a bit less sweet, less carbonated, and way less aromatic. I would try this again."
"Overall Drinkability - Delicious lambic, but maybe not enough complexity to achieve a high score."
"Poured on tap at the Blind Lady Ale House in San Diego, the beer was served in a mini-snifter. The beer pours a syrupy, deep, vibrant blood red color. The beer has a good lacing as you drink, and maintains a thin film of head. The nose is syrupy/sugary sweet raspberry. Legitimate raspberry flavors with dark sweetness and decreased carbonation when compared with something like Lindeman's. Very smooth, with a slight tartness on the finish. Body is thicker and more smooth than other fruit lambics, too."
"D- The nice raspberry flavor is not overly sweet and does have a nice fruit flavor. This is definitely not a fruit lambic but it is a nice fruit beer. Just a bit more depth would be nice if I were to drink more than one."
"O - This is a pretty nice lambic. Nice blend of sweet and tart."
"Served paired with the Not-So-Dirty cupcake (dark chocolate with a milk chocolate ganache) at Sweet Revenge in NYC. Most of the 5 parings our group ordered were great, but this one was particularly outstanding. The raspberry/chocolate combination is obviously, but what put this over the top is the way the earthyness of the sour pulled out some absolutely incredibly flavors from the chocolate. A highly recommended pairing."
"Overall: I don't want to, but I really like it. My wife called me a girl. If you want a funky, sour Framboise, this is not it. This is a sweet one, but with enough real lambic character that it doesnt taste like Lindemans."
"D: It is not as sour as I would prefer but it is still good and highly drinkable. Unfortunately, this lambic - and every other one - costs about $6 bucks per 12 oz so I do not drink many."
"Cheers..."
"The color is gorgeous...looks just like raspberry tart. Ruby, with light purple head and lacing. Aromas are balanced sweet/tart, tons of berries. The smell makes my mouth water immediately. Flavors follow. Pure raspberry goodness. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation. This one is a sipper for sure. Lambics are such a treat, and this one delivers exactly what I'm looking for."
"This is a good framboise. It's only the fourth I've tried, but I'm curious to try more of these and other (non-fruit-oriented) lambics."
"Notes: not as tart and defintely funkier than Lindemans. seemingly a little more balanced and easier to drink due the less puckering quality"
"D- I like the balance and the no overly sweetness of this brew"
"Drinkability: I'm very glad i've finally tried a Lambic, and will continue to explore the style in the future. On it's own, this beer is doing little for me, but pairing it with something (a dessert most likely) would probably make it much more drinkable."
"I was kinda scared to try this and have been putting it off... poured into a pilsner glass. a very pretty rasberry red color. somewhat cloudy but not too bad. The head was has a kinda wine look and smell. Hello raspberry is what i said when i smelled this. the taste is a very sweet but accepting taste. drinks like a koolaid in all honesty. This is a beer you could drink with a citrus salad of some sort. This is a wonderfully carbonated drink with a great finish and leaves you wanting another one. Wonderful."
"Poured from corked caged bottle into Lindemans flute. Another colorful red bubbling brew. Very similar in smell to Lindemans, with a little more alcohol. Taste is similar to smell- still sweet, but a touch less than Lindemans. Must be looking for a very fruity brew to enjoy at the right time."
"Third beer of the night of Christmas eve. Paired with a chocolate-almond-raspberry tart. Served in a champagne glass. The bottle says this is a 2006 vintage. Opaque body, with a reddish pink color. Cotton candy colored head. Smell was very fruity and sugary. Flavor was all about the raspberries. Extremely tasty. Sugary on the palate, but has a decent drinkability because it's not overly sweet. Definitely a dessert beer. More of a lambic for those who prefer sweeter ones over tart & crisp ones."
"Pink, bright, frothy head. This smells straightly of raspberries -- what else? -- but the taste is well balanced. Not sticky-sweet, not pucker-your-lips sour, this is straight down the middle. It's not a soda-beer, it's a real fruit beer with style. Bubbly, good mouthfeel and ultimately, quite drinkable. It's one of the few beers that my wife, a beer hater, enjoys."
"Good color and nice pink head that quickly dissipates with minimal lacing. Smells of raspberries. Flavor is a perfect balance of fruity sweetness and wonderful sour raspberry notes. More sour and less sweet than the Lindemans, but firmly more sweet and less sour than the Cantillon. Nice and bubbly and a typically high drinkability despite the sour notes. Very refreshing."
"Drinkability: Easier to drink than an OJ in the morning"
"D: it is a bit sweet that is almost overwhelming, however it could be nice depending on the time."
"Drinkability: Because of the sweetness, I would not recommend too many, but one is an absolute must."
"Strong sweet-tart flavor. Far more candy-like than the smell suggests. Good faux-raspberry flavor. The aftertaste is short but is similar to that of a dessert. Well-balanced. Would likely taste great with some stinky cheese."
"D - You can have a couple of these and be just fine. Not a session for sure."
"Avoid. Nothing like the offerings from some of Belgium's better breweries."
"D - This lambic has alot going for it. Its an all around concise package. A solid lambic that doesnt break the bank."
"Pours a dark red with a bit of a brownish tint. Slight off white head with a bit of purple in there. Nose brings raspberries and quite a bit of sweetness. Taste is more raspberries and some sugar. There is a tiny bit of earth in the background. Feel is light to medium with decent carbonation. A bit cloying. Overall, a nice introduction for a novice, but not a terribly great beer."
"Pours a cherry red color, hazed from sediment, nice soapy cap of pinkish hued head. Scent is a big whiff of raspberry sweetness, not much more else to it. Taste thankfully isnt as sweet as the scent was leading towards, much more tart raspberry but there is a decent amount of sweetness. Lacks the funkyness i expect from the style. Body is medium, bubbly and the drink only touches the dryness im used to in the style. A good lambic that knocks artificial ones out of the water but doesnt touch the more respected brands in composition although it comes close in quality of ingredients."
"D - amazing. I could drink this all night, and plan to in the future."
"D - It tastes great and is fairly light in body, yet the sweetness really reduces the drinkability."
"D- great for the first glass..but couldnt see myself drinking it all night"
"Overall, this is a pretty bad lambic. Not sour or tart. Taste was artificial. Not very drinkable."
"Overall impression: Not something I'd drink all the time, but a nice change of pace. Went down nice and easy out on the porch on a sultry afternoon."
"Overall a typical framboise. Nowhere near Razz tart but decent."
"This is very quaffable, it is refreshing like a glass of raspberry juice; really juice is what this ""beer"" is. It is simplistic and even enjoyable if you take it for what it is."
"D) This is an excellent example of this style. The mild alcohol content says ""its okay, have another"""
"Mouthfeel...light, carbonation is fine. Drinkability is high. Good for a dessert, and a pretty good lambic as well."
"It is likely that this beer is filtered and sugar is added to the beer after filtration to emphasize the sweet fruit flavors. Its OK for what it is, not a huge fan of the sweetened lambics, but it definitely makes its points and achieves its goal. It is not likely I'll drink this again anytime soon, maybe if I serve chocolate mousse for dessert sometime."
"Feels like carbonated raspberry juice, and drinks about the same. Not worth the money...mix with vodka I guess? Not recommended."
"D: This is a perfect dessert beer. I had mine after a nice meal and found it more than up to the task. Definitely a style I have to be in the right mood for. But when I am, this is one I'd happily go back to."
"A good once in a while beer. I'm still surprised at how sweet it is. Sorbet beer, I tell ya. Might be good for cooking even, I imagine."
"Drinkability: A fantastic lambic..a touch of sourness to meld with the sweetness. I could sip this all day."
"Pours a clear, ruddy red color. 3/4 inch head of an off-pink color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of strong raspberry, slight tart malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, and yeast. Fits the style of a Lambic - Fruit. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. There is also a slight tartness present. Tastes of strong raspberry, sweet malt, yeast, slight tart malt, and slight earthiness. Overall, a little too sweet, but otherwise still good."
"Pours a clear garnet with a nice thick pink foamy head that leaves minimal lacing behind. The nose, unsurprisingly, is loaded with raspberries, with a touch of oakiness and toffee as garnishes. The taste emphasizes the berries' tart and sour qualities, but does not overdo it as these temper/mellow as things progress. The oak from the nose is there as well, creating a soft boat upon which the berries float across the tongue. The body is a medium-moderate, with a pleasant touch of carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a tasty, tart, fruity lambic with, if one is inclined toward them, high drinkability."
"Notes: Not my favorite style but that did not keep me from giving it a favorable review. If a framboise is what you are looking for then this is a good one."
"The taste of this beer is really very good and I will actually consider buying this again"
"D - This is not my favorite proprietor of the style, but it is always a very good option. I could drink a keg of this."
"Goes down like candy, but should count as beer due to extra sugar. Like a wine cooler. Meh."
"D: I would drink this beer again. However, I couldnt drink to much of it because of how sweet it is."
"Very light beer, but slightly more carbonated than expected, given the head was so small. As far as drinkability, i could go for seconds or thirds of this beer without hesitation."
"Pours a brownish red color that is clear for the most part but has some faint particles if you look close. Very thin spotty lace here and there appears mostly white but has a hue of the brownish-red color to it. Aroma is mostly raspberry sweetness with a bit of funk. Taste is a blast of raspberry that is a mixture of sweet, sour and tart with a little bit of funkiness. Carb is fairly high with a light feel. Lingering taste of the fruit and a bit of creaminess left on the palate. Very easy drinking with a tart finish."
"M&D - smooth and champagne-like in dryness and proper serving, it is quite tasty, and the gf loved it, however i do enjoy the sour element in my framboise's"
"D - This, like most fruity lambics, is very sweet, making it hard to drink a lot of this. Pretty good, especially for the price."
"D-I like the lambic style, especially framboise. This is very good. It is one style I could readily drink at anytime, day, or night."
"Update - I haven't had this in over three years to thought I'd get a bottle and compare it to my original review. Thankfully it hasn't changed a bit."
"Ok, this is just too sweet to drink too much. Not a bad beer and I will order it again, but I'm still unsure I can drink a whole one."
"Mouthfeel is nice and you can drink this all day."
"I've enjoyed this beer quite a few times at Flying Saucer; it is pretty cool that they have this on-tap. Its light, refreshing, and makes for a great capper to an evening of beer."
"D: Low ABV and very drinkable. I like this better than Lindemans and its MUCH cheaper."
"D = This is a drinkable beer. It does not get cloying and is refreshing."
"By the way--that's my photo for this beer! =D"
"D: Great as a session brew. Extremely drinkable, even to non-beer drinkers."
"D. I could drink this all day-no questions asked."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer but it's just not the kind of beer I drink very often."
"D - About average for me it was too sweet for the sour. I am having trouble finishing this 750ml and it is only 4%."
" This has ""session beer"" written all over it! If I was given this blindfolded, I might think that it was a juice that was a bit past it's prime. I could easily see myself drinking a few lambics of this ABV% in a given night, but not more than a bottle of this one in a given sitting. This has a textbook taste and mouthfeel of a lambic, with the easy to drink aspects of a succint raspberry beverage. I'm glad I started my foray into big bottles on this!"
"A second-tier lambic, St. Louis Framboise puts forth a fine example of this style, worthy of a festive breakfast or as an aperitif."
"D : Easily drinkable."
"Pours purplish-amber. You know there is fruit there. Head is light. Aroma is distintly raspberry, though there is an undescribable funk in the finish. Tart, berry. Not subtle, but fun to drink, and light enough that it isn't going to get you soused. Lucious silky mouth. Drink as a refreshing dessert. I enjoy it, but can't imagine drinking two of them. You just wouldn't need to."
"My wife, who doesn't really like real beer, or even many kinds of alcohol in general, loves this and the competing product from Lindeman's. Personally, I prefer the fruit lambics from Cantillon, enjoying their tarter taste. That being said, this isn't quite as sweet as the Lindeman's Framboise, but it is a modern, commercial fruit lambic, so purists likely will scoff. All of that being said, I find the St. Louis fram to be immensely drinkable and just plain fun."
"At least my mom liked it, so we switched and I drank her EKU Pils."
"Absolutely gorgeious in the fluted glass--blood and cranberry red with light white fluffy head on tiop. Strong vinegar-lambic nose of wild yeast. Fruit is strong as well and spectacular, which just follows into the taste--lambic sour witha clear, clear, and balanced fruit--complex with every sip."
"this is a very delicious beer if you are in the mood for such a beer if not in the mood i could see this being very ungood with that said when poored it is a very dark red as i expected with a pink head also expected smells a bit syrupy and a bit like baccardi raz taste is once again good if you are in the mood all around a very drinkable beer easily the best i have had this year"
"Absolutely delicious. Definitely a dessert drink.. and by that I mean, a drink you have in place of dessert! It was so fresh and tastey.. I had to have three glasses! The aroma of raspberries is overwhelming, and the taste will knock your socks off. Worth a try, as I think it may be one of the best in it's category."
"This one is the only framboise lambic I've tried other than Lindeman's which I enjoyed much more. This is ok, but nothin' special. I would reach for Lindemann's over this."
"*Note while this beer was good it had no distinct qualitied that set itself apart from say Lindeman's Lambic Framboise."
"Drinks like a sweet mixed drink, but a REALLY good one. Some might think it's just a sweet lambic, but it does have more going for it than just a sweet outside. Plus it's darn tasty on a hot summer day, but I think it would also go quite well on a cool winter night. (Possibly in front of a fire....some music...yeah...)"
"This is one of the bettered sweetened framboises I've had, but it's still disappointing. It's my first St. Louis lambic, and I didn't know until opening it if it was a traditional lambic or a modern commercial one."
"Well worth the price, as this is not sold where I live. An absolutely delicous lambic. Wonderfully tart & sweet at the same time, but keeps an excellent balance, not tipping one way or the other. Light but not wimpy, absolutely refreshing. I could drink this stuff like it was juice. And I do. Liquid candy."
"Not recommended."
"Had this on-tap at Roman's Pub. It certainly has an interesting appearance; whether it's good or not depends on if you think cough syrup is attractive. It was capped by a very pink head that reminded me, morbidly, of the bloody froth that comes from people's mouths after a lung injury. Smells and tastes almost of straight raspberry, with a slight hint of a perfumy, floralness. You might think you were drinking pleasantly carbonated raspberry juice. It was so fruity that my girlfriend had to move on to ""something more beery"" after the first glass, which wasn't even a regular glass, maybe 8 oz. Basically, if you like raspberries, you will like this beer; otherwise, you will probably get sick to your stomach. Hell, you might get sick anyway, even if you do like raspberries."
"""Like soda pop!"" said someone (with zero familiarity with the lambic style)who sampled this with me. Yeah, yeah...it is a commercial lambic, of that there is no doubt, but it makes for adequate dessert sipping, and isn't really bad at all."
