"This might be the tartest (most acidic) beer I've ever had. Typical Upland sour. My wife and I split the bottle. As we got to the bottom of the bottle it felt like our mouths were blistering."
""
"Was crazy excited after the pour, which was beautiful, thinking the color suggested some serious fruit flavors, but they're just not forward enough. It's a very good lambic with a hint of blackberry."

"Bottled 5/15/14 from trade, poured on 11/30/14. Pours beautiful deep reddish purple with a pink fizzy head in my Cantillon glass. Awesome aroma of big lush blackberry, lots of vinegar and funk, oak, sour. Flavor is big fruity blackberries, sharp sourness, some vinegar notes, oak, dry but not super dry, definite jamminess here. Light to medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, juicy berries yet dry finish. Whoah. This is really excellent. Have heard it is overly sour but I'm not getting that at all. This is just right and on par with some of the best sours I've had, including fruited Cantillon."

"Split amongst family to celebrate the birth of my sister's first child. Nice blackberry notes but, like previous Uplandic experiences, the vinegar and sour serve to minimize rather than compliment the fruit."

" The taste of this wild ale is acidic at first with juicy and tangy fruit flavor of the berry with a mild spice-like flavor and woody almost balsamic taste of acidity and woody tannin with a very dry yeast flavor in the finish. Overall I think this is a wonderful american wild ale with blackberry...not extremely sour and very drinkable with a lot of fruit flavor."

"Overall- It's good, but not great. And its only good if you like sourness to overpower the fruit and funk that should be present in spades in any lambic. This is the last Upland sour I'm going after, and I really can't recommend trying more than a few- Sour Reserve is the only one I'd recommend going for, really."

"Mouth med to a little lighter bod, nice carb, tart little flemmy and acidic."

"Too wild and unbalanced. Uses Belgian yeast but doesn't match typical Belgian quality."

"Great flavors, but the tartness is overpowering."
""
"Really lovely pink/magenta color with lots of white head/bubbles. The smell jumped out of the bottle immediately. It was a yogurt/funk mix that was pretty overpowering. The taste was described as sour patch kid meets shock tart. Not a lactic sour like the nose led you to believe. It is an intense puckering sour that isn't for folks who get indigestion. The mouthfeel was very effervescent and quite nice. Overall, I want more fruit flavor for the price point and the hunt. The extreme tartness mellowed a bit as the day went on, but it just wasn't a top notch sour for me."
""
""
""
""
"O - this is the perfect level of sourness/tartness for my tastes. Not nearly as sour as the kiwi but just enough. The blackberry isn't overly distinguishable but it's clear that this is a fruited sour. Very nice."
"Pours a reddish clear with white ring of head. Smell is straight vinegar and acid with notes of berry mixed in. Pungent notes of earth and berry are present along side the sourness. The taste is enamel removing sour with dashes of berry which seem to add to the overall acidic notes. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with and effervescent feel. Overall, this is one fine sour. It lacks the restraint and the delicate showing that VSB so excellently does, but it does deliver in the face puckering sour department."

"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, bubbly and dry on the tongue. Another fruit lambic hit from Upland - I've yet to find one I didn't enjoy."
"Fantastic. One of my absolute favorite American sours. Terrific."

"Finally got to try one of the highly regarded Upland lambics. Definitely worth seeking out. This was an older vintage (2006) and there was still so much more development that could occur. Great lambic."
"Decanted into a #properglassware Upland goblet/tulip. Bubbles rose to the mouth of the bottle and some of the beer started to seep out, but I'd hardly call this a gusher. Poured a dark purplish-brown color, lively carbonation, with about an inch of rocky off-white head, loaded with chunky bits of blackberry. All right! Sour fruits in the nose, blackberry, apple, a little acetic and lactic. The first thing that jumped out at me was the carbonation. It seemed way too high, and almost made this more soda-like than beer-like. Blackberry was the main player in the flavor department, as would be guessed, tart and tangy, though not overly puckering, lactic, drying. One-dimensional, but what else would you expect from this particular beer? Not a complaint, just an observation. Mouthfeel was light and spritzy, and I feel it lost a bit by being too carbonated, but overall that was just a minor setback. It was a nice beer, and quite enjoyable overall."

"O-More tart than sour, the blackberries are perfect; they provide great flavor without making the beer too sweet."
"O: A tough flavor to impart but this was delicious. Probably best not to age this one as long as I think it would have been much better when the fruit was brighter."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into the sampler glass from the bottle, the beer was a ruby reddish hue with a nice tinted white head. The aroma smelled of sour fruits with a variety of berry notes observable. In the initial taste, one notes this is incredibly sour. While I was able to enjoy it, I almost thought it was too sour. As it moves to the aftertaste, it becomes progressively more tart and acidic. I had difficulty appreciating blackberries, since I believe them to be sweeter than they are here. The aftertaste further displays quite a bit of natural seedy blackberry flavor. It is easy to tell his is made with real berries."
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a mild level of carbonation that visually seems missing but is felt tingly enough in the mouth to keep it lively feeling. This is a fairly easy drinking brew with seemingly no alcohol impact. However, the acidic nature started to get to me and I could not see myself drinking a significant amount of this by myself. This is one to be shared, much appreciation for the share Heath, glad to get to try it."
"Definitely one of the better fruited lambics. I put it only behind Kiwi. Slightly better when fresh. Although a lot of that jammy goodness was still here, vinegar has started to take over a bit more now. I loved the sourness in the flavor although drinkability is a bit low. I was reaching for the tums after splitting a bottle as my stomach was not agreeing with my taste buds about the deliciousness of this."
""
""
""
""
"Even though it's not as flavorfully complex as many of the standard Belgian examples, Upland still does better than a stand-up job with this beer. Excellent representation of the fruit and the funk, and with a commanding tartness that never goes over-the-top. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O - Solid lambic that is more tart and vinegary than fruity. This is a good one but nothing great. However, definitely worth a try if you can get ahold of one. I do wish it was a bit fruiter instead of so much overpowering vinegar since it's a fruit lambic"

"Not my favorite Upland Lambic, but certainly a beer I loved. They knock it out of the park each time, but I'd take peach or raspberry over this. 4.5"
""
""
""
"O: I like this, but this is definitely a sipper and not a beginner's sour beer. As it warms, the acidity diminishes somewhat which allows the sweetness to come through. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this."
"Overall a very good lambic but by no means the best from Upland or anywhere close to the best Berry fruited one. Upland seems to do a much better job with their lighter fruited lambics than the darker berried ones from my experience."
""
""
""
"This batch is light, effervescent, and all-around excellent. Very glad I have a second bottle stashed away. Well worth the cost and I can't wait for Upland to have the devoted sour space up and running soon."
""
""

"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dark blue color lambic with a large off-blue color head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of strong blackberry notes with some light funky notes and some tart notes also discernable. Taste is a mix between some tart blackberry notes with some notes funky barnyard notes and a sour finish. Body is full with limited filtration and great carbonation. This one is well balance with great notes of blackberry. This is one brewery that I never know what to expect but in this particular case it is a real winner. Easy to drink with huge amount of complexity."

"Dark purple with a decent amount of lavender head. Full on black berries. Good amount of tart lactic sour. Flavor is delicious. Sweet and sour black berries. Just a touch of funk. Lively carbonation. I absolutely loved this beer. It was a turning point for the Upland lambic series in my eyes. One of there best efforts."

"Taste is all berries and tart but its well balanced and very drinkable. Mouhfewl is really creamy and mellow. With a crisp fruity finish."

"Overall: Trying more and more sours lately. Upland is really awesome! I enjoy this sour beer because its a great blend of sour funkiness and fruity flavors. I have tried this beer on 2 seperate occasions and continue to enjoy it. Upland does a top notch job on this beer style for sure!"
"D/O- very nice. Great introduction to Upland Lambics. Would loveto try the other variations to compare. Thanks Brian!"
"4.0 D: Another solid addition to the lambic lineup. Good overall, but it doesn't stand out in any area. Interesting note: I change some of the scores after my second glass. For whatever reason, the second glass was much better."
"D - I always enjoy winey, spritzy lambics and saisons, this was great but I doubt I could drink a lot of it."
"Drink- Another beer I was very glad to try at CF#6. This was nice new taste and well balanced between sweet and tart. I would love to try more of the varieties."
"(D)- Easily my favorite of the Uplands I have had thus far. Sour, yet a nice fruit profile too. This bottle did not last long at all!"
"The fruit is very prominent in this Upland offering and although simple, it packs a big, flavorful punch. A solid and very unique take on the lambic style."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! A gusher! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured ruby red with a half finger pinkish head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, blackberry, slight sour, and slight tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, blackberry, bitter blackberry seeds, and slight sour. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was quite good to say the least. The flavor really only had one flaw in that the blackberry seed flavor was very apparent throughout and left a bitter taste on your palate after each sip. While it wasn't bad, it was still not pleasurable. Definitely worth trying given the chance."
"The aroma of berry funk with a hint of crust that smells delicious. The appearance is rich pinot wine color with a white head and tons of berry sediment floating on top. Flavors of sour funk berry lambic on a bubbly smooth body with tart smoothness to end."
"An American lambic, and a new classic.SilverX's bottle. Grape coloured body with a great foamy pinkish head. Tart, a little acidic, funky. Great drinkability, aboe average mouthfeel as lots of real blackberry sediment in here, seeds in my glass. A power shake, lunch, a great bottle to share."
"O - I actually liked this one a bit, blackberry flavor is good, and it's pleasant and easy to drink. Wouldn't mind another bottle or two."
"O - A solid refreshing lambic but needs more sour/tart notes. Very easy to drink but nothing Earth-shattering about this beer. Decent, but not the best work they've done."
"Would be better if it was a little more bretty and had that barnyard funk to it. Currently tart fruit dominant in both the nose and taste. Might be drinking a tad too sweet right now but a little age would do it good."
"Overall, a good attempt at a traditional lambic but I feel like it was lacking in aroma and funk. But still, a good beer. I say drink it fresh because the fruit flavors are just going to fade, which are the focus of this beer."
"O: Excellent flavor with great incorporation of the blackberries."
"Very good offering from uplands."
"The beer is a plum shade of purple with a pink head that disappears quickly, leaving very little lacing behind. The aroma brings a delightful funk and a almost reminiscent of blackberry pie. Taste is not what I expected compared to other Upland Lambics I've had. Its got a perfectly balanced fresh not ripe enough blackberry tartness. Not overly tart, slight sweetness. Just like a sour blackberry pie in liquid form. Mouth feel and finish are refreshing, light watery syrup."
"Bottle exploded when opened, lost a good amount to the ground. Enough left for 4 sample pours with family on memorial day. Pretty huge bummer to lose about half the bottle, at least I opened it indoors. Beer was a pinkish purpleish reddish. Lots of head at first with almost berry look to it. Stinks like berry fruitpunch. Taste is much of the same but lots of tart to it, almost too much. Carbonation isn't overboard, but iy is a bit tart in the mouth. Thick and filling. Pretty annoyed anbout the guyser when I opened the bottle. Didn't blow me away, it is a good brew, probably would've like it a lot more if more than half didn't go to waste."
"D-Overall this was way more enjoyable than my first upland lambic. Managed to not spill 3/4 of this one down the drain. Has a nice blackberrie flavor to it but not to overpowering and not too sour. Really liked the little pieces of blackberry that were in the glass too."
"I seem to like Upland fruit lambics more than the norm. I do not compare them to the amazing lambic breweries like Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen, but rather appreciate Upland's beers as delicious American fruit lambics modeled after the traditional Belgian greats mentioned above."
"o - Overall one of the better Upland lambics I've had so far. Like the overs not overly sour, but still very enjoyable. Would like to have again."
"Gushed from a 750 ml bottle in to a Boulevard brewing tasting glass. A light bubbly head formed pretty quickly and was gone just as quick. The aroma was interesting on this particular lambic as it was not bursting with to much funk. The funk was there mixed with the blackberry's which were in the background. I have been on a Lambic tasting spree and have to say I have thourghly enjoyed taste of the Cherry and Blackberry form this brewery. The acidic bite and flavor was there but extremly minimal for me as the funk and blackberry were in the front row. The blackbery and sourness were dull and mixed very well. The body of this brew did not destroy my mouth which I appreciated being at a tasting. I had early decided not to go through with a BA muleing for me on this release but will in the future."
"The mouthfeel was on the thinner side with carbonation being high. Overall it was a pretty nice beer, but I didn't like it as much as the cherry version. It did show some nice, subtle fruit character while also having some bold sour and tart flavors to it though. Pretty nice beer overall."
"*It should be noted that the BA who brought this to our tasting session contacted Upland's and told them of the two gushing bottles we opened on the 7th. After hearing our story, Upland's kindly offered to replace the bottles."
"M/D: Not crazy carbonated like some of them, Very smooth and very drinkable. This is personally my favorite in the Lambic series, I think they are moving in the right direction with every batch. This is the first one that I am willing to buy multiple bottles of in the same batch."
"Pretty darn good if you like blackberries. It really feels wild in a way suitable for berry-based American wilds - from the tart/sweet blackberry to the earthy, dirty funk. A nice showing."
"Overall: This is probably the best upland I have tried, either blackberry is their best offering or they are improving with each batch - it could be some of both."
"The pour is absolutely beautiful with a great bright, deep purple color. Really gorgeous. Pink-hued head is light and bubbly, sticking around for a bit. The nose brings forward plenty of blackberry character along with a little bit of funk and light acidity. The taste is along the same lines and reminds me of the Blueberry Lambic in that regard. It's currently really fruit-forward, but I don't like the berry flavor as much in this one. On the other hand, it does have some funk and acidity. There is really a lot of fruit in this right now and I think it has the makings of a really nice beer, it just needs some time to develop. Body is light with good carbonation. A solid brew and I'm looking forward to seeing how it ages."
"Overall this is a decent beer and middle of the road in terms of upland lambics. I find Upland lambics very hit or miss but applaud the experimentation of the different fruits."
"3.5/4.5/4.5/3.5/4.5"
"D: A really easy to drink sour beer and quite nice all around. I wish I could have had this one fresher to get the full effect of the fruit, but still quite nice."
"The flavor opens lightly tart with blackberry skins and a strong wood quality. It's lactic and tannic with a low acidity and a nice fruit presence. The mouthfeel is dry and lightly tannic. I was pleasantly surprised by this."
"Drinkability is moderate and mouthfeel is good. Carbonation is throughout the mouth carrying the sour to tart. Overall the beer is OK, I'd be interested in trying other lambics from the this brewery."
"A 750ml bottle. Thanks to mymrnngjckt for sharing. Uncapped and poured into my snifter. The lambic appears a hazed deep crimson amber color with about a finger of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of tart blackberries, a bit acidic, oak, some funk, light vinegar, musty, hay. Decent medium body with adequate carbonation and a dry, tart finish. Pretty nice."
"I had never tried an American made blackberry lambic until this one. The colour was an amber-orange with little head. The aroma was highly acetic with some general berry fragrance. On the palate, there was a burst of bubbles, a quick shot of blackberry, then vinegar. The finish was rather quick."
"NOTE: the scores for aroma and taste should both be about 4.20, but i felt this was the best way to balance them."
"D - Not as complex or even fruity as I expected, but its not a bad lambic. I certainly didn't want anything lindeman's-esque, but some more blackberry flavor and aroma would have been nice. Hopefully Upland will keep improving this one over the next couple years till they really nail it. ABV seems low and very manageable, although the tartness can be a bit much after more than a glass of this beer."
"Drinkability: Low abv and quite tasty, but acidic and tart so it depends on how much you like lambics. If you do, seek this one out!"
"Drinkability: Okay, okay, so maybe it's not the most authentic, true-to-style fruit lambic out there, but, come on, it's very tasty, very drinkable, and really, who wouldn't take this over a Chapeau lambic any day of the week?"
"A fantastic lambic style beer that doesn't seem to resemble blackberries in the least to me. Strawberry is what I'd believe if you told me. Since I love strawberries this is great. If you're looking for sweetness forget this beer. If you like sour then this is amazing. Reminds me of sour patch kids, balanced with a vinegar sour and sweetness, but no flavor overpowers any other except maybe the sour. Highly recommended for any beer or wine drinker or someone you're looking to convert to sours."
"Overall I am floored. After being underwhelmed by the entire series here, this one was a sure winner. Finally some semblance of the fruit flavor was left, and it was brilliant. I think I really enjoy the style more fresh as the Cantillon I had last week would be evidence of. If I were to recommend anything from the series this one is it."
"D: Not really. Have not been real impressed with the Upland sours. They need to bring more fruit to the bottle on the next go around."
"Just the smell of the cork previews the lovely tartness to come. Three fingers of biscuity light tan head sits on a murky apple cider brown body that is cloudy from the yeast sediment. Nose is tart and sharply acidic almost making you pucker. The wet yeast is there with apple skin and white vinegar. The vinegar comes through slightly at first on the front of the tongue. A layer of barnyard funk lays on the mouth like a blanket. The sour feel is nice, consistent and well balanced throughout, but you really hunt for the fruit to come through. Yeasty on the finish with a bit of thickness that comes through. Well done lambic and nicely drinkable."
"D: Damn good. Could be more sour for sure but a great start."
"Pours a simply beautiful copper/red color with almost no head whatsoever. Smells mostly Brett with the funk eating and eliminating almost all of the blackberries. First sip is all Brett that perfectly compliments what is left of the sweetness. This is what sours are all about. It puckers the lips to perfection and feels simply wonderful on the tongue. Tartness rules!"
"I'd say this beer is a very decent, American made, representation of the style, and I can see this one aging well for some time."
"D: All day. I think this is my first real American lambic. I must say I was impressed by this beer. Hopefully more will be made. The one thing I do not get is how this bottle costs the same as those imported from Europe. Great beer though."
"Might improve as it clearly has compared to other reviews."
"This was a nice treat - good to see the US producing quality lambics (even if they're challenging to procure). I totally want to try out the other flavors now!"
"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle and served in a tumbler. This beer poured a clear, red-tinged orange hue with a one-finger thin head of off-white foam that slightly lasted. A small amount of slippery lacing was left around the glass. The aroma included sweetened berries, wet hay, oak, and a faint sourness. The flavor was also lightly sour, and fruity sweet. Just enough acidity to cut through the sweetness. A hint of oak and clean wheat are also present. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had moderate carbonation. Crisp and aggressive on the tongue. This was by far the best carbonation out of all the Upland lambics I have tried. All in all, another solid beer. Not the funkiest, or most interesting lambic, but still enjoyable."
"D: Enjoyable in small amounts, the acidity is a bit more than I'd like."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Up front berry flavor, light on the sourness but not sweet either. Balsamic vinegar flavors are pretty prevalent, and I could see the acetic acid doing some bad things to the stomach if large quantities of this were consumed. Fairly simple and straightforward on the whole, very light on the funk and a bit too heavy on the acetic acid. The finish is semi-dry, leaving a trace of berry-like sweetness on the back of the tongue."
"750ml bottle, it bubbled through the cork when I pried off the cap. nice orange-red-pinkish color. Nice fruity, funky, sour smell, butter? The flavor is quite interesting, some fruitiness a hint of sour but barely and a strange buttery flavor. Carbonation is fine and this is easy to drink but this isn't as good as the strawberry or cherry upland lambics."
"I believe I got these in trade with Travisd13, but I may be wrong- I lost my notes on this one. In any case, I love lambics and for that matter blackberries and I'm very interested in trying this. Pours a reddish brown, maybe even with a splash of purple somewhere in the depths, or is that my imagination? Capped and corked bottle opens with a pop and there is plenty off carbonation but no spewing and the head is slight. Somewhat murky with sediment, and there is a lot of yeasty gunk in the bottom of the bottle. Smells nicly sour with just the barest hint of sweetness, a bit of briney creaminesss, and some acidic blackberry aromas. No real funk, but clean, tart, and nice. The taste has more blackberry up front and a lingering sourness, and more of that creamy salinity that adds a savor to the whole package, but still no real funk. It drops away a bit after the initial hit of sour and becomes more tart and fizzy than sour. The blacberry is restrained, but more noticeable than in the aroma. Quite fizzy and fairly soft in the mouth but with a nice lingering tartness. I like this quite a bit, but I'd like to see it again in a few years and see what it's done."
"D_An interesting take on the style. Fairly well balanced in its sour and sweet tones it also manages to be fairly nuanced as well. It lacks the funk of some of the great Belgian examples though which I would like. The overall prodcut however is quite tasty and is perhaps a different animal all together"
"Very good beer."
"Taste is pretty much right on point. Berries come through slightly stronger in flavor, but this is mostly a tart, vinegary, earthy, oaky beer. Enjoyed it quite a bit. Mouthfeel is lively and well carbonated."
"Notes from and tasted on 7/21/08"
"Not the best appearance on these lambics. Bright orange color and the heads of these lambics never take on any of the color from the fruit. Sour blackberry aromaFlavor has a nice balance of mostly sweet, but also sour elements. Pie-like, with notes of vanilla, cream, as well as some fairly authentic blackberry notes. Really nice ale."
"Tonight is a special night, so why not try a special beer. Pours a cloudy light pinkish red with a thin off- white head. Aroma of tart blackberries, a touch of wood, and a bit of funk. Begins sweet, finishes tart. Acidic. A very nice example of a fruit lambic. Thanks Josh."
"Paired with a cheese plate of Morbier, Cowgirl Creamery Mt. Tam triple-cream, and Jasper Hill's Constant Bliss. The Lambic went best with the buttery triple cream, and the raw cow's milk Constant Bliss, cutting through the light saltiness and creamy texture."
"This was the first of the Upland lambics I have tried, it was pretty darn good and quite tart already for being so young, I originally expected a much sweeter and fruitier beer but was pleasantly surprised, first blackberry lambic I can remember having too, hope to drink again in upcoming years, recommended"
"This is much better than I anticipated, though it is not really a Lambic in character; it has a much softer sourness and does not have the complexity & funkiness of a well made Lambic (in fact that is the glaring flaw here, it really needs some Brett character to be a great example of a Lambic). This is definitely quite tasty and drinkable and the fruit expression is almost perfect right now; any more and it could get cloying, les and it wouldn't have the requisite fruit levels."
"Drinkability- I've been super excited to try these for about the last couple months and I wasn't let down in the least! The first couple drinks are pretty intense but as you acclimate yourself it's terribly drinkable. Cool to know that such great Belgian Style sours are being created right here in the heart of America (take that Cali!). Big thanks again to Matt for his generosity!"
"Had this one with all the others last night and this was one of the better ones. Lots of flavor and a very nice pleasant oak presence. The after taste was a treat leaving a very pleasant almost barn yard effect on the palette. Blueberry flavor and the oak barrel blended nicely to give this beer great flavor and exceptionally pleasant treat ..If you're after the Upland Lambic this one is one worth seeking out. I'm going to age one of these in the celler and try it again in a year or 2..MMMHHH I guraentee ya it's going to only get better as the Brett does it's thing!"
"Not as colorful as most lambics I've tried, this still has a nice copper belgian ale appearance, with a nice hit of carbonation. Smells good, like a nice belgian ale, but again, not as fruity as I expected. Nice taste, a great mix of ale with a nice hit of blackberry, with a bit of cask aging. Goes down nice and smooth, with a bit of pop from the carbonation. This seems more like a blackberry wine in a lot of aspects, such as taste and smell, but is worth it if you can find it. An excellent lambic that felt like a cross between a fruit champagne and ale (in a good sense). It's only out for a short time, so get it while you can, but be prepared for the rubbery cork to be a bit of a pain."
