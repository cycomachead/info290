3.75,2.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style and it seemed to be inline with the other lambics from Lindemans with this one showcasing apples and I think it does a good job of it and it makes for a good dessert beer.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little refreshing, clean, a little crisp, a little sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but I think half a small bottle is the perfect amount for me.  What I like the most about this beer was how well the apple was showcased.  What I like the least about this beer was that the funky yeast didn't show up in the taste like it did in the aroma.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a nice dessert beer and I would recommend it trying it, especially if you like apple beers and dessert beers.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I think the sweetness and lack of complexity held it back a little, but in the end I did enjoy it for what it is.  It's not a favorite Lindemans beer and it's a little above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a tasty apple lambic, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 01, 2015"
3.78,3.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/9/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lightly tart green apple, pear, white grape, hay, grass, candi sugar, light honey, slight funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of apples, pale malt, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of tart green apple, pear, white grape, hay, grass, candi sugar, light honey, slight funk, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, candi sugar, light honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of apples, pale malt, and fruit yeast flavors; with a good sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is a very good sweetened fruit lambic style. All around good robustness and balance of apples, pale malt, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. This is more pleasantly flavored than the other variants, but still a nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 28, 2015"

Aromas of apple tart and sweet, with some subtle grassy highlights. Flavors are more richly sweet than the nose leads you to believe, with a tart, candy-like apple sweetness blended with hints of a roasted apple sweetness. Light, crisp, and effervescent in mouth, the beer has a tangy sweet aftertaste. Light, crisp finish with a subtle tartness lingering behind.","GarthDanielson","Jun 26, 2013"

Towards the bottom of the bottle were numerous floating particles as well. The nose is, not surprisingly, apples with some brown sugar as well. The taste is very sweet, almost like hard cider with the apple being the dominant flavor. Although this has a one-dimensional approach at first sip, the beer's complexity becomes apparent at times, hints of sourness especially. Overall, a good beer that will definitely turn some off with its pungent apple taste but once you get past that, there is much to enjoy.","biteme398","Feb 15, 2013"

When poured, the head was a beautiful and fluffy white with the color of the beer being a cloudy amber, similar to the color or apple juice but without the clarity. It was tart and crisp, sour with the pleasant tastes of the wild yeast very much in the background and subdued. The carbonation was very appropriate; not overly or under. Medium thin mouthfeel. Lindemans pomme lambic was enjoyable and easy to drink; it's a great ""celebration"" beer that can easily be used in place of a Asti champagne.","Aaron_Ramson","Dec 27, 2012"

Taste is a fairly clean and tart green apple and truly it's like you just bit into a fresh one. It's not nearly as sweet as I anticipated and for that reason it stands completely opposite the last apple beer I tried which was more like apple pie.

The taste is kind of what I expected, its got a load of nice granny smith apple sourness which I like, followed by loads of sweetness, this is far closer to an apple cider than a beer. Overall an okay beer, not something I would normally get, perhaps a good dessert beer. None of these fruit Lindemans are my type of drink and if I had to choose one I prefer the frambrosie or the kriek over this.","DavidST","Aug 02, 2011"

Beer was WAY too sweet for a lambic but didn't mind it. A very 1 sided beer with no real complexity and this concludes that this should be a ""Fruit Beer"" and not a ""Lambic w/ Added Fruit"".

It's also along the same lines as the Jolly Ranchers. It's a little too sweet. My girlfriend says it's not even close to the Peche. It drinks light but a little sticky, from far too much sugar. The flavor doesn't really linger too long. Overall it isn't Lindemans best effort but it's drinkable. It's a little sweet but it's ok.","aasher","Jun 16, 2011"

The taste reminds me of apple champagne, if they made apple champagne from artificial apple flavoring. The most notable aspect was the slightly sour/bitter taste that was somewhat tricky to detect. I would have almost missed it if I hadn't been analyzing the flavors. The small alcohol presence came through and tasted like an American Adjunct-type flavor.

The taste continues this sweet tradition, with a combination of green apples and white grape-peach juice. Tasty, despite the sweetness.

They are making an approachable sweet fruit beer than is very non-offensive and gives any alcopop a run for it's money. i don't know whether to grade it on what I think a lambic should taste like or what Lindemans were trying to achieve with this beer.

Its an apple beer and it does not fail to deliver apples. Goes down easy, a very good beer IMO. I need to research lambics more to see if its a good example of a lambic.

It gets more tolerable as times goes on, as is typical with Lindemans brew. But really. Eck. You might as well put this in a bottle and let your kid drink it as apple juice, if it weren't for the alcohol in it.

The flavor is somewhat more beer-like, with light wheaty grain barely surfacing under the omnipresent green apple Jolly Rancher syrup. Nicely effervescent though, with a soft, fuller texture. Not a whole lot going on aside from the apple. With the malt, it comes across as one of those $1 apple pies you find in the gas station. The definition of the word cloying. Some faint lambic sourness, but not much to make note of. Really, half a bottle was more than enough for me, and it took me a while to get through just that.

Nice enough, but I find it hard to acknowledge that I am even writing a ""beer"" review for this alcopop. Shockingly predictable, just as I imagined.","TheLongBeachBum","Aug 12, 2006"
4.14,13.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"As if this beer isn't good enough from the bottle. Even smoother, richer, and cleaner from the tap. Very cider-like with apples and berries under a very sugar sweet maltiness and added apples. Very tart and acidic, evident in aroma and flavor. Vigorously carbonated for a playfull effect in the mouth. Astringent feeling, but not overly so. Finishes with a big apple flavor, syrupy sweetness and carbonated dryness and tartness. Sweet almost to the point where it hurts the teeth. Though I love the beer, the sweetness and apples over-take what would be pronounced Belgian Beer flavor.","BEERchitect","Aug 08, 2006"
4.32,18,4,4.5,4,4,5,"This beer is very one-dimentional but it's simple and right-to-the-point. It could be a huge hit for the non-beeries. The sheer simplicity, along with the enjoyability, made it rank high for me. I would much rather have a complex, traditional lambic, but this one still makes for a great drink.","rayjay","Aug 07, 2006"

4.44,21.3,4,5,4.5,4,4,"This is absolutely wonderful!! This may, in fact, replace the framboise as my favourite offering from lindemans. Poured a cloudy golden orange with a thick soapy foamy head. Tons of carbonation bubbles both streaming upward and clinging to the sides of the glass. I'm typically not a big fan of carbonation of this level in my beer, but for this style, the more the better, I say. The smell is almost candy like. Sweet green apple is about all you're going to get from this one. The taste is quite sweet with tart green apple dominating. Nearly un-noticeable level of malt at the very end. You really have to be searching for it. Mouthfeel is very pleasant with a nice moderate carbonation sting to it. I almost wouldn't even consider this beer; mildly alcoholic apple soda is more like it. Nevertheless, I completely enjoyed it and will certainly buy this one again.","SilentSabre","Jul 30, 2006"
3.83,4.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle, 9 oz sample. This brew pours a deep straw color with a web-like foam over top. This one is modestly hazy, with no carbonation apparent. This one reminds me a lot of apple juice in the way it looks. The aroma from this one is definately unmistakable apple. It is somewhere between a nice apple cider and the apple jolly rancher candies; slightly real, but somewhat artifically sweet. At least you can't say it lives up the the promise of apple. The flavor is not as sweet as expected. It is definately focused on the sweetness of the apple, but as I swallow the beer, I get just a hint of funkyness and sour, more than I have in any other Lindeman's product. Aftertaste is slightly wheaty. Mouthfeel is on the light side of moderate, with a very light carbonation just working its way out of sulution as it hits my tongue. I enjoy the light zing of sour and tartness, if from either the apple or the beasties used for fermentation, as it lends distant thoughts of other lambics that I enjoy more. Overall, this one is tasty and very easy to drink. It is over done on the sweetness, but it also has very faint wispers of what it could be, so that makes me happy.","kmpitz2","Jul 24, 2006"
3.62,-1.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This isn't a bad brew, but it was a let down for me as the apple flavoring tastes more like candy than a fruit. With that said, there are still so few apple brews that I have to recommend it. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, too!","Domingo","Jul 23, 2006"
3.92,7.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy apricot body with a small offwhite head. Attractive lacing drapes the goblet in sheets. Aroma is greenapple bubblegum and apple cider. A hint of spices. Mouthfeel is light medium with soft carbonation. Taste is greenapple bubblegum and apple cider. A touch of wild yeast acidity. Slight mustiness, befitting a lambic. A hint of spiciness that seems to be cloves. A decent fruit lambic, but not my favorite even from this brewery.","merlin48","Jul 23, 2006"

4.19,14.5,4,5,4,3.5,4,"Pomme. It's a good thing. The best thing about this beer is the aroma. Like the other Lindemans offerings it's like smelling a big bowl of fresh (apples, raspberries, cherries, peaches). The aroma makes my mouth water. I definitely like the green apple characteristics of this beer. The sour flavor matches very nicely with the sourness of the Lambic base. For my money this is the least sugary sweet of the Lindeman's fruit beers. Worth seeking it out.","tozerm","Jul 20, 2006"

3.52,-3.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability- Because of it's sugar content and extreme sweetness, I found this really hard to finish 12 oz or so. There is no way I would have been able to consume the whole bottle. No very highly drinkable, but could work as an afterdinner drink to share at a party with a dessert or something. About 6oz is enough for me.","GClarkage","Jul 12, 2006"
3.5,-4.4,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Very one dimensional with the thick flavors of sour green apple but you can't expect this to be a big, complex lambic. Very sweet, yet refreshing. The one problem is a lack of carbonation, and a little light on acidity. Those two components really hurt the mouthfeel. The sweetness makes this one difficult to drink many but a good refresher.","mcallister","Jul 01, 2006"
4.22,15.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! I'm a huge green apple fan and this really hits the spot. It's intense and refreshing; very nice. The taste is good. It has a nice green apple flavor that is mildly tart and full of fruit flavor. It goes down like candy and really satisfies. This is one delicious beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is another great offering from this brewery. I'm not a fan of the less fruit, more sour lambics. This one is highly drinkable and very enjoyable.","WesWes","Jun 29, 2006"

3.05,-16.7,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Yellowish color, a little dull in luster. Thin flat-lying head in a chalice. Laces are thin with scant minimal strings. Highly sweetened but distinct apple aromas, lives in a candy-ish sour ball realm. Light and carbonated mouthfeel. Certainly puts some apple into the Pomme appelation as far as the flavor profile, not as earthy as it should be, but definitely more defined than you find in something like Unibroue Ephemere. Nevertheless, it seems a little bit plastic and on the artificial side, at the same time that its ""busting out all over"". Interesting slide into a chalky almost oaky wrap-up. Can't say that its really a beer that meets a lot of things I look for in the many styles that are available in the world today.","ADR","Jun 02, 2006"
3.22,-12,4,2,3.5,3,4,"worth a try in the way that it is different from such fruit-overpowering products like the framboise and the peche, but still cannot hold a candle to the cuvee rene... or even the gueuze. $5 wasted and this beer sampled.. i don't feel like a total ass, but my money could have been spent more wisely.","goodbyeohio","May 29, 2006"

3.82,4.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is an odd one. It tastes and smells artificial, like green apple candy. There's some lambic character beneath, but the apple flavor dominates. I can't imagine it's real, and that's hard to say as it comes from Lindemans. Hmmmm... I guess I'd have to say I'm disappointed. It's way too sweet and artificial tasting to me. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I wouldn't have more than one, and I don't think I'll ever bother with it again.","NeroFiddled","May 26, 2006"
4.02,9.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This seemed like a good midday nice weather sipper so that's what I did. Pours a light golden with a modest fizzy head. Some lacing rings but not too much. Aroma is strong on the apples. There's a tart acidic element in there but its more sweet and sugary than anything else. I'm getting a small bit of brett or something similar in the backdrop. Taste is dominated by apples. A strong granny smith flavor ensues. There's not really a whole lot else going on. A definite sweetness arises but the tartness of the granny smith flavor with the sugar sweetness seem to work off each other quite well imo. I like the acidity and dryness in the finish. This is refreshing. Very cidery but that's probably expected. I might not be able to drink too many of these or really want another for awhile but I enjoyed this bottle.","granger10","May 24, 2006"
4.2,14.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"My second Lambic. Pours out to a mildly hazed golden yellow color with a small head of white foam. No lace. A medium high level of carbonation. Aromas of apples, sweet malt, sour fruits and some floral notes meet the nose well. Taste is near exceptional; full fruit flavors of apples, lots of sweet candied sugar, yet the sourness factor arises and changes the focus of the palate to the more subtle notes of mild malt and grass. Mouthfeel is smooth and zesty, very refreshing. Drinkability is good. This is a great alternative to many fruity wines and has really opened my mind to the Lambic style of beer. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","May 21, 2006"
2.69,-26.5,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Overall: Given that this is a Lindeman's fruit lambic I expected it to be on the sweet side, but this was too much. I definitely prefer Lindeman's other fruit lambics to this. It's like drinking a sour apple Jolly Rancher.","EPICAC","May 16, 2006"
4.78,30.6,5,4.5,5,4,5,"Last night at the Long Island Beer festival I was hit in the mouth with something awesome, and I'm not talking about one of the 8,000 too many fat dudes with hair gel walking around. If there were a best in show award it would surely belong to Lindemans Pomme Lambic. Pomme Lambic pours out from its bottle like my Platonic ideal of Apple Cider, resting in my small plastic cup with little to no head, but a menacing apple-juice colored body. I asked the man serving me this exceptional delight what the ABV was and he responded ""8%"". Knowing this I smelled the lambic, expecting harsh alcohol fumes, but only receiving apple. First sip, sweet Jesus, I left my frail mortal coil down somewhere in Long Island and ascended into beer heaven, where I'm never drunk and always buzzed, and water fountains dispense Guinness. I am not a lambic conneisseur, and so it is difficult for me to describe this in terms of other lambics. What I can say is that it has a sharp apple-y and refreshing edge, with a super smooth and full body. The slick liquid coated my tongue, and as for aftertaste... there was none to speak of, just apples. Overall, imagine every crappy ""malt alcohol beverage"" you've ever had, take that, pretend it tasted delicious, and combine it with your favorite hard cider. If you find this lambic on sale, buy it, cherish it, never leave, marry it and don't cheat on it, you won't regret it.","CualityC","May 13, 2006"
