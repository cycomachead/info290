"pours with absolutely no head. light carbonation. peachy color. not a ton of funk, and not over the top fruit. just well balanced and well done."
""
"very cantillon-esque in its aggressive tartness, not terribly much funk though. notes of plum skins and slight hint of plum sweetness. a very unique lambic and one that id buy again in a heartbeat"
""
""
""
"Oude Quetsche Tilquin - smell, smoked, dried plums, with a delicate hint of orange, the color of the beer intensive - amber. Taste takes us into the time of Christmas, compote or drying agents as mentioned earlier prunes and oranges, pride. Perfect for the holidays."
""
""
"A balanced brew with a restrained fruit quality."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 6/11/2024. Pours light hazy orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big ripe plum, green apple, lemon, lime, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, plums, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big ripe plum, green apple, lemon, lime, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of ripe plum, green apple, lemon, lime, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, plums, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding fruit lambic style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky yeast, plums, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours a burnt orange hue with a hazy clarity and no head, just a tight band around the shoulders.  Nose expresses tart citrus notes and cork.  Taste follows nose with a light saltiness.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and an easy astringency.  Just an overall solid lambic - maybe not as nuanced as Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen, but quite respectable in its own right."

"I find the plums give this beer a strange combination of funky and tart that doesn't work for me. Not my favorite offering from Tilquin."
""

"O: 4.5 I didn’t really know what to expect with this beer and was pleasantly surprised with it. I thought this might be like a kriek a more plummy flavor, but it’s very different. The flavors and aromas I love in their gueuze are present here with subtle fruity flavors. It’s rare to have a unique beer that this well-balanced."

"This is a very nice Gueuze/Lambic before the plums even come into play.  Once they do, they add a nice, unique twist to the brew. I could use more plum flavor, certainly, but this is a very tasty beer."

"It's a good beer, but not enough different from gueuze tilquin in my opinion and as I recall to warrant a different label and a jacked up cost. I liked the gueuze well enough and liked this well enough for the same reasons (maybe it's a bit tarter?). But the plum, which I had expected to really be the defining characteristic of this beer, was barely present for me, which makes it interesting that some others here got so much plum character while others got so little. This is the second plum beer I've had and the previous one was the same; surely some of the tartness comes from there, but what I was hoping for was more wonderful perfumey plum flavor and didn't get it. It went nicely enough with Thanksgiving dinner regardlesss. Sours aren't cheap, but the price for a 12.7oz bottle of this was nuts - and I didn't notice it until I'd paid for my whole haul. Would not buy again."

"Overall (4.5), a fantastic beer, and while I'm not surprised, given the adeptly done Gueuze Tilquin, the plum adds a fantastic depth to the otherwise classic sour beer. Not too many are doing plum lambics, but based on the taste of this one, perhaps more brewers should be."

"Unexpected low carbonated with a very sour, dry, citric foundation. Underneath the dominant, acidic tartness, refreshing sour notes become recognizable, with a subtle, lovely hint of fermented fruit to it. The fruitiness itself is surprisingly sour, of unripe plums and green apple, which is very soft on tongue, while the brett acidity dries out the palate. Not too fruity, compared to the sour aspect of the beer, a subtle addition. During the finish, acidity reaches its peak, overwhelming the fruit flavor completely, leaving back a slick, tremendous sourness."

"2012 edition, absolutely stunning. some huge quantity of plums in this gives it just a pink shade and isnt overly fruity or sweet, a testament to its maturity. hazy as orange as it is pink. the nose here is tart from the plums, not sweet, almost not ripe or something, with the lactic funk of quality lambic and the oaky maturity of a well blended gueuze. wishing for nothing else, the flavor just explodes for me, the right mix of sour and funk, its weird and open fermented feeling and farmy and all of that, but its also quite puckery, especially in the finish, but it never really gets acidic or churny in the stomach like many others, its balance there is insane. the fruit adds less than expected, maybe a product of age, but it just adds a touch of sweetness and that tartness you get from the skin of the plum. it really is a cool use of fruit, and an expertly made beer. the tilquin gueuze has come to prominence recently given the sour craze we all seem to be on, but this is a level better than the base beer, its incredible really, one of the better fruited sours i have ever encountered. a beer you have to try to believe."
""
"I had this a Borefts 2014. I remember that I was quite excited about the beer. Being used to the strong tartness of Cantillon brews, I was surprised to get this nose of quite typical geuze flavors, but more retrained than usually and combined with the scent of sweet plums. The beer tastes tart enough to qualify for the honorary title of ""Oude"" but with the fruitiness comes along pretty harmonic and drinkable. Like it!"

"Bottle from Cave la Bulles in Paris. Poured in my hotel room in Bruges. Pours murky orange color with a small white head that recedes quickly. Big time aroma of apricots, sweet plums I guess, and lots of funk here, wheat malt, tartness. Flavor follows with a sweet punch of apricot and plum, sourness, sweet wheaty malts, juicy, not as dry as expected. Finish is long and puckering with some oaky dryness, medium bodied with medium plus carbonation. Very nice but I think I liked the Gueuze better. Perhaps this would dry out if I let it sit for a while."

"O: Nice tartness and bright fruit overtones."
"This is my first fruit lambic, and I can appreciate that it is an outstanding ale, but didn't feel comfortable going higher in my scores considering my lack of reference points within the style. I don't know that lambics or fruity or sour beers will ever be a go-to for me, but I have really enjoyed them when I've had them. Certainly an enjoyable and easy drinking ale that fans of the style must really dig."

"O-great fruit lambic, another great beer from this brewery"
""
""
"Complex and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy light brown/reddish color lambic with a large foamy head with good carbonation. Aroma consists of tart a funky noes with some very subtle notes of plums. Taste is dominated by tart notes with subtle notes of plums with a light barnyard finish. Acidity level is well balanced with some oak notes easily distinguishable. Body is quite full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Enjoyable but I would have thought the plum notes would have been more pronounced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delicious, fruity lambic that doesn't quite showcase the plum fruit but delivers on other flavors. Two complaints, needs a bit more carbonation and a more assertive funk presence in the flavor profile. Other than that most all marks are hit right and drinks akin to a grape infused sour with tannic and bright fruit notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great drinkability. Excellent Lambic for sour beer lovers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though I picked up no plum notes in either the aroma or the flavor profile, this Tilquin offering is considerably smoother and more complex than their original gueuze. While the date on this bottle indicates that it is rather fresh, I would love to sample something even younger to see if the plums are more noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: What a treat. Expected big things and wasn't disappointed. Incredible complexity and depth to this libation. Incredibly refreshing, salty, funky treat from one of the finest breweries on the planet."
""
""
""
""
"Oude Gueuze Tilquin à L'Ancienne is one of the best lambics in Belgium, so the fact that adding plums to it didn't result in much of a change really doesn't matter. Bastardized, commercial fruit lambics are defined by their fruitiness but authentic, traditional fruit lambics are defined by their lambic-ness; great lambic is great lambic. And this is certainly that."
""
"Overall, cracking stuff, as I knew it was going to be. While it's not extremely dissimilar to the original gueuze, it adds enough of a twist to make it a welcome diversion from Tilquin. These guys really know their stuff, and have to be one of the best lambic producers in the world."

"A fantastic beer! What a great use of the plum."
""
""
"Really nice fruit lambic that has an incredibly strong geuze character with the plums being complementary. If you see this on the shelf, you should strongly consider buying it as it is a whole other level beyond the regular Tilquin geuze. It can be expensive, but I would argue that it's a world class lambic that deserves to command the asking price."
""
""
""
""
"Light body with zesty and sharp carbonation that stings at the tongue and really opens up your taste buds. Big flavor with nice brett character."
""
""
""
""
""
"One more or less well balanced fruit lambic - the guest star doing enough to offset the still heady tart and funky character. It was a bit of a challenge to chase this one down, and as the end cap of my last shopping day of this 2013 Yuletide season, it was totally worth it, I think. Naw, watch me be able to get this at the better bottleshops in the New Year at half the price, the idea of which thankfully doesn't detract too much from the quality or the atmosphere right now."
""
"O - Pretty good all around fruit lambic. One of my least favorite of the night but we had some pretty serious beers so that is to be expected to some extent. Glad I finally got to try it, may have to track down a bottle and throw it in the cellar for a few years."
""
""
""
""
"O - A top quality lambic with perfect balance and an absolute thirst quencher"
""
""
""
"(O)- Easily a great lambic for sure, just not as fruit forward as I had hoped it could be. Nonetheless, the base is superb and has a great balance to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was surprised how subtle the plum was, but I am not at all disappointed by that - this is an awesome drinking gueuze!"

""
""
""
"O - Nice light funk, I wish there was a bit more of it, but great flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another fantastic beer from Tilquin and one I hope to having again soon. Plums make a fantastic addition to lambic and I am surprised that there aren't more blenders making use of them."
""

""

"The palate opens very sour with a blend of lemon and lactic acids, biting, sour, cleansing and refreshing. The sourness segues into the mellow fruitiness - plums, mild peach, grapefruit and juicy lemons. The plum character is delicate and ephemeral, with a blend of sugar, juice, ripe purple dandy pluots (those are all I have on hand to compare to), and is most noticeable juts before the finish. Moderately funky, though not as strong as the nose would suggest, there's must, mushroom and petrichor. Medium light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer finishes long with a blend of plum sweetness, vanilla sugar and grapefruit peel. Excellent."
"Medium bodied with a really nice balance of acetic acid, lactic funk, earthy oak and sweet, fleshy dark fruit.  Aggressively sour and tart but not harsh, overly acidic or tough to drink.  Really mellowed out by lactic funk, earthy oak, sweet fruit and acetic vinegar.   Really sweet and refreshing wih light fruit, apple and pear along with musty bugs, lactic cheese and sweet plum flavor.  Some dry, earthy pit of the fruit but otherwise it's really juicy and fleshy.  Lingeng acetic vinegar in the finish but not solvent like or harsh at all.  The plum flavor really shows in the finish and balances out the sour and funky gueuze flavors very nicely.  "
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good lambic that is well balanced, just as good as their gueuze. I know it is pricey, but I feel it is worth and will pick up more soon."
""
""
""
"O- Glad I got to try this one fresh, it really leans toward the huge stone fruit flavor and acidity over the brett barnyard, and while I obviously haven't tried this one aged, I think the fruit really shines in it's current form. I can't see it improving much- absolutely great right now."
"Pours a murky purplish-red with a foamy bone head that settles to tiny wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Small chunks of sediment sink to the bottom of the glass after the pour. Smell is sour and tart with malt, acidic, and plum or other dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with sour dark fruit and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but there is definitely a lack of carbonation in this 375 ml bottle, which unfortunately diminishes what has the potential to be a great beer."

"Overall. I was expecting this to be good, but it's exceed those expectations. These plums make an amazing lambic. Thanks again Jeffo!!!"
"This beer ought only be pronounced with a Yiddish accent. Anyway, it pours a cloudy dark sunset amber topped by a half-finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises tart lemon zest, tart plum (I had no idea such a thing even existed), and a mild bit of tangerine. The taste brings in more of the same, with the tartness coming on rather strongly and some extra plum making an appearance near the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a damn fine beer, especially for those who like their sours to live up to that adjective with vim and vigor."
"A good beer. Not my style, but enjoyable."
""
"Very tart beer with a complex flavor. The flat appearance is a little turn off, but the flavor makes up for it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a fantastic fruited lambic that was very well done using some of the best lambic. I'm definitely glad I picked up a couple bottles of this despite the price of $16/375ml (which is on the reasonable end). I think this would do well with some age on it, bringing out the funk a little bit more. Although I'd say it's perfect for drinking now."
""
""
"I figured locating this one at a remotely reasonable price in the US was unlikely so I was pleased to find one at a reasonable price in this landmark beer bar. ""250 grams of plums per liter of lambic"" - this impacts all aspects of the beer, starting with its deep orange/pink body down to its tart fruity nose and finish. Plum seems to be a nice, and possibly underused, ingredient in lambic due to the nice balance of tartness and sweetness. Tasty."
"Overall a great lambic that will improve with age but is fantastic to drink now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Despite the low carbonation this was still an enjoyable beer. It had just enough carbonation to keep the body lively and light across the tongue."
"Overall, terrific. A lovely beer."
"Overall awesome."
""
"O.- Overall I very much enjoyed this beer, great plum flavour. Tart and delicious"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real solid memorable gueuze from these guys. The parts all fit, they may not be the greatest, but the all add up to a real impressive and very drinkable lambic."
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice sour with a good plum presence that helps cut the overall tartness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is oaky and acidic, characteristic yeast from the house barrels lends notes of damp forest floor and citrus. Plum pits and skins are there, not overpowering or overly assertive, but there's a presence that sets it apart from the Oude Gueuze. Plum is such a sweet fruit, but here it's reduced to the acidity of the fruit skins and the slight nuttiness from the pits. Overall it seems a little more oaky than the gueuze somehow, and the citrus character more subdued. A very enjoyable and traditional fruited lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good stuff, but I'd like a more distinct plum flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Amazing, nearly perfect brew and I hope Tilquin continues to experiment with different fruit. I love this, but it makes me want to see what Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen could do with plums"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall good, not as good as regular gueuze. high price tag. good once."
"I can very well concede that I have gotten a compromised bottle and will likely seek that out before much more commentary on the ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A really nice lambic from Tilquin, the plum came across quite nicely and I was lucky to get a carbed 375ml bottle. The body is a bit heavy for a fruited lambic, but overall, this is delicious, tangy for sure, but delicious."
""
""
"Excellent beer, I really loved it. Worth whatever you see it being sold for at the store. I paid about $16, and will have trouble not dropping $30+ when I see it around Manhattan. Tilquin are delivering. Don't sleep on them if you like lambic, because they won't be as readily available as they are now forever (unless they price like Drie Fonteinen I suppose... though maybe not even then)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I love this lambic, simple as that. Can't wait to age some."
"O: A great fruit lambic. Sour, fruity, funky - it's all there. The aroma is particularly stunning. The flavor is still quite good, but is not quite as balanced and complex as the aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've been wanting to try this for a while and it didn't disappoint. I probably like their gueuze a little better, but this is still an excellent beer."
"O - This was a damn good fruit lambic. Incredibly sour and mouth puckering. I was hoping the plums would be a bit more noticeable but its still a really impressive beer. Glad to have a few more bottles to age up a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an red-orangish brown color. Probably a bit too red for a wood stain, but it would be a bright cherry pine, kinda garish, really. No real head. We're in lambic country, so normal rules do not apply, not that I'm much of a believe in appearance ratings. The aroma is plum jam on top of mild vinegar and gueuze funk, but the fruit is dominant. The plum smell is on the apricot end of the plum world. It definitely smells like plums, but there's a fair bit of variation within plums. This beer smells more like what is sold as fresh French prunes, around here, rather than the juicier, sweet-tart Santa Rosa plum that I more closely associate with the fruit, though I have no idea what Tilquin actually used, of course. The funk is mildly cheesy with some nice horse blanket tendencies bouncing around (it's been too long since I used ""horse blanket"" in a review). The taste is light to medium tart with more of that fruit flavor. It's still relatively sweet and a tad lacking in flavor for what I expect from a plum sour, but I don't mean that as a knock. It's just a tad different than expected. The fruit flavor is refined and melds nicely with the tartness. There's a big lemony note. The vinegar tartness is actually pretty restrained, and there's none of that back-of-the-throat burn that many American sours suffer from. Tilquin does a magnificent job balancing the flavors, showing off that quality lambic brewer touch. Carbonation is normal. Mouthfeel is a tad slick with fruitiness. Moderate pucker. I quite enjoyed this beer. It's not a dramatic beer, but it has a lovely fruit flavor and oozes lambic complexity and refinement."

"Bottle decanted completely into a #properglassware Gueuze Tilquin tumbler. Cloudy, honey-amber color with slight purple tints, and a small off-white head that receded to a wispy cap but never fully dissipated; minimal short-lived lacing. Beautiful aroma, jammy sweet, plum and peach, funky, tart, acidic. The aroma was well-reflected in the taste, a good snap of lactic tartness up front, citrus, funky grass, mid-palate bringing in cool, sweet flavors of plum and other stone fruit, dry tannic finish, with a lingering plum skin aftertaste. Very tasty, very enjoyable. Body was medium, mouthfeel crisp and prickly, medium carbonation, extremely smooth for the style, especially considering the acidity. Overall a tremendous beer, and I'm glad I have more in the cellar. You know, this might be my favorite sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet plums, fruity-floral notes and plenty of leather, must, barnyard and funk in the nose. On the palate it is medium bodied with a nice light carbonation that adds to this brew's smoothness. Plums dominate throughout and add a subtle, balancing sweetness to the beer. The plums drive this beer but they shine because of the subtle and gradual lemon-y lactic acidity that culminates in the finish but it's not bitingly sour. It's light and gradual, providing a long sour finish. This is an absolutely gorgeous beer that is beautifully put together. All parts pair perfectly with each other and make for a crazy drinkable Lambic that is gloriously complex."
""
""
"The beer poured a lovely pink color, super citrusy taste, almost like I am drinking grapefruit juice (but without the associated bitterness). I would describe this as more of a funky and lightly tart beer than anything that was very sour. Quite good, and for a citrus nut like myself very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, phenomenal."
"OVERALL: This was excellent. A lovely and well-measured dose of plumb sweetness balanced the tart sourness and Tilquin acidity perfectly. This was very complex, enjoyable and easy to drink. A pretty lambic to look at as well. I should have loaded up on this when at Tilquin, but hopefully I run into more of this at some point. Well worth tracking down and worth drinking now while fresh. Highly recommended."

"D - Really unique stuff - curious how it will age, a I can imagine this getting quite sour in time. In any case, another great addition to the lambic world by Tilquin; well worth checking out. I could easily drink a 375ml bottle on my own."
""
"O - I'm a big fan-boy of Tilquin's regular gueuze, and I have looked forward to this one for quite awhile. I am not disappointed at all. This is an outstandingly balanced fruited lambic. Just enough sour, funk, fruit, and sweetness to make for an extremely enjoyable experience. Go get one of these!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Its 80 degrees out and theres nothing i would rather be drinking right now. So refreshing. My only complaint would be for more plum presence, but it would not stop me from drinking this delicious beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tilquin is a very under-the-radar blender at this point. However, make no mistake, their beers are very good and Quetsche is no exception. A plum lambic is very unique and here, its done very well. The fruit is subtle but it works and the aroma, look, and feel round things out nicely. Definitely one of the beer lambics I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice brew, with an original fruit used there. I guess this will age gracefully. Hopefully more will be produced for the second batch!"
