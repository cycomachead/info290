Head is loose and off-white and quickly dissipates into a tight, thin band around the shoulders of the glass. Nose is fantastic - lovely grape aromas with just a suggestion of tartness. Taste expresses quite a bit of fruit, a light tartness and a slightly salty character. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a mild astringency and a residual acidic burn at the back of the throat between quaffs. This beer was delicious and more than I expected. I'm quite amazed at how much I enjoyed and think it may surpass my love of fou' foune. I'd love another bottle for extended cellaring.","Jwale73","May 30, 2014"

Pours hazy golden with a half finger fizzy white head that dissipates almost immediately. Super musty dusty aroma, oak, funk, huge acidity, apricots, grape skins, a bit of vinegar, tart and sour smelling, very light vinous notes. Flavor is intensely acidic and sour, some floral notes on the tongue, citrus zest all the way through, dry oaky finish, and some lingering vinous warm left in the throat. Mouth puckering like whoah. As this warms it mellows a bit and the white wine notes become more present. Spritzy and prickly carbonation--lots of it--and light on the palate without sacrificing bold flavor. Super dry. Extremely clean and crisp. Good stuff.","BMMillsy","May 25, 2014"

Aroma is dry oakiness, white wine-like and a good earthiness. Taste is tart grapes, some vanilla and oak. High carbonation and low-medium body. Very tart overall and the grape plays a decent second string.","mverity","May 24, 2014"

Quite frankly, I enjoy its off-dry, musty flavor as is, as it retains a funky complexity that is cut by the semi-sweetness from the grape must. In terms of being drinkable, this may be the highest one I've had so far from Cantillon. Absolutely a must-have to convert those to sours. I doubt there's any brewery that can top this level of quality with brewing with white sweet grapes such as the moscatel varietal. I will definitely seek out more of this in the future.","magictacosinus","Sep 10, 2013"

One of the most intense lambics I have ever had but still totally drinkable and very complex for the style.","canucklehead","Jan 01, 2013"

Poured a golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, white grape, wood, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sweet fruit, grape, tart, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The grapes really took the headliner of this show as they were very well pronounced and very well integrated throughout the aroma and the flavor. This one was really quite easy to drink as there wasn’t really that much of a sour or tart aspect like most people thing when they have a brew like this. A really well done brew from one of my favorite breweries. Hope to try many from them in the future and I hope you are able to do the same.","thagr81us","Jul 10, 2012"

An object is artfully crafted and is beautiful to start out with, and aging a beer is like sanding that piece. Removing all the rough and sharp edges. Sometimes this is not desirable in either case, but sometimes it takes something amazing and improves on it. This is much more like the latter. Though the beer is much more sour, the flavors are very soft and full and smooth. Lots of winelike flavors, a bit of vinegar, and lots of lactic acid. The funk is hard to place, somewhere between sweaty and dusty and moldy.

Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel that really made it shine.","mikesgroove","Jul 03, 2011"

Mouth is much more grape-forward than the nose. Dank, wet horse, fairly sour, white grape spiraled in. Not as tight of a fruit integration as they often achieve. After a few sips it's evident that some ridiculous acidity is going on. Becomes literally painful to drink, in a way I haven't experienced before. Okay, not great, one of their weaker fruit lambics, aside from the absolute chore it was to drink this. Perhaps a younger bottle would have been better in that regard.","JAXSON","Jun 02, 2011"

It also had some nice mouthwatering citrus aromas. The taste had more of the lemon citrusy character with some muscat grapes, oaky, funky, and barnyard accents but it did have slight acidic notes. The brew was light to medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet but lemon citrusy, oaky, funky, vinous, dry and sour puckering finish that lingered on the palate.

This one off the bat is much more tart and lemon zest smelling than the Kriek that I had previously opened in the same night. Pours a yellow hazed color with a fluffy white head that quickly settles to collar around the glass. As said, the aroma is very tart/sour smelling mixed with some wine aromas and barnyrad funk but I want to be clear, for me the dominant aroma is the lemon tart notes. The first sip puckers my mouth pretty intensely. Very dry with a light mouthfeel. After my mouth relaxs a bit the full floavor of the beer is evident; lemon, cider apple, white grape notes abound. Pretty enjoyable but otherwise hard for me to really pick out the muscat grape flaovrs mixed with everything else.

It off-gasses scents of nectarines, spiced apricots, chardonnay, inexpertly cleaned white peach pits, and tastes austere, but not as caustic as the bottled form -- aided, no doubt, by the keg format, which thickens the mouthfeel and focuses on the fruit.

It has an aroma that is both musty and sour. I can smell some peach as well. The taste has some sourness, but not too much. It is a bit cider-like. It tastes aged, kind of like an old oxidized beer, but not quite. There were some ripe fruit flavors as well. It has a light body. There was a good tingling sensation from the sourness.

Tastes of even more Belgian fonky funk with a sour fruit and grape note on the midpalate. Finishes puckering with tannins for a very dry finish. Feels light with moderate bubbliness, not quite as champagne like as some Cantillons, but good. Overall quite a tasty brew.

There is almost a peach-like richness of fruit in the aroma. Tangy and luscious. A hint of creaminess in the finish. Very smooth, not too sharp and wonderfully sweet and sour with a hint of tannins from the oak and grape skins. This paired wonderfully with a sharp cheddar and water crackers, with the sweet/sour beer acting as a nice foil to the sharpness and richness of the cheese. Fairly subtle for this brewery, but very complex notes of oak, sweet grape, acetic notes, a touch of barnyard, and a subtle creaminess. Delicious.","Georgiabeer","Jul 13, 2009"

The smell, however, is very nice: Funky, musty, wet-straw and barnyard, grape skins, pale malt. Wonderful and complex aroma! The taste is solid...mouth-puckeringly sour, but also also balanced with a decent sweetness. The malt and grape-skin quality comes out a little more in the taste.

A tart apple and grapeskin main character, juicy citrus and rind, and a load of barn funk. Real nice and funky, wild. This is technically a fruit lambic and the white grape is surely there, but this is an awful lot like a nice gueuze, just mellower. The mouthfeel is so, so soft. Not bold and brash at all like some Cantillon can be, really unique in that way. I would love to see what a bit more age would do for this beer.

The taste is delicious but tart, lemon zest and pith with horse blanket, but most of all bitingly sour. I like it a lot, this is nearly flawless like all Cantillon beers. The mouthfeel is thin yet carbonated and effervescent. This is such a good beer, I think it's best summed up by LongBeachBum in terms of wine, this is Cantillon's "white" to the St.Lamvinus "Red".

The dryness of the Italian Muscat grapes from which it was made comes through but with the tart funkiness typical, or so I'm lead to believe, of the lambic style. I've dabbled with a few lambics but none compares to this - superb clean tasting with a sourness and tartness that do not offend but attract the drinker to imbibe a bit more and a bit more ... and a bit more! When one thinks of a sour fruit, lemon naturally comes to mind, but this is more like a lemon meringue pie with a tasty deliciousness that is easy to savour yet hard to imitate.

For, not only it retains the integration well but also all the flavours (that I can detect) evolve just neatly and seamlessly within this "agreed" boundary... It's more acidic on the flavour than on the nose, and the white grapes have indeed rendered a higher level of sour fruitiness if I am not trying too hard to make sense of the influence.

I'm really trying to get some grapes, and if I strain, I can pick up a faint dryish white wine in the back, but that could be my imagination. This one is really lemony in the flavor and stands out above any really intense funk. Something that stands out is what I'm identifying as a faint fennel character in the background. When I think about it, I get this in some other lambics but have not been able to place it. Acidity isn't too harsh here and is rounded out by a little sweetness. Finishes dry. Any grape character I get comes at the very finish and echoes on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light, but feels more subdued than other lambics I'm used to.

I've come to learn the aroma of a Cantillon is just amazing, this one displaying some solvent, hay, sourness, and a touch of fruit, though I can't decide what. The flavor hits you as intense sourness, a bit of the wheat is detected. And, as their website notes that use a small amount of aged hops, so they go unoticed. As I hit my next glass of it, the grapes come into play and it's clear this is very much a sparkling wine like experience. Went well with a Frenchie leek and mushroom quiche.

4.37,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Rather clear, a bright burnished gold color. A small puff of white foam fizzes away like soda, leaving only a thin collar covering the beer, which quickly dies away. Funky, funky aroma. Sour, with a grapey tartness. Moldy, basement funkiness nearly gives the effect of mint. Very strange, but that's the scent that lingers in my nose. A bit cheesy, but mostly a winey grape tartness. Puckering sourness starts things off, making my eyes water a bit. I haven't had Cantillon in a while! The sourness makes my lips tingle a bit. Moldy, farmy funk reminds me of wet hay and stilton cheese, giving in to a slight medicinal sharpness and strong, grapey sourness busting through the finish. Distinct crabapple, with a citrusy hue. A slight bit of alcohol, maybe. Definitely a lingering brettanomyces character. Yeee-owch! Fairly light bodied, with sparkling, champagne-like carbonation. Very dry on the palate all the way through, finishing almost papery. Another winner from this antique brewery.","UnionMade","Mar 28, 2006"

In any event a very refreshing( almost painfully so ) lambic and just the thing if you want to be soured to the max. Lacks some of the complexity of some other cantillon products, even unblended lambics.","dogfooddog","Mar 16, 2006"
4.04,-8.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Taste: Acidity is a much more tame than the Foufoune that blew me away minutes before, it still had that great musty Cantillon flavor, the usual lively carbonation was a bit more subdued, odd since this bottle is relatively young. Aftertaste was also a little less intense, not as drying. A great Beer for sure, just not at the level of some of the others, IMHO.","Goldorak","Mar 01, 2006"

As always the first sip is a wake-up call to the tongue. This is enjoyable but becomes more rewarding with each sip. White grape juice and a hint of sulfur in the kick help round out the sourness. Nice and light in the mouth and ever refreshing.","Higravity","Feb 24, 2006"
4.54,3.2,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle, corked and capped. According to the cork, this bottle is from 2003. This beer pours out a bright yellowish orange color with no head, although there appears to be some carbonation present. The aroma is grapes, oak, and horse blanket. This beer sure doesn't lack for funkiness. The aroma changes from minute to minute, more so than just about any beer I've ever tried. Shake your glass gently, take a deep whiff, and the aroma will jump out and bite your head off. The flavor is sour, though it doesn't have the vinegar flavor of many other lambics. The grapes impart a tasty fruitiness. Some oak flavor. Finishes very dry with a pungent bite. This one will burn a hole in your belly, but you just can't stop sipping. There is more carbonation than it appears. Great drinkability. This reminds me why I love beer.","beveragecaptain","Feb 01, 2006"

The closest I can recall is when I worked at a zoo (yes, I really did) and had to clean the donkey stalls. That was the ost acrid smell I have ever encountered. This beer was very close. Wow. Just wow. The flavor was wesome. First, it pulled all moisture from my mouth. The sourness was intense, but not puckering. I got a small hint of hte vinous grape nd grape rind. It was an intense flavor, but not lingering and offensive. It finished a bit grainey even. Just beautiful. The feel was moderate with a very light carbonation. Drinkability was as good as it gets. I thought it was going to kick my ass whe I first smelled it, but the flavor was very refined and mellow. Everything was in harmony. Awesome beer. Don, you are a champ.","kmpitz2","Jun 02, 2005"

Quite literally, this beer is cloudy -- lots of fluffy pockets of yeast and/or other sediment are drifting throughout this mazie/orange beer. Orange peel, green grapes, vanilla-less oak, and nasty barnyard funk are all notable undertones to a dominant sourness. Mouth-puckering goodness is defined by some orange and other citrus flavors as well as the typical Cantillon lactic acidity. Some brief hints of more refined sourness with very clear citrus flavors. The orange really pops and keeps coming to mind. Addictive like crack; I need more.","marburg","Dec 19, 2004"

The taste was tart and musty with notes of grapes (vinous) and typical "wild" lambic flavors. The mouthfeel was crisp and sharp and tart and acerbic with medium body and strong carbonation. This was an excellent lambic, and one of the best from Cantillon that I have sampled.","UncleJimbo","Sep 12, 2004"

Cloudy goldenrod when poured. I thought the aroma was of light barnyard...in my minds eye I see fresh straw and sawdust ;-) Anyway, this one is very juicy, very fruity, but I still experienced some acetic qualities (grapeskin?). Probably will not be my favorite Cantillon, but I am glad I got to try it and share it with some great BAs at the Moan and Dove.","PatandDavid","Sep 06, 2004"

Aroma is yeasty and fruity with grapes in the mix as well as a musty cellar funk. Mouthfeel is highly effervescent and crisp with a tart and dry finish. Flavor is sour and tart like a wine cooler with grapes providing most of the flavor. Not the best Lambic but not a drain pour either.","BierReise","Feb 13, 2004"
4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A murky peach coloured brew with golden yellow and orangey highlights. The aroma is more subdued than a typical lambic offering from Cantillon. The aroma consists of the white muscat grapes and the sweet sugars that they have let off. There is also a peach like frutiness amongst the mustiness and barnyard like traditional lambic aromas that are also prevalent in this brew. Finally a bit of sweet honey ties all of the flavors together and make this one extremely complex and interesting brew. The taste follows suit on the aroma. The traditional lambic funkiness and sweet and sour tartness are there, but there is also so much more going on in the mix. The clover honey, and white grape flavors explode on the tongue, and I can even taste a bit of other fruits (perhaps peaches and apricots) in the mix as well. The mouthfeel is extremely effervescent, astringent, sweet, sour and excellent and the drinkability is classic Cantillon excellence as well! What else can I say, that has not already been said. Another achingly original and traditional offering for Van-Roy and Cantillon...the true lambic masters! I found this to be best served at around 55* F!","francisweizen","Jan 07, 2004"

Aroma is musty like a old wet blanket. As it sits a lemony citus aroma comes through. The first sip brings in the ol pucker factor. As you continue drinking you can begin to make out the muscat grapes hiding in there. As it warms the sourness seems to intensify. Very Very good!","Indybeer","Jan 02, 2004"

4.45,1.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Hazed golden peach color, finding its way to a murky cider hue after the fizzy white head quickly fades. Oaky, vanilla notes play second fiddle to grassy, citrus notes and the ubiquitous musty, acidic nose that is distinctly Cantillon. Tart lemon and citrus flavor is most dominant, though the sugars from the Muscat grapes play a minor role around mid-bottle, creating a mildly sweet-and-sour effect. The sour notes, however, are most evident. Light-to-medium bodied with medium carbonation and a lightly effervescent mouthfeel. Very refreshing and drinkable. Overall, I can't say I detected too much of the Muscat grapes except for perhaps a little of their inherent sugars along the way. Not my favorite of all the Cantillon lambics (that's not saying too much, as I adore this brewery), but still a top-notch creation as would be expected.","Jon","Dec 01, 2003"
4.19,-4.8,3,4,4.5,4.5,4,"As I pull the cork I get a strong smell of vinegar, this aroma seems to be attached to the cork and does not carry over to the beer. It is a cloudy orange color, and though well carbonated, it is not beery enough to hold a head for any length of time. A sour musty aroma emanates from my glass, notes of citrus as well. The taste is predominantly a lemony sourness. Definitely wine like in some ways (especially the body), but it is hard to say of this is from the Muscat grapes. There is a definite funky Lambic character here; musty, astringent, and acidic. Hard to say what grape character is here, it seems a bit lighter in body and there is a definite lack of heading proteins, perhaps a hint of the Muscat is in the acidic finish, but it is hard to say. As the beer warms up I get some cider notes as well, though it is still quite lemony. As a fruit beer it lacks the fruit character it should have (perhaps younger versions have more Muscat character). As a well carbonated Lambic type beer though, it works and is quite good.","Gueuzedude","Nov 19, 2003"
4.42,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours with a fizz. A small ivory white head forms atop the hazy light golden body. It fizzles away quickly leaving a miniscule collar. Carbonation looks to be vigorous from appearance. Aroma is quite funky. Love that funky lambic smell. Like a horse stall at the State Fair. But in a good way. There's also lemony, grassy tones on the nose. And just a tad of sweet fruit as well. When the beer hits my tongue, I don't pucker nearly as much as I was expecting. The acidity and tartness seem a bit lower than your typical Cantillon offering, but they ARE there. And quite enjoyable. Funky yeast tastes mingle with musty overatures. Barnyard, Horse Blanket, lemongrass, acetic acid...damn enjoyable. Mouthfeel is lively. Burps burn my nostrils. This is a great sour beer.","Bighuge","Aug 22, 2003"
