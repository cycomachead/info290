"What to drink when you really want something that is more like soda pop than beer?  I guess it would be Lindemans Peche.  Nose - peach.  Taste - peach soda.  I suppose in a blind taste test with this and peach soda, I would notice some more differences.  Nice sour balance to the sweet, but very little in the way of complexity.  Tasty?  Yes.  This is probably my wife's favorite ""beer.""  It just seems to be a one-trick sweet peach pony."

"Drinkability – Lindemans makes some of my favorite Lambics.  But I like their other flavors better."

"Aroma on this beer was fantastic but I didn't pick up the greatest taste. The carbonation was off and the bottle may have been old..."

"Almost champagne like quality . Great peach flavoring. Love it"

"Awesome dessert beer. If my sweet tooth kicks in this is the beer that I want."
"DATE TASTED: February 14, 2015... GLASSWARE: Samuel Adams Infinium flute... OCCASION: Valentine’s Day drinking with the most champagne-like of beers... APPEARANCE: light body of a wheat ale or cider, with subtle effervescence and slightly hazy; fizzy white head holds steady to a half-inch of significantly creamy, clouding to-finger smear; ... AROMA: immediate peach, a basket in each nostril, with secondary apple and yeasty funk not polluting the overall experience... PALATE: soft as flower petals; dry at its end, with some bubbly flourish; creamy, reasonably bodied for a lambic...TASTE: sweet and strong peach, with a metallic, earthy base that gives the experience backbone; easily sippable, with hints of orange peel., mango and tartness..OVERALL: a perfect compliment to the levity of the day; specialized flavor for special occasions--slightly pricey but enjoyable..."

"Like eating a perfectly delicious ripe peach.  Great flavor.  A very sweet lambic suited in my opinion for dessert or after a meal."
""
"If you want to get an unsuspecting friend to drink and actually enjoy a lambic, this is one approach you could take. Hopefully said friend likes peaches. Personally, not a huge gratuitous fruit beer drinker but this one was pleasing enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I'm digging this beer.  It's not something I would normally go for, but I will definitely be buying this again.  It would be perfect for a spring picnic with your significant other.  Great Stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Such sweet goodness. Amazing smell."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Seems like a much more restrained use of fruit sweetness with this beer than with other fruit variants of lambic, and tastes very natural.  This would be an excellent dessert beer."

"Pours a pretty golden color with a thin white head with some sediment left in the bottom of the bottle. Really no lacing to speak of. The aroma is of peaches with some yeast. The taste has much more flavor than the aroma and besides the peach there is a hint or tangerine and orange in there as well. Very smooth and quite tasty actually. Good drink and goes down so easy!"

"Wow, I really don't like this beer. It smells like peach squash (peach concentrated juice): synthetically fruity and artificially sweet. Tastes the same way. Sickly and way too much. It tastes like the fruit juice concentrate you buy and then dilute with water, except here whoever's mixing the drinks got the ratio all wrong and didn't put in enough water. I'd strongly recommend avoiding this."

"O: Overall a very pleasant drinking beer, but perhaps more akin in taste to a sweet cider. Recommended if you like sweet fruity beers."
""
"Overall: Solid dessert beer. If you like peach cobbler, this is basically peach cobbler and a peach soda plus some unnoticeable alcohol."
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It was refreshing and very easy to drink due to its sweetness. It reminded me of summer, and I thought that it would pair well with a lot of different foods."
""
""
""
"This fruit based beer is pleasantly good, has great small, no edge, and no after taste. It pours golden, with a sparkling haze, one finger sized head, and medium amount of carbonation. It goes down light, not filling, and doesn't leave the mouth dry. It has a sugary and peach taste, with little to no hops/malt taste. Very little alcohol, good for starting the night out..."

"O - I am drinking this on a stinking hot night and it is good because it is refreshing, but bad because it is a ten dollar plus beer of 2.5% which goes down like essentially soft drink. It is NOT a sour lambic to me, whilst there is a moderate crisp note to the taste it is essentially a sweet beer. Not to be repeated."
""
"O- I would definitely buy it again, it is a perfect drink for that hot summer afternoon. I'd like it a bit colder than it was during my tasting."
"Overall – While very-very sweet, the peach flavor is quite authentic and really is not all the cloying. With the tart and light grass flavors as well as the fantastic mouthfeel, the flavors end up making for a rather refreshing peach flavored sweet lambic."

"Overall - Great Lambic, very refreshing and surprising that your are drinking and alcoholic beverage until it hits you. My favorite Lambic. These goes down quick and smooth."
""
""
""
""

"Typically lambic, a little hazy, effervescent and bubbly. Aroma is peachy and has that usual lambic musty note. Flavor is quite tasty, peach comes through well as does typical lambic malt flavors and that kinda old musty classic lambic flavor. I've enjoyed each of this brewery's lambics that I've tried so far, and this one is no exception."

"Poured from a bottle into a flute, the beer is a bright, orange-gold coloring with steady carbonation and a frothy, bubbly, bright white head. Aromas of rich, hearty peach, with an effervescent tartness that borders on sour. The nose is light enough that it avoids being overpowering like some Lambics. Flavors of subtle roast with a peach flavor that honestly tastes like fresh pureed peaches. Very authentic and balanced. Wow. Smooth bodied, light, and crisp, making it very easy to drink. The aftertaste is subtle rich and sweet peach, with a slight linger after the clean, smooth finish. Very easy to drink, and very tasty."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a decent Lindemans; basically like all their other beers but peach flavored, so just depends which fruit you like best. I like peaches and while I liked the nose, the taste was too sweet for me to handle...split a 375 with my girlfriend as she loved it and I couldn't handle the whole thing myself. Worth checking out if you like their other stuff, but don't expect a sour lambic."

"If this thing tasted closer to how it smelled, it would have been awesome. A tart, funk peach-fest, but by aroma only. The taste lead on to a much sweeter, sugary style of peaches that still tasted fine, but could easily wear down a palate (or even a sweet tooth). More funk, more tart, and less sweet is the key. For some strange reason, my nose was pleased but my taste buds were not."

"O: Lindmans doesn't fail, this is just as good as the frambois. Could be that peaches and raspberries are my favorite fruits though."

""
""
"Overall: I was disappointed with this one. There were some nice peach flavors and aromas, which saved it from being a bomb, but I'd still stay away from this one. It's too sweet and lacks the sour, tart, and funky characteristics you'd look for in a Belgian Lambic. This was more like drinking an expensive peach soda."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a big fan of fruit beers and ciders this is really enjoyable to me even if it does border on being too sweet once you near the end of the bottle. For those who aren't a big fruit beer fan this will probably be WAY too sweet so you might want to steer clear. I really enjoy it though, it's a nice treat."
""
""
""
"M&D&O - so perfectly drinkable, inoffensive, gregarious, makes friends really easy, situations where I brought over a bottle of Lindemans Framboise may get replaced with this nectar"
"this is punishingly sweet, and there really is nothing lambic-esque about it. it pours a flat looking bronze color with literally no head. the nose is brown sugar and peach syrup, the kind starbucks uses to make your latte ""special"". the peach is artificial in taste too, sort of like dried apricots, but more crystalized on the sugar front. a good beer for kids, as it satiates the candy urge, and would require a gallon or two to catch a buzz (not that I advocate or condone youth and alcohol...). teeth rottingly sweet, but not boring. it really needs more bubbles, and I think the bottle does more justice to this than the tap, but it comes across a bit heavy with all the residual sugar and no bubbles to keep it moving. overall this is well made I suppose, but its not beer as we know and love it, its something to keep the wife busy while you guzzle IPAs and figure out how much you've got to pay the babysitter. nothing special from my point of view."
""
""
""
""
"O- great lambic, love this f'n beer!"
""
""
""
"The taste is loyal to the aroma, but now the sourness shows up. I don't notice any hop taste. This medium-body beer has an incredible ability to go through the palate without any notice - it's pretty interesting. Also, it seems to be a very good alternative for a champagne."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This looks like a lightly colored fizzy apple juice. There’s a tart aroma that smacks of what I imagine peach blossoms to smell like. Very—overly—sweet with the flavor of an almost-artificial ripened peach on the palate. Think something along the lines of a peach jam in terms of sweetness. It is crisp and an easy drinker but that does not make this one I’d seek out again."

"O: Light peach flavour. People who enjoy lightly flavoured fruit beverages should try Lindemans Pêche."
""

"O- With more carbonation, this might be a decent lambic."

"Taste, appreciable peach, but also significant sugary content. A little bit of tartness develops on the palate. Wheat is perceptible. Peach is strong, like the pimp hand. The downfall is just the massive sugar content, and it is oh so prevalent in the mouthfeel, like you're drinking a peach lemonade or something, but without even the tartness of something like lemonade can bring. I like it more than the other sugary lambics lindeman's offers, but I think this would just be so good if they cut down on the sugar and amped up the tartness in these."

"O- This is a very sweet/sour beer, and I mean very sweet. I can only handle one bottle of this due to that simple fact that it is just way to sweet for my taste. I still enjoyed it very much. This is not my everyday beer at all, but I could possibly see myself trying more lambics in the near future. I spent about 6 bucks for a 12 oz. bottle so if you are ""experimenting"" it is a just above fair price imo. Still good in my book though."
""
""
""
"Overall a great showing. I dare say this one is a little too sweet compared to other Lindemans but the balance is great as always. Highly recommended."

"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass, the lambic was a golden color. Giving a generous head, the lambric has a champagne-like level of carbonation. A bouquet of fresh cut peaches erupted from the glass. It does not really smell like beer, but that is how lambics are supposed to be. The initial taste is tart peaches with honey and a hint of cinnamon. The peach hits the sour buds on the tongue making them tingle with the sour sensation. My great disappointment with this beer is that the flavor did not last long as the carbonation brushed the peaches away quickly, leaving a somewhat watery aftertaste. The tart peach notes are present, but not with the same level of intensity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried this at Gigs in London. Poured a clear orange/pinkish colour, just like a peach. This one tasted like a jolly rancher as well, with a bit more apple coming through then peach in the flavour. Its pretty crazy how much fruit flavour they got in this though. Interesting beer."

"This sint' a great beer and not a great lambic but it is sweet and light and very fruit forward, it is a fun beer and hte wife seems to like it especially in summer so I don't have a problem with it. I'll never go out of my way to drink one of these fake lambics but I'll try anything once, better than I expected."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this brew answers the call of being a summer fruit Lambic. Light and easy to drink. Strong on the peach flavor and Lambic tartness."
""
"Taste: peaches and apples. Though this is a peach lambic, it comes across as an apple cider."
""
""
"O: Extremely drinkable, this is the beer equivalent of biting into a sweet fresh peach."
""
""
""
"This is a great fruit lambic easily could be one of my favorites. Great fruit flavors and sweetness. Awesome"
""
""
""
""
""

"D - It's not balanced, and it's not complex, but it's damn good. It also may be worth mentioning that this has been my introduction to Brouwerij Lindemans, a brewery I expect to drinking a lot of now! While it may not satisfy the connoisseur in search of a intense sour, this lambic has been thoroughly satisfying for me. Despite the overbearing sweetness in the flavor profile, it remains quite drinkable; but then again, how could a 4.0% ABV sunshine-fruity sugar bomb not? If there has ever been an ideal brunch beer, this is it."
""
"Honestly, I don't think anyone could make a peach wine this delicious and balanced. Big sweetness and a big tartness. Someone pass the French toast."
""
"O- Overall, I rate this beer at a 4.o. If the carbonation was a little lighter This would easily get a 4.5. I can't rate at a 5 because even though this is a great beer, it's not something that I can drink everyday. It's a once or twice a year drink."
"A sweet, peachy concoction but in no way resembles a lambic."
""
""
"Overall, it's an excellent beer to go with more food selections than other lambics. Strongly recommend to those who are not a fan of young, bitter hops in their drinks."
"O-this is pretty good. a bit to sugary. drinks more like a wine cooler. wouldn't mind having again though. look forward to trying some more flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lightly hazy pale yellow with a small white head. In the aroma, sugary, tart peach skin. In the taste, quite sugary and small tartness of peach skin. A small tart bite, but mainly smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry tart peach skin in the aftertaste. Kind of like a gummy peach ring, and it is line smell, taste, and aftertaste all the way through."
""
""
""
"O: This was an impressive lambic. It was a little too sweet for my liking but enjoyable nonetheless. With that being said I don’t think I could have had more than one of these."
""
""
"Medium body. The carbonation balances the taste well. Not bad overall. Not one of Lindemans stronger offerings. Overly sweet for me, although some might prefer it. Kind of a turned down fruit lambic with turned up sweetness."
""
"O: This is great for someone who doesn't like beer. I don't love this, but it's pretty good."
"O- The peach flavor is so darn sweet but it is not as syrupy thanks to the big fizz. There isn't much depth in this beer but it is not really offensive to drink. However one is enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Great lambic. It's well built and balanced, fairly priced, good quality, and widely available. I'll have this again."
"B-"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this lambic. As stated it is not too juicy but not too carbonated. It has a strong sweet peach flavor and combined with the tarty finish makes it very enjoyable.Has well balanced flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a lindemans fluted glass. This pours a light yellow, with a large foamy head which leaves a lacing. The smells aren't really of peach, but some earthy grassy smells along with a yeasty lambic smell. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is good, not as sweet as the frambrosie, there is a little earthy flavor along with the peach, good stuff."
"Overall-- meh. too sweet and sugary (like many of the brewery's ""fruit lambics"") and not sour enough to cut through it."
"O: This beer was quite tasty. Not as tart but it felt better balanced than the framboise."
"Carbonation is right on point. Keeps it light and crisp. But it drinks like a sparkling peach wine cooler. Decent peach flavor but not my cup of tea."
"Overall Impression- The best Lambic so far from Lindemans! No wonder it has taken me almost 6 months to find this. Actually, I probably could have just called around to local liquor stores and eventually found it but it was cooler to have stumbled upon it at a beer bar with friends. Would recommend this one for sure but not @ the $16 price. I bet you could buy this from $10-12."
"Probably not something I'd have more than a glass or two of in one sitting, it's a pretty good find!"
"O- I know this isn't a world class lambic, but it sure is delicious. I'd like some funk and more sour, but it's still tasty. It's basically juice by the by."
"The mouthfeel is right on for me. The body is approaching full with a syrupy feel. The carbonation is very modest but adds the fuzz around the edges that somehow seems appropriate for a peach beer. All the while my mouth goes into pucker mode upon every sip."
"Overall very pleased with it."
"This brew poured out as a clear looking light orange color. The head fizzles away and leaves no lacing. The smell of the beer has a sweet and slightly tart aroma to it. The taste of this brew is much like wine to me. There is a sweet dessert like quality to this brew also. The mouthfeel is light and easy going. Overall I found this brew to be pretty good overall. It's not my favorite from this brewery but still not bad."
"O: A very solid fruit lambic that lives up to the Lindemans name of making consistently good fruit beers"
"Notes: Pretty much like drinking peach sorbet/ice cream or the peach drink mix you add to water. Sweet and it doesn't taste like actual peach, but it isn't bad. Not cloyingly sweet and it isn't prohibitive to drinking more, but I wouldn't really want to drink more."
"Pours a hazy peach-orange color with a 1 inch fizzy white head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one whatsoever. Smell is obviously of peaches, peach juice, and some slight sour/tart aromas. Taste is of fresh sweet peaches, peach juice, and some tart acidic flavors. A nice sour peach aftertaste with each sip. Very carbonated with a crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good lambic and probably my other favorite besides the framboise. Really nice peach aromas and flavors on this one."
"Poured a 2"" white soap suds head. Clear golden yellow color body and the first of their fruit lambics I thought looked like an actual beer. Smells only mildly of peaches. Taste is also fairly mild on the peach and also has a little malt. There's a sour finish being a lambic and it suits the peach well. This is less of a dessert beer than there other fruits. Respectable."
"Side point not affecting grading: I don't see how this is a beer. It followed the guidelines for a lambic. However, in a blind taste test: I would not label this as a beer. Please don't hate me for this comment O Great Beer Gods!"
"Overall, a nice beer. More of a desert type beer. The sweetness makes this one a sipper. And I don't imagine you could drink more than one (maybe two) glasses in a sitting."
"O: I do like this, but it's a bit too sweet, I really have to be in the perfect mood to drink this. For the style, it's solid, for my palate, it's just too sweet. There's an epic beer here, it just needs less sugar and more refinement."
"This is a good fruit beer. It tastes more like a wine cooler, but I'd happily have another one of these."
"This beer rocks and the wife loves it!"
"O- Nice brew. Not my favorite style, but this is a tasty beer that would be refreshing on a hot summer's day."
"Overall though easy drinking, fun simple, super easy light abv, candy like beer. Truly a peach in a glass dream lovers beer."
"Overall an amazing beer and one of my favorites in the fruit genre."
"Pours a clear medium gold with a nice head and leaves some lacing on the glass. The smell is of peaches and yeast. Taste is first of tart peaches and wheatbeer yeastiness. Sourness on the back of the tongue. Light, fruity and bubbly. Sweetness is well balanced by the tartness and yeasty ""beeryness"". Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Overall, I normally lament the lack of more aggressive lambic character (acidity, mustiness, barnyard) in the Lindeman's beers, I feel that actually works here. Quite refreshing and highly enjoyable. It's well worth seeking out and should not be passed over for the Kriek or Framboise."
"My girlfriend says that this one is ""perfect""."
"O- Wow I love this beer. I can easily drink this all day long on a nice summer day."
"Pouring clear orange with a thin, wispy, white head that falls off to a ring leaving minimal lacing, this looks pretty decent. The nose is moderately sweet in a fruity way, with plenty of peach character present. In some ways, this is like peach juice, with a little bit of lemon and just a wisp of barnyard present. Surprisingly complex, IMO. The palate, though, is a lot sweeter. That aspartame sweetness is prominent, rather artificial and takes away from the fruit character. It also hides any lambic character that's present. Sweet on the finish, this medium-light bodied beer is moderately carbonated and finishes sweet. Decent, this is better as an accompaniment with a dessert where it's lack of complexity can be hidden."
"Overall: I would say this beer is dangerously drinkable. It's got a great scent to it, matching flavors and pretty low ABV... It would be easy enough to drink all day and night. I would think it would be especially refreshing in the summer months with the sweet fruit and mild tartness to it."
"O - Very good in small quantities, or paired with something that could really highlight sweetness and artificial fruit."
"i like its aroma. it stands out"
"Pour yields weak thin head. Body is bright vibrant orange. Smell is tart citrus orange with a twist of peach. I am also picking some clove and other Belgian yeast qualities. Smell seems to mostly be in the sourness. My first so I would say this is good. Has a super nice sourness with nice sugar sweetness mixed in. I think I get more sour apple than peach myself but it does show up in the aftertaste. For a newbie I would compare it sour patch kids or those candy peach rings. The flavor hits immediately and stays the same throughout. It really holds up for the long run. I think I would enjoy it more if the carbonation was amped up a bit but still it feels pretty good on the tongue. My first sour, or at least I think it is, actually delivered on what I expected. It really tasted exactly as I imagined it would and that does not happen often with beer."
"O: Certainly quite sweet in terms of the flavor, but not the worst of the Lindemans products."
"Very sweet, an enjoyable dessert type beer, fans of cider would like it a lot."
"O: I like it, not enough that I would go out and buy some, but enough that I will take a taste when I get the chance. If this were a little less sweet and a little more tart I would like it a whole lot more."
"O- if youre big on peach pie, check this one out. if youre looking for a true belgian lambic, avoid this one. overly sweet and without the tartness that one would normally associate with a lambic."
"O: This is a terrific lambic that is delicious and weak enough in alcohol to be enjoyed at any hour."
"O - a refreshing treat that I'll have to try with peach cobbler sometime."
"Drinkability is high. This is delicious."
"Cloudy orange with a big frothy white head. Lots of lace left behind on the the flute. Aromas are a tad skunked, not prominent in any magnificent way. There's a little bit of fruitiness but it's almost stale and somewhat metallic. The flavors tell a whole different story, thankfully. Sweet, syrup-like peaches up front and some bitterness at the back. High carbonation with a thick mouth-coating consistency. This brew is good, but it's even better when you have someone to split it with. Too sweet for me to consider drinking an entire 750. I'd go with something like this before or after dinner."
"Very easy sipper when you're looking for something light and tart. not too much sour, not too much sweet. Great overall."
"Drinkablility is high, hell the bottle was gone before i knew it and i certainly could drink another. All in all for my first experience with a beer of this style this one makes me want to explore it further."
"Poured a dark pale orange with a small white fizzy head that was mostly diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was of a bread malt, a doughy yeast with a strong peach presence. It tasted sweet of peaches and malts at first and finished sweetly-sour and quite peachy (almost like a champagne). Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and dry in texture with a very lively carbonation. Overall a tasty Lambic, especially if you like champagne."
"Drinkability - Not a session beer. Then again, most lambics aren't. However, it's a perfect dessert or brunch beer."
"I'm a fan, I like the peach flavors, and love the balance."
"Drinkability. A great drinker. Quite surprising for such a sweet lambic."
"D- Very high drinkability with a nice, average 4%ABV and great taste."
"D - I think this has pretty good drinkability. It is a good beer, but the sweetness is getting to me a little. Keep in mind this is my first lambic, so I'm not quite used to this style of beer yet. Overall, I liked it. I definitely think I need to keep getting more fimiliar with this style and understand it more. My girlfriend loved this one though. I recommend trying it out."
"This was my first experience with a Lambic and an eye-opening one at that. Poured a hazy, lazy, pale gold with a white head and sharp lacing. Smelled of fresh peaches soaked in fresh peach juice. Tasted of a peach farm, peach puree with a simple syrup component to it. ad a clean, brisk and refreshing bite to it with a little tartness on the end. Mouthfeel was crisp and clean and bubbly. Drinkability, maybe not for a night out but the right time for this beer is a summer weekend. Really good stuff."
"This was amazing, perhaps the best memory of this christmas, and a christmas miracle too (I found a beer my mom liked the taste of). This beer poured orange with a white/peach colored head, smell was intensely of sweet fruits, complimenting the taste. It was light and bubbly to the tongue, the alcohol almost not noticeable, it was perhaps that that made it so easy to drink."
"D: Tasty especially if you're into peaches, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, while it's a little on the sweet side, it done much better than most regular fruit beers."
"O: Combination of sweet and sour is very well balanced so it is unlikely that it will burn out the palate. Low ABV means many can be had. This would make an excellent session beer."
"D - Could probably drink this forever."
"Had this on-tap at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Pours a pale yellow colour with thin white head. Smells strongly of peach, but also candy sugar. Flavour is both sweet and tart, quite a nice balance between the two flavours. Very smooth carbonation. This may be too sweet for me to drink more than one in a sitting, but it is good."
"Lindemans Pêche has a yellow colour and a head that is about one finger high. Despite the fact that it's not especially carbonated, the head lasts. The smell is strong and fruity. It smelled of banana to me. The taste is very sweet with banana ester. It tastes like a cider to me, or fruit juice. The peach is especially noticeable in the afteretaste. This beer is thin like cider in your mouth, like slightly carbonated water. This beer was very nice but the sweetness was slightly overpowering after more than one glass."
"Bottled, pours a turbid deep copper orange with a sizable head. Nose is some sour oak and canned peaches, not bad. Extremely sweet flavor compared to every other lambic I've tried, though it tastes kind of good. Not fresh peaches but canned peaches and syrup. Ultimately this is candy-like and is way too sweet for me to drink a whole bottle. Better than the Framboise and Cassis."
"Overall: Basically to recap, Lindemans Pêche balances much better than Framboise. Tastes just as good, but the appearance, feel, and drinkability do not compare."
"I would suggest that everyone try it warm, for it is a beer not lacking in character, and an amazing example of beer!"
"Great morning beer!"
"D- Great fruit flavor and very easy to sip on. This would make a good substitution for a mimosa at a brunch!"
"I found drinkability to be high; very enjoyable beer, especially as an after-dinner drink. In lambics I've finally found a beer style my wife likes!"
"Poured a orange color that was slightly hazed. Smelled of fresh peaches, sweet malts, and some caramel. Taste of fresh peaches and sweet malt, and some champagne flavor almost like a sparkling peach beverage. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel very light almost like champagne. Beer snobs may knock a good lambic such as this but they are being too purest and need to remember that beer is open to interpretation. Very drinkable and a highly memorable beer."
"Drinkability: For a peach-flavored libation, I'd rather opt for a bellini. Still, it's decent enough to split with the girlfriend on a lazy Sunday afternoon."
"D: i like the low abv but this got a bit cloying after a while."
"D - I was able to finish my part of the bottle that I had split with my girl friend. I enjoyed it but after i wanted something more fimiliar."
"Frothy, white head and clear. aroma has hints of herbs and grass, light yeast, peach (duh). Dry texture, with a very fizzy carbonation. Heavy sweet innitial flavor and finish. Peach is, of course, the dominant flavor, but it's not too overpowering. Very refreshing."
"(D)- I realize that many bash the lambics that Lindemans puts out, but I rather have enjoyed them thus far. Fruity and lightly sour with good acidity. What I like about them is that they tend to be a more fruit-driven take on the style rather than a face melting sourness. Very food friendly and just plain easy and enjoyable to drink. I look forward to trying the other flavors they offer."
"Overall another solid intro into my delving into Lambics. I think they are starting to grow on me."
"pours a light hazy copper yellowish color with spare white fizzy head, spare lacing and average carbonation. peach boozey smell and strong fizzy peach taste. very sweet and tart and finishes the same. light bodied with a long flavor duration. very very sour. amazing brew, taste even better after sex."
"Going to the country going to eat a lot of peaches. Or drink a lot of peaches. Im not sure what else to say about this beer except its a lambic and tastes and smells like peaches. So if you'd had the other flavors, just substitute peach for whatever other fruit you've had. This one is tasty."
"D - Really easy to do for something that is sweet, it's helped by the tartness. It's pretty straight forward, but I enjoyed this a lot."
"Drinkability - Not so much in my opinion. Very, very sweet."
"Very sweet. Tastes of refined sugar, orange, lemon, and lime. Peach flavor is clearly present, but the flavor is overall sweet citrus. There is an abundance of carbonation and a terrific head and lacing in the glass. This is an unusual offering for the beer drinker. It may technically be a beer, but it drinks like Lancers wine with less alcohol. One bottle is probably enough; a second would cash out your taste buds with the overwhelming sweetness. Definitely worth a try, and if you like sweet, fruit beers you will love this."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is strong peaches with some light tartness. The flavor is strong syrupy peaches with a little bit of tartness. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. This has nothing in common with other Belgian lambics but as far as fruit beers go, this is a good one."
"Anna says: pair it with a nutty cheese like parrano."
"A pleasant fruit lambic, where, once again, a nice balance is struck between the fruit, grain, and yeasty funk. Something nice to sip on after a big meal, and somewhat dessert-like, inspiring thoughts of revisiting the 'local' (10-hour drive for me) orchard-strewn sunbelt strip ASAP."
"Drinkability is very high. Doesn't have any boozy elements to it, its very low in terms of its ABV, and it tastes fruity. Not really a beer I'd have too often, but for its style, a very good example. I'd have it again."
"In regards to which of the Lindeman's fruit lineup you'll enjoy the most, it really just comes down to what fruit flavor you prefer. Or, as is the case with me, what mood you're in. I thought I was in a peach mood, but now I'm not sure I actually was. No matter, with summer fast approaching, I'm sure a peachy mood will soon strike me."
"D: PERFECT with homemade coconut cake. I'll get this one again, easily."
"I've pretty much enjoyed every lambic I've had and this was no exception. The Peche pours a cloudy dark orange. It smells very sweet and you can definitely detect the peach flavor. The taste is similar. Very sweet peach flavor with just a bit of a sour finish. I highly recommend this lambic."
"It's very tart, so I'd recommend pairing it with some sunday brunch fair. Altogether a fantastic brew that is sure to surprise people unfamiliar with Lambics. The peach tastes fresh, which was a pleasant surprise."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of fruit in by brews but this is a refreshing drink. I'll probably split this bottle and be content."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink and would be perfect to pair with dessert."
"M/D: Not as great as the other fruit flavored Lindemans lambics. Still, a refreshing treat of a beer."
"D- The peach flavors are quite strong, the sweetness can become a little cloying near the end which limits me to just this one bottle."
"Drinkability: I really like the sour and fruit mix. It is reasonably complex for what it is. This is a great dessert beer that I could have several of."
"Good times had by all!"
"D: A good beer, anyone who likes peaches will like this. Not overtly fruity and sugary as the Framboise."
"Golden orange, with a decent head and good lacing. Smells like fuzzy peaches, but subtle and slightly dusty, not bad. The flavor is heavy on syrup and sugar with a bit of peach, like the stuff canned peaches sit in. This is way too sweet for me but I like peaches so I wanted to give it a fair shot. Lindemans needs to add some peaches to Cuvee Rene, that would be awesome."
"A big fluffy head and great lacing on a very cloudy orangish gold brew. A strong and sweet peach aroma with a bit of wild sourness and horse blanket. Taste is sweet and full of peaches. A nice tartness balances it with a touch of soap and funk. Still a bit sweet overall. A good dry finish brings grains and a clean juiciness. Crisp feel with a light medium weight. A dry quenching sensation as I drink. Even though the abv is low you really need a food to enjoy going through a bottle of this as the taste makes this on a sipper more that a quaffer."
"My wife's a big fan of this so I snagged a small glass out of her 750 for a review. The pour is golden orange with a bit of haze. Bright fluffy white head. Lots of sweet peach in the aroma. This is also echoed in the taste. There's a hint of sourness, but it is pretty tame. I've had this before and of the Lindemans, I've always preferred the apple. This lacks that punch of sourness that I enjoy. I'll stick to merely bummin' a sip of this every now and then."
"Pours a translucent golden orange color with a 1/2 white head that fell quickly leaving some sparse lacing in the tulip. Nice funk in the nose, much more so than their Kriek or Framboise, with a light peachy fruitiness. Not bad in the aroma department. Wow! I can't believe how much peach flavor this has, based on what was coming from the nose. Sweet orchard fruit, sugar syrup, light tartness and acidity, something that would have really made this beer sing if there had been a little more. Not bad at all, but maybe just a tad too sweet for my liking. Medium body with ample carbonation tingle. This is a tasty beer, but I'm pretty much done after one and couldn't see myself drinking more than one."
"Drinkability: this is one tasty beer, but it is among my least favorite of the Lindemans lambic flavors. I'd definitely drink it again, but not everyday."
"Overall, this is a very good lambic just because the flavor and aroma are very nice. I would LOVE this beer if both aroma and taste were a little stronger and pronounced and there was a tiny bit more complexity overall."
"Not a whole lot of flavors here that make one think of beer, but it is fairly tasty. Sweetness is waaay too much and the mouth puckering sourness that I enjoy so much in lambics is toned down quite a bit. Carbonation is very high, almost to the point of champagne. The peach flavors are very prevalent, and I am guessing have some artificial boosting additive. It tastes pretty decent, but a bit too sweet and a tad too expensive for me to want to buy again."
"Pours a clear and clean golden yellow with hints of orange. Pure white head that bubbles up and away quickly. Scent of fresh peaches with hints of hay and must. Taste is slightly tart peach, which the nose did not hint at. Faint hints of hay and must, minor candied sugar background (to offset tartness?). Thin body, crisp, carbonated slightly less than champagne, somewhat dry and little tart aftertaste. Pretty drinkable, wish i had a Dogfish Head Festina Peche for comparison purposes, but alas it is out of season."
"Two fingers of super frothy head, almost whipped up, bone white, slow to wind down, moderate cling in the lacing. Light orange to yellow in color, very clear but not close to watery, transparent though, close to hard cider in appearance. The nose very clearly expresses peach fruit, boisterously fresh, touch of lemon and orange citrus, golden honey glaze, lifts and spreads widely, not sure it's supposed to do more than this. Full-bodied, downy soft carbonation relieves heaviness yet sinks in all the way and requires effort to wash out of the palate. Huge, juicy peach with tang, the orange and lemon citrus a very able supplement, contributes to an uptempo pace and general mouthwatering quality. There's nothing here that isn't obvious from the start, however, no less impressive for it."
"Drinkability is high imo. Its just a very refreshing beverage."
"Drinkability: This is extraordinarily drinkable. Like I said above, barely even tastes like ""beer."" Really good and worth a try."
"Drinkability: The most drinkable beer I have ever had. Almost like drinking a sparkling fruit juice that has a few beer notes added on. Very different from the norm."
"D: Certainly different from my usual tastings, but not a bad brew overall. As I said little earlier, this has a good bit of a sparkling wine quality to it so it's probably good brew for folks who enjoy that style (like my wife when she's not pregnant, ha). Not a must try by any means, but a good brew none the less."
"Pours a partially cloudy orange color that forcefully produces little to no head. Really only a penline of white lace is visible around the perimeter of the glass reminiscent of a head. Lots of carbination in this beer with a light mouthfeel. Sourness dominates the taste both upfront and in the finish but also has quite a bit of peach sweetness as well. The nose of this beer is both sour from the yeast and sweet from the peaches."
"D: Highly drinkable...able to be guzzled. Wonderful summer/picnic selection."
"Obviously a sweeter lambic, and while I prefer the more traditional take on the style, I also find these sweet, fruity versions to be quite refreshing if done right. Don't go into this one expecting a huge lambic character... approach it more like a good fruit beer."
"Pours a golden honey color with a very small pure white head that settled into a ring. The aroma is of full frontal fruit. A sweet candied peach aroma with hints of apple; jolly rancher like characteristics. Big sweet sugary flavors, definitely fruity. The peach does peak out after the initial sweet blast. There is also some white grape and apple skin flavor to add a slight tartness. Again, does remind me of a jolly rancher. Moderate body with fizzy carbonation. It has a touch of a champagne quality but it quickly gets lost in the sweetness. Deliously sweet and fruity, with about 12ozs worth before it would get cloying. Very nice dessert brew"
"drinkability is decent. as far as beer goes, there is not really any maly or hop qualities, and no distinct yeast notes either. for what it is, it is well put together, but it ends up tasting like fruit juice with a light carbonation."
"Love this ale. Pours hazy golden color with slightly off-white head that fades away. Nose is peachy with funky farmhouse aromas in there too. Palate is very tart, peachy of course, and has a pleasant sweet/sourness to it. Finish is very long and peach lingers."
"Bottle at Chancey Smith's in London, ON- A hazy yellow pour, is topped with a frothy eggshell cap that leaves nice lace. Full on fresh peach aroma, some yeast, tart citrus, smells inviting. Tastes sweet and tart. Lots of peach of course with a tart citric component that balances the sweetness. A bit of hops lead to a grassy finish. Very peachy and not overly complex, but refreshing and enjoyable. Thanks for the bottle Milos!"
"This is a very unique beer, and I will buy it again and again."
"very easy drinking, but wouldnt want to have more than a few, too sugary."
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable upfront, but a little sweet to be having several of. Alcohol-wise you'd probably go into a diabetic coma before getting all that drunk, but taste-wise it's spot-on and easy to go through."
"Pours a golden orange clear color body with an average whitish head, quickly diminishing. Aroma of strong carbonated peaches, fresh from a can-like. Some effervescence, and soda likeness. Sweet syrupy taste, peaches and sugar. Carbonation. Refreshing. Doesn't pair necessarily well with spicy pizza."
"Very surprised by this beer but it has opened my eyes to the Lambic style and I know that is somewhere I would like to venture to. This would also be a great way to get someone into another style of beer."
"D - One could sit down and put back a bunch of these, but there is no need to hammer down what is more or less an aperitif."
"Drinkability- very good, I love it. It's like alcoholic peach juice."
"Poured from bottle at Eb's. Nice crisp clear straw color with good carbonation. Aromas of peach to be sure, and sweet at that. This is like candy water, peach flavored at that. You could easily polish off 5 or 6 bottles and not realize it until you couldn't walk straight. Karen loves this style."
"Overall, this was my first lambic and I really enjoyed it. This 25.4 oz bottle went down easy. I will be trying the other ones. I could see these being enjoyed any time of the year as well."
"The only thing that caught me off guard was the fact that this has a cork that requires a cork screw. This might show my limits but this is a first - I'm use to a cork that has a cage. I had to hunt down a cork screw. Regardless, very nice!"
"750ml green bottle corked and capped. Obtained at Hannaford's Supermarket Derry, NH. Golden in color slightly hazy with a half inch off white head that shortly lasted. fruity smell with a nice peach scent with a slight vinegar scent but not overly pronounced. peachy but not syrupy with a sour finish. reminds me of biting into a nice ripe sweet peach in the middle of summer. light and crisp mouthfeel. very drinkable beer especially for summer/early fall."
"I've never had anything that so well appealed to people who don't drink beer and yet could so well appeal to those that do."
"So I know I'm not very fond of peaches but I'll try not to let that interfere too much. Pours a clear golden jello with a nice head. Smells like peach cobbler and nothing more. Taste follows. Very thick, syrupy, sweet peaches, like those canned peaches you're saving for the next big earthquake. Nice enough."
"Light bodied and highly carbonated. 12 ounce pour is all one needs for night."
"D: Extremely sippable, gorgeously fruity brew. This is one I'll be recommending to all my friends, even the non-beer drinkers."
"Overall: A solid lambic with peaches added, not my favorite from Lindemans but still very tasty."
"Pours a hazy, bubbly honey-amber with a decent white head. Rather strong aroma is sweet and mainly of peach. Flavor is peachy and quite sweet, more like nectar or schnapps than beer, with an undertone of malt. Texture is very smooth and rather fizzy. A good dessert beer."
"Notes: I recommend that any beer enthusiast try a lambic at least once and this is a good one to try."
"I haven't had many lambics, but this was nice."
"I don't know if I could drink it all day, again it seems way too sweet at first but its not as thick as the flavour leads it to be. Very light but very flavourable. I would drink more if i had more."
"Poured into a champagne flute. Beer is a hazy golden color with a burnt orange tint. Yeast and peaches in the nose, smells enticing. Taste is very refreshing. Carbonation is ample and lends itself well. A nice sweetness to the beer and peaches are definitely there but are remarkably well balanced with the malts. Perhaps a bit too sweet to drink in large quantities but this beer would serve itself well as an aperitif or champagne substitute."
"Not a bad drop."
"Pours cloudy orange with a thin head. Smells like fuzzy peaches with some other fruity aromas and there is a little cork scent also. Very sweet peachy flavor at first that also mixes with maybe a little plum flavor that quickly dries out in a crisp finish. This is like candy beer."
"D - This is a specialty beer to me. I could drink this all day but would expect a sour stomach after a few bottles. This would be great to serve to a group or someone who doesn't like a ""typical"" beer."
"I've heard a lot of things about Lindemans lambics and this is my first go with Peche. I was pretty apprehensive about it to be honest. Despite the fact that it's merely above average beer, it is better than I expected. Based on what I'd heard, I wasn't expecting it to resemble beer much at all. I am surprised in that respect. Frankly, it's too sweet and just not my thing. That being said, it's alright and worth checking out."
"I split a bottle of this (corked, capped, and foiled) with my better half. The beer is hazy gold color with a wet foam that coats the glass while fading on the liquid. The aromas are fruity and yeasty, it smells a little like Koningshoeven Tripel but with some peach. The taste is just a little sour, a trace of bite with the first sip but there's a lot of sweetness to balance the tart. The taste becomes a little addictive, this is really a better beer than I expected. The body is full with good carbonation. I've passed on this beer for years, periodically getting the kriek or framboise, but really the peche is the best of them so far for me."
"Drinkability is very low for me a little to sweet for my liking but also a very good change of pace for once."
"For as fruity as this beer is it surprised me how refreshing it was. The peach flavor is syrupy but not annoyingly so."
"Overall, a pretty tasty brew. Like previously stated I'm not big on the style, but I wouldn't turn down one of these if it were offered."
"Drinkability is high."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good and fizzy. Drinkability is not that great. The sweetness becomes a bit cloying, and unlike Lindemans Pomme or Framboise, I don't think I would want more than one bottle. Still a good beer, but probably my least favorite Lindemans so far."
"All in all, a personal favorite of the Lindeman's lambics. Normally the framboise is the lambic that gets all the accolades, but this one is worth a try."
"I enjoy this combination: lots of peach, not as sour as some lambics. Very sweet. Full body along with a high level of CO2. I think Peche is my favorite lambic style. This may be my favorite Peche."
"Very fruity, flavorful beverage. Has enough of a beer taste though to make it reasonable. There's really not much else to say. If you're looking for a lambic, or any fruity beer for that matter, the buck stops here. Obviously, this is not something you're going to want to drink alot of, but this is a great quaff."
"D - not my favorite lambic, but still good"
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Other than being sweeter than I would have liked, this is a fine beverage that I would recommend to someone who doesn't like beer but would like to."
"Notes: It could have been really bad (peach and beer?) but it is very pleasant. It should be popular with those enjoying fruit beers."
"Very drinkable think a session champagne minus the dryness and bubbles"
"Drinkability: its exceptional you can drink this all day and especially on a hot day"
"Pours a golden orange color with thin white head. Aroma is very sour dominated by peach (of course) and alcohol. Very nice balance of tart sourness and sweet pech flavor. Better than I expected based on it's appearance and aroma."
"Bottle bought a few months ago at the State Liquor Store. I have to be in the right mood to enjoy this, and it was pretty nice. Pours out a initially quite large white head that goes down to almost nothing. A beautiful clear copper body. The aroma is...well what do you expect peaches, both sweet canned kinds and a more natural tart kind. The taste was similar; it leaned towards a sugary sweet peach flavor, but some balance is achieved by a more tart flavor. Fizzy and highly carbonated. Not bad at all."
" I would drink this stuff again. Its good and refreshing. More of a summer thing, I guess."
"D - Overall, a very good beer. Very easy, drinking, but a little slightly sweet."
"Poured from a cool, 355-ml bottle that is both capped and corked, beer has the color of apple juice and has a sparkling white head. The smell is definitely peaches, it reminds me of a peach jam my mom used to make - sweet but not overly so. The taste is also peachy, but there is a malt-grain background that reminds you that you aren't drinking a wine cooler. Not too sweet, the wild yeast has created a slight sour-tart note that complements the mix quite nicely. The carbonation has a silky, creamy feel to it while the lambic itself has a slight acidic, tart, mouth-drying effect. This is a very drinkable lambic, probably one of the better ones."
"D: This is an awesome beer if you are in the mood for dessert... and I always am! Decent look and smell with a GREAT taste!"
"Very drinkable in my book. Could easily have 2-3 before it gets old."
"It was a fleshy yellow, with next to no head. Bold, blunt, unashamedly candid peach flavor, with subtleties of malt and grains. It turned out to be a perfect way to end the night, but there are other beers that I have enjoyed a lot more for way less money. At nearly five bucks a bottle, you'd have to be a serious fan of the style."
"Overall I like this one best of the Lindeman Lambics but if they could just tone down the sweetness a bit I'd like it a bit more."
"I enjoyed drinking this, but will probably not buy it again due to the price and the fact that it does not really taste like a beer. But hey, I guess that's not really what a fruit beer is supposed to be like."
"Overall this is a delicious beer. One of my favorites from Lindeman's."
"This would be a good starter beer for people who have not had beer before. It's also a good beer to have on a hot summer day while hanging out with some friends."
"D: Not very high. This is one to sip and savor."
"Simple but good is the way I see this one, it's really quite gorgeous."
"Tastes of peach juice, a bit of tartness, faint pale malts and sweetness. Very enjoyable fruit beer/lambic."
"Thought I would give this one a try. Nice cloudy orange with a lacy beige head. The nose has tart peaches and musky oak. Taste is very sweet with a faint fruit sour. A crisp light body is quite refreshing. A little too sweet, but still a fine beverage."
"D- Not my favorite of the Lindeman's offerings, but not bad at all. I think this one goes a little too sweet without throwing you the sourness to dry out the finish making the drinkability a little lower than the others."
"Great sour taste throughout balanced with a very nice sweetness. Light carbonation, low alcohol and great taste made this a very drinkable and very enjoyable drink."
"D- Very drinkable in an endless way"
"Too sweet and soda like, I couldn't have too much of this one."
"Tasted like juice, I couldn't find the 'beer' in it. Smelled amazing, tasted just as it smelled. Lots of fruit juices. I couldn't specifically pick out the peach but it was definitely in there somewhere. This was very comparable to the Leinenkugel's Berry Weis for me. Only the Lambic was smoother/ easier to drink and tasted less sprakling. I would recommend this beer to all. I wish it had a higher ABV though."
"D - This is a pretty good fruit lambic. I prefer peach flavored beers to most others."
"Poured into a tulip glass and received a cider-like body with a mountainous head that died quickly but left lace patches thanks to an immense carbonation. A hoppy smell with sour peach notes and a light sweet malt smell; reminded me of a white wine or a heavy apple juice smell. Very smooth, almost slick and buttery, this light-to-medium bodied beer maintains a distinct peach taste and is also sweet. Finished with a drying backbite from a hopkick that put up minor citric notes. Maybe a tad too sour and fruity for a sessioning, but I gladly look forward to having this again."
"D: One of the best fruit beers I've down in my drinking pedigree. A good mix of flavors and enjoyable through and through."
"Great for porch drinking on a hot summers evening. Very satisfying."
"i was scared of this one, i have avoided this one for ten years, but i had tryed all the outhers so i figured why not try this one, i found that i have been mising out, this one is like peach pie in a glass, the lambic is nice and the peach starts nice and tart and fades into pure sweetness, i will get this one agan and agan for sure."
"Drinkability- Very nice lambic, even if it is technically fake."
"decent, but only just to mix things up."
"D - I wouldn't have more than one of these, but it is very enjoyable. Not quite as strong and sour as the framboise."
"I wouldn't want to drink this all the time but I would definitely have it every now and again. I must try this on my wife...."
"Nice and crisp, tingly, good carbonation."
"It was hard to tell where the peach stopped and the beer began. GREAT WORK. One of my favorite aspects of drinking lambics is simply being confused and thrown around in an ocean of creativity."
"This lambic has a orangy-yellow appearance, and I poured a one finger white-orange head. It has an obvious peach smell, but there are also traces of vinegar and oak. It has a very nice taste, at first it is sour with a definite peach flavor. The longer it sits, the sweeter it becomes. It has a very sugary peach flavor at the end. Mouthfeel is very acidic, carbonated. This is a drinkable beer that has an ever-changing flavor thoughout the drink. The high acidity does have the potential to give you heartburn."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D-Excellent, and a good blend of light flavors and sweet aroma with well-balanced body and carbonation."
""
"Pours a clear bubbly orange to gold with a bright white head. Slight funkiness in the nose with just a hint of vinegar and a lot of juicy peach aroma. Taste is sweet and sour peach with just a hint of funky yeast and even less of a beer like malt backdrop. Tartness helps balance it to keep it short of cloying, but it could still be a bit less sweet overall. Comes off much like a peach spritzer with a nice bubbly body, that is easy to drink."
"D- This would be one for desert or just to drink beer, but not with a meal. It is very tasty and I would defiantly go for it again. It is very sweet and I probable would not be able to drink a number of them because of the sweetness"
"This beer is the first that I have ever gotten to share a substantial amount of with my wife after many many unsuccessful attempts. Therefore it is a huge winner in my book. Thanks Lindemans!"
"Easy to drink but restrained by the deep sweetness, Lindemans Peche is delicious, light, and refreshing, a great way to cap off the night. Dessert beer, and definitely recommended."
"Light peach color with an ample white head. Cloudy and very effervescent. Aromas of canned peaches, no sign of wildness in this beer. Taste is pretty much carbonated peach juice with a smidgeon of tartness. Tastes somewhat artificial. Very bubbly and drinkable, makes a great dessert beer."
"D: Delicious Lambic. If they weren't so expensive I could easily drink more than one. Lindemans has mastered this beer. It gets no better!"
"Poured from the big bottle into a pint glass. Slightly hazy gold, with a soapy white head. Nose is yeasty sour peach and green apple. Taste is tangy peach, sweet and sugary. Not very beery, but good anyways. Mouthfeel is surprisingly great. Exceptionally drinkable, especially at 4%."
"D: Drinks like peach flavored juice with almost no alcohol detection at all. Drank exceptionally smooth and clean. a tad sugary sweet which may limit multiples."
"D = An extremely good dessert drink."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of clear gold, with a ton of sedement, with a white colored head - nose of peaches, some sourness, and candied sweetness  taste of sweet and sour peaches, nice and tart, and robust- body is full smooth, and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of dried apricot, sweet, and tart"
"This was a tasty desert beer. I'm not an expert on lambics, so it was hard to detect any flavors from the yeasts used. I found that many non-beer drinkers enjoyed this, but I found it to be a bit sweet for my taste as well as pricey in a lot of areas. Well brewed, nonetheless. Give it a try!"
"A good offering but lindemans has done much better. Once again this is not a traditional sour lambic. pours yellow pink and cloudy. smells like musty peach, no head. Taste is peachy but more like peach flavored yogurt. very smooth and goes down easy. A great gift for that special lady would include the lindemans cassis, framboise, pomme, and peche. They are tasty in a desert kind of way. almost like juices. I like em but they are by no means traditional lambic in taste and mouthfeel, despite being brewed in belgium. But dont get me wrong as far as taste i like these better than sour lambics. I know that is wierd but I just cant do sour in my beer."
"i could drink these every day, but i don't. this is a great beer at night after a nice meal. i'd love to have a piece of pound cake with it."
"Poured into a stange, the color is a faded orange topped by a fuzzy white head. The flavor in this one is pretty straight-forward, some peaches, balanced by some sourness, with a trace of malts. Did I mention it's delicious? Who needs orange juice for the morning when you can serve yourself a peach lambic? I'll definately have this another time, but it's a little pricey to have everyday."
"Maybe I gush too much over beers like this. However, it's not often that you find a fermented fruit beverage that beats the pants off of hard cider. Lambics are almost not like beers to me. Definitely drinkable though!"
"Drinkability: Excellent. However, it is a fruit beer so it's best for special occasions and meals so as not to wear out its charm."
"Drinkability: Not too shabby for my first peach beer. I wouldn't consider this a session beer for me, but worth trying."
"Fine as an aperitif, sweet enough but not full bodied or strong enough to be a digestif, I suppose this is a fine introduction into the world of lambics, but it's so almost entirely a different character that it really does nothing except introduce the idea that some beers have sweetness and sourness to them. Nothing to dislike here, I'll have it again, I'm sure, but it's nothing I get cravings for."
"D - A tasty change of pace in the beer world, and a bit less shocking that some other Lambics I've tasted. Worth trying out and perhaps cooking with."
"I have little experience with Lambics and the style guidelines, that said I thought this was a fantastic Lambic. Poured like a champegne with a wonderful peach colored cloudy appearance. Good aroma of peaches with slight sour smell. Tasted wonderful, nice peach flavor but not overpowering. Maybe too sweet for some tastes, but I thought the sweetness was nicely balanced with the sourness which makes this style unique. Very drinkable, could have easily went through more bottles. A bit pricey, but thats to be expected with this unique style I guess. Wonderful beer for special occasions."
"Another great offering from this great brewery. This is a great lambic. There is no mistaking it is a peach lambic. the peach is moderate to strong in flavor, somewhat sweet, a bit tart, but it balances well. this is a refreshing beer that happens to have a sweet taste and is a fruit based beer. again not all fruit beers are bad, were not talking about smirnoff or bacardi crap here, this isnt something sweet just to chug and get wasted, this is a beer to drink fo rthe enjoyment of drinking it, not just the buzz."
"Bottom line: I really enjoy the fruit Lambics from Lindemans. I recommend them."
"D - Remarkably drinkable for a lambic. Best Ive had in the Lindemans line and probably my favorite Lambic to this point outside of Liefmans. Ridiculously smooth that matches the low abv. Pleasure to drink."
"Overall this was very good, and she enjoyed it alot, which was even more important. I now have a jumping off point for her to get her into some of the bigger beers. This was a damn fine lambic, and I will keep a few around in case she wants some more."
"Overall: This one is a perfect dessert beer or one for those special occasions. It would be nice to buy several 750 ml bottles and pop them on a special occasion or when guests are over. It's a nice single glass beer. Perfect sweetie tartness. I would buy it again"
"D- I could have one of these 25ozers on a good night. That's it though. Too sweet for anymore. Great Lambic though."
"D - This is more drinkable than Lindemans other offerings, and it is more beer-like than the Kriek, Pomme, or Framboise. An extremely refreshing, but cloyingly sweet brew. I like lambics for their tartness and complexity, and this lacks both of those important compnents."
"Easy for somebody who doesn't like beer to try, but not necessarily representative of the style. There is too much sweetness and not enough tartness or even maltiness here for a lambic. I've heard they add peach syrup instead of actual peaches, which might explain this. Nonetheless, pleasant enough to drink."
"While I may not be the biggest fan of peaches, this is one of the few types of lambics I have not tried, so i decided i'de try a bottle. Poured a bright golden color...nothing that stuck out for me too much to be honest. Smell was pleasent, with soft peach flavor, juicy nectar, and sweet sugar. Taste was incredibly similar to apple juice...not too sweet, not too sour. Starts off very juicy, then ends off on a dry note. I would say mouthfeel was medium, in that it was sort of syrupy. Not bad on the drinkability scale, but one bottle of this was enough for me. I think next time I will stick with the kriek or the framboise, but still very interesting. Cheers"
"Was expecting a higher ABV brew out of lambics, but I guess I had the wrong interpretation of the style. Poured a hazy, hefe looking color with all cream head and laced the sniffer very nicely, but for me, it all went downhill after that. The smell was very nice and peach, but the taste was tart and hard to drink. I got a sick, quesy feeling after finishing off a bomber, not a good feeling either. My stomach was churning like hell as was my gag reflex...the mouthfeel is quite heavy however, I'm assuming because of the fruit additives, but because of its tartness and wear on my stomach, I don't think I'll be revisting the fruit lambics for awhile...I considered this more peach champange than beer, and I didnt even feel a buzz for what its worth"
"The mouth seems about right for this type of beer. Its a bit soft with low levels of carbonation. Drinkability is a tough call. I would revisit this again, but not on a regular basis."
"D: This lambic goes down very easily, like drinking juice. This is my first lambic and I found it quite interesting. It's not something I'll have all the time but it definitely has it's time and place for the appropriate use. Plus my wife liked it and she's not the biggest beer fan in the world."
"Quite a nice -- and different -- beer. I'm sure this would appeal to those who don't really like beer, but I also find it appealing from a beer-enjoyer's perspective: there's much more than just the peach flavor. Could work well with a light meal, or just on it's own on a warm evening."
"Drinkability is high for the style but I still would not want more than one of these. The sweetness can become somewhat overwhelming. If you;re in the mood for it, though, this is a nice choice."
"The aroma is intensely yeasty and has a light peach in the background. Sweetness is still very upfront in this beer, but scaled back by that crazy yeastiness. Kind of reminds me of mead. Things finally balance out in the finish and this is where peach flavor finally emerges. Mouthfeel is light, with little carbonation. I found this to be the best of the Lindemann's flavored lambics."
"Good if you like peach. My wife really enjoyed it. Not really my type of beer - more like a peach soda."
"Into a pint glass, pours a lovely peach color (big surprise), with good head but little lacing. The aroma is a lovely fruity bowl of yumminess. The taste is peach in all its glory, sweet and tart. I have a need for some kind of fruit beer every so often, and this one fills that gap greatly. Another yummy beer from those crazy Belgians."
"Most definitely the best fruit beer I've ever had, and quite possibly one of the best beers period that I've ever drank. I highly recommend this as a truly spectular special occasion beer."
"It felt lovely on the palate, smooth and drinkable. Very nice to find it on tap."
"Cost at my local North Coast Coop here in Eureka, CA was $9.45. Poured a hazy gold and left a small head that was gone in a jiffy. Big nose of peaches and some spices I cannot identify. Smooth palate. Taste is sweet but not overpowering. Very unique and nice to drink. Amazing how many good Fruit Lambics Lindemans can produce."
"This brew has a bery golden and champagne like body, which is slightly hazy. It is heavily carbinated and creates a sticky white head that hugs the rim all the way to the end. It does have a very peachy aroma, but I can detect doughy hints of malt. With this, it reminds me of peach cobbler."
"This is a light yellow-orange cloudy beer with a high amount of carbonation initially. The carbonation goes away fairly quickly. It smells of apple and peach initially. This is a very sweet beer even compared to the other Lindemans beers. It has strong peach flavors, but just as many apple flavors as well. It is a very carbonated beer and very tingley on my tongue. I'm not crazy about peaches in general, but the drinkability is still fairly low. I would rather drink the framboise or cassis instead."
"Have to try all of the Lindemans' beers that are availablet to me. The color is a clear, yet light and pale orange. Very light bubbling and no head left after a minute or two. The aroma is very butterscotchy with a very faint hint of peaches. A little off putting. Different, but not expected. The taste is definetly moire peachy and earthy with a very strong butterscotch and light cream backbone. very odd taste for a fruit lambic in my opinion. Not bad though. Light dry palate with strong sweetness. Nice to sip after dinner. Would not have more than one in an evening. But the Framoise on the other hand..."
"Honestly I don't think that I could have more than one in a sitting because of the sweetness. If you really like fruit beers or sweet drinks in general, this may be good for you. I think If it wasn't sweetened and the tartness was able to shine through, this would be a much better beverage."
"The style is not my cup of tea but I'm really glad that i tried it. I will definitely be sampling the companies other products."
"Hazy light caramel orange colour with a short cap of white foam composed of bubbles of mixed sizes. The head quickly fell to a coarse ring leaving a smattering of lace (subsequent sips produced a lot more fine lace). A little funky barnyard aroma with some earthiness, ripe peach, and very mild pie spice. Pretty nice! Very sweet and syrupy, kind of cloying, with lots of peach flavour and mild tartness. That pretty much sums it up. Medium carbonation with a heftier body than expected, palate coating initially but slightly drier by the finish. Fairly creamy texture. Not a bad entry in the Lindemans line. I really enjoyed the aroma, but was let down a bit by the heavy sweetness, which limits the drinkability."
"Capped and corked 750 ml bottle decanted into my chalice. It pours clear orange (peach?) in color with minimal head. Aroma is of peaches and little else. Taste is of peaches as well, more sweet than tart as a good peach should behave. Mouthfeel is thick, but not syrupy with crisp carbonation. Its was a nice dessert beer to accent my New Year's Day meal."
"Cheers!"
"Peachy through and through, from the appearance to the nose to the flavor. This was the thickest and least carbonated of the Lindemans beers I've had yet. It made the beer seem a bit syrupy, so drink this one very cold. Cold is also useful to combat the sweetness, which is boarderline too much. I've always liked the base lambic, and the peaches accent it very nicely. This beer is refreshing and pairs good with a wide variety of food. Not one of my favorite lambics, but very good nonetheless. Recommended. Lindemans is a great family of beers to introduce to people with a ""macro""-scopic view of the beer world. Cheers!"
"What a surprise. I loved it. So did my wife and daughter. With only 4% ABV, you could drink this all night long -- and I just might, some time!"
"Overall a very good Lambric, and it comes in an odd bottle cork and cap, how queer. A must try. Cheers."
"I found this beer and it's champagne bubbles very pleasant and drinkable."
"Drinkability- Like drinking peach concentrate... so very drinkable just like all the other Lindemans lambics."
"Just a solid lambic from Belgium."
"Overall, a nice beer to change things up. Lately i havent wanted much carbonation, and this did a great job quenching my thirst."
"Not bad, but not much like beer. Very sour, but kinda tasty."
"I was dissapointed that the concotion did not taste like Peaches."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and only mildly carbonated."
"Taste is quite refreshing and very enjoyable. A bit fizzy and thin on the mouthfeel. A great beer to drink in the summer I would think. Tastes like peach soda. If you dont like peaches, you may not like this. It isnt sour however. Nice tartness and sweetness altogether. I enjoyed this one."
"It has a light mouthfeel, like a nice sparkling wine, but of course much sweeter than what you would get in that area. It's easy to go through a 750ml bottle of thise stuff without even realizing that you've started. Thankfully, its alcohol content is not outrageous."
"The only probem I can see is that the sweetness sets some people up with the idea that all lambics are sweet. Since the Lindemans sweetened lambics are far more prevalent than pretty much every other style of lambic available in the U.S. this happens far too often, and people don't want to try a more traditional (dry/sour) styles."
"The only reason I would not be able to drink more of Lindemans Peche is because it is a fruity style. Personally I enjoy one or two fruitish beers and that's my fill, the same with this one. I did really enjoy the one I had. It was very smooth, and thicker than I expected, but most certainly not too thick."
"In a goblet, this beer forms a white surface lace. The body is a tawny, transparent yellow gold, when I try to describe it. My girlfriend simply says, ""peach."" The nose is 100% sweet peach, which smells great. The taste is sugary, intense peach. Simple, but good. The mouthfeel is viscous, with low carbonation. Could use more. This is a wonderful dessert beer, although the acid builds up if you have too much by yourself. Share a 12 oz bottle with at least one person!"
"It's a nice peach lambic. I highly reccommend it."
"Overall: Another solid offering from Lindemans. A great afternoon beer for the spring or summer time. Holds up well and exhibits nice, refreshing peach flavors without being over the top."
"Overall: Of the Lindemans line up, the Pêche certainly is one of the easier ones to get along with. It could be better but honestly I found the sweetness to be the only true distraction here. Nice to revisit this one chilled on a hot day, but not one that I would regularly pick up from the shelves."
"All in all not a bad beer, but I like Lindeman's Rasberry alot better."
"Maybe the better of the Lindemans fruit beers. Still very sweet with a mild, but very sweet peach / apple flavor. Tart to offset sweetness. Certainly an after-dinner drink. Sweet to an almost cloying sense. Lightly syrupy and velvety texture with a sugar-sweet finish and lingering. Not overly strong as with the Framboise. Quite similar to the Pomme, but with a richer fruit flavor and texture. Solidly cider-ey but with a serious beer undertone. Enjoyable, but only on occations. No keg-stands for me."
"This was one incredibly yummy lambic, and one that you should definitely try."
"This lambic is just way too drinkable. Perfect any time and any day of the week. I might be a tad subjective because I really like peaches, but this is one great beverage."
"Plenty of head, great peach coloured body. Full of character. Another Lindeman's product I'm tempted to mark as the highest rated fruit beer I've had. Good aroma, well present. A gritty, rippened fruit flavour. Flavour well developed, candy like taste - only authentic! Well suited for anyone's taste in my opinion"
"This was my first Lambic and I don't think I was prepared, lol."
"Tastes pretty much like it smells, although the peach flavor is nowhere as dominate as their Framboise. Fairly tart and sweet yet crisp, with hints of malt and little hops noticable. Very drinkable and surprisingly well balanced."
"Had as an occassional treat since reviewing - and consistently good brew...the peaches don't interfere with the ""beer"" qualities as much as some sweeter lambic fruits do."
"Wonderful light peach flavors. Not overly carbonated, with the same zingy wheat flavors as in the nose. Somewhat of a lackluster finish. And the RS keeps it from being in the high ranks of drinkability. But a good lambic if you're into the sweet style like this."
"beats the more common framboise by a long shot"
"Sweetish but very good on tap at the Old Toad,"
"Emma really loved this one and says she could drink 5 right now...so I digress."
"An OK fruit lambic, but maybe not one of the most complex ones."
"Not an everyday beer, but on a special occassion I'd love to pop a cork on this for dessert."
"Yeah."
"Medium bodied, sticky, and lip smacking good. Not more than one 750 per sitting, but it is very refreshing and quaffable due to the low abv%. Say what you will about Lindemans, they are great for what they are."
"Served on tap into a Lindemans flute, this is a light copper color, active carbonation evident, a finger of white head without much retention. Slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is all peaches, fairly strong, not overly sweet, very nice. Taste is a nice smooth peach, sweet but never cloying, finishing just slightly tart, very nice lingering peach aftertaste. This is a one note beer, as most of these fruity Lindeman beers are, but it really hits that note wonderfully. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, not as fizzy and bubbly as when served from a bottle, this makes it better IMO. This is probably the best of the Lindeman beers that Ive had."
"Very drinkable, but maybe only one at a time for me. More than one beer this sweet in a sitting might be a bit much."
"Good and drinkable. I only buy singles of this, one at a time but very drinkable none the less."
"My favorite of the Lindeman's offerings. Looks like a regular beer with its dull golden color with medium fizzy head. Smells like peaches with some hay in there and some nice Lambic notes. A bit of a tartness as well. Peaches are dominant and they control the flavors. It almost tastes like fresh picked whole peaches in here. There's a tart granny smith quality underneath which cuts the sweetness of the peach. Then there's a nice little acidic finish but the notes of peaches remains the whole time. Body seems fuller than any other Lindemans offerings and the carbonation is not overdone. Very enjoyable."
"This lambic poured an orange gold color and the white head formed a ring around the edge of my glass that left little spots of laces. Smelled of a wonderful musky and dirty yeast with a little cranberry and syrupy peaches and a slight bit of mushroom. Tasted of huge buttery peaches and sweet cream with a slight sour snap to it. The wild yeast was present and blended delightfully into the fruit flavors livening up their sourness. Mouth feel was medium bodied and sticky with a light carbonation."
"I could easily drink this beauty in the spring and summer with an assortment of light dishes. It is almost like a peach soda that has a fine balance of sweet and tart. Nice stuff."
"D - Very, very drinkable. It is like a peach soda, without such a cloying sugar presence (sugar IS present though). Definitely a dessert beer, a light dessert of course, like fruit sorbet, not a tiramisu. This is delicious, if you like peaches, I recommend this. If you dislike peaches, then you would be an idiot to look for it."
"D: A little sweet for drinking more than a glass or two of (didn't finish the bottle), but this is really good. I like the Lindemans Framboise a little bit better than this, and could probably drink more of that than this in a sitting."
"good drinkability for such a sweet beer. overall i was very impressed. make no mistake this is a bit girly, but held my attention for the whole bottle. it is very good and worth a try."
"D - Could drink this like soda. Its very easy and pleasant to drink. Its flavor is something you just cant get enough of. Gives me peach burps, which are also pleasant."
"This beer pours a hazy orange has a 1/2 finger white head with good retention and great lacing that clumps on the glass. The aroma is of tart apples and peaches. This beer is medium bodied, dry and champagne-like. I couldn't drink this beer every day but its nice to pull out for special occasions."
"This is the most drinkable lambic from Lindemans by far. IMO."
"Perfect beer to start a session or for an after dinner brew just to ease you back into the swing of things. Very easy to drink, keeps my interest throughout. Chicks may dig this brew as it has ""some"" wine cooler qualities although much more bitter."
"Lindemans Peche is pretty good beer if one enters into the experience with the right attitude. I doubt that I'll ever buy another, but this bottle has brought me back a step or two from my peachophobia."
"An excelent peach lambic. The beer poured a nice peachy golden color with a nice white head. The smell was very friuty and sweet, full of peaches and a bit of an apricot scent. When I sipped the beer the flavor of peaches exploded in my mouth followed by a nice dry sourness that counteracted the sweetness perfectly. Definantly a great desert beer and one that may cross over some non beer drinkers."
"The flavor is very definitely PEACH. It starts sweet but not quite like peach soda - more like a peach cobbler, as it is quickly followed by a very pleasant tartness and a yeasty/biscuity overtone, finishing slightly sour for a nice clean finish that leaves you wanting more. Definitely a desert ale, either stand alone or with an appropriate fruit dish."
"Poured from a green bottle, corked and capped. Pours a hazy gold colour, with a fizzy white head. Wonderful peachy aroma. Some tartness, but mostly sweet, syrupy peaches. Body was crisp and clean. Taste bursting with peach flavours, and some apple. Very juicy and sweet. Could use a tad bit more tartness to balance it out. Overall, a delicious beer. However, it still takes a back seat to their Framboise."
"I think I will share the rest of this bottle with my wife who prefers wine. I would call this the ultimate cross over drink from Wine to Beer. Very tasty and I think I will have to keep some of this on hand for those rare times I don't feel like drinking a ""normal"" beer."
"About $9 or $10 for a 750ml bottle."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thick, meaty, mouth-coating consistency... surprised at the viscosity of this beer, considering the appearance. Finishes sour enough to suffice as a great aperitif, and fruity enough to accompany dessert after a meal. Well done."
"My first lambic, and I must admit I am impressed. Even my beer-hater wife liked it. Poured out to a slightly cloudy yellow color with a nice head and good lace around the glass. Odors of sweet peaches and sour sugar were present, as was a slighly bile like odor that reminded me of vomit. Seriously. Alas, this wasn't enought to deter me from drinking it. Taste was very sweet, but not syrupy or overly powering. Very peachy, with a sugar like after taste. Yet, I must say again, not overpowering. This is not a bad drink. Finished sweet with some malt like flavors. This is more like a really kick ass wine than a beer, but still, very drinkable. Recommended for people just getting into lambics."
"Opinion: Golly gee, this beer still tastes like Kool-aid! I mean, dont get me wrongit is a wonderfully flavored beer. The Peach is just such a sweet and dominant force in the entire flavor profile that it completely obscures the fact that you are drinking the product of spontaneous fermentation at all. I would prefer it retain some of the wild characteristics. I have one more bottle of Peche. We'll see what a couple more years doe for it."
"Pours hazy gold. Dense head. Aroma peach is also a strong flavor element that covers malt/hops. Although the peach is very dominate it was not objectional ( I like peaches). Medium body and dextrinous mouthfeel. Strong carbonation make this sweet and fruity Lambic great with a dessert."
"Pours a very lively,well carbonated, hazy golden color. Nice aroma-some peach in there. Slight yeast in the backround. Mellow sweetness throughout. Good full peach flavor. Somewhat tart but well balanced with a nice fruitiness. I dont find this Lambic screams fruit like the Kriek did. Very well rounded and the fruit has a nice softness to it. Good body-like the Kriek its hard to believe its so low in ABV. A very drinkable beer indeed. Quite enjoyable all around."
"Wow this is a crushing taste of peach. The almost peachy color of this beer that has almost no head but plenty of carbonation sets up what the rest of the beer will be. It has an intense peach nose and the beer is sweet smelling too. The taste is tongue pulverizing a sweet lambic with a touch of souring characteristics and nothing but peach for miles around. It has a pleasent aftertaste that lingers of peach and a resonating sweetness. As I work my way through this one the taste deadens the senses and eventually it becomes more and more palatable. For sure this is not a session beir, but it is enojyable as a twelve ounce desert."
"1cm of fizzy white head is dirty around the edges. The clear gold beer has some orange to it. Nose is extreme peach: tart, not too sweet. Good. The front is full of sweet, perfumey peach flowers. The middle is a thick peach syrup. The finish is sugary sweet. There's a little tart funkiness, but not enough for me. Not bad. It's still too sweet for me, but definitely better than the Framboise."
"A very pleasant drinking experience. Super refreshing. Maybe a bit more malt flavor would make it go over the top."
"A nice, decent peach lambic. Felt like my teeth were going to rot, but"
"All I have got to say about this beer is that it makes champagne taste like a cheap American macro (mixed with Taaka vodka). This beer is the most subtle of the Lindeman's lambics, with a very sublime peach flavor that very thirst quenching. I couldn't stop sipping mine once I tried it at first. It is like a Kool-Aid for beer lovers. A must try brew."
"Won't drink this again when I'm in the mood for a good beer, but would be great with a nice meal instead of wine. Very good for drinking in mixed company that might find most other decent beers to be too challenging."
"Drinkability and Overall: Good stuff for sure. I have loved each and every lambic I had before this, and I love this one. I guess if you don't like the style, you wouldn't like this as it provides nothing unique. It's still a great beer that can (and will) keep me sipping all night long."
"A very good beer well worthy of a strong passing mark."
"Pours a hazy medium gold with a high carbonation, a 2 finger head that had mediocre longevity, but good lace. Smell of sweet peach, sort of like a wine cooler but with some malt aromas mixed in. Tart apples smells also noted - not much, if any, hop aroma detected. Taste is not bad.the flavor of sweet peach is the first noticable flavor followed by a subdued wheat malt. Sour apple flavors also detected. Very spritzy. My wife enjoyed it and refered to it as a ""girly beer"". It is what it is - a peach lambic. A very nice and tasty lambic, but not one I could drink several bottles of in one sitting. Its a bit too sweet for me. A nice change of pace but not a good choice for a session beer."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours well ... the colour of peach juice. light orangy with a hint of red. No real head to speak of, but it bubbles up like a nice sparkling wine. Aroma is very fruity, with just the slightest hint of a sour note. Taste is tart and of sweet peaches, almost in a canned peach sort of way. There is just a note of lambic sourness that creeps in and helps this from being cloying. Mouthfeel is good nicely carbonated which helps it from being too too sweet. Drinkability is a little above average. A bit too sweet. This would be a one and done apertif or dessert beer. Sweeter and less tart than the raspberry which lessens the drinkability"
"Drinkability- This has always been one of my go to beers on special occasions. I bit sweet to slam a few bottles, but it's about as drinkable as it gets. Everyone I know personally loves this lambic."
"i feel like i have been putting a lot o diclaimers in front of reviews lately but here it goes, i dont like peaches and this is only my 5th lambic, so deal..creamy baje beer with a hearty white head. looks lighter towards the bottom. smells of grass and peaches from a can. my best taste analogy is a peach creamsaver(i dont know if they really have one but work with me) with an acidic center. i dont know why i bought a peach beer, but i'd already tryed the rasberry one and was trying boon's kriek. also wood and grassy ntoes in there as well. my stomach feels like is is rotting from the inside out so low drinkability. mothfeel if very full, and thick, and syrupy, it hink this is part of the reason it reminds me of a creamsaver."
"Smaller bottle, classy with foil, cork and a cap. Pours slightly hazy, orangy, amber. Tiny bubble film remains after a minute or two of the pour. long stringy, relaxed lacing on the glass. Nose is fruity, sweet and delicate. Lucious melons, peaches, fruits of a thousand nations flow in the glass. Not nearly as sour as some other Lambics I've tried, this one is sweet and tasty. Great with desert, berries, ice cream etc etc."
"Its a light orange mustard color with a little haze. A slightly yellow-white head. Smells like peaches, but also smells a little sour. Taste is sweet, bursting with peaches, and the tartness sets in about halfway though your sip. The tartness lingers. I thought it was a bit too sour, but this is the first fruit lambic that I have ever had. I would say its pretty good, if your looking for something fruity. I could see this for dessert, or drinking with dessert. I look forward to trying their other varieties."
"For too sweet a fruit beer for me. Needs more underlying sourness."
"Drinkability and overall: My wife liked this one so it must not be too close to beer! I enjoyed the departure from the ordinary. I would probably save this for special occasions and times when I wouldn't mind sharing with non-BA's."
"Has a silghtly cloudy amber color with a medium white head and some lace. The aroma is distinictly sour with a peach essence in the background. The flavor is sour at first with the peach sweetness settling in at the finish. Refreshing and easy drinking."
"Incredible beer drinking experience. It was like drinking nectar, very smooth, velvety beer tasting of sweet, fresh peaches. I just kept shaking my head at how really good this beer was, perfect for a desert drink and appealing to just about anyone. Shares more qualities with a wine or mixed drink than a beer. I would imagine this would be phenominal in recipes."
"Light-medium in body and high carbonation levels create a crisp mouthfeel. The fruit flavors ride on the tongue briefly after swallowing. Nicely drinkable, but one can not have a few of these without having a fruity sweetness overload."
"Re-reviewed on 8-29-04, and I'm delighted that I gave this one another try. This time, the essence of tree ripe peaches was all over the nose and palate. Each sip was like munching into a sweet, South Carolina, peach with fuzzy skin and all. Quite tasty."
"Overall, a delicious lambic that I'd be happy to pick up again."
"Pours a hazed golden orange with a fluffy beige head. Peaches and sweet apples dominate the nose. Some gariny notes, but nothing that sets of any bells that this is really a lambic. Extremely sweet flavors of peach with a slight bit of green apple tartness in the finish. Too sweet for my liking. I'm sure sugar is added. I suppose it good if you like peaches and have a serious sweet-tooth."
"Hazy apricot coloured body wearing little to no head. Terribly sweet peach aroma with distinct sugar character. Restrained brett and mild barnyard character tries to come out as it warms, but remains annihilated by the fruit. Not much acidity at all, very uni-dimensional. Soft medium body with high carbonation. Very disappointing and expensive (6.99/375ml)"
"Bottle: Poured an orange colored beer with a nice huge head. Aroma is simply comprised of a nice peach nectar. Taste is also mostly comprised of peach with a subtle tart finish. This is probably one of the most refreshing beers that I had the chance to taste, sometime it seems more like a cooler/juice then a beer. Nothing is very complex with this beer and the alcohol level is quite low."
"Strongly acidic followed rapidly by a rich sweetness that is due to an abundandt peach quality. Finish is slightly bitter with dried apricot flavors."
"This won't be to everyone's taste. It is, after all, a fruit flavored beer. If you are a fan of fruit beers, this is a must."
"Drinkability: Bring it on! Because of it's low ABV and weak similarity to the beers I prefer, I don't have this often (if ever due to the price). But it is super easy to drink and enjoy, especially if you're in a wussy mood. Just don't sniff before you sip."
"D&N: I had to actually ask the barkeep if this was a beer or not, it's quite different than anything I've had so far. He assured me that it was, so there you are. Not something I would have expected. There aren't the classic ""beer"" things here. Maltiness, hoppiness, this is just plain different. In a completely wonderful way. This is incredible. The only reason I withheld a perfect five was the price. Ten bucks a bottle is quite steep."
"Not a bad beer by any stretch, but quite different from in the mouth versus the Framboise. Well worth drinking or sharing with friends looking for something different, a dessert type drink."
"Poured an orange colour with quite a bit of cloudiness to it. No head and almost no carbonation. Moderate consistent lacing. Wine-like fruitiness with moderate peachy smell. The taste was, of course, very powerful of peaches. The lack of carbonation makes this quite easy to drink. I still like the framboise better. As of my writing this, it is the only other lambic I have tasted. The peche is still quite tasty, however, and I would certainly buy it again."
"Poured out an orange color with not that much carbonation to it. Smell consisted of well..peaches. The smell was somewhat sharp. Taste was very tart. Peaches rule the palate the entire way with the tart mixing in every once in a while. Not bad. Some of the other lambics from Lindemans were better than this one though."
"Lambics are quickly becoming one of my favorite styles, and this is no exception. This one is a hazy gold with an extremely thin head that actually keeps. Inviting champagne-like aroma with hints of peach and yeast. No traditional barnyard lambic aromas here really. Flavor is better than I expected. It's just so damn crisp and tasty. Sweet peach flavor is subtle. It seems there are other fruity flavors going on here as well. Very lightly malty and just the right amount of tartness. Simply delicious, a very nice lambic."
"Nice to know I can still appreciate the stuff, though it will remain a special occasion only kind of selection."
"Notes: Awsome, but only by heritage. I love the drink, hate the price."
"Drinkability  This was very good and I enjoyed sipping it away."
"This beer pours a transparent (with slight haze) honey yellow color with a moderate to large head of moreate size bubbles. There is a lot of carbonation coming off- the head looks ""ragged"" (not as pretty) as some I've seen because of it. The aroma is peach soda like, with a rich, syrupy smell, including a slightly organic (wet earth, mossy) aroma hidden below the surface. The flavor is dominated by a very fruity soda-sweet with honey backflavor. I had a Peach Cobbler dessert the night before, and there were a lot of similarities in this beer. It's not really very beer-like- more cider/fruit juice (Hansen's) than beer. It's a nice change of pace to have, but I couldn't drink it often. Note: my girlfriend hates beer of all types, but she actually likes this stuff (and the Framboise too)."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Looks much more like a regular beer than Lindemans Kriek. Peachy orange color with a cloudy body and a thin short lived head. A bit too sweet and smooth for the style. No yeasty flavors and only mild sourness. A bit dumbed down for mass consumption in my opinion."
"ng"
"This beer poured an apricot color that was hazy in appearance. Still visible were the carbonation bubbles, not much carbonation, but just enough. The head that was produced was white in color, not very dense, I would say that the bubbles were hollow in appearance; the foam did last for some time before it fell to almost nothing. There was lace present full in places and spotty in others. The aromas that came from the glass were all faint, not too overpowering, peaches, hops, and a sprite soda kind of aroma tickled my nostrils and finished with a light yeast hint. Kind of sour and kind of dry, just what I would expect from Lindemans and a lambic. The flavors that I tasted were peaches up front, in the middle and as the end, some sweet malts, wheat grains mixed in through out, hops, a light hint of alcohol, became present as it warmed, and it finished with that light yeasty wheat flavor. Tart aftertastes of peaches were present. The body was on the light/medium side. Over all this beer was a pleasure to drink, crisp, clean, tart in places, and over all nice and peachy. This is a fine dessert beer, and will keep a few on hand."
"The beer pours a pure gold color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. There is a lot of carbonation around the outside of the glass. The aroma is decent. It seems a bit dry, but the majority is of sour peaches. The taste is good. It is rich and very tart. It has an intense sour peach flavor that is quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This drinks very well. I love lambic beers. Lindemans has the best that I've tried."
"The taste is light, fruity with a hint of peach. Kind of champagny-winey, almost like a wine cooler, really nice. I shared this with my wife on Sunday night after the New England Patriots won the Superbowl. Patriot blood - it's in us no matter where we are!"
"This beer poured a cloudy light amber color and formed huge off white bubbly head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of peach, yeast and other lambic elements I have never been good at placing. A flavor of peach and some slight bread elements/yeast. The finish is sweet and a bit tart, which is pretty much what I expect from this style. While not my favorite style of Belgian, I have slowly been gaining an appreciation for them. This one is quite good."
"Drinkability, this is definitely a special dessert beer, it is to sweet to drink in quantity."
" It is very nicely carbonated and it is a nice crisp drinker all the way down. Peach flavors are more mild than those of other fruits in Lindeman's other products. It is a nice one, but it does not seem to have any tart character to it at all. It is a bit boring, but still enjoyable. I will stick with the framboise from these guys."
"Drinkability was ok... i liked the flavor and even though it was not overly sweet the sweetness might get to you after a few of these and the carbonation definately detracts."
"Do they really call these beers? Tastes like a lite wine. Smells like a peach cobbler without the cinnamon with a spice and yeast nose. Hazy orange color a lacey head. Sugary sweet that tastes much like a hard candy. Peach taste dominates here. Yeast aftertaste is strong causing a dry, chalk-like finish. Good mix of sweet and sour, but perhaps a little too sweet."
"I had a wine and beer party where I offered tiny tastes of different wines and beers. There were a bunch of girls there who just don't drink, haven't developed any taste for tannins or hops. Just a drop of this peach lambic and they all loved it. So, in summary, nice sweet fruity drink that may be especially appreciated by the uninitiated. I have no doubt that less mainstream lambics must have more complexity, though I have not tried any."
"This was a really sweet beer. Not as sweet as Lindemans Framboise. The color was a hazy watered down orangish color. The smell was that of fresh peaches. It was very clean smelling. The taste was also very clean with a mild peach taste and a slight sourness and acidic taste. A most enjoyable drink. Im not a big fan of the sweet drinks but this one isnt too sweet, and that makes it an agreeable dessert drink."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It would make an excellent dessert beer but does well enough by itself. A delicious fruit beer that brought back memories of growing up on an orchard where I could walk out and smell the peaches when they were in season."
"Nice beer to find on tap, usualy arund Rochester its only the kriek. Poured in a lindeman's flute, which is a big plus for me. Had a smell spritzy white head woth a dirty yellow body full of carbonation. Smell was cool, with lots of bubblegum flavors and just a lingering hint of the peach. The taste was very refreshing with more peach, just a little of the musty funk of a lambic and a ton of sparkling champagne characteristics.There was also a good deal of dry tart body that helped make this very refreshing. The mouthfeel was very carbonated and usually I am not a fan of overcarbonation, but with a lambic it always seems to hit the sopt. Perfectly refreshing and always makes you question whether you are actually drinking a beer. Tasty even on a chillier night."
"Translucent amber-straw color with virtually no head but some active carbonation. Peach notes are light and fresh and very appealing. As with other Lindemans offerings, the fruit and grain smells complement each other and meld nicely--a distinct difference from the tacky fruit beers on the market. Taste is unexpectedly sweet at the start, but the subtle tartness leaves no doubt that you're tasting genuine peaches. Grains are muted until the end, and even then the maltiness is quite subtle. Mouthfeel is very pleasant despite the sweetness; it is more clean than syrupy. This is another fine Lindemans lambic, but one is enough at a sitting."
"The white head doesnt develop much; it reaches a ¼ inch before quickly fading to a nice, tight collar. Ruddy-tawny-coppery hue, slightly hazy... it does look mighty nice. The nose is fresh peaches and equally fresh wheat with kisses of yeast clean. Good potency. Inviting. The taste is much the same with peaches and fresh cut wheat nicely tart, not very sweet. Rather juicy, very little funkiness, oh well. Complex enough. It is amazingly appetizing, palate cleansing. Dry finish. Medium body. Light carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, very nice. This is damn good. There is always a time and a place to sip this one. The cost is prohibitive though. Try one."
"The color a light orange, peach if you like, beclouded, with the head insignificant in size, creamy in texture with an off white color, as it evanesces, a thin film of lace remains to seal off the glass. The aroma of fresh peaches, sweet yet tart, with a hint of yeast, oh so inviting this nose, what a Hoot. Front is ambrosial with a tartness at the sides, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is piercing in its acidity with the peach flavor present till the very end, the aftertaste desert dry and semi-sweet."
"Light orange color, medium head, noticeable peach nose. Very fruity, nearly overwhelming peach flavor. Sweet, yet there is a vineous under tone. Not very beer like, bit a nice taste. Full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Expansive. Finish is full and round. Aftertaste is sweet and smooth."
"This peach lambic poured a beautiful light golden color with a huge, frothy head. Trails of lace accumulated on the sides of the flute glass. Aroma was an almost one-dimensional onslaught of ripe peaches, with some acidic qualities thrown in for good measure. The first taste of this revealed the most sour taste, while subsequent sips provided a very fruity, sweet peach quality. Almost too sweet for my lambic interests, but a crowd pleaser nonetheless. Mouthfeel was prickly, clean and inviting. Due to the sweetness, it's not one that I can drink time and again, but it's a decent fruit lambic that most folks seem to enjoy. Note: This paired incredibly well with a peach and blueberry cobbler."
"Pours to an orangish-pink color with a white head. It has a fresh, fruity, yeasty aroma with the peach aromas in the back. The flavor is very fruity sweet, with peach being the forefront of the flavor. It also has a fresh earthy, flowery flavor. It finishes very sweet. It is a light-bodied brew that would complement many desserts. A tasty beer."
"F"
"Excellent purchase (albiet pricey)."
"When poured into my glass, the head was very small with small-medium bubbles that quickly diminished. There was some fizzy carbonation present and no lacing. The nose was apples and peaches. The body was semi-cloudy and it was a hazy golden in hue. The flavor was sour, bitter, tart and fruity. The mouthfeel was oily and buttery."
"Poured an cloudy golden color, with a moderate head. Good aroma and mouthfeel, good carbonation. The sweetness in this is very dominate. Very mild to non existant tartness. Not what I expected a Lambic to be, but still a very enjoyable drink. Finished off very clean and peachy. This would be another good after dinner drink."
"Well, reviewing this is more like reviewing wine than reviewing any beer. The color was golden, and there was no head. The smell was well, very peachy! The taste was very sweet, with very little hint of the lambic itself. The mouthfeel was quite smooth, as would be expected. One or two of these would be drinkable, although I think beyond that the sweetness would become too cloying. All in all, an excellent dessert drink, and a drink I would gladly give someone who normally doesn't like beer"
"This beer pours a very slightly hazy reddish golden with a very small clingy white head. The mouthfeel is rounded and almost syrupy. The smell is perfumey and slightly malty with a smell that I immediatley recognized from my childhood-canned peaches. The taste is perfumey peaches and overwhelmingly sweet. I could possibly enjoy this beer if the sweetness was halved. As it stands now it seems more like an overly sweet soft drink than a beer."
"White head on pour leaves quickly. Yellowish/peach color with lots of little bubbles.. crystal clear (filtered) look. Sweet smell of fruit and a sharp hop note as well. Initial slight grassy taste followed by a peach sweetness and sweet malt. The finish is slightly crisp, bitter, and dry. Slightly overall too sweet. Medium /light mouth."
"Deep Amber color and nice fluffy, if fastly fading head. The lace is clinging and sticky. Earthy cave-like and peach aroma with a hint of floral hops. Medium malt body and ample lemony hops. Definitely peaches. And not peach extract! Sweet and citrus bitterness. Caramel Notes. Earthy. Very Complex!"
"Feel of this is full and heavy set, very hard to drink alot of it at once, its a big time sipper. I had a much harder time enjoying this compared to the Framboise. But it still makes for a good little dessert or night cap."
"I didn't like this as much as the Cassis, but that's most likely a fruit choice. Pours a nice light brown color with a good head. Tastes of peach. A bit tart, and very fruity. Quite light on the hops. A nice brew. Very drinkable. A good lambic. My girlfriend liked it quite a bit. If you like peaches...."
"Tasted pretty aciddic, the whole tounge was feeling this beer. Definately something i enjoyed."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a pillowy soft white head that leaves trails of sticky lace on the sides of the glass as it recedes. Nose and taste are both sweet and fruity with notes of fresh peaches (no artificial flavors here) balanced by just the right amount of tartness that leaves your mouth watering for another sip. Mouthfeel is thick and juicy with a refreshing amount of active carbonation. This is a delicious brew that would make for a nice after-dinner drink or as an afternoon cocktail on a warm summer day."
"I will surly have to try some other fruit Lambics to determine if this is part of the style or just a fluke"
"Note: On looking at the copyright of Merchant Du Vin (importer) on the label, it said 1992 -- older than the other copyright 1999 Lindemans bottles I have at home. This may be quite an old bottle, though I'm no expert on the aging flavor profiles for Lambics."
"After recently trying the Kriek and Framboise, I expected some seriously strong sour peach flavor out of this lambic. Surprisingly, nothing was overpowering about it. Served at room temperature, it pours out to what looks like beer, not a wine like appearance that the others have. It's a fairly clear golden color, and some wonderful lacing occurs all the way down the glass. The aroma is a sour peach, but it's not pungent. The mouthfeel is very smooth. This beer is wonderfully pleasantly sweet, sour, and peachy. It isn't puckering like other lindemans lambics, making it more drinkable and refreshing. I highly recommend this lambic to anyone who is just getting into them."
"Interesting, exciting, and worth having again."
"It poured a hazy orange golden yellow with a minimal amout of foam. The smell was of citrus fruit, not a strong peach smell, but, it reminded me of a sparkling cider. Tasting it was like drinking a sparkling cider but not as sweet. I could taste the peach, but not this beer was not overpowering. Nice sweet/tart flavor and finish in the mouth, with a pleasant after taste!"
"(source: ABC; Atlantic Beach, FL)"
"It makes an excellent breakfast, brunch or dessert beer and I highly recommend to anyone with a chance to get their hands on it!"
"I had this as an appetizer but it would also work as a dessert. I could also use help with selecting the proper glass for next time."
"The flavor is distinctly of peaches but the Belgian beer flavors are still there the hops and maltiness are perfectly blended with a delicate balance that they are more enhancing to the natural flavor of the peaches. If you haven't tried or have some BS reason to not try lambics - then give it up for this one. If you have tried the Kriek, Cassis or Framboise and didn't find these to your liking don't make a prejudicial opinion based on those. This is a unique flavor and stands completely on its own."
"Pours a cloudy, brass tinged orange robe topped by a short creamy white head. The head drops shortly but keeps a creamy collar and whispy surface covering, as well as leaving some nice lace. The aroma combines a very nice, authentic fresh peach that's not overly sweet with minor flashes of lambic character (light lactic sourness, very mild mustiness). The body is light/medium with a very fine and restrained carbonation that gives it a creamy mouthfeel and adds to it's smooth fruitiness. The flavor is, again, quite realistically peachy with a ripe, juicy, sweet fruitiness that's backed by a tart edge. Some minimal lambic character becomes apparent in the long finish and adds to it's complexity. Of the Lindeman's fruit lambic line-up, this one seems a bit more delicate and a little less sweet, and therefore has more versatility. I works equally well as an appertif or dessert beer, and would be splendid at almost any time during the summer (think sunset on the beach)! And although I normally lament the lack of more aggressive lambic character (acidity, mustiness, barnyard) in the Lindeman's beers, I feel that actually works here. Quite refreshing and highly enjoyable. It's well worth seeking out and should not be passed over for the Kriek or Framboise."
"Is this really a beer? It makes a great sparkling wine. Very fruity (peach, duh) and sweet flavor. Lively and sparkling. I hate that I liked this so much because it's such a sissy drink, but what can you do. I typically do not like fruit beers but this is a great summer drink. At $5 a bottle I could only afford to drink it one season anyway."
"Pours a large head that settles quickly to a sticky thin lace. Underneath, a copper color with a hint of haze. Very tart aroma of fruit, peach of course. Also, some nature-like aromas, specifically something you'd find on a farm. I've heard this described as ""horse blanket"" character, that's exactly how I'd describe it as well. Very distinct character all around that is best described with the word ""aged"". Under all of this, hops and malt are still detectable in a slight bitterness and an earthy grain character. Overall, tart-sourness dominates. Probably the best of the Lindemans fruit lambics, but it would be much better if it wasn't sweetened. Go for a Cuvee Rene gueuze instead."
"Nice tartness appropriate to the fruit (and of course the beer style). Peach flavor is nice and the least artificial of the flavors. (I know they probably use the real deal, but it doesn't always taste that way). The best thing I can think of to say about the flavor and moutfeel that you wouldn't otherwise expect from a fruit lambic is that it's soft. I like it. Very refreshing."
"A fantastically interesting peach lambic.  Nearly a peach champagne with slight maltiness and bitterness.  Dig this if you can.  Cheers!"
"Thank Jebus!!  Belgian brew has finally made it to good ole New Hampshire!  The color of this brew matches with its fruit.  Pillowy white head with good retention. Somewhat candyish peach nose with slight must.  Finishes fruity with a slight bit of sourness.  Would go nicely with the sunset and your significant other."
"Notes: Simply superb ... a wonderful beer to have at a Sunday brunch."
