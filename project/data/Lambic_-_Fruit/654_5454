My memories of Mort Subite Kriek with an omelet for a late breakfast probably influence my score upwards. The nose is cherries with a slight funk. This is a beautiful brilliant cherry color with a pink tinted foam cap and a fine bead. The beer is light, big on cherries, tart with a light balancing sweetness – probably a little sweeter than some Krieks but not like soda pop sweet. It is very effervescent with a fine soft carbonation. Very drinkable, especially for breakfast.","pat61","Mar 07, 2015"

Mort Subite Kriek is flavorful, tasty stuff that I'd say is worth a try, but it still kind of straddles that line between alcopop and beer, so purists or serious lambic fans probably won't dig it that much. I really wish these sorts of brews were available year-round in my area, but for now it seems fruit lambics will remain a once-in-a-while thing for me. I rarely drink these styles in general, so it's fair to mention that I'm far from a connoisseur here. This might not be the best kriek in the world, but it's still tasty and easy to like, with a nice balance of cherry tartness, sweetness, and funky lambic goodness. A very quaffable brew that I would suggest as an entry point into the style for anyone curious.","thehyperduck","Dec 22, 2012"

Smell is cherries, not too much else, there is something else fruity in there but can't put my finger on it. Taste is malty and cherrries, like a cherry soda, alcohol taste is barely present. Mouth feel is bubbly and light-not as much as champagne but still somewhat dry. Drinkability is okay but when I buy something Belgium I am looking for something a bit more manly.
