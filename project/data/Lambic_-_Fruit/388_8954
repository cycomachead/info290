The grapes turn sweeter, riper as the malts stand out against the tart sourness, adding stone fruit qualities to the taste. At the same time, carried by a lively carbonation, the sourness becomes quite intense, with a vinegar note, evoked by the fermented grape sourness, while both tastes blend well together, wrapped up by the wooden barrel. Finishes with a tongue quenching, slightly dry sourness, along with lemon zest and grape pulp. The beer still reminds me in many ways of a young wine, while missing its typical sweetness, replaced by the typical lambic tartness, with a refreshing, high carbonation.","aleigator","Feb 08, 2015"

Pours a super bright almost neon purplish pink color with a massive fizzy pink head that recedes quickly. Lots of vinegar on the aroma, berries, vinous notes, and an interesting mint leaf that I get from Geueze and Faro sometimes. Really nice. The flavor is sweet berries and wine, vinegar, sourness, some dry oaky presence, and maybe even a little vanilla. The fruit doesn't overpower here which is nice. Light bodied, spritzy carbonation, dry finish with some wine like warmth on the way down. Beautiful beer.","BMMillsy","May 09, 2014"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, grape, fruit, funk, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, grape, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite sour but refreshing to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 05, 2014"

Nose is somewhat subdued - tart, suggestions of cork and acetic acid. Taste is a bit musty with grape skins, cranberry and tannins. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of lively and a dry finish. Overall, not my favorite offering from Cantillon (I anticipated a little more fruit); however, a wonderful lambic nonetheless.","Jwale73","Nov 24, 2013"

Regardless, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy fuchsia topped by over a finger of pink-ish foam. The nose comprises tart blue raspberry, light sour cherry, sour grape, a hint of grapefruit zest, and a light smattering of funk. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything showing off some powerful sour chops. This is kept in partial check, though, by the funk, which, though relatively mild in its individual expression, also blends in nicely with its acidic surroundings. The grape character is pronounced, but not overt. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, another damn fine fruited lambic from Cantillon, one of the highlights of a night that included quite a few ridiculous sours of various styles. And I'm happy to say that the aforementioned wine aficionado was also impressed by this offering. I was not surprised.","TMoney2591","Sep 28, 2013"

4.69,3.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Overall: This is as good as it got for my experience at Brasserie Cantillon. Having already tried the regular lineup, LPK and LPF, this one is my absolute favorite. There are characteristics of a tasty red wine here for sure, yet it tastes like a great lambic beer with the carbonation of champagne. It's just an awesome brew that I would recommend to anyone with the opportunity to purchase a bottle. If I get more of these, they are going into the cellar to be cracked on special occasions.","Stevedore","Jul 04, 2013"
4.72,4.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.75,"O: Wow. What a brew. This blend is absolutely fantastic, especially with the nearly 2 years on the bottle. I suppose the funkiness has developed a bit (this one really opens up with a blast of funk/sour/tart) and the oak has also shown up more. Quite pricey (I paid $30 for a 750 mL bottle) but well worth the investment. This is a must-try","BEERMILER12","Jul 04, 2013"

As it gets flat in the glass, it starts to look like a rosé wine. But the main impression I get is the strong presence of brett, considered an infection by wine makers, but welcomed by lambic makers. No place to sort all that out here, but this is an excellent complex sour beer to sip while pondering the commonalities and differences between lambic beers and wine.","Beerenauslese","Apr 11, 2013"

Pretty tart on the tongue, strong flavors of grape and apple skin, thin wine, horseblankety, but not overblown in that aspect, grassy and very dry; the intensity of the fruit tartness overthrew any acetic notes that might have been present, giving a good sense of balance. Medium body, again, crisp and very dry, a bit puckering, low to moderate carbonation, overall texture comparable to chewing on grape or apple skin.

Aroma of musty grapes, oak, Merlot, raspberry, cherries. Comes across almost as a Framboise and really not so different from Don Quijote. Taste is grape skin tannins, sweeter Merlot grapes, citrus tartness, lactic raspberry, sharply citric, tart blueberry and strawberry come to mind. High carbonation, effervescent mouthfeel.

At first the nose seems real straightforward, but as you keep diving in, more layers reveal themselves. On the palate, sweet yet tart red grapes up front, with a mustiness coming out mid-palate. Barnyard notes through the middle with some oak before a final rush of cherries and grapes. The finish is crisp and dry. A long lingering tartness in the finish. The body is on the light side of medium with perfect carbonation. This lambic is a great bridge beer for the wine drinker. Loads of wine grape flavor with a moderate tartness. This could easily win over some wine drinkers. I found this to be delicious. The flavors are bold, and really release off the palate quickly to reveal this lingering tartness that satisfies the sour cravings.","ColForbinBC","Oct 19, 2012"

4,-11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"2010 vintage. This one pours a lighter bodied dark cranberry red in color with a one finger slightly pink head. The nose is dry and musty with a nice amount of funk and acidity. The flavors are dry and tart and it has nice acidity. As a wine drinker, I must say that this has zero characteristics of a Merlot so it's nice to see the difference between the beer and wine. This one is musty as hell. It drinks light with nice acidity but I can't really like the flavor. It doesn't have enough fruit character for my liking. This is the best vintage I've had so far. The '07 smells like puppy farts in my opinion, as in ""I just fed my dog too many rawhides"" puppy farts. I definitely prefer this vintage to that one.","aasher","Jun 19, 2012"

The smell of the beer gives off plenty of Merlot Grape aromas along with the tart aromas of the wild fermentation this brew has gone through. The taste of the beer has a tart grape flavor up front with a dry funky aftertaste that would probably interest most wine lovers to try this beer. The mouthfeel is think and dry, not overly carbonated at all. Overall this brew was pretty good, I'm not sure if I would ever buy this one again mainly because of the price tag on it.

4,-11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this beer on tap at Monk's at their Cantillon event today. The beer poured and looked much like a red wine would. It was a deep purple red color with no head to speak of at all. The aroma too, mirrored a red wine, but was less intense and had a bit of a vinegary thing happening along with a bit of mild funk. The red wine thing continues in the flavor. This beer very closely mirrors a lighter much more pleasant and enjoyable (for me anyway) version of a merlot. Very good beer, but not necessarily one that blew me away.","Agold","Aug 08, 2011"
4.52,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"750 ml bottled in 2010 shared by cenzo. Thanks Vince. Pours a bright cherry red with small white head that has decent retention and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a light brett funkiness, red wine grapes, light tannins with a bit of oak as well as a bit of cherry. The initial taste is quite sour with a little bit of sweetness and the red wine grapes coming through. A bit of oak and cherry are present as well as some lactic acid. The standard Cantillon barnyard funk is present in small amounts as well. The finish is dry with a light tannic astringency. Light to medium body with a really good slick mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation. Another great Cantillon beer that I would be happy to drink anytime.","jethrodium","Jul 30, 2011"
4.42,-2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"One of the most balanced and complex lambics I've had. The merlot grapes really lend something special. I think this would be better with more age (bottle says 21 November 2010). Allowing the brett to do its thing and develop more wild character would take this to a whole new level. I liked the Cuvee de Champion, but this is clearly in another league.","BradLikesBrew","Jul 28, 2011"

4.77,5.3,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Narrative: Vitus Tanneen had been in some sticky jams before but this time, this time certainly was noteworthy. The walls of the trash compactor closed slowly, pressing the wine refuse closer into the chamber. The aluminum walls reeked of sweet grape skins and sticky notes. If not for the impending death, this would be an almost pleasant situation. “Well Sir Knuckles, looks like we are in a PRESSING SITUATION!” His friendly companion, Sir Knuckles, was an astute howler monkey with no penchant for puns. “WREE EE EE EEEK!” Sir Knuckles gestured imposingly to a hatch covered in sticky grape residue. “Well Sir Knuckles, this is one top that I have no hesitation to pop.” Using a wine opener, Vitus deftly unsealed the hatch and emerged into the bay area sunshine. “NOT TODAY KENDAL JACKSON! NOT TODAY!” He spun and his velvet tails swung after this athletic frame with the poise of a man, a man almost killed by grapes.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jul 21, 2011"

I wish it had a bit more balance, but then again it is possible that the age had mellowed the grapes and let the sour shine through more. It was definitely quite the experience to drink this beer though, especially in good company.","zoso1967","Jul 18, 2011"

4.97,9.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"2009 bottle courtesy of the ever-awesome ericfb18. The brew pours a luscious blood-red hue, although it is fully translucent; it is capped with a thin wisp of encircling white froth. The nose is pure Cantillon funk; delicious and complex. Notes of bushy mixed berries, acidity of the acetic persuasion more than lactic, tannic oak, and an overall unbelieveably delectable and well-rounded flavor make this one of the best beers on Earth. The wine and grape is there if you look for it, although I feel like the fruitiness could just as easily be cherry, raspberry, blueberry or a berry melange. The most succinct way to describe the flavor of St. Lamvinus: This is what I thought Blabaer was going to taste like. I am struck by the fullness of the fruit flavor; it is not mere nuance, the taste is big and jammy and unabashed. The feel is full and creamy for a Cantillon (a la Blabaer), and has a wonderfully dry and mouth-watering finsh. Overall, this is about as good as a beer (or any libation, for that matter) can be.","ktrillionaire","Jul 14, 2011"

3.65,-19.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Saint Lamvinus pours a deep burgundy. I could mistake it for red wine, except for the thin layer of raspberry head that crowns the beer. The nose consisty of dark fruits (cherries and plums), acidity, and a bit of barnyard funk. The red wine notes should be the base that everything plays off of, but they are just a bit too far in the background to really carry things though. The funky aspect of the beer comes through a bit more in the flavor. I've heard funk sometimes described as being musty , but this is the first time I've personally tasted it. It tastes like I imagine the air in a long abandoned room would. It's a bit overpowering, blocking out the more tart edge and fruity notes from the wine grapes. It's amazing to contrast the mouthfeel here with the Cuvee des Champions I just had. This one comes across as bit more rich and full, though that may be more a function of a much lower level of carbonation than any increase in the body. The overall effect though is a certain dullness to the beer. Saint Lamvinus smoothed out a bit as it warmed, but it remained a class below my favorite sours/wild ales.","axeman9182","May 26, 2011"

4.54,0.2,5,3.5,5,4,5,"Pours a crazy purple color, similar to the label on Welch's grape jelly. Immediately, it makes you question whether it's beer. No head, but visible carbonation bubbles line the bottom of the glass. Smell is quite clean. Hints of wild yeast, but in no way as powerful as most lambics and particularly weak for a Cantillon. The taste is smooth, almost like a perfect blend of wine and lambic. Grape comes through as well as the wild yeast. Sour, but not the typical puckering that comes from the top lambics. Very light bodied. Wonderful lambic particularly if you want something more mellow and smooth. This is one even a none-lambic drinker could get on board with. Tremendous.","Blanco","May 23, 2011"

This beer made me shriek for sheer joy upon its sight. Good goddamn it looks amazing. Smells funky, a little grape and berry action. The taste is barnyard, a touch of grape, tannic, woodsy. I was surprised I didn't get more grape out of it, merely hinting, but that's not a terrible thing. I'm just accustomed to grape sours tasting more vinous. This had a bit of that quality but was definitely more lambic than grapebeer. Good stuff.","dragonWhale","May 21, 2011"

Firts sip brings the merlot wine grapes, evolves into a moderately tart, sour and acidic taste, but the strong fruit flavors cut through. Lightly funky and some sweetness.

Maintained minimal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, very slight grapes, and slight acetic acid. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, grapes, deep dark fruit, slight acetic acid, and big citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. I had this one sitting in the cellar since 2008 and finally got tired of looking at it and decided to crack it. Really glad that I did. The flavor was not only complex but quite excellent as everything seemed to blend very nicely together. It also had a great aroma that invited me in for more. I found myself drinking this one quite quickly. Good thing is is only 6%... An absolute must try for anyone!","thagr81us","Mar 07, 2011"
4.65,2.6,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Quite sour vinous character from the merlot grapes with a bit raspberry lemon side to the profile. The grapes lie somewhere in between ripe red grapes and underripe green grapes. I generally prefer younger fruit lambic and at about 2 years old the level of fruit presence seems ideal. Has a very rich aspect of funk to it that's pretty animal like, sort of a leathery flavor. A really pleasing balance between sour and funk that keeps everything in check. Maybe couldve used a little more carbonation. Very drinkable.","Dspohn","Feb 26, 2011"

Pours a dark purple with a slight cloudiness, no residual head, but lovely color from those grapes undoubtedly. Aroma is nicely funky and uniquely Cantillon and Brussels in that respect. Fairly dry floral character with some fruit/grape sweetness. The taste has that wonderful Cantillon funk to it, plus grape skins and floral notes and a dry finish. Medium bodied with a full carbonation, dry yet refreshing. This is a real tasty brew.

The beer has an opaque plum/cranberry hue. There is no head or visible carbonation. It is a beautiful looking beer. It has a great fruity, funky aroma. It is slightly champagne-like. A mildly sweet fruit flavor is the first thing I taste. Tartness kicks in as I swallow and lingers briefly. I am definitely tasting wine-like flavors (red grapes, mostly), but all in a great funk wrapper. It's delicious. It has a crisp, dry light body. The tingly funk feeling is a great substitute for the carbonation bubbles you can usually feel in beers. There is a slight mouth coat. For a sour beer, this is amazingly drinkable. It really isn't all that sour. I wish I had a bigger pour! It is definitely a sipper, but extremely enjoyable. Personally, I can't see myself ever getting tired of this beer. It is near perfect.","ToasterChef","Feb 17, 2010"

The aroma had a sour vinegar and wine-soaked cloth quality. The flavor definitely evokes the merlot, but is more complex as it shifts in even one sip from a tart & sweet cherry to vinegar sour and then changes to a flat but bright, crisp wine.

The smell is kind of hard to pick up on with such a small head, but I can get this oxidized red wine scent immediately. Definitely a good, strong wild yeast character. The taste is what really shines. There's the standard wild ale, the tart, sour candy sitting on top of a lighter bodied red wine. Kind of a vinegar taste, really a great example of a lambic, though I've never had one with grapes. The mouthfeel is right on, none of the chalky tartness, not overcarbonated, great.

I ran the gamut of food pairings (cheese, meats, sweets) and came up with hardly any pairings that were neutral at best. (Perhaps a very fresh, sweet, cow's milk cheese or HEAVY chocolate dessert may work? I did not have these available to me at time of tasting). Taken as an apertif, this has more appeal- it is excellent for opening taste buds for later food/beverages with its sharpness and fruit character, and is most definitely for sipping.

Mild sweet tones off fruit and grapes. Obvious, but still slightly subdued grape characteristics there. Oh to hell with it.

The smell is winey with cherries, sour aromas, and some funkiness. Woody bitterness at the end. Taste is somewhat similar- sour, bitter, and complex. Slightly funky bitter finish at the end. The mouthfeel is sharp, tart, and refreshing. Very drinkable, and although this is somewhat sour and funky, I find it less so than many of the other Cantillons. This one is winier and more delicate.

Some musty damp barnyard mingles with cider and some tannins. the taste follows suit with plenty of earthy brett flavors, some cidery and sharp flavors and loads of puckering sourness. A spectacular balance comes from the expanse of fruit flavors in tow. Very ripe grape flesh, bitter grape skin and assorted berries and citrus in the background. It reminds me of a good full bodied red wine. The finish is long and complex with biting acidity melded with fruit sweetness.

A 750ml bottle, with the label stating it was bottled 25Oct2006. Poured into a tulip glass, it was an amazing ruby red color with a touch of orange. A small head quickly dissipated, leaving a very still beer. It had a fruity aroma which seemed mostly cherry, and was also on the musty side (I mean that in a good way). Pleasant fruity taste, but what really was really striking was the degree of tartness. I've had other lambics from Cantillon that were nowhere near this tart. A wonderful, smooth beer.

It was dry-ish like a wine, but it was well balanced and had beer attributes. My palate was very confused the whole time as it was trying to decide if it was drinking merlot or beer.

There is a sweet but yet very sour, barny punch to this beer. It all works out very well if you are a fan of lambics and very sour ones for that matter.

The tangy grapefruit flavor prevents it from going down smooth, however. The sourness forces you to hold it in your mouth and that's when other flavors become apparent. I tasted some light berry and grape notes that gave a slight sweetness to balance the sour. The smell is not sweet, as it had a strong, funky barnyard odor.

There was strong barnyard funkiness, the distinct smell of horse, and a little vinegar. Also thrown in were light tobacco notes, some tart fruit, and a vinous character (like a merlot or burgundy). Very tart flavour, like raspberry seeds with a bit of sour cherry thrown into the mix. Puckering. Some earthiness became evident as it warmed, with notes of leather and barnyard increasing. Sweet grapes gave it a bit of red wine quality as well. Crisp carbonation to start, but this faded quickly to a gentler texture mid-sip. Nice body with significant dryness. I really enjoyed this and I'm glad I have some more Cantillon bottles to try out soon.

I poured a beautiful red rasberry color into a glass that resembled one used for champagne. No head on this one really. Smell definitely had that baryard funk found in most Cantillon beers, with some sweet tart smells going on as well. First taste was huge on the sour notes. The second sip however, revealed a circus of fruit lying behind the initial sour notes. I think the fact that it was cask conditioned may have mellowed some of the sourness of it a bit. Mouthfeel was simply awesome....the more you let it swish around the mouth, the more intense flavors you get. One glass was enough for me...I would have liked more, but I didn't want intense heartburn, so I switched to something else. Simply a delightful beer.

4.85,7.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Appears a dark purpleish-red color, with a bit of your typical beery-amber color coming through, though it's taken over with the more exotic colors. Fairly brash smell, sharp and stinging, sour, and with hay and horse blanket hints. I don't usually use that adjective (horse blanket), and I usually think that typical lambic ""funk"" is more of a sweaty sock smell, but this one I have to admit is particularly horsey. Taste is all over the place, but comes together in a really subtle yet complex way. Whereas some labics taste blatantly like a particular fruit (rasperries or cherries, for example) this one has more of a blend of fruity tastes. Grapes, and grape skins, fresh from the vine, yes, but also hints of dark cherries and other fruits. There's also a great fresh wood character in there, that was particularly enhanced by drinking this beer outside, which I highly recommend. Everything about this beer was so fresh, it just feels like you're blending in with the grass outside. That sounded a little hippyish, but that's how I felt when I drank this beer. Super dry mouthfeel makes it all come together. Really a world class beer here, living up to all the hype. Though hype really isn't a good word here, and doesn't fit the beer. The Saint Lamvinus is simply a delicious beer, from one of the world's most distinct breweries. Enjoy it.","twelvsies","Jun 17, 2005"
3.73,-17.7,5,4.5,4,3.5,2,"Drinkability and Notes  While I respect this beer, the exceedingly high price and sourness make this a one time purchase for me.

4.33,-4.4,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"pours a magnificant ruby purple color. Smells tart and of lambic funk. Some slight grape and wine aromas are present. There is some grape flavor up front, but mainly dominated by the lactic acid flavor. Very tart and is really lip smackingly good. Very dry in the mouth. This is much like a very tart wine. I can't say I have anything like this before. The sour grape flavor is very outstanding and unique. But priced a little high in my mind.","bnuttz","May 04, 2005"

An aroma of lambic elements, with a definate red wine character to it. The flavor is a very traditional non sweet lambic with a good deal of sourness to it without overpowering it. The body is medium light and slightly heavier than most lambics. The finish is quite astrigent with some if the winelike sourness present. This is a very outstanding beer.","Wildman","Mar 13, 2005"

Pours a brilliant light red color with a very small head, which was expected. Lots of funky stuff going on in the aroma. Fruit (grape), sweetness, sour, acid, it's all there. The flavor was very much the same as the aroma predicted. Strange tart/sour character with a great background flavor from the grapes. Very complex. There's a lot going on here. Very enjoyable. Very odd as well. I'm glad I got to try this one.","clvand0","Jan 16, 2005"

It pours a light burgundy color with one finger of head that dies down quickly. There is a touch of lacing left on the glass. The smell has that great Cantillon funk with some red grape sweetness. It really draws you in and keeps you wanting more and more. The taste is amazing. Lots of sweet and sour, with some funkiness. Dry grapes smashed under a horse's saddle. The complexity almost made my head explode. The mouthfeel had sizzling carbonation that just popped on the tongue, unlike any other beer I've experienced. The drinkability was through the roof. Going through a few of these would be hard on the wallet, but easy on the palate. This beer is everything a lambic was meant to be.","SheepNutz","Jan 10, 2005"
4.97,9.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This rare treat was shared between 4 people last night, and I have to believe that I will have to drink this beer again, without the other 3 glasses being shared. The liquid pours a beautiful rosey ruby color with a finger of spritzey head that immediately fallst to ring the beer with large bubbles. This one is very wine-like in the color, somewhere between a blush and a dark red. The nose was true to the Cantillon form. Funky, sour, acidic, but with a nice fruity grape coming in behind the funk, smelling so damn good. The flavor. What can one say about liquid nirvana; something so awesome that I would be happy to drink exclusively for the rest of my life. What struck me most was how mellow and smooth this was. I've had a few of the Cantillon line, but this was every bit as funkey, but much more mellow. Still sour and acidic and tart, but not puckering. The grape flavor hits secondarily behind the initial burst of sour and acid, but it serves to polish this beer like the finest diamond. The feel was a weak moderate to moderate, wtih a light, dancing bubble on my tonge. Nothing that got in the way, but enough to know it was there. Awesome balance on the pucker factor. Wow...wow, wow, wow. If there is anything left to say about the drinkability that can't be drawn from what I've already said, I don't know what it would be. Hunt this beer. Drink this beer. Love this beer. So good.","kmpitz2","Jan 08, 2005"

The aroma is yeasty sweet with a dry wine scent. The flavor is a sour, dry, and fruity red wine flavor. It is pungent and tart with notes of pear flesh. Going back and reading the bottle I saw that this beer is made with Bordeaux grapes. This is unlike any beer I've ever had and probably will ever have again. Excellent beer.","BrewMaster","Nov 19, 2004"
4.97,9.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Very typical Cantillon quality. Vibrant red color has a touch of violet in it. Surprisingly still in appearance despite the bold effervesence on the tongue. Sour nose with an especially vomitous, bile-like aroma. Ah, lovely, lovely Cantillon. Pressing deeper, one is hard-pressed to evade the grape skin and cranberry redolence present under the initial funk. Fruity cranberry sweetness and mild bitterness blend nicely with a potent sourness. It's quite sour, though I think of their fruit lambics, this is more nominal and par for the course (meaning consistent, not poor) than it is exceptional. Spectacular beer.","marburg","Oct 20, 2004"
4.62,2,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"2003 edition had at the Moan and Dove. Deep pinky brownish cherry body. Almost no head, but theres that mysterious cloudiness I love in some bottle-conditioned beers which just seems to make the color complex. Huge aroma, very clean, balsamic, lightly farmy and surprisingly pretty sweet. Floral sweetness, dessert sauce, red wine-ish.. This defines classy. Field notes. Complex woody oak-like character. On the tongue, you really taste the grape skins out of it. Acidity level is masterfully controlled. Just the right lactic bite. It evolves into a malic fruitiness, passes through a moldy temporary state and finishes very leafy with remarkable mouth puckering properties. Cantaloup, pomegranate.. Big mouthfeel, full bodied, moderately carbonated, perfectly fitting imo and enhances global flavour deployment. Dryness hits you up and leaves a toy of an astringency with which I spent several minutes experimenting sips of water. What can I say, water tasted just sooo good after a sip of st-lamvinus. A beer that will haunt my memories for a long while. Post taste actually doesnt last all that long, but I still found myself trying to suck out the remaining flavours out of my tongue, like struggling for the last red grape of a whole harvest. Unique. This is to sip with respect, not that its not drinkable.","Rastacouere","Oct 12, 2004"

Smells like (and I mean this in the best way possible) what my girlfiend puked up on the carpet in my dorm room after attending a very good high quality red wine tasting . Acidic rounded and berrylike in the nose. Very clean and dry upfront with a rounded fruity berry like (blackberry/raspberry) mellowness. A touch of barnyard love but it is a very clean drinkable brew. Smoothish soft loving mouth with little bubbles on the tongue. The brew just WONDERFUL!","frank4sail","Aug 09, 2004"
4.8,6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Well after trying many of the Cantillon offerings I was ready to see what all the hype was about this brew. Pours a cloudy ruby red with a skimish white head that leaves no lace. Aromas are of a typical lambic, but almost a little more subtle. There was the classic barnyard, pungent sourness / tartness and just a slight slight hint of grape. For flavor this beer was just incredible. Smooth and well rounded this beer starts off sour and tart, but it just doesn't overwhelm the pallate like most Cantillon's. There was only the slightest hint of grape flavor and just a little carbonation, but it was enough to just add a little extra something to this beer. The Saint finished a little acidic but not overwhelming like so many other lambics, with just the right amount of sourness to keep this beer very drinkable. By far of all the Cantillon's this is the best, just well textured, good balance of flavors between the tartness and sourness, and the acidic fruit flavors. Though it may be a bit pricey, if you see this around, its definetly worth the pick up.","bigbeerdrinka","Aug 05, 2004"

The aroma was very strong, very traditional Cantillon with slight hints of grape. The pour, while plenty vigorous, resulted in no head, merely a brilliant hazy red, semi-viscous liquid.. Little to no carbonation, but an excellent prickle during the swallow. Unlike many other Cantillon lambics, it was completely smooth and perfectly balanced, no overwhelming acidic or sour bite, just enough initial lambic traits, then smooth and satisfying. Wow a traditional lambic with this perfect of drinkability; I could have sipped on it all night. For any lambic lover, worth spending the time, energy, and money to obtain a bottle. I dont believe it will be a revelation for anyone who has enjoyed other Cantillon lambics, but a very, very nice addition to their line.","truthbrew","Jun 08, 2004"

The aroma is a lemony sourness with red wine vinegar and hints of sour socks and creamy goat cheese. The flavor is quite tart, but not overly lip-puckering. Hints of cork, mold, grape skins, popcorn, and an enteric bitterness in the aftertaste. I asked my wife to try it, too.
