review_text
"This beer is very difficult for me to rate and should probably be taken with a ""grain of salt"".  It hits all of the marks of the style (e.g. look, funky/fruity smell, funky/tart flavor, etc.) and is probably an extremely solid option for those who love sours.  I have enjoyed sours, but I much prefer that the sourness itself be on the milder end of the spectrum.  This beer was just a bit too much for me to handle in terms of tartness."

"Slowly sip and get ready to have your taste buds assaulted."
"Wow, this is an exceptional sour beer.  Very complex, if you see it and enjoy sours its a must by."
"O: Really enjoyable but definitely a slower sipping beer because of the level of tartness/sourness."

"4.09/5: Wonderfully in-your-face"
"Bottle shared with a friend. Pours cherry red with white head. Aroma of sour cherries and some funk. Taste of cherry, funk and sour berries. Very, very tart and sour. Delicious."

"This is very good indeed."
"Poured into chilled 750 mL glass, pours a deep red almost a maroon color with a small half finger white bubbly head, no lacing. It smells slightly of cherries with an earthy lingering scent at the end. It tastes much better than the scent, a strong cherry flavor which surprises you with a strong tart bite, not a bad one though, I was just used to lindemans kriek which is a lot more sweet. The mouthfeel is light with strong carbonation, and as mentioned previously a really strong tart bite, it IS good though. Overall a good kriek, I prefer lindemans to it though!"

"O - An outstanding kriek! I love that I can still find this easily and will enjoy it until the American market realizes what they're passing up."
""
""
""
"O: In conclusion, this is a great advocate for its style. The complexity of this beer is overwhelming. One of the best beers I have ever tasted. I look forward to tasting the younger (and older vintages) in comparison."
"Overall: Pretty good stuff and one of the better ""shelf"" krieks out there. Worth picking up."

"Really enjoyed this kriek."

"Overall, a wonderful take on the style. I'm admittedly a sucker for krieks, but this one is exceedingly well done. Sour and puckering, with a nice depth of aroma and a nice dry finish that entices the next sip in spite of the aggressive sourness. I don't know what this one tastes like fresh, but honestly, I don't care. It's fantastic with over a year on it, and I will have to make a point to grab bottles of this when I see it around town. It's an acceptable substitute for it's more famous Belgian sour beer making counterparts, and more readily available."

"Excellent sour Lambic. It has some funk but the sourness is the main player. If your in the mood for some puckering sour lambic juice, this is your liquid. Haassens doesn't mess around."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in February 2013. Pours fairly clear ruby red color with a 2 finger dense pink head with poor retention, that reduces to a lacing ring that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of sour cherry, cherry skin, cranberry, green apple, grape, pear, clove, pepper, oak, leather, straw, hay, red wine, vinegar, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of cherry, wild/lactic yeast, and oak notes; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, cherry skin, cranberry, green apple, pear, red wine, oak, clove, straw, grass, hay, vinegar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, oak, clove, red wine, leather, vinegar, straw, hay, and musty funk on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of cherry, oak, and wild/lactic yeast flavors; with a very nice malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent sour kriek style. All around great complexity and balance of cherry, oak, and lactic/wild yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the balanced acidity. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Delicious beer! The best Lambic I have tasted. Really exemplifies the Belgian stlyle. My grandma wasn't quite as fond but seeing as this was her second sour ever (after Rodenbach Grand Cru) it was a bit of a shock for her. Slightly expensive but with good reason. This is a great beer for special occasions."
""
""
"Overall this was excellent. I have only recently started to gain an appreciation for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Indeed, for a cherry beer, Hanssens Oude Kriek has lots of candid, unvarnished Lambic qualities. Some fruit is appreciable, but not as much as the dusty cellar in which this surely spent considerable time aging before, during, and after the fruit was added. It's arguably one of the most genuine (least embellished) examples on the market. I loved it!"
""
""
"O - Really good beer. Very enjoyable drink. Price point is excessive for what it is. $22 @ Whole Foods Newport Beach."
"O - Great appearance, smells, taste... A great Belgian sour beer at a decent price (I think I paid about $10). I will definitely buy this one again if I see it on the shelves. Also, for those who care about food pairing, I really thought this was one of the best beers I ever paired with Filipino pork BBQ skewers and pickled papayas, who knew?"
""
""
""
""
"O - very easy drinking, especially on a hot day. not too overpowering with the cherries, one of the most sour beers I have had the pleasure of drinking."
""
""
"Overall: I believe this bottle is an exception and the beer is likely usually better carbed than this. Very tasty though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid kreik, though I find myself wanting a bit more balance at times."

"O - Very nice example of a sour kriek. My wife really enjoyed it too. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm glad that I gave this one a go. When I have an itch for a good sour kriek I will likely revisit this again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A fresh bottle. Pours a very dark red with a non-existant head. This beer is very acidic. Acid is predominantly acetic. This dominates but of course there is plently of funk but also notes of smoky oak and even some raw meat. Overall, a decent kriek but a little over the top with too much vinegar taste."
""
"Overall, this is too sour and the acetic acid is too strong, detracting from the cherry and funk aspects. Clearly, I didn't do this any favor by cellaring two years. Hope to try this again fresher/on cask."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O Pretty nice reasonably priced ans easy to find sour in my area."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Good Lambic Kriek"
""
""
"O:this is my fist kriek but I feel like I started off with a bang and I really like the style I am interested in seeing how this beer would change with age but I like it right now as I have a very high tolerance for sour which this really gives I would recommend it to anyone who likes krieks or sours"
""
""
""
"Impressive and seriously assertive. One of the better Oude Krieks I've had, although not quite in the league of 3F."
"O- A solid kriek, there are others that I like more but this is a really enjoyable beer, definitely worth picking up."
""
"Tastes a bit like an organic Shock Tart, like if something unnaturally intense were somehow robbed of its cloying fakeness and all that's left behind seems wholesome and real in spite of its intensity. It's like how exercise feels: a good high."
"While this is only my 3rd lambic or so, and only the first I've reviewed, I think I might be coming around to the style. On a hot day this would be quite enjoyable as-is, but I could do with a little more fruit and a little less sour. Those who are big on sour notes would do well to seek this out."

"Pours a dark amber red with lots of head. Tastes of cherries and dark fruits, with some good tart sourness finishing through. Not overpowering was the sour taste however. Drinks down really smooth and I would have no problem drinking more bottles of this. I love the way sours tastes on the tongue."
""
"After reading about the potential for aging the beer, kind of wish I'd done so. Oh well, just have to get some more and do so. Poured this at a good temperature with an amazing roiling head that is maintained by the incredible effervescence of this wonderful brew! No lace, clear amber cherry color and loads of teeny bubble trails. Aroma is cherry, musk, yeast, oak, vinegar. Flavor is brut champagnesque with a demure cherry presence and the yeast bitterness is exactly matched by the small sharp peaks of tartness from carbonic acid and wild yeast. Finish is like flavor, gradually diminishes, and is satisfying."
"Pours a clear, dark ruby red color with a bit of reddish/white foam. The smell initially was off to my nose (chlorphenols?). After the brew settle down a little, the fragrance was definitely that of a sour beer, but not a ton of fruit. The taste has a bit more cherry in it than the smell would suggest, but overall it's a pretty light beer. The sourness is pretty strong, but it ends up being a very nice refreshing beer. The carbonation helps give it a bit of lift as well. Overall, I would probably drink this beer more regularly if it was a bit less expensive and I didn't have so many other beers I still want to try!"
""
""
""
"What a delicious surprise of a beer this was. Wow."
""
""
"Medium body, nicely carbonated (unlike the experimental lambics) and dry on the tongue. A nicely done fruit lambic, although there's better available, especially considering the price."
"Overall. Nice dry kriek. Plenty sour without being overwhealming."
""
""
"O: A pretty nice Kriek, not in your face cherry, but good nonetheless."
""
""
""
"O: A good fruit lambic in a pinch, but at this point, it's more like a venomous Flanders Red. Or a Rodenbach Grand Cru with an extra dose of sour power."
""
""
""
"O: Solid lambic in my opinion. A nice step up from a Monk's Cafe."
""
""
"This has very mellow carbonation if any, with a light body. This is very good. I find this is one that has a lot of bottle variation. At times it's been one of the most acidic beers I've had. This particular bottle strikes a pretty good balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A"
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: An impressively sour and well blended lambic beer. The proportion of cherries just add to the tartness, and this beer ends up not for the weak of heart or stomach. Pounding acidity and a flavor that lasts."
"I love me some sour and funk. This certainly fits the bill, and I did enjoy my bottle. Though over barring, in a sense that even puts Cantillon to shame. If you want to impress some sour heads, this is what you should bring."
""
""
"Overall: A really tasty Kriek. It a bit expensive at 12 for 350ml C&C bottle, but its very enjoyable. The vinegar is a bit stronger than I like, but it not horrible."
""
""
"Drinkability: Bottle is just a hare too sour and needs a bit more complexity, otherwise a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Light to medium."
"O - I didn't like the raspberry very much but this one was a little better. The flavors are more balanced and the sourness is more manageable. For the right price I would get another but I wouldn't run to the store to get some like others from the style."
""
"Pours a semi-opaque dark crimson with no head and no lace. Smell is of sour cherries, funk, earth, and some woody aromas. I am getting a sharp whiff of acidic notes if I really stick my nose in the glass. Taste is of extremely tart and sour cherries, earthy funk, and wood. There is a very acidic feeling left in the mouth with each sip. This beer is basically flat with a very tiny amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer as it stands but the carbonation level is pretty lacking (which seems to be a common theme for Hanssens)."
""
""
""
""
"O - A good kriek, but well below de Cam and Cantillon for me."
"Overall: I'm rather disappointed by this beer, though it is possible I've got a bad bottle. How does a naturally tart and wild-fermented beer go bad? I don't know, but this beer is undercarbonated, over-tart and just not cherry enough for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Too much acidity without enough fruit to back it up. Even with more fruit, the lactic is probably too much and the acetic character needs to be taken down a bit."
""
"Lively carbonation, decently crisp. The funkiness of this one was really appealing; not at all overpowering, but fully integrated with the beer's other elements. However, I have to disagree with a handful of others who feel this is a good introduction to the sour style-it's strong stuff overall, with concentrated, intense sourness and acidity."
""
""
"M / O. Carbonation is just right for the style, no too fizzy, but stable enough to help move this along. The finish is lactic - tart, and lingers a very long time. A more advanced kriek, I wouldn't start a sour beer lover out with this one. 8 years ago I would have hated this, but today it's mighty fine!"
"375 ml bottle aged one year in my cellar. No best before date. Explosive cork. Served cellar temp. Clear ruby red color. Little to no head w/o an aggressive pour. Smell good: even though its made from cherries, I get a strong strawberry aroma. Highly acid just in the nose. Taste is tart and fruity, yet very dry. Only slightly carbonated. Flavor is darker fruitiness than smell. I believe the smell is mostly yeast and bacteria where the flavor pushes the actual fruit. Wide range of mouthfeels, lots of lactic acid. Kind of scorching and definitely a last beer of the night kind of beer. It literally made my tongue sore, and I love sour beer and drink them regularly, that's never happened to me before. I still enjoyed it. Unique and exciting."
""
""
"Overall: Hanssens Kriek certainly lived up to my expectations in terms of sourness, even though it didn't quite match the Cantillon Kriek of 2007. Aside from the sourness, this is a delicious beer and one I will seek out again."

"O- This is a Solid Lambic, well balanced, easy drinking, nice sweetness mixed in with the sourness, enjoyable."

"O: Sugary, sweet and pleasant. Good funk. On the acidic side but not harsh. Great drinking all around. Thanks again, Chad."

"Cheers!"
"O: The appearance of this brew is enthralling, but it lacks in the flavor & feel. Some carbonation would have really helped this one out."
"This beer has the lack of flavors and complexities that I find noteworthy in many others. It just seems like the vinegar and sourness show off too much and don't let anything else shine thru exept for perhaps some black cherries. And I love sour so it's kind of awkward for me to not like this one."
"A bit of vinegar in the finish, like a flander's red. This was a bit less desirable for me. Funky cherries. The most striking part of the beer was the very strong sourness, and the very soft, round mouthfeel. Would still drink this often if I could! I do wish the cask could be kept a bit cooler somehow."
"Conclusion: This is an awesome kriek, and one that I imagine would benefit from aging. The aroma is my favorite part of this beer. The flavor seems to me to be masked by the intense tartness and sourness, but know the little know about the blenders that made this, I think that the end product is exactly what they intend it to be, so I will strive to appreciate what they produce. If you are a lover of traditional lambic or of wild ales in general, I recommend you try this as soon as possible."
"O: This was great, paired nicely with the pie. Couldn't do more than a glass though."
"O: This beer is a perfect example of what over a century of traditional Belgian brewing can yield. This beer is perfectly crafted not only in the way it’s spontaneously fermented and blended with cherries but how it’s aged in barrels and then bottle conditioned. After all that, it comes out nearly crystal clear, with head, great carbonation and an amazinlgy crisp, refreshing taste. I can find it locally, but it takes time. This beer is amazing. 5"
"Overall, outstanding kriek! glad I got a carbonated bottle."
"O-I was a bit disappointed by this one. The price was okay, 17.99 for a 750. I think I was kind of expecting a little more on this one. The carbonation is really what lowers the score on this one. It was just too flat. I would not recommend this one."
"O-As krieks go, this is above average. I like that Hanssens really goes for it with the sharp acidity and bold fruit flavors. A little more carbonation wouldn't hurt."
"Overall a disappointment. I know that this beer CAN be amazing. So if I ever get a chance to spend some time with a fully carbonated bottle I will revisit this review. Until then the beer is deserving of my low score (and it appears I am not the only one to have had a similar problem)."
"O: The flavors are pretty good, and this thing is incredibly potent with tart berry flavors. With some carbonation I'm sure this is a much better beer, but as a flat beer it's very rough to drink. The acidity is very taxing on the back of the throat, and the tartness makes it feel like force-fed medicines. I could get this thing down if it was a magical elixir to cure all my problems, but otherwise this isn't drinking very well. I'll revisit this one, and I'll hope for a loud pop from the cork."
"Overall, a really nice, well done, fruit forward and sour kriek. Tons of cherry notes makes this refreshing and nicely complex. The lack of carbonation detracts a little, but not enough to keep me from buying this again sometime."
"Thanks to the magician :) of sarro tasting crew. Very old bottle (age unknown ~15 years). Aroma: Still very fruity despite the age. Obviously cherries, lots of barnyard funk, humid earth. Appearance: Beautiful red pour with decent white head. Flavors: Very sour but still enjoyable. Mainly wood flavors, some medicinal herbs. Cherries faded quite a bit. Something a little harsh about it. Palate: One of the driest beer I’ve had, low carbonation. Overall: Very interesting experiment. As for vintage fruit lambic, I slightly prefered the ’96 Gambrinus but this was very good too."
"This was a really great beer. I'd love to give this another go. It was one of my favorites from the tasting."
"O: sour, yes, one must at a minimum like sour beers before trying this. In general my tastes are going more and more toward sours."
"As it is I enjoyed this beer. The bottle was definitely left lacking for the missing carbonation. I'm not sure that I would buy another bottle but in the right circumstances I don't think I would hesitate."
"What a shame...I was looking for a more affordable kriek and I guess you get what you pay for. I'll have to stick Cantillon and Liefman's when I can afford them."
"O: This is my gold standard for krieks. Spot on."
"Overall: I really enjoyed my first cask lambic cask. The lack of carbonation was nice as it let me concentrate on the flavor."
"O- This beer is simple with an acidic bite to the finish with hints of cherries and wild critters and wood. They are all overpowered by the acid."
"Beautiful color, mostly flat, thin ring this is a very pretty kriek. The nose has a great cherry character, leathery, fruity and tannic with a nice lambic backbone. The cherry character is about as far from bright as you can possibly get. The palate opens with a blend of funk, cherries and noticeable sulfur. Rather fart-like, the sulfur gets in the way of enjoyability of the beer. Lots of sour cherry with leather and oak. Moderate vinegar, fruity acidity, this is mildly watery on the finish. Too much acidity for my palate, this is not as good as the bottled version IMO."
"A great representation of the style, and one I wholeheartedly recommend."
"A good sour. I usually do like a bit more carbonation and fizzy pop on the tongue to my lambic's. So this was sort of a let down."
"O- Not an expert in sours, but I really enjoyed this one. The acidity, vinegar, and tartness is not overpowering. Would recommend to anyone who has not had a lot of sours."
"This is a great brew. The flavors are very well balanced and prominent."
"Not for the weak of heart. I'm hoping to review this again down the line."
"Oddly enough, the lack of carbonation might show the balance off more on the tongue. It's also rather drinkable, once again proving that you can't judge a book by its cover... or smell."
"375ml bottle labeled Lot E with no other information. This beer poured a medium bodied dark, dark rich red in color with no a single bubble of carbonation. It poured really flat. The aromas are of slightly tart cherries with slight funk. There isn't much complexity. It tastes good, there just isn't too much going on. It tastes of subtle sour cherries with a light sweet tart esque finish. It drinks kind of watery in consistency but it easy to drink. Overall this is a pretty lackluster Kriek. I'm surprised because I normally love Hanssens but this one could've been better."
"Bought two bottles of this. One bottle had liquid almost to the top of the bottle, where the other bottle had liquid just to the mid-neck of the bottle. I chose to review the one with less liquid in it and cellar the other one. This beer pours an almost-clear, bright, ruby red color with absolutely no head whatsoever...thats why I chose to do this one now. I hope the other bottle will have better carbonation. Scent is very lovely with some amazing tart cherry aromas and a ton of FUNK. Hints of oak and balsamic vinegar. Taste is just mind-blowing. So many amazing flavors. The cherry is spot-on and just makes for a perfect Kriek beer. Amazing sour, barnyard funkiness with some delightful oak and lactic acid. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with no carbonation whatsoever. The sourness I just tingling all over my mouth from the inside of my cheeks to my teeth. Overall, I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this beer for having zero carbonation. I don't normally enjoy STILL beers."
"O - Fantastic all-around, this kriek is delicious with a huge sourness that's one of the more sour beers I've ever experienced. I grabbed another bottle to share with TheDTrain which wasn't anywhere near as sour. This one gets much better with some age."
"This was an exceptionally nice pairing with some spare ribs from Honey 1."
"had this on cask at the map room. First drink of the night and started the night off right. poured with the color of a nice red wine with about a quarter inch of bright white head. This receded to a small ring around the outside fairly quickly. The aroma had lots of acid, mostly with some vinegar acidity, not a ton other than some fruityness and acidity. Nice, but nothing super special. The flavor was very nice and refreshing and complex with good cherry and acetic and lactic acid, and some tannic red wine flavors. Pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel was very light with a medium amount of carbonation. Very dry. Overall, a very impressive beer. Good lambic."
"D: Wonderfully delicious. Still has all the classic elements and tartness is almost at the same level. However, cask version provides a smoothness that increases overall drinkability"
"Overall I really like this beer. I really like the style and this one hits the nail on the head. A big sour kick and nice cherry flavor. I'm going to have to grab a few more of these. Really great stuff, don't tell anyone though I don't want it to disappear from the shelves!"
"I still think it's quite enjoyable though and it's better out of the cask, I think this needs a food pairing ideally than casual drinking, I'd like to have dinner with this for sure, a nice dry aged steak seems in order but not sure how the vinegar component would fit. Perhaps a Kale vegetable and red wine vinegar reduction on the side and you have magic. I really want food with this beer."
"overall - pretty impressed, however, I found the beer to be quite acidic. I'll be looking to compare this Kriek to others such as Cantillon."
"O: This is now my third favorite kriek behind LP kriek and Cantillon 100% kriek. Much easier to find too."
"M/D: Mouthpuckering sour and has you begging for another sip. Not a lot of carbonation, works well though. Awesome beer for the style."
"O- A great sour cherry lambic. Worth the price, will pick it up again."
"Overall OK but not great, sour and tart, acidic, lots of cherry, fairly sweet, flemmy, but mostly no carbonation."
"O- I think I might overall prefer wilds to lambics...who knows in the end, both are solid styles. As for this one, it was good to try"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. Would definitely a beer I would drink again and again. Awesome."
"Pours a murky reddish with a bit of head around the edges. Smells like sweaty dog ass. Lots of funk on the nose. tastes sweet and funky. Vry very sour. Lote of cherry hitting hard. Good mouthfeel and fairly drinkable. Overall, interesting and fairly tasty but nothing special"
"M/D - Mouthfeel is harsh and tart but smooth on the tongue. Reasonably drinkable and great when shared among a group."
"Very neat beer. I'd have this again."
"D-very drinkable. Taste was gone in no time!"
"D - Well, you'd better like sours if you decide to tackle this one! Easily one of the most sour beers I've had, but I'm really digging it. One bottle is plenty for now, but I'll certainly keep one or two of these around for a special ""sour"" mood."
"This beer pours a beautiful ruby red color and has low carbonation and little head. The smell is wonderful light cherry smell a good funk and nice sourness. The taste is fairly similar to the smell with the cherries having a slightly more pronounced flavor and the sourness being stronger than the funk. This beer is sour and awesome I will be sinking more hanssens from now on. The mouthfeel lose points for being under carbonated but other than that it is thin dry and Puckering. This beer even though it is so sour is still very drinkable and is going to become somewhat of a regular in my lineup"
"D: A delicious Kriek. Nicely balanced and very complex at the same time. My first Hanssens... just leaves me wanting more."
"Poured into a tulip. The beer pours a nice red violete color with no head. But damn this color is great. The smell is sour. Sour cherries and barnyard with notes of red wine vinnegar all the way through. This is the most insanely sour beer! Lost of crisp sour cherry flavor. The feel is good, flat as far as I notice and light. A bit tough on the pallet after a while, but this one rocks hard."
"D- Hanssens makes some very good beers at an affordable price. Although they aren't quite Cantillon, for the price, they are close enough. Another winner."
"D- drink this one very slow and serve it at least 60.. enjoy the subtle nuances as it warms .. this one has a very dry and sour finish"
"Overall, this beer tasted absolutely magnificent but because of the low carbonation the drinkability suffers. I was completely satisfied after only 2 or 3 ounces and didn't really want any more. A fine beer for sure, but one that I would split many ways."
"This is one of my first ventures into the sour realm. I can honestly say that this is one of the most unique and intriguing beverages I've ever consumed. I now understand why there is such a strong following for beers like this, and I can certainly see myself digging deeper and deeper into the style."
"It's an extremely sour tart beer. I can see a lot of people not liking this but it works for me even without the carbonation."
"Beer is thin as expected and quite sour on the get on, there is a moderate tartness and a dry finish on the end. There is a malic flavor and a mild acetic flavor next, it's not as complex again as some others but it is quite good."
"I can only wonder what this could have been if it had carbonation. It is actually a pretty sour beer as well. Overall it is drinkable but without carbonation it's not the easiest drinking thing. I would like to retry this and hopefully it will be carbonated."
"D: With all of the sour flavors, this beer is definitely a sipper."
"Beautiful color pinkish read with a red tinted head that fades oh so fast. The nose finds some sour cherry, but much more acetic acid, red wine vinegar, sharp citrus rind, and a bit o' cherry pie. Like a sour punch to the face, wow. So much acetic flavor, vinegar, pithy citrus. Cherry mixes in, faint notes of oak. Not getting alot of brett charecter, or too much from the barrels. A hint of tobacco is detectable. Almost still in the mouth but carbonation is elevated by the sourness. Not the most drinkable Kriek around, but a top one that's for sure."
"Fabulous beer! With each smell it reveals new dimensions and one sip begs for another."
"wow. blown away every time i have one of these. glowing dark cherry red with no head, but a little collar that hangs on the whole time. nose is horse, barn, oak, earth (wet earth/mushroom) and tons of real cherry. very acidic. all is expressed simply wonderfully in the taste and the palate just opens up for loads of sour cherry goodness. it makes me salivate like crazy. virtually still and soft/silky medium body; it is so lovely i never want it to end. the most refined and elegant flavors are going on here and my gears are really turning. i just can't say enough good stuff. not for the faint of heart. very very sour. one of the best lambics i have ever tasted. seriously underrated in my opinion."
"Deep ruby red pour with little to no head. Almost still looking pour. Big cherry aroma with some barnyard funk. Slight vinegar/acidic aroma as well. Flavor has a big cherry sweetness up front, followed by an oaky/woody earthiness. Dry, tart, and astringent finish. Low to moderate carbonation with a silky smooth mouth feel. Mouth wateringly sour with a pleasant warming feeling as it goes down."
"D - The vinegar becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. My wife and I split a 25.4 oz bottle, so a smaller serving may have mitigated somewhat. As it was, the last few sips were a chore, although this was a very pleasant drinker early on."
"O: Not as drinkable as the Beersel (the only other Kriek I've tried) due to extreme tartness and tannic bitterness. Don't get me wrong, still a fine beer with all of the fine Kriek qualities. But for the money, I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Bottle: Poured a clear red color ale with a large lightly pink head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of funk and barnyard notes with some tart cherries. Taste is also a funky mix between some tart and barnyard notes with light oak and fresh tart cherries. Body is about average with good carbonation. Refreshing while being complex and funky as hell. Better then the strawberry with good controlled acidity level."
"From a 375ml bottle. Pours a clear red with a thin ring of head. After like 15 krieks all I can pull out here are the extreme outlying qualities of this. Band aid, hospital room, sour, dry cherry. Heavy acidity in the front palate, which just kills it for me. I'm thinking that it's really difficult to make a sour cherry or raspberry beer, lambic or otherwise, without that blinding acidity. Hanssens failed in this regard."
"Picked it up while looking for some Thanksgiving sours and it was definitely the highlight. The only other true Kriek I've had is the Lou Pepe which I aged for a year, and while this was a shade under that one the difference is negligible. Combines the sweet and sour aspects of the style superbly; the cherries hit first and quickly it quickly moves onto an excellence puckering sour. This would probably mellow out into a nice sweeter beer within a year, but I like it as is."
"D: Keep in mind that this beer isn't for everyone. The sourness will put some people off. That being said, I think it's a very drinkable beer."
"Certainly there are better examples of the style out there and at this price range, I don't recon I'll be picking this one up again."
"D-i must say this isn't very drinkable. it does not go down easily at all. its just entirely way too sour for me."
"drinkability: good"
"D= Not my favorite kriek lambic beer, but certainly a world class example nonetheless. I will drink this beer again in a heartbeat."
"**REALLY SOUR."
"(D)- A great lambic. Tastes great with a great balance and fruit profile. Crisp, and just plain enjoyable. Dare I say, one of the better Krieks out there."
"D: it drank good but fell a bit short side by side with the cantillon kriek. It is still a pretty damn good fruit lambic."
"A decent Kriek. Not up to Cantillon standards but not bad."
"Drinkability -- This is a sipping Kriek without a doubt. Mouthfeel problems aside, this is a pretty complicated brew. Not sure why I skipped it so many times. Well worth the purchase to sour ale lovers."
"D: A delicious, but intense kriek that even I had to take slowly. I think increased carbonation would have helped with the drinkability here (same with the Cassis)"
"D: Awesome, and completely unexpected. Man ... amaZING!"
"Mouthfeel is light-bodied with palpable carbonation on the tongue. This lambic drinks very well, albeit sipper-slow but very intriguing. This Oude Kriek is definitely easing my transition into the sour beers realm very nicely."
"Over all i lioked this beer, couldn't pick out many flavors but its really the sourness that satisfies me and this one has plenty of it. The first impression is deinitley wine. I would have liked a tad more carbonation, but its still good."
"I'm not sure I can finish this. Not so much because it's so bad, but because the pain my mouth and throat are in. I don't know what it's like to drink bleach, but it has to be similar to this."
"D: Definitely a sipper. Tart and tasty, but not something I would drink a whole lot of. A nice change, and definitely something to quench the sour craving."
"D- really sour but extremely tasty great for a once in awhile treat cant imagine going through more than one of these at a single sitting."
"A very nice kriek lambic. Funky, sour, and very tasty."
"D -- As with most good brews of the style, very good flavor quotient but high acidity content leads to a brew that you don't mind reaching for regularly, but can't drink in excess."
"D: This is traditional fruit lambic. I like the real fruit flavour in this beer, much more of a crossover from Lindemans than Cantillon would ever be, so there's something to be said for that, but still authentic to a T."
"D - The minor, sweet cherry note does a lot for drinkability. Being more tart wouldn't be a bad thing, but it would probably cut drinkability back more. At this point it's very tart, but feels manageable halfway through the bottle. My first from Hanssens, but I'll be looking for more."
"Drinkability is high, a very nice, refreshing fruit lambic. I couldn't ask for anything else other then a lower price! I'll have to enjoy this one again, defiantly worth a second visit soon!"
"D: Not the easiest style to drink, but such a refreshing and 'summer-y' treat. Drinking this in brilliant sunshine with a bowl of fresh Oregon blueberries. Perfect day. Excellent beer. Extremely worthy."
"A strange hazy blood grapefruit color with no head to speak of. Tart and acidic on the nose, like a slightly sweeter geueze. Some phenol in the nose too. Taste has the familiar lemony twang of a geueze, but with a hint of cheery peel. Moderate tannins dry the finish. The body and drinkability are right for the style, well in the good range. I'm not sure about the cherry flavor itself, however. It comes through quite pleasantly sometimes, but then it is sometimes very medicinal. I don't like phenol/medicinal flavors when they overpower the rest of the flavor. Not bad, I'll stick to the Oude Geueze."
"D-very good beer, great balance as nothing dominates, the flavors are well pronounced and work in tasty lambic harmony."
"D: Pretty intensely sour and I don't think I could quite handle a second serving of this. However it is a damn fine lambic, and this is my first beer from Hanssens. Recommended."
"Thanks, Arne. Pours the color of black cherries, darker toward the center and slightly translucent around the edges. Low carbonation and little head. Tart dark cherries dominate the nose, but there's a solid backing of sweaty funk. The cherry aroma has a lot of depth, smelling of skin, flesh and pit. Big tart cherry taste, acidic and dry with low carbonation. There's a lot of lactic sourness, tannic oak, a hint of buttery slickness. Very tart and fruity finish. Excellent stuff."
"The beer pours an orange-brown color with a tiny white head. The aroma is tart with some cherry and vanilla. The flavor is heavy on the tart cherries along with some nice character from the oak aging. Not extremely sour, but a great mix between cherry flavor and tartness. The beer is extremely dry. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Noticeably heavy mouthfeel, not viscous but big body. Taste of dark fruits but not very sweet. Very nice, a lot going on, some funk but not heavy. Quite balanced, in the direction of a very subtle acidity. Astringent tart finish (a drying and slight puckering effect on the inside of the mouth). Some noticeable tannins there. A great beer, quite drinkable."
"D: I could sip on this one anytime. Pairs very well with chocolate. Recommended."
"A says like a kiss between two punches to the face. We disagreed on the score to this one..."
"Drinkability: Very nice and a lot of fun. The moderate ABV and wonderful scents and flavors make for a very enjoyable experience. I will gladly drink this one again, and may even get another to put up for a while and see how it does with a bit more age on it."
"D- its one of the most sour brews I've ever had but its so tasty that you want more. I had no problem enjoying my half a bottle but might have been soured out if I had the whole thing."
"This is a fine beer all around, it is very sour, but also very tart, with a good underlying sweetness, a very well crafted brew."
"D: The high acidity makes it a little tougher to drink than other sour beers, but it has really great fruit flavors a surprisingly sweetness to balance things out a bit."
"Her mouth pull back quickly leaving me nothing but the hunger for more. I've never experienced such a velvety, smooth and sensual kiss before. Quickly she hurried away and before I could see where she went she had turned a corner and vanished. I was left with a burning pit in my stomach that could only be neutralized with her."
"Not my favorite lambic but not bad by any stretch, just wish it was a bit more layered and complex. Carb could have used a bit of sprucing up too. Not quite on the level of their geuze."
"This was certainly drank in classier surroundings than my first Hanssens, but its not as good as the gueuze. It doesn't quite have the complexity of that beer, and this one seems a touch unbalanced and a little harsh. I also like my krieks with a touch less sourness and a touch more funk. Its certainly a slow drinker because of the sourness, but its still an enjoyable beer, and with a few tweaks I think it can be phenomenal."
"D- I take my time with good lambics and I spread my glass over a hour or so, so I guess this one is good. Now I need to find some more. Great stuff that im surprised I have not tried before."
"D: Drinkability is good for a beer so sour. Requires small sips to appreciate the flavor. I think a gulp would be unpleasant."
"D - Not so good. This has some nice elements to it but is a little questionable overall."
"Both aromas and flavors are more gentle and slightly edgier than older bottles. The cherries are more pronounced and almost have a candy-like character. It's less acidic and less funky. It has more sweetness to it, due to the bigger cherry flavors. I preferred the older bottle since it was more complex, more sour and all in all more interesting."
"This one has great flavor, but the sharpness of the mouthfeel would keep most people from enjoying it in abundance."
"M + D: Tingling carbonation, medium bodied, with a puckering, dry finish, giving it a bit of a 'dusty feel' moments after finish. The sour qualities make it a sipping brew, but like a lemon, finish with that mouth-watering savoury note. Good stuff."
"drinkability is good. very funky and full of sour cherry character. very palatable with a nicely concentrated profile. cheers!"
"D: fantastic kriek."
"D- An overall enjoyable beer that is a bit of a sipper. There are better lambics out there."
"Wow talk about tart! Bought this one at the Bottle Shop in Carlsbad. Poured a nice red with a big bubbly head that quickly dissipated. Tart as tart can be!! Sour cherries, leather and funk come through in about that order. This is by far the most sour beer I have ever tried. LOVE IT!"
"Overall I enjoyed this beer a lot, and was happy to have the opportunity to try one of this style on cask. I don't necessarily think the cask makes the beer taste any better, but it's also certainly not any worse. It's just different, and worth a shot."
"M/D: Light body, carbonation isn't as high as first expected helping a very smooth body. Drinkability is very nice as long as you can stand the tartness."
"D- i liked this one a lot more than i was expecting to. something id like to treat myself to once in a while. i doubt that i could have another one. the sourness felt like it was quickly eroding my stomach lining and teeth. a wonderful night cap, but unless i was willing to wait a while trying something else wouldnt have worked out well."
"M- i could feel the sourness it had a good weight to it"
"37,5 cl corked & caged. Pours an orange-tinted ruby red with a thin head that leaves a hint of lacing. Just looks like a kriek should. Smells musty and fruity, like a basket of cherries sitting on a pile of straw. Has an earthiness to it as well. Wow. That's sour. The cherries start the party off, promising a sweetness that dives down underneath the sharp, apple-like sour note that comes on. Oddly enough, subsequent sips find the sourness disappearing rapidly & just leaving the crispness. I feel like I've got a sourness hangover, somehow. The aftertaste is malty and pleasant, really taking the edge off the finish. Really, really remarkable. The mouthfeel is slippery and light but not watery. Nice carbonation. The drinkability is really great, particularly for such a sour beer. A very, very nice sour lambic."
"Drinkability: By far the most acidic beverage I believe I've ever come across. Fairly tasty, but it's a real gut-wrencher -- you can literally feel yourself rotting away from the inside due to your newly-formed, bleeding Hanssens Ulcers. So, please, have some TUMS handy!"
"Pours a brilliant cherry red color with a fizzy off-white head that dies out quickly from all the acidity. Aroma is sour black cherries and a slight funky note. Flavor is tart cherry and strawberry with some nice acidity. Not too sour. Some funky oaky character on the finish. Medium-thin body, dry, lingering finish."
"This is indeed a world class Kriek that deserves repeated indulgences. BUT A WORD OF CAUTION: I naively followed it up with a Rochefort 8 and the latter was NOT its usual delicious. If you drink this, make it the last thing you drink for the evening."
"Poured into a tulip for a well-carb'd ruby body w/ one-finger light pink head and some sticky lace. A very tart/sour smell with cherry and some other fruit (like berries or grape) and hints of oak and funk. Light-bodied and smooth, slightly creamy even, with a good cherry taste that is slightly sour and sharp due to carbonation. Smooths as it warms, although ABV is slightly noticeable as you take your time. Hints of some earthy hops in there as well and cherry gives off some sweetness, but mostly this is a more dry, sour beer that is to be sipped like a red wine. Perhaps the only reason my grades aren't higher is I prefer Saison/Farmhouse Ale kind of sweetness over a dryness. That's more of me than the beer."
"This beer is a brownish-cherry color with a modest white head. The aroma is fantastic....lots of funky brett...horse, earth, barnyard and yeast. I love it. Some acidic scents as well, and a little fruit (cherry), but this takes a backseat to the funk. The taste is tart, sour actually, with more fruit coming out in the mid-taste. Bone dry. The sourness sets the stage for the mouthfeel...very puckering. Some carbonation. This stuff is great! It's exactly what I look for in a fruit lambic."
"This beer pours a hazy pale red color. There is no head to speak of. The aroma is of cherries, hints of nuts, and a significant sour/tartness. The taste is very sour. This is by far the most sour fruit Lambic I have tasted. There are still some tart cherries, but not as much as in the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer that I will surely drink again."
"Overall a very nice sour. If your looking for a traditional belgian kriek, this one will most certainly not dissapoint. A fine lambic, and one i am glad to be putting some age on. Good stuff"
"Overall, won't be buying or trying this one again."
"D: Yep, a sipper. Invites more and more, for sure."
"75cl bottle. Pours a hazy reddish brown with almost no head. Smells immediately of Brett character; kind of cheesy and musty. Some sour cherry/citrus. The taste is predominately, though far from overpoweringly, sour with some funk. Noticeable sweetness with cherry; tastes somewhat artificial. Some earthy, woody notes. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Not a fan of the sweetness."
"D - A Decent example of the style. But not something I'd drink on a regular basis."
"Overall, not too memorable, if only that I rarely make work of a 750 of anything but cheap champagne. Drinkability suffers because of price & the unmemorable qualities my limited short-term memory retains."
"D - Like I have already stated, this beer was like sticking several warheads in your mouth, it had a huge sour cherry kick that really made this beer undrinkable, not a good Lambic"
"Drinkability: this is a slow sipper based on the sour cherries and overall mouthfeel. One glass was enough in a session despite the overall enjoyment of the beer."
"Even with the solvent-like pinch in there, it's hard to stop drinking this one - the hand just keeps going back to the glass no matter what. That said, I think the carbonation in the bottled version does a lot to soften the bite of this one, which seems counter intuitive. Still worthy of a try."
"375 mL green champagne bottle with no freshness date. Not that it matters - it's been aged for three years before being released, and I've had it for at least a year and a half. It pours into the flute glass an auburn-tinged amber, fairly clear, with moderate carbonation and a thin, light-tan head. The aroma is nice and sour, earthy, with mouth-watering sour cherry that opens my nostrils like menthol. Insanely pungent sour cherries pinch my salivary glands and tingle the back of my throat on the way down. There are hints of wildness and oak that blend well with the extreme acidity, and little, if any, residual sweetness. The body is light and tingly, dry and puckering, yet it's crazy drinkable - but only a sip at a time. A delicious kriek that any fan of sour ales needs to seek out."
"Another fine artisan ale from this Belgian brewery. Pours a redwood color with a silky tan head. The nose has tart cherries, sweet malts, oak and funk. The taste is a nice balance between oak, manure, sour funk and sweet cherries. Crisp body drinks well. Pairs well with a fish and game."
"A little too tart for a kriek, I think."
"7/4/8/3/14 (3.6/5)"
"Overall: I've had krieks before that I thought were too sour for my taste but this one is so acidic it could probably put a hole through your skin. I couldn't tolerate more than a couple sips."
"D: Wow. I split the 750 but could have easily drank it by myself. This brewery does not fuck around when it comes to sour or tart. I gave the Gueze to my dad and he nearly threw up and thought I played a joke on him. The breweries air has more bugs in it than a stray dog. Worth trying."
"Good drop and a good example of the style."
"Pours a dark cherry/ ruby red with thin pink head that quickly dissipates. Funky sour aroma with sweet cherry juice, cherries and syrup. Very puckering and vinuous. Sweet cherry syrup flavor that stays sour throughout with a very dry and way too acidic finish."
"Drinkability would be a 5 if I could get this locally."
"I was expecting as delicious cherry lambic, I wasn't dissapointed. It was more acidic than expected. A possible aperitif"
"Very clear looking-amber in color with a very slight pink tinge to it. Extremely funky aroma-heavy black pepper and spicey aroma. Sour laundry thats been left in the washer for a few days comes to mind! Huge peppery blast of sourness flavor wise. Tastes like burnt horseradish. I find no real fruit characteristics in here anywhere. Good mouthfeel-the sourness really creates a zing on the tongue. Very different and enjoyable. On a personal level I would give it a 2 or 2.5 but that's because it isnt my thing beer wise. Freakin unigue for sure! A must try for any beer enthusiest no matter what your preference."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is interesting, but mouthfeel is horrible. I really wanted this to be great, but I'm not so sure."
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
"375ml bottle with no date, $6.49. Nice rose color with zero head and close to zero carbonation. The aromas are of musty, earthy cherries The flavor is more cherries, sour,tart, actually pretty good. The only problem I seem to have with krieks (including this one) is that the acidity is a little high for me."
"Reddish amber with a thin white head. Aromas of wet earth (mulch) cherries and barnyard. Very bracing acidity in the mouth, more so with the cherry flavor. Horse blankety and tart, but with s superb balance of funk, fruit, and acidity. Medium body with a sharp tangy sweet tart finish. Best Kriek Lambic yet."
"Kriek's just don't get better than this one. If they do, then they are well beyond my realm of appreciation. The pour delivers a promising Valentine red color, sparkling clarity and a head formation that's caught somewhere between creamy and spritzy. Aromas of pure lambic tartness, wrapped in berries and cherries dot the aroma profile, while giving a soft wheat, barley maltiness. Flavors are intensly cherries, vineousness, acidity, woodsy, white grapes, kiwi, and lemon zest. Mouth puckering astringency awaits in the mouthfeel, but totally expected. Quite efforvescent to keep the beer powdery, dry, and palate-cleansing. The beer basically evaporates in the mouth, leaving a tart hint of cherries and lambic tartness. Thanks Nathan."
"A wonderful beer in my opinion. Would be perfect with a vinaigrette salad or desert course."
"Luckily the meal that I had it with (rabbit in a nice wine reduction) was an excellent pairing that made the beer tolerable. A must-try, but be sure to have it with good food."
"Although I'm not very well traveled when it comes to lambics this is, without a doubt, an enjoyable drinker. Whether this is a world class cherry lambic, I have yet to see but the journey should be an enjoyable one."
"Pours a foggy reddish hue. No head. Nose is antiseptic and funky like I want the lambics to be. Ahhhh. Pure heaven. It's been too long since I have had a lambic. Oh how I have missed thee, my love. Mildly sour, but not overpowering. The fruit tones caress the tongue. Beautiful earthy tones. Feel is very, very smooth. Fairly full carbonation and the liquid is well bodied. Like I said. It's been some time since I have had a lambic. Now I remember why I love them so much. (actually...I never really forgot...how could I have?)"
"Upfront, taste is very sour and tart with a surprising hint, just a hint, of cherry sweetness way at the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, carbonation prickling at the tongue--so amazing. It really is incredible that this is beer. Drinkability is good--the beer actually makes my mouth water and want more. Its a shame there was only one 375 mL bottle. Oh well, maybe I will get another one at Abe's for just over four bucks! A steal at that price. Simply amazing. Prefer this over the Geuze which can get overpoweringly sour."
"Pours a nice ruby color with little to no head. Strong, sour aroma of, predictably, cherries, with farmhouse hay and wood. Crisp, nice, sour in the mouth. Finishes very tart on the tongue, nice and clean. I really appreciate the strength of the tartness. An excellent sample."
"Not exactly a session beer, but a very flavorful, tart lambic, one to be had many times."
"Enjoyed this beer at Hop Haus in Chicago, very traditional lambic. Pours a crimson hue, somewhat gritty but typical of the style. Very sour, but still had an easy drinkability for those of us out there that truely admire and enjoy the puckering ability of this style. This was my first experience with this Kriek and I was extremely pleasantly surprised. I will definitely purchase this beer again and will consciously seek it out for at least a great start or finish to a tasting night."
"Drinkability- Very good for me, but near impossible for others. I would rate this drinkability higher than most. Hopefully the ABV wouldn't be too overpowering. I found it quite soothing."
"Poured out of the bottle, this is an opaque red color, with a minimal head and no lacing on the glass. The smell is tart. The taste is complex, with a tart green apple flavor, a vinegery sourness, and a cherry sweetness all present, yet somehow blending together into a very interesting whole. The mouthfeel is refreshing and light. This tastes like a combination of a fruit beer and a Flemish sour ale. Drinkeability depends on how much one appreciates sourness in a beer. I don't think I could drink a pitcher of it, but by the glass, it is quite refreshing and delicious."
"Another winner of a traditional lambic. This and Cantillon are the only ""traditional"" fruit lambics I've had and they're both similar with their intense sour flavors. Cantillon may have the slight edge on this one in a couple of categories, but they're both great. If you're a fan of traditional lambics, definitely seek this one out. Recommended."
"Only better when dug out of the cellars surrounding Brussels with a meal from a local cafe."
"Brought a 750 ml bottle to a friend's house to have with dessert after a bbq. The homeowners were novices to lambics, so I was interested to gauge their response. Split the bottle four ways into white wine glasses. It had an earthy, cherry, and sour smell once I popped the cork. It poured a hazy red into the glasses. The taste was very tart at first, since I was expecting a bit of mellowness since this was a 3 year aged bottle. Once it warmed up some, the tartness grew on me. I think the rookies took a liking to it, and I was glad to introduce them to a new style of beer. Overall, it was a decent example of an oude kriek at a pretty good price ($10.75)."
"Smaller bottle, cage and corked, opens with a moderate ""pop", pours murky, low carbonation, dark apricot in color. Nose here is the always appreciated funky, sour, woodsy thing. This is a crisply sour brew, surely not for everybody, but lambic lovers will get into this one, plenty sharp, nasty sour notes that get lambic enjoyers (and I'm one of them!) excited. Some mild fruit in the background, cherry, strawbery, but this is about enjoying the sour goodness that this one delivers. Belgian lovers rejoice and go get some of this stuff..."
"Cheers!"
"I am growing fond of these sour lambic and gueze beers. Everyone warned me that once I start it will be nearly impossible to start and to expect my beer budget to increase. Well, everyone was right damn you!!! This is a nice tart and crisp beer that would be perfect on a warm spring or summer day."
"To me, this could and should be brought out weekly. It has a clean, but meal-like approach. Filling, and somehow mouth- watering. Very complex, and you don't have to be a beerman to enjoy it."
"D: One of the most balanced krieks I've had. Very easy to drink."
"Overall, this is a nice aperitif beer, with some great flavors. Well rounded overall, and a great example of a true kriek. Perhaps not a great beer to choose as someone's first experience in the lambic/oude category, but good nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Definitely too tart to drink a lot of."
"I'm going right out to buy another bottle. I guess I'm a sucker for punishment, and it's a terrific value at only $9.50 for 750ml."
"Overall - A good kriek... probably not for everyone but definitely worth a try..."
"Overall, pretty tasty although my stomach gave me hell for trying more than one glass. Definitely not the cloyingly sweet fruit lambics; this one leans more toward the Cantillon end of the spectrum for the style. Worth giving a try when you see it."
"Notes: Maybe I've been drinking sweetened lambics too much, but the sourness of this beer reminds me of a Flanders red ale. And I know it's hard to make wine/beer comparisons, but a wine drinker might really like this one."
"A worthwhile though slightly flawed beer."
"Drinkability: I'm not a big fan of lambics but I enjoyed this as much as possible for me"
"Intensely sharp and acidic with fresh fruit flavors that make you pucker up for more. Wet sock sourness continues into the flavor. Lacking in sweetness entirely, this is sour and tart all the way, though not in a bad way."
"I've had this bottle in the cellar for almost three years and I've had it fresh. I don't remember it being this agressive. For fans of sour lambics, I can say this seems to turn into a beast in the bottle if you lay it down for a couple years."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"Poured from a small corked bottle. Pours a reddish brown color with almost no head or sign of carbination. Smell has cherries and lambic funk. Smells and looks great. Taste is great as well. Cherries hit the tounge first then comes the mouth puckering sour tartness that I love in lambics. Not very sweet like some of the more commerical lambics. Mouthfeel is great, even with the low carbination, the cherry flavor fills the mouth followed by the bone dry tartness from the beer's acidity. Very drinkable. A great Kriek."
"750 ml bottle. Unknown vintage. Tan label with pinkish red lettering. Bright pink body leaning toward the red end of the pink spectrum. Fluffy white head. Average carbonation streams. Aroma is a wallop of funky vinegar with a very subtle hint of tart cherries and rank cheese. Not as outrageous as most geuze. There isnt any battery acid or anything like that. Mouthfeel is more subdued too. Im not feeling any extreme tartness or sourness. After a few glasses this one is downright mellow and very champagne like. Flavors are quite mild. Cherry is barely present. Most flavors are vinous, bordering on mild vinegar. Very approachable for this style. A good place to start for people trying to get into geuze/lambics."
"Mouthfeel is bone dry, mouth puckering, and acidic."
"Pours a ruby red. Flat as hell. Smell is an Earthy and lightly tart. Taste is POW! Tart then sweet then tart then cherry then tart again. Cherry sour patch kids. Interesting finish. Not dry. Mouth watering. Just when you feel the slightest touch of dryness, your mouth waters. Simply a superb drink."
"The taste was super tart... then some more tart after that. Candied cherries and sour patch kids. Incredibly delicious. Gets that pucker sensation all the way to the end of the bottle. Light and crisp on the tongue, easy to drink. A wonderful brew."
"Aroma is sour, yeasty with hints of dried cherries and musty soil. Color is amber leaning toward orange/red with a well established, firm white head. Flavor is quite sour with dominating notes of rotting oranges and hints of fresh cherries. Mild wood notes, but some cork flavors as well. Not sure of the date on my bottle, but it is probably 2004ish. I feel like this could age amazingly well, but as of now it still needs to sit and mellow out some."
"Enjoyed a bottle at the Market Avenue Wine Bar, next door to Great Lakes Brewpub. The vintage is not listed, however it states that it is aged over 3 years. Pours a very hazy amber/rosy color. Very small white to pink head, which disappears very quickly. Funky aroma of sour cherries, hay, and vegetables. Flavor starts tart, with some sour cherries. A few funky flavors come out that I would describe as cheesy. Finishes very dry, no sweetness at all. Soft carbonation. This seems to coat the mouth. Even with the unusual combonation of smells and flavors, I am attracted to this. A great creation, which demonstrates the diverse world that beer can be."
"750 ml bottle. Hanssens Oude Kriek pours out a brownish red color with a small head. The aroma is funky, though nowhere near the geuzue, with cherries and something metallic. Sour, acidic cherry flavor. Much more tart than sweet. Not as funky tasting as it smells. A nice balance of cherry to lambic flavor. A bit woody. Carbonation is low. Drinkability is great. A very tasty kriek, and not overly challenging."
"Well my first kriek, to be honest I'm not sure this will be my style. Pours a pink/orange color, no carbonation or head. Smells real funky, not pleasent but I don't know what exactly it is. Tastes very acidic and again a weird funk. Very thin mouthfeel. Overall not very impressed. That's just me though."
"Mouthfeel was good, but a little thin for the style for me. Taste was good and sour with cherry tones coming through strong. Not quite as powerful as the New Glarus Belgian Red, but smoother and more drinkable."
"Not much pop to the cork on this bottle. Reddish brown translucent appearance, no real head on the pour. Slipping dots for lace. Tart aroma, somwhat jam-like with light shoe polish tone. Carbonation is largely spent, but the body is pretty close to medium. Sharp astringency as appropriate, but not over-the-top and with an interesting sweet leathery lingering quality. Leafy with some alkaloids, and for me, not a lot of particularly distinctive cherry qualities. Finishes dry but full and not extremely puckering. I liked this one in drinkability while still retaining authentic qualities."
"bring me more free bottles dan ! Excellent lambic, I am enjoying this way too much, maybe I should pop a cherry... lambic more often..."
"P.S. I just poured the remaining 8 oz. into my glass, resulting in a change in clarity to haze. Sourness has become smoother and even more drinkable."
"I started this at 54 degrees. This is the color of fresh squeezed Montmorency cherries with the clarity of cloudy vinegar. Theres a silly wisp of froth that melts away and decides to hang out along the edge of the beer leaving lace. Describing these wild Belgian beers can be difficult because they provide an experience beyond any other beer experience. The aroma starts with a bowl of sour cherries. Now rip a cherry sapling out of the ground and pound the cherries with the dirty roots. Then take the bowl into an old, well used horse stable and sit down next to the water trough. The stable is decorated with garlands of blooming cherry branches, and sage and bay leaves. Now breathe deep. You will smell the horses, the straw, the fruit essences, and the well water with herbal and compost overtones. This is so sour my face is twitching. I think I taste sodden old barn beams. I taste green apples and green plums, wild cherries, pineapple sage and shiso, and sour whey. Whew, this beer is a challenge. I think it cries for shellfish and seafood. Theres body to it like an overripe cheese, melting and dripping with pungency thinned with sparkling sour juices. This kriek is an adventure that ends upstream at the source of a beer style that is inspirational."
"This is as drinkable as it gets. If you like lambics, this is a sure fire way to go. Not on the beginners side like Lindemans, but also not exclusively for the hard core geueze lovers. Simply awesome."
"One of my first real lambics, quite a surprise. Pours a cranberry juice red, rose red, virtually no head but a little lace, some proteins floating around. Smells like sour grapes, the wet horse smell, classic lambic! Tastes like sour candy, the sourness is right up front, then move to sweet candy flavor and sour fruit, with a very tart finish, a tear jerker. Mouthfeel was pretty light with good carbonation, very interesting, not sure if lambics are my style but pretty good, thanks sammy."
"Upon finishing my exit interview at college i returned to my now empty apartment and popped open this brew to celebrate. It pours very dead. A flat darkish red copper with absolutely no head at all but aroma seemed right on. A lot of tart and funk are easily detectable in the nose the dark cherries take a little while to sneak up. Taste matches the nose but a little hint of vinegar was present that left me perplexed. Mouthfeel was a little sticky as well. Not a bad beer but as long as its priced the same as my oude beersell krieks, I doubt I will be revisiting this one much."
"From notes, Pours a pale, pink color with a finger of head that fell to lightly coat the beer. The nose was Sour and tart, with a bit of acidity with sour cherry and a slight fruity sweetness. The flavor was almost puckering sour, tart and funkey initially that moved to a sweet and sour cherry with slight creamyness to it. The feel was thin to moderate with a moderate carbonation. It left some sticky spit on the back of my throat as I drank it. Very good beer. It was refreshing, not too sour. Very clean and crisp. I liked it."
"By the way I bought a case of the 750cc bottles from the brewery itself which is well worth a visit. But be advised that they don't open on Fridays until the afternoon, which is not what it says on the web-site."
"Poured a murky copper-red with only a lace cap. Nose was nice: berries, musty banana, wet horse blanket. Puckering mouth feel...this Kreik has more of a sour decernment than a tart berry profile, musty malty body is eclipsed by the sourness....finish is puckering sour...after a few sips you appreciate it more...this is well made but I prefer rodenbach."
"Orange-red appearance. Very smooth, not harsh on palate, not too sour, was expecting harsher. Sweet finsish. Nutty cherry and cidery aroma. A fine concoction of woodiness,hay, lemon and grapefruit and vinegar . Palate cleaner. Full mouthfeel. Real cherry?"
"Forced pour into wine glass yields a nice glowing amber color and a soapy beige head. Woody, barnyardy character with a good dosage of sour cherry essence. Very mouthpuckering and tart, which I find equate to greatness in a lambic. It really hits the salivary glands, yet an oud bruin-like maltiness is maintained through the sourness. A bit syrupy in mouthfeel, but not overwhelming. Very noteworthy and drinkable, finishing dry and cleansing with residual sour cherry-laden acidity."
"Drinkability and Overall: I really like Kriek Lambics, and this one is killer. This is one of the better lambics I've ever had. Incredibly smooth, tart, but highly drinkable. This is really one to try if you like lambics. This is new beer #6 of my session today, and it's incredible."
"Smell is oak, oak and further some sourness. Well it always takes up some time to get into the taste of a fine kriek but this one is realy hard. Lots of oak and sourness and of cherries not much left. Good if you like extremes but for me just to sour. And even with the sourness not fresh but just full of oak and muffy smells... and then after more then 10 minutes analyzing taste and smell I got the taste, finaly cherries comming up and enjoying the Brew, finding the malt yeah its a good beer."
"And yet its moderate balance of the characteristic lambic notes creates the more moderate experience needed for quaffing. A nice kriek that I'll go for again, at least the best available in Michigan without the presence of Cantillon."
"I supppose I'm just not evolved enough to appreciate the finer points of this style. Perhaps a little more exposure to this style will open my mind. I didn't score this lower because I felt like this is the way this style is intended."
"Very nice for style, and pleasantly drinkable. I would have given this Lambic much higher scores if some cherry aroma and flavor were present."
"My first true Belgian Kriek. Pours a thick amber with a pinkish tint around the sides, a nice pinkish white head with tiny bubbles. It's picturesque. A brief aroma of sweet fruit followed by a horrible barnyard aroma. Sweaty horse blanket, yes indeed. I don't care for it at all, but this is what I was told to expect for the style. The flavor is different starting with a sweet ketchup (yes I said ketchup), followed by a strong tart cherry/crab apple flavor. It finishes slighty sweaty with tiny champagne like fizz. This is definitely not my type of beer, but I believe it to be good for what it is. Realistically one and out."
"Glad to have tried it, but not something I'd be willing to go after again."
"ng"
"The beer dispenses from the 375ml green wired and corked bottle a deep luminous orange with a minimal in size head that is frothy and the color and off white, the remaining lace a velum like film to cover the class. Nose sweet with a tart backing, fresh and pleasing to the eye and nose, start is sweet with the top light in feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, sour, vinous, exceedingly dry, a drinkable beer."
"Nice color reminiscent of a certain drie fonteinen framboos, dirty brownish red, but at the same time orangey with a light haze. Shy off-white ring though. Rather mild aroma, musty, barnyardy. Not as complex as many other lambics as far as the nose go.Very phenolic, horsey and sweaty. On the tongue though, the yeast expresses itself in a serenade of funkiness. Give me a shot of this someone. Highly intense mouth presence. Multiple levels of acidity, all at once citric, acetic, lactic and balsamic. Funky cherries, obvious cask wood, horsey, hay, must, lemon and grapefruit juice. Soft carbonation, medium body lets the flavors express rather than stealing the show. Almost tear bringing taste."
"Pretty tasty stuff, but a dessert drink to be sure, and for my tastes, a little expensive for what you get (though understandable as it's imported and aged 3 years), but definitely worth trying at least once."
"This is far more tart than other krieks I've tried, but still delicious."
"Definitely a ""treat"" beer that you respect and drink in low quantities."
"Plenty drainable. Nice enough (and foul enough) Kreik."
"375ml bottle. Poured a hazy copper red color with a pinkish head that quickly fades. Aroma is musky, dank and earthy like an old pair of socks. Taste starts off with the cherries, then the sourness of the gueuze kicks in. The finish is very dry and you get a little sweetness in the end as the sourness fades. Very nice!"
"Hot pink color and very limited head and carbonation apparent in the glass. Horse blanket funky barnyard nose with very little fruit in the nose. A very funky taste with funky, barnyard , earthy, dry, sour cheery twang tastes. Viscous coating mouth with a dry cherry finish on the tongue. Medium acidity. Quite refreshing and quenching.."
"This was a very unusual but awesome tasting beer. The cherries seem to leave but not fully and are almost taken over by grapes. The cherry and grapes tasted very well together but were overtaken by the sourness. Very sour, very tart and very very dry. This is not a sweet kriek at all. The sour flavor forced me to close my eyes and just let my facial muscles cringe together in total joy. Very tasty."
"A truly intriquing representative of the style, as I must admit I've only encountered sweeter versions before. Now I know what those lambic-lovers are talking about!"
"Drinkability is really dependent on whether or not you like sour beers. I like it, but this is too intense to drink all the time."
"Beautiful cherrywood tone to this beer. A good sized bone white head is erected, but deflates almost as quickly. A bubbly collar remains. Some sparse oily lace is left behind as I drink. Nose consists of tart cherry, musty wet horse blanket, lemon rind, vinegar. Very heavy nose. But good. This lambic doesn't have that mind blowing puckering ability that Cantillon posseses, but this is good in its own right. There's a nice sweet and sour blend in this one. Tart cherry. Acetic acid. Sour lemon...they all check in. But so does a sweet and sugary cherry flavor. (This is a traditional lambic, but it is quite tasty and drinkable.) Also a little of that ""barnyard"" flavor that I love in my lambics. Light body with a fairly lively carbonation noted. This one's a winner."
"Bone-dry finish which makes you crave another sip."
"Hazy maroon hue. Head audibly fizzles into a thin, spotty pink tinged white foam ring that clings and manages sparse lace. Pronounced wet horse blanket and musty hay in aroma, contrasted by a vibrantly tart impression of immature, budding cherries. Subtle sherryish oxidation notes and a bittersweet lactic presence surfaces as it breathes. Intense and enticing aromawise. Acerbic acetic acid bath incipient in flavor is ensued and offset by sweetly woody cork and hints of grainy wheat. Tartness begrimes somewhat mid palate, with enteric, bile acid notes competing with citric, fruit derived tartness for dominance. Fruit presence is surprisingly tepid in outright cherry character, and at least when combined with the microflora derived fermentation end products is more of a pucker inducing, sour citrus kuwkuat nature. Woodiness augments slightly late, and a vinous, oak aged sherry vinegar impression forms late. Quite dry overall, yet a soft viscosity is acheived in mouthfeel. Finishes with a nearly seemless tart extension, albeit with a slightly sweet balsamic tinge. Hanssens Oude Kriek is almost a great lambic. Fruit flavor and bacterial acidity haven't quite coalesced yet. Superbly tart and satiating nonetheless. With cellaring this will be top notch."
"Quite a cherry red color to it, a bit hazy with a light tan head. Aroma is sour with a bit of cherry in the nose. Fruit overwhelms any other aromas. This beer is actually sweet (makes one wonder if the add unfermentable sugars to it) though definitely not sickly so. Has lots of good lambic flavor, though the sweetness was not what I was expecting from a traditional bottle conditioned Kriek. Quite sour still, and please don't think that I am putting this in the same category as Lindeman's and there ilk. This beer does have a very good cherry flavor to it."
"This traditional kriek lambic pours a glowing red color with a pink-shaded head. Absolutely beautiful. The nose is almost overwhelming with a huge musky, effervescent, funky aroma that one could smell across the room. Reminded me of dirty socks and funky cheese -- perfect for the style! Taste is huge on real cherry flavor. It's very tart and astringently sour at first, but once the mouth becomes acclamated, a sweet, sugary quality follows. The mouthfeel is somewhat carbonated at first, then turns somewhat syrupy, all while maintaining a distinctive level of refreshment. This is an impressive creation."
"This poured an auburn color, like seltzer with a drop of blood. The head was a splash of bubbles that dissipated to nothing very quickly. No lace. It posses an overwhelming nose: musky, vinegary, and funky. There's a hint of cherry but the lambic power is tops: tart, astringent, sour. The back of my tongue was seriously puckered. You can really appreciate the craftsmenship in the making of this classic style. Not for everyone."
"-F"
"Red in color with very little head. Horse, grass, and tartness come across in the aroma with only the subtlest hint of cherries. Sweet, slight fruit taste that really demonstrates mastery of brewing. Very dry finish that leaves a tanginess on the back of the tongue. By far my favorite kriek."
"To amuse my girlfriend I sent the cork of the 750ml bottle off of the ceiling, then window, then computer monitor. Some explosive force. Despite the impressive pop, the beer poured without a head, only a wispy ring. The body itself was hazy and pink, but it was tinted slightly brown. The beer smelled like sour, dusty cherries. Very nice. This was what a kriek should be. Tart with nice black cherry flavor. It wasnt sweet at all, but as it warmed a little bit of sugar came out. Thankfully this beer never came close to Lindemans."
"This lambic poured a clear, reddish amber color (more towards amber than red), with a trace of white foam. The aroma was evident from the moment the bottle was uncorked: a very tart/sour smell (similar to a Gueze) with only a hint of dark cherries and some musty grapes. The taste was very tart, and cherries take a back seat. This is not a sweet Kriek. Other flavors were oak, musty grapes, wild yeast, apples, and some earthy flavors. The mouthfeel was typical for a lambic, but this one was a bit puckering, though crisp and clean. The drinkability was very good, though this one was closer to a Gueze than to a Kriek that I am familiar with. I guess I am getting to like the more tart lambics after repeated exposure."
"Sour! The scent reminds me of amishland outside of Philly close to where I grew up. It wasn't very pleasing, rather tough to breathe in. But then the taste. The flavors are very much enjoyable. Very sour cherries, smooth mouthfeel, and a dry finish. I'm amazed that something that smells this weird can taste this good. Lambics definitely need some time to grow on me. This one was rough at first, but as I drank a few more small pours, it got better."
"So, drink this beer whenever you see it. Or Else !!!!"
"Clear and deep harvest orange body, with a few strong trails of CO2. Small, fizzy head. Moderate head retention, witha a thin lace continually remaining atop the brew. Richy, musky, horse-blankety aroma with strong undertones of tart cherry and light hints of spicy hops. Very sour flavor, rich in tart cherries. CO2 makes a big statement in the slightly oily mouthfeel. This seems to me to be what a true fruit lambic is all about!"
"Pours a hazy reddish orange color with a big, slightly red tinged, white foamy head that soon subsides down to a thin film. Classic lambic aromas of musty air, barnyard, hay, blankets, and sour aromas are accompanied by a nice tart cherry twinge. Quick sour cherry taste bites the tongue and slightly puckers the cheeks. Musty basement tastes, kind of like my parents cellar a few days after a bad rainstorm and the cellar has finally dried out, along with some great lip puckering sourness slowly work on your cheeks until they are completely shriveled up and sunk in. Barnyard and decaying hay smells are present as well but are slightly subdued by the cherry flavors. The cherrys ride through in the background before coming back to the forefront in the finish with a quick sweet tartness. Nicely medium to light bodied with great lip puckering and tongue shrivelling properties, although not quite as tart as I like it. An absolute joy to drink, Lambics by themselves are almost reason enough to move to Belgium."
"Very interesting stuff, really smelly barnyard/dirty nappy nose, quite balsamic acidity, with a soft cherry aroma noticed. Sour, of course, the way it should be, dry. Nice balance of kriek flavour in their, just the right amount, a very nice kriek lambic, if only i could get it down under, i miss Belgium."
"Rich with age,this beer you could sniff out the rusticness,is that a word?But anyway.Almost a barnyard smell.Complex like a fine Champagne,with a tart ligering finish."
"A magnificent beer! Loads of real cherry flavour. Crisp, sour, funky, horsey ... absolutely delicious!"
