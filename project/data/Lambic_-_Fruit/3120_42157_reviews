"For me, this would need to be a little more dry and sour for it to be a very good kriek. I've definitely had a lot worse (NB, Timmermans, Big Sky) but I've definitely had a lot better too. Mouthfeel seemed a little too thick. Sweetness is probably the right amount, but tastes a tad high, prolly because I wanted more acidic, tart, sour and dry notes coming out of it. Definitely the darker cherry variety."

"Pours a dark cherry red with a pretty pink quilt. Smells...Fucking stinks. Jesus anal farts, diacetyl, feet, popcorn, rotten corn and a bit of pinot. This is one, if not the, most offensive smelling beers I've come across. Just a fucking abomination of a nose. So scared to taste it... Tastes real bad. Metal and fetid mushrooms and rotten sox rubbed on fungus infected ball sacks. Fucking nasty. Hella dry and thin with hi carb. I'm repulsed."
"Also - this one should have wine-makers shakin' in their boots!"
"T: I was expecting this to be sweet, but this is tart as hell. Tons of unripe cherries and tannic cherry skins. Some notes of funk in the background. Another solid beer from Alpine."
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic North American take on a Lambic. All the right funk in the right places and a good fruit presence. Ultra dry as well. Try this beer. I'd say it's underrated here."
""
""
""
""
"D - Pretty drinkable. Tastes a bit off, but not too bad. The sour cherry flavor is nice, just a bit of cheese mixed in."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm steadily losing faith in Alpine's ability to produce reliable barrel-aged beers. This was quite awful; even at a large party, most of the bottle was left unfinished."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a decent and interesting beer, though not my favorite from Alpine. The taste is nice and pretty much what I was hoping for, but the nose is very funky in a blue-cheese kind of way, which knocks it down for me. Glad to try it but probably wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
"O - Seems the bottles have been better then the draft. I enjoyed the entire contents of the bottle and went though it with no problem, which is saying a lot. Gave some to the wife and she enjoyed it as well."

"Surprisingly pleasant kriek with well-balanced fruit flavors and tartness. Wasn't expecting it to taste this good based on the aroma. A decent beer I'd be happy to re-visit again in the future."
""

""
""
"Beer is light and very sweet, definitely not a favorite of the night and not a repeat. Shame on me? Shame on you."
""
"Pours a murky cherry brown with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour cherries and some funk blue cheese like aromas. Taste is of very sour cherries and some extremely funky flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good kriek with a weird smell but a very nice taste."
"Pours a reddish purple with a thin light pink head that fades down into a collar. The nose carries some cherry juice and light earthiness to the background. Somewhat musty. The flavor has a bit of an odd creaminess to it along with mild must and earth. Light to medium body and slightly chewy. Not really a bid fan, whether as a wild or just as a fruit beer."
""
"D - A decent beer. Not worth the price, IMHO, however. I realize it would have a high cost to produce."
"A decent American interpretation of the style, but there are significantly better options within the style at far more inexpensive price points."
""
""
"O: Pretty average as far as lambics go. Flavors are fine but lacking complexity. Quite mild on the sourness scale."
""
"MF/D: Crisp bubbles dance across the tongue, could easily drink several glasses... or bottles... of this sour. Delicious!"
"O-Smell gets more complex as it warms and becomes enjoyable. This beer is good now and has enough body to hold up and add complexity over time."
"On tap at Alpine (2/29/12). Pours a dark ruby. Light pink head. Not a very big head, about a finger. Disappears into a ring around the top of the beer. Nose is funky, much like provolone cheese. No tartness comes through. A bit of sweet cherry can be found in the back. On the tongue it is sweet. Sweet cherry flavor with a hint of funk and residual tartness. A little vanilla towards the end. The sour character is not big at all, its very subtle. This allows the delicate cherries to shine. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, with low carbonation. But gets sticky as it warms up. Lasting flavor afterwards. Awesome treat."
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer due to the fact that there was only a mild sourness to it so I found it very drinkable"
"With a nice contrast of sweet and sour and layered flavors, I could see non-beer fans enjoying this brew, especially those that prefer wine."
""
""
""
"Drink- Im not sure I know who brought this but I cant help be thank them for this retired beauty of a beer. Simple, clean, and holding up well. Would love to grab a batch 2 if they do one."
""
""
"O: A fun surprise to try for sure! All-around a wonderful beer. My palate was all kinds of shot when this was consumed, but it was still quite memorable."

"Solid if unremarkable wild ale."
"From notes. Pours a cloudy light reddish amber with a pink head. Aroma has lots of sour cherry pie flavor. It's sour and fruity with good funk and a touch of malt in the background. Lots going on. There's some oak and acetic notes in there, as well. Taste has some mild sweetness that works pretty well and a good puckery finish. Mouthfeel is medium carbonated and surprisingly sour. Some drying oak in the finish. No booze - always good to see more lower abv sours. Good stuff."
"I’ve always been a fan of Alpine Beer Company. I always associate them with IPAs. Who knew they’d do such a nice job with a barrel-aged Lambic featuring wild yeast. I’m honestly a bit shocked at how good this is. I never tried it fresh. Perhaps it’s just improved over the past three years. I don’t know if Alpine ever plans on brewing this again, but they should strongly consider it. Very impressive."
"O: I liked the flavor but it felt like it was missing something. The cherry wasn’t over the top, nor was the oak, tartness or dryness. I enjoyed it though, and would drink again."
"O- a nice surprise in a rather crazy tasting. The sour really hits hard and you can feel its for a good while after."
"The beer is a light orange color and is mostly clear. The head is fairly thin and fades after a few moments, leaving faint traces of lacing. The aroma is awesome! Huge, delectable scents of oak and sour cherries. The beer tastes great. It is sour, but not puckering. The aftertaste is fleeting. I do wish the tartness and fruit would linger longer. It is acetic, but not overly so. I am very glad to have tried it. Overall, a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall, an ok beer. Fairly enjoyable and a bit above average for the style. I wouldn't mind drinking more of this one."
"Drinkability: Although it lacks the horseblanket funk, there is plenty of mouth-puckering tartness here; the oak is nicely done, too"
"D: Tartness is kept in check and balanced, very drinkable for the style."
"If you don't know what Chez Monieux means then shame on you. This is another corker from the good folks at Alpine that should please aficionados of the style to no end. I still prefer their hop-blasted American ales, but this one is a real treat that deserves to be brewed again. If ABC decides not to, then Chez Monthem."
"D: This is a pretty easy wild ale to drink as it's not overly sour and doesn't have much (if any) funk to it. That said, it's not my favorite for these reasons, but serviceable."
"Could use more carbonation. A gentle introduction to the style."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable."
"Drinkability- I know this doesn't sound like the greatest endorsement ever but the beer is still good, just not very Lambic like. It's fairly fresh and fruity at times with a slightly vinous side. Interesting and tasty but definitely not worth the price tag. Thanks much Jack!"
"We got this on a recommendation, and it turned out very well. A very solid sour that I hope to have again."
"D-Nice and tart, well done. A lambic made as well as thier hoppy beers....the accomplished brewmaster never ceases to amaze me! Well done Alpine!"
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/3.5"
"Thanks to Deuane for sharing a bottle of this at his recent tasting party. Poured from a 750ml bottle on 3/21/09. Poured into my glass and appears a clear deep amber color with a pinkish hue topped by barely a finger of off - white foam. Smells and tastes like a huge bowl of vinegar soaked tart, sour cherries. Mouth puckering, pungent, funky, fruity, and spicy. Moderate carbonation with a medium body and a dry, dry finish. For me, a sour beer such as this is rather quenching, but I personally would never seek out another glass in an evening. Overall, a very decent first attempt on Alpine's part. It will be interesting to see what other sours come out of this brewery in the future."
"D - Very good take on the style, especially for their first try. While it's not one of my favorite styles, I found this to be nicely done and on the mark."
"D: If not as pricey, I'd definitely have this again (and again)"
"Very interesting and unique lambic-style beer. I don't think the vanilla from the oak meshes well here, but overall it was well worth a try."
"drinkable. good after taste. smooth. very little carbonation. overall im glad i tried it. im not sure its worth the 18 dollars paid for it. but meh."
"(3.3/5)"
"Pours reddish copper, lots fo carbonation, and a flat white head. Vinuous cherry nose, some oak and malt, almost like a cherry cobbler. Pucker-type sour as opposed to the bretty-dank sour. Good blalance of the sour cherry and sweeter malt, tempered by the oak and vanilla flavors. A bit medicinal at times, but not enough to ruin the beer. Always a treat with Alpine."
"I think I liked this more than anyone else that had it that night. Lovely, lovely beer."
"Overall: This beer is great. I love it, and I wish I had more. It was worth the wait. Way to go Alpine."
"Mouthfeel is lighter with mellow carbonation. Goes down easily enough, just make sure you have some antacids nearby! A tasty interpretation of a kriek here, but I do agree that at $28 it was overpriced. A good bottle to share and I'm glad autumnaldave shared this one with me as I shared my Briscoe!"
"Notes from 8/13/08"
"Pours a red hue with a touch of white foam at the top. Nose is harshly sour with strong vinegar tones. Real strong antiseptic fragrance. Flavor is actually quite smooth. Sour and fruity, the cherries add a nice touch to a moderately sour brew. Definite barnyard funky on there as well. I also feel like I am getting vanilla here? Liquid is smooth and the carbonation is low. This is surprisingly easy to drink. The nose was advertising different, but it ends up being quite nice."
"Tastes clean bright light cherry. Strong carbonation mies with tart from cherry and lifts the beer off the tongue so the finish dries. Almost an unripe cherry flavor. Lactic tart is not overbearing. Md-light body. Great summer quencher and good drinkability."
"Pinkish yellowish color. Small white head that unfortunately doesn't have any pink shades. Fairly nice nose with hints of cherries, as well as some wood. Flavor doesn't have a lot of depth, but has some nice elements of cherry , sourness and wood. Nice balance of sweet and sour. I like this ale quite a bit."
"Pours a very interesting strawberry red color but with very little head. What there is fades almost immediately. Smells of tart cherries and a bit phenolic. A touch of almond and cream as well as a bit of funk. The taste is amazing, however. Bright, bright cherries followed by some acetic qualities and some light horseblanket funk that then fades into a beautiful cherry cream flavor. Very pure tasting, especially the fruit and the sour elements, but with just enough fruit to make it interesting. A bit of sweetness at the end rounds it out and gives it the slightest bit of cherry creamsicle flavor. Overall, though it is quite tart and not sweet. Mouthfeel is clean and pure and nicely sour. Very nice effort and definitely a bit different from other sours."
"Thanks Dave for plopping down the $$ for this one. It was one I wanted to try but had not sprung for."
"The body is dry with a nice tart finish. Very light carbonation as per style. Overall a fun beer for the palate. A lot of hidden descriptors to really enjoy. The cherries real add a depth to this beer. And as the beer warms the wood characteristic add even more complexity and intensity that really a fun beer to drink. Even the wifey enjoyed."
"Drinkability: amazing, I can drink this all night long. I rarely say this, but the hefty $28 is well spent. Not over hyped at all. One of the best beers I've had this year!!"
"Bottle courtesy of Gford217: Poured a light red color ale with a light pink bubbly head with some average retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of red wine and tart notes with some light sour cherries. Taste is a mix between some sour cherries, with some tart notes with loads of oak and some red wine notes. Average carbonation with limited funk notes when I was expecting a lot more from the description. Overall, I though this was easily drinkable and maybe a bit light for the kind of beer it would like to be."
"As much as it pains my wallet, I will be seeking out another bottle of this beer. It's worth it."
"Pours a thin reddish, almost rosy pink color. Smell is lightly creamy butterscotch and sour cherry. Taste is thin and tart cherries. Definitely shows sign of tartness, but still feels overly simplistic, like thin juice, and doesn't have any funky complexity or anything. A certain amount of acidity and dryness in the finish as well, but also has a faint buttery finish to it, perhaps from the diacetyl, too. While this wasn't terrible, I cant say I enjoyed it, with or without consideration of the price."
"Overall I would have to say this one was excellent. Was it worth $28 a bottle, I am not sure, however I will tell you this, I would most certainly buy another one. I think this is something everyone should get to try. It is rare to see an American brewer but forth such a quality effort in this style, and this was simply outstanding. I cannot wait to get to try it again. One of the best I have had."
"Pours a clear, dark pinkish red color with a light rose head that fades really fast. The smell is tart at first, but after that it is big on the sweet and sour cherry. You get both components, but mostly a sour cherry smell. The taste is nice and moderately acidic, cherry there unmistakably. The mouthfeel on this beer is very light and effervescent. I actually wouldn't have minded a fraction higher body on this. Really a good and interesting sour beer to drink. Not as complex as I would think, but pretty straight forward as far as acid + cherry goes. Tasty beer."
"D: After the initial sip, and I was skeptical about paying $27 a bottle for this. Good thing no one I know likes lambics, so I had to drink the entire bottle. This gave me and the beer some time to ""warm"" up to each other. This was a great treat, but probably a one time deal for me at the price. Give it a shot, but share the weath...my only regret."
"This is a very good beer and I would love to drink it again but the price is a big setback (around $28 a bottle). I'd say that Alpine did a good job with this beer."
"Price tag scared me at first but I am sucker for both Alpine and lambics, although at a little over a dollar an ounce I was still skeptical, so that did not help me out in holding back on this one, one of their best brews yet, probably would not drink again for this price but it was awesome and I enjoyed every drop of my glass, highly recommended"
"Good lambic overall, but not spectacular. I was a bit let down by the finish...falls off pretty abruptly. Otherwise, this could have been really good. I really like to see another American brewer take a shot at a lambic, and this is a good first effort indeed. That said, the $28 price tag is a pretty steep price to pay when there are bottles of Cantillon Kriek available for $8."
"Pours a stunning rustic ruby with a half finger faint pink head that quickly dies down to a ring of various sized bubbles. Stickiness is just about non-existant, ho-hum. Smell is super funky. A lot of sour oak and a touch of vinegar. I was hoping the cherry would be strong, but unfortunately I was let down. Weak sour cherries with some cranberry and a grassy scent. Some pepper and spice tickle the nose as well. Interesting, but I could use more cherries in the aroma. Funky cherries up front on the tongue followed by vanilla and oak. A strange combination of pepper and buttery biscuits midway through, weird. Aftertaste is a bit dry with a touch of merlot, leather, and oak. Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied with stinging carbonation. Refreshing for sure, this beer went down much easier than I expected after the first sip. Chez seems to grow on me as my tongue adjusts to the funkiness. Not too sure about the $28 price tag, but it's still a good beer none the less. Keep up the good work Alpine."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs Pharmacy, Imperial Beach CA"
"Notes: Very nice stuff. Definitely not a lambic, not in the traditional sense at least - there's absolutely no funk here, and the sourness is quite tame. This beer is more comparable to Russian River's Supplication or Lost Abbey's Red Poppy."
