"Paid $100 to consume at a bar, my first Cantillon. Good, but way too much hype built into this."

"Deep red in color, Bold cherry that is neither sour or sweet, but slightly tart."
"This is a classic and one of the best lambics there is. So good."

"I think the brewers at Cantillon wish that people preferred the 100% lambics over the ""Lou Pepe"" versions, but my taste buds agree with most people."

"2013 vintage. Smell of sweet cherries. In mouth, Cantillon renowned sour taste is quite shy. It's cherry and cherry and cherry and sour comes in final. Very fruity and creamy. Cantillon c'est bon!"

"Excellent Oude Kriek"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"’08 vintage bottle thanks to Destructo.  Ruby red pour with a pinkish head.  Raspberry, vanilla, and oak aromas.  Tart cherry, sour raspberry, semi-acidic with  light funk, and oaky notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a classic lambic kriek. It pours a red beer. Smells of funky yeasts, and cherry candy. Taste is sour, yet it is also sweet. I could not help thinking of a cherry soda, since this beer has that type of feel. Not much foam forms at the head. This beer is pretty light, and I wouldn't say you can drink the whole bottle, but at least half easily."
""
""
""
""
""
"Arguably the ""worst"" (if that's possible) of the three Lou Pepes."

"Like in most cases with Cantillon, quite amazing. I've grown a soft spot for Krieks over the years and this proves that they too can blow me away. I am usually more fond of framboise so now is the time to crack a LPF to see how it compares to this Kriek. If you have any 2012 vintage (10' sticker) Lou Pepe Kreik, it's drinking amazing right now. Unless you prefer bracingly sour beer, it probably can't get better than this at this point. Or who knows with the endless possibilities of aged Cantillon :)."

"Overall: This is a fantastic kriek. The cherry comes through so nicely and is just the right amount of tart. This combined with the oakyness and funk is a wonderful combo. The balance is great, and this is an easy drinker with a lot of flavor."

"2011 edition thanks to drlovemd87, this is special beer, and while not as tart as i expected it to be at this age, it has a lot going for it, thats for sure, and probably worth at least some of the hype it gets. the color is incredible, electric dark pink, hazy, with an oddly white head for how tinted the brew is. its glowing, intimidating, exciting, and about as colorful a beer as i have ever seen. the head doesnt go anywhere either. the nose on this is wonderful too, fruity, cherries obviously, all the way. i get the tart pie cherry type, or maybe even tarter ground cherry, but its certainly not the tree cherries we get around here. the yeast is amazing, its opened right up here, super summery, and funky as they get. timeless in some way, not dusty, but rustic and classy, insofar as those can be aromas flavors. the cherries carry through the whole flavor, starting just a little sweet, but finishing with a nice tartness, not mouthwatering or particularly sour, and with very little acidity, but like a slightly under ripe cherry, hard and yet to develop its sugars completely. the yeast works magically with this cherry complexion, floral and familiar, but higher end than anything i can recall. the beer is frustratingly easy drinking, given that these are so rare, expensive, and downright special, but this is in many ways a beer for massive consumption. it would never turn the stomach, its not that sour, and its low abv keeps it easy drinking too. the carbonation is splendid, all kinds of fizz to this, but never abrasive. its nowhere near as sour on the whole as anticipated, but this is a cream of the crop as far as funky beers go, especially fruited ones. infinitely superior to the lou pepe gueuze i think, and just an overall sensational and memorable beverage. a touch beer to dissect really, because the unity of the whole thing is so much more than the sum of its parts. i believe they call that synergy, and this beer exemplifies it. wow."

"Bottle from Tipples. Awesome score here and had to leave work early to snag it. 2010 sticker poured into a tulip on February 15, 2014. Pours bright bright darkish red and totally clear. Bright pink fizzy one finger head on top and dissipates quickly. Aroma of lots of vinegar, tart cherries and cherry skins. Flavor is sour vinegar up front and then lots of cherry skins and tart but sweet cherries. The balance here is outstanding. Not medicinal at all, cherry is highlighted but not overpowering like the New Glarus cherry brew, and it comes together beautifully. A nice vanilla oak in the backdrop that really mellows this out. Juicy cherries but lightly dry finish. Medium light mouthfeel, full flavored, and big bubbly carbonation. While cherry isn’t my favorite in beer, this balances it as perfectly as possible. Very nice."
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable, to say the least."

"O. This is a beautiful kriek. Wonderful smell and taste. This maybe my favorite Cantillon (so far). I would certainly purchase this ale again. Certainly recommended."

"Overall: After finally having all three of the LP series Cantillions; Its close to a toss up which of the Lou Pepe series beer that I like better. I think the gueuze wins by a small margin."

"Nice deep red colour, with a cap of white head, good retention, little lace. Smell is funky, sweet cherry still very much upfront, light balsamic, acidic, overall very nice mix of sweet and sour cherry with a big funk present. Taste is sour and puckering up front, big acidity followed by sweet cherry that cuts the acidic flavours nicely, balsamic, lemon and puckering fruits toward finish, drying finish. Light-medium carbonation, medium bodied, nice crisp mouthfeel. Fantastic stuff, less sour than the Bio Kriek but more complex and well rounded, certainly a world beater."

"2008 vintage. I shall call him Lou le Pew. Tee-hee. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear burgundy-ruby topped by a finger of off-pink foam. The nose is a blast of sweet cherry wine (insert Tommy James reference, with or without Shondells), with a hint of light apple cider in the back for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the cherries come through with a bit of tartness, though with a clear restraint that keeps things from peeling the enamel from my teeth. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a very tasty cherry lambic, one that more than deserves the praise it receives."
""
"Appearance is a clear magenta with a short pink head. Nose is full of tart cherries. I get some jammy qualities and almost a bit of rhubarb. Notes vinegar on the nose with slight hints of oak. The taste is delicious. Plenty of puckering tartness up front with delicious cherry forward profile. Not a whole lot of other adjectives I can use than cherry, but that is okay because this is delicious. Mouthfeel is heavily carbonated and tasty. Overall, delicious."
"O: This is a very very nice beer. I can really appreciate the restraint shown on this one, as this beers balance makes it quite enjoyable."

"The beer pours a relatively clear, light colored reddish/rusty brown with almost no head. The nose is tart ...with a lot of funk, but no distinct cherry. The taste is definitely pungent with a whopping fruity tartness. The mouthfeel is highly acidic and dry with very little remaining cherry sweetness. This beer drinks like only a Cantillon would after 10 years...a serious champ."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and worth the money on."
""
"Overall: A really fantastic kriek. I think I enjoy this more than 3F Schaerbeekse Kriek."
"Overall on of my all time favs. This beer was great. I really hope to get my hands on another on and let it sit in the celler for a few year to see how it changes."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a delicious Kriek. Very tart with great cherry notes and some good chalky yeast notes as well. The oak also adds a nice earthy dimension. Very nice. (4.5)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The cherry complements the beer perfectly. Tastes real and in good balance with the base. Overall just really nice and highly drinkable. I could drink this all day."
""
""
"T: Huge wave of unripe cherry right off the bat with a big lactic twang. Some oak, raspberry and lemon peel. A champagne-like effervescent mouthfeel. Really fantastic stuff."
""
""
""
"O: fantastic beer, so glad someone shared this at a recent tasting! If I find myself with the opportunity to buy or trade for another, I certainly will."
""
""
""

"O-My third favorite of the regular Cantillons fruit lambics behind Fou Foune and Saint Lamnivus. Great color, nose, and taste on this, I could drink this by the gallon (and subsequently did when it was on tap at Zwanze Day 2011)."
""
""
"O: Another amazing beer from Cantillon, not much more needs to be said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"750mL 2007. Pours perfectly with a creamy pink, thin head that lasts throughout. Nose is just so awesome. Soft, tart, cherries, cherry pie, raspberry yogurt. Taste is similar: a play off raspberries and sour cherries with such a soft, beautiful body it really is not even fair. This is definitely the perfect kriek. I want some everyday. 9/5/9/5/18=4.6"
""
""
"O- Great Kriek. I'm pretty new to the lambic style but this is by far the best I've had. Well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Krieks are near the top of my favorite styles of beer. And while I've been lucky to enjoy many stellar offerings, Cantillon's Lou Pepe has surpassed them all. World Class!"
"This poured out looking like a carbonated fruit punch, the color was very bright red. It looks beautiful! The head is a bit on the fizzy side and has a very nice looking pink color. There isn't any retention or lacing on this beer. The smell is of tart cherries and some minor sweet malts in there too. The taste is actually a lot more subtle than I expected. It is definitely tart but it seems to be nicely balanced as well between the tart vs the sweetness. The mouthfeel is sharp and crisp, it feels clean and doesn't coat your mouth with any syrupy cherry flavors. Overall I enjoyed this actually. I am not a big fan of these kind of beers but I did appreciate having this one."
""
""
""
"A dark red color with a creamy pink head that rose and fell quickly. Some stray pink bubbles cling to the sides of the glass. Large amounts of tart/sour cherries greet you as you lean in for a whiff. Some clean hay and acidic notes along with an underlying aroma of oak. On the palate, loads of fruit. Cherries and raspberries lead the charge onto the palate with some acidic notes quickly in tow. A sugary sweetness lingers with a moderate acidic tartness. The finish is primarily sour with a touch of hay funk. A smooth, even mouthfeel with low carbonation. Really on point here. Just lush and smooth as it rolls around in the mouth. This is an excellent kriek. Great fruit flavor with a solid punch of sour. Delicious."

""
""

""

"O- A great, well balanced lambic. I love this beer, I wish I could drink this all day. Makes me sad that Cantillon is so hard to get."
""
""
""
"O: A"
""
"O - Overall this beer is just as good as everyone says. Love having it on draft, works wonderfully with the raspberry and espresso tarimisu."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall rather nice sour, but be prepared for this one is rather sour. the fruitiness is a nice touch. overall very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a really good kriek. Cantillon is always very good."
"2007 Vintage. Pours a dark red color with a medium, light pink head that disappeared quickly. Scent was quite acidic at first with sour cherries and other red berries. Tons of oak aromas with a subdued funky aroma (not one of the funkiest Cantillons I've had). Some spiciness with barnyard hay and some more berry...raspberry. Taste is very tart cherry at first, but casually transform to sweet and juicy. Slightly acidic with some lovely oak barrel flavors. Not the most sour Cantillon I've had, but very complex. Makes me wonder what this tasted like fresh. Probably like Cantillon Kriek. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer was fantastic. Not the best Cantillon I've had, but they're all so good and all so different (even when it's the same beer, just a different batch)...this one was great though!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I remember having my first Cantillon Kriek last year and wondering if lambics just weren't for me. Having developed my palate since then, I'm sure I would appreciate it for what it is next time. Stepping up and over to the Lou Pepe though, was not regretted."
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't drink sours too often, I've always been more of a stout and DIPA person but I definitely enjoyed this beer. I started off the night with this beer and craved the taste of it so much that I had to order it again before I left (also considering I knew this beer is fairly rare). At $13/10oz serving this is saying something- I very rarely order $13 drinks, never mind twice in a night. I thought the beer was great in almost every way and I wish I could order it more often. I can definitely see why this is considered one of the best krieks/sours in the world."
""
""
""
""
""
"This being fairly fresh, the acidic bite I got from a recent 2004 vintage is absent. This focuses more on the bright red cherry and fruits, along with the funk. Torn between which I like more, though I can safely say this ages extremely well."
""
"A very awesome brew that we were very lucky to find. The bottle didn't last for too long, but I'll be thinking about this one for a while."
""
""
"A real treat, sharing a bottle of Lou Pepe Kriek with friends on a Tuesday afternoon. 4.5"
""
"O: Wow, this is fantastic stuff. I'd drink the hell out of this if I could find it on a regular basis. Definitely a whale worthy of it's fame. Definitely my favorite sour yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"4, 4, 4, 5, 4"
"O: This one is amazing. Maybe I need to venture out and try more lambics - I haven't tried too many varieties, but this one is by far the best out of the ones I have tried. Perfect on a sunny day like today!"
"Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek pours an almost intimidatingly vibrant ruby red. The two fingers of dark pink foam that crown the beer briefly, before disappearing without a trace, is similarly impressive in terms of vibrancy. The nose has a solid ripe cherry presence, before fading into aromas familiar to anyone who's had a great lambic. There's a little bit of wood (barrels? cherry pit? both?) that plays well with some of the more earthy brett aromatics. Meanwhile there's also some wet hay. The cherry aspect of the flavor profile has just a hint of sour/tartness to it, but otherwise it forms a nice opening before letting all those woody, earthy, and barnyard notes to fill out the beer. The body is light and crisp, with a positively champagne-like carbonation. Superb mouthfeel. This is my first time drinking one of Cantillon's Lou Pepe beers, and I'm not sure how much better this is than their regular kriek, but it's definitely a fantastic beer."
"Overall, excellent. A really well crafted lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. I'm really enjoying this one. Fantastic tasting cherries and just enough of the classic lambic characteristics. Like the LP Framboise, I'd drink this all the time if I could find it and afford it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is an ode to sour cherries. Puckering and sour upfront. Slightly sweet lingering cherry flavors at the finish. Not as dry as most Cantillons. Intense tartness, intense cherry flavors but somehow incredible drinkable. Not the most complex fruit Lambic on the planet but very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is good, I found the level of carbonation to be very good. Overall, this is an excellent fruit lambic and another Cantillon home run."
""
"This was served with a melt in your mouth lamb lollipop (thankfully without nuts, thanks Monks!) the cherry gastrique was simply perfect to pair with such a sweet kriek, and the lamb was delicious. 5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid tart cherry flavor but I have to admit, I am a tad underwhelmed with this. I was expecting loads of fruit but was left wanting more. Still a solid beer, just a little hyped."
""
"O: A truly fantastic kriek."
"Mouthfeel is light, but not watery due to the acidity that forms this beer's backbone and the mild carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a really nice kreik. Very drinkable and flavorful. Not medicinal like some can be. I dig this one."
""
""
""
"Poured bright red, a little cloudy, with some pink-white bubbles on top. It's a kriek, so, aroma of cherries, as would be imagined; hints of acid. Nice tart cherry taste, balanced with maraschino sweetness, mild acidity, but not at all acetic, so the fruit is dominant on the palate. Medium body, tingly carbonation, no alcohol detected at all. Very nice drinker overall, but nothing to go ape over."
"4.0 D: What a completely different experience than what I had with the regular Kriek! This one is not only palatable, but also mighty tasty. I'm not too crazy about the price of this though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Regardless, I really love Cantillon. Bring me more!"
"Overall: Damn fine beer. Glad I finally got to try this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have heard this beer described as one of the most intense fruit beers on earth and I wholeheartedly agree! Stunning mixture of sweet-tart cherries and funk. I will certainly be having this again in the future!"
"Drink- Chris brought his A game on Saturday and I can't thank him enough for this treat. It was very well balanced, fruity and tasted great. I am very glad I have a bottle at home to now sit on and savor for a bit."
"Pours a murky cranberry red with an off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of lots of sour and funky cherry aromas along with some woody aromas. Taste is the same and has a great but very sour flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great lambic with fantastic aromas and flavors. I am very happy I was finally able to try this one."
"O: High drinkability. Beautiful beer. The best Cantillon I've ever had"
""
"O: LP Kriek lives up to the pedestal I put it on. This beer tastes very mature, the brewer let the beer come into it's own without trying too hard. Simple and complex at the same time, sour enough to appease sour fans, yet down to earth enough for most newcomers."
""
"O: The viscosity was much thinner than I had expected, and this has more vinegar and funk than fruit taste as compared to some of the non-aged Cantillon lambics. I found this to be extremely drinkable once my palate settled down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another great beer from Cantillon. Really wish there beers were easier to get."
"Lou Pepe Kriek is a damn near perfect example of the style, exhibiting a masterful balance and blend of tart, sweet flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to review this one as I really found no flaw with it...in my eyes the perfect Kriek. Pours a hazy grapefruit pink body with an inch of pink coral head. Smell is brilliant. Fresh tart cherries, oak, slight tannic dryness, a touch of musty funk. Tastes flawless too. Starts off with a kick of fresh cherries, very tart but balanced acidity, lots of oak notes and a little barnyard wildness on the finish. Also picked up some floral, almost perfume-like, notes on the finish. Mouthfeel was less thin than the standard Kriek and perfectly carbonated even with the age. Overall, I can't see a Kriek exceeding this one. Not sure if the age made the difference here but it sure didn't hurt. Seek this one out and buy it if a recent vintage is on the shelf."
""
"This is a great kriek with a lot of depth. I split this bottle with Goblinmunkey7 at the Ale House in Amesbury, MA. We paid $30. Was the bottle worth $30? No... but close considering the bar markup. I would love to have this again if Cantillon weren't so expensive and impossible to find."
"2008 vintage served in a traditional-like belgian tumbler. Deep red nearing a purple shade. A tight dense head of light lavender-esque pink appears and disappears just as fast. A juicy nose, filled with tart cherry, wild funk, damp basement, faint graham cracker crust. This beer opens with a lactic tart cherry hit, lots and lots of cherry/berry flavors, some pie crust in the taste and brett charecter and oak. On the finish this beer is like a perfect sour cherry. Not thin, clean, crisp, dry. This is one of my top cantillons to date, tons of flavor, well crafted, balance....but could have had a bit more sour."
"2009 Bottle: Pours a beautiful Bright red with a nice red tinted head that was big and frothy but left the scene quickly. Smelled like cherry candy wiht some sour adn slight wood. Tastes quite similar with a boom of sour to begin with a great balance of cherry candy sweetness, a tiny bit of woody dryness at the end. Overall a Beautiful beer that I absolutely loved"

"O- Another slam dunk from Cantillon, the fruit and oak is more pronounced on the Lou Pepe than on the normal Kriek, although both are absolutely delightful beers. I look forward to finding another bottle."

"Pours a nice Cherry,dark grape hue which leaves a fast vanishing two finger head and no lacing,the smell is sweet cherries,a touch of funk and the mustiness of an old house not lived in for a while,the mouthfeel is light bodied and bone dry and has tastes of Cherries and lots of them mixed with cranberry juice,a touch of bitter lemon and finished with a funky sour dryness and overall very nice and not many can top Cantillion at what they do but not one for someone who doesnt like Cherries or sour Lambics but me id drink again cheers."

"O: A great lambic. Very glad to get to try another great Cantillon. I wish their beer was still distributed to MI."
""
""

"I grabbed another pair of these for long term aging and I'm curious to what will happen. Pretty easy too break the bank on this stuff but I just had too try it"

"O: A delicious beer that could be paired with many light and fruity dishes."
""
""
""

"Update: I had a couple pours of an '06 LPK in Summer 2013, so 7 years later. The beers was amazing - the fruit was still exploding, the lambic more funky and acidic than fresh. Age this one!"

"D - Can't wait to see what age does to this one. I'm feeling blessed to have sampled this one with an identical vintage sitting in the reserves."
"O: Another classic delicious beer from Cantillon. Not as good for my palate as compared to the regular Cantillon Kriek (much more acid, good interplay of flavours - acid and fruit) this is wonderful as well. Fans of the fruit will adore this."
"Split a bottle with a friend. Ah, this is the way fruit beers should be. The cherries complement the base beer without overpowering or oversweetening. There's still that biting citric sour character, but with a gentle layer of the fruit blending in with the funk. That said, this wasn't a life-changing lambic worth the extra cost of a Lou Pepe, but a fine example of the kriek style."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Sharp and sour with a very enjoyable earthy cherry flavor that doesn't retain any residual sweetness. There is seemingly no alcohol impact on this brew. It carries with it a pretty big salivation factor. I couldn't get enough of this. Surprisingly for being the same vintage as what I had on tap recently, the experience from on tap verse the bottle is drastically different. This bottle was more sour like the normal Cantillon offering while on tap it was much more fruited and sweet tasting. Certainly worth a try by either means."
"O - The best Kriek that I have ever tried, and I'm still to have an average beer from Cantillon."
"Pours a bright deep red with a light pink head. Looks like a Raspberry soda if there were such a thing. The nose is lightly vinegar with big cherries and a touch of funk. The taste is big cherry and a mild amount of sourness or funk. Not particularly sweet, which is nice. It actually drinks quite easily and is almost surprisingly quaffable. Good carbonation, not too excessive like some sours seem to get. Overall, I think I was expecting more, but quite enjoyed what was delivered."
"Overall: This is a good lambic but it didn't wow me like I expected it to. That being said, I'm sure I'll have it again if I get the chance."
"2007 vintage bottle thanks to ksurkin for the sample. Pours a deep red body with a light red on the outside of the glass. It smells like sour cherries all the way. You can tell it is going to be a puckering beer as soon as you smell it. The taste follows the nose as expected and is balanced by just a touch of sweetness to keep this from being an all out assault on your palate. I wish I could have this beer everyday whenever I wanted. My oh my what a wonderful beer."
"O: I would drink this again."
"O: Most complex and best Kriek I've had, great cinnamon spice and almond, i still prefer non-fruit wilds but this is good."
"O: Tasted quite fresh and I really enjoyed this beer. I will definitely seek it out again going forward!"
"Blissfully good beer."
"Overall: This is my second time having this vintage, and although I really appreciate the quality of the beer, the lack of intense funkiness or puckering sour keeps me from loving it. I was definitely in the minority of people who did not enjoy this as the favorite of the day."
"Overall – What can I say. This was a fantastic beer and I was able to purchase one too. I will probably never consume as much of this ever again as I did yesterday. Delicious."
"Having 2008 both draft and bottle, i prefer the bottle. Bottle had less oak and more cherry"
"Cheers!"
"Overall a great beer especially for the harmonious and balanced taste and mouthfeel. Would have a slight preference for the Framboise over this but it's always a delight to sip and contemplate a Cantillon."
"Overall: An amazing Cantillon...as usual. The nose, taste and mouthfeel are amazing. Great stuff from Cantillon as usual."
"Overall, a really nice and complex kriek. The cherries balance the line between sweet and sour really well. This really is completely different from the regular Kriek, but is also amazing. Definitely something I would not hesitate to get again and somethnig I would love to try with more age on it."
"D - The tartness could wear you out, but a very nice beer at a low ABV!"
"Got this beer on Thursday at monks after the outstanding Monday event they held. Poured a beautiful red hue with a minimal amount of head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice little ring around the glass. The aroma is huge tart dark dried cherry. There is a mild funk, but I didn't detect it here nearly as much as some of the other cantillon they had there. The flavor is eerily like cherry pie. Cooked cherries with a tartness and a little too much sweetness, but only a little bit. Mouthfeel is nice and light with lively carbonation. I really enjoy this beer. Outstanding beer by cantillon."
"Another amazing beer by Cantillon. Not the best Kriek I've had, but really delicious. Interested in seeing how my '07 bottle compares when I open it in a few weeks."
"Poured into a De Koninck glass. The definite smell of cherries after taking off the cork. The appearance is a light ruby red with little head and bubbles. The smell of cherries and oak is present in the glass. The taste of cherries with a little sour backend. Good mouthfeel, not overwhelming. Overall, a good lambic that's not strong but very drinkable."
"I find lambics to be very different from what I drink on a daily basis. This was really good, none of the flavours are wrong or over the top."
"Time has treated this beer exceptionally well - I would love to try an older bottle. A phenomenal beer, world-class."
"Overall -- I struggle to think of a kriek that stands up to this one, even amongst the Scharbeekse cherry krieks. Great depth of flavor, and nicely tuned sourness. World-class for certain."
"O - Awesome, awesome beer. This is why Cantillon is the best at what they do. Exceptionally balanced beer and one that I am going to seek out every chance I get."
"Overall this is a phenomenal beer and one that I’d like to have regular access to. Well worth a shot if you see it around."
"Finishes so very dry, makes you want to take such small sips, and sip again a few seconds later, and i accept."
"2008 on Tap at the Brick Store Pub’s Sour Christmas in July. Pours a dull deep cloudy as hell red with tones of deep brown too. Compared during tasting to a bottle of Heinz ketchup that was sitting on our table. Smells of sour cherry tartness with notes of sweetness peaking through. First sip is mouthwater puckering that hits both the front and back of the mouth. Cherries and wood dominate. Lightly bodied."
"It's an opaque, ruby red with a shocking amount of carbonation considering the complete lack of head. Cherry funk, barnhouse flowers, and a raw, boozy citrus that seems to magically dissipate the longer it stays in your mouth. There's no really great way to describe this beer; it's pretty much sublime, so go out and grab one when you can."
"Drie Fonteinen's Schaerbeekse Kriek is still fresh in my mind. I actually wish I had held on to it so we could do a little Schaerbeek lambic tasting. But to compare out of memory, I'll always favor 3F's crazy funky aromas, but I think the Cantillon tastes better. This really is one of the better krieks out there, but I'm not certain that it lives up to the hype."
"8.2/10"
"If it wasn't for this tight carbonation I probably would have rated this much higher and may very well have been the best lambic I ever had. This an exceptional fruit lambic period, just fantastic."
"The palate opens with a brilliant blend of bright cherries, a little leather and a dense, complex parquet of cherries and lambic. I can't really describe it better than saying that that's what I want a kriek to taste like - intensely sour but never wearing on the palate, incredibly fruity but never ""girly", pleasantly oraky and moderately tannic with an illustrative blend of oak tannins and skin tannins. Soft, frothy and fluffy on the palate with a mildly fruity and pulpy character, this beer is a masterpiece on the palate. I drank about 25oz, and could have gone for another 25 if I didn't have to go home. A stellar kriek, I'm being stingy here only because I think the 07 was the best possible kriek there is, and this isn't quite there yet."
"this beer pours ruby red with a thin effervescent head. the smell is sour a good funky presence and cherries. the flavor is cherries up front followed by the funk and finished with a big sourness. the mouthfeel is thin and almost puckering. overall the best kriek i have ever had"
"O - Overall this beer is very good. I have had it multiple times out of the bottle and it has always impressed me. I would have liked a bit more out of the taste department but these things can be a bit hit or miss. Glad I have a few bottles of this stuff in the cellar."
"Couple of thoughts.... obviously, this is a beer for sour lovers, but really, I think a bit more fruit would benefit this beer, giving it more of a sweet tart flavor as opposed to just flat out sour funk... but that's just me. Sour beers are just not my forte. Still an impressive effort and a very interesting beer to sample."
"D - Cantillon delivers once again. Well integrated yet retains a bright red fruit flavour. Definately less tart than their other beers I've had and has aged gracefully."
"One of the better Cantillons I've had, fruity and funky with a drinkable yet complex sourness."
"This vintage is super-duper funky. Like, nasty old cheese inside a pair of sweaty socks in a gym locker in the sun funky. This is a great vintage if you’re into nasty cheese, which you are."
"O - One of the best sours I've had the privilege of having. Had this directly following the standard Cantillon Gueuze and it stood well above. Something about this kriek gave it a very unique aspect that I haven't seen in other fruit lambics. I hope I can get a hold of another one these..."
"The signature Cantillon flora flavors come through with a blast of cherry atop it. Tolerable sour and funk, smooth."
"Definitely the most drinkable Cantillon I've had so far, smooth, tasty and goes down too easy, but truthfully nothing blew me away about this. I was hoping for a bit more considering the price."
"O: Excellent beer, favorite kriek that I have had to date. Nice and sour with strong taste of tart cherries. Really drinkable and delicious."
"drinkability: a wow beer, best sour I have had."
"O: Overall this is a hell of a beer. It's not as sour as I expected given how sour the regular Kriek is, but there's still some sourness there. However it's got one of the most intense real fruit flavors I've ever had in a beer, and that flavor mixes fantastically with the oak, funk and sourness."
"O: This is without question the best kriek I have had. Balanced and so delicious."
"O: Although the beer is very sour, it’s not too difficult to drink because the sourness is not overpowering."
"OF course it's delicious! On tap at Rattle N Hum.. The first beer I tried on the day and damn, was it lovely. Red with a lovely little pink head. Big sour cherry aroma with a small funk note. Very balanced sour, the cherry almost completely fermented out, leaving only the aroma and a sex appeal that only Jesus on the day of the rapture could say no to. Medium-bodied, damn delicious, and sweet Jesus those cherries are nice."
"Overall its damn good, not perfect. Its almost Iris good IMO"
"Another wonderful beer by Cantillon. $30 per 750ml is very steep, is it worth it? Well no single beer is really worth $30, but whatever, I'd buy it again if I saw it :)"
"750ml bottle, 2007 vintage. Pours a dark deep red with a thin pink head. Aromas of sour cherries, oak and funk. Flavor is exactly the way it smells. Tons of sour, tart cherries with hints of oak and acid. Medium bodied, with good carbonation and excellent balance of flavor. This one is definitely more tart/sour then your typical Cantillon."
"O - Cantillon LP on-tap? You gotta be kidding me. I should stay in my seat until I drain this keg."
"The 2008 was much less funky with a brighter acidity and a black cherry sparkle in the finish. It still has the complex interplay between barnyard and tart, but the balance is a bit more level and both are a little more refined letting the fruit shine through better."
"Tiny bit of wet oak. More viscosity thickness than expected."
"o - tops. totally tops. i want more!! i guess trading is my best bet at this point.."
"O: I wish I had bought some bottles of this when I had the chance. It’s excellent, and unfortunately think it’s sold out in the area. I would gladly have it again."
"Bottle, generously shared by Sammy. Sampled with many others. Slightly hazed cherry red with a foamy pink head. Very enticing aroma of sour cherry, funk, wood, yeast. Mouth watering. Extremely tart with sour cherry and strawberry, highly acidic, with yeasty funk and woody notes. Palate cleansing, refreshing, medium body with mouth puckering finish. Excellent tart cherry aftertaste. Great beer, thanks Sam!2003 Vintage."
"As I recall from my review of the 2007, age does begin to bring out some more earthiness where there was only fruity sweetness early on. This beer will hold up for years longer. A side by side of old and young would be very interesting."
"D: Supremely drinkable."
"O: At this point, this vintage is a bit past its prime in terms of fruitiness. However, it's still an incredible representation of it's style. Very well balanced in terms of smell and flavor and with a near perfect mouthfeel. 2 or 3 years ago, this may have been a perfect 5. Currently, its simply very good."
"Pours a purplish/maroon color with light pink head. slight hint of fruit in the nose, but mostly a nice funky aroma. taste is tart and sour, but mellower and not as biting as many lambics/guezes are. almost refreshing like a nice juice as well. mouthfeel is light. overall, very nice offering, better than the 100% kriek. I like how balanced this one seems. It's sour, but lets the fruit flavor shine and goes down much smoother."
"O: Just an awesome fruit Lambic. I've also had the 2008 in the past, and they're fantastic. Get your hands on some if you can."
"Light bodied, highly carbonated with soft bubbles to really release aromas in your mouth without tiring out your tongue. Had two glasses of this one since it was so good."
"5/4.5/5/4.5/5"
"A little thicker than I imagined, but this is a beer that I need to grab whenever I see it on the shelf. Thanks again, Brad!"
"Vibrant black cherry red with a short-lived pink head. The nose is all cherry pie filling, sweet and sour, incredibly multi-dimensional and complex. Sour, sweet and earthy with flesh and skin and pit. Tastes ridiculously good, cherries at the forefront exhibiting ripe juicy sweetness, tannic skin and earthy pit. Moderate lactic sourness backs the fruit, it's not full-on sour by any stretch, more of a balanced presence. Funk is mild, buried beneath the fruit. This is just an astoundingly good beer on tap, a true session lambic."
"This spectacular. The fruit is huge and delicious. The sourness is nice. I like this beer quite a bit-- I just wish it were more sour..."
"Overall this is a very fine lambic and definitely belongs in the discussion of the best in the world."
"D: This is extremely refreshing and drinkable for such a strong flavored beer. Would be a great summer drink on the shore. Too bad this stuff is so damn expensive!"
"For those who adore acidic ales this stuff will make their toes curl, however for the kriek fan there's not much being offered from the fruit. I'm rather on the fence with this one, I can appreciate it for what it is (and how rare it is to get), however am quite content after half a glass and not craving any more of it."
"Thanks to jedwards for sharing. 2008 vintage bottled in 2010. Pours a gorgeous raspberry color with a semi-hazy clarity and a mere skim of a head. Nose expresses tart cherries up front, followed by a sweet quality and some sourness, perhaps grapefruit seeds. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of a cinnamon character reminiscent of atomic fireballs, as well as vinegary cherries and a saltiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation that falls just short of being still. Acidity and astringency stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks. This beer is everything a kriek should be - flavorful, tart and refreshing."
"a phenomenal beer every time. fresh, aged, whatever. reviewing the 2008 (bottled 2010) version. pours a glowing red with a lively pink head that shrinks to a collar pretty quickly. collar stays around the whole time. very pretty. nose reveals many layers of different fruit (strawberry, cherry, citrus), earth, must, funk, cobweb, vanilla, oak, and what is coming off to me like almond paste (like the semi-sweet chalky/pasty stuff in the little metal tube they use for those delicious Moroccan cookies). wow. there are wine barrel hints in there in the back end for sure as well that brings almost like a bloody minerality. taste is divine. the brightness of the cherry and tartness hit first, but before sour can take over, edges are rounded out by vanilla, wood and nuttiness, while grapefruit pith notes come in adding a touch of bitterness that helps lift everything back off the palate. once again, something very reminiscent of wine comes through in the back end of the taste, and if it isn't wine barrel aged, i'd be surprised. creamy, medium-full body that tingles just a bit from moderately prickly carbonation drinkability? i could drink this all night, and everything about it makes it feel like a special occasion. epic good. cantillon does it again."
"So bright and fresh, this is just as good as (if not better) than 3F's own. The standard for the style. I look forward to seeing how this develops."
"Big thanks to nick3 for hosting the Bruery RS Post-Post-Party and for sharing this bottle with the group. 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Bruery sampler imperial pint. Poured blood red with a one finger slight pink head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight sour, funk, and raspberries. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, and raspberries. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. Very mellow in the flavors. Had a good aroma and flavor going on here. I might would like it a little older if I'm honest, but then again, different strokes for different folks..."
"I opened this bottle with high expectations, and got exactly what I was looking for. Easily worth the $22~ I paid for this."
"A fantastic kriek! Very complex, wonderfully refreshing, and incredibly easy to drink. I wish I could perpetually keep bottles of this on hand. The epitome of the style."
"A really solid beer with lots of flavour but true balance. Another well crafted beer from Cantillon."
"Tasted from bottle purchased at Discount Liquors, Vintage 2005. Pours a cloudy but bright brick red color with an average rose head that recedes to lace. Nose is sour and funky with just a hint of vinegar and lactic acid, some vanilla oak, and a very fresh cherry aroma that also has a hint of sweetness. Most Krieks I have tried smell more like a Kirsch brandy, where the cherries here smell much more fresh. The flavor starts off very sour and acidic, but quickly and seamlessly moves to the oak vanilla and very fresh cherries that throughout seem to give an illusion of sweetness, but I don't think that there is anything sweet to this beer at all. The body is medium with almost sparkling carbonation and a long sour and fresh cherry finish."
"D-this is another great cantillon beer that has a very concise funk that is centered and balanced. the fruits are so fresh a delicious and the sourness is assertive but not biting."
"The taste mimics the smell. Light raspberry and cherry fruit with a solid, but not overwhelming sourness. The sourness builds appropriately, but never dominates the palate, making this a candidate for pairing with lighter fare like summer salads or fruit-based desert. Insanely drinkable and a classic stepping stone for those looking to get into sours."
"I want to add another rate, early 2011 from a 2007 bottle. Consumed right after a 2010 Cantillon Kriek. Poured a darker shade than the Kriek, quite opaque and deep, like a rich mahogany, with a fluffy, pink cotton candy head. Much more dry than the regular Kriek, rife with a deep cherry pit and funk that were tied together seamlessly. As with most Cantillons it was really tight, dry, and sour. I was thinking ""black cherries"" the whole time where I didn't really think that from the regular Kriek. I've had several vintages of this, and at different ages, and it's always sublime. One of their best beers consistently I think."
"Well, the verdict is that this is great beer and a treat if your into the style. Easily drinkable. I just wish the sour I get from Cantillon bottles would translate more to the tap versions, although this is a sour sucka, and im a sucka for sours."
"Very drinkable, should've had a few more..."
"Lighter bubbly body, dances on the tongue, some dry feel towards the end - very tasty and easy to drink, and the alcohol is masked well. This isn't really a favorite style of mine and I was still really into it - super high quality beer here."
"The beer pours a dark purple color with a thick frothy pink head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding. It's crisp and damn sour with a really nice cherry edge. It's also dry with some funk and earthiness. The taste is awesome. Wow, what a mouthpuckering sourness! It goes down smooth with a nice cherry character and dry, earthy finish. What a smooth beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fantastic beer. It's incredibly complex and damn drinkable. Thanks Arpit."
"B: 50, 5, 13, 18, 8 = 94"
"Tasty? Delicious actually. Drinkable? Yes, but only if you are into this type of beer. I could certainly see someone being overwhelmed by the tartness of this one."
"D: What an excellent beer. A depth that is not always there in a sour, I really enjoyed this."
"It's a light body with a medium feel because of some solid carbonation. I want to drink this instead of finishing leftover Halloween candy and just enjoy the complex concoction. Too bad I couldn't score a growler. Win again for Cantillon and Blind Tiger aging awesome beers."
"It is in your face with the first sip. This is an explosive, sour kriek."
"Beautiful bright red body with a pink foamy head. Huge cherry aroma, slightly funky, acidic and musty. Completely blown away the smell of this beer. Flavor is of tart cherries, oak, leather, and earthy funk. Well carbonated, astringent finish, and very drinkable. Truly enjoyed this beer."
"d - I thought this was a great funky lambic. I loved the smell and thought it was really easy to drink. Looking forward to having again."
"Definitely one of the more balanced lambics from Cantillon - the tartness is present, but not sourpuss inducing, thus it goes down slowly, but steadily. That said, it's still a good beer to have with food, to soften the edge. For me it made an interesting accompaniment to raspberry rhubarb crumble."
"D. Quite interesting and complex once you adjust to the tartness. This is the best Cantillon I've had so far. I've still got a Classic Gueuze and an Iris waiting for me in the cellar."
"Very high quality fruit, a distinctive varietal seems to be used here (some say Schaerbeekse, but I haven't sampled 3F's namesake yet to compare) - yields a sweeter smoother base (though still 100% natural tasting) than some other krieks, which serves as a nice foil to the artful complexity of the aged lambic. If not the apex of the style, it is certainly among the very best and exudes quality, care, and tradition."
"Drinkabilit-: too funky and sour to drink much of"
"D- i could probably have taken this bottle down by myself, but something this expensive and old begged to be shared with my wife who also really enjoyed it. id love to have a large stash of these."
"D- Not too high, considering it's limited availability. Still, I will buy this every chance I get!"
"MF/D: surprisingly smooth on the palate for the high carbonation that is everpresent, certainly some tart left on the lips."
"Quite high carbonation with a clean and very dry finish - positively sucks the moisture from your mouth. You need another sip. NOW! And another. And so on. Wonderful beer."
"D: Very nice and very drinkable. Not as sour/sweet as other lambics I've had. Have to drink it quite slowly but that's the best part - more time to enjoy it."
"The cork was seeping a little bit but there were no real issues in opening it up. The beer pours hazy and translucent, with deep ruby colors about 1/3 inch of off-pink foam. The aroma is so funky and acidic, with tart cherries and musty basement/barnyard aromatics. It tastes about as highly sour as my senses can register, there could not be a more sour initial taste. Puckering and enamel-etching, and delicious throughout, at least based on my current tastes. The sour flavors don't last in the after-taste, there's more a mix of cherry sweetness and some kind of saltiness. Excellent. The beer is well carbonated, even after 5 years in the bottle, nice body and presence. I'm rating the drinkability high as I love this style of beer, but I could see many people struggling through 1 glass, if you're not familiar with sour ales."
"D- Huge drinkability, could drink this all day and have no problem. Really a great beer..."
"D - Not too sour, not too tart, just the perfect blend, Lou Pepe Kriek is an awesome brew with great drinkability!"
"Overall one of the finest beers I've had the chance to try. If not for the price tag I would seriously drink this non stop. Thanks so much for sharing this with me sweem."
"(D)- A fantasticly beautiful lambic. Tart and sour with a great fruit profile. Has a great acidity to it that combines well with everything else. The pinnacle of the style in all areas. I could easily have a whole bottle to myself no problem."
" M- The light mouthfeel has a nice tartness to it but no real lockjaw astringency. Tight carbonation dries out finish nicely. D- This is all about the fruit bit it has great support from the lambic adding nice depth that grows with each sip. Delicious."
"Bottle via trade with Boutip, thanks! 2006 vintage. Pours a beautiful pinkish-red with a bit of pink foam. Aroma is very funky of course, but filled with cherries, yeast and wheaty notes as well. Taste is mainly very tart cherries with some sweetness to blanced it out. Palate is refreshing with a very dry finish, as per style. A good one but still a little too sour for me."
"As close to a brut fruit beer/champagne as you can get. Poured with a pretty, cherry pink, fine foamy head that lasts and no lace. Color is an intense, clear, ruby red. Aroma is a tart, pie cherry, slightly earthy. Flavor is like nose, very crisp and pure. Body is full and has huge champagne carbonation. Finish is super clean and bright..Be a great summertime appertif."
"D - I could be happy drinking little else for the rest of my days"
"D - Got so sour my mouth almost started puckering. Became a bit of a sipper there after a short while."
"The beer is upper light bodied with a high level of carbonation and a dry, sticky mouthfeel. This is just a fantastic beer, and probably the best Kriek I've ever had. Bravo Cantillon."
"D: this beer was very drinkable a bit acidic but had great flavors that lingered on the palate for awhile. Very potent taste and another great beer from the cantillon brewery."
"Update: Cracked a 2007 vintage on 10/22 and the flavor and tartness of the cherry dominate as the funkiness is much more pronounced. Still a good beer but much better with age."
"D: I had one glass, and probably could of had a second, but this was a small sip beer for sure."
"Overall an exceptional beer that I'll be drinking many times in the future and a great example of a kriek."
"Flavor is wonderful. Not as sweet as some Krieks, especially Lindemans...but very good. Big tartness right off the bat, followed by a carbonated oaky, tart, and currant flavor. This is another beer to be drank at cellar temp. Fridge temps won't do this beer justice as the flavors become blanded as your palate is shocked by the chill. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, carbonated, and finishes dry. Overall a very pleasant kriek style lambic from Cantillon!"
"I've had this again and my reviews were way way too low for this beer. This is probably one of the best sours out there, hands down."
"Although there are a number of ways I could have spent the money on other beers, there's no denying that Lou Pepe Kriek is great. An excellent example of a fruit lambic."
"D: The cherries stand out wonderfully and help to balance out the base lambic, it would seem. Pleasantly sour without being overly so. Well worth the exorbitant cost."
"Medium body with lots of tart sour funk and the perfect amount of acidity. Again as in the aroma, the flavor is bursting with luscious tart dark cherries. I can't understand how the frut has held up so well but although this beer is funky as hell the cherries still dominate. We also sampled an 05 Lou Pepe Framboise and it was nowhere near as complex. The fruit was almost completely faded and it was insanely funky. This beer has hints of earthy oak and plenty of sour barnyard funk that balance out the cherries and sugar added but again the cherries are prominent. This beer has developed very well into a delicious, complex lambic and the mouth puckering finish left me salivating for more. Highly recommended!"
"On a night with many great beers on the table, this was without a doubt the highlight of the evening for me. This is one of my all-time favorite beers."
"Hard to drink in any quanity, the first three or four ounces were great, then my tongue and palate were completely bruised and battered shortly thereafter. Not my favorite cantillon by any stretch of the imagination, wouldn't buy it again at the price it is, but as always, a solid offering."
"Overall I dumped half a bottle ($15 worth) of beer down the drain and me and my buddy choked down the other half. Very dissapointed I paid $30 plus shipping (not sold in So Cal any more for some reason) just for it to suck. Hopefully my St. Lamvinus is better."
"Notes: 2007 Kriek bottled 2009. Good sour beer from a brewery that knows a thing or two about sours. It was a little more acidic/tart and less fruit than I thought it may be, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Really opened up after drinking it for a while, and the fruit started coming out a bit more. Enjoyable beer to sip, definitely recommend trying this."
"2006 Vintage 750 mL bottle. Color is amazing. burgundy-ish red, with crimson and ruby highlights. Whoa. This is incredible. Barnyard funk, wet grass, and sweet cherries hit the nose. Incredible tartness works the side of the tongue, but the sweetness of the cherries and malt balances this and makes it into something divine. Lots of lemon and citrus zest and some grapefruit. Man, smooth, delicious. In typical Cantillon fashion, complex and very hard to describe. I'll buy one of these whenever I see one."
"Resounding pop upon pulling the cork. Plumskin red with a short-lived carnation pink fizzy head. Somewhat hazy. The nose is of tart cherries, of course, along with an almost medicinally citric sourness. The acidity is pungent, and the aromatic experience is not dissimilar from smelling mentholatum. Much less sour than I expected, but there is a wonderfully full tart cherry flavor. Every bit of the fruit's flavor ended up in the beer, which is a triumph in my book. Some leathery and bitter orange flavors emerge around the edges. Crisp but unobtrusive carbonation, light yet substantial heft, and fairly dry finish that is somewhat muted by the impressive cherry flavor. Not my favorite kriek (I prefer De Ranke time and again), but this is undoubtedly world-class. Great for a breezy mid-April afternoon in New Mexico."
"Obviously a beer to be appreciated over the course of an hour or so, allowing all the nuance and depth come through with warmth and air exposure. This is surprisingly easy to drink though, as this style (and particular brewery) is known as a hard to approach and oft misunderstood tipple. I wish I had this all the time, it's like a delicious sour cherry candy, which just happens to be an all time favorite of mine. And thus far, this is my favorite beer to come from the Lembeek region of Belgium. Oh, and the bottle and label are the usual high quality Cantillon affair. Of course."
"Overall, I was terribly disappointed. This lambic is severly lacking in so many ways. I believe it gets it lofty rating from those that are more accostomed to a fruit lambic, as a opposed to the try sour lambics that Cantillon is so known for. Maybe, I just got a bad bottle or it needs to age several more years. For now though, I'd advise all true lambic lovers to avoid."
"4/5/5/4/4"
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced acidity and sourness. alcohol is almost completely hidden. nice complexity and depth. a really nice kriek."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, really nice acidity to this one. Not overdone, just awesome character."
"D: Supremely drinkable. This is one I would love to quaff back all day long."
"I liked this one - the lou pepe series obviously delivers, though I'm not sure the added price brings a lot more to the table. Between this and the framboise, the kriek is definitely the winner. Thanks again Matt!"
"One of the best offerings they have hands down and with a little age on it really shines."
"Drinakbility ... ridiculously high... like all the Cantillon's I have tasted. I am looking forward to my next visit to rue Gheude!"
"I managed to catch a few of them as they flew by: cherries, oak, cherries, funk, and cherries. I can confirm that this was a kriek."
"Drinkability is pretty good for a beer this sour. Overall another great one from Cantillon."
"2002 vintage. Pours reddish brown with white head. Aroma is very sour, with wood, cherry, funk and vinegar all playing a part. Very complex and inviting. The flavor is very sour cherry with wood and barnyard funk also in there. This is one of the most tart beers I have had, but it is immensely drinkable. This is a beer I hope I get to try again."
"Drinkability is very good for a pure fruit beer, the sourness can stand to be amped up for my taste, but the cherry really shines, without being syrupy sweet."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy red color lambic with a medium pink foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of naturally sweet and tart cherry is quite wonderful. Taste is also dominated by loads of lightly sweet and fresh cherries with some tart notes and a funky aftertaste. Acidity is very well balanced which is a bit surprising considering the base beer. World classic for sure and something I would drink more often is it was cheaper and more easily available."
"Crisp, acidic body has a nice dry finish. Another great lambic from Cantillon."
"This really is something special and was a treat to have. It really pushes the boundaries of beer which I truly respect. Obviously at this price point, it is to be enjoyed on rare occasion."
"Ah, sweet Brouwer's. Had the privilege of having this at big wood days ago. 04. Really red, fruit punch red with a little carb but not much. very tart and full of cherries. a little bit of funk to it, but mostly the tartness and cherries stand out. this was one of the earlier beers of the evening and it was a delight."
"D - If you're in the mood for a wild and want a bunch of cherry notes, this is your beer. Very good, will purchase again."
"The key word in describing this beer is ""balance."" Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek walks the line between fruity and funky like few others do. This is a world-class fruit lambic and one that I will definitely be visiting again."
"D: My second favorite of the Lou Pepes that we tried, and the better of the two fruit varieties. I'd love to have this again."
"NB - In my mind, this is second only to Blabaer for fruit beers."
"75cl bottle shared by bret27. The best of the night for rating 1300. This was a beast of a beer. I loved their regular kriek when I had it, but this just takes it to another level of sour-cherry-amazingness. Opaque red in color with a small head. Awesomely funky sour lambic nose with lots of tart cherries. There is a lot of cherry on the flavor as well, but very dry and sour in the mix. Very lactic and citric in the tartness, but very rounded into the cherry. Light and spritzy mouthfeel. I need to get the rest of the Lou Pepe lineup now..."
"Sweet pucker, it tastes sharp, sour and mildly fruity. The cherries come through very well and the clean Cantillon sourness is outstanding. Great beer. It could be a little more drinkable, maybe if there were more carbonation it would lighten it up a bit, not sure, but half a glass was enough for me."
"This is a very good traditional Kriek. Don't expect to drink something sweet as the Lindemans... For aficionados only!"
"Overall: Authentic, extremely good example of the style. Worth trying for sure."
"Bottle courtesy bret27. Poured into a Bruery tulip. Deep strawberry red with a light pink head that fades quickly due to the expected acidity. Aroma is lemons and sour cherries, a hint of sweet strawberry, oodles of citric acid. Flavor is very sour but with a solid amount of fruitiness to balance. Sour cherries, slight musty earthiness, old wood, straw. Pretty great kriek."
"What a wonderful beer."
"D - This is one you either sit down by yourself with and savor while you listen to darkwave, or share with other sour-lovers. I wouldn't go bringing this to the BBQ or tailgate party, that's for sure. Quite a massive, refined beer, packed full of flavor and personality. The Dos Equis guy doesn't really drink Dos Equis when he chooses to drink beer, he drinks Lou Pepe Kriek."
"Nice lively mouthfeel, and this is certainly a very good beer."
"the drinkability is very good for this type of beer, it's sour, smooth, and refreshing. one of the best sour beers i've had the privilege of tasting."
"Once again, Cantillon has produced a beer that I enjoy but has really kicked up the vinegar sourness to point that it takes over the cherry presence. Still, very good."
"Simply a classic. I prefer in the bottle because I think it tends to have a nicer mouthfeel. But it's awesome anyway you can get it...obviously. Highly recomended."
"Had a sample of the '04 of this at a gathering of Beer Advocate folks this evening (4/1/09). Colour... medium red with a thin veil of a pink head. Nose... tart, pollenator cherries, vinegar, cherry bark. Palate... whoa! Pucker up buttercup!! Wonderfully tart, lightly carbonated, acetic, redolent of tart pie cherries, vinegar and a hint of cinnamon. Made the salivary glands at the back of my palate gleek into high gear. Man this is nice stuff!!"
"Taste is sour cherry from the beginning, dry and tart, the sharpness balanced by the very full cherry note, balanced and delicious. Because of the balance, one of the most drinkable Cantillons I've had. Superb."
"Fantastic cherry pie and spice in the smell, cinnamon and cherry in the flavor, rivals 3F Oude Kriek which is/was my favorite kriek. This is awesome and I am very glad I bought several bottles back in 09 when Cantillon was not so crazily hyped up."
"Sour refreshing brew."
"Notes from: 1/16/05"
"Probably the best Belgian sour beer I have had. Interesting and subtle, not just sour and tart. So much is going on here it is amazing. Highly recommended."
"7/4/8/3/15 (3.7/5)"
"M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is heavy but not very puckering sour. Drinkability is nice. Excellent beer."
"Drinkability is good but would be better if I could get this locally."
"Taste is very pleasing to the taste buds. No carbonation, wonderful sour cherry taste, smooth body. Dry finish makes this an excellent lambic that is worth seeking out."
"D: Fairly straight forward. Perhaps wouldn't pick it up at the store, personally, but a decent brew."
"Drinkability: I liked the smell on this one a lot more than the taste - it was just a little too tart for me. The smell was fantastically complex though, and since the alcohol is hardly a factor at all, I can't knock the drinkability on this one too much. All in all a decent beer."
"D-Super tar, have I said that already, and oh! so mouth puckering! This has to be about the most sour ""beer"" I have ever had....I love it."
"Like many, I was introduced to this style with a bottle of Lindeman's Kriek, so this was somewhat of a rude awakening. This is a one of kind beer."
"""It's like dark cherry Kool-Aid with Sour Patch Kids."""
"This beer pours a a beautiful ruby red, and it's a bit hazy. There is a nice light pink head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. There are beautifully melded aromas of sour cherry, spice, oak, some light funkiness, and some acetic qualities. The taste is an explosion of vibrant sour cherry, a nice zingy acetic sourness, spicy oak, and a tart finish. Not particularly funky, but there is a slight hint of ripe cheese in the depth of this beer. Very complex and deep. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and quite smooth. The tannins lend a refreshing break from the onslaught of fruit and sourness and give some nice backbone to the body. Utterly delicious. This is not my absolutely top-rated beer, but it is high in the pantheon. An absolutely oustanding kriek."
"D- As good as it was on the senses this beer was too acidic for me. I haven't really experienced anything that was too acidic since my very first sour beer and thought I had just gotten use to it, but this really burns (the 2 other people I was drinking it with said they felt throat and esophageal burning from it also). So just a bit on the acidic side but that is to be expected somewhat. Still really nice, a good beer to enjoy a glass of, though I don't know if I could take more."
"Overall an enjoyable lambic experience. The age has mellowed it well, so it's not overpowering. Very easy to drink but doesn't have the extreme tart bite I was looking for. Recommended..."
"Wow, the first sip was good the second made my mouth pucker I love it. All I taste is cherries and a tart acidic sourness. Definitely worth the money."
"D : It's a really good example of a traditional fruit lambic. Just not my type of beer."
"Probably the best kriekbier I've had."
"D: So refreshing. Once the initial real lambic shock wears off after 1 or 2 sips the underlying complexities of this jump out of the glass. Temperature is the key. Perhaps Map Room's draft lines were just wee to cold when they served this. After enjoying this for about 30min I noticed that as it got closer to room temp, the acidity dialed itself down a few notches and a subtle sweetness began to emerge. Incredible."
"Tangy sour cherry at the tail end and into the long dry finish. Otherwise, fairly mellow and woody. It comes together well, without the brashness of a young lambic, it lets the subtleties really shine. Rich Schaerbeek cherry intensity, almost like cherry pie, with the complexity of cherry skins and pits thrown in too. Long, dry finish that has sublime aged wood and sour fruit flavors. Residual lemony sourness on the lips. Honey in the aftertaste, with a hint of clover. One to savor, and not on an empty stomach!"
"Pours an extremely slightly hazed garnet color with a pink head that doesnt stick around. Smells like when you have a band-aid on and it gets really wet and you dont take it off for a while, but when you do, your skin smells funny. Antiseptic smell. Also a fair amount of fruit and a very mild yeast influence. Flavor is of the best aged lambics. Mildly funky at first with a typical sour punch in the mouth that isn't overly powerful. Definite wood influence on the palate. Calmly there, but not overpowering at all. Feel is typical. Not a ton of bubble, but a little bit. Extremely drinkable. In my limited experience with lambics, this is by far the best I have had. And rightly so for $21 a bottle. If you see it, try it. Worth the money IMO. Bloody marvelous."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. 2004. Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. On tap. Vivid, exciting bright real red fresh cherry juice vibrance, alive with dripping moisture and a wildness of the pits. Florid and bright vermillion, with a rose fringe and blush head. Flavor is a sweet, chirping acidity in the note of perfected aged cherry alcohols, fresh flesh and pining pits. Amazing balance derived singularly from the fruit. All around stunning."
"Too bad this beer has been retired, though I currently wouldn't really have much trouble getting it at Charles Street Liquors..."
"Thanks Cheezdawg!"
"Nice red color with a pink-ish head that dissipated leaving only a ring around the glass. Smell was certainly sour, had some barnyard funk and very tart cherries; I have not seemed to care for other beers with some of these characteristics, but this one is very nice. Taste is much of the same, but its just put together so well that I can't help but love it. Light bodied, but thankfully not bone dry; carbonation was light-medium. This was definitely a joy to drink, I think I'll be searching out more Cantillon; hopefully they can match up with this one."
"The appearance is very nice with a very dark red color that has a pinkish lacing. The smell is sour with horse blanket and cherries in the backround. The taste is a sour kick, but in a good way. The cherries are in the backround of a real lambic flavor with the horse blanket making a big impression on the palate. I can say it's the best lambic I have ever had. The mouthfeel is very good, full bodied. Overall this is a great beer and will get more."
"Now of course this beer will turn many people off. If you respect the true style of lambics, this beer is a grand example of one of the most truly unique styles known to brewing. In my opinion Cantillon rules the lambics. At least the many I've had. For my wedding night we opened a bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise that was amazing, but I wish I had the Kriek. Thankfully I have a bottle sitting in my cellar now."
"A true joy to drink if this style is your bag. A great beer to enjoy, but 1 or 2 will do just fine."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied but never watery. The beer has light carbonation. The flavors are very layered. This beer is not for everyone. The beer has a fairly large sourness and acidity. I on the other hand enjoyed this beer from the begining until it disappeared."
"It pours a rich dark red with a foamy head that disappears quickly. The aroma is of tart sour cherries, malt, horse-blanket funk, and sugar. The taste is incredibly sour, and yet the strange yeast flavors push their way past the sourness, it almost taste as if something went wrong, yet you know that everything is right. The finish is very dry and the palette is left feeling clean. A strange and yet very drinkable beer, at least for those who like something very sour and complex."
"A great beer to taste and enjoy in small portions, an unusually complex beer, comparable to a good dry wine. Good onya Cantillon."
"1999 Vintage, aged in good shape for 7 some odd years! Wow! Poured a beautiful ruby colour, thinly vieled with a soft pink head that circled the trim. A really beautiful - perfect - appearence. A pungeant funk aroma. Not fruity - certainly gueuzey though. Surprisingly not much fruit in the taste either. I might not have guessed this is a kriek. Perhaps the fruit aspect has softened with the time its been aged ? Whatever the case any fruit notes are certainly faded (at best!) That however, would be the only thing I could hold against this beer. This is a sipper, only if you can resist the urge I had to keep going back for more. More of a ""puckerer"" than a ""sipper"". You lick your lips and it's like you just ate a ton of sour candy. Leaves that sugary residue in the mouth/on the lips. So sour - it's fantastic. This actually has become like a crazy rose wine in many ways. That may be the msot accurate way to describe it. It really burns a hole in the of the mouth. Kinda burns! And this is at 7 years old - again, fantastic. Very tart. I could have used more flavour but the whole experience of the mouthfeel is nothing short of incredible. Be happy to finish off with the sediment - wow. Thanks again Sammy."
"2003, had 8 years later, only a bit of mellowing. Funky and sour. Smooth and that pink body."
"Interesting variation on their normal kriek, but I am not sure if I prefer it to their normal version. This does seem sweeter and the lambic-sourness is far more subtle. As far as rating, this beer is highly recommended, I am quibbling over minor issues in a masterpiece."
"It arrived with a light, scarlet toned head. The nose was an intense sour cherry, like Montmorency, mixed with vinegar. The color was a cloudy cranberry, approaching the rich color of red velvet cake. It had a really tart, sour cherry flavor on the tongue that actually caused my eyes to water. The finish was so dry that I felt the arid winds of the Sahara blowing in my throat. This was a really good beer."
"Marchiano cherry red juice in a chalice with a pink fuzz floating on top. The smell is distinctly cherry with a prevailing citiric sourness and a touch of peanut sauce that seems weird with the usually sour funk. I thought I was in for the intense sourness of the other Cantillion cherry I have had, but no this was soft stinging sourness with a cherry flavor that melted over the tongue and really carried me away. In the very noisy bar as I sipped this beer I was in another world unto my self and the beer. Great carbonation and the mouthfeel is superb and this is very drinkable at such a low avb."
" The taste is well blended, no sharp sourness, but it is sour. Same thing with the cherries and funk, everything is layered rather than hitting you all at once. Mouthfeel is great, this may be the most drinkable lambic I've ever had."
"Drinkability- If you can handle the sourness and the burning in your stomach that comes with it, this beer is for you. Cherry up the ying yang! Flavorful and quite the experience."
"Overall, very drinkable, and went nice out in the patio on an August evening."
"Fruty in the aftertaste, dry finish."
"This beer was a big hit at the tasting (Silverhand's review of this beer is from the same), however, I found it ultimately hard to drink."
"It's not a beer I'd want to drink all afternoon, but was really very, very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It doesn't matter whether this is cold or warm. The carbonation is active and adds to the unique feel of this beer. In a proper lambic glass everything is right, the visual appeal nearly matches the beer's allure in the mouth and nose. So easy to drink, the acidity makes this very quenching and easy to have even when full. To get a nice large glass of this for $6 is outstanding. I don't know about a $30 bottle, but on-tap this is a real treat and one I'm lucky to have come across."
"The finish is quite long and drenched with satisfying acidity."
"All in all, another spectacular beer from what is possibly my favorite brewery. Big fruit flavors and a nice full, well-carbonated mouthfeel. Immensely drinkable for a lambic."
"Like I have said before, I find it very redundant to describe the flavors of almost every lambic. This particular one had a much more pronounced fruit profile than the standard Cantillon Kriek but it lacked assertion, especially with its sourness. Quite dry on the finish. Still very good and this was certainly a pleasure to consume. I just wish that they could have blended an older lambic so the sourness would have been a little more pronounced."
"Beautiful looking brew. Perfect scarlet red hue. Perfect clarity. And a good sized head with a grapefruit pink tinged light raspberry red color. Great head. The retention is solid. And the lace is moderate. The aroma is sweet and tart. Brown sugar sweet. Acidic cherry tart. A little bit of the barnyard and horse blanket tones, but not much on the nose. The smell invites me, ""Drink me. Drink me."" So I do. And I'm not disappointed. Tart, acidic tones hit up front. Sour and puckering. But in that good, lambic sort of way. (Or in reality, I should say, ""in that good, Cantillon sort of way."" Because not many do them as good as Cantillon.) There's a nice cherry pie sensation, but this beer is more about the funk and tart than it is the sweet. Cherry tones are juicy, yet tart. The funky barnyard tones are present, but subdued, and enjoyable. Oh yeah, bring it on. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly. A bit cleansing. And the body is about medium or so. This one is incredibly drinkable. Glad I've got her all to myself."
"Shockingly Brilliant!!! A Kriek Premier Cru if ever there was one."
"No head whatsoever over the deep red liquid. The appearance tempted a few ladies in our party to try my ""fruit beer", but they were not impressed. Oh well, their loss is my gain, more for me. Aroma is the expected Cantillon lambic funk, which I won't even attempt to put into words, if you've had one you know what I speak of. Suffice it to say, after many different brews from them, apparently this is the way it is supposed to be. Flavor is a duet of sourness and cherry splendidness, which is an event for the taste buds. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, I will enjoy Cantillons whenever I can, for they are such rarities around here, and should be enjoyed as such."
"Enjoyed with Oakes, tiggmtl, kimchee and martint thanks to Nexxus. It pours a beautiful dark bloody red with a short-lasting pinkish head. Aroma is not too intense for a lambic although some of the characteristics I look for are in there. Blood orange meets cherries, strwaberries, blood, leaves, cinnamon... As it warms up, theres a solvent or toothpaste quality emerging and it seems far less complex like a minty cranberry juice. In mouth though, the cherry flavors is good and clean. Its quite sour, cherry flavored lemon juice alike, but the acidity is clearly mostly lactic. Orange fruity flavors, dry finish which is surprisingly not too astringent. Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. Im impressed at how this is still somehow well balanced and rather thick. Accessible Cantillon, but the best? I think not."
"Got this at Monk's back bar. It poured a hazy crimson and had no head. There is some barnyard and cherrty in the aroma. There is little carbonation in the beer, but it doen't really detract from from this fine beer. The sour cherry is up front and then the funkiness hits. It finishes with some vanilla and a slight woodiness. It is not as complex as the botled version, but more mellow. Still it is excellent."
"I shared a bottle of this which was bought at Cantillon after we toured the place. Seeing it in person made me appreciate Cantillon beers so much more. Anyway, this Lou Pepe Kriek was pretty damn good. I'm pretty sure it made me smile. It poured a deep but not dark red colour with a light pink head. Very nice to look at. It had that funky lambic smell to it in the background, along with cherries and spices. Reminded me a bit of Quelque Chose but not as sweet. Taste was again full of cherries and spice, like cherry pie kind of, very mellow compared to other Cantillons I'd sampled. I wonder if it's because it's straight from the brewery so it's so fresh? Don't know, but it's good. It was soft in my mouth, not syrupy at all for how fruity it is, and yeah, I could drink lots more of it if it were around. Definitely worth trying, especially if you can get it from Mr. Van Roy himself!"
"The tasted is softly acidic (for a Lambic) and it is accompanied by a rich body. There is a definite dry, tart, tannic cherry note here. The time spent on the cherries seems to have increased the body quite substantially. This is quite good, and quite different from what I was expecting. It is a bit softer, and a bit better integrated than the standard Cantillon beers. It is nicely sour, with notes of citrus & vinegar. The finish is woody and reminds me of cherry skins. This is certainly a beer I could drink a lot of. The cherry flavor is quite good in this beer. There is no sticky sweetness, like that found in the more commercial versions, instead there are these intense, chewy, mouth filling, cherry skin, dry, tart flavors that just proclaims that there are cherries in this Lambic. I really like this, and it certainly has grown on me as I finish the bottle."
"In the end: Highly recommended by me, and absolutely amazing fresh. It may be $30 here in the states, but it is still worth every penny. C'mon treat yourself!"
"Had this on tap at Monks. Slightly cloudy dark red low carbonated look in the glass. Nice cherry/musty nose. Intense sour cherry hourse blanket barnyard laden taste. Abusive to the palate. As you drink the brew mellows on the back of the tongue and refreshes. I liked it but this is sure not for everyone due to it's intensity. Viscous mouth with a dry tart cherry finish. Crafted and blended by an artist. An experience.. not just a beer, and not one you could drink alot of in a row but a great apartif."
"Poured a deep burgandy with a rim of pink foam. Smell is vinegar, open air, hint of fruitiness. The taste leads with cherries quickly overpowered by sour vinegar notes, while the finish is dominated by cherries and an acetone-like flavor. Mouthfeel is very soft compared to the other Cantillons I've had - no harsh drying astringency in the finish, just a smooth road to the next sip. Very drinkable, but I prefer the Lou Pepe framboise."
"Pinkish head, dark red color, sour sour sour cherry flavor and aroma, with some leather & other stinky notes. There must be a great food match for this beer b/c it's tough to drink by itself. Perhaps some marscapone? Boon's Mariage Parfait Kriek is so much better"
"This lambic poured a hazy, ruby color with no foam at all. The smell was a modest sour cherry aroma -- nice but subdued. The taste was tart cherry, somewhat sour, with a bit of horse blanket. A very good flavor overall. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp and tart with medium body and low carbonation. The slightly sour cherry flavor lingered pleasantly on the tongue. This was a very good kriek lambic, good to the last drop."
"I had two of these, and could have kept drinking them, it's very good. Dark cherry color when poured, opaque. No head. Aroma is of fresh cherries, with some barnyard meets cinnamon. Taste has a measure of tartness, I actually didn't think this was as tart as the regular kriek. Very enjoyable, I also noticed some dry mustiness in the finish."
"Dark purpley red with a fluffy pink head. True lambic aroma, sour, horses. Cherries of course. The flavor is SOUR. So sour the tongue mistranslates it as almost salty. Past that there's a lot going on underneath. Cherry is subtle here. Not the sweet soda beer of Lindeman's (which I do admit having a soft spot for) and instead a true lambic with the flavor of the fruit."
"A very good brew. Not as assertive as some of there others stuff, but very tasty all the same. smelly barnyard/dirty nappy aroma. Very sour and quite tart, complex array of flavours attack the crap out for tongue, very sour, yummy and even refreshing, i'm yet to have a shitty beer from Cantillon."
"A true rare treat enjoyed at the Boston Beer Summit.  Pure, unadulterated cherry lambic beer.  No blending.  Clean cherry aroma, slightly sour and band-aid like with a hint of being tart.  Flavor is a strong mix of band-aid and sour tartness.  Cherry flavor doesn't come through but is enjoyable nonetheless."
