"Pucker up.  One of the most sour beers I've ever had."

"O: Initially, the smells and flavors coming from this beer were overwhelming. After the first couple sips my nose and taste buds adjusted. Absolutely delicious."
"O: Puckering and bright cherry with funk. Yes, please."

"Taste starts out with a acidic vinegar front, the tart cherry adds a bit of complexity and flavor which is much needed, finishes with a musty funky aftertaste and a bit of grapefruit, semi-dry finish, medium sour puckerness."

"Very odd beer here but it's flavor is good enough for a try. Just don't breathe in too deeply when you put your nose in the glass."

"375ml bottle: It opened with a nice ""pop"". This one pours a red tinged golden color. There was really no head on it and no lacing. Definitely a musty/funky aroma. Some cherry in there too. Interesting taste. Just a bit of the cherry, which gets lost in a sour somewhat lemony citrus taste. Maybe some spices, but they are subdued. A very complex brew. Smooth going down. I’m glad I bought 2."

"Overall - One of the best American lambics, or whatever you want to call it. This series is awesome so far."
"O - One of the better American wilds I have tried. This is really something special. The funk is just right for being nearly 20 months old and the huge wall of tart cherries against the buttery oak is just perfect. Can compete with most authentic Belgian krieks."

"Poured from bottle into a snifter.  All in all it is a nice offering from Allagash.  It is not a Cantillon, but pretty darn good none the less.  Has a great mellow tart funkiness with superb finish.  The cherries add to the tartness.  The head was a white diminishing head that didn't last too long.  Nice rose color that was kind of cloudy from bottle conditioning.  If you can't get a hold of a Cantillon Kriek, then go for this one!"

"Overall, I'm a fan. It's a very tasty kriek, but it doesn't taste quite like any I've had before."

"O - Overall a delicious sour - not enough to make you pucker but quite aggressive non the less. Very refreshing, would recommend to anyone into sour beers."

"Bottled 1/23/2012. Picked the bottle up at the brewery on 6-8-13. Poured in a snifter, the beer is a rose-tinged pink coloring, almost like a dark grapefruit juice, with no head. Huge pop when the cork popped on this one, and tart cherry aromas came out in abundance on the pour. Aromas of subtle cherry sweet and rich on a tart and slightly citrusy backbone. Some funky sour highlights in the nose, also. Flavors are very rich, with an almost floral backbone, that deliver a dark roasted quality at the end of the palate, with woody and earthy tones. In between, there is a rich, dark cherry sweetness that starts in a bold blast that slowly subsides as it washes over the palate. This beer is a bit of a rollercoaster for the taste buds. Tart cherry and slightly acidic characteristics slowly build as you drink. The aftertaste is tangy and tart, with a sweet undertone. Dry, slightly effervescent and sour finish. Very tasty!"

"Not a whole lot of depth here, but a very tasty and light feeling sour I'd drink anytime."

"Overall: My first experience with a lambic is a very favorable one. Allagash really has a great coolship series. The huge cherry flavors and the tartness make this very enjoyable and I almost forget that I'm actually drinking a beer. While I gave this brew a high score, I'm not sure I'd want to drive the 3 hours to the brewery and pay 15 bucks for another bottle of this. If I found this in a local shop then I most likely would. Nonetheless, this is a great beer and I'm excited to venture even further into the world of sours."

"One of the most well-rounded sours I've ever had, blew my mind."

"Overall- Damn good cherry wild. Yet another great Allagash wild!"

"Served in an Allagash coolship tumbler. Nose is less cherry heavy than the Balaton. More funk and acidity. Funky earth in the background. Super dry. This was one of the better ones of the Coolship Series, though was by no means my favorite. The background funk was a nice addition to the cherry."
"Light in body, airy on the palate, nice fruitiness to the whole thing, interesting beer overall, I'd have it again. The finish is tart and dry, a nice combination."
""
""
"The beer is light pink with a thin white head. The aroma offers sweet cherries with a touch of yeast and oak. The flavor is cherries, cherry pie, crust. A touch of lemon and vinegar in the finish. mild tartness and acidity in the finish. Subtle lactic presence. Fairly thin and light in body, with alcohol presence well disguised. A decent fruit sour ale, but again, not in the same echelon as the Belgian greats of this ilk."
"The base beer is exceptional with a very clean acid and just enough funk to keep things interesting. The cherry component is seriously lacking though."
""
""
"Overall solid but I won't be seeking it out again anytime soon."
"Medium bodied with a tart, lactic funk that isn't acetic or harsh.  Decently sour but not too much do.  More funky than anything else with a slight acetic quality.  Just a touch of vinegar in the finish but not solent like.  Not very sweet with the cherries again being slightly integrated.  Subtle vinous character with some fruit skin and cherry pit.  Finishes dry with some lingering acidity."
"Pours a nice pink color with an off-white head. The cherries certainly come through. A bit of a cherry pie type aroma along with oak and grass. A bit on the sweet side. The flavor does have a significant cherry component, but it’s also a bit watery. Lightly sweet with a mild lemon tartness. Not much in the way of depth or complexity, but easy to drink."
""
""
"Where the cherry flavor isn't as integrated as I would have wished, nor does it display the aged and dried cherry taste that more traditional krieks do; the pedio-forward aged character stands alone and doesn't embrace the fruit at least not yet. I would love to see this beer after a year or two of melding inside the bottle."
""
"D - Easy to drink, difficult to acquire, and pretty underwhelming compared to its Belgian brethren. Probably my least favorite of the Coolships. I'm also puzzled by the unusually high alcohol content, particularly compared to other lambic and even other Allagash offerings."
"This is decent, but it doesn't have the depth of flavor that Balaton does."
"O - A solid American Wild, but this didn't really blow me out of the water. For the low bottle count and how hard these are to obtain, I would just go for something else in the style category. Decent."
""
""
"Pretty consistent flavor from the aroma. Light cherry. Lactic sourness; not too strong. Bitter funk bite on the finish and more cherries. Definitely not as good as the balaton version."
""
""
"Overall weird and funky but nice, good funk and tart chery blend."
""
""
"o - overall unique and different. not something i need again and my clear least favorite of the three. the cherry flavoring is really overshadowed by the cherry flavor of the balaton which is more to my liking."
"TASTE: Dry, semi-tart, oaky, sour cherries, lemon, vinous, herbal, hay, medicinal"
""
""
""
""
"D:  Not quite as good as I was expecting, but still a great spontaneous beer"
""
"O: Allagash has done something special. It's not quite perfect but it's close. I love the bottle and the little card you can get that describes the coolship process. Keep it up!"
""
""
""
"I like this one, it's very drinkable and refreshing. If not for the higher ABV I'd say this is very much like a Belgian version."
"Allagash is on the verge of something truly special on this side of the pond and I'm for one excited."
""
""
"o - Overall this was one of my favorite beers of the weekend. Ton of sour fruit in the nose and sour fruit and funky brett in the taste. Would love to have this one again sometime."
"The taste is very nice sour but not puckering reminds me of zwanze 11 with cherries instead of pinot. The carbonation is very pleasant tickles the tongue and releases the tart flavors which leaves a earthy flavor nice"
"drinkability is great. good depth. love the spiced cherry character. nice restrained funk. great!"
"While I took the strong band aid note to be a sign of a flaw in the brewing process, I must say that it didn't completely take away from the brew which was still fairly enjoyable."
