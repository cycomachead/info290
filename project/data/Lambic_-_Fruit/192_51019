The taste was weird; trying to have the sour taste of La Follie (spelling might be off), it also attempted to have the taste of wine, which kind of threw me. The feel was thin and hard on the tongue.

Overall this is a very decent fruit beer not as intense as expected considering the collaborator yet it is very drinkable and would definitely enjoy this again.","Slatetank","Nov 03, 2014"

Not an overly bad thing, but it makes the blend appear to not really be working. Something interesting to sip on in the nice Front Range autumn sunshine, so I'm glad I got to try it here, as the retail bottle price seems a bit steep, from what I've heard.","biboergosum","May 29, 2014"

3.09,-11.7,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Bottle from Tipples. Pours bright ruby reddish almost fuscoa purple with a pretty pink head that fizzes out after about a minute. Aroma is dry wheat malt, sweet maraschino cherries, not a lot more here but pleasant enough. Flavor has no real sourness expected from the style, but not medicinal. Light tartness if I look hard for it. Seems like an amped up Sam Adams cherry wheat. Cherry juice and malt are dominant with almost a bit of a lager taste to it. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly slick, with low plus carbonation. Not an unpleasant or offensive beer by any means, but it's hard to believe that the same brewery made both this am La Folie.","BMMillsy","May 18, 2014"

I loved the smell - tart cranberries, sour cherries, a little sour apples, little balsamic oak-iness, cherry pie, definitely fruity. Taste followed the noise though in a subtler less sour manner than expected. Fruity for sure with slight funk notes (though maybe I was reaching), quite sweet though I wouldn't say overtly artificial like other reviews have but really quite fruity - not syruppy in either flavour or mouthfeel - which was medium and smooth, I think I would have wanted the carbonation a little tighter. All in all I really enjoyed this beer, definitely light on the sour, more sweet and gentle tart fruit notes but really enjoyable.","jwchestnut","Feb 09, 2014"

3.8,8.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into globe glass, bottled on 1/2/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear pale ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, cherry skin, apple, pear, grape, hay, light pepper, red wine, vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of cherry, yeast, and funk notes; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, pear, apple, grape, hay, red wine, light pepper, light vinegar, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, cherry skin, pear, apple, grape, red wine, light vinegar, light funk, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of cherry and yeast flavors; with a good sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good fruit lambic style. Good balance and complexity of fruit and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some red grapes and a floral flavor noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a little watery with a decent amount of carbonation.

Mild carbonation stems from the center of the glass, lacing isn't too bad. Aroma of sour cherry, oak, some grape and a sweet malt. Other dark fruits are there as well, a touch of citrus and strawberry meld well with the alcohol. There is some definite complexity to the smell, it's pretty good. The taste however really comes up short. Much of the intricacy of the scent becomes lost as the taste becomes dominated with cherry. Initially a mild sour at first, it has a very sweet malty finish, leaving the beer pretty one dimension-able. The feel is poor also, as it too is dominated by this time carbonation. Very fizzy finish, but I'll at least give it that I don't taste much of the alcohol. Overall my impression of this is that it's like drinking cherry soda spiked with cherry pucker. I'm pretty new to lambics, but based off the overall score I think I'd be assuming correctly that this is a poor representation of the style.","lordofstarside","Mar 07, 2013"

I don't get much of that tart acidic lambic yeast character at all, just more like a sweet American syrupy fruit beer. the flavor is equally disappointing, its lacking that sharpness. especially for almost 20 bucks a bottle, this is a farce. teeth rotting sugary finish, cherries seem artificial, and the pucker is entirely absent. also the alcohol stands out a bit, which is unbecoming to a kriek. I was really let down by this, and to charge that price makes me angry at new Belgium, who hasn't done anything at all to impress me for some time now. too much body, fine carbonation, but its too late for the feel to help anything. overall save yourself some money and skip this substandard offering.","StonedTrippin","Mar 04, 2013"

Scent is somewhat funky and tart, but NOTHING along the lines of a lambic or American wild ale. Definitely has more of a fruit beer aroma, which is somewhat misleading since they call this one a kriek. Anyhow, the cherry comes through in the nose, along with some grainy malt aromas. Taste is tart at first, but QUICKLY becomes a mediocre fruit beer. Flavors of cherry and cranberry are present, but they are overtaken by grainy, cereal-like flavors that make this beer a bit underwhelming. Where you would want tartness and fruit flavors, you get a strange medicinal alcohol flavor. Pretty disappointing, just like the one I had two years ago was. Mouthfeel is nice, highly carbonated, and suits the beer that this one should be. Overall, not even close to my favorite Kriek, let alone fruit beer. Considering Boon plays a part in this, they should increase the quality of this one. Not undrinkable. Not bad. Overpriced. Would not buy again.","DovaliHops","Feb 25, 2013"

I'm not sure if there is wild yeast in the bottle, but it doesn't seem like this beer has developed much over time. The sourness is only noticeable, and in the end there is a good deal of artificial sweetness in the finish of the beer that is very off-putting.

I've had a lot of ""lambics"" and this misses the mark completely. There is no citric or acetic brightness, there is no forward cherry flavor or sweetness at all, it's a tart mess. Lactic bomb. Its not a good stand alone flavor IMO. Parallel beers balance it with fruit or make the sourness harsher with additional mixed acids.

The taste has a tart strawberries and cherries and crem taste right upfont. The middle takes a more general tart fruit flavor with some earthy lambic yeasty goodness. The finish is ripe fruit and must. The palate feels more carbonated than it looks. Fruity and tart, but lacking complexity and sophistiction.

I am not sure why this hasn't been reviewed better than it has been, but I certainly enjoyed it. It was a bit on the expensive side for a beer that was only 55% lambic, but I picked it up at a store that marks its beer up too much IMO, so it may be more reasonable elsewhere.

Luckily the barnyard isn't there on the palate, as the sour cherry with light baking spices take over.

This beer pours a bright raspberry red with a 1 inch pastel pink head that recedes into just a thin layer resting on the top of the beer leaving just a spackle of lacing all over the glass. The aroma is a bright cherry vinegar with oak, lemon zest, diacetyl and a bit of Belgian candy sugar. The flavor isn't nearly as dynamic as the nose is. All of the flavors are just dull versions of the aroma. Tart cherries, lemon, oak, sacramental wine and sweet apple cider vinegar. Also the butter is a bit more powerful then I would have wanted. My biggest problem with this beer is the finish on the flavor profile is overwhelming sweet. The sweetness on the finish overshadows much of the crisp tartness of the Boon Kriek.
