3.85,12.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Had a bottle of this at a Thai restaurant in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Poured into a Belle-Vue tulip glass. Cherries is the key word for this strange carbonated lambic brew. The scent of cherries is a bit overpowering, but definitely not unpleasant. The head on this brew was beautiful to look at, rosy in hue and leaving a thin, delicate lacing around the glass, bubbling up in the middle as a good Belgian beer should. However, the carbonation in this was a bit much for me, feeling more like cream soda than a beer. The flavor, too, while it was definitely cherry, was a bit too sour and not really resembling a beer (even for a lambic). Overall, this is a tasty cherry drink that would go over well with those who don't like the taste of standard brews. However, when it comes to fruit beers and lambics, I know other brands I will choose again over this. Tasty though...","shigg85","Mar 26, 2012"

3.73,8.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The Crack & Glug produced two big, rocky fingers of cotton candy-pink head with good retention. The room filled with the smell of sweet cherries! Color was a very pretty ruby red with NE-quality clarity. Leaning in, the cherry smell was definitely of sweet cherries, as opposed to sour ones, which go into New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red. Mouthfeel was big and full with a dryness borne less of the cherries than of the beer's maturation in oak barrels along with the wild yeast. It was not too sweet, but it was not as sour or funky as many other Krieks that I have had. One reviewer characterized it as a ""chick's beer", but just because it is made from fruit does not mean women are necessarily going to flock to it. Instead, it is more like a good introductory beer to the style, fitting for anyone, especially the curious. Finish was slightly dry and very refreshing, but one at a time would be plenty. I would put some in the cooler if asked to do so, but I am not going to put it in of my own volition.","woodychandler","Feb 16, 2011"

It has a slightly sour aroma but is dominated by a sweet cherry aroma that seems authentic. The cherry flavor is a bit different though. It seems almost artificial either because it actually is artificial or they just put too much cherry into it. The sourness is there in the background helping to cut the overwhelming cherry flavor.

Fruit smells dominating, specifically cherries and rasberries...almost a spritzer quality. Taste was very tart, giving a champaigne taste accompanied by the fruit characters. It was also a sharp tasting beer that needed a bit of warming before some other flavors, the most dominant being strawberry pulled through. Mouthfeel was light/medium bodied, with fairely high carbonation. This is a winner in my book, but you really need to like tart fruit to really enjoy this one.

Unfortunately the head reduces itself quite quickly to a minimal covering. Dark dark ruby reds, black cherries, fleeting murky purple hues. The beer is not transparent in the least. I love a good sweet beer, and the sugary candied aroma of this kriek whets my appetite. Of course, deep oak notes are in the smell, too. The malt is there, hiding behind the massive sugar and oak. Next to no hop aroma, and indeed the aroma is uncomplex, yes, but sweet enough in a balanced way to make me rate it decently. Red licorice, candied apple, and a flowery nectar note. The taste is a well-balanced sweet sensation, for me. The sugar obviously predominates, with oak and just enough dryness to prevent it from being sleek with sugar. The front is all cherry sweet, in the middle the oak, and the end is more sugar, but with some iron, yeast and even grainy malt. Licorice, tomato acid, and transient hop dryness. The carbonation is medium, the body full. I can never drink more than two of these at one time, or the sugar becomes too much, even for me. Absolutely perfect with cake or simply as an after-dinner treat. Other than the stigma of being owned by Interbrew(and of seeing this in Belgium canned) this is a very good kriek by all rights.","Cwrw","Oct 03, 2004"

It's overpowered by sweet and sourness that my nose can't really tell. Taste is disapointing. I had too much hopes for this beer. Expecting something sourly puckering and barnyard like, I'm instead greeted with a light, cherry & malt sweetness with a somewhat sour aftertaste. Not bad, I guess. I like it, I just wanted more. Mouthfeel is odd. Sticky at certain points of the mouth, but otherwise pretty smooth. The tongue smacks after the drink is finished. It's actually pretty drinkable. Kind of refreshingly tart.

Oh, and there's a bit of cherry in the taste. The opening is more sweet than sour, while the finish comes on sour. There is definitely an undercurrent of malt throughout the drinking experience, thus differentiating the brew from cherry soda.

Flavour matches up, sweet cherry taste up front with a sour cherry finish. Slightly acidic mouthfeel, and not something I'd want to have as a session beer, but it holds its own.

Those factors, along with a decent flavor profile, lead to a nice drinkability. The flavor profile is primarily cherry, but not heavy with it. There are sweet and sour tugs of war going on (even if they are somewhat subdued compared to a Rodenbach). There is an appealing acidity to this beer. The sourness, although coming from the cherries, seems a bit lactic in nature. There's a dry oak woodiness in the background as well. There's a sweet brown sugar aspect that comes and goes also.

A full flavored cherry taste that brings you back to the days when you were sipping on some cherry Kool Aid. The presence of sweet barley malt is also present. A very good dessert beer, that is popular with the ladies it won my girl's heart. Drinkable when it comes to taste, but very sweet I couldn't consume too many.

Teeters somewhere between a sweet dessert beer and a mild session beer, which I found rather unappealing.

4.1,19.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"750 ml. cork & cage bottle. Pours a bold foamy pink head atop a brownish-red body; but it cannot hold. Actually quite nice in appearance! Very unique. The aroma is unrestrained, pure sweet cherry with only minimal sour notes appearing sporadically. The flavor is agressive as well, with sweet cherry overiding a tart, acidic fruitiness. Although the sweet-and-sour cherry palate is well balanced, the gripping 'tip-of-the-tongue-mouth-puckering' intensity is somewhat missed. A trade off? - This beer is much more accessible than other Krieks. The two-sided flavor eventually dries into a tart finish which is more reminiscent of the expected flavor profile. This beer makes a good sweet & lightly sour apertif or after-dinner drink but it lacks all of the complexity of the geuze - which is it's base. Still, it does have alot of character overall.","NeroFiddled","Jul 22, 2002"
