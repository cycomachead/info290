"The color is like a pastel tint of red, with a head that is pinkish. The head diasappears quickly, with a lot of fizzing. The aroma is sour, but is somewhat softened by the cherries. The taste is also sour. The cherries give it a nice taste, whitout making it a sweet beer. Carbonation is relatively high. Nice beer."

"Beautiful red beer with a nice pink head. The scent is kind of subdued but the flavor comes through amazing. Nice smooth cherry funk."

"This is a pretty good beer."

"Light, tart crisp cherry flavor. Sour without being obnoxious. Balanced. Short finish. LPK this is not, but it's a decent kriek."

"Need to compare more of the same style.  So here's to trying many more.  Cheers!"

"Serving type: bottle"

"Generally notes are cherry flavor with a decent tart quality. The beer lacks carbonation as it pours almost flat."
""
""
""

"A classic, excellent kriek. Lots of complex rich cherry flavor with a solid lambic underneath."

"Great to try and a wonderful treat to tick off."

"The sweetness from the fruit tones down the sourness that I was expecting."
""
""
""
""

"O - Big bracing sourness, funky acidity, the cherries are just there to accentuate. I personally prefer a bit more of a balance of fruit/sourness, but this is nice - it's definitely a sipper, but a good choice when if you're looking for that intense sour kick."

"Sweet cherries, has the characteristic Belgian funk, though not as pronounced as other 3F beers I've had. A pleasant oaky dryness. I wonderful standard for the style."

"Deep cherry-red color, topped with a huge fluff of fizzy pink head out of the bottle, which soon settled to a half-finger of delicate foam, and further to a wispy layer, leaving strands of lace on the glass. Effervescent. Lots of funk and oak in the aroma, big lacto notes, herbal and leafy, very little cherry detectable until the beer warms a little, but I prefer having this one nice and chilled. Nice acidic twinge right up front on the palate, lemony lacto, natural-tasting sour cherry, freshly chopped oak, notes of dried leaves and grass, with a decisive yeasty funk, horseblanket, and a tiny fruity sweetness peeking through every once in a while. Complex and tasty. Medium body, puckering mouthfeel, high initial carb dies down to a more moderate level fairly quickly, making for an overall tasty and enjoyable kriek. Exemplary."

"O-nice Kriek with very authentic cherry flavor and nice tart funky backbone"

"O- very delicious overall. This is a new style for me and if this is representative of the style i can definitely see myself getting into these."
"A very ""wound-up"" brew. Not overly flamboyant, or self-sufficient. Lots of action in this brew. Kinda forgettable, but it's still good, just not OMG amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance: Beautiful ruby red. Pink head that dwindled to an off white ring around the glass quickly. Smell: Intensely acidic with cherry and earthy support. Lacking some of the barnyard characteristics. Taste: High acidity. Cherries linger throughout. Again lacking some of the lambic characteristics I want. Too young, maybe? Mouthfeel: Light body. High tart. No astringency. Overall: A wonderful fruit lambic. So very refreshing."

"Overall, a very refreshing, pleasant sour beer. I have very little experience with traditional Krieks, so my opinion on this one is probably worth very little right now, but of all the ones I've been fortunate enough to acquire so far, this is clearly the best one. It's not sweetened and it's not unpleasantly sour. I do wish it had more cherry flavor to it, but it's aged so I can't fault it for that. It's pricey, but certainly recommended for any true beer hunter."

"Small cork and caged bottle from Tipples dated June 6, 2013. Pours an intense deep red color, mostly clear, with a pretty pink bubbly head on top. Huge sour aromas, vinegar, dark tart cherries, dusty dry oak. Flavor is big black cherries, tartness with some light vinegar, dry oaky finish that lingers a bit with the cherry. Big sourness here. Spritzy carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Overall I like this much better than the Intense Red, and just as much or more than Lou Pepe Kriek. Good stuff."
"edit: bumping up a few marks here, may have had this a bit young before, the beer has changed a lot, more funk, more genuine fruit, and less of the residual weirdness. a true champion among krieks, and upon reading my review from just a few short months ago, i am disappointed i rated it as poorly as i did. i think this is one of the very best examples of the style going. period."

""

"O-This is a delicious and true-to-style Belgian beer. It is not as complex or wild (or manufactured tasting) as some, but the relatively subtle flavors work well and do not overwhelm my palate. I could have gone for a little less carbonation and a little more cherry/fruit to make this beer world-class, but I would happily drink more of this if I could find it."
""
"O: A phenomenal beer with great flavors. Very well crafted and a joy to drink. A bit pricey for a bottle though."
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting beer I guess, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this is another one of those intensely sour lambics, gueuze and wild ales that I just can't appreciate (or understand how anyone else could appreciate)."

"Pours a ruby red color with a light pink, 2 inch head. The head disappears quickly. Quite a bit of carbonation raises from the bottom of the glass as well. The aroma consists of sour cherries. Tart cherries, a hint of oak, and a touch of sour grapes greet the taste buds as you sip. Carbonation is strong on the tongue and a perfect amount of tartness leaves the mouth wanting more. It is a light body with full flavor. As this was first brew from Drie Fonteinen, I will definitely seek out more as I really enjoyed this one."
""
"Fruity, tart and refreshing, this is a delicious cherry lambic that has sparkling wine-like flavors and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""

"O: Great kriek! Recommended. Would have again."
"Note: Bottled 27 January 2012, imbibed 21 January 2014."

"375ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash Coolship tumbler. 27/01/2012 & 01/2014 printed on the label. Pours a lovely deep cranberry hue with a fluffy pink head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes and dissipates into a thin tight band around the shoulders. Copious tiny bubbles are evidenced clinging to the walls of the glass, but no lacing. Nose expresses citric acid, cork and a suggestion of tart fruit. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a definite tart cherry presence. Mouthfeel is light in body with a dull carbonation and a subtle acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks - I was hoping for something a little more effervescent, but perhaps it sat on this one a little too long. A very good kriek, but I'm sorry I didn't drink this one fresher. I'll definitely need to track down a fresher bottle in the future."

"Pours a murky violet burgundy capped by a light pinkish sea foam-like head that dissipates almost immediately. The nose brings whiffs of oak, cherry, berry-like fruitiness, and a bit of vinegar. Tart cherries and oak greet the tastebuds immediately, hints of mixed berries, hay, and balsamic vinegar join in, finishes with the perfect amount of mouth puckering sour and musty oak and a final burst of sour cherries. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Overall, an truly exceptional brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has aged absolutely fantastic - not as tart as Drie Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek, but better. The finish is so rich and decadently cherry - similar to the finish on the Lou Pepe Kriek, but better even. Layers of tart and sweet cherry, oak, earthy notes. The dark cherry plays so nicely."
""
""
""
"O- dangerously drinkable, wish every bar was required to have a well done kriek on tap"
""
"this is a really tasty example of this style, but i do wish there were higher carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall an excellent beer that id never turn down."
"I bet you could slip this to countless wine snobs and get them to believe this was a nice Sonoma red. Good beer; some active carbonation may really have done it a favor."
"O- This was a great kriek that stands up with some of the best belgian fruited beers. The smell seemed just a tiny bit off with a very subtle plastic presence but the rest of the beer was fantastic. I'd love to get another bottle of this and try aging it a bit as I think the sweetness of the fruit could be a little bit more subtle with letting a tiny bit more funkiness come out."

"Overall a nice mellow and perhaps not as flavorful hinting kriek compared to what is sensed on the nose, but very subtle and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So very good. Must have more."
""
""
""
"O - Overall a delicious beer, but thats about it. Damn tasty though and worth the money really."
"Pours a dark pink-purple color and bruises the palate as well! Aroma is dominated by fruit, or rather jam. Extremely sour but with tons of cherry flavor... I don't think cherry flavor fades with time. The lambic in notable only in funky undertones. Very dry and extremely lactic, this beer is great for sharing."
""
""
"O: I really liked this kreik I am once again impressed by 3 font's brewing. It has a really great sour flavor while maintaining balance. It isn't the greatest beer ever, but i really like it and as far as kriek goes it is one of the best I've had."
""
"O - nice beer, would age and drink again."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good kriek lambic, but could done with a bit more carbonation. I was a little disappointed with this one. There are lots of better, easier to find options out there."
""
"Far more subtle than other Lambics I've had in this style, but nevertheless retains complexity and solid flavor throughout. I do think that in the future I will try to hunt down a 750ml bottle and cellar it for a few years so that the funk starts to shine through over time. This beer is definitely a good way to introduce people to traditional Belgian sours and not make them run away screaming. Quite a masterfully crafted kriek overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tart. Feel it in the jaw.No head but it does have carbonation. Medium bodied. Bone dry."
"o - overall, was extremely impressed with this beer and will be seeking out some more of this."
""
""
""
""
"O - Tart a light, crisp fruit with a sour finish."
""
""
"Tasted along with '10 Cantillon Kriek, '07 Boon Kriek Mariage Parfait, and '10 Drie Fonteinen Schaarbeekse Kriek. Ranked 2nd to Cantillon."
""
"Overall: Really nice kriek. Not my favorite, but its very enjoyable. I normally do not gravitate towards the super funky sours, but this beer had just the right amount of funk without crossing the line by being an overly funky beer."
""
""
""
""
"Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen makes incredible beer. While Oude Kriek is an excellent example, it’s actually not one of their best. That, in and of itself, is a testament to their skills. Oude Kriek is damn impressive. It’s very refined, complex, and sophisticated. Art in a bottle. Find some."
"O: Excellent drinkability. I would like to taste a ""younger"" one (this is a 6 years old bottle) to compare. Absolutely great beer. No more comments..."
""
""
"The appearance is a light red color with a short foamy white head. Its` nose has sour cherries, dusty cellar and hay. Tipping it back for a taste and I get some funk, a good dose of cherries and a nice tart quality to it. The mouthfeel is medium with a heavy handed sourness, where the finish was a little sharper than I like in fruit lambics. But, with all things considered, this is nonetheless a fine beer. Certainly one that is great to open with friends to celebrate and perhaps discuss the interesting qualities of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A very nice Kriek indeed, but as I mentioned, not quite on par with the gueuze I had earlier in the week. Meybe I'm just spoiled these days..."
"Oude Kriek is an adventure through and through, and it's one I recommend having."
""
""
""
""
"375 ml bottle. Pours a clear reddish pink with a small pink head that settles to a ring and leaves some very light lacing on the glass. The aroma has lots of tart cherry, a light musty funk, a bit of lemon, raspberry, and some grape. The taste has a bit of initial sweetness with tart cherries. Then there is some lemon, lactic acit, raspberry, and some musty funk. The finish has a lingering cherry flavor and a bit of funk with some astringency. A bit sweeter than I would like. Medium body. Low carbonation."
"2009 vintage, European release. This beer pours a light bodied, deep cherry red in color with a nice slightly pink lacing. The nose is smooth and tart. There is nice acidity and plenty of sour cherry. The flavors are as well rounded as you can find from a Kriek. It is very smooth and offers a nice amount of both sour and fresh cherry. It drinks very smoothly and the yeast isn't overbearing at all. This is a Kriek fans Kriek. I wish this was easy to find in 750mls. I like it a lot more than Schaersbeeks. This is a must try. This bottle was the best Kriek I've had yet."
""
""
"Overall: A really fantastic lambic, and I would love to see what more again would do to this beer's flavor profile."
"T: Tons of sour cherries throughout with a slight lactic tartness. A touch of unripe raspberry with a rich jammy finish. A touch of lemon and tannins on the finish."
""
"Overall, a very good intro to authentic Belgian sours/lambics. Interested to get into the geuzes."
"Excellent lambic, and brutally sour. The gritty sensation in the mouthfeel and somewhat muted aroma (other than the horseblanket) are my only real knocks."
""
""
""
""
""
"375ml bottle. Sour and cherries aromas. Pours bright red, some hazy, with little pinkish head, vanishing, and almost no lacing. Light body and high carbonation. Taste is cherries, very sour but quite balaced, not too agressive flavours (bearing in mind this is a real sour beer style, of course). Aftertaste is long, dry and some sweet. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This beer makes me ache for the few weeks it was available on the shelves of the chain stores in Reno. Pricey, yes, but a worthwhile treat that hopefully, fate permitting, I can continue to keep a few just hanging out around the house, waiting for that right moment to drink up."
"2009 properly aged bottle. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark ruby red color. Virtually no carbonation, a few lazy bubbles on the pour, then flat. Aroma of cherries, light oak and a hint of vinegar. Sour cherry start then other flavors develop including a surprising pie crust flavor that ultimately reveals itself to be related to the oak aging. Complex. Finishes with an interesting sweet / sour cherry and fruit flavor. A hint of funk. An very nice flavor progression. I'm not a sour beer fan, but this is very enjoyable and interesting to drink. I'm really glad I was able to get a bottle of this to try. I would have preferred a bit of carbonation and don't know whether the complete flatness of this kriek was due to age or not. Still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I absolutely loved this as my first experience with a fruit lambic. I cannot wait to explore this style further!"
""
"O: The age helped to smooth this bottle out and it was awesome. I'm glad that I have another bottle."
"O: Not very complex or surprising but sharp, pleasant and well blended. A nice kriekenlambic!"
"O - This is a great tasting cherry lambic, especially if you like them sour and not so sweet."
"MF/D: Smooth velvety feel to it, lighter in body than expected. Overall a very enjoyable beer, wish I paired this with something"
"Very nice kreik."

"375 mL bottle split with my doppelganger this weekend! Bottled December 2, 2005! Served from bottle into a New Belgium globe. Poured ruby red with a very minimal pinkish white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, funk, and subtle tart cherry. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, funk, and sour cherry. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I have to be honest that this one has become very still with the age on it. However, the cherry flavors are still lingering around which is always nice to see. Also a nice musty funk has come into play as well keeping the beer exciting. The aroma was definitely the highlight though for me with a nice sweet cherry note. Definitely worth trying this vintage if you get the chance or if you prefer still Oude Krieks."
""

"Poured a deep violet color with about a half finger of white head. As soon as I opened this, my father, sitting across the room, said ""I can smell that from here - what are you drinking vinegar?"" The smell was full of funk, sweet cherries, oak, and lactic acid. Big tartness and sourness up front, and the cherries reveal themselves towards the back. A nice balance between funk, fruit, and sour. I was thoroughly impressed with this lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great authentic, funky kriek! I preferred the Cantillon and Hanssens, but I will still be buying this one again in the future."
""
""
""
"Body is fairly light to medium-light with aggressive carbonation, producing a crisp and effervescent mouthfeel, as expected for the style. Finish is dry."
""
"O- As always Drie does it well. All the lambics they create are wonderful and this one is no exception. Lots of fruit forward flavor and good oak character. The only reason this is not a five to me is I have had the pleasure of enjoying, including other krieks from Drie, other lambic krieks that I would consider a little better. That being said this a wonderful beer and is well worth the fancy import price tag."
""
"[86/100]"
""
""
"O: This is an ugly beer that is under carbonated. However, the sour cherry flavor is quite nice and is very well integrated with the other flavors. All the flavors are quite balanced and support each other very well."
""
""
"This is a nice brew, but the cherry flavor is towards the back end. There is no shortage of lambic flavor."
""
"This beer pours a lovely ruby color with a decent light light pink head that recedes rather quickly. the smell is wonderful, earthy barnyard funk with a nice tart cherry hint in the finish of the nose., after about 5 years in the bottle the cherries are still present. the flavor is funky, a nice tartness lemony cherry goodness. the mouthfeel is dry well carbed almost puckerinbg but not quite. overall an excellent kriek"
""
""
"O: Sour ales have stolen my heart and I appreciate a good lambic. This delivers fairly well in both departments but is slightly too thin."
""
""
"O: Love it. The best Lambic I've had so far. One I could see drinking all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very good stuff. expensive so probably won't splurge again on this but worth a try once."
""
""
""
""
"Bottled March 31, 2009. This beer opens with a big pop. The beer is a deep dark pinkish red color with an off white just pink head. Spots of lacing. A nice film remains on the top of the beer. The aroma is big cherry pie with a mild funky must and a mild vinegar big tart note. Flavor is largely cherry again with a nice balance of acetic and lactic balance. Very tart with some nice funk notes. Good light refreshing mouthfeel with a bit less carb than I was expecting. Overall this is a damn good beer. A bit more sweetness and vinegar than I expected, but very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a very pretty dark garnet red with a vividly pink tinted head. The foam quickly subsides leaving just a feather of bubbles on top. The beer smells soooo funky and acrid. The beer tastes equally funky with a lot of lactic acidity upfront that fades out to the mineral, musty, swampy, almost spoiled flavors. The finish is dry with a salty, tart cherry tang. The MF is very effervescent with abundant carbonation that just sparkles. This is a nice Kriek Lambic, but the overly funky (imo) flavors really mutes the brightness from the fruit. However, the vibrant acidity is nice, although my stomach might hate me in the morning for it."

"A delicious kriek and fairly available."
"O - The beer is quite tart and even thought it starts off very acidic it kind of dies down a bit. Good brew."
"This is a medium bodied brew that initially is quite fizzy and highly carbonated. While enjoying this brew throughout a fairly long duration I was able to swirl some of the carbonation out making for a more rich tasting cherry and smooth feel in the mouth. The smoothness to the finish is quite unique and really melds out that acidic nature of the brew. The alcohol (while listed as 5%) was completely hidden throughout this experience. It doesn't matter to me if fruited Drie Fonteinen offerings are 7 months old or 7 years old, I can't say no and throughly enjoy each experience."
"bottled 3/31/09, consumed 11/11/11, 2 1/2 years old. This one wasn't a brightly colored as the fresh one I had last week. Red, but more dull. Nose isn't as intense - more cherry than the 2011 vintage and the sour notes are more subdued; also a bit of funky must. The taste is barely sour at all compared to the fresh one; the cherry flavor is WAY more dominate than the sour flavors...almost cherry pie-esque. For big sour notes and less cherry, get the 2011 vintage; for more kriek flavors, though, seek out the 2009."
"O: The lack of head and almost non-existent carbonation seems off. Almost flat..."
"375ml bottled on April 1, 2011. Pours a beautiful, sparkling red color with a large, light pink head that goes down slowly. Scent is...wow...extremely funky! Tons of barnyard funk, horse blanket, and just a bit of gym socks. A bit of must too. But amongst all those strange aromas, there lies some inviting cherry and acidic aromas. Taste is AWESOME! Oh so sour! Much more sour than I was expecting. Mouth puckering funky barnyard and sour cherries attack the taste buds instantly. This is very acidic. Musty and quite oaky with some more cherry and sweet fruit. Finishes nice and dry. Mouthfeel is puckering, highly carbonated, and leaves the teeth feeling strange. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this was a VERY enjoyable lambic that I wish I had access to all the time. Absolutely delicious!"
"Nice Kriek overall, glad to have tried it."
"Overall - I love lambics with a lot of funk to them and this one delivers as all the Drie Fonteinen lambics seem to do. The acidity is still strong, but enjoyable. Good stuff and I look forward to comparing it to the Schaerbeekse I have stashed away."
"o - very nice and fresh. it's nice to have a fresh kriek (even though it is still 6 months into the bottle) but it's also nice to hoard one too :)"
"O: A. I really like this one. I think this is a staple for the sour arena, even though I am a rookie with them at this point."
"O - As far as the style it is one of the best that is relatively easy to find. The price can be a sting and the sourness is definitely above average"
"O - Very good Kriek that I really enjoyed and will definitely get again."
"O-A good, not great lambic. I prefer Cantillon and Hannsens's Krieks."
"Overall: Quite possibly the worst smelling beer I've ever smelt, yet one of the best tasting. Perfectly sour, with just the right amount of cherry flavor coming through."
"O - Overall, this is an excellent kriek. While I probably prefer Cantillon's, this one is more accessible and almost just as good. Very well done."
"This was a scrutinous review. I enjoy this beer and would gladly have it again. I will try aging the other bottle and re-review in a couple."
"A delightful beer that is sure to get even better as time and my cool, dark cellar work magic."
"O- great beer, a classic in the style. Can't go wrong with this."
"The body is medium and the carbonation is soft. It finises kind of dry. Overall another hit from Drie Fonteinen. Awesome cherry flavor here."
"Notes: A five year-old Lambic that has aged to perfection. This beer is a work of art. It is everything it should be. I'm glad I didn't let it go much longer, because this beer is what I believe to be at its peak. Outstanding stuff, and wish I had more."
"D/O - pretty dark drinkable. It's sour, but not puckeringly sour. A good beer to give to wine drinkers - the feel on the palate towards the end really reminds me of wine. I'd definitely have another, but I do love this style. Great for a warm summer evening."
"overall this was just what the doctor ordered and really nicely done."
"O: Oude Kriek is simple but sophisticated. Delicious and drinkable, Wadsey needs more. "
"Overall I would say that this is a splendid beer but the price tag does not really match the quality. I feel that I have had many better kriek beers than this."
"Pours a deep red color with a small-ish pink head that leaves a pretty pink lace on the glass. The aroma is tons of sour cherries, a bit of dirty laundry, some earthy tones, and some horseblanket. The flavor is very sour with a clean woodiness and loads of sour cherry flavor. The beer is very dry and very tart with a cork-like and earthy character in the finish."
"Overall: Another near perfect beer from Armand!"
"O - A very nice kriek. The smell was a bit off putting, but the taste was pretty pleasant. Not overtly sour, but it is a very funky beer. The brett is strong with this one! I found an early 2005 vintage today so I can't wait to see what an extra 2.5 years does for it."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one surprisingly drinkable in that I kept taking one sip after another while trying to figure out what I was tasting. If I had another bottle it would go in the fridge right now in hopes that I could have a second one this evening. I’ll be putting this one on my shopping list. My overall impression is that this an outstanding beer that is well worth seeking out. I now understand the reasons why the brewer/blender is so highly regarded by so many."
"Overall: A tasty, remarkably sour lambic. Small cherry presence. The flavors mesh well together. Could age for quite some time."
"O- Quality brew, easy drinkability, low carbonation though, not sure if that’s what the beer is supposed to be like, but I was expecting something a little more carbonated. Overall very enjoyable."
"Pours a deep, deep ruby with a massive fluffy pink head. Aroma is filled with tons of sour cherries, barnyard funk, and vanilla. Some slight vinegar characters in the nose, but not overwhelming or offputting. The flavor hits you with a huge sour/sweet cherry, oak, and earthy funk. Very sour beer, but not overly acidic. Finishes dry and musty. Effervescent and prickly on the tongue. Absolutely love this beer, every vintage I have tried has been phenomenal."
"O/D - Very nice little Kriek. Tasty and complex. Not an everyday beer for me but it was nice to try."
"Good, but not remarkable - perhaps aged too long?"
"Update: BA chrispoint was kind enough to share a bottle of the 07 vintage of this beer, and it could hardly have been more different from the 06 reviewed above. From notes: The cork comes out without a pop, and the beer is essentially still, pouring a flat, hazy maroon body. Understated, juicy cherries and clean sourness on the nose. Fairly sweet, slightly tannic, cherry-laden flavors. Tasty, but definitely a step down compared to the brighter 06. A bit of life does show up with tongue action, but more carbonation would have really helped the juicy cherries to pop. 2.5/4.0/4.0/3.5/4.0"
"Overall, this is a solid kriek from one of the best lambic breweries in the world. A great beer if you've got a sweet tooth and love cherry. Quality all the way through. A great example of the style."
"O- A solid kriek that is easy to drink. This is a little sweeter than I would like, but it is not too sweet. I am not sure if I would by this again due to the price tag."
"Pours a semi-opaque crimson red with a small light red head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. All lacing drips back down into the beer on the drink down. Smells fantastic with sour cherries, red wine vinegar, and funk/must. A very mouthwatering sour smell. Taste is fantastic with the sour cherry taste up front and a vinegar and funky must flavor taking over on the finish. There is an acidic twang to this beer in the mouth after each sip. There is a medium to high level of carbonation that is very bubbly and prickly in the mouth. Overall, this is a very good sour cherry lambic that is still super tasty more than 2 years after the bottling date."
"O - Absolutely delicious and worth the buy. I've had few krieks better than this one."
"O - Not bad, but definitely a little underwhelming, this Kriek has little complexity found in others of the same style."
"A perfect kriek."
"D- Extremely drinkable. I wish I would have tried this one sooner but at 11 bucks for a 375ml I cant see myself buying this often."
"O: Yet another awesome kriek. Nowhere near as sour as I like but full of flavor and insanely drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high. Overall I really loved this beer. Full disclosure though, I absolutely love cherries. The cherry flavor it had was really fantastic in my opinion. It showed off some great tart and sour flavors but still managed to have some fruity, cherry sweetness. Very nice beer overall."
"O: It's alright. I sort of like sweeter Krieks more than the really sour ones. I'd still like to try some more though, they seem to be gaining on me."
"Drinkable for sure, not going to kick your ass - even my wife liked it. Perfect for the occasion, you're not going to regret buying this one."
"Drinkability- The first few sips were extremely sour, but I adapted to it quickly. This one definately stuck to my tongue after drinking."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. pretty good cherry character. nice depth. a bit sour, but good."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. A real solid kriek, hits all the right spots. Thanks Russ!"
"Drinkability: I like it, but its too oaky, not too funky, and not carbonated enough."
"This was, IMHO; a very nice kriek, not the sweet soda like stuff you often get."
"As an apart if or dessert beer, this one could really shine. An excellently crafted beer."
"Drink- These weird Belgian beers are starting to grow on me. This was pretty damn good."
"Drinkability is surprising. It's not sour enough to turn me off and the cherry flavors mesh with the lambic funk/sour incredibly well. Could drink this like water if it was available from a tap. Very good kriek."
"2009 vintage Poured into a Rodenbach glass, deep purple red and clear. Not much head sits atop this beer, but what is there is white and produces the faintest lacing. Smells like sour cherry, brown sugar, acetic acid, and light funky barnyard brett. Taste is big sour cherry pie, pie crust, and graham cracker. Nicely dry, with just a hint of brown sugar sweetness. For a sour they just don't come more drinkable."
"D- I am glad I shared this but wish I hadn't plunked down as much cash as I did for this one. The result may differ for you but I won't be revisiting this one."
"Overall this is a fantastic kriek. I would recommend this kriek to anyone trying to get a good feel for the style. Drinks very well, it's easy going and flavorful. Drie Fonteinen continues to amaze me."
"A really good kriek with plenty of balance and fruit character. This is an example of where you don't need Cantillon style tartness to make a kriek work but it can be done with a bit of finesse. I'm looking forward to searching for some more Drie Fonteinen on my next trip to the US."
"Wow this is a great beer! Everything is in perfect harmony. A real pleasure to drink."
"Usually I opt for Cantillon when in front of a bunch of good Lambic beer, but tonight 3F seemed the better choice. It is difficult to beat the color on fruited Lambics like this. No heading comes up, but the color is a pinkish red, with some hazy hues as well. The cherries in the nose come off sweet yet sour at the same time. Earthy notes can also be detected, with just a tiny hint of funk. The cherry flavor here is sweet at the beginning, and more sour towards the end. It never becomes too sour, but instead remains moderately tart. What I love is that you can really taste the pits of all those cherries, which add a tremendous amount of complexity. Mouthfeel is medium, with very little carbonation, just a small hint. Drinkability is lovely, not too sour and not too sweet. As expected, this is some seriously delicious beer here from 3F. One to sip and savor on special occasions."
"I only rate the drinkability at 4.0 because it was $12.99 and because it is so complex. I was extremely satisfied with just one. An amazing beer made in the traditional style without sugar added. My wife loved it also!!!"
"What a wonderful lambic, good year. This is something I would very much enjoy with fresh fruit maybe even chocalate."
"D - I really like this, but it's so sour it's hard to finish by yourself."
"D: Very easy to drink due to it not being too sour."
"Tasted from 375mL bottle purchased at West Lakeview Liquors, bottled on 14 December, 2007. Pours a cloudy light red that reminds me of some of the darker Cabernet Sauvignon Roses that I have tried. The head starts off large and pink, and slowly recedes to light lace around the edges of the glass. Nose is super sour, acidic, and funky with some barnyard, and the ever-present underlying sweet aroma of Kirsch. This beer is undoubtedly dry starting off with stinging acid and vinegar funk, then moving onto the sour cherry flavor and finishing with a combination of the above with the funky addition of a slight burnt rubber flavor. There is a hint of vanilla oak in the middle as well. The body is light with sparkling acidity and a long, funky, and sour cherry finish. The acidity lingers for quite a long time, causing my mouth to continue watering."
"Very easy to drink-- perhaps not the BEST kriek I've had, but certainly a treat-- and a very very tasty and drinkable beer."
"D: Pretty good all around. This one would of probably done well with a few more years on it as well. As it stands now though, I found it quite refreshing, flavorful and drinkable without too much sweetness."
"Overall, induces mouth-watering sensations just thinking about it. Due to the age of the bottle I wonder how much has been lost versus when only one or two years have gone by. Still an excellent kriek that I would return to repeatedly, particularly a more newly-released version."
"D: A very good kriek. Quite tasty and very drinkable."
"Notes: All about fruit here, even being in the bottle for 3 years. I was expecting some nuttiness or oxidation, but it's bright and lively. Love it. Beats the pants off of most other Kriek's I've had. Really looking forward to the Schaerbeekse I have in waiting."
"This lambic is up there with the Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait, in my opinion. But this one might be my current favorite now. Amazing job, Mr. Debelder."
"If you want a kriek that is not overly fruity this is the lambic for you, very good. An excellent transition for wine drinkers or those wanting to live lambics."
"D. Highly drinkable for a ""fruit beer"". Never turns sweet or cloying. I would like to try this with about 4 to 5 years of age on it."
"12.7 ounce corked and caged bottle, bottled on 12/14/2007. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark red/purple color with a very small pink head that went away quickly. Not much lacing. Aroma is funk, cherries and oak. The first sip was really funky and musty, but after that the funk settled down some and the sour/tart cherry flavor became more noticable. The finish is nice and tart. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, the low carbonaton helps make this brew go down pretty easy. I think this is a good overall brew, it's a fine example of a fruit lambic. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Note: Bottled on March 31, 2009"
"Drinkability: Beautifully complex and balanced. Quite possibly the smoothest wild ale I've ever encountered. Highly recommended!"
"This lambic appears a purple hue with a light pink colored head that leaves good lacing. The aroma if fabulous. It's hard for me to remain unbiased, I must admit, as I get very excited about authentic Belgian fruit lambics. This beer tastes great and is a wonder example of the style. Highly recommended."
"Pours a nice, bright light red color with a slightly-pink head and a bit of lacing. The nose is bright cherries with modest funk and oak. Not too much acidity. The taste is, unfortunately, mostly cherries and not too much of the funk, oak, and acidity I normally really enjoy from Drie Fonteinen. Fairly nice cherry presence and a bit of tartness from them. In the end, this is just too cherry forward without much involved. Will have to get an aged bottle at some point."
"Not as drinkable as others. But I will revisit this again for sure."
"The beer was really nice looking, dark ruby red with a thick pink foam, I swear there was still foam in the glass once I'd finished all the liquid, not only lace but actual head over empty glass bottom. Cherry comes through strongly in the aroma, not far from Cantillon Cuvee Moeder which I'd just had the previous day. Very sweet but not soda-pop sweet, just a whole lot of cherries. Really I could drink this often, no matter how girly it looks, it was just so delicious. If I find myself at the brewery again I'll definitely get at least one glass of this."
"O - I've waited a while to try this, and it wasn't a letdown. Very nice, and makes me want to try more examples of the style for sure."
"Pours a beautiful red that is so dark it even looks like a cherry sitting in my glass. Thin wispy pink head that leaves a delicate ring of light foam around the glass and minimal lacing. Immediately, I smell cherries and oak. Funky/earthy brett and wine-like characteristics are dominant in the nose too. Taste is sour cherries, tart and juicy, coupled with slight bitter flavors. Old oak barrels and brett make up the rest of the taste. No flavors really linger, a very clean flavor profile. Light in body with carbonation that is not high but definitely more than moderate, very appropriate and refreshing. Sweet, tart, acidic and puckering but very refreshing and a beer that I could drink any time and be happy about it."
"Overall, a really exceptional lambic. The flavors are crisp and well blended and the cherries really do stand out. Highly recommended."
"Pours a ruby red/purplish body with pink head that quickly dies and leaves some minor lace and the aroma is simply tart cherries. I pick up a touch of oakiness and some sour, vinous funk but mostly I just get tart cherry. A smooth body with sharp, tart cherry taste for a sour edge and crisp finish. Not overly tart and while it's a light bodied beer w/ not too much in it, it balances well with oak so it doesn't wear on taste buds. A pleasant beer to enjoy w/ or after dinner."
"light to medium body, with acidic and astringent textures. mild to moderate carbonation can be very crisp, but that also helps with a lift in flavors."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable and enjoyable. I will have to send a bottle to my father who loves sour cherries. Reminds me of something I would have in Michigan up near Traverse City. Very good."
"D - Extremely drinkable and will definitely buy more."
"It pours out a deep, dark, cherry red. It has a minimal head but lots of bubbles constantly rising. The aroma is stereotypical Drie Fonteinen. It has that gnarly, musty brett character on top of the lactic sourness. It really shows how each of these lambic producers really have distinct house flavors (not on purpose). The taste is lactic sour balanced nicely against sweetnest from the cherries. As with all great sours, the drinkability is incredible. Great beer."
"The nose definitely detracted from this beer for me. Otherwise it was pretty much spot on."
" At first sip this beer has lively, spritzy carbonation on the tongue. Halfway through the glass the carbonation has all but vanished leaving a mellow, creamy, almost flat brew that's delicious. Very ripe fresh cherries upfront in the taste. Sour, sweettarts-funk, almonds, vanilla-oak flavors. Good sweetness from the fruit, not sugary. Musty-barnyard. Tart and dry but balanced with the cherries. Clean cherry pie, bready finish. Tart and refreshing. Sourness isn't too acidic on the stomach like some lambics. Great musty, sour funk mixing with the fruit. Layers of foam all the way to the bottom of the glass. Can't wait to see how this beer drinks with 4 or 5 years bottle age from the celler. Would drink a lot of this, world class brew."
"Drinkability: Perfect. I could drink quite a lot of this."
"D - Very tasty and low enough ABV. Just don't think I would care to do more than one at a time."
"Very cherry, super tart, face hurting sour. Lip puckering. Very sour, hits in the back of mouth. The cherry flavors are very very nice in this one. Its well balanced with the acetic sour, I really love this beer. Better than the other Fonteinen Kriek lambic in my opinion. I'm going to get some more of this and age them."
"The higher carbonation in this batch tickles the tongue and pronounces the brett a little more. Its fun and interesting to try in this state."
"6%? You must be joking. Dangerously drinkable; not too sweet, not too sour."
"Pouired a cranberry juice red with a half finger of head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was very nice consisting of cherries, oaky barrel barnyard funk, cork, acidic lemons, some brett, and slight vanilla notes in the back ground. You can definitely tell it's gonna have a sour bite. Upfront on the palate the sour cherries do run the show but seem more natural tasting then juice like cherries but has barrel oak funk, citric lemon, slight vinegar, and brett accents. The brew was medium body with good tingly carbonation which had a sweet, sour, and slight dry finish. It drank really good and has to be one of the best krieks I've had in a long time. I honestly like how big the sour punch was and wasnt overly acidic; very well balanced."
"Overall: It's labor day and one of the hottest days we've experience in SF in some time. For me--now--this kriek really hits the spot. Big on flavor, but the acid keeps it feeling light making it seem all the more drinkable in this climate."
"D: This is not the ultra dry complex super Kriek that Cantillon was, but it's still a damn good beer. It's in that Hanssens realm, while still being very traditional, the true fruit flavour shines through. Very tasty, a worth a pick up to try, but I don't know if I'll ever buy it again as it is freakishly expensive, I can buy a 750 of Hanssens for the same price."
"D: One of the most drinkable sours I've had, sourness is well-controlled and taste is well-balanced."
"A very nice beer. I like other lambics better (i.e., Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek), but this is good. I think that it would be better if it was more sour and had a bit more complexity in the taste."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable ,"
"It might just be that I'm really into the sours right now, but yeah, I might have to go back and grab some more since I know they are in short supply."
"Color red blood quite similar to the young red wine. The nose evokes course cherries, in a rather sour, but also the cork and wood. As the body of the beer, it offers hints acids where the tannins show a very nice way and spread in the palace. In the mouth, the taste of cherries is far from being intrusive, it is suggested in much the acidity of the drink and the bitterness of its nuclei. Somewhat soft, it gets dressed in mouth what it loses acidity. Final dry and astringent."
"d - A very nice lambic with some sour and tarty fruit to it. Would try again."
"O: Good but not great. My experience with lambic is limited, but this selection is encouraging."
"Drinkability - just one at a time for me. Otherwise, I'd find myself trying to sneak a little sugar into it. This is one nice offering by Drei Fonteinen."
"This is excellent, and world class. So well balanced between the tart, sour, and acidic cherries and everything else. Everything a fruit Lambic should be. As good as anything that I have had from Cantillon. Something I highly recommend."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a light pink head. The aroma is strong cherry with some vanilla. I get a little funk, but less than in the Schaerbeekse Kriek. The flavor is vanilla, cherries and some tartness. The beer is very dry and doesn't have much funk to it at all, possibly because it is so newly bottled. Medium mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation. Probably not quite as good as the Schaerbeekse Kriek, but if you take into account the price difference, I think this one is the better value."
"December 2007 bottling. Not much of a pop as this is uncorked, but it's not for lack of carbonation. Magenta with light pink head. Nose is laced with tart cherries and a musty funk that foreshadows just how tart this is on the palate. Quite fruity flavor with loads of cherries. Dry and tart, but the funk is restrained. Body is on the medium side with plenty of carbonation. Quite refreshing on a 98 degree day."
"D: Superb. A really nice kriek. Its a little different than the Schaerbeekse Kriek which is a touch more sour and has more distinct cherry flavors. Should keep aging gracefully."
"D-well done brew, lots of things going on working together well, more sweetness to accompany the extremely dry finish would have helped the overall drinkability, but the funk is quite present and well done as the cherry takes a back seat."
"Pours a hazy, dark pink-ish color with a light pink head. In the aroma, tart, dark cherries and a hint of oak. In the taste, a dry small oakiness and a big tart cherry. A sour bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a clean, sour cherry aftertaste. Nice sour, yet not too much. Even with the sour cherries, it is almost a palate cleanser."
"Taste is phenomenal. One of the best sour beers I've ever had, it's so amazing. Tart and fruity and this batch is way better than normal. If you find it, drink it."
"D- Very sour, very funky and loaded with cherries that linger. This is a very good beer but it could become hard to drink. The half sized bottle that I got is just about the right size."
"Cherry flesh and tart skins with moderate tannins and oak in the aroma. The fruit is explosive. I know my opinion is in the minority, but I prefer this to the Schaerbeekse. Less Brett and more fruit. A light and pleasant sweetness is evident in the flavor. Moderately tart and tannic with prominent cherries, cherries, cherries. Strong acetic presence. Vibrant fruit explosiveness."
"Drinkability: tartness builds on the palate which reduces scope for this to be consumed in a session; then again, I can't really imagine consuming any kriek in a session. I love krieks, but there is plenty of pleasure in having just one bottle at a time."
"(D)- A different beer for the style than I am used to. I dont know if this is meant to have such a low carbonation level, but it does. Has much more funk to it than normal, but by no means is it a complaint; just different. A big sipper than took me a good hour or three to finish this guy."
"Overall this is a great-smelling beer although the flavor doesn't quite deliver. Still, a nice beer and I'd have to imagine it would be much better with any semblance of carbonation."
"Wow. Simply put SOUR cherry beer. And very red; red in the head like the dick on a dog. Poured with a deep pink small to medium sized head that mostly subsided and a wee bit a lace. Color is a hazy/cloudy burnt red. Aroma is sour cherry yeast musty. Flavor is like aroma. The tartness totally dominates all of the other flavors. Which are cherries malt yeastoids. Good body and excellent carbonation. *burp* Finish is like flavor. Can't think, off hand, when I'd be in the mood for another of these, despite my score."
"D - This is one of the greatest pleasure to drink. I could drink this by the firkin."
"M&D- Low carbonation overall in the mouthfeel. Good drinkability it went down easily and nicely."
"D: This is a great beer - wonderful flavoring, nice tartness that doesn't make you quite pucker, nice little kick to it. I only wish that I had picked up another bottle."
"Pretty good beer, nothing that really sets it apart or would make me seek it out specifically in the future. This bottle was 1 year old, would like to try one after 3-4 years and see what is going on..."
"DB - Price is nuts ($12/12.7 oz) but it is a great tasting, spontaneously fermented beer! Love the balance of the classic Kriek flavors."
"This is an exceptional brew. Bottled 12/16/06. Not much to look at. A touch of a head and faint traces of carbonation with a lovely purplish hue. No real carbonation to speak of. Smell is much better. A dry sourness and multifaceted complexity. subdued cherries. Peppery grapish fruitiness. A vinous backbone. Burgundy and bread. Oak.. Taste is superb. Much like the nose but the cherries step up a bit and add to the sophistication of the flavor. If this doesn't pucker your mouth nothing will. There is a light vanilla and oaken woodiness that adds to the finish which is super tart and dry. Vinous and clean. Feel is light enough but with a lighter heaviness that betrays. Just the beer for tonight. Easy drinking and classy. The sourness lends itself to meals and a measured approach."
"I'm wondering if this one would be more bracing a little bit fresher...really wanted this to be more sour and tasty..."
"Overall, a very solid Kriek. It is good, but I like Cantillon better. The medicine flavor keeps coming back and it is really bothering me. I dig it. Very expensive, but solid."
"It has a creamier, fuller mouthfeel for the style, without being full bodied. Great beer."
"Drinkability is good, but I want some carbonation in my beer. Glad I got to try it but not something I would seek out again for the price."
"Deep ruby color, thin white head with hints of red. The nose is sweet and tart cherry with oak. Yeah, tart cherry. Cherry shock tarts. Pretty much it. And yet...I am so satisfied with this beer. Wonderful Kriek. Just extremely tart cherry, cherry pixie sticks, deep, rich tart cherry."
"Notes - As mentioned by dyan this beer pushed the cork out as soon as the cage was loose. I was afraid this was going to be a gusher but after the cork flew across the room there was only a little carbonation released from the beer."
"A really nice lambic, nice full fruit with just the right amount of tartness. The body feel was heavier than other lambics, but i kind of enjoyed it. Very solid, not as good as cantillon, but great nonetheless."
"Overall: This beer is quite unique and if you can get past the omnipresent sourness, you won't regret getting it. Not for everyone i gather but i liked it."
"Lots of tartness, lots of fruits just like the 2003. A bit sweeter but not much. Hint of vinegar again. An amazing beer."
"D: Not overly tart or acidic, but definitely enough. I really found this to be close in quality to the Schaerbeekse version, with that one having just a slight edge."
"Would I have 3 of these 375s or 1 750 of the Schaerbeekse Kriek? Undoubtedly the latter, but I'd hedge my bets and cellar a couple of these for 2 years. I'm not a big fan of aged fruit lambics, but I think this could use a little time."
"375 ml bottle, home. The bottle is about 11 months old. This a fantastic beer. It pours a raspberry-mahogany color with a small pink head that dissipates slowly. The aroma is naturally fruity and sweet. There's a big cherry note that borders on raspberry/strawberry jam sweet. The aroma also has a balanced, refined horseblanket funk that's just wonderful. The flavor is fairly dry and medium tart. I haven't had all that many lambics, but this seems quite balanced. There's also a medium acidic vinegar flavor throughout the aroma and flavor. Very nice fruit sour."
"Overall its a good fruit lambic, it is delicate and fruity, but sour enough to interest gueuze fans."
"amazing, this is one of the best sours i have had. the cherry flavor is perfect and blends well. nothing stands out because it is blended so well. amazing. i cannot wait to see what time does to this."
"D: This knocked me out and provided me with a greater appreciation for sours. I could probably drink three of these in a sitting, if only I could afford it. Excellent brew."
"The beer pours a beautiful red color with a thin pink head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an intensely sour, lambic scent with loads of cherries. This is so sour that it makes my nose burn. The taste is damn good as well. It has an intensely sour flavor that goes down easy with some mild cherry notes. The sourness is out of control. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a powerfully enjoyable beer. It has excellent fruit character with one hell of a sour punch."
"Staples Corner Liquors, Crofton Md"
"12.7 ounce bottle poured into tulip. Lot March 31 2009."
"D: An unforgettable brew."
"This is an excellent beer from Drie Fonteinen, and a very accessible fruit lambic."
"D: Pretty challenging. It was only a 375ml bottle, and yet I was very happy I was splitting this with my wife."
"The flavor was in line with the aroma but with an initial flavor of chlorine followed by plastic cherry, funk, oak, and a very reserved cherry flavor. Medium acidity and carbonation level with a semi-dry finish. Quite good but not among the best fruit lambics I've had. Would like to try a fresher example to compare."
"I decided to pair my second glass with some cheese, so I shaved up some Ewephoria (a sheep's milk gouda from Friesland Holland, produced for the U.S. market). The combination was superb, bringing out a little more sweetness in the lambic, and emphasizing the grassy/herb/nut notes of the cheese."
"Drinkability is limited by the strength of the acidity, but make no mistake, this is an excellent Oude Kriek!! Scoring this beer is hard - I always try to score to style, and while the extreme nature is reflected in the lower scored I gave it for some of the category, it is nevertheless what I love about this beer!"
"Funky sour tart intensity up front that is puckering and mouthwatering but also very acidic. Again the sweetness of the cherries are organic and not artificial or syrupy. This sweetness is balanced by the very funky tart notes and the earthy wooden oak."
"D = This is an awesome lambic, but hard to put it high on drinkability given the pucker factor. I will definitely be coming back to this one again though."
"There is so much I love about this beer, most of which is the mix of flavors where I taste something different every sip and how the flavor experience in just one sip can reveal so many changing flavors. I will look for another bottle of this, and if it has a bit more carbonation I will up the scores here, because this is surely a great beer."
"D: Tasty and worth the praise, this is different from other lambics that really concentrate on the sweetness of the brew."
"It is pretty drinkable. It does, however, almost ""burn"" as it travels down into my stomach - it's that acidic."
"T/M: Sharp sourness up front, woody tannins and a big sweet-sour cherry flavor. Leathery and earthy mid-palate, with a sour, dry and lightly tannic finish. Medium-low carbonation. Not as complex or intense as the Schaerbeekse Kriek, but still a great beer."
"Drinkability is good, tasty beer but not otherwordly. Sour and flavorful without being over the top. Cherry comes out enough to really speak without being overly lost in the sour quality as well."
"Insanely good beer! Drie Foneinen has figured this whole Belgian thing out. This Kriek is no different. Holding true to what Krieks are, this beer has a delicate acidity that steers clear from sharpness or astringency. A clean tartness that comes from the cherries are a perfect compliment to the vineous blended lambic base beer. Tartness take the shape of pie cherries, under-rippened berries, crabapples, and malt. That's right, a steady stream of pilsner malts add just enough sweetness, body, and creaminess to buffer the palate from the intensity of the sour beer. A light cork mustiness gives an earthy complextion to the beer from the nose to the finish (despite the synthetic cork). A real surprise is the low-lying carbonation which keeps the acidity from becoming amplified. Still, the beer does not rest heavily on the tongue; rather giving a mellow soothing demeanor to the session. Krieks just don't get better."
"Super sower, not for beginners. The cherry flavor is very nice. Recommended."
"Overall, damn good brew and I would very much recommend for fans of the style."
"Overall a great brew, so long as the sour is what you are looking for..."
"Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek is a solid, sparkling, red beer with a small, frothy, pink head. It has a musty wooden aroma like cherries and barrels. There are champagne notes in the nose. It has a bubbly light body with a lively finish. It is very sour with no sweetness. It's mostly sour cherry and bret. There's a resiny oak flavor that creeps in and the aftertaste is all sour cherry. This sounds silly, but if you toss a little Disaronno in this, it makes a great cocktail."
"I was dying to try a Drie Fonteinen beer ever since I got into lambics, and having this only made me want more."
"Great mouthfeel. Not particularly drinkable."
"smells exquisite, cinnamon, cherry, vanilla, almost smells like cognac, sort of flat and the mouthfeel is flat, taste is nice cherry but the smell is really the winner for this vintage at this point. I could sniff this all damn day."
"I find this style hard to judge not having much experience with it, but I can't say I wanted to stop drinking the beer..."
"Drinkability: A fine fruit lambic, but, in all honesty, it makes me more than wistful for another dose of that Hommage."
"A well done lambic, but I'd stick with Cantillon."
"Notes from and tasted on 12/12/05."
"Drinkability is ""How much sour stuff can you handle?"""
"375mL Lot 01 Bottled Feb. 2005. Pours an orange-red with minimal head. Aroma is tart cherries and wood. Flavor is very sour cherries and wood at first. Finishes very dry and tart. Not very complex, you are overwhelmed by sour cherries with woody undertones. A slight sweetness in there towards the finish but not much else."
"Long, sour finish, but never too anything. Quite mellow. I'm getting the oak, now, too. Very nice. Yum."
"750 mL bottle poured into a St. Bernardus goblet. Body is the color of black cherry skin, with a creamy pink-tan head. Aroma is black cherry yogurt/jam with an acetic sharpness. Flavor is very similar: jammy fruitiness like the chunks of cherry in Yoplait, and an even gueuze sourness for balance. Notes of maple syrup and citric acid. Medium-thin body with medium carbonation. Finish is sour and semi-dry. A nice kriek but probably not worth the $28 price tag."
"I found Drie Fonteinen's Kriek to be unique amongst its fruit-infused lambic brethren. Although I suppose all real Kriek are different from one another as each traditional maker (or in this case 'blender') has their own distinctive style. Mr.Debelder: I like your sense of fashion!"
"Like has been said before drinkable is not a word that I would associate with a sour. This brew is a fine sipper and great on a warm summer day .this brew is a tad expensive so I won't be drinking many of them But I would drink it again"
"D - probably would've been better in hotter weather. As is it was a perfect lunch session brew to jazz up an otherwise regular lunch."
"This kind of beer puts the lie to the kinds of sweeping statement Dulcie is occasionally prone to: ""I don't like Belgians!"" There are such varied styles and this one is way out there. Nice cranberry color and interesting complex, slightly yeasty and currant aroma. On the palate, the sourness is other-worldly. It is reminiscent almost of a very dry Riesling, quite a lot going on in the glass. I can't give it a high drinkability score since one can only sip it, which is just as well at the price."
"A 12.7oz bottle, bottling date 2/12/05 on the label. Served in a tulip glass, it was a deep red color with a little haze. The head, except for a few bubbles, was nonexistent. It had a cherry aroma with an oaken background. Tart cherry taste. The first few sips were a little too spritzy for me, but then it settled down. Decent beer, but I didn't finish this and think that I wanted another right away."
"Drinkability: Never a beer that I would characterize as highly drinkable, this is nonetheless a very nice middle of the road kriek"
"I'm giving this one all 4s. Its a solid kriek, but the cherries could stand out a bit more in flavor and aroma. The rest of it quite good. I think it is easy to overrate these beers b/c they are so pungent and unique."
"good drinkability. refreshing and clean. good kriek."
"Delicous, so dry and acidic yet very drinkable. Expensive in the US, but worth the money."
"Pours from the bottle a cranberry rose color, with very thin head and a low ring of lace. Gorgeously small carb bubbles rise quick and consistently from the bottom and edges of the glass. The front nose smells of toy plastic - strong, bright and perfumey. Smells like a sweet poly coupled with barnyard manure - earthy, tart, very sour and lactic. Incredibly full and complex. The front taste is straight tart, front to back. Light tart and crisp middle with notes of cherry, crab apple and unripe pear. Airy in the middle like the Spring. Overall, very bright with strong cranberry characters. Mouthfeel is very dry with a light to medium body. Could definitely sip on this one for a while"
"D: Refreshingly tart but not overpowering. Very drinkable."
"Excellent."
"Nice ruby red color, but no head at all. The smell is loaded with tart cherries and oak, it is also acidic and the horse blanket is lower than in others, but I prefer it this way. Taste is acidic right off the bat, tart cherries and oak are blended nicely with some horse blanket coming through in the finish. This one had very low carbonation and the mouthfeel was medium bodied, with the finish being somewhat dry. This one was pretty good, and I'd say taste is higher than 4, but I can't give a 4.5. I also can't say I'll be getting this again as it's just not worth the extremely high price I have to pay to get it."
"I'm intrigued, and will have to try the Schaerbeekse Kriek for comparison."
"D- I this is a great lambic. Yeah I have had some better but this is up there."
"So, take my review for what it's worth."
"December 2005 bottling. Pours a mostly clear ruby body with no head and no lacing. Very still. Aroma of old oak logs, tart cherries, vinegar, and barnyard. Mouthfeel barely has carbonation. Taste is tart and acidic, vinegary. Very funky, with a geuze character. Very oaky and outdoorsy. No sweetness at all. Not like the sweet krieks I'm used to. Very interesting lambic."
"Pours a wonderful looking ruby red with a nice head, but lacing. The smell like a strong flavor of horse blanket and that's it. The taste isn't very tart, just a light sour, slightly fruity flavor with dominate horse blanket. The most horse blanket I have ever had in a beer before. The body is very light as well. The mouthfeel is nice, there's nothing bad about that. Overall drinkability isn't that high, but I would try again if I was in a Belgian mood and it was the best option."
"This is a kick ass Kriek. Its not as funky as Cantillon but much fruitier. Its just as sour but in a more focused, less harsh way. Truly a wonder to behold and prerequisite tasting for any lambic lover."
"Mouthfeel is sweet up front, quickly becoming tart, and running along the sides of the tongue."
"Overall: A nice fruit lambic, not the most sour or funky, but it has enough of those elements to balance the fruit nicely."
"D: Wonderful experience. Not a taste all would enjoy, but I (and my wife, who shared this bottle with me) would love to have more. Would be interested in pairing it with food, as we drank it alone. One limiting factor is high price: $7.99/bottle."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. Date on bottle 26 February 2005."
"Ah, an aggressive sourness grips hold of my mouth as soon as I take my first sip. Completely devoid of any sweetness during my initial sips, this beer is quite dry. Again there are some healthy, woody tannic notes reminiscent of barrels. Joined by just a touch of cherry character, the combination of tannins and fruit make me think of cherry stones and puckering cherry skins that have been stripped of any sweetness. This is just an aggressively sour Lambic. It is not nearly as funky as some, in fact the funkiest that it gets is that plastic-like phenolic note that almost seems a bit like lacquer of some sort. The combination of the astringent wood notes and the sour acidity make for one mouth puckering experience, which I just can't get enough of."
"D - Very easy to drink. Not as puckering or complex as others in the style, but worth trying."
"Beautiful, balanced and drinkable. Taste wild cherries with sourness and astringency. The sourness snaps the palate, but not agressively - more of a love pat. The drying wood waves it's branches around deserving attention. This is a tame banshee: Wild, yes, but civilized. A fine dance partner. She's respectable, and could meet most of my friends. As she warms up she provides enticing sweet nibbles with each sip. Very enjoyable."
"750 ml bottle with a bottled on date of Feb 26, 2005. Bright red with a decent white bubbly cap of foam. Sour cherries and funkiness seem to dominate the aroma. Light sweetness hides in the back. Tart fruits as well as some funky earth notes start off the flavor. Pretty sharp acidic bite but not too much so just lightly puckering. Finishes with a dry sourness. Light in the mouth with good carbonation. Pretty damn easy drinking stuff as it is sour but not overpowering and there is lots of little things going on. Great example of the style."
"750 ml corked bottle. Bottled February 2005. The Oude Kriek has a dark red color with a pink head. The aroma is tart with loads of sour cherries. Tart cherry flavor. Oak is very noticable. Lambic funkiness is kept to a minimum, but there is tons of sour cherry flavor. Finishes with a bitter quinine flavor. Great drinkability. This beer is a little more user friendly than Cantillon's kriek, but this one doesn't lack for flavor at all. A bit expensive, but well worth the price."
"This is a fast finish and the aftertaste is not very pronounced, i would call it sweaty cherry. This is a very pleasant kriek lambic but for complexity it is less than the much older oud beersel kriek i reveiwed earlier. I may try to get some more of this to store."
"conclusion: while not a bad beer, I was so very, very disappointed when comparing with the cask, that I wanted to cry."
"Beautiful cherry milkshake red, lots of lace. Picked up at Premiere Gourmet in Buffalo recently. Creamy mouthfeel, just milkshake, with strawberry, pretty well full mouthfeel. Body is a bit fluffed up. Very tasty. Late aftertaste of barrel lumber. Alcohol in nose detracts from cherry aroma and taste."
"Bottle: Poured a red color beer with a huge pink foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of sour cherries is dominant as well as oak. Taste is sour as hell with very little sweetness and great tartness. Very refreshing on a hot day and appreciate the fact that the acidic level is well balance which is not always the case with those Lambic producers."
"Appearance: Bright red, pours fairly clear. No head to speak of. Aroma: Cherry aroma, very stong. Sweet/tartness in back. Flavor: Very strong cherry flavor, including almost cinnamon-like notes from pits. Some lambic flavor, but notably sweetened. Rapid carbonation. Finish: Cherry-nutty finish. Very quenching."
"This Kriek improves immeasurably with age, and is much better at up to 5 years old."
"This was really strange for me, had a real stinky, dirty diaper nose, with a suggetsion of sour cherry. I foiund this to be a bit cloying and syrrupy even. strange taste that was a bit off-putting, very earthy and even a bit detergenty for some reason, i loved their gueuze, but couldn't really get into this one, still interesting, and on the whole pretty good, i will surely sample another day though."
