"Has an intense raspberry nose with traces of sweet and tart. It pours brilliant brown tinted red with a very effervescent white foam cap that quickly settles down to about a ¼”. The raspberries dominate the palate and the balance of sweet and tart tends towards the sweet making it easy to drink but unremarkable. It is just a little too close to soda pop."

"Overall - Very Good beer."

"I don't really like this style of sweet lambic but I had the bottle to cook with. Interesting and not as offputting as I expected."

"Refreshing and balanced Lambic Fruit, not too sweet, nor acid. A bit juicy, but amazingly easy to drink."
"O: Delicious beer. Says it’s the oldest Frambois Lambicus in the world. Drank April 21 in Kunming China. Got this one here from one of my 2 friends who sells decent imported Belgian beers. I haven’t seen this beer elsewhere in the world, even dare I say Belgium that I can remember. I think its great, but after having Cantillon I know this has sugar added. Certainly not as much as Lindemans, which is more commonly found here."

"a nicely done fruit beer, but in the context of other belgian framboise types, its a step below the best. pink in color, almost as much so as the label, and very well carbonated. the berries lend more sugar than tartness in this incarnation, but there is plenty of both elements and just enough acid to cut the sugar. good use of fruit. pale wheat malt almost isnt quite enough of a base for this, as the fruits are really all you can taste or smell, and the yeast is similarly uneventful. if you are a lover of a well done fruity beer, this could be your choice, but for me i am missing the other beer elements, and the snappy dryness of the best versions. great carbonation though and with such a low alcohol content, this is a very sessionable brew, more of a summer thing for me, but a tasty raspberry jam offering from timmermans."

"the beer purists might mark it down for it's softdrink like taste but I think it's great. Full of raspberry goodness, it's a nice contrast to the majority of hop filled beers (which I greatly enjoy) on the market. A great beer to share with friends as it caters for most tastes"

"Pours a hazy light red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and raspberry aromas. Taste is much the same with raspberry juice and raspberry syrup flavors on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is decent but is more juice-like in my opinion."
"Overall this is a nice Lambic. Very different from what I was expecting. Nothing special to seek out but I would definitely drink again."

"O- if you're someone who is trying to explore the world of lambics/guezes, then this is worth a try at least once. It is not bad. I wouldn't necessarily go out and look for this again. A little too ""candied"" for my personal taste. I've had better, more ""traditional"" lambics, although Timmermans holds the distinction of the oldest lambic brewery in the world. For an offering that is so heavy on fruity sweetness, I think Lindemans is a safer bet, and there's also Cantillon, if you're a connoisseur that knows where to look. Positives are that it's refreshing and full of flavor while maintaining a light body. A nice relaxer after a day at work and mowing the lawn in the hot summer sun. Would maybe pair this with a chocolate dessert."

"O: As far as lambics go this is one of the best."
""
"My 250ml bottle was a nice dessert after dinner. Wouldn't drink a second one though."
"The Timmermans Framboise Lambic was a light and refreshing beer. It had a pink appearance and was murky. The aroma smelled like fresh strawberries. The mouth-feel was very light and easy to drink. It had a very light and fruity(strawberry) taste which was very refreshing."
""

""

"Presentation: Packaged in an eleven point two ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a Limdeman's Lambic flute."
""
"O- This has a nice real fruit flavor but the sweetness just overpowers this fruit beer. There is a bit of tartness from the raspberries but it is not enough. The fruit really gets to syrupy and a bit artificial in the after taste. It’s tough to get through this bottle."
"This is my first ever Lambic, and I'm definitely interested to try more. I found it to be tasty and enticing to my palate."
"The flavor is quite sweet. There's no sourness that one would typical expect in the style. It tastes good, but like a raspberry filled cookie. The body is rich and the carbonation is very low. It has a bit of a soda feel to the liquid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink as it is not overly sweet or syrupy but not the greatest example of the style - there are others that are less sweet and a little more natural tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, kind of sweet without much acid or any hint of funk and so forth. It's a fruity sweet brew, but probably just a little bit better than the average I'd say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a middle-of-the-road raspberry beer. It doesn't have the full complexity I like in a lambic, and it's rather sweet. Decent, but not great."
""

"Bottled 01/25/11! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller stemmed tulip. Poured ruby red with a two finger pinkish head that subsided to a half finger quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, raspberry, earth, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, strawberry, cream, sugar, and subtle earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The fruit profile on this one is the start of the show as it should be for this style. This made this one very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. The aroma was the only downside on this one as the earthy tone I picked up on was the true dominant factor. Definitely a very nice brew that I was glad I was able to find and try."
"M. Highly fizzy and carbonated soda pop texture to this one. Tons of fizzy bubbles dance on the tongue, to the point of distraction. Not really worth the money I spent on this one, unfortunately."
"Overall: This was fun to drink but I feel that I will seeking out more complex lambics in the future."
""
"Taste is lightly sweet-tart raspberry, hints of underlying lambic yeasty character. It's not great, but its good, enjoyable, and with just enough of a hint of complexity and lambic rusticness under the fruit to maintain interest and provide somewhat more well-rounded character than many, which are sometimes too fruity and sweet."
"Overall a tasty Framboise that favors sour over sweet."
""
""
""
"I really haven't had much from the style but I will say, while not being terrible, I will not drink this one again."
"Rather a let down; not a terrible beer, but one of the weaker versions of the style (even Lindemans' offerings are significantly more complex)."
"Pours a reddish color, pink head and little lace. Aroma of raspberries, sweet puree, and a touch of lambic quality. In the taste, bitter raspberry, mildly funky, and finishes tart, quite sweet and dry. Raspberry lambic beer with a small sour and loads of sweetness. Overall, a decent brew, went well with a waffle for breakfast."
"O: Was expecting more of a sour here. It isn't a bad tasting beer, but it isn't great either."
"Poured out with a rad looking cody to it, almost purple with a pink fizzy head on top. The smell of the beer was a little funky and tart but mostly very sweet smelling. The taste of this has a light tartness in the beginning that fades into a sugary sweet raspberry flavor. The mouthfeel is a little like soda to me. Overall it's a decent brew in my opinion. Could be better though."
"Very much like a fermented lemonade, not the perky lambic feeling I enjoy."
"A beer disguised as cherry 7-Up."
"Fuck the C- reviews. If you like fruit beers, give this one a try."
"This is a pretty decent, albeit slightly undercarbonated, raspberry soda with a dash of alcohol thrown in for good times and such. However, as a raspberry soda, it is rather overpriced, and not of good value. In all seriousness, this is over-sweetened and so devoid of complexity, that it cannot fairly be called a lambic."
"I would partake in a second bottle without hesitation. Sweetened lambics — a guilty pleasure. €12 at Kulminator. "
"O: Sugary, sweet, and too highly carbonated. Not a very good or traditional lambic."
"o - if i drank even 2 of these id most likely wake of with a massive hangover from the amount of sugar thats probably in these things. it reminds me of any commercial sugar/energy drink and alcohol product. nothing tasty. kinda a girly drink a little.. but that might be why the can and bottle were bright fucking pink. well then.."
"If you're looking for a more authentic version, look for Oud Beersel, Cantillon, Drei Fonteneine, Boon, or elsewhere."
"O: Decent enough beer to try out. Haven't had too much experience with Lambics. I would drink this again."
"It's pretty, nice head and lacing. This beer is sour as all get out. Fruity, but there's also a bitterness that takes a good hold of the palate. Light mouthfeel and ample carbonation. As with many other lambics and fruit/veg beers, before or after a meal is where this one belongs."
"Overall, pretty damn tasty and im glad my girlfriend let me try some!"
"I cannot really consider this a lambic, as the aroma and flavor are entirely fruit-juicy. Raspberry juice, not terribly sweet or tart, but slightly carbonated, is all that this beer is evocative of. Decidely non-beery, however, it is a refreshing fruit malt beverage, so I can drink it."
"Pours a clean deep reddish color, with a pink head. In the aroma, dry and tart sugary raspberry. In the taste, small tart to sugary raspberry, and a bit syrupy. A sour like bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, sugary fruity raspberry in the aftertaste. Too syrupy, more sugary than sour, almost too Americanized."
"A summer drink for the women, but I enjoyed it nonetheless being the bear of a man I am... may be a lie."
"A nice change of pace. Just not as well-rounded as a Lindeman's. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Overall: Well, I'm a little torn -- it tastes really good, but it doesn't bring any of the expected funk element to the lambic like I was hoping. Super flavorful, and a bit like drinking a real sugary and over flavored soda, it was fairly refreshing, but seems to lack the craftsmanship that I appreciate from the brewers of the style that seem to do it so much better. Definitely worth trying though."
"Medium bodied, medium effervescence with a fairly clean finish which kind of annoys me. More aftertaste is desired. Decent but not to the level of Lindemans."
"D - Really drinkable. A lot sweeter than I'd like though. Reminds me of Lindeman's fruit beers. If you like those you'd probablly like this, I wouldn't mind drinking this again but wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it unless I had a serious sweet tooth. Really gets dinged for using the term ""lambic"" and not really being one."
"D- This was average. I would base all framboise off this one now that I have had it. Not at all what I was looking for and a little less than what I had hoped for."
"Overall, a nice little brew. Worth trying if you see it."
"A sweet lambic for sure. Not much, if any, funk or sour flavors. Feels and tastes a tad watery."
"definitely won't try this again. I prefer more authentic lambics. Lindemans is about the lowest quality i'll go with a lambic and this is way lower. Too damn sweet."
"D: The beer is easy to drink and the moderate amount of carbonation prevents the sweetness from feeling syrupy on the palate. I'm not sure if I would try this one again because there are fruit lambics that do not taste as one dimensional and overly sweet."
"Drinkability: It seems almost as if you were drinking a soda, which can be attributed to the syrupy mouthfeel and apparent carbonation. The raspberry flavoring is strong, but not entirely overpowering."
"D: Just boring. Nothing offensive about this beer, but no reason to come back."
"Poured a clear cranberry in color with a medium sized light pink head that was mostly lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of course heavy with the scent of raspberry's, light bread malts and a sweet yeast. It tasted sweet a loaded with raspberry at first then moved to sweet-sour raspberry flavor at the end with the flavor only staying on the tastebuds a short time. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall a nice and refreshing Lambic."
"D: This is probably the sweetest ""beer"" that I've come across by a large margin. Not a traditional lambic by any stretch of the imagination and probably too sweet even to be called a fruit beer. If you like excessively sweet fruit soda, this is right up your alley, otherwise, avoid at all costs. My Cantillon glass almost feels tainted by this one."
"Dark red body, pillowy pink head leaves a fair amount of lace. Raspberry scent, kind of sour. Taste is pretty much all raspberry, pretty sour. A bit of yeast note. Very sharp on the tongue, thin bodied and wet. Not really horrible, but not particularly complex. Kinda tastes like a fruit soda."
"The taste is lightly tart and not over-the-top sweet. Has a nice biscuity base that is a nice departure from the norm for these types of beers. Raspberries are prominent, but not overbearing. I actually think this is a pretty damn good beer, but neither falls in the category of a Cantillon puckering sour nor the sweet, dessert beer lambics...kinda in the middle somewhere. Makes a delicious morning beverage and is soft on the palate. Not exactly ""Belgium's Finest Lambic Beer"" as the label claims, but I certainly am not regretting my purchase and look forward to the kriek version I have in the fridge. Merry Christmas everyone!"
"Poured a reddish purple with translucent ruby highlights that had a thin head and left almost no lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma did have big raspberry notes that were jelly like with tart sweet notes. The taste was also dominated by the raspberries along with the jelly character and tart adidic accents; no funk to speak of. The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, and tart finish. It drank pretty good but was lacking the funky sour punch I expect from traditional lambic beers."
"It tastes like raspberry Jell-O. Not very good, watery, crappy."
"Wow, I'm impressed... so sweet and artificial it makes Lindemans seem like a well-crafted lambic."
"The beer pours a red color with a white head. The aroma is very strong and one dimensional. I get nothing but raspberry. The flavor is more of the same. The beer is very sweet and syrupy and heavy on the raspberry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This may be a traditional lambic, but it has nothing in common flavor or aroma-wise with the better versions of the style."
"Most Timmermans are fruit to a fault and sweet, this is neither and a very poor representation of a fruit beer."
"Certainly better than lindemans so give it a try"
"There is a time and a place for the Lindemans type fruit lambics, but this and the strawberry version is just bad. Way to much fake an artificial flavoring. Avoid."
"A nose with a powerful scent of raspberry suggesting the use of a syrup. It is safe obviously not on this one because the mouth is the same ilk, that is to say strong on the fruity and syrupy but without being saturated with sugar. The lambic is discreet, if not nonexistent, and the omnipresent scent of raspberry."
"D- You can drink it about as easily as Kool-Aid. The alcohol isn't overpowering but it's still there so you have to be pretty responsible with this one."
"Loved this lambic! And it is a lambic, so it's not supposed to taste like a traditional beer. Beautiful color and nice white head that lasted a while. Perfect balance of fizziness and smoothness. Raspberry flavor and smell were fresh, not artificial, like many lambics. Very nice tartness to break up the sweetness. Clean finish. Could drink this one all night."
"It appeared much like a wheat beer overloaded with raspberry juice might look... like soda pop with a bright fizzy head that after a few minutes reduced to a thin lace. The aroma was very very sweet raspberry and had some artificial characteristics... almost medicinal. The taste was worse, like raspberry/cherry cough syrup with a very cloying mouthfeel, low carbonation and even hard to swallow. It made my tongue feel funny and slick and made the other things I ate or drank taste differently as well. A poor showing that should never be called a lambic."
"A very drinkable Belgian fruit beer, refreshing, and a nice balance between the tartness of a true lambic and the sickly sweetness of a beer pummelled with fruit syrup. It does perhaps err on the side of sweetness, and it is quite effeminate, but it's undeniably drinkable. I've had far more sickly fruit beers."
"D: If I would be in the mood for a sweet soda and looking for a substitute, I'd definitely go for this one, but as a beer it falls really short. It's to sweet, overly simplistic and quite boring after a while. It's not that it tastes awful or anything, it's just not a good beer. A poor version of the fruit lambic."
"This is pleasantly drinkable, but it's not overwhelmingly good, and to be perfectly, brutally honest, I prefer things that taste like beer. It's just a quirk of mine."
"Quite a fizzy beer but light on the mouth. In all honesty it didn't taste like beer at all. More of a girly beer this one. I don't mind it and could quite easily drink it but its missing a vital part that is beer."
"Overall: I think that my senses were caught unaware and I could only feel the raspberries all over it (aroma, taste and finish). It could be refreshing if not for the huge amount of sugar. In short, a raspberry soft drink. First and last."
"Very interesting results here. Reddish, pinkish, purplish color, transluscent, with little or no head. Smells unpleasant. Weird musty metallic smell is very unappetizing. Tastes very yummy though; good taste kills the smell. Sweet in a raspberry cream sort of way. Raspberries and vanilla. Sweet but more like real fruit than a lot of them. Nice spritz too. Not very tart."
"A fairly solid lambic, but nothin world changing"
"Notes: Their claim of ""Genuine Lambic matured in oak barrels and brewed in the Brussels Region"" just doesn't seem to work. Its missing the depth and complexity of Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus, very one dimensional, and the raspberries are just overpower. I assume that this is just another ""Framboise Lambic"" tailored to the general public."
"A well crafted fruit-lambic: Not too sweet, not artificial."
"Can: Poured a bright pink beer with almost no head. Aroma of flavoured raspberry isnt very enticing. Taste is quite a letdown with some artificial flavour of raspberry covering everything and no tart, sourness or acidity noticeable. This tastes more like a juicy soft drink then beer. There is no way Im going to try something else from those guys unless it is highly rated and praised."
"Bought and drank this one in Barcelona, Spain. Clear, pink, forming a foamy, light pink head with excellent retention and lacing. Carbonation is strong. Mouthfeel is spritzy with a light body. Perfumy aroma of tart raspberries and mildly dusty basement. No discernable hops or other typical fermentation characteristics. Taste is absolutely delicious with tart, sour raspberries, a dry acidity, and a pleasantly dry finish. Hops and malt are delicate and balance the overwhelming raspberries. All the ingredients are in perfect harmony. An overwhelmingly excellent brew."
