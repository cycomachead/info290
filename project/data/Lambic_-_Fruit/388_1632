Flavor is quite simple, very little lambic, hints of leathery brett, strong cherry flesh, cherry juice, moderate carb, smooth feel and drinkable body, with a lightly sour finish.","cpetrone84","Mar 27, 2015"

4.75,9.4,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Unlike most Krieks where the brewer or blender sweatens the finished product up for consumer's tastes, this one does not. You notice the take no prisoners character of this kriek upon opening the bottle as tart funky cherry aromas flow from the bottle. It pours an energetic hazy cherry red and its champagne like head quickly dissipates. This is a very dry, very tart cherry drink with traces of lemon, oak, over ripe fruit, and a hard to define, bitter finish. Refreshing and lives up to the hype.","pat61","Mar 18, 2015"

4.71,8.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Overall: A top drawer Kriek, but then this is a Cantillon after all. Well worth a try - in terms of sourness it's quite a bit tamer than its raspberry sibling, but that's not to say you'll get easy sipping sweetness. You won't. Well worth trying if you can track it down - availability seems to vary wildly. This is up there with Kasteel Rouge as my favourite cherry beer.","interzen","Feb 26, 2015"

4.43,2.1,,,,,,"Bottle at Brasserie Cambrinus while in Bruges. Side by side with Rose de Cambrinus. Pours deep red color with a pink half finger head. Aroma of tart cherries, wheat malts, a bit of oak. Flavor follows with big cherry, though not overly sweet, with perfect tartness, and some vanilla coming through as well. Medium dry on the palate, light plus bodied, plenty of carbonation. My first time having this one and I think I light like it better then the LP Kriek. Awesome stuff!","BMMillsy","Sep 01, 2014"

The oak manages to round all of the corners perfectly together, especially the cherries which take on a much darker profile then I expected.  A truly wonderful experience.","KFBR392","Aug 21, 2014"

4.33,-0.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"i have no idea if the ratings will reflect this or not, but while i was drinking this, i kept thinking its as good as the lou pepe edition. does it need twice the fruit or another year? i dont think so at all. this is a candy apple red pour, maybe a touch pinker, but really blood stained red, clear though, and with about a half inch of just tainted pink white head. it smells like candied cherries, not really fresh fruit, but not due to artificial sugar or anything, it think its more a product of the lambic base, which is tart as hell, a lot like the classic gueuze really, farmy and funked to high heaven, with a subtle barrel profile. good acidity on the palate, not overdone in the slightest, with the cherry getting more and more intense as the beer warms. wishing for nothing, i find this supremely delicious, and while it may not be as complex or as natural cherry flavored as the lou pepe version, i find it cleaner, equally tasty, and a little more blonde sour basey than its big brother. carbonation is on point, uncommon is real lambic, and frankly just freaking awesome. i find myself drinking it way too fast, but thats just the sign of killer beer. not the best ive had from cantillon, but on par in terms of quality with any of them.","StonedTrippin","May 27, 2014"

The beer isn't overly sweet like some fruited lambics I've had and while it isn't quite as fruity as the Lou Pepe beers it still has a nice presence + balance. Definitely one of my favorite krieks out there and I wish I could drink this on a regular basis.","jaasen64","May 13, 2014"

I did pour very slow because this is my first Cantillon lambic and I wanted to savor every second. It smells of sour cherries. There is nothing artificial hitting the senses. You can smell the wood barrels that this.kriek was aged in. I pleasant funk dominates the palate and by holding it in your mouth for a few seconds you can feel the flavor evolve from sour to earthly with the cherries making their presence known throughout. A good.amount of carbonation and a well balanced mouth feel. Overall, this is the best lambic I have had to date. If it wasn't so hard to get, I would buy more. Absolutely outstanding...","tbryan5","Nov 01, 2013"

The aroma is a nice musty, tart cherry with a solid amount of acidity. The taste is beautiful, providing layers of yeast, tart cherry, oak, and lactic acid. It's a very bright and crisp beer. The aftertaste is a thing of beauty, with a lingering delicate tart cherry skin flavor hanging out for quite some time. Basically - if you like fruit beers, you absolutely have to try this. Cantillon Kriek and New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red are easily the best two cherry beers on the market, and each represent a different side of the coin - sweetness for the New Glarus and tartness for the Cantillon.","shand","Apr 30, 2013"

Fortunately the beer drinks just as gentle, except for a wickedly underestimated sourness. The mouthfeel is spot on with enough fruit sweetness and body to balance out the dry, sour aftertaste. Perfect beer to pair with a rich chocolaty dessert like I have as it cleanses the palate with each sip and complements the already booze-infused cherries in the dessert.","ThePorterSorter","Nov 02, 2012"

Poured a deep dark ruby red with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour, funk, tart cherry, and diaper. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart cherry, funk, sour, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Just for the record, I love this brew. I opted to review this one on a fresher bottle as I have had an ’03 vintage of this before in the past and it was absolutely crazy how sour/tart it had turned. This one really allowed the cherry and funk to shine throughout each sip. Really well balanced on sweetness from the fruit and the tartness going on. I would suggest anyone try this one at least once, but I wouldn’t make it my first sour as depending on the age it could be quite overwhelming for some.","thagr81us","Oct 18, 2012"

This is a recent vintage so the cherries really stand out with an almost dessert/pie like flavor but the sweetness is excellently balanced by earthy barnyard funk, dry oak and acetic vinegar. Very dry and tart throughout with earthy oak, lactic and acetic funk, and a lingering vinegar-like flavor in the finish that has me salivating for more. Aggressively sour but never too harsh or solvent like because of the freshness of the fruit. Again, I'm picking up the skin and pit of the fruit which adds complexity while complimenting the sour, earthy funk flavors. Not a beginner sour/Lambic but I find it delicious and pretty easy to drink.","corby112","Oct 18, 2012"

Nose is tart cherries, grapes, plums and sour fruits and just a slight hint of something woody. The taste is super tart, sour cherries, red grapes, pears, raspberries all rounded out with a very effervescent kick. The extreme carbonation fades out and leaves notes of tart cherry juice sitting on the tongue. Originally I thought I'd prefer this over the raspberry Cantillon I bought at the same time but I actually think I may have liked the Rose de Gambrinus slightly better. This is still a great lambic and it satisfies the craving I had for a sour ever since I had Gueze Fond at dinner.

As would be guessed, the taste is pretty much full-blown cherries up front, some tartness, some sweetness, with slighter undertones of barnyard funk, acetic and citric acids.

I would have expected more cherry than this. Not sugary as the other ones I tasted in the past. Tart but so easy to drink. This is what surprise me from this brewery.

4.32,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"500th review! 750 ml bottle into tulip, bottled Aug 28 2007. Pours fairly clear blood red color with a minimal thin red head with surprising retention. As I swirl it small bubbles slowly cascade to the top. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big sour and tart cherries, cider vinegar, wet hay, funk, oak, yeast spices, and big acidity. Fantastic aromas with great strength. Taste of big tart cherries, light cider vinegar, hay, barnyard funk, oak, and light yeast spices. Extremely tart cherry finish, that turns into a puckering sour acidity after the finish that lasts on the back of the tongue. Lingering notes of cherry, cider vinegar, oak, and light spiciness on the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel as I was expecting. High acidity limits the drinkability, but this is incredibly enjoyable to sip on. Alcohol is completely hidden as expected. Overall this is an outstanding Kriek lambic with a ton of great tart cherry flavor. If it had more carbonation it probably would have scored even higher.","superspak","Dec 17, 2011"

Nose has some sour cherry, mild chlorophenols and some typical, but somewhat subdued Cantillon funk. Tastes of more sour cherries, akin to an amped up handful of Sour Patch kids. Some oak, really funky and complex. Sour as hell mouthfeel, extremely high pucker-inducing capabilities. Drying and cleaning mouthfeel, a pseudo-palate cleanser, borders on palate shredder. A great lambic, very tasty and appetizing. Gets me pumped to try the Lou Pepe Kriek at some point.","liamt07","Nov 22, 2011"

It pours a medium bodied cloudy cherry pie red in color with a slightly pink lacing around the glass. The nose is pure funk with barely any fruit at all. You can still tell its cherry but the fruit is no longer fresh and vibrant. The flavors too are pure sourness, funk, bacteria, and acidic. It strips the enamel off my teeth. It's very good and is one agressive drinker. It leaves your mouth desiring more and more cherry. This is a premium Kriek and a great beer to try.","aasher","Oct 16, 2011"
4.27,-1.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5," This is the freshest Cantillon Kriek I've had to date. All the Cantillon krieks and Rose de Gambrinus I've had, have been 2-6 years in bottle age and I much prefer this younger fresh versions. The fruit is much more prounced and the acidity is total in balance with the beer. Though it was only a 375ml It never became harsh on the stomach. I feel I coulda easily drank a 750ml of this fresh on my own. With or without food, amazing.","CashMoneyVagrant","Oct 15, 2011"

4.29,-1.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Cantillion Kriek pours a spot on solid cherry color. There's just a wispy crown of rose tinged foam that shows a little bit of staying power, but is a bit lacking in the lacing department. The nose is very interesting, it's a fairly even blend of earthy brett funk, notes of oak/wood, and a definite sour cherry aroma. The flavor dials up the sour, and the cherries are a little bit more prominent as well. It tastes like a soured beer with cherries, as opposed to what came across as just slightly tart cherry in the nose. The notes of earth and wood from the aroma carry through from the aroma and fill out the beer nicely. The mouthfeel feels pretty much identical to the Rose de Gambrinus I just had. The body is very dried out, and the carbonation is active, though stops a bit short of being truly bubbly. In general I prefer beers made with rasperries to ones with cherries, but I think I preferred Cantillon Kriek to Rose de Gambrinus, as I think it made much better use of its fruit.","axeman9182","Sep 26, 2011"

However, I couldn't resist ordering my first Cantillon when it was offered on tap here at The Wealth of Riches kickoff event at the Blue Dog in Chalfont. Pours a brilliant, vibrant, yet cloudy rose color with a minimal head. The nose is dominated by vinegar. Only the faintest cherry pushes through. The taste is sour, but seemingly only because of the vinegaresque qualities from the aforementioned nose. I had Raspberry Tart last night, and felt that it was both sweet and sour. This is just sour for the sake of being sour. But that's cool. I get it. Glad I tried it.","Retail1LO","Sep 17, 2011"

4.12,-5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Another winning beer from Cantillon. Could do better if the cherry flavors were amped up just a bit, but this is an excellent fruit lambic and a nice change of pace from others which are either too fake or all too similar.","Mosstrooper","Aug 28, 2011"
4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Brilliant red with a cherry red highlight at the edges. Highly carbonated with a quickly fading pink head. The beer is imbued with sweet cherry flavor, but is much less complex in the funk and acidic qualities than the LP. It's a more simple citric tartness that tastes kind of like plum or grape skin. There only a little brett character in the finish that gives off a bit of a mineral bitterness.","Soonami","Aug 28, 2011"

Pours an extremely bright cherry red with a half a finger head, though it quickly dissipates. When smelling it, it screams of cherry, cherry, cherry, and some more cherry. You can definitely smell the red fruits and the tartness. When tasting, god O' mighty this is soo tart. It almost makes your lips pucker. At the front of your palate, you get cherry, light fruits, and plain of TART. Once that goes away, you get the taste of an absolutely perfect Lambic. Cantillon has really done a number with this one (and with most of their other brews). It still has it's effervescence, and it's just the right amount. I could drink this all day if I could.

Of course, this beer looks much better than my murky mess, and the addition of cherries adds a nice fruity sweetness to the wild, yeasty tartness. Still, the basic flavor and character is very similar to my botched smoked porter. As a result, I have to come to one of two conclusions: (1) Cantillon Kriek tastes only a little better than bad homebrew; or (2) I am capable of making world-class sours (albeit unintentionally).

Those cherries have been eviscerated by brutal sour demons, unleashing a wave of vinegar-tasting blood and offal as they go. Must and cobwebs form pretty quickly on the grisly scene. Yikes. The body (of the beer, that is...gotta get things back on track here...) is light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky feel and finish.

The aroma is a nice mixture between sweet cherry goodness, mild barnyard, medicinal, and sour/tart lemon. The taste is so nice. The cherries are there but not overly sweet but rather give a nice flavor to the otherwise tart/sourness of the beer. Some oak along with barnyard, the medicinal notes in the nose are pretty much nonexistant in the flavor to me. Light mouthfeel that finishes dryly.","kbutler1","Nov 01, 2010"

Honestly, this could be the freshest bottle of Cantillon I've ever had. Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass in almost one pour. This beer is absolutely beautiful. Very possibly the most gorgeous glass of beer I've ever seen. This beer pours a dark crimson rose with a massive pink head that leaves just little lines of pink lacing down the sides of the glass. It really is a pretty beer. Top notch I'd say. The aroma is a mixture of different funks with sour pie cherries. Uric acid lends remnants of litter box. Slight horse blanket mixed with acetic acid. Hints of bright grapefruit and granny apple skins. Raw oak lends a splinter to the flavor profile. Underneath all that funk is just a subtle mixture of fleshy sweet Bing cherries and extremely sour pie cherries. The mouthfeel is refreshing bone dry but not thin.

Color is a bloody orange/grapefruit color, fairly murky, yet clear against light. Head is a light pink, bubbly and light, that quickly fades to a medium thick cap with a splotchy film. The strong aroma is dominated by earthy and musty notes, no room for artificial sweetness, just some mild tart cherry. Otherwise barnyard, earth, funk, must, etc consume the aroma. Flavor begins with a touch of deceptive tart cherry fruitiness before deceptively and monotonically increasing in sour funk, by the finish turning your mouth inside out and leaving you salivating from the dryness. Mouthfeel is soft, lightly carbonated with an endlessly lasting sour finish. Ridiculously sour, but still with some interesting real fruit undertones and musty, funky earthiness.

Poured the color of pomegranate with a semi-hazy clarity. A half inch, loose, off-white head quickly dissipated into a skim - no lacing on this one. Clusters of bubbles adhered to the sides of the glass and sizzled and effervesced in solution. The nose screams tart - cork, choke cherries, a musty quality and a hint of citric acid. Taste consistent with nose; however the cherries are masked by the citrus acidity and expresses itself as salty in the mouth. Mouthfeel is light-medium, but closer to light, while a lively carbonation and a bone dry finish. It is so tart that it stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks while it's in the mouth, and keeps going after the swallow. I've had more gueuzes than lambics; however, I found this lambic to be much tarter than most gueuzes I've had the opportunity to try.

Cherry is a more apparent flavor the more this lambic warms. The first taste that hits you is more of a sensation of lactic acid followed by oak and then very very tart cherry flavor. The amount of wheat in the grist is clear when you drink this beer. Obviously not too much hop action. I love the mouthfeel of a lambic, or geuze for that matter. Dry! prickly and super squiky. This lambic would get a higher drinability score but it is just so bracingly sour.

Cantillon Kriek pours out an awesome reddish pink color, with just a tiny amount of lacing for head. The nose is very strong on the cherry presence, with a lot of funk thrown in there as well. The nose is certainly sweeter than I was expecting, giving off some cherry pie like aromas. Once we hit the taste, the sour jumps in, but actually leaves quickly, with the cherry pie coming back for another appearance. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, juicy yet dry, and really very complex. Drinkability is stellar on this Lambic. Some have classified this as one of the most sour beers out there, but right now it is drinking on the tame side.

Splitting it with my better half, poured into wine glasses. Looks and smells pretty much exactly how I thought it would. Pours a hazy red, definitely no light coming through this. A small pink fizzy head stays for a minute but pretty much completely disappears except for a small ring around the edge. Smell is funky, sour berry, oak/wood, chardonnay. Now for the taste. Hits me right off the bat with a sour blast. The cherry taste is great here, it tastes completely natural (as it should). Vinegar, definitely lots of tart and sour funk. Musty, oaky, acidic. Lemon, green apple. Chardonnay if you threw a few warheads in it. Leaves the palate as dry as the Sahara, definitely a sipper, yet refreshing. Very carbonated but the extreme sourness takes the focus off that. Alcohol taste is a joke, not a trace of it, you start to think you're drinking some crazy experimental fruit punch instead of a beer. Opens doors in my mind as to what a beer can actually be. Compare this to a Budweiser! It takes a bit but your body gets used to the sourness. This is still a mouth destroying beast though. Chalky finish. A very enjoyable challenge to drink, and so different from any other beers I've had. Drinkability suffers for the obvious reasons, sourness and price tag. 750ml by myself would be killer.

A very nice experience for fans of highly sour beer. Nice light body, medium carbonation could be spritizer in this bottle.

Smells of funk, sourness, funk, sour fruits and more funk and sour fruits, seems like the typical kriek lambic smell, definitely suitable. The funk seems to die down after a bit and the fruits really shine through. Taste is HUGE sourness followed by a lot of sour fruit, the palate is overwhelmed by this, lemony sourness all the way here. Mouthfeel is thin, some carbonation, more like a wine and a sour tongue feeling dominating the mouth, very harsh but still follows the style.

No carbonation at all, very dry and puckering. Not the most sour beer I have ever tried though. The last third of the bottle is almost undrinkable. It is not the sourness.

A touch of vinegar and acidic wine flavors come through the dry middle. Nice, fresh tart cherry flavor brings up the rear. Mouth puckering and dry. Leaves a nice sweet and sour sugary taste on the lips. Not as much funk on the tongue as there is in the nose. Mellow carbonation, light to medium bodied. This is utterly delicious.

The aroma provokes my salivary glands to jump into 5th gear. Like all Cantillon's offerings, this beer is alive and vibrant. The aroma is deliciously funky with cherries, yeast and general barnyard mustiness. The first taste is expectedly extremely tart. Just an orgy of sour goodness and happy taste buds. In the aftertaste you really pick up the cherries, pits and all. This is very dry with little to no sweetness. With each sip, the tongue builds up a tolerance for the tartness and is more and more able to perceive all the subtle nuances of this fine lambic. Tough to describe, but just know that there is a lot of depth here. The cherry flavor is equally as well rounded as the sourness and they contribute greatly to one another. The carbonation is light on the tongue and provides a nice bite upon swallowing. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I'm sure I will enjoy many more of as long as it's available.","jakon","Oct 09, 2007"

But that's what I like about Cantillon: lambics that taste how they should. Instead of sweet, this taste tells you that you are drinking a lambic.

The palate is nothing short of mouth-puckering, shivering goodness. The cherries burst forth in all of their tart glory here and never let up. This one is NOT one of those soda pop style lambics you can get anywhere ... this is the real deal and my face is contorting to prove it. The moutfeel is slightly biting, acidic and finishes quite dry. A wonderous journey into lambic excellence. Be warned, though ... this isn't a beer for everyone. Like sucking on lemons ...?

Has a musky sour aroma that stands out above the cherries. The cherry aroma mixes in the back with a pungent astringency in the nostrils. Oddly enough, I find that the cherries come out more if you just waft in the aromas rather than stick your nose in the glass. Harsh acidity hits the sides of the tongue firstly which is then followed by huge cherry flavors with their tartness accentuated by the lambic base. Finishes dry but with a hint of sweetness as the acid dies down. The aftertaste leaves only the oak and cherries that hints at some sweetness.

The first taste is an overwhelmingly sour pucker your face flavor. Finishes nice and sweet. Actually tastes a little like raspberry which makes me anticipate tasting the raspberry flavored one all the more. Sort of has a sour starburst like flavor profile, so if you don't like those, stay away. Medium body, a little syrupy to go with the very sweet flavor.

Almost tastes like cherries that have gone horribly bad at some point. This is possibly the most acidic drink I have ever had. Its dryness is beyond compare.

I'm starting to get a taste for these. I've had framboise, gueuze, and now kriek, and I have to say that the gueuze is my favorite. I find the fruit to be a little intrusive and un-beery, though hints of it don't bother me. This is delicious though, and not as overpowering in terms of fruit taste. Nice sour bitter taste, really puckering, even for a true lambic. Sublte cherry flavor. Nice funk aftertaste as well. Very fresh and authentic, no artificial shit. Dry mouthfeel, which is great.

Drinkability: Grows on you with each sip as the palate adjusts to the pure sourness, overall an artform that should be experienced by all serious beer drinkers newcomers beware.","WVbeergeek","Feb 02, 2004"
4.15,-4.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I've tried the kriek from one month old up to over a year old and I have to say that I really prefer the Cantillon fruit beers quite young. They seem to be at their prime between 4 and 8 months from bottling. The fruit character is still quite present and there is a delectable gentle carbonation by this point. Over a year old and you don't get much fruit as the lambic qualities take over more.","GreenCard","Jan 13, 2004"
4.55,4.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Glowing ruby hue with a slight murk. Thin, soapy, but steadfast, strawberry cream colored head leaves wisps of lace. Overripe, juicy cherry with pungent, Penecillium like cheesy must hits the nose initially. Woody, damp cork and vinegar soaked sweatsock hints surface after a deliberation. Intense, yet inviting aromawise. In flavor, sharp acetic tartness coats the palate upfront. Rounded woodiness of an old oak bark like nature ensues, bringing both gentle tannins and subtle vanilla hints. Sweetness is only of trace, apple skin and restrained citric, lemon undertones. Meaty, leathery, enteric underbelly merges with ethereal wild yeast tones to lend a wet horse and saddle impression. ...But it is so good. Well attenuated, bone dry, and parching. Paradoxically thirst inducing and quenching like all top notch lambics. Softens considerably as it breathes, with balmy lactic notes emerging and carrying through the gentle cherry tinged buttermilk finish. A delicious, truly world class lambic. Seemingly more balanced than most. Unparalled in drinkability. I would easily consume at least a gallon of this tart, restorative elixir. Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the delivery!","marc77","Jan 05, 2004"

3.53,-18.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is far from an everyday brew and not too drinkable but it certainly kept you interested. This is my first Cantillon and probably my first ""traditional"" lambic.

4.23,-2.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Served in a nice little Cantillon glass, this pour was decidedly a medium cloudy red. I found the aroma to be of slightly musty cherries. Taste was slightly sour and slightly tart. Definitely not sweetened, but still not so sour or tart that it wasn't refreshing. Very nice beer that I would enjoy having again. pat","PatandDavid","Dec 20, 2003"
4.5,3.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Cantillon Kriek has a sweet cherry nose to it. Not as sour or hard as some of the other Cantillon offerings. This Kriek has a definite cherry skin taste to it, a tannic edge that carries through the finish. As expected from Cantillon this beer is not sweet at all, quite bone dry in fact.","Gueuzedude","Nov 05, 2003"

4.85,11.8,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Deep scarlet color with a durable, bubbly pink head. Lacing is evident down the glass. Nose is truly Cantillon with unparalleled mustiness and eye-watering acidity. Cherries are dominant with additional oak and funky cheese aromas. The naive palate would be overwhelmed with what's to come in the flavor department. Tart, incredibly sour cherries accentuated with oak and a remarkable concentration of acidity set this apart from other fruit lambics. The lack of sugar addition make this authentic in the truly traditional sense. This beer's mouthpuckering ability is unsurpassed. Playfully prickly on the tongue, even at room temperature (the preferred serving temperature), with lingering acidity on the finish leaves the palate thirsting for more. Wonderfully refreshing like a glass of fresh squeezed lemonade on a hot summer day, this is one remarkable Kriek.","Jon","Oct 19, 2003"
4.38,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Though the drink was complicated, the conclusion is simple: Impressive, thirst-inducing, and full of irrepressible character. A far cry from Lindeman's Kriek, this is in the very-tart category of cherry lambics.","nomad","Oct 01, 2003"
4.27,-1.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The cherry flavours come through in that tartness but provide a hint of sweetness without overpowering the woody, earthy flavours of the lambic that forms the base. Once again an example of how Cantillion's spontanious fermentation and use of fresh fruit gives us a beer so different from the Kriek's of say Timmerman or Linderman. Another of the best beers I have tasted...","BenConnery","Sep 23, 2003"
4.27,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Bottled 2001. A huge beer in taste and aroma, this version was an orangish looking liquid that pulled up a quickly gone head and laced from a small ring. The nose is big, having very sour notes and a hint of fruity overtones. The taste is huge - tart to an extreme with strong hints of dark cherry and lasting impressions from the lovely lasting flavors. This is another of the Cantillons made for sipping, not session drinking, and as others have noted it is an acquired taste, though I've never met one with which I'd rather be acquainted. This is beer with an exclamation point - be prepared to deal with it.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 16, 2003"
4.32,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a 375 ml green bottle, it's a nice-looking cross between cranberry and yellow. The head billowed upon pouring but didn't last long. The smell is very sour, with a pronounced citric smell and just a hint of the cherries. It seems to sort of bubble its way over the top of the front part of the tongue-leaving just a trace-until it hits the knockout punch at the back of the mouth. The entire mouth puckers just at the moment the sour cherry taste takes hold, leading to a rare and pleasant drinking experience. To further enhance the experience, it sticks to the lips allowing another dose of sour joy when licking the lips after drinking. It's not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's surprisingly drinkable considering its sourocity. (Yeah, I know it's not a word, but it seemed to work.)","mickeymac","Aug 04, 2003"

Nice, lightly red, very hazy in appearance, with just a thin halo of lace on top. Very sharp, tart aroma. Taste is hugely tanic, very winey like cherry-skin more than, say, cherry-juice. By far the driest lambic I've ever had. Tasty, but very pucker-inducing. A good beer to lure your wine-loving friends with.","mzwolinski","Apr 20, 2003"

A little sweeter than the Gueze from the fruit and little less acidic. Read one of the reviews before mine that mentioned that it smelled off - kind of like vinegar? with some barnyard smells --- but that's the way it should be. Its definitely not like sweet cherry juice like the Lindemanns.","Longstaff","Sep 30, 2002"

More cranberry than cherry.  Substantial body to this beer.  Little moutpucker in finish.  This unsweetened lambic beer does have some residual sweetness deep in it.","Andy","May 24, 2002"

4.58,5.5,3,5,5,4,4,"When you say the word Lambic you can exchange the word Cantillon because Cantillon IS Lambic. You can not get more authentic lambic style beer from anyone. This Kriek is dry, fruity, fizzy, sour, foxy, horse blanket, and earthy. Lots of flavor layers and not for the Lindemen's drinkers. Comparing Lindeman's to Cantillon is like comparing Bert Grant's Imperial Stout to Harvey and Son's Imperial. It may say they are the same style but they are two very different beers.","mattmaples","Oct 06, 2001"
