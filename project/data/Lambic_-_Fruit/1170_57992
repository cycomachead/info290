Not as 'funky' as some, less emphasis on horselblanket and more on tart sour fruit and balance.

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour, subtle funk, passion fruit, persimmon, and slight sour apple. The flavor was of sweet malt, persimmon, tropical fruit, tart, sour, and a very slight funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a solid brew. I really have to say, that I quite enjoyed this one. I have had a lot of these in the series and this one is definitely up there as far as one of my favorites. The persimmon is definitely the star of the show on this one and keeps reminding you of this fact throughout every sip. A really well done brew that should be tried by anyone who likes the style or persimmon. You won't be disappointed.","thagr81us","Dec 07, 2011"

Lots of fruity aromas, peaches, mango, light touch of sour in the nose. There is a tang on the fruits which I am told is the persimmon (never had one). The taste is balanced and subtl, lightly sweet, hints of tang with a faint mineral brett note. There is some spice in the back and a nice level of sourness, not overpowering but adds depth and is balanced wel. The feel is creamy, lively carbonation, rather dry, light crispness in the finish.","cpetrone84","Nov 19, 2011"

4.84,13.9,4,5,5,4,5,"This beer pours a milky, somewhat opaque pear juice washed yellow. It pours smoothly and medium in body. The nose is quite possibly the greatest and freshest nose that I've ever experienced in a beer. The aromas are full of freshly cut fruit, melons, pears, kiwis, slight lactic sourness, and persimmons galore! The freshness is absurd. It is just so luscious and fruit forward. The flavors too of tart juicy melons, persimmons, fresh peaches, with slight funk. It is near perfect. It drinks fresh, sharp, and crisp and goes down well. It's hard to actually sip it because I can't get my nose out of the glass. What a masterpiece! Phenomenal, phenomenal beer.","aasher","Oct 25, 2011"

Taste is first of wood bitterness and a sour fruit. The fruit blends right in with the wood...and I wish the two flavors were segregated more. I can't seem to appreciate the woody flavor here in this lambic. The persimmon is a nice sour fruit flavor...wish it was more dominant. mouthfeel is crisp. A rush of fizz hits the lips so hard you can feel a slight burn from the bubbles popping. It is a pleasant sensation. Overall, nice sourness to it, very drinkable due to the heavy carb, though I feel to much of this would both upset my stomach and overpower my senses...too much oakiness for me.","Preismj","Sep 01, 2011"

Light peppery and spice notes come through as it warms, but the sour funk was so hardcore. The flavor was puckeringly good. Rich fruits and herbal, hoppy, and lightly spiced, hallmarks of a great beer are all over this one.

Aroma of light funk and a sweet smelling fruit, which I'm guessing is the persimmon (I'm not familiar with the fruit). Flavor is very bready and malty with less funk and fruitiness coming out.

4.3,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bottle from 2008. Pours a fairly hazy peach with a large, loud head that recedes to nothing. Much like a berliner weiss, very weird. Nose is soft light fruits, a bit of barnyard, brett, and light sea salt. Kind of a soft orange/lemon in the mouth. Dry oak, lightly tart. Fizzy. Kind of a melon-like sweetness -- I actually eat persimmons fairly often and cook with them, and I can in fact pick them out here. This is more like a soft, spritzy berlinner weiss than a lambic, kind of in the vein of Festina Peche, but more refined and interesting. Little sourness to speak of.

3.95,-7.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Tart and fruity on the tongue, persimmon shines through nicely. It's highly carbonated, excessively so, which thins the body a bit and blurs the flavors slightly. I get an herbal, almost medicinal or aspirin-like flavor mid-palate. Refreshing stuff, very quaffable, we finished the bottle in about 10 minutes and I could have gone for another pour. It's only mildly sour, though quite dry, especially in the finish which does display a bit of oak and tannin. It's a nice thirst-quenching beer, not particularly outstanding in any way but very good.","largadeer","Jul 24, 2010"

Light bodied and soft on the palate, drying quickly leaving traces of oak and Brett in the aftertaste. Spritzy and fruit forward, almost juicy. Very quenching and easy to drink.
