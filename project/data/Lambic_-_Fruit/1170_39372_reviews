"Overall this is an excellent beer. I wish it was a bit less sour so that the strawberry was at the forefront. I would like to try this fresh to see if it's the age that has made this beer so sour."

"This is good, but Upland makes many other products that are less labor intensive and don't cost $27.50 a bottle. Consider this a once or twice a year treat."

"O- Overall this is an excellent lambic.  The sour strawberry is aggressive and is the main character of this brew.  It is nicely balanced with a hint of vinegar, acidic sourness, and bready yeast.  This is my second upland sour, and after years of reading that upland sours are overrated, I did not know what to expect.  I think this brew competes with the best of them.  I would now love to seek out and try more upland sours. The blueberry was kind of a disappointment  but this one is great!"

"O. An excellent lambic and an impressive strawberry fruit beer. This fruit tends to fail in beer more than it succeeds, making this brew even more impressive. What I most like about this one is that it combines sweet, refreshing notes of strawberry with very tart, acidic, funky notes typical of the lambic style. Upland can chalk up another success in its lambic series."

"O - This is my first Upland sour. I am not wholly won over by this one. The funk and the sour eclipse the fruit, leaving the namesake strawberry to play a secondary role. If the balance of the fruit and funk were reversed, and the fruit played top bill while the funk was underlying with highlights, this would be a world-class brew, but as it is I'm not sure I'd seek this one out again."
"Pours a murky reddish-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, strawberry, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with super sour malt, strawberry, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great strawberry aroma and super sour flavors."

"O. Nice but simple."
""
"pours an opaque cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma brings out loads of strawberries, acidity, and moderate funk. Flavor brings out shitloads of strawberry, like a puree or jam, with moderate acidity, and low funk. Huge strawberry jammy notes, without much funk, but without a decent amount of acidity."

"O-Just a tad bit more tart/sour notes would have greatly improved the beer. The strawberries where great but it did have the sour punch to round everything out."

"Overall- Very nice fruit lambic; being the first I've tried from them it's quite delicious and I'd love to try more of Upland's lambics."
""
""
"Overall, a somewhat unusual fruit for a lambic, but it works. Frankly, the natural sour qualities of the strawberry make its flavor somewhat difficult to pick out of the lambic, but once you do, it's delicious!"

"M - medium bodied, relatively drinkable for how fantastically tart/sour it is. Decent carb"
"Overall: This Upland does not get much love(probably due to last batch of strawberry lambic aging poorly), but its by far the best strawberry sour that I have drank. Its really hard to make a sour carry that strawberry flavor really well, but Upland has this one dialed in very well with this new batch of Strawberry Lambic. It really exceeded my expectations, the new batch of Strawberry Lambic will be getting some well deserved attention. My advice on this sour is not to age it at all. This beer is a drink it fresh if you got a bottle of sour beer; I dont see this sour improving with age."
"Pours a hazy pink/reddish blonde with some offwhite head. The body looks just like a strawberry. Beautiful hue. This beer smells like fresh picked strawberries. The nose jumps out of the glass with some tartness but loads of fruit. The ""$6 of strawberries per bottle"" pays off. This beer tastes like fresh picked strawberries that are slightly unripe. Great tartness is completely in balance with the fruit and they play well together. Worthy of a second glass at an event with other great sours. Highly recommend this beer. I can't speak to the other batches, but the current batch is fantastic."

"Aside from only getting to drink half the bottle, a decent sour although far from Upland's best offering."
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep golden orange color with a nice but small bubbly white head that disappears rather quickly. Smells of lemons, old cheese, gym socks and a hint of berry if I strain a bit. Yeah there's some funk in here.The flavor is nice not as harsh as I was expecting. There's a solid dose of lemony tartness prickling the front of the tongue and the strawberry comes through subtly. There's some still a hint of sweet malt a solid funky flavor and a lot of lactic acid. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart acidic mouthfeel. This is quite a nice sour, I'm glad I got to try it."
"Big thanks goes out to aasher for handing this one off to me in our most recent massive in-person trade! Thanks Al! This one was shared during the big Upland sour tasting amongst a large group of BAs! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a hazy orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, strawberry, funk, tart, and diaper (NOW THATâ€™S SOME FUNK!). The flavor was of sweet malt, strawberry, funk, sour, tart, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. Upon smelling this one and picking up on a note of diaper with others in the group agreeing I knew this brew was going to bring the funk. Sure enough, it was rather funky with a nice sweetness from the strawberry to balance it out. A really well put together brew that I would love to drink everyday if possible."
"pour is dark hazy orange and thin bubbly white head. The nose is heavy band aid and plastic. Dusty Brett and seedy strawberry with a light lactic note. The taste is solid, strong seedy strawberry, light band aid, dusty Brett, fairly sour, light lactic note. Assertive carbonation, fairly dry, light body."
""

"O: It's a decent beer, but I'd love to see how a Belgian Lambic brewery would make a strawberry lambic. I think they would do a better job."
"The taste was powerfully sour. Lip puckering sour, wonderful! Fresh strawberries and oak. There was a Sweet-Tarts candy like character in this one. However, there were enough grainy malts to give it a solid core. A nice, bone-dry finish to this one. The mouthfeel was effervescent, with a medium heft to the body. I enjoyed it despite some off notes in the aroma."
""
"Overall really nice, except losing half the bottle in the eruption."
"D - This is pretty solid, but it's one of my least favorite Upland lambics along with Blueberry. and Peach There's more strawberry than I was expecting based on some of the other reviews but it kinds of lacks in complexity."
""
""
"O: Excellent lambic. I am continually impressed by Upland's lambic series. The sour/tartness of this beer is very well balanced by the presence of strawberry. I will buy these whenever possible."
""
"GUSHER!!! After it can be controlled, pours a hazy pinkish orange with no head. Aroma is gross, funk and medicinal/acetone notes. I'm glad I got past the aroma because the taste is pretty good! Funk and strawberries, tart but not crazy. Pretty smooth, not bad but nothing too exciting"

"This beer was what I expected when I traded for it, but it's not something I'm a huge fan of. I liked the Blueberry version from these guys better, but this one may be closer to what the boys at Upland were going for. Glad I tried it, but even more glad I split it."
"Notes: Despite this beers amazing ability to capture the strawberry in all of its glory including the green top, it's a tad-bit one dimensional. The over-flowing was a bit annoying too. But so goes experimentation and I wish them the best of luck and will gladly buy this if I ever see it for sale!"
"The feel is light but the carbonation is just a bit sharp. Overall, not bad here. The aroma could use some work."
"I like his, but it takes some getting used to. The sourness is heavy up front."
"Thanks Baron"
"O - Not bad, but not one I'd probably drink again and would be hesitant to purchase on their next release, although the Upland lambics do seem to get better every batch. As far as strawberry beers go, probably one of the better ones.33"
"(D)- Definitely the most sour of the Uplands I have had so far. Fruit has been quick to disappear, but this sure has already matured into a rather nice sour/oaky example."
"O - Not my favorite of the various lambics. Really muted and not the best I've had from Upland. The explosion of this one was disappointing as well. Slightly above average."
"Bottle. Took the cork off and this foamed up quite a bit, glad I was over the sink and had a glass ready to capture this eruption. Poured into a tulip glass a cloudy, hazed orange amber color with a big fluffy off white head that quickly settles. Muted fruit notes but has some brett floral type notes. I would say the strawberry aroma is mild at best. Light mouthfeel. Light strawberry flavor as well with lemon, wheat, and florals. I was looking for and hoping for this to be a little more strawberry forward but thatâ€™s not what you really get. The wood barrel treatment imparts so earthiness notes as well. Mildly sour overall but not overpowering."
"Overall: funky! A tasty lambic that would be improved if the brewers stepped up the strawberry involvement."
"Bottle shared at Hill Farmstead. Very fruity aroma, strawberries are very present with a nice little funky touch. Fruity sourness nicely balanced with oak and lactic notes. Could have leaned more towards the fruit. Light mouthfeel with lively carbonation. Very good beer, I wish I could try more of their offerings in the future."
"The reveal: Upland Strawberry Lambic. No shit. After drinking more after the reveal I guess I can strain to find some strawberry, but I'm still hard-pressed to find it. Still a good beer in any case!"
"I actually really enjoyed the much maligned Upland Peach. This one is on my naughty list."
"Very dry, very oak and funky in the finish. The Brett b in the finish is super strong, it's mildly sweet with some fruit in the front, mild strawberry flavor. Overall decent but really strong."
"D-Overall im ok that more than half of this went down the drain, as it wasn't very tasteful and really funky tasteing. Im excited to try more, better flavors from Upland as i know other will be better. but the strawberry was dissapointing"
"Bottle opened over the sink - fired two feet into the air. Pours big bubbles into a orangey-pink color with a large head. Smells funky, lactic and a touch medicinal. Not really much of any strawberry in the nose. The taste is funky and sour, but not overly so with just a hint of a strawberry presence. Not really as much as I would like. Moves it way down somewhat easily for a sour. Kind of a let down, but not bad. Mouthfeel is really hugely carbonated as the first sentence elludes to."
"4.0 D: This is pretty tame right now, but it has a good aroma and taste to it. I wish I waited six months longer to open this. I think this will be a much better beer then. In any case, it scratched the sour itch that I caught tonight."
"D: Complicated yet refeshing. Not overly sour and has a low abv. This lambic scores handsomely for drinkability."
"Clean body drink well, but a bit thin in the finish."
"This beer is ok. It is tasty and easy drinking. Is this worth the pricetag? Probably not. Was it fun to try? Yeah."
"Definitely worth trying - I do wonder how this one might develop over the years..."
"D- Good first lambic. Tasted more along the lines as a wild ale though. Would have hoped for a bit more strawberry flavor, but still very good. Can't wait to get some more of their lambics."
"D - Easy drinking"
"d - A very nice lambic; I enjoyed this one a lot. Would like to have again."
"Nice mouthfeel and spritzy carbonation. Pretty smooth, solid but not amazing lambic."
"This is quite drinkable. The nose didn't do a whole lot for me, but the taste was good and the strawberries came through nicely. This is my first Upland lambic and I'm impressed enough to hope a few more come my way. Not quite Cantillon, but a good start."
"Pretty drinkable, considering it's tartness. Time will tell as I work my way through the 750ml bottle on my own."
"D: This one is almost on par with Upland's Raspberry Lambic which has been one of my favorites. Not really a tradition lambic but more of an AWA and a very good one at that. Simple overall but very enjoyable. Worth seeking out!"
"Mediocre drinkability. Too much lightly sulfuric and phenolic character, but the finish leaves me wanting more. Greater than the sum of its parts."
"Edit, a friend said that I was a bit harsh, that perhaps I got a bad bottle. I hope I did. If I ever have this again and its not as bad, I will edit my review."
"Not that high here. This is definitely not worth the 20 dollars spent on this bottle. Relatively hard to get, plus the fact it's my least favorite of the others....I can still easily polish off a bottle by myself but will definitely seek out the other flavors."
"Overall - Not sure what to think about this. On one hand I enjoy the sour nature of it but there's something that just doesn't mesh in the aftertaste. The strawberry flavor tastes almost overripe and artificial. It's not bad, but maybe needs more time in the cellar."
"The taste is also a bit mild with some fruity funk. Sourness is at a pretty low level, and the difference between this and the Peach was quite striking. Mouthfeel was light with might hints of wild character; nothing too exciting. Out of all of them, i think this is the one I'd most prefer to age as it's not drinking all that great right now and could really use some time for the wild character to develop."
"This beer gushed, popped like champagne. The strangest thing was that ALL of the sediment poured out onto the counter instead of staying with the beer, at the bottom. It did unfortunately get all over my pants. I made sure to cover the bottle until it settled itself (just like the '09 Juliet). It eventually poured a murky, dark orange in color with a one finger head that laced the glass. It smells of both sweet and tart strawberries. I like it and I'm almost impressed that it doesn't drink like I've heard it to. Perhaps, like the peach that I know was different from bottle to bottle, that this drinks like a solid independent sour. It's actually pretty good. It has ALOT of barnyard funk and a good amount of both sweet and sour strawberry. I'm surprised I like it so much. So did the puppy, who licked it off the floor. This drinks rather dry and tart, appealingly so. It is rather acidic but it's good in the manner it presents itself. Good beer. If only there were more than 450 bottles of it. It is overly carbonated but Upland did email us about this. I like it. It doesn't deserve the negative rep that I've heard so far. Save it and try it! If you can."
"D - Taste is way better than the aroma (too much funk - never thought I'd be able to say that!). I could easily have more of this. Too bad the bottle was such a gusher - a little disappointing"
"D- This beer was good but like the Peach Lambic was just a vinegar bomb. I didn't mind it but it started to take its toll on my palate mid beer. Upland I think messed up the newest release of this beer and I kind of feel ripped off for the $20 plus tax that this beer cost me to drink."
"Drank from the bottle...Pours a cloudy light brown, with decent retention and lacing...The aroma is distincly strawberry, sweet but not generic a little yeast and oak...The taste is mostly oaked strawberries, its still pretty sweet making it drinkable. Not the best of the lambics I've had to date but decent enough to give a shot."
"This beer appears a hazy shade of yellow, with a little head that fades after a few moments, leaving no lacing. The aroma is just awesome. Delicious strawberry scents amid a great funky, straw, wild yeast smell. The taste follows suit. This is another well-crafted, piquant offering from Upland. The carbonation level is well done, and the overall feel of the beer is really nice. The finish is pleasant, with a lingering tart strawberry aftertaste. I'll be on the lookout for this beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is pretty high for lovers of true fruit lambics. An impressive effort by Upland, better then I expected, I really came to appreciate it as I enjoyed my way through the bottle. A shame this is not more widely available, at least here."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable, incredibly refreshing, and could imagine drinking this one in the sun on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: Strawberry doesn't seem like it's the best beer to infuse a lambic with - it's almost neutrally fruity, when you're using the actual fruit, and I imagine you have to use a lot of strawberries to actually get an effective ""strawberry""-esque note out of the fruit. And, that being said, a lot of these notes weren't strawberry-esque - the yeast (in conjunction with generic fructose, I imagine) contributes lots of other stone fruits. But it was drinkable, low in abv%, and fairly bright and refreshing, even though that's partially the result of a neutral profile. Worth trying, though not a favorite."
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/4"
"BUbbly mouthfeel. Good."
"D: An interesting take on a lambic. The fruit seems to have provided some residual sweetness that I really was not expecting."
"Drinks very well here- wish I knew the ABV"
"M/D - Mouthfeel has a slight bite to it, but the fruit makes it really work out. This is something I'm glad I am I had the opportunity to try."
"My first American made strawberry lambic. The colour was a hazy straw with a small off white head. The aromas was really more like cherries than strawberries. On the palate... did Upland make a label boo-boo?? I swear this is cherry and not strawberry. Nice stuff, but hardly strawberry-like!"
"D: A good beer, very interesting but a bit tangy. Perhaps it's a little too bretty. It's clean yet murky at the same time. Hard to get a grip on."
"ok, this is better (than the raspberry). the clearly identifiable strawberry notes help too."
"Very nice beer. Nothing overpowering about it. Well balanced and highly drinkable. Thanks to sprinkle for the chance to try this one."
"Bottle opens and apple cider tan foam starts to slowly crawl out of the top of the bottle. Pours into the glass with a two finger head that fades quickly leaving a skim with some yeasty chunks. Body is very murky orange and once again resembles fresh apple cider. Nose has a nice bit of sweet tartness, green apple and pixy sticks. With first sip I realize quickly that this beer was better fresher. The sour feel is a bit muted and the yeast is big and thick and carries with it a bit of a medicinal feel. There may be some oxidization going on here. Definitely a musty mouthfeel. Drinkability on this one is relatively poor. This bottle is not the norm."
"D: Very easy drinker. Light strawberry flavor which makes this a lot easier to drink."
"D- This is a great lambic and I would have no problem polishing off a bottle to the head. Not the most complex but good enough for an american version. Not very funky and finishes a bit dry. I can see this going great with many food additions plus being a hit with the ladies."
"Appealing cherry color, properly carbonated, forms a small head mimicking the beer's color. Like the peach lambic, does this really taste/smell like strawberries? Hard to say for sure. It's fruity, there's brett. Maybe they shouldve added more fruit. Low level of sourness- more sweet, but drinkable. Interesting to try but I was expecting better for a lambic made with one of my favorite fruits."
"D= great love this beer. I wish I could find it more. Really impressive taste. Ill be searchin it out again."
"Another nice lambic style by Upland."
"Strange review for me, as overall, I enjoyed this beer much more than the elements of my review would indicate. Perhaps I am not extremely familiar with the style and need to have more of a benchmark. However, I enjoyed the hell out of this beer. Sour but not overly so. Not overly complex, but supremely enjoyable. Very much worth seeking out."
"Pours a foggy gold. Almost no head. Nose is lactic and funky. One sided and not very complex. But hey, it smells like a lambic. Flavor is lactic. Little bit of wood there. Citrus acidity is there, but the acid is not too high. Touch of vanilla. Not overly complex IMO. Fairly biting carbonation. Typical liquid tone. Okay. It's a lambic. Don't really get the strawberry on this, but it's funky like a lambic."
"Bottle courtesy of Radiomg: Poured a cloudy dirty beige color beer with a small bubbly head with almost no retention and no lacing. Aroma of light strawberries with some oak and some funky barnyard notes - this is quite close to the real thing. Taste is also a quite complex mix between some tart notes with oak and some sour strawberries with some funky barnyard notes with a lactic acid finish. Full body with very limited filtration and minimal carbonation. A bit acidic for my taste but very well done nonetheless."
"Overall a very nice sour beer, though I would have liked to try the flavor a little fresher. This was still a more then capable beer that I would never turn down."
"I think this one was much better back in Nov, it wasn't as sour or dry as it is now but the fruit was more potent and the beer less acetic."
"D: I enjoyed the level of sour/tart in this beer, but the fruit taste is nearly abscent. I would have liked a nice blast of strawberry. Guess I will move on to the others and see if I can find any more fruit flavor in them. It's drinkable, but not the most tasty."
"Drinkability- Pretty damned good! The fruitiness is apparent and full of delicious berry goodness. These Upland Lambics may not be 100% true to form but they are very approachable and really very tasty. Really nice stuff. Thanks again Matt!"
"D: I'm enjoying this, thanks Chris!"
"Taste & mouthfeel: More strawberry-like than the nose suggests. Pleasant berry flavors meet a pretty strong undercurrent of acetic acid. The light body, strong carbonation and dryness make for a very drinkable beer all the same. The finish presents some oaky tannins, though they're on the mild side, and the slightest hint of fruity sweetness. Pretty decent stuff."
"It seemed like a good time to crack this. Nice orange color with a good and healthy funk of a smell, barnyard and urine. Easy flavor with a sugary strawberry finish but not what I would call sweet, funky and tart but not sour. I would love to try a bottle of the base lambic used for these beers or maybe one day an Upland gueuze. The carbonation is a little low but still has a nice feel to it."
"My second pour had quite a bit of sediment mixed in by the carbonation as it sat in the bottle. This adds a touch of a yeasty bite to the flavor and a raw, yeasted dough not to the aroma, both of which are not a major player, but contribute to the overall effect of both the nose and flavor. The funkiness of the aroma is much reduced in the flavor (the tartness is much more noticeable in the flavor), but there are some light notes of phenolics, some cotton mouthed mustiness and just a hint of musk. The strawberry character is much more enjoyable than I expected it to be. I am not a big strawberry person, but it definitely adds a nice touch here, especially since it has a fairly soft influence overall."
"Not bad I guess. However, at $16 a bottle, there are much better examples of lambics, with or without strawberries. Based on reviews, this one let me down pretty hard."
"4.0/5"
"Poured from a corked 750ml bottle and served in a tumbler. This beer poured a cloudy, bright orange with some gold highlights and a bubbly head of foam that quickly faded into a ring. The aroma included strong oak and tart strawberries. The flavor was a bit on the sweet side. It was made up of macerated strawberries, oak, and some mild funky notes. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and refreshing. Lightly carbonated. I would have prefered a little more funky sourness, but this was still pretty nice."
"Poured a very fizzy pale yellow with a lot of carbonation and head (near champagne). Good scent, hints of strawberry with a nice sour aroma. Good taste, nice and sour, not overly malty or hoppy, good traces of strawberry, I just wish there was more fruit in both the taste and the aroma. Goes down fine, if a little rough from the carbonation."
"Very good beer."
"Huber Orchard produces some good strawberries by the looks of this brew, Upland was lucky enough to use some of their fruit in this lambic, nice tart lambic that will probably improve even more on that end because of bottle conditioning, would like to drink again once it gets some age under its belt, recommended"
"Poured a hazy golden red color with a medium sized, pinkish white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of brett, wood, light vanilla, and strawberries. Taste was wild yeast, sour, light vanilla, wood, and a pleasant berry finish. Thanks for sharing John!"
"My first from this brewery, thanks Jon for bringing. It was a great changeup in a series of barleywines. In a word, nice. Fruity cloudy colour with significant white head and lace. The nose is decidely strawberry. Easy drinking, medium mouthfeel. Balanced, with oak and a bit of wild yeast notes."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Notes from and taste on 2/8/08"
"This is another great lambic from Upland. The strawberry taste comes in along with the oak and lays on you tongue nicely as it goes down. These Lambics almost leave you wanting more and more after you drink it. I'm not sure if it's the sour tartness or the funk from it. GREAT none the less. It's a shame the total run is only 50 cases a year of each flavor if you're luck enough to get some. The Peach is less it's only 25 cases but this one is worth seeking out and a treat for sure! I had this fresh at the release review is taken from fresh batch!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, prickly, with hay, and barnyard funk standing out to the dry finish."
"Drinkability: Another delightful lambic from the folks at Upland."
"Overall this is a very drinkable and flavorfully brew. The cost is a little much which will probably make it hard for me to pick up another. at 14.99 a bottle I might get another."
"The brewery produced 300 gallons using top fermentation with wild yeast. Conditioned in American white oak casks. Secondary fermentation using whole fruit from Huber Orchards in Starlight, Indiana. This 750 ml corked and capped bottle came from The Keg in Clarksville, Indiana. This brew disembarks from the bottle a slightly hazed golden colored body with a small white head. Active carbonation is apparent in the goblet. A few flecks of spotty lace are left behind. Aroma is sour and acidic with some funky must and strong oak wood tones. Light medium body with a crisp carbonation. Taste is tart and sour, somewhat acidic. Musty oak tones throughout, but the wood is more assertive as it warms. Just a hint of tart strawberries. No added sugars here. Very well done for the style. Rivals many of the better Belgian fruit lambics."
