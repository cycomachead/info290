"Appealing pink appearance with no head. Less sour than the other Upland Lambics I've had."
"Thinking the hype on this one is a pretty dated now. US sours have really come a long way in the last 5 years, both in quality and selection."

"This is my first from Upland and I am impressed.  It's a beautiful pour, color is hazy watermelon pink.  The aroma tells you what you are going to get - sour and cherry.  But it's all good - very clean and balanced.  Looking forward to my next bottle from Upland."

"Palate was mostlly sour with minimal fruit.  Still a nice lambic."

"Really sour (like most of Upland's Lambics), but still detected the cherry.  Very good sour and not just an acid bomb."

"Not as sour as raspberry. Flavor is good!"

"Overall: One of the most sour beers I've ever had. Lots of sour cherry, oak and a little bit of funk as well. I'd still prefer a good Belgian kriek over this, but it's still worth a try."

"Very aggressively sour like most/all Upland lambic-style beers. The color is distinctly cherry, which is quite impressive. Looks like well carbed cherry juice. The smell is mostly tart but not overtly yogurty or too strong. I do get the cherry flavor despite the aggressive tartness from this beer. The flavor is actually quite good for how overtly tart this beer is. Unfortunately, 2 ounces was enough to give me that stomach burn feeling. I just don't understand why these Uplands have to be so aggressive in the sour/tartness. This is the second best I've had after Strawberry."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with fairly low carbonation. A pretty good feel overall. Perhaps could use a little more carbonation. Overall, a nice lambic. Definitely a high level of lacto sourness in this beer with the age. It could be more complex, as for me the cherries did not add anything to the beer other than more tartness. And the vegetal notes did not do it any favors either."

"Bottle poured into an Upland bell tulip, a deep burgundy color, with a full inch of pinkish-purple head, which quickly fizzled down, settling at a mid-sized ringlet; thin lacing on the glass, and a steady stream of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom. Heavy cherry aroma, acidic, lots of lacto tartness, vinegar, red wine. There seem to be mixed reports on this beer, especially in the sourness department, but this bottle at least was VERY sour. Intense blast of tartness in the taste, sour cherries, acetic acid, lemon, tannins, notes of leather, red licorice, and I even picked up a subtle touch of cocoa, strange as it seems. Tart up front, tart in the finish. Medium body, crisp, prickly mouthfeel, and if I didn't say it before: very tart. No problems with this bottle, it's a very good sour overall, though I'm on duty to conquer this whole bottle myself tonight, so I'd better break out the Tums."

"this is supposed to be some pretty special stuff, especially name dropping lambic so casually, and i was pumped to try it, but the experience was a letdown in retrospect. its hazy cherry red, like a ford mustang without the shine, sexy, but soft, pleasant. more carbonation than i am accustomed to in a lambic, which i like. the nose is fruity as anything, jammy, a tad sweet, but tart too, intensely so in fact, lactic and caustic almost, definitely too much to do a bottle alone. i get that from the smell alone. the taste is well fruited, not as authentic as some of its peers, but reasonable on the sugar and candy front. the sourness of this beer is aggressive, almost unnecessary, its punishing and coats the throat with a drying rough sensation like i swallowed one thousand sour patch kids at once. the fruit gets a little more sweet and fake seeming as it warms, but when i focus i can get fresh cherries. the sourness is a distraction from everything else, and the wheat malt base is simply not enough to convey the intended message here. carbonation is enjoyable, but the drying burning mouthfeel is annoying to me, it serves no purpose. a step short of something like motherfunker, but this is not an elite fruited sour in my eyes, still keen to try their kiwi and others, but this was in the B range at best."

"O-I was expecting a lot better, but this beer was extremely sweet while not having much sourness to balance it out."

"Overall it is good, not great, but what do I know? Jeff said, and I quote, ""I'm just gonna drink sours from now on," after having this beer, so that's gotta count for something. I'm gonna tweet that people should read this review. #CherryLambic #Upland #Bulls #BeatTheHeat"

"pour is a hazy mix of tangerine orange and light pink with a dirty hue. Bubbly light tan head. The nose is really nice, tons of funk, cobweb, earthy musk and light mushroom. The fruits are not the focus, some berries and cherry in back. The taste follows the nose, more musky mushroom and some earthy cheese. The cherries are in back, very nice sourness, assertive but not puckering. The body is rather full, moderate carb, probably a touch low, and semi dry finish. Very good, well balanced, and excellent funk. Gets a bit vinegary as it warms and towards the bottom of the bottle."
" Again I see the error of my hoarding, I aged this one a bit too long. Itâ€™s fruitiness and bold cherry flavors have been muted. I have several other, younger lambics from Upland that I will need to review soon."
"Phenomenal cherry sour. I would love to fill my cellar with this stuff."

"Bottle: Poured a light pink color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sour cherries is more powerful then expected with load soft rat and funky notes. Taste is also a mix between some strong tart and sour notes with some fresh tart cherries and loads of funky barnyard notes. Body is fuller then average for style with good carbonation. Interesting example of fruity lambic from the US though while still being very good lacked some balance and was a bit too sour at the end of the day."

"O: I liked this one because I enjoy cherry and it had a great mouthfeel and body, but the Persimmon version still reigns supreme."
"Overall: Its a nice lambic, but its a little over priced at over $20 a bottle. Thats the bottom line. It is a good change up when i am in the mood for something totally different. Wish the cherries were bigger in this beer."
"4.0 D: The cherry is another solid soldier in the Upland lambic lineup. Aside from the appearance, this is solid all around."
"Overall: I honestly enjoyed the aroma and taste of this one. However, the fact that I lost 1/4 of this relatively-expensive bottle from gushing left me feeling short-changed. Upland's blackberry, kiwi, and other lambics really sound interesting, but I don't think I can ever justify dropping $25 on one of these again."
"Not recommended, my least favorite lambic from Upland to date."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! A gusher! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a pinkish orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, tart, sour, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The aroma on this one was pretty good, but not very complex. This was okay as it was still quite nice. The flavor on this one was quite good though. The wood aspect on this one definitely added a new dimension to this one over the other Upland Lambics we had. Really worth trying if you get the chance."
"O: I like this a lot, but the high price tag would keep me from getting this again."
"O - Really enjoyed this beer, been having a good run with the Upland Lambics lately."
"O - Really enjoyable. The cherries are excellent and it's just a very easy to drink beer. Recommend."
"Batch 134-08, bottled on 10/22/10, 750 ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a flute, the beer pours a pinkish/orange color with about an inch light pink head that stayed around a little while. There's also some sediment floaties that I can see in the glass. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is tart cherries, oak, funk and vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some lemon peel noticable. The cherry flavor is weak at first, but it does get somewhat stronger as the beer warms up more. With that being said, the cherry flavor still wasn't strong overall. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with high carbonation. I think it's a decent enough brew, I'd like to try Upland's other fruit lambics to see how they compare with this one."
"(D)- Thus far, easily the most disappointing from the Upland Lambic lineup. The fruit is muted despite how fresh it is yet and there really isnt much else going on aside from some damp oak and very minute tartness. I literally almost had to chew this since there was so much ""gunk"" in this beer. I am sorry to say that this was a fail in my opinion."
"The beer is a cloudy, hazy pink hue with a small head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma brings some light funk with a healthy dose of tart cherries. The taste follows suit. This isn't among my favorite Upland lambics, but is enjoyable nonetheless. Oak barrel notes emerge more as the beer warms. The finish brings moderate acidity. Overall, a solid fruit lambic, and one I would certainly have again."
"3.5/4/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"o - Overall a nice Upland lambic, but I preferred the Blackberry tonight. Not my favorite from Upland, but definitely worth checking out if you like their lambic offerings."
"Par for the course, this is an enjoyable American sour. Better than Strawberry, but not as good as Blackberry, Persimmon, or Peach, IMO. A little too sweet - when I came to write my review, I actually searched for Strawberry Lambic first, since that was the dominant berry note here, especially on the nose. Still, worth trying once."
"Beer is pretty funky and sour with a mild tartness from the cherries. The beer is less cherry than I expected more acetic and stronger oakiness and Brett character than I expected. I liked it enough but it is not my favorite lambic of theirs."
"O: This was a tasty enough cherry sour, but it paled in comparison to both of the other ones I sampled at the same release (Cisco Monomoy Kriek and 3F Oude Kriek '06). Nothing bad about it at all (I was afraid from the aroma that it would be too sweet overall, but the acidity in the flavor was terrific), but nothing really stood out, either. Worth trying if you're even slightly interested, but not something I'd go out of my way to have again."
"Pours a hearty red color with a light pink head that forms and quickly disapears. Aroma is acidic with funk and a strong presence of cherries. Taste is a bit more acidic then its brother brew the blackberry. The acidic flavor is accompanied by the funk and cherries, which in this case the cherries stand out a bit more. Again with the mouthfeel as in the blackberry this brew felt great! My taste buds were left intack for the rest of the tasting which is greatly appreciated. Really enjoyed this brew and will purchase in the future."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being high. Overall I thought this was an excellent beer. I really liked the tart cherry flavors it had as well as the big sourness. Very nice overall. I love cherries though so it wasn't a surprise I liked this one."
"O: My first run-in with Upland's suds, and may I say I came away throughly impressed. A memorable brew, one that showcases what the good ol' US of A can do with a classic style. I can't recommend this one enough."
"Overall: I would like to see this beer be more aromatic, especially in the funk and cherry department. Also, this would have been way better if it were a little more sour, but having said that, this beer was really good. I thought the flavor of the cherries really saved this beer."
"O: One of the better lambics from Upland thus far. I quite enjoyed this one."
"This lambic poured a light bodied spritzer like, faded rose in color with a one finger white head. The head quickly dissipated to lace the glass. It didn't look like the other lambics that I've had from Upland to date. It was a lot lighter in color and looks to be more carbonated. Also, this bottle didn't gush like some of the others have. The aroma is a nice, tart cherry upfront with little funk. The flavor too is all business. You get tart cherry with just the lightest touch of Upland's house yeast. It also has a nice dry finish. This seems to be one of Upland's more forward lambics, meaning it's closest in flavor to the fruit they are featuring (the Peach is probably the second closest). Like I said, this beer is more carbonated than their others. It's a fine drink and a pretty good sour. Is it great? Probably not, but it's worth trying and they only make between 400 and 450 bottles per batch."
"Overall, a decent effort - nowhere near as good as blackberry or blueberry, in my opinion. Will be interesting to see how this develops at the fruit character dies down a little. Should improve as the brett dries this out."
"I'm a little disappointed by this as cherry is usually my favorite lambic flavor. The ""cherry"" was a little hard to point out in this beer, however the fruity sweetness was not. These beers are pricey and a pain to obtain which knocks this as well. I've had the blackberry from this same batch and I thought that was MUCH better than this."
"EDIT: Had a second bottle of this during DLD 2011 and it was very similar. The aroma was just as bad...people kept saying burnt hair...my original assessment of perm chemicals is very similar. This is just not a good beer, and having two similar bottles takes out the chance of a bad 1st bottle."
"D: Its surprising that the Upland lambics have been so hit-or-miss for me at this point. The strawberry and raspberry were amazing but the blueberry and now cherry have been pedestrian at best. Worth a try because I suspect there's a bit of bottle variation and you just have to try ALL the flavors... but I wasn't particularly impressed here."
"D: I haven't had this fresh, but those who had said it's not the same. This one is going downhill, so drink up"
"This was very drinkable, carbonation was just right, the flavor just vanished too quickly."
"Medium to light bodied brew with a fizzy, prickly level of high carbonation that is felt in the mouth but doesn't offer much visual character. Quite easy drinking with a light puckering quality. I found myself to be salivating throughout the entire glass."
"Pours a golden color with a bit of a red-orange tint to it. Faint white head without much lacing. The nose brings some muted cherry characteristics along with a bit of earth and maybe some light, light oak. The taste is again mild cherries with a bit of sourness and light grain. Not much funk or barnyard. I was glad to try this, but it was the least interesting of the lambics that I've had from them."
"*NB - the early 2011 batch was significantly better than some of the earlier batches; still not great."
"3/3.5/4/3.5/4"
"D: Very good. Since there is so much balance in this beer, it is very easy to drink. I would love to buy a case of the cherry when the 2009/10 version is released."
"Glad I got to try this, and I wish I had other Upland lambics to compare this too, so I'll have to seek them out in the future. A huge thanks goes out to Chip for hooking me up with this long time want!"
"A pleasant surprise after having the Blueberry about a year ago. Much more tart sourness, and certainly tasty."
"This is a great representation of the style. At 6.0%abv it is also one that could be with you for the whole evening. Very light and crisp which makes it super easy to drink."
"Thanks, DrDogbeer, for the opportunity"
"Pours a pink-peachy colour, with a foaming head that settles into a Caesar head. Medium or even a tad less mouthfeel. It has that aroma a la Cantillon. Woodiness, and cherries are there all right, and sourness is malted away. A good drinking ale, nice summer drinker but neither outstanding as far as a kriek goes, better than average for a fruit beer. Active carbonation that aids digestion through burping. Sourness builds up, men drink up. Being traditional lambic cherry, it may be that the strawberry was superior and more unique."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting. Thanks whoever brought this! Pours a dark orangey goldenrod hue with a fluffy white head. Sour lemony aroma with some faint cherry pit notes. Tart and lemony, acidic, no real cherry flavor. Some wood and yeast there too. Effervescent and light bodied."
"Pours a deep orange/pink color with a bubbly white head that disappears quickly. Smells of lemon, a bit of barnyard funk, some sour smells. I pick up a light fruitiness on the nose, but can't really describe it. Taste is tart up front with a mild barnyard and a dry oak finish. Theres a lot less funk in the taste than the nose lead me to believe. Mouthfeel is acidic and slightly syrupy, carbonation is medium to high, body is medium. This is a light refreshing fruity funky brew for sure. Very easy to drink, but I would have liked a bit more lactic and definitely a bit more cherries."
"HIgh carbonation, dry on the tongue, sour and tart. Finishes extremely clean. Easy to drink. This may be the best of the Upland Lambics I have had. The blueberry, rasberry, and peach were less than stellar. This one seems to be quite good."
"Overall my favorite of the series so far, and the only one I can honestly say is not past its prime. This was still retained lots of the fruit flavor that came with it originally and I was loving every minute of it."
"Long lasting foam, dark reddish brown color. Aroma was odd, seemed like a spent bourbon barrel, possibly spirit character from acetobacter. Muddled cherry and a bit thin bodied with a light tartness. It's drinkable enough, but falls pretty short of the premium $25 pricetag."
"Taste is very good. Nice Tart and sour flavors starting off. Tends to dry out midway through the palate. Very easy drinking and highly enjoyable. My favorite of the series that I've had thus far."
"One of the better lambics from Upland, more tarty and fruity than most of the others, still wish this was more lively, one of the only ones I would revisit though, recommended"
"Taste is tart, but not quite puckering, acid, but lightly, with a small cherry contribution that is not sweet at all. Carbonation is a present but not as much as I would like, which limits the experience to some extent. Refreshing and pleasant, could use a bit more carbonation, but it is quite wortwhile."
"Drinkability- I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this one compared to the others. It's not as fruity but I don't think it's quite as sour. It's still tart but not as bitingly sour as the others were. I think it's a bit more drinkable in that sense. Either way another tasty treat from Upland!"
"Best feature of the beer was the carbonation, bubbly in the middle with a decent finish. I'm glad I opened this one with some friends as I would have had some trouble finishing the beer by myself...average at best."
"Pours a pink to light ruby red color with a soft pink colored head, two inches thick, then dissolving away slowly. There is a slight haze in the glass as well. A sour scent of cherries is strong and very dominant, with a slight hint of a malt, with a yeasty funkiness at the end. A very tart and tanginess of cherries, the blending to a mild maltiness, though the cherries stay with you till the end. It finishes with a yeasty souriness. Very evervesant, much like champagne, the carbonation stays with each taste. A thin to medium bodied feel, ending with a mild dryness. It is truly nice to see american brewers venturing into the world of lambics. Kudos to Upland, for making a truly a very good beer."
"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle and served in a tulip. This beer poured a reddish amber with a thin head of off-white fizz that lasted throughout most of the glass. Not much lacing. The aroma included sour cherry skins, oak, a hint of wheat, and cobwebs. The flavor consisted of a big burst of dry, sour cherries on top of a delicate wheat base. Mildly funky and tart. The mouthfeel was light-bodied and had crisp, aggressive carbonation. A pretty nice beer, but I would have prefered a little more funkiness."
"Beautiful red-orange color with the slightest hint of pink. The smell is on point, subtle zoo/barnyard/animal funk (not horseblanket), gives an authentic feel to the beer. The taste has a cherry element and very subtle funk notes, just a little tartness but never really becomes puckering or what I would consider sour. This was a nice kriek and the funky smell was the best aspect."
"Pours a foggy reddish hued amber. Nose is hooooiee sour! Lactic and pure sour bretty funk. Flavor is interesting. Mild cherry tones. Vanilla wood is there as well. Highly lactic. Calms down over time, or perhaps my palate is acclimating. Feel has a typical carbonation; liquid is typical. This is a good lambic. For an American producer to release a lambic that doesn't absolutely suck says something. Now all we have to do is work on the complexities and iron out the wrinkles and we can start getting cocky against Cantillon."
"This beer started out pretty decently, even if a bit short on cherry character, but as it warms up the cherry, while still soft, becomes distinctly noticeable in both the nose and flavor. Really quite nice and my favorite of the Upland Lambics so far."
"This is a very good lambic."
"The body is light with the cherries leaving a sweeter finish. Some very nice qualities but overall I would have liked a bit more yeasty characteristics to come out."
"Notes from and tasted on 10/25/08"
"Another Upland lambic from their series. The Cherry is unique unto itself with a tartness that accompanies the oaked barrel taste that enhances the sourness.All blend together to dance on your pallete leaving a pleasant after taste. The flavors are more up front on the Cherry and linger after you swallow. easy to drink with a somewhat watery mouthfeel. Slight sourness that will only increase as the beer ages!"
