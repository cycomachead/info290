"Tastes very intense and very good.  Generic lactic acid starts things out, but it gets supplemented quickly by big nodes of sweet, mellow peaches. There's a tiny bit of funk on the back end, but overall it's just tart acid balanced by sweet peaches.  Very nice."

"Overall: another solid lambic from upland. the fruitiness is a little weaker on this one than others and that cause me to like it a little less."

"The beer pours a hazy, vibrant light orange topped by a thin white head and big flocks of white sediment stirring around the bottom. The nose is vaguely funky, with light tart peach notes, a hint if puke, and some grain. It's a tart and grainy sour with fantastic peach flavor, some lemon & Granny Smith apple, a great malt backbone, and subtle fruitiness that lingers in the finish. For an upland, this is a very approachable, medium bodied, reasonably carbonated, and drinkable sour (not super acidic) that amplifies a subtle peach characteristic and maintains a great grain and yeast presence alongside. I'd highly recommend this beer and would rank it as one of my favorite uplands."

"Overall - So far, this might be my favorite sour from Upland."

"O-One of the better Upland lambics, peaches are a great fruit and they really come through in this beer Had it again, the peach flavor was perfect one of the better lambics Upland made. The extra 3 months of age gave off a perfect peach flavor."
""
""

""
""
"Poured into a wine glass, very nice golden, orange color. Little head that quickly went away. Not picking up an peach in the nose, just the sour alcohol smell. Decently harsh. Taste. Wow! Huge sour up front. Hits you in the corner of your jaw. Finished with an amazing peach flavor. One of the most fruit forward flavored lambics I've ever tried. Slightly undercarbed. I get what the Upland hype is all about now."

"Pours a cloudy orangish color with no head and some floaters. Nose has the signature upland acidic punch along with fleshy peach notes. The taste is very tart up front with nice juicy peaches in the middle. The finish has some light oak and nice fruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation. Overall this is another nice sour that has a high degree of tartness and plenty of fruit."

"O: Definitely enjoyed this one as I'm a fan of peach. The played off the sweetness of the peach very well."
"O: For its age, has held up very nicely. Lots of peach still in it, though I imagine some of it has faded. Bet it is quite good fresh, not that it isn't now, just a different beast."

"Another nice lambic from Upland!"
""
""

"O: Meh. Sure, it's a sour peach beer (which is always great), but there are better ones, by a big margin."
""
""
""
""
"B+ to A- range"
""
""
"D: This was a great lambic, but the peach character was quite subdued. The scent and taste were bold yet delicate, and the body was fitting. Not sure how this was 1.5 years ago (fresh), but I wish there was more peach at this point. Otherwise, this was a fantastic brew to sip and savor. Could age a long time, as long as you won't miss the hint of peach. Recommended."

""
""
"D - Enjoyable for the most part, but I could have gone for more peach flavor. Really easy to drink, but a bit lacking in depth and complexity."

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottled on 10/12/10, Batch 42-90. This bottle was a slow gusher when I opened it. Served in a flute, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with some floaties, and about an inch carbonated white head that fizzled away quickly. There isn't much lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like tart and sweet peaches, lemon peel, and musty, earthy funk. I think the taste is similar to the aroma. The sour/tart flavors are stronger than the sweet peach ones, but the tartness isn't overpowering at all. As the beer warms up, the peach flavors really come out more. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and well carbonated. I think it's a good brew, I liked it. $19.79 a bottle at Liquor Barn."
""
""

"Overall: This was more refreshing than the raspberry. Not quite as sour either. Really good."
""
""
"Overall: Its a nice beer and its enjoyable, but I am not a huge fan of peaches, but I would drink it again."

"Pours a hazy golden yellow with lots of bubbles and a thick fluffy white head. The nose has light notes of a funky brett, leather and a touch of salt. Soft golden peach sits nicely behind the lambic notes. The flavor is more brett forward, sweetness is a bit stronger than I anticipated, the peach is clean and tasty with a soft sourness and a nice acidity in the finish. The body is creamy, light and fluffy with a fair bit of carbonation."

"O - Great beer. Upland keeps getting better at these things, and this is a great sour for any maker or country."

"Lovely lovely lambic, almost champagne like in it's carbonation/sour interplay. One of my favorite fruit sour beers so far!"
"Well done peach sour, not syrupy sweet and not too light with the peaches. Solid."
"O: Pretty frigging good. Easy to drink and suprisingly refreshing."
"Good funk on the nose with lemon rind and very subtle peach and funk flavor on the tongue. Honestly, if I didn't know this had a peach addition I wouldn't have been able to find the flavors in this one. Worth a try and not a bad beer by any means, but it's not peachy. The beer could use some drying out so maybe sit on this for awhile if you're planning on drinking this batch soon."
"O: Overall not the easiest drinking beer. This one drinks more like a flavored soda than a beer. I think it gets a little better as it warms. Not overly impressed by this one but definitely glad I got to try it. Totally different than most offerings. I look forward to trying the other Uplands I have. 3.5"
"Overall, a very well done lambic that I'll need to acquire more of. It certainly makes me want to try Upland's other flavors."
"Drink- Overall, this was good. It just didnt sit well in the flavor dept. It was lacking in pop over the other beers in the series. The peach got lost."
"This was a great drink. I was worried that there would be too much peach sweetness, but the fruit is used perfectly here."
"o: not what I expected. good peach flavor could be more prominent, and whatever the opening alcohol flavor was overwhelmed my palette. Curious if there was an issue with my batch, as something here tasted off."
"Gracias to Rempo for hooking me up on the Peach lambic! Very fun to try (I open all of my Upland lambics with my wife) and I would definitely try again. Tons of peach aroma on the front end. Quit yeast near the end, more grainy and less aromatic at the finale. Initially poured very clear and then clouded up on the second pour. Mouthfeel was average to me (I prefered the mouthfeel on the blueberry a bit more). Smell was the best attribute for me on this one and the wife liked it more once it warmed up a bit."
"Bottle (gusher), thanks to weisguy. Hazy gold pour, white foam quickly recedes to no head. Aroma is quite funky, nice barnyard, fresh peaches, something that resembles bell peppers. Taste is sweet, lots of peaches on the finale, a bit of acidity, but nothing like a traditional lambic. Palate is a little sweet, not quite dry enough. Count me into the people who think this is a pretty good fruit sour, but not much of a fruit lambic. Well, you have the barnyard aroma but the the taste is a little sweet. I’d have it on a regular basis though, very fun stuff to try."
"This was the non-consensus favorite of all the Upland lambics (I personally preferred the Persimmon). The fruit comes through beautifully and the clean, tart and sweet flavor of the peach works perfectly to create a subtle, yet complex, quenching, and enjoyable lambic."
"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with myself and funkydelic during one of our weekly tastings! Bottled on 10/12/10. Batch 42-09. Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, peaches, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. I found it quite odd that there was no sign of the peaches in the aroma on this one. However the flavor made up for this fact as the peaches were quite prominant. Just something about peaches mixed with sour/tart notes that make me all fuzzy inside (no pun intended). Really glad I got to try this one and I suggest you do as well."
"I like this one quite a bit. Recommended."
"O - A very good fruit lambic, but really does fall short compared to Fou Foune (which I understand is really a upper echelon peach lambic, but still...). Solid and I would love to have another, but not sure this lived up to the advance hype and demand that this beer commanded around its release. Definitely try it if you have the oppportunity, but don't go crazy trying to obtain it either."
"Bottle. Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip glass a cloudy opaque amber orange color with a white head that collars around the glass. Nice Sour aroma of peach, apricot, lemon zest, and slight vinegar. It’s not overly peachy in flavor. Slightly sweet start with hints of fruit, lemon, slight medicinal, and a white wine flavor like Chardonnay. The sourness level is moderate. No apparent alcohol notes. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Clean ending."
"Overall, this was a very easy drinking sour. Not overly peachy, but enjoyable. I'd recommend this one."
"O: I liked this beer. I'm rarely impressed by sours, as my palate seems to not be privy to them at the moment, but this was pretty good."
"O- maybe losing one third of it to gushing soured this for me (no pun intended), or maybe its me comparing it to the styles european brothers, but this just doesnt do it for me. i think i traded a cantillon gueuze for this, and although im greatfull for the trade and chance to try this, i cant help but feel i got the short end of the stick on this trade. my first and possibly only try with an upland lambic."
"O - This is another very nice fruit-forward lambic from Upland; I've yet to be disappointed by any of their fruit Lambic. If the carbonation issues were handled, I'd hold it in even higher esteem."
"Upland's Peach lambic is quite good, one of the better fruited lambics that I have tried."
"I'm a big fan."
"This brew is sharp and tart, it has quite a salivation factor. It is easy drinking but the plastic and cardboard held me back from fully enjoying this offering. It is medium bodied and modestly to highly carbonated. It is worth giving a try if you get the opportunity but if you come across it for a rediculous price of $36 don't waste your time or money."
"There is a lot of fruit and a lot of carbonation, but it blends itself and balances out once in a glass and sitting for a few minutes. Big on the one flavor and not a real blended beer, more straight forward. Quite tasty."
"4.0 D: Another well made wild from Upland. This one is already decently sour. I wonder how it will age. Anyway, solid all around."
"Light orange gold pour. Nose is tight brett, salt, some peaches, light solvent. Peaches are a bit more prevalent in the mouth, decently integrated, with quite a salty brett wound tightly in there. Long sour finish with some lingering peach sweetness. Not particularly well balanced, with some lingering acidity. Decent, but not one of the better Upland lambics."
"(D)- A solid lambic from the states. A fitting sour/acidic kick with a refreshing fruit profile. Crisp and refreshing; a great sour for the warmer weather that is approaching. I could have finished this whole bottle easily."
"Pours a murky yellowish orange with a nice white head. The head dissipates quickly. The beer looks fairly pretty. Smells funky and sour with a lot of nice light fruit flavours. The peach is. S subtle on the nose. The tastes is nicely fruity. Lots of light peach flavours. Vry well carbonated and a solid mouthfeel"
"O-very good beer. Makes my mouth water for more. Cant wait for more lambic."
"p.s. Screw that band. Seriously."
"Beer is thin and heavily carbonated on the palate. I really enjoy this beer a lot. It is acetic and lactic, mildly citric or succinic, nice peach flavor, tartness at the back, I really love this beer. I want more more more."
"Overall, another delicious fruit lambic from Upland. I'd happily have this again anytime. Definitely recommended."
"Very light mouthfeel, relatively standard for the style, but the complexity is just not there when compared to a classic gueze or lambic. Upland is getting there, maybe they are intentionally not making it as offensive as some lambics to appeal to more people but I would say this is decent overall; just not great. Healthy carbonation on this one. Easily drinkable."
"Mild gusher pours a murky golden orange with a big white head; minimal retention or lacing. Aroma is mildly sour and lactic, light oak and some fruity peach skins. Flavor has all of the components of the nose, but lacks any cohesion or balance. Sweet, juicy peach fruit dominates the front of the palate and seems to float on top of a strong lactic, earthy and funky base. Body is medium thick, well carbonated; puckering and sour. Pleasant, but forgettable; delivers the promise of peaches but isn't a great lambic."
"O: On the sweet side, but the fresh peach flavor is really enjoyable. One of the better Upland lambic varieties."
"D: Well a bit of a disappointment. I've heard this ages like a champ. Well call me in 5 years and we can talk again."
"Would really like to try the other variations out there, but they seem a bit hard to track down."
"2nd Edit: 2011 batch. Properly carbonated, fruity with tangy peach, moderately sour. Well done, an improvement to be sure."
"D- This beer wasn't as sour as anticipated but still wasn't a letdown. Good all around and in my opinion, worth the price."
"Same with the taste, nicely sour with good peach flavors. Light carbonation, still a little buzzy on the tongue. Nice."
"Mouthfeel is a little thicker than expected but there's tons of carbonation. An enjoyable sour but the sweet peaches and the lambic never quite come together to make this beer great."
"The body feels more carbonated than it looks, but still feels a bit low to me. Overall, this isn't bad--- I think I set the bar a bit high after drinking Cascade Apricot... This one just doesn't blow me away... I can enjoy this beer... But I won't be searching it out."
"D - This was really quite good. I'm really not a fan of peach, but I liked this."
"d - Solid, but probably my least favorite of the 4 Uplands we opened. I thought all 4 were solid, but none of them blew me away."
"D: really great! Damn what a fine fruit lambic."
"Overall - Not too shabby. Right now I'd put this well above the Strawberry but slightly above the Blueberry. A stronger peach flavor profile would have helped, but in the end this is well made. Reminds me more of a combo between Cuvee Renee and Brute. If you want more fruit, go for the Blueberry. If tart/sour is your game, hit up the Peach."
"Carbonation is on the lower side and it's sweeter than befits the style, but it's nice, tart, and refreshing. Well done, Bloomington."
"Pours a hazy orange-peach color with a thin white head that dissipates pretty quickly into not much other than a thin collar around the edges. The nose is pretty impressive right off the bat, reminding me a lot of Flaming Fury. There's a strong peach presence behind quite a bit of a lactic character and some mild funk. The taste is at the same level. Not quite as much of a funky presence as I would ultimately like, but they held onto this one for long enough, as the sourness and peach are both at levels that are highly complementary of each other right now. Feel is nice with a good pucker factor and sour finish. Drinks pretty easily; I had no problems at all finishing my portion of the bottle."
"At little pricey and hard to come by so it rates a little low. If I were to go out of my way for the Upland lambics, I'd grab a blueberry or datalion just based on taste. I wouldn't turn one down if offered however."
"D - Alright, but the low carbonation and vinegar notes really ding this beer. Pretty easy to drink, but its just kind of bland. I know peaches are hard to get a lot of flavor out of, so Id like to see if the other wilds from Upland are any better."
"D- This beer was average for the style. Upland really let me down with this beer and I don't think I'll ever buy this lambic from them again. Bottle gushed and there were no real lasting peach flavor. It was good as a flavorless just sour mess."
"Another stellar Upland. Clearly shows the newest batch is on POINT. You gotta get you some!"
"This bottle pours the muddiest or apricot oranges with no head at all. It began to foam really quickly but I poured all of it before it could billow out of the bottle. It smells like a very, very dry fruit infused sour. It also has a good amount of hay and funkiness. It tastes of dried apricot and of dried peach skins. It reminds me of dried fruit through and through. The bitterness is both efficient and appealing. The flavor is between apricot and peach, which is confusing. I do like it though. It drinks very crisp. The carbonation is actually perfect, especially considering it began to foam and then that was it. This beer was good but probably not $20 a bottle good. It's a good sour, which I had been told, but it wasn't spectacular. I realize it was a 400 or so bottle batch but it could've been better. I have another bottle so hopefully it gets better with time. Good beer though, not great."
"Drinkability: Goes down oh so easy, I'd like it to be more lambic with more sour and funk (and more fruit), but this is enjoyable as well. Upland uses a yeast strain that normally bothers me but I don't pick it up in this one. After trying it twice I have had my fill but the late 2010 batch was definitely an improvement on the earlier batch."
"3/3/3.5/2.5/3.5"
"Pours a cloudy orange with no head at all. The aroma is acrid and vinegar-like. The taste is much more subtly sour than I expected. The lambic is still wine-like and peach flavored, but overall way better than I expected. I'm very curious what hte abv is because it's no tposted, but I would get this again if I could ever find it."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is very even and smooth considering the extreme flavors. I would call this something I'm glad that I'm splitting with people because I wouldn't want this bottle to myself."
"Drinks well- lambic are easy drinkers but tough to be impressed with a low ABV"
"D: Just okay."
"Pretty much a letdown from the get-go. A flat pour followed by a promising nose but fairly weak in the palate. Lacking the sourness and sharp acid base needed for the style and I was at least expecting some tartness from the pits. Tasty enough but not worth the expense of the bottle."
"Cheers!"
"Nice peachy color. flat, no head. Nice, vibrant aroma, but is it peaches? It's certainly fruity but not necessarily distinctively peaches. Low level of sourness/acidity, and overall very underwhelming in the flavor after a fairly nice aroma- just subtle sweet fruits. Suffers greatly from the lack of carbonation. A spritzer-like carbonation would do wonders for this beer."
"I have found this whole series to be underwhelming. The fruit flavor was absent in most all of them, blackberry aside, and the lack of carbonation and overall pour look could be attributed to all but one having a leaky cork. Not sure what is going on with these fully, but there are underwhelming to say the least."
"I would love to see more carbonation, and some of that funk translate into the flavor. I like how the peach is just a note as opposed to an overwhelming flavor, but this one needs a little bit more work."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"It is easy to drink and it's not that offensive, but it just isn't a great representation of a lambic. Could definitely use some aging."
"Overall this was a good beer, but I think it has the potential to be a lot better after the sweetness mellows out and the funk has some time to grow."
"750 Bottle - Pours a beautiful, incredibly cloudy peach/grapefruit color with the consistency and look of fruit juice. No carbonation is visible. Smells only of Brettanomyces. First sip is mostly Brett but surprisingly there is plenty sweetness left and really not too sour. Almost no carbonation to speak of in the mouthfeel. My guess is a year in the cellar and the sweetness will be more eaten and we'll have a funkier beer to enjoy."
"This is certainly a drinkable lambic, mainly because there is almost no funk in there yet. I have a feeling this one will be much more representative of the style in a year or two when the funk starts to come out. Pretty fruity in it's current state."
"750ml bottle thanks to tjthresh. When I removed the cap the cork was bubbling, I wonder what it would look like in a couple years, I'm guessing black and moldy like a Cantillon. The first whiff I took from the bottle got me excited for the funk. It smells like a nice fruity lambic, a little funk but not distinct peachiness. The color is hazy golden orange and it is completely flat which is a let down. There is hardly any sourness until the end and the flavor is kind of weak in my opinion resembling watered-down juice. Sadly this is probably my least favorite of the Upland lambics I've had."
"Good, but not the best of 7."
"Notes from and tasted on 10/25/07"
"Definitely a bit of a disappointment, this is not bad though, it just could be so much more. The lack of sourness, much less bracing acidity, one expects in a Lambic is a glaring hole, and there isn't even any barnyard funkiness to up the complexity here. The lack of carbonation hurts a bit more, but would not really have been an issue if the other Lambic characteristics had been captured. Actually because of the lack of sourness and funk, the carbonation issue becomes all that much more of a problem."
"Drinkability- I really feel that the fact that this has almost no carbonation probably affected the flavor a bit which is what keeps me from giving it a 5 that I know it deserves. It's remarkably delicious and the Peach is so perfectly potent that I almost can't believe it. If you have a bottle of this you may want to sit on it for a couple months just to be sure it's fully carbonated. My score really doesn't reflect how good this beer is because Mouthfeel and Appearance have to take hit. Huge thanks to Matt for the opportunity!"
