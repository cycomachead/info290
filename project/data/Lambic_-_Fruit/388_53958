The elderflower takes center stage of this lambic and showcases as green, herbal, medicinal, floral and peppery. It's quite unlike any other Cantillon or for that matter any other beer I have tasted. The green pepper flavor is off putting at first but opens up into something that is quite interesting and complex. Wet grass, pungent fresh cut weeds, a sweet floral aroma and a peppery floral overtone. The lambic base is sour, funky and slightly cheesy. A nice experience for sure but I'd choose a classic geuze next time.","brianmandell","Feb 16, 2015"

Good, and interesting overall, but I can't quite say that the stiff shelf tag (even for these guys) would be really worth having another go, even if presented the opportunity.","biboergosum","May 26, 2014"

Aroma...well this is interesting. Peaches, vinegar, floral notes, light dry oak and sourness, and yes, dill pickles. Somehow not off-putting though and the sweet peachy smell is nice. Flavor is pickle juice, sour vinegar funk, dry oak, light peaches or apricots. Weird. Light bodied but sweet with prickly high carbonation. Finishes dry.

Aroma is nice and tart, the brew smells like tart lemon, herbs/flowers (which I assume is from the elderflowers), oak, and some funk. It tastes like tart citrus, elderflowers (herbal/floral taste), green pepper, funk, oak, and some apricot. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's well carbonated and enjoyable to drink.

Definitely has the signature cantillon bretty barnyard funk character wtih nice citrus, good acidic in the nose, slight pineapple and mango fruit and oaky wood. The wood oakiness with barnyard bretty funk meld very well with citrusy accents, mild grapefruit twang, pineapple notes and a touch of corky flavor. The brew was light to medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a funky bretty horseblanket, citrusy oaky sour and slight dry finish.

Probably the least appealing Cantillon aroma I've ever smelled. Once I give it another whiff, I get more than just dirt. There is definitely the earthy dirt notes, but there is also a clean, fresh-cut bell pepper aroma. Bell pepper, dirt, and funky sour notes mesh for quite an interesting aroma that can grow on you after a few whiffs. Taste is very vegetal at first, with a good amount of sour. The bell pepper and vegetable come through in the flavor, leaving the dirt aroma behind in the nose. No dirt flavor...very tasty actually. Refreshing vegetable and sour flavors. Slight acidity, but not much. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, almost puckering sour. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is the most bizarre Cantillon I have ever had. However, I respect them for creating something outside the norm of lambic. The vegetable notes are superb on this beer.","DovaliHops","Jan 07, 2013"

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyed this one while pre-gaming going out jazz club hopping in New Orleans at Avenue Pub! Served from tap into a wine glass. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, bell pepper, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, bell pepper, floral, sour, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. When I had this out of the bottle back at Zwanze Day 2011 I experienced a bell pepper flavor and I thought that it might have been a figment of my imagination. Now that I’ve got to have it on tap as well and still pick up on the bell pepper it appears to be pretty solid evidence. There is nothing wrong with this fact at all though as it actually seemed to fit in quite nicely with the brew and add a nice earthiness to it. A well done brew that I can’t wait to see how it ages in the bottles I have laid down in the cellar.","thagr81us","Dec 29, 2012"
3.73,-11,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a cloudy golden body with a thick white head that faded to a good lasting film. This beer smells like no other I’ve had, but that’s probably because I’ve never even hear of an elderflower before this. The nose is very peppery, like that of a red bell pepper, and vegetal. That characteristic musty Cantillon funk is right in there next to the strange notes of bell pepper and citrus. Smells like a musty of garden. The taste is better than the nose in my opinion as a little bit more funk and lemony citrus mixes with the pepper and vegetables, but overall this isn’t my favorite lambic. The mouthfeel is very airy, bubbly and fairly dry. I’d like to try a bottle of this beer in a few years when it’s had at least half a decade of age on it to see how it has changed.

The flavor has much more pepper/herbs to it, with a light touch of fruitiness shining through as well. There's some wet hay, barnyard funk, but definitely not as much as in the nose. Can't really say the beer tastes tart or sour either. The carbonation is nice and bubbly, but the body is noticeably more full/chewy than you'd normally expect for the style.

Crisp taste, more of the characteristics noted in the nose: wet grass, cardboard, very floral, tart, but not overly so; mid- to end-palate displays heavy flavors of green peppers, pickle brine, and a touch of white wine and cheap Champagne (ps - all Champagne tastes like cheap Champagne to me).

The nose starts off tart if a little musty, but finishes with some spice, plums, grapefruit and floral aroma. This one is incredibly complex upon first sip! Starts off a little spicy, as in serrano pepper, but quickly reveals many more layers. The elderflower is present, but very subtle lending some floral notes and grapefruit along with the lemony tartness that is evident without dominating. Many other flavors emerge such as ripe apples, The mouthfeel is phenomenal. There is ample carbonation, but the texture is creamy and culminates in superb balance.

The aroma is pleasant, s bit of classic funk, some old dusty barn, and a floral perfume. The nose leads me to believe I'm in for a great experiance. My first sip leaves me perplexed and a second confirms my fears. Mamouche starts with a delicate soft sourness and slight lemon-y funk. Then I get this strange vegitile flavor, it is slightly floral but reminds me more of tomatillos. While I like some of the aspects of this beer I can't get past the vegitile tomatillo thing. Otherwise this is a flawless lambic, great mouthfeel, its fluffy and not thin. In the end the pluses of this beer just don't outweigh how I felt about the flavor.

Nose is herbal, mint-like, softly funky, a touch cheesy. Flavor is very heavy on the elder flowers, which comes across with a heavily herbal quality. When they tend toward minty I'm not sure if I like it. As it breaths it balances out a bit. It's actually a fun beer, kind of singular, not one of their more funky or sour offerings, but definitely well executed and pretty tasty.","JAXSON","Apr 05, 2011"

3.92,-6.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4," I enjoyed the taste which has plenty of herbal qualities which I would compare to fennel and perhaps a slight tinge of very mild pepper and cooking herbs like sage w/ a pinch of anise, maybe. It is very hard to put my finger on what is contributed by the elderflower since I never had it before and I am sure some of the flavor comes from the yeast and other bacteria making it even more complex. I think you really have to have an open mind since it doesn't have much in the way of sweetness. It is very earthy and compares in a way to Gruit with the astringent herbal notes. Overall I say it is not the best I have had from Cantillon, but it is definitely unique and worth trying -especially if you enjoy more earthy/herbal flavored beer.","Slatetank","Mar 20, 2011"

4.92,17.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability ... finished the 750ml by myself quite easily and then wondered why I didn't buy another bottle or two!! but I'd opted for a fresh St. Lamvinus to travel back with and the luggage was getting heavy. So glad I got to taste Zwanze 2009 though. Cantillon's 2009 released beers are amazing even for their high standards ... this is the third I've tried after Blabaer and Fou Foune that have been just ""wow""!!!","Habanero58","Nov 08, 2009"

4.7,12.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I only like this style of beers if they are of extremely high quality. About the Zwanze I can only say I didn't like it... I LOVED IT! A unique beer, with a unique taste. A great experiment from the Cantillon brewers. This must be the most well balanced Lambic beer I ever had (together with the Dirty Horse from de Struise brewers). I think this beer might become even better over time (I think it is still a bit young), so in case you manage to get your hands on a bottle now, be patient, it will be rewarded for sure! (by the way, the brewer advised me to open my bottle at least 30 minutes before drinking....)","rvdoorn","0"
