Poured in a snifter, the beer is a rose-tinged pink coloring, almost like a dark grapefruit juice, with no head. Huge pop when the cork popped on this one, and tart cherry aromas came out in abundance on the pour. Aromas of subtle cherry sweet and rich on a tart and slightly citrusy backbone. Some funky sour highlights in the nose, also. Flavors are very rich, with an almost floral backbone, that deliver a dark roasted quality at the end of the palate, with woody and earthy tones. In between, there is a rich, dark cherry sweetness that starts in a bold blast that slowly subsides as it washes over the palate. This beer is a bit of a rollercoaster for the taste buds. Tart cherry and slightly acidic characteristics slowly build as you drink. The aftertaste is tangy and tart, with a sweet undertone. Dry, slightly effervescent and sour finish. Very tasty!","GarthDanielson","Jun 15, 2013"

The huge cherry flavors and the tartness make this very enjoyable and I almost forget that I'm actually drinking a beer. While I gave this brew a high score, I'm not sure I'd want to drive the 3 hours to the brewery and pay 15 bucks for another bottle of this. If I found this in a local shop then I most likely would. Nonetheless, this is a great beer and I'm excited to venture even further into the world of sours.","RichD","May 27, 2013"

I would love to see this beer after a year or two of melding inside the bottle.","BEERchitect","May 14, 2012"

3.5,-19,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Easy to drink, difficult to acquire, and pretty underwhelming compared to its Belgian brethren. Probably my least favorite of the Coolships. I'm also puzzled by the unusually high alcohol content, particularly compared to other lambic and even other Allagash offerings.","MasterSki","Apr 05, 2012"

3.68,-14.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O - A solid American Wild, but this didn't really blow me out of the water. For the low bottle count and how hard these are to obtain, I would just go for something else in the style category. Decent.","Sean9689","Mar 27, 2012"
