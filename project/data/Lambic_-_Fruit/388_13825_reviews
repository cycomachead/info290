"O: Yes, I bought this one at the Cantillon Brewery in Late 2013, and brought it back to China where I am drinking it April 5th, 2015.  Amazing brew.  Dry and sour fruit lambic as classic as it should be. It was labelled as 2011."

"The brewers seem disappointed that most people prefer the more fruit-forward ""Lou Pepe"" versions, but it makes sense to me -- the Lou Pepe versions will really make you pucker with the sour fruit."

"This one was even better than Fou Foune - the most drinkable, but yet complex, sour I have ever had.  Massive raspberry here. On a night we tried Fou Foune, St. Lam, and Iris, this was easily the highlight"
"This is not sweet or syrupy. This has a strong raspberry flavor that is tight in line with the tart level and influence from the barrel. Another home run from Cantillon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I finally get to try more Cantillon, I seem to understand the allure of sours more and more. This one was so good."
""
""
"By far the best Framboise I've ever had."
""
"Its light body is both softened with carbonation but is also given a sprite effervescent that springs from the tongue like brut champagne. Acidity strips the thirst from the palate and ushers in a high rate of refreshment and drinkability that outweighs its intense raspberry sourness. With an afterglow of fruit, wheat, cork and white pepper."

"2013 vintage. Smell of rasberries. Taste is slightly sour with a punch of rasberries. Bitterness is long and fruity. Lou Pepes are really the best from Cantillon!"

"Burg shared this gem with everyone at the Swamp Head Batch 600 release. A huge want of mine. Thanks man! 2010 Sticker on this one pours bright red with a mostly white with a pink hued read on top. Aroma of barnyard funk, yeast, hay, dust, and big juicy raspberries. Flavor follows just the same with lots of dusty barnyard funk and plenty of juicy raspberries. Dry oaky finish. Body is light, pretty dry on the finish, and has medium plus carbonation. Oh yea. This is good. Glad I finally got to try it."

"I saved this one to log as my 1,500th review. Big thanks to jcvanderbilt for the trade. Pours a bright juicy reddish pink with nice clarity and minimal head. The nose is unbelievable. Full of jammy raspberries, a hint of earth, layers of signature Cantillon funk, a hint of vinegar and oak, but mainly ripe fresh berries. I could smell this all day! The taste lives up to the delightful smell with fresh juicy berries, waves of tartness which are counterbalanced with sweetness. Each flavor pops as this is the tastiest lambic I have ever had the pleasure of trying. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, this beer is fantastic. Definitely the best of the loons I have tried and one that I will have to seek out again."

"The color on this is beautiful. Bright red, nice two finger pink head. Smell of vibrant raspberries, some lemon, a tad sour. The taste is right on with the smell. It's so good, i almost don't believe it's real. Such a great balance of favors and the perfect amount of sour. Carbonation is nice, tingles on the tongue but not too much, allowing you to focus on the intense raspberry flavor. Can't say much more, I love it, and I'm gonna savor the rest of this glass."

"Overall: Between LP Kriek and LP Fram, the clear winner is the Framboise. What a great sour beer by Cantillion."

"O: I was very very impressed by this beer! Really fantastic framboise from Cantillon."

""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Not surprisingly, this is another winner from Cantillon. Huge fresh, jammy raspberry with tartness and funk that are strong enough to add additional complexity without overwhelming the fruit character. Best raspberry lambic, and possibly best fruit lambic of any kind that I've had. Definitely worth seeking out."

"O - without a doubt, the best framboise I've ever had. Rose de Gambrinus is a great beer and this one is just like RDG, but on steroids."
""
""
"An excellent beer in the finest Cantillon style. The Lou Pepe range truly is the pinnacle of what they produce. The even rarer stuff is hardly worth the effort compared to this sublime product."
"Of all the dozens of Lambics I've reviewed on my home (North American) turf, none have recaptured and recalled the charm, character and cuisine of Belgium - at least those elements that I've always taken away from it - better than Lou Pepe Framboise. Each trip to Brussels is relived with every sip. It is a dazzling beer and easily one of the more memorable ones I've tried."

"Rose colored head, very small bubbles, you can *hear* the dissipation on this champagne like beer. Interesting raspberry aroma, not a big fruity nose, but rather delicate, masks the funky horseblanket notes from this 2010 vintage. Taste is certainly on the tart not sour side, pronounced yet not heavy berry notes, enough funk to keep your interest, nice balance with the raspberries. Mouthfeel on the light side, delicate, huge effervescent mouthfeel. Wow. Beer of the Gods. The exemplar of the style."

"O- Overall this was a pleasure to drink. The aroma was top notch, and the taste could stand up to many of the best sours out there. I'm taking off a little extra just because as it warmed a bit past cellar temp (which is what it was served at) the flavor dropped off slightly and became more vinegary (which I don't necessarily mind much, but it took over the raspberries, which I feel are meant to be featured)."

"750mL 2001 ed thanks again to ygtbsm94. Pours a fire amber red with an excellent pink head that is extremely healthy for a sour albeit a little fizzy. Aroma is unreal: so much fresh raspberry, raspberry preserves, and insanely sharp funk. Taste is sharp, ultimate level of lactic acidity, seedy raspberries, rhubarb, sorrel, and starchy earth. Palate is all consuming, zippy, dry, insanely powerful but quick on your body. What a complete devastation of the framboise category. I cannot believe it but Puzzl and others are right- there is some serious aging potential for krieks and framboise. This has become sharper and more fruity heavy with 10 years on it rather than more mellow. 2/12/2011 9/4/8/5/16=4.2"

"O: Incredible. I tend to prefer fruited sours and this might be the best one I've ever had. The raspberry character is just incredible. I'm thankful I have another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid though not exceptional. Not as fruit forward as I would like, but complex and well integrated. Maybe I would prefer a fresh bottle."
""
""
"Overall a great example of a framboise of a different nature. Surprising example of what sweet and sour can accomplish in a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Easily my favorite Framboise. The depth of flavor is impeccable. I was super excited to try this and it blew me away. A delicious beer. Must try the other Lou Pepe brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Cantillon really knows oohs to make their lambics, I prefer the LP Kriek slightly over this but both are incredible. I'd like to try this with some more age as I think the funk would come out a bit more while still blending nicely with the cherries. Not the easiest bottle to get (at least in e US), but definitely worth trying if you can."

"O - My first time having this one fresh and it was interesting. I was expecting a lot more fruit than I got from it, mostly the trademark Cantillon musty funk combo but that is fine as well. Probably my least favorite of the three Lou Pepe's but still a beer worth seeking out."
""
"Ruby red - bright, with pink hues. The LP Framboise is beyond jammy - its exploding with sweet and tart berry with a seedy finish. Acetic, musty, vinegar, moderate tartness. My least favorite of the 3 Lou Pepe's but I think that's just a style preference thing. An exceptional Framboise."

"Overall: What an incredible drinking experience. This Cantillon is world-class, near-perfection of what a fruited, funky sour should be. I'm thoroughly excited to try my Lou Pepe Kriek's and might even hang onto my 2009 Lou Pepe Gueuze."

"Bloody nice, wonderfully cheerful, tasty as hell. Excellent beer. I do believe I am going to like it here."
"I really enjoyed this one. This is beyond better than Rosé, as it is more complex while being more fruity and brings out the other flavours of the brewing process very well. Still, raspberries don't provide as much complexity as the cherries do in the corresponding Krieks. I prefer Lou Pepe Kriek to this, but this is still an absolute delight to drink."
""
"OVERALL: This is really nice. Lots of good fruit flavor with a solid lambic as a base, and a full, creamy feel to support the show. Well balanced and very flavorful. The look was a little lack-luster, though we can forgive that for sure. Good stuff and well worth checking out. Recommended."

"On cask at Moeder Lambic on 4/7/2013. Pours a beautiful raspberry hue, slightly hazy in clarity, with a fluffy, cloud-like, light pink head similar to the color of cotton candy. Nose expresses citrus, rind, cork and a wisp of raspberry essence at the back. Taste consistent with nose - no real surprises here. Citric acid is very assertive in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body, puckeringly tart and lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a very good fruit lambic; however, I'd like to have had a little more raspberry flavor."
"Update: The following day, I opened the 2008 vintage bottled in 2010. This has a deeper red color and the raspberry flavor is slightly fresher with a much lower acetic acid level that did not produce the wave of acidity I experienced with the 2006 and is better carbonated with a more champagne-like mouthfeel. I could enjoy sipping a whole bottle of this vintage, which is what I am about to do :-). Because the 2008 vintage presents considerably better, I have upgraded my earlier score to an across the board 4.75 (was 4.5 overall). With these beers, one can expect variations by vintage (neither the lambic nor the fruit will be the same) and quality also depends on cellaring time and conditions, but 2008 is delicious now and may be as good as it gets (until I get to try a newer vintage)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Suffice to say, this is a fun and lovely fruit lambic. At a decade old, there's still plenty of life in this bottle, a bottle which I plan to finish on my own tonight."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Spectacular fruited lambic from Cantillon and my personal favorite of the Lou Pepe beers. The raspberry is just so fresh and juicy and doesn't really need any support from other flavors to make this a spectacular beer, a great celebration of raspberry."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer could be great, but the over-carbonation in this bottle is really a problem, making it hard to serve and hard to taste until some extended, vigorous swirling gets most of the carbon dioxide out of solution. The smell is lovely and the taste is also very appealing once you can get to it, but the carbonation is just crazy."
""
"Pours a red color with a light pink head that fades quickly. The smell isn't very pleasing, kind of like raspberry farts. The taste is much better. I'm getting fruity vinegar notes with a very nice funk. There is an herbal note behind the fruit. The raspberries are good even after a couple of years."
""
"Blistering sourness, super puckering. Juicy raspberries make your mouth water before going completely bone dry. Nice and oaky, explodes with fruit. A fuller feel, with a slight spritz of carbonation, balanced acidity and a light hit of sharpness. Stable funk with soiled hay and washed rind farmhouse cheese. Just the right amount of nuance and equal parts sour fruit delivery system."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: By far the best bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise I've tried, though I've only had the beer a few times and mostly from older bottles. This was exceptional with a radical funky fruit presence. Highly recommended."
"O: Amazing beer. Worth getting."

"I normally don't like Framboises too much, but was really surprised by this one (probably the first time I've ever had it on a clean palate). Liked it better than the other LP beers and glad I still have a bottle left in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Nice snap of unripe raspberry/cranberry tartness. Lemon, some faint oak and a nice dryness on the finish with some cherry skin. Absolutely fantastic."
""
""
"Overall-- this is the best of the LP series. For my money though, this one isnt worth the infkated price over Rose de Gambrinus."
""
"O- A great framboise, it's massively sour, even for Cantillon, which I really like. This is probably the oldest fruit lambic I've had from Cantillon, who I know recommends drinking these young, but even a few years out this is drinking damn nicely."
""
""
""
"O: This isn't a fresh bottle, but it isn't exactly old either - I'm glad the fruit component is still bright. Plenty of funk in the nose, too. Awesome framboise."
"O- I like this beer more and more everytime I have it. I still think I prefer Lou Pepe Kriek in terms of Lou Pepe’s, but this is light years ahead of Rose."
""
"Pours a clear, red/pink color. 1/4 inch head of a pink color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of strong raspberries, tart yeast, slight dark citrus, sour notes, and slight earthiness. Fits the style of a Lambic - Fruit. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a low carbonation level. There is also a noticeable bitterness. Tastes of raspberries, tartness, pungent sour flavors, and also a strong tang. I had a hard time discerning what ingredients caused the basic flavors I tasted, but nonetheless it was an amazing brew."
""
""
"Overall, very nice. Certainly not my favourite beer from Cantillon, but a very good lambic."
"I approve wholeheartedly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Range from 4.0 to 5.0. Highlights included the fresh fruit of the 09, the intense sourness of the 02, and the still wonderful 01. Very fortunate to have been a part of this event. Thanks and happy b-day Mr. B."
""
"O-This is just about perfect. For days after drinking this, you'll be wanting it again. The bottle is best shared though, it's so sweet!"
""
"Beer pours a dark purplish ruby red with a fluffy pinkish-white head. The smell is fantastic - raspberries stand out most, but there's a nice mix of funk, sour and oak in there as well. The flavor is still good, but not quite as impressive as the nose. It's a bit simpler than I expected. The raspberry flavor is great, and it's quite sour, but there's not much funk or anything else happening here. It's not too sweet and comes off much drier than its little sister Rose de Gambrinus. Mouthfeel is thin with heavy carbonation, would've liked a little more body here. Overall, this is another fine beer from Cantillon, but I wouldn't rank this up there with the best of their lambics. I enjoyed it more than Rose de Gambrinus, but of the Lou Pepe beers, it's definitely the simplest. A good fruit lambic, but I don't know if I'd seek this out again given what it costs."
""
"O: More woody than fruity in this case, I prefer the Lou Pepe Kriek but this is still tasty."
"O: Extremely impressed at how well this held up. Saying I want more of this is obvious."
""
"O: Very drinkable. Cantillon pleasure"
""
"Simply phenomenal."
""
"I'm new to Cantillon, and to sours in general, but I've yet to find a loon I didn't enjoy. Another hit."
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, extremely dry and lingering on the tongue. This is a great example of how delicious and unique a Cantillon beer can be. I tried a small taste of a 2007 bottle right before this, and the sourness had definitely become amplified from the extra 2 years of age."
"O-This wasn't overally exciting for me. I am a bigger fan of the regular version."
"Overall this was good, but not great for me at the level of Saint Lamvinous or Fou Foune to be honest. While it is definitely still top class, I don't have the urge/need to seek this out again in the future. Maybe the reputation, expectations and/or the awesome aroma got me too hyped up here"
""
"Pours a simply gorgeous razzy red. Really lovely cherry blossom caps this one. Nose carries more funk than I'd anticipated, really the earthy aspect of Cantillon's arsenal. The raspberries come through acidic and sharp with hints of vinous shreds. Flavor carries surprising balance. The tartness and buxelles funk are soo well balanced with generous bounties of raspberries. The whole thing comes together and reminds me of a freshly picked raspberry during the high sun of an August day mixed with the grit of a solid days hike. A little full bodied with reserved carbonation accentuated the generous fruit endowment for the beer. Finish made me want another sip of the beer, and a gulp of ice cold water. Really a step up from the Rose, and I appreciate the attention to detail here."
""
""
"O - A light, sweet symphony on the tongue. Makes me think of strawberries and cream. Yum."
""
"A massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! 2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon taster flute. Poured a hazy ruby red with a one finger light pink head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, tart, funk, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, tart, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. To be honest, this was the first time I’ve tried this one. This one was really enjoyable and well balanced. While not being overly complicated this one made great use of the flavors and aromas present. No wonder I’m loony for these things…"
""
"Additional notes: Paired great with the Indian food, as the acidity cut through the creamy richness of the food and as the fruit and rustic character dealt great with the spicy, floral character of the food."
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent framboise. Would like to try an aged bottle to see where the tartness and funk end up."
""
"4.0 D: Tasty framboise. A bit hard to justify the price, but good for a special occasion, like a Pens playoff game."
"Pours a murky red with a reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. No real lacing on this one. Smell is of sour and tart raspberries and some funky aromas. Taste is the same with a nice tart finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think this one smells better than it tastes."
"O: I love framboise, but this is far and away the best framboise beer I've ever had. My new benchmark for framboise lambic. Absolutely wonderful."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Arguably the most sour Lou Pepe in the lineup, and hands down the best framboise I've had to date. Can't wait to get my hands on another bottle!"
""
""
""
"O- what can I say, it's a Lou pepe. It's great, if you can get a bottle or two, you should. Is it my favourite Cantillon? No. That would probably be the Iris, but this is a great beer. It ages well, it pairs well with food and I will never turn down a glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was nice. It had a bit more of a Lambic funkiness to it than I expected but that fresh raspberry flavor and a lively body really kept this energetic feeling in the taste and feel despite the assertiveness of the flavors at times. This is another Cantillon well worth checking out."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a really fantastic beer, and another winner from Cantillon. First bottle I've ever had, but the '06 is drinking perfect right now. I think I prefer the Lou Pepe Kriek a little more, but would jump at the chance to buy this one. Would love to have it again."
""
""
"Overall. Just awesome. Perfect with the eggs benedict we had for breakfast. Refreshing, sour, just enough funk. Good call on choosing this one, if I do say so myself."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with very high carbonation, great mouthfeel and spot on for the style. Overall, a great fruit beer. Very sour all in all, but complex at the same time. Will definitely look to get ahold of another bottle of this."
""
"very good, better than the rose de gambrinus for sure. a solid framboise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" This blitzes the palate and mouth with both fruity sweet taste and very intense sour lactic infused flavor. The acidity intensifies as the beer is held in the mouth but there is enough sweetness in the flavor to balance from the full fruity raspberry enhancement. The taste comes off almost as bitter/spicy from the carbonic acid the high carbonation level provides. There is a puckering, mouth drying quality w/ slight woodiness and extra tart raspberry juiciness as it finishes with some residual berry, but the funk and bacteria sour flavors linger into the dry end. Simply a wonderful fruit lambic, not many out there that are this complex and able to be savored in the way I found this to be. Intense yet drinkable a true classic, one of the best I have ever had."

"This is a light bodied brew with a lively level of high carbonation that is not over-done. For being several years old at this point and in the bottle for more than a year, I found this brew smelling/tasting exceptionally bright and refreshing. I really enjoyed the other Lou Pepe's both on tap and in bottles when I had them, but this came across even more appealing to me. I need more of this brew!"

"Overall – Unbelievable. One of the best Cantillon’s I’ve had. I really don’t know what made this beer develop as it did but I now want to go buy a ton of this and sit on them for years to hope they become as they did here. I will admit, despite it only being 5% abv, I don’t know if I could finish a bottle of this myself because it was so tart and acidic. But wow, very impressed with this one."
"O- Awesome beer. My first framboise and what a great one! I'll be locating some more asap."
"Bottle. F’ing semi old bottle. Cork 04 date. Pours a rich red color with a light pink head. The smell is a pungent, musty, dusty raspberry. The smell is either really good cheese or really bad meat. Tanic and basement like. The taste is very funky and intense. Acidic, lemon, funk, and fruit. Really glad I got to taste this. The sourness sticks around for a while after your finish your drink."
"D - really solid framboise. Even with age on it the raspberries popped like crazy. I really enjoyed the added level of citric tones and subtle hints of funk thrown behind the raspberries. This makes we want to try the other Lou Pepes that much more."
"O - I am in ore of Cantillon for producing beers like this with such incredible depth and flavour."
"I was a bit put off initially by the nose profile but lying behind it is a delicious, drinkable and complex beer. I would love to get more of this."
"Overall - an outstanding beer. Top notch."
"Overall: I am a sucker for good raspberry sours, and this is probably my favorite one at this point. Simply fantastic, I would like to always have this in my fridge, and my future beer purchases will probably reflect that desire."
"4, 4, 4, 4, 4.5"
"Recently had the 2008 Version and i enjoyed the freshness of the beer more so than the aged version. Love the fresh raspberries that come out, really easy drinking, nice tartness and funk."
"Drink- 1 word. Amazing."
"Overall, this was a great beer. It was amazingly sour and tart. So mouth-watering. A very well done beer. Cantiloon has done it again!"
"O - I thought both 2001 and 2002 were pretty close, taste wise. I didn't prefer one over the other, both were excellent. I'll have to open a more recent vintage and compare. A must-try."
"Overall: As full a drinking experience as you expect from aged Cantillon. Excellent beer."
"I'm still a little confused by the style but I'm enjoying this learning experience"
"O: Crazy sour and very dry but somehow extremely drinkable in the only way a Cantillon beer can. No one does it better. Thanks again for sharing, Chad."
"Yes, lovely. The fruit is just right in this one, and the Cantillon acidity is slightly more restrained. Gorgeous."
"O: Cantillon gives me an interesting framboise, but not one that's really that good. Earthiness instead of sweetness? Sounds fine to me; leather in the nose? Awesome....but this is a framboise where raspberries should reign supreme. The raspberries may have reigned over this bottle at some point, but honestly the sensations of tartness and eventually sourness overwhelmed a subtle berry note. The beer looks and feels of quality; it even smelled of a promising interpretation. However, the taste ultimately is dominated by sensations rather than flavors. Perhaps my bottle wasn't the best, but it was by no means compromised beyond reason. If I was to just see someone drinking this beer I'd have been infinitely jealous; having tasted it: not so much. The visual and smells keep this in the realm of respectability."
"O: Though my fears allayed as the beer warmed up, I did pick up this bottle at a beer shop in london that didn't seem to know anything about cantillon, much less beer in genral, and I can't account for the care that they or anyone else handled this and whether or not the bottle may have been compromised in some way. I will say simply that tart raspberry with a handful of other punching notes is about all I experienced with this beer and it wasn't as complex, sweet, or flavorful as I expected. If it's what the beer is intended to be, then great, it was good. If not and my bottle was compromised, then the beer must be damned amazing because that's the best compromise I've had."
"D - Yet another winner from Cantillon. Complex, refreshing and hugely well crafted."
"Poured hazy purple color with an average fizzy purple head that lasted with good lacing. Good tart raspberry & yeast aroma. Medium body with tingly texture and flat carbonation. Moderate raspberry tar fruit flavor with a solid tart fruit and small alcohol bite finish of moderate to long duration. Very good beer."
"9.9/10"
"many thanks to whoever shared this at the alewatcher/oreo tasting."
"O: Best I have had, ever."
"Wonderful!"
"Overall: Fantastic. This is my idea of a perfect sour at the top of my list. Hope to find a bottle."
"O- to say this brew is one dimensional is all wrong. Its powerful and confrontational in flavor but very pure and to the point. Massively sour and fruity with all funk playing second fiddle but in a good way. Each and every time I have this beer I'm blown away by it."
"Joe was kind enough to share a bottle of the 2002 vintage (bottled in 2004). Light, this is a clear amber and is lightly carbonated. The nose has rotting, overripe raspberries and nail polish remover. Not much funk, there's some pie-like cooked fruit character, mildly jammy. The palate opens super sour, definitely too much so. Not really acetic or lactic, is this what an excess of malic acid tastes like, but it is unpleasant. Light in carbonation, this is too sour in my book. 3.5/3/2.5/3/2.5"
"O - Top notch. I've been learning to appreciate sour beers like Consecration. This is even more sour but it is so good, there's no break-in period. I'm giving it an A, my wife would give it an A+ because it is right in her wheelhouse."
"I don't know what it is about raspberries that make them seemingly poor fruits for aging with bugs for a long time, but this was the second year in a row that the raspberry sour (V006 last year) or lambic was the disappointment of the tasting. I would like to review this fresh, as I imagine that how it is meant to be consumed."
"I've enjoyed LP Framboise up until the three year mark, but I always enjoy a fresh bottle of LP for the vibrant fruit character. Unbelievably juicy."
"Enjoyed this one much more than the Kriek, perhaps the raspberries marry better with the style and blending a bit more based on their inherent nature. Definitely one to pick up if it's available, the fruit does this one justice."
"A lambic with an inherent tartness that is so full, and yet blended, that I can't really apologize for the difficulty in readily discerning other flavours, i.e. the fruit, which is generally more inferred, than directly tasted. If I wasn't such a fan of sour, spicy, and/or tart characteristics, I don't think I could see how this offering might score so high. However, I am, and it surely does."
"2007 bottle. Clear bright red, medium head. Nose is tightly woven brett, fresh raspberries. Very juicy as with most Cantillon fruit lambics. Mouth is very tight, refined, juicy raspberries, acidity, and barnyard brett. Acidity is mostly on the front end and not on the finish. The high acidity makes this much less attractive than the Lou Pepe Kriek from the same year. I'm thinking it's just really difficult to make a raspberry lambic or raspberry sour without it being acidic over a couple years."
"Great beer. Recommended for any fan of lambic."
"Not only one of the best sours I have ever tried, this is one of the best beers I have had period. It more than lived up to the hype. Well worth the $29 I paid for the bottle and I would buy another bottle again in a heartbeat."
"This is very drinkable for the style. The tartness of the beer goes perfect with the fruit flavor. Highly recommended."
"DB- Great raspberry flavor but especially aroma. The vinegar is there but enjoyable. Hard to resist a Cantillon vintage, almost always going to be a great experience."
"Although very enjoyable, this has to be the most sour beer I've had, as I've heard of the Lou Pepe series."
"Overall this is an absolutely stunning, world class beer. Supremely balanced with a nice level of sourness that satisfies my craving without giving me rot gut. Huge fruitiness despite sitting 2 years in the bottle. Like with most Cantillons, a 750ML bottle needs to be split at least 2 ways so I really wish this one was available in 375's. Oh well. A beer this special needs a friend to share it with anyway."
"Served: June 24, 2010"
"D: Right before my son Thomas tasted it, he said, ""I have a feeling i'm gonna really like this one."" He took a sip and the face he made was priceless, just pure sourness. He said it was awful, but then said ""wow, that was bad but also very good. I think I'll take another sip."" perfect description."
"d: Not much else to say about such a great beer except, the heart-burn is totaly worth it."
"overall - phenomenal. I absolutely love this beer. The only downside is the nose, but I assume that is partially due to the age. I went and picked up an '07 soon after. Then BenC hooked me up with a '04 and an '03!"
"This beer is truly excellent. While definitely tart, I would not say that it is incredibly sour. Lou Pepe Framboise is extremely drinkable, and has a much milder acetic finish than the Rosé de Gambrinus. Very pleasant lingering tart raspberry aftertaste. A terrific offering from a fabulous brewery."
"Pours a nice ruby with a pink head. Clearer than most lambics. Nose of heavy leather and cherry, cranberry, and strawberry, with tropical notes. I know it has raspberry in it, but I'm just not getting that on the palate. Doesn't matter though; this beer is delicious. Starts with a citrusy strawberry flavor. A slight hint of sweetness enters, and leads to a tart jolly rancher finish."
"D: Top notch. The Lou Pepe fruit lambics never fail me."
"An excellent aged framboise, but there is room for improvement. Perhaps it needs more time to cellar (or maybe it is better when very fresh)?"
"Beer is very tart and not as acetic as I thought it was going to be, this is probably a good thing but the acetic character would likely grow over time slightly. There is nice raspberry flavors and good fruit tartness at the back. Some lactic notes and a slightly tannic quality overall as well. Nice carbonation in the mouth and highly drinkable. This could be one of my favorite Cantillons so far."
"Dont know why i decided to crack this tonight out of all nights but just felt like it for some reason its a 750ml corked/capped/caged bottle that states it is 2006 vintage,it pours a beautiful cherry,rose hue with nice carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and little lacing,the aroma is so strong and pungent its not funny with sweet cherries,raspberries,strawberries and hay all on display in the aroma very nice i like it,and on taste its alot the same which starts out with a spritzy/mineral water mouthfeel which is beautifully suited to the style with tastes of ripe raspberries and cherries and it finishes with a very sour mouthpuckering feel to be expected and to be quite honest i like it i mean im gonna easily finish this bottle but if i had another bottle i wouldnt crack it tonight,overall a beautiful example of the style that i respect and i think really highlights the raspberry qualities perfectly."
"(D)- One of the most sour beers I have ever had; but it is very good. A huge sour kick with some good fruits; a funkiness that I appreciated & enjoyed. One of the better lambics I have ever had. Now I need to try the Kriek. Cantillon knows their sours!"
"This is certainly one of the more acidic lambics though I don't really expect anything less from Cantillon. This one is full of woody barrel which adds a really nice dimension to the tart raspberries, lemon pucker and a hint of grapes. Some nice funk that plays with your stomach later, not a ton of carbonation but ample, a real sipper. I rate it a little less drinkable simply due to the acidic nature."
"D-this is tasty and tart, nice flavors and lots of raspberries. Great Brew"
"D- This is a great lambic. I wish I would have gotten into Cantillon earlier! This is a great sour that offers lots of authentic raspberry flavors and is quite tart."
"Pours a stunning ruby red. Taste offers tart raspberry with a touch of oak on the finish. There was little chance of this disappointing and it assuredly didn't. While I prefer the LP Kriek to this, it's tough to imagine a framboise getting much better."
"Pours a brilliant deep red, with a thin head. The beer is actually surprisingly clear for a lambic, but otherwise, it looks like I would expect it to. The smell is all fruit. Sweet fruit, candy like, maybe a bit of tartness, but almost reminds me of a fruit soda. Very nice - though sometimes you don't mind the smell of garbage in a wild ale. The flavor comes across first as tart and acidic, but it has a nice sweetness to balance. The flavor in some ways reminds me of raspberry-lime juice, if there were such a thing, also a slight sourness that is really nice, like sour candy. The taste is just surprisingly clean for a wild ale, just a nice blend of sweet and tart, with the flavor of fruit, just amazingly balanced. The bo dy is a little fuller than I expected, probably from the sweet fruit juice, and the carbonation is low, but you can tell that it's there. Fairly nice. This is really a nice beer, the sourness is there in it's fullness, but it is just held in balance with the beautiful blending and the addition of fruit. It's not too acidic, and doesn't remind you of garbage, it's just a great lambic. Really a joy to drink."
"There's lots of carbonation, otherwise a light body similar to many other lambics. Not sure how much of the puckering tartness is due to age or the particular year it was made, so I'll be getting this again as a newer year sometime to try it again."
"Upending the bottle, I expect to see whole raspberries in suspension. Nope, just yeast porridge. I drink it anyway."
"D - nice pleasant lambic. Fairly uniform - not used to paying high prices for beers without tons of complexity - but I guess Cantillon is worth it once in awhile."
"750ml (thanks to mrkanable) with 2005 on the neck and a bottling date in 2007. i was excited about this beer but the moment I smelled it I was disappointed. I have never smelled a beer this bad and I love funky lambics. This was not cheesy, it was not barnyard, it was not even horse-piss. This was rancid and putrid garbage. I think this was the worst beer I have ever smelled. The beer looked good, it was a cloudy reddish color. The taste was oddly pretty good despite the vomit and trash smell. I tasted funky lambic and raspberries like I expected. This was alsoa little more acidic that I would like but the smell is what killed the experience. I need to get a fresh bottle."
"Great drinkability. Kept me wanting more of it. This is a hell of a fruit lambic, easily one of the best I've ever had."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Low abv, very complex, and an all-around nice sipper."
"Please, for the love of god, share this beer with friends. This is a beer that should be enjoyed by the glass. Don't attempt to ""man up"" and consume this bottle by yourself. The results could be...troubling."
"D: I would like to try this beer again, perhaps in a fresher state. This is certainly a very nice lambic, even with a fading fruit character."
"This is a nicely done, complex lambic. Its not my favourite on the basis that some of the flavours simply don't jive so well with me, and at times it almost comes across as harsh. That said, a good experience, and another winner from Cantillon!"
"Consumed: 1/29/2010"
"D: Not drinkable in the traditional sense as the flavors here are again... overwhelming. However, enjoyable and quite complex. Every bit worth seeking out and sampling."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation, and is extremely sour and puckering from the flavors described above. A sipper from the complex flavors and sour/funkiness, but not alcohol presence, and pleasant bursts of sweetness make this an exceptional lambic."
"This is a sipper..."
"D - It can be difficult to drink one of these alone, even though it's pretty weak ABV-wise, due to the intensity of the sour flavor. Aside from the low ABV, it kinda feels like I'm drinking a whole bottle of Merlot. While this is certainly a top-shelf lambic - and I rate accordingly - I think I prefer the Kriek."
"D - Not a session beer, but interesting and worth revisiting occasionally."
"D: A spectacular brew, among the best of the Cantillon line."
"drinkability is good. very sour, but the acidity is somewhat restrained. great depth and complexity too. i liked this one a lot. no mistaking that it's a cantillon, definitely more sour than most, but i like that end of the spectrum. good stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, feels a bit thicker than most Cantillon, but this one is wickedly tart. Great stuff."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I would seek this out and cellar it for up 20 years as recommended on the bottle."
"D: Out of the 3 Lou Pepes I opened, this was our least favorite. An excellent and complex flavor, but more austerely dry than any of us really preferred. I'd get it again but I would pair it with food."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, but I prefer the Kriek version (although this is better than Rose de Gambrinus, which I find to be a bit thin/watery). This one is a slow sipper."
"D: Good. Very drinkable. However, it seems to lack complexity and is slightly to clean in character. It seems ""young", which isn't that weird since this bottle was only a couple of months old. Would probably be way better in a year or so."
"Out of a corked, capped, and foiled bottle, 2006 vintage. Pours a dirty plum purple color with fizzy pale pink colored head that settled into a solid ring. The aroma is of raspberry puree with some light oak and lemon. Nice and fruity, wine like. The taste is of unripe raspberries and lemon, white vinegar, pepper, and oak. Very much a tart bomb. The feel is light and very carbonated; very tart and astringent. For folks that love tart bombs and very dry brews this is an A++ but it's just not my thing. I rated mouthfeel and drinkability at a 3 because of this."
"Make sure you have folks that like lambics around to split this with. It is way too tart to take on alone!"
"Overall, a great example of the style and a wonderful brew."
"D - Very nice indeed. Would drink again on special occasions."
"About as good as a traditional fruit lambic can be. Amazingly complex but very hard to drink."
"M&D- The feel is light bodied and sour with some slight acidity. The tastes stay with you for a bit. I can't help to pucker a bit when drinking this, but that's why I drink these type beers here. Carb level is perfect in this well crafted beer/lambik. Well I had one tulip and could easily go for another, but with the high level of bacteria in this, my stomach would not thank me."
"Overall - I imagine I would enjoy the Kriek more than this. Pretty impressive nonetheless."
"D - Good really nice would drink a bunch if the price was a bit less but beautiful none the less."
"Drinkability is great, this beer is the bomb. I love raspberries, and I love Cantillon, and I love this framboise. While not the sourest beer in their portfolio, and very fruit forward for a Cantillon, it still bring the pucker with loads of acidity. Super tasty, a rare treat on draught, I wish this was available year round!"
"Beautifully well crafted and very in-depth. Possibly a bit too much for my palate to take at the moment, but easily more drinkable then a straight out geuze. A lot leaner and subtler then expected. I would like to put one away for a few years, see how it goes."
"Drinkability- Probably the best frambois I will ever have in my life, smooth, tart, lightly tingling on the lips, something I would love to have every day and I'm not the fruit beer guy. Sadly, I will likely never see it again. I need to go to Belgium!"
"Looking forward to my trip to Belgium this summer..."
"I've taken a shine to the Cantillon lambics on tap ever since experiencing Fou Fonne at Deep Ellum. This one is just as enjoyable - maybe even a little more fruit character. Sure, it's tight and the funk and acidity slow it down a little bit, but who's to argue that this isn't one of the best?"
"I enjoyed this brew outside, on the patio, after spending a few hours tending to the lawn. It's an amazingly refreshing and complex thirst-quencher. It's also the kind of framboise that you can just sit and sip, slowly enjoying it. The beer pours a deep, dark, but clear red. Although it pours with a slight head, it quickly disappears. The beautiful color and clarity, however, more than make up for the head...great appearance. The aroma is a great mix of raspberries and sour funk. Horse-stall, sweaty, earthy, musty aromas mix with just-picked berries. At least half of the fun of this beer is the smell. The sourness in the taste is very strong, but not overdone. Mouthpuckering and intense, but balanced with some fruit flavors. The barnyard character comes through in the taste as well. I love these lambics that don't ruin the experience with sweetness. Perfect to sit and sip. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the drinkability on this one is fantastic."
"Very dry yet full body has an acidic finish. Perfect carbonation enhances every flavor. Perfect blend of fresh raspberries and the usual Cantillon funk. One of the best offering from Cantillon thus far."
"Very carbonated, crisp, light bodied. Delicious."
"A highly drinkable beer, if you can find it. Great to share."
"We had this beer at the bar in Binny's - South Loop, Chicago. As noted, it was the last of the keg, but it was still excellent."
"I'm generally not huge of lambic fruit beers (but love the non-fruit variety). I enjoyed this one a lot, though."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and lively."
"This is not a beer that I would want to have every day or one I would want to consume in great quantities. I very much enjoyed this - more than I would have anticipated - and am hoping to explore a bit more of this style. Absolutely give this beer a try if you see it."
"Very enjoyable."
"Notes from: 12/21/07."
"7/4/7/3/15 (3.6/5)"
"This one did not do it for me like the Lou Pepe Kriek did. The subtle complexities that are in the Kriek are almost gone here. What is here is raspberries, sourness, and funk. Not that that is bad, just not the masterpiece the Kriek is."
"D - Not as complex as other Cantillon offerings I have had but still tasty."
"It was very nice to be able to try this on tap."
"The bottle says 2002, and the cork says bottled in 2004. Pours a beautiful reddish orange with good clarity as long as you avoid the accumulated sludge in the bottom of the bottle. Sour and barnyard aromas intertwined with delicate raspberries are what you notice when you take a whiff. Personally, I like the depth that the kriek has, since I think it hold up better to the sourness, but this is very nice as well. The raspberries are somewhat light, but very acetic and the barnyard notes are just right- wonderful, they are there withouth being overwhelming and add a complex note to the aroma. The taste is extremely tart, maybe too much so. I would like to see some more fruitiness to balance the extreme acidity. Even so, the raspberry notes are laser-like in intensity, and to be fair there is an initial burst of fruit, and a savory, sour creaminess at the end. The mouthfeel is brilliantly sharp and tart followed by a soft, salty, creaminess. This is a little challenging- definitely a sipper, but fascinating."
"M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is heavy. A beer to be sipped, the sourness can be too much, but with low alcohol it's certainly one that can be had in larger quantities over a long period of time."
"Drinkability is high here If I could get more!"
"Not surprisingly, the taste features assertive, puckering sourness. It is a little overwhelming at first, but after a few sips, other flavors make themselves known. Tart fruit, raspberry and grapefruit, and a slightly metallic hay taste. Acidic sourness clearly dominates and makes for a very dry, refreshing palate. Raspberry seeds mix with lemon juice in the finish. Medium bodied with a tickle-y feel."
"Drinkability is limited by your enjoyment of tart. I really liked this brew."
"D: This is certainly a sipper, but I'm going to have no problem taking down this champagne bottle on my own, especially given the light ABV. Beyond that, I think many would be soured out and up for something sweet."
"2001 vintage, consumed with oakbluff. Translucent pink-gold in colour, with spritzy carbonation. Aromas of raspberry, rose, funk, earth, and nettles. Flavors consist of more raspberry, lemon zest, and a bit of lactic funk on the finish. Wickedly acidic! It practically burned going down, but was so refreshing and tasty. Near perfect for someone like me who can't get enough sour/acidic flavors. I'm going to need to track down more of this stuff."
"Poured into a wine glass deep, clear red grape color with almost no head. Aroma is sour funk and lots of raspberry's. Taste is raspberry and funk. Quite acidic, a most puckering experience. Crisp carbonation. I really liked this one, but its not for the faint of heart as the sourness of this one was intense."
"Taste is similiar to smell- lots o fsweet rasberry with the tartness of sour fruits as well. Little bit of red wine flavor as well. Quite refreshing, though. Little bit of spritz in there. Not as hardcore as I thought. Very good."
"T/M/D - very tart, not too sweet but not too dry, with a delicate taste of raspberry (not as noticeable as in the smell, and far from syrupy - typical of Cantillon). The sourness lingers for a bit too, enough to entice another sip. Outstanding, if you like your lambics nice and tart!"
"2001 Vintage. Bottle graciously shared by piscator. What a treat! Pours a beautiful rose colour, good clarity and one finger head. Nose- blast of raspberry and lemon zest. Taste- exceptionally acidic, raspberry of course, citric, and general funk. Not too dry, nice carbonation. Keeps zinging the pallette long after.. Fantastic!"
"A WOW beer for me. I'm not a big ""fruited"" beer person, I believe this is packed with cherries and or other things though this was debated at Hamiltons. Amazing red and pink color, some froth, and sparkle to it. Intriguing how it hit the palate, sizzles, then poof dissapears, then a drawn out mineral, sour and balanced finished. The back of a bottle notes the beer can be enjoyable for 20+ years? I'd love to try a 1988 bottle! Luckly found some and will be aging them. A real treat."
"Very refreshing drink I had this as a desert brew as my wife and kids shopped for me for fathers day I really am getting into these sours as a summertime brew and this brew is one I will be revisiting soon"
"Drinkability: Not very good. This is a tough one to drink. The acid really gets to my tongue and throat in a much bigger way than most lambics have. I wouldn't want to many of these but again, this could be very different with a bottled version."
"Pours a hazed ruby. Nose is funk. Flavor is sour indeed, but I find it more one-dimensional than I recall the Lou Pepe Kriek being. It's tart, it's slightly fruity, and that's about it. Carbonation has a bit of a bite to it. This is nice and drinkable, yes. You've gotta be ready for the lambic qualities (the sour) to enjoy it best. And like I said it's not quite complex like the Lou Pepe Kriek."
"Taste/mouthfeel: An exceptional tart raspberry flavor is the first thing that hits the palate with some buggy undertones beneath it. Bone-dry throughout, the sourness and acidity are strong but quite palatable. Raspberries come out even more in the finish, lingering on the tongue for several minutes between sips. The acidity does become a bit stomach-churning after a while with this one, which knocks it down a bit compared to many of Cantillon's other beers. A top notch framboise all the same."
"2004(label), 2006(cork) vintage courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep reddish color lambic with a nice white color bubbly head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of raspberry is dominant with some sour notes as well as some barnyard notes and a weird cough syrup-like finish. Taste is dry with some notes of sour raspberry and some limited acidic notes which I appreciated since I usually find the Cantillon lambic a bit too acid. Full body with some great carbonation. I thought this was really good but I good have done without the weird raspberry syrup-like aftertaste."
"Pours a deep berry colored beer with a short pink head. Potent aroma of fresh tart raspberries over a bit of lemon and cotton candy. Tart, sour flavor. Mostly lemon up front with mildly sour raspberries towards the finish. This is definitely a sipper, unless you normally suck on lemons. Can sour go in the mouthfeel too? Besides sour there isn't any carbonation and the body is well... average? It's hard to say. It's a Lambic with raspberries, and I think the raspberries make it more drinkable. It's really hard to assign numbers to this one so take them with a grain of salt."
"I had to pass off the chalice after a few sips. It took several pieces of water crackers and a glass of water to cleanse my mouth. Probably good for cleaning stuff. Disappointing since I love everything else I have had from Cantillon."
"D: A good lambic from Cantillon, didn't wow me like I expected it to, but a solid effort, would make an interesting dessert pairing."
"One of the most intensely flavorful lambics I've had."
"Overall I thought this was a really nice brew. I have been getting into these more exotic belgians and this one just furthered my curiousity to delve further into them. It was a bit differnet then anything I had of the style before and this was a nice welcomed change. I would love to try this one again, though it is a tad pricey so we shall see."
"Drinkability: Not an every day drinker by any means. This beer would best be served as an aperitif or perhaps a digestif depending on the meal and courses. This beer would get consumed more if it weren't for the heavy price tag."
"The first half of the bottle pours a clear, resonant, cherry juice brown, capped by a fizzy, sputtering head that dies away immediately like cola. Amazing color, very pretty. The remaining pours get steadily hazier, until the last dregs are an opaque, purplish, brick red mud. I wasn't that brave. The aroma is bitingly acidic, lightly tinted with raspberry essence. Funky and wild, with notes of aged swiss cheese and crabapple. Very complex and farmy. The flavor is immediately and unequivocally tart. Sour with just the slightest bit of give to keep your eyes from watering. The raspberry flavor comes through mostly in the end. It's sort of a raspberry apology for what your tastebuds just went through. Funky and wild through and through, very acidic with little in the way of sweetness or bitterness. Moldy and bacterial, with light cheesy sharpness and vinegar notes. Light on the tongue, with fizzy, energetic carbonation that carries the flavors well. Very challenging and unique. Delicious, but the sourness gets almost painful after half a bottle. Funny, because I recall easily splitting a bottle of the Fou'foune with the old lady, and that's one of their most intense. Something to share with a couple friends. Hopefully they chip in on the big pricetag, too!"
"Sampled on tap at Monk's Cafe before their New Belgium dinner. The beer poured a hazy bright red color with a slight carbonated body and a dull pink head. The nose was nice and funky as expected with some fresh raspberry notes. The taste was one of those nice pucker up tart tastes to be expected for a gem like Cantillon. The raspberries tasted so real and refreshing. Despite the tartness, this was a very easy drinking beer and had a nice peppery taste on the back end."
"The guy I was with insisted on trying it, and far be it from me to dissuade him. The instant response was no way, this is not my kind of beer. My wife didn't like it. Some guy I didn't know asked me how I can drink it. I replied, with relish. More for me, lads and lassies, and for anyone who wants to enjoy a sour fruity back-to-the-soil basicness that gives a good lambic its soul. Granted, it takes a couple glasses of water to get my cheeks puffed back out where they belong, but what a wonderful sipper this is. Sure, it's not for everyone, but it is for me."
"D - Wonderfull beer, I had it by itself but it seems like it would be a great match for just about any dessert. That being said, it is hard to imagine drinking more than one glass of this beer."
"Cheers!"
"Tastes.. YEE OW! Calm start, the candied raspberries of the nose. But then the back is this wonderful kick of sour deathfunk yeast and perfectly permented sweet and sour fruit and big bursts of heaven. Wonderful."
"D: An exercise in true lambic but a little too acidic for my palate. I bet if I spent more time with Cantillon lambics I would see a gradual acceptance of the sourness."
"This is a fanastic fruit lambic. Very fruity and very tart. If Cantillon Kriek and RDG are too sour, maybe you'd like this more."
"Overall drinkability is dependant on your predilection toward the super sour fruit taste and tolerance for the slightly funky smell and acid bitterness. If you like it sour then this will hit the spot."
"D: A lot like the other Cantillons. Very good lambic."
"Overall: An excellent lambic. The fruitiness is much more evident in this beer than in other Cantillon beers that I've had."
"D-The complexity and strong flavors of this one definately lend themselves to moderation"
"This one is very yummy. It pours a blood red with a quickly receding head. I love the classicl Cantillon absurd tartness, but I also dig the way the rasperry flavor lingers in the mouth. It is obviously very sour, but also a very enjoyable drink."
"Draught @ DBA in New York City. Deep cranberry red color, with a lightish pink head. Extremely rich, authentic and elegant raspberry aroma, with an apple core aroma underneath. Upon tasting, it had a very unpleasant and distracting apple like lambic character in the blend, which to me, showed more applely lambic flavor, than raspberry fruit. Im a lambic beginner, but it just seemed well, not very complex. Just like the Lou Pepe Kriek, I wish an older blend was used (rather than just two year), yielding more tartness, but my biggest complaint is the flavor of the lambic blend, not the fruit."
"I had this beer when it was first released but have no clear memory of it - but at this point, owning none myself, drinking it in a place such as monk's may be the only option, temperature mishandling and all."
"Light body. Very drinkable."
"Taste: A bit more fruity than a kriek, but the difference is almost negligible. The acidity beats up your tongue and bullies your taste buds for it's lunch money. Like the Parliament Funkadelic is jamming in my mouth!"
"Good with butter-seared crotin cheese on a bed of wilted greens and smoked fish."
"Enjoyed as a 4oz sample at the Belgian Beer Fest 2004. They were out of Gueuze, so this was sampled instead. Man, I'm glad I did. My first TRUE fruit lambic! Pours a unique, glowing, deep, opaque red. Amazingly deep red! No head, very light carbonation, despite being on draft. Regardless, a beautiful beer. Smell is sweet and of raspberries. Taste is remarkably sour, bold, tangy, and almost uniformly raspberry flavored.Though I lack a deep base knowledge for comparison, I was told this is one of the best fruit lambics, and I believe it. Truly excellent."
"A beautiful beer. Framboises are my favorite fruit lambics, and this example is one of the best."
"Cloudy beautiful pink, with real raspberries. Cider-like aroma and no barnyard. Great sediment of more sour at bottom of bottle. Very smooth drink, hard to gulp down although I gave it a college effort. 2001 vintage. Must be shared. Seems richer than 5%. A very special unique beverage as my two pals concurred."
"Overall: Of all the fruit-lambics, Framboise never seems to get a serious look in, its the more ""Girlie"" of the commercial fruity beers & is easily misunderstood as a 'Liquid Panty Remover' when essence or syrup is used - yet when the real deal fruit is used in a truly authentic lambic, it produces an incredibly dry offering that is the anti-thesis of the more commercial sweet Liquid Panty Removers that are out there. Raspberries will never give the overall satisfying feel that Cherries will I feel; due to their more restrained profile, but don't underestimate the bite of a traditional Framboise for the sweet sickly crap that you may have had previously. Along with Drie Fonteinen Framboise  this is the Premiere offering of its ilk. F'in Fantastic!!"
"This beer poured a hazy light red color with just the faintest of faint offwhite ruby heads leaving no lace on the glass. Aromas are pungent and tart, with raspberry being just noticeable in the picture along with horseblanket barnyard funk. The initially flavor to this brew is quite acidic and tart, which is overlapped on top of a bed of faint raspberry flavors. Some other fruity tones make their way into the picture but are mostly overwhelmed by the beautiful lambic tart and sour notes. This brew is fairly light bodied but just full of flavor with only a slight carbonation. Considering I had 3 of these magnificent brews while at the Moan I would have to rate the drinkablity of beer to be top notch. A great offering from Cantillon and just amazing that it was on draft at the Dove."
"Still tasty as hell."
"Oh man, I could drink this all day! I love raspberries and this just hit the spot dead-on for me. On-tap, Cantillon's Lou Pepe Framboise is aces."
"Bloody light red, very thin pink head. Aroma is extremely barnyardy, like when you pick raspberries in a field where cows have passed and left their ""trace"". Lactic sour yogurt past its prime, mild cask wood. Very fruity acidic palate, citric, lactic with definite blood oranges flavors. I think Id like it better if it was more sour. Cask wood flavors, while there, seems also a bit restrained to me. Medium carbonation, medium bodied. Those beers are great, no doubt about it, but I guess its the oak and fruit focus that makes the difference between a great beer and an exceptional one. Lou pepe framboise, while very complex and apparently well blended doesnt strike to me as the perfect blend of complexity and focus. I had greatly anticipated this beer for a long time and stand disappointed though, its fairly similar to the lou pepe kriek and while being authentic and a quality product, just doesnt appear to me even as a top shelf framboise and how many of those are there? Thanks Martin!"
"Beautifully carbonated, and a lovely mouthfeel. As easy to drink as any Cantillon, although the transition between the richness of the nose and the typicity of the palate is a bit distracting."

"Appearance: Ruby red pink tone with a light whitish pink head leaves some lacing scattered and fine. Aroma: Sour notes of acidic quality, funky wild aromatics with cat pee and horse blanket farmhouse characteristics with a raspberry fruit backbone. Taste: Puckering even more so than most Cantillons I've tried, raspberry sweetness shows up somewhere in there funky edge yeasty note, I know this style is an artform but damn this one is wild. Spontaneous fermentation at it's best hits the palate with a barrage of sour notes but with each sip it grows on you. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied spritzy carbonation world class lambic. Drinkability: One bottle by yourself would be a venture, but I recommend sharing it with beer loving friends or somewhat educated about this tradition style. This one could possibly send a newbie running."
"Overall: Expensive? Yes!, but oh-so worth it at least once. At $30 a bottle, this beer is quite pricy, and hard to find...but you should still really try to get some. As the fruit is the main attraction in this one, the fresher your bottle is, the better! Man, oh man do I hope that I can sample some of this fresh at the brewery next week! Please Jean-Pierre, put some aside for me!"
"This beer definitely expresses the raspberry character more than the Rose De Gambrinus, though this is still quite dry so that the fruit can be hard to pick up if you don't know what to look for. I really like how the acidity pairs with the fruit character. This is a very well integrated beer, no one element overpowers the other."
"Poured a muddy reddish-brown with a ring of off-white with a hint of pink head around the edge of the glass. Smell has hints of vinegar, wet horse blanket, earthy barnyard smells. Taste is very tart, with a hint of raspberry. The sourness is very strong and overpowers the tongue, crosswiring ""sour"" with ""salty"". Hints of raspberries stay throughout the drink. Has a malted vinegar character to it, but every time you breathe in after swallowing, there is the raspberries all over again. The mouthfeel is very bubbly and stimulating, light and refreshing. This is one tasty beer, and my first ""real"" lambic - I'm hooked!"
"A bit of a flat mouthfeel though more than easy enough to drink. A stellar framboise, I've never had one this good."
"I consider myself fortunate any time I get Cantillion on tap and this was another one of those occasions.This beer was quite cloudy, as it should be. There was definitely a nice dark raspberry hue to the beer, also to be expected. The fragrance definitely contained the expected yeasty aromas with the sweet/tartness of the raspberries, also VERY good things in my book! I have come to anticipate a certain character from Cantillion and I was definitely not let down. The taste was as wonderful as I had hoped. Nice yeastiness to it as well as a delicate raspberry taste. The only reason it did not do better in the drinkability is because I may only want one, but would savour it as I did have that one. I wish I did not see that this is listed as ""limited edition""!! Enjoy!!"
