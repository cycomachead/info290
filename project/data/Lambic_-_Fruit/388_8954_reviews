"Overall: another killer sour by Cantillon. the amount of fruit flavor they get in the beers is amazing. also the funkiness is unlike any other breweries and they are the almost at the level of refreshing as berliners and goses"

"St. Lam '13 vintage brought direct from Brussels"
""
"Begins with prickly, unripe grapes among earthy, leathery malts. The grapes turn sweeter, riper as the malts stand out against the tart sourness, adding stone fruit qualities to the taste. At the same time, carried by a lively carbonation, the sourness becomes quite intense, with a vinegar note, evoked by the fermented grape sourness, while both tastes blend well together, wrapped up by the wooden barrel. Finishes with a tongue quenching, slightly dry sourness, along with lemon zest and grape pulp. The beer still reminds me in many ways of a young wine, while missing its typical sweetness, replaced by the typical lambic tartness, with a refreshing, high carbonation."

"Thanks to Kyle for a long time want. Took a long time for the distinctive diaper smell to wane. Grapes are not overwhelming, but the big fruit tartness really hangs on. Appreciate the opportunity!"

"Bottle shared at destructo’s TOSPH.  Reddish/pinkish pour with a white head.  Funky nose.  Grape, oak, and barnyard flavors.  Very nice......"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As with other Cantillion entries I find this immensely simple but incredibly flavorful. The nose is sour, winish, earthy minerals and purple grapes. The flavor is sour, tart and simple people grapes and cherry. So simplistic but so delicious it's not really a beer but it seems like a liquid candy."

"A winner for sure. The flavor is so good. Even popped a bottle with some spaghetti bolo in Belgium cuz why not. The grape flavor is so nice."

"Pours a nice dark beer. Little foam forms. Scent is faint, with traces of lambic, maybe berries. Taste is sour, tart. It is a smooth sour beer, not extremely acidic like most farmhouse ales. Very well executed, well balanced. Nice beer yet not over the top. Good if you are not looking for something to shock your taste buds. Cantillon after all."
""
""

""

"Easy top 20 beer to date for me. Poured cold into balloon glass. Relatively clear red color with smell of grape and wine. Taste follows the nose with a sweet and sour combo that is so smooth yet you get big merlot flavors with a subtle barrel Oakiness and tang. Not too sour and not too sweet. Feel is crazy impressive with a aggressive carb but not frothy and very smooth"

"O: This definitely grew on me as I made my way through the bottle. Not knowing quite what to expect I was perhaps underwhelmed or just unappreciative at first but as I drank more the balanced complexity became more apparent. Saint Lamvinus is certainly worthy of its stellar reputation."

"Corked and capped 750 ml from Tipples dated October 31, 2013. Pours a super bright almost neon purplish pink color with a massive fizzy pink head that recedes quickly. Lots of vinegar on the aroma, berries, vinous notes, and an interesting mint leaf that I get from Geueze and Faro sometimes. Really nice. The flavor is sweet berries and wine, vinegar, sourness, some dry oaky presence, and maybe even a little vanilla. The fruit doesn't overpower here which is nice. Light bodied, spritzy carbonation, dry finish with some wine like warmth on the way down. Beautiful beer."

"Pours a hazy orange-red with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, grape, fruit, funk, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, grape, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite sour but refreshing to drink."

"750ml bottle procured at the brewery. 21 November 2012 indicated on the label. Pours a beautiful garnet hue with an effervescent,white head that quickly dissipates. Nose is somewhat subdued - tart, suggestions of cork and acetic acid. Taste is a bit musty with grape skins, cranberry and tannins. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of lively and a dry finish. Overall, not my favorite offering from Cantillon (I anticipated a little more fruit); however, a wonderful lambic nonetheless."

"St. Lamvinus was awesome but I wasn't expecting anything less of this Cantillon masterpiece. Glad I got to try it, can't wait to try the other one in my cellar in a couple decades ;)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty beer, the acidity is sharp and like vinegar and the funk really increases as it warms. Crisp, Acidic, Fruity, Brite."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is another solid lambic from Cantillon but it's not my favorite one. The wine is there and add some nice presence but it is a bit overdrawn but the tartness and is lacking on the funk. All of that said it is still great just not one of my favorite."

"What awesome timing, having a grape-imbued lambic while standing next to a wine connoisseur. Regardless, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy fuchsia topped by over a finger of pink-ish foam. The nose comprises tart blue raspberry, light sour cherry, sour grape, a hint of grapefruit zest, and a light smattering of funk. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything showing off some powerful sour chops. This is kept in partial check, though, by the funk, which, though relatively mild in its individual expression, also blends in nicely with its acidic surroundings. The grape character is pronounced, but not overt. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, another damn fine fruited lambic from Cantillon, one of the highlights of a night that included quite a few ridiculous sours of various styles. And I'm happy to say that the aforementioned wine aficionado was also impressed by this offering. I was not surprised."

"Overall: This is the probably the best grape sour that I have drank. I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer."

"O - yep, another great Cantillon. Difficult to write about these, similar in so many ways. And I know the bottle states serve warmer, but I prefer colder..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a subtle yeast funk character and chewy texture to match with floating funky red fruit in a champagne glass. But it's beer. It's a winner and one of the most enjoyable Cantillon beers I've had."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Cantillon does it again, and I can't say that I'm surprised. These are the beers you hear about when you first start getting into craft beer. All your buds talk about this ""Cantillon"" place like it's some kind of holy grail for beer, and eventually months and months go by and you finally get to try one, and all of a sudden you're talking about it like you're some kind of sour expert. This shit is excellent; why does it have to be so far from me?"

"OVERALL: This was alright, but the feel kept it from being all it could be. The nose was enticing and there were good flavors in there as well, but a creamier and smoother feel would have helped this be top class. Still, an enjoyale fruit lambic worth checking out for sure. Cheers!"
"Overall: This is as good as it got for my experience at Brasserie Cantillon. Having already tried the regular lineup, LPK and LPF, this one is my absolute favorite. There are characteristics of a tasty red wine here for sure, yet it tastes like a great lambic beer with the carbonation of champagne. It's just an awesome brew that I would recommend to anyone with the opportunity to purchase a bottle. If I get more of these, they are going into the cellar to be cracked on special occasions."
"O: Wow. What a brew. This blend is absolutely fantastic, especially with the nearly 2 years on the bottle. I suppose the funkiness has developed a bit (this one really opens up with a blast of funk/sour/tart) and the oak has also shown up more. Quite pricey (I paid $30 for a 750 mL bottle) but well worth the investment. This is a must-try"
"Once the beer gets warmer, I get the raisins by some wines typical aroma. So easy to drink. This is an awesome beer!"

"This pours a beautiful ruby red color with pink foaming. There’s a tart aroma, light and dry, which gets sweeter as it warms. It has a pleasing, rounded tartness. I keep tasting cherries, with a touch of a funky undertone. This was incredible, a real treat to try."
"Overall: I am really enjoying this one. As far as Cantillon, Saint Lam and Blabaer now are past Fou Foune for me. Saint Lam is artfully crafted, even more than Blabaer IMO. The balance of this lambic is intense. Opened DDG today too, and Saint Lam is more enjoyable by far for me. Can't wait to open the '08 for my brother's 40th!!!"

"pours a hazy raspberry color with no head, some sediment. the nose is potently red winey vinous, funky, and a touch sweet. it tastes the same with great grape and oak, slight wine/vinegar, and finishes with a bit of yeast. medium, bodied, under-carbonated, lingering grape skin bitter/tartness, drinkable and dry. this beer is excellent, worth seeking out."
""
""
"Fantastic, and exceptionally drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is excellent lambing style."
"Overall, this is a delicious drinking lambic beer. The addition of merlot grapes crosses into wine territory and thereby invites comparison to wine. As it gets flat in the glass, it starts to look like a rosé wine. But the main impression I get is the strong presence of brett, considered an infection by wine makers, but welcomed by lambic makers. No place to sort all that out here, but this is an excellent complex sour beer to sip while pondering the commonalities and differences between lambic beers and wine."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Exceedingly drinkable, the sourness is balanced with the fruit nicely. Oak and merlot grape flavors/aromas are much subtler than I was expecting."

"magic. pours raspberry pinky color, a little hazy, with a finger or more of tiny white bubbles stacked together. very very puckery sour nose, lambic funky, plenty of yeast, mouth watering aromas. i smell grape must in there with the tart lemon acidity. the flavor is true to the nose, with the sourness being every bit as intense. almost hurts the jaw its so sour. fruit provides more flavor than sweetness, and this may be the best grape or wine based beer out there. its dryish in the finish, but still mouth watering at the same time. brightly carbonated, very active, which helps to cut through some of the acidity, which is huge. the body is very light, but i dont think id feel good if i drank a whole 750ml bottle of this on my own. the acidity and sourness would turn the stomach. overall though this is awesome stuff from cantillon, one of my favorites ive had from them. the legend grows for me..."

"Cranberry-tawny-colored pour, slightly hazy, with a minimal, fizzy head. Musty fruit aroma, grass, hints of acetic acid. ""Something tells me it'll be sour."" Pretty tart on the tongue, strong flavors of grape and apple skin, thin wine, horseblankety, but not overblown in that aspect, grassy and very dry; the intensity of the fruit tartness overthrew any acetic notes that might have been present, giving a good sense of balance. Medium body, again, crisp and very dry, a bit puckering, low to moderate carbonation, overall texture comparable to chewing on grape or apple skin. Pretty one-dimensional, but delivered what was expected. Not bad overall, and a good one to break open every once in a while."

"750mL bottles over the years. Many 2007+ bottles including some over the hill 2003 bottles. Pours a ridiculous muddy deep purple with a fizzy white head. Aroma of musty grapes, oak, Merlot, raspberry, cherries. Comes across almost as a Framboise and really not so different from Don Quijote. Taste is grape skin tannins, sweeter Merlot grapes, citrus tartness, lactic raspberry, sharply citric, tart blueberry and strawberry come to mind. High carbonation, effervescent mouthfeel. Full on yogurty lactic. 2010 and 2011 bottles are so good right now. One of my favorites."

"Ruby red (almost plum) colored body with a thin cap full of tiny bubbles. Musty red wine grapes, barnyard, soft oak, lightly aged cheese, and lactic tartness. At first the nose seems real straightforward, but as you keep diving in, more layers reveal themselves. On the palate, sweet yet tart red grapes up front, with a mustiness coming out mid-palate. Barnyard notes through the middle with some oak before a final rush of cherries and grapes. The finish is crisp and dry. A long lingering tartness in the finish. The body is on the light side of medium with perfect carbonation. This lambic is a great bridge beer for the wine drinker. Loads of wine grape flavor with a moderate tartness. This could easily win over some wine drinkers. I found this to be delicious. The flavors are bold, and really release off the palate quickly to reveal this lingering tartness that satisfies the sour cravings."

"Note:  I was a little concerned as when I received this from the shipping trade, it had clearly had some leakage with some beer seeping out and coating the outside of the bottle, even with the cork and cap.  When I opened it up a couple weeks later there was some fluid in between the cork and top of cap, and the cork was soaked through.  I was afraid it was going to be a flat mess or have some other unappealing character as a result.  Luckily it did not, so just a heads up if that happens to anyone else, dont fret!  Your nectar of the gods is likely just fine!"

"O-Really enjoyable. One of my favorite beers ever and easily my favorite of the style so far."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very funky and sour, and therefore one must devote one's full attention to the grapes to see what they're doing here - adding depth without distracting from the intense character of the base beer."
"O- one of the best Cantillons i've had. choosing a favorite between any Canty's is a spoiled choice."
""
""
""

"O: I thought I'd like this one but it's the worst beer I've ever had. My mate hated it as well. Awful, awful beer."

"O: Nice and sour yet refreshing, this beer by Cantillon is a treat."
""
"O: probably my fav sour to date. I love this stuff."
"Overall - Not the most amazing fruit flavor I've had in a lambic, but it certainly doesn't detract from the beer. I feel as though the Cantillon lambic profile calls for lighter fruits, a la Fou Foune."
"Verdict: Far and away one of my favorite Cantillons. We drank this side by side with Vigneronne and Bruocsella and it was by far the winner. This might be bested only by Fou' Foune right now as my favorite loon, definitely one to seek out and enjoy with friends."
"O: Extremely impressed with this lambic. Wasn't sure how I would like it compared to others I have had, but St. Lamvinus is outstanding."
""
"This was awesome, perhaps one of my favorite Cantillon beers to date. The grapes and red fruit flavor were a perfect match for the sour and funk that is all things Cantillon."
""
""
""
"O: An excellent Cantillon. I'd drink this all the time if it wasn't so hard to get. A very good lambic."
"Excellent beer. The smell is the weak point and it's still great, and the taste is just wonderful. Great balance of sweetness and tartness, with a healthy dose of funk. Very drinkable, great with friends."
"Overall, very good. Not the best Cantillon I have had but certainly really enjoyable."

"2010 vintage. This one pours a lighter bodied dark cranberry red in color with a one finger slightly pink head. The nose is dry and musty with a nice amount of funk and acidity. The flavors are dry and tart and it has nice acidity. As a wine drinker, I must say that this has zero characteristics of a Merlot so it's nice to see the difference between the beer and wine. This one is musty as hell. It drinks light with nice acidity but I can't really like the flavor. It doesn't have enough fruit character for my liking. This is the best vintage I've had so far. The '07 smells like puppy farts in my opinion, as in ""I just fed my dog too many rawhides"" puppy farts. I definitely prefer this vintage to that one."
"Tart, easy lambic. A good place to start for the novice. Not deep, but nice."
"O- A delicious beer, definitely one of my favorites from Cantillon, complex yet highly drinkable."
""
""
""
"This is one of those beers you take for granted in the chase for all the ""rarer"" Cantillons and 3F. It's fantastic, enough fruit to balance the acidity and funk. Big fan."
"O: probably the best sour I have had to date. Beautiful soreness with some grape flavor and lots of funk."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied and lively from the carbonation. Very nice feel in the mouth. Overall, I enjoyed this bottle quite a bit. Glad I have another one coming my way so I can really let it age and see how sour it can get."
""
""
""
"O: great all around, really drinkable and refreshing."
""
"O: A pretty strange lambic. Maybe the ideal bottle age is ~1 year. The one I have now seems too fresh and uninteresting, but if it is too old, it is very potent and sour."

"One of my favorite Cantillon and would be a great gateway beer to convert your red wine loving friends over to our side. Very enjoyable and curious to see what some age does to this."
""
"Very very good looking pink, almost purple with excellent head retention. A bitter, sweet and tart aroma with loads of funk. Still soft, and hints of grain once in a while. Tastes slightly sweet, very tart with pronounced grape at the end. Strong mouthfeel and good carbonation."

""
"Yes, this is a Cantillon, and yes, it is sour, but not really sour, I would say kinda tart. This beer has a body that is in between light and medium with some low cab in the mix. I think 5 years in the bottle may bring up the sour, but will for sure bring out the funk more. Lamvinus is not the mouth puckering sour bomb that you may expect, but a well integrated beer resembling wine. This stuff is kick ass."
""
""
""
"O-Definitely a Cantillon, a very approachable beer for someone who is overwhelmed by the sourness of their straight guezue."

"D: Nice experience with an a long aftertaste, drink well."
"Overall:  it's an awesome beer. No doubt about it.  Well balanced"
""
""
""
"This brew seemingly strips all te moisture from the mouth. It is excessively drinkable with a medium body and modest to lighter level of carbonation. Throughout the experience, there was little to no alcohol impact. While not my favorite Cantillon offering, this is still good and something I would try again if I could get a very young bottle or something quite old for comparison purposes."
""
"Overall this is definitely one of the best, if not the best Lambic I have ever had. It hits right in my wheelhouse; funky, sour, tart, fruity, tannic but none are over the top or out of balance. Really one of the best beers I have ever had because the flavor profile is so straight-forward and yet so complex at the same time because each of the subtle flavors makes an appearance as you sample. Def worth trading for/seeking out and laying out a little extra if need be to obtain."
"O: Delicous!"
""
""
""
"O/D - A solid, flavourful beer that I enjoyed on a sunny afternoon. Very tasty."
""
"Thanks Mark, let me know when my beers arrive and let's do it again sometime."
"Overall: This is a great sour beer. The fruit and tart flavors mix well with lots of funk."

"O - Nice balance between sour and soft."
"O- I am really impressed with this, the aroma was amazing, and I was expecting the taste to be really puckering but it was very mellow and balanced, I absolutely love this beer, definite gem from Cantillon."
"D: I’m a big fan of St. Lamvinus on draft, and may even prefer it to its bottled counterpart. Very refreshing and extremely easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O- This is my favorite Cantillon and the best bottle I have had. The funk elements in this bottle are outstanding and more refined than the other Cantillons that I have had. Thus this is the most balanced Cantillon I have ever come across. I love the Merlot grapes, they are fantastic, the tannins really add some awesome elements and really allow this beer to shine and develop into just pure awesomeness."

"This poured out as a really nice looking pinkish red color with a fizzy light pink head on top. The retention and lacing were very minimal here. The smell of the beer gives off plenty of Merlot Grape aromas along with the tart aromas of the wild fermentation this brew has gone through. The taste of the beer has a tart grape flavor up front with a dry funky aftertaste that would probably interest most wine lovers to try this beer. The mouthfeel is think and dry, not overly carbonated at all. Overall this brew was pretty good, I'm not sure if I would ever buy this one again mainly because of the price tag on it. I enjoyed having it though, and would drink it again if it was offered to me."

"D - This beer has a sense of mystique to me. I know that I didn't pick up everything in that glass, but what I did grab I thoroughly enjoyed and found this to be as unique as anything I've yet encountered. Great stuff, would actively seek this one out again."
"Overall. Fantastic treat. Elegant and full of flavour, but still easy to drink. Went through the first glass way to quickly. Luckily, I'm drinking this alone and have another glass left. ...Who says drinking alone is a bad thing?? If I had money to burn, I would drink this stuff often."
"O: If I had a bottle of this to myself, I could see myself finishing it in 10 minutes, it's just that good. I love good Right Bank Bordeaux, so adding Merlot and Cab Franc grapes to lambic makes sense to me. It certainly worked here."
"Overall: An interesting beer, but a touch too sour. There are some nice flavors going on there, but the sour aspect overwhelms everything else."
"Overall, this beer is stellar. I'm on the lookout for more."
"Yum, tastes like you think it would - gueuze with grapes. I'd like to age one of these, bring out the sour a bit."
"Overall – A fantastic beer that was only slightly overshadowed by the 2003 Lou Pepe Framboise tasted almost directly after. Quite wine like and nicely balanced. Curious to see what a few years will do to the flavors."
"D: the beer was drinking amazing and a great sour bite. Very glad to have this one again."
"Kudos to City Beer and a great ""bragging rights"" experience. However, not a brew ""to remember."""
"O - Overall this was a great treat.  I was amped to see this on the tap list.  At $10 for a 7 oz pour it was a bit spendy, but it was a luxury that I would try again."
"Another wonderful expression of fruit from Cantillon. Very well balanced despite some extreme flavors at work. A shame this is so difficult to find these days."
"Overall a pretty good lambic. It's not super sour or extremely funky but more balanced, if there is such a thing when it comes to lambics from Cantillon. This would make a good intro for those wanting to taste a more serious lambic."
"O-very good beer. Can't wait to see it with age"
"O: Very well put together considering how nervous I was after smelling it. I have not jumped into this style very often; however, this beer tickles my palate to explore further. As such, I will =)"
"O - I enjoyed my glass of this one. Sometimes the combination of funk and grapes doesn't always work but it really does here. Yet another winner from Cantillon."
"this beer pours a nice red color, I could not give you the exact shade as it was quite late and deep ellum is pretty dark inside anyways. the smell is acetic and sour right of the back with a little bit of funk in there but barely noticeable over the sour smell. the taste is sour with red wine notes and acidity a superb balance between the wine grape flavor and the sour lambic. the mouthfeel is light and mouth wateringly sour. overall this is the best sour beer i have ever had."
"Overall: I could easily see myself knocking back a few bottles of this; however, my wallet can't see that."
"Overall a great beer, definitely worth seeking out."
"EdIT: got to try some on tap at triple rock, wow, this beer just keeps getting better every time I drink it."
"Really a perfect representation of the style and one of the best fruit lambics that Cantillon makes in my opinion. Only rivaled by Lou Pepe Kriek in Cantillon's normal line. Snatch this one up if you can. Amazing fresh and gets more and more graceful as it ages."
"O: Good."
"Overall, a fantastic beer from Cantillon and maybe the best Lambic I've ever tasted. Absolutely amazing."
"O - One of the best lambics I have ever tried."
"Overall-- this is impressive. I could sip on this regularly-- if only it didn't cost $40 per bottle out this way!"
"O - Overall this was spectacular. So glad I got to try this on tap, and even more glad that I have a bottle tucked away in my cellar."
"Minor Edit: The nose didn't put me off from getting 2 pours of this. Just sayin'."
"Overall awesome! Just friggen awesome."
"Drink- I am not sad to say but more happy to say I am being a huge fan of Cantillon and want a whole ton more of it. This was simply a great beer."
"World class in every respect."
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, dry and prickly on the tongue, lingers for an extended period. A wonderful fruit lambic from Cantillon with great sour character but still enough flavor to carry the aggressiveness."
"Had this beer on tap at Monk's at their Cantillon event today. The beer poured and looked much like a red wine would. It was a deep purple red color with no head to speak of at all. The aroma too, mirrored a red wine, but was less intense and had a bit of a vinegary thing happening along with a bit of mild funk. The red wine thing continues in the flavor. This beer very closely mirrors a lighter much more pleasant and enjoyable (for me anyway) version of a merlot. Very good beer, but not necessarily one that blew me away."
"750 ml bottled in 2010 shared by cenzo. Thanks Vince. Pours a bright cherry red with small white head that has decent retention and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a light brett funkiness, red wine grapes, light tannins with a bit of oak as well as a bit of cherry. The initial taste is quite sour with a little bit of sweetness and the red wine grapes coming through. A bit of oak and cherry are present as well as some lactic acid. The standard Cantillon barnyard funk is present in small amounts as well. The finish is dry with a light tannic astringency. Light to medium body with a really good slick mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation. Another great Cantillon beer that I would be happy to drink anytime."
"One of the most balanced and complex lambics I've had. The merlot grapes really lend something special. I think this would be better with more age (bottle says 21 November 2010). Allowing the brett to do its thing and develop more wild character would take this to a whole new level. I liked the Cuvee de Champion, but this is clearly in another league."
"Best fruit lambic I've had, probably my favorite cantillon to date, but I still have a hard time believe its worth that price; That said I'm not sure I could pass this up if it was sitting on the shelf. This is a real treat, glad I finally got to try it."
"O- Good, heck, pretty damn good maybe great. Too pricey though, and Cantillon has better fruit lambics. I'll be passing on this one in the future."
"Narrative: Vitus Tanneen had been in some sticky jams before but this time, this time certainly was noteworthy. The walls of the trash compactor closed slowly, pressing the wine refuse closer into the chamber. The aluminum walls reeked of sweet grape skins and sticky notes. If not for the impending death, this would be an almost pleasant situation. “Well Sir Knuckles, looks like we are in a PRESSING SITUATION!” His friendly companion, Sir Knuckles, was an astute howler monkey with no penchant for puns. “WREE EE EE EEEK!” Sir Knuckles gestured imposingly to a hatch covered in sticky grape residue. “Well Sir Knuckles, this is one top that I have no hesitation to pop.” Using a wine opener, Vitus deftly unsealed the hatch and emerged into the bay area sunshine. “NOT TODAY KENDAL JACKSON! NOT TODAY!” He spun and his velvet tails swung after this athletic frame with the poise of a man, a man almost killed by grapes."
"Overall: Superb, one of the best beers I have had. The only improvement I could suggest and it's only a small one - a little more grape aroma would have been nice. Though maybe a fresher bottle would have delivered. Still a beer I will most certainly buy again!"
"4.5 D: Good beer. Definitely sour, but not intestine twisting. After the Kriek yesterday I had a few rounds of the quick step, but I don't imagine there will be an encore performance tonight. Solid all around."
"Overall I have to say that this beer just had a bit too much sour going on for me. It was pleasant in the aroma, but really dominated the flavor. I wish it had a bit more balance, but then again it is possible that the age had mellowed the grapes and let the sour shine through more. It was definitely quite the experience to drink this beer though, especially in good company."
"Overall a delightful drink, crisp, tart and sour, perfect with a tomato spaghetti dish."
"2009 bottle courtesy of the ever-awesome ericfb18. The brew pours a luscious blood-red hue, although it is fully translucent; it is capped with a thin wisp of encircling white froth. The nose is pure Cantillon funk; delicious and complex. Notes of bushy mixed berries, acidity of the acetic persuasion more than lactic, tannic oak, and an overall unbelieveably delectable and well-rounded flavor make this one of the best beers on Earth. The wine and grape is there if you look for it, although I feel like the fruitiness could just as easily be cherry, raspberry, blueberry or a berry melange. The most succinct way to describe the flavor of St. Lamvinus: This is what I thought Blabaer was going to taste like. I am struck by the fullness of the fruit flavor; it is not mere nuance, the taste is big and jammy and unabashed. The feel is full and creamy for a Cantillon (a la Blabaer), and has a wonderfully dry and mouth-watering finsh. Overall, this is about as good as a beer (or any libation, for that matter) can be."
"Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Pours a nice reddish pink. A bit of nice white head. Looks very pretty. Smells like damp dog. Funky and sour. A hint of grape. Tastes grape heavy. Very tart and acidic. A bit harsh and abrasive and burns on the throat. But it's a nice flavour profile. Overall highly carbonated but very nice."
"O - I'm glad I've got a bottle of this set aside as I imagine there was something off with the glass I had (at least I hope that's the case). Can see the potential for this one to be amazing, and am looking forward to trying it again."
"I was a little disappointed in this beer, but perhaps it just needed some more aging to bring out the lambic qualities I was looking for."
"Thanks for the treat Don!"
"Saint Lamvinus pours a deep burgundy. I could mistake it for red wine, except for the thin layer of raspberry head that crowns the beer. The nose consisty of dark fruits (cherries and plums), acidity, and a bit of barnyard funk. The red wine notes should be the base that everything plays off of, but they are just a bit too far in the background to really carry things though. The funky aspect of the beer comes through a bit more in the flavor. I've heard funk sometimes described as being musty , but this is the first time I've personally tasted it. It tastes like I imagine the air in a long abandoned room would. It's a bit overpowering, blocking out the more tart edge and fruity notes from the wine grapes. It's amazing to contrast the mouthfeel here with the Cuvee des Champions I just had. This one comes across as bit more rich and full, though that may be more a function of a much lower level of carbonation than any increase in the body. The overall effect though is a certain dullness to the beer. Saint Lamvinus smoothed out a bit as it warmed, but it remained a class below my favorite sours/wild ales."
"O: I found this brew simply phenomenal. It is a style bender that shows a profound depth that wines can only dreams about. Cheers!"
"Pours a crazy purple color, similar to the label on Welch's grape jelly. Immediately, it makes you question whether it's beer. No head, but visible carbonation bubbles line the bottom of the glass. Smell is quite clean. Hints of wild yeast, but in no way as powerful as most lambics and particularly weak for a Cantillon. The taste is smooth, almost like a perfect blend of wine and lambic. Grape comes through as well as the wild yeast. Sour, but not the typical puckering that comes from the top lambics. Very light bodied. Wonderful lambic particularly if you want something more mellow and smooth. This is one even a none-lambic drinker could get on board with. Tremendous."
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink because it doesn’t have an “in your face” type of sourness."
"On tap at Rattle N Hum.. The sexiest beer I've seen all day, a glorious dark red, low carbonation, a small ring of head. But that doesn't matter. This beer made me shriek for sheer joy upon its sight. Good goddamn it looks amazing. Smells funky, a little grape and berry action. The taste is barnyard, a touch of grape, tannic, woodsy. I was surprised I didn't get more grape out of it, merely hinting, but that's not a terrible thing. I'm just accustomed to grape sours tasting more vinous. This had a bit of that quality but was definitely more lambic than grapebeer. Good stuff."
"Full bodied with a tart, mouth puckering sourness that lingers throughout over the sweet vinous and funky barnyard notes into a sweet, slightly dry finish. Bursting with vinous dark fruit, especially the grapes. A perfect marriage of wine and beer. Slight acidity in the finish with a lingering acetic vinegar presence that leaves me drooling for more. This beer is incredibly quaffable considering how funky it is. Perfectly balanced."
"O- this is an excellent lambic and on cask its a dream. Glad to have had it this way and can't wait till the next time. Not as sour as some but very complex and at the same time very easy to enjoy even quaffable."
"O: Another great lambic from Cantillon, great all around, really drinkable and refreshing. Definitely one of my favorite sours."
"Overall, another great offering from Cantillon I was thrilled to try. The lighter red wine and oak notes from the grapes and barrels make it a bit more balanced and subtle (but still just as complex) the other offerings by them. Definitely recommended."
"750ml bottle, 2008 vintage. Pours a dark, deep reddish-purple with a thin pink head. Aromas of grapes, berries, vinegar, oak and funk. Flavors of tart grape skins, balsamic vinegar, hints of citrus, oak and sweetness. Medium bodied, with a dry and tart finish. Medium carbonation with nice Cantillon funk and lots of aging potential."
"D - pretty solid fruit lambic from Cantillon. I was hoping for a bit more from them but this is another solid beer nonetheless. Given it's price point I think I'll go from something else by these guys next time but still pretty awesome."
"quite delicious. lots of red wine and grape flavor and mild sourness just make this so drinkable. quite different from the aged version of this."
"Nice light body with crisp carbonation. Overall this is my favorite of the regular cantillion offerings. I'll never turn this one away."
"This is one of my favorites. Keeps a nice balance while still having a strong Cantillon tang."
"O: The best beer I've ever had. Nothing else to add. This is a beer that has been finely crafted throughout the generations. Although it might not be my favorite, I can objectively say this is the best crafted beer I've ever drank. Cantillon's almost ""worship"" of tradition is something that definitely paid off in the end."
"Overall this is a solid offering from Cantillon and truly an (expensive) treat!"
"Blood red color but not as red grapes. Low foam. Tannic nose with cork tip. The mouth is acidic, woody and strong enough. Despite what you may think, the taste of Bordeaux grapes is not present it. Found skin / grapes thereof in the strength of the bitterness of this lambic. The finish is tannic, oaky, slightly resembling the balsamic vinegar. Cantillon Lambic good but do not let the red grapes to express their full potential."
"Mouthfeel is spot-on for the style as it is light and moderately carbed. Thanks go out to the good doctor for sharing this gem. Recommended."
"Pours a slightly cloudy burgundy color with highlights of ruby to purple in the light, starts off with a tiny cap of lightly tinted ruby and tan head. Scent is tart, lightly vinger-like acidity, strong merlot grape and notes of dark cherry, moderate funk, only light hints of grahmn crackery malt. Firts sip brings the merlot wine grapes, evolves into a moderately tart, sour and acidic taste, but the strong fruit flavors cut through. Lightly funky and some sweetness. Medium bodied, low in carbonation, bone dry and slightly puckering. Quite the beer, glad i found it on draft as opposed to shelling out the local $45 per bottle price."
"Light bodied and very easy to drink. Very mild sourness on this lambic, but lots of flavors to enjoy."
"Overall: I have been waiting to try this beer for a while now, and it did not disappoint. Due to the grapes, it has an obvious wine-like character, which is enjoyable. Whether it is worth the price tag, however, is debatable."
"Cheers!"
"2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured blood red with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained minimal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, very slight grapes, and slight acetic acid. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, grapes, deep dark fruit, slight acetic acid, and big citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. I had this one sitting in the cellar since 2008 and finally got tired of looking at it and decided to crack it. Really glad that I did. The flavor was not only complex but quite excellent as everything seemed to blend very nicely together. It also had a great aroma that invited me in for more. I found myself drinking this one quite quickly. Good thing is is only 6%... An absolute must try for anyone!"
"Quite sour vinous character from the merlot grapes with a bit raspberry lemon side to the profile. The grapes lie somewhere in between ripe red grapes and underripe green grapes. I generally prefer younger fruit lambic and at about 2 years old the level of fruit presence seems ideal. Has a very rich aspect of funk to it that's pretty animal like, sort of a leathery flavor. A really pleasing balance between sour and funk that keeps everything in check. Maybe couldve used a little more carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Taste is tart and tingly all over, very sharp and funky, but not over the top like some Drei Fontinen beers. There is a light grape flavor, but it's not over the top or very strong, and it's well balanced by the oakiness that's equally present. Mouthfeel is light, carbonated and a bit champagne-like. Finish is very dry and sour, just how it should be, fantastic beer!"
"D: The nose hurts drinkability a bit. However, the taste and mouthfeel really make up for it. I could definilty do a whole 750 or two no problem."
"Really, really drinkable, though the tannic character builds as time goes on. I prefer the LP series to this, but not by much. A winner."
"D- the whole 750 would have been too much, so im happy that i had someone to share it with. intensely sour. im glad i tried this and would love to try it again. i dont think im in any rush to go out and drop another $40 on it though. Cantillon cant disappoint."
"D: One of the better beers I've ever had, and probably my favorite lambic to date (even over Blåbær, my previous favorite). Thanks again Mike for cracking this one!"
"Dry finish on a medium, fulfilling body. What a classic."
"D - The best Lambic that I have had to date."
"Overall an awesome beer but pretty expensive. I would get it again but their too hard to come by and I don't think it's worth the effort."
"Drinkability- every sip has me longing for more....but it is mighty dry and tart so 1 bottle split between 2 people is plenty for one sitting."
"This beer drinks like the finest wine or champagne. A joy to behold. I am glad I made it part of my New Years Eve 2010 celebration. Pricey? Yes. But do yourself a favor and try this one if you get the chance."
"Still, this is a finely crafted lambic - the wine barrels nicely integrated so as to showcase both the barrels and the base beer. Funky and sour, fine bubble carbonation - gladly have this over a champagne for any fine occasion."
"From my rootin' tootin', down home malt and hops beer heart this is more wine than beer. So far my exploratory journey through gueze and lambic land has been interesting. Not sure its for me but I think this particular blend may be the turning point."
"D: Fantastic. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. I now regret not buying every single bottle that sat on the shelf of my local bottle shop. If you ever have a chance to purchase this beer...yes, it's worth it."
"I'm no Lambic expert, but this is a very well-balanced beer, probably the most drinkable and enjoyable I've had from Cantillon. Quite a treat."
"(D)- Yet another winner from Cantillon. A great seamless balance and feel to it. A nice acidity too. I would be curious what age will do to this. Quite drinkable for the style. Just everytime I have this it seems to get better and better in my eyes. If only this was easier to get my hands on (and perhaps a bit cheaper) would this be near perfect 5's. Superb both fresh and with some time on it!"
"this one was bottled a year ago and I'm very curious how the flavors change over time but I doubt I'll find out because this stuff costs big bucks. Great stuff though if you like sour funk"
"The body is medium with fizzy, active carbonation. The finish is sourness that lasts and lasts. It is pretty dry as well, and the dry/sour combo makes me want another sip quickly! But with this intensity, it just can't be considered excellent in terms of drinkability. For the price ($35 a bottle), this is not worth it over some other Cantillon offerings IMO except for the expert quaffer. But it's a very good beer and probably one every sour beer fan should try at one point or another. Save it for a special occasion."
"Reviewed on: 03-27-2010"
"d - I liked this one a lot. I thought it taste great and was very easy to drink for a sour. The light body and low ABV made this a beer I felt like I could drink a lot of, and I'd love to again sometime."
"Overall, one of the best Cantillon's out there. A tad expensive, but good for special occasions."
"This purple beverage, the 2009 vintage, trickles from the tap at Moeder Lambic Fontainas with a transient head. It exhales an aroma of blueberries, blackberries, black and red grapes, some pepper, and tastes, like draft Vigneronne, predominantly of fruit, with little of the funk or sourness that lurks in the bottled format. The keg imparts a thicker mouthfeel though, and the drinkability is unsurpassed by other grape lambics."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors and depth to it overall. Was a very good choice to celebrate with the evening. One of the better sours I've had."
"Well done."
"J"
"A great beer that I have enjoyed several times, and every time is a treat. Because of the vinous character, this is something that could appeal to wine drinkers as well. One of those beers that is more of an experience than anything, and an experience I am glad to have at every opportunity. I can't recommend this enough."
"D-this beer is delicious and I wish this was constantly around. the balance and flavors works so well together with a glorious sweetness melded with brett perfection and an awesome semi dry finish."
"Notes: Bottled 18 Sep. 2008. Very vinous beer that would make a good substitute for wine. Slightly puckering and sour but it isn't absurd and is still tasty. Definitely a unique tasting beer that is worth a try."
"HV"
"Color is a dark, clear rose red with a wispy pink head that fades quickly to thin ring and no lacing. Aroma is dry, oaky blend of red grapes and non-acidic funky sourness. The flavor is surprisingly less fruity than expected, dominated by a subtle dry sour with merlot undetones. Body is very full and smooth with mild carbonation and a long lasting Pickering sourness. I'll need to try a bottle of this to appreciate the intricacies of this better, but so far I'm impressed."
"O: At $35 a bottle I expected much more from this selection. It is good, and obviously a cut above your typical lambic, but not great. I was disappointed."
"D - Cantillon continues to impress. Not as mouth puckering as their other beers that I've had. It's possible that the age had taken the edges off prominent aromas, flavours and carbonation and mellowed this into a absolute beauty. Incredible easy sipper."
"Overall, one of Cantillon's best. Drinks incredibly easy and I'm glad I finally got to tick this one without buying a $40 bottle."
"All in all, this was a decent brew. Very interesting for a sour. It seems with these types of brews, that you need to have a very strong stomach. I'd say this could be a good conversion brew into the sour field if you like grapes or wine."
"D - too expensive to drink a lot of, but I would like to have more of this. Gonna have to grab a bottle or two while they are still out there."
"D - Tartness gets to you, but still easy to drink."
"Despite my lack of ability to truly expose here all the nuances of this beer, believe me, it is a great one. Something to be enjoyed slowly, over and over again."
"Flavor is fantastic...lots of grape, a good amount of tart, carbonation is middle of the road. Light and crisp mouthfeel. The opening flavor is lemon like...but quickly reduces to a sweeter yet tart grape. A very good Lambic from Cantillon."
"D: I think this was a big miss for me. This is the second worst cantillon I have had and I love everything they put out. For the price though it just did not do it for me. I don't think the grapes really worked well in this one. Maybe after 10 years this beer would be something different."
"My previous exposure to beer blended with red wine (from Japan, at that) did not leave me expecting too much from this. Sacre bleu, it sure is nice to be surprised! This is a revelation, a lovely, fruity, and tangy beer analogue for the claret set. As a fan of contrasts in flavour, this works oh so well, and I'm suddenly craving some chocolate cake as an accompaniment, and pondering the Pinot Noir version of this."
"Bottled 11/18/2008. The beer pours a reddish-brown-amber color with a white head. The aroma is very tart with some oaked notes. The flavor is tart grapes with some oak. The tartness is very intense but it is not overwhelming. Light-medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a great sour ale that was worthy of being beer number 1500. Cantillon has done it again."
"This is a pretty amazing beer, meant to be savoured, and every aspect of it supports that. This could easily become my ""special occasion beer""."
"D: Tasty but not cantillons best offering. I definitely enjoy it though."
"I'm not a fan of tartness, but I've been itching to try this for a while. Thanks bobsy!"
"D - It's pretty drinkable for how insanely funky it is. At 5%, it's easily drinkable in that regard. You've really gotta like funky Brett beers to enjoy this one."
"Overall, a solid beer. Very nice sour from Cantillon. I could drink a lot of this but unfortunately it is too expensive. No vinegar flavors or that medicine flavors that I get out of some lambics here. Very drinkable."
"Light bodied and highly carbonated giving it an even airier feel. Crisp and so delicious...way too easy to drink..."
"M/D - very light and thin mouthfeel, I think I have read other reviews of it being better bottled than kegged, and I wonder how this would change my thoughts of it. As of now, its not that highly rated for me."
"The only reason I've never had this before is the price tag. I now completely understand why it's priced the way it is. This is a fantastic beer and one I will definitely be buying in the future. Thanks Kevin!"
"D: GET THIS BEER! Cantillon's finest, and may be Belgium's finest as well. Price is no option. Go out and pick up a bottle if you can find it. Very drinkable and unique."
"This bottle was kindly sent to me by Pier-Luc - thanks for the great hookup on the Cantillon!"
"Make sure this is consumed at cellar temp. You don't want to miss a single aspect of this phenomenal brew."
"Drinkability: A fascinating beer"
"Although this beer retails for upwards of $35 a bottle, it is worth every penny. The wine comparisons are obvious. However, to the best of my knowledge, no $35 bottle of wine displays the complexity or the elegance of Saint Lamvinus. Every beer aficionado should have the opportunity to sample this at least once in their lifetime."
"This is a great brew I loved it but I do think it takes time to appreciate a sour and the age of the bottle greatly changed the flavors from the glass that I had fresh also at $35.00 a bottle its not cheep. It was a great experience and one I will love to have again but not something I expect every day. Another hint is you have to split this bottle with someone who will appreciate it. There is no way I could drink one bottle myself one glass was enough at a sitting"
"At long last, St. Lamvinus. Due to the ongoing Cantillon shortage I actually had never had this until recently. Pours a dark purple with a slight cloudiness, no residual head, but lovely color from those grapes undoubtedly. Aroma is nicely funky and uniquely Cantillon and Brussels in that respect. Fairly dry floral character with some fruit/grape sweetness. The taste has that wonderful Cantillon funk to it, plus grape skins and floral notes and a dry finish. Medium bodied with a full carbonation, dry yet refreshing. This is a real tasty brew. While American brewers are putting out amazing things, they will never quite be able to do a beer like this."
"Quite the lambic. Poured into small sample glasses with only a bit of off white head and no lace. Color is a copper amber. Aroma is musky, malty, yeasty, oak, hint of the grape and acid. Flavor is much the same with the grape coming out in the finish. Great body and carbonation. Finsh is like flavor and medium in length. Clean finish but not really a session. This is a beer for the true lambic afficianado minus the fu fu."
"The low abv (5%) lends itself to easy-drinking. The acidity level though, would probably lend itself to heartburn. It's very tasty and to those who like sours, in general, it's delicious and very consumable."
"Minimal front flavor, beer is light in body. Drinkability high. The tartness gets you, its grapey and slightly sweet but in a sour and sweet sort of way. The flavors develop better on the back palate than the front. Its a great beer. There is not a lot of body to it and there is nearly no carbonation in the mouth. I really enjoyed it."
"The palate quite vinous with the grapes lending a lot of flavor and depth. The sourness is immediately apparent, with the acidity working really well with the grape. The funk character is rather low, just mildly musty, though I suspect that the fruit is obfuscating just how much funk is present. Drying and mildly tannic on the finish with a clean sourness and lingering vinous character, this is exceptional stuff."
"Overall, this is a great sour. I really like the merlot grapes both for the beautiful color and the flavor. Nothing really stands out, but everything is very well done. I'd love to have a bottle of this to sip on a lazy summer afternoon. You really can't go wrong with Cantillon."
"Overall, an exceptional lambic. Possibly the best Cantillon I have had to date, though I do really enjoy Rose de Gambrinus as well. Try this if you can get it, as it is a unique experience."
"D: Possibly the best Cantillon beer I've had to date (yes, even better than Blabaer and Crianza). I'd pick up another one of these any day!"
"I wish i could drink this every day. Sadly it is very expensive so i will have to stick with IPA and Pils."
"Reviewed from my notes. Review based upon two 4 ounce pours I had, each served in a tiny wine glass at Novare Res' Valentines Day beer and chocolate pairing. The beer has an opaque plum/cranberry hue. There is no head or visible carbonation. It is a beautiful looking beer. It has a great fruity, funky aroma. It is slightly champagne-like. A mildly sweet fruit flavor is the first thing I taste. Tartness kicks in as I swallow and lingers briefly. I am definitely tasting wine-like flavors (red grapes, mostly), but all in a great funk wrapper. It's delicious. It has a crisp, dry light body. The tingly funk feeling is a great substitute for the carbonation bubbles you can usually feel in beers. There is a slight mouth coat. For a sour beer, this is amazingly drinkable. It really isn't all that sour. I wish I had a bigger pour! It is definitely a sipper, but extremely enjoyable. Personally, I can't see myself ever getting tired of this beer. It is near perfect."
"Overall: Kind of one-dimensional w/grapes and tartness being only flavors that shine through, but still works. Kind of like a NG beer but w/grapes."
"D- Easy drinking. Somewhat harsh on the stomach due to all of the sour/funk. I want more. I loved this one."
"Overall a great beer that I enjoyed much more than the Fou Foune. Less fruit but more tartness and funk, less sweet. A very good beer that I enjoyed."
"Pours a beautiful ruby with a thin pink head. Aromas of cherries, currants, and grapes on the nose, with a perfectly balanced funkiness. Flavor is vinous with more fruit (and even cranberry?), with a sharp but refreshingly acidic finish, complemented by hint of cloves or anise. This is a perfect fruit lambic."
"O: Very drinkable beer. Delicious Cantillon is pleonasm ;)"
"Drinkability is solid for the style. I know the price on this is prohibitively expensive for some, but if you are a fan of lambics or fruit beers at all then you owe it to yourself to try this at least once."
"D - Not something for everyday consumption but certainly something I'd drink again."
"Shared at the December 09 Metro Detroit tasting. Hazy pink pour with nice lacing. Wheaty barnyard funk aroma with some nice vinous fruit. The flavor is tart red wine and dry grain with a nicely balanced Cantillon sour finish. Dry medium body with moderate carbonation."
"Bottle. Squishy cork and intense funk escaping the bottle got to me, I let it air out about an hour before pouring. Beautiful red/purple pour with a pinkish white head. After the first big whiffs of the classic lambic sweat and barnyard aromas, I pickup some distinctly winey aromas, lots of grapes, dried cranberries and a bit of oak. Taste is still very lambic like with some earth and a grape/wine finale. Absolutely fantastic palate, this beer demands to be drunk. As I drink, the strong sour aromas and taste fade out and make way for all the fruitiness this beer possesses."
"Overall I've been wary of the price tag of a bottle of this for a while and I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to try it on-tap. Very well worth the shot."
"It truly is an experience to drink this. It is a sad moment when the last drop is gone."
"This was a great beer, but I wouldn't suggest opening one alone(don't know why you would want to), it could become a little overwhelming. One glass will suffice."
"St. Lamvinus has a relatively low carbonation and is impressively drinkable for a beer of this intensity. I would consume it far more regularly if it were less expensive."
"D: Nice, but doesn't live up to past experiences with bottled Saint Lamvinous where the flavors were truly sublime. Not sure if it can be chalked up to tap v bottle, or whether the difference is due to the vintage."
"D: Very high--every sip reveals greater complexity and no amount would seem to be enough."
"Overall, a solid offering from Cantillon and a neat one to have tried on tap."
"The taste is interesting to boot, but interesting in a very good way. the beer continued to get better with each sip. not nearly as much funk in the taste as there was in the nose. tart cherries, subtle funk. great balance, somewhat soft, not overpowering. tartness was a decent level and nothing to scoff at. would be interested to try a more recent version to compare and out of the bottle as well. Glad I had a chance to drink this one."
"I had this ontap today at Capones, it was a 2006 vintage. The beer was a pretty purple red hybid with a thin little head. The nose was sour, almost like a cherry vinegar. There was a depth to the flavorss, cherry, oak and vinous flavors combined with an almost vinegary sourness. A very dry beer that took me a while to finish. In the end this was a bit too sour for my palate."
"There is no shortage of flavor levels here, yet their combination is incredibly nuanced. A masterpiece from Cantiillon."
"Saint Lamvinus is one of those beers that achieved legendary status and it certainly deserves it. I'm always somewhat skeptical approaching Lambics, but this one delivers in a big, big way. I'll never have a shred of doubt about a Cantillon beer ever again. This one's damn near divine. The flavor is so complex and delicious. It truly is a special beer. If you don't have this beer available in your locale, it's well worth seeking out in a trade. Find a bottle. Thanks a ton, Andrew."
"Cantillon usually doesn't fail to disappoint, and this is no exception. If you're into vinous, wine-like beers, this is well worth the occasional indulgence. High-priced, but this is a time-and-space-intensive brew, so it's understandable."
"overall I am very glad I had the chance to try this and would not mind trying it again. Thanks again mike."
"Overall: A great sour, but unfortunately...not the best I've had. A must try. Cheers!"
"Still, this is a pretty refreshing sour ale. It just lacks a little something to me - the fact that I can't pick what is in it implies that the fruit characters are what is absent. Not bad."
"Very drinkable overall, like a good young wine. Bit of an acidic linger but otherwise pretty decent."
"Oak, berries, and some barnyard in the nose, as it warms you get more funk and some leather. The body is light and playful like champagne, very soft acidity, with strawberry notes and definitive tartness. I was expecting more tannins, but none were present. Dry and clean, with a slight puckering finish."
"D= awesome beer here. Really great beer but the price tag wasn't right for me."
"D - So easy to drink and so damn good. I really dig the funk, grapes, and oak mixed together. A perfect combination worthy of it's top 100 rating."
"Mouthfeel is lively, with a little stickiness. It's not as refreshing as other Cantillons, IMO; not as bracing up front, and a bit too much residual sweetness in the finish. It hurts the drinkability just a bit. Still, I haven't had a Cantillon I don't love and this isn't about to change that. I wish this was on the wine list at my favourite Italian restaurant. Splitting a bottle over dinner would be the way to go."
"This beer pours a pink grape colour with nice carbonation that produces a one finger bubbling,fast vanishing head with average lacing,the aroma is barnyard sour funk,red grapes and vinegar,i can see why this beer is classed as a good balance between the beer culture and wine culture as the first taste is sour merlot grapes then its followed by a nice funky sour lambic after taste but not overly mouthpuckering and finishes very nice,dry and crisp and for me a very drinkable lambic with a nice easy light mouthfeel almost wine like at some stages on the palette,i definately enjoy my lambics and would highly recommend this to any who hasnt tried it and likes a good lambic."
"There is an ok mouthfeel nothing special and its drinkable for a lambic just becuase of its lack of s strong sourness."
"D - High for a beer this tart. Really solid lambic overall."
"Thanks to juicestam for the opportunity to try this great stuff!"
"Drinks pretty nice, I am very up & down on sours, but this one is living up to its world class tartness, which today I like/love. The sourness is done right, I don't think I'm drinking salad dressing unlike some others I've had. Sour freaks must try this, I'm a malthead & I still liked this a bunch, many may hesitate at the price, but got a deal at $25 a bottle (only one there). Not an every day beer for me, but if your want to get your Lambic freak on, this is your huckleberry!"
"D- If I could afford it, I'd drink this all the time! Only knock is that... well, I can't afford it!"
"D: I enjoy drinking this, and I wouldn't turn it down if it were shared again. I just haven't really picked up a love for Cantillon and have no strong desire to seek it out [yet]."
"Overall I enjoyed this very much. I had never heard of Cantillon until I saw this on tap and asked about it. Now I check it out on BA and come to realize it's in the ""Top 100"". What a treat!"
"Light brownish/red in color. A vinegarish sweet/sour smell, slightly cider-like. Not overly sour, but a nice mix of tangy fruit flavors. Hints of several fruits especially apples and pears. Very drinkable and refreshing with essentially no alcohol presence whatsoever."
"Very drinkable, especially for a traditional lambic."
"D - A good flavor experience for me, so lush and highly drinkable. The hybrid of lambic and wine grapes and the very light feel for the 6%. The kind of flavor you want to sip, it has so much going on that it refreshes as you savor it."
" Palate is not overwhelmingly sour up front, but has good notes of wine grapes and ripe white peach. The tartness takes over after the swallow, with a sour, fairly boozy finish that has a touch of astringency. Body is just about perfect to convey the flavors here - more creamy than bubbly, it provides a substantial base that allows the fruit flavors to linger but never overpower the sour. This is a more approachable offering than the gueuze or other Cantillon beers, but is still deliciously complex. Well-done."
"Drinking this beer in the brewery, from the brewer himself, is one of the great beer experiences of my life. Mr. van Roy was friendly, intelligent, and very passionate and confident about his beers. I hope that this brewery stays in business for centuries to come."
"will be going to europe this weekend and will definitely try and check it out when I go."
"Notes: What a treat to have this beer at the brewery!"
"Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer for $25. Honestly, this was a good beer, but not my favorite Cantillon. It poured a grape-juice colored purple-red with a short head. The beer drinks like a very dry red wine and isn't quite as sour as a lambic or gueze, but it still certainly on par with the good fruit lambics. I think the grapes here have overpowered a lot of the funkier elements, making this beer reminds me more of their framboise. I'd say this beer is worth a try if you can afford it."
"Drinkability: Give me this over wine any day - delicious! I really appreciated the 6% as well."
"aroma and flavors are actually not as complex as the bottle. but the carbonation here seems to be more delicate. the unique snifter glass really helps with the presentation as well."
"D: A fantastic lambic, a real work of art. The character of a sparkling wine this one showcases is fantastic. Highly recommended."
"A birthday bottle for my wife that I chose on a whim, a bit pricey but the occasion warranted it. I figured that she loves lambics & wine, so....The bottle poured a brighter than expected purple with pink edges to a light pink head that dissipated quickly & left a wee amount of lace afterwards. The aroma had a sour vinegar and wine-soaked cloth quality. The flavor definitely evokes the merlot, but is more complex as it shifts in even one sip from a tart & sweet cherry to vinegar sour and then changes to a flat but bright, crisp wine. The body is light, bubbly and easy to drink. A very interesting beer, but definitely worth it."
"M/D - Light and crisp with excellent carbonation. A touch dry and leaves the mouth somewhat puckered. Easy drinking...an excellent beer and certianly worth the $30 at least once"
"This is one of the better sour beers I've ever enjoyed. Another solid offering from our friends at Cantillon."
"This thing went down really fast. Sure, I only had an 8oz pour, but even considering that. This lacks the sour punch that other cantillons have, and this is one I think could spend some time in the cellar. Overall a fascinating beer, but I don't know that I will ever pay 40 bucks for a bottle of it."
"M&D: the texture is quite ""stimulating", due to the level of musty tart-iness vis-à-vis the delicate carbonation, while, at 5%abv., this ale seems to taste ""heavier"" than normal thanks maybe to the tannins brought about by the red grape skins. All in all, this is another very very good novel-lambic invented by this uncompromising brewery, although personally I think the white-grape counterpart (""Vigneronne"") has the upper hand for the finesse in aroma and overall. Just finished the whole 750ml bottle in an hour and I still can't have enough of it - really quaffable for a lambic!"
"Light - Medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation and a very dry mouthfeel. A superb beer. I'm very excited that a new batch should be around soon."
"Pair with chocolate - flourless chocolate cake. Caramelized Pear salad."
"D - Mild aftertaste, low ABV, cask-style texture. The only thing that keeps this from a perfect score is the outrageous price. It tastes wonderful, but at $40/bottle in Chicago it's too expensive to have regularly. Hopefully it pops up on-tap a little more often (albeit slightly more carbonated)."
"Very easily drinkable but I don't think I'll stop back here due to the price."
"I have always thought long and hard about buying a bottle of this when I see at Holiday Wine Cellar but the thirty dollar plus price tag always scares me away, now it will not, this is truly a great brew from Cantillon and I would like to have more as soon as possible, worthy of its hype, recommended"
"Ok, the beer falls a bit too far on the wine side of things for me. I appreciate the clean, well-attenuated malt and fruit blends but the beer doesn't leave the malt backbone that I appreciate most. The first sip led me to beleive that this 750 mill. session would be laborous and tiresome but after 45 minutes, the glass is dry. Very drinkable, the beer evaporates on the tongue and leaves a powdery, fruity finish. Understandible why this beer ranks among the best."
"Inexplicably poured ice cold into a wine glass at Long Bar. Ruby. Slight head which dissipates quickly. Beer is somewhat flat. Mild but rich & complex aroma. Tart. Slight malt flavor. Grape and sour cherry, black cherry, and sweet cherry fruitiness. Aromatic vinegar notes. Higher alcohols? Dry finish. Some grape-skin astringency. Wine-like. This 6% alcohol beer is more satisfying and interesting than beers twice that strong."
"Definitely recommended if you're a fan of the style..."
"750mL bottle, corked and capped, purchased for $29.99 at Grapes of Mirth in Columbus. The beer is hazy, kind of muted pink reddish colored, with an off-white head tinted just a little pink. I guess it's kind of stereotyping but this really smells like a funky barnhouse. I'm not sure I can smell anything grape-like, but I get earthy mustiness and a little vinegar. This lambic is not as sour as I expected but still has a little mouth pucker after each sip. Mostly it's funky and dry, maybe a little fruit but I couldn't nail the exact ingredient without reading the bottle (Bordeaux grapes). Light bodied with low carbonation, addictive and tasty."
"Quite carbonated, with a nice light body. Fruity, beautiful."
"Body is crisp and acidic with a delicate carbonation and a tart, dry finish. A well blended lambic that would pair well with a fine aged cheese."
"D-Without question my very most favorite Cantillon I have had the pleasure of trying. I love the near perfect combination of flavours, fruity, tart, dry, WOW! I really love this beer....I just wished it wasn't so rare and so expensive. The beer equivalent to a wine spritzer."
"D - I found this to be more drinkable than the Lou Pepe. This is a very nice sour lambic overall with a predominant oakiness and an abundant fruity tart character."
"Drinkability- The first drink really socks ya in the throat. Once you acclimate though it become VERY drinkable and hella enjoyable. The balance between funk and fruit is almost perfect and after smelling the beer I would have never have guessed. Absolutely fantastic brew that I'm o-so-glad I payed the price for. Can't wait to dig into more of these Cantillon brews in the near future."
"D - Drinkability is very good. Alcohol is hard to pick up over the other flavors. Everything comes together in this brew to make something very special. I would say the nose could use some work but the flavor really takes over and you really just forget about the aroma after the second sip. Cantillon really hit on a gold mine with this beer. Highly...highly recommended."
"Pours out a perfectly hazy red, almost a light purple. There was very little head. I poured it slowly, of course, but using the same procedure with any other wild ale has given me an inch or more of head. The smell is kind of hard to pick up on with such a small head, but I can get this oxidized red wine scent immediately. Definitely a good, strong wild yeast character. The taste is what really shines. There's the standard wild ale, the tart, sour candy sitting on top of a lighter bodied red wine. Kind of a vinegar taste, really a great example of a lambic, though I've never had one with grapes. The mouthfeel is right on, none of the chalky tartness, not overcarbonated, great. And I sped through this one, loving every drop, and it may not hit me too hard at 6%. I know its expensive, but don't give it a pass if you can afford it."
"Great great beer."
"For a style that's very difficult to drink this does OK. Sip over an evening...interestingly I enjoyed this with a leftover beef stew, courtesy of the beautiful bride. It really balanced the overall meal out well. This one's a real trip."
"Notes from: 7/22/05"
"My expectations where met with a standout beer."
"St. Lamvinus is exceptional, bold, and another world-class sour beer from Cantillon."
"It is not one I will revisit at the price it is offered."
"Overall, it was a good but not great and not a top 100 in my opinion. For the price ($62), it was definitely not worth it. Wouldn't mind trying again to see if we had a bad bottle or something but only if someone else is paying ;-). Can't really recommend unless you can get a free taste of it."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark ruby red color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some tiny islands left behind. The nose is malty/yeasty, with some raspberries, strawberries, spices, and some oily scent. The taste is malty/yeasty, very sour, slight spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, quite different than other's of this style. Thanks Joe."
"750ml bottle 2006 vintage $32! It looks amazing, pink, red, cloudy with a puff of a pink head which fades to a ring of bubbles. It smells like musty lambic but not horsey, sour grapes,lemons, fantastic. It tastes like delicious sour grape juice, with a hint of must. The sourness is nice and the beer is really easy to drink."
"Super complex and amazing beer. I wish we had brought back a few more bottles of this."
"Overall, a very unique beer that is definitely worth a try! The acidic quality offers an interesting mix of beer and wine composition. Maybe I will let the next one sit in the cellar for awhile."
"Cantillon Saint Lamvinus pours a purplish red color with visible carbonation. Poured into a tulip, it sits more like a wine than a beer. Smell is a mix of sour tartness, hints of fruit, and a bit of funk. The taste is outstanding. Some funky and sour flavors hit up front and last throughout. The merlot grapes used in this brew are present as well, adding shades of wine to the overall flavor profile. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, and has a nice sour bite to it. Overall, this is a fantastic brew, and worthy of its reputation. Definitely not an everyday brew, but worth breaking out from time to time."
"Taste is mouthfuckering sour. Very astringent like eating on a grapeseed. The taste is only wine. The sourness reminds of the lambic, but other than that the beer is just an acidic wine."
"D: As it warms, it only gets better. I could drink this forever."
"This is the kind of sour that American brewers are trying to emulate. Easily up there with the best."
"This beer is very interesting. Cantillon is slowly but surely climbing its way to the top of the Mortal Kombat pillar getting ready to fight bearded Shang Tsung!"
"Pours a beautiful glowing ruby red color with a stark white head that has a tiny tiny touch of pink to it. Nose is super duper tart with alot of brett funk and sugar. Taste follows. Tart and funky as hell with a ton of wild flavor and puckering sour taste. some great fruitiness towards the end of the drag. Very dry finish. Mouthfeel is great and wonderfully dry with ample carbonation for the style. Drinkability is the best I have ever had for the style. A wonderful offering from Cantillon, and one I would love to have a couple bottles of in the cellar. Awesome lambic and one I certainly recommend to any sour beer enthusiast. Now if they could just make it a little bit cheaper!"
"Drinkability is insanely high for the type of beer this is. Alcohol is low making for easier consumption, but the flavor is quite good and the tartness is not overwhelming. Makes for quite an experience. I much prefer this to say Cantillon Iris."
"Poured into a wine glass. dark ruby color with almost no head at all. Aroma is very vinous with lots of sour funk. Tastes how you would think it was going to taste. Lots of lactic sourness some barnyard funk and lots of red wine taste. Puckering mouthfeel, crisp body. It's hard to draw the line here. I enjoyed this brew, but thought it might have been too wine like."
"Had on tap at Ebenezer's in a Cantillon wine-style glass. A most clear black cherry cola type color with a minimal head. Some spaced out carbonation bubbles floating up the side of the glass. Smells of old red wine, soem funky earthy smells, and some sour cherries. Tastes something like tart, sour cherrie and apple wine. Some lite fizziness, but not much. Some grape in there as well. As it warms, I get more tart red wine flavor. Great lambic mouthfeel and probably the most drinkable lambic I have had."
"Powerful stuff, but overall for the style, top notch."
"Drinkablity is wasn't to high for me, with to much wine and not enough funk. Still, I assume this barrel isn't aged beyond the brewery, and will probably grab a bottle at some point to stash for a few years. Maybe not worth the price of admission by the bottle though, it was $7 or 8 for a 10-12 oz pour at Belmont."
"Really good beer overall. The wine barrel aging adds a nice dimension. Great drinking experience, but it's hard to justify the $35 price tag."
"Tastes dry and sour with nice sweet malt to balance. Berry fruity is dried out, but quite prominent. Some brettanomyces horseblanket character is present, but just one player in the complex nature of this beer. Clean dry puckering. Fruity flavor despite the driness is quite impressive accomplishment. Strong carbonation helps clean the palate. Wonderful drinkability. Light fruity dry crisp, yet leaves a lingering berry and horseblanket."
"One of the greatest beers I've ever had, and the vinous/oaky characteristics are truly sublime. If I hadn't tasted Isabella Proximus earlier today, I might actually be even more glowing in my review than I am. But, so it goes."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Utterly dry, sour and acidic with plenty of dry vinous flavor to balance things out. The lambic base is fairly dominant here, but the character of the grapes and barrel shine through just enough to give it depth beyond your average lambic. The marriage of lambic and red wine grapes makes for a profoundly dry mouthfeel."
"Overall this may be my favorite of the Cantillon beers I have tried so far. It was just a touch shy of the Beatification in terms of being the funkiest, most sour thing I have ever had. I mean this was just delicious. I a, glad I was able to finally acquire a bottle of this as it was more then worth the weight. I have yet to get bored in this style and I wished more people were able to get into it. So complex and so rich, this is definitely the one to seek out. Well deserved of its reputation and something I would always pick up if I saw it!"
"D : Except for the price, this is probably my favorite lambic and I would love to have more."
"Easy drinker, must have more, estimate was $35 per bottle, these guys are geniuses aren't they? I can't think of another beer that is more interesting, but more than a glass I'm not sure."
"Pours like a cranberry spritzer with transluscency and a bubbly appearance. Smell is fruity, sour and acidic and slightly funky and sweaty. Taste is very fruity with some grapes, and red fruit like notes. Tart grape, and cranberry come to mind. Smooth and lightly thin in the middle and finishes dry. Carbonation is light but sufficient. Very unique and enjoyable."
"Not my idea of a good beer. Trying to drink something like this is just absolutely no fun. Thank God I only got a very small glass (which even then I was unable to finish)."
"There's not much else I can say about this beer. I think it was from 2003. One of the best."
"Flavor is mild compared to other Cantillons, subdued juicy tartness with a slight pucker. Very light wild element, minor cider character. Clearly defined wine grape flavors, without much wood to balance. Easy to sip or gulp, at the price, i'll be sipping."
"A wonderful lambic with some amazing fruit flavors blended in. While this is an outstanding beer, I'm not sure it beats out Fou Foune in my ranks of Cantillon sours."
"Highly recommended to any lambic fan, or a fan of good beer in general."
"D- I like this beer a lot. Not overly sour and quite drinkable. Really nice lambic from Cantillon."
"I urge you to investigate if you haven't already!!"
"Pours a hazed ruby red/pink, thick and fizzy pinkish head forms, leaves some lace on the glass, settles to a thin ring around the glass. Smell is wicked, grapes, fruit, citrus acidity, wine, sulphur, wheat, cherries, funky barnyard, really complex. Taste is crazy, very tart, cherries and concord grapes, oak, vinegar, citrus, bread, wheat, fruity acidic finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, puckering sour, still very drinkable. Amazing Lambic, deserves all its praise."
"Overall, I had higher expectations, which was very affected by the high price, and so admittedly, a bit unfair. I ran the gamut of food pairings (cheese, meats, sweets) and came up with hardly any pairings that were neutral at best. (Perhaps a very fresh, sweet, cow's milk cheese or HEAVY chocolate dessert may work? I did not have these available to me at time of tasting). Taken as an apertif, this has more appeal- it is excellent for opening taste buds for later food/beverages with its sharpness and fruit character, and is most definitely for sipping. But unfortunately, this is a fairly price prohibitive beer and for my tastes, did not justify itself."
"I tried this beer on tap at the Belgian festival at Max's in Baltimore, Maryland. The bartender recommended it, and I was glad he did. It had a beautiful pinkish color, with just a finger's width of white head. The smell spoke very strongly for the sip that was to follow. Slightly sour, slightly sweet, and a nice floral fruit taste. You get a nice pucker in your throat that adds to the experience of the beer. If you have a chance to try this beer, I would highly recommend that you do."
"drinkability is great. excellent depth. great funky sourness without acidity. no trace of alcohol. nice balance between the funk, sourness, and other character. curious how other vintages compare. i'll be on the lookout for this one."
"Pours a clouded ruby red. A small ring of white head lines the top of the glass. Nose is straight up lambic funk. Taste brings the funk still. Mild sour attributes. At least I think they are milder than they were on the bottle. I am not sure if the cask has something to do with the rounding out of that, but who cares. There it is. Mild sweet tones off fruit and grapes. Obvious, but still slightly subdued grape characteristics there. Oh to hell with it. As you can see from my scores, I think this is as good on cask as it is from the bottles. A joy to be able to have on this special occassion. I'm sorry you weren't there to be able to enjoy it with me."
"Overall: One of, if not the best, lambic beer I've ever drank. Hefty price tag but well worth it every once in a while."
"I bought this for my anniversary, but we ended up drinking cocktails instead, so I decided to review this for my 500th review instead. I'd been wanting to try this for a while as I love Cantillon's brews, but it is quite spendy. Looks like cloudy pinot noir or unfiltered pressed cherry juice. Thin, wispy head. The smell is winey with cherries, sour aromas, and some funkiness. Woody bitterness at the end. Taste is somewhat similar- sour, bitter, and complex. Slightly funky bitter finish at the end. The mouthfeel is sharp, tart, and refreshing. Very drinkable, and although this is somewhat sour and funky, I find it less so than many of the other Cantillons. This one is winier and more delicate. All in all, I think I slightly prefer the slightly more robust products from them- though this is mighty fine."
"A nice take on the style. The cranberry that came up in just about every description was a nice change of pace."
"My daughter-in-law says it is much better cold."
"I'm in love"""
"taste was all of the above, except for much more intense grape skin sourness, waves of sourness cascaded into my tounge and into muscles in the back of my jaws. mostly sour grapes, and raspberry, and a wonderful medicinal nursing home funkiness. the best lambic i've had, and one of my favorites."
"The pour reveals a enigmatic reddish pinkish color with a lightly pink head. The head quickly becomes a miniscule ring that emits very little lace. Streams of tiny carbonation bubbles are visible in abundance. Lambic smells burst out of the bottle with this one. Some musty damp barnyard mingles with cider and some tannins. the taste follows suit with plenty of earthy brett flavors, some cidery and sharp flavors and loads of puckering sourness. A spectacular balance comes from the expanse of fruit flavors in tow. Very ripe grape flesh, bitter grape skin and assorted berries and citrus in the background. It reminds me of a good full bodied red wine. The finish is long and complex with biting acidity melded with fruit sweetness. The mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated and somewhat viscous, something Ive noticed in many lambics."
"Todd the beer guy at McKean and Charles in Waldoboro got this beer and then cellared it for me until I managed to get up there for it. Just a quick plug to try his establishment. I was saving this beer for a special occasion. Nothing special was on the horizon, so I broke down and drank it after holding it for a month. A 750ml bottle, with the label stating it was bottled 25Oct2006. Poured into a tulip glass, it was an amazing ruby red color with a touch of orange. A small head quickly dissipated, leaving a very still beer. It had a fruity aroma which seemed mostly cherry, and was also on the musty side (I mean that in a good way). Pleasant fruity taste, but what really was really striking was the degree of tartness. I've had other lambics from Cantillon that were nowhere near this tart. A wonderful, smooth beer. Great to drink, although I couldn't do a steady diet of lambics. Share this with your wife or significant other."
"Cantillon Saint Lamvinus is a unique beer from one of the world's most unique brewers. I'm not sure I have the chops to completely break it down and appreciate where it fits into the pantheon of great lambics, but I sure do love the inspired attempt at beer-wine fusion. This is a beer that is meant to be consumed with gusto and a beer that deserves to be celebrated."
"This was the second lambic beer I have tried, although I had a hard time deciding if this was a wine or a beer. It looked beautiful; it had the color of wine (a rich burgundy red) as well as the head from a beer. The taste was nothing but strange. It was dry-ish like a wine, but it was well balanced and had beer attributes. My palate was very confused the whole time as it was trying to decide if it was drinking merlot or beer. I enjoyed the drink overall, and I had no trouble drinking it since I like the dryness of wine. A very balanced beverage."
"I had previously tried this beer in bottle a year or so ago. Now on tap. The beer was served with no head to speak of but with a vibrant red hazy body. The nose was very Cantillon as expected. Nice and earthy with a real vinous quality to it. As if the nose was not enough, the taste gives you even more. There is a sweet but yet very sour, barny punch to this beer. It all works out very well if you are a fan of lambics and very sour ones for that matter. Just really really tastey and pleasing to the taste buds."
"Got this one on the recommendation of the bartender, Elliot, at Monk's, which I respect a lot. Pours an amazing deep pink-red, with a very mild head on top. Nose is quite sour, a little sweet fruit too. Taste is similar; this beer is incredibly sour, a hint of sweet raspberry deliciousness as well, but overall a quite not-sweet beer. Interesting, and respectable for what they've created, but not one I'd go out of my way for. Feel is full and tasty. Overall, a beer that one should try at least once, just because it's so out-there, but not one I'd enjoy more than every once in a long while."
"Drinkability...not doing it for me, but it's the best sour beer that i've tried."
"Was it worth it? Yes and noTo try once, it was absolutely worth it. To drink regularly, I would have to say it would not be. For my dollar, I would take Oude Beersel or Hansens kriek geuzes on a regular basis over this. Still, I have to admit that a beer so well crafted is most certainly deserving of its high price. God bless Cantillon for this."
"The beer poured a cloudy raspberry with only a little white lace. There was not much aroma, but it was of fruit. The taste was tart fruits. The feel was amazingly light dry with a great tart finish. Quite a wonderful beer, it really let the gueze come through and left the fruit to accent the beer. Definately a beer I will buy in the future when available."
"Too tart to be extremely drinkable. A sipper to be sure. Still... delicious."
"D: The bitter acidity is too tart to make for a reliable drink."
"I am very hesitant to give anything a perfect 5. I certainly have not done it yet. But from the very first sips, I knew that anything less would not suffice. So, well done Cantillon! Saint Lamvinus gets my very first 5.0!"
"D: Allow this to come up to temp and just have a grand old time sipping on this. Awesome!"
"The flavor was intensely tart, with all of the barnyard and sweat character of the aroma, but less intensity. The mustiness and barnyard was wrapped within a fuller, non-descript fruit tartness... suggestions of grape and cherry, perhaps from the wine barrel. Metallic and mineralish within. Initially puckering, it finishes just as dry, but short-lingering. Utterly intense!"
"Mouthfeel is tart, medium bodied, vinuous, sweet & tart, dry, slightly acidic but mellow."
"Drinkability: As it warms it actually becomes a bit more rough. The acidity becomes even more pronounced and the tartness forcing the pucker becomes more and more intense. If you want to avoid that, Then it is best to drink this shortly after opening, and boy it does go down nicely, but I recommend sharing it, despite the $30-$40 price tag. It is a lot of sour. Personally, I love it, I could handle putting it in my kegorator, if I was interested in spending the $450 for a quarter barrel keg."
"I had it on draft at Capone's in Norristown, PA. It poured a strawberry-red color, and while it looked thick, the texture was fine and smooth. The tangy grapefruit flavor prevents it from going down smooth, however. The sourness forces you to hold it in your mouth and that's when other flavors become apparent. I tasted some light berry and grape notes that gave a slight sweetness to balance the sour. The smell is not sweet, as it had a strong, funky barnyard odor. This is not a fruity beer for framboise fans. This one is perfect for Cantillon and geuze fanatics. Let it warm up and the flavor will be very enjoyable."
"Overall, ordered this one first since it was the highest listed of the Cantillon. At least I didn't get robbed for a full bottle of this one."
"D - Great! I loved the sourness! This one is fantastic, It actually lives up to the hype!"
"Second try at the lambic style, and quite drinkable for a hop-head. I enjoyed it, and it was even better with my lunch (mussels). I am going to have to explore this style a bit more."
"Drinkability: this is a strong flavored beer that is a slow sipper. At $29 a bottle, drinkability is lower from a financial standpoint, and the flavor profile is unique and is as far from a session beer as you can get. Absolute great beer worth shelling out the money for at least once."
"Ruby red with garnet highlights and a light haze, the foam was a vibrant pink and quite fluffy. As the head settled to a thick ring, there was a bit of lacing, but nothing that really stuck. Incredible, complex aroma. There was strong barnyard funkiness, the distinct smell of horse, and a little vinegar. Also thrown in were light tobacco notes, some tart fruit, and a vinous character (like a merlot or burgundy). Very tart flavour, like raspberry seeds with a bit of sour cherry thrown into the mix. Puckering. Some earthiness became evident as it warmed, with notes of leather and barnyard increasing. Sweet grapes gave it a bit of red wine quality as well. Crisp carbonation to start, but this faded quickly to a gentler texture mid-sip. Nice body with significant dryness. I really enjoyed this and I'm glad I have some more Cantillon bottles to try out soon. There was a lot of complexity if you looked for it, but on the surface was a wonderful tart beer that was quite drinkable."
"I could not believe it when I saw that this was on cask last ngiht at the moan and dove in amherst. I usually can't really handle the sour cantillon beers because of their acidity, but this was too good an oppurtunity to pass up. I poured a beautiful red rasberry color into a glass that resembled one used for champagne. No head on this one really. Smell definitely had that baryard funk found in most Cantillon beers, with some sweet tart smells going on as well. First taste was huge on the sour notes. The second sip however, revealed a circus of fruit lying behind the initial sour notes. I think the fact that it was cask conditioned may have mellowed some of the sourness of it a bit. Mouthfeel was simply awesome....the more you let it swish around the mouth, the more intense flavors you get. One glass was enough for me...I would have liked more, but I didn't want intense heartburn, so I switched to something else. Simply a delightful beer. I'm not sure I would shell out the forty bucks for it, but who knows. Well done Cantillon."
"Drinkability: This is 180 degrees from Lindeman's, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be tasting. Very puckering, very sour, good though. I will have to approach this again."
"Tart, with a bone dry finish. Lush raspberry, and dried cherry flavors. Spicey, flowery and full of deliciously drinkable. Great one too change the mood."
"Worth about $30 a bottle? As an occassional treat - it is a good lambic. Serves as a nice apperitif or to pair with a fruity desert."
"Drinkability/notes: Quite sublime in its excellence, to experience it is to shuffle, however ineptly, towards greatness. My thanks to my friend and fellow BA HardTarget for his generosity in sharing this superb, rare, and costly fruit Lambic."
"This is the Grand Daddy of all Lambics!"
"Poured out a transparent red brew producing a relatively thin head of creamy pink bubbles. The nose was musty, oaken, and earthy. Floral, fields of hay and alfalfa. Freshly turned earth. The taste was like tart grape skins, sour cherry, complex, clean oak, fruity, mildly acidic. Mouthfeel was medium with lingering subtle sourness in the finish and aftertaste. Minimal carbonation. Expensive. Worth it? I dunno. But really damn good."
"Overall: A fantastic fruit lambic, the fruit is present without being overpoweringly sweet. There's also a nice strong tartness and funkiness that I like. This beer is definitely worth my first 5.0."
"Drinkability: This is probably the last time I will ever get to try this beer, it is just to expensive, but also very delicious and drinkable. I can appreciate what Cantillon does, they are very good at the craft of lambics."
"Drinkability- Wasn't let down, but I wasn't really blown away either. I was expecting a bit more out of a $32 bottle of beer. Still a pretty good beer, just not willing to dole out that much money again for it. Am a novice at matching beers with cheese, but a cheese expert said that Pierre Robert cheese (brie like) would pair nicely with it. I really didn't see it though. It did pair really well with dried cherries though...wow, did it!"
"This beer pours a rusty maroon with a thin white head and no lacing. The smells gives off the aromas of grapes along with some sourness characteristic of a lambic. The taste was fantastic. It hits you immediately with its sourness but turns into more of a sour grape taste mixed in with some granny smith apples. The mouthfeel was right on. Perfect body with nice carbonataion. Overall got to be one of the best lambics out there. Nice job to Brasserie Cantillon for brewing such an exceptional and unique beer."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very commanding sweet and sour smell and taste. The beer is light bodied. The beer is oddly refreshing inspite of the acidity. Dam this was a great beer! The beer is a bit expensive $30.00 but what a treat. The beer was very hard to put down. I had to make myself wait during the second pouring of the bottle for it to warm up. The beer went very well with semi sweet dark chocolate."
"2003 poured into a beer flute. Beautiful ruby/burnt orange color, practically no head, thin body, but not watery. Very complex smell and taste. Smells or granny smith apple, tart cherries, musty grapes and a pleasant ""funky yeast"" smell. Taste as smells with the apple and cherry predominant and slight vanilla taste. Very nice mouthfeel, feels thicker than what one would expect. The taste is initially sweet then becoming sour and then sweet on the backtaste in a very nice way. This is possibly too drinkable. The alcohol is used exceptionally and I wanted more and more. Note: This pair very nicely with dark chocolate."
"taste initially hits with a slight grape sweetness, which is quickly washed away with a nice puckering tartness. powerful if slightly one-noted. light-medium body with a spritzy tight carbonation. underwhelming only due to the price (this is the most expensive beer i've ever had). there's really no off-notes and it comes through as tart, refreshing beer, but i can't see ponying up the cash for another for a long while."
"Pleasing and drinkable, interesting and likeable."
"Thanks to Stonecrusher for the trade."
"Beer is good. Happy sour tart beering."
"Note: As I was enjoying this great beer, I was thinking what would go good with it to make a perfect Sunday Afternoon, so I slapped in a great Jazz CD (Monk's Dream), and opened another precious gift a Cuban Cigar, I was in Beer/Cigar & Music Nirvana!"
"D- This is an interesting fruit lambic but I thought the aroma was a bit one-dimensional and I didn't get the depth and complexity out of the fruit that I was expecting."
"Follow-up 4/8/06 After trying this at Monk's Cafe, I sourced some separately and tried it, wondering how the temperature issue at monk's had impacted taste. This bottle, cork-dated 2004, is very similar to the one reviewed above. maybe a little darker in color, less musty in nose, a LOT more carbonation, but the same issues with short taste and finish exist. This does seem to be a characteristic of lambics (this is a blend of 2 lambics AFAIK) versus complexity found in gueuze."
"2004 bottling. too young? who's to say. worth the $33 spent? probably..."
"Very drinkable, but I like Cantillon funkiness. I've had this before with more grape notes and less funkiness. This shant be the last time I try this one out."
"Bottle: Poured a medium red color lambic with a huge bubbly head with average retention. Aroma is sour with some touch of sweetness. Taste is quite a surprise with less acidity then I would have expected from Cantillon with a nice balance between the grapes and the lambic. Carbonation is quite strong and body is quite light. Well balance tart and sweetness with the grapes less dominant then expected. Probably one of the only Cantillon that I wouldnt mind drinking a whole 750ml by myself on a hot summer day."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4"" light pink head above the clear red brew, and it seems to glow when held up to the light. Head lasted pretty well, with minimal lacing. Aroma is barnyard tart, and apparent as soon as the cork was popped. Quite pervasive. Taste is super tart from the get-go, seems to shock the tongue in the middle, then you cross the hump, and it closes with a very dry grape tinge. Mouthfeel and drinkability are par for the style, although I admit I was hoping for a bit more depth in the fruit character. A nice treat, but I concur with others that the price is somewhat prohibitive."
"The bottom line..it's not worth the $35 per bottle."
"Bottled 2003. Nice shortliving head and almost clear but opalising deep red beercollor. Nose is exceptional, bretty, good farmstable with lots of oak, dry hay and that sweaty horses in the back. Good sourness and obvious grapejuice make it and overall most impressive nose. Taste is sour but after getting used too most impressive too, giving grapes, oak, dry bitterness and sourish aftertaste. Yes this goes all the way and good carbonisation witch is high but fitting making mouthfeel IMO perfect too. Greatly enjoying every sip of it and wished wy girlfriend wouldn't like it so I could enjoy the whole 750 just by myself."
"I'd had a few real lambics and gueuzes before this and they all impressed me, this did also. It grew on me, at first i wasnt overly impressed, i thought the body was very thin and the flavours a bit one dimensional but as you have a few more sips, then a few more it becomes a much more flavourful and deep beer, great stuff. A grade A lambic, but not something i'd drink everyday"
"2003... Poured a cloudy reddish color with a small white head that quickly diminished to nothing. Vinous, burgandy grapes, funky brett, and stinky socks aroma. Smooth but tart taste. This is very much wine like, grapes, light sweetness, and finishing with that signature tart Cantillon taste. Lots of tart lemon present in the taste. A very nice fruit lambic and one that I looked long and hard for."
"I enjoyed it, but nothing special."
"This beer is very good. However, at $35 a bottle this is a beer that I most likely wont be purchasing again. In fact I needed an excuse to validate the expense. My 1000th review on BA seemed like a fitting reason. And so I make the purchase a few months ago. I split my bottle with my girlfriend; it was a lovely experience (considering she is a Belgian rookie). I am happy I tried this rare gem but it really wasnt as great as I would have liked, regardless of the price. I have no complaints well, I do wish the nose was louder and deeper and I do wish the palate had more malt. Regardless, I found this beer to be drinkable, likeable, and something I would say is worthy a try."
"Appears a dark purpleish-red color, with a bit of your typical beery-amber color coming through, though it's taken over with the more exotic colors. Fairly brash smell, sharp and stinging, sour, and with hay and horse blanket hints. I don't usually use that adjective (horse blanket), and I usually think that typical lambic ""funk"" is more of a sweaty sock smell, but this one I have to admit is particularly horsey. Taste is all over the place, but comes together in a really subtle yet complex way. Whereas some labics taste blatantly like a particular fruit (rasperries or cherries, for example) this one has more of a blend of fruity tastes. Grapes, and grape skins, fresh from the vine, yes, but also hints of dark cherries and other fruits. There's also a great fresh wood character in there, that was particularly enhanced by drinking this beer outside, which I highly recommend. Everything about this beer was so fresh, it just feels like you're blending in with the grass outside. That sounded a little hippyish, but that's how I felt when I drank this beer. Super dry mouthfeel makes it all come together. Really a world class beer here, living up to all the hype. Though hype really isn't a good word here, and doesn't fit the beer. The Saint Lamvinus is simply a delicious beer, from one of the world's most distinct breweries. Enjoy it."
"Drinkability and Notes  While I respect this beer, the exceedingly high price and sourness make this a one time purchase for me. I enjoyed this but not that much more than the standard Cantillon Kriek. If you have some extra money kicking around, and you love lambics, particularly those from Cantillon, pick one of these up for a special occasion."
"Drinkability is OK, takes a good while to get used to. It has a nice saison quality to it that I tend to like over the other true lambics that Cantillon is known for. Think of it as a vinegar spiked red wine blended with a saison."
"750 ml corked and capped bottle. Bottled in 2003 on the cork. Above and on the cork was some thick brown liquid. Purchased at Green's in Atlanta, GA for $28.75. Most expensive single bottle of beer I ever purchased. Perhaps it should be sampled fresher, but without ripping off the foil, there was no way to know the age till the top is popped and the cork was extracted."
"pours a magnificant ruby purple color. Smells tart and of lambic funk. Some slight grape and wine aromas are present. There is some grape flavor up front, but mainly dominated by the lactic acid flavor. Very tart and is really lip smackingly good. Very dry in the mouth. This is much like a very tart wine. I can't say I have anything like this before. The sour grape flavor is very outstanding and unique. But priced a little high in my mind."
"Expensive. Powerful sourness from tannins of the skins, with bursting aroma of oak and berries. Beautiful. The Palate cleaner. Not for the novice, but certainly a hit. Astringent yet balanced. I saved this for the boys, Radekfest 05 sample 26. An experience to be had once."
"Cork says 2003: This beer poured a couldy amber color with red undertones and formed a light pink bubbly head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of lambic elements, with a definate red wine character to it. The flavor is a very traditional non sweet lambic with a good deal of sourness to it without overpowering it. The body is medium light and slightly heavier than most lambics. The finish is quite astrigent with some if the winelike sourness present. This is a very outstanding beer."
"This beer is Bone Dry. Sahara Desert Dry. And the carbonation is ever so subtle. The body is about medium or so. And this beer leaves you wanting more, sip after sip, until it is gone..."
"Had this at Rich O's Public House and shared with three other people. $40 for a 750mL bottle. Good thing we shared it. Pours a brilliant light red color with a very small head, which was expected. Lots of funky stuff going on in the aroma. Fruit (grape), sweetness, sour, acid, it's all there. The flavor was very much the same as the aroma predicted. Strange tart/sour character with a great background flavor from the grapes. Very complex. There's a lot going on here. Very enjoyable. Very odd as well. I'm glad I got to try this one."
"$39.75 at Rich-O's Public House in New Albany, IN. 750mL bottle shared with kmpitz2, clvand0, and another fellow homebrewer and poured into a chalice. It pours a light burgundy color with one finger of head that dies down quickly. There is a touch of lacing left on the glass. The smell has that great Cantillon funk with some red grape sweetness. It really draws you in and keeps you wanting more and more. The taste is amazing. Lots of sweet and sour, with some funkiness. Dry grapes smashed under a horse's saddle. The complexity almost made my head explode. The mouthfeel had sizzling carbonation that just popped on the tongue, unlike any other beer I've experienced. The drinkability was through the roof. Going through a few of these would be hard on the wallet, but easy on the palate. This beer is everything a lambic was meant to be."
"This rare treat was shared between 4 people last night, and I have to believe that I will have to drink this beer again, without the other 3 glasses being shared. The liquid pours a beautiful rosey ruby color with a finger of spritzey head that immediately fallst to ring the beer with large bubbles. This one is very wine-like in the color, somewhere between a blush and a dark red. The nose was true to the Cantillon form. Funky, sour, acidic, but with a nice fruity grape coming in behind the funk, smelling so damn good. The flavor. What can one say about liquid nirvana; something so awesome that I would be happy to drink exclusively for the rest of my life. What struck me most was how mellow and smooth this was. I've had a few of the Cantillon line, but this was every bit as funkey, but much more mellow. Still sour and acidic and tart, but not puckering. The grape flavor hits secondarily behind the initial burst of sour and acid, but it serves to polish this beer like the finest diamond. The feel was a weak moderate to moderate, wtih a light, dancing bubble on my tonge. Nothing that got in the way, but enough to know it was there. Awesome balance on the pucker factor. Wow...wow, wow, wow. If there is anything left to say about the drinkability that can't be drawn from what I've already said, I don't know what it would be. Hunt this beer. Drink this beer. Love this beer. So good."
"This special treat was brought to a beer party by someone else. Wow, what a treat. It pours a pinkish red with a swirling white head of tiny bubbles. The aroma is yeasty sweet with a dry wine scent. The flavor is a sour, dry, and fruity red wine flavor. It is pungent and tart with notes of pear flesh. Going back and reading the bottle I saw that this beer is made with Bordeaux grapes. This is unlike any beer I've ever had and probably will ever have again. Excellent beer."
"Very typical Cantillon quality. Vibrant red color has a touch of violet in it. Surprisingly still in appearance despite the bold effervesence on the tongue. Sour nose with an especially vomitous, bile-like aroma. Ah, lovely, lovely Cantillon. Pressing deeper, one is hard-pressed to evade the grape skin and cranberry redolence present under the initial funk. Fruity cranberry sweetness and mild bitterness blend nicely with a potent sourness. It's quite sour, though I think of their fruit lambics, this is more nominal and par for the course (meaning consistent, not poor) than it is exceptional. Spectacular beer."
"2003 edition had at the Moan and Dove. Deep pinky brownish cherry body. Almost no head, but theres that mysterious cloudiness I love in some bottle-conditioned beers which just seems to make the color complex. Huge aroma, very clean, balsamic, lightly farmy and surprisingly pretty sweet. Floral sweetness, dessert sauce, red wine-ish.. This defines classy. Field notes. Complex woody oak-like character. On the tongue, you really taste the grape skins out of it. Acidity level is masterfully controlled. Just the right lactic bite. It evolves into a malic fruitiness, passes through a moldy temporary state and finishes very leafy with remarkable mouth puckering properties. Cantaloup, pomegranate.. Big mouthfeel, full bodied, moderately carbonated, perfectly fitting imo and enhances global flavour deployment. Dryness hits you up and leaves a toy of an astringency with which I spent several minutes experimenting sips of water. What can I say, water tasted just sooo good after a sip of st-lamvinus. A beer that will haunt my memories for a long while. Post taste actually doesnt last all that long, but I still found myself trying to suck out the remaining flavours out of my tongue, like struggling for the last red grape of a whole harvest. Unique. This is to sip with respect, not that its not drinkable."
"I wouldn't pay the ~40 US$ price tag I saw at a few stores in the States, but if you can get one from the brewery at a very reasonable 8 euro, don't hesitate."
"Rediculas neon raspberry color with a slight pale white head. Beauty in a goblet. Hand carried from the brewery by my good friend Andrew. Smells like (and I mean this in the best way possible) what my girlfiend puked up on the carpet in my dorm room after attending a very good high quality red wine tasting . Acidic rounded and berrylike in the nose. Very clean and dry upfront with a rounded fruity berry like (blackberry/raspberry) mellowness. A touch of barnyard love but it is a very clean drinkable brew. Smoothish soft loving mouth with little bubbles on the tongue. The brew just WONDERFUL!"
"Well after trying many of the Cantillon offerings I was ready to see what all the hype was about this brew. Pours a cloudy ruby red with a skimish white head that leaves no lace. Aromas are of a typical lambic, but almost a little more subtle. There was the classic barnyard, pungent sourness / tartness and just a slight slight hint of grape. For flavor this beer was just incredible. Smooth and well rounded this beer starts off sour and tart, but it just doesn't overwhelm the pallate like most Cantillon's. There was only the slightest hint of grape flavor and just a little carbonation, but it was enough to just add a little extra something to this beer. The Saint finished a little acidic but not overwhelming like so many other lambics, with just the right amount of sourness to keep this beer very drinkable. By far of all the Cantillon's this is the best, just well textured, good balance of flavors between the tartness and sourness, and the acidic fruit flavors. Though it may be a bit pricey, if you see this around, its definetly worth the pick up."
"I understand now."
"The cork removed with nary a pop, the expected semi-sour barnyard aroma pushed through the narrow neck and hit my nose. The aroma was very strong, very traditional Cantillon with slight hints of grape. The pour, while plenty vigorous, resulted in no head, merely a brilliant hazy red, semi-viscous liquid.. Little to no carbonation, but an excellent prickle during the swallow. Unlike many other Cantillon lambics, it was completely smooth and perfectly balanced, no overwhelming acidic or sour bite, just enough initial lambic traits, then smooth and satisfying. Wow a traditional lambic with this perfect of drinkability; I could have sipped on it all night. For any lambic lover, worth spending the time, energy, and money to obtain a bottle. I dont believe it will be a revelation for anyone who has enjoyed other Cantillon lambics, but a very, very nice addition to their line."
"Having this be my first true Lambic will for sure make all other that I have pale in comparison. This one poured a great ruby red color with with not too much head but a great ammount of bubbles that added greatly to the visual appeal. The smell was nice and sour, with sour grape notes and sharp cheese scents. The taste was wonderfull with a great dry flavor of citrus and vinegar. The stuff was so smoothe I could have had the whole bottle! This is a beer to behold for sure."
"As for the lambic, this is easily the best lambic in the world, and I hope that someday I'll be able to reminisce about my good 'ol days here at school with another glass of this. Cheers to Mr. Jean-Pierre van Roy for this masterpiece, and I know that I will have this one again."
"Bright ruby red in color. Fine champagne bubbles. Great nose of slight wet horse blanket with fruit undertones. Smooth in the mouth not as upfront in your face sour as there others definatly more refined. Same tecture of wine, like silk running over your tongue.Hints of roses and nice fine tannins."
"Update (July 2008): Just tried the second of my 2003 S. Lamvinus bottles. As expected, the fruitiness of the grapes is gone, leaving the tartness of the lambic. The aroma is a lemony sourness with red wine vinegar and hints of sour socks and creamy goat cheese. The flavor is quite tart, but not overly lip-puckering. Hints of cork, mold, grape skins, popcorn, and an enteric bitterness in the aftertaste. I asked my wife to try it, too. She remembered the aroma, but grimaced at the sharp sourness."
"I'll admit I am a sucker for lambics, but this is possibly the greatest one I have ever had. It was the 2001 bottling. It is light purple in color with a sour, winey aroma. It has all the flavors of a traditional lambic, the horse sweat, the musty cellar, the floral/honey notes, but then it finishes with a dry grape finish. The merlot and cabernet franc grapes add a nice dimension and complexity to an already amazing beer."

"Closing Notes: Get this beer any way that you can, it *IS* most definately worth it!!!"
"Drinkable like you wouldn't believe, once you have the palate for these traditional fruit lambics, you will never go back. The question that everyone seems eager to ask, however: is it worth the price? Well, if you're a traditional lambic fiend like myself, most definitely YES. I look forward to seeing how some aged bottles come out in a few years. This beer clearly has the acidity and structure to fare well in a cellar. Hard to describe, but a delight to drink."
"Stunning, contemplative, world class; these are all words that just do not do justice to this beer. Please Jean-Pierre, make this a regular beer in your line-up."
"I am truly not worthy & forever indebted to yen157 for this offering, your Sainthood is in the Mail."
