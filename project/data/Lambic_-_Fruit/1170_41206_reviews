"So very sour. Light raspberry flavor with a lot of acidity."
"Very sour, lactic, acidic, light raspberry, oak, lemon"
""
""
""
"super juicy, but really acidic."
""
""

"Raspberry sour warhead.  Poured out, light purple pinkish.  Wispy white head that faded fast.  Smelled of lacto, berries and a bit of fusel alcohol.  Pretty classic Upland.  I found this to be maybe slightly less than full throttle on the Upland Sour spectrum.  Very enjoyable."

"Batch 71-09.  Bottled 3-17-12. Beautiful looking beer. Clear.  Tartness became bracing a little too quickly for my liking, otherwise a fantastic beer.  A 4.75+ beer as a first impression."

"Note - revised to reduce score because the sourness produced a stomach ache later that night; still a good beer, but I feel the powerful sour may be a bit over the top based on my later experience."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: did I say this one was sour? it may easily be the most sour beer I have tried, and still pretty delicious at that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A treat and enjoyed and would have again and again."

"Its expressive carbonation prickles at the tongue and enlivens the sour taste of the beer. Though the ale may be slightly fuller than the driest lambics on the market, its carbonation and acidity counters nicely en route to a dryish and tangy fruit-forward finish."
""
""
""
"Gorgeous raspberry color with an immensely fizzy head. Sour, tart nose with a natural earthy raspberry and a mineral aspect. The flavor is a pucker factor times ten with strong tart and sour raspberry. The raspberry is a very natural freshly picked flavor with some earth tones and maybe a bit of mineral. The puckering flavor obviously translates to feel but it's without the vinegar feel. This is a straightforward, unabashed raspberry sour!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly clear light red until the sediment is reached at the end of the bottle. Then, it's murky. The aroma is very acetic, with citric acid notes, and raspberry sweetness. There is a subtle touch of yeasty funk. Flavor is one of the most sour things I've ever tasted. Notes of oak and raspberry weave a tapestry along with the acetic, citric, and lactic acid, creating a really rewarding experience. It's impressive that, despite the incredibly sour taste, there's enough berry and wood character to shine and really make this beer a standout. Definitely couldn't drink a full bottle in one sitting, though."
"O- This is my first sour from Upland. I enjoyed it for what it was. I wonder if the flavors would mellow with a year or if they would just get more intense. This one is right on the edge of being too sour."

"Still, the rasberry fruit flavor is there and the beer is filled of flavor. I find that most will have a hard time with this one, unless they truly enjoy extreme tartness."
"It was ok. I would have liked more sweetness to cut the acidity but otherwise a decent raspberry lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Extremely sour, as I imagined it would be due to what I've heard, but tons of raspberry and oak. Very nice birthday treat."

"O - This is one of the better Upland sours that I've had as it is tart and packs a lot of the fruit flavor. It is definitely a tart lambic as it has minimal funky characteristics to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Better than I expected but reappy goddamn sour."
""

"O: Not as great as the traditional Belgian framboise but definitely a crazy acidic sour raspberry beer."

"O-I love raspberries but this was too sweet and didn't have enough funk/sour/tart whatever you want to call it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely one of the most sour lambic style beers I've hever had. I definitely enjoyed this one however as I'm a fan of raspberries and I enjoyed the sweet, jammy-like qualities to this one as well."
""
""
"Poured into the sampler glass from the bottle, the beer was a reddish hue like Cherry 7up with a nice tinted white head. The aroma smelled of sour fruits with a variety of berry notes observable. In the initial taste, one can immediately tell this is a raspberry lambic. The acidity seemed to mellow toward the aftertaste as the beer became sweeter. One also could detect vanilla with the modest sour notes. The aftertaste further displays quite a bit of natural seedy raspberry flavor. It is easy to tell his is made with real berries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit of a disappointment, I must confess. I was hoping for more lambic qualities, but instead I got something very, very similar to Raspberry Tart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium light bodied and a bit more aggressively carbonated than expected but the feel works and helps to make this almost refreshing. Overall this will be an eye opener for fans of Lindemans or Raspberry Tart but should really appeal to sour and funk fanatics."
""
"Heavily carbonated, but while this is usually a turn-off for me, it works in this context. Upland nails it once again!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed reddish pink color with a tall light pink head. Intense raspberry aroma. Lightly acetic with a very intense lactic acidity. Lemon juice, lemon zest, and plenty of fruit. Mild oak with a touch of sweetness. A bit of a funky blue cheese thing to it, too. The flavor is really very sour. Heavy on the lactic acidity and quite a bit of raspberry flavor. The blue cheese funk is there, too, which I like quite a bit. A touch of oak and maybe a bit of must."
"Pours a murky dark red with no head and no lacing on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with lots of raspberry and raspberry juice aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic quality with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is super tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Very nice framboise. So cool that it was brewwed in Indiana. 4.0"
""
"Overall a very good lambic but by no means the best from Upland or anywhere close to the best Raspberry fruited one. Upland seems to do a much better job with their lighter fruited lambics than the darker berried ones from my experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue. I'm beginning to like these Upland lambics more and more."
""
""
""
"D: This was one of the best framboise I've had. It was perfectly balanced between sweet and tart with delicious natural raspberry character. The body was just right for the style, and the finish was nice too, so it was great to sip. Fresh, this beer might be too fruity, but it was wonderful after a year, and could surely keep aging forever. Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with very high carbonation; nice feel. Overall, I enjoyed this quite a bit. Pretty good effort at brewing a lambic by Upland. I would definitely have again in the future."
""
"O: If you want a very puckering and tart, not overly sweet lambic that is undeniably raspberry in origin, then this is for you."
""
""
"Overall: Another wonderful Upland Fruit lambic."
""
"Delicious raspberry sour, though not as complex as the cherry variation or simply delicious as the persimmon."
""
"Good light body with nice carbonation. A little bit of a dry finish. Real enjoyable. So far all of the Upland lambocs I have had have been real enjoyable."
"This is tasty. It is a full on raspberry bomb."
""
"O: Great sour-fruit lambic. Upland knows what they are doing."
"O: Great beer. If you're a fan of sours, this one's for you."
"Overall nothing phenomenal (little nuance or development over time), yet a very satisfying sour. Would be happy to take another crack at this one in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"(D)- A solid example, though the carbonation level could be toned down a bit. Otherwise, a great sour fruit profile despite it being very straightforward. Could maybe use more oak and funk to balance the scales, but time could certainly help that."
""
""
"O: This was very good. I thought it would be a bit more fruity, but the overall taste is well above average. Easily enjoyable, very glad I tried it. 4.5"
"Bottle from the most recent release. Bright pink with a huge light pink head. SOUR POWER! The lactic acid is ridiculous in the nose. Biting and sharp with a underlying raspberry. The sourness in every sip stings the tongue. Swishing makes my eyes water. Super carbonated. Hate to sound like a broken record but Upland has nailed it again. I will be collecting these like a hoarding douche bag next time they come out."
""
""
""
"Tastes a bit more balanced out than the aroma had led me to anticipate, though still tastes more like fizzy raspberry juice than it does a lambic (though, thankfully, fizzy raspberry juice tastes pretty nice). The sourness was very big, but pleasant, and a handful of oak nodes serve to smooth things out."
"O: Really good beer. I've had better sours, but this one I wouldn't pass up."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an extremely tart, sour beer. The fruit addition is very welcome and well done. I'm glad I got to try it."

"750 ml bottle, bottled 3/7/11, Batch # 52-09. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy ruby red color with a couple inch light pink head that went away quickly. Not much lacing at all. The brew smells like sweet and tart raspberries, vinegar, funk, lemon peel and some oak. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but the sour flavors are much stronger compared to the sweet ones. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and has high carbonation (a bit too much carbonation for me). I think this is a good overall beer, it's pricey at $19.79 a bottle but I'd buy this again in the future. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""

"Overall: Very tasty. The sourness and fruit flavors are in good balance. Very drinkable."
""
"Thanks for sharing, Mario! Pours a ruby pink color with a large white-ish pink head. Scent is RASPBERRY bomb with slightly acidic aromas. Lots of sweet raspberry. Taste is initially a little strange...can't really describe it, but just a little off. Then each taste after gets better and better. Tons of delicious raspberry flavor with nice sour pucker. Not extremely sour, balanced out with sweetness. Maybe a bit of sugar added? Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and tart. Drinkability is high. Overall, this was a good experience for my first Upland beer. I will be seeking out others in the near future."

"O: Not my favorite lambic and I would say I was expecting more from Upland. I also have the kiwi and persimmon so hopefully those are better than this. Not terrible but not really one I would recommend either."
"Drink and overall: It's drinkable, but even splitting this bottle with Emily my mouth began to feel a big raw, and dry. It's a nice beer, and I'll have it again, but it's not in the league of the classic 3F and Cantillon lambics."
"If you like your sour beers full-on and unsubtle I would suggest this."
"O: everything was great until I put it in my mouth. Then it was downhill."
"After thoroughly enjoying Upland's Peach and Persimmon, I am pretty shocked at what just happened here. This is a fail for me, possibly the worst ""framboise"" style beer I've had."
"3.5 D: Another solid beer in the lambic lineup. This has a pretty good taste and is among the more sour from the series. Smell is strangely more subdued than the taste suggests and the carbonation of this bottle is distractingly high."
"O - Overall an enjoyable lambic. Glad I got to try this one. Its somewhat one dimensional, but still is tasty."
"o - overall smell is the highlight. Beer was surprizingly sour. Pretty good and definitely raspberries."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! Holy crap, this one was a GEYSER! The cork literally removed itself once the cage was off! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a pinkish red with a minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, sour, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really hate that half the bottle ejected itself into the sink as most people really seemed to enjoy this one the most of the lineup. I can see why as the combination of the raspberries with the sour/tart notes just simply worked together. While this was not the most complex beer of the lineup it definitely stoodout in enjoyment for most at the tasting out of the other Uplands."
"O - Good beer, easily drinkable. Not a world beater, and not the best of the ones that they produce, but this is good stuff and I enjoyed drinking it."
"Beer is thin and bright, heavily carbonated on the mouth, you get the fruit immediately and then you get the sourness with a very tart finish that hits you in the corners of your mouth. It's strong, very strong, almost overwhelming...but I powered on. It is very sour, very bitter and tart but it is a wonderful collection of flavors. I would definitely drink more of this."
"An enjoyable brew. I am very happy at the opportunity to sample a new sour / wild ale, and I would certainly have it again."
"D-this is extremely drinkable and very light in flavor. the flavor is a little light but it makes for a very easy to drink beer. the fruits are subtle and the most dominant flavor is the oak especially in the nose."
"3.5/4/3.5/3.5/4"
"Pours a hazed crimson pink color with a fizzy, thick bright pink head that quickly fades to thick ring of bubbles and splotchy film. Aroma is tart and fruity, with raspberry and lemon zest. There is some mild barnyard funk and acidity, but is mostly fruit forward. Flavor has a rich, sweet real raspberry fruitiness hiding behind the strong carbonation and pleasant sour acidity. Unfortunately the fruit isn't as strong as the nose or as imagine it was fresh. Body finishes dry and overall this is very refreshing, though mildly overcarbonated. Not complex, but not as one dimensional as I expected from other reviews. Nice."
"Gusher, pours a murky crimson with a small soapy head. Nose is oak, mineral, light horsey brett. Flavor is fairly light, a lot of mineral, red berries. I really enjoy how simple and fruit-forward this is, as there is little sourness and no acidity to kind of skew things. Very dry. it's refreshing in its simplicity, which I respect in the Upland lambics I've had, and made better through the lack of acidity."
"Overall I was a very big fan of this beer, as I was of the other sour I've had from Upland. Very well balanced and not much room for improvement - worth a shot."
"Bottle. 2009 vintage. Pours a slightly hazed orange amber color with zero head. The smell is rather a sharp raspberry tart nose with some slight barnyard types. Slightly sweet upfront with a nice tart raspberry sourness. Some apple notes as well. Slightly mouth puckering. Ends rather cleanly. Very drinkable. I'd like to see the raspberry flavors a little more prevalent."
"Served in a mini snifter. Pours a light pink color with a nice white head and moderate lacing after a few good swirls. The nose pulls through some really, really excellent and fresh raspberry notes along with some good levels of sourness as well as a bit of oak. The taste is strong raspberry with really nice levels of acidity. Good oak component. The sourness level is really great with the fruit flavor and this is one delicious brew--by far my favorite of their lambic series."
"Like the effort from Upland but just hitting the execution yet."
"D - Very drinkable and quite enjoyable. Wish they made more of this as I'd purchase it regularly for parties and as a light drinking alternative."
"D - Really liked this one. Not overly complex, but it really doesn't need to be. It's as-advertised, sour/tart notes and raspberries. Upland keeps getting better and better with every batch they release. Recommend."
"D - Decent, actually, fairly good, it could be much better though. The lack of a body is disheartening. It's still decent and the nice tart finish is very good."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and light with a bright carbonation. This one does go down pretty easily and is quite wonderful. Probably the best batch I've tried. Cheers to Upland for taking the time and effort to brew these lovely lambics. Well worth the effort to seek out."
"D: This is, hands down, my favorite sour of all time. Not immensely complex, tart, or overwhelming, but with great balance and clean simplicity. I could drink this one all day long and not get tired of it."
"Decent offering from Upland -- probably the second best sour I've had from them behind the blackberry. The raspberry really isn't all that evident, not that that's necessarily a bad thing. Probably a better beer than my rating may reflect, but nobody's going to be confusing this with something from Russian River or Cantillon."
"d - I really liked this lambic; it was one of the highlights at SAVOR to me. Loved the sour raspberry smell and taste and would love to try again."
"Overall, this is a great lambic. It is so sour for being so fresh. Very drinkable. All around a good beer. This is what I was hoping for from this beer!"
"Tart raspberry, seeds and all, very mild astringency with a good amount of dry oak barrel flavor. Soft feel of mild carbonation, at least there is some. Very tasty and drinkable, but it could probably use some more cellar time..."
"This is my second experience with Upland lambics, first being the last batch of Strawberry, which was atrocious. Compared to that bottle, this one blows it out of the stratosphere. I will be getting more when the wider release rolls around!"
"Like all of Upland's lambics; very nice!"
"D- This beer is drinkable now and will only get better with age. I would hold onto this beer a little longer if I had more of them. But a standout beer from Upland."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. not overly deep or complex, but with a great raspberry character."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, just enough to keep it going. Neat minerally and salty finish. Real nice lambic, thanks Russ!"
"A capped 750ml bottle brought and shared by me at a recent tasting. Uncapped and poured into my snifter glass. The lambic appears a clear brownish-red color with about a finger of off white head. The flavors and aromas consist of mild, mild funk, a touch of berry, some vinegary acidity, fruity, somewhat sour. A notch or three below medium bodied with decent carbonation. Kind of fell a bit flat on the palate. I hope the other flavors have fared better."
"For me, this was best of show for the meeting. Never thought I'd get to try one of the Upland lambics that I've heard about, didn't think they'd be as good as I've heard, guess I was wrong."
"me of rosso. Smells of sour fruits especially rAspberry. Mouthfeel is thick with sour raspberry, so smooth and sour I love the mouthfeel and finish. Glad I got fo have this one it's so sour and delicious. Uplands best so far the strawberry was great as well."
"Drinkability- If you're a fan of raspberries like I am than you'll probably really like this. It's lightly sour and somewhat tart and very quaffable. Maybe not the full Lambic experience but I'm not the style police and I enjoyed this. Thanks much Matt!!"
"D: OK but nothing special"
"did i get a bad bottle?"
"Thanks Sammy!"
"My bottle thanks to Jon. I do not know horizontally if better than strawberry but still decent drinker. Sour aroma. Aggressive carbonation, but mouthfeel a=overall still good. Sour in taste, some raspberry and other berries there including strawberry."
"D - I feel like I am being overcritical of this beer. I think I had overly high expectations for this one coming in. I find myself enjoying this beer, despite the flaws, and I am having no problem getting through the whole 750ml on my own. Alcohol presence is not detected at all, flavors are smooth and refreshing on a warm day. Easily drinkable, may be a good entry fruit lambic for those not used to the more sour flavors typical of the style."
"This is a very good lambic and probably the best I've tasted from Upland. The funk is started to show itself in the taste and I think this one might actually get even better with another year on it."
"Color wise this one sows the fruit tone in the body very well. A bit of an orange red tone makes up the body on this one. Head is a skim and even then just barely, but the bubbles do hang on to the walls of the glass. The sour raspberry feel does shine through on the nose. It includes a horse blanket funk that adds a nice complex smell. Sour feel is quite soft as you take first sip. The fruit profile is prickly and juicy all over the tongue with a nice raspberry feel. There is a powdery sweet feel that hangs on to the back of the tongue and mixes with the sour feel nicely. Considerably yeasty throughout. Mouthfeel is pillow like soft and very enjoyable. Super drinkability for the style."
"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09 thanks to notalush. Pours a cloudy light orange. Aroma of sweet raspberry, funk, and yeast. Very delicious aroma! Flavor is tart initially with sweet raspberries and yogurt, with a sour, acidic finish. Very nice."
"Upland makes some interesting lambics and they did a good job with the most recent raspberry release. It's slightly puckering, there's a touch of sweetness, and it's easily drinkable. This is worth drinking more of in the future."
"The finish is sweet, causing this experience to be less than euphoric, a fitting one for the last, as I will likely never feel her warmth again. The orange sky darkens to dusk, the pain of the realization that it must be over now, and I will never again see the light of day... Give up the ghost, let the salt water wash it away... the blood, wash it away... I've waited wasted years..."
"Somewhat disappointing."
"Overall I feel a bit let down by this one."
"Gabe interestingly noticed that the label said aged in strawberries rather than raspberries on the front of label, it was certainly raspberry though and was similar to the Lindemans Framboise, not one of Upland's better lambics, would not trade for again, still worth trying"
"D. Quite a pleasant surprise. It is very sour but has good complexity. The blend of the fruit tastes really work well. I'd definitely seek this one out again."
"While there was little to no head, very nice carbonation level. This is a lambic I'd use to introduce people to the style."
"750ml bottle orange-reddish color, I expected it to be pink. No head. Interesting smell, a little sour and a little funk. Flavor is perfume and fruit. This is quite fruity but no distinct raspberry flavor just a general berry taste. This is better than the blackberry but isn't really sour or tart, kinda disappointing."
"If you like sour raspberries in your beer, this is the brew for you. It's exactly what the style should taste like but it's some work to drink it."
"Drinkability: A very fine, very interesting lambic. Good work, Upland!"
"Drinkability is high. A very nice lambic. Tasty, not too complex, easy to consume, not overwhelming on the tartness. Just all around a winner and enjoyable to drink."
"Well this being my last one of these from this years release that I will get to try (send me a Kiwi please), I have to say that I am really starting to miss the funkiness and biting acidity of a real Lambic. These start to get a bit bland after a while, though they are certainly valiant attempts. In particular the super aromatic notes of the raspberry is just to powerful for this beer to remotely stand up to, so the nose is all raspberry. My particular, general apathy towards raspberry beers makes this one a bit less enjoyable than the other Upland Lambics, but it is certainly on the same level as the others."
"D: A good american lambic for sure, and a good beer, but I still prefer the oude belgians."
"Poured a murky pinkish color with a large white head which quickly dissipated, leaving a ring of pink bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aroma of brett, raspberries, leather, wood, and vanilla. Taste of sweeter raspberries, vanilla, some acidity, wild yeasts, some toffee, and a sour finish. Thanks to Clark for sharing this one!"
"Notes from and tasted on 10/25/08"
"Flavor is very, very complex and has a really succulent and delicious raspberry character. Other notes of leather, funk. Very nicely balanced beer. Mostly impressed with the quality of the fruit."
"Phantom sweetness doesn't interfere at all with drinkability, resulting in a nicely balanced wild yeast and fruit beer that sips quite well. My wife enjoyed this one, which is saying a lot. I found myself wanting a little more presence from the flavor, but it's very tasty as is."
"Drank this out of a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass. I personally like these better if you warm it up to room temp. The taste seems to jump out more so on the raspberry than the other lambics and was one of my favorites without a doubt. Right on the money with the fruit and just the right amount of lambic pucker. Fruit is present both from first taste to after taste. Worth seeking out . Without a doubt one of my Upland favs.!"
"Overall, this is a fantastic brew. Pick up some of the new batch if you can."
"I'm not much of a lambic-head, but I enjoyed the chance to try a home-grown, small batch offering."
