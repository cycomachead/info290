"Fantastic initial taste. not to strong, not too sweet. The after taste, tastes just like cherries."
""
"The flavor profile is World Class.  It is intense in cherry flavor, somewhat complex and perfectly balanced with both sweet, sour and tart elements.  It begins with a burst of sweet cherry over a rich malt background that is biscuit in nature.  In the middle, a rich tartness effervesces.  As the sweetness fades, a subtle sour undertone emerges.  The finish is a slow fade of tart black cherry over a subtle sweetness and just a hint of sourness."

"37.5cl bottle. 08 Sep 2016. I was trying to think of how I would describe the colour and the obvious answer is that it's cherry coloured. Tall, frothy pink head which lasted well and left some lovely Brussels lace. Powerful aroma of black and sour cherries. Reminds me of a cherry starburst. Medium sweetness and a pleasant tartness. Medium-full bodied, smooth, spritzy, sticky and a lip-smacking tart finish. Delicious. 9."

"Barely resembles a beer style but still wonderful in its own right.  Super tart & light bodied sweet lambic.  The aromas & flavors contribute to a higher rating than it probable should get."

"Sweet, distinct cherry smell and taste. Tart but not very sour, felt like Cherry juice."

"This is pretty much like drinking tart cherry juice. Not bad, but probably wouldn't go out of my way for this. Sugar, cherry and a touch of tartness."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/17/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy pink head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sweet/tart black cherry, cherry skin, candi sugar, straw, grass, light pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with balanced authentic cherries, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big sweet/tart black cherry, cherry skin, candi sugar, straw, grass, light pepper, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sweet/tart black cherry, cherry skin, candi sugar, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness and balance of authentic cherries, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly syrupy, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4%. Overall this is an excellent sweetened fruit Lambic style. All around great robustness and balance of authentic cherry, candi sugar sweetness, and light earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth and refreshing to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Think dark red pour. Looks kind of like a carbonated red wine. Aroma is all cherry. Lots of tart cherry flavor. Slightly musty aroma and taste. Very good."

"Poured into chilled pint glass. Pours a bright red blood color with a two finger whitish pink head that has exceptional lacing ten minutes after the pour. Smells rich of cherries and a hint of malt along with some lingering scents of earthy/vegetable scents. Tastes just as good as it smells, a rich cherry taste with a slight after taste of malt, sweet but yet just the right amount of tart bite to it. Mouthfeel is very light with a lot of carbonation which makes it have like a soda feel to it, like someone else mentioned perfect on a hot summer day, ecspecially here in maine. Overall it is one of the best lambics I've had to date!"

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, I don't have much experience at all with this style, but since it doesn't have that cough syrup taste that the first one had I would consider this a good one. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, slightly mouth puckering, not too acidic, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think half the bottle is the perfect amount for a after dinner dessert beer, but i think I would have no problem drinking a bottle to myself, it just might take me a little bit to finish it. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste, it was pretty good and it did a good job of really showcasing the cherrys and making them the star of the show. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad at all, but I think it would be a little better if it didn't have light cough syrup like aspect to it. I would buy this beer again and I would be interested to see how it ages. I would recommend it to people who love fruity and tart cherry beers. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer, I went into it thinking there's a good chance it could be a cough syrup bomb and the aroma didn't fully disprove that, but once I got to the taste I started to enjoy and appreciate this beer.So far this is now my Favorite Kriek and my favorite beer from Lindemans. Good job guys, this beer made for one nice dessert beer, keep up the good work."

"It's true: Lindemans Kriek is more fruit juice than lambic, and more sugar than fruit juice. The initial impression of cranberry cocktail turns out to actually be pretty spot on - mostly candy-like, syrupy sweetness and only a superficial, token amount of the fruit's true tartness. It's still an absolute pleasure to drink but, make no mistake, 'tis no true lambic."

"O: I like the Peche better, but this is decent. Krieks can be very tart, but Im not surprised, having tried the Peche, that this was only slightly tart. That said, tart isn't necessarily what I like in these kinds of ales."

"Overall: A solid offering from Lindeman's though the Frambroise remains my favorite so far. This would be great as an aperitif served in champagne glasses with a cherry cheesecake or chocolate-cherry tart. An approachable lambic for all, but not something that will blow you away."

"Poured into a #proper Lindemans color-print wine-style glass. Deep, dark, ruby red, cloudy, with a half-finger of pink head that retained well and left lots of lacing on the glass. Looked beautiful! Nose is pretty much pure cherry sweetness. Lots of cherry sweetness in the taste, but actually a surprising amount of tartness, especially up front, which I didn't expect, knowing Lindemans' m.o. Cherry candy, and not much else to speak of here. Crisp and syrupy mouthfeel, light-medium body, mildly dry in the finish, with the sweetness lingering to the aftertaste; moderate carb. This is a great dessert beer. Lambic purists will tell you that true krieks shouldn't be as sweet as this, and maybe they shouldn't. In that sense, this isn't very exemplary of the style, and we all know that Lindemans flavors their beers instead of using fruit in the brewing process. But that doesn't mean this can't be a good beer."

"Pours a murky burgundy with a finger and a half of pink head that retains well. The smell is all rich, sweet cherries, all day long, with a sour yeast aroma in the background. It tastes like cherry grape juice up front and quickly becomes a mouth-puckering sour bomb, ending with more cherry flavor and some yeast funk. The body is light and the carbonation is high, leading to a mouthfeel that is similar to champagne."
"This is my first experience with a Lambic. I found it more balanced and approachable than an American sour or wild ale. Maybe as I try more I will have a better feel for how the style is supposed to come across, but for a first experience, I found this quite tasty."

"Overall 4.25: Just a fabulous kriek lambic. The flavor of the fruit is forward and dominates, but there is so much more going on here than just cherry flavored beer. The levels of taste and the deep, sophisticated arrangement of them are executed almost flawlessly. This is the kriek to try if you've never had one before and it is an easy beer to find. Recommended."
"O- For ""ladies' beer"" as it was called in Brussels, this isn't half bad. In fact, this is one of my favorite splurges, and something I like to share. A great beer."

"Poured from a bottle into a flute, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby red coloring that is blood-like in its depths and bright ruby around the edges. Tall, frothy, bubbly, pink colored head that starts a tall couple of inches and settles unevenly into a sparse surface coating. Aromas of rich, sugary sweet cherry, both tart and darkly sweet. The nose is similar to cherry cough drops. Flavors are sugar and syrupy sweet cherry, almost like a maraschino, with a bitter tartness at the tail end of the palate. Smooth, thin body that gets frothy and effervescent at the end. Richly sweet cherry aftertaste, with a solid linger following a slick, clean finish."

"Overall this is sort of like drinking a jolly rancher soda. Big burst of taste, except that's pretty much all there is to this. Not terrible, but I wish it had a lot less sweet and a lot more sour"

"I might be biased because I love cherries, but this may be the best of the Lineman's lambics (well, the ones that are readily available on most stores' shelves). Nice tart and sweet qualities, easy to drink, and satisfying overall. Sort of a one-trick pony, but it's almost to be expected here. A good introduction to the style without getting to much into the funk side of things."

""
""
""

"D/O Drinkability is very high due in part to the relatively low ABV and the black cherry goodness that keeps you coming back for more. Overall this is a fine Kriek Lambic. 3.5"
""
""
""
"Thereâ€™s a sweetly cherry-like aroma. More candied maraschino than anything fresh. The flavor is just to the wrong side of cloyingâ€”think cough drops, cough syrup, and a smooth, sickly sweet artificial cherry flavor. Itâ€™s a fun one to share but not something Iâ€™d seek out to drink all for myself alone. (That said, Iâ€™d definitely mix itâ€”a plug of the kreik in a pint of chocolate stout works wonders.)"
"I really liked the overall presentation and flavors of this beer. It looked nice, the taste was somewhat one dimensional but I enjoyed it, and it was super refreshing and drinkable. My rating may be higher than I would have rated it in the future, but for now the rating stands. I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
"O â€“ This is a tasty fruit lambic. I know it doesnâ€™t have a terrific score here, but it is a great example of the style. Maybe it doesnâ€™t have all the complexity that some of the better lambics have, but I donâ€™t think that warrants a sub-4 score. Maybe people are expecting something a bit sourer. If you like cherries and tartness, you will like this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A good starting point for someone interested into Lambics, especially for someone who is unsure how they might feel about the funk typically associated with it. My wife enjoys this beer and it is a good one for an after dinner or dessert beer. Would go great with chocolate cake especially a German chocolate cake."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark red with rosy pink satin surface sheets. SMells like cherries, darker ones with a bit of wood and sugar. Taste is deeply cherry with plenty of sweetness and a hearty tone at the base - just simply carbonated, concentrated cherry juice here in my face. Light syrup with low to moderate carb and a wet finish. Very standard and tasty for the lineup. Lindeman's seems to me to be great beer, so long as you know what you're getting yourself into."
""
""
""

"This was good as a treat. Would pair well with strong cheese plate to balance the sweetness, but we tried it with dessert - sweetness overload! Great cherry aroma and flavor, nice sour hit on the back end. Cold is a must...not very pleasant as it warmed up. Very champagne-like, light mouthfeel, minimal aftertaste, maybe a tad bit sweet for my tastes. Wasn't what I expected - different and interesting style for sure. Liked, would drink again, but would not use with dessert."
""
""
"this is exactly what a kriek should be, this is the definition of the style really. pours cloudy and pink, champaigne looking carbonation, and a fizzing white head about half an inch tall. the nose is tart from the yeast and from the cherries, a little sweet but not at all overdone. flavor is really true to black cherry, fresh not dried. sweet, but made tart and puckery by the yeast. its still a little sugary in terms of feel, but in a dessert setting i think it is a positive attribute. the fruit juice and the yeast work together better in this beer than in almost any other out there in my experience. super intense carbonation and an alredy light body make this really exciting in the mouth. a great bottle to share after a thanksgiving feast or similar celebration, not something you would drink every day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was honestly disappointed. The appearance was fine. Smell, strong cherry. The taste was faintly like cherry cough syrup. Mouthfeel, light carbonation. Overall, anti-climatic. Starts out decently, but leaves the cheery cough syrup aftertaste on the palette."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is sweet, like soda, finishes sweet, it is actually sweeter than most sodas I drink, very cherry, mild tartness, mild everything. I enjoy it but it is overpowering. This is a good beer to have around for guests or parents when they come and visit."
""
""
""
"O: Good Kriek if you like it on the sweet side, gives you a strong red fruit, highly drinkable, pretty much a dessert in a bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fun dessert beer reminiscent in flavor and spirit of fruit striped gum."
""
""
""
"O: is this a beer? Ok, I know this is my first lambic, but, I'm not sure what else to say other than I wouldn't mind trying others of this style. I'll get this again when I have a malt drinker over to my house and they say they want a beer. I'll give them this just so I can see the look on their face."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I liked this one a lot, more so than the Framboise I had last week from them. Neither are sour, but both are great sweet fruit beers, with a little bit of a Belgian kick to them. I like cherry a little better and this reminded me of black cherry soda, so I'd choose this over the other, but both are great and worth trying."
""
""
""
"I have had this beer many times and finally decided to review it. It has the typical Lindemans sweetness and strong fruit flavors that I'm sure discourage hardcore fans of sour beers. Nevertheless, the beer is refreshing, pleasant to drink, and easy to find."
""
"Merci d'avoir faire cette biÃ¨re, Lindemans! C'est une bonne biÃ¨re. Vive la biÃ¨re belgique!"

"Overall a very nice beer. Certainly something different. Check it out if you get a chance."
""
""
""
"The beer is red in color, can't see through it. The head is pink and dense. The beer looks like strawberry juice. The aroma is sour, like vinegar but I get some cherry that complement the sourness. Regarding the taste, it is quite similar to the aroma however there is a presence of sugar in there too. The finish is very sour like sour candies. Cold it is good, as it warms up, it doesn't get better and the beer lose some punch. Maybe too sugary for me, but not bad. Overall I nice beer."

"Pours dark red with a small pink head. Nose shows cherry, cough syrup, faint funky notes and very soft malt. A mix of acidic and sweet flavours are present upon tasting, with cherry throughout and some funky notes later on. The sour finish is perfectly refreshing. Nice moderately high carbonation suits the beer well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is the first ""beer"" I've had where I felt like I wasn't drinking a beer. It reminds me of the cherry apple cider I drank as a kid around the holidays. This doesn't take away for how enjoyable it was. It is very drinkable and is very refreshing."

"Overall, this is simply delicious and easy to drink. Low ABV, excellent taste and smell. A great dessert beer, and one of my favourite Lindemans offerings."
""
"Light bodied and highly carbonated, this beer is most pleasing to the palate, although it isn't something I would drink a lot of, nor often. The carbonation is almost that of pop, but this in no way detracts from the drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps this is a guilty pleasure but I enjoy a beer like this from Lindemans from time to time. It's a nice change of pace while still giving you traditional lambic qualities with a sweetened edge to it. Not something I could drink in large amounts but this always seems to go over well with everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a nice looking red color with a thin pink colored head on top. The smell of the beer is of cherry which is a good thing. The smell has some light wild yeast aromas in there too giving a little bit of funk on the nose. The taste of the beer is of sweet and sour cherry. It seems to start sweet and end with the tart. The mouthfeel is similar to a carbonated wine. Overall it's not a terrible lambic in my opinion, however some think that Lindeman's is just too sweet all around. To each their own."
""
""
"Compared to the only other kriek I've tried (Cantillon Lou Pepe) this example is a bit plain; complexity is not in the same league at all. Still, this is a pleasure to drink and I could see how this would be very accessible to people who think they don't like beer. Sweetness is high but it doesn't come off as cloying nor as a fruity cooler pretending to be a beer. I couldn't drink a lot of it (due to sweetness) but one is great. This would definitely pair well with all kinds of desserts (especially anything chocolate). If there's any brett in here I'd love to try this aged with more showing; I'm not picking up on any and feel it could really use a little."
""
""
""
"O - one of the best lambics I've ever had. Simple cherry flavor transformed into a complex beer. The character and complexity used with one flavor aspect is wonderful. Just a delicious experience. Something I'll enjoy again. Good change of pace and soothing."
""
""
"Overall, this is an incredible lambic, such a good pick up. I am usually one that hates fruity beer but this completely changes that concept. The black cherry sweetness and the sour finish is a great combination. Thanks for the recommendation @bigplay1824"
""
""
""
"O: This is the best lambic i have had to date, the taste absolutely blew me away and the scent was tantilizing, absolutely incredible, gonna need to grab some more bottles of this to test it out with some aging, loved it!"
""
""

""

""
"I like this beer. All the beers I've tried from this brewery so far I've liked. Nice."
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark red with a 3 inch foamy red-white head that settles to an island of foam. Random clumps of foamy lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet and sour cherries and some slight funk. Taste is pretty much exactly the same with the funk coming through a bit stronger in the aftertaste. There is also a slightly acidic quality to this one. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. A bit of a sticky residue in the mouth after each sip. Overall, this is another good Lindemans take on the lambic even though it may not be the most authentic product out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty one dimensional, but it's an enjoyable sweet fruit brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very thick and leaves a huge thick film on the palate. Good carbonation levels. Overall, an interesting beer. A little too sweet for me, but it is honestly a nice beer that satisfies any sweet tooth cravings you may be having."
"O: Is this really considered a beer? This almost feels like a sparkling grape juice. This is no question that this can be a session beer, but I just can't think of an occasion to drink this for. I thought a beer and a salad was crazy, but after tasting this I could now imagine this food pairing."
"*note: weizenbob's review (a few before this one) is spot on. i recommend looking at his for a good feel of what you're getting into"
"Overall â€“ I've still only tried a handful of lambics, but this one was one of the better ones so far. I'm glad I only had a small bottle of it though, I don't think I could drink too much of it in one night. If I could chance one thing, I'd bump up the alcohol level a little bit.."
"tart and tangy cherry bite to it. The merest hint of acidity and pleasing aftertaste. No noticible alchohol too it."
"O - I dont drink many of this style, but for me this is a nice change-up. Easy drinker, plenty of flavor, and I can still function afterward"
"I give a Schlitz for Lindemans Kriek; two when Iâ€™m in the mood."
"Overall: A decent desert beer with tons of cherry sweetness. Not terribly complex or interesting, but not a bad beer."
"Compared to real beer it deserves less. But that was not my point of fixation."
"The first time I had this a year or two back, I thought it was nothing more than fruit juice. I'm glad I revisited this. It's much more complex than I remember. The sourness is well integrated and not in the least prominent. A good intro into the style."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"The regular bottles I'd rate more along the lines of 3/3/2.5/3/3. This one gets a little bit higher for being better. I hope every bottle I buy for her is like this one. I won't hold my breath."
"D: As I said, it's a bit disappointing for my first kriek having come to it through a gueuze - I was expecting more sourness and complexity in the flavour profile. That said, it's still delicious, refreshing, and worth trying with a chocolate dessert, or just by itself before the season turns."
"The sweetness would be a bit too much for me if I were planning on drinking a few, but the one I had wasn't bad."
"Overall: I like it. Itâ€™s much different than anything else Iâ€™ve ever had but itâ€™s good. It is definitely a good quality brew. Can't help but imagine this with a slice of chocolate cake."
"O - Only tried a few lambics before and was beginning to think they weren't for me. This was all sweet cherry and may have converted me. Not artificial sweet either. You can tell there's real cherry behind it. Would be perfect with dark choclate mud cake."
"overall - this is the first time I've had a fruit lambic, and it's definitely a unique style. a bit pricy, but tasty."
"Still, if you want a sweet kriek that most folks would enjoy, this is the one."
"Poured from a corked bottle (nice touch that). Poured a bright red with a decent pink head that fizzles away quickly to leave some lacing down the glass. Smells a little like cough syrup, but tastes like cherry sours (it's a candy that I'm particularly fond of). If you don't like cherries you're not going to like this beer. However if you like sweet and sour cherry flavors I would highly recommend this brew. It has a light mouthfeel, and is very drinkable though I couldn't see having more than one or two at any given time due to the sweet/sour flavor."
"I think there's an audience for this beer that will be very pleased with it. I'd just rather drink beer that tastes like beer."
"O - I'm glad I tried it, and I might even buy another. It was a very unique experience and my first with a Lambic. I'm intrigued enough to try out some more, simply because this experience was so unique."
"Pours an opaque blood red body, with a pretty pink head of a couple fingers. Leaves sheets of pink lace akin to cotton candy, some bubbles remain atop. Nose has black cherries, almost medicinal in quality. Some sweetness and mild funk that never really reveals itself fully. Taste holds both black and red cherries with again an extremely mild funk note, tart and sugary sweet. Big carbonation and residual sugary qualities remain on the palate. Light lingering tartness. Quite easy to put back, but doesn't stand out in any fashion per say. Fruity and sugary, and not a top option kriek. Gimmie something more sour!"
"Pours a bubbly dark red with a fluffy pink head. Nose is light fruits, cherries, candy, sugar, sweet. Taste is sweet, tart, slightly sour but not overwhealming. Cherry dominates the flavour. Lighter mouthfeel / body. Overall, its hard to believe this is a beer. Something what i expect a cooler to be like, tastes alright, nothing bad about it and not something I will find myself drinking often."
"It may not be for everyone but I think this is a beautiful product. Poured a gorgeous 2"" violet pink head. Smells like a cherry throat lozenge. Clear dark raspberry-like color held up to the light. Flavor is far less sweet than the smell and look might hint, in fact this is gobs of sour black cherry. It's an instant classic and one of only a handful of lambics I've liked so far."
"375ml bottle, poured into my Duvel Tulip. Pours a cherry red color, red foam fills the glass. Immediately when I popped the cork, cherry pie filling fills my nostrils. On a deeper smell inspection, I get an almost artificial cherry pie aroma. Taste- super super tart cherries. Nauseating. No funk, just pure tart. I feel like I'm eating cherry pie filling out of a can. Its overwhelming. This is going to be painful to finish...I am into Sours, Lambics, Gueze, Wilds, but either this is a crappy version of Kriek, or I don't like Kriek. Drinkability- brutal, unless you like Cherry pie filling out of a can."
"O - This one exceeded my expectations. The tart cherry flavours were great but as I continued to drink this one, the tartness and the sweetness each became a a little too much for me. Otherwise this would be an A."
"A moderate pour of this hazy pink cherry color brew yields a sticky 1 finger light pink head that is cute but disappears rather quickly. Aromaâ€™s all cherries, with both sweet and tart/sour components. The taste follows the noseâ€”all cherries all the time. Decent tartness in the finish but the sweetness dominates throughout. Light body with aggressive carbonation. It came across as more of a cherry flavored pop (or soda) with a bit of a kick, but I found it very enjoyable. A nice summer beer, but couldnâ€™t handle more than one of these due to the sweetness."
"leaves nice lacing. so good on a hot muggy day. hardly any booze but the flavor is great. i feel it in my cheeks."
"D: I'd say the drinkability is pretty high."
"O - Very good Lambic. Quite delicious summer brew with some nice sweet hints and some mild tartness. Good brew but Framboise is definitely still a better one for me."
"Blood red colour, light pink head, one finger with spots of lace. Smell is big with cherry, lightly funky, yeast comes through with sweet candy notes, fairly pleasant. Taste is all cherry followed by sweet candy, sugar, tart and lightly sour in the finish, some yeast is among the cherry. Fairly high carbonation, med body, syrupy and fairly decent feel. Not bad, a little too sweet so one is plenty but still quite enjoyable for a sweet lambic."
"Supremely drinkable and a lovely treat, even at $6 a pop I'd have this as or with desert quite often if it was available in my area."
"Pours a dark pink with a big light pink head, lacing left on glass. The smell is reminiscent of Robitussin or cherry cough drops with a yeast after-smell. Strong sweet cherry flavor with puckering tartness. Carbonation keeps it from all being too much."
"Pours a dark pink colour with huge light pink head. Smells of cherries, almost like black cherry soda. Flavour is quite sweet, almost a little bit tart as an aftertaste. Really big carbonation level. This drinks more like a cherry soda than anything, but it is still nice. I do like the cherry flavour."
"Overall, this beer is not really my style, but I can see how it could be loved by others. It really is what it says- black cherry. I bet there are many that would love it, but I am not one of them."
"Great intensity to its rosy pink colour. The appearance is hazy and turbid. The pour forms a thin pale pink head that recedes quickly and leaves little spots of lace. Powerful black cherry aroma, like black cherry soda but less artificial. The cherry aroma here has depth and comes across as very natural. Big cherry flavour on the palate with a fruit juice sweetness and mild tartness. On the balance, this fruit lambic is more sweet than sour. My guess is that the base beer was blended with the cherry juice mentioned in the ingredients list, and that the sweetness comes from the cherry juice itself. It's light-bodied, with the sugars giving it a slightly sticky mouthfeel. On the whole, this is a pretty simple fruit-bomb, but the fruit flavour is very rich and natural. Definately worth checking out if you like your fruit beers to really taste like fruit and little else."
"Ok overall. The sweetness changes enough to tolerate. Many others out there that are better, but this one is the easiest to find. A starter for newcomers to the style. Great with dark chocolate."
"*Paired with Strawberry Shortcake"
"Overall, this was just above average for me - certainly nothing to boast over."
"O- This beer has a syrupy cherry taste that is not fresh fruit at all but just all artificial. I haven't had Luden's cough drops since I was a kid but one sip of this beer and I fell like I was sick in bed. I couldn't find any other characters in this beer."
"Overall this is a decent dessert brew, I'd have to split a bottle with a few people though because of the sweetness, truthfully, I'd rather drink a cream stout for dessert. Hopefully the next cherry beer I find is more tart/sour."
"mediciney taste is not very good. would not buy again. might drink as part of a fruit punch bowl."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but maybe a little too sweet for my tastes. Still good though."
"Thats probably expensive for you yanks out there, but in the great white north, thats well worth the investment!"
"O: It's a no for me, i like my cherrie beers sour, i knew this was more on the sweet side, but it is really at the end of the spectre. Not my thing"
"D/O: Well, easily drinkable at only 4%. A good example of the fruit beer style, which is not surprising coming from Lindemans"
"Notes: Overall I enjoyed the sweet/tart mix of flavor as well as its pretty appearance."
"O: Sort of a guilty pleasure, but at the same time, it's a bit too sweet to drink a ton of."
"O: Not much sour/tart but has a decent taste that finishes slightly sweet without any off flavors. Not a complex beer but would one that would be refreshing on a hot day."
"Bubbly dark cherry pour with a lovely whitish/red head. Delicious sour cherry notes dominate the aroma and flavor. Mouth feel is bubbly and refreshing. The sour cherry flavor is unique and why you will either love it or hate it, I suppose. Don't expect a lot of sweetness here."
"Deep red with pinkish edges and foamy reddish white head that fades fast. Intoxicating aroma of cherry, sour notes, candy, bubblegum, and fruit acidity. Tastes of cherries, sour notes, bubblegum, tropical fruit juice, acidity, and a slight dryness towards the finish. The fruit and sour hit hard toward the center of the drink but disappears and doesn't cling to the tongue. Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. A refreshing beauty of a beer. Wild fermentation and cherries go perfectly together on a sunny day."
"Smooth and pleasant. Low alcohol and high carbonation makes this a very refreshing drink."
"Enjoy!"
"A solid lambic."
"Aroma is strong and malty with a firm, sweet overtone of black cherry. I love cherries! It pours a dark, slightly hazy mahogany with a definite black-cherry black/purple/red tinge; tan head is tinged in purplish red and doesn't stick around too long. Flavor is mainly sweet and fruity, mostly black cherry, with a sour undertone and a bit of malt. Lively, fizzy texture leaves a fairly persistent tingle and a fruity sweet and subtly sour finish."
"(D)- Very easy to enjoy, but very much more like a fruit dessert beer than a lambic. Still tasty and did not last long in my glass, but when I want a good lambic, this simply does not fit the bill."
"This was used as a toast with my wife for our wedding anniversary tonight. She tends to like sweet wines so this is one of the few beers we can drink together. Overall a very good fruit lambic."
"D: Lambic traditionalists may scoff, but damn if this isn't a great dessert beer. Haters to the left."
"Poured a pale red with an average sized fizzy pink head and had good lacing. The aroma was strong of black cherries with a mild sweet malt and sweet yeast scent. It tasted robustly sweet of cherries and slightly acidic at first and finished mildly sweet with a nice black cherry flavor that stayed with you for a nice duration. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and dry in texture with a nice soft carbonation. Overall an excellent Lambic!!"
"D- this isnt one that i can drink that often. not offensive, but not really for me either. i can see the appeal of this to non beer drinkers."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the blending of the fruit with the malts. The brew presents a robust fruitiness that is, of course, entirely appropriate for the style, but it doesn't overwhelm the malty beerness of it, which can be easily done considering the strength of the desired flavor. Those flavors are allowed to poke through, and give us a tasty, well balance end product."
"decent, medium-light bodied with lively carbonation. very drinkable at first, but the sweetness wears you down after a while. i guess a decent (and definitely approachable) lambic - a good starter for those getting into the style."
"D. Not my favourite kriek by any means, mouthfeel was too carbonated for my liking."
"THIS IS WHAT WINE WISHES IT WAS."
"Guzzle away, fairly low ABV. I'd close this 750ml bottle down and go for another if i had one."
"D: Very high. This is my gateway kriek...I need more!"
"750 ml bottle. Pours red,semi-clear with a redish, long lasting head. Aroma is of sweet and sour cherry with hints of peaches. The body is medium and crisp. Taste is of sweet and sour cherries with some spices for a balance. A good drink for a dessert."
"Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is high. A new favorite for me from the Lindemans product offering."
"I think both ways of presenting a fruit-fermented beer are brilliant, and I really enjoy this experience and will look for another to represent the other end of the spectrum for next time. Cheers to all and Merry Christmas!!"
"D: Second lambic I've tried and I don't get it. Fruit juice is what I get out of it. It's not bad, but I don't think I get it."
"Drinkability: Unbelievable! Very sweet but could drink 4-5 without thinking twice. If anything, Lindemans made their Kriek taste nothing like a creek..."
"Life is too long not to have a Lindemans. The Kriek will bring me back for a re-purchase sometime in the future, even at $5.99 for a 12 ounce bottle."
"very high. Relatively low ABV and can be found pretty much anywhere. great taste and very refreshing. A great dessert beer or for a special occasion."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. The brew goes down way too easy."
"Light body. A bit of a sticky mouthfeel afterwards. Drinkability is good. Only the tartness precludes along session."
"Pretty much the same as all Lindemans (which is a good thing) and this one is probably my personal favorite. Cherry flavoring is very noticeable but not too sweet like those stupid Marciano cherries. Very nice carbonation that compliments the cherry flavoring well. Easy to drink with breakfast, warm days, parties, or with dessert."
"This lambic is more complex than I thought it would have been. While there is a strong black cherry flavor and an in-your-face sweetness, it is also bitter with faint hints of hops and other fruits."
"This isn't traditional lambic and I don't care. I'm rating this as a beer, and as a fruit beer, its outstanding. I think it stands toe to toe with Wisconsin Belgian Red. The beer that got me into craft, and I still enjoy it, even if its name is a bit misleading."
"pours like liquid ruby with a whitish pink head. It has a tart cherry cranberish taste to it that is quite refreshing after a long day of dealing with computer stress. It smells strongly of dark cherry. It has a smooth creamy taste too. This is definetly one good lambic if you like cherry alot which I do"
"Poured a vibrant raspberry red with a half finger of pink head and left lots of bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The nose was big on the tart cherries with funky barrel, cork, mustiness, and acidic notes. The taste was also huge on the sour cherries but also had the funky barrel notes, cork like character and slight acidic citrus accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, sour, and dry finish. It drank very good and had my novive beer buddies fienning for more."
"Overall, Im loving this beer right now. I have never really gotten into any lambics or sours at all, but this one has me wanting to explore more of this world afterall."
"12oz corked bottle into a Corsendonk tulip a crisp dark purple with a frothy pinkish purple head. Aroma is loads of black cherries, as expected. The is loads of super tart cherries, but still enjoyable. The beer is light and smooth, but the tartness is a bit of a chore. I certainly don't drink Lambics that often, but this is one I do enjoy."
"In my opinion this beer is much to sweet , just like Ã  cherry Candy"
"Bottle: Poured a deep reddish color beer with a huge pink color head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of cherry is dominant with light tart notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by sweet cherry notes with light tart notes also discernable and quite a lot of sugar. Body is about average with good carbonation. I know syrup is used in there and I know this is not brewed as per traditional ways but I can't help but fall in love with this guilty pleasure each time I drink this."
"Drinkability is good as well - I wish I could have snuck this into the local Boston Market and had it with my chicken. But then again, I could have brought the food home had I been thinking properly."
"This is a superb tasting beer, mainly because of how sweet it is. For that same reason, it is nice only on occasions. Plan it for occasions when champagne would be appropriate."
"Sure, I can drink it. It's just that I feel there are better beers even within the Lindemans line of sweetened lambics. Still overall decent for what it is."
"I'm still not sold on lambics as much more than a gimmick. but i may just for shitzengiggle buy a bottle of cantillon from my local total wine...16 bucks though."
"D-I like the lambic style, although this has been my least favorite of the Lindemans lambic ales. This is good, but I was hoping for a fuller expression of the sweet cherries in the taste. Wish it weren't so expensive."
"A lovely melange of sassy cherry fruit and sweet grain, and a more or less well-balanced dessert in a glass, with not as much overt sourness as many other Belgian Kriek offerings. I can surely understand the popularity of this particular line of lambics, and this, its king."
"This is my first real lambic. I don't think Sam Adams Cranberry counts. Does it? Anyway, very sweet and fruity. Obviously a strong cherry taste and smell. Very complex and easy to drink. I'm not sure I would drink this often, but it's good for a change of pace."
"D: Drinkability is good but a bit compromised by the sweetness"
"Great tartness for a dessert beer. A great example of an excellent lambic."
"I generally can't stand major fruit or other flavor additives in beer (beyond the traditional elements) but this is an exception. Nice brew, can be sipped on its own or (the heresy!), I've found this can be great when mixed with a nice neutral lager or pilsner. In any event, this stuff makes most ""fruit"" beers that aspire to the style seem like rubbish. Anyway, in order to properly enjoy this you need to acknowledge it for what it is, which is something like a dessert beer. Drink this at the proper time, like splitting it after a nice dinner, and you can appreciate what this is."
"Drinkability: Yes and no. Tastes great but it's too sweet a drink for me personally to want to have more than a single glass"
"D- This is a beer that is kinda far off from a real lambic. Its everywhere, cheap and tasty for beginners. I can enjoy it every once in a while."
"The beer pours a nice red color with a pink head. The aroma is extremely sweet cherry with no real sour or funk qualities. The flavor is very heavy on the cherry. Tastes a lot like cherry syrup. There is very little tartness although a tad bit of it is there. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This has nothing in common with other Belgian lambics but as far as fruit beers go, this is a good one."
"Drinkability: Overall, a great lambic. Not my favorite flavor but still a solid beer. Certainly worth a try."
"D: A very decent and enjoyable fruit lambic, but I'm sure it's considered a lightweight by big fans of the style."
"D-Really easy drinking. The tart and sour notes really balance off the sweet cherry notes. I really don't understand why a lot of people tend to hate on Lindemans but love New Glarus Belgian Red. The two are very similar to my palate."
"Call this dessert in a glass. Medium-full body, medium tight effervescence, slightly tangy. Great stuff, Maynard."
"Unfortunately, the artificial cough syrup analogy persists when discussing the flavor. There's no way around it: The flavor is severely unbalanced. That said, it's not a bad brew, but also probably not worth $10. I will not be getting it again, simply because there are so many other superior options."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink. I would probably have this again and pair it with a sweet dessert."
"Lots and lots of tart cherries, would almost be too tart but the sweetness balances it out well. Really not much else there, but the straight forward cherry fruitiness is quite nice. Medium bodied and a bit light on carbonation. Very drinkable and a nice change of pace from the norm."
"Notes: Fair lambic, a bit too lost in the fruit blend and surely not even remotely offering the complexity that the brewer promotes."
"D: A good dessert beer. Would go really well with a slice of cherry cheesecake. It's more of a novelty and off the norm, but for 6 dollars a 12 oz, I'd rather get something I really liked and could drink a few of. The sweet cloying nature of this one must dull my palate, not to mention could probably cause some serious hangovers."
"Pours a ruby red color with a pink head and fairly strong carbonation. Head retention is decent but not much lacing. Smell is very sweet and laced with the twinge of tart cherries. They cherries and sweetness dominate so much that not much else can be picked up on. The taste is much like the aroma. Sweet with plenty of tart cherry tang that really dominates the palate. Hardly any lactic sour or musty characteristics. It is pretty much all about sugary sweetness contrasting with the sour cherries. This is not a bad thing necessarily, but this is definitely not the most complex lambic out there. Mouthfeel is light to medium and seems a little less sticky than a lot of other offerings from this brewery. The sugar keeps this from being a session beer, but it is drinkable for the style. All in all this is a nice dessert beer and I enjoy it more than most of their other fruit lambic offerings."
"Drinkability: Overall, a good lambic. This is my least favorite that I've had from Lindeman's, but it's still worth a try."
"Notes: Sweet lambic, similar to an alcoholic, sour cherry Kool-Aid. Similar to other Lindemans', quite sweet with a bit of tartness."
"D - This is a bit sweet-tart, to the point of being slightly overwhelming, but it is exceptionally decadent and quite delicious. It is a great beer for blending as well. And better to be overwhelmed than underwhelmed."
"This was a very easy and enjoyable quaff. I was expecting more sour and less fruitiness, but I enjoyed this nonetheless. I can see myself enjoying this beer from time to time."
"Drinkability: Not what I was really in the mood for. It was just too sweet of a beer, and I didn't really think it was a true lambic. Absolutely no funk and over the top sweet. This is candy, not beer."
"Pours a clear red (the ver definition of the word red) with a small pinkish-white head that leaves a bit of lacing as it settles to a thickness of a third-of-a-finger. The smell is of dry, fresh cherries, with a sparkling background (I've no other way to say that...). The taste is mostly the same, but the cherries are now moist, fuller, more pronounced, with a slight hint of yeasty earthiness near the base. It doesn't sit very heavily on the tongue, and the carbonation is light and unintrusive, making for a highly drinkable and highly tasty brew."
"The appearance is bright reddish purple with a thin lighter colored head. The smell is off putting, not because of the cherry but the quality. It's an obviously artificially contrived scent reminiscent of ludens cough drops. The taste follows, sticky sweet cherry soda mixed with aspartame. The aftertaste of this sweetner lingers. Surprisingly and perhaps disappointingly there is not much sourness here. I'll be fair and keep appearance and drinkability at the average mark. Kool Aid and cheap wine coolers are big sellers. This is easy to drink with no big boozy taste. I just don't know why anyone would opt for this? To me craft beer is all about the best ingredients, not artificial crap!"
"All things considered, it's not a bad drop to drink, and I find it quite a cleansing beer. It comes across as a well balanced lambic. It's very candy-like, and that makes it really unique. Not something I'd drink every day, but it's something I'd happily take on occasion."
"(Bottle into tulip) Like most of these fruit lambics, you really have to be in the mood to have one, and I was ready!! Pours a nice red/ruby color withe a half finger pink head that hung on longer that normal and left strong lacing on the glass. Aroma obviously strong with cherry, but I also detected another sweetness in there.. honey maybe(?) as well as some citrus. The cherries actually reminded me a little of the Luden's cherry cough drops I had as a kid which is not necessarily a bad thing! The taste was very sweet from the cherries, but they were not overpowerling. A slight bite at the finish reminded you you weren't drinking juice! Another strong offering from Lindemans."
"Pours a strong purplish red color body, with an average sized dark pink head, lasting. Strong sour aroma and sweet black cherries. Reminds me of cherry ice cream. Some mustiness too. Nice tart taste, sweet cherries. Not as sweet as it is tart and sour. Very tasty, great after dinner drink, especially when I was craving something sweet. Strong fruit flavor from the whole fruit. Mouth puckering. Not super complex, but good for what it is."
"Atmosphere is nice. Really solid appearance, and a sweet pleasing fruity nose. Flavor is sour cherry and a little grain, very nice for a special occasion, but not something you'd want to drink too much of... could be a little cloying. Overall, this is a really good brew."
"Pours a bright and glowing ruby red color with a thick and lacy red head. Sweet cherry aromas fill the nose and the highly carbonated brew bubbles out a seemingly endless supply of the smell. The flavor is sweet and very, very cherry. There is also a tart bite within the mix of sweetness and fades into an even more tart flavor in the finish. The finish comes and goes quickly as the light body and very high carbonation flow away."
"Notes: Another nice fruit lambic offering from Lindemans. Not nearly as sweet as Lindeman's peche, and not as wine-like or lambic-like as their cassis. It's not a lot like a traditional lambic, and it doesn't taste much like beer. But it's a delicious fruit-flavored beverage, nonetheless. I will undoubtedly drink this again as a special treat!"
"CHEERS!!"
"So, I like it and recommend it as an example of good classic kriek"
"335 ml bottle. A very pretty purplish red. Impressive head, retention and lacing. Smell like cherries sweet and tart, light lambic sourness. Taste is pretty sweet with a tart and vinous component balancing it. Dry finish gives a very nice puckering to the feel which is quite refreshing. Still there is a light syrup texture though the carbonation does a nice job breaking it up. Pretty easy drinking just a touch thick for quaffing. Would be easy to have several with a meal."
"D: This is absolutely excellent. Though I didn't enjoy Kriek the first time I had it in Belgium, I think it's an acquired taste and gets better every time."
"Overall I'm aware this isn't a true lambic, but I think it works on it's own level. I'll probably keep a bottle around for when the mood strikes. It's definitely a nice change of pace."
"Drinkability: There's not a technical fault with this beer, but perhaps a philosophical one. The sweetness in this beer is overwhelming, but seemingly quite intentional. My preference is for lambics to have at least some hint of beer in the background, but Lindeman's approach does not agree with mine. It's highly drinkable, yes, but is it a good example of a lambic? I'm not so sure. I'll split the difference and give it a ""B"."
"Admittedly, this is only the second Lambic I've ever tried (the first being Sam Adams cranberry). Still, I wasn't expecting exactly what I got. The appearance, nose, and taste of this reminded me of an energy drink, except without the disgusting chemical taste. There was almost no smell or taste of alcohol, only fizzy fruitiness. Went down very smooth. Overall, I think the fruit taste was maybe a little overpowering. Very good, but not what I'd drink if I were in the mood for beer."
"Mouthfeel/drink: Light bodied with high carbonation. Smooth to drink."
"Bottle poured into wine glass. Deep clear candy-apple red with a light-pink head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is black cherry yogurt, mostly sweet and no trace of sourness. Flavor is sweet ripe cherries up front which fade into a tart finish that digs at the corners of the jaw. Again, no sourness, but a very strong tartness that provides a mild semblance of balance. Still overly sugary and not all that easy to drink. Mouthfeel is similar to wine cooler."
"D- Great to sip on with a low ABV lets this drink go a long way. Even makes great Popsicles."
"Drinkability= If it was a little more tart and less sweet I'd drink it all day long. As it is, it's good. Sipper though."
"Out of a 750ml corked and capped bottle. Pours a dark red/purple color with a nice tight whipped pink head that left plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and tart. Big Hi-C fruit punch aroma with a tart unrippened cherry, some peppery spice as well. The taste is of fruit punch and red grape juice with an overlying cherry syrup sweetness. Some metallic notes as well. Similar to the framboise but the cherries don't bring in too much of a tart flavor like the raspberries do. The feel is moderate with soft carbonation, very sweet but the tart bite offsets the sweetness to avoid being cloying. Very tasty brew, very sweet, one glass is enough for me."
"I believe this is the first lambic I've reviewed or at least the only one I can remember right now. Definitely a new twist on beer for me."
"D - Good beer to tantalize your palate, to work up an appetite, a good choice with hors d'oeuvres, and certainly recommended for the ladies. The wife loved it."
"Thanks to the sweetness and low alcohol content, this brew is quite drinkable. It may not be for the purist beer drinker, but for people like me who appreciate the less bitter varieties, it's a nice, refreshing thirst quencher."
"Drinkability? Sure, like cherry soda."
"D - This is a really good ale. However, I don't see myself drinking this thing the whole night."
"I actually used the rest of this to blend with a stout that I thought was a bit bland and the two went well together."
"I tasted (1/3 pint) a couple of better krieks at the GBBF, but sadly, I've forgotten their names."
"Had this on a recent trip to Belgium- I found this to be an interesting beer. Quite striking in color (red with pink foam) with a smell of sweet cherries (non-beer like). Its rather velvety in the mouthful and was refreshing on that hot day. My wife (non-beer drinker) really enjoyed this beer; while I found it to be a bit too sweet to have more than one or two bottles. While this beer would not be my favorite beer while visiting Belgium, it could easily become a summer favorite in rotation with Blue Moon or Hoegaarden."
"Drinkability: Well, it's too sweet to drink too much of, that's for sure, but I'll definitely keep this, the Peche, and the Framboise around for the girlfriend when she comes over. I really hope to break her in to guezes or sours someday, but please don't let her know, it'd ruin the fun. This is completely out-of-left-field and very un-beer like, but in a kind of refreshing way. Worth a shot."
"drinkability - I am not a lambic fan but i think i can say if you are not either then give this a try. It is not too sweet. It reminds me of a sparkling wine or drink to me."
"D: Quite enjoyable. This is one of the better lambics I've had and might make me partial to the kriek flavor."
"D: could probably drink a few, especially with a dessert. would recommend it to a friend"
"D- This is almost a dessert drink to me. It goes down easy. Always an easy choice for wife."
"D- I don't want to be too unfair because I am not a fan of lambics but have a real hard time even considering this a beer. reminds me of a Zima with a life savor that my girlfriend use to try to get me to drink in college"
"My nut-shell review: If a jolly rancher were re-incarnated as a beer then you would have Lindemans Kriek."
"As I said, I'm a lambic novice, but this has me wanting to try a lot more of them."
"Overall, a very good lambic."
"D - Sadly, this style beer isn't for everyone and is much more of a party beer meant to be shared by a handful of people with, possibly, a strawberry cheesecake. That would be good. Delightful though."
" ~ This beer is certainly something I'd recommend to friends, and one I hope I'm able to have again, sometime soon if I'm lucky."
"Mouthfeel: Bright, sparkling (yet smooth!) carbonation. VERY refreshing. I definitely recommend this one to someone who's not very familiar with (and possibly intimidated by?) lambics. Very good stuff."
"This is drinkable, but it makes me wonder with the sweetness & carbonation whether it should even be considered beer. I don't know, maybe lambics just aren't my style."
"Would I buy another one? Yes, but I won't put it in the fridge next to a Double Bastard or a Gulden Draak. They'd probably kick it out the door."
"Pours a reddish, almost purple body with a slowly dieing two-finger pink head that left sticky lace on my tulip glass. An intense sweet and sour cherry taste with hints of other fruits but not much else. Taste is more of the same, although I didn't find the beer to nearly as tart as I thought. I found this beer to be extremely easy-drinking and it passed the ol' lady taste (she only drinks sweet lambics and nothing else, so if she likes it then it is sweet) and very little tart/sourness. Taste is almost entirely cherry with a hint of straw or razzberry. Take this review with a grain of salt because I love cherry flavored drinks (i.e. Diet Cherry Dr. Pepper), so I found this to be a great drink. If you don't like cherries or fruit tasting brews that are sweet, you might want to pass."
"After pouring into my tulip glass, the beer appears a cloudy, ruby crimson color with sparse sediment and an inch of pillowy pink foam. Nose and flavor are dominated by notes of fruity cherries, mixed berries, sour cherry jam, tart, slightly sour and sweet, all in the same mouthful. About medium bodied and certainly more than adequately carbonated. Worth a try."
"D - If sipped slowly or consumed in small doses it is very easy to drink. I can't imagine drinking a lot of it in a short amount of time."
"Pours a deep cheery red under a huge pink sponge cake head with great lacing. Smells like wild cherry life savers (which are awesome) yet slightly sour like a hamper or a linen closet. Taste is tart wild cherry, like cough syrup. Almost smooth, light carbonation. Maybe too sweet. I would do this again."
"Very nice, but very sweet. Light bodied, full flavored and highly carbonated."
"This is personally my favorite of the Lambics."
"If this style of beer is your thing, its really tasty and highly drinkable. For many I suspect this is an interesting taste, but not something they'd keep coming back to."
"This black cherry lambic pours a slightly hazy pinkish-red color into my glass with a thin white head. The aroma is sweet, obvious cherries and very inviting. The flavor is a great balance between sweetness from the malt and tartness from the cherries/fermentation. The lively carbonation maintains a nice aroma and flavor throughout the experience. Overall this was a well brewed lambic, couldn't drink it all night, but very good."
"Great beer for a party. Serve with chocolate!"
"Pours a deep reddish/pink with a thin pink head. Smells strongly of cherries and oxidized malt. Taste is also dominated with black cherries. A very sweet beer, but there is a good amount of tartness to balance. A hint of funk from the yeast. The finish is a hint of malt, showing that this is indeed a beer. There is also a touch of bitterness, but very small. Mouthfeel is nice, high carbonation. Drinkability up front is nice, a sweet treat, that tastes more like a cherry drink than beer. However, after drinking an entire bottle, it gets to be a bit cloying. That said, I would definitely drink this again."
"Pours a rich dark red with a three finger pink head and copious lacings. Aroma is very potent black cherry. Taste is like the most delicious black cherry soda you can imagine. The flavor is very full and sweet and it is hard to believe this has any alcohol at all. Easy drinker with no faults but doesn't taste much like beer at all. Excellent desert choice IMO and not one to swill. Sip it with a meal and enjoy those immense flavors."
"D - Quite filling... A wonderful night cap or desert beer... A great way to get introduced to Lambics..."
"Drinkability is good as dessert. Can't drink too many of these."
"Pours a deep blood red that is opaque with a thicky foamy pick head that sticks around. Smells of cherries strongly with background hints of musk, leather, sweat? Tastes of intense sourness and sweetness simultaneously followed by something extremely strange, a slight hint of rotten fruit? Syrupy and highly carbonated at the same time. This extremely unique beer has a tartness that I love. It has just enough wildness as well, and these 2 elements are balanced by a sweet fruity cherry flavor."
"Overall, not a particularly complex or high-class lambic, but definitely a tasty and refreshing change of pace, as well as a good starting point for a lambic newbie."
"D- I could pound these back all day but they are filling. It is kind of like a cherry juice. Easy to throw back."
"Overall - Very good."
"D - Sweet drink, my favorite of the Lindemans"
"Pours a deep cranberry color, not much head to speak of, some foamy bubbles around the glass, lots of floaties in the beer. Heavy & rich cherry aroma. Tart cherry flavor, an earthy/musty flavor buried deep beneath the cherry. Lively carbonation, puckering tartness. This is tasty stuff."
"Pours a deep cherry red with a pink rosy head. Smells very sweet with a strong cherry presence. Based on the appearance and aroma of this beer I was not very optimistic, but once I tried it I was pleasntly surprised. The sourness of the lambic balanced out the sweetness of the cherries perfectly and vice versa."
"Not a bad Lambic."
"D- Very drinkable at least every time I've had it but it's always as night may not be a lunch beer."
"D - Very drinkable if not a little sweet. Whats not to like about a cherry/champagne/beer?"
"D- My wife, who doesn't like beer, calls this one a ""breakfast beer", meaning it's along the lines of a Mimosa- sweet and bubbly but not so strong that it knocks you out."
"5.0 D: It's like alcoholic cherry flavored juice, what's not to love."
"After removing the foil, bottle cap, and cork, the beer pours a beautiful cranberry red with a frothy two finger pink head. Smell is of fresh fruit juice, cherries and cranberry, slight alcohol. Very sweet taste, as is to be expected, sour aftertaste, but it is a pleasant effect. The mouthfeel isn't anything too special, the flavors do not linger very long on the palate. Far too sweet to have more than one, and even getting through one is a bit difficult for me. For a Kriek... its not bad."
"Overall - Very one dimensional, but a nice desert beer."
"D: If you like them fruity; drink away."
"I am only moderately impressed with these beers. They are basically a flavored malt beverage. They are quite tasty, but I have a really hard time spending 5 dollars a bottle on them."
"Low carbonation, surprisingly, with a light body. Very easy to drink, and a nice low midstrength alcohol level makes this a perfect session beer on a hot day... maybe over some ice... maybe if it was cheaper."
"The most important message with this beer is to drink it ice cold, when it is more sour, more carbonated and less sweet. Were it not for the oversweetness, this would score much higher. Not a bad beer, but its one big flaw really lets it down. Judging by some of the old reviews, I think this one has been dumbed down (i.e. sweetened up) for the masses."
"D- I would love to have this one again. My first Lambic (I think) and I'm eager to try the other Lindemans."
"On a side note, we got a little experimental and mixed it with some Old Rasputin. This was fantastic as the blend was a chocolatey-coffee cherry flavor."
"D- Sweet, nice and crisp. Very refreshing."
"Opinion: This is a classic beer, so how can you do it too bad? This example has a bit too light of carbonation, probably because of its age. I thought that the age would help mellow out the in your face cherry that this beer has, but it didn't really. I guess this beer is just better fresh, and that in your face flavor is what it does best. Love it or leave it. I prefer some of the other kriek beers better...like Cantillon or even Liefmans. Anyway, this is a staple beer and one that should be tried...especially by the ladies."
"D - Not too bad. The cherry can be quite strong at first but after a few sips you get used to it. Not something to drink on a regular basis but once in a while would be OK."
"Excellent dessert beer. If you've been holding off on this (these) bottle(s), take the plunge, spend a couple extra bucks and taste the goodness."
"This ""Kriek"" stands on its own because it is unique in its intense fruitiness. I happen to love the cherries but there was simply too much sugary sweetness present to make me want to buy another."
"I have no complaints with this kriek lambic, it is what it is, and is done well, although not outstanding or exceptional. Great as a dessert beer or a shared nightcap."
"This one pours a dark red with a frothy pink head. The smell is of tart cherries with some sweet notes. The taste is exactly the same, sweet cherry, yet not artificial. The lambic is smooth, cannot really tell that it has any alcohol content. This one is an easy drinker, very tasty, but I doubt I could have more than one or two due to the sweetness. Worth checking out. Enjoy."
"Deep red with pink fizzy head. Has a cola look to it. Smeel of. . .cherries, but not an artificial flavor. Slightly sour/tart upfront but smoothes back to a very rich cheery flavor-nice but it is very sweet. Very straightforward flavor-not super complex. This sweetness takes away from the drinkability after drinking a little bit. Very nice easy drinking beer"
"Poured into a glass. Red color with slight head. Smells like cherries. Tastes pretty good. A bit expensive, but an indulgence that's ok once in a while. The fruit flavor seems very natural, I don't think it's a syrup. Smells like a wine. give it a shot"
"($5.99, 375ml, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"D = All in all an easy drinking pleasant beer. Good drinkability but the smell does need to be overcome which causes it to be marked down just a little bit."
"Shared a bit of this with my girlfriend last night. Poured a nice dark red color with huge lace and amazing lacing down the glass. Smell is sweet and full of cherries. Taste is much the same. Sweet malt background and huge black cherry tartness up front. Goes down incredibly smooth and is very easy to drink, however I would probably only have one of these at a time since it's not really my style. Very good!"
"This lambic was tastier than it smelled, I did not expect much but the flavor was actually pretty good, a lot more syrupy and sweeter than other krieks I have had which were dominated by vinegary tart, might drink again though, worth trying"
"Very tasty I must say, only I wish it wasn't so sweet."
"D: 1 bottle only--if that. It's incredibly sweet and sour, and something that must be slowly enjoyed."
"D - Very nice. Fruit centered, with everything else playing supporting roles. Not overly complex but some decent balance between the cherries and balancing earthiness and bitterness."
"The taste, the real strength, is far better. The start is mostly sweet cherry but this soon becomes more tart and dry , developing into a nice tart-sweet character with hints of sour yeastiness underneath, while being tingly, lively, and light. It's quite good but could use more yeastiness."
"drinkability- a very light refreshing drink that I would suggest be complimented by a dessert. certainly nothing that should stand alone, however it should be used in supporting role with some type of food. i will certainly try this and other varites again and try to pair it with a corresponding menu item."
"I tart cherry taste with a sweet finish. I would highly suggest warming this drink up before serving. Not too hot, you dont want to burn the alcohol off, i warmed the bottle in the microwave for a minute or 2. You could also stick it in a large bowl of hot water to warm it up. But who wants to wait for water to heat up? not me. Try it, you'll love it. The only problem with this beer other than how sweet it is, seems to be that you can suck them down faster than you can open or afford more."
"The drinkability is good and the right food pairing with this brew would make it very enjoyable."
"Not avery sessional beer, something to be enjoyed slowly with creme brulee or cheese cake."
"Didn't care for this very much... Only made it halfway through the bottle before I had to give it up.."
"Drinkability - good dessert beer, a fat piece of chocolate cake would have completed it"
" This stuff is classic desert beer."
"A tremendous brew. A desert beer, and not something I would have every day. Tasty, of course. Different, definitely. Not what I would think of as a beer. But a must try for any beer lover."
"D- drink on drink on"
"But, for many, these sweet lambics are a favorite."
"This is a very drinkable beer, I'd call it beer candy. It is a fabulous beer, and a terrific rendition of the Lmabic style"
"I've had the New Glarus Belgian Red, which is also sickeningly sweet, but it is also mouth puckeringly sour, so it sorta balances out."
"750ml capped and corked green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a somewhat hazy ruby-red/burgundy with a good inch of pink head that leaves fairly impressive lacing on the side of the glass as it slowly dissipates. Smells strongly of cherries with hints of a funkiness which is no doubt due to the spontaneous fermentation. Tastes strongly of cherries too with a sweet-and-sour quality from the funky twang. Hints of malt toward the finish. Slightly on the dry side. Plenty of carbonation helps make this a pretty refreshing beer despite its flavor complexity and fairly full mouthfeel. A solid beer for sure and my favorite lambic I've had thus far. Really hitting the spot tonight."
"This one's hard to review, because it succeeds in everything it aspires to, just doesn't really do it in a complex, beery sort of way. It pours a light red-maroon color with a thin bit of head on top. Looks solid. Nose is all cherries, as is the taste. My sister observed it basically tastes like cherry soda with a little alcohol. Feel is fairly thin, but not terrible for the style. Drinkability is based on if you like that cherry flavor or not. Personally I'm a fan of fruit juices of all kinds, so I could drink a fair bit of this (I just wouldn't think of it as beer)."
"It felt nice, with some smooth fizzyness, but I really couldn't drink much of this."
"Cherry color with a pink head. Good lacing down the glass. Smell is of ripe black cherries and not much else. The flavor get a little more complex as a hint of tartness rises through the finish. Like other Lindeman's brews, not super complex, but a good drinker. Light body with crisp carbonation that lack any acidity."
"Drinkability: I'd call this lambic a purely dessert beer. It's very, very flavorful and absolutely delicious if you like cherries. If cherries aren't your thing, keep moving."
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers I would pick up on occasion to change things ups a bit."
"d: Very easy drinking, I think you could convince a novice this was non-alcoholic. If anything limits drinkability, its the sweetness. Great beer for people who ""hate"" beer. I've gotten my family into the habit of drinking Lindemans at the holidays, makes it much more bearable."
"This beer pours a deep ruby color, opaque in the glass. It had a light pinkish head. There is a strong cherry smell, almost like a juice. There is a distinct sweet cherry taste that is pleasing and well-balanced with a sour tartness. Because of its initial sweetness, this beer is smooth and easy to drink. It can go down quickly without realizing it if you don't remember to sip and enjoy it! I really like that this beer can be enjoyed any time of the day and makes a particularly nice ""breakfast"" brew."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of medium, with a strawberry colored head Â– nose is not too impressive no much going on, some cork, and soft cherries Â– taste of pleasant sourness, tart cherries, and sweet strawberry- body is mild, and with medium carbonation Â– aftertaste of dark cherries, and a sugary sweetness"
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark red with a fluffy pink/white head that dissappears to lace on the glass. Smell is cherries in spades. Taste is also cheeries, some real and also some syrupy cherry flavoring. Mouthfeel is medium thick with a sour cherry taste in the end. Heavy carbonation and a bit acidic. I love cherries and I think this is a great beer."
"Syrupy feel to it. Seems more like a cherry drink with some beer in it. A different beer, but half a bottle is all I can take"
"This one poured a very clear, deep ruby red with bright pink, fine bubbles. Good head retention with solid, sticky lacing. The aroma was quite strong of sweet cherries, crossing the border into cough syrup territory. Same in the flavour, but a little tartness and faint bitterness helped cut this character. The texture was alright, palate coating without being cloying, and the carbonation was quite mild. A fair offering, but nowhere near their cassis."
"Still decent for the style. Worth the price I paid as well."
"This has also been one of the few beers that I've been able to get non-beer drinkers to try and like. Break them in with a lambic, move onto some other less sweet fruit beers and soon enough they'll be drinking all sorts of beer."
"After I unwrapped the foil and pulled out the cork, the beer poured into my sniffer sported a clear ruby red color with hints of purple. The head was light pink and there was heavy lacing. The aroma was heavy with sour cherry and hints of wet grains and alcohol. There was also a small presence of spices. The flavor was heavy with sweet cherry flavor and a tart undertone. Without the subtle graininess showing through, you would think this was a champagne of some type. It had good carbonation with a smooth, barley finish. There was very minimal hop presence. I paired this beer with Babybel cheese and it really accented the sourness of this beer. All together, this really was an amazing beer. Those belgains really know what they are doing."
"Drinkability : une biÃ¨re lambic moyenne"
"Finish is tangy sweet, cherry of course, and very appetizing for the next sip."
"D: This is a staple dessert beer at our home with its medium alcohol content and sweet goodness. Goes well with Chocolate."
"Okay, I should know better I have had other beer (if you could call it that) by Lindemans. It almost tastes like cough syrup that is chilled and carbonated. My mom usually does not drink beer, so on the advice of some friends I bought a bottle, she said it was way too sweet and I tend to agree with her. I some how keep trying to get her to drink beer when I see her, but she never goes for it, and this one did not seem to help."
"quite enjoyable, albeit certainly a luxury item out here. the medicinal notes also cut down the overall drinkability a bit"
"Uh-oh...is it the evening, me, or this beer? Ruby red with a dissapointing head...unmistakeable scent of cherry--almost cherry cola!....syrupy sweet...I'm thinking Sucrets?...fizzy palate--to the point of acidic throat attack....cherrys in taste, yes--robust, almost seething with cherries, but not in a Ms. Pacman kind of way...so strange to have such a drastic swing in experiences between the framboise and the kriek....perhaps in between both is the better review, but this kriek seems to be intruding my taste buds with a medicinal taste that doesn't leave me with a ""beer"" experience...perhaps a future re-reviewer..."
"Pours out a great deep red color, with a slight foamy head. It has a great cherry scent, as well as a great cherry flavoring. A bit sweet for me, as far as beer goes, but it is an excellent desert drink (or desert all by itself!). Goes down smoothly, if a little thick."
"This is my first lambic beer. I'm surprised it is so sweet and tart at the same time. It tastes nothing like any beer I have ever had, but I tried to judge it based on the experience which I really enjoyed. If you are on the fence about trying a lambic like I was, give it a try. Just be sure to pick out a fruit type flavor you enjoy because it dominates the flavor."
"D- chuggable. but too expensive. it's like an alcoholic cherry soda with the added complexity of wheat, barley, and yeast. the beautiful thing is that it's not made from all the bullshit cherry soda is. it's only 3 or 4 natural ingredients + water and i think that's freakin sweet."
"I never really thought that I'd enjoy lambics, but have come to find that they are indeed enjoyable. Poured a nice pink red with nice carbonation and fizzy short lived head. Little to no lacing left on the glass. Aroma is strongly of cherries and fruit. Tastes simliar. Alcohol is hardly detectable, and the fruity fizzy bevarge goes down smooth. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, and crisply carbonated. Overall this is an excellent brew. I especially enjoyed it when I mixed it with Stone Smoked Porter. The cherries and chocolate/coffee flavors blended absolutely flawlessly."
"The taste is so very black cherry though not as sweet as I thought it would be and that's just fine by me. The finish does end up slightly tart but that just makes me want to take another sip. It has a medium body and the carbonation is light...it's very drinkable. Very nice dessert beer. I really enjoy the Fruit beers from Lindeman's."
"this is an exceptional lambic. of course it's a strong tart cherry taste but it is fine. this is an example of a good fruit beer, ""fruit beer=bad"" isnt always true. miller chill, thats bad, this is not. this has a real, clear and present chery taste, but it isnt juicy jucy juice or arbor mist."
"Overall a very interesting lambic, but a wee bit too fruity, even for a kreik. A good introduction beer for this specific style. It would be good with pie and ice cream."
"D: Very soothing on a hot day similar to the satisfaction of a good lemonade but the cherry can only be taken for so long."
"D - A very sweet lambic, but good drinkablility. A pretty classic sweet style. made since 1811. I would prefer more acidity and dry flavor, but this still has an overall good taste and drinkability. Makes a good mix w/ Troeg's Oatmeal stout mixed 1/4 lambic to 3/4 stout I found. I would guess any stout would do, but I like the hop as a complement to the lambic's sweetness. I will have to try a mix w/ Sierra Nevada and the Framboise."
"Taste is full of (obviously) cherries, as well as notes of biscuity malts, sweet-tart candies, and a bitter unripened vine taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and viscous, with a great carbonation level and a superb unripened bitter finish. Quite good, but not as full-bodied or complex as Lindeman's Framboise."
"Black Cheery pie is what this is, delicious and intense Black Cheery pie with out the crust. Lambic Beer is on the label, Black Cheery pie is what is on the inside."
"Very sweet but mixes the sweet with the traditional sourness. One to have now and again but a little too sweet to be a regular beer in my fridge"
"D: I could throw this stuff down constantly. Nice and easy to drink and damn tasty. This is a great alternative to a standard lawnmower beer on a hot summer day. Really refreshing."
"I have to admit, the only thing that keeps me from drinking this all the time is the price. However, if I ever win the lottery, this becomes my chosen breakfast drink!"
"Pomegranite color with a low pink head. Aroma of marischino cherries and sweet tarts. Flavor is initially sweet, with understated cherry flavors. It's just a tad sweet, but the cherry flavor is not overdone, not overpowering. It loses some appeal as I get deeper into the glass and it starts to remind me of cough drops. Mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat tannic with a powdery feel."
"Overall, a nice cherry soda, but not what I would reach for when I want a beer. My wife, however, has fallen in love with the whole line of Lindemans."
"A very nice Lindemans offering, better than its peach variation given the higher tartness and acidity."
"Pours out a cloudy red Kool Aid color with a thin pink head that doesn't hold up too well. No lacing. Smells like cherry Pixie Stick poured into a mix of cherry cough syrup and cherry freezer pop. Way too sweet and artificial smelling with no real lambic characteristics. The cough medicine aspect is pretty well absent in the flavor, thankfully, but the Pixie Stick and Flav-R-Ice or whatever is still there in abundance. Really sweet and artificial tasting, but has a bit of a tart edge towards the middle that lasts to the finish: which then holds some hints at lambic funk, but it is drowned out by the sugar. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and syrupy and has a spritzy carbonation. This is really too sweet to enjoy fully, especially since I know in the back of my head that for the exact same price, one can have a really good traditional lambic that isn't cut with other stuff to make it more accessible and boring. Overall, this is like someone mixed some raspberry cordial in with my beer. Not bad altogether, but not what I would call a good lambic."
"Look, before I get a backlash, realize I don't consider this a beer. It's a malt beverage. Unlike 'malt beverages' of today this brew doesn't use high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, 'natural and artificial flavors', or add any extra carbonation. Beer is more on the salty side of the taste buds generally, and my dad would hate this stuff because it doesn't taste like beer. I respect and admire this brew and would drink it everyday if I could. This is the perfect example of a malt beverage and the good ingredients and exceptional brewing methods leave me with a tremendous respect for this brew who could have gone done the High-fructose Highway a long time ago. Cheers to the employees and brew masters at Brouwerij Lindemans!"
"D - Good. I will definitely drink the whole bottle, but it's a little too sweet for sessioning, although the crisp tartness makes it very drinkable for the sugar level."
"Drinkability: 750 mL is a bit much but I did enjoy it in its entirety. If you enjoy the sweet/sour flavor this is a very drinkable beer. I made a raspberry tart for dessert (I wanted sour cherries but they are not in season; unfortunately I didn't have a framboise in the fridge), and this beer complemented the dessert very well."
"A great alternative to champagne as well...I have drank this on New Year's Eve more than once."
"Overall, I thought this brew was alittle off. The strong vinegar scent and taste reminded me off drinking kambuca ( a fermented tea drink drank in South America and Japan)."
"Pours a relipstick with lots of bubbles and a pink head. Almost overflowed from my champagne flute. The aroma was cherry juice while in the distant countryside. Could smell some stale hops in this one. The taste was a fizzy cherry bomb with some slight herbal funk and a very mild, tart finish. Great sipping beer while watching a movie after dinner."
"A delightful beverage, but perhaps a bit too fruity and sweet. Feared drinking this ""sour"" beer, and found it not sour enough for my taste."
"From Tully's store in Wells. Pours a dark red/brown color that forms a head with nice lacing in the glass on top of the beer. Smell is hardly noticeable, a bit like cherries. Tastes definetly like black cherries, can barely tell it's beer but in a good way. Mouthfeel is lighly carbonated, lightly coats the inside of the mouth, but is nice going down. Overall a real nice beer, doesn't seem like so much a beer but a carbonated fruit drink; but not too sweet. (Thanks to my wife jessica, her first review!! :)"
"A 750 ml bottle costing $9.45 at the North Coast Coop in Eureka, CA. Poured a beautiful red color with a pink head that lasted a long time and left wonderful lacing. Big nose of cherry and a touch of yeast.. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, with remarkable smoothness. Flavor is of cherry of course, with a small bit of tartness underlying the sweetness that stays all the way to the finish. An outstanding example of its type. I am realing a lot of my ratings are up in the 4+ range these days, but I am running into a lot of really nice brews, especially those from Belgium."
"Kriek gives off aromas full of cherry fragrances. It pours like a soda and looks like one too. There is a lot of carbonation which creates a thin sticky looking head. It really looks like a colored champagne. This tastes like a soft drink as well. Very full of tart cherry flavor and not much else. This is refreshing and I'll have to try out some other Lambics so I can get a basis for comparison."
"D: Good beer but not something I could drink all the time, the 750ml bottle was plenty at one sitting."
"Translucent ruby color. Got a good head with a hard pour that retained decently. A think layer of head remains. Thin lacing on the glass. Smells like a fruit juice. Cherries and strawberries (?!) dominate. Faint yeasty smell. Too sweet but okay. The taste is still a bit on the sweet side, but not as much as the smell would indicate (which is a good thing!) The sourness from the wild yeast dominates, with the cherry flavor rounding out the taste. Heavy bodied, with carbonation that trickles all the way down. It is a bit too sweet to drink more than two but nice...though I prefer the Framboise more."
"gets much above 5%."
"This beer was quite fruity, but it reminded me too much of halls cough drops for me. I liked the creamy texture of it and the color was rich and dark. I'd have to take the raspberry over this one though. This beer is definitely not on my favourite lambic beer list."
"Aroma is strong cherry, very small head, which dissapears rapidly. Overall appearance is a very dark red in color, somewhat hazy. Flavor is a very tart cherry with just a slight ""bite"" of an aftertaste. Moderate carbonation and bubbly goes down somewhat smooth. This is not something i would drink all the time, this is something my wife likes, so i would drink this occaisionally."
"Good beer? to enjoy after dinner with a chocolate dessert, or to convert the wife from wine to beer. The only problem is that a case of this is $109.99 where I live. It is over $10.00/bottle. It's good but not that good."
"Not really that great. The kind of ""beer"" that you'd want to reccommend to that girlfriend who just has no interest in learning anything about beer but that would at least allow you to steer her away from Bartles & James."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I'd have to be in the mood for this again, and there are better lambics out there if I want overpowering sweetness."
"Drinkability: overall, good. if it were my only option, i could see myself easily having one or easily passing. i think i'm just not a fan of cherry."
"Drinkability: this is a very sippable beer to enjoy as a substitute for a glass of wine. I would not, however, be able to drink bottles of this without something to balance out the sweetness that accrued in my mouth after a while. That said, this was a pleasant surprise for a fruit beer and far less sweet than I expected and not at all offensive; I would definitely stock a few bottles of this at home and I anticipate that I will want to try it again soon."
"I don't see how anyone couldn't give this a five in drinkability."
"Cheers."
"I recommend having this one with a loved one over candles on a romantic evening (in place of wine or champagne)."
"D - This is just about as drinkable as it gets (unless you don't like sweet stuff). It's more like having a sugary soda than a beer."
"Taste was slightly sour, with very strong cherries to the fore and a slightly malty undertone. Definitely a lambic flavor, you can tell it was wild yeast."
"A pure delight. To be enjoyed with breakfast, a special holiday, after dessert treat or just because it's so enjoyable."
"Pours a very deep red color with a pink head. Smell has none of the usuall lambic funk that I expected, instead it smells sugary sweet. Taste is way too sweet with none of the expected sourness at all. Very strong cherry tasting, almost as if a sugary cherry syrup had been used and not real cherries. Mouthfeel is lacking on carbination. Drinkable, but there are better lambics out there."
"If I didn't adore the taste of cherry I could have really ripped this beer up for the excessive sweetness. This is without question a dessert beer. I would suggest pouring this over vanilla ice cream as cherry syrup."
"355ml bottle, dang and with a cork..had a frenzied search all over the house ..but found a cork screw..phew! In appearance dark red , almost purple Lambic, light pink head..dense and bubbly. Very pleasant aroma of wild black cherry, slightly sherberty, Starts sweet cherry creme , then I get the tartness..ends very sour and very nice !! Lovelly on the palate..very smooth and not overcarbonated, even creamy at times. Very nice drink, I have not had much lambics but this was different and a treat."
"Drinkability - easy to drink, loved it. will have more (if i can afford it)"
"Poured into a champagne flute, a dark ruby color with a slight pink head forming. The strong scent of cherries dominates the aroma, but there are hints of malt and a grassy aromas present. The taste almost makes you wonder if this a beer. The cherries sweet and tangy taste dominates the palate, with hints of malt there to remind you that it is a beer. In the mouth, the carbonation is very strong, but a nice dry finish after every swallow. This a dessert beer, particularly something chocolate. This is a beer I get mixed drink friends to try, mostly women, they try and can not beleive it is a beer."
"High ratings here represent having ONE glass of this, as any more would be entirely too much, causing the experience to diminish in all areas. I made the mistake of refilling my flute, and instantly regretted it. My second glass was even more tart than the first (in this way, it requires chocolate or something to cut it), and it started leaving this odd film in my mouth. Second glass was not nearly as good as the first."
"Pours a deep red, with a thin to medium, pinkish head with a good deal of carbonation. Smelled like cherries - sweet and tart. Tasted like cherries - sweet and tart. Actually, almost had a cherry coke-like taste to it, but in a good way. Very pleasing to the palate - medium bodied. Easy to drink, but could imagine drinking the stuff could get old after a while. A good beer to pair with dessert, especially if it is chocolate. Enjoy."
"[Edit] It's almost a different style than Boon or Cantillon. Like a cross between a fruit lambic and a faro. I like Lindeman's lambics and always will, but they are definitely a different animal."
"An extremely nice beer. Probably my favorite of the Lindemans lambics."
"I see my tastes have changed since 2003 from my eailier review. Interesting..."
"overall, another great tasting fruit beer, i really enjoyed this one. it's not an everyday beer but sometimes something like this could really hit the spot."
"Lots of lace and reddish colour with lace and a good head. Cherry aroma though sugary sweet, and that is the taste. Its refreshing, but oh way too sweet. Sourness mid-sip would would like much more.A transition to this style beer. Sampled at Cole's Belgian beer fest."
"D - I like it. Very tasty and a cool change of pace."
"This cherry lambic pours a nice dark ruby red color, with a moderatley sized and short lasting head. As noted by other reveiwers, there is definitely a medicinal quality to the smell, reminescent of cherry cough syrup or drops. The taste diverges only slightly from the smell in being nicely sweet and fruity, but with a medicinal flavoring. A rather nice mouthfeel, although there is a minor medicinal adherence to the tongue. If you can get past the reminescence of cherry cough medicine, you won't be let down by this beverage."
"Paired well with chocolate."
"D - Very good dessert beer, and a great way to finish off a long evening of stouts and winter ales. This leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
"The extreme sweetness limits amount that can be consumed at a time but overall an enjoyable dessert beer and worth drinking again."
"D: Not too drinkable for my taste, but fans of lambics will enjoy it. My fiancee, who drinks lambics but no other type of beer, prefers Lindeman's Framboise to this."
"The mouthfeel is a little sticky sweet. The drinkability of this beer would be low for me as the sweetness would get old in a hurry. A decent beer to have one of for dessert or to compliment something sweet."
"Bright red color with a smallish fizzy pink head. Smell reminds me of New Glarus Belgian Red, which I didn't like. Cherry fruit gushers. Where's that Lambic quality. It's also missing in the taste. There's just a lot of juicy sweetness to it. It tastes like cherry juice. A bit syruppy. Finish is drier though which makes it somewhat drinkable. I guess I just don't care for cherry beers too much, but this seems to have almost no lambic qualities."
"Drinkability- Save this one for after dinner. Probably would really go good with some chocolate covered cherries. Overall, tasty, but not a gussler."
"Wow, a treat for the senses. Aromas hit the nose hard with dark black cherry fruitiness, sweetness, and tartness. Rich and complex even at the first whiff. Looks thick, rich, and maroon with a haze and good retention. Carbonation is a bit low, but suitable for the style. Tastes rich and sweet with a, probably, good dose of malt, but hiding behind the cherries. Nearly cloying. Tart and lightly sour across the toung and in the jaws--just enough to savor every sip and deter slamming it down. Thick, smooth texture with a mild astingency in the finish. Ends with a big sweetness and lingering tartness."
"This beer poured a light ruby color with very little head. it was very carbonated. Its aroma was like cherry juice. This was a very sweet beer, it tastes more like a sparkling wine than a normal beer, as well as a cherry flavor it also had hints of hibiscus tea and a slightly tart finish. Overall it was tasty and refreshing and generaly enjoyable."
"Drinkability - I could drink a few of these even though it's one of my less favorite styles."
"This is a wonderful aperitif that I'd love to serve with a vegetable-driven appetizer. I'm not sure that the flavors would allow much more than a pre-dinner cocktail for total quantity to be consumed, but overall this brew is exemplary."
"Drinkability: The only drawback is that could get to be too sweet. Otherwise, this a very interesting take on a lambic, one end of the extremes (lindemans=sweet, liefmans=sour)."
"Also of note: I reviewed this after reviewing the De Ranke Kriek earlier the same evening. I went back to the De Ranke after a glass of this."
"I was surprised to find this beer so sweet rather than sour. Sour/tart notes are there but overpowered by sweet fruit, namely cherries. overall a nice tasting brew but this could get old fast as the sweetness lingers and is syrupy."
"Drinkability: Awfully hard to drink a whole bottle of this sweet stuff; I'm not a fan of sour beers but the sweetness of this off-style lambic doesn't do it for me, either"
"Ever had a Ludens cherry cough drop? If you answered yes then you know exactly what this beer looks, smells, and tastes like. None of the tartness that I cherish in cherry beers is more then faintly present here. This one is pure sweet cherries and syrup. ItÂ’s very medicinal, not quite to the point where it would resemble cough syrup but close. I find this to be too sweet and artificial tasting for me. I also think that the head could be more impressive and the aromas bigger. Overall I think that this might do well as a desert beer for women with sweet teeth but otherwise itÂ’s pretty mediocre."
"This is drinkable but the price will likely keep me from trying Lindeman's other offerings. This is my first kriek so I wasn't sure what to expect. If you like sweet, liquor type beers you'll love this. Not really my cup of tea but you can definitely sense the craftsmanship and quality involved. Worth a shot if you've got the bucks."
"Pours red with a hint of orange with a slight haze. The head is a frosty white that leaves a slight lacing. Smells of cough drops and cherry life savers with a pungent yeasty sourness. Tastes like cherries and red grapes with a sharp sourness with some musky yeast. Mouth feel is light but a bit sticky with a slight, small bubble carbonation. The smell is the biggest turn off here, but itÂ’s not too bad over all."
"--Joey"
"The taste has an over the top sweetness to it that really just dominates this beer in both palate and flavor. There is a strong cherry note as well, and perhaps a bit of cherry skin complexity thrown in as well, but overall this does not even have the fruit character that the Lindemans Framboise has. Simplistic and straight forward, it is perhaps a bit easier to drink than the Framboise, but I do like cherries better than raspberries. There is also a bit of tartness in the finish here, but this wisp of a flavor is all that says that this might be something that is Lambic base."
"This brew pours a reddish brown with a large pink head. The aroma reminds me of cherry coke, but with more bit to it. The taste is strong. Damn strong. Cherries are everywhere, drowning out any other flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this brew bores me. I simply can't see myself drinking a beer with such a simple flavor."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers and love to endulge on special ocassions. Great lambic and overall teriffic beer."
"Mouthfeel is very juicy with an almost negligible amount of carbonation. Taste kind of reminds me of flavored soda. Not bad but considering the cost there are plenty of other tastier brews I could have bought."
"Dark red/purple color, with a very pink, very large head that fills the rest of the way to the top of a 16 oz. challice. Smell is sweet cherry, but not candy-like whatsoever. Taste is also cherry, tart and sweet, but much less than the other Lindeman's I have tried. Lots of cherry and a wheaty flavor, very clean and delicious, good, well carbonated body. Very good."
"Notes: My wife loves this flavor, so we've tried this several times. It's fun, but not my type of beer..."
"Only had a 355ml starter bottle, was nervous about not liking it Â– but will be getting a big bomber next time as the daughter and wife both enjoyed their little pulls off my glass."
"smooth and satisfactory. This is a nice introduction into the funky world of lambics. I enjoy this beer immensely"
"Appearance is a cloudy burgundy with a (huh?) pink head of foam that descends into nice lacing. Aroma has sweet, with sour cherries and sweet-tarts. Body is too light, carbonation, though is good. Initial flavor is composed of sweet bing cherries and that settle into tart bitterness. Might go well with Cherries Jubilee."
"The cherry sweetness is much enjoyed at the beginning, but becomes a little intense towards the end. Definately see this becoming a must have on some bigger cities club's menus. I think I will grab an straight up Lambic or Guezue next time I am at the store."
"Not a beer for anyone who doesn't enjoy cherries. This has cherry flavor, seven fold. Like cherries? Try some."
"Pours a very bright purplish-pink color with a finger and a half of pinkish head and good retention. Smell is big sweet cherry, kind of like cough drops without the menthol notes, very appetizing. Huge cherry taste, suprisingly hardly tart at all, very sweet and juicy taste. Tastes good by itself, taste wonderful paired with some chocolate cake. Very bubbly and champagne-like, this is almost like a cherry soda, and actually probably tastier even to non-beer drinkers. This is a fabulous beer for dessert or a special occasion---anyone who likes cherry will like this beer."
"Gorgeous, purple color. Somewhat pale in places but a nice, deep purple thoughout. Very nice head to begin with. Some nice lacing. Aroma screams black cherry. Some great peppery notes. Very full and inviting. Big fruit flavor upfront. Slight, malty backbone with a huge black cherry flavor. Peppery flavor from the sourness comes thru and is well balanced with the huge fruit presence. Very good mouthfeel-great body considering the ABV-Id expect it to be a much bigger beer. A killer beer-theres a great balance between the fruit and beer itself. Not overly sweet. This is what a wine cooler should be. Malt based beverage my ass...worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: Even though this is my first fruit lambic review this is not the first lambic I have had. I think that the framboise from lindemans is a little bit better, but this is still definitely good."
"SlÃ inte!"
"I really like this beer and while it is a little over sweet it doesn't kill the flavors of the bright cherries laced with the yeasty funkness of the lambic. The color is of marichino cherry juice and it has a pink head that settles to foam gobs on top of the beer. The taste is of dark tart cherries a taste easily recognized. It is not medicine like at all it is very smooth and very drinkable."
"Fresh, crisp, and tart. Cherrys - nothing medicine-esque at all in this lambic. I've had a few lambics from lesser breweries in the past that have tasted very unnatural, but this is real fruit all the way. Very refreshing."
"Comments - What a change this beer is from just about any other kind of beer. Really very sweet. I could like to see a lambic with more tartness, just so I have a better basis upon which to judge this style."
"Waf: a big, dense, bubblegum-pink head. Deep, deep, clear red beer. Sticky lacing. The nose is spicy and packed with cherries. Sugarsweet, with some lambic tartness. The front is tart but dominated by sweet cherries. The middle is thick and syrupy. Cinnamon and cherries. More sweet cherries in the finish with some tartness and spice. It's a nice enough beer. Too sweet for me, but not as bad as the Framboise. Quite spicy-cinnamony... like Red Hots (but not hot). There are some decent lambic flavors."
"It's not much like ""beer"" but it's a lot better than cherry soda. Should be great with desert - or for desert - or to share with a friend."
"Alcoholic cranberry juice. And I like cranberry juice. Pours red (wierd to see) with a slight, red-tinged head. The aroma is cranberries. The taste is all cranberries and raspberries. Makes me pucker up like it is a lime too. I can see having a couple of these in the summer. Really quite good and refreshing. The finish is of slight carbonation and a bit sour, like a Sour Patch Kid."
"If you like the Lindeman's line of lambics, this is one of the top beers in that category. Pours a brilliant red color with a good head. Aroma is, naturally, of cherries - tart, dry, straight-from-the-tree cherries. Flavor is a bit sweeter than the framboise, but still not overpowering. Finish is dry and slightly sour. A quality brew from Lindeman's."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a ruby read color with a nice pink head and very good lace. Smell of tart cherry candy. Some wine like fruityness aromas also come through. Tatse is of sour cherry with some yeast notes coming through. Dare I say that it reminds me of a (gulp) wine cooler, except that it also has a subtle yeastiness to it. It is crisp, dry and somewhat refreshing. Give it a try, just for something different."
"Drinkability and Overall: A lambic is always a good choice. Hard to find a bad lambic. But, some of them aren't as good as others, and unfortunately this one isn't as phenomenal as lambic could be. It's still a great offering, and one I'd love to have again."
"This very different brew poured almost blood red like fruit punch with a well formed frizzy, pink head. The odor consists of a pure black cherry feel. Whew, it is certainly very tart on contact, makes you jump back a bit. The black cherry is potent and all consuming. The finish is sugary sweet that is complemented by a quick, clean sour edge. It is quite a concept, and a lovely beer for sipping. It is one to relax and enjoy."
"Pours a murky red with a bright pink head. Smells like cherries- almost to the point of being like artificially flavored sweet cough syrup. Flavor is sweet with a slight tartness I can't tell if it's from the lambic or from sour cherries. It does not have a pronounced lambic sour astringency. It's ok for what it is, but nothing exciting. To me, it's not beer- it may be a good slightly alcoholic cherry drink, but it's not beer to me. My girlfriend likes it, so it's ok!"
"Pours reddish brown with a slightly pink head. Cherries evident in the aroma, but with spices and wisps of hops. Very pleasing. I was happy that this was more beer-like than the Framboise. Cherry sweet tart candy in the taste, followed by super pucking tartness. lingers forever on the back of the tongue. I could see serving this to unknowing guests after dinner and them really enjoying it. Very accessible."
"Pours cherry red (go figure). Deep pretty color. Not much head at all, moderately carbonated. Taste is, well, cherries! Lots and lots of cherries. A natural sweetness with the cherry tart. It isn't too tart, though a little too sweet. If you want a real beer, I wouldn't recommend this as your option. But, if you're looking for something unique and with lots of character, go with this."
"My first lambic...very interesting. Color is cherry red with a pink, ice cream soda like head. Smell is just a bit odd...I got the cherries, but there was a tad of mustiness present. Taste is very nice..initially sweet cherry, then a pleasant tartness on the finish...hmm..is this a beer? Mouthfeel is smooth and finishes with a nice tartness. Extremely easy to drink. Reminded me a tad of the flavored malt beverages, but witha distinctly higher quality. Will definitely try their other offerings."
"Reflection: I usually dont like cherry flavored anything( bad cough syrup experience as a kid) but this beer is one I plan on having again and again."
"This stuff is growing on me, I think my taste buds have adjusted and I'm liking these style brews more and more, scarry stuff. Anyway this pours out of the corked, capped and foiled bottle, with no freshness dating. its a plummy shade of cherry. Nose is sweet and fruity,leaves some light and well dispersed lacing. Taste is just about right, between tart and sweet, fruity, sticky on the lips. Light and refreshing, went great with a salad this evening. give these lambics a try, they are nicely crafted, interesting, complex beverages."
"Poured a sweet looking dark red color with a white head that lasted until the end and lots of lacing on the glass. The smell was, of course, of cherries. The taste, again, was of black cherries and some sour ones too. The mouthfeel was pretty decent, with a slight syrupy feel and decent carbonatoin. The slight tartness was nice. Overall, I say that this is a pretty decent offering. A great starting point for exposing others to the world of good beer."
"This is a beer I like to whip out on the uninitiated to expand their horizons of beer, even people that don't like beer much appreciate the character and easiness of LKL."
"Except for the slight sourness at the end, this lacks most of the characteristic flavors associated with lambics. But it's still a very tasty beer, far better than most American fruit beers."
"The taste I was pleased by the fact that it wasnt medicine like the smell at all. It was of dark ripe cherries with a slight sour aftertatste that left the mouth watering for more."
"I can no longer convince my wife to taste (or even smell) beer after some unfortunate, though well meaning, attempts on my part to bring her gently into the beer lover's fold. She loves cherry flavored *everything* and has a sweet tooth, so perhaps if I had started with Lindemans Kriek, she'd be better able to share my passion for beer. In others words, chicks'll dig this stuff."
"The acid in the beer makes my tongue a little raw after a while, so it suffers on drinkability."
"This is a dessert beer, nothing else, in my opinion. Its tart cherry flavour would go very well with chocolate cake. I could see it mixed with a stout or a porter for something a little more fun."
"Still, this is one of the better krieks available. Also very suitable as a desert beer. Recommended"
"This can in the smaller 12oz bottle I believe, that was capped and corked. Deep cherry red body with a good sized pinkish head of foam. The head dropped quickly leaving scattered lacing around the glass. Aroma was of sweet cherries with some vinous characteristics. Very similar to the smell was the taste with sweet cherries over a bit of tartness. The sweetness became a little too much by the end of the bottle. The mouth was medium with a bit of over carbonation fizziness. Overall not a bad beer but nothing something I could have too many of enough I was in the mood for something sweet."
"pours a deep red with a pink wispy head. The aroma is dominated by cherries and oakyness. The taste is almost entirely of cherries with some tartness, but definitely not enough. Theres also iron, oak and sacharine sweetness in the middle. The finish is of sweetish cherries. An OK Lambic, but not nearly sour or tart enough. Maybe I got an old or bad bottle."
"Taste is very sweet. Some tartness from the cherries but mostly it's cherry sweetness. Some sour yeastiness. Sticky sweet mouth. I prefer Lindemans Framboise instead of this, more balanced and understated sweetness. But this is a pretty good dessert/after-dinner beer. Wife loves it by the way..."
"Cloudy pinkish ruby hue. Light pinkish white head that turns into a film, but remain satisfying to look at. Explosion of cherries in the nose, extreme sweetness that approaches vanilla. Very mild wheat acidity, but seriously too sweet to refresh. Cloying finish, lively carbonation, medium soft body."
"It's a little strange drinking a beer that tastes more like fruit juice than beer, but what a nice strange it is. The great maroon color and cherry smell really pique the curiosity and let you know that you're in for something different. The cherry flavor is unlike your standard run-of-the-mill fruit beer and is quite smooth and authentic. It has a very nice feel, with very fine carbonation that cleanse the pallate. It's not something that you'd want to drink all night simply because it is sweet and meant as an apertif (imo), but that that isn't meant to take anything away."
"This is a superb lambic and makes for a great dessert beer. It should not be consumed in quantity as it becomes rather sweet after a glass or two. However, the alcohol is relatively low at only 4% ABV."
"D&N: An absolutely perfect dessert beer, or a beer for any other time. The only reason this doesn't get a five on this one is the price. $10 a bottle is pretty steep, but once in a while, tis very worth it. If you haven't tried this one yet, what are you waiting for?"
"Drinkability: It's very good and I could sip quite a few of these, but after awhile the sweetness of all the Lindeman's lambics turn me off. IMO, the best of their offerings."
"I wasn't a big fan of fruit beers, but now that I've had a few of these lambics, they're growing on me. Poured out a nice deep cherry red color with a huge amount of carbonation that took a while for it to settle. Smell was all cherries. Even though it was only one element, it was very pleasing to the nose. Taste was tart with lots of dark cherries. Wasn't as tart as the other fruit lambic's. Good dessert brew."
"Pours a deep maroon with small white lace around the top of the beer. Smell is great, cherries with a hint of wood. Taste is very fruity and sweet yet finishes dry. Mouthfeel is just like a glass of fruit punch. In my opinion, drinkability is not that great. One serving of this beer is enough for me for one night. I just love the cherry taste of this one."
"Drinkability Â– This is my favorite of the Lindemans thus far. I really enjoyed sipping this one down."
"When I poured it into the glass, a festive pink head danced up and quickly fell back down the glass. The lambic is a deep red/purple colour. When you put your nose to it, there is mostly black cherry and alcohol. And unfortunately, thats about all I got from this lambic. There no subtleties that I could detect. For this tongue, it was highly carbonated alcholic black cherry soda...it was nearly syrup."
"I know I'm not alone in thinking that the colors of most Lineman's products especially the Framboise, and now the Kriek, seem downright un-natural? This stuff looks more like the color of a popscicle than a Kriek. Blazing cherry pie red with a nose that can only be jolly rancher red, the beer enters the mouth and even tastes like jolly rancher red-candied and very sweet, this is an after dinner drink or a dessert beer in my book. The beer has none of the sour that I love in the style. I guess this is just the ticket for the so called pepsi generation, but I'll throw my money at the likes of De Ranke, that offer a more complex, complete, challenging, and thirst quenching Kriek. This is pure sugar and would make a nice flavor for a kids breakfast cereal-perhaps one called ""."Lindenberries."" Maybe they could add little hop shaped crunchies?"
"Pours a shockingly cloudy, dark cherry red with pink effervescent foam that dissipates rapidly. The smell is all cherry along with fresh tilled earth and cut grass. Very sour and crisp with a creamy sweetness that is surprisingly non cloying. Not perceptibly hopped, so no bitterness whatsoever. Clean uncomplicated mouthfeel and awesome drinkability. Bubbly and effervescent like a champagne, but without the puckering dryness. IÂ’ll be back for more Lambics, and other beers that I was apprehensive about."
"The beer pours a dark maroon color with a matching head. The aroma is good. It has a very tart cherry scent that pierces your nose; very nice. The taste is awesome. It is full of sour cherries and not much else. It refreshes on the way down. I love this beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks great. I could drink about a gallon of this stuff; a good sessions beer."
"Bottle has a nice classy cork under the cap, but the thing can get kind of dried out as I think most folks store beer upright not on its side like wine. The color is very red, almost like soda pop (like Big Red or Cherwine) and the head is pink and rocky. The aroma is very, very cherry along with a faint sour note that reminds me of cranberry juice. The beer lacks some of the more funky lambic type aromas, which may be good in some folks' opinions. The flavor is a blend of tartness, strong cherry notes, along with some slight puckery astringency and a pretty good dose of sweetness to counteract the tartness. The beer is tasty overall but it doesn't go out on a limb like some of the other lambics. Still it is pleasant and it may be a good beer to suggest to a friend who isn't really into other craft beers. In contrast to Cherish, another kriek, Lindeman's seems a little more aggressive with the sourness but not by much."
"Enjoyed by sampling from a friend's birthday present. Though I took off the cap, I was surprised to find a cork underneath. Pours a dark blood red color, really heavy red. Head is reddish/white, lacy and thick. Smell is tart and sugary. Taste is one of the sweetest beers I've ever had, and not malty sweet, but SUGAR sweet, quite unique. Cherries, cherries, cherries! Overwhelming taste of cherries, not any hops detectable, but the bitter, tart flavor is fairly complex and enjoyable. This beer surprised me. The sweetest drinkable beverage I have ever had."
"like ;-). This is a good beverage, but not one I could drink much of at one sitting. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 9th, 2004: This beer is a bright maroon color with a thin white head. Aroma of black cherries. Mouthfeel like sparkling wine, with a strong tart cherry flavor throughout. The finish is dry and fruity. This is very drinkable after you recover from the initial blast of cherry."
"Starts out very sweet, sourness comes out on the mid-palate. Then, a large amount of cherries come in on the finish followed by more sourness. I really like this beer and I am starting to really like the style. This particular one is a little too sweet for my liking. I was looking for more of a deep cherry flavor and a little more tartness. Nonetheless, this is a tasty ale!"
"KREEK - tastes like creek water, just kidding. They call this beer?? These beers with corks should be called lite wines. Nothing like other beers, very fruity.. but very tame, subtle, and still a bit complex. Yes, its sugary, and tart, that doesn't neccessarily make it horrid, just very different. The overpowering (to me) yeasts and sour cherry flavor tell me to pass this one to the women."
"I love it but it never seems like I'm drinking a beer. I like to have this after dinner."
"paid $4.99 for 12oz."
"Tartness lessens some toward the end, and then, it's pure heaven!"
"Near perfect if you like cherries with your ale."
"Very appealing brew. The head retains rather well atop a beautiful, effervescent cherry red body. I was quite surprised that this beer was not as carbonated as I expected, nor was it overly sweet or tart. Never really at any point makes my lips pucker. Has a mellow cherry flavor to it that is not overdone in any way. It could actually use some more tartness to liven things up a little. A nice Lambic to have every now and then, and it gives me a chance to break out my proper Lambic glassware...woo hoo!"
"Not really sure how I feel about it. I'm used to fruity beer that tastes like Zima, so this was a nice change. The cherry aroma was nice if a bit artificial seeming, but the underlying mustiness scared me. Taste was a very nice balance of sweet and tart, but a cardboard aftertaste really killed it for me. Very welldone for a fruit beer IMHO, but I'm no expert on the style. I'll try others, so I'll give good marks just for encouraging me to try more of a style I've been neglecting."
"Poured rby red with very little head;almost looked fizzy, serious full cheery aroma, becomes a creamy cherry smell on second whiff, felt little carbonation on the tonguesoft creamy cherry taste, not to sweet or sour.Before the day was done I had called 5 people recommending that they try this"
"What a great dessert beer we have here, this one can steal just about any girl's heart even if they say they don't like beer. Appearance: Deep cranberry color with a nice sized pink foam very bubbly champagne like quality all the way on the pour leaving heavy patches of lacing sip after sip nice looking beer. Aroma: Tart cherries oh so nice, vinous wine like presence here a simple a bit one dimensional and sweet but perfect at the same time. Taste: Predominantly one rush of cherries but so well textured and mellow and spritzy but put together so well, perfectly aged I have to seek out other examples of Lambic next mission is Cantillon. Mouthfeel: Bubbly like champagne tickles the senses with each sip yet slight syrup texture so sweet like candy could definitely drizzle this upon some cheesecake for a devine experience. Drinkability: Low abv tastes like candy easily consumed but very sweet keeping this one for me a true dessert beer, it's awesome the beer that makes many a folk realize that beer is such a broad term."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with two fingers of light pink head. There is a little bit of lace left on the glass. Aromas of sweet black cherry and tartness fill the top of the glass. The smell is very rich and strong. The taste hits the tongue sweet, but turn tart quickly. The cherry taste is full and bold. The mouthfeel is very thick, but just a little bit bubbly. The drinkability is very good. A damn good lambic!"
"Overall it's a great lambic. It's almost a little tough to drink because it's so tart. After one bottle I felt like my teeth were going to rot from the acidity. But still.. A wonderful examble of the style."
"I didn't quite know what to expect on this one. Overall I thought it was great. It looked like champagne, it tasted a bit like cider. Definitely not what I am used to in a beer. I loved it thought. $11.00 a bottle at the local beer bar is pretty expensive though. I could go for another one. One good thing is you could drink a lot of these and at 4.0 ABV you will still be able to walk out."
"Overall: This was my first lambic that I've tried. I was blown away by it. I spent a lot of money the following week sneaking a few bottles to the back of the fridge so my girlfriend wouldn't notice my purchases. Once she tried it she didn't care how much money I'd spent. I like this one a lot."
"There was very little head on the beer, if that is what you could call it. It was sort of some frothy bubbles that ring the side of the glass. There was some lace as well. The color was thin, bloody burgandy, which was imperveous to light. It was difficult to even see what was going on inside. Only occasionally could you see some particles floating around. The aroma was tart and earthy with a fair bit of damp, grassy notes deep in the nose. The taste was tart, but not total mouth pucker tart. Wonderful sour notes of dark syrupy cherries and lemon. The mouthfeel was thicker than the taste would let on with zesty tiny carbonation bubbles. I could drink a thousand of these all summer long if my wallet would let me."
"This brew has a strong Cherrie smell. Large purplish colored head of small, large and medium bubbles with a cloudy pinkish brown body. It leaves a nice lacing as it goes down. Refreshingly nice sweet fruit juice flavor with a lot of carbonation. It is very interestingly nice. My first Lambic and I kind of like it. If you like wine coolers you'll love this brew!"
"It poured a lustrous ruby red with a bit of lace that migrated quickly to the sides of the glass. The smell was different from any of the other lambics I've had. To put it roughly, it smelled like a nice pilsner with marischino cherries and a wet horse blanket all tossed into the same room together. The ""pils"" and cherry notes were strongest. The taste was very good with a large sweet cherry flavor leading the way, followed by a very sharp acid bite and then a subdued, mellow cherry finish. This beer will definitely make your mouth pucker. Easy to drink, and very interesting, this is one beer that I enjoy."
"An attractive pour somewhere between crimson and burgundy. Topped with a finger's worth of tight pink foam that laces heavily along the sides. Sweet black cherry scent that is noticeably more natural than the notes one finds in many fruit beers. Despite the strength of the fruit smell, foundation of clean grains is present as well. A crush of sweet but not syrupy cherries dominates the taste. This reminds me of a genuine fountain-made cherry phosphate but with enough underlying (and relatively dry) malt taste to prevent it from being unidimensional. Fades to a nice balance between fruit and grain, with a cleaner mouthfeel than I expect from something this sweet. Entirely too drinkable for one's own good (or the good of one's wallet). My first lambic will certainly not be my last."
"Burgundy hue, a finger of pink head, healthy retention, thick sheets of lace. Delicious black cherries dominate the nose with faint hints of maltiness. Alluring. Scrumptious palate, pleasantly tart but there is a perfect undertone mix of tangy and sweet cherries... nice malt undertones too. Ideal carbonated, medium-light bodyÂ… a simple pleasure to drink. Lovely acidic/tart aftertaste, slight puckering affect, leaves you wanting more. Indeed it lacks some flavor depth and complexity but this is still a tasty treat. Screw wine, drink lambic!"
"Pours to a reddish-purple color. Has a super black cherry smell. It smells like cherry pie and cherry 7up. The flavor is sweet with black cherries. It is just delicious. It would be a great beer with a dessert like white cake or vanilla ice cream. A very enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours a dark red color with a small pink head and medium lacing. It comes corked and capped - which I've never seen before. The aroma was very sweet and filled with fruity scents. The taste was very sweet and it reminded me of a good wine. The flavor is very strong of cherries and very enjoyable. This is not a beer drinker's beer, but it is more of a sweet wine drink. I really enjoyed the taste, but I wouldn't call this a beer. It's also quite expensive and has a very low ABV."
"Very nice smooth brew with some tingly carbonation. Sour cherries are accompanied by a very sweet flavor to really excite the taste buds. It is a delightful brew, and although my experience with lambics is certainly limited, I find this to be quite enjoyable. It is much less tart than some others. I can't decide if I like it better that way or not. Definitely try it."

"Bright cherry red in color with a fair bit of pinkish/white head. Sweet cough syrupy smell kind of turned me off. A little too sweet for how I like my lambics... tartness was almost non-existent. Lindeman's is closer to a fruit beer than a true lambic IMO."
"This is the first lambic I've had, and I'm impressed. In the words of the Continental, ""Wow, wowwy wowwy wow!"" This stuff is absolutely fantastic. Pours a cherry red color with a bubbly pink head that dissipates quickly. Has a somewhat musty cherry nose to it. The taste is out of this world. Very tart, great cherry flavor. The alcohol is almost indetectable, which makes it very easy drinking. Unfortunately, it goes for about 6.00 for a 12 oz bottle here in Boston."
"Comments: I enjoyed the fruity aspects of this beer, although IÂ’m not big on musty aromas. The fruit tastes were fantastic, especially the way the cherry mixed with the sour apple. And that grassy taste too. Its like IÂ’m down on the farm eating cherries and apples. Yeeha! This is good fun. As Paul McCartney once sang, Â“I Look High, I Look Low, I'm Lookin' Everywhere I Go, Lookin' For A Home In The Heart Of The Country.Â” If I can only get used to that musty smell. Gotta move out to the country one of these days."
"Ruby red...pinkish head. Pinkish head says ""bye bye"" pretty quickly, even though he was welcome to stay longer. Liquid cherry pie anyone? Sweet sweet sweet, sour sour sour. Sweet first, then sour. 50/50 for sure. Not all cherries though...berries berries too. Smooth mouthfeel, very highly drinkable. I'm thoroughly impressed. This is the first lambic I have tried. I can't wait to try others. This stuff is beer? Fruit juice beer! Yumm!"
"While I find it amazingly drinkable, it lacks the ""beerness"" of beer. It's not a let's hang out with boys sort of beer, but that's OK it has it's place. It's a good night cap beer or a let's sit in a pricy Belgian style bar beer."
"For how sweet it is, I actually think it's very drinkable. After a few servings, however, it's like sucking down syrup. Overall, it's a great beer if you're looking for ""fruit"" -- especially to pair with desserts. Not traditional, but who cares when you're eating sorbet and slathering it in this?"
"An interesting side note... this is the first beer my wife has *ever* enjoyed drinking."
"Slight berry nose with hints of yeast. Ruby red color with a pinkish head that disapates rapidly. Tart berry taste (not just cherry but berry) with a dry toungued finish. Good balence between the sweetness and the tartness. Medium smooth mouthfeel. It is a good Lambic, but not as intensely flavored as their Fram of Cassis. Good for after dinner with sweets."
"Pours dark red in color with a foamy light pink colored head. Nose is very floral with a strong aroma of fresh roses. Taste is a bit sweet at first but then a delicious tartness of dark cherries takes over. Hop bitterness is almost nonexistent. A nice change of pace brew that makes for an excellent after-dinner drink."
"A very pleasing to the eye deep cherry red with the head modest in size and as it desiccates quickly leaves a patchy bit of lace. Sweet ripe cherries, lightly malted a real treat to the nose. Cloyingly sweet at the start, top lanky and the finish tart with a moderate acidity and a very light hop presence. Quite a nice change of pace from the hop laden over the top malt and devastatingly high ABV beers I normally quaff."
"My first Kriek...Opaque dark red with an insanely pink (even more than the Framboise) frothy head that laces attractively. Yeah, a lot of cherry to the aroma, but a little too much cherry soda for me. There is a bit of hay mustiness, but I could have used some more. Cherry is naturally the predominant flavor, a bit of grape. On the oversweet side. As many people say that Lambics are brewed sweeter these days, I long for a return to the sour side -- more pits, stems, and skins. There is a decent dryness to the finish, distinguishing it from many American fruit brews, so at least there are two impressions in the complexity department. A little cloying..."
"The drinkability is very good. Smooth and very refreshing."
"The color after pouring in the glass was of a bright reddish crimson. The smell was of cherries and the aroma seemed so lushish. The taste of this beer was of a cherry nature, but, I felt like I was drinking a kind of cough medicine. I shared this bottle with another person and he felt the same way. But, his wife loved it!"
"Pours a hazy, purple-tinged crimson robe topped by a frothy pink head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace. Absolutely interesting to look at! The aroma is candyish with super sweet cherry backed by mild tart notes. The body is light with a very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor is astoundingly rich with tart and sweet cherry, but also reveals a bit of lambic character in the finish along with some lingering sweetness. Still, it dries out with a touch of sour astringency. Although I personally find this to be overly sweet and lacking in lambic flavor and aroma, I still feel it warrants high marks based on it's massive character. And it does make an excellent dessert beer!"
"Dark pink in color, with a thin light pink colored head that leaves some sporadic lace. Big time black cherry aroma along with some sugary sweetness. My mouth is watering. Light bodied and a nice mouthfeel. Starts very tart and then the cherry flavor comes out. Flavor is of black cherries, not a fake cherry taste. Turns sour and then back to tart, as these two characteristic battle it out. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Not too syurpy. Have with dessert, possibly chocolate cake. Delicious!!"
"The color is deep-pink, almost red, and a thin cotton-candy colored head floats on top. The smell is intense cherries. The first taste is tart, but not really sour, like many other lambics. The foretaste is, at first, very sweet, but contrasted with the tartness, it is welcome. Cherry flavor remains strong throughout the brew, and the finish is crisp and very refreshing."
"Beer is the essence of grain. This is the essence of grain and cherries. Emphasis on the cherries. These beers really test the limits of how much fruit can be packed into a mere 750ml bottle. Pure, intense, natural. I find these a lot less cloying than it seems others do. While sweet on the attack, the finish is as dry as a whistle. The impression of sweetness seems perfectly balanced. The fruit was simply very ripe, and that's what carries through the flavors."
"Pours with a billowing effervescent pink-tinged head, settling out on top of hazy, murky dark pink/red liquid. Nose is tart cherries mixed with a soda pop sugary sweetness. Taste is a refreshing tartness followed by sugary notes and a cherry tartness emphasized by by the light-bodiedness from the wheat malt. Finishes up tart and very refreshing, my only complaint here is that it's just a tad too heavy-handed with the sweetness. Still, it would be too easy to drink mass quantities of this beer...it's just too damn expensive to make that a reality! I love this beer...I must be the minority because I see it really doesn't get high marks from many here."
"Bias-disclosure: I like my lambics/krieks/geuze very traditional. I want bracing acidity and sourness and I, most of all, want to taste the complexity of the lambic(s). This had none of these elements. The cherries should be just a part of the palate of a Kriek, not its sole compenent. It kills me that Lindeman's markets a beer this sweet - I wish they'd make a more traditional kriek as well because I know that the under-lying lambic is a quality product but here it is completely obliterated by the cherries and, especially, the sugar."
"Big pitted pink Barbie doll head. Candied cherry wood stain body. Nose is sweet cherry kid's drink. Almost artificial. Taste is slight tang, more real cherry, and something making me think of hay. My wife loved it."
"If I want cherry juice, I buy cherry juice (or cherries!). If I want beer (yes, thank you, I don't mind if I do!), I buy beer. It might be a conservative attitude, but I see no reason to buy an over-priced combination of the two. Refreshing? Sure. Best cherry soda I've ever had? Indeed. But beer? Nooooo......!"
"It tastes quite good, very sweet and that is what you expect. Its a beaute. I''m quite fond of the Lindemans line and this one is deserving as well. Special occasion beer or for the girl."
"Big on cherry flavour both sweet and sour ... some people add sugar cubes to cut the tartness but I think it is fine the way it is. A brew with depth and character ..."
"very drinkable yes, but at times it was too much like drinking fruit cordial or something, but still nice and at least its interesting."
"Probably one of my favorite beers...thick, frothy pink head and exceptional cherry flavor. Finally, a beer that's good enough for breakfast, brunch or dessert! It may get a little old drinking more than a couple of bottles though...it's a little on the sweet side, but still one of the top two in Lindemans line of lambics."
"Amazing, so much fruit infused into the lambic. It's in the nose, the taste, the aftertaste..all with different levels and dimension throughout the tasting adventure. It forces you to drink more. Never buy less than the largest botle available.The only fault I could possibly find is that this is tremendously sweeter than more traditional lambics such as Cantillon, Boon, or Timmermans."
