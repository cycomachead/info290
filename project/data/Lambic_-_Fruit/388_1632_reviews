"Cork 2014. 750 mL. Pour is dark ruby red, clear, with a pinkish head. Nose has a little paper, seltzery brett, some mushroom notes, with a moderate fleshy cherry. Flavor is quite simple, very little lambic, hints of leathery brett, strong cherry flesh, cherry juice, moderate carb, smooth feel and drinkable body, with a lightly sour finish."

"Unlike most Krieks where the brewer or blender sweatens the finished product up for consumer's tastes, this one does not. You notice the take no prisoners character of this kriek upon opening the bottle as tart funky cherry aromas flow from the bottle. It pours an energetic hazy cherry red and its champagne like head quickly dissipates. This is a very dry, very tart cherry drink with traces of lemon, oak, over ripe fruit, and a hard to define, bitter finish. Refreshing and lives up to the hype."

"Had this one with a good friend of mine to celebrate the birth of his 2nd child.  He brought it back from Cantillon where he spent his honeymoom 3 years earlier.  Excellent fruit notes, nice light tart and very drinkable!!"

"Had after tour of Cantillon in Brussels."

"Overall: A top drawer Kriek, but then this is a Cantillon after all. Well worth a try - in terms of sourness it's quite a bit tamer than its raspberry sibling, but that's not to say you'll get easy sipping sweetness. You won't. Well worth trying if you can track it down - availability seems to vary wildly. This is up there with Kasteel Rouge as my favourite cherry beer."

"Overall- a nice beer, i liked that the fruitiness was subtle, man this beer is sour. worth trying but would not seek out again."
"Splendid Belgian funk mixed with some ripe, tart cherries, lemon zest, hay, and restrained sourness."
""
""
"Farmhouse fresh with a touch of hay and we're dog. Fantastic lambic"
""
"Though very tart, it is not at all one dimensional. Lots of cherry character though just a touch less complex and jammy as Drie Fonteinen. Still lovely."

"A real treat to drink, hope to eventually get some more."

"O: No flavour, just sourness, but it would go down great on a hot summer's day."

"Bottle at Brasserie Cambrinus while in Bruges. Side by side with Rose de Cambrinus. Pours deep red color with a pink half finger head. Aroma of tart cherries, wheat malts, a bit of oak. Flavor follows with big cherry, though not overly sweet, with perfect tartness, and some vanilla coming through as well. Medium dry on the palate, light plus bodied, plenty of carbonation. My first time having this one and I think I light like it better then the LP Kriek. Awesome stuff!"

"it is nice, but muddled by various flavors that are going on"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My first Cantillon was a special treat.  I really couldn't find a way past the incredible flavors the oak produce in this beer.  The oak manages to round all of the corners perfectly together, especially the cherries which take on a much darker profile then I expected.  A truly wonderful experience."

"O: Awesome, smooth must try if you can ever swing it. I drank this one at the brewery Cantillon. It came free with the brewery tour."
""
""
""
""
"O: What is there to say that hasn’t already been said? Cantillon just has that distinctive unique funk to it. Having never had this fresh, I’m sure the fruit is much brighter and prominent. But I like the funk better and I think overall this is an exceptionally well-rounded beer."
""
""
"Served in a large bottle at CASK in London. Poured into a tulip glass. The appearance is a red/pink color with lots of carbonation. Very champagne like. Smell is acidic and fruity. It smells like cherries. The taste is wonderful, tart, and fruity. Very drinkable. One of the best sours that I have had. Overall it was great. I ended up sharing it with my wife and she typically does not like sours."

"Overall an awesome Kriek in its balance of flavors and overall drinkability. Sometimes too much cherry knocks the drinkability of krieks for me. But this mixes in the lambic flavors quite nicely. Out of the more standard and available krieks I'd put this behind 3F Oude Kriek and Mariage Parfait Kriek. But that's saying a lot as those beers are phenomenal."

"i have no idea if the ratings will reflect this or not, but while i was drinking this, i kept thinking its as good as the lou pepe edition. does it need twice the fruit or another year? i dont think so at all. this is a candy apple red pour, maybe a touch pinker, but really blood stained red, clear though, and with about a half inch of just tainted pink white head. it smells like candied cherries, not really fresh fruit, but not due to artificial sugar or anything, it think its more a product of the lambic base, which is tart as hell, a lot like the classic gueuze really, farmy and funked to high heaven, with a subtle barrel profile. good acidity on the palate, not overdone in the slightest, with the cherry getting more and more intense as the beer warms. wishing for nothing, i find this supremely delicious, and while it may not be as complex or as natural cherry flavored as the lou pepe version, i find it cleaner, equally tasty, and a little more blonde sour basey than its big brother. carbonation is on point, uncommon is real lambic, and frankly just freaking awesome. i find myself drinking it way too fast, but thats just the sign of killer beer. not the best ive had from cantillon, but on par in terms of quality with any of them."

"Beautiful pour on this one, bright pink/red. Nice two finger pink head, very bubbly. The cherry is very upfront in the smell. Tart cherry skin and a little bit of funk. Taste isn't as tart as I expected, pretty gentle, nice bubbly mouthfeel. Cherries and cinnamon. Great cherry aftertaste. Very nice lambic, even if it isn't incredibly complex."

"Notes: The cork was cracked in the bottle and there appeared to be some sediment stuck to the cap but the drink itself drank within reason. Only small flavor issues that I didn't mention."
"O- Cantillon makes some of the best lambic in the business and the addition of the cherries adds a nice fruit presence that doesn't dominate the base too much. The beer isn't overly sweet like some fruited lambics I've had and while it isn't quite as fruity as the Lou Pepe beers it still has a nice presence + balance. Definitely one of my favorite krieks out there and I wish I could drink this on a regular basis."
""
""
""
"The beer is a slightly hazy pinkish-red color with a thick and foamy pinkish-white head that dissipates slowly. Sticky rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of funky cherries, oak and yeast. Light-bodied with flavors of tart cherries and berries, funky yeast and vinous oak. The finish is fruity with a lingering sour cherry and apple aftertaste. Really good all around."

"O: Excellent. Tart and very prevalent cherry. Tasty and Crisp."
""
"Deep ruby red in appearance. Very cloudy in appearance with very little light getting through. A minimal bit of white foam only covers a fraction of the top of the beer. The aroma is of strongly tart cherries. The body is light,crisp,and a bit sticky. The flavor is strong of tart cherries with a long bitter fade."

"Smells wonderful/absolutely horrible at the same time. Carbonation is perfect, intense fruit. Super crisp, complex and flavorful. Very hard to put into words what a treat this unique beer is - a standard for the style. Not as good as other Loons but that's hardly criticism. Great beer"

"Update 7/24/14 with 750ml bottle dated 12/5/13: a little rougher than the previous bottle. Wonderful cherry pie nose but the flavor is a little high on the acetic acid making for a very sour and slightly astringent offering. There is also a heavy earthy / leathery tone."

"Overall a rock-solid kriek that, for me at least, sets the bar pretty high for the style."

""

"This brew pours a beautiful rich red indicative of the cherries used to make it. No head at all but more carbonation than I was expecting. I did pour very slow because this is my first Cantillon lambic and I wanted to savor every second. It smells of sour cherries. There is nothing artificial hitting the senses. You can smell the wood barrels that this.kriek was aged in. I pleasant funk dominates the palate and by holding it in your mouth for a few seconds you can feel the flavor evolve from sour to earthly with the cherries making their presence known throughout. A good.amount of carbonation and a well balanced mouth feel. Overall, this is the best lambic I have had to date. If it wasn't so hard to get, I would buy more. Absolutely outstanding..."

"Some other notes I have. Tried a 1992 375 ml. bottle courtesy of Martinus @ RBBWG 2013, there were doubts about this beer prior to opening it, which all instantly vanished once we tried this, has kept incredible well, even better integrated than younger bottles, didn’t think that this is possible."

""
"O-Gotta love a fresh fruit lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: I love Lambics, Sours and Wild Ales and this is a superb offering. The flavours were in near perfect balance with each other, nothing dominating. Nothing really complex about this brew, but when it's so well crafted like this it doesn't need to be. Just delicious and rewarding, a true treat."

"Cantillon never lets me down. This was a lot more sour than I was expecting, in a good way. An excellent example of a world-class Kriek. Must try for all Belgian sour fans."
"The more I drink this beer, the more I like/love it. Very sweet cherry flavor, as much like a wine as a sour, but the sour does come through in a big way. Gets better as it warms and certainly well made. Oak flavors add to the complexity and enjoyment. If you're into craft, you gotta give the best lambics a try, and this is one of them. Me likey."
""
"Overall: This is a fine lambic. Cantillon has proven that they set the bar for most sours. This beer is no different. The cherry flavor is top notch and the oak and funk make this an enjoyable beer. I'm glad I got to experience this. I guess I have to find some more of this!"
""
""

"O: I like this beer, but I'm not sure I understand the fuss? Delicate and enjoyable."
""
""
"This really is one of the best sours I’ve had. It actually has some similarities to Supplication, based on my limited knowledge of wild ales, though not as sour and certainty with more red wine characteristics."
""
"Overall: Really good kriek. The cherries and sourness are the stars of this beer, more so than the funk (though that's not to say it's not there). This is another example why Cantillon is one of the best in the business."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O/D - A great fruit lambic. Lovely and drinkable with tons of complexity and deliciousness. Definitely world class."
""
""
""
""
"Great Kriek! Drinks incredibly well and is a very enjoyable brew. All I can say is that I love the flavour profile, aroma and the sourness of Cantillon beers. It reminds me of my recent vacation in Belgium where I visited the brewery twice, and that smell just brings it home for me.. putting a big grin on my face. Love it."
""
"Ok, as promised I am back with a younger one. It is just over a year old. There is more carbonation and more fruity taste, though rather raspberry than cherry. However, they are right that it is somewhat better when young."

"I knew sooner or later I'd need to cough up the cash to try this one, its a solid brew and a funk monster but its hard to drop the dough when I could get few great brews for the same price as this single bottle. That being said I'm probably going to buy more Cantillon in the near future for no other reason then I've yet to try it"

"8/16/12 Bottle from Utobeer. Colour is reddish, with some amber tinge. It’s not like those bright pink krieks, cloudy with white head. Nose is very sour, burnt white sugar, cherry, sour little cheesy yeast. Taste is acidic sour, lip smackingly so. Bit of cherry fruit, white apple sour and some citric tongue curling sour. 3.8 Rerate - Keg in Craft Beer Co. 2nd B’day. Great balance between sweet and sour. Nose is minerally cherry fruit, raspberries, sugary merengue, bit of farmyard and mud, Taste is lots of granny smith sour, bit of sour raspberry and subtle cherry.

"The taste was surprisingly mild on the sour front, I would describe it as mildly tart and not at all in an acidic way that many sour beers develop. Definitely got some hints of cherries here, this was truly a delightful beer."

"Overall: Cantillon has quickly become one of my favorite breweries. This is my second 75 cl bottle and it grows on my each time. The sourness will come as a surprise to people unfamiliar with lambics. I could sip on this all day. So I will."
"O - Solid kriek with lots of tartness to it instead of being too sweet (this is one of my pet peeves with some of the beers in this still). It brings nice cherry flavor while still allowing the lambic tartness to shine through"

"T: A big, meaty sour cherry note upfront with some raspberry preserves, lemony tartness and cherry skins. The tartness lingers on your tongue forever, never really becoming overpoweringly sour. Just a hint of carbonation keeps the mouthfeel light enough without detracting from the flavors. This is awesome stuff."

"My first Cantillon and the best lambic-style I’ve come across, I think that’s because the sourness is not as intensely in-your-face, this offers a balanced, intricate tart, semisweet flavor profile, with amazing feel and complexity. A work of art in every sense, this will definitely entice me to try more from Cantillon. 4.5"
""
"O - a very good example of a traditional Kriek, but Cascade Kriek is still number one for me."

"Cantillon Kriek pours out a brilliant ruby with a small light red head that quickly drops. Beautiful looking. The aroma is a nice musty, tart cherry with a solid amount of acidity. The taste is beautiful, providing layers of yeast, tart cherry, oak, and lactic acid. It's a very bright and crisp beer. The aftertaste is a thing of beauty, with a lingering delicate tart cherry skin flavor hanging out for quite some time. Basically - if you like fruit beers, you absolutely have to try this. Cantillon Kriek and New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red are easily the best two cherry beers on the market, and each represent a different side of the coin - sweetness for the New Glarus and tartness for the Cantillon."
""
""
""
"A lovely beer to be drinking when the cherry trees are blooming. Although it lacks the complexity of a gueze kriek, honesty and simplicity is this beer's virtue, as well as its price."
""
""
""
""

"O - Fruit, slight funk, complex and lovely to drink."

"Enjoyed another '12 thanks to Ron. Even more sour than I remember. A lot more funk to it, too. Overall, just entirely more flavor-packed than I remember (and believe me, it was already incredible before). Super sour and acidic cherries, raspberries, and grapes. Less vinous this time around. So quenching and addictive. Gotta bump the score up on this one. Great stuff."

""
"Bottle 750ml, 2013 vintage. Pours a bright but not so dense red with huge white foam that recedes quickly. Aroma is cherries and berries, leaves and lactic notes. Very light barnyard funk per Cantillon standards. Taste is very tart cherries but also a surprising cherry peel bitterness. Palate is light with moderate carbonation. Not as rich as the Lou Pepe versions, but still interesting. I much prefer this version fresh. 4.0"
""
"Yum yum. One of best lambics I've had. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT via Jim C."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Such a delightful kriek from Cantillon. The fruit is so fresh right now and the pie-like experience is really wonderful. It's always a treat to have a fruit lambic from Cantillon as they really don't take shortcuts when it comes to using fresh fruit."

"Overall: I think I enjoy this better than the Lou Pepe Kriek I had. Have to keep in mind that was a 2007 (sticker) vintage, so it would definitely be more sour."
""
"O: This is one of the greatest lambics I have ever had in my life. It goes down with ease and is just beyond delicious. I will for sure be ordering this beer again from Etre Gourmet and age several bottles"
"O-Great beer, tough to decide if I prefer this or the Lou pepe Kriek. Cantillon never fails with the fruited lambics."
""
""
"Pours a murky light red with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt, sour cherry, and earthy aromas. Taste is much the same with a nice acidic sourness on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite tasty and easy to drink."

"O: Here’s to hundreds more like this! Everything they said about Cantillon is true, it seems. Whenever I drink a kriek, memories of this beer will flicker on for comparison: this is the standard for Belgian fruit lambics, as far as I’m concerned."
""
""
"O: Delightful. Great hints of fresh cherries with a lactic sour kick and a restrained funk."
"The cap came off and the cork worked itself effortlessly (literally without a corkscrew) out of the bottle. The contents revealed a clear, ruby red, effervescent beverage with no head. The nose is relatively dank and cultured with a slight fruitiness, almost perfume-like. Fortunately the beer drinks just as gentle, except for a wickedly underestimated sourness. The mouthfeel is spot on with enough fruit sweetness and body to balance out the dry, sour aftertaste. Perfect beer to pair with a rich chocolaty dessert like I have as it cleanses the palate with each sip and complements the already booze-infused cherries in the dessert."
""
"Overall I'm really glad I finally tried a Cantillon ""fresh"". Much different experience than aged ones that get ""sour dominant"". I can't believe there was a time I didn't like sours. If you are looking to get into sours seek out a bottle of this and have it as fresh as possible."
""
"Medium body, higher carbonation, chewy and dry on the tongue. This is fantastically worth the money and completely ahead of the pack when it comes to regular storm prep."

"Big thanks goes out to sincereNc for sharing this one during a fair sized Cantillon tasting! 2011 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon balloon. Poured a deep dark ruby red with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour, funk, tart cherry, and diaper. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart cherry, funk, sour, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Just for the record, I love this brew. I opted to review this one on a fresher bottle as I have had an ’03 vintage of this before in the past and it was absolutely crazy how sour/tart it had turned. This one really allowed the cherry and funk to shine throughout each sip. Really well balanced on sweetness from the fruit and the tartness going on. I would suggest anyone try this one at least once, but I wouldn’t make it my first sour as depending on the age it could be quite overwhelming for some."
"Tart and puckering with the perfect amount of sour acidity balanced out by sweet fruit sugars. This is a recent vintage so the cherries really stand out with an almost dessert/pie like flavor but the sweetness is excellently balanced by earthy barnyard funk, dry oak and acetic vinegar. Very dry and tart throughout with earthy oak, lactic and acetic funk, and a lingering vinegar-like flavor in the finish that has me salivating for more. Aggressively sour but never too harsh or solvent like because of the freshness of the fruit. Again, I'm picking up the skin and pit of the fruit which adds complexity while complimenting the sour, earthy funk flavors. Not a beginner sour/Lambic but I find it delicious and pretty easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it better than Rose de Gambrinus. A decent Kriek; however I will need to search these beers out fresher, as the fruit flavor is really what I prefer in these beers over the sour/tartness."
""
"Pours a rich, crystal clear, ruby red with a pink head that builds up quick and dissipates right away. Nose is tart cherries, grapes, plums and sour fruits and just a slight hint of something woody. The taste is super tart, sour cherries, red grapes, pears, raspberries all rounded out with a very effervescent kick. The extreme carbonation fades out and leaves notes of tart cherry juice sitting on the tongue. Originally I thought I'd prefer this over the raspberry Cantillon I bought at the same time but I actually think I may have liked the Rose de Gambrinus slightly better. This is still a great lambic and it satisfies the craving I had for a sour ever since I had Gueze Fond at dinner. I hope to find more Cantillon at some point, especially Blaeber."
""
"O: It is a great beer, but you have to expect the immense tartness of this beer. For those who enjoy sour beers, this is a no brainer."
""
""
"O: A decent Kriek, but the acetic acid is a bit much. If everything was tuned down a bit in this beer the complexity would come out a bit more I think. It's tough to rate this style since there are so few traditional versions of it, but I prefer 3F by a large margin."
""
""
"Loaded with tart and cherry. Aggressive but complex. This is the elixir of dreams. I'm not sure a fruit Lambic can really improve from here if you're in to the super tart thing. A bit more fruit wouldn't hurt, but not having it doesn't hurt it."
"I had high expectations for this beer, as it is from Cantillon. Somehow this was even more intense than I expected. So much cherry tartness. This is like eating some kind of ridiculous cherry bread, but more magical."
""
""
""
"Tied with Fou'Foune for my favorite shelf Cantillon."
"Very drinkable given how imposing the flavors are. Fantastic stuff."

"375 ml bottle. Fairly fresh. Pours a slightly hazy orange reddish amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is funky cherry, a bit of earthiness, a very light sulfur note, and a hint of raspberry. The initial taste has a light sweetness with some cherry. There is more cherry in the taste than the nose. There is also a funky earthiness, and lemon tartness. The finish is tart with cherry and a bit of funkiness. Medium body. Medium to low carbonation. Quite enjoyable. This is quite a bit dryer than the 3F Oude Kriek."

"O: Love the tartness, but I'd like a little more fruitiness."
"O: Overall, a very nice and tasty beer. As previously mentioned, the fruit is mostly gone/faded on this. To re-balance itself I think this vintage could stand to sit for a bit and mellow out. However, classic/vintage Cantillon rarely disappoints and this follows that mantra."

"Poured into tulip glass. Pours a light pinkish red with nice clarity. Rose colored head forms and dissipates quickly, minimal lacing present. The aroma features tart and dry cherries with notes of oak and tannins. The flavor starts with a bit of tart cherry, but never becomes sour. Instead the flavor dries quickly and has a very neutral finish. The mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall, a nice lambic, although I was hoping for a little more tartness. Definitely a change of pace compared to other krieks I have encountered."
""
""
"Easy to drink, and I would drink this all the time if it was easily found."
"Perfect mouthfeel for the style; medium to very slightly light with spritely carbonation. Crisp and puckering. Probably the best kriek I've had although I haven't opened my Lou Pepe yet. Similar in intensity to Hanssen's kriek."
"Not horrible, but below average and nowhere near the standard I usually expect from Cantillon. The cherry sweetness and massive acidity create a medicinal taste."
"Overall: Hype is definitely deserved for this brewery and I will seek more out. Simply stellar."
""
""

"Deep pink-violet colored with a light pink head. Strong funk and soft cherries in the aroma. Tastes puckering sour and clean, but with hints of vinegar. Notes of oak as well. The fruit is not as intense as the color led me to believe. Clean, dry and effervescent feel."
"O - So, so, so fucking good. This is another great example of wonderfulness from Cantillon. Superbly done."

"Kriek-Lambic is a style that has not much been improved on since its inception, however many centuries ago. The modern, commercial examples that add fruit juices or sugar may appeal to a wider audience but, for my money, there's nothing more appetizing than lemon juice acidity, mildewy oak wood must, and the tartness of wild yeasts and bacterias."

"O: A fine, complex sour beer which I came to appreciate and enjoy even though sours aren't my favorite."
""
""
""
"I prefered the raspberry based lambic. Found the cherry flavors more cough/syrupy sweet, with less of the salty tartness. More dark cherry flavors, more my preference, I could see how others would enjoy this though. Everyone needs to sample cantillon brews, this one included."
"Overall: I loved the real cherry flavor. My wife who doesn't like sours ordered one after having mine. So smooth and easy drinking."
"O: pretty much what i had expected to find here from cantillon, a well executed and well rounded lambic which is pretty much spot on, as i mentioned before, this is not my favorite kriek as i think lindemans beats is out nicely with more sweetness and drinkability, still a wonderful lambic and im very happy with my $25 investment here"
""
"Thanks Patrick and thanks to my wife for indulging my pilgrimage to the Cantillon Brewery."
""
"O: A. Really like this. Understand how good people say it is."
"O: I enjoy this beer, but tend to lean towards the American wild alternative to Krieks like Consecration (especially aged). However, the Lou Pepe Kriek is one of the best beers I have had the delight to try. I'll probably sit on my other bottle of this for a few years and see just how sour it gets."

"Pours a nice pink cranberry color, head quickly dissipates. Smell is cherries and some sour yeast. Got some serious action going on in the taste...cheeries and the tartness abounds. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and a total pucker fest. Great beer!"
""
"o - i've slowly been converting to the dark side...or should i say the sour side? and with this exploration, i begin to understand the infatuation with cantillon. kriek is no different...although the funkiest of the bunch i've tasted...still a world class beer. this brewery understands the style and thus far, every variation is worth checking out...however, the common ones seem to be just as tasty, if not more tasty than some of the trickier ones to acquire (although, my exploration has been minimal compared to what's out there). cheers and thanks for a great brew."
"O - If you like sour and you like cherries, this is your beer. Not sure it gets much better in the beer world with this combo. It's sharp, yet works perfectly together. Good stuff!"
"My first sample of the style, but I found it enjoyable. Quite sour, but the funkiness helps give it a balance."

"This was my first Cantillon ever and i was very impressed and I know this is not the best they have. I have a Rose de Gambrinus which I look forward to try."
"I first had this years ago in Philly, either at Monk's or the Belgian Cafe I believe, but I've also just recently revisited it. Poured a deep red color, with a fizzy cap of pinkish-white head that receded to a thin layer of delicate bubbles. Aroma of tart cherries, notes of yeast and grassy funk. As would be guessed, the taste is pretty much full-blown cherries up front, some tartness, some sweetness, with slighter undertones of barnyard funk, acetic and citric acids. Medium body, a little syrupy, quite drinkable, and quite exemplary of the style, even if not the best."
""

"D - A nice but rather simple sour. While I enjoyed my introduction to Cantillon and sours in general, I don't know that I could make it through a bottle of this too often."

"M: Dry and tart. No carb."

"Overall: Great,crisp and refreshing not to sweet, cherries are there but balanced by intense sour notes, not overly complex but very enjoyable. I would definetly recommend this one."

"Overall, a delicious offering. Easy to see why these are sought after."
"Light body with some light carbonation. Very refreshing. Pretty tasty kriek."

"O-this is one of the best beers i've ever had. of course, i'm a huge fan of sours and lambics, but this just raised the bar. i want a never ending supply of this. i wish it were cheaper...its a taste i just can't get out of my head"
""
"Body is medium-light to medium, with noticeable but not aggressive carbonation. Pleasant, excellent for sipping and trying to discern the flavors. Finish is dry."
""
"O - The tartness is a little overwhelming at first, but after a few sips, it becomes less noticeable as the tongue adjusts. The big cherry flavors mix very well with the sourness. A very enjoyable lambic worthy of being my 100th review!"

"Medium-light body with some great-feeling sourness. Carbonation has good life to it. The feel is lovingly friendly to the flavors absorbed by the palate."

"Bought this one while in Brussels, directly from the brewery. It was bottled on November 10, 2011. The color is red or if you prefer, dark pink! Nice pink foamy head thrones on top of it. The aroma is typical of Cantillon. This is their signature aroma. Cherry are present in the nose but only mildly. Taste is intriguing. I would have expected more cherry than this. Not sugary as the other ones I tasted in the past. Tart but so easy to drink. This is what surprise me from this brewery. It is very tart but in a good way. I've had some vinegar gueuze or lambic but so far, from Cantillon, I only got excellent beers. Overall, a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a mild level of carbonation. It is fairly well done for the style and very much lives up to my expectations of a Cantillon offering. Very nice and tart with lots of funk. Wouldn't have it any other way. Solid. The 5% abv is perfectly integrated in this. The more I drink it, the more thirsty it makes me."

"Overall. Very nice sour. The cherries taste good, but could go for a little more of that action."

"O- A delicious beer, one of the few krieks you can find made with traditional methods and ingredients, the tartness and the sweet cherry flavors complement each other excellently, I'll definitely have to pick up another bottle at some point."

"500th review! 750 ml bottle into tulip, bottled Aug 28 2007. Pours fairly clear blood red color with a minimal thin red head with surprising retention. As I swirl it small bubbles slowly cascade to the top. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big sour and tart cherries, cider vinegar, wet hay, funk, oak, yeast spices, and big acidity. Fantastic aromas with great strength. Taste of big tart cherries, light cider vinegar, hay, barnyard funk, oak, and light yeast spices. Extremely tart cherry finish, that turns into a puckering sour acidity after the finish that lasts on the back of the tongue. Lingering notes of cherry, cider vinegar, oak, and light spiciness on the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel as I was expecting. High acidity limits the drinkability, but this is incredibly enjoyable to sip on. Alcohol is completely hidden as expected. Overall this is an outstanding Kriek lambic with a ton of great tart cherry flavor. If it had more carbonation it probably would have scored even higher."
"O. The first couple drinks of this beer blows you away with sour tartness. After a while you get adjusted and are able to appreciate some of the other finer nuances going on with it. Not my favorite style, but I can appreciate it for something different and realize that it is a well crafted beer."
""

"This is a perfect beer to me. I've had it a handful of times now and I've always thought this was perfect. Clearly it is."

"This beer pours a nice ruby red color with a huge white head (the bartenders had two pictures going allowing the foam to settle because the beer was pouring with way to much head) the smell is slightly funky more so on the earthy side than the horse blanket side , that is followed by cherries very tart cherries. Te flavor is very similar but the funk is pretty well covered up by the sourness and big tart cherry flavor. The mouthfeel is dry and Puckering with good carbonation. Overall this is a truly excellent kriek I like it more than 3F and hanssens"

"Poured blood red, with a nice pink head. Great retention, with some substantial density. Nose has some sour cherry, mild chlorophenols and some typical, but somewhat subdued Cantillon funk. Tastes of more sour cherries, akin to an amped up handful of Sour Patch kids. Some oak, really funky and complex. Sour as hell mouthfeel, extremely high pucker-inducing capabilities. Drying and cleaning mouthfeel, a pseudo-palate cleanser, borders on palate shredder. A great lambic, very tasty and appetizing. Gets me pumped to try the Lou Pepe Kriek at some point."
"Blood red colour, ring of pinkish-white head, some lace left as well. Smell is very tart, funky and yeasty, cherry and some balsamic notes as well, some notes of hay/earthy grass are there but quite subtle. Taste is of very tart cherries, incredibly sour and whacks you straight in the face, fruity, funky and yeasty, sour notes are felt for a while after swallowing as well. Med-high carbonation, puckering and fairly dry, medium-full body. This was quite a pleasure, really enjoyed this, needless to say I would revisit this as often as possible."

"It tastes and feels wonderful. Cherries n' funk. Not as tart as say their Rose de Gambinus. The flavor and tartness just work perfectly."
"My favorite Cantillon so far. I could drink this every week if it weren't for the high price tag. I probably won't be able to drink krieks (or hell, even most lambics) in the same way ever again!"
"Overall-- spectacular. Just awesome."
"Mouthfeel is bright and carbonated. Overall an amazing brew, I understand why it's so coveted. Based on factors other than smell this would get a solid A in my opinion, but that nose is FUNKY."
"love this. one of the best krieks i've had. highly drinkable"
"This my first time trying a Cantillon beer and I'm not disappointed. Just a wonderful well balanced beer."
"Like all great beers, balance is the key to this one. The flavors all work together and are unique, recognizable but exceptionally well blended. The smell stands out and I just love the lambic funk giving way to such a dry finish that makes you crave another sip."
"O: This is very very good. Balanced, tart, funky, easy drinking. I can understand why these are so hard to come by."
"This bottle is the 2005 vintage and courtesy of weirdbeer, thanks Joe! It pours a medium bodied cloudy cherry pie red in color with a slightly pink lacing around the glass. The nose is pure funk with barely any fruit at all. You can still tell its cherry but the fruit is no longer fresh and vibrant. The flavors too are pure sourness, funk, bacteria, and acidic. It strips the enamel off my teeth. It's very good and is one agressive drinker. It leaves your mouth desiring more and more cherry. This is a premium Kriek and a great beer to try."
" This is the freshest Cantillon Kriek I've had to date. All the Cantillon krieks and Rose de Gambrinus I've had, have been 2-6 years in bottle age and I much prefer this younger fresh versions. The fruit is much more prounced and the acidity is total in balance with the beer. Though it was only a 375ml It never became harsh on the stomach. I feel I coulda easily drank a 750ml of this fresh on my own. With or without food, amazing."
"I liked this beer very much. I prefer higher abv beers but this packs in the flavor nonetheless. One of the better lambics I've had."
"Cantillion Kriek pours a spot on solid cherry color. There's just a wispy crown of rose tinged foam that shows a little bit of staying power, but is a bit lacking in the lacing department. The nose is very interesting, it's a fairly even blend of earthy brett funk, notes of oak/wood, and a definite sour cherry aroma. The flavor dials up the sour, and the cherries are a little bit more prominent as well. It tastes like a soured beer with cherries, as opposed to what came across as just slightly tart cherry in the nose. The notes of earth and wood from the aroma carry through from the aroma and fill out the beer nicely. The mouthfeel feels pretty much identical to the Rose de Gambrinus I just had. The body is very dried out, and the carbonation is active, though stops a bit short of being truly bubbly. In general I prefer beers made with rasperries to ones with cherries, but I think I preferred Cantillon Kriek to Rose de Gambrinus, as I think it made much better use of its fruit."
"O: Great beer, would drink again."
"This beer to me epitomizes fruit over funk, and though I usually prefer lambics that emphasize the latter, I really enjoyed this. Not endlessly fascinating or especially complex, but a delicious beer nonetheless."
"(Please note that my point values are purely a best guess as I tried this beer a month ago. I do know that I enjoyed this beer - just not sure what points I would give it until I try it again.)"
"I've strayed from sours for so long. However, I couldn't resist ordering my first Cantillon when it was offered on tap here at The Wealth of Riches kickoff event at the Blue Dog in Chalfont. Pours a brilliant, vibrant, yet cloudy rose color with a minimal head. The nose is dominated by vinegar. Only the faintest cherry pushes through. The taste is sour, but seemingly only because of the vinegaresque qualities from the aforementioned nose. I had Raspberry Tart last night, and felt that it was both sweet and sour. This is just sour for the sake of being sour. But that's cool. I get it. Glad I tried it."
"O - The best kriek I have had so far. The aroma and taste is excellent, it just get to be a bit much at times. This is an extremely slow, but satisfying sipper. My stomach may have a hole in it now..."
"Awesome fruity and acetic tartness with good barnyard woven throughout. A more tart and fruity kriek than say Boon or Drie Fonteinen. Recommended if you can get a hold of it, it's really a shame that Cantillon is becoming rather hard to find in the states."
"O--This was a better-than-average lambic, but it wasn't the most earth-shattering beer I had over the weekend."
"O - This was my first lambic. I wanted to try the best so picked up a Cantillon. Very disappointing to be honest. Maybe I got a bad bottle, maybe lambics are just not for me but I dont get the attraction. An easy to drink, thirst quenching, refreshing drink but I just didnt get any of the complexity or full flavour that Ive read about."
"Overall: Another winning beer from Cantillon. Could do better if the cherry flavors were amped up just a bit, but this is an excellent fruit lambic and a nice change of pace from others which are either too fake or all too similar."
"Brilliant red with a cherry red highlight at the edges. Highly carbonated with a quickly fading pink head. The beer is imbued with sweet cherry flavor, but is much less complex in the funk and acidic qualities than the LP. It's a more simple citric tartness that tastes kind of like plum or grape skin. There only a little brett character in the finish that gives off a bit of a mineral bitterness."
"O - I love this beer and wish it was more available. I've only had it 3 times but it's never disappointed that's for sure. A beer and style that I wish I would of discovered and appreciated much sooner than I did as these are delicious."
"Celebrating the end of my summer class with this beer was a good decision. Calling ""buttpuckery"" pleasant... that remains to be seen."
"An absolute treat of a kriek--so glad I got to try this one!"
"Medium-bodied with great carbonation before fully warming towards room temperature. Leaves a lingering dryness on the palate. Incredible beer overall. Hopefully I can try more of Cantillon's offerings, especially the LP series – so solid!"
"This is one of the more drinkable Cantillons I've had but lacks the complexity of some of the others, like the Lou Pepe Kreik I had last week. Decent beer."
"O: Great. Best sour I've had yet."
"O - Overall, this is one of the best breweries in the world and they have yet to disappoint. Cheers!"
"Edit: The last 8 oz. or so (of the 750) were much more palatable after getting used to the sourness. However, I don't think a beer should require a 17 oz. introduction."
"Nice body and mouthfeel. Pretty silky and slightly syrupy but not too heavy."
"O - So worth the 45 bucks we paid. Defintely a treat for Cantillon fans. Nobody does it better."
"O-I'm blown away by this."
"O - Slightly disappointing. Worth finding, but not worth giving up too much for. Good brew in a good trade! Thank you!"
"Fairly light in body. The initial vigorous carbonation diminishes to a relatively flat brew. Another fine understated Cantillon offering. Nicely balanced and smooth."
"Tulip pour and a cranberry juice/ruby red grapefruit colored ale pours out with a bright white head. Pure awesome. The aroma has some tart cherries, raspberry, vinegar and some good old fashioned funk. Very tart cherry taste with a bitter mouth-puckering finish. Very dry. A definite sipper. This bottle was a little on the older side and I would like to try a fresher bottle and re-review."
"D: This beer blew my mind. Probably the most sour puckering beer I've ever had. Other krieks and lambics didn't prepare me for this. Absolutely must be sipped, but it's worth it if you can handle the intensity. Cellar as long as you want, as I'm sure it'll be good forever. I wish it had more carbonation to help moderate the taste, but otherwise this was a fantastic lambic."
"Lighter body, with a great amount of carbonation. Alcohol is a non-factor. An acquired taste for sure. A classic."
"O: Challenging, but so rewarding (sort of?). Glad I got to try this and overall most people who sampled it at our tasting enjoyed sips, but a full bottle would be out of the question."
"O: very nice. Like drinking a liquid cherry jolly rancher with an extra kick in the tart department."
"If you've tried Lindemans Kriek and are expecting the same thing out of Cantillon Kriek 100% Lambic, you're coming in with the wrong expectations. Both are tasty, but are so far away in terms of character that they might as well be on different planets. The Cantillon version is the truer, more authentic form of a traditional cherry lambic, though this is not for all palates."
"O- Solid brew from Cantillon, well balanced overall, easy drinkability, was able to spread the goodness with a friend who has never had a sour before, was not disappointed with this beer."
"The mouthfeel is appropriate for a beer of this age. It is a few steps away from being flat, but that's fine given all of the acidity. Like all Cantillon beers, it finishes so, so dry. Overall, this is the best Kriek that I've ever had (though there are notable ones that I have yet to try, namely a few from Drie Fontienen). Supremely drinkable despite its intense acidity."
"O: Wonderfully enjoyable from start to finish. A world classic."
"O: A little bit of a let down. Its good, but I was expecting a more powerful and complex flavor profile and maybe a bit more sourness."
"O - This has awesome drinkability. It goes down good, and the flavor is just awesome. Overall, I thought this was just an awesome beer. It is my first Cantillon, and it is unlike any sour that I've had so far. I highly recommend trying this."
"It is in your face with the first sip. This is an explosive sour kriek."
"O: Although the beer is very sour, it doesn’t have a funky element in the smell or taste that makes some beers in this style difficult to drink."
"On the taps of Rattle N Hum. Had right after the Lou Pepe Kriek, so this is somewhat biased and a bit by comparison. Ruby red, good carb even out of the decanter. Less cherry note than the Lou, but definitely still evident in the aroma, a lot more funk, though, definite barnyard, more sour and tart and barnyard. Tasty but seems a bit out of balance when compared to the Lou Pepe. Still, I can't complain too much. Delicioso.."
"Overall, one of the best krieks out there from one of the best lambic breweries in the world. Delicious sour cherry with a nice level of complexity. Highly recommended for the style."
"O- My new favorite lambic. Sour, fruity and dry. Everything you come to expect from a world class lambic and Cantillon."
"O - Very good."
"375ml, '09 vintage. Poured a bright red color with a pinkish head. Aroma is funky, with a nice sour cherry aroma. Lots of carbonation on the palate, along with loads of tart cherry and fine acidity. The finish is very dry with a sweet/sour complex going on. Not a whole lot of Cantillon funk on this one, but plenty of tart cherry. Very refreshing."
"O - This beer is quite delicious. Probably one of the top sour ales I've ever had."
"Well it's Cantillon so it scores high in my book. This might be the best fruit lambic they make."
"not much time on this bottle - brewed in November 2010. Pour shows tremendous head close to overflowing. Looks spectacular, bright vibrant pink color. smell is tart green apple and cherry. Very dry, sourness coming through with first sip. Brett is evident as always with these beers and it just works. I prefer the drie fonteinen kriek over this, but this is no slouch. Too bad we don't see this around much anymore, but it is always nice to revisit when you can. just a great beer."
"O: Not sure if I'm a sour fan, I figured this would be sweeter and more cherry flavored, like lindemann's kriek, but this one was pretty middle of the road for me. A bit too sour for my taste, and I'm having a hard time finding flavors other than cherry and sour."
"2005 vintage sampled in 2011 (6 years old). The cherries really faded out of this, forming a more sour, aciditic shell of its former self. Not to say it isn't good, but is definitely looses the cherry flavors that I love so much about this beer. I can understand why this one is recommended to drink fresh."
"Overall, I am really enjoying this beer. It is sour and a little funky, but it tastes great. I will definitely seek this out again."
"Mouthfeel, the slightest wood nuance is noticeable. Very dry finish to this. Sour cherry flavor is the best cherry flavor most often."
"Not quite as stellar as the Lou Pepe version, but some of that may be a function of age when bottled and when consumed. Still a world-class example of the style."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found each sip quite easy to taste. When one first approaches sour dry beers the ideas of sourness and astringency being pleasant seems a bit strange. However, I’ve found that when done right the sourness and tartness are similar to hop bitterness in that when controlled they can be very enjoyable (even as one is puckering up from the tartness). My overall impression is that this beer well deserves its good reputation and the praise it has received from others. I’ll be happy to have it again. I like it."
"**I updated and modified my review and overall score due to having this a few more times, I really feel like this deserves the updated score.**"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a bright red, mostly clear with plenty of carbonation. A very active pink head persists well. Pleasantly sour cherry aroma with funky undertones. The flavor is quite sour but still pleasantly so, due to the explosion of cherry. The cherry flavor blends nicely with strong funk/barnyard notes. Thinnish mouthfeel but nice and crisp on the finish; very clean tasting. Complexity, sourness and funk make this a classic kriek."
"Complex and surprisingly compelling."
"O: Fantastic beer. I will clean the shelf next time I see this one."
"Nice and round yet soft on the palate, Not overly bracing acidity but acidity and tartness definitely bring this to a great level of complexity. Tart cherry, light earthy in the middle with some barnyard on the end. Long finish sour and puckering. A little funky but again a very distinctive easy drinking lambic. A beer I'd love to drink on a daily basis if only I could find and afford that hobby."
"[I ended up getting another bottle after trying this and it was bottled in late 2010. The cherry flavor was much too potent and while it was very sour hadn't developed that kick-your-ass sourness this aged one had. I'll get a few more to age for a while. The aged one was far better.]"
"Overall this is easily one of the best examples of the style."
"O- A solid lambic from Cantillion and easy to drink. I was thinking that it would be more sour, but it is still good."
"impressive, and as my first introduction to Cantillon, I can understand why they have the reputation they do. I will definitely buy their more extreme brews for special occasions."
"O - I can't imagine a more drinkable Kriek, this one is right up my alley! Excellent."
"Really enjoy this one, I am going to have to grab it again when I am in the mood. Lots of fun here."
"D: While this was not my favorite Cantillon brew by a long shot, B-level efforts from this fantastic brewery is still better than A-grade stuff from many other breweries."
"The CPJ"
"The taste is the most sour thing I've ever sipped. Dry and unique... almost like chomping on a sour cherry warhead. The carbonation delivers the dry good wetland the mouthfeel that saps and then produces saliva in my mouth is crazy unique. Wow. The drinkability is a bit hampered by the over the top flavors, but I'm loving every bit of it. Wow."
"a wonderful kriek. i had this on tap and liked it a bit better but still great stuff. lots of cherry flavor."
" This is one of the more balanced cantillon products that I've ever had. Very tasty"
"M/D - Mouthfeel was biting but smoothed out quickly with great aftertaste and a slight sour burn. Extremely drinkable with such a great balance!"
"D-delcious and moderately drinkanle"
"Had this one last night, split with my girlfriend. It has an amazing aroma and appearance as it's a super carbonated dark red. But from the first taste, it's kind of petrifying. It's definitely the most tart beer I've ever had, and the sourness of it really brings out the intensity of the cherry. It's a really striking beer, and after my face unwrinkled from the first sip I probably laughed for a good minute. It's fun to drink, fun to share, and an awesome blend."
"Overall, a really solid, flavorful, crisp, and complex interpretation of the style. Everything is executed extremely well. Definitely a top notch sour I would get again. The cherries used in this really provide a nice contrast and range for the fruit. The sweet notes are incredibly lush and full, while it still contributes the necessary tart character. The fruit is still really there after a year on this as well. I'd be curious to see how this evolves over time as the fruit is my favorite compliment."
"The flavors are interesting, the beer is quite sour and is not easy to drink in high quantities. I do not suggest that those who are new to sours attempt to tackle a 750 ML bottle of this on their own, it's not s beginners sour."
"Cherries are somewhat obscured, I wonder if that's because it's a relatively new bottle (dated Jan 2010)? I do like the fact that what cherry flavor there is, is natural tasting rather than artificially sweet."
"I would have given this 1s across the board a few months ago, but this is a damn good sour."
"Before I begin this review, I would like to say this has been one of the absolutely most fantastic beers I've ever had. Pours an extremely bright cherry red with a half a finger head, though it quickly dissipates. When smelling it, it screams of cherry, cherry, cherry, and some more cherry. You can definitely smell the red fruits and the tartness. When tasting, god O' mighty this is soo tart. It almost makes your lips pucker. At the front of your palate, you get cherry, light fruits, and plain of TART. Once that goes away, you get the taste of an absolutely perfect Lambic. Cantillon has really done a number with this one (and with most of their other brews). It still has it's effervescence, and it's just the right amount. I could drink this all day if I could. It's extremely easy to drink and enjoy."
"Drinkability: This was my first Cantillon, and I very much enjoyed it. Right now I am learning more about Lambics and like the learning process."
"This one is growing on me a little. I am finding that I like more sweetness in this style, but even without, this one has complexity and a real high quality to it. This won't be for everyone, but will please people wanting sour."
"D: half point knocked off for the tartness, this is intense even for a sour"
"This is the original Kriek, very sour complex and refreshing. Taste just like the one I had as a sample at the brewery in Brussels about 3 years ago."
"had this on tap (along with rose de gambrinus) and it was so fantastic, I had to review it again. thought they may have poured me the wrong beer at first, because when it arrived, it was a glowing, pink/raspberry color. much lighter in color than i remember. hold it up to my nose, and... woah! awesome. bright cherry flavor on top of lemon and proper cobwebby, earthy, woody, dewwy sunny country farm hillside. just fantastic. maybe this is a young keg, because the fruit flavors are so bright in the taste, and the nutty, peppery-spice notes are more round than i am used to in the bottle. nevertheless, the taste is tart, acidic fruit up front. cherry is obvious, but if i didn't know better, i would have believed there were strawberries and red raspberries in there too. the base lambic shows it's face just a little in the middle and finish with the lemon, wood, cellar and earth notes. crazy good. silky medium body that coats the palate before being completely cleaned and wiped away by the healthy acidity. i could drink this whole keg myself. wow. do not pass this up if you are lucky enough to see it on tap."
"Overall- Great beer, with a nice depth of flavors, its not just a cherry bomb. Refreshing as well."
"Very drinkable, I think I ended up polishing at least 600 ml of this bottle to myself and I could have had much more. The alcohol is not really even there and I definitely felt full in a good way afterwards."
"D - Pretty good, love this beer and drinking it, but it's so sour you have to take it slow. Great stuff, would love to have it again, particularly with this many years on it."
"Age this a couple years but this is well worth owning, drinking, and cellaring."
"Again this stuff is seriously sour. Ive only ever had one brew more sour than this. It was a novelty extra sour lambic (the name of which escapes me) served at Alibi Room in Gastown, Vancouver. This makes my rating mouthfeel and drinkabilitly extremely difficult. On one hand it's a wonderful drinking experience simply for the taste and smell of it, but actually consuming the stuff in quantity is a bit of a chore. Its marketed as a ""thirst quencher"" and I can't really get on board with that... I wanted to rate both M and D higher but personally, average is about right."
"D: yes. I would like a Kriek drinking fountain. Refreshing, delicious."
"D: i really like sours, and could probably finish off the 750 myself."
"Too sour for perfect drinkability, but it's easy to finish a goblet."
"Very nice, one o the best. Good aging potential as well."
"d- This one scares me to drink alot because i am afraid I could get gut rot or something"
"The Kriek Lambic pours a rose color with good clarity. A nice pinkish very bubbly head that quickly fades. Cherries and grapes are all I am getting out of the nose. Pretty fresh smelling. Taste is fruity up front with a nice sour finish. With just under a year on this brew it is drinking really well. Mouthfeel is sour and tart. Drinkability is high for this lambic. Loving the cherry flavors."
"D- Quite sessionable and very good. The best kriek I ever tried."
"Cantillon kriek is one of the best krieks on the market. Tart, sour, mildly fumky, and dry. Wish I had some brie to let this beer play off of."
"D- At 5% abv this beer is extremely sessionable. Quite refreshing too, would be great on a warm summer day. Paired great with mussels in white wine/garlic and oil."
" The taste is intense and packed with cherry flavor which is both tart and has the cherry skin tannin  with cherry flesh sweetness and sour flavor from the yeast with smooth juicy lingering taste with sweetness in back and linger sour flavor in the dry finish. Overall I was so happy to have one of the best lambics available in Belgium but not as readily available near me. I consider this a treat to savor -world class in every way with acidity of fruit and wildness of yeast that was nice paired with quiche and salad at Moeder Lambic"
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable lambic that I am stocking up on any bottles I can find. Nice and sour."
"Drink- I'm not a fan of the style. I'll give this a fair rating on how I liked it but I'll have to try more of the style to see if I can find a good one."
"Superbly refreshing and drinkable. Seems like an excellent front porch sippin' summer session beer."
"Cantillon can't do anything wrong as far as I'm concerned. This one is a puckeringly sour kriek. Pours an almost artificial red-rose color with little head. Nose is tart, a bit of funk, and cherries, lots of cherries. This carries through in the flavor with a big sour smack up front, a wash of cherry flavor, and a funky finish. Great sour here, though I'm beginning to think that I like regular geuezes or non-fruit lambics more than fruit sours. The fruit seems to dull some of the sourness. Overall, great beer here."
"D: A little tasty if you're into the extreme sourness, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, while I don't mind sours now and again, this one just didn't appeal to me."
"D - Pretty good. I liked this one a lot. It was tart but still very complex. I have a bottle of this in the cellar, can't wait to see what that does with some age on it."
"This one is another solid brew form Cantillon."
"You get what you'd expect. It's a pretty good kriek."
"Admittedly, I have little experience with sours, but this beer honestly tastes much like the a couple of batches of homebrew I made that were wildly infected. Of course, this beer looks much better than my murky mess, and the addition of cherries adds a nice fruity sweetness to the wild, yeasty tartness. Still, the basic flavor and character is very similar to my botched smoked porter. As a result, I have to come to one of two conclusions: (1) Cantillon Kriek tastes only a little better than bad homebrew; or (2) I am capable of making world-class sours (albeit unintentionally). Because I enjoyed this beer (and for the sake of my ego), I'm going to assume it is the latter."
"drinkability: AWESOME!"
"drinkability: good"
"I've been eying this bottle for a while now, and just pulled the trigger on it. It pours a clear rosy magenta topped by a fluffy finger of pinkish foam. The nose comprises cherries (shocker), cobwebs, tart berries, and a touch of wet hay. The taste ups the ante in terms of both tartness and sourness. Those cherries have been eviscerated by brutal sour demons, unleashing a wave of vinegar-tasting blood and offal as they go. Must and cobwebs form pretty quickly on the grisly scene. Yikes. The body (of the beer, that is...gotta get things back on track here...) is light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky feel and finish. Overall, as my first ""true"" sour kriek, this thing really kicked my tongue outta bed and sent it off to basic. I may not be completely converted as yet, but I am really interested in trying more of these things. Bring it on!"
"A very refreshing and rewarding kriek, not the sweet lemonade feeling you can get from others."
"Of the sours I've tried the flavors are a little less sweet which I almost figured would have been reversed. It's not a bad thing, but maybe a bit more vinegary than other beers I have tried."
"Probably the best kriek I've ever had."
"D: This is a simply wonderful lambic, a truly classic example of the style."
"So, as far as entry level (real) lambics go, this one is pretty damn good. At the same price-point as Hanssen's Artisinal Oude Kriek however, this guy just doesn't stand up (or even hold a candle) in any category."
"Bottle. 2010 on the cork. Pours a nice ruby red color with a fluffy high carbonation white/pink head that quickly falls to a collar around the tulip glass. The aroma is a nice mixture between sweet cherry goodness, mild barnyard, medicinal, and sour/tart lemon. The taste is so nice. The cherries are there but not overly sweet but rather give a nice flavor to the otherwise tart/sourness of the beer. Some oak along with barnyard, the medicinal notes in the nose are pretty much nonexistant in the flavor to me. Light mouthfeel that finishes dryly."
"Pours a dark cherry red, with a pink foam. Strong smell of cherries on the nose, combined with the classic, almost stable-like smell that good lambics have. Some grassy notes as well. God, i love the beers from Cantillon. The taste is predictably dominated by the cherries, but the strong acidity and sourness that Cantillon is famous for is also present. In the mouth it's fuzzy and sparkling, and very dry. Really like the rush of saliva that follows the dryness of the beer. Quality beer from the arguably best maker of lambics in the world."
"D- I am in the midst of finishing off a 750 and I am having no problems. I would however prefer to share this with someone. As a huge fan Cantillons this is far from the best I have had, but it is still remarkably better than most of the fruit sour/wilds out on the market."
"An acquired taste, maybe, but no less a classic (both style and take). If you find it too much, let the first sip roll around in the mouth for awhile until you get accustomed to the tartness, then you can really enjoy what this fine beer has to offer."
"But onto my review. Sorry, I guarantee it wont be as funny as that one. Cork says bottled in 2010, so a relatively fresh bottle. Honestly, this could be the freshest bottle of Cantillon I've ever had. Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass in almost one pour. This beer is absolutely beautiful. Very possibly the most gorgeous glass of beer I've ever seen. This beer pours a dark crimson rose with a massive pink head that leaves just little lines of pink lacing down the sides of the glass. It really is a pretty beer. Top notch I'd say. The aroma is a mixture of different funks with sour pie cherries. Uric acid lends remnants of litter box. Slight horse blanket mixed with acetic acid. Hints of bright grapefruit and granny apple skins. Raw oak lends a splinter to the flavor profile. Underneath all that funk is just a subtle mixture of fleshy sweet Bing cherries and extremely sour pie cherries. The mouthfeel is refreshing bone dry but not thin. Overall, not the best Cantillon I've ever had but its definitely better then 80% of most sours I've had."
"Overall, completely dissatisfied with this lambic after hearing all the great things about it...it was worth to try it, but was not my cup of tea at all and now upset i spent the $18 on it...the St. Louis Frambouise was much much better"
"M: it drank decent due to the powerful sour punch but every sip is so delicious. I can never get enough of cantillon beers."
"Pours a hazy, rose/rust color. 1/6 inch head of an off-pink color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of citrus, slight tart malt, hint of sweet malt, earthiness, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Lambic - Fruit. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carboantion level. There is also a strong associated tartness. Tastes of citrus, earthiness, tart malt, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of grain. Overall, great aroma and body."
"Concluding thoughts: A bit formidable at first, but once the mouth adjusts, this hybrid-style beer should satisfy both lambic fans and Flemish Red fans alike. Just be prepared to pucker up. An instant, delicious cure for dry-mouth. Sip and savor."
"D: High. I use to be intolerant to wild and sour beers... I was wrong ;)"
"D - A refreshing alternative to your average beer, good if you're in the mood for something a little different but not too sweet."
"D- A very nice lambic that I could drink more of because it's not too sweet. Seems to be well balanced and refreshing, a nice change of pace beer."
"Overall: The only previous Cantillon Kriek I have had was an ’07 in 2011 and I have to agree with Jean, the beer is best within a year of bottling."
"This is a fine fruit lambic, prefer this to the Hanssen's Oude Kriek I recently had. Very sour, but delicious."
"D- My favourite lambic to date. I don't drink fruit lambics much because I dont like the sweetness that some have, but this was very well done. I would reccommend it."
"This is the beer I judge all other krieks from."
"95 Points."
"D-Pretty easy drinking for a sour but I can't discern the difference between this beer and a Flanders Red."
"M & D: Bubbly and awesome. Tickles my tongue and makes my head think of cherry flavored champagne. Very drink about."
"D - Low ABV, but such a strong flavored beer, don't think I would want to drink it all night."
"This half bottle was more than enough for me, as it was quite acidic. Sour opens up a whole new world to the beer drinker, and I'm digging what it has to offer."
"T- Sourness is quite low. Its just enough to go well with the tart cherries. There is a little bit of wet hay funk but also not too much of that either."
"As soon as the cork is popped, a potent palate crippling aroma of sour and funk hits the nose and my mouth immediately begins to involuntarily pucker. Color is a bloody orange/grapefruit color, fairly murky, yet clear against light. Head is a light pink, bubbly and light, that quickly fades to a medium thick cap with a splotchy film. The strong aroma is dominated by earthy and musty notes, no room for artificial sweetness, just some mild tart cherry. Otherwise barnyard, earth, funk, must, etc consume the aroma. Flavor begins with a touch of deceptive tart cherry fruitiness before deceptively and monotonically increasing in sour funk, by the finish turning your mouth inside out and leaving you salivating from the dryness. Mouthfeel is soft, lightly carbonated with an endlessly lasting sour finish. Ridiculously sour, but still with some interesting real fruit undertones and musty, funky earthiness. Not a beginner's lambic, or one to tackle a 750 alone, but uniquely hits the spot when you want to abuse your palate."
"If this was not 9 bills a glass I would be all over this, this young keg is much more drinkable than an old bottle and more to my liking"
"D- I am in awe of what again is a world class brew from a world class brewery. If it wasn't for the fact its about the buggiest thing out there I'd drink it all day."
"A very good cherry flavored lambic with true fruity character and cleanly controlled beer character throghout. This beer makes every sip more and more inviting- highly drinkable aside from sour intensity."
"My first Cantillon beer EVER! Pours a Beautiful red with a nice pink head. Once this beer was corked, I got SO MUCH cherry scent. I love cherries, and I got a TON! When the beer was held up to my nose, I still got a lot of sweetness followed by tons of funk and sour notes. The taste is surprisingly sour cherry (the cherry is so obvious). Followed by amazing sour flavors. The mouthfeel remains tart and crisp with amazing drinkability."
"Fresh v Aged? Two entirely different beers. The 2006 was possibly the most extreme sour beer I have ever had. The feel was thick and syrupy. The 2010 is light and lively with less sour and more fruit in the taste. Both are very good, but I gotta lean to the fresh version, at least for now..."
"To drinkability - very good, but make sure to have plenty of dark chocolate on hand to complement the sour cherry flavor."
"D-very nice complexity. Not a very evident cherry flavor. I would drink this again."
"Drinkability: Overall this ones pretty decent. The fruit has almost completely disappeared leaving a tart complex brew. I was expecting something over the top sour but got something fairly smooth. Overall nice brew."
"D: While the flavor is good, I am finding the intense sourness making this a bit one dimensional."
"D: While I do enjoy the sourness of this beer, it is not something I would tackle a whole 750 of by myself. That said, it's a Cantillon beer, so I'll still never turn it down."
"As for drinkability I probably wouldn't want to open more than one 750ml bottle in a sitting, but I would have gladly finished the entire bottle myself had I not been sharing it with my wife. I most certainly will be drinking this beer again."
"d - A very nice lambic. I thought it smelled great and had some nice sour cherry to the taste. Would try again."
"Drinkability:This beer is a great sour beer. It's just tart and sour and cherries, with no off flavors."
"Wow, this beer is a real onslaught to the senses. Pours a murky cherry with a fluffy pink head and nominal lacing. The nose here is incredible. Lots of funk. Huge horse blanket and barn floor qualities. The big cherry and tartness qualities come through but the funk is HUGE. The cherries play a much larger role on the palate with the tartness coming through on the front and lingering in the finish. The funk is definitely there but nowhere near as pronounced as on the nose. Split a bottle with a friend, which is probably just enough. The first glass is ridiculous."
"D: This frankly is fantastic beer. Delicious, incredible lactic acid and funk flavours, that just begs another sip to be taken. I went through this so fast, the acidity and fruit flavour were to die for. My brother opened up a bottle of Mersault at the same time, and while I love White Burgs and it was a good wine, the difference in overall complexity between the two was striking and clear in the Cantillon's favour for something that was half the price. A must try if it's available. About as perfect as a fruit lambic gets, I think the age is well apparent in the complexity of this beer."
"As high a quality of lambic beer that this is, I have to say I really didn't understand it. Not an enjoyable experience whatsoever. This was just oppressively sour and was a chore to get through. Instead of sour, fresh cherries, I just got...well, sour. Well made, but definitely not my thing. I might try it again in the future to see if a different batch works for me, but as for now, I'll have to count myself among those who just don't dig authentic lambics."
"D - This is a rough one. In small doses, this is an interesting and pretty tasty beer. The full bottle is ending up being a bit much. Gotta find something to counteract this acidity before I attempt to lay down for bed tonight."
"D - Not something I'd drink regularly but it is a very interesting beer and well worth a try."
"D - i was expecting to like this, not love it. i was wrong. so delicious fresh, I am psyched to go home and see how a bottle with some time on it is doing. a true work of art this this. cheers to Cantillon."
"Drinkability is very good right now...I think with more sourness it could change the whole landscape of this beer, so I'm curious to find an older bottle and compare."
"D: Enjoyable and not overly acidic, but the sourness really builds as it warms."
"D- About as good as a sour can be. Good mouth puckering sour but not as complex as I had hoped. Good beer nonetheless as I keep falling harder and harder for beers of this style, not to mention my wallet."
"P.S. After pounding on my mouth and esophagus for a while, it went to work on my stomach and gave me diarrhea."
"If you like kriek or sour beers, buy this one and revel in a masterpiece. Yes, I'm gushing, but this beer deserves it!"
"I noticed about half way through my first pour that Jean van Roy says to let it breath at room temp for 1/2 hour first. I definitely felt the second pour was better"
"D - Great lambic. Very available and not too pricey. Love this beer."
"Overall, this beer is insanity bottled but oh so good. The sourness is unrestrained but clean and still retains some fruitiness. Really refreshing beer."
"Enjoyed the beer and think it's one of the most sour beers I've drank."
"12 fl. oz. corked and capped bottle served at 52 degrees in my Allagash chalice. Bottled on 28 October 2008 indicated on the back label. Poured the color of pomegranate with a semi-hazy clarity. A half inch, loose, off-white head quickly dissipated into a skim - no lacing on this one. Clusters of bubbles adhered to the sides of the glass and sizzled and effervesced in solution. The nose screams tart - cork, choke cherries, a musty quality and a hint of citric acid. Taste consistent with nose; however the cherries are masked by the citrus acidity and expresses itself as salty in the mouth. Mouthfeel is light-medium, but closer to light, while a lively carbonation and a bone dry finish. It is so tart that it stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks while it's in the mouth, and keeps going after the swallow. I've had more gueuzes than lambics; however, I found this lambic to be much tarter than most gueuzes I've had the opportunity to try. Very nice and quite refreshing and enjoyable."
"Pleasant mouthfeel - very well carbonated, nothing too excessive, and leaves a lasting soury freshness in your mouth. Very easy to drink, some people might find the sourness to be a problem but I personally love. Great beer."
"D: Despite the powerful sourness, this is pretty easy to drink. Its almost difficult to take the time to slowly sip and savor each drop though."
"Given my anticipation, I did end up thinking that maybe it seemed a little too straightforward -- the tastes are painted with a bold brush, and some of the details kind of seem to get lost as a result. It's also quite expensive where I am (Tokyo). Nonetheless, a nice beer, and a great change from over-sweetened fruit beers."
"Consumed: 6/13/2010"
"Pinkish red light white head. The head is appropriartly thin. I smell funk, oak, hourse blanket and cheese, yup cheese. Cherry is a more apparent flavor the more this lambic warms. The first taste that hits you is more of a sensation of lactic acid followed by oak and then very very tart cherry flavor. The amount of wheat in the grist is clear when you drink this beer. Obviously not too much hop action. I love the mouthfeel of a lambic, or geuze for that matter. Dry! prickly and super squiky. This lambic would get a higher drinability score but it is just so bracingly sour. I love cantillon, this lambic would benefit from a long sit in my cellar, and I believe thats what another bottle or two will get."
"I have been entirely in to sours lately, so lets visit one of the classics. Cantillon Kriek pours out an awesome reddish pink color, with just a tiny amount of lacing for head. The nose is very strong on the cherry presence, with a lot of funk thrown in there as well. The nose is certainly sweeter than I was expecting, giving off some cherry pie like aromas. Once we hit the taste, the sour jumps in, but actually leaves quickly, with the cherry pie coming back for another appearance. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, juicy yet dry, and really very complex. Drinkability is stellar on this Lambic. Some have classified this as one of the most sour beers out there, but right now it is drinking on the tame side. Regardless, this is an absolutely marvelous brew that is a must for any Lambic/Wild beer fan. Cheers"
"Tasty, delicious, tart, dark berry fruits on the tongue. Soft carbonation slides evenly across the tongue like a lubed up armadillidiidae on ice. With tartness to boot. Very well balanced and just fun to drink."
"Very good. If only this was available in Southern California..and if only it wasn't so pricey, then I would drink it very often as one of my go-to beers, varying fresh and aged bottles."
"Cheers!"
"The beer pours a nice red color with a pink head. The aroma is heavy on the cherries with a slight hint of funk. The flavor is regular cherries, tart cherries, oak and a little bit of wildness/funk. Still, the fruit is the main attraction of the beer at this point. Medium-high carbonation and medium mouthfeel. This beer could use some more age on it but I wanted to give it a try as soon after bottling as possible to see how the cherries were when fresh. I have another bottle I am aging a couple of years and look forward to trying it again."
"took me quite awhile to finish the 12oz bottle. the musty tartness was a bit much, half a bottle wouldve been great. definatly an acquired taste and i would love to explore some more of what cantillon has to offer. i think any avid beer enthusiast should try this, as it is supposed to be the lambic of lambics, and is just truly a different kind of beer. the brewing methods are also very interesting to me."
"Color red cherry nose and blood, even if it is not really pronounced, which is discernible flavors and acid woodland. In the mouth it is sour and acid without being in abundance, as are the Cantillon. It feels as cherries with pits, but also hints of fermentation. The finish displays a woody dryness, without being in abundance, which emphasizes the presence of cherries. This lambic, without using an abundance of cherry taste or acidity of the drink remains extremely refreshing."
"Lovely."
"Overall an enjoyable beer, but not a style I particularly appreciate. That said, this was a definite improvement to the Vigneronne that was much too sour for my taste."
"D - While I thought this beer was great, I'm not sure if I would want to drink them all the time."
"Drinkability: A top notch Lambic. Nice flavor with plenty of sour-y goodness. My wife originally wanted to try this, but I do believe I'm enjoying this much more than see is. Definitely a beer I would love to have again, only maybe with a bit more age on it. Highly recommend."
"We sit in the sun, one week until the great day. a hundred bottles will be opened, and none will be as fine as this one, this day, this sunlight."
"Drinks pretty easy, but due to the tartness I'd be hard pressed to do more than bottle unless I paired it with some food or dessert. I suspect I would've liked this a little younger...Glad i got to try it. If you are a sour beer freak, you will probably enjoy this more than I did"
"Overall impression: Very complex and interesting, but half a bottle was plenty for me."
"2010: More lactic sourness than '09, but still a very balanced kriek. Outstanding cherry aroma."
"D- Incredibly drinkable. Sessionable. Veritably quaffable! Quite possibly the best Kriek lambic I have ever had!"
"And to mikey711 and Arbitrator for the 04 and the 08."
"D - This was delicious! One of the most sour beers I've tried yet. This is another one that makes you think about what you're drinking. I would definitely pick this beer up again."
"M - crisp, highly acidic and palate-cleansing. each sip left me wanting more. not a strong beer as far as ABV is concerned."
"D: Overall, a great beer. I highly recommend it. Anytime we open a Cantillon is a good time."
"My first lambic, spent the $19 on the 750ml just hoping for the best. I figured anything Cantillon is a good way to start. Bottle date is 10-21-08. Splitting it with my better half, poured into wine glasses. Looks and smells pretty much exactly how I thought it would. Pours a hazy red, definitely no light coming through this. A small pink fizzy head stays for a minute but pretty much completely disappears except for a small ring around the edge. Smell is funky, sour berry, oak/wood, chardonnay. Now for the taste. Hits me right off the bat with a sour blast. The cherry taste is great here, it tastes completely natural (as it should). Vinegar, definitely lots of tart and sour funk. Musty, oaky, acidic. Lemon, green apple. Chardonnay if you threw a few warheads in it. Leaves the palate as dry as the Sahara, definitely a sipper, yet refreshing. Very carbonated but the extreme sourness takes the focus off that. Alcohol taste is a joke, not a trace of it, you start to think you're drinking some crazy experimental fruit punch instead of a beer. Opens doors in my mind as to what a beer can actually be. Compare this to a Budweiser! It takes a bit but your body gets used to the sourness. This is still a mouth destroying beast though. Chalky finish. A very enjoyable challenge to drink, and so different from any other beers I've had. Drinkability suffers for the obvious reasons, sourness and price tag. 750ml by myself would be killer. I also can't help but remember Sam Adams Cranberry ""Lambic", and compare to this, and let out a little 'lol'."
"Very drinkable. Refreshing and tasty."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is somewhat limited due to the extreme tartness of the brew. Overall, I think this is a fine example of the style. Not my personal favorite, but something I would pick up again given I'm in the mood for something tart and sweet. Skal."
"I can only think of how I would have hated this if this had been my introduction to sour beer. As it stands, it's got great aromatics and flavor, but it's not a simple task to drink the whole 750, enjoyable though it may be. Too uncompromising for the uninitiated, I think you need to find another sourhead to split it with. I'm definitely going to drink it myself, but I might need some bicarb after to neutralize the acid a bit. Excellent beer, but gives no quarter whatsoever."
"D: Very nice drinkability; not overly complex, alcoholic, or sour. Nicely balanced and is one I think I'll use (alongside Duchesse) to get people into sours."
"I got this to try with the fiance,as she loves the linderman's lambics, and she did like this, but it was more tart then she expected,and while i prefer this alot more, her tastes lean to the sweeter linderman's.(this info provided to help out other BA's with their Ladies)"
"D - If price was not a big deal I would have again easily so nice a must try."
"A masochistic headfirst dive into beer appreciation, that's for sure. I told my girl not to expect the typical fruit beer sugar bomb - heh, I'm lucky she didn't bomb me over the head with it. I got to finish her share, at least, given that I more or less liked it, as a sort of palate cleanser, or degreaser, solvent, you get the idea. All kidding aside, this is a generally well-wrought kriek lambic, the sourness not for the timid."
"Cantillon has certainly brewed some world class beer. While Kriek Lambic is very good, I wouldn't characterize it as world class. At the end of the day, it's a little too vinegar-esque for me to award it that status. I can appreciate sour/tart beers, but I don't necessarily love all of them. This is one of those cases. I like it, but don't love it. Nonetheless, after nearly six years in the bottle, Kriek Lambic has held up well and is very good beer. I'd suggest cellaring a bottle just to see what you think. It will survive the test of time. Thanks, Dan."
"D- High. I really like this stuff, flavor, body, composition, everything is just wonderful. Highly recommended."
"An unforgettable beer experience, but by 'unforgettable' I think I mean I will be getting major restorative work done on my digestive system as a result, and will forever live with the pain. A whole bottle was unbearable, and half of this went down the drain. This beer is a lot of things, but drinkable absolutely is not one of them."
"I have to say, this was brutal."
"D - I originally gave this a 4.5, as it was not overly sour to taste or hard to drink. However, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling as if I had a hole burning in my stomach, so I had to dock it a half-point."
"Overall I'm beginning to learn that sours are all about nuance. The flavors aren't overly complex, it's just getting the levels just right that's key. This one hits the mark, well worth a shot."
"D: Once again Cantillon has done it. They have taken the true lambic style, and perfected it. It's easy to drink, and well worth the price."
"I thought this beer was very similar to the New Belgium Lips of Faith Kriek...which was another beer that was too sour for me."
"Notes: My first ""good"" Cantillon proved to be good. I still don't get the point of cork + crown. Every bottle I've opened from them has been seemingly tainted by the process. Whatever."
"Very low carbonation as the appearance indicated leads to a slippery mouthfeel that somewhat accentuates the funkiness and must of the flavor profile. A little more carbonation mightve lifted the acidity off my tongue. Intense beer and definitely not for the rookie beer drinker. More please!"
"On a side note, as I was drinking this beer a fruit fly landed in my drink and promptly died. I fished it out and continued drinking, thinking to myself, ""This is my preferred death."""
"D - A great regular sour, but perhaps a bit expensive - but then again it is an import, and a classic at that."
"Overall an excellent beer but not my favorite Cantillon. I would be interested in having another bottle but the high cost of these beers limits the number I purchase."
"Perhaps not as drinkable as some out there, a little more on the intense side, not as dry in the finish. Still, excellent example - beautiful depth in the flavor."
"Drinkability is fairly high even though it is so intense. Very refreshing. Dry finish."
"D: A good one to share but could finish it on my own if need be. Once again cantillon continues to prove that their beers when ages are very mellow and delicious"
"The sour level would probably keep most people from drinking too many of these in one sitting. But it is very drinkable and well within session-range, abv-wise."
"Fairly light feeling with good carbonation. The finish is really try with some acid still residing in the mouth and lips. I like the occasional sour-bomb, but the intensity really limits the drinkability."
"Poured from a bottle into a simple white wine glass at the brewery. Viscous looking rose with red hues and a healthy dark pink froth. Great carbonation streams. Healthy to aggressive aroma of fresh cherries and earth. Acid is immediately present and bites at the nostril hairs. Hits the palate with a distinctive sourness and tartness and goes immediately dry. Rich cherry flavors dominate along fresh lemon acidity, earth, and traces of chestnut. Mouthfeeel is bone dry, effervescent, and light-medium bodied. Drinkability is superb. Phenomenal in its simplicity, and outstanding example of the style."
"Over all, try it if you can. Traditional and authentic- Kriek Lambic at its purest"
"Really, there isn't too much to not like about this beer (unless you don't enjoy sours). I think it is fantastic. I have a feeling my 750 will take me awhile and be hard to finish, but I think it will be doable. Great beer."
"D- glad my wife and i split this one. too sour for such a large bottle. i had to struggle through what she couldnt finish. a feel heartburn coming on. other than that, its probably the best lambic ive had to date. check it out if youre a fan of the style. but if you are, youve probably had this one already."
"One year old bottle stored at home. Cloudy ruby red that reflects and absorbs light. Scant pinkish head evaporates in seconds. Aroma of sour cherries and lemon. Sour lip puckering cherry taste with musty dryness. Ages extremely well. A classic kriek, in a league of its own."
"D - This beer displays the classic, spectacular fruit aroma that is common among all cantillon beers. The earthy complexity of the fruit is perfectly balanced by the acidity and funk from the wild yeast. The flavor is not as lively as the aroma, though it is still quite enjoyable, but the acidity does get in the way of drinkability a bit. Like every Cantillon beer I have had, I find myself inhaling deeply to experience the complex fruit aroma again and again. Highly recommended (though I have to admit I still prefer the framboise)."
"I am planning on cellaring one of these for a couple of years, see how it goes. One very intriguing beer."
"Drinkability is limited by the strength of the acidity, but make no mistake, this is an excellent Oude Kriek!! I love the pucker, and the fruit is elegantly balanced."
"D: Because of the sourness it's not a beer that I will drink a lot. Still SO MUCH better than all this Krieks that are nothing more than beer with added cherry juice and artifial sweeteners."
"This is my first Kriek, athough not my first Lambic, and overall I'm impressed. I especially enjoyed the nose which was bold and robust with lots of cherry. An enjoyable once in awhile kind of beer."
"Flavor is quickly puckering. Fruity, which obviously comes from the cherries, but hard to place as cherries initially. Has a natural, spontaneous funk to it. Quite intense, a tiny sip fills the mouth with flavor, a moderate sized sip puckers the entire mouth. Relatively acidic. Finish is intensifies the sourness for a dry puckering finish. A very nice experience for fans of highly sour beer. Nice light body, medium carbonation could be spritizer in this bottle. Overall this is delicious, though somewhat simple, this is bursting with authentic and satisfyingly intense flavor. A beer to share for sure, but something I am eager to drink again."
"Something that is great to try to broaden your horizons, but not something I can drink all the time."
"Overall: great balanced flavor profile, although the smell of this one was a bit weird for what I am used to."
"D: Real enjoyable and this one grew on me throughout the experience, but it is again, a little too tart for my taste."
"Drinkability: This is growing on me but its drinkability is rather low, but worth a try."
"D = I love this, but it does not just flow right down the throat begging you to take the next drink."
"D: Crisp and refreshing. Perfect for a late summer afternoon"
"Excellent in every aspect."
"Drinkability: This is really sour even for a sour beer, especially in the aftertaste. This is one you sip with a puckered face. A great brew, I could have several slowly."
"D: This is not a training wheels lambic by any stretch of the imagination. This is hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw. And to be honest, it's not really up my alley. But if only the most authentic lambics will do for you, then have at it."
"This is a really unique drinking experience. A few months ago, while doing some last minute beer shopping at Green's before moving home from shopping, my girlfriend asked me why the bottles of Cantillon Kriek had the black sort of casing around the neck, while the Gueuze and Rose de Gambrinus didn't. I didn't have a clue, so I asked my buddy who works there. He didn't know, either, so he pulled the casing off, and, BOOM, 2004 corks. Next time I'm in there, I may buy however many they have left."
"drinkability is very good. the fruit is understated enough to work alongside the sour and funk instead of cover it up. very tasty and pleasant withhout ending up overly tart. cheers!"
"Enjoying this courtesy of Cbutova as his 50th review. Drank it mildly chilled and let it breathe for 30 minutes. Pours a very carbonated fizzy pinkish red with a 1 finger head that dissipates instantaneously. The lower half of the flute glass is clad in carbonated bubbles. Smell is very funky, tart sourness and just straight up funk. Big sour citrus taste, cherries; not for the weak at heart. Nice spiky carbonated mouthfeel. I'm not such a big fan of this much sour in one sitting but it is a nice refresher every once in a while."
"Vintage 2007 bottle, saved this bottle for review #50! Pours a beautiful red-pink with some fizzy head that lasts for about a second and recededs to a glass that looks more like wine than anything, carbonation rising on the sides of the glass looks great. Smells of funk, sourness, funk, sour fruits and more funk and sour fruits, seems like the typical kriek lambic smell, definitely suitable. The funk seems to die down after a bit and the fruits really shine through. Taste is HUGE sourness followed by a lot of sour fruit, the palate is overwhelmed by this, lemony sourness all the way here. Mouthfeel is thin, some carbonation, more like a wine and a sour tongue feeling dominating the mouth, very harsh but still follows the style. Drinkability is a bit low here because the sourness will definitely start to overwhelm and the palate will become fatigued."
"D: This is a very nice beer, the best Kriek I ever had. If you're not into this kind of beer you should probably skip this one - cause it is very much Lambic. Complex!!!"
"Forget Lindemans and BellVue, this stuff is as real as it gets. Cantillon is one of the only remaining true-to-tradition brewers of lambic beer in Belgium. You either like lambics or you don't, and if you do, this is not a beer to miss."
"For a style which by its very acidic nature is somewhat hard to drink this realy steps up and provides a beer with lots of other flavours going on to counteract it. A great refreshing beer."
"Pours light red, slightly cloudy, with a very thin layer of small bubbles. Nose is cherries, quite tart, with a strong Brett earthiness. Flavor is very tart, making me sweat at the temples; more of the Brett barnyard in the background. Feel has low carbonation and a beautiful tart aftertaste. The tartness detracts from the drinkability; sit down and enjoy this one over an hour: the flavor profile will change as it warms and oxidizes."
"*NB - I had a new/fresh bottle on 4/7/2011 and it tasted just like fresh raspberries, completely different beer that wasn't particularly sour. Lots of bottle variation; all great beers."
"This is the real deal Kriek Lambic. The appearance is a light pink almost wine looking. The smell is very strong and sweet. The taste is extremely sour and tart. This one sips like a sweet wine. My other lambic experience was with Lindemans, which now seems like cheap imitation, although still delicious"
"Overall: Great drinkability, more than just sour flavors including sweet berry, earthy flavors, and a nice musty spice. Great flavors and aroma, but a little watery at the end which takes away from the beer a bit."
"Very good tart lambic, I would like to have more of this in the future."
"Notes: I have not had hundreds of Krieks but this one is easily recognizable as the best of the ones that I have sampled. Mature, confident in its presentation, reflecting the true tartness of a Cherry."
"Big bottle. No pop from the cork. Pour was a darker cherry red than I expected. No head and no lacing. A very still looking beer. Not good signs for me. Wonderful aroma full of tart unsweetened chrerries. A slight woodiness. Taste is the same mixture of cherries, tart ones, and some woodiness which intensifies by the end of the bottle. No carbonation at all, very dry and puckering. Not the most sour beer I have ever tried though. The last third of the bottle is almost undrinkable. It is not the sourness. It is a woody / corky taste that is simply overpowering. I'm not taking away from the taste, but I am taking away from the drinkability. All in all, a good sour lambic, but the raspberry is their sour monster winner so far as I am concerned."
"D - very, very sour. I would say that this beer is only good in small quantities and after that, it just isn't good at all. That is why this rating is low."
"overall the most sour beer ive ever tried...i love it..."
"This is severe and extreme. A serious lambic, for those who like their lambics sour, raw and crazy. They mean the 100%; this is all lambic all the way. I love it - turn up the volume on these wild beers."
"Good to drink or sip actually. Carbonation and just the fact this brew is so damn sour make it nice to have a glass or maybe two of this but not anymore. I'm afraid it would give me heartburn!"
"Didn't pour with very much head, but in its defense it was put in a snifter and may have been a bit too cold. Very aromatic, with strong sour notes, green apple, dark fruit (specifically raisin), a bit of farm/earthyness. Extremely, overwhelmingly sour, but delicious. Other flavors are for the most part downed out, but include green apple and melon. Mouthfeel is about where I would expect the style with a decent body and slightly high carbonation. It's a bit too sweet and too strong to be very drinkable, but is delicious nonetheless."
"D= very good. I would have no problem drinking this all night long. The odor and appearance were a turn off but the beer was still great."
"Bottled on September 9th, 2008. Bright pinkish orange color with no head and no lacing, sitting lovely in a wine glass. Aroma is nicely funky, a bit of tartness, musty, maybe just a hint of cherry. Flavor is immensely tart, sour, vinous, and refreshing. A touch of vinegar and acidic wine flavors come through the dry middle. Nice, fresh tart cherry flavor brings up the rear. Mouth puckering and dry. Leaves a nice sweet and sour sugary taste on the lips. Not as much funk on the tongue as there is in the nose. Mellow carbonation, light to medium bodied. This is utterly delicious. To me, lambics are a bit of a turn off in the aroma department, but always come through in the flavor department. This is a fantastic lambic, much better than other kriek varieties out there. A sipper to be sure."
"I think it could be better with 1 or 2 % of extra alcohol."
"This Cantillon pours a fizzy, hazy, almost bright reddish-rose color (is atomic fireball a color?). The head is pink and very short-lived. Wonderful aroma, lots of sour cherries and barnyard funk. Horsey, sweaty, musty, sour, and fruit, all are present in the aroma. The taste is also very complex and interesting. Plenty of sourness, with a fairly high pucker-factor, but also a lot more balanced and approachable than other Cantillon's. There is a lot of cherry flavor in the beer, more than I expected. Fresh tasting with a fairly low carbonation. All in all, this one is a keeper."
"Also, it paired excellently with a cherry stilton cheese."
"drinkability is ok. i'm glad this is only a 375ml bottle, because although the alcohol is low i don't think i could handle much more of the acidity and sourness. still, i was surprised to find the taste leaned so far to the sour side without being overly vinegary, which does help the drinkability somewhat. if you like sourness, this is one i think you'll love."
"I drank this entire 750ml bottle, and I enjoyed it. However, it took me several hours because of the extreme tartness. Overall, another sour winner from Cantillon."
"Overall - A excellent kriek... probably not for everyone but definitely worth a try..."
"D - This is a pretty good lambic. The mouthfeel was a little odd, too puckering."
"I can see why Cantillon is so highly rated. This is a great Lambic. At $16 a bottle, though, it's for special occasions."
"Pours a light red color with a very small pink head that quickly disappears to just a ring of bubbles. The aroma consists of cherries and funky barnyard smell. Very sour flavor. It took five minutes for my lips to unpucker. Cherries with some vinegar and earthy flavors are detected before the tartness overwhelms the tastebuds. Light body and fizzy carbonation that seems appropriate for this beer. Seems to extreme on the sour scale but I enjoyed it and the cherry flavor. One bottle is enough for awhile. A tad expensive as well."
"I enjoyed it!"
"drinkability- wouldn't want to drink more than one bottle."
"Pours a thin red color with minor light red head and little red lace patches. A very tart smell of light fruits, mostly cherry (that's all I really smelled) and some oakiness. The cherry/fruit is there in bunches, but this medium-bodied brew is extremely tart, a little too tart. It goes down smooth but the tartness rubbed my tastebuds a little raw as it finishes very dry w/ tart and woody flavors. This is a beer designed to be sipped on as it complements a hearty meal; I did not have the pleasure to drink it over dinner so maybe my review is a little off."
"If you'll excuse me, I'll be looking for the enamel on my teeth."
"Overall: I wanted sour and that's what I got. I've just recently started getting into sours and this is one to pick up for sure. It's good and I think I would like it even more if my palate was a little more used to sours."
"D: This is fantastic. Full of character, very bold and very demanding. Fresh, yet rich and rustic. A masterpiece of brewing."
"Drinkability is quite good. Again, if not for the price, I'd have another in a heartbeat."
"A fantastic lambic, extremely sour but very smooth surprisingly. Didn't really detect any strong tannins or astrigent character like many lambics. Loved how subdued the cherry was, just enough fruitiness to match the sour. Fantastic."
"Rocky, tall, loud, cumulus dirty pink head. Impressive. Glowing, partially hazy, light cranberry red body. Intense brett tartness and funk on the nose. Acidic, with hints of lemon juice, tart cherries, and musty basement. Vaguely sweet cherry and cherry skin tannins up front, quickly pushed aside by a violently crescendo-ing burst of acidic tartness. Pucker up! Lemon juice base with hints of tart cherries. Undercurrent of sweaty sock wildness and old hay. Very dry, especially in the finish. Moderate-light body with a vibrant, lively mouthfeel. Refreshing and would be great as an apertif. For as sour as this is, it is quite drinkable."
"might be a little hard to find, so def check it out if you can"
"D: A great beer, though I certainly could not see myself having more than one of these back to back."
"Now that I have tasted this... I'm not certain I will try to dig my way out. I may just lie here and waste away next to this stream... the nectar of which is taking me closer and closer to paradise."
"Had a bottle at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Poured a beautiful almost clear red with a short pink head. The aroma had a subtle musk with a tart cherry note that also permeated the flavor. This beer tastes like a mellow-flavored, though no less tangy, lambic with a drop of tart cherry juice in every sip. The farmhouse elements are more subdued than usual and frankly I dont think this beer is as rich and tasty as a straight up oude geuze. But I will say, this is a gorgeous looking beer."
"This a really enjoyable sour kriek."
"Everyone should try!"
"Looking at these dates, I'm going to have to pop another one of these!"
"just a touch of acetic acid cuts through the lactic acid goodness. tartness adds up as i continue to sip. food is needed to cut this buildup but it plays well with food."
"The sourness is really a shock to the senses at first. I never really get past it, but I do appreciate the craft that went in to the making this. Not an everyday beer, but very interesting to try. Nothing else I have had so far is quite like it."
"Date consumed: 20 September 2008"
"Cork says this was bottled in 07. Poured into a goblet. Dark strawberry-guava color with some haze. Very little head. Aroma is cherry pits and lemon drupelets. Flavor is searingly tart with tons of citric acid. The unripe lemon onslaught is only barely tempered by a hint of black cherry tartness. Some lactic character too. This makes Drie Fonteinen seem like Lindemanns. My salivary glands can't keep up with the puckering dryness. Relatively drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, and bordering a vinegar sourness."
"(3.8/5)"
"D=absolutely would have again, though perhaps couldn't session because of the strong taste."
"Poured deep opaque red. Smelled distinctly of cherries. Initial taste is so sour it causes the lips to pucker. Strong notes of cherries and not much else. A really solid sour, if sours are your thing, definitely not a beer for those who aren't into the style."
"Nice mouth feel, really not a lot of carbonation, very nice drink ability."
"D- A slow sipper very harsh to start."
"Tart cherry flavor is almost puckering, but not quite. Seems a little mellow in comparison to some other Cantillon releases. Definitely gets the salivary glands working, it would be a perfect apertif. Certainly quaffable, i'm having a hard time taking sips instead of gulps here. The tart fruit has a brightness to it, that fades into a lightly dry oak aftertaste. Light carbonation, a little vinous or cider-like in body. Overall a standard Kriek to judge others by. The Lou Pepe variety has a little more complexity and depth, but this is a fine Lambic..."
"A little beer had soaked through the cork and was sitting between the cork and cap. 750ml bottle, '05 vintage. Served from the cellar @ 50°. Aroma is horsey, fruity, citrusy, acidic, and reminiscent of a dank cellar. Reddish color with copper hues and a smallish white head that stays just a short amount of time. The initial taste is horsey and acidic with light tart cherries and lemon zest followed by a rush of barnyard (wet wool horse blanket & leather saddle), lesser floral notes, a touch of red wine, and background notes of tart cherries. The acid is bracing, but not over the top."
"D - Very pleasant and entertaining. This beer really lets you know you're alive. Very nice but I think I like the Rosé De Gambrinus better."
"2007 Bottle bought at Sams in Chicago. I learned something from this beer, that only about 1/10 people are able to drink this type of beer, and drinking a 750 yourself is not easy. Pours a clear cherry red color with no head. The aroma is pure sourness. The taste was very acidic, almost a burning mouthfeel. After a while the cherries come through quite nice, some dryness in the finish. A very sour beer."
"Clearly an acquired taste. Not a personal favorite style. Not a brew to introduce the consumer to the style either. See Monk's Flemish Sour Red ale (I know, not a lambic, but sour nonetheless). I may revisit this once my pallette comes to appreciate the style more."
"This beer is the shizit. The complexity of the critters are world class, and of the quality I have found from VERY few breweries. God bless Cantillon."
"High drinkability for sure! Good stuff. Cantillon can do nothing wrong."
"Pretty good, but not as good as the Cantillon Gueuze. I had this at the Cantillon brewery in Anderlecht, in the Brussels suburbs."
"The cherries stand out without overshadowing other complexities. Powerful, yet drinkable, stuff regarding aroma and flavor. Very tart in an enjoyable (though puckering) way."
"Bottle-pours a realtively clear chierry red with no head or lacing. perhaps bottle has gone flat? Nose- vinegar, lemon, leather and faint whiff of cherries. Taste- quite acidic,, horse blanket and sour cherry. Earthy, woody, yet juicy and mouth puckering. Very refreshing and drinkable as all hell."
"The best kriek I've tried!"
"Bright cherry color with a somewhat lacking head. The has sour cherries, musky oak and barnyard funk. Very traditional flavor. A tart, funky lambic blended with faint and delicate cherries. Super complex and not overly sweet. The crisp body has a nice dry finish. Truly a masterpiece from cantillon."
"decently smooth, not thin. some acidic and tannic texture. mild carbonation for a bit of complexity."
"PS Nice blend on Valentine's Day with Rogue Chocolate Stout."
"The finish is still quite sour and puckering, but as mentioned it's very clean. This is a well-attenuated and very interesting kriek, and while the boldness and the price definitely put it out of everyday drinking range, it's always a nice little present to yourself."
"D - These traditional lambics are indeed in a beer world of their own. Not something I'd drink regularly but it is a very interesting beer and well worth a try."
"D - On the stronger tart, acedic acid side but very good."
"I think it's still light bodied but very close to medium, the carbonation is lightly but rightly done, and, being a fan of brews that travel into the land of sour, drinkability for me is in the upper stratosphere. This is one tasty and fabulous brew! Thanks again, Joe!!"
"As with the other Cantillons I have tried, this will not be everyones cup of tea. But I dig it...so complex."
"Overall: Cantillon is what it is, they make the best lambic beers in the world. Period. This is one of the best fruit beers that are in the world that will redefine you definition of fruit beer if you have not had it. Just outstanding"
"Try it by all means, but please don't claim it is a wonderful drink."
"Perhaps this is a good example of a traditionally brewed lambic, but it is just too much for me. Very expensive also, but it was worth the try. Shoot me for saying it, but I think I prefer Belle Vue Kriek!"
"An amazing lambic, and a must try for Kriek lovers."
"Overall, not good. I would definitely drink this fresh as the 2-3 years of aging didn't help this beer [actually, I'm pretty sure it hurt it a lot]."
"The nose is super sour, sharp, acidic with sharp lactic and lemony acidity with a dusty, musty, cherry skin character, quite nice. The palate opens very sour with an intense but clean lactic sourness, some lemon and sour cherry character. It's surprising how much fruit character persists after 14 years in a bottle. The cherry skin character is noticeable with a mild leathery note. Light in body, moderately tannic and lightly carbonated, this is solid stuff. 4/4/4.25"
"Not what I was expecting. I thought this would be a touch sweeter, and the cherry flavours more predominant, but it's like a dumb down guezue. Mild body, with really sour puckering flavours. Quite drinkable and refreshing, and very nice for some different to the norm."
"Another old vintage Cantillon I was fortunate enough to taste at a small beer gathering. Pours a hazy reddish color. The aroma is oak and cherries with a bit of sour funk. Very pleasant aroma for sure! The taste is sour with oak and cherries with a dry finish. Another great lambic from Cantillon, those guys who brew this stuff definitely know what they are doing, it is definitely an art form."
"I'm looking forward to trying some other Cantillon offerings. It's definitely a unique taste that I think probably requires some further experience to be really appreciated."
"Green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a slightly hazy bright red with a thin film of pink head. Smells fruity and acidic with hints of malt. Tastes initially sweet and fruity, slightly malty, and very sour. Pretty light in body, fairly aqueous, and light in carbonation. Takes a little getting used to, but after a few sips, brilliantly sour, subtly complex, and very enjoyable indeed. I'm hooked."
"D - Man, if you are going to drink a lambic, you got to do it right. This is the best Kriek I've had, not for everyone for sure, but my favorate."
"D_Very well done. I am getting more and more into the sours and this one delivers. The slight hint of fruit does make this more approachable as compared to the straight lambics and guezes. This doesn't mean that this is a sweet brew by any means. If you are looking for a sour funk, look no further."
"This is good but doesn't hurt my stomach like the previous bottle seemed to but that could be due to the difference in size. It has a good sourness and is like a sour pixie stick, cherries, musty, not a lot of funk. This is a good kriek but the lou pepe is much better."
"superb."
"I probably won't buy this beer again but would drink it if given to me."
"Overall, it was an interesting experience. A little too sour and unbalanced for my taste, but it was still very good nonetheless. I would definitely try this one again, just maybe an aged version. I like the Lou Pepe much better though overall."
"D: The taste drastically hurts the drinkability but if it was not for that I would say it would be better."
"750ml bottle, bottled last year. Bright, circus red with very little head. The smell is sour, sour sour. A little like dirty socks soaked in cherry juice. The taste is puckering at first, but it mellows a bit as you get used to it. It finishes with a nice warm sour cherry taste, but wow...that start. The mouthfeel is soft, buttery, silky and just terrific. The drinkability is just severly limited by the sourness. Definitely a beer to have on a full stomach. On an empty one, it is so sour I just can't push through. I'd have to say this is one I admire the artistry but the art just don't do it for me."
"This beer pours a pinkish red hue with good white head that dissipates pretty quickly. Nose is of sour tart cherries and lambic. Taste follows with tart cherry flavors and a very nice sour pucker. as it warms it gets easier to drink, and the cherry flavors come out a little more. Mouthfeel is nice, drinkability is very good for as sour as it is. I growing to like these sour beers more and more. This one was pretty delicious."
"D - An outstanding drink, for those who enjoy the bitter and sour taste that Cantillon does so well. This is not for those who like their lambics sweet."
"Excellent lambic...one of the better ones I've had during my recent sour beer kick. I'd put this just below the Oud Beersel Kriek if I had to rank them."
"750 ml corked and capped bottle, bottled on August 28, 2007. Served in a snifter, the beer pours purple/red with no head or lacing at all. Aroma is tart cherries, funk, and yeast. Taste is the same as the aroma, however the taste is stronger than is smells. It has a pretty good tart/sour cherry taste that lingers around for a while. Mouthfeel/body is medium with light carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink (well, if you like the sourness in the beer). I think this is a good overall beer. It's just my second Cantillon beer, and I haven't been disappointed in them yet. I can't wait to try more of their stuff."
"Bottle: sampled at the brewery in Brussels. Poured a pink colored beer with great carbonation and a good head. Aroma is a mix between the raspberry and the Cantillon yeast. Taste is a bit deceiving since it is too much acidic that it kills the rest of the flavours, the raspberry are buried under the acidic tones. I believe that some other lambic -fruit a better balanced then this one and offer a better refreshing taste."
"A great go-to lambic that's relatively inexpensive and accessable."
"Not overly impressed with this but still not bad, first Kriek ever tasted, would like to try another vintage of this and see if it gets better with any age, recommended for fans of sour ales, this was not so much of a lambic in my opinion"
"The only reason I decided to try this beer tonight was because I was able to score a 750 bottle of the Cantillon Kriek over the weekend at Erickson's for $10... Fantastic for sure."
"Poured a pinkish red with a half inch head. You cold smell the sourness and a bit of the cherry fruitiness. Taste was very good which was nice and refreshing with the cherry flavor coming through at the end. The cherry flavor is not overpowering at all. This is a better summertime beer but it still was very enjoyable."
"Pours a garnet hue with no head. Nose is a smooth and not overpowering musty. Flavor is slightly sour, but not a punch in the mouth. It will get much more sour if you let it warm significantly. Firm, yet mature, kriek attributes slide over your tongue. Feel is as expected. Little bubble on the tongue and a smooth overall character. Damn drinkable. Smooth and not as abrasive as other lambics might seem to be to a rookie. Worth the shot."
"This is a good one, I think this is one great beer but not for everyone."
"Pours barely any head and has a beautiful bright red color, it's fairly clear with a little haze to it. Little to no pink head. Cork says bottled in 2005. Smell is tart and sour with some light cherry flavor, pretty mellow smell for a lambic. Taste is sour and mellow, the only thing that gives me an idea that there are cherries would be tartness. Like a really sour cherry. The sour wild yeast is very mellow, but I guess I started out with some big sour lambics and got used to that. Mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with very little acidity. Overall I think this is pretty drinkable, if I was a well-off Belgian or east coast man I would drink this a lot."
"D: Not very drinkable at all, I didn't even finish the bottle. I guess that lambic is an acquired taste and I have yet to acquire it."
"Review added 10-27-2007, translated from french 1-31-2008."
"D: This is not a session beer, or even something I could do one a night of. But, it is a very special treat I love to enjoy every time I can get my hands on it."
"Inviting funky wild yeast aromas waft out of the bottle upon opening. Pours a deep ruby color with a small light pink head that disappears quickly. The aroma provokes my salivary glands to jump into 5th gear. Like all Cantillon's offerings, this beer is alive and vibrant. The aroma is deliciously funky with cherries, yeast and general barnyard mustiness. The first taste is expectedly extremely tart. Just an orgy of sour goodness and happy taste buds. In the aftertaste you really pick up the cherries, pits and all. This is very dry with little to no sweetness. With each sip, the tongue builds up a tolerance for the tartness and is more and more able to perceive all the subtle nuances of this fine lambic. Tough to describe, but just know that there is a lot of depth here. The cherry flavor is equally as well rounded as the sourness and they contribute greatly to one another. The carbonation is light on the tongue and provides a nice bite upon swallowing. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I'm sure I will enjoy many more of as long as it's available."
"this beer poured a deep red color with a fairly small short lived head. The smell was sweet and carried strong overtones of yeast and cherries. The flavor began almost unbearably sour however over the course of the bottle the flavor grew on me and this sourness diminished a lot. The flavor was full of cherries and cherry skins giving it a mildly bitter finish. also in the flavor were hints of apple and pear juice. Overall it was too sour for me to easily drink, however the flavor was very full and complex."
"Had a small bottle of the 2006 vintage this past weekend. Poured it into my Cantillon tulip glass I purchased at the brewery when I visited in spring 2007. Pours a pinkish red color with little-to-no carbonation. The taste was prickly to the point of being very sour. I don't remember this kriek being so powerful on the taste buds. But that's what I like about Cantillon: lambics that taste how they should. Instead of sweet, this taste tells you that you are drinking a lambic. I would not recommend this to the first time taster, but for a lambic lover, Cantillon makes the best on the market."
"D- This beer has a very bright tart cherry flavor with a good tartness. I find the flavor bright and bold but it has a nice flavor that is very drinkable. The cherries really come through with the wild yeast qualities, more than some kriek beers that have the wild flavors dominate the cherry notes."
"D: This is my first lambic, didnt expect it to be quite so sour, i could see me enjoying this in the height of summer tho, does become very refreshing as you get used to it, i enjoyed it overall but like i say, i think ill leave this one for the summer months."
"D: Excellent if you like intense lambics. The taste of course makes this an occasional beer, and one only drank in small quantities. Very good, and worth the price tag."
"pours a dark pink, not quite red. Into a snifter, little head due to pour. smelled pretty bad to be honest, sour infiltration of my nose. first taste is a shock to the senses, tingle in the back of my jaw. surprisingly smooth mouthfeel, i thought it would be more of a sting. overall drinkibility is ok, good to try. a true sour good tasting kriek lambic."
"Drinkability is good and small sips are the key. This is a delicate lambic best enjoyed at a relaxed pace."
"Really interesting stuff."
"D - what a wonderful summer drink. Hot weather be damned, I have this beer!"
"Pours a thinned red cherry color, alomost like a blush wine, with a thin just off-white head and only spotty lacing in the deep red wine glassware. The nose is exceedingly rich, pungeant and full of ripened cherries mingled with the tell-tale ""funk"" of this spontaneously fermented treat. The palate is nothing short of mouth-puckering, shivering goodness. The cherries burst forth in all of their tart glory here and never let up. This one is NOT one of those soda pop style lambics you can get anywhere ... this is the real deal and my face is contorting to prove it. The moutfeel is slightly biting, acidic and finishes quite dry. A wonderous journey into lambic excellence. Be warned, though ... this isn't a beer for everyone. Like sucking on lemons ...? You might be able to handle this beer. Terrific Belgian brew, froma terrific Belgian brewery!"
"Pours out a bright, vibrant rose with effervescent carbonation a thinnish pink head and pock marks of bubbles left hanging on the glass. Has a musky sour aroma that stands out above the cherries. The cherry aroma mixes in the back with a pungent astringency in the nostrils. Oddly enough, I find that the cherries come out more if you just waft in the aromas rather than stick your nose in the glass. Harsh acidity hits the sides of the tongue firstly which is then followed by huge cherry flavors with their tartness accentuated by the lambic base. Finishes dry but with a hint of sweetness as the acid dies down. The aftertaste leaves only the oak and cherries that hints at some sweetness. Mouthfeel is light, but could use a bit more carbonation for my tastes. Interesting, refreshing, and challenging."
"All and all, this reminded me of some of those sour kids candies Ive hd, where your mouth puckers up as you eat them, but for some reason, you come back for more. Im sure Ill be back for more of this in the future."
"Taste is very sour, like a batch of under-ripened raspberries or the tartiest cherry cobbler you could imagine. Mouthfeel is bitter/sour as well, and its dryness makes the tongue sweat. I have to say I was disappointed with this lambic. Its unbridled sour note limits its drinkability, and it's not exactly big on the cherries. Other, better kriek's are out there, and at ~$12 a bottle for cantillon, I'll be drinking them instead."
"Nicely carbonated for this style. Although its very sour, every drink screams for another. An absolutely delicious beer that should be enjoyed amongst friends or lovahs."
"Drinkability is good for the style, but you absolutely have to like sour beers to even finish the bottle."
"I'm amazed I found this at a grocery store."
"Pours a very murky red, cranberry/raspberry juice coloured, fizzy pink head forms, disappears very fast, leaves a few lace spots. Smell is very intense, sharp sour note, very vinegary, intense acidity, nice cherry, oaky, more insane fruity acidity, you can smell this acidity! Taste smacks me good, insane sourness, I thought I had sour beers before this. Oaky cherry, almost saltiness, I find a bit weak on the finish, very acidic, attacks the tongue. Insane. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-medium carbonation, very harsh, very enjoyable, neat experience. Good thing I have a few more Cantillons kicking around!"
"This was certainly an eye-opener. Really the first authentic, traditional lambic I've tried, too. I was a little concerned going in that I shouldn't be jumping into the deep end right away, so to speak, but I thought, what the hell. And thank goodness I did! I see what all these hardcore lambic lovers are talking about now. I almost felt like I was punishing myself by drinking this stuff, but I couldn't put it down! I think this is a style I could really get into. I can't recommend this beer highly enough."
"I am still trying to wrap my head around this style, and I consider myself a rookie in the world of lambics. The first time I tried this beer I hated it. The second time I liked it. And this time I loved it. Can't wait to try some other examples of the style."
"a good tasting beer, but drinkability takes a little bit of a hit because of it's sourness, and slight lack of complexity may not keep you interested. certainly a good beer though, and something i'd buy again."
"This is a very traditional lambic. It's not not refreshing (as the maker claims) nor is it something you would want to drink on a regular basis. However, it can serve as a nice aperitif, an accompaniment to salads or as a reduction in a variety of dishes."
"A very nice beer in the style. This one is a dessert beer unto itself. Truly not a lambic for the uninitiated. This one is not a beer to try and session, and best enjoyed in a smaller amount shared amongst friends."
"rugged on the tongue at first, and then expands into a smooth sweet nectar. this is what natural ingredients taste like."
"Drinkability: I am glad I only bought a 375 mL bottle, as I would most likely not be able to finish a full sized bottle alone. I really want to like this beer, and I think I need to get myself more used to the sheer tartness and review this one again."
"Cheers!"
"D - A superb treat, but not something you would drink multiple of in an evening."
"Funky with some barnyard aroma, tangy cherries, and a dusty finish make every drop of this gem pure pleasure. Authenticity is never in doubt and this is a must-have for any lover of sour beers."
"Musty, wet blanket, funky, woodsy, slight sour cherry, and raw beef? in the nose... complex and interesting. Very assertively sour up front (for me) pick out some spicy astringency, apple peals, and sour cherries in the flavor. Dry mouthfeel with lingering sourness, low carbonation, and acidity. Interesting beer, but lambics are still new to me so I need some warming up to them."
"Mouthfeel is medium and flat, almost like drinking juice instead of beer. Probably has more in common with a cherry wine than a cherry beer. Makes some people gag but I like it. I'm strange that way."
"This is a fantastic Kriek. Cantillon truly makes the benchmark for the style, so intense and enigmatic. A must try."
"Drinkability  This was the show-stopper of the night at the OBriens pre-Stone 10th Anniversary BA Party. Any fan of the style would die for a taste of this offering from Cantillon."
"D: Nope. I just can't get past the sourness. If sourness is what you like in a lambic, then this is certainly the beer for you. Personally, though, I'll take a Lindemann's any day of the week."
"If you can get past the sour aspect, I highly recommend this beer. Definately not for everyone, but it's a fun challange to aquire a taste for lambics, so go for it! Cheers!"
"I guess this is what Lambics are all about. Incredibly magnificent and marvelously complex."
"I tried this with some good chocolate brownies, which it balanced quite nicely. It would go well with any chocolate dessert, or a rich cheesecake. Maybe even a cherry sundae."
"Quite a treat! I'd been saving this in my fridge for the past 3 years, and presented it at the 2006 Dallas BA tasting. Unfortunately, it wasn't to everyone's taste and I ended up drinking most of the bottle myself. Hmm, or make that ""quite fortunately""."
"Finishes puckeringly, with a fading cherry wave, and prickly on the back of the throat."
"Overall: Another excellent lambic from Cantillon."
"Drinkability/notes: A striking example of the style, certainly a must to try. Many thanks to BA HardTarget for his generosity in sharing this treasure."
"bitingly tart acidity. light mouthfeel with a medium carbonation and a powerfully drying finish. flavor is more powerful than Cantillon's gueuze and sticks to your teeth. less cherry flavor that i expected, but it adds some nice tartness overall. powerful finish definitely overwhelms the other flavors, but it's a drinkable, extremely well-made brew."
"D - After the initial shock of the first mouthful it's very moreish and hard to put the glass down. I could handle 2 or 3 of these very well, but not something I would want to drink all day."
"It's not at all sweet or almondy like some kriek, prepare for a very sour experience."
"This is a review of the Kriek 100% lambic blended with cherries. It is a bright cherry red colored beer. Has an interesting vinegar/fruity smell to it. Makes me thirsty, but not for the faint of heart. Very pungent, fills my room with this great odor. The cherry flavor comes out sort of in the middle of the flavor profile. The first taste is an overwhelmingly sour pucker your face flavor. Finishes nice and sweet. Actually tastes a little like raspberry which makes me anticipate tasting the raspberry flavored one all the more. Sort of has a sour starburst like flavor profile, so if you don't like those, stay away. Medium body, a little syrupy to go with the very sweet flavor. Enough carbonation to feel it in my mouth, even though I don't see much in the glass. I could see regularly drinking this one. Very good."
"This beer was a joy ride for the senses that broadened my experience of lambics. Sadly, I tried this for the first time at a beer tasting I hosted and the uninitiated beer drinkers there thought this was horrible. I would have to admit that this beer is best saved for those with a decent knowledge of beer, or it may come across like tuna, sweet relish and many other less than favorable descriptions. This is not a beginner beer. Not being a beginner, I thought it was a trip well worth the ride."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Inspite of all the acidic tartness the beer still manages to be very drinkable and refreshing. The beer has a very flat light bodied consistancy."
"That said, beyond any doubt this style of lambic is a very acquired taste and few people without lambic/gueuze background will instantly love something this acidic."
"I dont think any normal person would have more than one of these at a sitting, considering the price ($6 per 12oz bottle), and the extreme characteristics. Glad I got to try it, and maybe I will have it again one day if I happen upon it."
"Definitelty one that I would recommend."
"I wasn't too big on this one. The red pink body with a top of girlie pink foam let you know what's coming. Smell is very acidic with small fractions of candied fruit and a funk of something rotten. The taste is utterly acid with the cherry only prevealent in the aftertaste. This really lives in the memory as the carbonation fizzs off my tongue it leaves the life of cherry and floral smells. A nice sipper but not something I would buy but I wouldn't mind helping to drink by splitting a bottle."
"The drinkability is good. Like any Lambic, it is not something I would ever want to drink fast or in excess, but is a pleasure to consume being what it is."
"Drinkability- Probably the most drinkable Cantillon beer I have had to date. Great flavors and a pleasure to drink."
"pale pink color with a very lightly pink head, good and thick. smell: whew! some cherries but mostly supertart sourness makes me drool. palate is very austere, tart, dry, most puckering thing ever. some fruit. very, very tart. very dry finish. I liked it, but it is definitely at the dry and mouth-puckering end of the spectrum."
"Overall Impression: Wow. Lemon juice intensity is about right, but much easier to drink. After the initial slap in the face, I got used to the FUNK it portrays and started to get it. First sip was shiver and retreat, but now, I want more. Big thanks to Stonecrusher for the kick in the sack. Now I know what its all about. Lindemans is a Lambic? HAHAHAHA"
"Interesting shade of red, looks like a hazy grape juice almost. Fizzy carbonation, with no head. Musty aroma full of horse blanket and sour cherries. Also a slight spiciness. Wonderfully funky flavor. Nice pucker from the sourness, with a nice cherry finish. This is very tart and dry. This is the most sour lambic I've had but really enjoyed it. I'll definitely be seeking more of this style out!"
" Taste is tart with slight cherry. Funks up as it wasrms up, and the cherry increases its presence as well. Hint of vanilla oak for a brief moment, this stuff coats my teeth. Mouthfeel is puckering with an everlasting sour finish. Drinkable for me, but I'll drink everything."
"Okay, this one just did not do anything for me. This was the first of three fruity beers I tried in a row, but my tastebuds were just shot ofter this one for a while. Not that there's anything wrong with this beer, but maybe I just don't like the style (Kriek's). Too bitter and tart with a aftertaste that just continues too long. I may grow into this style later, but just not one of my favorite lambics."
"The smell is very powerful and exclusively of cherry and wild yeast. The taste starts off very sour and leads to an overwhelming amount of cherry. The presence in the mouth is extremely sharp, while the stuff is quite drinkable for the amount of flavor it has."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" desert rose head above the clear cherry red brew. Head fades quickly down to a layer of bubbles, with minimal to average lacing, both of which are par for the style. Aroma is musky tart cherries. Taste is a bit of malt upfront, quickly shouted down by almost controlled sourness, with cherry tinges coming in later, and closes with extreme dryness on the palate. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are both good, and this was an enjoyable treat."
"Appearance is a beautiful ruby red with a small white head that instantly fades into a small ring around the glass. Smell is potently sour and funky. Not just a little mustiness here, but a full-fledged acidic bile smell. I love it. Taste is shockingly sour. Until your tastebuds adjust, all you taste is the face-disfiguring sourness, but then as it warms and you adjust (though it never loses its sharp sourness) you get some up front sweetness from the malt, and the cherry flavor really comes through. Almost tastes like cherries that have gone horribly bad at some point. This is possibly the most acidic drink I have ever had. Its dryness is beyond compare. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp, very quenching. Due to its overpowering flavor, this is a sipper, but I could down a whole 750 by myself. Lip smackingly good."
"Aroma is dominated by extremely sour cherries, with some fruit peel as well. Taste is very sour, with some bready flavors as well along with a boatload of fruit. Mouthfeel is ticklish with very fine carbonation. Finish is extremely dry and tart. Delicious beer from what might be my favorite non-US brewery."
"Overall, a great beer. Definately worth the money to pick this one up, especially if you are just experimenting with lambics."
"I think I'll blow through the few more bottles of this that I have and save the cellaring for the Broucsella."
"Slàinte! (but for God's sake, be careful!)"
"Compared to the fresh bottles I have tried I would have to say this is much better aged"
"This is a great, ballsy unsweetened lambic. As true to the style as you get"
"Deep red color, with very slight carbonation and no foam or lacing. Tart cherries in the nose with a touch of wine-like sourness and barn-yard must in the background. Flavor starts with the bitter cherries, develops acidic sharpness, and builds into rounded woodiness and lasting barn-yard funk. Not-quite still in the mouth. The slightly prickly carbonation and bitter dryness is quite quenching once you've gotten accustomed to the style."
"Taste: Excellent astringency, if I drink this too regularly my tongue will go inside-out. The rasp/cran really showed up in full force on the palate and in the dry aftertaste it left. Body was a little lighter than usual, but just as refreshing as ever."
"In teaching my roommates the wonders of non-Lindeman's lambics (not that there's anything wrong with that!) we picked up a bottle of the Kriek. Delightful stuff this, a luminescent ruby red with plenty of bubbles. Tart & funky nose with strong sour citric lemon juice notes. Cherries are more present in the dry aftertaste than anywhere else. Sour mega warhead funky barnyard takes the flavor. A lambic I always enjoy, but as I noted on draught, a bit sweet for me to have more than one really. Glad I'm sharing the bottle. Still a great offering from Cantillon."
"The taste however unimpressed me. it was great if you put it all apart: fruits, an ale sensation, a sour ending...but all combined turned into a strong medicinal sensation, sort of like trying children's cough medicine. I overlook that because I know with a bit more expertise I'm sure I'll understand this beer much better. whenever back in belgie I'll give it a second chance."
" I rated accordingly."
"Ruby or pomegranite red, cloudy, bare minimum lace but no head. Appearance would be higher if it managed some sort of head. Smells of cherry pie with a nice tartness even on the nose. Dry.... I think this is the first time I actually felt like moisture was being sucked out of my system by a liquid. Dry dry. It tastes like I remember organic cherries out in CA tasting at the beginning of last winter. It's sour to be sure but it's perfectly reasonable and not nearly as artificial as others (although I certainly have a sweets addiction). DRY. Wow... that is really dry. It's a sensation I haven't felt before and I really enjoy it. For some reason I feel like I'm at a cafe in Belgium and expect the cured meat and cheeses to be delivered now."
"Highly drinkable if you enjoy the style. What I particularly enjoy is that the lingering sour aftertastes nicely temper the rate at which you drink the beer, extending the enjoyment of the session."
"12 ounce bottle, foil covering the cap and cork. Bottled in 2002 on cork."
"I'm currently on a mini-quest to discover lambics... let's check this one out. Pours a very bright and vibrant ruby red grapefruity color, no head. Smell is of sour cherries, cherry pie, freshly squeezed lemmons, and a slight funky manure smell, though not as pronounced as in other lambics, such as the Cantillon Rose I had last night. I'm starting to get a taste for these. I've had framboise, gueuze, and now kriek, and I have to say that the gueuze is my favorite. I find the fruit to be a little intrusive and un-beery, though hints of it don't bother me. This is delicious though, and not as overpowering in terms of fruit taste. Nice sour bitter taste, really puckering, even for a true lambic. Sublte cherry flavor. Nice funk aftertaste as well. Very fresh and authentic, no artificial shit. Dry mouthfeel, which is great. I don't think the fruit lambics will ever be my style, though I really love the gueuze, but this is undeniably tasty, regardless."
"The flavor is different than anything I have ever tasted on this planet. It is a living barnyard stuffed into a 750 ml bottle. It has a acidic tartness throughout highlighted with lemon, vomit, hay, bitter herbs, faint bitter cherries, oak, mushrooms, and vinegar. As repulsive as that list is, it is delicious and impossible to stop sipping. A very new sensation. This is a very grown-up lambic, not for the same person who would enjoy a wine-cooler. Fantastic."
"Mouthfeel is light with very spritzy carbonation that explodes across the palate with each sip. Such a great depth of flavor, I love how every time I drink a Cantillon beer it's like a new experience. Wish it was easier to drink this more often!!"
"AWESOME & UNIQUE BEER! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"Drinkability: It's perfect. It's the perfect beer. I can't say I have the pleasure of drinking lots and lots of this, but it's not to say I couldn't. It's a lot like a Flanders Red in its sourness, but maybe that's just what a true lambic wants. I love this beer. I'm blubbering like a schoolgirl. It's that good. I need to purchase multiple bottles and cross my fingers that they're as good as this is fresh off the tap."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is great beer. One of the most unique beers I've ever had (I've said this alot lately). Tart, powerful, and brilliant. It's just so powerful, I don't think this would be a very drinkable beer. This review is from notes from my last session (about 4 hours ago) and I can still taste it! Wow."
"ClarkVV is helping to educate me on Lambics. I can smell the horse blanket from about 10 feet. Thecherry aroma stays in the background but it is still there. It pours a dusty reddish amber color with a pinkish head. Flavor goes from sour to barnyard back to sour with a tingling mouthfeel that helps to make up for the dryness. The barnyard fades away with every sip, and the tartness accentuates the cherry. Thanks Clark."
"An amazing, amazing beer. Anyone looking for a true-to-form, delight-to-drink lambic ought to try this at his or her earliest convenience."
"Initially I ordered a conservative two cases. Now I've requested four more."
"The beer pours a strawberry red with a tight pink head that fades quickly to and edge layer and then to nothing. Aroma is apparent at the pourt with very tart cherry sour and a little bit of general funkiness eminating from the bottle and my glass. I also get a bit of biscuity yeast mixed in. First sip reveals a thinner than expectd body and very mild carbonation. THe flavor is very tart and gives me a puckering effect on my mouth every sip. The sour cherries are prevelant and the beer finishes very dry like a rich red wine. QUite an interesting beer. I enjoy the sourness and tart flavors, but it makes it tougher to finish the bottle. Next time will have more than one person over to finish."
"*cork dated 2003"
"This one pours a reddest of red colors with a pink head that takes its time leaving. Brilliant color. The aroma is very sour with a certain funk about it. I'm told that is characteristic of the Cantillon, so I'll just accept it. Super sweet and tart cherries. The flavor is much the same. Very tart. Very cherry. Finish is a bit dry ... and sour. This really isn't one of my favorite styles, but this is a well made version."
"Taste? ...ooo, wee! yeah, the cherry's there...but the funk is in control here, this is a distinctive taste, not for everyone... hey, maybe not even for me, at least not every day...whoa, again, I say...big, fresh, cherry taste, but yeasty ...meaty...huge mouthfeel, never ever feels like getting off the couch...pretty damned delicious, but , oh, so unique....I put these words to electronic pen and paper, while 1/2 a bottle remains...fierce flavor, full, lush, impressive."
"This one pours a nice red color with a pink head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is fantastic. There is a nice sour tart in the nose, with a touch of cherries. I'm excited to taste this one. The flavor is sooo good. The tart and sour hits me the second I taste the beer. When I swallow it, the sourness goes strait down my throat. The flavor does not linger too long either. The aftertaste is all about the cherries. The feel is a light moderate, just where I would expect it, with a really nice carbonation of small bubbles. I could have easily had the whole bottle to myself, but I'm a good guy and I share. What a nice beer."
"Some reviewers say they could drink this all day long and my utmost respect is given to them. The power of this beer makes it difficult for me to want to down a large bottle of it which is why drinkability took such a hit. It is, however, a mesmerizing example of the highest art of brewing lambic."
"Bottle at Spuyten Duyvil. Muddy earthy ruby. Gentle off-white head, rapidly diminishing. Clean sour cherries aroma, very leafy, woody with huge lactic notes, yogurty and even soured milk alike. Totally pungent aroma with a nice restrained barn touch. Very puckering, heavily sour, straightforward. This is everything Im looking for in a traditional kriek. I would prefer it with standout characteristics though, more funk and mystery, unexplored territories etc. Now its extremely clean, direct, balanced, dry and astringent which means its an awesome beer and possibly one of cantillons best, better than the lou pepe to me anyway. Great texture, thin-medium body with very little carbonation feels perfectly right to carry the acidity. Terrific kriek."
"Raw sour power. Beautiful wine colour. Leaving it open as recommended for 30 minutes is a good idea, but how patient can you be? Musty barnyard and cherry aroma. A bit of carbonation. There's orange,cheese aftertaste. Astringent bone dry. Be forewarned about the tartness."

"EDIT: I recently got to try a bottle of this that was bottled in 1996, and OMFG, it was unbelieveable. It had soooo much of that funky aroma and flavor that I love so much. It makes me want to buy another of the recent bottles and lay it down for years and years. A really big thanks to Big Body Bill for sharing this one!"
"2003 on the cork. Pours a pinkish red wine color with a pink bubbly head. Cherries and a barnyard tartness evident in the aroma. Some sweaty, leathery notes, too. The taste is totally acrid and pungent with sour cherry. Really hits the sourness portion of the taste buds. There seems to be a real woodiness in the malt aspect, cherries aside. Astrigency left for a long time on the palate. Certainly gets more inviting as it warms and breathes for a bit as it suggests on the label. Great beer, but it's acidity cuts down on it's drinkability. Great beer from an outstanding brewery."
"Light bodied, very tart, dry. It goes good with salad."
"D&N: More of what I was expecting from a lambic. Nicely sour without being too over the top. Nicely done."
"Hazy dark rose appearance, feathery head that maintains a skim. No real lacing, just a collar. Great pungent aroma, slight fruit but tons of goat cheese (and even a little goat in its yeasty funkiness). Mouthfeel is soft as rain, monstously contradicted by flavor. Outstanding flavor, no trace of cherry soda but rather, a vinegary and mutating currant, allspice, and even choke cherry that peels the tongue and establishes that ""throw down"" Lambic astringency that Cantillon so often brings to the table. Its dryness asserts at the same time as your mouth puckers like a blow fish and the aftertaste is like a challenge to give it another whack. A Kriek done right and just a first rate entry from a master of the style."
"Notes: Refreshing, thirst quenching beer. First taste is a shock to your palate, but the sourness grows on me."
"this beer is sour, no souououoouououuoouour! Ordered for a late afternoon meditative sesssion, nad this one does the job. the color is a wonderful burgandy, ruby red. the smell reminds one of earthy fields in the late fall(or early spring). Very little head or lacing which may be standard for this beer, I do not know. The taste is one of country lanes, essences of pastoral lanes and cherrys grwoing wild in foreign lands. Musty almost hay aroma, tast and aftertaste. A beer for the discerning, sophisticated and/or beer afficaiando of thsi style. A challenging but enjoyable experience. A thesis type beer."
"Sampled 12/31/03"
"It pours a light red with a fanitly pink head that disspiates fairly quick. The aroma is musty with some horse blanket/barnyard and a light fruitiness. The body is light with some honey and cherry notes and some horse sweat and a vinousness. Of course it has a mouth puckering sourness. A great all around lambic that is very complex and satisfying from my favorite lambic brewer."
"This is my third Cantillon and I am not let down at all. My only complaint is the $13 price tag. I think I may try this as the acid in a salad dressing this summer."
"So this is what a truly authentic kriek lambic is all about. Wow! I've got to try other Cantillon offerings. This was a real treat. After missing yesterday's SoCal BA event at the Belgian fest at Lucky Baldwin's, I can find solace in this wondrous beer."
"So far, my favorite of the Cantillon line. The cherry mixes very nicely with the lambic tartness to make a well-married beer. Simply fantastic, certainly as a treat, and absolutely one I'd have again."
"Taste is hardly a word to be used here, and I can't think of a word thats more stronger then taste so I'll just say this is more of an experience. So...just as powerful as the smell would lead you to believe, the sourness is all over the place, quick and lively, lasting and stark. Strongly sour and tart the whole way through, the musky stuff isn't so much on the palate as it just lurks within letting other puckering acerbic things surge in. Souring crab apple, super strange aspects of flowers, grass, and dirt. There are smaller nuances of the cherry pulling in every direction but not directly on the palate, always popping in with some added ummff of tartness over the acidicness. Pulpy thick and souring acidic mouthfeel, heavily fizzed and textured in a pure cheek puckering tartness. Another Wowza is needed here, Uff-da! Wow! A whole nother level of sipping is employed with this stuff. As much as the label declares ""100% Lambic"" - they ain't kidding! I was hoping for more cherryness to be dominate but this is all about the love for the wicked."
"Appearance: Purple pink tone with an off pink tinted thin foaming head showing traces of carbonation lacing coats the sides fairly well. Aroma: Tart cherries funky barn house style here, woody with a musty sourness chilling about. Taste: Very yogurt like in nature similar yeast tone sour flow of spoiled tart cherry flavor, very acidic and lip puckering but this one isn't as shocking Rose de Gambrinus (Framboise). Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body not very carbonated at all, sticks and coats the palate rather well. Drinkability: Grows on you with each sip as the palate adjusts to the pure sourness, overall an artform that should be experienced by all serious beer drinkers newcomers beware."
"I've tried the kriek from one month old up to over a year old and I have to say that I really prefer the Cantillon fruit beers quite young. They seem to be at their prime between 4 and 8 months from bottling. The fruit character is still quite present and there is a delectable gentle carbonation by this point. Over a year old and you don't get much fruit as the lambic qualities take over more."
"Glowing ruby hue with a slight murk. Thin, soapy, but steadfast, strawberry cream colored head leaves wisps of lace. Overripe, juicy cherry with pungent, Penecillium like cheesy must hits the nose initially. Woody, damp cork and vinegar soaked sweatsock hints surface after a deliberation. Intense, yet inviting aromawise. In flavor, sharp acetic tartness coats the palate upfront. Rounded woodiness of an old oak bark like nature ensues, bringing both gentle tannins and subtle vanilla hints. Sweetness is only of trace, apple skin and restrained citric, lemon undertones. Meaty, leathery, enteric underbelly merges with ethereal wild yeast tones to lend a wet horse and saddle impression. ...But it is so good. Well attenuated, bone dry, and parching. Paradoxically thirst inducing and quenching like all top notch lambics. Softens considerably as it breathes, with balmy lactic notes emerging and carrying through the gentle cherry tinged buttermilk finish. A delicious, truly world class lambic. Seemingly more balanced than most. Unparalled in drinkability. I would easily consume at least a gallon of this tart, restorative elixir. Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the delivery!"
"Overall a great, true labmic. Sour and dry. Not my cup of tea, but definitely worth trying if you want to experience the lambic spectrum."
"This is far from an everyday brew and not too drinkable but it certainly kept you interested. This is my first Cantillon and probably my first ""traditional"" lambic. I feel like a whole new world has opened up in front of me but I'm not sure I want to be there just yet."
"Served in a nice little Cantillon glass, this pour was decidedly a medium cloudy red. I found the aroma to be of slightly musty cherries. Taste was slightly sour and slightly tart. Definitely not sweetened, but still not so sour or tart that it wasn't refreshing. Very nice beer that I would enjoy having again. pat"
"The Cantillon Kriek has a sweet cherry nose to it. Not as sour or hard as some of the other Cantillon offerings. This Kriek has a definite cherry skin taste to it, a tannic edge that carries through the finish. As expected from Cantillon this beer is not sweet at all, quite bone dry in fact."
"Drinkability: A superb kriek lambic. Excellent beer but not for everyday drinking."
"Notes: Six thumbs up."
"Deep scarlet color with a durable, bubbly pink head. Lacing is evident down the glass. Nose is truly Cantillon with unparalleled mustiness and eye-watering acidity. Cherries are dominant with additional oak and funky cheese aromas. The naive palate would be overwhelmed with what's to come in the flavor department. Tart, incredibly sour cherries accentuated with oak and a remarkable concentration of acidity set this apart from other fruit lambics. The lack of sugar addition make this authentic in the truly traditional sense. This beer's mouthpuckering ability is unsurpassed. Playfully prickly on the tongue, even at room temperature (the preferred serving temperature), with lingering acidity on the finish leaves the palate thirsting for more. Wonderfully refreshing like a glass of fresh squeezed lemonade on a hot summer day, this is one remarkable Kriek."
"Though the drink was complicated, the conclusion is simple: Impressive, thirst-inducing, and full of irrepressible character. A far cry from Lindeman's Kriek, this is in the very-tart category of cherry lambics."
"The cherry flavours come through in that tartness but provide a hint of sweetness without overpowering the woody, earthy flavours of the lambic that forms the base. Once again an example of how Cantillion's spontanious fermentation and use of fresh fruit gives us a beer so different from the Kriek's of say Timmerman or Linderman. Another of the best beers I have tasted..."
"Bottled 2001. A huge beer in taste and aroma, this version was an orangish looking liquid that pulled up a quickly gone head and laced from a small ring. The nose is big, having very sour notes and a hint of fruity overtones. The taste is huge - tart to an extreme with strong hints of dark cherry and lasting impressions from the lovely lasting flavors. This is another of the Cantillons made for sipping, not session drinking, and as others have noted it is an acquired taste, though I've never met one with which I'd rather be acquainted. This is beer with an exclamation point - be prepared to deal with it."
"Poured from a 375 ml green bottle, it's a nice-looking cross between cranberry and yellow. The head billowed upon pouring but didn't last long. The smell is very sour, with a pronounced citric smell and just a hint of the cherries. It seems to sort of bubble its way over the top of the front part of the tongue-leaving just a trace-until it hits the knockout punch at the back of the mouth. The entire mouth puckers just at the moment the sour cherry taste takes hold, leading to a rare and pleasant drinking experience. To further enhance the experience, it sticks to the lips allowing another dose of sour joy when licking the lips after drinking. It's not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's surprisingly drinkable considering its sourocity. (Yeah, I know it's not a word, but it seemed to work.)"
"F"
"Congratulations & Cheers on the 750 Rastaman, the extra beer in your Mug is well deserved; you are a true asset to BA.com!"
"A very enjoyable experience. That's what it is an experience."
"Note: Though I've tried a few lambics in the past, this is my first review, and so it ought to be taken with a grain of salt. Nice, lightly red, very hazy in appearance, with just a thin halo of lace on top. Very sharp, tart aroma. Taste is hugely tanic, very winey like cherry-skin more than, say, cherry-juice. By far the driest lambic I've ever had. Tasty, but very pucker-inducing. A good beer to lure your wine-loving friends with."
"First I will say this is very traditional and well made,but Iam not a fan of the lambic style I have found out.Poured great orange/reddish color with nice looking spritzy head that went quick.Smell had some cherrystone in it maybe a little vanilla?Taste about knocked me over the sourness was too much for me to handle,was expecting a little soureness but this was overpowering.Like I said well made just not a fan of the style."
"Pours a peach color with a small, fizzy head that dissipatesgreat nose of cherriesnot sweet cherries but cherries none the lessvery tart as it should belike biting into a lime or lemon..definitely a sipping beernot really my cup of teaerr..beer, but I can apprciate it for being true to formtart cherries.. a bit acidic in the mouthI have a tough time enjoying this the way some would but I am rating it high because I is very true to form (according to what Ive read)..If you want a true lambic you should try thisif you want a sweeter cherry flavored beer stay awaybecause you will pour this down the drain which would be a shame. Im rating it high because I think it deserves to be but personally its not my favorite style.."
"I can understand why this may not be everybody's ""cup of tea", especially novice beer drinkers, but I think I could acquire a taste for this. Problem is, it'd just be too damn expensive to do so. I'll stick with my Barleywines, Imperial Stouts and IPAs that are more affordable unless I have an opportunity to try other lambic styles form this brewery."
"There is something very mysterious about this beer. The taste, the bottle, the look and the smell. I am strangly drawn to it."
"A resplendent and nebulous cherry red on the pour, the head diminutive, the lace tenuous, with the nose tart and little else noticed. Sweet and sour start, top cadaverous, finish is quite tart, astringent, vinous, and alum dry aftertaste. Different, for sure, and something I will need to re-sample to determine my true feelings for this beer."
"Painfully traditional and so damn good...I need to get more of this. Hallelujah!"
"The finish is amazingly long, and quite dry. It just goes on and on, and on and on, gently echoing the acidic fruit for what seems like minutes. Quite a ride, and unlike most other things that inhabit the world of beer. A treasure."
"Pours a dark rasberry-like colour. The aroma of this Fruit Lambic beer is dominant by rasberry and cherry hints. There was cranberry flavour but i think the cherry flavour in this beer is dominant. Decent Fruit Lambic"
"Notes: Racy yet simple, withdrawn but traditional. This is true lambic all the way, no sweet syrups or sugars added  this is the real thing. I have had samples at the brewery and the trip that the bottles have made produced the same awesome effect without a flaw."
"More samples at the Cantillon brewery. Brewer told us the fruit from this years batch was excellent and you could actually taste a fresh cherry flavor. A little sweeter than the Gueze from the fruit and little less acidic. Read one of the reviews before mine that mentioned that it smelled off - kind of like vinegar? with some barnyard smells --- but that's the way it should be. Its definitely not like sweet cherry juice like the Lindemanns."
"Extremely off smelling aroma.  Don't know if this came from a bad keg or what, but something was definitely amiss.  Nose was warning me to abort before the first sip and I should have listened.  Cherry flavor was there, but overpowered by vinegary tartness to the point of puckering."
"Brilliant cranberry color.  Tart aroma, like cranberry mixed with sour cherries.  First sip is not as sour as expected.  Not at all dry, a citric flavor is active.  More cranberry than cherry.  Substantial body to this beer.  Little moutpucker in finish.  This unsweetened lambic beer does have some residual sweetness deep in it."
"very interesting to drink, stinky barnyard smell, quite sour and acidic, not too much fruit characteristic but the cherry flavour is there, bone dry aswell, which is how i like my lambics."
"When you say the word Lambic you can exchange the word Cantillon because Cantillon IS Lambic. You can not get more authentic lambic style beer from anyone. This Kriek is dry, fruity, fizzy, sour, foxy, horse blanket, and earthy. Lots of flavor layers and not for the Lindemen's drinkers. Comparing Lindeman's to Cantillon is like comparing Bert Grant's Imperial Stout to Harvey and Son's Imperial. It may say they are the same style but they are two very different beers."
