It pours brilliant brown tinted red with a very effervescent white foam cap that quickly settles down to about a ¼”. The raspberries dominate the palate and the balance of sweet and tart tends towards the sweet making it easy to drink but unremarkable. It is just a little too close to soda pop.","pat61","Feb 04, 2015"

I wouldn't necessarily go out and look for this again. A little too "candied" for my personal taste. I've had better, more "traditional" lambics, although Timmermans holds the distinction of the oldest lambic brewery in the world. For an offering that is so heavy on fruity sweetness, I think Lindemans is a safer bet, and there's also Cantillon, if you're a connoisseur that knows where to look. Positives are that it's refreshing and full of flavor while maintaining a light body. A nice relaxer after a day at work and mowing the lawn in the hot summer sun. Would maybe pair this with a chocolate dessert.","VinnyA","Jun 21, 2013"

The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, strawberry, cream, sugar, and subtle earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The fruit profile on this one is the start of the show as it should be for this style. This made this one very easy to drink and quite enjoyable.

2.88,-11.1,4,3.5,2.5,4,2,"definitely won't try this again. I prefer more authentic lambics. Lindemans is about the lowest quality i'll go with a lambic and this is way lower. Too damn sweet.","cetherid","Feb 13, 2011"
3.13,-3.4,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"D: The beer is easy to drink and the moderate amount of carbonation prevents the sweetness from feeling syrupy on the palate. I'm not sure if I would try this one again because there are fruit lambics that do not taste as one dimensional and overly sweet.","metter98","Feb 12, 2011"
3.67,13.3,3,3.5,4,2.5,4,"Drinkability: It seems almost as if you were drinking a soda, which can be attributed to the syrupy mouthfeel and apparent carbonation. The raspberry flavoring is strong, but not entirely overpowering.","beastfromtheeast","Feb 04, 2011"

3.12,-3.7,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Poured a clear cranberry in color with a medium sized light pink head that was mostly lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of course heavy with the scent of raspberry's, light bread malts and a sweet yeast. It tasted sweet a loaded with raspberry at first then moved to sweet-sour raspberry flavor at the end with the flavor only staying on the tastebuds a short time. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall a nice and refreshing Lambic.","KajII","Jan 08, 2011"
1.65,-49.1,4.5,2,1,2,1.5,"D: This is probably the sweetest "beer" that I've come across by a large margin. Not a traditional lambic by any stretch of the imagination and probably too sweet even to be called a fruit beer. If you like excessively sweet fruit soda, this is right up your alley, otherwise, avoid at all costs. My Cantillon glass almost feels tainted by this one.","SpeedwayJim","Dec 25, 2010"
3.18,-1.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Dark red body, pillowy pink head leaves a fair amount of lace. Raspberry scent, kind of sour. Taste is pretty much all raspberry, pretty sour. A bit of yeast note. Very sharp on the tongue, thin bodied and wet. Not really horrible, but not particularly complex. Kinda tastes like a fruit soda.","Tballz420","Dec 21, 2010"
3.95,21.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The taste is lightly tart and not over-the-top sweet. Has a nice biscuity base that is a nice departure from the norm for these types of beers. Raspberries are prominent, but not overbearing. I actually think this is a pretty damn good beer, but neither falls in the category of a Cantillon puckering sour nor the sweet, dessert beer lambics...kinda in the middle somewhere. Makes a delicious morning beverage and is soft on the palate. Not exactly "Belgium's Finest Lambic Beer" as the label claims, but I certainly am not regretting my purchase and look forward to the kriek version I have in the fridge. Merry Christmas everyone!","twiggamortis420","Nov 26, 2010"
3.63,12,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a reddish purple with translucent ruby highlights that had a thin head and left almost no lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma did have big raspberry notes that were jelly like with tart sweet notes. The taste was also dominated by the raspberries along with the jelly character and tart adidic accents; no funk to speak of. The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, and tart finish. It drank pretty good but was lacking the funky sour punch I expect from traditional lambic beers.","Gobzilla","Nov 14, 2010"
1.81,-44.1,3.5,2.5,1.5,1,1.5,"It tastes like raspberry Jell-O. Not very good, watery, crappy.","crossovert","Nov 02, 2010"

3.06,-5.6,4,3,3,3,3,"The beer pours a red color with a white head. The aroma is very strong and one dimensional. I get nothing but raspberry. The flavor is more of the same. The beer is very sweet and syrupy and heavy on the raspberry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This may be a traditional lambic, but it has nothing in common flavor or aroma-wise with the better versions of the style.","Mora2000","Oct 30, 2010"
2.16,-33.3,3.5,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,"Most Timmermans are fruit to a fault and sweet, this is neither and a very poor representation of a fruit beer.","jrallen34","Oct 11, 2010"

2.36,-27.2,3,2,2.5,3,2,"There is a time and a place for the Lindemans type fruit lambics, but this and the strawberry version is just bad. Way to much fake an artificial flavoring. Avoid.","champ103","Jun 20, 2010"
2.04,-37,3,1.5,2,2,2.5,"A nose with a powerful scent of raspberry suggesting the use of a syrup. It is safe obviously not on this one because the mouth is the same ilk, that is to say strong on the fruity and syrupy but without being saturated with sugar. The lambic is discreet, if not nonexistent, and the omnipresent scent of raspberry.","ThaCreep","Beers"

5,54.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Loved this lambic! And it is a lambic, so it's not supposed to taste like a traditional beer. Beautiful color and nice white head that lasted a while. Perfect balance of fizziness and smoothness. Raspberry flavor and smell were fresh, not artificial, like many lambics. Very nice tartness to break up the sweetness. Clean finish. Could drink this one all night.","BourbonStreet","Jun 21, 2009"
1.85,-42.9,2.5,2.5,1.5,1,2,"It appeared much like a wheat beer overloaded with raspberry juice might look... like soda pop with a bright fizzy head that after a few minutes reduced to a thin lace. The aroma was very very sweet raspberry and had some artificial characteristics... almost medicinal. The taste was worse, like raspberry/cherry cough syrup with a very cloying mouthfeel, low carbonation and even hard to swallow. It made my tongue feel funny and slick and made the other things I ate or drank taste differently as well. A poor showing that should never be called a lambic.","dbalsock","May 18, 2009"
3.47,7.1,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A very drinkable Belgian fruit beer, refreshing, and a nice balance between the tartness of a true lambic and the sickly sweetness of a beer pummelled with fruit syrup. It does perhaps err on the side of sweetness, and it is quite effeminate, but it's undeniably drinkable. I've had far more sickly fruit beers.","lacqueredmouse","Apr 07, 2009"
2.32,-28.4,4,2,2,3,2.5,"D: If I would be in the mood for a sweet soda and looking for a substitute, I'd definitely go for this one, but as a beer it falls really short. It's to sweet, overly simplistic and quite boring after a while. It's not that it tastes awful or anything, it's just not a good beer. A poor version of the fruit lambic.","ricke","Apr 04, 2009"
3.54,9.3,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This is pleasantly drinkable, but it's not overwhelmingly good, and to be perfectly, brutally honest, I prefer things that taste like beer. It's just a quirk of mine.","laituegonflable","Sep 28, 2008"
3.15,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Quite a fizzy beer but light on the mouth. In all honesty it didn't taste like beer at all. More of a girly beer this one. I don't mind it and could quite easily drink it but its missing a vital part that is beer.","madvoice","Nov 02, 2005"
1.75,-46,2,2,1.5,1.5,2,"Overall: I think that my senses were caught unaware and I could only feel the raspberries all over it (aroma, taste and finish). It could be refreshing if not for the huge amount of sugar. In short, a raspberry soft drink. First and last.","AlexLMS","Oct 29, 2005"
3.79,17,4,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Very interesting results here. Reddish, pinkish, purplish color, transluscent, with little or no head. Smells unpleasant. Weird musty metallic smell is very unappetizing. Tastes very yummy though; good taste kills the smell. Sweet in a raspberry cream sort of way. Raspberries and vanilla. Sweet but more like real fruit than a lot of them. Nice spritz too. Not very tart.","texashammer","Jul 21, 2005"

2.56,-21,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Notes: Their claim of "Genuine Lambic matured in oak barrels and brewed in the Brussels Region" just doesn't seem to work. Its missing the depth and complexity of Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus, very one dimensional, and the raspberries are just overpower. I assume that this is just another "Framboise Lambic" tailored to the general public.","dauss","Jun 30, 2004"

1.58,-51.2,2,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"Can: Poured a bright pink beer with almost no head. Aroma of flavoured raspberry isnt very enticing. Taste is quite a letdown with some artificial flavour of raspberry covering everything and no tart, sourness or acidity noticeable. This tastes more like a juicy soft drink then beer. There is no way Im going to try something else from those guys unless it is highly rated and praised.","Phyl21ca","Beers"
4.53,39.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bought and drank this one in Barcelona, Spain. Clear, pink, forming a foamy, light pink head with excellent retention and lacing. Carbonation is strong. Mouthfeel is spritzy with a light body. Perfumy aroma of tart raspberries and mildly dusty basement. No discernable hops or other typical fermentation characteristics. Taste is absolutely delicious with tart, sour raspberries, a dry acidity, and a pleasantly dry finish. Hops and malt are delicate and balance the overwhelming raspberries. All the ingredients are in perfect harmony. An overwhelmingly excellent brew.","Mitchster","0"
