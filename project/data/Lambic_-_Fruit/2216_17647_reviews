"O: Four and a half years old has done this well. Not as tart or funky as I expected, but very woody with an interesting floral honey sweetness. Very delicious."
"OVERALL: Excellent stuff. This one has softened out really nicely and the flavors work great as a whole. The slight touch of acidity is well measured as well. Lots of character and we all really enjoyed drinking this one. Thanks again for hanging out man!"
"It's no Cantillion kriek and doesn't deserve to he mention in the same breath as far as I'm conserned.  Not enough cherry,..."

"Amazingly clean with subtle funk, cherry, lightly sour, light body, mild carb with almost no pop when the cork came out, but nicely effervescent when swished.  Again, it's a shame I didn't get both dusty bottles off the shelf.  I would love to have this again, maybe with a few less people.  Everyone absolutely loved it, even the ""i don't really like sours"" guy at the share."

"Poured from a 750 ml bottle at the Memphis Taproom while visiting Philadelphia earlier this year. Maybe I got a bum bottle or my tongue was off that night, but compared to 3F's Intense Red Kriek and Oude Kriek, which I love, I found this one overpoweringly and one-dimensionally tart, lacking the bright, distinct fruit character I was hoping for. Still a wonderful sour all things considered, but more assaultive and less complex than the other cherry 3Fs I've had."

"O-What a great beer. It sounds stupid, but the smell and flavor are so simple and clean that the beer almost becomes more complex as I try to locate all the little subtle aromas and nuances that make this beer taste so good. Unlike some true Belgian lambics, I found this beer to be approachable, as well, i.e., not hugely sour or funky or hard to appreciate. The mouthfeel is also nearly perfect for the style."

"Pours a nice reddish black beer. Has very little bubbles, yet it is carbonated. Smell is of berries, cherries, etc. Taste is very tart, vinegary. It is not a thick beer, it is medium bodied. Taste remains in your mouth, as well as aroma."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. State of art Lambic beer"
""
""
""
""
"O: Phenomenal flavors and highly drinkable. The cherry is light but still noticeable, and the light to moderate tartness makes this highly drinkable and a good pairing with food. If only this were widely available, I could see drinking this all summer long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Lighter medium. Good carbonation levels."
"Light to medium bodied with low carbonation. There is a tart cherry aftertaste. Finishes dry. A very well made sour. Too bad Shelton Brothers pulled out of Minnesota. I don't know when or if I will get a chance to pick up another bottle."

"Flavor: As usual for style, this tastes much better than it smells, and it is much fruitier. Cherries, raspberries, and vague soft fruits in a moderately tart mix. Fairly intense, as promised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Outstanding!"
""

"Overall- very interesting tart cherry flavour, much more organic and tart than that of Intense Red Kriek. Quite sour and interesting. Glad I saved this one for a year after my Belgium trip."

"Verdict: A really fantastic kriek from Drie Fronteinen, one of their better fruited beers for sure. It's jammy, pie like, and nice and delicate with nice brightness. It's right up there with some of the better fruited sours, perhaps it could use some perk in the body to really take this to the next level."

"750mL. Like the normal 3F Oude Kriek, this suffers from insane band-aid phenols in the nose that separates these from being Cantillon LP Kriek- the best in style. The pour is gorgeous- inky hazy purple, pink foam that settles quickly with acid cut. But the aroma kills the experience. Cherry pie tries to peek through huge band-aid and plastic. The taste is salty, sharp, but medicinal with sucrets and some numbing character. Overall, this is one of those scroll past expensive lambics and probably the worst in show for Drie Fonteinen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a little more tart and cherry forward than the regular 3F kriek, but not much. A very good kriek with a very good base of sour cherries."
""
""
"The label was molded and eroding - the beer was deep garnet and as tart as advertised. This kriek uses tarter cherries than the Oude Kriek which was pretty transparent. I preferred the 7-year old Oude Kriek and its decadent finish, but this was a nice treat as well. Tart, notes of balsamic, enamel decaying bite."

"O - intense, dry cherry sour. it's like eating a handful of fresh, sour cherries while wearing a brand new, high quality leather catsuit, only better. Cascade Kriek is more complex and tastier than this, but this is quite good, if you like a super tart cherry beer."

"apparently one of the harder to find beers from these guys, and it is a real beauty. this is the 2010 vintage. it pours a cloudy pale red color, like a strawberry frosted donut, with some suspended yeast and only a small white head that settles quickly. the nose is the classic kriek smell, tart cherries, sour yeasty notes, and some mild residual sugar. the flavor is surprisingly not sweet, and it finishes dryer, which I really like in this kriek as opposed to others. the cherry flavor is very authentic and up front, but it doesn't dominate the funky yeast lambic essentials. in other words, its in wonderful balance. the finish is super sour, more so than I remember in any other kriek ive had, this one zaps all the moisture right out of my mouth. better carbonation than you gather from the appearance, and a light enough body, with hardly any sugar left over when you swallow. its really got an extraordinary mouthfeel. this is by far the best kriek ive had, its quality and tradition shine through. still, this is a style of beer that is hard for me to drink too much of, so I was fortunate enough to have a lot of friends, old and new on hand to share this with."

"Wonderfully drinkable. Refreshing, light, I could drink this forever. Probably my favorite kriek I've had so far, on par with the '05 LP kriek."
"Pours a clear dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with cherry and cheesy aromas. Taste is much the same with some funky cherry flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some nice funky and cherry aromas and flavors."
"O- 5/10 sourness. Very mellow sour that is insanely drinkable with the 7 years on it. Nice cherry flavors and aromas. This is what red wine should taste like!"

"Overall: One of the most tart/sour lambics I've ever had. This is a really good kriek and worth a try for anyone that's a fan of the style. Definitely not a starter sour/lambic though."

"O-a delicious kriek lambic, convinced this is the only style of cherry beer that I like"
"Overall: No sweetness in this Kriek and not for the inexperienced; quite an extraordinary beer"
""
""
""
"O: beautiful beer, sour and wonderful in all ways. After tasting it, the sourness overwhelms the cherry."
""
"Overall: This beer was great, and had a great tart cherry taste. Would have liked a little more funk, but I'm glad I got the full frontal cherry assault out of this."
"This is very dry and very tart with some nice cherry flavor. It's a solid sipper, and clearly a different approach than some more fruit-forward fruit lambics. I'm glad I had a chance to try this."
"Overall: One of the more tart beers I've encountered. Minimal fruit influence."
""
"T: Loads of tart and unripe cherries and cherry pit. Lemon, some barnyard funk and a good touch of oak. Some tannins evident on the finish."

" An underwhelming kreik lacking any fruit punch."
""
""
"Overall: This is the first time I've gotten a full pour of this beer and it didn't disappoint. Jowl tinglingly sour and quite refreshing. A classic fruit lambic."
""
"Overall: It would be nice if I hated this, because it's pricey and something I can't justify buying often. No dice, it has a good flavor profile, the cherry notes come off as genuine not artificial, it looks good, and it has a pleasing mouth-feel."
""
"O - This is what I am looking for when I want a true kriek. The cherries are intense yet the sour funk keeps them in check. This bottle reminds me that I need more of these asap."
"O - Not a bad beer at all. It's up there with Cantillon LP Kriek and Cable Car Kriek. It's way more tart than the other two, if that's your thing. But it still feels more balanced than it probably is. If it weren't for it being $32-$35 a bottle, I'd drink this quite often."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very, very good. No major flaws."
""
""
"...Apparently I need to add more characters before reviewing ... More characters more characters. Yada Yada Yada"
"O: I absolutely loved it and this was my first Drie Fonteinen. I think I may prefer this brewery over Cantillon (how dare I said this!)"
"Overall. Very nice kriek. Unique and big cherry taste."
"O: excellent drinkability, this sour treat of a beer was very good."
"D - I do enjoy this, but I think less age may be the way to go based on my best guess. With the cherries really being the emphasis, you need to allow that fruit to exhibit its full potential. Alas, it's definitely a treat of a lambic and a cool step back in time."

"Brilliant ruby red with a pinkish white head in my mini Duvel tulip. The nose can be smelled across the room. Holy cherries! Tart and juicy. I can't remember having anything this cherry-forward before. Aside from Blabaer, I've never had anything this tart. Sour with just enough Brettanomyces funk in the background. Beautifully crafted. Refreshing body with a sparkle of carbonation. Moar!!"

"O - Very tasty kriek. The flavors from the fruit are very nice. I enjoyed this more than the regular 3F Oude Kriek. Wish it were cheaper (and easier to find) in the US..."
""
""
""
"O- this is fantastic. If only it cost less than $35 a bottle...."
""
""
""
"This is a fantastic beer and one that I have taken for granted as it sits on the shelf while the Cnatillon flies off next to it. Big fan."
""
"Ah yes... That expensive bottle that always just sits on the shelves. Split with my doppelganger this past weekend! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a New Belgium globe. Poured ruby red with a half finger pinkish white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacint throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour cherry, cherry, and BIG funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, BIG funk, earth, and cherry. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The guys at GBX warned me that this wouldn't be what I expected it to be. I must say, they were completely correct on this fact. If you are looking for something with pucker-power, this is not the beer for you. This one was more of a fruity funkiness brew. It was really well done however, and quite enjoyable. Definitely glad I finally decided to shell out the dough on this one. Might be buying more in the future to see what that funky note does with time in the cellar based on this first taste."
""
"Bottled April 26, 2011 - Poured into some Goose Island stemware. Beautiful cherry red body with a thin layer of pink foam. Musty barnyard brett and lightly soured cherries on the nose. Wet hay and a bit of cheese. The flavor is filled with dry, tart, cherries and light, earthy, malt in the background. The cherries in this are excellent. The body is smooth and creamy with a nice tart/sour kick. Light, spritzy bubbles. Slightly more acidic than I remember the regular Oude Kriek being. Overall, this is pretty tasty stuff. I personally like it more than the Oude Kriek, but probably still prefer Cantillon’s Kriek, especially with the $28 price tag on this bottle."
""
""
""
"A decent kriek, but I've had better ones."
"Deep red color, no head. Nice looking, but not great. Rich smell of sour and cherries, vinegar, and oak. There is some earth tones, but the cherries are the focus. Plenty of cherry, lemon, strawberry seeds, wood, vinegar. There is a lot of acetobacter. Quite dry. Very well balanced and enjoyable. Long tart finish. A touch of astringency, very fine carbonation, maybe a little too much so it's kind of distracting. A good beer, but not quite as good as I was expecting. Annoyed I paid as much for it as I did."
"Drie Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek was far more tart and funky than I was anticipating it to be. I really wish my bottle was a bit fresher so that I could have perhaps tasted some of those iconic Schaerbeekse cherries. This was enjoyable but definitely not worth the steep ($38) price tag."
""
""
"O- An excellent kriek, every bit as good as Cantillon kriek, the flavors are simple but done extremely well. It's a pricey beer but is definitely worth trying."
"O: A very refreshing and crisp beer. The tart/sourness is wonderfully balanced with the sweetness, which makes this quite enjoyable."
""
"This beer pours a red raspberry bright red in color with a slight white lacing around my snifter. The nose is incredibly sour, acidic, funky, earthy, and has some yeast to it. It's probably the most sour nose of an beer not named Cantillon. This one is pretty sour. It's so sour that you can't get much cherry, or perhaps I should say any traditional cherry or a cherry pie/cobbler. It's almost pure acid. It's also a little vinous. I like it, it just isn't overly complex. It can't be. It drinks lighter in body with moderate carbonation. This is a really nice Kriek and I've had it before. 2005s are insane right now but I feel this is in its awkward teenage stage, at just under two years old."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a very nice beer to sip and enjoy. At the price of this bottle I’ll probably not be sampling this one very often, but I certainly intend to have it again. Everything here is clean and crisp and I can easily see why many prefer their fruit lambics on the young side before the Brett and funkiness take over. I also think that the variety of cherries used does differentiate this from Kriek’s made with other tart cherries. On the label it describes these cherries as being prized by the makers of Kriek. I understand that now and it isn’t hyperbole."

"o - Overall this is another great kriek from Drie Fonteinen. Is it better than their normal kriek? Probably by a little bit, but when you consider how much more expensive this one is, I don't know if it is worthh the price, certainly not often. The difference between this and their normal kriek is not as wide a gap as it is between their Oude Gueuze and Oude Gueuze Vitnage, so personally I'd rather buy 2-3 bottles of the normal Kriek for the same amount of money. Definitely a good beer though."

"Mouthfeel is thin with a timy bit of carbonation but it seems thicker because its so sour. Really a great beer. I wish I could find this on the shelf all the time."
""
"Extremely, lip-puckeringly sour. Extreme through the finish. Short aftertaste. Surprisingly little cherry flavor and absolutely no sweetness. Not your typical Kriek. Full bodied for the style with a low carbonation level."
""
""
"O: This beer has a good balance of sourness and cherry flavors."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it was a great beer. I love cherries so I've been looking forward to trying this one for a while. The tart, sour cherries were really great in it. Pretty awesome beer to sip on this new Year's Eve."
"What amazes me about this is how clean and crisp all the nuances are. All without the huge funky, cheesyness of some other versions. Not that that is bad at all, just different. Here the acidic/sour fruits and barrel character being the hole show. World class, and one of my favorite lambics."
""
"O - A fantastic kriek. It has a lot of complex sweetness to balance out the sour and tart flavors. I enjoyed it much more than the standard oude kriek, but the price tag is really difficult to swallow. Still glad I grabbed a bottle though."
""
""
"Dark blood red, tiny bit of pink head. Aroma is heavy on the tart cherry with a ton of new pool toys. Flavors are mild sour cherry, lactic and a unique funky hay and moldy wood. Mild carbonation. Decent but not worth the price tag. I LOVE 3F gueuze. Their fruit beers are not on the same level though."

"Lively and bright, this is an awesome kriek, though I find that the other notes that I am enjoying are prying my focus from the delicious cherries. That, combined with the price tag, makes this not quite equal to Cantillon's Kriek lambic in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light red with no head but visible carbonation. Aroma of oak, funk and cherries, just as any good kriek. Taste and mouthfeel is where this really shines. Taste rich of cherries, oak and funk back up the cherries nicely. Tart like no other I've had, mouth puckering in the best way possible. This is a real treat"

"Pours a dark red color with a light pink head. Scent is funky as shit with sweaty gym socks and sweet cherries. Tons of barnyard funk and tart cherry aroma. Not nearly as funky as the regular kriek from 3F though. Taste is immediately sour cherry and biting vinegar. Tons of sour and barrel flavors. Lovely barnyard funk. Awesome cherry flavors. Mouthfeel is sour and sticky on the teeth...medium bodied. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an amazing kriek lambic. I wish I could do a side by side with the regular kriek from this awesome brewery. 3F never lets me down."

"Popped this cork to celebrate my recent promotion. Here's hoping it was worth the considerable investment. It pours a cloudy tawny-rose topped by a few fingers of pink-tinted white foam. The nose comprises tart cherry, light cobweb, vanilla, light caramel (very akin to caramel corn), dank oak, lactic acid, lemon zest, and a twist of ruby red grapefruit. The taste brings in more of the same, though the lactic acid and sour citrus notes seem to cloud the cherries out a bit. A touch of white wine vinegar is tossed into the mix as well, just to liven things up a bit. It's surprising that the tartness isn't more powerful, especially considering the effect it had on the back of my teeth. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, rather sticky finish. Overall, a very nice lambic, though it's hard to really enjoy it for an extended period of time (without experiencing some negative side effect of the sourness). Though I feel the cherries were talked-up a bit too much, I'd gladly take another glass, but I doubt I'd shell out the $35+ for it very often in the future."
"D - If this weren't so expensive I'd buy it regularly. That being said it's similar in price to Lou Pepe Kriek, arguably superior, and is much easier to find (until people wise up and start hoarding, of course). I'm curious if I'll ever have the patience to let this sit on my shelf for five years again."
"A truly special beer. One of my favorites."
"Awesome sour beer. So many other sour/wild ales really just can't compare to the folks at Drie Fonteinen."
"Sharp tart cherries with a good funk. A pretty solid example of the style, and to be honest I am surprised how well the fruit has held up in this one. This was the last bottle on the shelf at one of my favorite shops in town so I had to grab it seeing as proper lambic is becoming a scarce commodity in this country."
"O - great kriek and awesome sour! I love lambics and wild ales!!!"
"There’s no denying Schaerbeekse Kriek is a quality example of the style — a true lambic, with the accompanying tartness and funk — but I wish there was a touch less sour stuff and more sweetness. It gets a little too abrasive near the end of the glass, and I find myself wishing for more cherry."
"A balanced yet tart Kriek. Good cherry flavour and quite nice on the whole though it doesn't blow me away."
"O: Overall, I think I am drinking this beer too young maybe. I was expecting more brett complexity. The fruit flavor is great, but the sourness could be overshadowing the other flavors."
"Great tasting cherry lambic."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. I wanted to tackle this offering with as fresh a bottle as possible to see how much fruited flavor was in one of these before it fades and the funk overtakes it. I was not disappointed in the least. I really enjoyed the natural flavoring of this brew and it was very easy drinking. At no point did I pick up on the 5% alcohol that was listed on the bottle."
"While its not the most impressive looking or smelling fruit lambic, Schaerbeekse Kriek is definitely among the most fruit forward and tastiest. Probably one of, if not the most impressive widely available lambic out there now. Fresh vintages take almost completely blow away the competition in my opinion. Worth the hefty price tag."
"Very high drinkability. Tasty enough to be good, complex enough to keep me interested, and sour enough to scratch that sour itch. The biggest strike against this beer is the $37 price tag."
"O- The barnyard and cherry notes are nice but turn a bit watery as the beer opens up. The very soft tartness and not much depth make it a bit drap to drink the whole bottle."
"Overall: Enjoyable, light, sour, and interesting, but I'm left wanting to try this in a vertical-style setting, where we can really see the beauty of the yeast taking the edge off of the sweetness. Worth seeking out if for no other reason than to forget about it for a while and tackle it on a warm day...as it's tasty now, and I can only imagine how tasty it'd be later."
"O- This is an amazing beer. Best Kriek I've had the pleasure of tasting. The Schaerbeekse cherries are truly unique and are an obvious choice to pair with lambic style beer. Be ready to sip as this beast is very very tart."
"Light-bodied mouthfeel with little carbonation and a thin dryness in the finish of the beer. Great tasting lambic, for sure. I'd say the price is justified a bit– was just hoping to have experienced a bit more, considering the rarity of these cherries. Just lucky to have been able to get a bottle of this and give it a try. Another well-done item by Armand."
"mouthfeel - not over the top, cherry is a little cloying. refreshing but not as good as the rest"
"750 ml bottle. Bottled in April 2010. Pours a dark red with small white head that has decent retention and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is huge cherry, some cherry pits, some lactic acid, light barnyard funkiness, and just the smallest hint of acetic acid. Awesome. The taste is again huge with cherry flavor without sweetness, cherry pits, a decent amount of sourness, with a good lactic tartness on the finish. Medium body. Low carbonation. I found the carbonation to be a bit low and felt the beer would have definitely benefited from more carbonation. Still a phenomenal beer. It reminded me a lot of the fresh Lou Pepe Kriek I had on tap a few weeks ago. I found the Lou Pepe to be slightly more enjoyable, but certainly loved this as well."
"Not a bad kriek, and a pretty bright and unapologetically acidic one. It doesn't have a great deal of complexity, and the rampant acidity makes me consider it a little unbalanced, but it's a respectable beer nonetheless."
"No head to speak of. Color was a cloudy raspberry red. Nose smelled of oak and cherries. I was reminded of some of the better homemade wines my uncle made while we were out in the Bay Area. Mouthfeel was medium with an initial cherry tartness on the tongue, followed by a pleasant oakiness. Finish was tart, but not puckeringly so, very cherry, underlain by oak. l like Drie Fonteinen and this was another shining example of their beers."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle, bottled on date of 28-04-2010. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a ruby red/purple color with a very small light pink head. Head retention is low, and there's also a small amount of lacing. Aroma is tart cherries, barnyard funk, vinegar and some oak. I think the taste is just like the aroma, it's all tart cherries, funk, vinegar and oak. The sourness isn't overpowering at all, but it's a pretty good tasting brew. There's also a lingering tart finish. The beer just tastes better and better the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has medium/high carbonation and it's somewhat slick and very easy to drink. I think it's a pretty good overall brew, and it would be interesting to see how this one ages. My only complaint about this beer is the price at $33.99 a bottle. But even then I don't think I was ripped off for the price, and I would likely buy this again at the same or similar price if I come across it."
"Overall: Unique to try, significantly different from the bottled and re-fermented one! This is like a lambic with fresh cherries juice. I had world class fruit beers before (hommage, framboos, fou foune, blabaer) but this must be the best fruit taste I ever had. Pure juice, amazing!"
"D: A great sour pucker!"
"This is darn good. I love the funky aroma most of all. This beer's acidity is high, thus making it one to take slowly."
"EDIT: The last bottle I had could have used a tad more carbonation, still lovely, but had to change the 4.85 score it was. We'll see if it rises back to the top, still have plenty of bottles on hand."
"this beer pours a purple reddish color with thin to barely there head. the smell is huge barnyard funk with a faint cherry note and some tart notes mixed in as well. the flavor follows suit with the funkiness taking the cake cherry flavor is all but gone, and there is a tart finish. the mouthfeel was thin and slightly acidic. overall a good beer, but would like to try fresh"
"O: The only thing I can seriously slam this on is the price tag, although the style can vaguely justify it. This beer does an amazing job balancing everything out, especially considering there isn't really that sweetness that you get in some lambics. Definitely seek this out if you can afford it"
"Drink- I wanted to go big for #600 and I have seen this at two bars and I never pulled the trigger due to $, so when a friend of mine had this at his shop I had to pounce on it. So glad I did. It was true to its nature and tasty. Id have it again in a heartbeat."
"A great sour, though as usual I wish the cherries were a bit stronger. Really nice funk though and very drinkable considering the style."
"The finish of this is superb. The cherry, wine, vinegar and vinous notes combine to form a great flavor."
"O: With a bit less tartness this would hold up the the Lou Peppe Kriek. However, for the time being Cantillon takes the crown in my opinion."
"overall, i was a bit let down considering the high price tag associated with it. the regular drie fonteinen kriek has a bit of a better cherry flavor. quite good, i had no issues drinking this and if the price was cut back drastically, i would buy this far more often."
" A very clean beer in aroma and taste."
"This is one of the best balanced fruit lambics I've had, revealing a nice sweet flavor while maintaining the wonderful yeast tartness."
"The feel is this is great. Perfectly light body with soft carbonation. When it comes down ot it I really wonder if it gets better than this. A real treat here."
"DR: An excellent beer. I have to admit given the rarity and price tag this one didn't quite live up to my (unfair) standards. I think I would actually give this one more time in the future to allow some of the brett to play out a bit more. Also, I am not sure if the cherries just faded, but they didn't play as big a role as I was expecting."
"D: I'm hard pressed to find the 6% ABV. Drinks fantastic and is very refreshing on this beautiful spring day. Reminds me quite a bit of Russian River Supplication which is a bonus as RR does not distribute to the Midwest. The 750ml was a bit pricey, but for the style, this is par for the course. Cheers."
"(D)- Overall, it is a solid fruit lambic. There are better ones out there especially considering the $$ it costs for one of these. Nonetheless, this is very easy drinking and enjoyable; just wish it had something more to offer considering the higher price tag this demands on the shelves."
"The taste is not as sour as I'd have guessed, but it does have some lactic strength. I actually think the cherries are responsible for some of the tart character, at least it seemed that way. A very good match of fruit and lambic, this was a nice surprise on cask."
"Bottle thanks to glouglouburp. Fairly dark brownish red pour with slightly pink foam. Aroma is nice and fruity, but not the classic ""cherry pie"" cherry aroma. More of a subtle tart nose of cherries with hints of blueberries. There is something ""fresh"" about the aroma that makes it so memorable, a fresh breeze of mint and pine. classic lambic funk character. Superb. Taste is very sour with a nice red berries twist but not very funky with a very dry finish. A lambic for the purist, maybe a little bit too sour and dry for me but still excellent."
"Thanks to BA dannyhipps for the bottle... Best anniversary present I've gotten in a while"
"Truly a delightful drink, lots of clean sour flavor, you can taste and smell the cherries in just the right proportion. I will be seeking this beer out again."
"So far the most complex kriek I've tried, very demanding."
"While not a pretentious beer (being an ancient/rustic/ almost primordial style), it is still one to be sipped, cherished, and engaged with your full attention. Would pair very well with a variety of cheeses."
"D. Super drinkable - probably my favorite sour thus far."
"Pours the most brilliant bright red you could imagine with a small but tight pink head. The aroma is dirty laundry and dirty barnyard with some animal waste and hay in there for sure. There is plenty of intense cherry sourness in there throughout. The flavor is dominated by a strong sourness and lots of tart cherries. The beer is earthy and complex with light leathery notes and a very complimentary nuttiness. The palate is both full and well carbonated like a sparkling wine. Magnificent, an absolute masterpiece."
"D- Very drinkable tasty and satisfying."
"The exceptionally high level of tartness makes one 750 enough."
"bottled October 17, 2008. awesomer, purer, fruitier, more-sour, and nuttier than the regular drie oude kriek is the best point of reference i can give. pours a hazy and kind of glowing pink-red with a pink head that crackles and fades to a collar that sticks the whole time. nose is an acidic blast of super-clean, bright cherry and hints of other fruits (i swear i get raspberry and plum too) along with some nuttiness?, earth, mushroom and oak. there's definitely some dark almost roasty underlying flavor that is hard to describe that just fills everything out. knocks my socks off, but not huge and overpowering, just subtle and elegant. taste is sour cherry fruity nutty blast in perfect balance. i'm sure age has soured it up a bit and zipped it up a bit in the mouthfeel, but it seems about prime right now. i would love to do a vertical with a fresh one of these in the mix. awesome. i could drink this all day. makes me dream of cherry trees."
"Somewhat under-whelmed with this brew, but I suspect it's just because it's so young. Really dug the 3 year old Oude Kriek that I drank recently, though."
"Tasted of mild fruit. But mostly tart and acidic with some overly sweet tones. Brett all over here with an oaky woodiness to. Just over the top funkiness that really cradled the sweet, fruit juice flavors."
"Drinkability - Great Beer! Not worth $36 for a 750 mL but worth trying. I still promote the Cantillon Cherry Kriek if looking for a great Lambic. This one only being $20-25 depending on where you purchase it."
"Lighter body, nice carbonation, some dry and sticky feels but plenty of bubbliness which invigorates the sense. Drinks easy throughout the entire serving. The tartness is fairly aggressive, but still enjoyable, and this goes down pretty smooth for the most part."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation but nice fizz on the tongue. Without being sparkling, this feels alive. An authentic sour I could drink all day long without suffering from heartburn or loosing the enamel on my teeth. Just amazing business here!"
"It cuts through with tons of acidic properties. Fruit flavor is very subtle."
"overall - this is a great kriek. i went in thinking this was going to be super sour like the lou pepe, and was a little disappointed, but after drinking more i really enjoy the added complexity it brings to the front. the only real downfall it has is the finish."
"Highly recommended."
"Overall, I much prefer this fresh to the older vintages. The fruit flavor is much more dominant and brings a wonderful balance to this beer. Also love the level of sourness...just enough to make the mouth pucker, but not to the point where it will put a hole in your stomach. Another awesome lambic...looking forward to the day where I can just pick up an American lambic and have it taste just as great as this beer."
"I have to give Drie Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek a super uber nom noms! :D"
"D: I liked it, but at the risk of earning alfrantzell's wrath and being a target for Narke Xantus, Pt. II, I thought it wasn't worth $35. I will try it once more fresh and see if that changes my impression, but I can certainly say the price is not worth it for an aged bottle. On the plus side, I seem not to have any reactions to this beer, so maybe it's just Cantillon that bothers me."
"D - Not as tart/sour as other lambics like cantillon but extremely drinkable , very Nice."
"Bottled April, 2010. Pours a hazy burgundy with a small head, shows to be a brilliant ruby red when held to the light. Nose is deep, rich black cherries, spices, of course a tight brett, and funk. Mouth is very tight, which surprised me as it's still quite young. Dry, sour cherries up front, puckering to the mid and back palate. Lots of oak, sour fruit elements, and a really dry, tight brett. Very nicely put together. Acidity is moderate, though I'm particularly sensitive to it. A different animal than the Lou Pepe Kriek, perhaps a tad beneath it at this age. Nice stuff."
"D: drinkable, especially for a warm summer day"
"Bottle courtesy of mothman. Bright red pour with a dark pink head. Slightly cloudy. Smells of fruit and funk, cherry and oak. Not as sweet as you might expect but rather a long drawn out over ripe cherry taste that ends with a subtle tartness. The taste to me leaves just a little to be desired. Light mouthfeel. Overall a really solid fruit lambic, my only wish is that it was a little cheaper to buy everyday."
"D - Pleasure to try. I would definitely drink more if it was there."
"D= This beer in my opinion is even better than the Cantillon Kreik which I though was the benchmark before. This beer actually blows it away. One of the most complex Kreiks I've ever had and not overly sweet. A lovely beer indeed. Bottle from Oct. 17, 2008"
"The beer pours a dark red color with a white head. The aroma is cherry, oak, vanilla, tartness and funk. The flavor is strong cherry with vanilla, oak and tartness. The beer is very dry and is pretty funky. Very drinkable and very well done. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Comments: Overall, a fine kriek lambic. It carries many of the fine characteristics found within the Gueze style. This is my kind of lambic!"
"J"
"This is decent, but nothing special, not worth pursuing wildly."
"Sour, dry and drinkable describe this beer. Very glad I got to try it, as lambics are always interesting beers to drink."
"Taste is awesome, so tart an sour and super funky. Mouthfeel is fairly light and thin but it's very drinkable. Its super tasty and drinkable worth seeking out."
"Overall, the medicine is what kills this beer. Not as good as some of the others I have had from them. Not worth the price tag imo. Somewhat drinkable if one can get past the medicine flavor."
"D - We easily finished the bottle and we both wanted more. This is going to be a classic in due time. Stock up now if it's near you."
"Lighter body, low carbonation. A nice complexity. Alcohol is a non-factor. Very nice."
"Light bodied with a decent puckering quality, fruity and full of delicious cherry flavor. Wood tannins with a hint of funk and barnyardy qualities. Finish is moderate with good amounts of carbonation."
"D: DrieFonteinen's Schaerbeekse Kriek isn't my favorite Kriek (that probably goes to the Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek), but it is probably the most unique when compared to other krieks and for that it will always have a favored place in my cellar."
"Depp ruby red in color with poofy spritzy pinkish hued head. First whiff is of tart cherry, progressing into many complex notes of red wine with hints of must and vinegar. First taste is of a tart, young, unrippened cherry, it backs into notes of funk, cranberry and merlot grapes. Slight boozy touch and warmth to it. Medium bodied, slick. A truly unique kriek with many charachteristics of a red wine."
"Overall a beautiful beer that was incredibly balanced and drinkable."
"It's a masterpiece. What else can I say?"
"The body is medium and carbonation is at appropriate levels. This one drinks very nicely, never becoming overwhelming for the palate. Overall I am very impressed by the balance of this beer. Top quality kriek, for sure."
"D- Based on the way it looked I thought I was in deep trouble, but I could probably drink this one on my own even though it doesn't seem like a beer to me."
"3F Schaerbeekse Kriek pours a very rich and beautiful shade of red with a huge head that fades rather quickly and leaves no trace of lacing behind. Very tart cherry scents fill the olfactory senses from several feet away. There is a great funkiness to this beer that has developed over the six years it spent in the cellar. The taste is musty and sour with tart cherries - truly delicious. The mouthfeel is very nice, with mild acidity present in the finish. There was still plenty of fruit present after six years. I recommend aging this great fruit lambic, as it will only get better."
"F: Lingering sour cherry, very sour and tangy especially on the finish, a touch of balsamic vinegar taste as well. Dry, very dry, with a touch of yeasty flavor and more funk, this time a combination of sour fruit funk and barnyard. A little bitterness seems to come from the yeast and funk as well."
"Tart, puckering medium body that is pretty sweet and not very acidic. Soft carbonation up front with some slight funk, earthy oak and vanilla. The cherries are very prominent, providing an extremely fresh, sweet juicy fruit flavor which is an excellent balance to the funky tart sourness. I'm also picking up a slight nut presence that adds to the earthy character. Dry finish. This beer is very complex, well balanced and insanely drinkable. Highly recommended."
"Beer is quite sour, lots of lactic and some citric. Acetic is lesser but is still there. The cherries are not as forward as I would have wanted. I think the off aroma I was smelling was actually the cherry flavor. Second taste, not as tart as I want it to be, its like a big red gueze with a fruity aftertaste. Interesting."
"Very nice lambic, but not really worth the price over the Oud Kriek."
"All things considered, while this is very good beer, though disappointing, I'd have to take the Oude Kriek over it."
"Overall, I was expecting this to be good but not this good. I was floored by this, and if not for the price tag I would buy a lot of this to stock up."
"Notch below most 3F offerings, and one of the most expensive here in the states at that ($40)."
"D: Low abv with a near-perfect level of lactic sourness. This is one to be savored, but one that I could easily knock back a few of."
"Utterly drinkable, but one to savor for sure. The fruit may have faded slghtly, but so has the acidity, and right now this is a fine Kriek. One i'll be picking up indefinitely..."
"Overall this is one of the crisper smelling sours I've had in a while and the way it opens up as it warms is very nice. Well worth a shot."
"I bought multiple bottles to confirm. Each expressed the same delicate funk, the same full figured fruit, the same balance. One last bottle awaits me in the cellar, but it won't wait long. Who would have thought perfection would be pink."
"Corked and caged 750. Pours a brilliant, deep, ruby red color with a small pink head that was gone quickly, and no lacing. Wow, great color on this beer, and leaves me with high hopes for the amount of cherry that must be in play here. Nice funky brett notes come out at first, notes of wood, leather, and mustiness. Only a small amount of cherry comes out in the nose, but it starts to show more as it warms. Flavor is bracingly tart and acidic. Nice mixture of acidity, oak and tartness, with hints of lemon in the front, followed by an earthy, herbal, almost cheesy like flavor, and just a touch of cherry on the back end that almost turns medicinal as it warms and gets to the bottom of the bottle. Musty, funky, and sour are the best words to describe this. Perfect, medium body on this with some abrasive carbonation at first, but turns light and delicate near the end. Wow, what can I say? I wish this one came in a 33cl bottle, because the 750ml is getting to be tough to put away by myself. Should have shared this with others, but I be a glutton for the evening. This is one of the best Belgian fruit lambics I've ever had and certainly blows away Lindeman's kriek in not only flavor, but also complexity. Great brew and glad I had the chancce to try it before Drie Fonteinen moves away from producing lambics and looks more towards distilling and blending."
"D: I'm glad to have finally been able to give this lambic a try. Great cherry and funk to this one, and I'd drink it again any day."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, tart, lip smacking, funky, and addictive."
"Drinkability is good but not quite outstanding. Overall though, this beer is outstanding. Easily one of the better fruit lambics out there."
"Not a bad fruit lambic, and its got some nice complexity in the nose and flavour, but I'm not sure its worth the hefty price tag. In fact, I'd say that Drie Fonteinen's regular kriek is preferable to this one. Hopefully that one is still going to be produced at Boon."
"While not overly sour this one is a gut buster. Could feel it part way through and I think drinking a while 750 might make you regret it in the morning with all those bugs. Not as drinkable as I could have hoped due to carbonation. Still quite complex and nice but just not a regular."
"D: Nicely complex, a real winner. Gives Cantillon kriek a run for its money."
"Over all a nice lambic. pretty tasty."
"I suppose I'll need to try a fresher batch. The beer didn't quite meet my expectations, but I admit that they were high. It was still quite enjoyable and I wouldn't hesitate to try it again. I had no trouble drinking the bottle."
"**Edit 10 June 2010. I got to try this at The Great Lambic Summit in Philly, side by side with the 2007 Lou Pepe Kriek. While I preferred the Lou Pepe, the Schaerbeekse was almost as excellent as I remembered it being. The fruit character of the SK is more explosive, a touch funkier, maybe a touch solventy. Certainly more leathery and a little more tannic as well."
"Drinkability: High. No overwhelming flavor or sweetness, all mixed together very well. Wish I had another one of these to enjoy."
"Thanks Bo!"
"D: quite nice overall. Much better than the other, overly sweet krieks that are widely available."
"D: A very good fruit lambik with an interesting cherry character. Impressive."
"Interesting, very good."
"Huge thanks to Koopa for sending this my way, thank you so much I included it as part of a larger sour tasting. Reddish-pink color and different than the Hommage. Smells like cherry lambic but not as fruity as I hoped. Then again, this was bottled in March of 2005 so that could be a factor. The taste was spritzy cherries that reminded me of cherry 7-Up! This was a good enough kriek but nowhere close the Hommage."
"D: All day long. So good and easy to drink. They are one of those breweries that you see their beer you do not even think about it twice."
"Thanks to a friend for bringing this back from the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam. Oude kriek? How about old funky kriek. The cherries are just barely in here. Sure, the appearance is a hazy red with a short pink head (that quickly disappears). The aroma is big on horseblanket, leather, fresh garden, herbal tea. The flavor has more lemon peel and lime with a drop of cherry sugar candy. The finish is tart farmhouse funk."
"Thanks to bifrostguard for opening this up at Toronado tonight. This is from '06. 750ml into a tulip, this beer pours a clear glowing garnet color with a finger of cherry-red foam. The nose is muted at colder temperatures, but it begins to open up around 60 degrees. Sour cherries at the forefront, juicy and sharp, with a leathery, barnyard-like funky backbone. The cherries are beautifully expressed in the aroma, swirling brings out one of the most intense tart cherry aroma I've come across in beer. On the tongue this beer is sharp and acidic from start to end, massively fruity but subtly complex. Earth, leather and tobacco undertones lead into a crisp, biting finish. The sourness is very lactic and concentrated, and the beer on the whole is surprisingly clean, which really helps to showcase the character of the fruit. This one's tart as hell, a definite sipper, but one I enjoyed sipping on for over an hour."
"This beer seems younger or greener than the Oud Kriek. The Shaerbeekse cherries may be a more tart version of those used in the Oud Kriek, or perhaps I have a new bottle that is less aged. Regardless, the comparisons are so slight that I might not recognize them if not having both within the same week. Fresher, more tart, and with an overall vibrant quality, I may give the slight edge to the Shaerbeekse version."
"Almost definitely the best kriek I've ever had, and probably the best lambic as well."
"D - This reminds me of blending a lambic and quelque chose. Not as tart/sour as other lambics but extremely drinkable."
"D- One to share with friends, no way I could polish off a bottle of this. Low in abv and high in flavor but not too harsh on the palete, im quite liking this offering from Fonteinen. Would drink again, im just not sure if i will be able to find it again."
"Courtesy of RomanW70. Served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured the color of pommegranate juice; murky with no head. Nose was sour fruit and cherries. Taste follows nose, but but not as sour as suggested by the nose; some acidity is detected in the mouth. Mouthfeel was light and lively; not too much carbonation, but some astringency is present towards the finish. Easy drinking and well balanced. I'm not overly familiar with the style, but I found this quite pleasant to drink with a tolerable amount of sourness; quite enjoyable."
"Bottle. Pours a reddish purple with a minimal violet head. Aroma of brett, cherries, wood, and some funk. Taste is similar, but wasn't quite as sour as the nose. Lots of cherries, dark fruits, wine, and spice, with consistent sour present. Fairly light body with medium carbonation. Very nice beer with a lot of complexity, but lacking the strong sour taste i associate with a lambic."
"Reviewed 4/7/08. Bottle (label said March 22, 2006). Pours a deep ruby red with a quickly dissipating pink head. Aroma of tart fruit and sourness. Taste of tart cherries, cherry pie, pie crust, and a little touch of cinnamon. Delicious! Not too sour (which is a plus for me). My favorite lambic to date! 8/4/9/4/17 (4.2/5)"
"D-Nice,bold sour cherry tartness but not out of control...like Cantillon Kriek. This is a bit less extreme but no less drinkable. A lambic you can have a glassful and sit and enjoy."
"Bottled sample shared with oakbluff. Deep ruby red in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of ripe sour cherry, mild wood, and a touch of funk. Great flavors of sour (but not overly so) cherries, mud, wood, farmhouse funk, light malts, and a bit of lemon. Not as crazy sour as Cantillon products, but everything is so well balanced. The carry-through of the cherry flavor is pretty amazing. Very nice indeed."
"D - This is sour, but not over the top, despite the fairly strong initial aroma. While it does possess a slightly medicinal quality, it also has a pretty smooth body and a bold sour cherry tartness."
"Bottom line: This is a great brew and, from my point of view, that's all I need to say. ;^)"
"Refreshing brew that is a standout."
"Notes from and tasted on 12/12/05."
"Bottle shared via fisherman34- thanks Kris for this tasty treat! Pours a rich dark cherry colour with pinkish head. Nose- charry forward with some wood. Taste- full mouthfeel with fresh plump tasting cherries, medium tartness earthy brett. The wood and cherry tartness mingle well to create a highly drinkable fruit lambic. Finishes with a soft lemony sourness. Lovely drink"
"Overall this was excellent. Easily one of the best I have ever had in the style and well worth its reputation and ranking. I would have no issue at all with getting this one again any day. Really a top notch beer and something that any fan of sours really needs to give a try."
"This was a nice sour, and very tasty. Not much cherry for a Kriek beer, but I didn't mind it so much. It is very straightforward good, but not sure if it is worth the high price tag to be buying to much of this stuff. Best to split the cost with a friend..."
" My girlfriend took one smell and made a face. Then she took a sip and almost gagged at the sourness. I guess she was expecting Lindemann's. Thank god she didn't like it since I had absolutely no problem finishing off the entire bottle. This is some amazingly good stuff, right here."
"Pours a clear dark orange/red, thin off white head forms, touch of pink, settles to a thin ring, few lace spots. Smell is intense, tons of sourness, oak, very woody, earth, cherries, very acidic and tart, horseblanket, crazy. Taste is similar, nice fruitiness and cherries, very acidic, lots of oak, tannic, sour/tart finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium bodied, light burning, acidic."
"drinkability is good. nice balance, but the sourness causes it to be a sipper. i find myself taking a sip and then shaking my head as the intense puckering sourness takes over, then slowly subsides. i'm really enjoying it. the bottle was a touch pricey, but i'd happily get this one again."
"Good beer but best held for those special occasions when you have a nice meal to pare it with."
"This beer was very refreshing and drinkable. Not quite as sharp and focussed as the Cantillon Lou Pepe IMO. Still, very tasty."
"Pours an absolutely brilliant color of purplish red, like some exotic variety of blood. Transluscent with haze and fine suspended particles, but no protein coagulation. Nice head that is tinted pink. Absolutely magnificent in the glass with the light hitting it just right. The smell is sharply sour, but witth a touch of cream as well. Predominant component aroma is sour cherrries. Very little barnyard funk, but very nice zingy cherries. The taste is complex with cherrry sourness and unlike the aroma, quite a bit of funk. There are also some fairly pronounced phenolic notes, but these are fairly well integrated and fade a bit with the beer opening up. The cherrry flavors are very pure and sort of float over the other flavors in the glass. Still, its not a perfectly harmonious whole and although good, something is lacking a bit to bring it all together. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and a delight. Good drinkability, but the phenols and lack of totally integrated whole make it a bit challenging. I like this beer a good bit, just not quite as much as some of the Cantillon examples, or quite as much (as far as taste goes0 as I thought I might."
"Pours a hazed/cloudy ruby. Nose is antisepticand woody. Flavor is bringing the funk. Sour is definitely there but doesn't overpower at all. The kriek is firmly present, but stays a bit calm still. Feel is good on the liquid; a bit thick with a nice carbonationcaressing the tongue. Overall very good. There isn't much odd going on here. Just a traditional kriek lambic here with a pretty full taste and a bit of a sharp edge. Well crafted and worth trying. The only detractor is the sharp edge that might turn some people off."
"bottle on the list at DBA in Manhattan. This is a dark bloody ruby/cherry red looking brew with an off-white/pink head of foam that dies down eventually to a thin sheet. Aromas of sharp acidic funk, cherries, barnyard, horse blanket, and rolls royce. Taste is similar, super funky, tart, astringent, sour, apple cider vinegar, cherries and more. Mouthfeel is spritzy and effervescent, drinkability is great. A classic lambic, one of the best fruit lambics out there."
"A well-done lambic - cherries very real-tasting. Nice mix of lambic and gueuze. Good oaky touch. Pricey, but worth it as a special treat."
"Pours out to what looks to be pomegranate juice with an almost still composure and a thin, frothy, pink head. Leaves some scant lacing. Aroma, of course, has a very strong presence of acid, but the overall funk seems a bit muted and restrained. Still has a mossy, old attic aroma thing going on. Has one of the more pronounced fresh cherry aromas out of any other kriek I've had. I get a little faint earthy hop in the background. Flavor gets kicked off with intense acid and a touch of rubber and woodiness. This segues into a bright, fresh cherry flavor (along with some mild accompanying sweetness) which rides out into the drying and tart finish. Has a bit of a fungal element in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel straddles the line between light and moderate in weight and has a lively carbonation. Although this is not one of the most complex lambics, this, like all traditional lambics, is really drinkable."
"Overall: A real nice drinking beer. Shared it with a wine loving buddy of mine and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Tons of flavor with an insane amount of spritz. The tartness of this one makes it extra special. If this is their Kriek, I can't wait to try their Gueuze that I have in the fridge."
"D: A year ago I never would've thought something tart and sour could be considered even remotely refreshing. I guess that proves our palates are always evolving. This is awesome!"
"poured from 750ml bottle from pizza port bottle shop. Poured into guezue glass. Poured a murky rust red color with nice white bubbly head. Smells are a low amount of farmhouse funk but a big vingear cherry aroma springs out to you. Taste is cherry with a little vingear followed by a nice tart dryness. The low level of carbonation gives a smooth feel. I wish i could drink this Kriek every time I want a Kriek. The smoothest Kriek ever."
"750 mL. Lovely color, pinkish/orange color wiht a light pink head. Good nose of lambic and cherries. Phenomenal cherry fruit character, natural, pure, juicy and lingering on the palate. Mouth feel seems a bit off. Awfully outstanding still, but not my favorite of 3F."
"What's it say when a sip of beer makes you think of a savory cherry pie, albeit one with some down-home farm funkitude? It says someone is a master with their fruit lambics. It's in turn subtle, bold, patient, and brisk. I was almost worried about getting a pit with my cherries. Well, not really, but you know what I'm saying. And I'll tell you I was sad to empty this bottle, and even sadder that it was the only one I had. But there is more in my future, of this you can be sure."
"Extreme tartness dries the mouth and the carbonation is very appropriate. If you like sour, it's very easy to finish off an entire bottle. Great lambic."
"Drinkability would be a 5 if I could have this all the time. An 8 hour round trip prevents me from that."
"Bottle courtesy of Boboski: Poured a cloudy bright red/pink color lambic with a medium foamy head with some good retention and lacing. Aroma of sour cherry and oak is pretty dominant and overly enjoyable. Taste is a mix between some sour cherry, tart and oaky notes are also very present. I thought the level of acidity was quite low or at least well balance that it was not getting in the way. This was definitely a notch above the regular kriek and something I wouldnt mind having again."
"Had a year and a half later and the ageing and being a very fortunate bottle made it exceptionally smooth, good oaking."
"A touch of astringency, very fine carbonation, nice mouthfeel. Quite drinkable."
"Absolutely stellar stuff and worth the steep $24.99."
"Light fresh tart, fizzy in the mouth, so succulent, so tangy, such a classic dry lambic with pure, delicious expression of fruit; no sweetness to speak of. Initial sharpness softens and mellows as this amazing creation changes and develops in the glass. A treat. Had this once before at Hop Devil Grill in Manhattan; compares very favorably with Cantillon Kriek. One of those brews that will beguile beer and wine drinkers alike."
"Poured out a dark purple color with a dark red body. Lovely pink head with good head retention. The nose is tart, with oak and dark cherries. The taste is big cherry, sourness, some oak, warmth, acid. The mouthfeel is super dry with zesty carbonation. Perfectly balanced."
"750 ml bottle, 8 oz sample. This brew pours a deep ruby color with absolutely no head. Clarity is moderately clear, and there is no carbonation at all. Good looking cherry lambic. This one smells of lots of sourness, with a light kiss of cherry. There is a big mustyness in there as well. This one defintately is not focused on the fruit, with a very nice sour and musty. I can't wait to see what the flavor does with this one. Taking a sip, I get nice mild sourness, accentuated by very spicey oak tannin and fruity cherry. The sourness is mild, just enough to balance the fruity cherry. This one is not heavy in flavor, but the subtlty of it really accentuates the fruity notes. I really like it. Feel is moderate with a minimal carbonation. It is only slightly puckering on the sides of the tongue, so it really keeps this one drinking very easy. I really like this one. I think the flavors are really well balanced, with a really nice spicey tannin and cherry in the aftertaste. I could probably drink this one all night. Very good show."
"Served from a 750 ml caged and corked bottle at Cooper's Seafood in Scranton, Pa. The beer poured a nice redish color with a medium thickness pink head and good retention and lacing. The aroma is of sweet cherries but also a nice kick of barnyard funk. The taste is very tart and strong cherry taste along with the funk but the funk is not overpowering. A very enjoyable taste as if the cherries were freshly picked. This ranks right up there with any Cantillon offerings."
"definitely worth trying, this great blender and brewer of lambics has a very limited product line but their tuff is top notch."
"It uses the same type of cherries as the draft version (Schaerbeek), but that is where the similarity ends. The bottled version is dry, sour and has a bit of cherry in the nose. It is definitely not sweet and the cherry is not too apparent in the flavor. The Kriek is the typical deep red color and was quite tasty. Of course there is the Lambic flavor present to balance and enhance the subtle cherry flavor."
"The 750ml bottle had a bottled on date of March of 05. Dark red body with a small white bubbly head that quickly recedes down leaving some light rings of lacing. Big aroma filled with tart cherries, woody notes and some light funkiness. A light sweetness peaks through the mainly sour nose. I am surprised how much the cherries come through. The flavor starts off with the sour cherries, some lambic funk and some wood notes. The tartness is pretty strong but not huge. Finishes up with a dry acidic bite with lingering light cherries. The cherries come through well in all aspects of the beer and while this isnt a sour monster its more than tart enough for any sour beer fan. Mouthfeel is great with perfect carbonation. Amazing drinkability as the only thing limiting me from having this all the time is the price and rarity."
"Drinkability & Notes  Easier to drink than just about any other lambic I have had. This beer reminds me more of American products like Belgian Red or Supplication than a traditional Belgian Kriek because the sourness is more restrained and the fruit flavor is fuller and fresher. A must try if you can find it, even at the steep price."
"Taste: The cherries came out as real and as potent as I've ever tasted in a lambic, it was like eating fresh ripe cherries. It was relatively sweet, so the acidity seemed a bit more shadowed but still plenty puckering. The funk factor was also a bit toned down in the taste, in fact I'm really surprised that Mélanie didn't like this more than her usual half-sip and puckered face. The drinkability for me was through the roof."
"pours a dark pink color with orangey tints. no head whatsoever. very, very tart smell also shows a lot of gueze. in the mouth, immediatly very dry, austere, very tart and puckering -- as in, I could feel my cheeks sucking in. very dry finish. delicate cherry flavors, gueze funk, tartness and some cherry funk too. interesting. still not as good as the cask oude kriek though."
"Overall: A damn fine Kriek, serve it very lightly chilled to get the best and the difference that the Shaerbeekse Cherries will be very apparent then. This is well worthy of a purchase, but at $17/$18 a bottle unfortunately this will never be a staple in my fridge, in fact I would go so far as to say that the bottle I purchased at Somerville Supersaver in NJ and lugged West and then shared with BAs Davo and Erica before the Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival will probably be the only one I ever buy in the US. It was a pleasure to revisit this marvelous Kriek, it is indeed one of the better traditional Krieks out there, but it is just too damn expensive to drink in the US, sadly. Maybe Ill snag one more bottle to stash away, I have a feeling that this one will age nicely."
"holds up well to its blended brothers- takes top prize in the drinkability category and despite its medium harshness still caters mostly to friends of cantillon. a brewing achievement and worth a try.. although i'm not sure i would drop another $17. one time treat."
"From March 1, 2005 1 pt. 9.4 fl. oz bottle. Purchased for $21.13. Pours rosy purple in color. Aromam is of cherries and smells like a cherry wine. Deep fruity aroma. First sip reveals a little sour taste with some musty earthy elements. Definite oak in the flavor. Some vanilla coming through in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light on the tongue with a soft water sensation. Flavor develops as you let the aftertaste settle on the tongue between sips. Not meant to gulp but to savor. Not as sour as other krieks."
"Release 2005. Great presentation with beautifull red collored beer tiny pink head. Nose is magnificent too giving lots of cherrie carracter, cheese of aged hops and some of the finest funky geuzeaccents I've ever expierienced. Great sourness and slight oak note on a leather sadle there to complete this perfect nose. Taste is extraordinary also having finest sour cherrie, great dry carracter overal with good bretty horsesweat bathing is sour, slightly noticable alcoholic wheatymaltjuice. Yes this is something extraordinary fine. Maybe litle souredy and not 100% mellowed down but guess this one could rise to a 5 by a year of what age."
"Bottle brought back by MartinT to whom it was given by JorisP. Cheers to both. Enjoyed also with Oakes, Kimchee and tiggmtl Appearance is a beautiful bloody red with a thin pink head. The red is so brilliant that it scores a 5 anyway. Aroma is complex of lambic funk. Spicier than most with cinnamon, cloves. The cherries are very nice, feeling unriped, both black and red cherries, intense and bold for a lambic. Earthy mold. Palate is very lactic with its typical yoghourt sourness, balsamic and citric, moderately salty. Funky brett with nutty, earthy branches and leafy undertones. It didnt strike me as spectacular from the first sip and sniff, but it grew on me and I realised I drank my glass very fast. I like its grapey vinous character and as weird as it sounds, to me, this is a quaffable offering despite its a real crime to just think about drinking this fast! This is a very complex kriek, with a good backing medium body and medium-high carbonation. Just what a brewery!"
