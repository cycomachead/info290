"Fantastic, dry tartness paired with sunny, stingy fresh strawberries, leading to a chewy mouthfeel, with an enormous sour aftertaste, which leaves the palate slightly dazed, but very satisfied."

"This is simply not my style and that is why this beer getting such a low rating. Had it and now trying to forget it..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was alright, although completely flat"
""
"The flavor follows with the green apple, but is not as tart. The vinegar and funk follow through. The beer has decent complexities, but the lack of carbonation on this flat beer was an issue."
"niet mijn ding echt wel zoet en de geur is niet aangenaam"

"Definitely notes of strawberry and sour lacto. Pretty awesome flavor, nice nose, great color. Would definitely get this again."

"O: While this beer isn't quite as refined and flavorful as some of Hanssens' other offerings, it is solid and drinkable."

"an odd Lambic.  good carbonation and clarity.  no head just a small film.  golden and light rose color.  smell is funky with hints of berry.  not a deep great funky.  mouthfeel does not get dry.  more like a wine taste that is slightly sweet and a little it of tart but nothing special.  overall flavor leaves you wanting something better.  would not recommend."

"A first try for me. This Lambic was incredibly interesting. Right when I popped it open, a wafted aroma of funk and musty lust braised my snout. As it was poured into a pint glass, the color arranged itself into a nice, murky, hazy reddish-orangish-slightly-brownish hue. I examined its innards and saw a little bit of what looked like strawberry seeds floating. As I brought the glass to my lips, that musty aroma I first smelt became strong with force. It tickled the inside of my nose and I could almost taste the concoction on the back of my tongue. The first sip just about made me cough. In a good, exciting way. The first flavor I noticed was a green olive, acidic, vinegarish taste. I was oddly intrigued by this as I usually discern these flavors in my beer. But I LIKED it! As I got through and through this bottle, those strawberry notes became more apparent. And by the end, my throat was scorched, my palate was wrecked, and I was internally satisfied. I even let my room mate try a sip (who does not drink craft beer regularly) and it almost made him throw up."

"Overall: Definitely a solid lambic, but I actually think it would benefit from being a little LESS sour (this is not something I say/type often). The intense sourness overtakes some of the berry nice berry and funk character that's going on underneath. Worth picking up if you can find it around $10."
""
""
"Overall, an interesting take on the lambic style, as most fruit lambics either stick to some old standbys--cherries, raspberries, blackberries, etc.--or they are sugary sweet messes a la Lindeman's. I'm not sure I would buy this particular Hanssens again, but this is another beer that shows that they seem to know their way around a sour beer or three."

"This is a fantastic fruit lambic. The notes are numbered, but they're fascinating."
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is very simple, light, nothing harsh nothing lasting."
"O: This is not an easy drinking beer as it is quite sour and pretty much lacks any carbonation (to speak of). I would only recommend this beer to folks that really enjoy their sours, not for the novice to the style."
""

""
""
"O: got the strawberry notes in the nose, but flavor was lacking. this might have helped with the strong cheese and funk notes."
""
""
"O: The strawberry aroma/flavor here is really nice, but it's a very sour beer that's flat. This kind of bracing acidity needs carbonation to carry it."
""

"like nothing else on the market, one of the best uses of strawberries I have ever come across. pours dense and golden, pushing brassy, with some more sediment as the bottle gets low. literally no head or bubbles at all, completely still, not totally appealing to be honest, but I trust its sourness right away. as soon as the cork is off, this beer starts emitting tartness and funky sour all over the shop. I can smell it in my jawline, a mouthwatering brew here, with unripe fruit and lacto notes, as well as some oak, complex and just so damn sour, consecration style. the taste comes in two waves. the first is a berry, but not specifically strawberry tartness, fresh and addicting, sour of course, but not as pucker as the nose. some wheat malt and long fermentation characteristics are evident, as well as an acidity that is quite intense. the second wave, after a second or so pause, is a full bore watery mouth, salivation and drool from the sourness finally catches up with me, its about as much as my palate can handle. like strawberries that are still pink and white, although if I didn't know it, im not sure I would have been able to say strawberry specifically. I hate that its still though, it needs bubbles to percolate this into my palate, and its obviously missing. it needs to move, and it stagnates. still, the acidity is enough to make it finish quickly and drink easy enough. one of the more sour beers ive had, and a great use of fresh fruit. expensive but worth it to try."

"O - I prefer cherry lambics but this was tasty and interesting."

"OVERALL: A bit too moldy and funky on the nose for me, but the flavor was much more balanced and included more of the tartness and acidity that I tend to enjoy. Enjoyable and refreshing on a warm day, though a little more cabonation is needed to make this one worth while. I'll try another batch, but will pass on this one for now."

"pretty good, the strawberry may be one of my least favorite fruits used in lambic but its interesting and different. i would drink this again, but only here and there."
""

"Pours a cloudy yellow/gold with absolutely no head at all. Smells like a lambic, but much more faintly so than some of the notorious cherry versions. Taste is light, mildly sour, and has a mellowness to it that I have not had in this style before. I'm not sure I would have identified strawberry if it weren't noted on the label, as it is not a strong, powerful flavor. However, knowing they were in the mix, you get a sense of ""oh yeah, I can get a taste of them"" as the sour element fades away into just a light, barely-present sour coating on your tongue and teeth. Overall, a really refreshing beer, but in its style, there are others that have a bit more of a 'wow' factor."
""
"Overall- I can't get into the sours without carbonation. This is the second I've had and I doubt I'll try anymore. Taste was great, but it needs bubbles."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with little to no carbonation, as befitting the style. Despite the lack of carbonation, this does not stagnate on the palate: the sourness easily moves this along. Closes semi-dry, with little sweetness or stickiness on the palate."
""
""
"Overall, I'd like it much better with some bubbles and realize flat is appropriate for the style. It's quite pricey at $15 per 12oz. and not really worth it to me."
""

"Bottle from Samâ€™s in Durham. Served in a Hanssens tumbler. Hazy peach color. Beautiful strawberry nose. Not at all faded. Moderate lactic and strong strawberry. Very good."
""
"The strawberries in the aroma are lovely but somewhat overshadowed by the assertive lemon juice in the flavor a bit."
""
"OVERALL: Smells incredibly of strawberry, which fades in the taste and stays sour. Drinks like an unblended Lambic, as carbonation is minimal even from Hanssens standards. Still, I found this to be enjoyable. A nice dry sour from Belgium."
""

"O - Pretty tasty, and I'm glad I tried it, but for the price there are other gueuze/lambics I would go to first, especially since I didn't get a ton of strawberry out of this."
""
"O: Balanced, clean, and smooth. Fun to drink at a great beer bar in a sweet town!"
"Not my style."
""
""
"I've been eyeing this one for a long time now. It pours a light bodied bright gold in color with a slightly pinkish hue, slightly cloudy and with no head or bubbles. The nose is what I expected from Hannsens, nice acidity, moderate funk, and a strawberry juice aspect that offers a touch of berry sweetness. The flavors are interested. Of course there is the acid and funky yeast but it has an odd juicy strawberry sweetness. It's kind of earthy and vinous. The mouthfeel is also a little flat. It's ok. I know there aren't many strawberry lambics out there but to me this tastes like a Geueze with Strawberry juice added. It's ok but being more expensive than their gueuze or kriek, I would prefer one of those any day."
""
""
""
"O- I love Hanssens, and I love fruit in my lambic. Great beer. I assume that this and other Hanssens would have much higher scores if they were more carbonated like the Cantillon. However, I am fine with Hanssens and the lack of simple-syrup that Cantillon adds to produce beautiful intense carbonation in there beers. One of my favs, and way, way, way better than the upland strawberry which lacks funk."
""
""
""
""
"O- A great fruit lambic, gentle acidity balances out lambic funk and mixes with strawberry well"
"Not horrible, but far from a top of the line beer. There are some issues, but overall the strawberry is somewhat pleasant if not a bit too tart at times."
""
""
""
"This beer was incredible definitely one of my favorite of the lambics."
""
"Overall: I've had a few Hanssens lambics and this one is a notch above some of the other fruit iterations I've encountered from them. Nice balance, but for something touting strawberries, I'd like to see a bit more fruit in the taste."
""
""
""
"Not the best lambic I've had but better than most out there. Glad I got to try this one."
""
""
""
"O: an alright beer, this beer is overly sour and undercarbonated. A bit difficult to get through."
"O- Not sure age had immensely helped this or not? Perhaps if it was lighter.on the palate and had less acetone, it would help. As is, I wouldn't care to drink again."
"A difficult one, very sour, big difference between smell and taste. But in all good."
""
""
"O - Truly one of the weirdest brews I've had to date."
""
""
""
""
"This was an interesting experience. The highest beer I've ever rated was a straight unblended lambic from the barrel; completely flat. Although I found that experience to be outstanding, this one is far from that. The beer is ugly, and feels awkward. I expected carbonation, where previously I had not, that totally flavored my experience. Although thrown off, I was not completely disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very sour, very funky - just not all that interesting. The lack of carbonation doesn't help, either. I'm not a big fan of this one."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O - this is the best lambic I've had. It's so perfect. I love every part about it."

"Good beer, would have liked it more if the strawberry was more forceful and it was made with carbonation like an oude kriek style. Good pickup on the journey through lambic land though."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Iâ€™m finding this beer is surprisingly drinkable. Given the aromas and flavors and some of the descriptions I read before buying it I didnâ€™t expect to enjoy it so much, but I think that this beer suffers from the inadequacy of words alone to convey the rich complexity of a sensory experience like this. I wonâ€™t hesitate to buy another bottle of this one when I encounter it. Its not something for every night but it is definitely a treat. My overall impression is of a beer that is extraordinarily complex and that I personally am giving high marks based on that complexity and the fact that Iâ€™m enjoying this one so much."
"Overall quite a fun ride that moves from strawberry to lemon sour and even salty ocean saltiness. I am not sure if the appearance is to be this sort of ""flat"" but otherwise alright. Checking upon other reviews, appearance is about the norm. So I call good on that."
"O- I always love Hanssens sours. This is not the best but still very good. Lack of carbonation is somewhat disappointing but like i said not a big deal either. Nice and tart like i like em'. Easy drinking sour that i would love to enjoy again."
"O- This is a bright crisp crude beer with a touch of fruit and maybe a strawberry hint when it is very warm as well as some septic qualities that come through. The tartness is full and everything is well blended. It was a nice beer but didn't have an dominating flavors, everything was subtle except the sour."
"O - I enjoyed the strawberry flavor in this lambic, but as a whole, it's missing that classic funk and sourness in the flavor and finish."
"This beer is a success on every levels except for the taste. Great funk aroma and a mouthfeel that is exactly what I'd expect from the style. However, the flavor profile here is very one sided. Worth a try and probably even worth aging to see what happens a while down the line."
"Almost a year later and another batch, I get just a touch more strawberries. Its still a sour, tart lambic with some accent flavors. Perfect use of strawberries."
"O: Not sure what happened with the carbonation on this one, but it definitely affects the overall experience. The aroma is pretty awesome, if not surprisingly devoid of any funk and kinda sweet, but smelling the bottle did yield some tart funkiness. Also for containing strawberries Iâ€™m very surprised with the color. Itâ€™s in no way red or pinkish. Looks like a legit, no frills lambic. Overall this is pretty good and Iâ€™d probably drink it again. 3.5"
"O-Best strawberry based lambic I've had."
"O: Has some nice flavor notes, but falls pretty far short overall with what is just too flat a beer. I understand lambics and gueuzes aren't the most bubbly of beers, but this has nothing at all, and really needs something."
"This beer pours a straw yellow color with a few buboes around the edge it is nearly still. The nose is funky tart apples slightly sour. The flavor follows suit with a good bit of sourness but nothing over the top the strawberry flavor is noticeable. The mouthfeel is light slightly Puckering and barely any carbonation just like a true lambic. I would definitely recommend this one to any one who wants to try sours that are not to off putting."
"O: A really, really funky-fresh barynard lemondrop. Best enjoyed in a dirt cellar after shoveling horse shit for a day in Brussels. Highly recommended."
"Overall I would say this was a let down the same way opening up an uncarbed, 15$ beer from any other brewery is a let down. I bet it's delicious when properly conditioned"
"O: So so I guess. By far the weakest offering from a brewery I love."
"Overall a good lambic. I tend to prefer my fruit lambics more carbonated, but this one was still pretty tasty."
"Pours a cloudy murky orange color with barely a bubble from a very vigorous pour. The nose is very pleasant with lots of strawberries, a lactic sourness, a touch of oak, and a hint of barnyard. Taste is quite tart with lemons and some vinegar. The strawberry comes in to only partially sweeten the sour. Earthy funky musty come through before once again turning tart and lingering on the palette long after every sip. Almost non-existent carbonation, medium body, with a tart mouth puckering feel. I would have loved some carbonation in this bad boy! As is its decent but probably something I wouldn't purchase again."
"Overall just wow, the original bottle is one of the best lambics I can remember, but the ones since have just been so-so. hard to judge the score on which one, so I'll try to average them."
"Very nice, huge acidity in the middle and lightens slightly in the finish. Funk galore, horse blanket throughout, cereal type malts on deep in the finish. Tongue puckering body. Fruity and earthy at the front and middle with wood tones everywhere. Hints of strawberry, earth, and other tart fruits. Delicious."
"O - very nice beer. Stood the test of time. A great beer."
"Overall, I wouldn't buy this again under any circumstance. A below average lambic with some weird stuff going on. Pass."
"The mouthfeel is epicly tart. Almost zero carbonation. Needs some carbonation to break up the tartness. 2.5"
"Overall: I consider Hannsens' original version of the lambic to be average at best from the start. I just thought that perhaps the bourbon might have been its secret weapon to sway me, but I was dead wrong. It actually made it worse. I think that was probably the last straw and won't be returning to Hanssens' offering of a lambic anymore."
"O- The more I sip this the more I enjoy it. I have had better Lambics, but this is still good. I feel that if it had more strawberry flavor and some more carbonation it would be a great beer."
"No trouble finishing my glass, going for the Oude Kriek from Hanssens next tonight."
"O- A little disappointed there wasn't a more noticeable taste of strawberries, but still a good sour lambic. Still love their Oude Kriek though."
"No head. Hazy Orange color. Nose is super funky and earthy. Lots of woodiness and horse blanket. Nose has a little bit of strawberry blossoms. Palate is super funky and sour with zero carbonation. Hardly any fruit on the palate. Lots of wood and mulch. Long finish. More finesse than their other offerings. Disappointed with the lack of strawberry character that comes across, but a nice lambic nonetheless."
"My second from Hanssens and another one that I like. I wouldn't say they're as good as say, Cantillon, but they have their own unique character that is very interesting. Some might be turned off by the lack of carbonation, but it doesn't really detract. I would like to see the difference between one that was carbonated though for comparison's sake."
"D- this isnt my favorite offering from hanssens, and certainly not my favorite of this style. i dont think ill be picking this one up again. maybe its past its prime?"
"Pours an orangy-yellow color. Slight haze. Carbonation level is low. Little head on pour. Both the smell and flavor have a serious brettanomyces character. I feel like it ate everything there was to eat in the ten years in the bottle. Very very dry. Brett lends an interesting cherry flavor. Oakiness is apparent. Very sour and highly acidic. Mouthfeel is thin, like what I would expect in a Saison. Only a very slight strawberry flavor to speak of. It could be placebo and my brain wanting the berry flavor."
"Pours a hazy light red color with absolutely zero head or lacing. Random floating sediment can be seen in the glass. Very suspicious. Smells strongly of skunk spray, funk/must, vinegar. Hmm alright, lambics can smell this way somewhat, but I am even more suspicious. The taste confirms everything I was wary about. Very skunky, very sour, very musty, very funky, very salty - all in a horrible and disgusting way. This is one of the worst tasting beers I have ever had. Just layer upon layer of awful. Beer is absolutely flat, which makes the taste that much worse. It's like a big glass of flat vinegar soda mixed with fermented strawberry mold. Overall, this is an abomination of a beer. I don't know if this is a bad bottle but I hope to all that is good that it is. I am pissed that I spent $10 on this one."
"D-the more I tasted this one, the grosser it got. this was a drain pour, i would never even use this as marinade for meats...its just awful"
"O: Too intense for my palate. The sourness and tannins are overwhelming. No body or sweetness to balance. And considering the price ($11/375mL) makes it a horrible value. Sorry guys, I appreciate the attempt to make natural products in traditional style, but this does not mean that balance of flavour can be overlooked."
"Verdict: Too expensive to drink when it's not fresh. Look elsewhere."
"D - Despite the carbonation, I'm really enjoying this one. Very tart and complex, another great Lambic from Hanssens."
"Beer is super tart and really sour on the finish. There is a dirty blanket after taste and this odd sourness that sticks to my gums. The aftertaste is overwhelming. Hard to process. I think I might be blind. This is about the most sour thing I've ever tasted. There is a shadow of woody oak that reaches out of the back of my throat and tries to strangle me. Beer is also thicker than I thought it would be but still finishes really dry. The second drink was much better than the first. Its mellowing and growing on me. Strawberries? Really? I don't think so. This is like a harsh, sour, tart, unblended, flat lambic. I like it."
"Pours a deep yellow/orange with a pinkish hue. Pours nearly flat just a few bubbles in a partial ring. Smells funky, citrusy and sour. I get oak but don't get any strawberry. The taste is very sour, oak, strawberries. A bit moldy in the taste too. Body is light +. Overall a bit tough to deal with the lack of carbonation."
"D- Tasty brew, not an intense sour lambic, pretty easy drinking."
"I will be getting this again."
"Pours a hazy peach color with zero head whatsoever. Perfumey sour aroma with lemons and freeze-dried strawberries. It's got that deep, refreshing tartness that you only smell in the best lambics. Flavor packs a nice sour wallop with ultra-tart strawberry notes and that dried strawberry sweetness. A little unripe stone fruit at times and a bit of hay bale as well. Once the tongue acclimates to the sourness, some honeyed malts come through to provide a touch of balance. A completely still beer, but the sourness acts in place of CO2 to refresh the palate. Very dry despite a body medium in heft."
"All things considered, the drinkability was quite good. But I was happy with my half of the 375ml that I shared with a friend."
"Man I must have scored a good bottle of this, because this is a really tasty beer. I really love how the strawberry integrates into this beer. Well done!"
"D: If you have one of these 2000 vintages, I suggest you drink it with a friend, or sip slowly."
"Drinkability: The odd funkiness of this one slowed down consumption considerably"
"What a strange and interesting beer! $9 was too much for a tiny bottle but this was a fun one to try. The thing that struck me the most was how different the taste was from the smell."
"D - I'll drink this anytime, anywhere."
"Overall, not my most favorite offering from Hanssens but alright. I prefer other fruit lambics over this but an interesting use of strawberry."
"Well, what this one lacks in depth is sure as hell makes up for in balls to the wall flavor. Big and fruity and sour and overall extremely tasty. Meant for small doses though unless you don't mind burning a hole in your esophagus."
"D: Drank a bit slower that I would have liked. Really enjoyed the funk... just wished there was a bit more strawberry to go with the acidity."
"If you're looking for a sour lambic (I'm not, generally) this might float your boat, but as a fruit lambic, it's not working for me. Definitely wouldn't try it again."
"One of my few disappointments with true belgian lambics."
"(D)- A good lambic. Not extraordinary, but an easy drinking one with a nice freshness to it."
"D -- A solid representation of the style, I wish I had the access and the patience to get a fresh one and age one for this long in the same vintage year for a solid comparison."
"edit: after having a relatively fresh bottle, I realized how lucky i was to find a bunch of old bottles. the fresher is a lot more tart and sour, and definitely loaded with strawberries. still an awesome beer, but needs a few more years to come in to it's own. laying a few of these down is a great idea."
"D. Drinkability is low for me. I can't get past how sour this is. Its pretty tongue curling sour. The Strawberry flavor is of the unripened variety, which really isnt my cup of tea. A little carbonation might do this beer a lot of good and take some of the edge of the sourness."
"It's relative mellowness makes it more approachable on the sour scale, but it's not for the beginner/faint of heart/pregnant/weak stomach/acid reflux prone. One to sip and savor, for the hardcore lambic lovers out there."
"Bottle. Year 2000 edition. $8.99 for a 12.7oz bottle. Pours an opaque deep honey orange flavor with zero head and no real carbonation to speak of. Strong aroma of sourness mixed with fruit, in this case strawberry. Some vinegar noted in the nose. Tart and dry are the 2 words that come to mind after my first sip. Some acetone flavors as well. The zero carbonation doesn't help really although I realize that no carbonation is typical of this age and maybe style. The more I have it the more I kind of like it. Probably not a ""beer"" for everyone but for those that like dry, sour beers, its fairly decent. I'll probably end up with a bottle or 2 to put in the cellar."
"Poured into a Chimay glass it looked like apple juice. The only hint of carbonation I could find was a few bubbles on my tongue. Couldn't taste the strawberry but could smell it a bit. Sipping and taking huge swigs it tasted good. I'm not sure about the taste. It is kind of sour, definitely not sweet. This almost tastes like white wine? My first lambic and after this, I can imagine I will try to seek out more. I'll definitely get another bottle. This is probably something good for sitting on the porch on a hot day."
"Medium bodied and firm. Quick, short finish, and dry. Just the slightest hint of carbonation, but not viscous as I'd expect. I imagine this is quite a bit better when fresh."
"Pours hazy light orange, nearly still. Is it still young? Given the use of strawberries, it is strangely not red, nor does the color seem to be affected at all by the strawberries. On the nose, the strawberry is definitely present (I could smell it off the cork) and quite nice. I also get an elderflower aroma, which I often detect in fruit lambics, with a cidery component. Flavor has a nice sourness with a slight tea astringency. Strawberry lambics are rare, but this one is great."
"Note: 2000 vintage"
"Flat beer stored under florescent lights at the store. Poured with no head and of course no lace. Aroma was skunky, a friend nearby smelled it right away. Color is a clear amber. Aroma also has the malt yeast and strawberries. Flavor is like aroma. Body isn't so hot being flat. Ditto with finish. Wish I could a had a better one."
"Wow - tart and sour as hell with a very nice and prevalent strawberry presence. Lack of carbonation is a bit of a downer, but I am surprisingly still loving this beer, a delightful sensory experience. Damn I love lambics! Just enough sweetness to counteract some of the sourness. Has a nice bit of 'funk' in here as well. As the bottle drains, it becomes more tart than sour as the palate adjusts fairly quickly to the sour aspect. There is also a mild rubbery flavor that has me thinking brettomyces might be involved here. I wish I had 20 more of these around, awesome beer. Lack of CO2 is the only thing keeping this from an A+ in my book."
"D: I could drink this stuff all day but will probably pay for it with heart burn. Not a bad offering from the hanssens blenders."
"D - Needs some carbonation but not bad. Strawberry is stronger than I expected."
"D- I like it enough, not enough to buy this same year again, I just wish that there was more to the mouth feel here."
"- eh its drinkable enough but is in dire need of some carb. This stuff is lacking the crispness that some carb would bring to give it a rounder profile. Interesting flavor but just not the best lambic I've had."
"Overall considering there was nearly no carbonation, this is a good example for the style. Although there was no carbonation, there was a medium body. I am sure a newer vintage would be more representative of the style, but I cannot complain too much."
"D: A solid lambic. The complexity isn't great, but a nice drinkable brew. Too expensive for what you get though."
"D: Between the stench of this bottle and a lackluster experience with my first, I'm not convinced this is a beer I really need to try again. Lambics are hard to find, and I'm sure they're hard to make, but this isn't a compelling example."
"Drinkability is above average. Overall, still not the biggest fan of Hanssens."
"D-Without question a finely made lambic. Super crisp with a myriad of subtle notes that you get to discover one by one. A most interesting and amazingly complex brew."
"D: Obviously rating against the style, but I find myself wanting to keep sipping in spite of the low carbonation and big blend of sour and funkiness. A very interesting beer, glad I snagged a bottle to try."
"I had another bottle of this that I got from bosse - it was significantly more carbonated, but I can't remember the vintage."
"Drinkability is high, this slides down with ease. A nice hint of strawberry but still strongly on the funky side, yet remains quaffable and clean. Yummy."
"It is a pretty good beer with a very nice smell."
"The beer is still, but the oak and acidity provide a pleasantly dry and full mouthfeel. Overall, an absolutely delicious beer and a lucky find. Highly recommended."
"Simple, direct, well aged - nature and art in a small green bottle..."
"D: I think this beer is past its prime, though still enjoyable. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to try it."
"Yeah, it's flat, but still a pretty good sour. Pretty sure it will never cross my path again."
"D: A beer that I've been wanting to try, but it is quite acetic and sour. A bit more dryness would have been nice, and perhaps a little more fruit character."
"Pours yellow orange with a minimal white head. The aroma is very tart, with some vinegar and some funk. The taste is very tart with some sour strawberries and other fruit. There is also a little bit of funk but it pales in comparison to the pure tartness. Light mouthfeel and very drinkable. Very dry finish."
"My guess? The bottle had been sitting on the shelf of the beer shop in Amsterdam for quite some time."
"Dark reddish gold, crystal clear (does that mean that is has no live yeast?). Sour strawberries in the aroma and the flavour. Some notes of citrus, and maybe apples in the background. Usual horse-blanketness with a bit of acidity but not much sourness. No head at all. A nice lambic."
"Light pink body with hardly any head. Smell is sinus-clearingly tart. Flavor continues with the tartness with just a hint of strawberry that you have to work for. Leathery aftertaste. This may be blasphemy against the lambic gods, but I think Hanssens beers have more going on than Cantillon. With the latter, I just get unrelenting sourness. This one, one the other hand, seemed to have a bit more nuance."
"EDIT: I looked over the other reviews after I posted mine and saw that d0b has given this same vintage a very bad review. It also looks like he got his bottle at West Lakeview Liqours, which is where I gat mine. I think that he may have just had a bad bottle. I say this because he comments that he's had it before and really enjoyed it, but it was a different vintage. I know that taste is subjective, and I'm not saying that he's wrong, by any means. I just think he may have gotten a 'cooked' bottle or something. (I generally agree with most of his reviews, which is why I find the differences between these to be odd.)"
"This now is my new favorite brew in this category and one of my favorites in any category. Very refreshing, very quaffable and above all, very interesting!"
"Had this earlier at Delerium in Brussels a the recommendation of the bar manager, loved it then."
"D: Very good. Good balance between acidity and sweet strawberry flavors."
"Like most 6% sours, I drained the bottle rather quickly."
"Drinkability: It was an interesting drink. I enjoyed it but, would definitely have to share a 750 with a friend or 2."
"D: Super drinkable. The lacto is really strong and you can feel it in your gut after a while. That never stopped me though."
"Overall, definitely not my favorite that I've sampled in the style. By no means terrible, it's just lacking something..."
"This certainly isn't for the faint of heart or casuale Lindemans Framboise drinker. If you don't like tart/bitter stay away. I liked it!"
" Would not get it again, for the price, there are much better ones out there."
"I read a few reviews on this brew and I have no idea where they're coming from. I was recommended this brew and would happily recommend it to anyone else that sees it on their local shelves. The play on the fruitiness is incredibly enjoyable while there's a nice solid puckering quality that keeps me coming back."
"D - This is an interesting lambic. Not sure I'm a fan of strawberry flavor in a beer."
"M&D: flat-bodied, musty/funky to bits, with a super-light fruitiness from the strawberries that are said to be used in the brew. Perhaps I've never tasted any strawberry-lambic as understated as this one, but something tells me that this bottle is not pretty right, as this level of carbonation (next to none) is not even quite right for a bottled lambic. That said, the lambic base still shows a degree of decency in quality that can't be brushed off that easily. This is ""Hanssens", so nothing should go too wrong, I take it?"
"Unusual and tasty beer."
"7/3/7/3/16/3.6"
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"D: See above. Not very drinkable."
"Pours a light blush/ amber color with a very thin, fizzy pinkish-white head that quickly dissapears. Funky aroma with hints of strawbeery and cream as well as an earthy, oak presence. Slightly watered down, with very little carbonation and a slightly funky, earthy oak flavor. Not very acidic and very easy to drink with with a slight puckering strawberry, floral flavor."
"Very tart and drying. The fruitiness mixes in with other characteristics. Other than needing some water mid-way because of tartness and dryness, very drinkable. Not an ""intro to style"" type lambic, it's a drink for true lovers of tart lambics."
"Overall - A pretty good lambic although a bit more (or maybe some at all !!) strawberry flavour would have been good... worth a try..."
"Drinkibiliby is very personal. Way too much sour here for my tastes but it still is a great beer from a great brewery. Go Hanssens!"
"The glorious but delicate strawberry character that this beer had fresh has fallen off, but not by much. As it breathes, it does grow in prominence, with a fairly complex fruit character. Delicate strawberries with some seed tannins (not as intense as raspberry lambics, though). For a Hanssens lambic, this smells surprisingly mellow, and it is so on the palate as well, with a fairly oak and vanilla forward lambic base with a sourness that brings to mind rotting lemons, less some sweetness, and some lactic acid. Fairly slick on the palate. The strawberries are still fairly noticeable on the palate, lending a sweetness and acidity to complement the lemony lambic. Funk character is quite low here, apart from a mild earthiness on the mid-palate, there isn't much. This is one aspect that I wish had a little more complexity to it. Quite oaky on the finish with vanilla and tannins to add the low level of carbonation that's present. Oh, and it doesn't really need much carbonation for the flavor profile IMO. I never thought I'd say it, but this is a fairly mellow and easy-drinking Hanssens beer, one I could drink multiples of. Enjoyable, recommended, unique. 4/4/3.5/4/3.5"
"Nice copper brown color and no head. The nose has tart strawberries, funky manure, and sweet fruity malts. The taste has a sour funk up front and finishes with sour strawberries. Nice crisp body goes down well. A powerfull lambic, but well balanced. However I think using raspberries or cherries would make a better brew. I'll have to keep an eye out for the Oude Kriek."
"No head whatsoever. Pours a light brown yet clear. Smell was very sour and urine-like. There were notes of wood and other citrus. The taste was extreme. Very sour and barely detectable berry. It tasted very much like a home-made mead a friend made but had a spoiled quality. This is nothing like any other lambics I've tried. Mouthfeel is much like a wine or mead. Zero carbonation. Zero. This was a drain pour. Nobody of the four friends I had over that night could tolerate even but a small sip. Just absolutely dreadful."
"good drinkability, it's got a good tart fruit flavor and a very palatable amount of funk. it's pretty refreshing. like i said previously, a little bit of a one trick pony, but very nicely put together."
"label claims ""year 2000"" but the label, bottle, cork and contents look young. It smells quite funky, fantastic. The taste is tart lambic with a noticeable strawberry component. Nice lambic even if it is a little acidic."
"a very nice lambic (especially since I scored it for $3.99), if you want a more geuze-ish type of lambic you will probably enjoy this one.. and cantillon fans should equally enjoy this (although not as tart as many cantillon offerings)"
"Mouthfeel is overall sour."
"This thing is brutal. Pretty orange/ honey color with zero head. Serious aroma of straw trampled into the mud outside of a barn by hoofed animals. My vet-tech friend has more intimate animal comparisons not fit to print. Overly funkety funk. Tart and funky - tastes like I fell into a sheep pen and then had one of the sheep step in my mouth. Serious beer geeks need to quit the IBU drama and come to lambic country. It's the final test. While I approached this with an open mind understanding in advance what lambics are supposed to be all about, I had to give it miserable drinkability, because I just can't hack it. Not on the heavy level that Hanssens brings the funk. This shit is the real deal."
"Thought this might be sweeter than it was- glad to see that it wasn't and I should have trusted this brewery not to release one of the sugary fake lambics that seem so popular. This is probably the only strawberry lambic I've ever had. Poured a murky golden with no head or carbonation. Not unusual in a real lambic. Aromas of light, sweet strawberry up front, followed by a nice mellow sourness and some funky barnyard smells. Classic. The taste is similar- sweet strawberry turns to sour funk while in the mouth with the typical slightlt bitter taste of damp hay and horseblanket right at the end. The mouthfeel is still, smooth, and even a bit creamy- nice trick, that. Quite decent if not quite transcendant. I'd definitely have another."
"Notes - This lambic paired extremely well with spicy Indian food."
"Absolutely no head on a clouded orange pour. Nose is so tart that when I took a whiff immediately after pouring, I pulled my head back and elicited the word: ""Whoa!"" There is a fair amount of fruit there and a pretty mild wood tone as well. Overall it just smells of funky lambic goodness. Flavor is so sour that it bites. I am no novice to lambic, but this one is still kicking me a bit hard. After that initial taste, the buds seem used to it more and you get a less abrasively sour tone and a bit of wet wood. Very minimal fruit influence here. Barely visible to the palate. Feel is extremely low on carbonation. So much so that it might not even feel like there is some to certain people. Liquid is smooth, but also a bit sticky/slimy. Drinkable, yes. But certainly not the smoothest lambic ever created. Seems a bit harsh in certain aspects."
"Body seems pretty light with light pinpoints of carbonation. Refreshing and surprisingly drinkable. I wished we were sharing a 750 rather that the little 33."
"I paired this with some Taleggio cheese and homemade pumpernickel bread, and while the aroma matched the cheese quite well, the flavors were a bit dissonant."
"""Chris, you certainly don't mind killing a guy, now do you?"" as he hands me a glass of this beer with no warning whatsoever. Lambics? Of course their tart. Smells so, but with a sour fruit scent. ...But then, here comes the sharp raw, intense flavors of sour (not tart) Lambic uniqueness. Followed by an under-rippened strawberry, and other young berries (cranberries, raspberries, crab apples, lime). The flavors slowly morph into an increadibly sour, astringent mouthfeel the sucks all of the moisture from my body. Soon dawns on me that this may be the most sour beer I've had. At least the mouth-puckering, sweaty look that I'm giving. Mildly salty, musty, and earthy with some other flavors that I detect before my tastebuds give up. No doubt this is a quality Lambic, but the intensity of textures make it tough to fully appreciate. Thanks again Clvand0."
"This is a once in a blue moon brew. I couldn't imagine approaching this more than a couple times a year."
"Overall: I liked this beer. I got it at the Liars Club. I am sure glad they suggested it."
"Cork came off without pop and was poured into a New Belgium snifter. No head and very little carbonation ( which I hear is normal). Smells of Barnyard funk, mixed with strawberries and a slight sulfur smell. Color was hazy golden orange color. Taste was an acidic strawberry flavor on the front followed by a strong tart greenapple aftertaste. The flavor was good but lack of mouthfeel do to low carbonation made it come of tea-ish vs bright and poping."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden, thin white head forms, some lace spots, settles down to a thin ring. Smell is insane, very harsh, citrus acidity, yeast, super barnyard, musty hay, burnt almost sulphurous aroma, like burnt bread. Taste is crazy too, very sour and acidic, lemon, honey, burnt bread astringency, charred wood, funk, more acidity. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Crazy beer, I give respect to anything that makes me wince in a good way now. Really challenges the palate, worth a shot if you like funky stuff."
"Recommended."
"375 ml corked and caged bottle. Label claims ""Limited Edition Year 2000," but there's a sticker on the neck with a hand-written ""02"" on it...No pop with the cork release...Pours utterly still, a brassy golden hue and absolutely no head. Sweet strawberry aromas hit my nostrils from at least two feet away. Closer sniffs reveal tart green grape skin scents along with wild berry and leather aromas. Sweaty brett funk finishes out the bouquet. Brash flavor up front. Impudently tart in a nearly cloying (but not quite) way: slight acetic twang accompanies a sour grape and underripe raspberry acidity. Paint-stripping dryness in the finish, which is quite tannin-heavy, fairly woody, and slightly peppery. Phenolic funk all the way through the swallow. This beer's weakest point is its mouthfeel. It's got the dryness I enjoy in lambics, but its complete lack of carbonation makes each sip rather heavy and slick. Very much like a brett-infected dry white wine -- to my palate, at least. An interesting experience to be sure, but I have doubts about this one's ability to withstand more than a couple of years' worth of aging. It's always possible that this is a bad bottle, though..."
"A most pleasant lambic, not sweet and only a bit on sour, lemon juice vinegar side, dryish. The strawberry comes out, it's something special.Pinkish tinge. Appropriate carbonation.No head. Goes picnic lunch well, and could be a starter to the style.Thanks Boutip."
"Mouthfeel was mouth-coating tartness. Medium body. Very drinkable."
"Overall: This is a unique lambic. The strawberry go very good with the oak, rustic, and spices in the lambic. I wish other lambic producers would venture into using strawberries (if they haven't already). This is another exceptional lambic from this underrated (IMO) lambic blender. Definitely worth seeking out for you lambic lovers."
"Second PourÂ… My lips are stinging now as if I had just eaten a dozen raw lemons. A dog biscuit aroma has developed. My stomach is begging me to stop drinking this. I think IÂ’m being poisoned. Still, my mouth screams for more. What a feel this has and itÂ’s ever so unique. If only I could get more of this. Time to start building a collection Oudbeitje. If 7 years has made it this good, I feel like IÂ’m sinning when I think of what 10 or 15 years could do. If you see this beer buyÂ…and then send it to me."
"Drinkability: Certainly not a session beer by any means. Too much sour beer and you'll be hitting the tums in the morning, like I did after this tasting. I would definately seek this out if you can get it for a decent price."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a deep and clear golden honey. Quite still; without head or lace. Smells simultaneously acidic and sweet. Sharp barnyard funk and mustiness are well-balanced by softly rounded strawberry fruit. Intriguingly subtle flavor development. Gentle initial fruitiness turns sour in the center, with barnyard and leather notes dominating. These are followed by fleeting velvet strawberry and vanilla tones. The finish is tangy and acidic, brining some stinging alcohol and the suggestion of green strawberry seeds. Medium body is completely flat, but not needlessly heavy. Very nice."
"The pour is a golden honey lacking a real head of any kind. Their is a weird suspension and haze the stays right in the center column of that amber honey. A few bubbles pass through, but not many. The arom is a funky, earthy mess. makes me think of a refinery or old wet shoes. The taste gives some tart hint of strawberries, but not much. A very fiery tartness overwhelms the senses. Very acidic. I know lambics are supposed to be funky and tart, but give me a break. I will never buy this beer again."
"Overall: Initially I wasn't impressed, but it really grew on me as I drank it."
"This is a really wild example of a Lambic beer, and it was a good experience. I couldn't drink a lot of this beer, but I am glad that I got to try it (Thanks, John!). I wonder about the fact that it says ""lambic"" on the label, and not a Gueuze. I am guessing that this means that it is a bottled straight lambic like Cantillon's Brouscella. If this was the case, it would make it even more appealing to try again over and over and over... I would recommend this beer, but it is not for the faint of palate."
"Bottle: Poured a light red/brown color lambic with no head or carbonation. Aroma of funk and horse blanket is quite strong with some very subtle strawberry in the back. Taste is mix of sour and funky lambic with an extra dose of horse blanket with some faint strawberry also noticeable. Not sure if this lack some aging or if the balance is wrong but definitely not one the best lambic fruit that I have tasted."
"I personally would not drink this particular one very often. It was not really sweet and was very sour. However, I think if you typically enjoy the style this might be a good one to try."
"A tricky fruit lambic; The fruit is all there, but the dominant sourness is just a little too much in this beer. DonÂ’t get me wrong, I like lambics and geuezes, but this one just wasnÂ’t balanced the way I like it."
"It feels balanced in the taste."
"The label reads Â“limited edition 2000.Â” The cork is removed with a notable Â“pop,Â” and the brew pours a light gold color with a bit of haze and virtually no head. What an amazing aroma: musty and earthy with a serious acidic note. A very nice strawberry nose comes through almost immediately, and was far stronger than I expected. It smelled vaguely like small wild strawberries, not the plump farm variety. The taste is very nice: sour and earthy. Musty, funky, mouth-puckering, and dry. The strawberry flavor is very prominent in the taste as well. Medium mouthfeel, dry and tart finish. This is an interested beer. I was impressed with the strength of the strawberries and how they worked well with flavor of the brew. The lambic qualities could have been a little more pronounced (sourness and that earthy-funky-wildness). ItÂ’s certainty worth a try."
"Finishes with a peppery warmth, and drying with a lactic twang."
"D: I was really impressed by this beer. With a higher carbonation level it would have been extraordinary. I think the age on the bottle must have done it in. But with that age came remarkabled smoothness."
"Sour aroma that never even gets in the vicinity of sweet. Quite tart. Golden/amber color with no head at all. Fore is vinegar and then sweet strawberries and then vinegar. Mildly creamy as well. Curiously the tart vinegar flavors make the strawberry side seem unripe as if they used green strawberries. ItÂ’s interesting, but it is also failry narrow flavor wise and that can get boring quickly."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thin white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has an earthy, sour scent that boasts of half rotten strawberries and Belgian yeast. The taste is decent as well. It has a musty strawberry flavor that is earthy and quite sour. The fruit is not as pronounced as some lambics I've had. It goes down slow and very tart. Usually, these brews go down like water, but this one is different. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above beer, but just an average lambic. I won't be buying this again."
"Cloudy caramel colour with little to no head. Sour fruity aroma with a moderate strawberry component sitting on top of wood. The flavour is similar to the aroma, but the strawberry character is much more pronounced and there's more of an earthy quality to the woodiness. Pleasant, tart acidity balances the sweetness. Quite tasty and refreshing."
"12.7 ounce bottle. Limited edition year 2000. The corked opened without a sound. This beer has a mostly clear copper color with no head. There is a single chunk of something floating around near the bottom of my glass. Sour, slightly funky aroma with strawberries. The flavor is sharp and acidic with just a subtle hint of strawberries. Mostly sour, but a little sweet too. Tastes great, but the acidity is challenging. The only fault of this beer is the entirely flat body. I feared that the fruit would be overpowering in this beer, but it turned out to be a mighty tasty lambic with a hint of strawberries."
"The beer was a serious let down. The bottle had no pictures of strawberries-- I thought I was getting a non-fruit lambic! If I hadn't had quite a few examples from the lambic/gueuze style I might have sworn off the style after trying this! I'm all for funkiness, but this beer went way past anything enjoyable for me."
"Loses drinkability points in my book for being a big old donut of a beer, and that weird lingering flavor on the finish. Overall a good beer, but not up to Hannson's standard. The Oude Gueuze is their true entry in anyone's ""Masters' Collection."""
"Drinkability- Still very new to the lambic scene. Hopefully I will come across the better ones than this."
"If you are new to Lambics, I feel this one can be enjoyed on quite a few levels. If you are looking for tart or sweet or both, it is here. Not overly either. Less tart than most Cantillions, but not nearly as sweet as the LÂ’s."
"This Geuze is tolerable and the more one drinks the easier it gets."
"Tiny little pop when the cork came out. Old cheese aroma, then some of that wild yeast sourness. This beer is an old urine yellow with no head. Took awhile for bubbles to appear anywhere in the beer, but they finally arrived. Taste is wildly sequential. Starts off with nice fruit notes, probably strawberries (based on the label only, not my tastebuds) and segues into a graceful sourness...and then...bam! the sour comes in heavy and somewhat artificial. It's puckering, but doesn't seem natural. Mouthfeel, especially early on, is medium. The heavy duty puckering keeps this from being an easy quaff."
"12.7 ounce green bottle, bailed and corked. An interesting beer for sure, but not one I would go out of my way to purchase."
"Notes: This one said it was a kriek, and it would be my first real wone. Refreshing, not quite as tart as other lambics I have had. Not quite as funky as I would hope. Still very tasty."
"Drinkability and Overall: An interesting tasting beer, that somehow works. This is not as wonderful or mind-blowing as say a Cantillon or a Lindeman's, but it's still ok. Give it a shot if you're in the mood for something odd."
"It is good, very interesting, but to be honest, not something I would want more than once in a long while."
"Not rated to syle, this would have been my lowest ranked beer."
"375 ml bottle. Minimal pop behind the cork and then an immediate aroma of strawberry. Pours a brassy gold with hardly any carbonation, at least not to leave any notation of head color or retention. Horse blanket aroma mixed with a healthy dosage of strawberry. Sweet to tart ratio is right on with lots of bittersweet strawberry. I detect a slight bit of woody smokiness well into the aftertaste. A little syrupy, the carbonation is really low so it doesn't hide it very well. The strawberry seems to be a niche kind of flavor for people. I like strawberries, but this beer seems to posess some bubblegummy sweetness. Rather enjoyable, overall. A must-have for lovers of the strawberry and lambic beers."
"Pours a flat deep orange color with absolutely no head or lacing. Aromas are quite interesting for such a brew, consisting mostly of sweet floral tones and passion fruits. There are some slight acidic tones but there's just so much sweetness in the nose that it keeps these tones at bay. Flavors start off quite sweet and fruity, with flavors that just remind me of a tropical summer day and eating passion fruits. Somewhere in the mix there is an acetic tone within but for the most part it is subdued by the sweetness. The finish is slightly earthy and floral, reminding me of fresh dandelions, oak, and strawberry fields. There is also just the slightest tone of vanilla to go along with the strong sour and acetic flavors. The carbonation to this brew was just a trickle and the mouthfeel was just a bit thin. Overall this has got to be one of the most interesting lambics I have ever tasted.. I have never had one that was soo sweet and fruity while having such burst of acetic and sour tones.. Very interesting to say the least."
"I could drink a ton of these. I give it a 5 for Lambics. Not in general."
"Interesting. There's no head on the pour, but one starts to develop as the beer sits in my tulip. The color is a cloudy, peachy-orange. Small spots of lacing. The odor is sour, funky-barn, tart but with sugar underneath. There's a little burnt popcorn in there. The front is tart and fruity. The middle is flat and funky with some fermenting (almost rotting) fruit. The finish has a full fruitiness with alcohol and becomes puckeringly sour. Burning throat sour. Complex, fruity, tart. Good, but not great."
"Bottle at spuyten duyvil. No head at all, fairly still. Weird extremely clear peach color. It looks like a mix of apple and peach juice and not appealing at all in fact. The aroma catches up for the looks though with its straightforward strawberry pie nuances. Captivating sweet/tart combat. Almost as candyish as if lindemans had done it, but thereÂ’s still a hint of that hanssens funk though it would score much higher with me if this wasnÂ’t restrained so much. Actually hints of sugar powder. Palate is actually very tart. Agressively acidic finish with obvious strawberries, but like my pal martin pointed out, it just doesnÂ’t procures the classy combination cherries or raspberries do. Puckering grapeish finish, decent dose of lactic funk, unusually dry finish which seems to arrive from nowhere with such a fruity start. Medium body is almost still and detracts overall enjoyment just like the appearance did."
"Taste: For a Beer with no head, it was surprisingly effervescent and tangy. It was very tart but sweet. Not overly sweet like those pseudo-lambics, the acidity is there, just a bit more balanced. I'd say this is a good Beer to slowly rip people away from the sugary clutches of the fake lambics and push them slowly towards the real deal."
"Comments Â– This is a 2000 vintage."
"Orange color with no discernable head. Smell of wonderful puke in college after drinking tang and everclear all night (and I mean that in the best way possible). Initially acidic orange peel and aspirin taste mellows in the mouth with floral orange blossem and slight strawberry finish. The mouth is light upfront with a dry tongued finish. A great starter.. refreshing and light. This would be a great way to start the evening..."
"Overall even though I didn't drink in under the best conditions, I still enjoyed it. I'll be searching for it again."
"Pretty awesome."
"The label tells me that this is a Limited Edition Year 2000, at least 3 years old,and I have to wonder if it's age affected the head/appearance?"
"No ""pop""action at all from the uncorking. A vigorous pour does not form any sort of a head. Only the slightest of bubbly edging. Appearance is light orange with a dash of sunlight. This is one funky smelling beer. Got the horse blanket / barnyard thing going on. And also a little mixture of sweet and sour. Good nose. This beer has got no carbonation at all. Flat to say the least. Like kool aid. The taste is quite acidic and biting. Mouth puckering to a large degree. And tart. Lemon juice in a big way. Grass and hay. Acetic acid. The taste is o.k., but the mouthfeel really drags this beer down for me."
"375ml bottle. Limited Edition year 2000. Pours a pink tinged light amber, with no head. Aroma of strawberries, and a faint mustiness. Very little carbonation, but you don't miss them. Taste starts out sweet on the tongue then turns dry and tart. I enjoyed this as a nice change from the everyday beer drinking."
"Interestingly enough, I did not really miss the lack of carbonation in this brew, it might be a bit better with it but it is interesting enough to stand up without it. I think that this would probably be a good transition Lambic for going from Lindeman's products to that of Cantillon. Very interesting and I am still not quite to sure what to think of it."
"Wonderful farmyard stench and strawberries, some public toilet smells (but in a good way). Flavour is tart and sour, some subtle sweetness from the strawberries, its more the seeds than the actual flesh. Dry, sour and refreshing. Love it. So refreshing and lovely to drink."
"2000 Vintage. Golden-hued liquid with a quick-to-vanish fizzy head. Looks like apple juice with some cloudiness in the glass. Nose contains pervasive notes of strawberries, a musty barnyard aroma, and hints at some sour acidity to come. Flavors include a huge strawberry profile in addition to notes of apple and pear -- imparted by the yeast -- and a very nice sweet-and-sour interplay throughout. Very tart, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is mildly effervescent at first, but turns more vinous as it settles. This is a unique, excellent vintage lambic. Would be a nice introduction to the more traditional style of lambics."
"The beer started to irritate my stomach about half way through, and i couldn't finish it. It felt too acidic. I got my girlfriend to drink as much of it as I could pawn off, and we had to pour the rest. I felt terrible, considering that it's such a hard to find (expensive) beer, but I don't think I'm ready for stuff like this, and neither is my digestive system."
"This brew poured a very little white head of large bubbles. Its body is an appealingly nice amber brown with bubbles clinging to the side on my mug. There is some lacing evident as the head disappears before I can taste it. It has a burnt wood aroma, not fruity as I expected. It tastes as bad as it smells. I took one sip and poured the rest. Too bad it was an $8.00 bottle."
"-F"
"(Update) K's in Bellevue had it in stock."
"Hazy light orange in hue, w/ a thin ring of bubbles around the rim of the glass. Akin to unfiltered sparkling cider in appearance. Sweet, ripe, sugary strawberries hit the nose at first, then are ceded by notes of yeast must, bready grain, and lactic tartness, with hints of wet horse and trace aged, cheesy hops emerging towards the end of the aroma. In flavor, the initial snap of fruit sweetness is quickly overrun by a nearly puckering tartness. Fruit flavor is not lost amongst the tart character, and strawberry persists throughout, albeit in an unripe fashion. The hint of diacetyl adds a creamy, buttery undertone that supplements the lactic tartness and prevents it from being overbearing and one dimensional. ""Wild"" Brettanomyces yeast emerges as mild notes of wet hay. As my palate becomes accustomed to the tartness, fruitiness reverts to a freshly picked strawberry nature. Spot on in body-- light, somewhat spritzy, but not at all weak or watery. Finishes simultaneously sweet, tart and dry. Oudbeitje is a complex and delicious lambic. The interplay of sweet fruitiness and lactic tartness teases the palate in a capricious way. The real deal."
"I wonder how long this bottling will last?"
"The first surprise was the color - I expected some pinky red lambic - but this was a dark copper colored murky looking lambic with no carbonation whatsoever, totally flat. This was a lambic that had hints of strawberry, rather than say a steeped Kriek where the fruit is dominant. The acidity was still quite high (good), sourness was prevalant at first, but the tinge of strawberries invaded in the middle and balanced the dryness at the end to a rather sharp but sweet finish. Excellent attempt at a new fruit lambic, only really let down by its flat appearance. I simply must try this again."
"B.United International's (importer) Masters' Collection - Limited Edition Year 2000 - Strawberry Lambic. 375 ml corked, caged bottle. Cork was dry. Hazy, deep orange in color. No head - flat. The aroma is complex: sour, acetic, brettanomyces (barnyard), lightly sweet with some candyish strawberry, musty, leathery. The body is thin and the mouthfeel is powdery. The flavor starts with a soft acidity which immediately turns quite sharp on the front of the tongue - puckering, leading into some light fruit flavor (wow!?!) and some broader flavors of limited residual sugar, leather, mustiness as the liquid warms across the palate, then dissolves from the tongue with a quickly passing light metallic note, leaving a dry, powdery finish and a ""sour spot"" at the back of the throat. Surprisingly not astringent, as it's often expected. Not a very complex lambic, but quite surprising in the clarity of the strawberry note (a difficult fruit to work with because of it's light character)."
