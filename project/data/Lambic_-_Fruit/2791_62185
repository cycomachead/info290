The palate starts failrly sweet then finishes with a touch of tart and big strawberry from start to finish. Drinkable but a little too sweet for my tastes.","pat61","Feb 23, 2015"

3.58,7.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/30/2012. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lightly tart strawberry, strawberry jam/candy, hay, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with big notes of sweet strawberries and some light yeast and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big lightly tart strawberry, strawberry jam/candy, hay, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big strawberries, strawberry jam/candy, hay, straw, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice robustness of big sweet strawberry flavors with some light yeast and earthy hop notes; with minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected for 4%. Overall this is a really solid standard fruit beer. Nice robustness of big strawberry flavors with light yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. It really doesn’t fit the Lambic style profile very well at all; but as a standard fruit beer it is quite enjoyable, as long as you don’t mind the sweetness(which wasn’t that bad in my opinion).","superspak","Nov 03, 2014"

3.69,11.1,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"people hate on timmermans for no reason. i mean, sure, its a level or two below the best of the best lambic types, but its a very approachable version, a possible gateway to the real good stuff, and more widely available than some of the really special ones. it serves a role. this one is very strawberry heavy, to the point where the yeast and grains are less detectable. similar in that regard to the framboise they do. pale red tint to the pour and a nose of fresh strawberry jam. it is very sweet, which detracts from drinkability, but the fruit is authentic, if a bit overdone. great carbonation cleans it up pretty well though, and in general i like this much better than some of the other common strawberry bombs coming out of belgium. i think this is a cool beer, and one that may turn people on to more tart and acidic traditional lambics, although this one is lacking much of that character. fun beer, not world class cellaring beer. thats okay sometimes.","StonedTrippin","0"

Smell is of those cheap strawberry candies, strawberry syrup, and a slight aroma of the strawberry flavored medicine made for children. Taste is much the same with slightly sour strawberry candy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but slightly artificial with the strawberry presence and quite sugary.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 01, 2013"

Smells nice, if one-dimensional, but the flavour has some vague off-notes that detract from the overall character. The body also has something that isn't quite right; a sort of dry viscosity that feels somehow artificial. An OK brew if you want something sweet and fruity, but falls far short of the true potential of lambic.","jazzyjeff13","Apr 20, 2013"

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, strawberry, cream, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, sugar, cream, strawberry, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I had this one a little while back out of the bottle and really enjoyed it. However, the on draught version left something to be desired. There was more of an earthy note on the nose that was a little abrasive with all the other aspects going on here. The flavor was very light which made it easy to drink, but not the most enjoyable thing I drank this night. I would suggest this to a new craft beer drinker that was a fan of fruit, but for the refined Lambic drinker, I wouldn't bother with it on tap.","thagr81us","Aug 02, 2012"

2.07,-37.7,4,2,2,1.5,2,"Overall-- this is too sweet, not tart enough, and just not really good. I will buy some more of the framboise for my wife, but will be passing on this one.","AleWatcher","Aug 10, 2011"
2.81,-15.4,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"As with the other Timmermans lambic that I tried (the framboise), it is overly sweetened-quite reminiscent of strawberry fruit snacks. Overall a bad representation of a fruit lambic with no wild or tart character-it is entirely one dimensional. Tasty, but I can get Welch's Strawberry soda for a fraction of the price.","plfahey","Jul 21, 2011"
3.87,16.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a tulip snifter. A ruddy reddish color with a small cap of head that did retain decently well. Aroma filled up the whole side of the bar with sweet and sour strawberries. In the taste, good fresh strawberry flavor and a small tartness. Semi-sweet upfront greeted by a nice restrained sour tang of wild yeast funk. Has all the trademarks of a good fruit lambic, mild sour, complimentary fruit, mildly effervescent, smooth and easy to drink. Overall, I was happy with this little find. A decent lambic, if you dig strawberry which I do.","Stinkypuss","Jul 08, 2011"
3.32,0,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"The first sip was the best, it all went down hill from there. It is light and heavily carbonated on the palate and sweet, very sweet, with a lot of fruit but the more I drank the dryer it got, the dryer it got the more sulfur and cloying it got. By the end I regretted this experiment and my sweet tooth. I won't bother having it again.","drabmuh","Jun 17, 2011"

3.41,2.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is light sweet strawberry up front with light rustic, earthy yeasty character underneath, and a juicy, lively, zesty light tartness. It’s dryish, not overly sweet, crisp and zesty but the character is all a bit light and subdued and there is not enough “lambic” rustic character for me.","Offa","Jun 10, 2011"
2.64,-20.5,2,3,2.5,3,2.5,"I really had no clue what to expect going into this beer, it was an interesting Lambic but really sweet and artificial tasting for my likings. My girlfriend felt the same way. It's nothing I'd order again.","ShanePB","May 22, 2011"
2.34,-29.5,3.5,2,2,3.5,2.5,"Thanks to schmittymack for bringing this one over a couple weeks back. Poured a light brown color with a head a shade or so lighter. Aromas of artificial strawberry mostly, some sweetness and candy. On the palate this one is light bodied and unimpressive, with syrupy sweet artificial strawberry and candy sweetness.","emmasdad","May 19, 2011"
3.5,5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Strawberry colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are both dominated by sour strawberries.It reminds me of a non-alcoholic strawberry daiquri.Something that is best suited for the warmer months.I would buy again but not at 10 dollars for 11 ounces.I would recommend to try at least once if you like lambics.","matty","May 01, 2011"
3.11,-6.3,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Opinion: This is an alright malt beverage, but it is much more foo-foo than any beer that I would like to consume regularly. I mean, there was no yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle? This is a commercialized ""lambic"" beer if I ever saw one, and may be a good starter beer because it is a whole lot better than the Cranberry Lambic that Boston Brewing makes...but that isn't saying much as it is horrible too. I personally will stick with Cantillon and the likes and leave this for the ladies...or newbie beer geeks.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 29, 2011"

3.11,-6.3,4.5,3.5,3,2,3,"Basically a soda pop with a very low ABV. Amp up the ""beer"" qualities a bit, and this may score somewhat higher. Still, for a soda-pop, it's a pretty enjoyable soda-pop. I'm OK with stuff like this, because a) ladies who don't like beer often like this stuff and b) even I can't drink Saint Lamvinus everyday.","Patrick999","Mar 03, 2011"
4.15,25,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours translucent pale red, with a white head. It smells like a strawberry pie. Taste is like strawberries but weaker then I was expecting, also less sweet which in some ways makes it have more in common with other beers compared with most lambics. The beer is also pretty smooth. Its a good beer to sip.","hdofu","Mar 02, 2011"

3.57,7.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I've had a small eye on this for a while now, but was never able to pull the trigger. Let's see how it goes, shall we? It pours a slightly hazy ruby red grapefruit juice topped by a finger of nearly white foam. The nose is unsurprisingly strawberry-heavy, resembling very closely the strawberry syrup I used to put on my pigs-in-blankets back in the day, sweetness included. The taste is more of the same, but the sweetness is partially cut by a low-lying tartness, akin to real strawberries. The body is a hefty-feeling light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly sticky finish. Overall, a decent little fruit lambic, but nothing I can really rave about by any sense of the imagination. Pretty tasty if you're into the strawberries, though.","TMoney2591","Dec 30, 2010"

It's fine for what it is, the sugary fruity mixed drinks that Conan loves, but for the true lambic lover this is even more lacking than Lindemans.
