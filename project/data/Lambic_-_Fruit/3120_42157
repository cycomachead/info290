Nose is funky, much like provolone cheese. No tartness comes through. A bit of sweet cherry can be found in the back. On the tongue it is sweet. Sweet cherry flavor with a hint of funk and residual tartness. A little vanilla towards the end. The sour character is not big at all, its very subtle. This allows the delicate cherries to shine. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, with low carbonation. But gets sticky as it warms up. Lasting flavor afterwards. Awesome treat.","SDDanC","Feb 07, 2012"

Mouth puckering, pungent, funky, fruity, and spicy. Moderate carbonation with a medium body and a dry, dry finish. For me, a sour beer such as this is rather quenching, but I personally would never seek out another glass in an evening. Overall, a very decent first attempt on Alpine's part.

4.12,11.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is lighter with mellow carbonation. Goes down easily enough, just make sure you have some antacids nearby! A tasty interpretation of a kriek here, but I do agree that at $28 it was overpriced. A good bottle to share and I'm glad autumnaldave shared this one with me as I shared my Briscoe!","orbitalr0x","Sep 21, 2008"

4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a red hue with a touch of white foam at the top. Nose is harshly sour with strong vinegar tones. Real strong antiseptic fragrance. Flavor is actually quite smooth. Sour and fruity, the cherries add a nice touch to a moderately sour brew. Definite barnyard funky on there as well. I also feel like I am getting vanilla here? Liquid is smooth and the carbonation is low. This is surprisingly easy to drink. The nose was advertising different, but it ends up being quite nice.","RblWthACoz","Beers"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Tastes clean bright light cherry. Strong carbonation mies with tart from cherry and lifts the beer off the tongue so the finish dries. Almost an unripe cherry flavor. Lactic tart is not overbearing. Md-light body. Great summer quencher and good drinkability.","mentor","0"
3.46,-6.5,2,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pinkish yellowish color. Small white head that unfortunately doesn't have any pink shades. Fairly nice nose with hints of cherries, as well as some wood. Flavor doesn't have a lot of depth, but has some nice elements of cherry , sourness and wood. Nice balance of sweet and sour. I like this ale quite a bit.","Crosling","Jul 16, 2008"
4.52,22.2,3.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very interesting strawberry red color but with very little head. What there is fades almost immediately. Smells of tart cherries and a bit phenolic. A touch of almond and cream as well as a bit of funk. The taste is amazing, however. Bright, bright cherries followed by some acetic qualities and some light horseblanket funk that then fades into a beautiful cherry cream flavor. Very pure tasting, especially the fruit and the sour elements, but with just enough fruit to make it interesting. A bit of sweetness at the end rounds it out and gives it the slightest bit of cherry creamsicle flavor. Overall, though it is quite tart and not sweet. Mouthfeel is clean and pure and nicely sour. Very nice effort and definitely a bit different from other sours.","Georgiabeer","Jul 14, 2008"

4.72,27.6,4,4.5,5,4,5,"The body is dry with a nice tart finish. Very light carbonation as per style. Overall a fun beer for the palate. A lot of hidden descriptors to really enjoy. The cherries real add a depth to this beer. And as the beer warms the wood characteristic add even more complexity and intensity that really a fun beer to drink. Even the wifey enjoyed.","Oxymoron","Jul 07, 2008"
4.88,31.9,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Drinkability: amazing, I can drink this all night long. I rarely say this, but the hefty $28 is well spent. Not over hyped at all. One of the best beers I've had this year!!","vince4953529","Jul 04, 2008"
3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle courtesy of Gford217: Poured a light red color ale with a light pink bubbly head with some average retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of red wine and tart notes with some light sour cherries. Taste is a mix between some sour cherries, with some tart notes with loads of oak and some red wine notes. Average carbonation with limited funk notes when I was expecting a lot more from the description. Overall, I though this was easily drinkable and maybe a bit light for the kind of beer it would like to be.","Phyl21ca","Jun 30, 2008"
4.47,20.8,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,5,"As much as it pains my wallet, I will be seeking out another bottle of this beer. It's worth it.","fumner","Jun 03, 2008"
2.82,-23.8,3,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours a thin reddish, almost rosy pink color. Smell is lightly creamy butterscotch and sour cherry. Taste is thin and tart cherries. Definitely shows sign of tartness, but still feels overly simplistic, like thin juice, and doesn't have any funky complexity or anything. A certain amount of acidity and dryness in the finish as well, but also has a faint buttery finish to it, perhaps from the diacetyl, too. While this wasn't terrible, I cant say I enjoyed it, with or without consideration of the price.","JDV","May 22, 2008"
4.64,25.4,4,5,4.5,4,5,"Overall I would have to say this one was excellent. Was it worth $28 a bottle, I am not sure, however I will tell you this, I would most certainly buy another one. I think this is something everyone should get to try. It is rare to see an American brewer but forth such a quality effort in this style, and this was simply outstanding. I cannot wait to get to try it again. One of the best I have had.","mikesgroove","May 21, 2008"
4.37,18.1,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear, dark pinkish red color with a light rose head that fades really fast. The smell is tart at first, but after that it is big on the sweet and sour cherry. You get both components, but mostly a sour cherry smell. The taste is nice and moderately acidic, cherry there unmistakably. The mouthfeel on this beer is very light and effervescent. I actually wouldn't have minded a fraction higher body on this. Really a good and interesting sour beer to drink. Not as complex as I would think, but pretty straight forward as far as acid + cherry goes. Tasty beer.","MiScusi","May 21, 2008"
4.2,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: After the initial sip, and I was skeptical about paying $27 a bottle for this. Good thing no one I know likes lambics, so I had to drink the entire bottle. This gave me and the beer some time to ""warm"" up to each other. This was a great treat, but probably a one time deal for me at the price. Give it a shot, but share the weath...my only regret.","paulthebeerguru","May 17, 2008"
4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a very good beer and I would love to drink it again but the price is a big setback (around $28 a bottle). I'd say that Alpine did a good job with this beer.","seaoflament","May 02, 2008"
4.55,23,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Price tag scared me at first but I am sucker for both Alpine and lambics, although at a little over a dollar an ounce I was still skeptical, so that did not help me out in holding back on this one, one of their best brews yet, probably would not drink again for this price but it was awesome and I enjoyed every drop of my glass, highly recommended","Floydster","Apr 28, 2008"
4.12,11.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Good lambic overall, but not spectacular. I was a bit let down by the finish...falls off pretty abruptly. Otherwise, this could have been really good. I really like to see another American brewer take a shot at a lambic, and this is a good first effort indeed. That said, the $28 price tag is a pretty steep price to pay when there are bottles of Cantillon Kriek available for $8.","WeisGuy","Apr 23, 2008"
3.85,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a stunning rustic ruby with a half finger faint pink head that quickly dies down to a ring of various sized bubbles. Stickiness is just about non-existant, ho-hum. Smell is super funky. A lot of sour oak and a touch of vinegar. I was hoping the cherry would be strong, but unfortunately I was let down. Weak sour cherries with some cranberry and a grassy scent. Some pepper and spice tickle the nose as well. Interesting, but I could use more cherries in the aroma. Funky cherries up front on the tongue followed by vanilla and oak. A strange combination of pepper and buttery biscuits midway through, weird. Aftertaste is a bit dry with a touch of merlot, leather, and oak. Mouthfeel is fairly light bodied with stinging carbonation. Refreshing for sure, this beer went down much easier than I expected after the first sip. Chez seems to grow on me as my tongue adjusts to the funkiness. Not too sure about the $28 price tag, but it's still a good beer none the less. Keep up the good work Alpine.","BeerTruth","Apr 22, 2008"

4.18,13,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Very nice stuff. Definitely not a lambic, not in the traditional sense at least - there's absolutely no funk here, and the sourness is quite tame. This beer is more comparable to Russian River's Supplication or Lost Abbey's Red Poppy.","largadeer","0"
