"Pours a light cherry brown color with good clarity.  White head pours vibrantly and leaves some lace.  The aroma has still bright cherry, slight oxidized malt, and a bit of sweetness.  Faint lambic character. Light bodied, well carbonated.  Still vibrant and full of life, this is a nice little treat."

"The taste is sweet with cherry winegums. The beer is sweet but not sticky or syrupy. The beer has a non-offensive taste which reminds more of a soda. The good thing about the beer is the lack of the sweetener taste. Bitterness is low and drinkability is high."

"Bellevue had a very wonderful light head. I dare say this brew was perfect for the summer days I consumed it on. The perfect amount of tartness vs sweetness ( and this goes for most fruit based lambic style beers as well). There was absolutely no aftertaste or lingering on the palate either. If you have this beverage available in your area I strongly suggest you try it!"
"I can quite enjoy a kriek, but this one is more for drinking at parties than for slowly enjoying it at home. There's a lot worse kriek out there, but this still feels artificial and candy-like."
"Okay, but there are better Krieks out there."

"Had a bottle of this at a Thai restaurant in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Poured into a Belle-Vue tulip glass. Cherries is the key word for this strange carbonated lambic brew. The scent of cherries is a bit overpowering, but definitely not unpleasant. The head on this brew was beautiful to look at, rosy in hue and leaving a thin, delicate lacing around the glass, bubbling up in the middle as a good Belgian beer should. However, the carbonation in this was a bit much for me, feeling more like cream soda than a beer. The flavor, too, while it was definitely cherry, was a bit too sour and not really resembling a beer (even for a lambic). Overall, this is a tasty cherry drink that would go over well with those who don't like the taste of standard brews. However, when it comes to fruit beers and lambics, I know other brands I will choose again over this. Tasty though..."

"I would like it a bit more sweet, as a fruity beer, but not that bad after all."
"Overall-An attractive beer which I think has a very nice balance between sweet and sour which gives this beer high drinkability. Not a lot of complexity present but definitely has some wild yeast funk."

"An acceptable, sweetened Kriek but it's nothing special."
"The Crack & Glug produced two big, rocky fingers of cotton candy-pink head with good retention. The room filled with the smell of sweet cherries! Color was a very pretty ruby red with NE-quality clarity. Leaning in, the cherry smell was definitely of sweet cherries, as opposed to sour ones, which go into New Glarus' Wisconsin Belgian Red. Mouthfeel was big and full with a dryness borne less of the cherries than of the beer's maturation in oak barrels along with the wild yeast. It was not too sweet, but it was not as sour or funky as many other Krieks that I have had. One reviewer characterized it as a ""chick's beer", but just because it is made from fruit does not mean women are necessarily going to flock to it. Instead, it is more like a good introductory beer to the style, fitting for anyone, especially the curious. Finish was slightly dry and very refreshing, but one at a time would be plenty. I would put some in the cooler if asked to do so, but I am not going to put it in of my own volition."
"Overall: this beer is too sweet,unbalanced, lacks all sourness and bitterness in the taste. Tastes like cherry soda, avoid"
"Pours dark with a red hue, and a nice head that vanishes quickly. Nice scents of sour cherry and red vinegar. Taste is nice and understated, with only a hint of kriek cherry and sour Flemish, obviously not added sloppy after the beer. Soft drink, easy to down a few of these. Kriekenbier is not for everyone, and not particularly masculine, but will admit it's nice."
"D: All over-meh. Weak in all categories - I could be drinking crystal light cherry water and not know the difference."
"Too pronounced nose of cherries, no acidity in the body and very sweet, on the edge of syrupy. However, mouth a little cardboard as if beer was blocked. If the finish is naturally low in terms of bitterness and balance, there is however a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. For creating this beer, it was probably used an extremely young lambic to be less harsh on the palate."
"Drinkabilty is high, except price, were it cheap it would probably be the staple drink for 14 year old girls."
"Is gives a mouthfeel like you were drinking a cherry soda. For warm weather a good drinkable beer."
"D- very easy to drink if you enjoy sour fruit beers, this is a nice representation,"
"Very un-impressed. Mass produced and you can tell."
"D- Overwhelmingly cherry beverage with no noticeable malt or hop flavor or aroma. Although I don't appreciate the lack of these typical beer qualities, to be fair, I haven't tried enough lambics to judge this beer against its brethren, so I ranked it as average."
"D - This is a drinkable beer. Fruity, sweet, a good chick drink, but overall the flavor was too simple. There are no strong characteristics about this. Cherry coke is cheaper and gives almost the same buzz."
"Mostly as I expected."
"Had a bottle at the Ibis Hotel bar. Appear bright, clear red with a pink head. This is your typical, but well-made, juicy fruit lambic. Very sweet and with more body than actual juice, finishes with a bit of sour tang, but nothing that approaches a genuine oude kriek."
"Kriek is a wonderful option for those who enjoy a refreshing fruit beer on a hot afternoon. It's smell is very enticing with strong cherry aromas. The first sip has a pleasant sourness and then rounds itself out with more cherry flavors. It leaves wonderful lacing in the glass when you finish. Very drinkable!"
"T: Slightly thin, moderate carbonation and more sweet than tart. Very refreshing with a strong cherry flavor but not a spectacular lambic. Happy to find this beer here and would have it again if nothing else is available, but not my first choice."
"Pours a cloudy deep red to copper color with a small white to no head. In the aroma, dark cherry, sweet and sour. In the taste, a tart dark cherry. A smooth sourness, and a medium bodied mouthfeel, and a small sour cherry aftertaste. Nice sour, big in cherry, a great lambic."
"it should be noted upfront that this is not my favorite style. had this at club popeye on-tap in the proper glassware. a clear deep red with great head and lacing. aroma is mostly strong dark sour cherries with the taste following suit. also a bit of earthy, woody mustiness. light in body with a very effervescent carbonation. puckering finish."
"D : Not one I could drink again. Way too sweet and syrupy to enjoy. Would probably be good to use to introduce a BMC drinker to a lambic."
"Beer poured a redish amber body with a thick pink, fluffy head. The nose was slightly sweet yet tart as well. The taste was very cherry, again slightly sweet but tart. I was expected the beer to be more syrupy sweet and I didn't think it was but it is still sweeter than I would expect for a lambic. This is probably a good starter lambic for someone getting started with the style."
"Interesting and I'm glad I tried it. Definite after dinner beer as others have commented"
"Overall: I'm a fan of this beer, because it maintains its integrity as a beer while being an interesting type of Belgian fruit beer. Since it's on tap at all the Belgian bars around Australia, it's easy to get my hands on, and I'll order one on a hot afternoon without thinking twice. Even if I'm at work."
"Taste isn't bad and considering my aversion to Timmerman's, surprisingly good. It's light and fruity, a lot of cherry characters with the slightest hint of hops on the middle of the palate but mostly a slightly tart fruit quality, but not too sour that the taste makes your lips pucker. Quite pleasant and quite drinkable."
"Review added 11-18-2007, translated from french 1-26-2008."
"D - A decent enough beer worth trying, good every now and then."
"This is a very drinkable kriek. It is more sweet than most lambics."
"As with most krieks, this beer has a vibrant red body with a pink head. The head on this beer disappeared much quicker than most krieks though. It has a slightly sour aroma but is dominated by a sweet cherry aroma that seems authentic. The cherry flavor is a bit different though. It seems almost artificial either because it actually is artificial or they just put too much cherry into it. The sourness is there in the background helping to cut the overwhelming cherry flavor. Some residual sweetness is present as well. Holding with the style guidelines is the light body and it gives a decent drinkability."
"Overall, it's drinkable, but when it's hot or you're camping, so are a lot of things. Fizzy, syrupy, sugar alcoholpop."
"A great fruit beer that is wonderfully refreshing."
"The cherry taste was tart, rather than sour, with a slight cough syrup flavour. There was a nice amount of beeriness that prevented this from being too fruity for its own good. The lively carbonation was a nice touch."
"Pours a deep rose red color with lots of pale pink fluffy head that takes a while to dissipate. Smells very yeasty like most belgian ales. There's also a strong hint of sweet cherry along with it. Very pleasant. The taste is very unusual, thick and sweet with a lot of cherry tartness and a lasting aftertaste of cherry fruitiness. Mouthfeel is really thick and chewy, almost like sipping syrup, but with a little bit of carbonation on the back end. Overall, it's very drinkable in an aperitif sort of way, I don't know that I'd be able to drink very many in a row. But as a special occasion, it's an awesome beer."
"Fairly flat on the mouth, but with an acid feel on the tongue. Despite this, still a pleasure to drink. Definitely a sipper though."
"Good, but pretty one-dimensional."
"Corked bottle, pours a clear red with a creamy pinkish head that looks like soft ice cream and lacing very well. Aroma of sour cherries and oak woodiness. Taste was sweet and sour cherries with a bit of malt and long bitter finish. Kind of oddly inconsistent, some sips are much more sour and bitter than others, it might be how I am sipping though. Mouthfeel was surprisely creamy with a bit of astrigency, especially in the finish. This is much better than I remembered for such an easy to find Lambic."
"Belgian Saison+cherry soda+decade old fruit wine=somewhat weird but wonderful concoction. This had the nose of the wine, sour & complex yeasty charactor of a Saison Farmhouse Ale and of course the fizzy cherry taste of the soda. Very interesting & enjoyable, defianetly a must try-thumbs up!"
"Overall, I find myself with mixed feelings about this beer, great appearance and sour finish, but the aroma (in both smell and taste) is hard to get into. I'd much prefer an ""unberried"" lambic style."
"Drinkability: A small price to pay for the enjoyment I got out of this, not to mention how long it lasted with the small sips for maximum enjoyment. I'm still getting into lambics, but I really dig this and think it's definitely worth a shot even if you're skeptical."
"All in all, Belle Vue Kriek is a tasty drink. And while it's Beer, it's hardly ""beer"" (if you know what I mean). Sweet, and worth a try, and perhaps something your non-beer drinker friends will enjoy, but not special enough to warrant regular consumption."
"This is my favorite kriek bier! I love pouring it in its frozen bolleke, and see the thawing frost creep upward. Obviously, this beer wants to be cold. This is one of those beers that are sold in those criminal 30 cl eurobottles. In this case this is an advantage as the original Belle Vue bottles contained only 25 cl. Well, you win some and you lose some. After pouring the ice cold beer the 3 cm head slowly recedes. The color is a beautiful deep red when held against the sunlight. The smell is fresh and fruity (obviously). Tasting it is pure bliss. The krieken (sour cherries) bounce all over the place! This fine kriekenbier is highly recommended."
"drinkability is good. not what i'd usually reach for, but i'm enjoying it."
"Taste is fruit juice followed by cherries and a flavor of jam, All is surrounded by yeast, spices and an oaked finish"
"A very sleek appearence, great carbonation on the pour, well pronouced mouthfeel. Somewhat lively, oak (or cork?) is tasted, proof of ageing maybe? Not much artificialness, this beer doesn't quite compare to some other great, more authentic Belgian's. Lacks any deep cherries. Especially in light of its lambic style ""sourness"" this is lacking. Slightly tart in the after taste for those who aren't too exposed to lambics. Enjoyed this more before I knew what a good fruit Lambic really was."
"Drinkability: This is more drinkable than I expected, very flavorful, but 375ml is more than enough cherry for me."
"OK for something different, but not something I'd drink regularly."
"Overall, it was decent with chocolate and decent for the style, but not something I would try and have again. The unusual aftertaste and mouthfeel really were difficult."
"Somewhat sour, bing cherry. I like the dry style. Taste is very pungent. Unlike the head this lambic is lacking overall carbonation. A bit thin in the mouth yet very drinkable."
"D: At a nice, cool temperature, perfect for sipping. It complemented the warm summer evening quite well. With the strong cherry flavor and initial tang, it's not one you want to rush, but overall it's very pleasurable, especially in the brandy snifter."
"Drinkability  All in all good. Ive said it before and Ill say it again; sweet beers dont quite do it for me but Belle Vue Kriek was definitely a worthwhile experience."
"This has been a beer that I've had a few time since my stay in Melbourne and has been better every time I've tried it. Poured from a nice corked green bottle into what looked like a brandy glass. Ruby color looked very nice when brought up against the light with a nice white head accenting the overall look quite nicely. Fruit smells dominating, specifically cherries and rasberries...almost a spritzer quality. Taste was very tart, giving a champaigne taste accompanied by the fruit characters. It was also a sharp tasting beer that needed a bit of warming before some other flavors, the most dominant being strawberry pulled through. Mouthfeel was light/medium bodied, with fairely high carbonation. This is a winner in my book, but you really need to like tart fruit to really enjoy this one. I was surprised by how much I liked this brew considering any cherry flavored anything usually turns me off. Give it a try."
"I must have gotten a bad bottle. There is no excuse for this stuff. I want my $3.25 back."
"Aromas include cherry, semi-spice, and children's medicine. The flavors-- wow, quite easy for a Fruit Lambic. It's not overly tart nor sweet-- there is some mild acidity near the finish. Simple but nice! This beer drinks oh so easily, I think I'd like another! Now where to find one..."
"Not my favorite style of beer at all, but easy to drink. This is a gateway beer to offer the women in your life. Unless the women in your life are like my wife, who has been known to complain of ""watery consistency"" in strong imperial stouts."
"Pours a fairly dark red/pink with a fairly large pink-tinged head that is thick, slow to dissipate and leaves substantial lacing. Smell is less interesting, with some yeasty funk and a metallic note accompanying the sweetness that dominates the nose. Taste is slightly tart, but not as much as I'd hoped for, and is mostly just sweetness with a hint of cherry and a dry lambic-y finish. Mouthfeel is syrupy, quite thick and not very carbonated, and drinkability is pretty average. This is a bit too candy-sweet and not complex enough to be a really good lambic, but it's not bad."
"Taste is very much of sour cherries and sweet malt. A bit puckering. Overall I find the taste a bit too sweet and candylike for me. I'm too much of a fan of hops I suppose. Mouthfeel is of sparkling wine or champagne, very fizzy. Dances on the tongue, think in the mouth and dry going down. I'd have a hard time doing more than one of these in a session, but again, this just may not be my style of beer."
"This poured to a ruby red fizzy head that reduced quickly with some lacing. Smells sweet, with a slight sourness of cherries, as it should. Taste is dry, almost like a champagne, not too sweet as to still resemble beer. Mouthfeel is fizzy, like a soda, and very mild. Overall this is very easy to drink and goes down with little effort. A decent example of this style."
"Overall a solid fruit beer, nothing world changing though. If you're looking for an intro to fruit beers try liefmans kriek, if you want something with a bit more rawness try cantillon"
"D: Not your average beer, but as fruit lambics go, it's very drinkable."
"for myself, its tough to call this beer. its just has very little of what i associate with the aromas and flavors of beer that i am used to. obviously by my scoring, thats not a bad thing. the glass i had went very quickly and easily. i was finding it tought to keep from gulping this down."
"Orangey-brown color with only subtle red tones. Minimal head. Lacing is beautiful but almost nonexistent. Here in Houston we can only get Lindeman's lambics, so for years I've been drinking the very fruity ones; this smells like Belgium to me. Sour cherry notes and not too much sweetness. Taste is tart and sweet and sour. The cherry is understated. I like this much better than the fruit bombs. Medium body, light mouthfeel. Finish lingers with sour, tart fruit. It has a good malt backbone, without punching you in the face with sweetened fruit juice. Ends just a little dry. Enjoyable."
"Clear ruby colour with amber highlights topped by generous, pink foam. Decent head retention after it initially subsides and it left rings of lace on the glass. Tart, fruity aroma of cherries, with some sweetness and bit bit of earthiness. Sweet, almost syrupy flavour with plenty of cherries, but too little sourness to provide a nice balance. Overall, quite mild with a bit of tartness in the finish. Slightly viscous, syrupy texture. Fairly enjoyable fruit beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little sticky, with good carbonation. Drinkability; not great due to the strong flavour. Good for ending the night, but wouldn't want another"
"A style I could never drink more than a few at once, and this one is no exception."
"Dark burgundy coloured, almost red wine red. Soft pink head, pretty big and laces nicely. Smell is sweet, cranberry, horse blanket. Taste is sweet right up front, fruity cherry sweetness glides to the back of the mouth. Dry, tart finish, very nice. Pretty full mouth, low carbonation, really coats the whole mouth. Goes down smooth, little bit cloying though because of the sugars. Nice though."
"Appeared a light opaque burgundy color atop which sat a frothy two finger head light and airy like cotton candy. Aromas of sweet cherry and wheat along with a light sourness. Tastes of sweet wine, cherries with a sour backbone and light malt. This beer was light in the mouth, not too sweet, not too dry either. For my money no other beer could quench my thirst better. However, I must admit it was much better on tap."
"Not overly carbonated so its easy to drink. Good beer."
"Pinkish red, with retaining thin lace. Dry drink, drier than dry wines.Definate true cherry flavour. Strong carbonation tingles mouth and tongue. Satisfying and semi-sweet, but not for everyone. Chocolate would incredibly work with it. For the meal's end."
"I am not the biggest fan of lambric style beers but given the complexity and fruityness which makes this a great after dinner drink. Nonetheless recommended to those who enjoy rich red wines or fruity style beers."
"375ml bottle with cork and cage. Could hardly get a head on this one at all which marks down the appearance a little in this case. Very interesting hazy red garnet colour with a slight amber tint. Sour fruity cherry aroma with a little oak in the background. Taste starts with cherry laden fruitiness, then becomes sour with a slight tannin finish. Even though there was no head in my case, the carbonation felt about right and the feel was quite smooth. Looking forward to trying more lambics, I don't mind this style."
"Quite enjoyable, and certainly worth a try."
"Valentines day and something special for my 300th review from my better half. Poured into a thin tulip it shows a light brandy-sherry color. 3 finger pink tinted meringue head. Wonderful nose: fruity, medicinal, slightly musty with a wisp of treacle. Slick mouthfeel dominance of fruit but there is a subtle but constant undertone of horse blanket layered with spice, earth...finish is wet, sour, musty with fruit over tones. Wonderfully layered between sweet-sour-bitter-musty. Wonderful stuff. I like it so kill me."
"375ml green bottle cork and cage 5.3% alc, served in proper labelled glasswear. Pours deep ruby color with bright white foamy head, leaving nice coating of lace down the glass. Sweet aroma of cherries. Some oakiness in smell and taste as well. Taste also filled with the cherries, ends with a sour finish. Overall quite good, but I am sure there are better examples of this style. At 4.99 a bottle, little pricey for an everyday drink."
"I would drink this again."
"I thought I should finally review this, as I drink it quite regularly. Belle Vue's kriek is attractive in the glass, with a dense bone-white head and ringed lacing. Unfortunately the head reduces itself quite quickly to a minimal covering. Dark dark ruby reds, black cherries, fleeting murky purple hues. The beer is not transparent in the least. I love a good sweet beer, and the sugary candied aroma of this kriek whets my appetite. Of course, deep oak notes are in the smell, too. The malt is there, hiding behind the massive sugar and oak. Next to no hop aroma, and indeed the aroma is uncomplex, yes, but sweet enough in a balanced way to make me rate it decently. Red licorice, candied apple, and a flowery nectar note. The taste is a well-balanced sweet sensation, for me. The sugar obviously predominates, with oak and just enough dryness to prevent it from being sleek with sugar. The front is all cherry sweet, in the middle the oak, and the end is more sugar, but with some iron, yeast and even grainy malt. Licorice, tomato acid, and transient hop dryness. The carbonation is medium, the body full. I can never drink more than two of these at one time, or the sugar becomes too much, even for me. Absolutely perfect with cake or simply as an after-dinner treat. Other than the stigma of being owned by Interbrew(and of seeing this in Belgium canned) this is a very good kriek by all rights."
"Whoa, what a looker of a beer. Pours a cherry red with a pink, huge, fluffy head that settles down but never goes away. Lace coats the glass like etched artwork on the goblet. Gorgeous. Smells of cherries, wheat, malt and sort of a sour, unique smell. I'm not sure of a hop presence. It's overpowered by sweet and sourness that my nose can't really tell. Taste is disapointing. I had too much hopes for this beer. Expecting something sourly puckering and barnyard like, I'm instead greeted with a light, cherry & malt sweetness with a somewhat sour aftertaste. Not bad, I guess. I like it, I just wanted more. Mouthfeel is odd. Sticky at certain points of the mouth, but otherwise pretty smooth. The tongue smacks after the drink is finished. It's actually pretty drinkable. Kind of refreshingly tart. I like this beer, but someday I hope to pick up a lambic that truly defines the style."
"This beer comes with a cork and a safety wire stopper on it just like a champagne bottle, also suprisingly it opens, pours, bubbles and fizzes like champagne. Though the head on this one dies away rathe quickly it is no missed aspect for the taste and aroma. The aroma is a noticeable cherry one that doesn't turn you away but gets you thinking what a interesting beer this will be. With a off red almost brown color the head is a little lighter. First drink was a interesting one with slight cherry taste and just a hint of alcohol and it only got better the warmer it got. I will have to admit this is not a beer to drink alot of but more of a beer to have one every now and then or to catch your drinking buddies off gaurd. If you ever have the chance I recommend trying one."
"Light, refreshing, and quite sour. Slight bitter hop flavour in the end. Not quite as sweet as expected. After taste is a bit off, but the initial taste of cherries is quite nice."
"Strictly for sipping and not worth a second glass."
"Overall: Much better than the Belle Vue Gueuze that I just had. Belle Vue Kriek is a mass-produced Kriek, not a bad thing itself but it does mean that it is designed for the masses, in fact; it is now even available in Cans. That said, this is not that bad overall; a tad thin, with restrained fruits but with a nice enough oaky dry acidity in the ending makes it a nice enough widely available Kriek to try again. Undemanding."
"pours a dark pinkish/cherry red. The head is also pink in color and it lasts long and leaves pink lacing behind. This is the only lambic Ive tried so Im not sure where it stands compared to other lambics (evidently its not too popular). The smell is of sweetish cherries with some degree of tartness. The taste is like cherry candies with a bit of a yeasty taste and very faint hop character. There is some tartness in the middle followed by a sweet finish. Im sure this beer could be more on the tart/acidic side, and more complex in its flavors too. overall this is an interesting beer, like no beer Ive tried before. Id get it again."
"When i poured this beer it looked great, with it's foamy creamy looking head, slight carbonation, and deep red colours, but after that it went downhill, call me on this one, but i'm a firm believer in the fact that cherries and beer don't go together. I know i'm biased, but i'm allowed to be...."
"There's a dusty-rosy-grayish head. It's not too big, it's dense, and it leaves plenty of sticky, thin lacing. Underneath is a dark, reddish-brown, cloudy beer. Nice nose: tangy and sour, with cherry syrup. The front gives a little pucker of sour cherries and a little spice. Not bad. Turns darkish sour in the middle. This isn't as nice. It's not a pleasant tartness, more just sour. Bitter with cherries in the finish. It's enjoyable enough, but not quite enough lambic."
"I really don't know how to stand on this beer. I was expecting a normal beer, with a reminiscent of cherries, not a totally dominating cherry flavour, with a hint of beer notes. The beer looked great, with an appearance of dark brown/red, and a nice thick, half an inch head, slightly red. Smell of malt, and of course cherries. who would have guessed right? The taste.... cherries. For a fruit beer, excellent, otherwise, if your looking for a sublly fruity beer, look elsewhere. Very nice mouthfeel though, smooth, and slick. Great for the women!"
"Bottle  Poured a medium reddish brew with a nice foamy head with good retention. Aroma of cheery is extremely dominant. Body is medium with good carbonation. Taste is very accentuated by cherry with some tannic on the background. The cherry taste might be a tad too juicy for my own taste. This beer lack a bit of the sourness usually founded in lambic but overall this is still a very good beer."
"A wonderful drink to discover--I think one would enjoy this with a nice dessert and then relax, possibly by drinking something totally different. Not a session by any means (my God, imagine doing that, you'd have to remove your tongue by the end) but something to always have in the fridge."
"More obvious than rodenbach and therefore easier drinking."
"Drunk from a can, on the streets of Belgium. The aroma was artificial cherries and sugar. The taste was the same. The mouthfeel was light, and fizzy like diet cola, and the drinkability was not the best. I mean c'mon lambic beers in cans. ONLY IN BELGIUM!"
"My first Lambic! I was very excited. Pours a deep red with a moderate red/white head. Smells like cherries and sugar, a unique smell. Tastes sour yet sweeter than sugar, with a very defined cherry taste, almost like artificial flavoring in candy. Fuzzes and pricks my mouth with the sour. No hops detectable. In a blind taste test, I might mistake this for a wine cooler, which you would think would be a really bad thing, but I love unique tasting beers. Can't wait to try some lambics held in higher esteem than this one!"
"Taste is not surprisingly of cherries. The cherry taste is not overpowering and seems well modulated by the malt. Only slight sourness in the taste. Carbonation seems perfect for style. Hard beer to gauge drinkabity on as I usually will only have one lambic in a sitting. Overall this is an enjoyable beer. It is fine on its own, would be good with a nice chocolate dessert."
"The beer is a winsome and slightly hazy ruby red, the head is minimal, the consistency frothy, the color a light red or pink if your are so inclined with the residual lace thin and somewhat patchy. Sweet fruit nose, crisp and clean, a treat with the start all most cloying and the top skimpy in feel. Finish is biting in its acidity, sweet tart fruit aftertaste lingers on, the best of the three Belle Vues Ive had."
"Of course, I knew what to expect from reading about these Kriek brews, but knew nothing I had already tried that could compare. As it turns out, it reminds of a wine cooler almost, with its slightly sweet and highly carbonated mouthfeel. I could really taste the cherry notes in this up front. It does finish with a slightly sour aftertaste, citrus-like. No hops to be found. I would probably keep trying things like these, if for no other reason than to broaden my horizons. Not altogether bad - just very different."
"Had this on tap first time out, which made it a little more interesting. This was the first fruit lambic or fruit beer I'd ever tried. Interesting, fun to share, kind of a middle-of-the-pack one-dimensional fruit beer. Nice to look at though."
"Pours a very attractive clear dark red under a thin reddish head that disappeared quickly, leaving little collar and no lace. The nose immediately reminded me of cherry soda. So, in fact, did the mouth: sweet-sour and fizzy. The taste starts with cherry, matures through cherry, finishes with cherry and leaves a cherry aftertaste. Oh, and there's a bit of cherry in the taste. The opening is more sweet than sour, while the finish comes on sour. There is definitely an undercurrent of malt throughout the drinking experience, thus differentiating the brew from cherry soda. This may be a good example of its style, but I'm not crazy about the style."
"Came in a green 375ml corked green bottle, with best before date marked on back label. Some people aren't big fans of fruity beers, but I really like them when they're done right. This is one of them. Pours a gorgeous hazed deep red hue, light pinkish head which lapses into a thick ring. Nose is pure sweet/sourish cherry, were you looking for something else? Flavour matches up, sweet cherry taste up front with a sour cherry finish. Slightly acidic mouthfeel, and not something I'd want to have as a session beer, but it holds its own. I happen to like cherries, so it scores high. From my experience the bottled version tastes far better to what you can find on tap."
"This lambic pours almost a deep cherry red. A slightly red head was present after the pour; it stayed quit some time before giving away to a nice thick lace. The aroma is cherry with a musty side to it. There are also hints of oak floating around. The taste start off slightly tart with a musty yeasty flavor and a slight (and I do mean slight) sweet & sour finish. There is a bit of an after taste but it is not overwhelming (at least for me) I cant give it to high a score for drinkability. The after taste may get to me. Other than that is very nice!"
"Thx"
"cherry flavour."
"This is another extremely sweet beer from Belle-vue. Pours a dark ruby/brown color with a 1/2-inch bubbly head that fades down leaving a nice sticky lace on the glass. Aroma is bursting with the sweet fruitiness of cherries with mild oak undertones. Theres quite a bit of tartness and sourness flavor from the cherries. There is a great deal of carbonation, which gives it champagne-like qualities. Finish is very light and crisp."
"I gave it straight 4's because it was a very pleasing expierience all around yet I really would not be able to consume great quantities of this product..."
"Pours a deep brownish ruby color with a tall and foamy light pink colored head that coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of lace as it recedes. Nose is dominated by sweet cherries with some faint notes of oak. Taste, however, has only a quick flash of sweet dark cherries followed by some strong mouth-puckering tart and acidic notes. Finish has some woody and oaky flavors. I dont drink lambics very often, but I really enjoyed this one."
"Dark ruby red, creamy off-white head. Aroma is sour cherries and sugary sweetness. This kind of seems bland to me in a way. Very sour of course, and cherries are strongly involved. I kind of like the word subtle for this lambic. I tried Lindemans last week and it was so much more lip puckering and just flat out stronger in taste. This lambic is very enjoyable, but I prefer the ""kick the taste-buds' ass"" type of sourness and cherry taste."
"Deep ruby red color. Thin and creamy light brown head. All taht remains in a minute is an attractive brown collar. Sweet and slightly sour cherry on the nose. Also heavy brown sugar. The body of this beer is light-medium. Carbonation is fairly low. And the taste isn't overwhelming. Those factors, along with a decent flavor profile, lead to a nice drinkability. The flavor profile is primarily cherry, but not heavy with it. There are sweet and sour tugs of war going on (even if they are somewhat subdued compared to a Rodenbach). There is an appealing acidity to this beer. The sourness, although coming from the cherries, seems a bit lactic in nature. There's a dry oak woodiness in the background as well. There's a sweet brown sugar aspect that comes and goes also. This is a nice brew."
"Had this on draft at the Esplanade Bier Market in Toronto, and I have to say that it pours an exquisitely ruby red, with an off white pink head. Very thick full foam head, with a heavy lace lining the glass. Aroma is very sweet cherry nose with a mellow sourness from a citrusy background. A full flavored cherry taste that brings you back to the days when you were sipping on some cherry Kool Aid. The presence of sweet barley malt is also present. A very good dessert beer, that is popular with the ladies it won my girl's heart. Drinkable when it comes to taste, but very sweet I couldn't consume too many. Overall, for a better representation of the lambic go for a Lindeman's, it is so much better to me."
"Very nasty. The worst tasting beer I can remember."
"Deep reddish to brown color. Produced a fizzy off-whtie head. Smell was full of cherries and sourlike beer combination. Taste was lip puckering sour shot of black cherries and sweet finish. Not syrupy in the least bit, more of a thinner watery finish than I expected.  I have had better lambics and better kreiks. Doesn't compare to the New Glarus product. Still it is a decent after dinner finisher, matches well with chocolate."
"Attractive warm brownish-pink in appearance with a wimpy off-pink head that fizzles out immediately. Smells blatantly of cherries. Taste is surprisingly less sweet in the front than expected, more of a beer flavor in the middle; finishes with a slightly sour note and some lingering oakiness. Well carbonated. Teeters somewhere between a sweet dessert beer and a mild session beer, which I found rather unappealing. I would rather it lean more definitively one way or the other, the indecisive nature made it a little difficult to drink. At the end of the bottle, not a bad thirst quencher but left something to be desired."
"750 ml. cork & cage bottle. Pours a bold foamy pink head atop a brownish-red body; but it cannot hold. Actually quite nice in appearance! Very unique. The aroma is unrestrained, pure sweet cherry with only minimal sour notes appearing sporadically. The flavor is agressive as well, with sweet cherry overiding a tart, acidic fruitiness. Although the sweet-and-sour cherry palate is well balanced, the gripping 'tip-of-the-tongue-mouth-puckering' intensity is somewhat missed. A trade off? - This beer is much more accessible than other Krieks. The two-sided flavor eventually dries into a tart finish which is more reminiscent of the expected flavor profile. This beer makes a good sweet & lightly sour apertif or after-dinner drink but it lacks all of the complexity of the geuze - which is it's base. Still, it does have alot of character overall."
"I liked the appearance, deep red cherry colour, with pinky white head which lasts. After that, its downhill, very sweet aroma of cherries, really one dimentionally sweet,  i'd like it if their was some asertive tart sourness, but we'll never see that happen."
"amazing deep red colour.  it's almost as if Kool-Aid were beer.  The head also has a pinkish tinge.  The smell is probably the poorest part of the whole thing, I've heard the beer's flavour compared  to drinking cough syrup, and in the case of the smell, the comparison almost works.  However the taste has a delightfully strong cherry flavour, with the ale trailing along behind.  Feels nice and smooth over the palate, and can be drunk (to a point)."
