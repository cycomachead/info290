4.98,9.5,5,5,5,4.75,5,"I saved this one to log as my 1,500th review. Big thanks to jcvanderbilt for the trade. Pours a bright juicy reddish pink with nice clarity and minimal head. The nose is unbelievable. Full of jammy raspberries, a hint of earth, layers of signature Cantillon funk, a hint of vinegar and oak, but mainly ripe fresh berries. I could smell this all day! The taste lives up to the delightful smell with fresh juicy berries, waves of tartness which are counterbalanced with sweetness. Each flavor pops as this is the tastiest lambic I have ever had the pleasure of trying. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, this beer is fantastic. Definitely the best of the loons I have tried and one that I will have to seek out again.","homebrew311","Jul 08, 2014"

Carbonation is nice, tingles on the tongue but not too much, allowing you to focus on the intense raspberry flavor.

I'm taking off a little extra just because as it warmed a bit past cellar temp (which is what it was served at) the flavor dropped off slightly and became more vinegary (which I don't necessarily mind much, but it took over the raspberries, which I feel are meant to be featured).","SadMachine","Sep 28, 2013"

4.48,-1.5,4,4.75,4.25,5,4.5,"750mL 2001 ed thanks again to ygtbsm94. Pours a fire amber red with an excellent pink head that is extremely healthy for a sour albeit a little fizzy. Aroma is unreal: so much fresh raspberry, raspberry preserves, and insanely sharp funk. Taste is sharp, ultimate level of lactic acidity, seedy raspberries, rhubarb, sorrel, and starchy earth. Palate is all consuming, zippy, dry, insanely powerful but quick on your body. What a complete devastation of the framboise category. I cannot believe it but Puzzl and others are right- there is some serious aging potential for krieks and framboise. This has become sharper and more fruity heavy with 10 years on it rather than more mellow. 2/12/2011 9/4/8/5/16=4.2","tarheels86","Sep 25, 2013"

Pours a beautiful raspberry hue, slightly hazy in clarity, with a fluffy, cloud-like, light pink head similar to the color of cotton candy. Nose expresses citrus, rind, cork and a wisp of raspberry essence at the back. Taste consistent with nose - no real surprises here. Citric acid is very assertive in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body, puckeringly tart and lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a very good fruit lambic; however, I'd like to have had a little more raspberry flavor.","Jwale73","Apr 15, 2013"
4.75,4.4,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Update: The following day, I opened the 2008 vintage bottled in 2010. This has a deeper red color and the raspberry flavor is slightly fresher with a much lower acetic acid level that did not produce the wave of acidity I experienced with the 2006 and is better carbonated with a more champagne-like mouthfeel. I could enjoy sipping a whole bottle of this vintage, which is what I am about to do :-). Because the 2008 vintage presents considerably better, I have upgraded my earlier score to an across the board 4.75 (was 4.5 overall). With these beers, one can expect variations by vintage (neither the lambic nor the fruit will be the same) and quality also depends on cellaring time and conditions, but 2008 is delicious now and may be as good as it gets (until I get to try a newer vintage).","Beerenauslese","Apr 14, 2013"

The smell is fantastic - raspberries stand out most, but there's a nice mix of funk, sour and oak in there as well. The flavor is still good, but not quite as impressive as the nose. It's a bit simpler than I expected. The raspberry flavor is great, and it's quite sour, but there's not much funk or anything else happening here. It's not too sweet and comes off much drier than its little sister Rose de Gambrinus. Mouthfeel is thin with heavy carbonation, would've liked a little more body here. Overall, this is another fine beer from Cantillon, but I wouldn't rank this up there with the best of their lambics. I enjoyed it more than Rose de Gambrinus, but of the Lou Pepe beers, it's definitely the simplest.

The raspberries come through acidic and sharp with hints of vinous shreds. Flavor carries surprising balance. The tartness and buxelles funk are soo well balanced with generous bounties of raspberries. The whole thing comes together and reminds me of a freshly picked raspberry during the high sun of an August day mixed with the grit of a solid days hike. A little full bodied with reserved carbonation accentuated the generous fruit endowment for the beer. Finish made me want another sip of the beer, and a gulp of ice cold water.

The acidity intensifies as the beer is held in the mouth but there is enough sweetness in the flavor to balance from the full fruity raspberry enhancement. The taste comes off almost as bitter/spicy from the carbonic acid the high carbonation level provides. There is a puckering, mouth drying quality w/ slight woodiness and extra tart raspberry juiciness as it finishes with some residual berry, but the funk and bacteria sour flavors linger into the dry end. Simply a wonderful fruit lambic, not many out there that are this complex and able to be savored in the way I found this to be.

Awesome....but this is a framboise where raspberries should reign supreme. The raspberries may have reigned over this bottle at some point, but honestly the sensations of tartness and eventually sourness overwhelmed a subtle berry note. The beer looks and feels of quality; it even smelled of a promising interpretation. However, the taste ultimately is dominated by sensations rather than flavors. Perhaps my bottle wasn't the best, but it was by no means compromised beyond reason. If I was to just see someone drinking this beer I'd have been infinitely jealous; having tasted it: not so much. The visual and smells keep this in the realm of respectability.","Cavery","Jul 17, 2011"

I will say simply that tart raspberry with a handful of other punching notes is about all I experienced with this beer and it wasn't as complex, sweet, or flavorful as I expected. If it's what the beer is intended to be, then great, it was good. If not and my bottle was compromised, then the beer must be damned amazing because that's the best compromise I've had.","Klym","Jul 17, 2011"

Mouth is very tight, refined, juicy raspberries, acidity, and barnyard brett. Acidity is mostly on the front end and not on the finish. The high acidity makes this much less attractive than the Lou Pepe Kriek from the same year.

The smell is all fruit. Sweet fruit, candy like, maybe a bit of tartness, but almost reminds me of a fruit soda. Very nice - though sometimes you don't mind the smell of garbage in a wild ale. The flavor comes across first as tart and acidic, but it has a nice sweetness to balance. The flavor in some ways reminds me of raspberry-lime juice, if there were such a thing, also a slight sourness that is really nice, like sour candy. The taste is just surprisingly clean for a wild ale, just a nice blend of sweet and tart, with the flavor of fruit, just amazingly balanced. The bo dy is a little fuller than I expected, probably from the sweet fruit juice, and the carbonation is low, but you can tell that it's there. Fairly nice. This is really a nice beer, the sourness is there in it's fullness, but it is just held in balance with the beautiful blending and the addition of fruit. It's not too acidic, and doesn't remind you of garbage, it's just a great lambic. Really a joy to drink.","taylorhamrick","Apr 05, 2010"

I think this was the worst beer I have ever smelled. The beer looked good, it was a cloudy reddish color. The taste was oddly pretty good despite the vomit and trash smell.

It's also the kind of framboise that you can just sit and sip, slowly enjoying it. The beer pours a deep, dark, but clear red. Although it pours with a slight head, it quickly disappears. The beautiful color and clarity, however, more than make up for the head...great appearance. The aroma is a great mix of raspberries and sour funk. Horse-stall, sweaty, earthy, musty aromas mix with just-picked berries. At least half of the fun of this beer is the smell. The sourness in the taste is very strong, but not overdone. Mouthpuckering and intense, but balanced with some fruit flavors. The barnyard character comes through in the taste as well. I love these lambics that don't ruin the experience with sweetness.

Pours a beautiful reddish orange with good clarity as long as you avoid the accumulated sludge in the bottom of the bottle. Sour and barnyard aromas intertwined with delicate raspberries are what you notice when you take a whiff. Personally, I like the depth that the kriek has, since I think it hold up better to the sourness, but this is very nice as well. The raspberries are somewhat light, but very acetic and the barnyard notes are just right- wonderful, they are there withouth being overwhelming and add a complex note to the aroma. The taste is extremely tart, maybe too much so. I would like to see some more fruitiness to balance the extreme acidity. Even so, the raspberry notes are laser-like in intensity, and to be fair there is an initial burst of fruit, and a savory, sour creaminess at the end. The mouthfeel is brilliantly sharp and tart followed by a soft, salty, creaminess. This is a little challenging- definitely a sipper, but fascinating.","Georgiabeer","Dec 17, 2008"

Besides sour there isn't any carbonation and the body is well... average? It's hard to say. It's a Lambic with raspberries, and I think the raspberries make it more drinkable.

The aroma is bitingly acidic, lightly tinted with raspberry essence. Funky and wild, with notes of aged swiss cheese and crabapple. Very complex and farmy. The flavor is immediately and unequivocally tart. Sour with just the slightest bit of give to keep your eyes from watering. The raspberry flavor comes through mostly in the end. It's sort of a raspberry apology for what your tastebuds just went through. Funky and wild through and through, very acidic with little in the way of sweetness or bitterness. Moldy and bacterial, with light cheesy sharpness and vinegar notes. Light on the tongue, with fizzy, energetic carbonation that carries the flavors well. Very challenging and unique. Delicious, but the sourness gets almost painful after half a bottle. Funny, because I recall easily splitting a bottle of the Fou'foune with the old lady, and that's one of their most intense.

Im a lambic beginner, but it just seemed well, not very complex.

Raspberries will never give the overall satisfying feel that Cherries will I feel; due to their more restrained profile, but don't underestimate the bite of a traditional Framboise for the sweet sickly crap that you may have had previously.

Some other fruity tones make their way into the picture but are mostly overwhelmed by the beautiful lambic tart and sour notes. This brew is fairly light bodied but just full of flavor with only a slight carbonation.

Cask wood flavors, while there, seems also a bit restrained to me. Medium carbonation, medium bodied. Those beers are great, no doubt about it, but I guess its the oak and fruit focus that makes the difference between a great beer and an exceptional one. Lou pepe framboise, while very complex and apparently well blended doesnt strike to me as the perfect blend of complexity and focus.

4.32,-5.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I consider myself fortunate any time I get Cantillion on tap and this was another one of those occasions.This beer was quite cloudy, as it should be. There was definitely a nice dark raspberry hue to the beer, also to be expected. The fragrance definitely contained the expected yeasty aromas with the sweet/tartness of the raspberries, also VERY good things in my book! I have come to anticipate a certain character from Cantillion and I was definitely not let down. The taste was as wonderful as I had hoped. Nice yeastiness to it as well as a delicate raspberry taste. The only reason it did not do better in the drinkability is because I may only want one, but would savour it as I did have that one. I wish I did not see that this is listed as ""limited edition""!! Enjoy!!","gueuzegeek","Nov 03, 2003"
