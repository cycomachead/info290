"Yuuuuup this is a goddamn kriek. Delicious as shit!"
""
"Pours a light purple body with one finger pink head that left little lace.  Aroma is tart, acidic, little bit sour but this isn't a sour ale aroma and there are cherries and hints of oak in the aroma. Smooth, easy to drink thanks to oakiness, the tart cherries are not too sharp but flavorful enough to give off acidic crispness and a little bit of sweetness.   Good balance and great drinker."

"This is an excellent Kriek, especially for the more available brands like Boon. Nothing incredible or world-beating, but definitely a very good beer."

"Had a bottle with Uncle Jimbo and some other beefreinds last night @ the Kulminator. THis was a 1983 bottle...... I am not a lover of this style but this one was nice to try..."

"The Mariage Parfait beers are easily the best Boons."

"D:  I'm having this right after the Boon Kriek 2012. It is far more complex than the former. From start, where it is opaque and not translucent, to the finish, where it is more acidic, woody and has more diverse sweet notes, and a dryer finish. Overall, a very nice ale, and I will be buying more for the cellar."

"Healthy pop from the cork followed by a dark red pour into a tulip glass, pink head retains nicely. Sourness and acidity is on the tame side, but good mix of cherry juice, woodsy mushroom funk, pleasant tartness, white wine grapes, wheat. Great mouthfeel, easy-going, drinkable and refreshing for a lambic, no hint of that 8%. A great subtle sour, nice mixing of sweet cherries, tartness, funk."

"O: great sour. Second bottle I have had and both were good. Very satisfying but that mineral component at the finish could be better but still almost sessionable for this relatively high abv kriek."

"Overall, my first Belgian Oude Kriek Lambic ale. I felt I needed to try this type to broaden my tastes a little, which it did. Not sure I would order it up in place of other types, but definitely different, and the taste profile lived up to what the Beer store said it would. I would rate it outstanding based on it's merits, but it is not my type."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Better than expected from Boon. Very tasty, but not as complex as its more illustrious brethren."

"To quote Burroughs, it's ""...the most decent, most deeply sour beer I have ever known!"" Or something to that affect. Either way it's the finest example of a lambic that I've had, so these beers just might be growing on me."
"O: This is a very solid, well made lambic. Definitely drinkable."
"Pours a blood-red pink body with a head that is unmistakably pink. Cream, sour cherries in the aroma. Flavor has a nice balance of sweet and sour cherries. Feel is a touch acidic, next to no carbonation, oak is light. Enjoyed it but not quite up to par with some other Krieks IMO."
""
""
""
""
""

"I just want to mention that this is further evidence that Boon is up there with Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen for top lambic producers. Between this and their standard Mariage Parfait they prove to be to producing top notch stuff. Would love to see some other fruit variants added to the Parfait range. Would be awesome!"

"Pours cranberry juice red with a finger of pink head that quickly subsides. The nose is clean and sweet with the smell of green apple skins, cherries, a little bit of barnyard, and a little bit of lactic acid. This is a delicious beer: it starts off with a sour bite, melding into sweet natural cherries and ending with another huge surge of sourness with grassy, lemony notes. I get a nice dose of vanilla in the aftertaste. It's never artificial and never over-the-top sour. The body is light with high carbonation."
""
""
""
"Deep ruby color with a soft, creamy pink head. Super smooth, mellow cherry creaminess in the nose. Sour black cherry, a bit of sherry, and a really delicate touch of vinegar along with spices. Big tart cherry flavor...there seems to be a lot going on, but it keeps everything corralled into a nice, tidy flavor profile. Much more sourness coming through here. Just enough sweetness, nice acidity, woody spice, must, and some sort of potpourri-like element. Astringent and puckering, but far from offensively so. Oh man, very satisfying. I'll try to keep my hands off the other bottle for a few years if I can."
"Very dark burgundy red with a delightful pink tightly foamy head. Aroma is ultra smooth. Awesome cherry pie, softly tart, sweet, and fragrant. Creamy with something vanilla-like, plus musky wood. Taste is tart and smacky. Woody, musky, tart dry berries. Grape skins, astringent and puckering. Very well combined concoction. The word encrusted comes to mind... Very dry, implosively so, brightly and smoothly carbonated, almost chalky texture. Very nice."

"Great kriek lambic, i really like the ruggedness of these Mariage Parfaits."
"O: An excellent sour kriek. The appearance is absolutely amazing and should be used as a standard for kreiks. This is way more sour than sweet. The cherries come through very dry and subtle. This is in my rotation constantly."
"O - I enjoyed this one a bit more than the geuze but it still wasn't worth what I had to pay for them. I think their are better examples of the style but if the price was right I would definitely pick up another bottle."
"overall a great kriek!"
"Boon's Kriek Mariage Parfait is a damn fine authentic kriek and although I prefer Gueuze Mariage Parfait, the kriek adds a unique twist. While the wet wood complexity is what makes this beer I could see it becoming taxing over time. A 375 is just he right amount. I'll grab some more of these guys."
""
""
""
"O: I got this beer originally as a gift for a friend of mine who was getting married, and grabbed an extra for myself. I'm quite glad I did. The beer was very enjoyable and I am happy I had a chance to try it. I'd definitely recommend this."
"This is a great sour. Would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
"Overall: 4.75: Darn close to the perfect beer. Perfectly cellared, there is clearly something inherent in this beer that takes it beyond what is already a complex style (i.e. kriek). I really feel like some lone beer reviewer after the nuclear apocalypse who found the last bottle of beer in the world. In fact, if that apocalypse ever comes, this is the beer I want with me while I watch the rocket's red glare. This beer gets my highest recommendation. Purchased at Mink's in Atlanta."
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep red color lambic with a nice large pink foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of sour and tart cherries notes is quite enticing. Taste is a wonderful mix between some tart cherries with some oak and light funky notes with lightly sweet finish and almost no acidity. Body is full with great carbonation. Wonderful interpretation of the style with great restraint on the acidity level."
"Overall- Real Impressed by this. Why can't the Boon regulars be this good?"
""
""
"O: Gorgeous beer. I'd consider giving all the rest up and being a Lambic, Kriek, and Framboise devotee. For the price of this beer in the 375mL, it is a no brainer. Once your past the sugary Lindemans beers (which I do still enjoy at times), try out the Boon."
""
""
""
" thin body typical of the style ,very fine kriek up with the best available"
""
""
""
""
""
"P.S.:Reading the other reviews just realized that this kriek has 8%, which is really high for a kriek. Didn't taste the booze at all, but this explains somehow its immaculate balance. No change of score though."
""
"Cheers!"
""
"This is quite a solid Kriek."
""
""

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"a lovely lambic i got in a trade for 2 heady toppers. worth it in my opinion. lots of nice sourness makes me love this even more than i should! can't really feel the heavy abv, it is masked well by the tart fruityness."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been into sour beers for several months now. Surprisingly, this is my first traditional fruited lambic. I will be making a trip to Belgium in a couple weeks and will drown myself in lambics to get a better stylistic comparison for this beer. For now however, i really love this kriek."
""

"O: This is a nice gueze really easy to drink and good sour flavor with a fruity/sweet kick. It was pretty flat and definitely seems like it will develop more over time (so i hope to report back on that) though that being said it is a solid beer that I would recommend is worth a try."
"Full bodied, intensely tart and puckering with a much funkier flavor than the aroma suggests. Lots of barnyard, sour acidity and lactic funk along with damp, toasted oak and a sweet vinous fruit character. Slightly syrupy and sweet with a strong cherry/cherry juice flavor. Very organic tasting with cherry skin and juicy fruit flavor balancing out the funk and acetic acid. Again, the pit from the fruit is evident, complimenting the funk and charred oak. Subtle acetic vinegar lingering in the bone dry finish but it's not harsh or solvent like at all with plenty of juicy cherry fruit flavor balancing things out. Not as extreme as some of the other fruit lambics that I've had but its a really nice Kriek that ill definitely be buying again."

"Overall: I would say this is very comparable to a cantillion in the flavor profile, but cantillion has a better mouthfeel. Really nice Kreik."
""
""
"D: besides the shitty appearance/carbonation level, this is a pretty solid brew. matured lamic flavor with plenty of sour cherry aspects. the flavor was definitely the biggest standout aspect in my opinion."
"O- The nice blend of fruit and tartness has some mellow hints of funk and the gentle fizz helps to enhance all the flavors. Very nice drinking beer."
"Tasted along with a '10 Cantillon Kriek, a '10 Drie Fonteinen Schaarbeekse Kriek, and a '07 Drie Fontienen Oude Kriek. Ranked in the bottom two."
""
""
"I'm glad I decided to take a chance on this beer. I will probably make this one of my go to sours as I can readily find this beer. Nice!"
""
""
""
"This is a solid, middle of the road kriek, by which I mean you get a nice dose of sour fruitiness without the over the top puckering power of the more extreme examples, but it also isn't a candy sweet fake attempt at the style. You can actually find on store shelves on occasion and it's not prohibitively expensive, two more factors to recommend it."
""
""
""
"From the bottle purchased at Beer and Gin House in Gent. The larger 37.5 cl bottle with cork. Label lists this as the 2011 harvest."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very pleasantly sour, well-made, enjoyable lambic. It will not appeal to fans who judge these things purely by how sour they are. This one is too well-balanced. The acidity is not at all overwhelming. It is definitely far superior to Boon's standard Kriek and is well worth the extra dollar or two in price."
"O: Pretty disappointed. If you like sweet krieks, this is all you. If you want something that's tart and sour, might want to go a different route. 3"

"375 ml caged and corked bottle, 2008 vintage. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a dark red/purple color with about an inch pink head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing at all. The brew smells like tart and sweet cherries, funk, oak and some earthy aromas. It tastes like tart and sweet cherries (more tart than sweet), oak, funk, and some vinegar and raspberries. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. I liked this beer, and I think it's definitely worth trying. $6.99 a bottle."
"Drink- I really thought I struck gold when I found these on the shelf. I was disappointed to say the least. Oud Beersel, Cantillon and 3F are way better options."

"Pours a clear dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some cherry and berry aromas. Taste is much the same along with some woody flavors on the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is super tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"All 4's.... I HOPE/know I will get to try it again. :-)"
"Deep red in body with light cherry head that stays. Smells horsey, cherry with some floral notes. Tastes of very sour cherries, horse blanket, some booze, tangy, with funk. Heavy carbonation with a medium body. Tasty, extra sour, funked out. Real good in the hot weather for 4th of July celebratin'."
"O: I was really impressed with this one. Surprisingly drinkable at 8% ABV. I think it finds a great balance of tartness and sweetness. Definitely recommend trying if you're a fan of lambics."
"An incredibly drinkable and tasty kriek, though not at all in the upper echelon of the style."
""
"O - A very solid kriek. Very sour and mouth puckering with some light oak and brett notes. A very good starter kriek that I actually prefer to the Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek. Still stumped at why the mariage parfait series has such a high abv though."
""
""
""
""
"O- A pretty nice kriek, it's a bit sweeter than I would like, it's very drinkable but I easily preferred the Geuze Mariage Parfait."
"Wasn't sure that it would be a ""true"" kriek, as opposed to a sweet one, but it's quite nice. Would gladly drink again, and no worse than the standard krieks from other brewers/blenders. Only a Lou Pepe would be a significant step up."
"A massive thanks goes out to caSSino for bringing this one out during cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a ruby reb with a one finger pink head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, cherry, wood, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, cherry, and sugar. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This was a really well balanced brew. The funk aspect on this one really added a nice touch to everything else going on here. I went into this one expect to pick up on tart cherries, but they were more along the lines of sweet cherries. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance."
""
"O- very nice lambic with lots of sour and tartness. Just enough fruit notes to balance out the sourness and acidity."
""
"This is a shockingly great Kriek... hell I may go buy a half case for putting down."
"Quite impressed, like this far more than the gueuze version."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’m finding this one every drinkable in that each sip leaves me wanting more and the beer is disappearing more quickly than I’d intended with this one. My overall impression is that this is a well made beer and an example of something I’ll hope to be having again in the future. I’m also reaching the conclusion that I definitely prefer my fruit lambics relatively fresh so that the fruit flavors are still strong throughout the beer. I fond this a really nice Kriek and think I’m beginning to develop an appreciation for what the blender contributes to the mix."
""
""
"O: More sour than I had anticipated. The 8% abv is non-existent yet it still remains a sipper due to the higher than average lactic and vinegar qualities. Although there's an abundance of raspberry notes, the cherry comes through beautifully towards the back end of the palate. This is a really nice Kriek that would make a great dessert."
""
""
"Good, real cherry flavor with an okay raw lambic presence. I've had better, but this is still a solid authentic lambic."
""
""
"O – Overall this was delicious lambic that I really enjoyed. The cherry was not astringent and the tart acidity was not overwhelming."
"M-light and crisp. carbonation is high and bounces on your tongue."
""
""
"Overall: This is a really smooth sour ale. The cherry and tartness are quite refreshing. I would definitely have another."
""
"Overall this beer is bomb and if you can try it go for it. bomb!"
""
"A well-aged kriek, to be sure. Boon delivers again."
""
"Very very pleased with this beer, definitely hitting the store tomorrow to pick up a couple more!"
"And the reveal is…2008 vintage of Boon's Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait. So close! 0/4 on the actual beer but 2/4 on the style. Man, can't believe this is 8% ABV…tastes like it is 5%. Looking at my Oude Kriek review they are pretty similar, though I rated this one slightly better. An awesome beer and an awesome start to the night...should have been a Want. Thanks Kyle!"
""
"2008... red with a pink head that this to a collar. nose is black cherry with touches of sweetness, wood and funk amid a mildly brett-spicy backbone. reminds me of the cherries, the cherry tree and the farm they are on. taste is a well balanced mix of the above with black cherry and wood flavor dominating to me. just barely sour, and not as sweet as the nose led me to think it was going to be. medium body with almost prickly carbonation and a very cherry finish. a completely different animal than say, Hannsens (the best!). overall, very very good. definitely has it's own personality, and it is interesting to see what happens to the lambic flavors when the abv is elevated a bit."
"2008 vintage. Too bad no one's getting married right now... This stuff pours a clear pale rose topped by a couple fingers of lightly off-white foam. The nose is a blast of tart cherry hovering above sour orange, spicy white wine grapes, and a touch of wheat-y funk. The taste follows this recipe pretty closely, with the cherries really blossoming on the tongue. They range from overtly tart to almost sweet, every iteration sloshing across the tongue in eccentric waves. A bit more sour funk here, but not by too much. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a damn tasty brew, one that makes the 3F Schaerbeekse Kriek completely obsolete (especially for the price)."
""
"(D)- Overall, a solid Kriek. An easy to drink and enjoy offering, so very approachable if you are just getting into the style. Surprisingly refreshing too."
"Dark red hue. Light pink finger of head. Full on new pool toys with a hint of arm pit funk. Macerated cherry skins and a mild sweetness. Flavors are mild sour with a good amount of sweet cherry. The funk is present but nothing like I hope for in my krieks. Medium body with a mild amount of carbonation. Not my favorite kriek but not horrible."
""
""
"I grabbed three of these when a case came in -- just in case I thought it was especially good. I'll be going back today to grab another four to sit on. Considering the price and availability, I'd say this beer joins Cantillon's tier for lambics. I am very impressed."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a pretty high level of carbonation which, by the way, suits this beer to a T, the mouthfeel is awesome and..the beer drinks awesome as well. What a wonderful brew!"

"2008 vintage, purchased in Louisville awhile back and shared with the fiance. It pours a medium bodied bright cherry red with a good amount of carbonation and a two finger bright pink red. The aromas are very dry and bretty with a good dose of sour and tart cherry. It's also a little vinous. It has nice and sharp flavors of sour cherry with red wine notes and a lot of funk. It's a little sweeter than the nose would lead you to expect but is still pretty dry. It drinks medium in body, has nice flavor, and keeps you salivating as opposed to killing your palate with brett. Overall this is a fine Kriek and was well worth the $8."
"O- I like this pretty much. I can count the lambics I've had on two hands, and this is isn't the best but certainly isn't the worst."
"O: This is one of my favorite fruit lambics. It is excellent. Very drinkable, complex, with an excellent sour cherry flavor."
"Overall, fantastic. So glad I was able to get a few of these. A must have for the lambic connoisseur."
"This held up really well against some awesome sours and personally I thought it was several times better than the Marriage Parfait Geuze"
"Schaerbeek ""pie cherry"" flavors, tart and complex. Wet oak traces emerge in the drying aftertaste. Moderate sourness and puckering, cherry skin and tannic bitterness as it warms up. Resonating tart aftertaste, cherry pits, dried stems, and skins altogether. Light feel, a little spritzy, it dries up quickly on the palate. A nice variation on Boon Oude Kriek, more of a pie cherry flavor and less intense sourness but it holds it's own. Nice pairing with dark chocolate."
"O: This is one exceptional kriek, and easily rivals Boon's Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait in terms of quality and depth. This would make an incredible after-dinner treat."
"D. Not incredibly complex, but not as dull/ uninteresting as some reviews seem to suggest."
"Rich Raspberry taste wraps around the tongue and then puckers the cheeks with the tartness. Very nicely done. Some subtle apple, maybe pear like flavors dancing around in the back now as well, before really drying out for the fini"
"Huge thanks to Thirstybird for breaking this one out. 750ml corked and caged bottle - 1995 vintage purportedly from Frank Boon's personal cellar. Pours the color of maple syrup with no head. Clarity is hazy without being cloudy. Aromas of leather, tart cherries, tannins and a suggestion of sweetness comprises the nose. Taste follows nose - earthy, leathery and tart cherry flavors come out. Some oxidation is also present, as well as whiskey notes and tobacco. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a virtually still carbonation, a slight acidity and a mild oily/viscous quality to the texture. I'm not really sure how to describe this brew. It's by far the oldest beer I've had, and it's quite interesting and complex with some Oud Bruin qualities. A little definitely goes a long way though because there is so much going on with this beer."
"O: this beer could become even better if I would wait a few years? I'll try that! Looking forward already."
"375ml bottle dated 2008 harvest with a best by date of 2030 so this must have been bottled in 2010. Bright red with a punk head that looked great at first and then died even though the beer was very fizzy (dirty glass?) . Smelled like cherries, no must, no barnyard, no lambic. Taste was tart cherries but I want the funk too and I got none. Mouthfeel was also way too fizzy for my liking."
"This beer is awesome. It's a an almost opaque cherry wood color with a huge head that leaves a very thin delicate lace. It's got great cherry aroma. There is a good bit of funky with sharp brett but also very bright fruit. There is a nice bit of perceived sweetness that helps ground the funk. Love it."
"A good Kriek that, by design retains some sweetness and fuller cherry flavor leaving it less than bone-dry but not as sickly sweet as many others- a good compromise to taste and texture."
"Overall this is as good of a strong Kriek as any I have tasted. Very well put together."
"Future outlook: This beer is one of the few that I think might actually improve with certain food/desert pairings (exactly what, I'm not quite sure yet). No matter....can't get it around here, but happy to have tried."
"As a fruit lambic, this offering is not very good. The cherries are prominent but there's little tartness or cheesiness that usually accompanies a top-notch offering from the style. A bit too sweet too. I won't revisit this one."
"O: Another nice Kriek. A well crafted product."
"D: Good a nice drinkable brew."
"Big thanks to G311 for the hook-up. 2008 bottle. It pours a translucent oxblood hue and has a smattering of small bubbles atop. The nose is full of rich sour cherry notes and a small amount of tannic oak. Funk, per se, is limited; tartness is not. The flavor delivers, again, intense sour cherry notes and is exceptionally vibrant. Complementing the fruit, musty oak and faint notes of mulled spice, especially cinnamon, are suggested. The feel is silky and very softly carbonated, and it has a mellow dryness on the finish which is quite nice. Overall, it does not blow me away in any specific regard, but it is exceedingly solid across the board."
"Pours an attractive purple tinted red, thin cap of pinkish hued head, minimal head retention, but active bubbles spew constantly to the top. Scent is muted, tart cherries, lightly sweet grahmn cracker, faint touches of earthyness. First sip brings a nice taste of mildly tart cherries combined with mildly sweet grahmn crackery malt, the backbone has a mildly earthy feel, touches of mild vinegar - and for as many times as i said mild, thats agood thing because none of the flavors overpower making this highly drinkable - finnished with notes of blackberry, raspberry and red wine. Body is medium, bone dry finish. A nice all around approachable but sophisticated kriek."
"2008 vintage..A firey purple blaze descends, spewing forth a voluminous pink front that eventually settles into a small pinking whitehead. Sour and sweet cherries, a little acetobacter and a little sweetness in the nasal aroma. Starts with tang and zip, then the sweet cherries begin to mellow it out, bringing some sweetness to the table. The tart vinegar comes through towards the middle and end, and it finishes with a long sweet and sour cherry flavor that can only be described as in my mouth. A bit drying in the coating of my cavernous maw, but absolutely delectable. A wonderful lambic, something that mine shall aspire to."
"O - As others have mentioned, not an especially complex Kriek, but a very solid and interesting version. Very pleasant drinker that I'm very happy to have tried."
"You can't feel that there is 8% ABV in this beer. And it is refreshingly and intriguing and feels very original."
"O - I really loved this Kriek, right up there with the Cantillion version. I would like to grab a few to lay down for a couple of years."
"O: A great beer without question, but I think it would benefit from a bit more time in the cellar (some residual sweetness). I have two more from the 2008 bottling and I will sit them for at least two years before trying again."
"Pours a really nice red color with a beautiful pink head that sticks around for quite some time, leaving behind ample lacing. The nose has a bit of a dry herbal character along with some oak and cherries. Mild acid in there as well. The flavor has more dry earthiness and an odd herbal character. Cherries are fairly minimal. Bit of an oak presence with a touch of tannin. Dry finish without too much acid. Nowhere near as good as the plain Mariage Parfait."
"O - Easy to get down for the ABV. This is a solid and enjoyable beer, nothing really special going on but I like drinking it."
"D - At 8%, this is an easy way to get a buzz on quickly, as it goes down like juice. Perhaps they should rename it Mariage Panty Dropper. Not the most complex kriek, but an enjoyable one nonetheless."
"D - Easily drinkable...goes down so quick. I wish this was distributed in the US, but of course, it's awesome and not on the shelves. Get you some of this!"
"O: As noted above, not the best representative... but certainly a respectable offering."
"Appearance is a lovely red hue, like cherries. smell is funky, earthy and tart. taste is funky, sweet and sour cherry, overall very pleasant. the mouthfeel is nice, with some real crisp carbonation, it helps cut the acidity. real nice. very drinkable, i'm a big fan of this beer, surprised it doesn't have more reviews."
"Beer is thin and the beer has this musky, mildewy flavor on the late palate that I wasn't expecting at all. The forward is some mild sweetness from the cherries, mild fruit flavors, lactic creaminess, some acetic bite, and a mildly tart finish. Overall it's not the best lambic I've ever had but it was decent. I'd have it again for sure."
"Bottle. 2008 vintage. Poured into a tulip glass a bright, vibrant red color with a pink collared head. Very funky aroma with an underlying sweet cherry note. Some wood as well. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation. More sweet than I was expecting. Slightly tart cherry. I'd be interesting to see if this would sour up with some time onas of now it's just more sweet. Slight medicinal notes."
"Note: 2008 vintage"
"Reviewed on 6/6/2010. 2008 bottle. Pours a deep red with a thick pink head. Aroma of light funk, smelly diaper, perhaps a hint of fruit. Flavor has much more sweet cherry fruitiness and a tart cherry finish. Very tasty and drinkable, I really enjoyed this one."
"I thought this was a very nice ""change of pace"" beer, as Lambic's aren't my usual style of choice. This was excellent and I think it's great to see more alternatives to the overly sweet lambics that are more commonly available."
"Poured into a standard snifter at about 55 degrees F, 1-inch head, light lacing, deep beautiful cloudy magenta. Aroma is quite sour and funky, and I THINK I'm smelling tannins, although I never reviewed wine, so it is an ingredient that I am still a novice at pointing out. There is some oak aroma/flavor behind the tart cherries. This doesn't taste like a cough syrup at all (which is what I expect with everything made with cherries. Gross). This is a much deeper, classier taste, unlike the super-sweet flavors of Lindeman's lambics. I have a couple more bottles aging, so once I get a little more experience under my belt I will review this again."
"Mouthfeel was borderline medium-bodied with a slight effervescent feel, but very smooth overall. I particularly enjoyed this while it was very cold because every sip gave off an incredible refreshing vibe. I could now see why some of these Belgian blenders prefer to fill up pints of this remarkable stuff. I finished my 375 bottle in 15 minutes- this was seriously delicious and easily drinkable. Definitely buying another bottle or two of this for future consumption. Best until 2028? Yes sir, too good. Thank you, Mr. Boon."
"Very glad I got to try this beer. It definitely lived up to the hype."
"95 Points."
"D- I liked this, it just did bot blow me away. A bit one sided although the cherry component is quite bold and noticed. A bit more oak would of been a treat and a tad more bubbles as this seemed kinda dead, although it could be unblended. Glad I tried it."
"D- very drinkable and not to sour. Not saying that you can get to sour I love me some sour but this is an easy intro to the style and a tasty treat for the super fan."
"Highly reccomended for the style."
"This is quite nice, I definitely prefer a bit more funkiness and complexity in my Lambics, but this definitely gets the job done. It is very quaffable, though perhaps just a touch heavier than I prefer."
"D- This is a very good, well balanced lambic overall. Certainly one of my favorite krieks. This was a nice surprise as well as I wasn't expecting this brew to be SO good. Would love to have this again!"
"Medium mouthfeel with good to high carbonation. Not gushing, so highly carbonated in a good way."
"D-this is a very tasty brew, nice amounts of acidity and sourness with a ton of sweetness. the oak is more in the nose, lighter in the flavor with a good presence."
"D: An extreme beer before its time, this beer is great. The fact that no one seemed to enjoy it as much allowed me several oz, and I'd gladly drink this again"
"This lambic has held up incredibly well for being at least fifteen years old, too bad this is not in production anymore along with the gueuze too, would love to drink again but not likely, recommended"
"Tart cherries and sweet berry flavors in the finish, quite dry too. Some tart and dry raspberry, dried apricots, very tasty. Low carbonation but proper for the style. Glad I got to try this one, it was quite good."
"Unbelievably drinkable. It's almost sherry or port like. But an aged version. This was my first seriously aged beer, so I am sure my naiveté is making a difference here. It is just in a different class at this point from the age. I think this was an outstanding beer and a real treat to have."
"This bottle was dated 1995 by far the oldest bottle conditioned beer I have had to date,poures a color of a ripe cherry with a thin white spotty head.Aroma of sour cherries and vinegar with a woodiness but its pretty faint,taste is tart but not as tart as alot of beers this style maybe because of the age also a light sherry flavor in the finish.A nice find not my favorite style but I kinda like this more than others."
"1983 vintage: sampled at the kulminator in Antwerpen, Belgium. A costly 13 euros, but it was damn worth it! A lovely pinkish/reddish brew with a small cap of off-white foam. The aromas scream 'traditional kriek' and consist of some crazy lambic funk, cherry pie filling, slighlty medicinal hops, and some light malts. The taste is quite awesome! It consists of cherry pie filling, exotic spices, yeast, some light malts, and some great meidicinal hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but good enough for me, and the drinkability is quite excellent. Sure, I would have rather had a cheaper, more recent vintage of this brew...but this was the only vintage that they currently have at the Kulminator. and who else is going to have this stuff!?"
"Tart, acidic, funky. Cherries dominate with musty earthy flavours all over the pallette. Nutty hints in the background. Mouthpuckering sour finish with a heavy oak flavour lingering on. Medium bodied, very gently carbonation. The woody / oak flavour becomes a little overbearing eventually. Overall, well worth $10.50 I paid for it!"
"Hazy, thick, pea soup opacity married with sludge brown and blood red and a soapy, frothy head that won't die. Powerful, swirling carbonation -- really lively. Plum and tart cherry skin aromas mingle nicely with a sour-ish, yeasty, unrefined earthy character. Carries through to the palate, which is suprisingly integrated and held together. Certainly, the sourness of a traditional lambic shines through. But there's a great understated cherry flavor and a musty dullness that tempers the ascerbic nature of the beer. Very well put together, and as far as traditional-style lambics go, this thing is remarkably easy to drink. For those looking for a slightly less jarring introduction to the traditional take on the style -- if you think it IS jarring, of course -- this might be a good start."
"i paid about $10 for this. a much much better value than the more over-sweetened and popular lambics."
"The aroma is musty with some cherry. It finishes very dry. 1995 vintage. Loved it."
"One word springs to mind here- exceptional. stinky barnyard earthiness in the aroma, quite vinous, almost pinot noir like, very complex, aged cherry skin, lovely lambic tart sourness, i absolutely love this beer."
