"I have had gallons of this at the tavern of the same name several years ago located an alley or two off the Grote Markt in Brussels and from time to time score a bottle or two. My memories of Mort Subite Kriek with an omelet for a late breakfast probably influence my score upwards. The nose is cherries with a slight funk. This is a beautiful brilliant cherry color with a pink tinted foam cap and a fine bead. The beer is light, big on cherries, tart with a light balancing sweetness – probably a little sweeter than some Krieks but not like soda pop sweet. It is very effervescent with a fine soft carbonation. Very drinkable, especially for breakfast."

"O – This beer is very drinkable and to be honest I was surprised to find myself really liking this Lambic as I have not been a fan till now. This one has an award under its belt, ‘WBA 2012 best sour’ and I personally think it deserved it."

"25 cl bottle into a Mort Subite goblet. Clear amber red body, small head, good lacing. The smell is all cherry. Taste begins with sweet cherry, tart in the middle, cherry in the end with a fresh cherry aftertaste. Light body, pleasant medium carbonation. A fresh drinkable kriek. Not very sour, but not too sweet either. Tastes like real cherry, not artificial."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and the cherry flavors didn't seem to be artificial or too sweet."
""

"(O)- Its a milder lambic for sure. Great fruit with some oak, just lacking the complexity and sourness one can expect for the style."

"Overall this has a mild tartness, lacks any real sour character, and has such a candy cherry sweetness it is a bit cloying if not for the carbonation to clean off the finish. Quite a light beer, only a slight oak character, it's a bit of a fruit bomb but makes a pleasant refreshing aperitif, would want to restrain myself to one though, it's more balanced than the smell would indicate and makes a refreshing if overall if mostly exciting Kriek."

"I first had this beer at Belgo Centraal in the Covent Garden region of London. It was a fantastic introduction to lambic and kriek beers. Then it seemed to disappear for a couple of years. Now it's back as a mass-produced product complete with artificial flavoring and color. Sad, really, that it's no worse than Bud."
""
"Overall - This isn't something i would purchase regularly, but a nice beer to have in the summer or looking for something with a nice fruit infusion."
"Pours with a dark red color, exact color of cherries, and is topped with weak head. The aroma was a bit disappointing (luckily the only disapointing thing here). I expected a pleasant cherry aroma, but I got a slight acid smell reminding me of cheap wine. The taste was a completely different story - sweet and slightly hoppy towards the end. I could definitely taste some cherries. One of the best krieks so far, sweet (not too much) and easy to drink."
""
"Overall: a decent fruity beer, but not a great lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
"While this was not a bad drink, it is not something I would go chasing after anytime soon. I think I will give the style another chance, but perhaps with something of a better reputation."

"This pours a maroon red color with a foamy, light pink head. The aroma is rich with sweet cherries. The taste is sweet with cherries evolving into a tart finish. Decent flavor, but the texture is a little thinner than I would have imagined. A smooth, refreshing desert beer that I’m a little surprised doesn’t have a higher rating."

"This beer was bought in France for a whopping 2,5 EUR, and I see nothing in it's quality to justify it, it's a sweet-sour beer that tastes like more like strawberry/cherry wine. The aftertaste lasts very long, at least that is value for money."
"Overall the beer is very crisp and refreshing. The raspberries come through well, maybe a little too sweet and not sour enough."
""

"Served from tap into Trappe Door tulip. Poured ruby red with a two finger off-white with slight pink hue head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, sugar, cherries, fruit, and subtle tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, earth, strawberries, cherries, and subtle tart. It had a light feel on the palate with very high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. Unfortunately nothing really jumped out at me on this one. Tons of sweetness and fruit going on, but that was about it. Kind of seemed like this was the only thing going on with it unless you investigated further. Worth your time trying at least once, but that is about it."

"I would say this is an introductory Lambic. Not quite in the same league than the Cantillon."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"Final Grade: 3.63, a solid B grade. Mort Subite Kriek is flavorful, tasty stuff that I'd say is worth a try, but it still kind of straddles that line between alcopop and beer, so purists or serious lambic fans probably won't dig it that much. I really wish these sorts of brews were available year-round in my area, but for now it seems fruit lambics will remain a once-in-a-while thing for me. I rarely drink these styles in general, so it's fair to mention that I'm far from a connoisseur here. This might not be the best kriek in the world, but it's still tasty and easy to like, with a nice balance of cherry tartness, sweetness, and funky lambic goodness. A very quaffable brew that I would suggest as an entry point into the style for anyone curious."

"Overall – A nice lambic. Very drinkable and quite tasty. It is more on the sweet side then on the sour side making it more refreshing and faster drinking. Good for a go if you get a chance."
"Hmmm - overall, is it beer or is it soda?"

"A little sweet and one-dimensional, but tasty and easy-drinking."

"This kriek came out with a red pour and a finger of white head. Very nice retention and lacing. It smelled like cherry juice. Not much else, just cherries and sweetness. The taste is so sweet, no sour or funk at all. Basically tastes like a sweet cherry soda with less carbonation. I enjoy it, but it isn't great. I will say that this is at least pretty damn drinkable. I just wish this had some funk, too sweet and average."
"Pours a clear cranberry juice color with a reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A small curtain of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of cherry juice and cherries with a slightly tart quality. Taste is also of cherries and cherry juice with only a mildly tart quality. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing too fantastic."
"O - Overall, I really enjoyed this Kriek. It feels rustic and delicate at the same time. Please note it was difficult for me to judge since I have never drunk anything similar. Having said that, I think it would benefit from being sweeter in order to balance the tartness."
""
"Overall, this beer serves more as a cooler or aperitif due to its low ABV and excessive sweetness."
""
"O-This is a drinkable lambic with strong cherry flavor which skews towards being more sweet than sour but not overly sweet to the point of tasting artificial."
""
""
""
"Single finger head on a reddish brown body. Tons if lacing, light aroma which is as expected mostly fruity and raspberry like. This is an excellent lambic with a nice raspberry and medicinal cherry taste up front and brown sugar finish with moderate to high carbinaion and light body. Overall very drinkable and one of the better lambic beers out there."
"D - A very strong cherry presence with enough sweet and sour character to be eminently drinkable."
"The body was far too thin for my preferences, but otherwise was smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a very nice beer that had a good, even balance of sweet and tart. Certainly worth your time when you have a chance."
"""Matured in oak casks for several months"" says the promo material... why even bother? Sort of a joke compared to traditional lambic producers aging for years to achieve the depth and complexity sorely missing here."

"overall, enjoyable, although the sweetness of the cherries does become cloying"
"Drink- Overall this one is about on par with other mass produced intro lambics in the US. The color and feel are the best thing about this one. Probably wont come back to it."
"Pours a clean reddish pink to amber color with a light pink head. In the aroma, mellow dark cherry. In the taste, a nice bitter to sweet dark cherry and not too much. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry cherry in the aftertaste. It kind of reminded me of Cherokee Red."
"I had this on tap at De Muze in Antwerpen. It's a dark red carbonated candy in a glass. I really wanted to like this - I expected it to be more complex... To me, this is not much better than the very commercially available Lindeman's. It tastes artificial. This is a beer for the non-beer drinker at your party. Well, I will give fruit lambics another try with the near 10-year-old kriek I recently acquired."
"Purchased a growler at a place not far from my home. I go back and forth with Lambic and this beer is one of the reasons. I want to like it more but it is on the verge of being way too sweet. The color is almost too red, it looks like cranberry juice and the taste that lingers isn't something far from cranberry juice. I don't think I will be getting another one, especially at the price I paid."
"O: This lambic is an easy drinker and is on the sweeter end of the spectrum for the style."
"This is a great desert beer and a great introduction to lambics. It has both a quality fruit taste and a proper tartness and it looks great to boot."
"Middle of the road kriek."
"O: Not for me. I can appreciate it for what it was, but not for me."
"O- Too sweet for me, ill pass."
"Time to pack the girlfriend for the trip home to Atlanta. She liked this beer, but I didn't love it. Still love the style though."
"O: Definitely a guilty pleasure beer that I'd swipe from my wife when she's not looking."
"Arrived with two fingers of dark pink to red head, body is deep red. Aroma is light amount of funk and bitter cherry. Flavor is good, cherry again a bit of funk, a little tart as well. Light on the palate and crisp carbonation. Also the head laces very nicely"
"Good, but would be better with less sugar."
"This beer is too sweet and sugary. Consider drinking it if you're reaching for a Smirnoff Ice. You just got iced, bro."
"Much sweeter and deeper than traditional lambics I have had. This isn't bad at all, but I prefer a drier, more sour kriek."
"O: Certainly a guilty pleasure. Although it's not necessarily traditional, it's still enjoyable in small servings."
"Deep red in colour, topped generously with off-white (or barely pink) head. Tart cherry aroma is simple but very pleasant. While this has been sweetened, it's not a syrupy mess of a beer. It is still predominately tart, but not puckeringly so. It tastes of sour cherries with a light tannic note. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This would work well as a simple thirst quencher during the summertime. I was worried this would be a cloying mess like the Chapeau sweetened fruit lambics, but this is actually decent."
"Poured clear, bright red, with a foamy white head. Obvious aroma of cherries, with not much else coming through. Heavy cherry taste, more sweet than sour, which is sometimes good. Comes off a little medicine-y than authentic fresh cherries, but still very nice. It is a kriek after all. Light and sweet mouthfeel, and quite drinkable if your in the mood for a good cherry beer."
"Overall, a good and solid kriek."
"D - Drinks well. For a tart fruit beer, this is a very drinkable brew."
"D: It's a fruit beer that tastes like fruit candy. Easy to drink for sure just not super interesting."
"D - fantastic dessert beer. Give me this with a chocolate and I'll order it everytime."
"d pretty drinkable...I'm pretty sure I could polish off quite a few of these on a hot day."
"Pours crystal clear and red if looked at in light, but a brownish colour when looked at from atop... Nice head, little lacing, but excellent retention. The aromas and palate are dominated by dried cherries, but with a light sourness that becomes puckering slowly over time. Enjoyable, and a nice light sour IMO."
"Light body with good carbonation. Drinkability is very good. Well balanced and refreshing. A nice light fruit limbic."
"Please bear with me as this is my first time trying lambic. I picked up a 25 cl bottle at Carrefour for about $2 and poured it into a champagne flute. It gave me about 1-2"" of pinkish head which provide generous lacing and appeared a reddish cranberry color. It was clear not cloudy. Smell is cherries, not too much else, there is something else fruity in there but can't put my finger on it. Taste is malty and cherrries, like a cherry soda, alcohol taste is barely present. Mouth feel is bubbly and light-not as much as champagne but still somewhat dry. Drinkability is okay but when I buy something Belgium I am looking for something a bit more manly. My wife didn't even like this. May try again but when I can get a Chimay red for almost the same price-why would I? I can now say I gave it a try!"
"Brigt red cranberry/cherry couloured body with a few fingers of lace 'fizzling' to some splotches with some sheets of lace. Nose is a sharp a tart one, cherry sweetness but there is a sense of the sourness here as well. Flavour has loads of cherry in it, sweet initially but sours up against the cheeks in the midmouth. Medium-high carbonation, and goes down fast and easy. I can see why she digs this. Fairly likeable and drinkable for my first lambic ever (surprisingly!)."
"The beer is dry tasting and tart with a lactic and cherry sourness to it. Behind this is a note of sweet baby vomit. My second sip has a berry-like, red wine character being noticeable in the flavor. This is quite tannic, though it is not overly astringent. This is not very complexly flavor and more vaguely fruity with some faded cherry flavors. This would be exceedingly light and quaffable if not for the tannic, cherry skin finish."
"D - The sweetness of this ruins the drinkability. It's ok, but not something I want often or even once and a while. Again, getting away from juices would probably make this better. One as a novelty is good enough for me."
"Pours a pinkish-red colour with bubbly white head. Lacing has some coverage of the glass. Smell is sweet cherry, almost like cherry flavoured candy. Taste is both sweet and a sour tartness. I haven't had a lambic before (that I can remember) so it is hard to review to style, but I do enjoy this. It is too sweet for an everyday beer for me, but I'd be willing to have this again sometime."
"D: A refreshing drink, however, I don't think its one to sit down the pub with all night. One is about all Id like to drink."
"D- Looks the part and smells promising, but this all melts away into a lifeless beer on the tongue. Shame."
"These artificially sweetened lambics are like fake breasts - sure, they look good and are appealing on a purely superficial level but they're depthless, shallow, cosmetic and lack the distinct character of *real* lambics. They may bring empty gratification, but it comes at the depreciation of natural means, product and palate integrity and traditional values."
"Looks like carbonated cherry NyQuil in the glass. Cherry soda dominates the aroma and flavor. Pretty sweet without much redeeming tartness. Has a dirty aftertaste, doesn't finish clean. Bleh, not a very good example of the style, even for a sweeter style lambic. Xtreme? Sorry."
"A rather typical kriek aiming for a broader public, a bit too sweet for me. As a digestif with some strong coffee after dinner it might work."
"D : I would drink it sometimes but not too much. The sweetness can be a little bit too much after one. I will try Mort Subite raspberry next time to see if it looks like the same thing!"
"Overall - Very pleased with this beer. I was surprised at the cherry taste not being sweet. I expected a lot of sweetness but was pleased without the sweetness and slight sour taste. Reminded me of a sour cherry candy. Definately a recommend for someone who wants a lager with flavour."
"A solid and flavourful, albeit one dimensional, lambic. Their Framboise seemed to be a bit more complex, and a bit less contrived in terms of taste, but this one still has its good qualities, with its fantastic appearance and light and bright mouthfeel. I'd probably pick one up again down the road, but I feel I'd be more inclined to pick their Framboise over this."
"After reading a bit on this style I see the purists may not be big fans - they add juices and suger to flavour rather than the whole fruit."
"375mL corked bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pinkish red color with a white head. Leaves really nice lacing. Sweet fruity aroma with cherries. The taste is mostly cherries with a nice balance between sweet and sourness. Good mouthfeel with a light dry finish. I'm not a big fan of this style, but this is a nice lambic."
"D: It's not bad, your middle of the road kriek."
"D: You must like sweet beers to enjoy this one."
"If this beer was cheaper I'd by it again, but at the moment I cannot justify the price."
"Overall a nice, refreshing beer."
"Not a beer I will pick up too often, but certainly one well worth trying. My favourite lambic thus far!"
"I adore Mort Subite. Such a nice beer to have on the off occasion. This one is laced with cherries. Aroma is very subtle but you can detect cherry and fruit. Taste is an explosion of taste. Cherry with the dry bitterness of cranberry with the bite of alcohol. Just a fantastic mouthfeel."
"It tastes sweet with cherries dominating but has a nice sour kick too."
"A pleasantly tasty, refreshing, and drinkable cherry lambic (if not a particularly complex one), the only danger being that one might get a bit tired of that particular fruit flavour, as with any fruit beverage. However, there's enough going on here to obviate that concern, at least until the end of this bottle."
"The sweet and sour mix suits my palate and I can see traditionalists pooh-poohing the sweetness and wanting more sourness, but I thought it fine."
"Pours the colour of strawberry juice with a rocky pink tinged head that exhibits good retention and leaves behind sticky globs of lace. Cherry candy aroma mixed with earth. Sweet cherry flavour, a touch of cider and hint of sour funk, and then coughdrop in the finish. Sweet and slightly sticky. Chewy mouthfeel with soft, but persistent carbonation. A decent beer, but I probably wouldn't buy again at his price. Like I said though, a good introduction, and that's more or less where I'm at."
"Pours a red touched ruby with a thick and frothy crème head. Nose is candied sugars. Flavor is cherries, sure. But it's just a sweetened seemingly artificial flavor profile. Clearly additives have been used. Feel is slick and sticky thick on liquid and the carbonation is standard. This is just like Lindemans. So if that is your thing, you'll be able to appreciate this more."
"Overall, not bad, but feels rather bland."
"I'm not terribly familiar with lambics. This seemed like a nice beer, but I get the feeling that there is more to the whole lambic scene than this. I'm convinced, though, that I want to try some others. Definitely worth trying."
"Magnificent."
"not bad, and definitely a more appropriate introduction to kriek than lindemans, as it isn't as sweet and medicinal. a better choice for easing a newcomer into the more traditional sour lambics."
"Just a hint of sourness."
"This is not my favourite style of beer but I like variety and this makes a very nice break from the IPAs and strong beers that I usually favour. I'll definitely buy it again."
"dinkability: quite good, i could certainly have more than one."
"Honestly, despite it being a very decent, cherry tasting fizzy beer, it has an industrial ""pop"" appearance to it. decent, not magnificent. in turn, i appreciate the elaboration of cantillon more nowadays."
"D: It's good, but the watery flavor makes this less appealing. I would drink a couple of these, but then the watery feel would be the deal breaker."
"The taste was dominated by sweet and sour cherries, with a tingling effervescence much like champagne. A very drinkable beer and a great way to finish off a really good pot of mussels!"
"Worth a try, pass lindemans and chapeau up for this stuff."
"The nose on the beer is with sweet cherries and a bit of tartness. This beer has a sweetness from the cherries and a slight tartness. Very balanced. The mouth feel is a bit creamy and the beer is pretty drinkable. Solid lambic all around."
"Pours a crystal clear cranberry juice red, big frothy light pink head forms, slowly settles down, leaving some lace foam on the glass, some decent retention, head stick around, solid layer, pretty rocky. Smell is very sweet, sugary, some cherry juice, wood, very earthy, some light funk and acidity. Taste is not too bad, very sweet cherry juice, oak, bread, kind of dry in the finish, light funkiness, woody, not as bad as I thought it would be. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Not exciting but an accessible Kriek for something wanting to check out the style. Not bad."
"D: Very drinkable for the style."
"LCBO in a moment of inspiration, albeit it gay inspiration. Pink froth with some fruity esthers. Medium bodied, though I am glad I shared this as drinkable, a little. Finishes sweet, that cherry sticky syrup, not too sweet, dtill retaining a sour edge."
"D - Not bad. Nothing too complex, but a nice refreshing drink."
"When I first went to Brussels, I got completely lost. I ended up out in the industrial wasteland and wandered for hours. When i finally found the Grand Place, the Mort Subite Kriek was what the waiter recommended. This was my first Belgian beer (and first beer other than macro lagers) and it turned me onto the right path. I know now this isn't the best of its kind, but on that day it was the greatest thing I had ever tasted. I'm glad the LCBO picked it up."
"Drinkability : une bière lambic correcte mais sans plus"
"pass on."
"Draft in proper glass at Toone in Brussels on 9/16/06."
"Pours sparkling deep cherry red with a pinkish head, very creamy head that laces well. Aroma of Vick's cough drops, Vick's cough drops, and more Vick's cough drops. Sweet cherry front, becoming tart in the middle and the finish. Mouthfeel was quite fizzy, a little too fizzy. This is not something I'd want a lot of, still, red beer is neat."
"Overall - A pretty good kriek. Probably too sweet for a lot of people but certainly worth a try though..."
"Poured from a corked bottle I brought back to the US from Antwerp. Maybe it's available somewhere here, but I haven't seen it. It's appearance was OK, red colored beer with pink foam. It smelled like cherries but not as strong as Lindeman's kriek. Same with the taste. Not really worth any effort to find, but not bad if it's offered to you."
"Mort Subite translates to Sudden or Instant Death. Yep, that pretty well describes this muddled mess. There seem to be too many ingredients. Very sweet but bland in the fruit department. Taste needs more cherries. Smell is pretty good though, fruity with a mixture of berries and medicinal sweet cherries. Thick frothy pink head looks good. Very pink, impressively pink."
"the champagne of kriek beers, its deep red like bull´s blood, spontaneous fermentation, like wine, its smell presents wheat, cherry, malt, hops; taste ample harmonious, a little metalic; good for cheese, and german cuisine, drinkabilty over the average, because is like appetizer; try with goblet. 78% recommended."
"Its the first lambic i taste, i dont know what to say, i think it fits the style properly, but it not my favorite beer style at all. Myabe is just that i miss the taste of malt from this beer (which i dont feel at all)."
"A very drinkable kriek, not a big tart unsweetened lambic but a drinkable fruit beer this is"
"Tastes tart and lightly sweet, some sweet spice and not much else. Mouth is not sticky, not overly sweet, even a bit crisp. This beer is tasty, nothing wrong with it but nothing special."
"Of course I'll have another one. Actually, I am."
"This is a very drinkable lambic. Probably a little kool ade for a died in the wool lambic lover, but I really liked it."
"The taste is crisp and only slightly tast, and the surprisingly large head adds a creamy aspect aspect to the mouthfeel. The level of acidity makes there more of a lemon taste than a cherry taste, though some cherry notes are still there. Later, as the beer warms, the sweet cherry flavor lingers in the aftertaste. Mmm...."
"Highly drinkable and an excellent kriek, one of the best I've had."
"Had this in Brussels at their bar. Fluffy pink frothy look with a lasting lacing head. Bright attractive cherry/ruby color in the glass (goblet). Not a ton of nose to it just a hint of cherry sweetness. Very carbonated lively tongue and mouth. Not complex tasting at all.. decent but no impressive layers of flavor and complexity that you expect from this style."
"Bottle  Poured a reddish brew with good carbonation. Aroma of cherries is overpowering with nothing else coming out in terms of aroma. Taste is bit too much cheery with not enough tart and tannic. Overall, this one is very refreshing but not the best from Mort Subite, nor close to the great kriek lambic."
"This kriek poured a clear red amber with pink foam that coated the glass. The smell was a modest cherry aroma (not too sweet). The taste was dominated by sweet cherries, though not overly sweet. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and moderate carbonation. A tart cherry flavor lingered a bit as an aftertaste. This was an OK kriek -- fairly refreshing."
"Red tinged gold.  2 fingers head.  This is a lot lighter than Belle Vue (unfortunately that's the only other kriek I've had).  Rather sweet, some cherry flavour.   It's more of a flavoured gueuze than a proper kriek.  Goes down well."
"It's red, but not candy red. It's drier than the framboise. The cherry is there but it meshes with the gone sour taste. The cherry seems to go really well with the natural lambic flavors."
"Sweet cherry flavour, with perhaps a bit of late sourness and tartness. Pretty light and refreshing, which makes it good to drink in summer, however it is perhaps a bit too sweet for me."
