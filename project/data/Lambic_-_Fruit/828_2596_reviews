"Tastes of sweet cherries, very intense, goes along with a decent bitterness, which is for a very long time not as present as the cherries themselves. The supporting tartness brings out the cherries realy good. In the end, bitterness gets stronger and takes over. Overall when you drink this beer, you feel like chewing on ripe cherries, which grow younger and more sour the longer they linger on my tongue. Fruits are present nearly to the very end. As the beer warms up, it reminds me of summer, because of its somehow warm smell. Carbonation grows more present in the end, revealing the bitterness of this beer."

"O: Refreshing, complex, a nice level of sourness at a reasonable price. Having had only a few authentic krieks from Belgium I’m no expert, but this about an 8/10 if Cantillon Kriek was a 10 - and much easier to obtain in the US.  I’d purchase it again."

"Overall an aggressive and real impressive kriek, which surprisingly is a bit of a challenge to drink.  A good solid brew, but kind of going overboard on aggression."

"Deep red pour with creamy pink head; smells like sweet cherry pie filling and lemon with a touch of bready malt. The cherry tastes surprisingly dry and intense. It steals the show and overshadows the base lambic. However what is there is really tasty. Moderately sour. There is some lemon and apple on the taste and an oakiness that adds some astringent medicinal quality. There is also an earthiness throughout but not very funky. The mouthfeel is great. Tiny bubbles and creamy head work as a perfect delivery system for this cherry pie in a glass. I really like this beer and glad I finally found it on the shelf at my local shop. It's nicely balanced and a pleasure to drink. Perhaps the base lambic would develop a little bit more with some age - but I'm not sure how the intense cherry flavor would fare. I'll just have to put one away for awhile and find out."

"375ml corked and caged bottle served in an Allagash chalice.  Best before 18-04-2032 printed on the back label.  Pours the color and clarity of cranberry juice with a rocky, three inch, pink-colored head.  Nose expresses citrus, cork, horse blanket and a hint of cherries.   Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a suggestion of cinnamon and cherry sucrets.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation that falls just shy of lively and a mild acidity.  Overall, a decent fruit lambic but a little too medicinal for my sensibilities."

"Decently tart, mildly dry, but not as much of the cherry as I'd expected.  I enjoyed it, but not sure it's worth another purchase at the price I paid."

"The best fruit wild/sour ale I've had.  The fruit is extremely prominent in this beer, undoubtedly due to the high ratio of cherries to lambic (400g/L per the label).  The base beer is extremely well made... bracingly sour and refreshing with no off flavors.  Extremely clear for a fruit beer and lambic-based one at that.  This beer shows off the art of brewing at as high of a level as anything on the market."

"Overall - Couldn't get rid of the excessive carbonation, which affected the taste. Good cherry flavor, decent lambic character."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/18/2032. Cork nearly popped itself off, but I caught it with the cage. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and rocky pink head with insane retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Beautiful. Aromas of big sour cherry, cherry skin, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, pepper, musty wet basement funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of funky/earthy yeast, sour cherries, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big sour cherry, cherry skin, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, pepper, musty wet basement funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness and yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cherry skin, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, pepper, wet basement funk, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity and balance of funky/earthy yeast, sour cherries, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an oudstanding kriek lambic style. All around awesome complexity and balance of funky/earthy yeast, sour cherries, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the modest acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"awesome brew here, as good as any of the 3F stuff I think, and one of the funkier more mature krieks I have had, up there with the best of the Belgians. great rose colored liquid, rather clear for the style, with a pink quartz colored head, thick as whipped cream and rising up like this thing has been ready to burst through the cork and cage for an eternity. so happy to be free, it emits aromas of tart cherries, baking pies, and of course funky oaky lactic lambic that's well blended and especially sour. the cherries sweeten it up only slightly in the taste, and the vinegar smelling salt intensity of the nose is better integrated in the flavor. cherries are enormous, not a faint accent but a dominant flavor, I could have predicted that from the jammy red color. head never settles, and the carbonation on it is effervescent and super bright. tart and sour both from the fruit, sour from the lambic and downright woody from its time in oak. mature as they come, dynamic and never getting too sweet. a lightness hangs in this one, making a small bottle not quite enough for me, its interesting enough that I will likely buy another one because I don't feel done with it. top notch stuff, super fairly priced, and as good as any kriek out there. trust me."

"O: At first it was too cold and the cherries were very hidden, but as it warmed a good amount of the fruit sweetness came through. The fruit is obviously from actual fruit and really works well with the base beer. Solid, authentic kriek."
""
""
""
"Overall: A fine Ale here. So far this is my favorite Kriek Lambic to date. The flavors are balanced yet scream on your palate. Very raw yet sophisticated. A nice dose of complexity yet not exhausting. All in all, this brew is Recommended."

"A decent enough denuded fruit lambic, a la Cantillon and their lot, wherein the guest fruit is only represented in its most basic form - one best appreciated by yer average high school chemistry student, I would proffer. Given that I aced that class (20 or so years ago), I suppose that I have just the right credentials to proclaim this a success, inasmuch as I have any clue what they're actually trying to achieve. Overall, this is something that I could not really justify outside of this particular Belgian ale context, I'm afraid to say too loudly."
"Palate medium, creamy, lively carbonation"

"Gorgeous appearance, as is typical of Belgian kriek lambics. Dark ruby body with a thick, creamy lavender cap. The aroma is musty funk and cherry. The flavor is a showcase for the cherries, with additional notes of earth, nuts, cherry pit, hay, wet basement. This is a particularly good bottle of this beer. A fairly common bottle as far as lambics are concerned. I should keep this in stock. Recommended."

"overall: I don't have a lot of experience with these sours but damn i think i'm gonna soon. Great stuff."
""
"The aroma is potently phenolic at first, but it improves substantially as it warms up. And the taste is consistently good. This isn't the most complex Kriek, but it's definitely interesting, and worth a try."
"A nice but unexciting ""sour."" Cherry is prevalent, but so are Band-Aids."
""
""
"O - Surprised at the depth of flavours this beer offers. For comparison, I greatly preferred this to the (much) more highly rated Fou'Foune I had early this week. Dials up the wood and fruit and dials down the lambic funk. May have to grab a bottle with which to test the best before date. Underrated."
""
""
""
"O: Really good for the money. Clean and crisp kriek; minimally sour with good balance."

"This isn't the Kriek for you if you need them sugary and sweet. It is, however, very well-crafted, focusing on cherries more than any overly sour, sweet, or wild aspects. If you're looking for something a little more organic and less sugary, you should give this a try."
""
""
"This is Kriek the way it should be! Unlike most Krieks which are brewed for American tastes, this beer is not at all sweet. A wonderful, funky, barnyard smell gives way to an amazing tart and dry sip. The true nature of this beer comes out at warmer temperatures- drinking it too cold is a waste. The spontaneous fermentation by lactobacillus means this is a truly one of a kind brew which is unique to it's location. Think terrior for beer! While admittedly a ""different"" experience, every person I have seen take a properly poured sip has been amazed. This beer is worth seeking out!"
"And, I had such high hopes for this one..."
"Overall: I really liked this Kriek, very wine like and carries a not overly harsh sourness. Would buy it again. Paid $16"

"Overall: a solid true belgian kriek. great true cherry flavor and good complexity. pretty easy drinking for a lambic. the funkiness is fairly relaxed but still shows itself."
""
""
""
"O-Probably won't be having this one again, but it was worth the experience. I remember not liking Dieu Du Ciel's Solstice d'été aux cerises when I had it over the summer, but I would prefer it to this one and would certainly try it again."

"Overall, a good kriek. Not the best, but very enjoyable."
""
"O: A very dry, clean kriek, not too sour. Pretty nice."
"A very nice kriek, if not quite at the top of the class. This kriek is a bit softer in mouthfeel and less intense than the best of the true (unsugared) krieks- not as intensely sour, as deeply flavored, and mostly lacking any funky notes. It does have a nice acidity, especially in the finish, pure sour cherry flavors, and a long moderately refreshing finish just touched by some wood notes that help round things out. Very pleasurable in any case, and probably the best that can be found over here on any sort of regular basis these days- though even that's a spotty proposition."
"Mouthfeel & Overall: The mouth feel is actually rather soft, yest with a crisp, dry finish. It's a really enjoyable sour right out of the bottle, but I really suggest aging this in a cool dark place for as long as possible. It becomes less acidic and a little more complex. The date on the bottle says ""best before 2024."" As if anyone can wait nearly that long."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm going 3.5 as the flavors I don't care for aren't out of the parameters of the style, but I don't think I would buy this one again."
""
""
""
"Not what I was expecting, and interesting kriek. Not getting much woody character here, just odd flavors. Bad bottle?"
""
""
"i am not a fan but I don't really like the style either. No specific knock on it but tastes more like cherry champagne than a lambic/gueze, at least what's going on with my tastebuds."
"O: Good, tart, and refreshing. I'm always happy to enjoy this beer."
""
"O – A good balance of cherry and tartness. Nice from start to finish."

"I honestly believe that beer would have an entirely differently reputation if brands like Oud Beersel Oude Kriek were more readily available. Seriously, try it - bring a bottle to your next party. For better or for worse, you'll be the most popular person there; the few people who don't love it will at least be impressed (and realize there's more to beer than bland, fizzy lagers)."

"This is the quintessential Kriek. Having been a Kriek drinker for years that is really saying something. No it's not hyped like other beers, but it definitely deserves the highest praise. The problems with most other krieks ranges anywhere from a bold bitterness which results from the cherry pits to cloyingly sweet. The aging in the oak really rounded out and mellowed that flavor and this beer is fully attenuated so there is virtually no residual sweetness. The body is almost like velvet but still thin enough to make this beer insanely drinkable. Such a dark rich red color, its almost like a fine rose champagne, with the bubbles to match. The smell of vanilla oak and cherries hit. You drink in and are intoxicated with fresh juicy cherry essence. There is absolutely no trace of hotness in this beverage, you would think its alcohol free! the aftertaste is pleasant and sings of cherries. Perfection! I will be keeping this on stock as often as possible! Such a fine beverage."

"Overall, this is a great fruit lambic. A spectrum of tastes, sweet, tart, oakey, it is all here and plays in a wonderful spectrum of flavors. Would highly recommend."
""
""
"Overall: One of the best, easily obtainable krieks around. The sourness and funk are more subdued, which allows the cherries to really shine through. At the same time it's stays away from being too sweet and artificial as some krieks tend to be. I'd definitely recommend trying this."
""
"Overall, this is a very drinkable oude kriek. It is not very complex, funky, nor highly tart. But it is a pleasant kriek that really tastes of fresh cherries and respects tradition; it is delightfully not the cherry syrup or worse versions that are out there."
"Tastes like carbonated berry juice. Not really my thing, but I'd be able to appreciate it more if it wasn't insanely bubbly, to the point where I had trouble swallowing it. Took about 5 sips and couldn't do more. Maybe I'll try other beers of this style, but this one really isn't for me."
"This was my favorite find this trip."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I was in the mood for nice fruity lambic and this is a niceone."
""
""
"D: Highly refreshing and drinkable with good complexity especially for style. The color alone makes it a perfect Valentine's Day beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall this is a fantastic Kriek and am glad I held on to a few of these to taste over the years. When fresh these just taste like cherry soda but give them a few years and DAMN it really comes alive!!!"
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyed. Much dark cherry flavor than I recall having in some other Krieks I have had. Great blend as well. Somewhere between tart and sour. Has that lovely sour quality but a smoothe body that balances that out."
"Serving type: bottle"
"A-"

"O) Outstanding - one of the standards for Belgian Kriek."

""
"Drinkability : a nice beer in the Belgian style Traditional Lambic. To drink at cellar temperature."
""
""
""
"Totally great beer with a wonderful fruity flavor and a highly drinkable character. From the 37.5 ml corked bottle purchased at Beer And Gin House in Gent."
"O: Absolutely drinkable. Excellent quality Belgian Kriek which can be easily compared with a Cantillon or a Drie Fonteinen"
""
""
""
""
"O: Impressed with this kriek, the fruit and tart blend nicely making it enjoyable to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O-I was surprised by the powerful sour flavor of this one. The flavors were good and complex, so I cannot complain that it was a one-note wonder, but I prefer a touch more balance in this style of brew."
""
""
"Excellent looking beer! Very balanced levels of sweet and sour. Funk levels are musky and dusty. Good sharp sourness with loads of fruit and a dry finish. I'd love to have a couple of cases of this."
""
"Overall, an enjoyable and balanced lambic. Not sweet, not overly tart, not overly funky, and the flavors are well constructed. It's still not my favorite style of beer, but I'd have this one again."
""
"O: While I personally found this beer to be very enjoyable and easy to drink, I could see this beer being tough for folks that are not huge fans of the more funky fruit lambics (it is not sweet like some of the others in the style). I don't think of this as a sessionable beer but I would say that is mostly true for the style."
"Overall. This beer is 5 years old and the cherry smell and taste is still absolutely amazing. Would love to try an older one!!"
""
""
""

""
""
"I should mention that some of the Oud Beersel krieks and gueuzes we tried in the SF Bay Area seemed to have an unpleasant metallic flavor to them in most of 2011, and were then back to normal. It was especially noticeable in the gueuzes. So, I think that they may suffer from some inconsistency issues / poor quality control, or else the importers handled the bottles badly... We first thought it was limited to bottles from Lunardi's, but then realized that the taste was present, regardless of the local source. That said, as of 2012, they seem just fine... There may still some very slight metallic flavor, but nothing unusual."
""
""
"D - I could drink this one all night. Does it come in a keg?"
""
"Overall: this is quite a good beer, but for me, I like a little bit more cherry character in my krieks. Would I go after this beer again? Probably not, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down."
""
""
""
""
"Really, it's a good beer, but it's a beer that detracts from its progenitor. I almost wish I had tried this first (being as it is, a very good kriek). But having had the Gueuze, I can't help but compare it to that, and the addition really does it no favours."
""
"O- I enjoyed this lambic. I am very interested in this style of beer and I have to say this one was very delicious. I plan on trying it again."
""
"o: a very refreshing and drinkable lambic."
""
"To my tastes could be a little drier but overall a nice beer."
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good lambic and quite an enjoyable drink. I would pick this up again."
""
"O- A pretty excellent kriek, anyone who likes really tart lambics will enjoy this one."
""
""
""
""
"Probably the most balanced and least funk forward lambic I've ever experienced. Wonderful.treat on my vacation to compliment my meal."
""
"Totally fine, and pretty tasty. I can't really dock the fruit for being too vibrant, but a slightly deeper level of complexity and sourness would certainly help."
""
""
"O: Excellent lambic that is up there with Cantillon in my opinion."
""
""
""
"O-great kriek... Would definitely get again"
"O: Good. No expectations going in, and none coming out. Good for what it is, and well worth trying. Just don't expect super sour on this one. It's more acidic."
""
""
"M-bubbly and smooth. tart feels great in the back of the mouth."
"Pale red with a pretty pink head of bubbles of that fades quickly. Nice balance of acidity and tartness. The cherry seems to soften the sourness and mute some of the funkier lambic characteristics. Hay and lemon peel seem to be the most prominent flavors emerging from the sourness. Perfect dryness and spot-on carbonation. A well done, if not understated Kriek."
""
""
""
"D/O - very good lambic. Would have liked a little more fruit, but leaps and bounds better than the ones that are syrupy - this is not."
""
""
"On the upper end of light bodied with a brisk level of carbonation, the mouthfeel is quite lively and the beer is, like I said, a joy to drink. A very well executed beer for the style."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’m finding this one quite sippable as each follows the last slowly but surely and as I focus on sorting out the components of the aroma and flavor here. This is nicely complex but also relatively subtle and something I’ll be more than happy to have again. My overall impression is that this is a first rate kriek. The cherries add a wonderful dimension of flavor to the lambic and this is a complex and subtle beer."
""
"I’d enjoy this bottle again and recommend it to those interested in sour beers, particularly newcomers to the style."

"Light body, with lots of carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Not a great deal of fruit flavors going on here, mainly oak and earthy notes. Still pretty good."
"O - A kriek without much kriek,could have had more cherries for me."
"O - I am not going to knock this one very much for its explosive carbonation because the taste was pretty good. I will have to grab another bottle of this in the future to give it another try."
"Pours a vibrant pinkish red with a big pinkish white froth. Aroma of wild funky yeast and cherry. In the flavor, big time sour notes with a mild complimentary tart cherry note. Mostly acidic, sour, and funky. The abv is hidden well by the strong puckering wild yeast notes and cherry. Light bodied feel, effervescent, semi dry sophisticated feel. Overall, this is a lovely Kriek lambic, very unique and full of character."
"Color with hints of red blood pure. Nose powerfully tannic cherry skins which give bitterness and with wreaths of red wine very pleasant. The mouth gives the sensation of biting into juicy cherries - the flavor of the fruit feels more than in other Kriek - but without any sweetness that does not come to disturb or saturated tasting. We also note the presence of bitterness due to the nuclei of cherry that gives a taste of almonds, but it really does not persist in the palace. A place we find ourselves with a touch of red fruit jam style and I must say that this is successful, even very well in this beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being high. Overall it was a delicious beer. The cherries were very nice in it. It wasn't the sourest of the style, but it was very flavorful and drinkable and felt nicely balanced in relation to the style. Very enjoyable beer overall."
"Overall - An excellent kriek which has mellowed nicely in the 6 years since i bought it... one of my favourites of this style..."
"O: very good Oude Kriek, but a little less complex than the Cantillon Oude Kriek Bio I tried last week."
"Beer pours a hazy deep cherry red (shocking I know) with a frothy pinkish head. The foam on this beer is dense and tightly packed and sticks around for a while. Best before date says 10/03/2030. Wow. Some musty (in a good way) earthy and barnyard aromas along with that ever present cherry. Sharp tartness upfront that hits your tongue in a wave and the acidity moves to the side of your tongue and to the back of your palate. Next comes the cherry flavor to give you a bit of a break from that acidity. A little maltiness to remind you that you are in fact drinking a beer. Followed by a long dry finish that leaves the palate cleansed and ready for another sip. This is one of my favorite Lambics and a great example of its particular style. I only wish I could afford to drink it more often."
"O - While it's good, it's hard to get past how disappointing the beer is after the out-of-this-world aroma. Well-balanced and flavorful anyway."
"O: A very nice kriek. The nose was super tart and funky yet the flavor was mainly tart. Not bad but not my favorite kriek by a long shot."
"This is quite a complex brew, one of the better krieks I have had. It is medium to light bodied with a lively amount of fizzy carbonation but not excessively done. The alcohol is very well hidden, it takes more than a glass and a warming up to room temperature before I even start to pick up on the alcohol's contribution of warmth down the back of the throat. Overall a very earthy brew that was a pleasure to drink. This brew finishes quite crisp and dry leaving you wanting more. My only gripe about this brew is how much the oak comes through in the aftertaste, it is a little over the top even for someone who loves oak inclusion in a brew."
"A superb Kriek. Not overly sour or sweet, and nicely carbonated. I'd certainly pick this one up again."
"Pours a dark non see through cherry hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is fresh tobacco,cherries,horse blanket and hay,the mouthfeel is full bodied and has tastes of sour cherries,sour funk,a touch of nuts and finishes with a mouthpuckering sherbet sourness that is bone dry and overall ive been pleasantly suprised by this brew as i have to admit im not the biggest fans of Krieks im more of a Framboise bloke but this one is in a class of its own as the cherry is there but it doesnt overpower and is just another ingredient to this brew and i would drink this again anyday of the week cheers."
"Pours a nice ruby color with a nice creamy head. Smells of sour citrus with some nice sweet, cherries. Taste is similar-starts with lemony citrus sourness that has a bit of barnyard funk intermixed with it; finishes with an oak cherry and more of the sour profile from earlier on the palate. Mouth is nice and full with carbonation burn on the back end. Pretty solid Kriek, I never heard of it and ordered...pleasantly surprised by this and wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
"Would buy next time I come across it in the bottle. $10 a 375 seems worth it."
"overall, i am impressed. this is delicious. lower price than most krieks making this a great deal."
"Overall - A pretty good lambic beer. While framboise is more of my preferred flavor for lambics, kriek is also pretty good as well. I enjoy the fact that this beer was not overally tart and sweet like Lindemans Framboise is, but it tended toward the more not sweet at all side, which I didn't like."
"Overall a great example of the style, acidic nature made it hard to do much more than sip, but in no way is that a bad thing."
"D- Overall, a respectable sour. The carbonation and acidity work together to make this a refreshing beer that goes down easy. Huge cherry presence without the sweetness."
"Overall: Very enjoyable. I think there was a nice balance. A little on the expensive side for a 375ml but worth it."
"D-Pretty nice and refreshing take on the style, although I wish it was a little more tart/sour."
"D: This was an interesting beer, and I personally preferred it over most other krieks I've tried due to the nice balance of sweet and tart. However, the aftertaste was not pleasant, and the body was too bubbly, so it wasn't very easy to drink. I wish the oak was more present, and a bit of funk would add to the complexity nicely. I'm guessing this one really needs some age to shine. Nearly fresh, this was good but definitely not great."
"This beer pours a very deep and murky rosewood red in color with a two finger bright pink poofy head. The aromas are of apple skins, house yeast and funk, and tart cherries. I'm glad it's not just cherries and then onto the flavor. The complexity is appreciated. The flavor consists of sweet and slightly tart cherries, light yeast, and red apple skins. It's definitely not as tart as it could be but it's a fine drink. It drinks very well and has good flavor. I do enjoy the complexities that show themselves throughout but it could've been a little more bold as far as the tart cherry flavor is concerned. Overall, it's a very good Kriek and worth trying."
"Taste is nice rustic/funky yeastiness then cherry and woody leafiness, citric, lightly tart, lightly sweet, hint of sour, and overall slightly on the tart and dryish side but not too tart or dry, and very flavourful. It has excellent lambic character in addition to a firm but gentle cherry/fruity quality and is overall an excellent, complex kriek lambic."
"Overall, this may not be my favorite beer, but its in the top 3. Its a perfect lambic and I will be buying the store out."
"D: A superbly focused and drinkable Lambic."
"Overall, I think a very well done kriek, enough residual cherry flavor and a complexity with the aged beer."
"Pours a semi-opaque deep ruby red color with a huge 3 inch foamy light red head that lasts. Lacing after each sip slips back down into the beer after a few seconds. Smells of sour dark cherries, red wine vinegar, and funk/must. My mouth waters with each sniff in anticipation of the sourness. Taste is of delicious sour cherries, vinegar, and a musty funkiness. There is a bitter tartness on the palate after each sip that is puckering. Very carbonated beer that is prickly on the drink down. Almost soda like in that regard. Overall, a very good lambic that I am glad I got to try."
"This is a fine beer and should be sought out accordingly so... I'm tempted to downgrade my ratings just so that it doesn't become a rarity!"
"O: wonderful fruit lambic, very complex and could definitely win over some wine drinkers, definitely want to stock one away for a while and see how it tastes further down the road--great experience"
"An excellent Fruit Lambic. Without a doubt one of the best Lamnbics I have had. Lovers of Cantillon should grab this if they see it. Highly recommended."
"D: Very nice sour that drinks as one should. Crisp, sour, dry, and full of cherry funk. What's not to like?"
"D-this is well balanced and tasty, nothing supernatural but still enjoyable. the funk is subtle but present and the fruits are there but lighter with a faint acidity."
"(D)- A slightly milder lambic leaning more towards the lactic funk side of things, but still a great kriek that is easier on the palate and a good starting point for someone just getting into the style. Affordable too, I can see this being a go-to kriek when the mood hits."
"D: I came in to this beer worrying that it would be yet another pateurized and sweetened ""lambic."" What I received, however, is nothing short of lambic genius. Such complexity and depth of flavor are rarely found in this country's lambics, and it is nice to see something this tasty available in my area, which is currently Tallahassee. Sadly, this brewery has shut down as of 2003 according to Wild Brews. It is such a shame, and I can only hope that enough was brewed to last up to the 2030 expiration date."
"Drinkability is pretty good overall; a lot to enjoy - but at the same time no way I'd countenance more than one in a session."
"Yeah, hit and miss at the same time. Interesting and pleasant enough but also doesn't leave you feeling great."
"Bottle dated best before 10-4-2029. Opens with a very forceful pop of the cork. Pours a deep ruby red color with a large pink head that fades to a lasting ring of pink foam. Deep, vinous aroma with lots of vinegar sourness, mild funk, and a moderately soft dark cherry note. The flavor is dry, grainy and funky upfront with a lasting, tart, dark cherry and spice finish. The body light and effervescent like a nice champagne."
"This beer was excellent. I have just been getting into sour beers and someone at my local brewery suggested this and i thought it was great! It poured very red.. like a raspberry color almost mixed with cola. Upfront you get sour cheery as usual and finishes surprisingly dry. It was a mixture of tart and sweet. before i had this i had a la folie and felt the folie was a bit better of a sour.... i felt this was a little fruity and not enough tart for my preference. I would however definitely buy another one... on occasion as it was 10 bucks for a 12oz. poured very nice with a 2in foam... carbonation was definitely on the heavy side... the cork went sailing across the room. It was very very drinkable.. it was gone in a bout 10 minutes... i tried savoring it but the flavor was too delicious. Overall i think this was a great krieke, i don't think it would ever disappoint anyone... i would have like more of an oaky/vanilla finish.. but it remained fruity throughout in my opinion..."
"Slow drinker, definitely one to sip and savor. A good example of a traditional Kriek."
"The cork on this could have flown, but I controlled it. Pours red with slight pink tint with a very light lavenderish pink head that is dense with tight carbonation. Light cherry fruity aroma meets the nose supported by some wet oak, basement, and Brett scents. Light vinous notes too. Fantastic smooth flavor that bounces between fruity and tart. I would not say this beer is a lip puckering sour, but it is tart. Tart cherry, wet hay, vaguely sweet. Pie crust is a go. Nice mouthfeel, I love the pricklyness of a lambic. This is a real quafable kriek."
"This was my first, and possibly last lambic, at least in the near future. I just didn't like this beer, however those who like lambics my really enjoy it."
"Overall: A complex and delicious Kriek."
"Pours an extremely murky reddish-pink color with a big pink head that hangs around for a bit. Funkiness reaches the nostrils as soon as the cork is popped. Scent is vinegar, sour cherries, and sweet cherries as well. Taste is DELICIOUS! The sour cherry taste is spot on in almost every possible way. The balance of sweetness and sour is awesome. The tartness comes first, followed by the sweetness. I also get great wooden flavors and acidic fruit juice. This beer is delicious. All the Cantillon heads must have reviewed this beer, because they made it seem like it wasn't sour at all. Although this lambic finishes with a sweet cherry flavor, it definitely has a sour taste. Which I LOVE! I'm so glad my local Whole Foods got this beer! Mouthfeel is dry and crisp like a champagne that has tartness lingering. Drinkability is very high."
"O: A very complex well balanced beer. Most importantly for this style, it is dry yet has a tart sweetness for balance. A great beer overall."
"The taste falls back to mostly cherry with some lactic character. Some mild oak and funk with a slight pucker factor. Light body and medium carbonation. This is a bit dry with a slightly-sour finish. I keep coming back for more; this is quite drinkable and one of the better krieks I've had."
"D: It's not difficult to drink this beer because the sour aromas and flavors are not overpowering."
"Hell yes. Excellent mix of old and new lambic with huge tartness and little of the sugars remaining. This is fantastic and a damn good price. Can't recommend this highly enough."
"Overall I have to give Oude Kriek Vielle a nomelettes."
"The mouthfeel was thinner than expected but it had plenty of zippy carbonation."
"D: Solid tasty fruit lambic. The true lambic fermentation and use of real fruit restrains the beer into going over the top with sugar. Bit of an unstable balance IMO, but it's there. Would make a good food pairing beer for sure."
"Drinkability: Though it is tart and fruity and undeniably dry, the flavor profile lacks funky complexity in the middle; still, a very nice beer"
"The palate opens plenty sour with a blend of lactic (dominant) and lemony (secondary) sourness upon which a brilliant, ripe cherry character is present, very bright and fruity. Rich and deep, there's some leather, some earth (petrichor?) and a little bit of dust, all beautifully balanced. Drying and tart on the finish, there's some leather, cherry skins, and of course, a copious amount of cherry flavor. Acidity is moderate, with no acetic character present, just mostly lactic with some citric. Mildly tannic, this beer is medium-light in body with medium-low carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, one I'm disappointed I've passed on in the past. A very well structured beer."
"Bottle. Deep crimson red with a pink head that slowly collars around the glass. Aroma is funky over ripe cherry, woody, and earthy. The taste is fruity and tart that ends crisply. No evidence of the alcohol. Very light mouthfeel and very carbonated. Very drinkable. I really enjoyed this one and am glad I can get it regularly if I wanted. A little pricey though."
"Really, really good lambic that I've enjoyed many times over the past several years. It's great to be able to pick this one up so readily in many parts of the country."
"A solid unsweetened Kriek with plenty of flavour and good balance."
"Drinkability: A very interesting and complex kriek that is not overly sweet or overly sour. Funky and sour with a dry finish. Nice beer."
"Overall this was a nicely done kriek - the funk was at a good level and the cherry flavors were a nice mix of tart and sweet."
"D - As with all lambics/sours, this one is a slow sipper. Not something you can chug by any means."
"The body is medium and carbonation is high but not too prickly. Overall this is a great beer. Not really in the top tier of fruit lambics but still a very worthwhile purchase."
"Cherry flavors grows as I drink more and as it warms. Much better. Adjusting my review."
"Gotta have something sweet to balance this one out.."
"Perhaps I should have tried a kriek lambic that used fruit flavoring or concentrates first, so that I could fully appreciate the pain-staking methods used to create this ""pink sparkling wine of the ale world""."
"Overall, a decent kriek. I would really like to try this with a few years on it. Would be very drinkable if it wasn't so carbonated and fizzy. Glad to have tried this one!"
"Overall glad to try it and damn right on for the style. Would do it again."
"delicious!"
"M&D- Light, prickly carbo lightens the body. Very drinkable (if you crave tart beers and like a dry finish!)"
"Very pleased with this lambic, an incredible aroma started things off right and the taste did not deviate from there. Surprisingly complex and overall just a great beer..."
"D: Quite tasty, not as profoundly sour as some krieks like the cantillon lou pepe. A quality kriek that is worthy of praise."
"2006 bottling with a best by date of 4/4/2026. The beer pours a reddish-brown color with a large white head. The aroma is very tart with notes of cherries, oak and vanilla. This is what a fruit lambic is supposed to smell like. The flavor is heavy on the tart cherries with some oak notes. The oak character is pretty strong. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel. The four years of age on this beer really made it shine and turned it into something special."
"Drinkability - I've taken the better half of a 750ml bottle from my significant other already, and could easily see myself drinking a liter or more during these warm, summer days. What a beer!"
"It is a great fruit beer."
"D - It leaves the glass far too quickly. Too delicious."
"D: Certainly one of the more interesting Krieks I've had, though I prefer beers of this style to be a little sweeter. Still, I'm glad I tried it, even if I'm not a huge fan of the wild funk."
"Good stuff."
"Bottle, home. Delicious kriek. This beer pours a bright shade of crimson with an enormous, bubbly pink head. It's obviously very carbonated as tiny bubbles race up the glass, champagne-like. The aroma is a fantastic mix of bright cherries and softly sour funk. It's really good cherry pie as a lambic. There's a little bit of vinegar in the flavor and somewhat more sour funk. It's a dry beer but the cherries nearly seem sweet. The mouthfeel is bubbly but soft and very clean. Excellent."
"T: Highly drinkable, a little tart, but refreshing."
"Pours a cloudy red with nice, large pink head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is cherry, raspberry, leathery funk, with a buttery element. Flavor is vinous, with a hint of fruity sweetness evoking sour and/or black cherry, and nice funk aromas on the dry finish."
"I may go back and try a fresher batch. I think this is a sour that is good for people that are trying to get into the style because it's not too sour. Unfortunately I'm beyond that."
"A nice drink."
"Drinkability: This is a nice and dry lambic that is highly drinkable. Another in a line of good intro sours. I will look for this again."
"D: A very drinkable kriek but I can't see wanting more than one or two of these in a sitting. The combined effects of the funk and tartness would eventually dull one's taste to the point where nuances would be missed."
"You smell sour cherries, and you taste sour cherries, but this was what you expected, and exactly what the beer delivers. Pleasant carbonation, quite a dry finish, totally different from most of the ""commercial"" kriek beers. I am so glad the people at d'Afspraak in Mechelen recommended this one, or I might never have tried another kriek."
"Overall, not what I was expecting from a lambic. If you like flanders, this may peak your interest, but even then it wasn't that great."
"Not bad, but not great. Oak is a little top heavy and I fell like a lot of the flavors clash as opposed to integrating."
"M&D - fizzy, with a champagne like body and carbonation, dry finish, a nice kriek, not too sweet, not too sour, man those Belgians know what there doing"
"D - The low ABV makes this surprisingly easy drinking, even if it probably should have been consumed 10 years ago. It was really interesting to see what happens to a kriek as it reaches its best-before date, and it's still eminently drinkable, albeit different. The carbonation is a little too much for my liking, but otherwise it goes down easy."
"The mouthfeel is rather carbonated and complex. The brew is an excellent apéritif, although not very suitable, in my opinion, for other purposes due to the dry nature."
"Very drinkable because it is neither too sweet nor too tart. Easy drinking, although its depth makes one want to savor it a bit."
"D: A wonderful beer, tons of flavor and just a great choice for my 100th review."
"D - One of the most enjoyable beers I've had in a while. Wonderfully quaffable and drinkable. If you're at all a fan of gueuze and/or sours, you'll love this. I only wish that I had the patience to wait until 2027 to see how this beer develops over time!"
"I have not had much experience with this style, but this is definitely a wonderful example of a Kriek, although not in a traditional sense. Will definitely revisit this one again!"
"When reviewing beer on this site I think an error factor of 0.1-0.2, while high, may be reasonable for those offerings with wild cultures. This one caught me on a good day. The funk doesn't overpower the cherries and the light grains (first time mentioned...I know) really provide that hay-ish bed for nesting of the yeast and ripe cherries. I do like the almost ""solera"" blending of young and old - having read and thinking of it depth is certainly enhanced. There is a slight heft to this depth so it's something that I sip and I savor, but this is an extremely enjoyable and contemplative effort."
"375ml bottle with BBD of 6.12.2024, making this a 4.5 y.o. bottle, I think. Pours an opaque dark red with a large, fizzy light pink head that lasts. Looks like a glass of blood with some sediment mixed in. The smell is largely barnyard, must, and tart cherry. Definite lacto character. Sour cherry taste, but the tartness is rather restrained compared to offerings from some other traditional producers. A certain ""funk"" and woody earthiness to it. Overall quite dry, as it should be. Medium body with heavy carbonation. Nice, traditional kriek that makes for an easy drinker (as far as lambics go)."
"M&D: granted, I'm not a fruit-lambic drinker (i.e. big fan), but this one really ticks all the boxes for me as a reasonably complex yet immensely, pleasantly drinkable example. The fine and soft carbonation supports a medium body that in turn shows the moderately tart fruitiness treading light on a mature and rounded lambic platform - maybe the secret lies in the ""old"" lambic base? As pointed out by many previous reviewers, I also share the opinion that, although this is not the most ""distinctive"" Kriek beer, it's nonetheless a harmonious and superbly-crafted one. I truly like it."
"Bottle at The Alibi Room in Vancouver. Dark murky brown in color, topped with a finger of head that doesn't linger too long. The aroma is massively funky, sweaty and mineral with a hint of tart cherry and red wine vinegar. On the tongue, the fruit flavor is much more pronounced and complex, largely sour but with a very subtle hint of sweetness. Acidity is moderate to high, making for a slow sipper, but a highly enjoyable one. A touch of grain and esters appear in the dry finish, but the cherry flavor dominates here. An exemplary kriek, I'll be seeking this one out again."
"drink it at 55 degrees. the warmer the better. would highly recommend this one to anyone as a traditional kriek. not to abrasive. an easy to go."
"Eric"
"The drinkability of this beer is amazing for the style. The vinegar/tartness is perfect. great example of the style. High recommendation."
"An interesting experience. Not one to drink steadily, but a nice sipper."
"I will be getting this one again and again. One of the best lambics I've had."
"d - very drinkable. I would recommend this to everyone who has not tried a really good Lambic - this one will help you discover this style and I loved it."
"overall - I'm doing this one mostly from memory of last night; was in a hotel room and unable to procure internet access to write a review. But what I remember was good. It was a nice, bracingly tart cherry lambic to start off what would be an awesome night of food and beer."
"3.9/5"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability remains in the average category because that is how drinkable I think this beer is, it does not wow me into wanting to guzzle the whole thing down with me trying to restrain myself from doing so the whole time, the beer just seems to fit the bill of a whole host of other lambics in terms of drinkability. Still remains a tasty and complex beer though."
"I didn't like this beer. My palate's not sophisticated enough for this one. It tasted like sparkling, cherry-flavored cough medicine to me. The sour aftertaste made me think twice about taking another sip. I prefer sweeter lambic. I wanted to like it, but I never finished the bottle."
"I like it a lot - if anything it is lacking a little in complexity and feels thin. Having said that I will drink this again. As always with these beers - many thanks to those getting these in the country!"
"Pours a dark ruby red with huge foamy pink head. Very sweet Aroma of dark cherries with lots of sourness and a slight hint of roasted nut. Very tart/sour lambic taste with a sweet dark cherry balance. Very acicidic with a touch of oak in the aftertaste."
"This beer met my expectations."
"Drinkability would be through the roof except for you can't get this stuff anywhere around my town!Q"
"ow, very tart and corky, musty and acidic but not mouth drying... lots of cherry and sour cherry skin aroma .. is very refreshing, does have a strange not so fresh aftertaste ... good pink foam(looks like an cherry icee head), some minor lacing ..dark ruby colour .. lots of funk, metal,woodiness, cherry, sour notes in the flavour depo ... a nice fruit lambic but to tart and funked (authentic) for me to truly rave about, but i can appreciate this for its quality ... best before date: 12.04.2026...turns wedding bells into wedding bills, ha ha ha..???"
"This beer pours a cloudy deep red color with a small pink head. It immediately smells of barnyard funk - must, mildew, old wood. There is also a nice cherry sweetness in the aroma. The flavor is nice, tart, and sour. It's funky. It tastes like licking an old wood barrel that had been sitting around for a while. The cherry flavor is there to balance some of that out, but this is a great sour beer. The beer is not too heavy and goes down quite easy, despite the sourness. I really enjoyed this one."
"Terrific stuff. It's a masculine way to do a fruity beer, and a way to get that sour beer kick filled."
"Notes: I may consider re reviewing this beer at a later date when I develop my taste for this style."
"Dark pink with a fluffy pink head. It smells good, sour, cherries, and a little bit of manure! The taste was not too heavy on the cherry, some sourness, a little bit of acidity this was cool. I'll be interested to try their framboise and gueuze. Mmm gueuze."
"Very much looking like Raspberry juice and Iced Tea mixed together with a pink head. The nose is pure lambic with some fruit rising up. This is a bracing beer with a dark fruit flavour matching up against the sour lambic body. The finish is quite dry with a fairly quick drop off. Not on the Cantillon level but very nice and unsweetened."
"Deep raspberry color with a pinkish head. The nose has fresh mountain cherries, funky oak and some tart sour aromas. The taste is also a nice blend between funk, tart fruits and sweet cherries. A delicious brew complimented by a crisp body. I could enjoy this masterpiece all night."
"Pours a dark burgundy in color. There's a pinkish/white head that forms. Plenty of carbonation on the pour. Smell is cherry and all kinds of funky, tart. Taste is more of the cherry and funk, but the cherries have more of a ""green"" taste. Good carbonation again in the mouthfeel. Very tart and funky lambic. I like it."
"This was a great example of a style I can't seem to have enough of, and would recomend this lambic to anyone interested in lambics."
"Edit: A bottle purchased about a year later (mid-2009) had very little acidity, very strange. Not bad, but not very good either, kind of like a boring version of Orval. Probably a fluke, I guess."
"The body is more on the dry side but some residual. Maybe a bit sweeter than typical krieks but the aftertaste accentuates the cherry finish. Also carbonation seems light for style but also helps the cherry. Overall very enjoyable. As my mouth got use to the sour, it became very easy to drink. A must have for kriek lovers."
"Brilliantly clear ruby red color and just crown of carbonation on top. Black cherries dominate the aroma with a general tartness and acidity, and hints of pineapple, hay, and a yeasty character. Cherry is less dominant in the taste allowing for more beer qualities to come through and also more tart, not as sweet as the nose hinted. Medium acidity with citrus tones, slight pucker, charcoal dryness, belgian yeast character, and slightly nutty, caramel maltiness. Sharp carbonation with an initial fizz eases up before in becomes too much. Thin mouthfeel is quite enjoyable here."
"Pours very clear but still a deep deep red color with good barely pink head. Nose is tart with cherry and wood. Taste follows. Very tart flavor up front, and good sour lambic pucker. The cherry flavors come out in the middle with the wood, and continue through the finish. a wonderfully sour beer. The mouthfeel is just about perfect, and the drinkability is good. Goes down easier as it warms. Would love to see how this ages. great lambic"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Active and well carbonated, it certainly provides a launching pad for the fruit to show its stuff. It smooths out over the duration, but it's good the whole time. This beer is easier to drink than most, due to its refreshment factor and milder tartness relative to the style."
"I figured I would try this one given the chance, but this was not enjoyable at all. I am not a huge fan of the style, but this was just overpowering in my book and tartness doesnt give much characther."
"I have wanted to try this beer for sometime, however I think it would be best with some more age, to let it gather some more complexities. The best before date was 21.10.2025. so I definitely think it was too young..."
"Picked up a small corked bottle at Bauer for $6.99. Removed the cork to hear a loud snapping pop. Poured into two tulip shaped glasses. The color was fire engine red. The smell invades the nose with a very pronounced sharpness. Taste wise, it was an awesome kriek lambic. So tart on the tongue first, but became delightful after the first few sips. The subtle cherry flavor showed up more as the beer warmed. Not for the faint of heart, this one is one of the more tart beers I've tried. Bits of dark sediment left in the bottom of the glasses at the end though. Due to all that funk, it was nice to have only a small bottle on hand. Lambics, to me, should only be enjoyed a small dose at a time. Glad I bought this one."
"Pours reddish with a pink hued head that rises high and falls for the most part quickly. Nose is very funked. Fairly thick antiseptic tone. Flavors got a nice level of the funky wih a mild amount of sour. Yes my friends. This is a lambic. Why have I stayed away from you for so long. Quite a smooth feel with a full carbonation. So drinkable. I would buy cases of this at a time. I would bathe in it, but that would be a stupid waste! Why dirty it? Just drink it!"
"D: Good kriek all around, but lacking a bit of length on the flavor. I would definitely drink this again though."
"Drinkability - no problems with this bottle. Not at all for the intro lambic drinker; definitely an excellent lambic. I could drink this early and often, but of course it isn't cheap."
"Great drinkability."
"Notes: A good exmple of a kriek. Much better than the more tame Lindemans version."
"Pours a deep amber/ reddish color with a pink head. Aromas of a sour, dark cherry.As in the taste, dry to a sour dark cherry flavor. A sour, bigger body in the mouthfeel, and a sour cherry aftertaste. A true lambic, great sour cherry flavor. Not sweet, all tartness."
"D - A tasty beer that would have been even better if the gueze and cherry flavors blended a little better. It is weird how sweet the aroma is but how tart the flavor is."
"Overall I don't think that I would buy this again. I have had Oud Beersel's Gueze Vielle and Kriek Vielle and this is not even in the same league. I can tell that this Kriek is for the sweet Kriek lovers. I like them sour."
"sooo sour. super tar with a touch of oxidation and cork. the kriek is reclusive, however. really very little sign of cherry, or any other fruit for that matter. i do detect some distinct oak character, however"
"D- This beer has great cherry presents and a nice tartness with some supporting flavors. It will be interesting to taste this at year 2025 to compare."
"Drinkability: This is a very special lambic, and it is devastatingly wonderful with some creamy goat cheese. A great summer beer, too - as refreshing and crisp as it is complex and robust."
"I suppose it's just a little thin in body, but overall very enjoyable with a nice crisp refreshing carbonation. Would I really want more body on something this sour anyway?!? Not something I want to drink several bottles of, and sometimes not at all, but on the right day I've found few brews more refreshing."
"Cheers!"
"Pours out a nice big head that falls into a nice thick head with a killer lacing. The head stays in a thick layer across the top of the beer, the color is pink too. The color of the beer is red/ruby red and very dark. The smell is fragrant with sour cherries and some horse blanket in the background. The taste is of sour cherries that are not tart. Nice sour flavor, it's not followed up by a lot of tart flavor. The kind that usually makes your mouth pucker isn't there. The mouthfeel is nice, nothing negative to report. Overall I would have this again, definitely."
"Drinkability: Not very good. Not dry enough for me and too medicinal."
"Meh, not impressed. A gorgeous pour and color; deep shiny red with a slight head. A small metallic taste with not a whole lot of flavor. A decent tartness at the finish left me wanting to drink more. I enjoyed the consistency of it as it wasn't watery and not too thick. Not much smell to it and basically I just wanted more from this drink."
"Bottle: Poured a deep pink color lambic with a nice foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of sour cherry, oak and tart is well balance. Taste is a well balance mix between some sour cherry, oak and tart with some well balance level of acidity and sweetness. This was a very refreshing beer after a long cross-country ski outing. Definitely one of the most well balance fruit lambic Ive tried."
"Poured out a raspberry red, dark, cloudy, crowned with a thick frothy pink head. The nose is sour, cherry, lemony, overly sour, feet wrapped in leather. the taste is sour sour sour, lemon, acidic, bit of cherry, more towards the finish. Totally turns on your mid tasting. The mouthfeel is prickly and highly carbonated. Finishes dry and clean, a bit of sourness on the tongue."
"Overall: Milder, but still has some nice lambic qualities."
"Very complex with scads of lambic flavor and very fresh fruit flavors. This stuff reminds me of Drie Fonteinen Scharsbeek Kriek. A must try."
"Drinkability: this is a slow sipper, and if the tart cherry tones were a bit mellower I would really like this. Interesting beer everyone should try as personal thoughts will vary."
"The aroma is heavy with tart, sour cherries, balsamic vinegar, yeasty funk and that mildly funky/chemicalish aroma I can only describe as stir fried chinese baby corn. The body is a dark pink leaning to red in darker light. The head a pink tinted white, a thumb thick and lasting. Tart funky fore is very acidic and tangy with balsamic vinegar notes. faintly oaky in the middle. Quite dry and crisp on the tongue. very long lingering sour flavor goes well into the aftertaste."
"The flavor was very tart, there were cherries, and maybe hints of grape? some spices, orange rind. It was very earthy/musty, and very very dry. It reminded me a little of a dark sparkling red wine. There was a sweet/ tartness to it but I would hesitate to call it sweet. Overall I enjoyed it."
"D: A bit on the pricey side, but well-worth it. Complex and refreshing. This is definitely one for the beer geeks and not the masses."
"Great mouthfull of dense and smooth carbonation, very drinkable, wonderfully refreshing."
"375 mL bottle ordered at Allen St. Hardware Cafe in Buffalo. Served in a tulip, this kriek is an opaquely hazy magenta with steady carbonation and a modest pink head. Sour funk and assertive brett aromas with a distinctly cherry character throughout. The taste is tart, indeed, but not nearly as mouth-puckering as offerings from Cantillon or De Ranke. Tannic sour cherry skin flavors ride along a dense and driving bretty funk train. Vinous and terribly refreshing, with an appropriate and satisfying dryness to the finish that provokes the next sip. Not quite phenomenal, but certainly a world-class fruit lambic. Recommended."
"cloudy, red like squeezed strawberries, small tan colored head. smells like alcohol, grapes and red fruit, a bit like the odor of a light red wine. Taste is a mild fruity, cherry tartness up front....changing to...nothing at all. After the tartness leaves its as if I drank a glass of water, or at least pretty close to that. My wife said the flavor was like non-alcoholic red wine and too tart. Fizzy and full bodied, like a soda without the sweetness. Easy enough to drink, but i can't say that i'd want to buy another."
"-UF"
"Drinkable: While I have a hard time drinking more than one or two fruit beers at a time, I imagine that lambic fans would find this totally session-friendly. A beer I'll definitely e keeping my eye out for from now on."
"drinks easily. sweet and sour cherries most prominent, with a lemony sourness. heavily and tightly carbonated for a fizzy, light feel. cherry component cuts through the barny tartness with a sweetness and a delicate cherry-skin tartness. drinkable, refreshing, and enjoyable."
"This beer can be wrapped up in one word: cherry. It smelled like cherry juice and tasted likewise.However, it wasn't visited by the Kool-Aid Man (oh yeah!); rather, the cherry lingers pretty gently- no over-sugared Red Dye # 5 concotion here. I was expecting sour when I first sipped it, but was surprised by a slight sweetness. The cherry overtakes the drink, but I'm not complaining. It even looks like cherry juice in the glass, with only a slight lace resting on top for a head after the first pour. As a fan of lambics, I enjoyed this brew and would go for another round."
" Poured into my Duvel tulip glass, the body is a slightly cloudy pink/purple hybrid, topped by a substantial inch or so of creamy pinkish head. Excellent carbonation keeps coming for quite a while. Aroma is a bit musty, with sour cherries and lambic yeast battling it out for supremacy, ultimately fiighting to a draw. Palate strikes a balance between the ultra-sour gueuze lambics and the syrup-sweetened fruit lambics. Sour cherries blend with a tarter, more vinegary base from the gueuze. A fairly sharp astringency seizes the tongue at first, but subsides a bit after a few more sips. Body is smooth, lightly creamy, and beautifully sparkling. Certainly a tasty beer, although it is too assertive and challenging to be a frequent selection."
"It's still going to be a long time before I really know what to look for in a lambic. However, this is rather drinkable."
"I think this beer would make a decent session beer. It is sweet, but not too overbearing. Also, it is not too high in alcohol. I am happy to have had the oportunity to try this one."
"Higher than expected alcohol."
"this bottle was stored upright for at least 2 years without apparent cork issues."
"A bold and delicate blend of what is good with Belgian beers. A hazy maroon - brown color with a light, yet vigorous carbonation. Smells very tart and fruity with a woodsy, musky, earthy tone. Tastes very fruity and vineous. Quite musky and earthy flavors woven around an abundance of raspberry. A light apple cider flavor persists. Carbonation and fruitiness adds to much creaminess, but the light souness thins the beer in the finish for easy drinking. A pleasure to drink. Much complexity in here."
"375 ml bottle. Oud Beersel Kriek has a hazy red color with a large pink head. Earthy aroma of cherries, oak, and vinegar. Much more of a subtle aroma that I remember from previous tastings. The flavor is mainly cherries. Notably dry. A minimum of lambic funkiness, but beware if you are not used to sour beers. This one if pretty sour. The cherry flavor is very nice. Not at all artificial tasting, unlike mainly fruit lambics. Finish is short and very dry. This is a very nice beer, but I list it among the elite of the style."
"Drinkability: Since it's dry and not to sweet or sugary, I could see someone maybe having more than one bottle. But would you have more than one bottle of champagne? Maybe you would, but I wouldn't. Also it's fairly expensive, and so certainly a good treat. Try it on New Years instead of going to the liquor store for champagne. Your guests may be both surprised and pleased."
"Drinkability - Definitly wouldnt drink more then 1 in a sitting, and dont know as i'd drink another whole bottle by myself, but if I was splitting with someone it would be just right. This would go well with some fine cheese, or some kind of appetizer to complement its sourness."
"Pours a brilliant ruby red with a rose-colored head that has very good retention and leaves behind some lacing. A high level of carbonation is visible after the initial pour. Aromas of cherries and alcohol seem to dominate. The taste is, well...different to say the least. I can best describe it as a subtle fruit-flavored champagne. This doesn't really have the consistency, taste, or feel of beer. The cherry flavor doesn't come out all that much. It's the tartness and dryness of this beer that doesn't suit me. The aftertaste is very dry (like champagne or even a chardonnay). I won't be having this beer again...in fact, I couldn't finish my pint."
"The best I've had of the style."
"Crazy sour vinegar nose, smells like a stale musty barnyard with a hint of sour cherries. Pours a deep burgundy/brick red hue and makes a fizzy pink head. Flavor is vinegary, hint of sour cherries, tastes very much like a sour red wine... very tart and astringent, hint of cranberry. Light on the palate, coats the mouth very thin and finishes quite dry. Nice quality lambic, moderately complex, enjoyed this one."
"I suppose I was expecting some fruited sweetness from the cherries to emerge  especially with all the color they contribute to the body. But this was effectively overruled by the full lambic sourness. I cant say as Id care to drink any great measure of this beer, but the puckering tartness has a frolicking refreshment to it."
"Why should I even describe this to you? She was wet and sour and she quenched my fire. She gave me sweet tender kisses inside raspberry tendrils covered in not quite ripe fruit. Her finger tips tasted of sandalwood, patchouli, and sex. If I could own this, all of it, every sexy bit of her, I would never share her. I'd laugh as she teased you; I'd laugh as I described my passion with her; I'd never share a taste with anybody. She's my Cleopatra."
"Best by sometime in 2022. This is my first real Kriek so I may be updating this review as I gain more experience in the style (and finish off the Cantillon and De Ranke in my fridge). Smell is a little oak and vinegar in the back dominated by an overpowering sourness. There is some mustiness that perks up at one point bringing to mind an old cobwebby barn. Very subtle though. Taste is shockingly sour! This is possibly the sourest thing ever. Very acidic. And yet behind it all, there is a little bit of bread, and of course the cherry flavor, though it is purely tart and not sweet at all as others have mentioned. The cherry comes out more as it warms, making this taste juicier, but I prefer it served very cold. The finish is extremely dry and never ending! It took me forever to finish this bottle, but I savored every last drop."
"Bottle best before 03 04 2023.... Poured a hazy, deep ruby red color with a small pink head that didn't leave any lacing on the glass. Funky, barnyard, oak, and tart cherry aroma. Tart cherry skin, sour lemon taste. Mouthfeel of soft lively bubbles."
"Purply garnet with a pinkish mountain of foam. Gem like quality on the edges, just gorgeous in the snifter. Smell is like an unblended lambic, with a tiny bit of cherry syrup coming through. Taste is tart, bubbly, cherries throughout, and a long cherry finish, yet not sweet at all, never overly aspirinish. Wet in the middle and then dry in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium, especially pleasant for this type of beer. So this is a real lambic without the heavy duty fruitiness that makes one think of malternatives. For being so tart, it is surprisingly drinkable. Worth nabbing if you can find it."
"This is one brew that really sticks out in my mind and haunts my memory."
"The beer pours a nice rosey color with a 2 finger slightly pink head that falls to a light coating over the brew. Very pretty. The nose is super, with a big sour acrid blast but I can actually smell the sour cherry playing around underneath that. Very enticing. The flavor is intense. Upon taking a sip, my cheeks pucker in and my salivar glands close off, giving me that stickey spit thing going on. The sour and acidic flavor intensifies as I swallow the beer, but fading as quickly as they assaulted my taste buds. It leaves a residual cherry flavor and gives nice sweet cherry burps. The feel is light moderate with a nice moderate carbonation. It leaves my mouth with the sticeky spit feel. This is a refreshing beer. Easy to drink and it tastes really good. I like this beer a lot. Very nice."
"This one pours a pink color with a moderate head that falls fast and leaves very little lacing on the glass. Looks kinda like a wine. The aroma is very nice - lots of Belgian funkiness and a nice sweetness from the cherries. The flavor isn't as sour as I expected, but still plenty sour. Slightly sweet with an intense cherry flavor. Slightly drying on the finish. Drinkability is very good. The mouthfeel is light to moderate, but right on for the style. Great brew."
"12.7 ounce bottle corked and bailed. Date on back of bottle was an unbelievable Best Before 11.12.2022. The cork near exploded from the bottle after the bail was removed and the beer allowed to warm a few minutes."
"best of its class, in my book. miles above de ranke."
"I need to adjust to this style. The huge champagne head and pink hue were beautiful, but it tasted like sour patch kids without the sweetness. Yes, I can see how one would enjoy this, but I'm not there yet. Beyond the overbearing sourness, there was an interesting funk. I really want to like it, maybe I can try some others and work up to it."
"Nice stuff. Oh, and the Best By Date was in 2023. Comical."
"Well this should be the one for today. Opening it up and pouring it in even boosted this feeling.... woww what a carbonation and what a great (bit) pink head and a clouwdy red colour. Smell is very aggresive there so to say. Giving you chery, sourness and everything you want to smell in a kriek. What a presance, to bad the taste is a litle less without offence. Sour, fruity and dry. Bitter in aftertaste for its kind but all in all one to try!"
"Overall: Very tart cherry lambic. I need to try more of this style, as my reference points are Lindemans and Rock Bottom."
"Reddish-pink in color with a light pink head. It does leave a bit of lacing. A nice steady stream of carbonation flows up from the middle. A very pretty beer. The aroma is very musty, with a wet cardboad smell. Hints of sour cherries are in the back. The flavor is tart up front with the musty, horse blanket characteristics next. Nice sour cherry flavor throughout. The drinkability is pretty high on this one. It leaves a bit of sourness through each sip. A very nice brew."
"Pretty drinkable. I take back what I said about that in the Hanssen's review. I can give a lambic decent scores in this catergory. This brew is quite quenching with its fairly mellow hardcore funk and sharp, crisp tartness and earthy characteristics."
"Pours a fairly clear ruby body with a frothy white head that is tinged pink. The aroma is sour and very cherry with a slight medicinal character and something slightly cheesy that I keep catching occassionally. The flavor is fairly sour and the cherries come through nicely, but theres not a whole lot backing it up except for a slightly metallic sourness. The palate is big-bubbled and soda-like."
"Dark pinkish-red with a off-white/pinkish head of foam which is massive. Nice small-bubbled carbonation streams up the glass quite rapidly as well. Aromas are of oak, brett, and sour cherries. This is a bit funky, but nowhere near a girardin black label, or cantillon kriek. Taste is good, but quite subdued for a traditional lambic. Sour cherries and acidic notes mix with some slight oak tones and brett characteristics. Mouthfeel is sharp at first, but dulls and becomes creamier with the addition of yeast. Drinkability remains good, although this is not what I think of as a traditional lambic."
"Taste....I will not do this one justice but here it goes. Sour and funky. That barnyard brett flavor is front and center. Sour cherry. there really isn't any fruity sweetness here, about the closest you get is tart. Lightly metallic and earthy. Mouth seems to be a bit thin at first but it's jsut really crisp and dry. Cuts in and cuts out, leaving your palette with the memory and a sweetart aftertaste. Nice understated pucker factor in this brew. Not a chugger but not a sipper either. Has a champagney body. Really nice, the best kriek lambic I have had so far."
"This beer kicks some serious ass, and if there's a better kriek out there, I'm looking forward to it."
"The best by date is March 12, 2023 so maybe this is a bit young but I don't think it's as developed as I would have liked it to have been. But it's still really good and quite impressive as it stands now."
"Sparkling in the mouth, light and fluffy feel. It's hard to resist drinking something like this, it's very graceful, yet powerfully defined. With such a long shelf-life, I'd love to see another bottle 15 years from now...I don't even live in the same house for that long."
"Stopped by Kahn's in Indianapolis again today and was surprised to see 2 of these on the shelf. Why did I only pick one up? Oh well, there'll be some lucky soul to get the last bottle. I didn't really know what to expect this being my first proper Kriek (ie not Lindemans). Merely taking the cage off caused the cork to fly out, hit my 9 foot ceiling than land about 6 feet away. That certainly made a nice first impression. Pours a deep ruby red with an immense (obviously) pinkish head that is very soft and cloud like. Aroma is very sour with just a little hint of mustiness, if you strain (or imagine) a faint note of cherry is perceivable. Taste is intense. Very tart. Definetely causes some pucker. The brett funk becomes more prevalent as the beer warms up. Cherry is present in the finish. Great drinkability. I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to sample at least 1 Oud Beersel product as this Kriek will surely make a fan in mourning of me."
"Pours out a blood red color with a big head that has to settle down a little bit before drinking. Aromas of cherries hit the nose first with some big tartness follows it quickly. Taste was just down right terrific! Sweet and sour, but it's more on the sour side. Geuze like with a bunch of cherries added in to make this so smooth. Finishes very, very dry. Almost reminded me of Orval with its dryness. An excellent beer! And this isn't being brewed anymore? I'll go weep in a corner now. If you see this, buy it by the case! Best before of 12-2022."
"Poured a very dark pink/red colour with a nice foamy pink head. Thick, sticky lacing around the edges of my glass. The smell is very musty, reminiscent of an old damp, dank basement. Also, there is quite a bit of yeast in the smell as well. A tiny bit of cherry, perhaps some other fruits, way down in there, but certainly not overpowering like alot of other lambics. The taste is really sour/tart and leaves a bit of dryness in your mouth. Very tasty. Only the after taste has any fruit taste to it. Fairly carbonated, but easy to drink nevertheless. Overall, I was quite impressed with this one. Very nice."
"Medium bodied, the cherry doesn't get in the way of the lambic and really ads to the overall flavor."
"I must confess my lack of familiarity with this style. I enjoyed a few Krieks on visits to Belgium, and the Netherlands, several years ago, enjoyed them, but had no interest in taking notes or learning about the esoterics of the style. I don't intend to disparage this one, simply because I'm now more accustomed to the sweeter Krieks. In fact, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. My personal preference is for a Kriek to have a dominant cherry personality, which this one lacks. Still, this one is nicely complex, and highly drinkable. Obviously, this is a high quality lambic. Just not your average Kriek."
"If you ever see any of this beer  Buy It!! For sadly, soon, it may just be a memory. Sigh..."
"This to me is the perfect drinking kriek and the great intermediate step between the sweet poppy nature of the Lindeman's products and the hard unforgiving assertiveness of the Cantillon and Boon lambcs."
"this is a wonderful thing, and may be my favorite kriek among the several I've sampled!"
"The big, faint pink, foamy head dies very fast leaving a bald, clear, pinkish red beer with hallucinations of gold. It's hazy on the last pour. Nose is sour, musty, farmy with cherries. Very cool. Front is tangy, then puckeringly sour. Wow. Middle is almost spicy, full and complex. Fruity and sour to be sure. Finish is astringent and earthy. Best Before date was 05/04/2022. It would be great to see how this beer evolves over the next 18 years. But sadly, mine is empty."
"I wouldn't drink another of these, although using it as a marinade might be an option."
"Thanks to my buddy Matta for this one Beautiful shining ruby body wears a superbly laced pink head, generous and fully lasting even half an hour later. Sticky and foamy... very impressive. Core cherries aroma, orange peel, light brett funk, great balance. In mouth, its fairly carbonated, sour and dry. Admirative notes of oak, dust and unusual pineapple. This is lovely balance, very smooth and quaffable for a lambic, but still full of the eminently refreshing character. Very fine execution and sadly discontinued. The balance and total absence of any artificial feel is what really puts this one apart."
"12.7 oz bottle. Pours a highly carbonated brilliant red, with a massive pink head, and lots of lacing. Aroma is tart and musty, like old hay. Taste is the quick pucker of a lambic with just the right amount of cherry and some malt to balance it out. Finishes smooth and dry. I really like this. Very tasty"
"Pours a beautiful red with light pink head. Nice lacing along the glass. Tiny bubbles. Smells of tart cherries almost like a dessert. Interesting aromas very pleasing. Taste takes off with a sharp tartness that is very interesting. Mellows out a bit and rounds out with nice cherries and many other flavors. Tastes almost like a wine at times, but it still has a nice grainy/bready taste to it. This is one intense brew. Tartness reigns supreme, but the multitude of other flavors makes this a great lambic. Very refreshing brew for a nice hot day."
"Vaguely hazy, amazingly scarlet in hue with a tint of magenta, it has great color depth. A massive amount of bubbles raced towards the largely white but noticeably pink influenced head. I was very impressed with the head retention; it reached a modest half finger in height and held that size for a long time. The subsequent lacing was lacking, as in none. This is a beautiful beer visually. The nose screams real deal lambic! There is a big, all encompassing airiness about the bouquet that somehow captures the essence of Belgium, it seems bigger than the beer itself; it wraps the other aromas in a nice little parcel. This package contains notes of hay, cherries that are largely tart, barnyard funk, a box of nails, wine, stray sourness, lemon, two-week-old wheat bread, wood, and a sack of old barley. The potency is a little shy for me, I worked hard for the subtle aromas, I am glad I found them as this is one inviting beer. The palate is very refined, there is no bullshiting here, it is straightforward, pedal to the metal tart; it is puckering tart. That is damn nice and very refreshing. After a few shocking sips I could notice more cherry flavor, wood too, hay, funk, a bit of white wine, lemon zest, some bready notes, grape skins, and more cherries. Damn this is tart! If you missed the point Ill summarize, this is complex. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant, medium in body with big carbonation, as wanted. I have no complaints about the mouthfeel but Id like a touch more bulk, thats just me. The drinkability is excellent. There is a whole lot of flavor and it jived perfectly with my tastebuds. I found it amazingly refreshing; I know this would be killer on a humid summer day. I hope the next time I visit Johns Grocery in Iowa City they will still have some more to purchase. That is where I bought my 12.7-ounce bottle. Recommend."
"Appearance: Ruby red body pink finely carbonated head leaves behind thick patches of lace nice appearance. Aroma: Black tart cherries very acidic in nature with some cherry sweetness as well, pleasant yeast note as well brings a bready subtle tone to the table. Taste: Extremely tart blend of cherries, touch of cask aged notes excellent traditional lambic, not as lip puckering as a Cantillon but tart nonetheless. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied effervescent bubbly texture. Drinkability: Nice all around traditional fruit lambi, excellent stuff and damn affordable around 4 dollars not bad at all. This is a drinkable lambic I love the complexity of a Cantillon and the candy like sweetness of a Lindemann's but this one has a balance that I just find more palatable and consumeable for session drinking."
"This one raises a middle-finger to friendly, fruity versions of the style. Then it spits in Lindemans face."
"This beer poured a deep red almost maroon color and formed a pink salmon bubbly head that retained itself, only slowly subsiding leaving trace lace. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of cherries, yeast, plus wine aspects with a hint of wood/pine. A flavor of cherries, with a vinous quality not found in the sweet types. The finish is sour and astrigent in wine style that is not present in Lindemans and others."
"Overall Impression: A quite high quality kriek, though a bit too sour without much overt fruitiness to compensate. Beautiful color, foam and clarity. Quite a clean flavor."
"Served from a corked and caged 375 ml green bottle with a best before date of 2022. The smallish cork popped with little effort. When the geuze-kriek was poured into a glass chalice, an ample fizzy pinkish white head formed and gradually settled into a fine, rich blanket with thicker edges and fantastic lacing. It was quite effervescent...like champagne. This pink-ruby hued beauty was very pleasing to the eye! The complex nose was beaming with fresh cherries, accompanied by sour-tinged oak, earth, and must. The first sip was very puckering, in a lemon juice kind of way. With the second sip, the puckering was gone, and in its place was a fantastically complex array of sour/tart notes that danced on my palate. This delightful celebration of flavor was infused with juicy cherry essence and earthy tones. The kriek finished dry and alive with long-lingering cherry tartness. The flavors were big but masterfully balanced, resulting in an extremely satisfying experience. The carbonation was just right, and the body was appropriate. The Vandervelden family made a fine product here, and it is sad that they are no longer going to produce fine ales such as this again. They don't much better than this!"
"This was wonderful."
"The taste was of tart cherries, and an excellent tasty yeast 'bite'. The lingering effect of the tart taste was very nice, and it certainly made me want more. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, chock full of the various malts used in this beer. This is one beer that is highly drinkable, but must be done so with considerable respect--there simply aren't many beers in the world like this one. Although I'm not a huge fan of the lambic/gueze/faro family, I know a classic when I taste one, and this is certainly one of them. Happy New Year!"
"I believe this brewing has stopped brewing? If so, that is a true shame. I will be buying more of these."
"I am not very fond of Lambics-Fruit style beers, but this one I truly enjoyed drinking and rating. It poured an average sized ivory head with fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was clear with very lively carbonation with a red-ruby hue. The nose was that of cherries with a sweet, cherry, sour, tart and tangy flavor. It had a tingly and dry mouthfeel and was light bodied. This beer left a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass. This is a Lambic-Fruit beer that I would definitely drink again if given the opportunity."
"Deep dark red with tons of bubbles. Champagne-like large wispy head that fades to form a quarter inch that stays for the rest of the session. Smell is sour cherry with hints of horse blanket and raw earthy yeast. Taste is sweet for a brief second and then overwhelmingly sour. Sour but dry cherry dominates with more hints of gueze. Dry champagne-like finish. Cherries are real and raw, and the flavors here are amazingly complex and satisfying. An amazing beer!"
"I recommend drinking this beer at cellar temperature. Cold, it is needlessly dry and only faintly aromatic. Warm, it bursts with rich aromas of giant clods of pressed cherry pulp and baked cheese. On the palate it has the noble richness of aged vinegar and oak barrels combined with vitamin C, sour cherry and dough flavors. There is a distant Luxardo-like cherry pit dimension that shares bitter almond and almond paste nuances, something that adds sweetness as it warms. Extremely persistent, complex and balanced on the finish. I would serve this next time with fish in sauce made from this beer."
"This beer is a beauty, it pours like a perfectly clear ruby in liquid form. There is perhaps a hint of haze, but you really have to try to see it. This bottle was not highly carbonated, the head is almost non-existent when carefully poured into my glass, it is well carbonated though because when I agitated and swirled the beer it quickly shows a nice pink head. There are notes of sharp acidity in the aroma, musty old barn, a hint of cherry there too. This beer is bone dry, as any authentic lambic should be, and sharply acidic at the front of my mouth, yet it finishes with a mellow acidity and a bit of tannin. In the finish I also find a bit of an astringent cherry pit flavor perhaps (definitely astringent, but is it cherry pit derived). I did not detect this astringency in the Gueuze though. The color and clarity of this beer is stupendous. This is definitely a hard lambic, it does not have much of the soft acidity of some. A hint of cherry at the front of this beer but other than the color, one would be hard pressed to identify this as a fruit beer, much less one made with cherries. Citric acid seems to be the most dominant acid flavor, and I do not detect much in the way of ascetic acid. As this beer warms up the acidity becomes a bit softer, more round, the malt seems to be clamoring for attention a bit more. This beer is still bone dry but the cherry seems to express itself a bit more, in a cherry fruit sweetness sort of way."
"Incredibly shrill and sour in the mouth. Some support from the cherry, but this is really a one note beer right now. Very long, but not very complex. I hope this just needs time in the cellar, as its not up to the level of the gueuze from this fine brewery."
"The aftertaste is quite bitter (the hop again). Not sweet. Medium body."
"There seems to be an infinite number of beers I have yet to try, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm going to miss this one. One of my favorite lambics."
"A superb brew. There are few finer beverages that have ever passed my lips."
"Oud Beersel's Kriek, packaged in a caged cork 375 ml bottle, pours a brilliant, ruby red grapefruit juice-like hue with a monstrous, bubbly pink colored head that settles into almost nothing. Subtle trails of lace are left down the flute glass. The nose features a musty, extremely sour lambic profile (and rightfully so) that will almost make your eyes water after a long whiff. The taste, after one gets past the tart, sour acidity, is quite nice. Notes of sour cherries, an almost chewy graininess, and hints of oak are evident. The finish is bone dry. This is a complex and refined traditional kriek, to be most certain. The mouthfeel is outstanding, as it coats the palate with a huge effervescence. The acidity, not to be forgotten, cuts right through the palate, as well, leaving its mark. As far as drinkability is concerned, this is quite drinkable for a gueuze lambic veteran. If you can stand the sourness, this is very refreshing, almost like a fresh squeezed lemonade. Highly suggested for fans of traditional lambic."
"Red color, cloudy. Head is pinkish and medium. Aroma is wood, old basement mustiness, some fruit and some yeast. WOW Big sour kriek. Cherry flavor is sweet and sour and tart and fruity. Vinegary, woody and earthy. Complex taste. Sweet and sour flavors are well balanced. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a lingering cherry tartness. Very nice beer. It nearly a crime that its not being made any more."
"Pours a clear brilliant red, with a smallish pink head. Aroma is sweet, lot's of tart cherries, some other fruitiness, and a bit of the barnyard. Flavor is tart cherries, some slight other fruitiness, super sour, somewhat acidic. Body is medium, super dry ending."
"Golden amber hue with excellent clarity when decanted off the sediment. Mountainous, pitted head slowly erodes into persistently frothy, muddled fluff. Waft of vibrantly tart, fresh, but prematurely picked cherries and red currants hit the nose at first. A superceding melange of cheesy old hops, pungent lactic notes and sweaty, enteric ammonification lend an impression of savory, mild blue cheese, which contrasts and offsets the initial brightly tart fruit well. Sharp, acetic tartness a notch shy of pucker inducing bathes the palate at first, then yields to rounder notes of oak aged, still vinegary, young balsamic. Damp, earthy mildew mid palate widens in an agreeably musty suggestions of rain soaked horse and wet cork. A vague grainy, wheat like presence surfaces late along with a resurgence of underripe fruit of a red grape like nature, only to be superceded by an enveloping, yet bone dry, dessicated hay impression. Very well attenuated, superbly crisp and soft on the palate. Finishes expectedly dry, yet complex and oddly lingering, with hints of porous flora laden oak and sour sop. A fabulously balanced, immensely quaffable, well crafted kriek. It has the depth of character of a fine gueuze, and although a kriek, cherry wasn't a dominant flavor component. The microbial community steals the show. Best before March 2022. It's young and will only continue to improve. Delicious!"
"After a 10 minute reflective period that also served as an acclimation session for my palate, I was able to taste the fruit more clearly. The cherries really did take on sort of a cranberry character. Ive never eaten a sour Belgian cherry, but I assume they dont taste like Bings or Maraschinos ;). Still, the tartness is more reminiscent of the native swamp berry of the Northeastern US. The soft carbonation is very reminiscent of any other Belgian style beer (dubbel or tripel especially) and the licorice-like flavor that emerged late reminded me instantly of Orval. A bit of warmth resulted in very little dulling of Oude Krieks intensity. I was still shaking my head at the end of the bottle"
"I have stashed away a couple bottles of this to see how it tastes in a few (or twenty?) years."
"Drinkability: As with all traditional lambics, this is where the ratings get interesting. If you enjoy these styles, the drinkability is top-notch. If not, trying one of these is a complete and utter shock to your system! Luckily, I love a good lambic, and this one is damn good."
"The aroma of this authentic Kreik makes my spine and teeth tingle with anticipation or is that just the tartness I know I'm going to experience? Great lambic aromas of horse blanket, hay, and other barnyard smells. Its deep pink/maroon body contrasts the light pink head. This is very dry, acidic, and tart. A slight cherry flavor is somewhat noticeable. But for me it was a little hard to drink since there was barely any sweetness to balance. Reminded me of the Cantillon Kreik I sampled at the brewery. Very nice, but I'm not quite there yet with my appreciation for the tartness of the authentic lambics."
"Had at the Taste of Belgium event at Celtic Bayou in Redmond, WA... Nice cherry aroma and taste backed up by a surprisingly strong sourness. This is the kind of lambic beer I like. Some sugary sweetness, but this brew is mostly all about the sour cherry flavors. Quite good."
"I've had so many sweet semi-lambics lately (ie. Lindemann's) that I was quite relieved when I popped the cork on this and could smell the tartness of the lambic immediately! It's been refrigerated upright for some time, and carefully poured, but the body is still quite hazy. I guess the high level of carbonation pulled it up as soon as the cork was released. The color is a reddish-orange-brown. The head is magnificent, however, with a glowing pink foam that continually holds a densely creamy 3/4"" head. The aroma is blessedly sour - it even smells astringent (can it be? Or is that the hay/straw suggesting it to me?!) - and vinous with just a hint of the fruitiness below. The body is thin but the extremely fine & effervescent carbonation (which starts crisp) warms to give it a creaminess that helps it to appear fuller. A mouth-puckering lactic sourness welcomes you to this exquisite gem before warming to reveal all of the standard lambic qualities: woody with loads of oak and and a touch of pine, horseblanket, barn, sweat, leather, earthy, powdery, soapy... an amazing array of flavors. It's surprisingly bone-dry with the cherries lending only a very minor thread to the cloth; and appearing quite vinous, even more like grapes in the finish. An authentic kriek lambic! An astonishingly complex beer that is meant to be mulled over and enjoyed for a good part of the evening. Highly recommended to those who understand geuze and lambic!"
"Along with the Beersel Oude Gueuze, this is great for its style (in this case a fruit- cherry- lambic). Gets it spot on. Stinky barnyard nose (which i like) Earthy, dry, acidic, sour, grassy, refreshing and just the right amount of cherry flavour to keep you interested, and it ain't sweet which is good, world class kriek-lambic, a must try."
"Notes: Some like their fruit lambics sweet, this lambic is brewed with sugar but it seems virtually all of the sugars were fermented out leaving it tart and dry. This is the way I like my lambics."
