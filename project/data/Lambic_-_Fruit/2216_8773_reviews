"O: The nose and taste were almost polar opposites, but this beer managed to provide everything I enjoy in a fruit lambic, really wish Armand would bring this one back 4.5/5"
""
""
""
"O - This was wayyyyyyy better than the Hommage we popped to do a side by side. Tough to land but at a large share like this, definitely worth it"

"Verdict: A delicious framboise from Drie Fonteinen, one I wish they would make more often. It's not as delicate and bright as the Lou Pepe Framboise for me, but still a wonderful showing of raspberries with nice layers of funk and acidity that don't overpower the beer or let it get too sweet."

"Overall - Significantly more sour than Hommage. Totally different representation og raspberries."

"Bottle shared at the epic sour sourpuss tasting (thanks to trade with gEUS). Pours a murky red brown with a small pinkish head. Massive raspberries coming straight out in the aroma along with barnyard. I don’t just mean barnyard like a lot of sours have barnyard, I mean absolutely full on, I really am down the farm (with raspberries) barnyard. Manure, hay, jam, earth, horse blanket. Flavor is light to moderate sweet and moderate acidic. Some lemon citrus aspects lingering in the palate in the long dry finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Yes this is excellent. Really good."
""
""
""

"Pour is a deep magenta with a wispy pink head, which recedes to a rim. Some effervescence. Smell is bright, juicy raspberries, cobwebs and funky blue cheese. Quite jammy. Huge raspberry profile carries over to the taste, with an additional increase in the level of cheesy funk. Quite sour. A bit of lactic creaminess, and a touch of oak on the finish. Very drinkable, despite being more sour than I expected. A top notch lambic for sure, but I think some additional time will do this well."
"Overall, this is probably the best beer I've ever had. Completely lived up to the hype, and then some. Would love to see how it is doing in another 5 years, as I believe it has legs, but I doubt I will ever cross paths with this one again. Seek this out."

"Bottle shared in NH. Pours rich purple with a creamy, light pink head. Heavy tart raspberry nose. Flavor is well and tart, with deep raspberry, faint funk, light dryness, hints of wood and grass, a few earthy touches. Light to medium in body with fine carbonation. Good, biting sour finish, a bit of funk, rich raspberry notes. Superb, delicious beer. Extremely refreshing."

"O: Very very good, even with only a small sampling. I don't know whether I'll ever have an opportunity to try this another time - but I'll be very excited if I do."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I gave up a lot to try this brew. It lived up to my standards and more. From what I have heard; Hommage makes Framboos look like child's play. I imagine this statement was exaggerated. I need to try LPF too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very, very good, and definitely lived up to the hype, but not so vastly better than a similarly aged Cantillon LP Framboise that it's worth giving up the farm for. I'm quite happy I was able to try this, but it's not something I'll be seeking out a repeat bottle of, given the cost of acquisition."
""
""
""
""
"A really exceptional experience, one I feel lucky to have had. A stunning beer."
""
"O- This is a really wonderful beer, the flavors are delicious and very complex, it's just damn impressive. Easily amongst the best fruit lambics I've tasted. Now if only I had a few cases of this..."
""
""
""
"This is simply an incredible raspberry sour, which I have soft spot for anyway. With more time in the bottle, I am sure some of the fruit will give way to more of the trademark Drie Fonteinen funk. It will be tough for it to improve on how much I like it now, but it should mellow out for sure."
""
"2011 750ml bottle into a few glasses. MASSIVE thanks go to Stakem for sharing this with us. It’s definitely one of those beers that I never thought I’d get to try. Deep ruby with a thin head of light pink foam. Robust and soapy look that stays very strong. Smells of straight up strawberry jam or some other juicy berry flavors. Some shaper acidity and funky notes burn the edges of the nose a bit. Jam and funk, what a combo. Taste has like a tart rhubard thing going on with some backing sugars. Funky sourness on the edges with a dry oaky finish. Medium bodied with some initial sharpness and a softer bubbly feel that fills out the rest. Not hugely complex but balanced, crisp and very drinkable. Thanks again Adam!"

"for the cost, value, etc... i found this lacking. hoping time takes this to another level like the '99. good but not really worth the whale hunt."

"Bottle 2011 version. Side-by-side with 2007 Hommage. Dark murky red, almost purple highlights and no head. Not necessarily inviting. Aroma is rotten raspberry, some rubber, very earthy. Taste is better with tart raspberry. The acidity is still quite tamed which makes it drinkable. Light and flat palate. I prefered Hommage as their was less of rotten raspberry and cherries added a nice twist. I really had a hard time drinking my pour, maybe it was a bad bottle but my tasting friends liked their glass so old raspberries might no be my style."
"1999 Vintage. Pours a cloudy red with a very minimal head that collars around the glass rim. Raspberry nose to be expected but the raspberry is a little more muted than I anticipated. Some wood notes as well and funk. Tart and sweet raspberry, caramel, with a nice building level of sourness. Very nice. Medium mouthfeel. A little under carbed and I think more carbonation would benefit this beer. Overall, very good. 3F please make more."
"This was good but far from great. I would take an LP Framb or a Rose d G over this one dispite the rarity. Glad I got to try this but not one I would trade my cellar for."
""
""
"Solid carbonation. Good mouthfeel. Overall a great beer. 1999 was better than 2011 but both are very solid."
""
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a moderate to effervescent level of carbonation. It is super drinkable with zero alcohol impact. A super solid jam-like fresh raspberry inclusion jumps out and is very enjoyable mixed with afterthoughts of funk and earth. This brew flirts with perfection as it captures everything I look for in a fruited lambic. My only gripe being the plastic that emerged from this didnt blend into the entire experience quite like I wish it would have. Regardless this was a wonderful treat and something id love to have again. It hurts knowing how rare this bugger is."
""
"O: The best in its class for a raspberry fruit beer. A great lambic too, but not the best, or my favorite. That’s not to say this isn’t an awesome awesome beer. I would drink this everyday. Thanks for the treat Chad."
""
""
"Note: A couple months after this review, I tried Framboos side by side with Hommage and was surprised how tart the raspberries were in Framboos. I didnt notice it as much when I had it on it's own, but they were puckeringly tart when I tried it again. I can't wait to see how it balances out with the funkiness in a couple years."
"750mL 1993 ed thanks to forgetfu. Pours a hazy orange amber with small pink foam that subsides. Much less vibrant in color compared to the 2011 batch. Nose instead of seedy raspberry is more jammy raspberry with cherry/rhubarb pie, vanilla, rich dessert profile. Taste is bracingly citric sour with mega lime juice acid. Finishes bone dry. Soft carbonation. Very juicy with a long, leathery palate. No acetic acid. Not really even lactic/yogurty. Just very bright and and fresh. Unbelievable that this is from 1993. Very drinkable. Demands to be drunk in large gulps. Unfortunately, each gulp will cost you $100 so better take out a second mortgage. Very delicious. One of my favorite beer experiences ever. 6/9/2012 9/4/9/5/18=4.5"

"750 ml bottle shared by cpferris. 2011 version. Big thanks to Chad. Pours a dark reddish amber with a small white head that settles pretty quickly and leaves close to no lacing on the glass. The aroma is tons of raspberry. It's bursting with fruit. There is also a bit of funk and a mushroom note as well as a faint, slightly unpleasant medicinal note, and some strawberry jam. The taste is tart and dry. Lots of raspberry, just like the nose. There is also a light funky earthiness, a bit of strawberry jam, and a little cherry. The finish is dry and tart with a bit of funk and lots of lingering raspberry. Medium body. Low-medium carbonation. This is great right now. I'll be curious to see how it ages if I get the opportunity to try it again."

"Bottle shared at Blue Palms during RBSG 2012. Thanks to Dak for letting me have a sip off his glass after I got snubbed on a pour of my own (not cool enough I guess). Pours a hazy deep berry purple color. Striking fresh raspberry aroma, lactic yogurty, lemon, currant. Vibrant raspberry flavor, as potent as any raspberry beer I’ve had, while maintaining a great balance between lactic and acetic sourness, also melding the fruity sweetness with the firm sourness brilliantly. A lovely beer."
""
"Were it not for its rareness I would certainly keep one kicking around the cellar as an exemplar fo the style. Great brew."
""
"Pours a cloudy reddish color with a light pink head. Smells of raspberry, leather, red wine vinegar, and oak. A touch salty too, which is a bit strange. Lemon and straw, a touch of earthy funk. The flavor is quite sour, though it leans toward the acetic side. Still, some nice lactic notes and lemon zest. Raspberry is there, as is a bit of oak, leather, and must. Not anywhere near as funky as most 3 Fonteinen beers. Enjoyable, but not amazing."
"o - overall, i'm floored. this beer blew me away. lots of these talked about beers fall short but this one really lived up to the chatter about it. AMAZING. funk, magic, berries."
"Beer on a whole new level of world class."
""
"Given the hype surrounding this beer, I'm a little disappointed. Very good but this isn't as impressive as Hommage was and its close to on par with the Scharbeekse kriek in my opinion. A great offering from a great brewery but its not worth the trouble in this case."
"A great sour nonetheless; very glad I got to tick this."
"Overall: I am not usually a fan of fruity beers even some of the best ones in the world. But this beer is a fruit lovers wet dream. So good so much fresh raspberry flavor. Glad I got the chance to try this"
"Pours a deep pinkish-red with a moderate white head. Smells primarily of raspberries in a fantastic way with some oak and funk hanging out there as well. The raspberries really carry the flavor, but there's a nice tart and funky lambic sourness that complements it. It's only moderately sour though, not puckeringly so, and the flavors come together really nicely. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this was really quite an excellent beer, one of the better fruit lambics I've had. It was especially impressive for me as raspberry beers tend to disappoint me, but this one really came through."
"OVERALL: This is perfect that I obtained enough for cellaring as I will be opening up a bottle once every other year with my Swedish or Chicago friends alongside me. There is so much potential as it's a little bit unruly and so much complexity will occur over the years."
"Pours a murky red with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some pretty complex raspberry and woody aromas. Taste is much the same but not as sour as I was expecting based on the aromas. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great aromas and flavors and a definite treat to be able to sample."

"3.5/5/5/4.5/5"

"O: Smooth, easy to drink, and just really enjoyable! The balance is just perfect. I was stoked to have had the opportunity to drink this beer at S&B while also purchasing a couple bottles for takeaway. I'm excited to see how this one ages as it is still quite young, but all in all a very enjoyable beer!"
"Overall: both are good, debatable if they are worth the effort to acquire but that is a different story. We opened a rose de gambrinus next to these two bottles, it couldn't even look on them. I found the 1999 slightly better and it would be a 4.75 overall."
""
""
"It is hard for me to pick a winner but I guess I liked the newer one better. I think what makes the beer different from any other 3F sour is the fruit which was way way more forward in in the newer one. It would probably be better with a year or two on it but after more than a decade the 1999 is probably over the hill a little."
"Overall, both vintages were delightful. What a treat. I'm so grateful for the experience."
"Win and score goes to 99 (5) versus 12 (4)."
"Scores for 2011: 4 / 4.5 / 4 / 4.5 / 4.5"
""
"2011 Scores: 4.25/ 3.75 / 3.75 / 4 / 4"
"Overal: A perfectly balanced beer. I noticed some differences in the level of carbonation between the two bottles. But besides that, this beer is stunning. Again, if you want a more complex taste, take a geuze or let the Framboos age for several years, because the lambic is still a bit too young. But.... if you want to experience the best fresh fruit lambic ever made, drink it now!"
"Overall: A very good Framboise with an exceptional aroma. I would have liked more carbonation but the low level of it was not detrimental."
"OVERALL: This was the star of the show tonight and it certainly put on a stunning performance. With awesome raspberry flavor all over the room, a light tartness and a touch of bitterness as balance, this beer was a real decadent treat. It is still very fresh at this point, so the nose and taste are almost completely dominated by the fruit. Given some time, however, it will mellow out a bit and allow the lambic to mature and play a larger roll. As a comparison, Hommage, which is also a raspberry lambic and has been maturing since 2007, is mellower and somewhat more complex now that the fruit has faded and the lambic has developed. Regardless, the increadibly bold flavors that Framboos brings to the table right now are a real treat, and I'm very glad my mate twisted my rubber arm and convinced me to attend the festival. It will be fun to see this beer develop over time as well. Thanks for bringing this one back from the grave Armand. This was phenomenal."
"Overall: This is a very good beer, but I think it will get even better with age. It smells absolutely wonderful."

"Cheers!"
"D - I initially wrote that this wasn't significantly better than Hommage - then I tried Hommage and realized I was totally wrong. It's perhaps too sour to drink in mass quantities, and the the rarity and price tag make it unlikely I'd ever be able to have more than 2oz. Still, it's clearly a superior lambic that has held up quite impressively, even after 12 years. As much as I nursed my glass, it emptied depressingly quickly."
"D - Simply impressive. The raspberry is all over this one, which truthfully, I wasn't expecting after all these years. Destroys all other sour raspberry beers with ease and just excellent. Will I ever have it again? Probably not...how sad."
"drinkability is great. great balance. restrained but prominent sourness and acidity. great berry character. wow, this is one damn good beer! if only there were an endless supply available..."
"Those who say this one is past its prime are wrong."
"The carbonation was medium and the mouthfeel was light. I suspect the age had something to do with the carbonation being a little low for a lambic."
"This is the drie fonteinen Framboos/Framboise enjoyed (thanks to JorisPPattyn and MartinT) with MartinT, kimchee, Oakes and Tiggmtl. As Joris points out, this is refermented in bottle. The vintage is 1986 and I swear this bottle is like 1 inch thick. The cork looks completely ravaged like in an horror movie. Apparent soil lie everywhere under the cage which is barely holding in place. There is no label on this bottle, the vintage is written with chalk, simply Despite its age, it opens up with a serious pop. A nice off-white to pink head forms over the top of the reddish, pinkish orange body. Such a head seems like a mirage from the past and scores an easy 5. The aroma is totally unique and exploding of raspberries. They hit the deep end of your nose and penetrate your brain and you know when it happens that the smell will haunt your memories for a while. It feels very dessert-like, wet, creamy. Some sweetness seems to come from the vanilla notes. Its earthy, leafy with leathery peaks. Very complex lemon and citrus complement the lactic tartness and funky brettanomyces character. In mouth, its definitely the most lactic beer ive ever had. Extremely dry and fruity, dusty out-of-date yoghourt. Potent lemon juice with the wheaty acidity really coming out. With the slightest effort (and its really not that demanding actually), you grasp all the typical barnyardy and horsey characteristics. Aftertaste is long, tart, astringent, salivating, begging for more, but begging to let this moment be enjoyed for a while. Medium bodied, very dry and with medium to high carbonation which seems like a miracle. Once youll have tried it youll know, but its one of those beers that is such a labyrinth of flavors and at the same time keeps such a nice focus that its just adorable and deserves to be seeked out and tried to be believed. It's hard to paint in words all the nuances a brewer can attain when exploiting his full brewing art potential."
