"This thing blew me away. Really amazing beer."

"D - Best Zwanze in years. I was really glad the event was so low-key that I was able to have multiple glasses of this one.. Hopefully I can drink a bottle at the brewery in a few months. Great beer to drink on a patio on a sunny fall day."

"O - Another great Zwanze creation. The cherries complement the base version of Iris very well and it is very drinkable. I am really glad I made the trip down to try it this year. I hope to try the original version in the future."
"Beer is light in body and bright on the palate, it is sour with hints of fruit sweetness but dry finish. It is super easy drinking and a wonderful not overly fruited beer. I really loved this beer."

"Burgundy, ruby body with a small, off white collar that gradually receded to a thin collar. Aromas of red wine, huge oak presence, musty funk, basement, light cherries. As expected, this is lovely. The unblended, earthy, mineral qualities of Iris are complemented by a soft, tart cherry presence, offering a delicate sweetness, similar to a fine burgundy.  Musty, funky throughout, with low carbonation. Delicious."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Some very nice stuff here but i think the base is also amazing without the fruit addition. Wonderful beer, would love to have it again some time."

"Overall (4.5), this is a fantastic beer. There is a lot going on, as one might expect from a hoppy lambic aged on a small amount of cherries--there are just so many components and it's a testament to the guys at Cantillon that it doesn't become a mess of a beer, instead blending all the various components into seamless, refreshing beer."

"O. Not to be redundant but oh what a treat. I barely got a ticket which makes this special.  Worth the early morning line. It is a beer to be celebrated and the staff and patrons at the Holy Grale in Louisville made this the case. An excellent beer, with many characteristics of a Kreik. Just delicious."

"Ruby red pour with a small cherry red head. Big sour aroma of cherries. Flavor has a an amazing acidic sour cherry flavor backed by just a touch of yeast. Light bodied and mildly carbonated. Great tart finish."

"O- As I expected, this is a more than solid beer. Very significant improvement on the Iris Grand Cru. I enjoyed the complexity here more than anything else- sour cherries, dry hopping, pale wheat, and plenty of that Cantillon brewery funk that never fails to remind me of my visit to the brewery last year. Ah, memories.. [4.25]"

"Overall - Really good.  Very glad for the opportunity to try this!"

"Overall - A vast improvement over last year's Zwanze. Impressive."

"Pinkish red, almost purple in appearance. Slight bloom that dissipates quickly. Some lacing. Lovely, floral bouquet of berries, lemon, and cherry. Very complex flavor profile. Definite notes of cherry, lemon, and slightly yeasty flavors. Smooth, refreshingly tart and very drinkable. Another classic from what may be the greatest brewery in the world."

"Taste is like a young kreik, the cherry is in a good spot but not all that sour, very fruity. A bit dry on the finish, easy drinker. Really nice beer, very happy to try it. not mind blowing but way better than I expected.  How can ya go wrong? A day of cantillon and friends, thank zwanze day!"
"What you would expect from a Kriek mixed with unblended lambic. Sour cherry, chardonnay barrel, touch of caramel. Vegetal bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel. Acidity high but balanced. Interesting experiment, I think successful."
