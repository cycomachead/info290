Massive raspberries coming straight out in the aroma along with barnyard. I donâ€™t just mean barnyard like a lot of sours have barnyard, I mean absolutely full on, I really am down the farm (with raspberries) barnyard. Manure, hay, jam, earth, horse blanket. Flavor is light to moderate sweet and moderate acidic. Some lemon citrus aspects lingering in the palate in the long dry finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Yes this is excellent.

Itâ€™s definitely one of those beers that I never thought Iâ€™d get to try. Deep ruby with a thin head of light pink foam. Robust and soapy look that stays very strong. Smells of straight up strawberry jam or some other juicy berry flavors. Some shaper acidity and funky notes burn the edges of the nose a bit. Jam and funk, what a combo. Taste has like a tart rhubard thing going on with some backing sugars. Funky sourness on the edges with a dry oaky finish. Medium bodied with some initial sharpness and a softer bubbly feel that fills out the rest. Not hugely complex but balanced, crisp and very drinkable. Thanks again Adam!","Kegatron","Jan 15, 2013"

Aroma is rotten raspberry, some rubber, very earthy. Taste is better with tart raspberry. The acidity is still quite tamed which makes it drinkable. Light and flat palate. I prefered Hommage as their was less of rotten raspberry and cherries added a nice twist. I really had a hard time drinking my pour, maybe it was a bad bottle but my tasting friends liked their glass so old raspberries might no be my style.","Luk13","Oct 23, 2012"

Nose instead of seedy raspberry is more jammy raspberry with cherry/rhubarb pie, vanilla, rich dessert profile. Taste is bracingly citric sour with mega lime juice acid. Finishes bone dry. Soft carbonation. Very juicy with a long, leathery palate. No acetic acid. Not really even lactic/yogurty. Just very bright and and fresh. Unbelievable that this is from 1993. Very drinkable. Demands to be drunk in large gulps. Unfortunately, each gulp will cost you $100 so better take out a second mortgage. Very delicious.

4.44,-1.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml bottle shared by cpferris. 2011 version. Big thanks to Chad. Pours a dark reddish amber with a small white head that settles pretty quickly and leaves close to no lacing on the glass. The aroma is tons of raspberry. It's bursting with fruit. There is also a bit of funk and a mushroom note as well as a faint, slightly unpleasant medicinal note, and some strawberry jam. The taste is tart and dry. Lots of raspberry, just like the nose. There is also a light funky earthiness, a bit of strawberry jam, and a little cherry. The finish is dry and tart with a bit of funk and lots of lingering raspberry. Medium body. Low-medium carbonation. This is great right now. I'll be curious to see how it ages if I get the opportunity to try it again.","jethrodium","Aug 20, 2012"

Pours a hazy deep berry purple color. Striking fresh raspberry aroma, lactic yogurty, lemon, currant. Vibrant raspberry flavor, as potent as any raspberry beer Iâ€™ve had, while maintaining a great balance between lactic and acetic sourness, also melding the fruity sweetness with the firm sourness brilliantly. A lovely beer.","illidurit","Aug 13, 2012"

Lemon and straw, a touch of earthy funk. The flavor is quite sour, though it leans toward the acetic side. Still, some nice lactic notes and lemon zest. Raspberry is there, as is a bit of oak, leather, and must. Not anywhere near as funky as most 3 Fonteinen beers. Enjoyable, but not amazing.","womencantsail","Jul 31, 2012"

4.45,-1.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep pinkish-red with a moderate white head. Smells primarily of raspberries in a fantastic way with some oak and funk hanging out there as well. The raspberries really carry the flavor, but there's a nice tart and funky lambic sourness that complements it. It's only moderately sour though, not puckeringly so, and the flavors come together really nicely. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this was really quite an excellent beer, one of the better fruit lambics I've had. It was especially impressive for me as raspberry beers tend to disappoint me, but this one really came through.","starrdogg","Jul 23, 2012"

Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some pretty complex raspberry and woody aromas. Taste is much the same but not as sour as I was expecting based on the aromas. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great aromas and flavors and a definite treat to be able to sample.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 02, 2012"

I think what makes the beer different from any other 3F sour is the fruit which was way way more forward in in the newer one.

Again, if you want a more complex taste, take a geuze or let the Framboos age for several years, because the lambic is still a bit too young. But.... if you want to experience the best fresh fruit lambic ever made, drink it now!","rvdoorn","May 18, 2012"

4.72,4.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"OVERALL: This was the star of the show tonight and it certainly put on a stunning performance. With awesome raspberry flavor all over the room, a light tartness and a touch of bitterness as balance, this beer was a real decadent treat. It is still very fresh at this point, so the nose and taste are almost completely dominated by the fruit. Given some time, however, it will mellow out a bit and allow the lambic to mature and play a larger roll. As a comparison, Hommage, which is also a raspberry lambic and has been maturing since 2007, is mellower and somewhat more complex now that the fruit has faded and the lambic has developed. Regardless, the increadibly bold flavors that Framboos brings to the table right now are a real treat, and I'm very glad my mate twisted my rubber arm and convinced me to attend the festival. It will be fun to see this beer develop over time as well. Thanks for bringing this one back from the grave Armand. This was phenomenal.","Jeffo","May 17, 2012"

4.74,5.1,4,5,5,4,4.5,"D - I initially wrote that this wasn't significantly better than Hommage - then I tried Hommage and realized I was totally wrong. It's perhaps too sour to drink in mass quantities, and the the rarity and price tag make it unlikely I'd ever be able to have more than 2oz. Still, it's clearly a superior lambic that has held up quite impressively, even after 12 years. As much as I nursed my glass, it emptied depressingly quickly.","MasterSki","Feb 04, 2011"
4.72,4.7,4,4.5,5,4,5,"D - Simply impressive. The raspberry is all over this one, which truthfully, I wasn't expecting after all these years. Destroys all other sour raspberry beers with ease and just excellent. Will I ever have it again? Probably not...how sad.","Sean9689","Dec 06, 2010"

5,10.9,5,5,5,5,5,"This is the drie fonteinen Framboos/Framboise enjoyed (thanks to JorisPPattyn and MartinT) with MartinT, kimchee, Oakes and Tiggmtl. As Joris points out, this is refermented in bottle. The vintage is 1986 and I swear this bottle is like 1 inch thick. The cork looks completely ravaged like in an horror movie. Apparent soil lie everywhere under the cage which is barely holding in place. There is no label on this bottle, the vintage is written with chalk, simply Despite its age, it opens up with a serious pop. A nice off-white to pink head forms over the top of the reddish, pinkish orange body. Such a head seems like a mirage from the past and scores an easy 5. The aroma is totally unique and exploding of raspberries. They hit the deep end of your nose and penetrate your brain and you know when it happens that the smell will haunt your memories for a while. It feels very dessert-like, wet, creamy. Some sweetness seems to come from the vanilla notes. ItÂ’s earthy, leafy with leathery peaks. Very complex lemon and citrus complement the lactic tartness and funky brettanomyces character. In mouth, itÂ’s definitely the most lactic beer iÂ’ve ever had. Extremely dry and fruity, dusty out-of-date yoghourt. Potent lemon juice with the wheaty acidity really coming out. With the slightest effort (and itÂ’s really not that demanding actually), you grasp all the typical barnyardy and horsey characteristics. Aftertaste is long, tart, astringent, salivating, begging for more, but begging to let this moment be enjoyed for a while. Medium bodied, very dry and with medium to high carbonation which seems like a miracle. Once youÂ’ll have tried it youÂ’ll know, but itÂ’s one of those beers that is such a labyrinth of flavors and at the same time keeps such a nice focus that itÂ’s just adorable and deserves to be seeked out and tried to be believed. It's hard to paint in words all the nuances a brewer can attain when exploiting his full brewing art potential.","Rastacouere","0"
