4.3,-1.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 6/11/2024. Pours light hazy orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big ripe plum, green apple, lemon, lime, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, plums, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big ripe plum, green apple, lemon, lime, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of ripe plum, green apple, lemon, lime, hay, straw, grass, white vinegar, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of fruity/funky yeast, plums, and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding fruit lambic style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky yeast, plums, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 20, 2015"

Taste follows nose with a light saltiness.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and an easy astringency.

I liked the gueuze well enough and liked this well enough for the same reasons (maybe it's a bit tarter?). But the plum, which I had expected to really be the defining characteristic of this beer, was barely present for me, which makes it interesting that some others here got so much plum character while others got so little. This is the second plum beer I've had and the previous one was the same; surely some of the tartness comes from there, but what I was hoping for was more wonderful perfumey plum flavor and didn't get it. It went nicely enough with Thanksgiving dinner regardlesss. Sours aren't cheap, but the price for a 12.7oz bottle of this was nuts - and I didn't notice it until I'd paid for my whole haul.

Underneath the dominant, acidic tartness, refreshing sour notes become recognizable, with a subtle, lovely hint of fermented fruit to it. The fruitiness itself is surprisingly sour, of unripe plums and green apple, which is very soft on tongue, while the brett acidity dries out the palate. Not too fruity, compared to the sour aspect of the beer, a subtle addition. During the finish, acidity reaches its peak, overwhelming the fruit flavor completely, leaving back a slick, tremendous sourness.","aleigator","0"

4.47,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2012 edition, absolutely stunning. some huge quantity of plums in this gives it just a pink shade and isnt overly fruity or sweet, a testament to its maturity. hazy as orange as it is pink. the nose here is tart from the plums, not sweet, almost not ripe or something, with the lactic funk of quality lambic and the oaky maturity of a well blended gueuze. wishing for nothing else, the flavor just explodes for me, the right mix of sour and funk, its weird and open fermented feeling and farmy and all of that, but its also quite puckery, especially in the finish, but it never really gets acidic or churny in the stomach like many others, its balance there is insane. the fruit adds less than expected, maybe a product of age, but it just adds a touch of sweetness and that tartness you get from the skin of the plum. it really is a cool use of fruit, and an expertly made beer. the tilquin gueuze has come to prominence recently given the sour craze we all seem to be on, but this is a level better than the base beer, its incredible really, one of the better fruited sours i have ever encountered. a beer you have to try to believe.","StonedTrippin","Sep 29, 2014"

Being used to the strong tartness of Cantillon brews, I was surprised to get this nose of quite typical geuze flavors, but more retrained than usually and combined with the scent of sweet plums. The beer tastes tart enough to qualify for the honorary title of ""Oude"" but with the fruitiness comes along pretty harmonic and drinkable. Like it!","safaricook","Sep 27, 2014"

Big time aroma of apricots, sweet plums I guess, and lots of funk here, wheat malt, tartness. Flavor follows with a sweet punch of apricot and plum, sourness, sweet wheaty malts, juicy, not as dry as expected. Finish is long and puckering with some oaky dryness, medium bodied with medium plus carbonation. Very nice but I think I liked the Gueuze better. Perhaps this would dry out if I let it sit for a while.","BMMillsy","Sep 02, 2014"

The plum character is delicate and ephemeral, with a blend of sugar, juice, ripe purple dandy pluots (those are all I have on hand to compare to), and is most noticeable juts before the finish. Moderately funky, though not as strong as the nose would suggest, there's must, mushroom and petrichor.

Small chunks of sediment sink to the bottom of the glass after the pour. Smell is sour and tart with malt, acidic, and plum or other dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with sour dark fruit and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel.

The nose comprises tart lemon zest, tart plum (I had no idea such a thing even existed), and a mild bit of tangerine. The taste brings in more of the same, with the tartness coming on rather strongly and some extra plum making an appearance near the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a damn fine beer, especially for those who like their sours to live up to that adjective with vim and vigor.","TMoney2591","Sep 01, 2013"

Plum is such a sweet fruit, but here it's reduced to the acidity of the fruit skins and the slight nuttiness from the pits.

We're in lambic country, so normal rules do not apply, not that I'm much of a believe in appearance ratings. The aroma is plum jam on top of mild vinegar and gueuze funk, but the fruit is dominant. The plum smell is on the apricot end of the plum world. It definitely smells like plums, but there's a fair bit of variation within plums. This beer smells more like what is sold as fresh French prunes, around here, rather than the juicier, sweet-tart Santa Rosa plum that I more closely associate with the fruit, though I have no idea what Tilquin actually used, of course. The funk is mildly cheesy with some nice horse blanket tendencies bouncing around (it's been too long since I used ""horse blanket"" in a review). The taste is light to medium tart with more of that fruit flavor. It's still relatively sweet and a tad lacking in flavor for what I expect from a plum sour, but I don't mean that as a knock. It's just a tad different than expected. The fruit flavor is refined and melds nicely with the tartness. There's a big lemony note. The vinegar tartness is actually pretty restrained, and there's none of that back-of-the-throat burn that many American sours suffer from. Tilquin does a magnificent job balancing the flavors, showing off that quality lambic brewer touch. Carbonation is normal. Mouthfeel is a tad slick with fruitiness. Moderate pucker. I quite enjoyed this beer. It's not a dramatic beer, but it has a lovely fruit flavor and oozes lambic complexity and refinement.","popery","Beers"

Cloudy, honey-amber color with slight purple tints, and a small off-white head that receded to a wispy cap but never fully dissipated; minimal short-lived lacing. Beautiful aroma, jammy sweet, plum and peach, funky, tart, acidic. The aroma was well-reflected in the taste, a good snap of lactic tartness up front, citrus, funky grass, mid-palate bringing in cool, sweet flavors of plum and other stone fruit, dry tannic finish, with a lingering plum skin aftertaste. Very tasty, very enjoyable. Body was medium, mouthfeel crisp and prickly, medium carbonation, extremely smooth for the style, especially considering the acidity.

The plums drive this beer but they shine because of the subtle and gradual lemon-y lactic acidity that culminates in the finish but it's not bitingly sour. It's light and gradual, providing a long sour finish. This is an absolutely gorgeous beer that is beautifully put together.
