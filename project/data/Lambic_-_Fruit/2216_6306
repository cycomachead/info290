The aroma is sour, but is somewhat softened by the cherries. The taste is also sour. The cherries give it a nice taste, whitout making it a sweet beer. Carbonation is relatively high.

Effervescent. Lots of funk and oak in the aroma, big lacto notes, herbal and leafy, very little cherry detectable until the beer warms a little, but I prefer having this one nice and chilled. Nice acidic twinge right up front on the palate, lemony lacto, natural-tasting sour cherry, freshly chopped oak, notes of dried leaves and grass, with a decisive yeasty funk, horseblanket, and a tiny fruity sweetness peeking through every once in a while. Complex and tasty. Medium body, puckering mouthfeel, high initial carb dies down to a more moderate level fairly quickly, making for an overall tasty and enjoyable kriek. Exemplary.","Rifugium","Jul 11, 2014"

It's not sweetened and it's not unpleasantly sour. I do wish it had more cherry flavor to it, but it's aged so I can't fault it for that. It's pricey, but certainly recommended for any true beer hunter.","deadonhisfeet","Mar 28, 2014"

Huge sour aromas, vinegar, dark tart cherries, dusty dry oak. Flavor is big black cherries, tartness with some light vinegar, dry oaky finish that lingers a bit with the cherry. Big sourness here. Spritzy carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Overall I like this much better than the Intense Red, and just as much or more than Lou Pepe Kriek. Good stuff.","BMMillsy","Mar 07, 2014"

The aroma consists of sour cherries. Tart cherries, a hint of oak, and a touch of sour grapes greet the taste buds as you sip. Carbonation is strong on the tongue and a perfect amount of tartness leaves the mouth wanting more. It is a light body with full flavor.

Pours a lovely deep cranberry hue with a fluffy pink head that sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes and dissipates into a thin tight band around the shoulders. Copious tiny bubbles are evidenced clinging to the walls of the glass, but no lacing. Nose expresses citric acid, cork and a suggestion of tart fruit. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a definite tart cherry presence. Mouthfeel is light in body with a dull carbonation and a subtle acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks - I was hoping for something a little more effervescent, but perhaps it sat on this one a little too long. A very good kriek, but I'm sorry I didn't drink this one fresher. I'll definitely need to track down a fresher bottle in the future.","Jwale73","Dec 29, 2013"

The nose brings whiffs of oak, cherry, berry-like fruitiness, and a bit of vinegar. Tart cherries and oak greet the tastebuds immediately, hints of mixed berries, hay, and balsamic vinegar join in, finishes with the perfect amount of mouth puckering sour and musty oak and a final burst of sour cherries. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Overall, an truly exceptional brew.","chanokokoro","Sep 28, 2013"

The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, funk, and sour cherry. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I have to be honest that this one has become very still with the age on it. However, the cherry flavors are still lingering around which is always nice to see. Also a nice musty funk has come into play as well keeping the beer exciting. The aroma was definitely the highlight though for me with a nice sweet cherry note.

The beer smells soooo funky and acrid. The beer tastes equally funky with a lot of lactic acidity upfront that fades out to the mineral, musty, swampy, almost spoiled flavors. The finish is dry with a salty, tart cherry tang. The MF is very effervescent with abundant carbonation that just sparkles. This is a nice Kriek Lambic, but the overly funky (imo) flavors really mutes the brightness from the fruit.

While enjoying this brew throughout a fairly long duration I was able to swirl some of the carbonation out making for a more rich tasting cherry and smooth feel in the mouth. The smoothness to the finish is quite unique and really melds out that acidic nature of the brew. The alcohol (while listed as 5%) was completely hidden throughout this experience. It doesn't matter to me if fruited Drie Fonteinen offerings are 7 months old or 7 years old, I can't say no and throughly enjoy each experience.","stakem","Oct 29, 2011"

Nose isn't as intense - more cherry than the 2011 vintage and the sour notes are more subdued; also a bit of funky must. The taste is barely sour at all compared to the fresh one; the cherry flavor is WAY more dominate than the sour flavors...almost cherry pie-esque. For big sour notes and less cherry, get the 2011 vintage; for more kriek flavors, though, seek out the 2009.","birchstick","Oct 23, 2011"

Tons of barnyard funk, horse blanket, and just a bit of gym socks. A bit of must too. But amongst all those strange aromas, there lies some inviting cherry and acidic aromas. Taste is AWESOME! Oh so sour! Much more sour than I was expecting. Mouth puckering funky barnyard and sour cherries attack the taste buds instantly. This is very acidic. Musty and quite oaky with some more cherry and sweet fruit. Finishes nice and dry. Mouthfeel is puckering, highly carbonated, and leaves the teeth feeling strange. Drinkability is very high.

Fairly sweet, slightly tannic, cherry-laden flavors. Tasty, but definitely a step down compared to the brighter 06.

It is difficult to beat the color on fruited Lambics like this. No heading comes up, but the color is a pinkish red, with some hazy hues as well. The cherries in the nose come off sweet yet sour at the same time. Earthy notes can also be detected, with just a tiny hint of funk. The cherry flavor here is sweet at the beginning, and more sour towards the end. It never becomes too sour, but instead remains moderately tart. What I love is that you can really taste the pits of all those cherries, which add a tremendous amount of complexity. Mouthfeel is medium, with very little carbonation, just a small hint.

4.2,-2.1,4,4,4,5,4.5,"Tasted from 375mL bottle purchased at West Lakeview Liquors, bottled on 14 December, 2007. Pours a cloudy light red that reminds me of some of the darker Cabernet Sauvignon Roses that I have tried. The head starts off large and pink, and slowly recedes to light lace around the edges of the glass. Nose is super sour, acidic, and funky with some barnyard, and the ever-present underlying sweet aroma of Kirsch. This beer is undoubtedly dry starting off with stinging acid and vinegar funk, then moving onto the sour cherry flavor and finishing with a combination of the above with the funky addition of a slight burnt rubber flavor. There is a hint of vanilla oak in the middle as well. The body is light with sparkling acidity and a long, funky, and sour cherry finish. The acidity lingers for quite a long time, causing my mouth to continue watering.","wedgie9","Dec 21, 2010"

Not much lacing. Aroma is funk, cherries and oak. The first sip was really funky and musty, but after that the funk settled down some and the sour/tart cherry flavor became more noticable. The finish is nice and tart. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, the low carbonaton helps make this brew go down pretty easy.

Funky/earthy brett and wine-like characteristics are dominant in the nose too. Taste is sour cherries, tart and juicy, coupled with slight bitter flavors. Old oak barrels and brett make up the rest of the taste. No flavors really linger, a very clean flavor profile. Light in body with carbonation that is not high but definitely more than moderate, very appropriate and refreshing.

Tart and refreshing. Sourness isn't too acidic on the stomach like some lambics. Great musty, sour funk mixing with the fruit. Layers of foam all the way to the bottom of the glass.

You can definitely tell it's gonna have a sour bite. Upfront on the palate the sour cherries do run the show but seem more natural tasting then juice like cherries but has barrel oak funk, citric lemon, slight vinegar, and brett accents. The brew was medium body with good tingly carbonation which had a sweet, sour, and slight dry finish. It drank really good and has to be one of the best krieks I've had in a long time.

4.42,3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Insanely good beer! Drie Foneinen has figured this whole Belgian thing out. This Kriek is no different. Holding true to what Krieks are, this beer has a delicate acidity that steers clear from sharpness or astringency. A clean tartness that comes from the cherries are a perfect compliment to the vineous blended lambic base beer. Tartness take the shape of pie cherries, under-rippened berries, crabapples, and malt. That's right, a steady stream of pilsner malts add just enough sweetness, body, and creaminess to buffer the palate from the intensity of the sour beer. A light cork mustiness gives an earthy complextion to the beer from the nose to the finish (despite the synthetic cork). A real surprise is the low-lying carbonation which keeps the acidity from becoming amplified. Still, the beer does not rest heavily on the tongue; rather giving a mellow soothing demeanor to the session. Krieks just don't get better.","BEERchitect","Jun 12, 2009"

This is just an aggressively sour Lambic. It is not nearly as funky as some, in fact the funkiest that it gets is that plastic-like phenolic note that almost seems a bit like lacquer of some sort.
