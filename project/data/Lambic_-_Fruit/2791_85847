The appearance was excellent, a dark orange brown with frothy head. Unfortunately, after that everything fell off the cliff. The aroma was similar to Martinelli's Sparkling Cider with maraschino cherries. There were subtle notes of pumpkin pie spice, but nothing like a good framboise. The taste was even more disappointing: very little sweetness, watery sour apple peels and hints of pumpkin pie spices. Considering the high price, I really felt cheated.

3.78,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/20/2012. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of tart green apple, pear, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, gingerbread, clove, pepper, brown sugar, toast, grass, and earthy yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; smells like apple pie with some pumpkin. Taste of tart green apple, pear, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, gingerbread, brown sugar, pie crust, grass, herbal, clove, and light yeast spiciness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, gingerbread, brown sugar, grass, pie crust, pepper, clove, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity of fruit and malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance; and almost zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, fairly crisp, and foamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish as expected for 4%. Overall this is a very good non-soured fruit lambic. Nice malt/spice balance and complexity, with moderate tartness; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this quite a bit.","superspak","Jan 17, 2013"

3.78,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Mikkeller opened my weird-ass-lambic door with his coffee-spiked Spontankoppi, and now I'm walking down the hall with a pumpkin lambic straight outta Belgium. Here goes nothin': It pours a clear golden-amber-orange topped by over a finger of off-white foam. Honestly, when I think "pumpkin beer", this is what usually pops to mind (you know: something that looks like a friggin' pumpkin!). The nose comprises nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, dry wheat, and a touch of vague funk in the background. It's an odd combination that ends up being inoffensive and just a tad off-putting. The taste starts off with a short bit of mild wheat, then charges headlong right into some straight citric sourness. Near the finish, the sourness tapers off a bit and blends nicely into the aforementioned spices, the usual suspects of the pumpkin beer realm. It's a strange combination, really, but not a bad one surprisingly. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, definitely not your average flavored lambic. As things progress, the spices seem to soften in the face of an increasing sourness, but some funky wheat tries to take its place and keep the fight alive. There's something about this strange dichotomy of flavors that keeps me from completely enjoying it, in the strictest sense of the term, but I can't at all say it's bad. It's good, just in a confusing way...","TMoney2591","0"
