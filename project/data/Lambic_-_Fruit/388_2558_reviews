"I was expecting a lot from this beer based of reputation.  Maybe my expectations were too high."

"Poured in a tulip glass, golden with minimal fizz. Minimal head. Quite tart with citrus notes with tangerine/orange, and sea salt."
""
""
""
"The aroma is salty, spritzy and seltzer like with a dry Chardonnay and citrus. The flavors are deeply citrus with a fresh squeezed pulpy orange at first blush. It moves to a tangy lemon and  then apricots surprise. There's a nicely complex earth tone surrounded by white wine. Fabulous tangy feel without being sour or puckering."
""
""
""
""
"Very dry, crabapple tartness, lactic sourness. Puckeringly sour. Delicious. Big grape tartness, as well."
""
""
""
"Straw yellow. Almost a sopressata funkiness, wet gym socks, spoiled milk. Tastes incredible - great sour, grapefruit, tangerines. Awesome"

"O: Tasty, and highly drinkable.  A nice brunch beer.  Among my favorite Cantillon."
""

""

"One of the more subtle of the Cantillon's, but that is a compliment to the brew."

"Dry, funky white wine. Great grape influence and that signature Belgian funk. Doesn't drink as heavy as other Loons I've had. Quite refreshing really. Awesome beer."

"Pours a nice gold beer. Nice head. Smells like funky yeast, apricots. Taste is really nice. This is the best apricot/peach beer I've had. It not only tastes like apricot, but it also tastes like apricot pits. The flavor is very intense. Body is on the thick side due to apricot puree (my guess)."

"Overall:  Another great fruit lambic from Cantillon and one I will buy whenever I get the chance. 4.5"

"O- I think for the rotatings I would go Saint Lam>Viggy>Fou for the big guns. This beer was better than I thought it was going to be. I have a few more to see if I get variance."

"I acquired a 750 from a craigslist cellar clearing... the beer corked and popped with little to no carbonation... the smell of funky musty grapes and oak emanate from the cork...pours very golden yellow with some funky grape peel smells coming off the lightly carbonated body....go in for the taste and it is a of a fine oak aged grape juices very wet and juicy on the palate funk and slight tartness nothing too sour...the finish is dry but the juiciness of the grapes is present in the 2013 bottle...Absolutely a beautiful introduction to the Cantillon Brewery."

"i had the esteemed pleasure of having this on tap and in a bottle just one day apart, which is not only a rare treat, but something to almost feel guilty about, beer this sought after and all, but i am thankful and will remain that way. this beer, for carrying so much hype, isnt as distinct as i expected it to be, and in fact is an awful lot like the classic gueuze itself. i think the grapes are a little more vibrant in the on tap version, but the properties of both are quite similar honestly. the bottle pours hazy golden, still looking, but with a short white head. as per cantillon usual, there is as much funk as there is sour here, tons of musty oak in the nose, and i get the lambic part of it long before i get any fruit. the fruit is a little more dramatic in the flavor than the nose, and has a sweetness to it. more of a riesling thing to me than a muscat one, although i dont drink a ton of white wine, i get that vibe from it. the oak is nice on it, really robust and mellowing, and the sourness too is tempered by it. tart for sure, especially in the finish, mouth watering like crazy, but the fruit doesnt add as much to it as either of the berry beers they do, and certainly not as interesting as the elderflower mamouche i had earlier in the week. its hard when comparing so many world class sour beers, but for me, the fruit is lost a little in this one, not as radiant and memorable as others they make. i love the complexity and the ancient feel to this, how truly high quality it is is certainly obvious, but im not sure the grapes make it any more special than the lambic is in isolation. nice dry but mouth watering finish, good acidity, and maybe a touch undercarbed. overall outstanding beer, but not my favorite cantillon brew by any measure."

"2012 vintage procured at the brewery during May of 2013. Pours a dull, orange-gold hue with a hazy clarity. Head is loose and off-white and quickly dissipates into a tight, thin band around the shoulders of the glass. Nose is fantastic - lovely grape aromas with just a suggestion of tartness. Taste expresses quite a bit of fruit, a light tartness and a slightly salty character. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a mild astringency and a residual acidic burn at the back of the throat between quaffs. This beer was delicious and more than I expected. I'm quite amazed at how much I enjoyed and think it may surpass my love of fou' foune. I'd love another bottle for extended cellaring."

"750 ml bottle capped and corked from Tipples. Bottles November 23, 2012 and poured May 25, 2014. Pours hazy golden with a half finger fizzy white head that dissipates almost immediately. Super musty dusty aroma, oak, funk, huge acidity, apricots, grape skins, a bit of vinegar, tart and sour smelling, very light vinous notes. Flavor is intensely acidic and sour, some floral notes on the tongue, citrus zest all the way through, dry oaky finish, and some lingering vinous warm left in the throat. Mouth puckering like whoah. As this warms it mellows a bit and the white wine notes become more present. Spritzy and prickly carbonation--lots of it--and light on the palate without sacrificing bold flavor. Super dry. Extremely clean and crisp. Good stuff."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw with half an inch of bubbly white head that fades quickly into some wisps and a medium collar. Aroma is dry oakiness, white wine-like and a good earthiness. Taste is tart grapes, some vanilla and oak. High carbonation and low-medium body. Very tart overall and the grape plays a decent second string."

"O: Good drinkability. Classic Cantillon, I mean, a very fruity beer that is, at the same time, tart and extremely dry"
""
""
""
"O: Very smooth, ultra dry, very cheesy, musty, and flavorful. Balanced and not overbearingly tart. Gueuze-like. Loved it."

"O - There's no wonder this is rated so high. No hype here folks!"

"I would have loved to see what this is like fresh and would definitely want to track down a fresher bottle to see the changes this monster has gone through."
""
""
"I'm glad I finally got around to trying this one, I had a little stash of Cantillon that I forgot about a ways back and I'm just getting to them now. With 4 years on this bottle I'd love to try a fresh bottling for comparisons sake"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A great one, the muscat grapes add a hint of sweetness and an extra layer of complexity."

"An enjoyable one to drink. I came into this one not expecting too much out of this Cantillon, but this one definitely exceeded expectations. So clean, crisp, sour, funky and fruity all in once. I highly recommend this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have yet to have a Cantillon beer that i've had any problems with, always delicious, always satisfying, this beer is no exception."
""
"O-What a beer. The best Cantillon I had that day, perfect balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is great. Nothing like what I expected from a grape lambic."
""
"Flaws? I can't seem to find any other than if this was a notch less sour it would be undeniably perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm so glad I had the chance to try this - this drinks excellently on tap but I'd imagine it would be a little drier and tart from the bottle. Quite frankly, I enjoy its off-dry, musty flavor as is, as it retains a funky complexity that is cut by the semi-sweetness from the grape must. In terms of being drinkable, this may be the highest one I've had so far from Cantillon. Absolutely a must-have to convert those to sours. I doubt there's any brewery that can top this level of quality with brewing with white sweet grapes such as the moscatel varietal. I will definitely seek out more of this in the future."

"O: Highly recommended. Would love to have again. Exceptional."
"Sampled from a 750ml bottle at Moder Lambic. Beautifully presented in a wicker basket and carefully poured by the waiter. Golden and clear with a small white head. Aroma is white grapes. Flavor follows. Very crisp and clean with a firm bite that doesn't overpower. Dry but with the perception of a mild sweetness. A fine feel with a medium yet firm carbonation. This is a fantastic beer with outstanding wine influences."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my second Cantillon beer, and I have to say that it also lived up the the hype. The puckering tartness works perfectly here. Extremely balanced. Maybe a little less complex than other sours I've tried, but nonetheless world class."
""
""
"Wow...this is amazeballs. How can you get this much sweet grape winey-ness and sharp acitidity to balance with the delicate brett over such a light grain bill. The white grapes really shine. This might be my favorite Cantillon I have had to date. Thanks Frank!"
""
"O: Very good. Not over the top with sourness or tartness, but it has enough of oak and white grape tartness to draw you back in."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is light with good carbonation. Overall this one is great. Another real enjoyable brew from these guys."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Currently my least favorite Cantillon, so still better than a lot of the beer I've had in my life. If you're around Cantillon a lot, give this one a try eventually. But if you've only got a little time and can try only a few, I might let this one slide and stick with the Lou Pepes, St. Lumnivous, Fou Foune, etc..."
""
"Overall, a very nice beer but not one of the better Cantillons."
"O-This is maybe the most interesting Cantillon I tasted at the brewery, but not my favorite. The musty grape flavor just did not jive with the lambic in the same way that, for example, the apricots do in the case of Fou Foune. My criticism aside, this is still a very good beer and better than most other fruit beers out there. The acidity here would pair well with a white fish dish or salmon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Great complexity and balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Color of unfiltered apple juice, with a small, pure white head. Smells like melted rubber in a wet basement. Tastes incredibly complex--I might have to say a wine snob's beer if that makes sense--lots of layers here: dark fruit, red wine, a little barnyard funk, with a slight hop flavor here and there. Very drinkable. Strong harmony of flavors lingers before fading off the tongue, like an orchestra's perfect decrescendo. Alright, enough bullshit; this was just a great beer."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was very impressed with this lambic - I think 1.5 years in the bottle has done it well. This is very well balanced and the muscat grapes definitely give this one some delicious flavors. I could drink a lot of this stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I got this at the same time as a bottle of the Saint Lamvinus. I had very high expectations for the St. Lam, and while both were great, I actually ended up liking this a bit better. If you're a fan of the style, this is definitely worth seeking out."

"OVERALL: This one was rather enjoyable. Perhaps a bit more acidic than the other Cantillon fruit lambic we had that night, which may turn some people off. I found it quite pleasant and would glaldy drink this one again. Thanks again farundrpar!"

"Not unlike wine. Not that sour either. A clean if bracing palate cleanser."
""
""
""
""
""
"A really solid fruit lambic. There is an earthy note added by the grapes that is really nice. I'd love the fruit to be just a touch more prominent but I'm clutching at straws here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I thoroughly enjoyed this. Damn."
""
""
"Cantillon is consistently fantastic. This is no exception. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to try this. I'm curious what a couple of years of age would do to this, since it's already so balanced."
"Nice soft fruitiness with the Cantillon funk. Yet another beer that I need more of and will never see. Time machines are coming right?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn't think I'd like this more than St. Lam, and I definitely do. Fantastic beer."
""
"This bottle was over a year old when I bought it but that only seems to make it more tart and almost austere at times. I love a good lambic since it shows the real limit of beer at the sour end; this is a 5% ABV that is extreme in the way it takes funky yeast flavours, fino sherry flavours and at times a taste like an old Normandy Cider combined with a bracing tartness. One of the most intense lambics I have ever had but still totally drinkable and very complex for the style."

"O: This tastes great. St. Lamvinus is more complex, but the fruit character in this is really cool."
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied, low carbonation, probably a bit too low for the style. Overall though, another nice sour from cantillon."
""
""
"Overall. Not my favorite of the Cantillon I've tried, but love the style and could drink this all the time."
""
""
""
"O-Another great fruit lambic from Cantillon. Having had this a few times, I think I actually prefer it aged as opposed to fresh. It loses some of the gentle grape character as it ages, but it becomes incredibly more sour."
""
""
"O: Another fantastic beer from Cantillon, I just can't get enough."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was another great Cantillon, however I can't say I like it as much as others that I've had. Although like other Cantillons I've had it was almost perfect for the style and left me craving for more. Even the guys I split it with were very glad I introduced them to Cantillon and had no remorse over paying the fairly high price tag. Overall very good and I'd recommend it to anyone. Don't expect anything extremely sour or over the top funky, just a very enjoyable slightly funky muscat grape flavored beer."
""
""
"4, 4, 4, 4.5, 4.5"
"D - Among the most drinkable of Cantillons I've had so far because the sourness isn't absurd yet the flavor is still inviting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Like all Loons, they are good. Some just arent as good as other loons."
"O - Sweet and subtle tartness. Cantillon does no wrong."
"O: Unbelievable, it is beers such as this that give Cantillon the reputation that it deserves."
"Overall this is a super offering once again from the ever impressive Cantillon. Another winner and a nice change of pace the traditional darker fruited lambics. Definitely with your time and well worth seeking out for fans of the style."

"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by cmrillo at his own party! Served from bottle into a Cantillon taster flute. Poured a golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, white grape, wood, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sweet fruit, grape, tart, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The grapes really took the headliner of this show as they were very well pronounced and very well integrated throughout the aroma and the flavor. This one was really quite easy to drink as there wasn’t really that much of a sour or tart aspect like most people thing when they have a brew like this. A really well done brew from one of my favorite breweries. Hope to try many from them in the future and I hope you are able to do the same."
""
""
"Really drinkable, really tasty."
""
"One of the best Cantillons I've ever had. The extra acidity and grape presence is great. Will definitely seek out again!"
"I cant believe i have not had this its definately something im keen to try and pours a murky apricot hue with a fast vanishing sparkling one finger head,the smell is wet hay,green apples,vinegar and typical lambic funkiness,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of green apples,white sour grapes,barnhouse funk but not as much as the other lambics,a touch of vinegar,warhead lollies and finished just like a granny smith apple being sweet and sour,overall its a nice pleasant Lambic which isnt as full on as the others and a nice match of lambic and grape cheers."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear straw to orange with minimal head. Nose of apple juice, chardonnay and a hint of smoke. Light tartness with fruity finish. Wine like. Clean sourness on palate. Enjoyable, though nothing that really jumps out at you. After drinking it I was informed it was aged in wine barrels. Makes sense, just not my favourite Cantillon beer."
""
""
""
"Aging beer was once described to me as being much like wood working. An object is artfully crafted and is beautiful to start out with, and aging a beer is like sanding that piece. Removing all the rough and sharp edges. Sometimes this is not desirable in either case, but sometimes it takes something amazing and improves on it. This is much more like the latter. Though the beer is much more sour, the flavors are very soft and full and smooth. Lots of winelike flavors, a bit of vinegar, and lots of lactic acid. The funk is hard to place, somewhere between sweaty and dusty and moldy. Mouthfeel was dry, but as I would expect from a beer this old it got flat pretty quickly.mOutstanding beer, even better experience."
"O: I think it's actually more apricot-like than grape-like. Delicious, either way. Note that if you get an older bottle (and you probably will), it will probably have a lot more funk and at least a bit less fruitiness."
""
""
"Not a bad drop, but it certainly seems harsher and less refined than some other Cantillon beers. There's a rugged unapologetic nature to this brew which makes it less approachable than others, even if you're forced to respect it."
""
""
""
"O- A delicious lambic, Cantillon doesn't disappoint."
"This beer poured a light bodied Belgian pale esque gold in color with a slight white lacing around the glass and moderate carbonation. The aromas are very earthy, funky, floral, and herbal. It has some tea leaf to it. The flavors are dry and musty, funky, earthy, have some grassy hay to them, feature lit acidity and is somewhat citric. It drinks very light and dry. It has a moderate bite from the carbonation. The aftertaste leaves a resonating flavor or herbal spice which I really appreciated. I really liked this one. It was different than I expected."
"find it, don't overpay for it, and drink it."
"Fantastic."
"This was so good I ate grilled octopus with it. Which if you know me, you know this is a huge feat. It stepped down in quality from the Iris for me, but I'm not worried moving forward! 4"
""
"Pours a murky yellow with an off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is super sour, tart, and funky with a lemon aroma. Taste is the same with a sour lemon flavor on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good lambic with an awesome flavor."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Drinkability – A decent lambic, but a bit too sour for me to find highly drinkable."
"appearance is golden with a thick fluffy white head. A small sip brings incredible sweetness followed by sour. The aftertaste is incredibly dry, almost like sucking on a block of salt. Definitely a sour from the nose to taste and followthrough. It's got intense sweetness that's followed by a dry dry, Mouth-Puckering sourness. Incredible beer that manages to stay drinkable to the end."
"Overall – A good lambic from Cantillon, but not my favorite. Still, very tasty."
""
"Poured into a Cantillon balloon glass, this beer was a light golden-peach color, mostly clear, but a little foggy from sediment towards the end; a minimal layer of delicate bubbles capped it off, with no real retention or lacing to speak of. Aroma of pale malts, white wine, and some musty funk. Taste of fresh cut grass, white wine, apple skins, oak, a dash of Champagne, with an ubiquitous mild funkiness throughout. Very nice, very delicate. Sour, but not lip-puckering. (Though it should be noticed that this followed a Russian River Supplication, so my palate might have been biased.) Light-bodied more or less, and very enjoyable overall."
"O - A really nice-drinking lambic that has benefitted from the age, IMO. Awesome of Scotty to share this with me, and it's something I'll be chasing to get a hold of more. This destroyed the '08 St. Lamvinus that we opened directly after. Excellent stuff."
""
""
"O - I think this may be the mustiest beer I have ever had. It overpowers most of the other flavors and made the beer fairly hard to finish. With all that said I still enjoyed it for what it was. I will have to give this one another chance in the future."

"Overall: Over the past year, I have grown to truly love nearly everything Cantillon produces, and this is no exception. White grape is not my true favorite fruit, for which I adjusted the overall score down half a point. That has to due with my preference more than the production value, however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - another solid offering from Cantillon. I really liked the grapes in this - I was expecting more of a vinous characteristic, however it was more of a soft white grape flavor which pleasantly surprised me. Good stuff!"

"This is really good. The only one of the standard range which rivals the Lou Pepes. I feel it works much better than St Lamnivus."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modestly light level of carbonation. The alcohol is pretty much completely hidden. It is a light and lively brew with a great depth of flavor and aroma to take in. I found it to be very enjoyable and easy drinking making me fly through a glass and reach for more."
"Mouthfeel: Just perfect with the grapes and perhaps some tannins, medium body in heft"
"750ml bottle served into an Oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on sep´11.Flews golden in color with a foggy appearance.Off-white closed bubble brief crown.Yeasty,woody,fresh grass aromas with subtle fruity hues.Fresh flower upfront followed by a earthy rough palate,white raisin zest, smooth sourness.Light but intense body.Medium carbonation. Dry finish & fruity aftertaste.Well balanced beer.Perfect pairing with dry old cheeses."
"Medium bodied with a nice mix of dry, tart/earthy funky notes and sweet light fruit. Dry and very puckering without being harsh or acidic.  Sweet acetic vinegar lingering complimented by sweet vinous fruit notes.  Grapes are still prominent five years later.  Hints of dry, earthy oak and musty funk are perfectly balanced with a lingering sweet vinegar finish that leaves me thirsting for more."
"This beer is a hazy tan with a good bit of carbonation and fluffy head. The beer smells smokey and meaty with a good bit of funk. There is lots of tart lemon, and grapeskin in the finish. A little horsey with dry bitter mineral finish. The beer is light and dances on your tongue."
"""It tastes like youth"""
"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, slightly sticky and lingering on the tongue. This was probably the only beer (out of 12) that I wasn't really into at the event, although I don't enjoy muscato in the first place."
"o. a good food beer, the carbonation makes this that much more than a table white."
"O - I don't remember this beer being dominated by vinegar last time, but I've only had this fresh. Not as acetic as other beers I've had, but definitely not put together well."
"Quite nice, though for being rarer, was not noticeable more impressive than more common sours (Bourgogne de Flandres)."
"o - really good. not in your face. sour. smooth and easy. wine like."
"Poured into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel that really made it shine."
"Overall: Less grape than I would have expected, but still very good. Tart and refreshing. I would definitely have more."
"Although I enjoyed this beer, I definitely consider it to be one of the more tame offerings in the Cantillon lineup. Additionally, I was a bit disappointed that I could not pick up any muscat grape nuances. Nevertheless, this is a refreshing treat, perfect for sipping on a hot summer day."
"Drinks pretty nicely. Not my favorite Cantillon-- but quite nice and enjoyable."
"Bottle with a 2007 cork date. Pours a slightly hazed hay gold with a small head. Nose is wet hay, dank basement, lemon, typical bold and tight Cantillon funk. Lightly vinous. Mouth is much more grape-forward than the nose. Dank, wet horse, fairly sour, white grape spiraled in. Not as tight of a fruit integration as they often achieve. After a few sips it's evident that some ridiculous acidity is going on. Becomes literally painful to drink, in a way I haven't experienced before. Okay, not great, one of their weaker fruit lambics, aside from the absolute chore it was to drink this. Perhaps a younger bottle would have been better in that regard."
"o: a great offering from Cantillon. I would love to have the chance to have this beer on tap one day."
"O - Not Cantillons finest, but damn good anyway."
"Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer is both sippable an gulpable. However, I highly doubt that anyone truly enjoying this beer would not wish to make it last."
"Thanks bbehr!"
"O - Another damn fine offering from this amazing brewery. PAcks a great punch of tartness that yoiu would enjoy."
"o - Overall another great beer from Cantillon. I've heard this one ages great so I will hold onto my other 2 bottles for a few years, but it's still great right now. Will certainly have it again."
"Very tasty and hugely quaffable. This one won't live through the night."
"O: Probably one of the more ""under the radar"" Cantillon offerings that provides some uniqueness but maintains a generally mellow flavor profile."
"O - Really quite nice. Another great offering from Cantillon and one that I would definitely like to try again. The grapes added something quite nice to this one."
"Not the best cantillon I've had, but looking forward to the rest of them."
"A+ definitely indulge in one if you have the chance"
"(375ml bottle courtesy of Mike at his sours/saisons tasting). Pours cloudy yellolw with white head. Aroma is yeasty goodness and lemon. Taste is tart with some fruit sweetness. Thin bodied with smooth tart finish. This is a really nice lambic with nice grape flavors."
"Poured a murky pineapple in color with pale yellow highlights that had almost no head and no lacing sticking to the glass. The signature cantillon sour acidic oaky barrel funk was definitely there in the nose with some pungent muscat grape notes and slight vinegar notes as well. It also had some nice mouthwatering citrus aromas. The taste had more of the lemon citrusy character with some muscat grapes, oaky, funky, and barnyard accents but it did have slight acidic notes. The brew was light to medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet but lemon citrusy, oaky, funky, vinous, dry and sour puckering finish that lingered on the palate. It drank really good and I'm always happy to try different cantillon beers anytime. Good lookin out drew for bringing by to bobby's crib."
"D - Certainly not a boring beer. It seems to get better with every sip. Recommended."
"D - Smooth, interesting and delicious. The sausage-like smell puts me off a little, but I think it would work well with a hearty dinner. I can't get over how mild the yeast taste ends up after that intense smell, but not breathing in through my nose transforms it from intense and weird to delicious and fun."
"P.S. Not bad (read: Amazing!) w/cream cheese on Russsian rye & chicken stew!"
"Wow, was blown away by this one. Have had it on tap multiple times (unknown ages) and really enjoyed it, but this one year old bottle really outshines the times I have had it on tap..."
"Bottle. Opens with a nice pop and poured into a tulip glass. This one off the bat is much more tart and lemon zest smelling than the Kriek that I had previously opened in the same night. Pours a yellow hazed color with a fluffy white head that quickly settles to collar around the glass. As said, the aroma is very tart/sour smelling mixed with some wine aromas and barnyrad funk but I want to be clear, for me the dominant aroma is the lemon tart notes. The first sip puckers my mouth pretty intensely. Very dry with a light mouthfeel. After my mouth relaxs a bit the full floavor of the beer is evident; lemon, cider apple, white grape notes abound. Pretty enjoyable but otherwise hard for me to really pick out the muscat grape flaovrs mixed with everything else. The dryness of this makes it somewhat difficult to drink lots, a bottle split 2-3 ways is probably ideal."
"DB- A solid lambic again but not so fruit(grape/added) forward. Very sour but still enjoyable."
"This was one funky ass lambic."
"Definitely pleasant, and with the strong lambicnotes (leather, etc.) quite attenuated."
"D: This is a highly drinkable lambic with the depth and character that permeates Cantillon's line of fine beers."
"(D)- When I think Cantillon cannot surprise me any more than they already have, they somehow continue to each time I try something new of theirs. While this is only a year old, the acidic/sour fruits really balance well with the funk and subtle sweetness. This could age for decades because it is so highly acidic, but the fruits really are tasty in this now."
" D- The bright tartness with the subtle muscat grape flavor and cheese rind work great together. This is easy to drink and crisp and the tartness is smooth enough for another glass."
"D - A really good subtle, refined Lambic. Yet another beer from Cantillon that hits the mark."
"D: To say that I am extremely fond of Cantillon is an understatement. I have thoroughly enjoyed every beer that I have had the opportunity to sample. I definitely recommend this beer, and anything at all associated with Cantillon."
"This golden fluid, the 2009 vintage, is delivered from the tap at Moeder Lambic Fontainas with a fleeting head. It off-gasses scents of nectarines, spiced apricots, chardonnay, inexpertly cleaned white peach pits, and tastes austere, but not as caustic as the bottled form -- aided, no doubt, by the keg format, which thickens the mouthfeel and focuses on the fruit. The funk and sourness are left by the wayside, but it's for a good cause."
"Bottled 12/24/08. Poured into a Malheur chalice. Light lacing and little head with no retention. Aroma of fresh-like green apples and sour grapes. Taste is puckering and sour without funk. Interesting and refreshing. Paired well with a sharp cheddar cheese."
"Nice sour although two glasses was my limit on this one"
"Drinkability: One of the better Cantillon sours I have had. The initial taste is very mouth puckering. The apple and grape tones mix well with the sourness. I would drink several glasses of this if I knew my body could handle this."
"Taste is sweet, funky and quite grapey. It's very tart and puckering. Fairly light mouthfeel but nice sharp carbonation. Quite drinkable for a sour because it doesn't really have that horse blanket taste to it."
"D - overall good, but not anywhere near my favorite Cantillons or even any other fruit lambics. the metalallic taste was really only held in check towards the bottom of the bottle as the dregs sourness cut in."
"(Yes, this one did give me GI distress within a few hours.)"
"Drinkability:This Cantillon is quite drinkable and pleasant. My palate has a tough time with sour/tart beers, but this one is quite nice."
"Nice pucker with a seemless meshing of many pleasant characteristics of a solid fruit lambic. Wish I had enjoyed another."
"D- I love this stuff, off tap it's just amazing. Woukd love to age a bottle of this for a decade. It's not overly sour, I had a few without much trouble. A bit acidic. It's nothing short of amazing."
"D- very tart and sour with bugs galore. Oaky and juicy. Very enjoyable indeed. With two glasses in me and some nice cheese life is good."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable and tasty brew. Every sip is better than the last."
"this is excellent. i always read that this one in general is not as good as others. i find the balance to be pretty spot on. the flavors really blend well."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a few bubbles, but no real head. The aroma is very sour with some oak notes mixed in. The flavor is very tart grapes along with some oak. There are some vinegar components. This beer is very similar to white wine. The beer is very dry. Very low carbonation and the beer has a thin-medium mouthfeel. The beer is extremely drinkable."
"This beer starts out soft but finishes crisp as you're about to swallow. Very refreshing as far as sipping beers go."
"drinkability: good"
"The feel is light and warm. It starts off drinkable then fades as the alcohol finish becomes more pronounced."
"I'm drawing a reasonably straight parallel to the white wine must that I've got fermenting at the moment - yeasty, sweet and zingy white grape juice, and faint alcohol. The exaggerated tartness is the beer's domain alone. Overall, a nicely drinkable sour lambic, the guest muscat grapes doing well to exhibit their own wares."
"D: Really good for the style."
"D= Pretty nice brew. Not as much carbonation as most sours I've had which was a little bit of a let down. The taste and nose are excellent. Seek this beer out."
"D: This beer is exceptionally easy to drink. Flavors are complex and very pleasant. Unique like many of Cantillon's fine Lambics. This is another shining star."
"D: awesome tasty and damn drinkable"
"The aroma is an explosion of tropical and citrus fruit with slight buttery notes. The palette has one of the best deliveries of any lambic i've ever had. It starts with nice pineapple and cantalope, transitions into orange and grapefruit, with a sharp acidic finish. So refreshing! But the grapes are not obvious; this is the least apparent fruit from any fruit lambic I've had. Still, a delight!"
"The mouthfeel is standard (good) for a lambic. The drinkability is high for the style. I often find my stomach getting blitzkrieg-ed by the acidity after only 6 or 7 oz., but this one just keeps begging me to drink more. Right beer, right place, right time."
"This beer walks a fine balance between wine and beer, perfect for the white wine lover! Funky, earthy sourness melds with a ripe juicy yet tart white grape quality, bone dry finish and a touch of oakiness make for a really satisfying experience. I felt the carb could have been upped a bit without hurting it but this beer is hard to fault, great on its own, as an appertif, or with just about any meal. Thanks Rob!"
"Thanks to Phil for the bottle."
"D: Cantillon is one of those breweries that just can't do any wrong. I would gladly drink this one again."
"Drinkability- Doesn't have all those crazy Cantillon funks and musts that are in some others but it's just that this beer is relatively young. For drinkability sake though, this is awesome. It's got a nice tartness, medium acid and is still relatively fruity. Enjoyed the shit out of this beer, should probably grab another for a couple years down the road."
"The beer is grapey for sure, sweet and smooth, low body and a late sour with a tartness that gets me in the corners of my mouth. There isn't a lot of carbonation in the mouth, but this beer is suppose to be thin and the sour comes from acids. This is a great beer. The more Cantillon I have the more I love them. I would serious recommend it. I need to find a bottle so I can compare them."
"D - For such a sour lambic it is really a drinkable one w/ the fruit notes very fresh and vibrant and the evolution of the taste profile as it gets warmer is great. The temp brings out more asrtringency and also light sweetness. I sipped on this for awhile - top notch!"
"The flavors on the palate are through the roof. There's so much juicy, fruity, white grape character that it's incredible. Like a dry white wine, the fruit character is explosive, but the lack of sweetness makes for a very refreshing beverage. The sourness is quite prominent, surprisingly so, with a big lemon character along with a touch of funk. Medium-light in body with a low level of carbonation, this beer finishes dry and pucking, palate cleansingly so, with a lingering lemon juice and white grape character. Truly phenomenal."
"Overall: An amazingly unigue beer that I am happy to been able to try. Thanks to Polly at Avenue Pub for bringing this one in. Not one of Cantillon's best beers but still a good one. At $9 for 10 oz considering the rarity of this beer not a bad price either!"
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a goblet as part of the Lion's Pride Belgian Beer Fest. The beer has a cloudy, opaque peach appearance, like a glass of juice or nectar. There was no head, per se, but I could see some individual bubbles on top that kind of looked like specs floating in the beer.. It coats the sides of the glass slightly. It has an aroma that is both musty and sour. I can smell some peach as well. The taste has some sourness, but not too much. It is a bit cider-like. It tastes aged, kind of like an old oxidized beer, but not quite. There were some ripe fruit flavors as well. It has a light body. There was a good tingling sensation from the sourness. I also felt a slight puckering after I swallowed. It was very drinkable. I could easily go through an entire bottle."
"A nice refreshing drink great for an aperatif."
"Cloudy golden orange, hazy, with a frothy white champagne like head, quickly gone. Smell is an initial wiff thats musty and sour, hints of sweet wine grapes trail. Taste follows scent, with a slighttly less pronounced sour and musty profile, and a little more pronounced sweet wine grape as well as hints of grapefruit, apple and white wine vinegar. Medium bodied, slightly slick, good carbonation. Very interesting beer with a few unique things going on. Worked well as a substitute for white wine with a Mediteranean style meal."
"D: Nice, but the flavors never really completely fused together like they do in most Cantillon beers; still, a very solid offering."
"Overall, another very good offering from Cantillon. However, I would say it is not my favorite of their lineup for sure. Worth a shot but I even prefer the Classic amongst others"
"Perfect carbonation and a nice body. This one was a great alternative for my fiancee and I to drink while our friends got some wine. I must say there are one or two Cantillons I enjoy more, but this was really awesome. One of the most drinkable extremely sour beers out there."
"D - Not so sour as to destroy the palette, so more drinkable than say a 100% kriek. Nonetheless, I think Cantillon has some other offerings more to my likings."
"A solid beer from Cantillon. A simple tartness is the dominate flavor. Still an enjoyable beer. Not nearly as sour and acidic as other beers from the brewery. This really is worth a try. Not one of my favorites from the brewery though."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. Very sour, but I really like it. My glass is emptying very fast. I highly recommend it."
"The pour is yellow gold, with a light head that dissipates into a ring of fluffy white around the edges of my glass. A vigilant swirling allows a very minute amount of lacing to form. Smells of a beautiful sour with hints of sour green apples and mild grapes. There's a gorgeous lacto sourness on the tongue that is smooth as silk. There's mild grapes in there as well. This mouth is very creamy and it does a near perfect job of rounding out one superb beer!"
"750 mL bottle. Enjoyed after Thanksgiving dinner. Pours a cloudy dark gold with a small white head that coats the edges of the glass. A few grape seeds poured out into my glass as well. Smells of Belgian funk, lightly catty, with a light grape aroma. Tastes of even more Belgian fonky funk with a sour fruit and grape note on the midpalate. Finishes puckering with tannins for a very dry finish. Feels light with moderate bubbliness, not quite as champagne like as some Cantillons, but good. Overall quite a tasty brew. The grapes add to the flavor but the star is still the traditional lambic here."
"This is a hell of a beer. Not for everyone, and not for all the time. I'm privileged to have enjoyed it, and under such fine circumstances, I feel doubly so. Thank you Cantillon, for another sublime product."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good for the Vigneronne. You would think the moderate alcohol level would make this one go down quite easy but there are too many strong tasty flavors here to savor. It's a big tart beer that keeps beating around the palate until it screams uncle. Abv is completely hidden behind everything else that is going on here. Honestly, we have another winner from Cantillon. Definitely recommended.."
"Bottle: Poured a bright golden yellow color lambic with a small pure with bubbly head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma of horse blanket with light green apple acidity and light tart finish. Taste is a well balanced mix between some tart notes with light oak and some horse blanket and soaked leather. Acidity is well balanced but muscat grapes are hard to noticed but could have dropped the acidity level since I seem to noticed that there is less acidity then in a regular Cantillon product."
"drinkability is excellent. a tasty mix of sour and funk, with a very drinkable aura and a finish that cleanses the palate. a bit less sour than the Classic Gueuze, but just as drinkable. there is a subtle note of cherry and a touch of pear as the brew warms a bit, giving it some complexity, but in the end it takes a back seat to the funk. cheers!"
"Highly recommended."
"Nice tiny bubbles; soft cushy carbonation along with the prickliness of the acidity, like the two sides of some Velcro getting freaky with each other. Quite refreshing, and the more I drink this and become acclimated to the acidity, the more refreshing and enjoyable it becomes."
"Overall, enjoyable and interesting and certainly worth a look."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with no head. Smells typically sour, but not overly acetic. The sweetness of the grapes nicely balances the sharpness of the sour and mellows everything out considerably, both in the nose and in the mouth. There is almost a peach-like richness of fruit in the aroma. Tangy and luscious. A hint of creaminess in the finish. Very smooth, not too sharp and wonderfully sweet and sour with a hint of tannins from the oak and grape skins. This paired wonderfully with a sharp cheddar and water crackers, with the sweet/sour beer acting as a nice foil to the sharpness and richness of the cheese. Fairly subtle for this brewery, but very complex notes of oak, sweet grape, acetic notes, a touch of barnyard, and a subtle creaminess. Delicious."
"Definitely a good one to drink on a hot Miami night. I could have downed the whole 750 had I not offered it up at a tasting. Very good, but possibly not worth the high price. Possibly. That said, I just might get another, as it *is* very tasty."
"Notes: Further testing will be required for this interesting beer."
"D - A pleasure to drink - another one of Cantillon's lambic experiments gone very well. The nose and the taste are beautiful and dynamic, and it's a joy to witness the beer develop as it warms. I just wish that it had some more carbonation - I can only imagine how long the finish would be if the carbonation would make the beer sparkle on the palate for even longer! A must-try for lambic lovers."
"D: A very good beer. Unfortunately, the bottle was cellared for a couple of so the taste of grapes was on the decline, but still very good."
"D: Good drinkablity. This effort by Cantillon is still very young, I don't think I've had anything younger than about 3 years from them before, this is just a year old. The flavour is very good, but other aspects of the beer need some work. In 5 years it could justify its $19.99 price-tag, but not today."
"Overall, really glad to see this is on tap. Haven't really had the chance to have many Cantillons on-tap, but this was well worth it."
"Overall I liked it, but not sure I would seek it out again given the price of Cantillon beers."
"The beer is light bodied with medium carbonation"
"750ml bottled 12/24/08, I think it was $18. Orange, still, not many bubbles. It smells pretty great, funky lambic with a taste that follows suit and adds a acidic sourness but muted. It has a kind of syrup quality to the feel, funky. This was an interesting lambic but I'm not sure my palate was up to the challenge as I really didn't taste the muscat grapes other than a faint hint of Diet-Rite white grape soda."
"So wonderful to have a chance to drink a Cantillon brew on tap. Pale rose-tinted golden brew, no head to speak of, in keeping with the style. A Champagne-type fine-bubbled carbonation. Aroma of lovely tart funkiness, characteristic Cantillon vinegar-brett aromas. Love the tart flavor from the first sip...fairly mild when compared to other Cantillon offerings, very drinkable, with a lightly grapey finish. Excellent aperitif, could easily drink a lot more with a meal."
"Good, solid, but there are others I would revisit before this."
"This beer has been on my list for a few years. My wife picked up a bottle as a gift for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The beer pours a very cloudy, almost brownish-straw color. The liquid is really turbid, and the head is fizzy and then non-existent. Honestly, it's not an invitingly attractive brew. The smell, however, is very nice: Funky, musty, wet-straw and barnyard, grape skins, pale malt. Wonderful and complex aroma! The taste is solid...mouth-puckeringly sour, but also also balanced with a decent sweetness. The malt and grape-skin quality comes out a little more in the taste. There is a lot of fruitiness just underneath the tartness. Fresh and vibrant are great words for the beer."
"Very drinkable, feels warm and nice, it's a very good lambic, but, knowing what lies in Cantillon cellars, this one is not the top of tops..."
"Medium-light and slightly syrupy upfront with a light dryness in the end. Not like any other Cantillon beer I've had. Extremely easy to drink."
"This bottle is about a year old I'm guessing, maybe more. A mellow golden straw color, barely cloudy and traces of the slightest carbonation. Smells of lemon, hay fields, and wet funk. Sourness is there but very subdued and mellow, allowing lots of flavor to flood the senses. A tart apple and grapeskin main character, juicy citrus and rind, and a load of barn funk. Real nice and funky, wild. This is technically a fruit lambic and the white grape is surely there, but this is an awful lot like a nice gueuze, just mellower. The mouthfeel is so, so soft. Not bold and brash at all like some Cantillon can be, really unique in that way. I would love to see what a bit more age would do for this beer. A real standout even in the already top notch line of beers from Cantillon."
"pour is beautiful. lemon tea amber light but consistent bubbles that create a murky darkness of bubbles at first below the head. cloudier than most catillons. nose of melon, subtle sour apple (not at all forward), raspberry and white grape mineral with a funk of grassiness. cantulope and candied pineapple. all carrying over into the palate with a quality of sourness that blends into a strawberry citrus. woody bitterness. grassy floral, lavender, rosemary, and black currant finish. a light sweetness of chardonnay. fantastic. a pleasure to have."
"Quite the lambic, right here."
"Soft, slightly pillowy carbonation and light body."
"750mL bottle (corked and capped) bought for $19.99 at From the Vine in Columbus. It was hazy pale golden color with a thin white film. From the first whiff you know this will be sour, but in addition this has a lot of funky barnyard things going on a la Fantome. The taste is delicious but tart, lemon zest and pith with horse blanket, but most of all bitingly sour. I like it a lot, this is nearly flawless like all Cantillon beers. The mouthfeel is thin yet carbonated and effervescent. This is such a good beer, I think it's best summed up by LongBeachBum in terms of wine, this is Cantillon's ""white"" to the St.Lamvinus ""Red"". Absolutely recommended."
"Visiting the Cantillon brewery Jean Van Roy told me that he felt the Vigneronne to be even more complex and impressive than its red grape brother the St.Lamvinus. Although I personally would respectfully disagree with that, I do feel that both are not only examples of world-class craftsmanship and time-honed skill, but also artistic works of beauty."
"The smell is feint sour fruit. The taste is sharp and tart but pleasant. The dryness of the Italian Muscat grapes from which it was made comes through but with the tart funkiness typical, or so I'm lead to believe, of the lambic style. I've dabbled with a few lambics but none compares to this - superb clean tasting with a sourness and tartness that do not offend but attract the drinker to imbibe a bit more and a bit more ... and a bit more! When one thinks of a sour fruit, lemon naturally comes to mind, but this is more like a lemon meringue pie with a tasty deliciousness that is easy to savour yet hard to imitate. Yup, this is the real thing and until you've had it, it's hard to describe how unique it is and deserving of its' reputation. Thanks, Jan, and get your self back to Belgium soon, I dig sharing those souvenirs you bring back!"
"M&D: clean on the palate, the soft carbonation serves the tart profile extremely well, while the body is by far one of the best I've tasted for any Geuze/Lambic. For, not only it retains the integration well but also all the flavours (that I can detect) evolve just neatly and seamlessly within this ""agreed"" boundary... It's more acidic on the flavour than on the nose, and the white grapes have indeed rendered a higher level of sour fruitiness if I am not trying too hard to make sense of the influence. All in all, this is not something I would try often and ""get used to", lest the special characters might fall on my deaf ears (spoiled taste-buds actually) someday and not SO heavenly anymore!"
"Drinkability: While I am not a big fan of the style and struggle to consume this, I find this a very intriguing beer and look forward to my rare excursions into the world of lambics"
"D: Solid sour lambic. Really unique flavors and aromas -- a change from fruity sours. I would actually seek this out on occasion. Good brew."
"not thin at all. vinegary with acidic texture and trace of astringency in the finish. crisp, moderate but lively carbonation."
"Overall this is my first foray into Cantillon, and it ensures that I will try more. As long as you know what you're getting into this is well worth a shot."
"This is one of the more drinkable Cantillon beers I've had as the funk is not completely over-the-top in the taste. Very nice."
"Served at cellar temperature 52º into an Oerbier tulip glass. Crackling, hissy fizz at first, audible and acidic. After the initial sound, its completely still, though there are tiny bubbles slowly ascending. Glowing orange jewel toned orb in the light. Signature Cantillon lambic aroma, musty leather and citrus. Somehow softer than the classic Gueuze with light floral accents and a suggestion of honey. Moderate mellow tartness, some light hints of white grape, rhubarb, and oak. Dry in the finish. Citrus dominates, some low level sweet/tartness as well, pleasant oak aftertaste. Vigneronne is a subtle variant of the Cantillon Gueuze, slightly less acidic, but still moderately sour."
"On tap @ Ebenezer's. Poured into a wine glass. Clear yellowish with a creamy head. The smell was vinegar tartness with grape skins. The taste was bitter up front, but transitioned beautifully into a sweetness on the back of the tongue. Champagne mouthfeel. Tight, fizzy bubbles abounded. Drinkability was very nice. I would definitely drink a 750mL bottle of this no problem."
"Murky yellow color with very little head. Aroma was sour, similar to vinegar (surprise surprise), and had a bit of astringency similar to grape skins. Tasted like sour, dry, grape skins and a bit of other funk. Light body and very little carbonation. This beer was on tap at the Maduro. I think I like it better than my score indicates, but it is what it is."
"Drinkability is fairly high. it wasn't hard to finish the bottle between two people. Good, but not highly recommended. I'll stick to kriek or straight geuze."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"drinkability Pretty good."
"Tastes similar to a chardonnay or other heavy white wine with a bit of carbonation. Some more grape flavor as well as I drink. Again- a fabulous lambic fom them. I like the fact it is more wine like than the others I have tried."
"D: Not overly sweet but not as good as I was hoping. Worth a try but not much more than that. Other Cantillons are better for sure."
"Drinkablity is very good, this a very approachable lambic that is highly recommended for novices to the style. I would have liked more funk, but I assume this barrel isn't aged beyond the brewery."
"Overall, honestly, I wish i would have opened this up with a friend cuz i dont think i can drink all 25.4oz of, but it is still quite tasty. I wish i had some good cheese to cut on the acidity of this beer. I enjoy the flavor but strangely i enjoy the aftertaste a lot more. A pretty good lambic overall though."
"Other comments: The characteristic Cantillon sourness is turned up a notch from the grapes. Any sweetness from the grapes has long disappeared. I really need to try a younger bottle to see how it compares."
"D-I have become a real ""sucker"" for wild fermented sours in the past year or so. To find this on tap is a true treat. Nicely done! Cantillon is a truly world class brewery...can they do any wrong?"
"Taste & mouthfeel - Lemon juice, vinegar and white wine. Mellow sourness and considerably less funk than the nose presents. Hints of vanilla and muscat grapes. Light-bodied with medium acidity. Very nicely balanced - this is one of the most drinkable Cantillon beers I've tried, though the vinegar-like flavor is slightly stronger than I'd like."
"Pours a clear amber, thin white head forms, settles down to a big bubbled ring around the glass, no lacing. Smell is awesome, socks and barnyard, very acidic, lemony, oak, intense sourness, honey and wheat, white grapes, very complex. Taste is intense, charred oak, lemon, wood, honey, grass, sweet and sour middle, some light fruits, grapes, barnyard funk and acidic finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, medium carbonation. Very smooth and definitely interesting. Apparently the white grape brother to Saint Lam, both are excellent! Thanks Jan!"
"Drinkability/overall: Tamer than expected from Cantillon, but an interesting beer/wine hybrid nonetheless. Try it while it lasts."
"Update: April 2008...after a little more than a month in the barrel this beer has developed a subtle carbonation improves drinkability and in some ways appearance. The acidity seems softened by it."
"D - I love this stuff. The addicting sour cheek-pulling tartness is like crack. I wouldn't want to drink this all night during a serious session, but I can't think of a more wonderful ber to sip during this wonderfully warm spring-like January weather we are having. After a Sunday spent with my fiance tooling around the countryside in the Miata....this is the perfect brew to end a gloriously warm and bright day."
"drinkability is great. not overly acidic. nice level of funk. great balanced. this holds up well against its sister beer, st lamvimus. you can definitely tell they're related, but each stands well on its own."
"Drinkability- As Cantillon is not for everyone, I would expect this drinkability to be much less for others, but for me this is amazingly drinkable and thus far is my favourite of all the Cantillon's."
"This is a unique, refreshing brew. Interesting use of muscat grapes. Though I don't normally seek grapes in my beer (and prefer this brewery's St. Lamvinus), they do blend nicely into the house yeast strain and the malt that is used. It is a gueuze-like lambic that fits in nicely with the ""unique treat"" category."
"Review added 10-27-2007, translated from french 1-31-2008."
"Golden colored brew, tiny white head on top, no lace. The sides of the glass are coated with tiny carbonation bubbles. The scent is pretty sour, almost like a wine scent. Not too strong. The taste is lip puckeringly sour, very active on the tounge. Grapes stand out as the main taste, very tart, quite a dry finish. Pretty thin mouth. Overall, probably what you would expect: a wine-like beer, amazingly active in the mouth, and quite a tasty treat."
"Comment: I am not a fan of Lambic brews and this did not win me over. Its great to try something different but I doubt I'll develop a taste for this brew or its co-habitants in the land of lambic."
"Shows a slightly ruddy golden/amber hue with exciting aromas of melon rind, burnt rubber, spice and citrus notes. On the palate it shows an aggressive, lively lime citrus, quinine, and herbaceous flavor that turns a bit astringent, but should appeal to any fan of gin and tonic, mojito, or pouilly fume. Serve as an aperitif, with grilled fish or chicken kebabs. Interesting, refreshing and worth a try, but perhaps a bit pricey."
"Pours out a honey color with a thinnish head and slow moving bubbles that crawl towards the surface. Smells like a really good geuze that leans towards a softer edge, much like something from Boon. I'm really trying to get some grapes, and if I strain, I can pick up a faint dryish white wine in the back, but that could be my imagination. This one is really lemony in the flavor and stands out above any really intense funk. Something that stands out is what I'm identifying as a faint fennel character in the background. When I think about it, I get this in some other lambics but have not been able to place it. Acidity isn't too harsh here and is rounded out by a little sweetness. Finishes dry. Any grape character I get comes at the very finish and echoes on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light, but feels more subdued than other lambics I'm used to. The mild sweetness that rounds this out makes this a pretty easy drinkaer while still maintaining interesting characteristics."
"little head, cloudy apple juice, light orangey; typical sour lambic scent; white grape juice; katsupy attributes (not in a bad way) although not so sugary - reminds me of flanders red ale; brings out the goat in goat cheese; sour, fizzy carb which i like; very drinkable, although not much difference from a plain lambic"
"Definitely a treat to have this on-tap, and even more enjoyable to drink it outside in the beer garden at a world class bar."
"Drinkability: This is pretty easy going because it doesn't have strange tastes going on and no repulsive smells that are available in certain other lambics. A good lambic to get more lambic experience with."
"Thanks to the Beer Guy at McKean and Charles in Waldoboro for getting this (and then saving it a few weks until I could get up there). This was a 750ml bottle, bottled 30Oct06, and was served in a tulip glass. Nice orange color with a tiny head that dissipates quickly. Very still. It had the aroma of peaches. The taste was sour fruit, and was very acidic. Quite a dry beer, and quite enjoyable. Share it with a friend and pucker up."
"2004. Pours a glowing orange tinted yellow. Really beautiful, almost ethereal. Head fizzes and dissipates. Smell is funk, must, tartness. Taste is highly acidic with ripe tartness and everything else that went with the smell. Fairly dry body until the finish where some sweet sugar comes in and balances it out. Great carbonation on this one. Real light and easy to go. Would have enjoyed this more if I split it with someone else because the acidity is so high."
"Pours cloudy and opaque gold color like an unfiltered apple cider. A fizzy bleached white head foams up 1 cm and fades to an edge layer. Aroma is some bready yeast, lactic tartness, general funk and must and some lite fruitiness. First sip reveals a lite body with smooth texture and very fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is grainy and yeasty up front and is quickly dominated by tart fruit and alctic sourness. VERY funky and drinkable but I get some acid reflux as we finish the 750. Definitely not an everybody beer, but I enjoyed the experience. just warn folks that this is a puckering experience."
"I like it for those moments when only sour will do."
"Drinkability- Probably my favorite of the line to date. Seemed the easiest to suck down without burning a hole in my stomach lining. Muscat grapes work well in lambics apparently."
"Drinkability: definitely down a few notches as the sourness tires the the tongue by the end of the glass. But the flavors are interesting and unique. Worth giving this a try if you like extremes."
"Matt"
"D - Again, it's not my forte, so it's hard for me to be completely unbiased...haven't had many from this style, but it definitely fits. It seems like much more of an acquired taste than I am used to."
"D: The drinkability is limited by my general dislike for the style. It packs a punch and makes you regret/anticipate each sip."
"This is my favorite of the Cantillon offerings I've had so far. Another excellent lambic out of this wonderful brewery. I am becoming more and more amazed with every Cantillon I have. This is another one to be savored. If you like your beers sour, this one is for you. Go in with an open mind, and lets you senses get abused. Worth every penny of the $14.99."
"Easy to drink, but I think 1 or 2 is the limit here. This is a beer to savour and enjoy all the fruity sour goodness. If you're looking for a chugging beer, this is not it."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The beer is lightly carbonated. The beer is very tart and acidic. Both the tartness and the acidity help create an oddly refreshing beer drinking experience. This beer is not for every beer drinker. If you dont like sour beers look else where."
"Enjoyable, unique, authentic and mysterious."
"This beer departs an unfortunately corked bottle (pour horizontal storage?) into my wine glass. Aromas and initial flavors hint that it's still in fine shape (besides it's too sour to show any infections or other flaws). Super cloudy, straw yellow/orange, bubbly and a small head. I've come to learn the aroma of a Cantillon is just amazing, this one displaying some solvent, hay, sourness, and a touch of fruit, though I can't decide what. The flavor hits you as intense sourness, a bit of the wheat is detected. And, as their website notes that use a small amount of aged hops, so they go unoticed. As I hit my next glass of it, the grapes come into play and it's clear this is very much a sparkling wine like experience. Went well with a Frenchie leek and mushroom quiche. Can't wait to try the ""rare"" St. Lamvinus."
"D - Not that easy to stomach. I would recommend sharing a 750 ml bottle with at least two other friends because though it is a good brew, it is just so sour that it really takes it toll with one or two glasses."
"Overall: There's a very nice interplay between fruit, sourness and funk in this beer. Lambics are fast becoming one of my favorite styles."
"Mouthfull is flat and muted, not much of a hint from the carbonation. I like it for this style though."
"This is a stellar beer. While I couldnt detect the Muscat grapes, the extra funk more than made up for it. Try this beer if you like Cantillon."
"Rather clear, a bright burnished gold color. A small puff of white foam fizzes away like soda, leaving only a thin collar covering the beer, which quickly dies away. Funky, funky aroma. Sour, with a grapey tartness. Moldy, basement funkiness nearly gives the effect of mint. Very strange, but that's the scent that lingers in my nose. A bit cheesy, but mostly a winey grape tartness. Puckering sourness starts things off, making my eyes water a bit. I haven't had Cantillon in a while! The sourness makes my lips tingle a bit. Moldy, farmy funk reminds me of wet hay and stilton cheese, giving in to a slight medicinal sharpness and strong, grapey sourness busting through the finish. Distinct crabapple, with a citrusy hue. A slight bit of alcohol, maybe. Definitely a lingering brettanomyces character. Yeee-owch! Fairly light bodied, with sparkling, champagne-like carbonation. Very dry on the palate all the way through, finishing almost papery. Another winner from this antique brewery."
"Taste is pucker-sour, a real eye-opener. this may be the most acidic and astringent of their products that I have tried, or maybe my memory is bad. In any event a very refreshing( almost painfully so ) lambic and just the thing if you want to be soured to the max. Lacks some of the complexity of some other cantillon products, even unblended lambics."
"Taste: Acidity is a much more tame than the Foufoune that blew me away minutes before, it still had that great musty Cantillon flavor, the usual lively carbonation was a bit more subdued, odd since this bottle is relatively young. Aftertaste was also a little less intense, not as drying. A great Beer for sure, just not at the level of some of the others, IMHO."
"Cloudy straw color some white head but mostly just bubble sitting on top. Funky but fruity and I really like way it gets my mouth anticipating the sour brett. As always the first sip is a wake-up call to the tongue. This is enjoyable but becomes more rewarding with each sip. White grape juice and a hint of sulfur in the kick help round out the sourness. Nice and light in the mouth and ever refreshing."
"750 ml bottle, corked and capped. According to the cork, this bottle is from 2003. This beer pours out a bright yellowish orange color with no head, although there appears to be some carbonation present. The aroma is grapes, oak, and horse blanket. This beer sure doesn't lack for funkiness. The aroma changes from minute to minute, more so than just about any beer I've ever tried. Shake your glass gently, take a deep whiff, and the aroma will jump out and bite your head off. The flavor is sour, though it doesn't have the vinegar flavor of many other lambics. The grapes impart a tasty fruitiness. Some oak flavor. Finishes very dry with a pungent bite. This one will burn a hole in your belly, but you just can't stop sipping. There is more carbonation than it appears. Great drinkability. This reminds me why I love beer."
"This one's a hazy copper in appearance, with a thin, wispy white head. The aroma is lip puckering at arm's length. The flavor, too, is incredibly tart, a bit sweet mid-palate with hints of grape-skin, vinegar, and oak. Very, very dry in the finish. Let this one sit a while, if you can, as it develops some nice funky, earthier cork and barnyard notes as it warms."
"Opinion: I just love these beer styles, but I am in a sad state...literally, Texas doesn't sell any of them. This beer is particularly easy to drink, and if I were in Belgium, I am sure that I would have reordered at least one. Perhaps the drinkability came from the fact that it was five years old. Still a beautiful beer!"
"Notes: Very interesting how the taste of this beer progressed. Very sour and funky, then sweet malt, then dry with a throat burning sensation."
"I liked it, yes, I'm just a fan of other styles. BUT, there's still plenty of cantillons for me to try, and there's not one that I wouldn't have again."
"love the almond hints that this lambic leaves with warmth.. overall a very special brew."
"Drinkability: Bracing and invigorating, supremely complex. A classic Lambic that is a genuine work of the brewer's art. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light and airy with a good flow of bubbles throughout. Lovely mouth puckering goodness. A 750ml bottle that is very enjoyable when shared with a friend, as the whole bottle may be a bit much. A wonderful taste exeperience overall that shouldn't be missed...thanks to marburg for this one."
"Poured a golden yellow color with no head nd rather still. The nose was intense. Super funkey, insane sour, acrid, pungent. The closest I can recall is when I worked at a zoo (yes, I really did) and had to clean the donkey stalls. That was the ost acrid smell I have ever encountered. This beer was very close. Wow. Just wow. The flavor was wesome. First, it pulled all moisture from my mouth. The sourness was intense, but not puckering. I got a small hint of hte vinous grape nd grape rind. It was an intense flavor, but not lingering and offensive. It finished a bit grainey even. Just beautiful. The feel was moderate with a very light carbonation. Drinkability was as good as it gets. I thought it was going to kick my ass whe I first smelled it, but the flavor was very refined and mellow. Everything was in harmony. Awesome beer. Don, you are a champ."
"The taste is slightly sweeter than their other beers thanks to the muscat grapes. The grapes add perfect balance to this beer. People always add weird tastes to this line of beers so here is mine. A bit grainy like cereal with hints of wheat and oats. I believe most of their beers are dry hopped. I never really pick up any of the hop notes in their beers. The sourness seems to dominate. A spectacular beer!"
"Drinkability and Overall: This is easily the best lambic I've ever had. It's absolutely brilliant. The grape flavor is so real and so damn tasty. I'm in love with this beer, and I wish I could drink it all night. One of the best."
"Pours a spritzy orange with a nice rocky head that really didnt leave much lace at all,whoa the funk like sitting in a barn with this bad boy I also picked up some oak and vanilla but the funk was hard core,My mouth is still puckering from this stuff full tilt sour and musty like intensly concentrated lemon pith and a wet basement.Not my cup of tea this will be my last foray into Cantillon brews this one is most intense in my opinion."
"A byoot."
"Reasonably full white head, bubbly brew. Quite literally, this beer is cloudy -- lots of fluffy pockets of yeast and/or other sediment are drifting throughout this mazie/orange beer. Orange peel, green grapes, vanilla-less oak, and nasty barnyard funk are all notable undertones to a dominant sourness. Mouth-puckering goodness is defined by some orange and other citrus flavors as well as the typical Cantillon lactic acidity. Some brief hints of more refined sourness with very clear citrus flavors. The orange really pops and keeps coming to mind. Addictive like crack; I need more."
"This lambic poured a hazy, peach color with light white foam. The smell was a wonderful lambic aroma with an explosion of tartness and some vinous and very musty smells greeting ones nostrils. The taste was tart and musty with notes of grapes (vinous) and typical ""wild"" lambic flavors. The mouthfeel was crisp and sharp and tart and acerbic with medium body and strong carbonation. This was an excellent lambic, and one of the best from Cantillon that I have sampled."
"Very nice, and enjoyed with several fellow BAs on the last bus trip (Cellerman, Uncle Jimbo, and my better half, David). This is the one made with muscat grapes I believe. Cloudy goldenrod when poured. I thought the aroma was of light barnyard...in my minds eye I see fresh straw and sawdust ;-) Anyway, this one is very juicy, very fruity, but I still experienced some acetic qualities (grapeskin?). Probably will not be my favorite Cantillon, but I am glad I got to try it and share it with some great BAs at the Moan and Dove."
"Golden crystal peach color with a slight white ring after the brew settles in the goblet. I brought this baby back from my trip to Belgium. Not much of a detectable nose. Slight bitterness upfront with a white grape sweetness. Very linear tasting. The dryness of the finish balences the sweetness upfront. Quite dry overall. A great beer to start the night with. White grapes are the dominant trait. Flatish mouth. A nice apartif.."
"Well-balanced level of carbonation provides an excellent mouthfeel. Great drinkability, and fantastic with food."
"Definitely no ""sour grapes"" here. Hahaha...."
"Yee-oww, that stung! I enjoyed it in an almost masochistic way, as each taste made my eyes water and face contort. If you like big-time sour with your beer, Cantillon really knows how to brew it up."
"Muscat grapes mixed with unblended lambic...I like it!"
"750ml corked and capped. No freshness date Pours a clear and initially sparkling gold that quieted down quickly leaving no head and a few tiny bubbles behind. Aroma is yeasty and fruity with grapes in the mix as well as a musty cellar funk. Mouthfeel is highly effervescent and crisp with a tart and dry finish. Flavor is sour and tart like a wine cooler with grapes providing most of the flavor. Not the best Lambic but not a drain pour either."
"A murky peach coloured brew with golden yellow and orangey highlights. The aroma is more subdued than a typical lambic offering from Cantillon. The aroma consists of the white muscat grapes and the sweet sugars that they have let off. There is also a peach like frutiness amongst the mustiness and barnyard like traditional lambic aromas that are also prevalent in this brew. Finally a bit of sweet honey ties all of the flavors together and make this one extremely complex and interesting brew. The taste follows suit on the aroma. The traditional lambic funkiness and sweet and sour tartness are there, but there is also so much more going on in the mix. The clover honey, and white grape flavors explode on the tongue, and I can even taste a bit of other fruits (perhaps peaches and apricots) in the mix as well. The mouthfeel is extremely effervescent, astringent, sweet, sour and excellent and the drinkability is classic Cantillon excellence as well! What else can I say, that has not already been said. Another achingly original and traditional offering for Van-Roy and Cantillon...the true lambic masters! I found this to be best served at around 55* F!"
"750ml bottle. Poured a cloudy dark amber with no head to speak of, but lots of fine bubbles rising to the surface. This is my first experience with a Cantillon lambic. Aroma is musty like a old wet blanket. As it sits a lemony citus aroma comes through. The first sip brings in the ol pucker factor. As you continue drinking you can begin to make out the muscat grapes hiding in there. As it warms the sourness seems to intensify. Very Very good!"
"It truly is a fucked up World. Go Figure!?!"
"I'm at a loss for words really, giving any kind of numbers was an impossible task, with the exception of the smell which gets an instant 5 for its disgusting charm."
"Hazed golden peach color, finding its way to a murky cider hue after the fizzy white head quickly fades. Oaky, vanilla notes play second fiddle to grassy, citrus notes and the ubiquitous musty, acidic nose that is distinctly Cantillon. Tart lemon and citrus flavor is most dominant, though the sugars from the Muscat grapes play a minor role around mid-bottle, creating a mildly sweet-and-sour effect. The sour notes, however, are most evident. Light-to-medium bodied with medium carbonation and a lightly effervescent mouthfeel. Very refreshing and drinkable. Overall, I can't say I detected too much of the Muscat grapes except for perhaps a little of their inherent sugars along the way. Not my favorite of all the Cantillon lambics (that's not saying too much, as I adore this brewery), but still a top-notch creation as would be expected."
"As I pull the cork I get a strong smell of vinegar, this aroma seems to be attached to the cork and does not carry over to the beer. It is a cloudy orange color, and though well carbonated, it is not beery enough to hold a head for any length of time. A sour musty aroma emanates from my glass, notes of citrus as well. The taste is predominantly a lemony sourness. Definitely wine like in some ways (especially the body), but it is hard to say of this is from the Muscat grapes. There is a definite funky Lambic character here; musty, astringent, and acidic. Hard to say what grape character is here, it seems a bit lighter in body and there is a definite lack of heading proteins, perhaps a hint of the Muscat is in the acidic finish, but it is hard to say. As the beer warms up I get some cider notes as well, though it is still quite lemony. As a fruit beer it lacks the fruit character it should have (perhaps younger versions have more Muscat character). As a well carbonated Lambic type beer though, it works and is quite good."
"Pours with a fizz. A small ivory white head forms atop the hazy light golden body. It fizzles away quickly leaving a miniscule collar. Carbonation looks to be vigorous from appearance. Aroma is quite funky. Love that funky lambic smell. Like a horse stall at the State Fair. But in a good way. There's also lemony, grassy tones on the nose. And just a tad of sweet fruit as well. When the beer hits my tongue, I don't pucker nearly as much as I was expecting. The acidity and tartness seem a bit lower than your typical Cantillon offering, but they ARE there. And quite enjoyable. Funky yeast tastes mingle with musty overatures. Barnyard, Horse Blanket, lemongrass, acetic acid...damn enjoyable. Mouthfeel is lively. Burps burn my nostrils. This is a great sour beer."

"Incredible flavours, Incredible experience. I honestly didn't think I was going to be able to drink this at first - but it just became more and more interesting to me. This is a seriously challenging beer. But it's worth the effort to experience something as totally different as this is."
"The beer is a slightly hazy gold. The smell is quite complex, with notes of apple, wet hay, and the muscatel grapes used in brewing, but the smell only hints at the tartness encountered in the taste. The first sip immediately causes the mouth to pucker. It is so dry that it almost seems to disappear immediately upon hitting the tongue. This one is certainly interesting enough to encourage me to continue in my gueuze education."
"The color a bright orange, the head miniscule and what there is of it vanishes in the blink of an eye, the lace non-existent. Sweet and sour nose, extremely ripe pineapple maybe, musty like and old barn, or a vintage wine cellar for that fact, but not totally without merit this nose. Start is immediately tart with a fruit like sweetness and the top slim in is feel, the acidity stinging, the tartness more than I expected, the aftertaste devastatingly dry."
"Pretty interesting stuff, hazy, gold/orange/hay colour, barnyard nose, including hay, horse crap, dust, with a slight hint of grapeskin. Slight sweet tart start, with that classic Cantillon sourness, hints of grapeskins, you can taste the barrel in which it fermenst aswell, very earthy flavour, pretty darn good."
