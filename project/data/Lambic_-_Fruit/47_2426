3.64,2.2,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"this is still really well made cherry beer, but it isnt my favorite that they do. its still seemingly immature, sweet from the fruit rather than puckery from the lambic, but the freshness and authenticity of the fruit make it a worthy drink for me, and there still is a sturdy hit if funk mid palate, even though the sourness of the lambics we love the most doesnt really even show up. the cherries are ripe and juicy, not medicinal at all, although they crowd out any malt flavor for most o the drink. carbonation is fair, but the sweetness of the fruit makes this a beer i only need a little of, more of a cordial at this level than a beer, but you cant help but be impressed by the vibrancy of the cherries, and with the texture of the beer overall. its obviously a quality brew, but i think more time, less fruit, more lacto character, and a little more carbonation would really make this special. still, anytime you get good belgian kriek, you dont complain.","StonedTrippin","Oct 20, 2014"

A hint of woody oak and a brief whiff of barnyard. Taste is sweet and ripe fruit that has a modicum of tartness on it in and of itself. The barnyard is not very prominent on the palate. The wood is airy and light. The carbonation is almost right but could stand a few more bubbles. The malt is a but a touch of crisp wheat and a hint of weight on the palate. The beer is dry. What it isn't - is sour or acidic. It lacks that boldness and it is sorely missed. While the fruit is lovely it just does not engage the palate fully without that aspect. It drinks easily and a bit too easily .","utopiajane","Aug 11, 2014"

Hints of tart lemon, balsamic, brown sugar, and earth round out the nose. The flavor is quite a bit sweeter than I was anticipating. Dark sugary sweet with plenty of tart and sweet cherry flavor but seriously lacking in much lactic tartness to offset the sweetness. Hints of almond flavor and a bit of earthiness round out the flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation.

When first poured, if I didn't know it was a beer I would have guessed I was served carbonated black tart cherry juice. As it warmed up and rested a bit, I could tell some other flavors were trying to get out from under the cherry, like the bitterness at the end which I thought was a hint of a spicy/earthy hop, but it was so hard to pull out I'm thinking it was my imagination. Great appearance, good aroma, but just okay in everything else. As for drinkability - when paired with food it's a nice drink (went well with chocolate pudding, I suspect it would be even better with chocolate cake) but by itself it's just okay as a sipper.","damndirtyape","Apr 22, 2012"

Then, near the finish, a very light (but still noticeable) tartness creeps in for a brief appearance, bringing in a small currant flavor.

The apple core bitterness that I am picking up is also a little off-putting within the overall flavor profile.

The kriek was a clear garnet in color with a fine pink cap that lasted but left little lacing. The beer smelled and tasted very bright from sour cherries. The beer was not too sweet but nicely balanced with enough tartness. Overall, the expression of the wild character was limited, the amount of fruit flavor had that effect on the beer and it appeared that the beer was not bottled conditioned which can definitely help the bugs do more work.

As expected cherry dominates the palate as well. There are hints of vinousness and a general red fruitiness but this isn't particularly depthful. Still, the sweet/tart character of the cherries mixed with the sourness of the lambic, which also dries the beer a little, makes this a very balanced and pleasant beer - as cherry beers go especially.

I'm afraid I can't even take this beer seriously. Double pity. However, on a few sips, the late finish reveals some funky tartness not explained by the cherry. It must be the lambic poking through after all. But it's only on random infrequent sips. Triple pity. My final revelation is the taste of cherry soda mingled with the smoke of fireworks.

Those of you looking for the sour face puckering taste of a geuze or cantillon type brew, do not buy this. This is full of cherry flavor and goes down like fruit juice. just the right amount of carbonation helps. sharp cherry flavor in the finish. mouthfeel is perfect, could drink this for a week straight. I wouldn't recommend doing that though, as It would probably cause on wicked hangover from the sugar. That would be the fructose that sticks to your lips. Great brew.

Tastewise, It should be figured out by now that I think the sugar (?) overpowers the Kriek more than it should. The cherry is evident, just not as to the fore as would be nice.

Cherry and some other dark rich berries. Fresh and clean, not musty. Flavor: nice crisp clean fruit with a gentle moderate soourness of lambic. not as intense as some, which improves drinkability.

Taste affirms this, as expected. Big notes of acidity, sour cherries, and some residual sugar reside in the taste department. An excellent balance of sweet and sour, acidic and tart flavors. Effervescent mouthfeel keeps things interesting along the way. Serving this chilled in the summertime would be a wise idea, as its thirst-quenching qualities are endless.

It might turn some beer lovers off, but the sourness of cherries are in my opinion an excellent choice for an addition of the lambic style.

Very slight candied flavors are present if you look hard enough.  Nicely carbonated mouthfeel.  This is one of those beers that beckons another sip from you even though it is fairly tart.

The expected sweet cherry aroma is followed by a more complex tartness and slight hint of wet horse - like Brettanomyces.  The flavor is very sweet overall, but has more complexity when compared to the ubiquitous and cloyingly sweet Lindeman's Lambics. The cherry flavor is prominent, but subtle green apple acetaldehyde and welcome contributions from lactic acid bacteria add a pleasant tartness.  The taste grows on me as I begin to discern the understated complexities of the overall tartness...  The sweetness gives way to a pleasant, crisp and dry finish w/ lingering cherry flavors.  This is certainly a tasty Lambic-- the flavor is skewed towards sweetness, but there's enough overall complexity and lightness to make it quite drinkable.  Boon Kriek is unique and definitely worth trying, but doesn't seem to be a showstopper.","marc77","Jun 20, 2002"
