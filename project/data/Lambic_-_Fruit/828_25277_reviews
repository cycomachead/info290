"Big rich raspberry nose with a touch of tartness, light lemon and a slight funk. It pours brilliant reddish brown with a thin whisp of a head.  The palate is exquisite with just the right amount of lemony tartness with just a hint of sweetness in the back. The story here is deep, dry, raspberry flavors as raspberry as it is possible to get with traces of malt and wheat in the background. Light body with medium high carbonation. Nothing cloying or over sweet. Grab a bottle of this, a baguette, some smelly cheese and sit in the park all day and watch the roller skaters."

"Incredibly easy to drink and super refreshing Fruit Lambic. Not with a heavy tartness or funky complex. Don't try to compare it to a Gambrinus. I could have several of those."

"Drinkability – Goes down easy, though I find the bitterness a bit off-putting."

"Its simply not my cup of tea tried it on tap and it was just too fruity"

"The perfect balance of cherry and raspberry flavors"

"fortunate enough to have this one on draft. a really great beer all up, enormously better than their base kriek i think. the fruit is less medicinal, and the lambic base comes through more. i see more grain, more sourness, and a better mouthfeel that isnt so weighted down by fruit sugars. the raspberry nose is robust, and the flavor is just as true. a little tart, a lot summery, and all fruit on the finish. clear in color, way more clear than the kriek, with a brilliant ruby red as its base, but not a whole lot of head. i smell what i taste, and im fine with that, although this is nowhere near as dynamic or compelling as the best framboise on the market. i do think its a step up from the elementary kriek in its fruit authenticity and its dryness, which is only medium, but way less sweet than the cherry. i also think its more drinkable for the same reason. again, nowhere near as good as some of the more mature beers they do, oude kriek for example, but awfully good and a darn good presentation of what raspberry can do in a simple base beer."

"Overall : a good beer in the Belgian style Lambic"
""

""

"This pours a clear red persimmon color. There’s a slight funk, and a green apple note (a positive one) atop a raspberry aroma. On the palate I get raspberry raspberry raspberry… Lots of flavored raspberries with a touch of the green apple. Decent enough."

"Loving how this beer came together, it simply lacks the depth of earth, dryness and aged complexities that great fruit Lambics offer. It's a flawless beer for its age, but its still a pup of a beer."
""

""

"While tasty, and mostly easy to drink, with a heady amount of veritable raspberry goodness, the overall complexity seems just a tad lacking. This is just in relation to other versions of the style, and meant solely as constructive criticism - always room to improve, no?"

"Pours a clear, red color. 1/4 inch head of a pink color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of raspberries, sugar, sweet malt, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Lambic - Fruit. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of strong raspberries, sugar, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of earthy malt. Overall, good strong raspberry flavor, but the high sugariness is unfortunate."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep pink color lambic with a medium light pink head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma consists of fresh raspberries with lightly sweet undertone. Taste is very refreshing with taste of fresh raspberries with light tart notes. Lambic is not present but not overly dominant as presence of raspberries is huge. Body is about average with good carbonation. Very nice drink with huge refreshing notes."

"Overall- Maybe it's because I drank a Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus the other night, but this raspberry lambic is lacking in taste and mouthfeel of a traditional lambic. Tasty, but I won't buy it again when there are better lambics out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad. The bitter is a bit off-putting, but still pretty decent."
"Poured a orchid-amber color, hazy, with a small bubbly head that mostly dissipated, initially leaving a few specks of lace on the glass. Aroma of raspberry candy, and a pleasantly mild must. More of the same in the taste, raspberry candy, a little sweet, a little tart, crackery malts, slightly musty, with a bit of a woody/earthy element, overall providing a rather dry finish. Light-medium body, ample carbonation, easily drinkable, but not something I'd want more than one serving of in a session."

"Between the Framboise and the Kriek, these are great drinkable Lambics to try. On tap at the recently-opened Fathom in San Diego."

"O: Overall good, but not something amazing. The cranberry like flavor is interesting, but adds an odd feel to it."
""
"The feel was too thin and, while the style is light, didn't have much keeping it interesting. Crispness is consistent enough but low, just enough to keep it from unpleasant."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured ruby red with a two finger very light pink head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, sugar, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, raspberry, sugar, and subtle funk. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I have had this one multiple times in the bottle and couldn’t pass it up on tap. I definitely did not make a mistake here. Unfortunately, this one didn’t shine as the last bottle that I had. All of the right flavors were there, but they just weren’t as intense as I remembered the bottle being. The mouthfeel was a little light on the carbonation aspect compared to what I enjoyed about this out of the bottle. Still an absolute must try regardless of serving type."
"A decent example of a fruit lambic/framboise. Lacking in the way the fruit is presented. Two ways to go with it, if you ask me. Tart raspberry with a whole lot of pucker or fresh raspberry with some pleasant fructose sweetness. This one halved each category, and almost pulled it off. Would pick up again."

"Overall. Really refreshing and easy drinking. I could drink this all day long during the summer heat."

""

"O – I really enjoyed this beer, even after the not so appealing appearance. Very nice tartness, and the raspberry flavor was perfect."
"Pours a dark pink color with a short white head and just a few spots of lacing on the way down. Thin collar. The nose carries fresh raspberries along with a bit of earthy must and just a touch of acidity. The flavor is predominantly raspberries, but also has a slight medicinal quality. Body is light and dry with some medicinal character. Very light acidity. Could be a good starter lambic."
"O: I think I see the appeal of this beer even though its not my personal favorite style. Seemed to hit the fruit notes and add a bit of malt and sourness for intrigue. I wish it were less sour and the juicy berries were allowed to flow more."
"Overall: This is probably the most wine-like beer I have had to date. Still, the fingerprints of Lambic are all over this one. Its the type of beer that should make fans of sweet beers, beer geeks, and sour fiends all start clamoring to get their wine glasses. Better than most."
""
"Body is medium-light to medium, with noticeable but not aggressive carbonation. Pleasant, excellent for sipping and trying to discern the flavors. Finish is dry."
""
""
""
"On tap at ChurchKey poured in a sampler glass. Pours a reddish color with a pink head. Aroma is of tart raspberries, yogurt notes, light funk, some musty old aromas and subtle wood and vinegar. The flavor follows the nose, lightly sour with lots of raspberry and almost raspberry yogurt like flavor, some subtle funk like hay and some musty old notes with the vinegar. The body is light with a dry mouthfeel."
""
"Dark red nearing purple. Pink head. Smells of fresh raspberries and new pool toys. Funk is rather subdued. The flavors are mostly raspberry syrup and a bit of funk. Sweet with very little sour punch. Medium body with mild carbonation. Certainly not the worst framboise out there but I've had much better."
""
""
"Medium bodied, ditto for the carbonation; a nice mouthfeel and it's easy enough to drink. I'm glad I tried it but a repeat isn't necessary."
""
""
"Highly carbonated mouthfeel is nice, but I just can't get over the sweetness. Can't pull any oak out of this one."
"An impressive lambic, though at least for my palate, a bit less sour funk and a touch more fruit would have been appreciated."
"O - A good framboise. Definitely in the middle of the sweet/tart spectrum compared to others of the style. While it didn't blow me away, I could see revisiting this one in the future."
"O – Not my cup of tea, and I have had much better Framboise that have stronger beer characteristics. However, if you are looking for a raspberry champagne for New Years, you could do a lot worse."
""
"D-Pretty easy drinking and not too sour for those beginning to experiment with sour beers. Very approachable and nuanced beer."
""

"Overall: Raspberry sours are among my favorite style and fruit treatment, but this one was just done with a flavor that is a little too casual for my liking. Simply sweet, there is just not a ton of complexity here to ever pique my interest."
"Overall: I thought there was an odd taste in the finish of this one. I don't think I would have another."
"Very red pour with a huge pink head. The lacing and retention are phenomenal. Very sweat aroma, no funk or acidity. Tart raspberries and fruits take it over. The taste is of sweet, dry raspberries. Not particularly funky, the beer still steers clear of the ""fruit juice"" moniker sometimes placed on sweeter lambics. Dry finish, strange aftertaste. Tart and carbonated well. It was very sweet, but not on the level of Timmermans thankfully. I enjoyed it."
"3.5 D: Decent beer, but not as complex or as fruity as I'd like for a young framboise."
"O - This was the worst of the three. The fruit was really only present in the taste and even there it was a bit dull. Add to that the disappointing nose and this one really isn't on par with its counterparts."
"O: like a delicious raspberry soda with a dash of malt drink that is highly sessionable. I think I ordered three of them."
"The raspberries did come out well, not too sweet and stuffy, the sourness of the lambic saves the brew and makes it refreshing."
"Raspberry preserves are prevalent in the nose. Light tart notes keep things interesting. Very tasty stuff. A good balance of sweet and tart raspberry flavors. Midswallow, a burst of carbonation helps keep the palate refreshed. A bit musty, a bit earthy. An approachable, reasonably complex lambic. Definitely worth a try."
"I love this framboise. Very drinkable- One that doesn't require a notepad and a 10-way pour to enjoy. It's one I revisit often."
"O: This is the first Framboise I've rewieved on BA; this one is nice like most products from Oud Beersel. The raspberries balanced the brett in a nice way."
"O- This is the first lambic I have not loved. This is not bad, but not the price. I was hoping for a solid lambic and got something that tasted like an ok fruit beer. If I wanted something that tasted like this I would buy more American fruit beers."
"Overall I think this one is a bit too sweet for my tastes I'll have to grab something else in this style."
"Taste is light woody-funky yeastiness with faintly sweet-tart raspberry, dryish with a lingering gentle funky character at the end plus light woodiness and light sourness. It is very nice."
"Best before 6/3/12. This beer pours a dark, dark brownish purple in color with a two finger, bubble bath like white head. There were also chunks of sediment in the pour and they dispersed along the bottom of my Founders snifter. The aromas are surprisingly of very fresh raspberries or a raspberry dessert. I expected them to be muted but they're actually quite pungent and feature both a nice sweetness and nice tart aspect. The flavors begin sweet before fading into a light raspberry tart. The finish is kind of strange, which could be from the sediment. It tastes kind of yeasty and bitter on the finish. It's almost like the flavor you get when you bite into raspberry seeds. It drinks fine and isn't overly sweet or tart. I can see why some people wouldn't like this and I can see why some people would. It's almost right in between sweet and sour framboise. I guess it depends on your preference. Overall, a pretty decent beer in my opinion."
"Pours a very dark semi-opaque crimson red with a small 1/2 inch light red head that fades to a small cap. Random fingers of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is intense raspberry, other mixed berries (blueberry comes out), with only a slight funk/must smell. Taste is very similar to the nose with an intense berry flavor blast (mainly raspberry, other berries too) up front with only a slight bit of sour lambic coming through on the finish. A bit of fruit rind/stem bitterness after each sip. Carbonation level is somewhat high which makes for a crisp soda like mouthfeel. The beer leaves the palate a bit sticky after each sip, again like a soda. Overall, this is a fantastic raspberry lambic that is quite different from ones I have had in the past. A very tasty treat."
"The mouthfeel feel is medium bodied with carbonation being lower for the style. Overall it was a pretty good beer. It really reminded me of my moms raspberry pie, which is a good thing. The fresh raspberry flavor was very nicely done and the tart, slight sour flavors really helped balance it out some and make it a pretty easy drinking beer. Definitely not one of the sourer beers of the style though."
"(D)- A decent lambic. Definitely on the milder side. not very sour either, but just a little bit of tartness. Easy to enjoy though."
"On of the few good examples of framboise that I have had on tap. Yum. My wife was very pleased with the choice!"
"Thanks for pulling this out Rob, this is a treat!"
"Drinkability: I would drink this again but I'd rather have a lindemans"
"D: Overall, this is not at all what I had hoped for. While, it still resembles a true lambic, its dominant fresh raspberry flavor destroys any merits it receives from the funk. It's not a terrible beer, but I certainly didn't pay $8 to drink this."
"If you like wine then this is for you. This is a beer to get a wine drinker drinking with you and be none the wiser. It was OK but I would not order it again unless I wanted wine instead of beer."
"Brouwerij Oud Beersel"
"Easily one of the best Framboise I've had to date, and it's just as good in bottle as on draft."
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink because the fruity and sweet flavors do not overpower the taste."
" D- The full fruit is nice and not sweet with some soft lambic wild characters underneath. Easy to drink."
"This is a nice, relatively straightforward lambic. It is well balanced, not too complex but also not too demanding - definitely quite quaffable."
"Pours a very dark red...almost purple with a medium white head. The Kriek looks WAY prettier. Scent is slightly funky with a LOT of raspberry and pomegranate aromas. This could easily be mistaken for a pomegranate beer. Taste is a little too sweet for my liking. I LOVED the Kriek, from this brewery, so was hoping for something as sour... Definitely not a sour beer..way more sweet. Still very tasty with great raspberry and pomegranate flavors. Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, and a bit over-carbed. Drinkability is fair."
"poured a purplish pink in color with reddish highlights that had a half finger of head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The brew definitely had raspberry aroma with some oaky funky character but did have acetic notes and some weird buttery notes that almost overpowered the whole nose; strange. The taste was quite dominated by the rasberrries but was more sweet than sour or tart but it did still have oaky funky and acetic accents. The brew was light to medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, mild fruity, oaky, slight funky, and very mild tart finish. It drank very good but it definitely not a favorite for the style."
"A young lambic, this one is only supposed to exhibit mild levels of funk and acid. dark reddish purple with a pink head. nose is real, fresh raspberry with an underlying oak, vanilla, funk and tannin. taste is well-balanced between sweet and sour and carries just enough funk to let you know this is the real thing. medium body. sort of slick with nice tingle from carbonation. very easy to drink, and a real pleasure that this is available at one of dc's best music venues. pfunk and oud beersel framboise... a winning combination for sure."
"D: Nowhere near as good as their gueuze or kriek. Plenty of other good lambics out there that I would recommend instead."
"Tassss-teeee!!! Way to go, Oud Beersel, this is the stuff! Good as they get!"
"D: Not bad. This beer is a far cry from the Cantillons and Drie Fonteinens of the world, but is is solid nonetheless. Lacks the puckering sourness that I desire. Still much better than some of the overly sweet fruit lambics that are out there. I preferred the Oud Beersel Kriek to this Framboise...Looking forward to trying the Geueze."
"D: A beautiful summer drink, but works just as well on a cool fall day."
"Taste and easy to drink. Very nice."
"not bad by any means but nothing I will buy again."
"It tastes just as it smells, sweet and sour with a nice multi-dimensional raspberry character. There's a bit of tannic astringency that may be the byproduct of both oak aging snd raspberry seeds/skin, which does something to balance the sweetness. This is more fruit beer than true framboise to me, but it's not bad."
"I would order this again if in the mood when available. respectable for the style."
"Not bad, and has a little more complexity than Lindemans for example, but there are better choices out there among those brewers still making a traditional framboise..."
"Poured gently into a goblet. Thin lacing floats on top of a mahogany colored body. The carbonation bubbles are racing to the top of this one. It's darker than I expected. Smells like sweet vinegar; not much raspberry to be detected in the nose. The taste is immediately disappointing. Too sweet for me. There is only a faint tartness that I get mostly from the raspberry flavor, not much funk in this one. The balance reminds me of a flanders red in the vane of Monk's Cafe or Duchess. I would have a hard time recommending this one to anyone."
"D - I like the sweeter style lambics I know some dont and thats okay. I recommed this to some one wanting to get started into lambics."
"Thank God for Cantillon, Girardin, Drie Fonteinen, et. al. There should be a clearer designation between authentic fruit lambics and these sodas, especially when you can buy authentic, quality lambic for the same expensive price."
"Overall great, A must try. One of the highlights of my day. I will do my best to seek this one out again, sometime, somewhere."
"The beer pours an amber color with a few white bubbles. Not much of a head. The aroma is a mixture of raspberries and oak, with the fruit standing out. The flavor is very heavy on the raspberries with some light oak. There is very little tartness. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. In retrospect I should have let this beer age for quite a bit longer, but with no bottling date, I thought it was older than it was. Still, not a bad beer."
"The finish is light and oaky."
"Oud Beersel Framboise probably isn't hard-core enough for the lambic purists and it isn't sweet enough for the casual crowd. I'm somewhere in the middle of those two extremes and it doesn't really appeal to me either. At least not enough to buy it again."
"D: Pretty inoffensive and goes down fairly easily, but a huge disappointment. I was expecting something more along the lines of Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vielle...this is definitely not in the same ballpark."
"D-this is pretty easy to drink and very sweet. good feel to it with a nice smoothness on the palate. not too tart at all with all of the raspberry goodness."
"Oude Beersel's fram has a deep dark red berry look with some light shades of purple. No lacing comes from it and it's hard to come up with a cap, it's all good though. Smell is of weak raspberries with a tinge of chocolate and lactic sourness. It tastes like raspberries and that's pretty much it, not the boldest I've had but good enough. Not really complex for me though, pretty simple. The feel is a bit tart and a step below the medium side. Carb is stable. After having this I don't feel the need to have it again."
"Solid, workmanlike framboise. Better than most raspberry lambics, which still appeal to the lowest common denominator of sour beer drinkers."
"Pours a clear raspberry red with with a fine-bubbled slightly pinkish beige head. Rich aroma is mainly raspberry with a firm malty undertone. Malty, yeasty, raspberry flavor is both sour and sweet, quite pleasing. Texture is lively and quite tingly. Definitely for anyone who loves raspberry!"
"D- This is a very good raspberry lambic. It has a somewhat soft character but offers some complexity with oak, raspberries and two different kinds of ""sour"". Well done overall-would not mind having it again."
"Framboise is one of my favorite styles, as is traditional gueuze. This brings a bit of both very nicely in a highly drinkable brew."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a nice framboise in the middle of the sweet-sour spectrum, fairly refreshing, but the blood taste I could do without."
"Due to the extreme low lighting in the T&T its hard to get a great look at what your drinking. They poured it in a wine goblet probably 10-12 ounces. The color was raspberry with no head. The smell was pretty much nothing, only a hint of raspberry. The taste was very good. In the front of the mouth you get the raspberry flavor and when it gets to the back the sourness really kicks in. This is a nice toasting drink, I probably wouldn't want more than two in a sitting."
"Totally eh. Those looking for a good sour lambic should look elsewhere. Those looking for a moderately raspberry flavored mellow beer could do worse."
"Why? Why? Why?"
"Beer is buttery in the mouth, medium bodied, and very sour not tart. Hurts my mouth to drink it. Finishes completely and wet, a very interesting beer. Even though the beer didn't seem carbonated, once in my mouth it was filled with carbon and it helped to bring out the sour notes in the beer (probably too much). Drinkability is really high and so is mouthfeel. Overall a great great beer."
"Very nice fresh raspberry finish with hints of citrus."
"Mouthfeel is ok, drinkability is strong."
"Classic Framboise flavors without an overly sour bite. This has a fresh raspberry flavor without extra sugar added. Nice body with a a higher level of carbonation. Great (mildly) sour aftertaste--like swallowing a unsweetened raspberry jam."
"drinkability is decent. sweet raspberries with little else. it could be better with a sour or funky note, but it ends up being little more than fruit juice without much sugar on the palate."
"D- Drinkability? Not so much. If it were to be sweet, like Lindeman's Framboise, then I'd want much more mouthfeel... on the other side of the coin, I was hoping for a nice tart raspberry flavor and didn't get that either. Ultimately, I finished the glass, but will not be ordering again anytime soon."
"Overall this isn't cloyingly sweet but it's still too sweet for my liking. Worth a shot if you like framboise's on the sweeter side."
"D: Goes down very easy. Lightness on the palate, acidity, pleasant fruitiness, crisp mouthfeel make this a pleasure."
"Appearance is gorgeous with rubies and light brown hues. There is a good deal of sediment floating around. Aromas are huge raspberries, freshly picked with dirt and earth all over them. Flavors are similar. The tartness of the raspberries tickles my tongue and puckers my mouth. This brew goes down smoothly with high carbonation and a lighter body. I can sip on lambics all day, and this one was a pleasure. Very reminiscent of NG Raspberry Tart."
"This raspberry lambic isn't exactly what I was hoping to find. The raspberry character is bursting from the glass but there's too much malt for my liking and not enough sour. Now, don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable beer but when compared to some of the other delicious lambics out there it falls far short."
"D: Quite nice. A good example of a genuine lambic made with whole raspberries. Not sweetened or dramatically sour, but a nice middle ground."
"Really drinkable due to its balance and really dry finish and body."
"HV"
"D: This is a nice dessert beer. Perhaps a bit too sweet for my tastes, but a fun experience nonetheless."
"nope... this doesn't do it for me..."
"D - Great sweet raspberry flavor. It drinks like a champagne or fruity soda."
"D: My first dabble into a real lambic (Framboise). Pretty refreshing. I'm ready to try more."
"Drinks easy, but after a fe w the dryness would drive me in search of something cleaner or maltier. Very nice lambic"
"O & D: Overalla great framboise. It is of the more drinkable kind but still authentic. If you want a good fruit beer with some funk that you don't need 12 tums to finish this is your winner."
"D: one of the more drinkable lambics, not too tart, not too acidic, but not too sweet as well, nice balance. good lambic, and a nice introduction to the style."
"7/5/7/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"this is a good gateway beer for those wanting to get into guezes and other sours"
"Anyway, its a good lambic, and as usual gets great when it warms up a bit. This one really grew on me."
"375ml bottle split with a friend. I was expecting this to be sour but it was more tart if that makes any sense. It smelled like raspberry preserves, very jammy with only the slightest hint of muddy wet hay and barnyard. The taste was heavily raspberry but not sweet or cloying, good but I preferred their kriek."
"Drinkability: A decent enough and competent enough fruit lambic, at least on draft. While it isn't quite as exquisite as the Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen, I cheerfully finished my glass at the Brick Store Pub."
"Pours a clouded red. Nose is oddly funked. Seems almost like old shoes. Maybe some honey too. Flavor is firm raspberries. Not a whole lot of funkiness to it. But there is a good fruit flavor to it. Similar to the intensity of lindemans, but you can easily tell this is all natural. It gets a 4.5 on flavor because the fruit is so balanaced and natural. Feel is smooth on liquid and the carbonation is low but silky. This is a nice lambic. The fruit is a bit too intense, but it still works out."
"Beautifull deep ruby red with a creamy, pinkish head. The nose is a perfect blend of tart raspberries, musky oak and funk. Taste is also well balanced. Rich sweet raspberries complimented by sour funkyness. Full silky body is well carbonated and has a nice dry finish. A fantastic brew from Oud Beersel."
"Drinkability: Fun to sip on but not something to drink in quantity"
"bottle shared at tasting. Pours a cranberry color with a light filmy white head. Smell is very strong raspberry fruitiness. Taste is sweet and dry, tart raspberries. Very fizzy and bubbly in the mouth. Light tart funkiness as well in the flavor. Pretty good, I thought."
"Close tie to Lindeman's, but I still need to explore the style a bit more."
"Drinkability: A nice, sweet after-dinner drink, but it had a little too much ""wild"" funk for me to tolerate."
"D: Awesome! Just about the perfect mixture of fresh and natural raspberry, spice, and tangy acidity."
"Pours a beautiful hazy pink/red with a pinkish frothy head. Smells of tart raspberries with layered vinous aromas in the background. Somewhat acetic, but in balance. The taste is perfectly balanced to my liking. Sour, slightly woody flavors and a fresh raspberry zinginess followed by some more complex tannins and slight funk. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, perhaps a tad too much so. A little bit more astringency would be nice. Very enjoyable indeed."
"Color was a bit redder than amber. The foam on top was light and incredibly sour; great head retention. It had a very dry, crisp aroma to it that immediately sucked me in. Very unique and enjoyable."
"D - This is an unusually drinkable example of the style. If there is a weak point in this beer it is the aroma, which is a bit weak and lacks some of the spectacular complexity found in the nose of other classic fruit lambics. The flavor, however, is perfectly balanced and the funk and sourness are masterfully restrained to the point that they allow the beer to remain easy to drink while maintaining the complexity of a great lambic."
"D: A very good fruit lambic, funkier and tarter than Lindemans, not as dry as Cantillon, but a solid drinking beer, a very good lambic, in my opinion, very tasty and drinkable."
"Poured out of 375ml bottle with 8-2-11 exp date. Poured into a lindemans framboise flute. The color was red with a brown hazy but certainly more red than brown. Head foamed up a nice size but bubbles not very lacy more like a champagne head that dissipated a minute latter to settle in to a thin layer of foam out line the meniscus.The smell of raspberries, yeast funk, with a sugary tartness with a residual of sourness. Taste raspberry tart candies with a little dryness to sweetness of the beer but still more sweet than dry. Mouthfeel is tart and pops with a lightness, and a steady carbonation helps give a little for body to the mouthfeel. Its good framboise for those looking for more sweetness in their fruit lambics. A little more complex than sweeter framboise such as Lindemans or Cherish but less complex than Boon, Cantillon, or drie fonteinen framboise."
"Not bad for a sweetened framboise, not overly sweet and enough tartness to provide a nice balance. It doesn't rise to the great heights of the more ""traditional"" offerings from Oud Beersel but it's still excellent in it's own right."
"D - I can drink a couple bottles of these in a setting. Overall not a bad beer."
"A disappointing beer, not a bad one necessarily, but just, disappointing."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Currants and Chambord crowd the aroma, with some fannings of blackberry plants. A deep florid with a crisp rose fringe and not much head. Flavor runs with aroma, however edging more towards a tradition raspberry tart and some preserves. Aromatic and bold phenols climb in bed with a bouquet of roses. Fuming and crisp, however a touch sugary and lacking for a totalitarian fruit Lambic. Thanks for sharing Logan!"
"drinkability - not amazing due to the metalic mouthfeel and bitterness, drinkable nonetheless. i do like the ultra sourness, but might enjoy a bit more raspberry"
" I could hardly feel the alcohol in this, and for someone unaccustomed to this style of beer, it grew on me pretty quickly. It's not for everyone, but for those who like fruity beers with taste, substance, and durability, this will fit nicely. A shame that we don't have a place like the Steelgaarden here in Jersey!"
"cheers"
"DA: It's pretty easy to go through this beer. The sourness is there, but not overwhelming and it allows for more quaffing than is usual for a sour beer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: I've enjoyed the other Oud Beersel lambics that I've tried. They've all been sour with a mild funky character. This one was good, for a sweeter lambic, but disappointing to me because it was a sweet lambic."
"A beer my wife ordered at the Pizza Plant I tired it and liked it enough to get my own,poured into a small chalice a murky kind of brownish red with a well formed light pinkish colored head.Tart raspberry and oaky sherry notes mainly,quite tingly in the mouth maybe a bit much,decent sweetness upfront and flavors of raspberry puree a sherry vinegar-like sour note comes thru late along with a woody presence.At first its tasty but it seems to become a little less palatable after a bit the vinegar like sourness is annoying after a bit.If you dont drink much of this beer its great,all in all Iam glad I tried it."
"Overall - This is quite an amazing beer. Usually I'm not so much a fan of fruit beers, but with the sourness of the lactic acids, it balances very well. Definately drink this one again!"
"One bottle is enough, unless you are really into acidic fruit juice."
"Raspberry nose, without much of the candy found in many *other* framboise lambics. Medicinal raspberry flavor with white pepper. About as tart as a raspberry, tame as far as lambics go but pretty nice. Grassy profile. Screaming to be paired with a dinner salad with raspberry vinegarette. Mouthfeel lost a few points for the thick sugars that hurt my teeth, although its not as bad as some *others*. Much better than the gueuze. Not a bad beer but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Cheers."
"Drinkability is not good..this stuff will sour your stomach quick."
"a unique version of framboise that isn't all sugary sweet."
"I enjoyed this beer. It was nice to find a lambic that wasnt as sweet as Lindemans, but not as sour and funky as Cantillon. This was definitely a nice middle path between the two. This was definitely a tasty one, but the tart aftertaste made this a bit hard to drink."
"Taste: Very successful balancing act between sweet and funk, the former taking more room at first, but then the prickly carbonation and acidity slowly released more barnyard flavors within the steady stream of fruit, of raspberries that had some sugar but tasted like they weren't quite ripe enough. Very, very nice!"
"Sampled at Cole's Belgium fest."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with plenty of bubbly carbonation that gives a creamy aspect to each sip. This one is quite drinkable as it lacks the strong acidity that some lambics tend to have. Not something I'd choose on a regular basis, but always a nice treat. I'll be looking forward to sampling the Kriek and Gueuze sometime soon!"
"-UF"
"Draught. Raspberry red color, with a non-pink foam. Artificial raspberry aroma, with zero lambic qualities to back up the fruit. Flavor is unbelievably sweet, not sour, with little other character besides raspberries. Thin body. Crappy, non-traditional lambic for Lindemans Framboise fans and pre-teens."
"I wish I had a champagne flute for this; I'm drinking from my slimmest glass but I can't help but think that tall and thin would be better."
"I always enjoy framboise, so was happy to try this one. My pour was a hazy tea color with a ting of henna. There was a wisp of raspberry aroma in the air. Tastewise, definitely raspberries, but I picked up on a bit of concord grapes in the taste as well. Interesting contrast, and I appreciated the complexity. Definite dry finish with noticeable tannins."
"This is quite a drinkable beer. A touch sweet for my taste, but I don't regret buying it in the least."
"Nice burgundy color, but with only a faint bit of froth on top. Aroma of tart raspberries and wild yeast present, with a mild smell of alcohol. Taste is strong, initially I notice sweet raspberry flavor on the front of the tongue, which becomes slightly tart, but not overdone. Alcohol is somewhat evident in finish, but doesn't affect the drinkability. Very bubbly, and feels slightly thin on the palate. I felt this was more drinkable than many other lambics as the sourness was not as overpowering as I could have been. I was able to enjoy it without being turned off by any overly strong flavors..."
"Not bad at all, but if anything it lacks a little funky tartness that I suspect the Oud Beersel drinkers would wish to see."
"Let me start off by saying that I am not a big fan of fruit flavored lambics. I've tried the ultra sweet ones (e.g., Lindemans) and the ultra pucker ones (e.g., Cantillon) and they were OK, had their good points and bad, I could appreciate what they had done, but overall, I have yet to find any that I really just enjoyed sitting there and drinking. Well, I finally found one. Fresh raspberries, but in a subtle, toned down way that allows the beery lambic to also be present. Not overly sour, but enough sour to keep it from being boring. I liked it so much I wanted to try it again today, but it was already gone, finished off on the first day of a 2 week festival."
"I'd love to have it again! Hopefully next time out of a bottle, just to see what's different."
"Had this lambic on tap at the Brick Store in Decatur, GA. It pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a heavy pinkish tinge to it. The head is over 1 thick and lasts throughout the session. The smell is grassy with a bit of raspberry thrown in. I can already tell by the smell that this is more of a traditional lambic. The taste proves it, it isnt over the top sweet. It has a good sweet-sour balance and the raspberries are not overpowering. One of the best lambics that Ive had so far."
"Drinkability - This isn't a beer I would be able to drink throughout a night, but just sitting down to enjoy a drink or two with this is definitely a good possibility."
"The beer eructs for the 375ml green bottle into my snifter glass a limpid deep red with a decorous creamy light pinkish head that after its dematerialization leaves a fragile sheet of lace to enshroud the glass. Nose has a delicate sweet aroma of raspberries, with a nice tart background, a real foreshadowing of things to come; start is sweet, with a pleasant feel to the palate. Finish is sturdy in its acidity, the raspberries quite evident, and the aftertaste a tart dry that makes you pucker a bit, but what a treat, and to think at one time I disliked Lambics"
"As the beer warms up the mouthfeel becomes fuller and more tannic (think raspberry skins). This is a nice quaffable fruit beer; not sweet either so none of that horrible sweet raspberry flavor is present. Definitely a good session beer. It does not reach contemplative though; a good Lambic, in my mind, is incredibly complex (this one isn't), yet at the same time eminently quaffable and thirst quenching (this one is)."
"From notes. Poured a clear, brilliant red color with no head over top. Absolutely beautiful beer. Nose was full of brilliant raspberry aroma and just a slight sourness. It smells good. I'd like a touch more sour, but it still smelled great. Flavor was big in sweet raspberry, with just a touch of sourness. Very nice. The feel was moderate wtih a light carbonation...right where I expected it. Overall, a really really nice beer. I'd really like a touch more sourness, but I won't complain. It was good."
"Taste is tart and sour (and then some) but well supported by a strong raspberry presence. Amazing how this is accomplished without making it sweet. Overall this is a unique, highly desireable lambic. I thoroughly enjoyed this particulary as the lambic 'warmed up'."
