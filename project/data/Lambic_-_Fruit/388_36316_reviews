"2013 vintage from a 375ml bottle."

"It's a shame that this beer is not more available. Understand why, but this would be such a great beer outings, accompanying picnics, sipping on the deck and sharing with friends. This is  not a beer to limit to tastings and talk."
""
""
"What more needs to be said?  A great lambic, probably the best blueberry beer of any style by far I have ever had.  Not my favorite Cantillon, but does this get any better?  No, unequivocally not even close."

""
""
""
""
""

"Simply delicious, funky sour barn smell from the glass, but it drinks so smoothly, you just want more. Possibly the best vintage yet?"

"OVERALL: This is a solid fruited lambic for sure. Very enjoyable, and on the same level as many of their other fruited lambics. The berries are rather subdued compared to some of the other examples of the style, but that is part of the art in building complexity. I also wouldn't necessarily describe the flavor as blue or blackberries, as pomegranate tastes, and feels, much more accurate here. Nevertheless, this was enjoyable and I was very happy to finally drink this one at the source. Cheers gents!"

"O - Not that impressed and thought this was really overrated as this was one of my least favorite Cantillon to date. Really a funky beer but not much tartness or fruit flavor to it"
""
""
""
"Only had about 3 oz which probably biases my rating downwards, as this seemed uncharacteristically subtle and restrained (for Cantillon), the sort of beer that takes a bit more volume to deconstruct."
""
""
"This is not a let down and totally worth it. Perhaps rating a bit according to the occasion but still deserving of praise."

"This old bottle poured a nice murky purple-ish color, with the gorgeous pink head that everyone raves about. It actually had a good amount of head, considering it's age. Smell was predominantly blueberries and old, musty funk. It's awesome that the blueberry aroma is like actual berries, not some artificial stuff. Probably my favorite thing about the Cantillon lambics is that the real-fruit smells and flavors come through, even with age on them. The taste was stunning. Of course, there were loads of blueberries. I think with age, this beer has probably changed substantially, but everything was in it's right place. The bretty kind of funk was blended in nicely with the fruit, and a good lactic sourness tied it all together. I also picked up an interesting cinnamon note, which I have noticed previously in the cherry sours. Mouth feel was soft and lightly carbed. This beer is damn near perfect, and my review doesn't do it justice. Looking forward to trying another bottle, perhaps a fresh one, down the road. Drink this if you can; it is well worth the hype."

"2010 vintage, poured from a 375ml. Poured very hazy with a great ruby/purple color and small pinkish head. Some blueberries on the nose, musty, lots of funk. Initial sweetness from the blueberries up front, but quickly fades to a very nice sour and funk taste. Nice dry, lingering finish with a tart aftertaste. Overall an excellent blueberry lambic."
""
""
"D - A nice beer. Maybe a little overhyped, but I was glad to finally try it."
"Took a tasting glass @ Borefts 2013, split the rest with some people. Cork is wet on top & has taken some of the beer in, looks purple at the bottom, this one of the old Cantillon corks. Appearance is incredible, radiant purple, red grapes, pink shades, head is incredibly radiant pink but sadly disappears immediately, this looks incredible. Smell is old musty, blueberry & red grape skins, slight berries, cork, brett, funk,… not bad. Taste is musky grape skins, blueberry skins, old musty, cork, old wine, floral, musty, funk, light tart, brett,… Very dry, finishing carb. More grape skins than blueberry, not that impressive by Cantillon standards, this is a bit like St. Lamvinus but not as neat as the better bottles of that one. I will give it a good score because it is a good brew but I have rated other Cantillon’s much higher. This is clearly way overrated because it is rare but actually obtainable, that is just it."

"Overall, this was indeed amazing. Lives up to the hype imo. A very unique lambic--like none I've tasted."
"Okay, so I can honestly say that this is beer really lives up to the hype on its own merits, because that blueberry sweet AND sourness contributes a lot to this beer, more so than Bordeaux grapes or more cherries have done. I wish Cantillon would make a year-round blueberry lambic so that we could get this one more easily. Its an über whale because of its several hundred bottles-a-year production, but I will strongly, strongly recommend that everyone who likes sours, try to get one of these bottles at least once in their beer lifetimes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Expectations were high and I was not let down. Fantastic stuff. Wish it was part of the regular line up. Again, huge cheers to Jeffo for this bottle of blueberry heaven."
""
"O: An amazing beer. Going in I had high hopes, which were tempered from others who have had the beer previously. I will agree that it is amazing, but I would rather drink other Cantillon beers which take less effort/cost to get."
""
""
""
""
"I've been looking forward to drinking this lambic for ages now and can't thank Alex enough for sharing a bottle. Hopefully I come across more in the future. Blabaer is another homerun hit by the incredibly imaginative guys over at Cantillon, keep 'em comin'!"

"Not as world-shattering as I've heard, but a solid sour. Nice flavor integration."
""
""
""
""
"Cost: 46€ (approximately $60 USD) for a 750 ML, 23€ (approximately $30 USD) for a 375 ML."
""
""
"O: It was nice to try this but it didn't live up to the hype I expected. I'd just as much prefer to drink a Rose, St. Lam, or Fou as I would this. I'll probably try and seek out another batch just to compare."
""
""
"Overall - I hoped the fruit character would be incredible, but it's very green. Fou'Foune is better, but this is a great lambic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Amazing and enjoyed. Maybe overhyped? Try it and decide for yourself. Would have again and again."
""
""
""
""

"Light bodied with low carbonation. Finishes dry. Very inviting and easy to drink. well worth seeking out."
""
""
"O- wonderful beer glad I got too try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the best beer that I have had; but the most beautifully weird beer that I have ever had. I understand the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Yeah, this beer is wonderful. It is officially my new favorite Cantillion sour. I gotta say that its awesome to finally try this beer that I have been after for a while now."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is excellent. I feel super lucky to have gotten to try it. Can't wait to get my own bottles."
"O- A delicious beer. I wasn't sure what to expect given the hype that surrounds it, but the blueberry character is really amazing and the funkiness of this beer is highly complex, so I think it definitely lived up to its reputation. This is one of the best beers I've had from Cantillon, and certainly one of the best fruited lambics I've ever had."
"Blabaer pours a surprisingly dark cherry red, I was expecting it to be a bit lighter. Minimal pink foam tops the beer, and does manage to stick around for a while. The nose is a good blend of an earthy, slightly musty funk, and a slightly tart berry fruitiness. Flavor wise, the beer's not quite as balanced. The brett character isn't as potent, relegated to a bit of damp hay lurking in the background. The blueberry influence is a bit muted as well, just a faint berry flavor is appreciable. In fairness though, blueberry is a pretty subtle fruit in general when it goes into a beer. The acidity is what really stands out, flashy and striking while not being overpoweringly sour. I want to guess that Cantillon uses an older batch of lambic as the base here. The body is nice and light, but I find myself wishing the carbonation had just a little more zip to it. Blabaer is a great beer, and I'm glad I got the chance to try it, but give how much more of a challenge it is to get than some other 'loons, I don't think that I would recommend this one over the others."

"Considering I was dying to try this for a long time, it did not meet my expectations. There are other Cantillon lambics I prefer."
""
"2011 750ml. A crazy purple maroon color. Head is small but still purple in color. The aroma is strong. Earthy, vegetal and only a hint of fruit. Lots of twigs. Flavor is a little faded. Lemon, raspberry, and blueberry. Very nice but nothing spectacular. Tart and acidic. Mouth is very drying. Very full body/carb. Overall a pleasant beer but not worth the hype."

"I’m pretty lucky to try this brew. There is such a great balance of the main Lambic qualities and flavors; from the fruit notes to the oak and tartness. Amazing. (5.0)"
""
"Overall: Blåbær is a fantastic fruit lambic, however I am not sure it is any better than Rose de Gambrinus and probably rides on its rarity to some extent. Still if I lived in Denmark, I would certainly get my limit of bottles every year!"
""
"A amazing lambic! It is very typical Cantillon but much, much more vibrant. It is a drop-dead gorgeous beer. The taste is quite similar in beauty with its harmony between dry earth and must, and sweet blueberry. It's exceptionally balanced and it takes your palate on quite a ride. It's an unmissable beer that is undoubtedly my favorite lambic."
"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, bubbly and lively on the tongue. One of the best fruit lambics I've ever had, although I believe Fou Foune is still my favorite."
""
"Now I've had it & this - this is what lambics/wilds should be like, the sour & tartness playing off other aspects of the beer rather than being an exercise in facial contortions. Mind-blowing? No. Excellent? Certainly. Very glad to try it."
""
""
"O: A quality beer for sure, but this didn't live up to the ""hype"" for me. I'm looking forward to trying another vintage of this to see how it compares."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good not great representation of the style in my opinion."
""
""
"Gotta say, I sure as hell didn't expect this guy to drop in my lap the way it did. My thanks go out to whomever it was that shared the bottle with me. It pours a clear deep indigo topped by a finger or so of light purple-ish foam. The nose comprises funky blueberries, light tobacco, and plenty of farmhouse-style funk. A hint of vinegar seeps in the back door. The taste brings in more of the same, with that vinegar coming in stronger, though not strongly enough to properly usurp. The tartness is a lot lower than I expected, though there's definitely some tannic qualities to be found. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly sticky finish. Overall, while this was a generally enjoyable beer, it came nowhere near to living up to the hype surrounding it. I can't for the life of me fathom why so many would stop at so little to obtain what I thought to be something just pretty good. To each their own, I suppose..."
""
""
"The pour is a nice light purple color mixed with red highlights and an odd colored head--purple-pink almost. The aroma is what you expect from classic cantillon.Not a ton of blueberry aroma I would say, but a definite fruity scent does arise now and then. Slight funk. Flavor was almost delicate, tartness is more restrained than in most of their beers; a mix of light berry flavors with a decent smack of tartness and the inevitable funk. I really like how subdued this beer is and think it is wonderfully crafted."
""
"Good funk with a mild blueberry presence among oak and vinous notes. Overall, I would say this does not live up to the hype. Is it an outstanding beer? Of course. But don't trade away the farm. Try it if you have the opportunity but don't lose sleep over it."
""
"-Gfunk"
"O - This was compared next to a home brew, both smelled strongly of vinegar, I had a hard time telling which one I liked better, and both saw the dump glass. They were served blind but it was let known that one of them was Blabaer, very disappointing. Ending my search for this beer now."
"It's a nice purplish red color with a ring of pink foam. Smells of vinegar and blue cheese. Tastes of vinegar and a touch of fruity sweetness. It's quite dry and acidic. This is not good. I hope other vintages are good, otherwise this beer is seriously mediocre and y'all are deceiving thyselves"
"o - overally, what a great lambic. perhaps a great gateway sour as it isn't really sour at all, but rather fruity. not overly sweet. just right. really really solid. i can't decide if it lives up to the hype as the hype is so intense on this beer, but what a hell of a beer."
""
""
"Note: I had a 2012 vintage the following day and found the blueberry to be much more faint in the '12. I assume that the recipe is pretty consistent batch to batch, so I found it peculiar that I found the blueberry to be more prominent in the older batch than the new one."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle shared at Woodshop 7 at Beachwood BBQ in Long Beach. Pours a lovely dark strawberry/raspberry color. Deep strawberry aroma with accents of blueberry and acai. Blueberry and acai come through a lot in the flavor with a soft acidity. A really nice sour."
""
"4.5, 4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5"
""
"Appearance is deep blue purple with a small amount of purplish head. Nose is funk-ay!! Tons of barnyard and farmhouse. Tart blueberries are present, but funky yeast and bacteria overshadow it. Taste starts off with woody qualities and funk and becomes increasingly tart. Finish is tart and dry with tannins. Mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation. This one was a little heavier on the funky side than I expected, quite intriguing."
"O: wel I'm glad nameless asshole brought this beer for me to taste. An interestingly rare tick, though I don't see it living up to the hype."
""
""
""
"Verdict: This is fantastic and warrants the hype. This is definitely a celebration of fresh and natural blueberry."
""
"Overall: Extremely happy that I got a chance to try this beer and even more happy that I never traded for one. So far of all the Cantillons I have had this one was the biggest disappoint. I would half heartedly recommend trying this one just because of its current high regard in the beer community"
"O - A very complex and multi-layered drink. I am so thankful to have had the chance to try this treat."
"Pours a slightly murky dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some blueberry and other berry aromas along with a distinct plastic-like smell in the mix. Taste is much the same with the plastic quality coming through on the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer as it stands but the plastic quality in the aroma and taste is not something too desirable in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great fruit lambic, but I don't know that it's that much better than the Kriek or the Rose. I would have this again, but not at the current price."
"...But honestly, I'm pretty sure I prefer Fou'Foune."
""
"Overall, this is incredible and met the hype for me. Really complex and unlike anything I'd normally drink, in a good way. A quite intriguing beer - I look forward to trying my other vintages."
""
""
""
"Overall: Even though this is the best Cantillon it really does not justify how saught after this beer is. Do not get me wrong, I think this beer is the best Cantillon I have tried but do not be led astray by believeing that it is soooo much better than anything else."
""
""
"375ml bottle - 2010 vintage shared by jedwards. Pours a hazy, pomegranate hue with a loose, white head that dissipates into a skim and a frothy band. Nose expresses berry fruit, citric acid and a hint of something chemical. Taste follows nose with the addition of a briney character that comes out towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an assertive carbonation and acidity that lingers between quaffs. Overall, this is an excellent fruit lambic; however, the blueberry flavor is definitely dropping off. Nonetheless, I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have tried this beer."
"Call it delicious, and end it at that. I'll let the rest of the community dictate its delightfulness."
"If I ever go back to Europe, I think I'm planning my trip around the release of this beer. Damn. So good, mad props for jh1982 opening this the morning of um. I dunno, was it Friday's games at March Madness?"
"O: A fantastic effort, it's not crazily better than some of the more available Cantillon efforts, but this is good stuff."
""
""
"O- Overall a really good lambic. I was a bit let down with how minimal the blueberries were though."
""
""
"It packs a bit of a sour punch, almost like a sourpatch kid or strawberry jolly rancher, but with a fresh blueberry/strawberry quality and a background of the grass and leather from the aroma. The taste is very clean, and the fruit is right up front as the star of the show. The mouthfeel is much as the appearance - akin to fresh raspberry juice; it is just the right balance of alcohol, sugars, and clean juice to keep the body in check from becoming too heavy or too thin. Absolutely wonderful lambik."
""
""
""
"Very much complexity and stable presence, an, as always, good Cantillion. The 2011 Vintage. Thx to bark."
"A very well balanced and highly drinkable lambic. One of the most intriguing beers I have had."
""
""
""
""
"O- Ok I will have to admit I put this beer on a pedestal, and in the end it did not let me down, just amazing, when it warms up a bit, the blueberries come out beautifully, just an amazing beer."
""
"This was good. Not mind blowing but pretty darn good. While this was certainly well crafted, it just lacked that wow factor to it that would have really put this over the top for me. It seems that rarity of this elevates it a bit. Thanks for the opportunity at trying this though Adam. It was most appreciated."
""
"O: One of the best beers I have ever had. Simply amazing. Cantillon truly makes phenomenal beers"
"An excellent beer. It is supremely sour with lots of tart fruit characters. Immensely enjoyable, but not the best beer (and maybe not the best Cantillon) I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O An excellent beer. But maybe the hype is a little too much? Don’t get me wrong, this is an excellent example of a sour beer, but I just don’t think it is in the top 10 beers in the world. A great beer, but it didn't blow me away. I would rate other Cantillons higher than this one. Also note that there was some sediment at the end, which was a good surprise, you could definitely see the tiny remnants of the blueberries that went into this beer."

"After the fact consideration: While glancing over other reviews, I don't see mention of some of the unpleasant character I picked up on in this. It makes me wonder just how variable some bottles can be. This is something I wouldn't mind trying again but it most certainly is not worth the price of admission. It is not the best fruit lambic I have had, it's not even the best Cantillon offering available. The sheer amount of blueberries that had to be packed in this to discolor the brew to the deep purple it is, is amazing. Unfortunately, that excitement/impression doesn't easily transpire to the same degree in either the flavor or aroma."

"A blueberry taste is apparent with big fruity tart taste and bit phenolic flavor that carries over where the aroma leaves off. There is a lactic type of flavor with mild acidic puckering quality. The taste has a gentle woody tinge with mild bitter aspect in the background. The taste has more of an earthy accent as it warms with the funk flavor coming out to meet the fruit and sour taste with the tart pie-like berry blueberry tart tatste. Overall I was overjoyed with the experience. I find this to be a great fruit beer with a nice sourness from the wild yeast without becoming too overwhelming...the perfect blend practically of berry and wild yeast. I really enjoyed this and there is very little to find fault with -Kudos Cantillon!"
"O: This beer is absolutely awesome. I now have to seek out a fresher bottle to see what this is like fresh!"
"So glad I got to finally try this, but, I believe there are much better Cantillons."
"O-wow. Great Fucking beer."
"Overall I'm glad I tried this one, it's great. However, between fou'foune and blabaer, I would definitely take fou."
"Overall – I was thoroughly impressed with this beer. It was everything I was hoping and expecting it to be. To be honest, I recently went international to get a 33cl of the 2011. That said, I will admit this beer was not insanely better than other Cantillon’s I have had. While it is different with the variation of berries, the 2003 Lou Pepe Framboise I had recently was more mouth puckering and sour. Since I have had this beer fresh, I will now age the bottle I own. Still, a fantastic beer."
"2010 bottle share by Darkguardian at Coffee District. This was the first time having this beer and Im glad it was a fresh, because I’ve had some aged Cantillons, which were awesome, but the fruit taste was pretty much gone. It was hard to drink this beer. First off, the blueberry and sourness in the nose was so great that I just kept smelling the beer. I was fearful that I would drink it in one shot because the smell was that good. The taste was even better. Blueberries were present but not overpowering. The tartness added some great puckering and made each sip better and better. I never pass on Cantillon and its because of beers like this one."
"A little more ""watered down."" don't get me wrong, there are berries and funk, but not as much oak or depth of flavor as I remember with previous batches. This was a 375 and I will re-rate a 750 batch 7 sometime in future to see if more complexity develops. Slighty underwhelmed this go around."
"Thanks Boss!"
"Batch 7 Cantillon (2011) 750ml. Shared with buds at Bill's blueberry homebrew club tasting (think it won hands down). Pours a cloudy pink with a nice head. Great aroma of barnyard funk and blueberries. Aroma fills the glass with straw and a sour citrus that makes you want to smell it as much as drink it. Creamy mouthfeel with a balance of sweet and sour fruit and a complex mixture of blueberries, funk, apricots and lemon zest. Nicely balanced. Finish is dry and lingers on the tongue. Very nice stuff."
" Re-rate for 2009 (batch 4) 750ml: Shared by Dan at Derek’s first visit back tasting in April. Pours a vibrant purple with a pinkish head. Smell is a bit of funk, sweet blueberries, and vanilla. Taste is sour, funky, but accompanied by acidic blueberry skin with a dry finish. Woah, this was a very different beer compared to the batch 5 375ml I opened up some short time before. Way more blueberry fruit on the nose and taste which made all the difference in balancing the beer out. 9/4/9/5/20"
"From notes 8/5/11. Huge thank you to Dobby for this one. 2011, Batch 7, 750 ml. Pours a deep maroon and cloudy with a thin layer of bubbles. Aroma is very good. Lots of blueberries, earth, barnyard and mild cheese notes. The berries don’t seem terribly juicy, but it’s wonderfully restrained and complex. The taste is dry with a tannic, blueberry skin quality. I’m guessing that my review would be very high for an older bottle because this one just doesn’t seem to have the tartness of other Cantillon and 3F fruit lambics, and more sour berry flavor would put this over the top. Still, it’s pretty great, as is. Mouthfeel is fairly normal for the style - light, not too bubbly. Good stuff."
"O: One of the better examples of lambic that I have tried, great balance of tartness and flavor. Too bad that its as limited and sought after as it is because I would love to drink this more often than is realistic."
"Overall: What a great beer, looking forward to traveling to Copenhagen and pick up the 2011 version"
"12/17/10. Bottle shared with huge thanks to Keith (fata2683) before he moved to AZ! Nice purple and brown pour with a nice solid white head that is fluffy but goes fast. Big funky aroma with soapy fruits, tannic fruit skins, and yeast. Huge puckering sour flavor that lingers with huge blueberry skin... I’m very impressed by the sourness without huge acid and vinegar. Amazing!"
"A"
"Poured hazy purple color with a large frothy grape colored head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy tart fruit, yeast and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with tingly smooth texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy sour & sweet fruit flavor with a mdium to heavy tart fruit & sweet and small alcohol finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout beer & lambic."
"D. Great. Glad I got to break this out."
"Pours a hazy thick reddish purple. A nice bit of white head. Smells tart and heavily of blueberry on the nose. Tastes fruity and sour. Dry and very very tart. Incredibly tasty on the tongue. Solid well carbonated mouthfeel. Overall lives up to the legend!"
"9.7/10"
"Thanks to Joey the owner of Cigar City Brewing for bringing this to the LCBS 10. The pour was ruby red with barnyard aromas. This beer was smooth and not overly sour with tart blueberries and sour cherries dominating the scene. Just amazing twist on a blueberry sour ale..."
"Taste is very tart and fruity it's very crisp. Blueberries are very present and it's got that strong cantillon yeasty flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit chewy. Very, very good beer."
"This was undoubtedly the most intense and complex spontaneously fermented beer I have ever sampled. Needless to say, it definitely lives up to the hype. I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to sample this rare gem."
"This did not disappoint! Looked like dark pink shampagne when poured into the glass. Dry, tart and fruity. Prickly carbonation that washed all the deliciousness across my tongue. Blueberries must be an aphrodisiac 'cause I was getting laid thanks to this beer. I'm trading for a few more bottles right now."
"Poured hazy pinkish, some red grapeskin hues with a pink-tinted white head that lasted a decent while. Wow the blueberry is really coming out of the glass. Nicely tart with a strong blueberry flavor... particularly of the unripe, sour blueberry kind. There's a lot more to this: slightest hint of mustiness, grass, and a puckering acidity. The beer is light and refreshing, yet very boldly flavored. Sourness is intense and relentless even in the finish, which is dry and tart. Berry flavor lingers a bit before giving way to a nice bit of funk. The beer is effervescent and dances with carbonation, but not too much so. Crisp and velvety at the same time, I can't really put my finger on it. All I know is that this beer is simply outstanding. Thanks again for sharing, Dave!"
"After typing this review and thinking about it, I am actually tasting the beer again and I indeed know that I need MORE. Someone help me out..."
"Overall this is a very good beer, but no better than any run of the mill Cantillon, in fact, I'll take a fresh, off the shelf Cantillon fruit Lambic over this any day."
"Small pour of the 2007 black foil vintage generously shared by Shaun Hill himself on the night before HF anniversary. Hazy pinkish pour with a few bubbles of foam. Aroma is a pure wonder. Lots of blueberry remains on the aroma despite this bottle’s age, with the regular lambic aromas coming out as a nice dry spiciness, almost peppery. Taste is super fruity but quite acidic too. Never has there been such a perfect match between a fruit’s acidic/sweet character and lambic’s funk/acidity. Everything just blends perfectly into one of my new favourite beers all time. Stunning."
"D- I would love to sample this one again."
"O: When a beer is so hyped up like this one, there is concern about being disappointed in the end, but Blabaer lived up to its lofty billing without a problem. This is damn close to a perfect lambic, it's got everything you could want - fruitiness, funk, sour - in an ideal arrangement."
"Amazing balance of sour and blueberry fruit, this was the standout of our tasting, thanks for sharing Matt"
"Batch 6 rating: bottle thanks to Ryan. Best of the 5 I’ve had. Deep ruby red/pink pour with a large frothy pink head. Aroma is a pungent sour blueberry. This is batch 2 on steroids. More fruit and more sour than batch 2, which was my previous favorite. The taste is blueberry skins, bitter rind, tannins. Most of the blueberry comes at the end. Incredibly sour and fruity. 9 4 10 5 19=4.7"
"Thanks to to brewdan for this one. 750ml. 2009 vintage I beleive it was batch 1. Poured a dark purplish-blue with a pinkish head. Very subtle blueberry aroma with amazing Cantillon funk. A little more musty basement smell then the normal barnyard from Cantillon. On the palate it was dry and light. It seemed to be more tart than sour. Mostly berry flavors with a little blueberry coming through. Extremely easy drinking for a Cantillon beer. Looking forward to having this one again."
"I'm scoring batch 1 as it was my favorite rather than averaging all of them together."
"D-Whilst it is VERY dry it is easily one of the most drinkable Cantillon beers I have had. Super dry and crisp with just enough fruit sourness to help balance things out. An utterly delightful beer to enjoy slowly and savor each and every sip."
"Smooth body with great carbonation and something I need to find a way to trade for. Thanks again Brad, I owe you!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty high. The sweet tartness will limit it some, but we're really just splitting hairs. Overall this is one fantastic beer, and one of the highlights of the night. Big thanks to Dave for sharing. Skal."
"As far as it goes, this was my white whale.... This beer was very good, but in the end, I'm not sure it lived up to it's hype or my expectations."
"The CPJ"
"drinkability is great. great fruit. great depth. restrained sourness."
"Pours a turbid, purple-hued burgundy color with a thin lavender head that hangs around the collar. Very acetic and vinegary on the nose with strong tart blueberry and cherry notes. Decent amount of funk, leather and minerality. Taste is also quite acetic with strong tart blueberry and cherry flavors along with lighter earthy funk and mineral. Pours near the bottom of the bottle have more blueberry flavor and more barnyard funk. Ample carbonation and a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Lightly sweet on the finish relative to other Cantillon lambics. Pretty drinkable - the 375 disappeared way too fast. Really great stuff overall."
"Overall, I am really glad that I got to taste this much sought after Whale of mine. I would love to get more. This is one of a kind as far as the sours that I have had. I would love to open a new batch bottle to see what its like and to see if that Band Aid smell was just part of the aging on the one i had."
"The drinkability is excellent, it had some great flavors and complexity to it and was a great way to start the evening. It paired very nicely with a few good cheeses we had as well. Excellent beer overall and definitely one of the best if not the best fruit based sour beers I've had."
"2009 bottle. Pours a deep, opaque blood red with a really pretty cotton candy, rosy head that settled into a soapy haze. So pretty. Tart and acidic on the nose. Has a soft element that I really liken to 3 Fonteinen Hommage at about 1 year. Soft blueberries and raspberries. Pretty meaty. Soft and quite well integrated in the mouth. Deep blueberry skins and stems abound. A little foresty, pretty wild, quite rich. Brett isn't huge though it's quite sour and funky. Oak and soft acids are in the forefront along with the sour wild blueberries. Really enjoyable."
"D: Overall a very good beer with great flavor and mouthfeel, but not one that I feel I would ever need to seek out again. This is great, yes, but there are plenty of easier to get beers that are just as good. Don't get me wrong though, this is pretty world class."
"Almost didn't enjoy this because of the band-aid off flavor but then it went away after taking a few sips thanks to the acidity leveling my tastebuds. Flavor was short-lived on the palate. Very enjoyable but I liked the '09 better. It was fruitier, which is something I was hoping for in a fresh batch."
"The 2009 Cantillon Blåbær was the weakest link of the evening. It poured a cloudy, murky mahogany. It smelled like mulled cider mixed with berry pie. It tasted a little apple cider-y, with hint of cinnamon, sour green apple and cranberry. It was not much to my liking, but it actually helped when it was paired with dessert."
"D - Could drink it all the time. I've tried so hard to land this brew and now that I've had the chance to try it I can die a happy man (someday.) I don't know if I'd trade half my cellar for a bottle but worth seeking if you have the means. Thanks again Bill for the chance to try this!"
"MF/D: the carbonation and tartness pickles the tongue, but is certainly something i will attempt to try again. i wish i lived in belgium..."
"I am eager to try Batch 2 of this beer. From what I hear that is a real treat!"
"d - Wow, what an amazing beer. At 5% ABV, I feel like I could drink a whole bottle of this and still want more. I'm not just marking this up due to rarity; this is one of the best beers I've ever had and if you like blueberries as I do, you'll love this one. We tried various sours at the tasting, including LeBleu and Crianza Helena and I enjoyed this one more than both of them; I came home the next day and immediately tried to trade for a bottle. Would love to have again sometime and truely worth the hype."
"I could drink this all day. Very very drinkable. I would love to pair this beer with a nice fruit dessert."
"D: Remarkable! This is truly a wow beer and it doesn't get much better. It's one of those beers that I will always remember tasting."
"Bottle. Cork says bottled in 2010. Pours a really nice slightly hazes purple color with a pinkish head that both coasters and collars around the glass. Classic cantillon aroma with sour/tart notes but with the addition of subtle blueberries. Slight barnyard as well. Light mouhfeel with good carbonation. Starts sweet upfront with subtle blueberries and lemon zest. Not mouth puckering but for sure both sour and tart. Some barn type flavors as well. No real alcohol flavors. I can see why people chase this beer down as it is exceptionally good. I feel bad having to take this off my gots as this is my only one."
"I almost expected a letdown on this brew because of some of the rarity induced hype but this is very impressive even for a Cantillon and among the best beers I've ever tried. Hopefully I can land some more in the near future."
"D: All day, every day. That's the only real way to describe the drinkability on this one. I've never EVER had a beer that comes close to as good as this one. Perfection in almost every way. The best lambic I've had to date by a mile. And indeed, probably the best beer I've come across to this point."
"Bottle: Poured a deep murky blue-ish color lambic with a large enough foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of funky notes with well balance sourness and some light blueberry notes is quiet special and intriguing. Taste is a nice enough mix between some light sour blueberries with some well balanced barnyard notes with good sour notes. All elements are well balanced and provided great enjoyment. Body was quite full with limited filtration and good carbonation."
"D- I don't think it could get any better. Simply perfect!"
"Batch 6 (2010) - 375ml bottle on 9/13/2010 in a snifter. Opens with a light pop. Same resplendent appearance with a very attractive purple pink head. Wet leather bursting with ripe, tart, and slightly sweet blueberries (form a mental picture). Light musty quality and notes of damp earth and barnyard are apparent, but these blueberries are what set Blåbær apart from other Lambics. Holy hell the flavor is amazing. Tart and slightly sweet ripe Danish blueberries with notes of oak and tannins. Glorious tannic and spritzy mouthfeel This beer is excellent, batch after batch, and remains my favorite lambic."
"More phenols in the taste, with Band-Aids galore. Earthy blueberry rinds and vine clippings. Blåbær slowly numbs the tongue as if it were a low-dose application of topical anesthetic. Slightly distracting, but the underlying sourness and tart, fruity finish is where it should be. Carbonation is big and bubbly, rolling around the tongue with a delicate effervescence. Almost too much for me, although this Lambic does calm down as it warms. Glad I got the opportunity to try it, but Blåbær wasn't quite up my ally. Thanks again Michael for sharing this!"
"Super dry and tart but not abrasive, this is uber-drinkable. Thank you sir, may I have another."
"Overall, finally got taste this brew and was not disappointed. Will be seeking out more for sure."
"Overall this beer is all that it's hyped to be. I have to say that this beer would work with any fruit but the choice of blueberries puts it in a very unique subset and makes it well worth a shot."
"D - Insanely good."
"This beer definitely gets a 1 on the ""how easy is it to get out of a carpet"" category."
"D- This is a phenomenal brew. Its very complex and balanced. Almost perfect-but not quite. Overall a great sour blueberry lambic and a brew that deserves to be much sought after."
"D-great balance, fantastic beer, excellent fruit appearance with perfect acidity and tartness, light barnyard funk adds complexity and works in very well."
"M/D wonderful. the balance of this lambic is impressive and makes for a very smooth and enjoyable beer, could drink this all day."
"Cheers!"
"Overall it's not worth what I had to give up. But glad I tried it"
"D - On first sip, I was a little bit unimpressed by this. The tart and sour nature were overwhelming and masked a lot of the subtleties in this beer. As it warms the true character of this beer really stands out. Jammy and fresh fruit blueberry character becomes very prominent in a very good way. Would love to be able to try this one again, but I won't hold my breath."
"D: Very drinkable fruit lambic. Really enjoyed the blueberry aroma and flavor."
"Given how hard this is to get and the cost involved, I would probably be happy with multiple bottles of supplication or temptation. The blueberry profile makes it unique, I am just not sure that I will pony up to purchase this one again given the cost."
"D: really love sours and this beer has got to be one of my favorite beers by cantillion for sure. I hope I get a chance to have this one again."
"D: I truly wish this was more available. Definitely one of the best beers I have ever had."
"Beer is thin and light in body. Carbonation in the mouth props the body up a bit. Very sour and tart, good fruit character. I could session this all day long. Know where I can get a keg of this stuff? If I had to criticize it I would say it finishes too quickly due to the low body. I know lambics are suppose to attenuate out at a gravity near that of water, this one seemed thinner than others. If it had a little more to it, slightly more body, I feel the fruit would have popped more. Enough complaining though. This was the best lambic I've ever had and would drink it again, buy it again, trade for it again, fly to Europe to buy a bottle."
"D - Exceptionally drinkable. Could not put this one down and could easily drink a bottle by myself."
"D - Sweet and unoffensive, so it's pretty easy to drink. Not a session beer so to speak, but an easy drinker."
"I hate to give a beer all 5's, but this is easily the best lambic Ive ever had. One that truely lives up to the hype."
"Consumed: 5/1/2010"
"Perfect, medium carbonation. I could drink this all mother loving day. This beer is everything I was led to believe it was. Refreshing, gorgeous, mesmerizing. Dare I say it's a gateway sour? Good luck finding this particular gate again though."
"Overall, one of the better fruited lambics by Cantillon. Recommended if you're a fan of blueberries."
"Mouthfeel is smooth light and creamy...arid and oh so easy to drink as the acidity is not as overwhelming as most Cantillon's. Just a lovely beer and worthy of the high praises it has received. YUM!"
"Not worlds apart from the Lou Pepe series, but the Danish blueberries are what I'm partial to."
"This is certainly a beautifull beer, but seems to be on it's way down. The Cantillon funk is slowly starting to take of the wonderfull blueberry flavors. Like any fruit lambic, this is most likely best enjoyed fresh."
"Very drinkable. I kept coming back for another sip, and my girlfriend, who I shared this with, had to get me to slow down so she could have some. What an excellent beer. I don't know if I could rank it over some of the Lou Pepe beers with age on them, but then again, this beer could probably be pretty damn incredible with age too. Looking forward to trying this one again."
"Pours solid purple with beautiful pink bubbly head that lingers for minutes. Aroma is easily dominated by blueberry, but has some great lemon and orange along with earthy funk/horse blanket. Taste is mild honey sweetness then great tartness. A little vanilla on the finish but then a lingering blackberry taste on the tongue. Great tartness, well balanced and good carbonation. Another incredible lambic from Cantillon."
"D- Great, I could drink this all night. Sourness doesn't slow you down at all and the funk is heavy and nice."
"A great beer, wish I had a full case to partake during summer. The fruit here comes the way I like it, as a contributing flavor as opposed to a dominating one obscuring all the good beer notes."
"This one is very well carbonated for the style, not too much or too little, but just right. The beer has a nice dry finish and the flavors are really great, making this one highly drinkable. I would love to get my hands on another bottle. This is one of the few beers that I have had that exceeded my very expectations and all the hype."
"D: Very, very nice. Wish this had been a 750 as opposed to a 375. Exceptionally thrilled that I got to try this one out."
"Drinkability? I'm probably a bigger fan of blueberries, when done right, in a beer than most so take my words with a grain of salt...incredible drinkability!"
"Dark purple in color, reminiscent of a Merlot in the body. Dense head is pinkish red with high retention despite having flecks of blueberry in it. Delightful in appearance. Aroma of finest Belgian style funk, Cantillon signature, with added presence of lilac, berries, and cattiness. As much as I love blueberries, they are not the most aromatic fruit out there. The flavor is classically funky with dark fruits, cherry, currants, and a tart berry finish. Medium in body with a smooth higher level of carbonation as expected. This is quite a tasty beer, indeed, though I still prefer Fou Foune or Lou Pepe Kriek or Framboise. The only thing truly exceptional about this beer is about how difficult it is to get."
"For me, this lived up to the hype. I could easily drink a lot of it...of course, I know that will never happen given the scarcity and high demand for these bottles."
"EDIT: After trying a fresh 2010 batch shared generously by kbutler1, I have come to realize why everyone loves this beer so much. Fresh blueberries dominate the nose and the taste on this batch. It has the perfect amount of sour and funk blend. It is very drinkable. This is a beer that needs to be drank fresh! The blueberries show much more and makes it a real treat."
"D: This is one of the most fruit forward lambics/wild ales I've come across. I really enjoyed the balance of the fruit and the traditional funk and sourness."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full with a tiny bit of carbonation sting and a very dry finish. This beer is definitely very good, but I would be curious to see how other batches compare. This one was tasty, but not a standout."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer. From the taste I'm guessing its batch four because its balanced with sweet and funk. A lot of top beers don't live up to the hype but this one certainly does."
"""This farm boy is practically time traveling to a simpler year. Cliche I know, but honestly I am awash with feelings and memories of growing up on the farm. Barefoot through the grass, eating handfuls of wild fruits, running with the horses as a child...Highly recommended to ANY country folk, I'm curious if this brew envokes anything similiar for the city dwellers. I could literally smell and daydream all day with this beer in hand!"""
"4/4.5/5/4/4.5"
"D: This beer is immensely drinkable against some other Cantillon varieties that are intensely acetic or dry. This delivers the flavor without being so extreme that it becomes tough to finish. Cleans up well for the most part. Goes down too easily, almost."
"Slightly tart and very puckering with a lot of musty barnyard funk. Not very acidic with a lot of earthy oaky tannis. Lots of dark fruit notes that adds to the sweet vinous, vinegary character. The blueberries really come through as well as some grape, plum and fig. Very complex and well balanced. This beer is surprisingly drinkable considering how complex and funky it is. I wish I could drink this again. Highly recommends!"
"All in all, quite a satisfying beer, and a real treat. Does it live up to the hype? Welll.... grain of salt. World class beer, just not sure I would trade my little sister for one."
"Drinkability- So this beer wasn't exactly what I was expecting or hoping for as the blueberries are fairly light and the beer is fairly tame. I know it'll sour up more as time goes on but for now it's very easy drinking. Too bad this wasn't such a bitch to get or I'd grab another bottle to sit on for a year or so. Thanks much Randell!"
"I simply can't have you all the time, but you are lovely, and one day... It is wonderful. It truly deserves every bit of its reputation. And I am the luckiest man in the world."
"Truly amazing beer, but not one of a kind. I could (and probably will) give a review very similar to this one to Vigneronne, Classic, and especially St. Lamvinous. It's not miles ahead of any of those. But it is miles ahead of the competition."
"D: Out of this world. This really was a treat. To cap off the tasting with this was a superb decision. Now I just have to find more ammo to get more of this!"
"D - Definitely one of the most drinkable Cantillon beers, I found this to be not as brash as some of the others I've had in the past, probably due to the addition of the blueberries. While this was still quite sour, it also had a slight sweet character and plenty of woody notes to quell the intense tartness, even if only slightly."
"Although I liked the beer I can not say it was amazing. Mostly because I did not feel those blueberries I expected neither in smell, neither in taste, if they were there it was certainly too subtle."
"Let's just say that I would drink copious amounts of this every day for the rest of my life if I had any more of this beer. Man oh man, what a beer..."
"The body and drinkability are perfect scores as well, I'm just gonna go ahead and give all 5's. After 1140 or so reviews it's becoming rare for me to feel a beer deserves a perfect score but this is no ordinary beer. I'm becoming sad but sated as the bottle empties, like a glutton I drank the whole thing. I offered some to my wife but, validating that the sour tartness is indeed becoming undetectable to me in these beers, she shied away from the wild notes."
"Grades: A: 4,5; S: 4,5; T: 5; M: 4; D: 5. Total: 4,7"
"This is a pure funk bomb, tastes like a blueberry flavored band-aid. Fruit wasn't as present as I remembered, and this bottle was fresher... Too medicinal, I'm going to knock my appearance down to account for the difference in batches."
"EDIT: Recently tried a batch 6 and it was MUCH better. Red pour with pinkish head, strong blueberry smell, some lemon. Very sour, sour blueberries, musky cologne, farmhouse funk, grainy blueberry seeds. A tart medium body with a medium carbonation. Very drinkable."
"I finally got a chance to try this beer, thanks Jeppe! The beer poured a hazy, deep amber almost crimson body, dense. Vigorour head formed, vibrant pint color that receeded quickly and left a full ring on the edge. The nose was very tart, earthy and a bit of exotic fruit. The taste...tart, tart, tart! Don't get me wrong, the taste is excellent. The blueberry notes are strong, fresh and wonderful. There is also some citrus and pepper on the tongue. If you take a look at the label, the face tells you the story of this beer. Tart yet wonderful. Well worth the effort to get it."
"Perfect mouthfeel. For such a sour beer, excellent drinkability. Sadly, though, it is over all too soon. Just as the mountains erode into pebbles of dirt, and we all eventually succumb the creeping inevitability of death, so too did I guzzle my sole bottle of Blabaer Lambik down my gullet."
"I'd love a case of this in my car boot"
"*NB: This is hands down the best lambic I have ever tasted in my life. Because I found the blueberries to be a bit subdued, I have adjusted the Smell down .5 (should be .25 really). This is the only thing keeping me from giving all fives."
"The more it warms the more I can't help gulp it down. I didn't quite like it when I first poured it but it came alive after about 10 minutes. Great stuff!"
"D - So easy to drink, I already want another all to myself!"
"D: very crushable. 5% and extremely refreshing."
"This beer is VERY easy to drink and enjoyable. There's big flavor, lots of sour all trailed by a nice berry flavor. Wow..."
"Batch 3 pours hazy ruby color with a thin off white head. Looks almost pink. Aroma is perfect. Blueberry, some funk, tart acidic character, and a touch more blueberry. I could just smell this all night. Medium light mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Flavor had blueberry, tart acid, funk, and had a nice balance between the fruit and the funk. The blueberry flavor was a little subdued on the taste. Otherwise this has got to be one of my favorites. Thanks Brad for sharing this!"
"D - Drinkability is terrific - I wish I had a 750ml bottle as the little tasters were a huge tease. Obviously low ABV, and lower carbonation, and amazing taste and feel conspire for an amazingly drinkable brew."
"Well, I've certainly been looking forward to this one and it didn't disappoint. It's got lots of funk and vinegar but it's much more balanced (for me) than some of the other Cantillons I've had. Wonderfully balanced and deserving of the praise."
"Quite a pleasure to have been its receptacle. :P"
"Hazy red pour with a reddish white head. Tart blueberry and oak in the aroma. Flavor is very similar, mildly dusty and good god is that sour. Very tart finish with just a touch of sweetness that...""balances(?)"" it out. This was batch 2 from 2007."
"D: One of the best beers I have ever had. Simply amazing. Even with the insane rarity this is still a 5."
"D: I hate to rate hyped beers high but this beer demands it. I've never been disappointed by Cantillon but this exceeds even their high standards. Truly a world class beer if I've ever tasted one."
"D: Very good for the style. I usually don't find Cantillion to be real drinkable this one is."
"A very slow gusher, and by slow, I mean younger35 slow. Pours a deep purple body, almost black, with a quick dark pink three finger head that falls quickly to a foamy layer of goodness which lasts throughout. Minimal lacing, but still a beautiful brew with amazing colors. Aroma is packed with dark berries; blueberries, blackberries, and some red grapes as well. Underneath the berries is some funky hay and vinegar, but not overpowering. Taste starts with the sweet blueberries again but is quickly followed by a balancing tartness. Midway the horse blanket and grassy flavors emerge and dry up the mouth. Aftertaste consists of citrus zest, elderberries, and some earthy flavors. Love. This baby has a lot of life on the tongue as well. Fluffy, bubbly, and crisp...an absolute delight. Too easy to drink, total beergasm...I really need more. Thanks so much Joey!"
"A stunner in Cantillon's stable of world class beers. If lambics are your thing then you must try to search this one out. The best fruit lambic I have tasted."
"750ml Bottle shared by Bobby91w. Pours a murky purple with a nod towards red. The nose is all about fresh blueberries. The flavor is they typical Cantillon lambic character turned down a notch or two. Oh, and the blueberries are rocking there too. I thought it was a bit thin. Other than that, really good stuff."
"This is the most increadable lambic i have had the pleasure of drinking. If you are able to get your hands on a bottle, it will be a wonderful experience."
"For those of you in doubt about whether this is worth seeking out I hope I can be of some assistance. You have to, you owe it to yourself. It was unlike anything else I have ever drank. This being the 3rd or 4tth batch of this beer, from what I have heard, the first was too sweet, the second too tart. I think the problem here may be age. This really needs to be consumed fresh. The flavor is soo ripe now, so mind blowing perfect it is hard to put into words. I have lost myself in the hobby again thanks to this bottle. Thank you Cantillon. Thank You."
"One of the best sours and truly one of the great Cantillon beers out there. Can't wait to have this again."
"I've had the pleasure of tasting several bottles ( 75cl & 37.5cl) of this fine fruit Lambik; vintage 2007 Batch 1 & 2. Pours a light to medium burgundy with slight white head! Has a pleasant tart funky barnyard aroma with a touch of blueberry maybe a little cranberry in the background. Gotta love this soft tart blueberry zest; just enough to cause the lips to smack with delight. Much less acidic and sour than some other Cantillon fruit Lambics though. The mouth feel was pleasant with some carbonation along with a perfect balance of Blueberry tartness/acidity. This is definitely one of the best fruit Lambics on the market today. Thanks Jeppe for supplying all those tasty blueberries to create such a great brew."
"Notes: I had a chance to try the second release from 2007 (75cl bottles, gold foil) and that batch is far superior. The funk is more restrained, the brightness of the blueberries is incredible and the palate is quite to die for. I'd give that version scores of 4/5/5/5/5 but since I got only 2oz of that (thanks, Carl!), I'm not going to review that"
" Two finger head on top of a purple haze colored effervescent body. Hints of blueberry and a silky mouthfeel, perhaps too silky for the style. Little to no hop presence. Typical tartness for a cantillon and a blueberry finish make a wonderful lambic. Best fruit lambic i've had to date. Enough horseblanket to make me remember it. I've heard the 2009 version will be ready shortly, buy more of this one."
"Notes from and tasted on 10/7/07."
"Luscious berry flavor, a very savory feel, with a moderate level of sour. Not too sharp or acidic, it's vinous and just about perfect. Nice level of carbonation that gives it lightness without any distraction. Just a fantastic complex lambic that really showcases the blueberries."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Fruity up front, the unmistakable taste of blueberries shining through above even the puckering sourness. There's plenty of sourness here as well, though it's not as abrasive as some Cantillon beers. There's no sweetness, no malt to speak of; it's tart blueberries from start to finish. The bugs provide lots of depth to the flavor, but there's no distinct funkiness, as the fruit really does overpower almost everything else. The finish is dry but not overly sour or acidic, making this one of the easiest drinking lambics I've had."
"Wow, this is supposed to be the less tart / funky of the two vintages; I can't imagine (or is it can't wait) the 2005 vintage I have waiting for me being more sour than this. This is just quite funky right now, this definitely leans towards the hard side & I wonder how much of this has developed since bottling; especially since I see this as being less tart and more fruity than the 2005. This is fairly fruity, but certainly not in a dominant fashion (even by authentic Lambic standards), the fruit seems to more contribute to the tartness and tannic qualities of this beer rather than the ripe berry notes one might expect in a beer described as fruity. After having said all that, this is just a fantastic beer, as someone who really like funky, sour beers and my fruit to be a supporting player, well this just hits the spot quite well."
"Nice balance between the sweet and sour. A well made beer."
"Yummy."
"Taste: Carbonation was not as prickly as other fruit lambic I've tried, and the fruit is definately in the forefront here, and it's all blueberry, but the kind that just a bit unripe, when they're sort of greenish blue. I can't tell you if they were like that when they brewed this, but it certainly worked out extremely well. The acidity seemed somehow separated from the flavor, as if every sip came with two acts, the flavorful rush of fruit flavor, then acidity, that was drying and refreshing - sounds contradictory, but it isn't - but was at a very sustained level, not as massive and brutal as some of the other fruit lambics. It was probably one of the most balanced lambics I've ever sampled. Lord knows people have tried and failed to make good blueberry Beers, but this style seems like a perfect fit. It went down insanely well, and was an absolute orgasmic match with trappist-made chocolate-dipped blueberries I just happened to have (it's the season here in Quebec). This one is a masterpiece."
"The flavor is absolutely incredible. Of all the Cantillon beers Ive tried with fruit additions (cherries, raspberries, muscats grapes, red wine grapes, apricots, cranberries) the Danish blueberries in this beer is absolutely the best fruit addition. After the mid-palate, the blueberries become dominant. The fruit tastes lush, authentic and phenomenal. Also, for a Cantillon its not intensely sour like Rose De Gambrinus or Fou Foune, but instead, very well balanced. This is an incredible fruit lambic."
