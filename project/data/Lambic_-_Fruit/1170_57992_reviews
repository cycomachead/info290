"This is the 3rd Upland sour I have had and while I applaud an American brewery trying to make Lambics, they have missed the mark in my opinion and the product doesn't warrant the hype."

"Despite the heavy tart quality, the fruit character makes this the best Upland I've had to date."

"O-Easily of of the best fruited lambics Upland makes."

"Overall very interesting, almost undrinkable as its so sour, but still delicious, walks the fine like of awesomeness."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this beer was way more sour then I thought it would be. Aromatic, tasty, very impressive that it could be so sour yet still drinkable."
""
"While I though I erred on the side of enjoying highly sour fruited beers, this beer just put that to the test. All sour, muddled fruit, no finesse....a rough go and a downer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Very good feel. Overall, a very unique kind of lambic. I have never personally tried a persimmon, so I can't really compare, but in this case they seemed to add a lot to the beer. Probably the class of the three variants that were opened. Definitely a recommend."

"This was the first time my body has ingested any form of persimmon or even persimmon flavor, and it was quite delicious. I can't help but feel that I'll be let down once I get my hands on the actual fruit itself. Persimmon Lambic is so delightfully pure and raw by nature, though, and sour fanatics will have no trouble enjoying this beer. Makes me want the rest of the Upland Lambic series now."

"O: One of the best of the seven and just a uniquely flavored beer all-around. Worth checking out."

"Overall - Not really lambicky, but a nice American sour. Much better than the Kiwi I had a couple weeks ago."

"8.5/10"

"Wish I could remember who to thank for this treat but the trade took place some time ago"
""
"This was decent. Personally I think this is rated a bit higher than it needs to be. An interesting fruited ""lambic"" for sure, but nothing I'd need to revisit."
""
"I've had this beer a number of times now, and I think it was best nearly a year ago. Drink up now if you have it! It's most certainly not getting any better, though will probably always be a very tasty, flavorful, very sour beer."

"O: Solid, but I would like to see the fruit character enhanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have tried all the Upland fruit lambics except the strawberry. I have enjoy most of them and this one is no exception. Another solid sour beer from Upland!"
"Drinkability: Interesting but needs a bit more fruit, I've now tried a few batches of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great American sour, though the last bottle of this I had was certainly better (previous batch maybe?). Seek this one out -- it's worth it!"
"Bottle to oversized snifter. Looks good; light and inviting. Smells nice; this was my first encounter with the fruit persimmon, but it smells great, especially alongside the tartness of the lambic. Tastes solid; light and tart with a pleasant fruit unlike anything I've ever come across. Mouthfeel is good too. Overall, a very tasty brew that I'll definitely seek out again!"
""
""
""
"Overall this was a nice surprise and a beer that I wish I could get my hands on more regularly. The aromas were out of this world but taste and mouthfeel left me a tad disappointed, considering what it costs to acquire a bottle of this. Hopefully if they make this again it the carbonation will be more balanced out so I can really enjoy the complex flavors here."

"This beer really surprised me. The persimmon is an exciting new addition, and, I was pleasantly surprised and the great balance and overall character. I was a little wary of the carbonation, but was very satisfied with it's place fitting in nicely to the overall profile. Not as 'funky' as some, less emphasis on horselblanket and more on tart sour fruit and balance. I suppose that's the only thing I was left wanting more of, and yet, what's in the bottle is pretty incredible. Glad I opened it now; would have been great to hang on to for a year longer; wish I had another bottle."
""
"Overall: This beer is just awesome. I don't know what a Persimmon tastes like, but I enjoyed this. So light and refreshing, I would love to get some more."
"(D)- Despite the high carbonation level, the fruit profile in this is quite fresh and refreshing/vibrant. Not a ton of funk or oak characters, but the sour fruit is full force. Looking forward to seeing how this develops over time."
""
""
"D: This was a fantastic lambic with a unique scent and taste that were super clean and delicious. It was complex yet simplistic, with a fitting body and well hidden alcohol. So it was easy to drink, but amazing to sip and contemplate. Could probably age a long time. Lovely beer and highly recommended."

"Big thanks goes out to my boy aasher for giving me this one during our MASSIVE in-person trade when he came down to visit! Thanks Al! Slight gusher! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, sour, subtle funk, passion fruit, persimmon, and slight sour apple. The flavor was of sweet malt, persimmon, tropical fruit, tart, sour, and a very slight funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a solid brew. I really have to say, that I quite enjoyed this one. I have had a lot of these in the series and this one is definitely up there as far as one of my favorites. The persimmon is definitely the star of the show on this one and keeps reminding you of this fact throughout every sip. A really well done brew that should be tried by anyone who likes the style or persimmon. You won't be disappointed."

"Pours a very light yellow hazy liquid, violent inside with a creamy white head. The nose is sweeter than the peach with some mineral notes up front. Lots of fruity aromas, peaches, mango, light touch of sour in the nose. There is a tang on the fruits which I am told is the persimmon (never had one). The taste is balanced and subtl, lightly sweet, hints of tang with a faint mineral brett note. There is some spice in the back and a nice level of sourness, not overpowering but adds depth and is balanced wel. The feel is creamy, lively carbonation, rather dry, light crispness in the finish."
""
"It doesn't get you all the way in the back like Cantillon does but all in all, a pleasant beverage to share with friends. Too much for me and my SB to finish in one sitting."
""
"I have to say I wasnâ€™t the biggest fan here, but I am happy I had the opportunity."

"O: Best I have had of the variety, but these sour beers really aren't my favorite."

"This beer pours a milky, somewhat opaque pear juice washed yellow. It pours smoothly and medium in body. The nose is quite possibly the greatest and freshest nose that I've ever experienced in a beer. The aromas are full of freshly cut fruit, melons, pears, kiwis, slight lactic sourness, and persimmons galore! The freshness is absurd. It is just so luscious and fruit forward. The flavors too of tart juicy melons, persimmons, fresh peaches, with slight funk. It is near perfect. It drinks fresh, sharp, and crisp and goes down well. It's hard to actually sip it because I can't get my nose out of the glass. What a masterpiece! Phenomenal, phenomenal beer."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable Wild Ale. I really like the delicate flavors and champagne like carbonation. Decidedly subtle and refined."
"Really enjoying this offering and absolutely looking forward to the strawberry and kiwi that arrived in the same box. Lovely persimmon fruit counterbalanced with the intense sourness and a lot of funk. Very drinkable, would definitely enjoy another bottle or two, were it not so limited."
"Pours a clear pale yellow. Almost colourless. A bit of white head. Doesn't really look that great. Smells sweet and fruity. The persimmon aroma is great . Incredible fruit aroma. Tastes very tart. The fruit is simple and enjoyable. A bit more sour than i would like but well carbonated and overall pretty darn enjoyable."
"O - a strong tasting beer. Lots of tart. It's pretty dang good"
"O- I absolutely loved this. I don't drink this style often but this one may have opened my eyes quite a bit. Grab or trade for this if you are a fan or sours."
"O: The persimmon fruit was very delicious and seemed to take on qualities of many differnt fruits. Not overly sweet and was very drinkable."
"4.5 D: I enjoyed this a lot. This is easily my favorite Upland brew. It captures the essence of the persimmon perfectly and presents it with force. There aren't too many brews out there that are unique, but as of now, this one is."
"Rating: 95 out of 100"
"Been waiting to try this one for a while as I had a friend who made persimmon wine back home. Good flavor and nothing is terribly overpowering. Very good job by my local brewer."
"Thanks again to Patch and Strick for lending a helping hand."
"opens with a burnt yellow and huge head. Tremendous hard fizzy head...and it keeps coming. nose is of sourness and hay. oaky presence from the barrel age process as well. Taste is first of wood bitterness and a sour fruit. The fruit blends right in with the wood...and I wish the two flavors were segregated more. I can't seem to appreciate the woody flavor here in this lambic. The persimmon is a nice sour fruit flavor...wish it was more dominant. mouthfeel is crisp. A rush of fizz hits the lips so hard you can feel a slight burn from the bubbles popping. It is a pleasant sensation. Overall, nice sourness to it, very drinkable due to the heavy carb, though I feel to much of this would both upset my stomach and overpower my senses...too much oakiness for me."
"O: I was very dissapointed by the non-existent carbonation. Other than that the flavors of this really redeemed it. Its very complex and refreshing. A very good lambic, I think this is just a bad bottle."
"Overall-- very very nice. I would love to sip this beer again."
"The aroma was beautiful. Rich sour funkiness with huge touches of tropical fruits and notes of light hops mixed in. Light peppery and spice notes come through as it warms, but the sour funk was so hardcore. The flavor was puckeringly good. Rich fruits and herbal, hoppy, and lightly spiced, hallmarks of a great beer are all over this one. As it warms barrel notes, lots of spice and a long drawn out and very dry finish"
"o - Overall this was a good beer, but a bit disappointing. It was a bit fruitier than some of the other Upland lambics and not as funky as the others. I had heard some people say this was their favorite/the best one, but it definitely isn't mine. Worth trying but I like the funkier ones better."
"Drink- A very good lambic. I have enjoyed all the variations that Upland is doing. This was dry, fruity, sweet and bubbly."
"[Edit: I think I had this way to quickly after it came out. Since had it and it was one of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Smell adjusted up]"
"This is my favorite offering of the Upland fruit lambics. The persimmon doesn't come on strong but something about it makes this beer very subtle, easy to drink, and infinitely quenching. I could have this one over and over again."
"A nice beer. I can't wait to try this one fresh in a few months to really experience the persimmon, but this has a nice bretty depth and the persimmon is a fantastic conduit for the wild parts of this beer, providing soft sweetness, tanginess, and spiciness. I'd love to see this with a more refined wild base and anticipate the second batch being even better."
"[Review from backlog, July 2010]"
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A pleasant surprise...."
"Reviewed on 5/14/2010. Bottle thanks to FlssmrBrewAlum. Pours a cloudy light yellow with a thick white head and lively carbonation. Aroma of light funk and a sweet smelling fruit, which I'm guessing is the persimmon (I'm not familiar with the fruit). Flavor is very bready and malty with less funk and fruitiness coming out. Enjoyable and palatable but I wish that more of the persimmon came out in the flavor."
"D - Super chugable. Very easy to drink and my pour vanished quickly. Not an outstanding lambic by any means, just good and easy to drink. Upland keeps getting better and better every batch they make."
"Unique and worth trying, but I'd recommend familiarizing yourself with persimmons before you do so."
"Light bodied, spritzy, maybe a little low in carbonation versus my expectation from the gushing, nice mouthfeel though. Recommended."
"D - Super easy to drink, with friends or by yourself. Good beer."
"Bottle from 2008. Pours a fairly hazy peach with a large, loud head that recedes to nothing. Much like a berliner weiss, very weird. Nose is soft light fruits, a bit of barnyard, brett, and light sea salt. Kind of a soft orange/lemon in the mouth. Dry oak, lightly tart. Fizzy. Kind of a melon-like sweetness -- I actually eat persimmons fairly often and cook with them, and I can in fact pick them out here. This is more like a soft, spritzy berlinner weiss than a lambic, kind of in the vein of Festina Peche, but more refined and interesting. Little sourness to speak of. I really enjoy this, it's quite an interesting take and very well done."
"The oddity in flavor dings the drinkability of this beer some but I'm sure I could still enjoy a healthy portion of it."
"D - Good drinkability, it would be best shared with a few people but it's a nice beer regardless."
"The flavor is butter oak and slightly spicy, with a lactic persimmon character and a light moderate sourness. The finish is dry and fruity, with lingering tannins and oak. A very drinkable and surprisingly enjoyable sour beer."
"Tart and fruity on the tongue, persimmon shines through nicely. It's highly carbonated, excessively so, which thins the body a bit and blurs the flavors slightly. I get an herbal, almost medicinal or aspirin-like flavor mid-palate. Refreshing stuff, very quaffable, we finished the bottle in about 10 minutes and I could have gone for another pour. It's only mildly sour, though quite dry, especially in the finish which does display a bit of oak and tannin. It's a nice thirst-quenching beer, not particularly outstanding in any way but very good."
"Overall, this is a very solid soour. Good fruit and funk balance. I could drink a lot of this on a hot summer day. Very happy with this one."
"Pours a golden yellow, a LOT of carb with a white head, a lot of lacing that stayed around a while. Smelt a lot of funk, and citrus. Tastes slight funk, slight citrus and sour at the front, followed by a sour and heavy citrus finish. Very clean finish as well, I can definitely taste the persimmon on this one. Very drinkable, very refreshing. There is a lot of carb, feels great, right where it should be. I really wish I had another of these."
"D: This was a really easy beer to drink, as a lambic should be. I liked the flavors a lot, but you need to let the carbonation die down for quite some time before you can get the full enjoyment."
"D - Extremely drinkable, and never gets overly sweet or acetic. Too bad it was so rare - please make again Upland!"
"Bright and fresh citrus aroma, uniquely fruity, which must be the persimmons in there. Tastes almost mimosa-like, citrusy again with a good level of tartness that puckers somewhat. 5/10 on the sour scale. Light bodied and soft on the palate, drying quickly leaving traces of oak and Brett in the aftertaste. Spritzy and fruit forward, almost juicy. Very quenching and easy to drink. If it weren't so scarce, a bottle would go down fast, even several at a time."
"D- This beer was very good to say the least. I think it will only get better with age. The sourness isn't very in your face yet but give it some time and it will be. I wish I had a bottle of this to keep onto."
"Persimmon Lambic appears a very light straw yellow hue with a substantial head and copious amounts of caked on lacing. Wonderful aromas of sour funk, tart fruits, and lemon zest make this a very inviting beer. The taste is delicious and well balanced, with more tart citrus and lemon zest. The mouthfeel is nice and funky, but a tad overcarbonated. This is a tasty beer I really enjoyed and would love to have again."
"This is a great fruit lambic for sure. I was hoping for a little more funk on the back end but overall it turned out to be a great beer. I would recommend it, trade for it, drink it again in a heartbeat."
"I really liked this beer and hope they make it again!"
"D: Overall I like this beer, and the tart rather than sour flavor does it well. I have high hopes for my only bottle. Although it is good now, I hope it will get better with a year of age and perhaps the flavors will further develop."
"D: Highly drinkable. I presume this is low in alcohol, and provides great taste characteristics and pretty good complexity for a beer of this size. Nice interplay of flavors and I'm looking forward to seeing how this develops over time."
