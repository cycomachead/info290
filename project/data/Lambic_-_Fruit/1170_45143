Taste is similar to the nose, tart and tropical with a good amount of oak and funk. Surprisingly refreshing, with a crisp mouthfeel, medium body, sharp carbonation, and dry, puckering finish.

Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch carbonated white head that fizzled away quickly. No lacing, either. Aroma is mostly tart fruit, along with some funk, lemon peel and a bit of kiwi. The taste is nice and tart, the brew tastes like lemon peel, funk, tart apples, kiwi and oak. This is definitely a tart and acidic brew. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high but soft carbonation and it's very easy to drink.

I even get some California Chardonnay notes from the oak. Unlike the Persimmon, I don't get fresh fruit let alone any kiwi. The flavor is nice and tart, almost a sweet and sour. The kiwi fruit doesn't really show itself. It eventualy does pick up some melon character though. It's an interesting beer to say the least. It is somehow fruity without showing the premiere fruit. It finishes like it should, like a dry lambic with soft fruit character. It features really nice and interesting flavors. Overall this is a fine beer and is easily one of Upland's best.","aasher","Oct 23, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, kiwi, funk, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, kiwi, BIG funk, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. The sharp funkiness of this one really threw me off a bit as I was expecting the kiwi to dominate on this one. However, it was a pleasant surprise for sure. While the funk was definitely the star of the show, the kiwi did manage to add some sweetness to the brew while the sour notes helped to cut it a little too. This made this brew quite drinkable and enjoyable. Really glad I got to try this one, but not my favorite of the series that I've had.","thagr81us","Jun 19, 2011"

4.67,12.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a semi-cloudy orange like color with a frothy white head that dies down rather quickly. The nose is of funk, sour tart fruit, a small amount of kiwi, and more funk. The flavor is just brilliant. The kiwi is extremely well integrated without taking over from the base funk with this sour. The mouthfeel is full with bubbly carbonation all around the palate. Probably one of my favorite Upland lambics and can't wait to try the rest of them.","TrueRates","Dec 01, 2010"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Reviewed on 5/13/2010. Bottle thanks to FlssmrBrewAlum. This was a delayed gusher (but luckily I didn't lose too much). Pours a super cloudy dirty orange with a thick white head that quickly subsides. Tons of yeast sediment. Aroma of potent funk and sour fruit (kiwi I guess). Flavor of sharp citrus, kiwi, and sour funk in the finish. Great palate for a lambic-- just a touch of acidity but overall very drinkable. This was one of the most enjoyable lambics/sours I have had in awhile.","LilBeerDoctor","Oct 24, 2010"
3.9,-6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Reviewed from notes. Batch 1, a big thanks to Chris for sharing this. Poured into tulip, color is golden yellow with no head. Smell is hay, berries, sweet malts and bready dough. Taste is very interesting - Coconut, kiwis, cloves. The kiwi is suprisingly good, not a flavor I thought would come through in a beer this well. A tiny hint of sourness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and near still, some acidity in the finish. A very good beer but I wouldnt exactly say it is a lamic. Good drinkability for whatever the style actually is.","nkersten","Oct 22, 2010"
4.37,5.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Pours a moderate golden color with a wee bit of haze. There is a slight white head that has some lasting power. The nose brings some tart, light kiwi notes. It's not overpowering, but it is definitely there. I really like what it does to the beer when combined with a bit of funk, oak, and sourness. Kiwi is certainly a fruit that more brewers should be using with regard to lambics. Maybe the flavor fades really quickly and that's why. Either way, this beer combines the fruit with the sourness and mild funky plus oak quite well. Nice feel and drinks incredibly well.","Thorpe429","Oct 15, 2010"

3.77,-9.2,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Probably the most Lambic like of any of the Uplands I have had, my guess is that the extra time in the bottle has funk'd this up nicely; though this is still quite a long ways from emulating any of the remotely traditional Lambic blenders / brewers. On the other hand the kiwi influence is pretty non-existent at this point. It is interesting how fast this beer fades in the palate. After a couple minutes presence, flavor and complexity of this beer seems to drop out quite a bit; this is even true after taking a break from the beer for about an hour. Now if Upland can only figure out how to carbonate one of these, capture the vibrant fresh fruit character and have a base beer that is actually funky all at the same time then they will really have something; perhaps some of the new batches have done this.... Hmm.","Gueuzedude","Sep 26, 2010"

3.76,-9.4,2.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Drinks fairly easily. I don't think that I could pick out any kiwi on a blind taste. I have been much more impessed by their other lambics.","craytonic","Sep 19, 2010"
4.15,0,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"DR- Great. Could have a lot of these if it was possible. Would drink again given the opportunity, but not seek it out. Given the rarity I would go with a Belgian anyday, but great to see an american brewery progressing so well in this style.","gueuzer","Sep 17, 2010"

4.25,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a hazy golden orange with yellow highlights that had a finger of head and left a little bit of lacing sticking to the sides of the glass. The aroma was quite nice and gave characteristics that it would be nice and sour with acidic citrus notes popping out along with slight brett, oak, and green apple but really was trying to find the kiwi within the nose after every whiff. The taste was quite similar to the nose consisting of acidic citrus, green apples and oaky bretty accents. Sip after sip and no real big kiwi character on the palate but it did have faint pineapple notes. The brew was medium body with a good amount of prickly carbonation which had a sweet, sour, acidic, and dry finish. It drank really good but I wish it had big kiwi flavor alonside a sour punch; oooone daaaay.","Gobzilla","Jul 23, 2010"
4.2,1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: Probably the best of the Upland lambics that I've had, with the Blackberry being surpassed by this one. Still, a bit too sweet for me, but a nice beer.","womencantsail","Jun 27, 2010"
4.3,3.6,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Pours a hazy-yellowish color with a half to full finger of white head. Smell is brett, some more funk, and a very little amount of kiwi. You can smell some fruit and slight citrus, but not really kiwi. Flavor is tart with some citrus. Kiwi is extremely hidden. I wonder if the kiwi's they used weren't ripe enough, that would explain a lot. It is a good beer, but I was hoping for a ""kiwi bomb"" I guess, as I love kiwi's, but I'm pretty sure I did see some kiwi seeds, bonus. Quite a bit of carb on this one, felt really good and it felt really crisp and lively. Drinkability is really good, I wish I had another bottle to share with friends, but there's always next release!","Lukafer","May 30, 2010"
4.33,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D- This beer is fantastic. This years was better than when I have had it before. I am glad I really got to try this one out and wish I had a bottle for the cellar. Do yourself a favor and seek this one out. It just shows you that even a good lambic can be brewed in the midwest. Upland..your beers may be a little balnd at times but your lambic shine through and through.","alleykatking","May 30, 2010"
4.08,-1.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured a recent BA tasting event courtesy of hannot, this is the '10 vintage. Pours a very unique cloudy off-yellow color with a foamy head. Pretty to look at. Some mild and earthy fruit characteristics on the nose. Taste is 6/10 on the pucker-meter with fruity tartness dominating and some hints of kiwi in the aftertaste. Best part is the chunks of kiwi lining the glass and accumulating for a nice finish. Very refreshing and bright.","squaremile","May 05, 2010"

3.92,-5.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Of all the varieties of fruit out there, kiwi is one of my LEAST favorite, though it's probably the texture more than the flavor I dislike. That said, I was happy with this 'lambic' and found the subtleties of the fruit usage pleasing. Not an amazing beer, but a good one and one I'm glad to have been fortunate enough to try.","msubulldog25","Mar 30, 2009"
3.83,-7.7,4.5,4,4,3,3.5,"I now believe that a lot of the hype on this one was because of how limited it was, continuous trend of this brewery's lambics being too sweet, far from what breweries in Belgium has to offer, might drink again, worth trying but wait until next year when more of it is released and you do not have to trade too heavily for it, do not think this one will age and become any better either, I actually think it will do the opposite","Floydster","Mar 30, 2009"
