"O:  An alright beer overall, but I'd like a bit more depth and carbonation and less phenols and acetic flavors."
""
""
"Definitely not feeling this beer. It tasted like someone poured vinegar into cherry cough syrup and shook it up. That's not a good taste."
""
"Really thought I'd like this more. The mix of sweet and sour didn't hit me right, though I love tart beer."
""
""
""
""
"Very enjoyable brew. Cranberry flavor is very nice. Blend of sweet and sour in this beer is just right. Another great New Glarus beer!"
""
""
""
"This is fantastically drinkable for the style.  Tart, fruity, minerally, light & lively effervescence.  Was craving something tart on a beautiful albeit chilly spring day and this is perfect"

"Another marvelous beer from New Glarus in their ``Thumbprint"" series. It says on the bottle that they only cut Dan loose a few times a year to let him brew whatever he wants. Goshdarnit, if this is what he does when their back is turned, I wish they'd turn him loose more often."

"Overall - Not sure what separates this from the Unplugged version. Wishing this were a little more sour, but it has an excellent fruit flavor."
""
""
""
"Some nice tartness, the cranberries are there, semi sweet but more tart.  The balance could be improved.  Another good NG fruit beer but not as good as some of their others."
"Thanks, sj3324, for the opportunity"

"M: Not a lot of carbonation but great finish."
""
""
"Got this as an extra in a trade. Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Pours a pale maroon almost pink with little head and no lacing. Smells of ripe tart cranberries, taste is much sweeter up front than the smell with a juice like feel, no carbonation felt, and a very pleasant tart taste at the finish. Just excellent"

"Cranberry shines! It has almost an Ocean Spray Cran•Apple vibe with some dry, tart bacteria. Want it to be more intense. But for this to be in 4pks, and sitting on shelves... Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely Tart but good stuff"
""
""
"Little too sweet for my taste.  Was sort of like a 7-up and Cranberry juice."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a sour beer. Nice cranberry flavor, really good actually. Not a lot of carbonation on the head but it's ok on mouth feel. Pretty good overall as I'm not a huge sour person but could drink these on summer days."
""
""
""
"Weird after taste ruined this one for me."
""
"Sweet and sour fruits, similar taste as the fruit beers with a light tart finish"
""
""
""
""
"Too sweet for me...Just not a fan."
""
"Overall: another outstanding beer. A lot like their fruit beers and definitely up to par with them."

"Reminds me a lot of RRs Supplication in appearance and smell. Good carbon level with a nice wet Finnish. Great cranberry flavor profile with underlying funky earthy n oak elements.  Initial burst of vanilla esque sweetness followed by a sharp tart kick"

"This brewery sure knows how to make fruit beers, and this one is no exception to that. This is right up there with the classic lambics from Belgium. Impressive!"
""
""
"Tart, Crisp, refreshing cranberry flavor.  Enjoyed this with Cremeaux and Mareike Gouda cheeses"
""
"overall- just a tad sweet for my taste. But very pleasant. Enjoyed it."

"Overall - I could probably chug one of these on a hot summer day after going on a 15 mile hike."
""
"Overall. I don't expect much from any north american ""lambic"" but the smell was pretty impressive."
""
""
"Overall: Another great fruit beer from New Glarus. Not the sour, funky lambic I was maybe hoping for, but still an excellent beer worth trying."
""
""
""
"Overall a very interesting beer.. I could see this being a good refreshing summer beer. Easy drinker, lots of flavor."

"Yet another great fruit beer from NG!  Great fall like aroma for me with the cranberries.  Reminded me of cooking in the kitchen, just delicious.  While I am not a huge cranberry fan I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
"As New Glarus always does, this beer won't blow you away with its complexity or layers of flavor but its very very enjoyable nonetheless. A simple to-the-point fruit beer that's world class in its purity of flavor."

"Starts with a big lambic nose: lemony tartness, some barnyard, a trace of cinnamon and a suspicion of cranberry. It pours a brilliant rose with a quickly dissipating pinkish white head that produces fine light lace. Cranberry leads the attack on the palate with a big lemony tart finish spiced with cinnamon. Long, lingering lemony cranberry tastes. Has a very prickly effervescence. Good balance between the initial sweetness and the finishing lemony tartness."
""
"I am consistently amazed by New Glarus's skill with fruit beers. This one is full of fruit, but so well balanced. I love it, and I wish they made it more often."

"The body was light, clean, crisp and very, very dry, near perfect. Drinkability is mad-whack good, yo G's!!! These little boogers could slide right down your throat all day long. Overall, a great beer. A must try. On the other hand, that describes a LOT of this breweries beers."

"Bottle as a trade extra, labeled as Unplugged, not Thumbprint, so unsure if the year. Pours murky amber color with a small white to off white head into my Cantillon taster. Aroma of toffee, caramel, oak, even some chocolate, along with the expected cranberry fruit. Smells pretty rich, not a huge lacto tartness here that I would expect from something claiming to be in the lambic style. Flavor is lots of funky cranberries, plenty of sweet caramel malt, oak, and a bit of metallic oxidation. On the sweeter side with light tartness from the fruit. Medium plus body with high prickly carbonation. Very much in the style if their big fruit beers, and less so in the lambic/wild/sour category. nevertheless, a nice little fruit beer."

"T: Taste is somehow better than the smell. Tons of sweet cranberry and cherry juice upfront with a sweet wave of golden delicious apple behind it. Finish brings just a tickle of oak and a touch of honey. Mouthfeel is just a touch slick with some prickly carbonation to keep the sweetness in here in check. This is Belgian Red level for me. A really delicious beer."

"I feel bad for the rest of America that can't get this wonderful brew."
""
"initially I gave this a low score last year at release time.  Just cracked one the other night and oh my has it gotten better after a year.  Crisp, tart, refreshing and not nearly as cloyingly sweet as it was fresh."
""
"Light bodied and tart, full of cranberry juiciness, though there's a musty, minerally wet dirty dishrag note that throws it off a bit. Sharpness of the acidity tends to build, sip slowly and it's less of an issue. Crisp and quenching. Where the aroma had complexity, the taste is a little more one note. I still enjoy it, though it seems more acetic and a little off from the last iteration (same beer as ""Unplugged Cran-bic", so I expect this to get merged eventually)."

"Another Amazing NG fruit beer--- lots of crisp cranberry, just the right balance of sweet and tart, and that funky-extra-flavor that's in Belgian Red and others that I just can't place... A winner."

"Overall: another solid beer and another killer thumbprint. this one falls right in line with the 4 big fruit beers, most akin to raspberry tart. The only things that I would change would be a stronger carbonation and ditching the pasteurization (at least thats what I have come to believe after seeing the beer and bottle and the research that I could find on the topic.) I really wish this one would develop over time and drop some of the sweetness."
"Pink color. Looks kind of like pink champagne with light carbonation. Sour fruity aroma. Very tasty. Tart cranberry fruit taste. Slight musty yeast taste. I like it a lot. I’d say it’s like a cranberry sour beer."
""
""
"This is just insanely excellent. At times it doesn't quite feel like beer, but then the tartness comes back and it reminds you that it's a sour. Just awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's always hard to say which New Glarus sour fruit is the best, but right now I am going to say this one...until their next one comes out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very tasty lambic-style brew. It doesn't hit on anything perfectly for me, but it doesn't miss on anything too far, either. It's just sour and wild enough to elevate it above fruit juice, but it's not quite refined enough to raise it into a higher tier. Definitely enjoyable."

"Overall: Another great fruit beer from New Glarus. Good taste of cranberry juice with some nice notes of oak and yeast. 4.5"
""

""
""
""
"Not one of my favorite styles of beer, but that being said definitely worth a try. Especially if you like this style."
""

"O:  I think I'm going to have to pick up a case of this. Great balance of flavors and extremely drinkable. (4.5)"

"O: The overall impression reminds me of Raspberry Tart but with a bit more tartness and funk. Not a bad thing, but I was expecting more of a trad -lambic with some cranberry imparted in the flavor. Hopefully some age will drop out the sweetness a bit and make the base beer shine more."
"I put this up there with VSB and Wild Peach any day... Honestly, its that good, though lighter and refreshing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"However, the sweetness is a bit stronger than I would prefer, and it doesn't have the funky complexity that would make it truly great.  So I'll give it a 4.25 with an asterisk stating that it shouldn't be compared against some of the top-tier sours."
"Final score: 4.0125"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is a great beer but I prefer something less sweet.  Great example of a sour fruit beer."
