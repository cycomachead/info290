4.2,1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/amber color with a small foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring fairly quickly. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, golden raisin, pear, apple, toffee, bourbon, coconut, oak, honey, light caramel, light pepper, and bourbon/oak earthiness. Damn nice complexity and balance of pale malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa nib notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, golden raisin, pear, apple, toffee, bourbon, coconut, oak, honey, light caramel, light pepper, and bourbon/oak earthiness. Slight amount of oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, coconut, oak, honey, light caramel, and bourbon/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of pale malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa nib flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged wheatwine style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of pale malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa nib flavors; and smooth to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 12, 2015"

4.5,8.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.75,"this really is one of the most interesting and delicious beers ever made. i have had the privilege of enjoying ti a few times not, but have not gotten to write about it here until now. its a very special brew, tasting quite a bit like white chocolate, and while there has been some discussion about soured and infected bottles or batches or whatever, that has not ever been my experience. the base beer is amazing, but its almost hard to imagine the wheaty strong ale without the bourbon barrel and the additives. the bourbon character is immense here, sweet vanilla and oak and booze in nose and taste. the addition of vanilla in the process really picks up on the component of the bourbon, and the vanilla factor is consequently through the roof. the cocoa is raw and more of a cacao butter type than a chocolate in the traditional sense, giving further credence the name white chocolate. while its obviously a very strong beer, the alcohol never really gets in the way of the unique flavors, which i would say about most of these bruery strong ales. this is one of the more decadent and delicious ive ever had, so much vanilla, so nice as it warms. its luxurious and regal and i am thankful to have shared it with good friends. for me this is the final evolution of the style, i cant imagine this being improved in any way.","StonedTrippin","Dec 28, 2014"

Smell is sweet and huge with white chocolate flavor. What a great smelling beer. There's a sweet bourbon start on the flavor, then falls back to a smooth white chocolate and vanilla after taste. You can also pick up oak, and the alcohol burn isn't overwhelming. It's incredibly sweet but it's so flavorful. Medium mouthfeel, slightly carbonated, thought it would be more bubbly from the appearance, but I'm glad it's not. Nice unique beer and a great sipper.","Mikeypnh","May 03, 2014"

Aroma of white chocolate is actually surprising with some residual sugars and some vanilla. Taste is also very reminiscent of white chocolates with some vanilla and quite a bit of residua sugars. Taste is quite over-the–top so it is probably best to drink this in small doses. Body is about average for style with good carbonation with no alcohol being easily apparent.

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, wheat, sweet alcohol, vanilla, and cocoa nibs. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, wood, milk chocolate, wheat, earth, spice, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. There is a ton of stiff going on in this one. The nose was really quite nice and balanced. Almost like this is just an unassuming beer for the masses. The flavor is the first hint that something is going on here. The booze on the follow through confirms it. This thing has simmered down some in the time before I opened it. Granted this made it really quite well balanced and easy to drink. Yes, I just said that. At 14+%, this was easy to drink. Could I kill an entire bottle to the face, probably. Would I recommend this to high schoolers to butt chug? Absolutely. The less of them there are, the better, after all. Definitely find a way to get this on your palate. Based on the rumors from the 2013 bottles, get a 2012. Based on this, you won't regret it.","thagr81us","Beers"

The beer poured out as muddy looking gold or copper color with a fizzy white head that comes and goes very quickly. No retention or lacing at all in this beer but I suppose it's due to the high ABV. The smell of the beer is strong, it's got a lot of boozy ethanol fumes as well as vanilla, cocoa and bourbon oak. The smell does resemble actual White Chocolate a little bit. The taste of the beer at first has some sour notes that were a little unexpected from the barrel aging. The more I drank the vanilla and chocolate flavors became more intense which was really impressive. The mouthfeel of the beer was boozy, a little syrupy and had a moderate carbonation to it. Overall I expected the beer to be more along the lines of a Southern Tier Creme Brulee or something like that. It was much stronger than I thought it'd be as well. It's not as good as I had hoped for in my opinion, still very glad I got to try it though.","Knapp85","Jan 08, 2014"

Even the chocolate and vanilla isn't overpowering. The raisins really stand out for me initially though. Aftertaste is a bit rough, that's my only real complaint. Very unique, strong and complex brew at the same time. Never had anything like this.

This stuff pours a hazy auburn topped by a half-finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet bourbon, light candied orange peel, vanilla bean, buttercream, light oak, and a twinge of booze. The taste brings in more of the same, the orange coming through a bit stronger, though tempered a bit by the booze. Still, the sweetness is what reigns supreme here, but not in a Southern Tier Creme Brulee sort of way: more restrained due to the overt cooperation of its constituent parts. Basically, the complexity of the sweetness plays off of itself, rather than having it serve to o'erwash all else as in the aforementioned New York-based stout. The body is a hefty medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice wheatwine, one that somehow did not overdo things with the barrel and the additives, despite how easily it certainly could have. Good times.","TMoney2591","Sep 27, 2013"

White chocolate and citrus, maple syrup maybe, with an alcohol finish that stings. Almost like a white chocolate rum, but the citrus and syrup flavors balance this out.

While the nose showed some promise, this was artificial tasting, boozy, muted, and the feel was light and harsh, making it difficult to choke down my 6oz glass. Fruet was leagues better than this, proving that The Bruery can make high quality booze bombs. This was a complete disaster, however. Drain even had a tough time with this, and she's dealt with some doozies in the past. I'm glad you boys were thinking of me when this came out, so I greatly appreciate the bottles gents.

Quite a nice beer if the booze didn't really kick in, and I wish some of the great aromas like bourbon and vanilla were more present on the flavor. Curious how this will age, could be great as the booze mellows and the flavors merge, or could be bad as all the great characteristics fade out.","jlindros","Jan 16, 2013"

The alcohol is well hidden. But on the other, it is sweet, with a candy-like taste. And I don't want to drink a glass of candy.

4.16,0,3,4.5,4,5,4,"White Chocolate pours a hazy auburn, turning positively opaque with the final pour. Maybe two fingers of bone colored foam forms to fill out he top of the glass. Head retention and lacing are both minimal, this one's just not much of a looker. The nose though, is fantastic. Lots of vanilla, some toasted brown sugar, and a little bit of chocolate and bourbon. It really does live up to its name. The balance shifts a little bit in the flavor profile. Vanilla is still the central focus here, perhaps even more-so than in the aroma. The brown sugar disappears entirely, leaving more room for the chocolate, and especially the bourbon. Still, the vanilla is just a little bit overbearing here. The mouthfeel though is as good as you could ask for from a beer like this. The body is only heavy enough that I'd guess the beer was 9% or so ABV, and the carbonation is just enough to cut through the beer without distracting in any way. I wasn't sure what to expect from White Chocolate given my mixed reaction to White Oak, but it's a very nice beer. It'd be a great bottle to open after a meal with a few friends.","axeman9182","Nov 27, 2012"

That said, this is far too drinkable. You don't have to chew it and you don't have to wince from the booze tinge. It's pretty tasty and definitely worth a try. Does it taste much like actual white chocolate? No, not really, but I'm thrilled about that since white chocolate doesn't do much for me anyway.","DavoleBomb","Nov 26, 2012"

I remember reading reviews of this beer when it was first released, and someone said it didn't have a good nose on it. I respectfully disagree with that. The nose is like a delicious desert. I get some definite white chocolate...even a little bit of a cheesecake aroma. Sweet, boozy vanilla aromas with some lovely bourbon. A good amount of vanilla with a hint of orange. Taste is not a dessert-ish as the nose. It is definitely still a sipper and rich like a desert, but the wheatwine characteristics kick in, making it not so rich. Still has some boozy bourbon and vanilla flavors, but also has some orange citrus flavors. Some light maple syrup flavors with a sharp, cloying sweetness almost on the back of the palate. Very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is perfect for this style, as it is not overly carbonated and not too full-bodied. Drinkability is fairly high for what this is. Overall, there is no way in hell I could drink a whole bottle of this, as it is far too rich and sweet for one sitting. However, when shared amongst friends, this beer is brilliant.","DovaliHops","Oct 04, 2012"

Lots of sweet vanilla and white chocolate up front with a solid bourbon oak flavor and plenty of alcohol to remind you this is a huge beer. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy mouthfeel. I really liked this beer it's quite different.

4.49,7.9,4,5,4,4.5,5,"Pours very light with a very small head. It looks like the wheatwine cousin of black tuesday. OH WOW. The nose on this beer is unbelievable. Enormous flavor of...wait for it...White Chocolate. Like, potent sweet vanilla white chocolate cake. It smells like a beer/desert hybrid. If you are going to call a beer "White Chocolate", I cannot imagine you could make it smell any better than this. The taste is very sweet, like sipping on desert. It doesn't come off as inappropriate, other than this being released in 750 mL bottles. Again, sweet vanilla and white chocolate cake coupled with a bit of booziness (but, for those familiar with BT, it's on par). The mouthfeel is moderate and actually not as huge as BT or as expected. Surprisingly easy to drink given everything above. The bottom line is that this beer is quite the achievement. I don't like actual white chocolate and find this beer to be a better execution than the product itself. 5 in the execution because I cannot imagine nailing a beer with this name better. I had probably a 4 oz pour of this, BT and a 2 oz 50/50 cuvee. BT was slightly more dominant in flavor, the blend didn't live up to my expectations and WC really impressed. After drinking all of that, I took a bit more out of the end of the bottles and quickly realized that I didn't really want or need it. I would say sitting down with 4-5 oz of this beer is well sufficient, as, as such, I wouldn't open a bottle of WC with less than 5 people sharing in it.","seeswo","Sep 01, 2012"

Flavor is much better: lots of vanilla, thick and sweet caramel/honey. Not much alcohol, just delicious confectionary delight. In sample size, this is awesome. If only it smelled good.","illidurit","Aug 07, 2012"

4.32,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a small white head. Nose is full of rich vanilla and chocolate. Very sweet with plenty of bourbon, oak, caramel, and toast. The vanilla and chocolate notes are the stars of the beer on the palate as well. Plenty of bourbon/oak flavors with a subtle toasted maltiness. Just a hint of spice and yeast in the background.","womencantsail","0"
