4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled in summer 2014. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big golden raisin, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, plum, honey, caramel, toasted bread, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pale/bready malt, stone fruit/citrus, and moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big golden raisin, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, plum, honey, caramel, toasted bread, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of golden raisin, lemon/orange zest, apricot, plum, honey, caramel, toasted bread, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice robustness, complexity, and balance of pale/bready malt, stone fruit/citrus and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wheatwine style. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of pale/bready malt, stone fruit/citrus, and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 17, 2015"
3.9,1.3,4,4,3.75,4,4,"750 ml bottle.  Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  The aroma is sweet, the brew smells like raisins, dark bread, wheat, brown sugar, and caramel.  It tastes like dark fruit (raisins), brown sugar, dark bread, honey, wheat, caramel, earthy hops, and a bit of booze and apricot.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating, a little syrupy and smooth with moderate carbonation.  I thought this was a good brew, it's always nice to see more wheat wines out there for me to try!  $14.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jan 16, 2015"

3.95,2.6,3.5,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pous a hazy, medium orange amber with a brief thin head that dissipates to light ring around the glass, leaving no lacing. Aroma of caramel, light stone fruit, alcohol. Flavor is sweet wheat, caramel, honey, stone fruit, finishes unexpectedly dry and peppery with lingering hop bitterness. Thick, almost syrupy body with light carbonation. A classic take on a wheatwine, with the sweet body and hop finish, a bit sweeter than expected, but the drier finish balances that out and make an interesting flavor progression. I'm curious about how this one would age as the sweetness balances out; will cellar one if I see another bottle.","LiquidAmber","Oct 11, 2014"
