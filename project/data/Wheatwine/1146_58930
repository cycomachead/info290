3.97,-2.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Very good beer in which I am glad to have sampled. The flavors were interesting and well match without overwhelming. This beer paired surprisingly well with the Sweet Potato Fries with Curry Catsup.","kzoobrew","Jul 31, 2010"
4.52,11.1,4,4.5,5,4,4,"D: One could sit at the bar and drink two or three of these easily.","fastpass17","Jun 05, 2010"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, a very solid wheatwine. Even without the bourbon it has some solid flavors. Very to to have tried this one. Relatively drinkable as well.","mothman","May 11, 2010"
4.27,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, fruity, juicy, with a sugar filled whipped cream smack at the end. Abv is evident here. 8 months in one of my favorite bourbon barrels (Elijah Craig) is fitting as a sipper.","weeare138","Nov 28, 2009"
3.46,-15,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Tasted on draft at Goose Island Clybourn. Pours a clear amber with almost no head. Aromas of caramel malt, sour fruit, and lots of oak. The flavors are slightly sweet up front with caramel malts, and it is very oaky. The bitter hops come through on the mid-palate and the back of the palate. The body is full with medium carbonation and a sweet and oaky finish. Overall, this is a very good beer that, I think, requires some more aging time for the oak and alcohol to integrate.","wedgie9","Jul 03, 2009"
4.25,4.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Light on the palate, alcohol is evident preventing a higher drinkability score otherwise this is a must have any time it's available.","robbyc1","Jul 03, 2009"
4.17,2.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"D: I was feeling this by the end of the glass but this was a masterfull wheatwine!","GbVDave","Jun 27, 2009"
4.77,17.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is great. This is a hige beer, with only a touch of wheat malt character and a ton of malt complexity. The smoothness of the finish is probably the most lasting quality of this brew. Very well crafted and supremely drinkable, even for 9% APV. Cheers!","botham","Oct 21, 2007"
3.97,-2.5,3.5,4,4.5,3,3.5,"3.5 D: Good tasty brew, but not all that drinkable due to the biting alcohol.","DavoleBomb","Beers"
4.6,13,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"If they didn't make Bourbon County Stout too, this would easily be the best Goose Island beer I've ever had. As it stands, it's a tough call.","kajerm","0"
