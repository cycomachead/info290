"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, wheat, toast, and caramel. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness and some slight cocoa and coffee flavors. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but nothing I would get again."
"D - Very drinkable. Big and bold, with lots of barrel character, but the flavor blend together pretty nicely."
"O: I wound up not finishing it. The name was pretty damn accurate."
