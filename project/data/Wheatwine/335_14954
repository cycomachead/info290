4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toast, toffee, raisin, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light pepper, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Light amount of booziness in the aromas, but not a bad thing. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light pepper, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light earthy oak/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, fig, date, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light pepper, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate dark fruit flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged wheatwine style! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 12, 2014"

4.31,8.8,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"I've had one other bourbon barrel aged wheat wine and this one is noticeably superior to that one. It has many of the same characteristics as Founders Backwoods Bastard, but the bready notes are dialed down and the wheat imparts a softer feel and a faint hint of tartness. The next time I strike out trying to get Backwoods Bastard, I'll pick up this instead and be just fine. One of the beer guys at the bottle shop where I frequent made the comment that if this stuff had a Three Floyds label on the bottle, people would do crazy things to get it. He might be right about that.","deadonhisfeet","Nov 18, 2014"

In fact, everything is really top notch until the finish...this bottle has at least a year on it and the finish is still way too boozy and hot. It fails to stick the landing, but that doesn't diminish the fact that this is a strong wheat wine regardless. Pilgrim's Dole is, however, the rare instance where barrel aging diminished as opposed to improved the beer.","siege06nd","Jun 15, 2014"

4.05,2.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a Wheat Wine, it tasted pretty similar to when I had it a couple years ago, but the barrel aspects stuck out more then I remember and that worked nicely with this beer. This beer has ok drinkability, it isn't that smooth, and it has a good amount of warming alcohol, this beer is a sipper plain and simple, one is just the right amount, I don't think I have it in me to drink two, the sweetness would be way too much for me. What I liked most about this beer was how complex it was and how well the mouthfeel suited this beer, those were the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, it was a little intimidating at first, but once I got used to it it wasn't that bad, I just wished it was toned down a notch. I would buy this beer again, but not often, it's a once in a while treat, and it's pretty expensive, but I feel like it's worth it, I recommend giving it a try if your a Wheatwine fan or like high octane beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, it was much like I remember with just a little more barrel aspect that only adds to the complexity. I am a big fan of Wheatwines, but it's a style I don't find often and I wish more brewery's explored this style, New Holland did a great job with this one, I like it more the Dragons Milk. Good job guys, this is one high octane and good tasting Wheatwine, I deem it worthy. 2014 Edit, it's been a little over a year and half since I've last had this vintage, but I just pulled one out of the cellar for my birthday and it's tasting pretty good, it's still fairly boozy and a little hot, but there's some great and rich caramel and oaky flavors coming through that stick out more then they did when this beer was fresh. I still think age could help and hopefully tone down some of the booze but as it stands right now I think it's a 4.4. I might wait a year to ty the other bottle in my cellar.","StoutHunter","Sep 06, 2012"

There were touches of almost musty pepper or something, hard to place, but very full and very difficult to fully grasp the flavor. Nice hot streak of alcohol running through it as well.

On the tongue there is a big fruit hit right at the beginning with caramel afterward, all riding on a big wave of alcohol. In the mouth it's a full bodied beer, not as sticky as I thought it would have been based on all the sweetness heretofore.

There are but small islands of carbonation which quickly disappear so there is no head to speak of. The smell is of liquor, whiskey specifically, this one gives notes of rum-raisin that reminds of a good port. There are also notes of honey to be found. The taste is quite sweet the sugars come through almost instantly, but not far removed comes the flavor of whiskey. There is a toffee tone to it that is accentuated by what would seem to me to be dried fruits such as apricot and raisin. On the palate it is quite thick like the car lubricant it appeared to be, which could be considered appropriate for the style. After the initial pour there is almost no carbonation to speak of on the tongue. As far as drinkability is concerned this is a great beverage in small doses.

Still early, some dark, earthy browns linger still, but are clearly facing imminent eviction. The long trek has begun, with Saint Christopher smiling on my progress. As the countrysides continually change, the air strangely maintains the same scent throughout: a light bit of flour and cracked wheat combined with an ambrosial sweetness. Flowers seem tobloom on the edges of the air itself. A pine forest stands at an eternal distance. Respites are few, as the Book would seem to have it, and are mostly consumed by the breaking of the fast. I rely on the kindness of locals who support my holy travels. Far from manna, the taste is still plenty sweet, with side notes of whiskey and toffee and a bitter undercurrent. Trudging on, my feet meet minor temporal resistance, but, as the miles stack up behind me, it's as though a thick muck is increasingly impeding me. 'Tis the devil's temptations, I swear it, and I shall continue on my way to spite the demon. No head bubbles shall sway me from my path, though few have come to me up 'til now.

The body is nearly full and the carbonation is low but sufficient for the style.

The aroma is echoed in the drink with vanilla, malty graininess, and a slight vinous flavor flow slowly through the viscous body. All though there is a touch of a carbonation sting on the tongue, the carbonation level only moderately high. The finish emphasizes the oak and vanilla flavors while it begins to warm.

Full-bodied, for its large size and general heaviness, the carbonation is fine and full of pinpoint prickles. Very boozy and alcoholic, you feel a buzz right off the bat. While there's some dryness at the end, again, sweet and almost like a "dessert beer," piles on the molasses, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla bean, milk chocolate, you name it. Poached pear, apricot, plum fruit with notes of raisins and dates. Creamy and once more without that much hoppy qualities, more like cereal and granola. Glazed orange peels.

Some have mentioned how interesting it might be to see this oak aged (which I believe they have do or have done in the past), and I can totally see the potential of that. For me this has a vanilla undertone resemblance that could be tremendous in the right barrel. It may also lean quite a bit to barley wine characteristics with wheat notes, which after all is what a wheat wine is sort of meant to be.

I am warming as I write this and will return to this ale when the cold weather reappears. Serve with a wide variety of foods, particularly stews, braises, and bold etouffees.

Carbonation is almost non-existant and a silky mouthfeel that coats slightly but pretty watery for the style. Slight alcohol in the finish that is a little dissapointing. Upfront is sweet, wood, dark fruits, hops have all but vanished from this 2007 vintage. I really think the alcohol is a bit much for the body of this beer.

There's also creamy toffee and caramel sweetness along with slight hay component that must be the wheat. Smells terrific. Wow, first taste is just about as good as it smells. There are hints of alcohol that hit upfront and ride to the finish with some warming sensations that are a bit too strong and detract some from the experience. On the good side are the tasty fruity notes of cherries, raisins, dates and prunes. The malts come off just as they smell in the nose with sweet caramel candy, toffee and hints of wheat.

Big, sweet aromas of caramel, cotton candy, tropical fruits, and fruit cake emmits from the glass and proves to be mouth watering. The first sip is a heavy dose of sugars ranging from confectionate sugar to syrupy molassas along with nuts, figs, dates, and barely. The wheat additions seem moderate and give the beer a suble, soft grain (cereal) flavor and thickens the textrues considerably. A bit oily with a hint of diacityl (buttery) on top of a full bodied brew, chocked full of residual sugars. The beer is a good sipper, but lacks the depth and complexity of other Barleywines.

Taste follows aroma with a nice aged barleywine flavor of rich pruniness and caramel sweetness, some soy sauce in the flavor as well, before finishing with a slight nutty wheat taste and a good sized dryness and alcohol warmth. For as rich as this smells and tastes, one would expect a heavier, perhaps more sugary body, but with the wheat content it is not at all cloying and is even slightly thin in the mouthfeel in the finish.

It has all the character of a big barley wine but without any of the features - the alcohol completely hidden, the aroma over modestly restrained, and the flavours stay quite mild. I was enormously impressed by how strikingly balanced this was. A big beast of a barley wine that was spotlessly veiled in refinement and elegance.","biegaman","Dec 03, 2006"
3.87,-2.3,4,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is a fine example of a wheat wine. It has the strength of non-wheat strong ales with some of the most noteworthy characteristics of a strong wheat brew--soft textures, fluffy mouthfeel, and a shrewd drinkability. It's lack of bouquet is nothing more than a tranish on an otherwise top notch beer. A great example of the style and my favorite brew from New Holland. Highly recommended.","benito","Nov 24, 2006"

My first impression upon tasting was that of chocolate and fruit, followed immediately by a strong sense of the alcoholic content (10%). This latter taste is perhaps my biggest dilemma in relation to this drink: the alcohol permeates the overall taste just a bit too much for my liking. In fact, it almost tastes like a sweet liquor at times. Of course, this is also my first wheat wine style drink, so perhaps I am just unused it. Lastly, the mouth feel was thick and creamy. Other than that, my observations have just about run out. Not a bad beverage at all, but like I said, the alcoholic taste is just a bit too much for me.

Starts off with a little caramel sweetness followed by mild wheat. The flavour falls away by the finish, leaving the alcohol flavour and warmth with just a little nutty sweetness. Low bitterness and a bit grainy as well. Creamy texture with fine carbonation and moderately dry. Not as heavy as expected and the body thins out considerably at the end of a sip.

The pear is there, along with tangy citrus (orange this time). No brandy character other than mild heat on the finish. The mouth feel is slick, and a little oily. Decent drinakbility.

These three flavors domintate, and leave little room for other flavors, but some fruits and toffee emerge in the finish, along with a bitterness that doesn't seem to be attributable to hops.

Some scents here remind of a Belgians as well as a light bready doughyness. Big fruits are in the flavor with ripe fruit sweetness mixes with a fairly strong tart. Some alcohol is evident. Good amount of bitterness and that Belgian note that was in the nose is in the flavor as well. A decent amount of bitterness as well. All this manages to mix together quite nicely in the end.

An aroma of malt, hops and brown sugar. The flavor was of malt, with a very sweet brown sugar aspect (though not as sweet as the original house version). It has a medium body, unlike the heavier house version. The finish is slightly tart. The house version was almost too heavy and sugary, but this could use a little more body.

Aroma was a bit restrained, but featured a whiff of alcohol, mandarin oranges, earthy yeast, wheat grain, coriander, and grassy hops. Mouthfeel was snappy, with a solid medium body, alcohol, and some hops bite. Alcohol is immediately apparent in the taste, but is not intrusive. Lots of fruity orange and apricot, white pepper and a note of coriander, earthy yeast, and a subdued hops presence that is grassy. Finish is dry and mildly bitter. Very different from a barleywine with its more assertive yeast presence and more restrained hop profile. A pleasant change of pace with the different grain bill.

Smooth and fairly creamy, medium moving into heavy, but not too thick. Just feels silky and luscious. It doesnt taste much like a 10 percenter. Taste of blackened toast, smooth hoppiness-not too bitter and yet they are strong. Cream sherry flavor is very strong after it warms a while. A lot of flavor is left in your mouth after each sip.

Honey caramel sweet up front, at moments it reminds me of a strong braggot. Then it flops over in to this funky sourdough tartness before bringing out the fruit with notes of juicy orange, a bit of pineapple and banana, maybe some late harvest purple grapes. Wheat character becomes more apparent as the Dole warms a bit and the beer almost takes on a bit of a Belgian character as the malt develops.

4.47,12.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"Similar mild lemon hits the tongue...Not really tart, but mildly tart I guess. Definitely lemon though -- really wheaty in that regard (which makes sense when you see that this is a "wheatwine"). Alcohol and warm toast slathered in honey and sprinkled with nutmeg. Sweet and forceful. Quite delicious.","marburg","Jan 15, 2004"
4.61,16.4,3.5,5,4.5,4,5,"This beer poured an orangish copper color with a small head that faded quickly. The lacing was there though. The nose of the beer was simply amazing! Probably the best smelling beer I have ever experienced. Something about it was very comforting, it reminded me of buttered toast with cinnamon and sugar piled on then a hint of alcohol. The taste was very similar to the smell but not quiet as good. Initially very bready it later became sweet then the two flavors mixed. Sweetness is akin to honey and caramel in my opinoin. Hops are low but provide a moderate base. Alcohol is strong and becomes stronger later on in the finish. Body warming sensation hits and I am warmed up on the cold Michigan winter nights. The only problem I have with this is that it is undercarbonated but otherwise this is one of the best beers I have had. I am extremely impressed with New Holland's last two new beers this and the Dragon's Milk.","granger10","Jan 13, 2004"

This isn't a beer that you say "oh it's interesting, but I wouldn't buy it again." I will buy this till there are none left and since it was such a small release I don't know if I'll get some.","Jables","Jan 10, 2004"
