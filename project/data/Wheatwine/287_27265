4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/13/2013. Pours very hazy deep gold color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big banana, apricot, pear, orange, apple, clove, wheat, bread, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of banana, apricot, pear, apple, orange, clove, wheat, bread, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of peppery spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, apricot, pear, orange, apple, wheat, bread, pepper, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice beer. More of a weizenbock in flavor; but has all around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt flavors; and is very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 20, 2014"

The carbonation and a slightly creamy texture compliment the malted wheat and yeast notes but overpower the spice and sweeter citrus notes. Slightly tart with strong hints of sourdough bread, bubblegum, wheat and banana countered by peppery coriander spice and zesty lemon peel. There's a touch of boozy sweetness in the finish but the high ABV is very well masked. Tastes more like a strong wheat beer/hefeweizen than a wheatwine. Light and pretty easy to drink but the carbonation hurts the mouthfeel/drinkability and the flavor profile is one dimensional. I would have preferred more spice and sweet citrus character to balance out the heavy yeast notes.","corby112","Dec 06, 2013"

Sweet bubblegum and banana aromas over some clove and coriander...pretty much your standard Hefeweizen aroma at first. As it warms up, a heavier honey and wheat bread element comes into play as does a pleasant floral quality. As the nose suggested, the taste is like an amped up Hefe: big, spicy clove and banana-like yeast flavors, powdered sugar, orange peel, cracked pepper, and some alcohol which warms up the finish. Creamy and dry medium body with a late tartness. Pretty sweet and certainly heavy on the yeast esters without much complimentary wheat flavor, which is a shame.

4.03,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of the style, I know there's two kind of Wheatwines, the ones that are similar to a Barleywine and there is some like this one which is more like an imperial Hefeweizen, both are nice, but i still tend to prefer the ones that are similar to Barleywines, but this is pretty good for what they i intended it to be. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, clean, the alcohol was hidden well and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these but it may start to be a little filling after that. What I liked the most about this beer was how well the alcohol was hidden, it would be hard for me to guess that this is really 8%. What I liked the least about this beer is that it's released in the fall, it's not a bad thing, but I think this beer would fit in better if it was released in the middle of summer, I think it would be a great warm weather beer. I would buy this beer again, I might pick a couple more bottles up before it's all gone and if they released it a again I would at least get one. I would recommend this to any wheat beer fan. All in all I was happy with this beer, I thought it was a nice take on the style and it's fairly different from most Wheatwines. Good job Bell's, I like that you guys are bringing back some of your beer that haven't been made in a while and I would love to see batch 8000 or 9000 released again.

4.15,7.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"The beer poured very thick into my glass with a gorgeous golden orange color in its body. The head of the beer came up to a nice three quarter inch, cream-colored, foam that held in the glass for over two minutes. Preliminary nasal investigations yielded strong scents of wheat malts. There were also very strong scents of citrus fruits, most likely lemon and orange, as well as nice hints of ripe banana. Further scent based research discovered notes of coriander and cloves. The first taste has a huge burst of flavor, at first it is a little overpowering, but then it subsides into a very pleasant beverage. The opening tastes in the glass are strong wheat malts with a hint of barley malt to back it up, a moderate flavor of clove, and a slight citrus zest, almost if someone has scraped the peel of a lemon into the bottle. The beer definitely had some kick to it, though the flavors balanced out the alcohol nicely. Further down the glass, the head dissipated into a thin film around the top of the beer, however the carbonation stayed at a nice moderate stream through the whole glass. At first, you are overwhelmed with the strong wheat malts, with little kicks of various flavors. A few sips into the glass, strong notes of lemon and clove appear. Later in the glass, a nice banana-like flavor develops along with notes of pepper and coriander. The glass ends with sweet notes of honey and even suggestions of nuts, maybe almonds or hazelnut.","KingNoonan","Aug 31, 2007"
3.75,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a rich copper hue with a white one finger head that quickly dies down to a thin layer which lasts throughout. Stickiness doesn't exactly exist, but I'm not entirely sure if it is supposed to for this style. Smell is a yeasty aroma mixed with fruits, almost like a Belgian style. A full burst of grapes seems to emerge most, I guess that's where the "wine" part of the style comes from, maybe? Taste is once again fruity; apples, grapes, lemon, grapefruit, and pears. A bit of caramel malt comes forward towards the end, balances it out quite qell...in a unique sort of way. Mouthfeel is medium to full and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Not a style I entirely enjoy, but glad I had the opportunity. Probably won't seek out this style again, but glad I gave it a shot. Definitely something worth trying. If I had to pick one word to describe this beer, it would have to be "interesting".","BeerTruth","Aug 30, 2007"

I don't know how long a beer of this type is usually supposed to last, but for not being that fresh it tastes pretty damn good...I got this in Philadelphia, where Bell's doesn't even distribute, and I figured it would be a little aged. This may explain the almost total lack of head (?)....The beer is a dark gold/light brown color and has a strong and appealing orange smell. Maybe I'm biased at the moment because I made dinner involving oranges, but I think it's there. The wheat flavor in the beer is fully present without being too mealy, and there's a little bit of spice as well. There's a little bit of sourness in the aftertaste that I don't find terribly appealing, but this may be due to the age and doesn't really detract from the overall flavor. This isn't my favorite Bell's offering, but it would be in their interest to bring this beer back again, I think.","kundabuffer","May 28, 2007"

It smells sweet and fruity, like apricots and oranges, and also like yeast, grain/wheat and some peppery spicyness. The taste is pretty much the same way it smells. It's more sweet than bitter, and it also has a honey, clove and banana taste. Mouthfeel is medium/full with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's smooth and and a bit syrupy.

The taste is really great - banana sweetness, some citrus notes, and a mellow bread-like finish. Mouthfeel is crisp due to the moderate level of carbonation - quite refreshing & almost chewy.

A beautiful amber orange with Bell's trademark sediment in perfect suspension. About a fingers worth of slightly beige tinted head that wittles down to a thin, coastal foam. The nose is full of apricots, a little bit of banana, perhaps some corriander, and some alcohol. Smells like I'm getting into something good here. This almost tastes like a tripel. Wow, lots of smooth, soft fruity esters coming through. I detected some apples in there as well as the fruits in the aroma. The medium body transports the flavors from the front of the mouth all the way to the back with a trailing wind of warm alcohol. This stuff is frickin' fantastic...I've never had anything like this.

Medium in body, the alcohol presence is spot on for me, it comes thru nice and spicy and warm in the finish and shows itself in just the right amounts.

3.74,-3.4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My first ever wheat wine pour, from this 12 oz. brow bottle acquired from BA CRJMellor during a recent trade, started out clear and pale yellow, until the yeast came out and clouded up the whole beer and made it look opaque and orange-ish in color. The head was relatively modest to begin with, and was shortly reduced to a collar of bubbles. The smell was very intoxicating, with an abundance of cloves, bananas, and oranges. The taste was a cross between a hefeweizen and a barleywine. The sweet fruity phenols were typical of a hefeweizen in their bready and tropical profile. The hop bitterness lingering in the back and the hint of prickly alcohol were reminiscent of a mild barleywine. The two flavor profiles were a little disparate, and the clashing they created prevented from reaching harmonious balance. If there had been other flavors that occupied the middle ground between the sweetness and bitterness, this would have melded better. Mouthfeel was sticky, but not too thick. An enjoyable beer despite the little flaws, and makes me want to explore this style further, but there arent too many of these around.","rajendra82","Jan 30, 2006"

I tasted smooth floral hops, banana, a hint of carmel and a ton of wheat. Its not bubly like a Hefe-weiss but rather flat and thicker. It has a nice kick in the aftertaste. For me this is a sipper.

At that, the color of a rusty orange with medium opague cloudiness. Smells fruity and mildly spicy with a defying malt structure, and lightly smokey. Tastes of balanced malt and wheat. Very yeasty and bready in taste and texture. Cloves, banannas, and confectionate sugar sell the spiciness and softness. A light smoke flavor persists durring the drink. Finishes soft and mildly sweet. A smooth beer for a big abv.

There's a pleasant orange sweetness that permeates the flavour and carries through into the finish. Apple is still present, but less obvious than in the aroma. Caramel, spice, and light alcohol warmth are all present. Bready yeast character lingers. Off-dry with a medium body, very creamy. Well-integrated carbonation composed of very fine bubbles. This is really quite good and is certainly the crown jewel of the Bell's wheat series. It's really a completely different beer compared to the rest of the group.

Also a slight hint of alcohol.

The comparison doesn't end there either. This has some similar notes in both smell and taste to a traditional German hefeweizen. The banana and clove are both there for sure, as is the soft pillowy mouthfeel. Of course there are some differences. For one, the citrus aspect of this beer stands out. It's there in the smell, but where it really becomes apparent is in the finish. In fact, it becomes TOO apparent. After awhile, all I can taste is a distinct lime aftertaste which really becomes too pronounced. But despite that being a big problem, that's my only complaint about this beer. I love the yeasty wheaty goodness and the caramelly malt flavor before the aftertaste hits. And the aroma is extremely inviting, as the lime is more subtle to the nose.

Tangy wheat, and cloves dominate the sip, while a warming alcohol feeling is present during the finish and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, and creamy, with perfect carbonation.

Alcohol is also evident in the aroma, and slightly in the flavor. You can tell there has been an abbey-style yeast at work here with the warm and complex flavors and aromas. Somewhat light bodied.

A little sweet in overall flavor, like very sweet peach jam. A little bit of flinty slate bitterness catches at the back of the throat and balances the beer out at the close. As with other Bell's Wheats, the yeast signature is a bit strange, but it works OK on this one.
