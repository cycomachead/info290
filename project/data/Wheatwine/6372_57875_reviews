"This is my first wheatwine, so I've rated it fairly similarly to a barleywine. Age has treated this well, with the flavors much less harsh and no signs of oxidation. It must have been reasonably hopped when freshed considering the amount of bitterness present, but no aroma/flavor carried through. Fairly well-balanced for such a big beer. I really wish I didn't forget about this one for so long and got to try it earlier (or even better, bought more!)"

"Fort Collins Wheat Wine is a wheat wine that reminds me of a lighter English Barley wine - not being a hop head I like that. The ale is an easy drinker for the style. Goes well with BBQ potato chips."

"Overall: Not overly impressed with this one. it has some very good qualities but i think it bit off more than it can chew"

"Hands down the best best brew I've had from Ft Collins and a tasty wheatwine in its own right. A sweet fruity boozy treat that I think would only get better over time."
"A solid clear copper color with a fair off-white ring on top and reasonable signs of lacing. The aroma brings on a beautiful pine-malt blend with caramel popcorn sweetness. Very nice. The flavor delivers nutty evergreen and caramel malt with a general hemp-like overtone. Grainy and a hint of booziness that doesn't interfere at all. Carbonation is moderate, body is pretty close to full and the feel is pretty heavy and viscous, but ""liquid"". A very tasty brew and easily recommended!"

"Notes: I wasn't blown away by this beer. Flavors fell flat for me and didn't inspire me to drink more. Not exactly cloying, but sweet, sticky, and alcoholic. I would recommend treating this like a brandy and have someone (or someones) to share this with for a dessert/nightcap/etc."
"A typical kind of US beer - some nice flavours but not quite big and impressive and idiosyncratic enough. Almost as if the flavours are thrown together without them quite knowing what to do with them."
"This beer is too sweet and could use some more hops. Akin to an imperial red less the hops."
"Overall: Reminds me of an English barleywine with not as heavy of a body. I don't get much in the way of weizenbock/dark wheat fruit flavors, more caramel. Still quite a tasty beer even if it wasn't quite what I was expecting."
"Eh. It's ok, but it really needs some sort of purpose, and it doesn't have it. It makes me wonder why I'm drinking it, and that's never a really good sign."

"Poured into an imperial nonic a reich deep bronze with a large sticky white head that left a broken ring of lace as it settled very slowly,grear clarity and definition to the beer.alcohol dipped dark fruit in the nose along with some nuttiness,it has a alcohol dipped fruit cake kind of aroma to it.Sweet alcohol and dark fruit on the palate with a great creamy feel.I like this beer more than most of the others who have reviewed it,it's a bit boozy but it is true to form in my opinion."
"O: really drinks nicely, not harsh at all, nice taste notes 4"
"Not sure about the 'wine' labeling, as this full-bodied ale has little to do with either wine or barley wine, but offers exceptional body, balance and flavor from a wheat-based brew, and is the best and most flavorful I have tasted from wheat in a full ale-style. I would highly recommend this both as an ale and for its novelty if you can find it, as I have been informed by my retailer that it is no longer available or being made?"

"O- This beer is delicious but, honestly, it's closer to an IPA or barleywine due to the high bitterness and lack of wheat flavor, so points are lost as a result."

"Smooth wheat, pear and dried apricot, slight perceptible alcohol. Medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation, a little tacky or sticky in the finish. Slightly rough around the edges, but tastes decent. Surprised to see the higher ABV listed here. Probably best shared."
"great, great beer. kinda reminds me of a low IBU barleywine. not alot of the bready wheat flavors i expected, unless much residual sweetness is a definition of wheat ale."

"Overall- This one has the nose of a decent doppelbock and the flavors of a toasted malt and dark fruit barleywine with bittering hops getting in the way just a little bit. Small things stand in the way of this affordable wheatwine ale."
""
"Overall: This beer is hard to judge. Many flavors and everyone seems to perceive them differently. A nice brew."
"This was a pretty good experience. I'm glad to try this new style. Thank you FCB."
"O- Nice wheat beer, not too intense, and has a great all around flavor that is slightly unique"
"O: The beer isn’t overly difficult to drink considering its strength; however the taste seems rather bland and isn’t that interesting."
"I rather like this one. I think its taste is right on for the style. Could use some refining in other areas, but this is a nice wheatwine."
"Not in love with this one, doubtfull I would go for it again."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. It's quite quaffable and uncomplicated. Not something I would go after too frequently, and you need to watch the ABV because it sneaks up on you. But I would definitely buy it again for a change of pace."
"Beer is thin and super dry at the finish. This is where I got confused because this isn't a barleywine. It is sweet at the get go but the midpalate flavors fall flat and flounder a bit, nothing going on in the back except this astringent grainy acidity and cotton mouth. Harsh all around."
"Pours a clear bright light copper color with a moderately-thick off-white head. Doesn't last long, falling to a thin ring. Some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose is pretty sweet with some light cherry and a bit of caramel. Has a good amount of bitterness from the start in the flavor, as well as some light pit-type fruits and a bit of malty sweetness. Light amount of booze--not too much. Heavy bitterness starts to take over a bit. Really dry finish. Flavor doesn't have enough character and the body isn't big enough, but American Barleywine seems to be the closest fit."
"Personally I could use a little more maltiness to balance out the hops and alcohol, but seeing as how wheat isn't nearly as chewy as barley, I suppose that means this is decent for the style. Even still, I enjoyed this and would happily drink it again."
"O: I have to admit I am not familiar with wheat wine, but if this is indicative of the style, I think I will try different ones."
"O: This is an easy drinking Wheat Wine and it has a great aroma. Missing a little bit in the taste department, otherwise a nice example of the style."
"O- Overall, I wasn't impressed with this beer. It just seems like it was missing a lot of malt and the alcohol dominated the taste."
"I thought this might be a really interesting beer. I was wrong. It tasted more like a Miller Lite wanting to be a barleywine. I don't know, I guess I saw what they were aiming for, but they were quite far away. There isn't much to this beer except for a decent abv and a taste similar to some not so well prepared grainy soup served cold. I'm being a bit harsh, but I was let down especially for the money I threw away on it. Do yourself get a 4 pack of uintas barleywine for the same price as 22oz of this crap. Or do yourself a better one if you want something great get jw lees harvest ale. dont try this guy."
"Fort Collins Wheat Wine Ale is a fairly standard version of the style, circa 2010/2011 America. If you're a fan of high-octane, primarily pale-malted beer, take the plunge. Besides, $6.99 is unlikely to break the bank."
"Bomber pours brilliantly clear copper with off white head. The aroma is light and fruity and just as much fusel like notes as anything else. The taste is pretty sweet with malty and fruitiness coming from plums, cherries and raisins with mild to somehow harsh booziness around the edges. Pretty nice albeit young brew. I think I need to age some."
"D - This is the first wheatwine that I've been able to try. I thought there would be a large difference between a wheatwine and a barelywine, but there doesnt appear to be much aside from the mouthfeel. I'll have to try some other wheatwine style beers before I can fully grade this beer."
"Mouthfeel is okay, but in my opinion too thin for the size of the malt bill and alcohol. I'd prefer a real barleywine, and for the most part, think I can say I don't need this again. But it's an interesting take on an unusual style, and it turns out pretty well."
"No need to beat a dead horse."
"Had this one on tap at Oskar Blues Liquids and Solids in Longmont yesterday. Poured a rich medium amber color, with a little light tan head. Aromas of caramel, candied apples and light brown sugar. Full bodied and syrupy on the palate, way too sweet, with candied apples, caramel and booze. Disappointing."
"For a beer with a 50% wheat malt bill, it does surprise me that there's a minimal amount of traditionally wheat flavors, though. Still, I like it."
"Color is clear reddish amber with noticeable carbonation. Fair head retention. Sweet aroma of apples and caramel. Very, very soft up front. Almost no carbonation evident. Alcohol in the middle, but not as hot as a barley wine. Very sweet, almost Scottish ale like. Smooth finish. Bitterness builds after the finish. Very rich body. Definitely a winter drink."
"It pours a clear ruby topped by a nice finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, light toffee, earthy hops, flowers, light fusels, coriander, and nutmeg. The taste is a strong dichotomy of peppery toffee and flowery orange peel. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a decently solid wheatwine, though it is lacking in complexity and the two flavor groups seem to clash a bit. Despite that, it keeps me wanting more and coming back for it."
"Aroma is fruity and a little yeasty/wheaty, not strong but still appealing. It pours a beautiful dark golden amber with a substantial, fluffy white head that leaves some decent lacing. Flavor - WOO HOO, has it got an alcohol bite to it! Other than that, it tastes more like an ale than a wheat beer, fruity, malty and a little bit yeasty. Texture is smooth as soy milk with a subtle but long-lasting tingle."
"Notes: Wow, you know - some beers can surprise you. This one smells great and like a thick chewy monster, but on the palate its really light and mostly a let down. Smuttynose set the bar really high for this style, I think. I've loved just about everything else from FCB, but this is disappointing. Bummer."
" D- This beer has a muted flavor but what is there is pleasant just a bit bland. I was hoping for more depth or more richness in a wheat wine but it just wasn't there."
"D: meh. couldn't finish a glass."
"Mouth feel is not that carbonated and slightly drying. Alcohol is warming. This beer might benefit from aging."
"This is full in body and taste. Definitely a good sipper and one to appreciate."
"I like wheat wines, but...I don't love them. Rather have a real barley-wine, thank you very much, but this is a welcome twist. Easy on the palate, plump with palpable flavor. Rich and rewarding. Mmmm, mmm."
"Pretty good. More of an American Barleywine. I don't get any wheat character here. Though it is still a good beer. Something that is worth a try."
"D: Enjoyable, but far from the best in the style. Worth a try."
"I loved drinking this and felt it was a great representation of the style. Wish it was locally available in Boston. I will continue my exploration of this style."
"D- Good drinkability, perfect style for splitting with friends and sipping on. Not a session brew obviously, too strong ABV wise and too strong a flavor profile for all night drinking. A great food pairing beer, perhaps a savory pork chop or ribeye drenched in A1?"
"D-Pretty easy drinking for a higher ABV beer. I really like the fact that it's it got that distinct barleywine flavor profile but it's a lighter, toned down version."
"This was a style I had never tried before and so I was very compelled to give it a shot and I was not dissapointed. It pours a clear reddish copper with a thin fizzy cream colored head. The nose is loaded with sweet citrus, caramel, malts and orange. The palate was bready but not yeasty, very viscous mouthfeel that kinda coats your mouth with sweet malts. The hops show throgh in the finish contrasting the sweetness of the wheat yet it finishes firm and a little hot."
"D: Less wheat than wine. Mouthfeel is a downfall and flavor is less complex than it could be."
"drinkability is good with this being on the lighter side of the style and still packs a punch"
"Overall, lots of different notes here, but they don't play well together and aren't much to my liking."
