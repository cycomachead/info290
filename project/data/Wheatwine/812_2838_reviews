"Sweet rich malty fruitiness with hints of spice bread and hints of sherry like oxidation. Nice sipper but headed down the other side of the bell curve."
""
"O: Nice spicy, hoppy wheat wine. Hoppiness keeps this one from being too one-note and bland. This really isn't far from a big american barleywine if I'm honest (like Bigfoot). Just extra wheaty I suppose. Tasty."

"Very bold without getting in our faces too much, this is a massive ale, but that’s expected for this style … a style that is still being defined. Cheers to Marin Brewing Co. for not hopping the crap out of this Wheatwine; the massive malt backbone is the showcase from the first sip to the last drop."

"Well obviously I suck at reviewing wheatwines because I'm not pulling much out of this guy besides an all encompassing citrus and alcohol. I like it overall. Need more wheatwines apparently. kojevergas...thanks bud!"

"Overall, this is a good beer, but didn't blow me away. A solid beer if you're looking for something different."

"O: The banana aspect to it is interesting and well on this side of overwhelming. I'd appreciate a bit more complexity but it's totally satisfying. More of a tripel than a wheat."
""

"Quite drinkable if you like a strong wheat flavor. Much less sweet and hoppy than typical barley wines. Reminds me of the honey flavor of mead. From the 22 oz bottle."

"An interesting beer to drink, not sure if it would be a ""go-to"" but if it's on the menu and you got the cash, go for it."
"This is one hefty, lovely, sweet, complex mofo of a brew, & just how a wheatwine should taste. A standard-bearer for the style, this is one of the best examples I've had to date & an excellent all-around beer."

"Overall a good beer, and certainly the best of the few examples I've had of the style."
"Boozy, but also quite sweet and tasty."
"Had to pick this up at the Novato, CA Bevmo as I cannot get it across the Bay. Snifter pour and I am met with a hazy apricot colored ale and a nice fluffy cream colored foamy head. The aroma consists of butterscotch, dried apricots, slight orange and a hint of alcohol in each whiff. The taste is fruity...almost like biting into a juicy fruit. A blast of bitterness and sweetness are produced together. The label states it is ""sherry-like"" and I do not disagree. There are some wheat-ish characteristics (which is to be expected) but very subdued. There is also a dull grapefruit aftertaste that stays on the tongue. Mouthfeel is relatively smooth. Overall I wish I could get this closer to home but it is definitely worth the scenic drive to bring a few bottles home. This may be a little too sweet for some, but it is a refreshing change to the mass of beers produced. Great beer."
"Pours a hazy honey orange color with a 1 inch whitish-orange head that fades to a thin cap. Nice foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruits (especially oranges), orange juice, and some honey notes. Taste is of citrus zest, orange juice, and honey flavors. Very nice smells and tastes with this one. There is a slightly acidic quality that hits in the back of the throat. This beer is crisp and smooth with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer and the first wheatwine I have ever had. I think this is a really tasty beer and I will definitely get more of these going forward."
"O - Not bad, probably one of the better wheatwine's I've had, but the bar really wasn't set that high. Glad I got to try this one."
"aroma is earthy, hints of honey, bready notes, touches of light grass and a pear like fruit note. nothing really coming out at me as being terribly strong. flavor was somewhat similar with a light earthy taste and a smooth and even profile, but just nothing really breaking through on me as being out of the ordinary. light grape flavor in the finish with a honey like flavor left on the palate."
"Star Brew Triple Wheat Ale pours an absolutely pristine clear orange. A hard pour results in about four fingers of bone colored head. Retention is alright, but lacing is practically nonexistent. The beer smells exactly like candied orange peel. There's a nonspecific sweetness that plays nicely against the zesty citrus hop notes. The flavor takes that basic profile and just refines it. What was a general sugary sweetness can now be described as a healthy dose of honey, with just a swirl of caramel to keep things interesting. It's enough to take the bite off of any bitterness from the hops and leave things open for the finish. Orange is joined by suggestions of grapefruit and lemon, as well as some pale fruits that. There's also a subtle, but definite heat from alcohol on the back end. It's not loud enough to ruin my enjoyment the beer, but is enough to keep it from being truly great. The body is nice and middle of the road, neither especially rich nor thin. The carbonation though barely registers, and results in the beer coming across as a bit syrupy. Star Brew Triple Wheat Ale is a slightly different drinking experience, and one that's somewhat enjoyable despite its slight flaws."
"O - A solid brew and I would be happy to have it again. However, I feel it is a few notches below a ""world-class"" beer."
"(22oz bottle). Pours slightly hazy with a pillow-top off-white foam. Nice carbonation. Aroma has some cardboard, grape? or something fruity, grass and something that smells like horseradish. Taste is sweet with some light hop bitterness. The beer is a bit hot-I think that’s where the horseradish or whatever it is is coming from. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Smooth, but hot. A decent beer with some nice flavors going on."
"Pours an orange color with bubbles constantly rising so that's a good sign. High lacing with grapefruit aromas. Notes of orange on the tongue after the alcohol burn wears off which is about 2 seconds. If it weren't for the burn I'd swear I was drinking orange soda. At 9.2% this is a good sipper since the fruity aspects hide that."
"Hazy golden hue with two finger white head. Sweet, sugar, alcohol aromas. There's some sherry wine aroma in there too. There's some wood aroma, too. Wood soaked in sherry. The sherry flavors dominate this rather smooth concoction. Nice, mild carbonation. Smooth, tropical fruit (melon) flavors as well. The mouthfeel is a little thick, but not as much as previous batches. Unfortunately, there's no bottle date. I've had this beer before and this particular bottle seems rather tame. Usually the sherry/wine flavors are too strong, this is actually pretty damn good. It's not sticky. The malt comes through pretty good, almost like burnt grain, but not smokey. The wine and melon flavors are a really good combination. For such a big beer, this one is really mellow. Good for sipping, I'd like to buy another one and age."
"Heavy and sweet, but very delectable. Recommended."
"Drinkability - This is definitely a sipping beer. I find myself with a good buzz after the first half of my 22oz bomber. The flavors are much more complex than you'd expect from the average wheat beer. Definitely a beer you should try, especially considering the modest price."
"d: Frankly I had given up on wheatwines. Looking over my reviews I only seemed to like one example that I've tried. And I didn't like the next years version nearly as well. Thanks to BeerRun13 for restoring my faith, this is a gem."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey golden color with generous white head. Nose has a bit of alcohol snap to it, but otherwise has some pepper and bready notes. Sugary dessert flavors are noted on the palate, also reminds me of cardamom and cookies. Alcohol presence is again noted, though it is still syrupy and enjoyable. Finish is sweet and herbal."
"Good beer but a bit harsh. Bright, transparent, yellow-gold with a small white head. Lots of sugary malt, mild wheat spice, a bit of caramel. Flavor is a tad sweet, boozy and bitter. Also, rich and finishes fairly clean and dry. Not nearly as sticky as it could be. Pretty good beer and I can see raising my scores in the future. I'd recommend giving it some time in the glass to warm up and lose some carbonation."
"Pours a nice, lightly cloudy amber color, with a nice little off-white head. Very nice aromas of sweet malt, wheat, honey and pears. On the palate, this one has a very nice, full-flavored sweetness, with a light touch of hops, along with toffee, butterscotch and a very nice alocohol heat. A very sweet beer, thick and rich, but pleasant to drink. Another very good effort from Marin."
"Beer is full bodied and it is sweet but its not as sweet as I expected. It is thick and there isn't much carbonation in the mouth but its all pretty good. Bitterness is low, I'm not sure if I would get this again but its pretty balanced and not cloying at all. Pretty good for a wheat wine."
"Poured a deep golden and cloudy yellow, good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is wheat, malt and fruits, nothing to appealing. Taste is sweet, malty, wheat and sordove bland. it. Mouthfeel is ok, a bit syrupy, booze, wheat but I did not find it impressive nor very drinkable."
"D- For the ABV, high... one of the tighter and more 'together' wheatwines I've ever had. Really worth seeking out. I sipped it slowly, and really enjoyed it."
"The Marin Brewing Co. Star Brew Triple Wheat pours a dark honey (borderline copper) color in the glass with a creamy off white froth, great lacing, & good retention. Complex aromas of caramel, citrus hops, honey, freshly made wheat bread, some rye bread, sherry, butter, some chocolate, & some dark berries. To be honest, there is probably more here that I'm not getting, but I can tell you that I keep getting more every time I smell this beer & it's pretty damn good! There are all of the characteristics on the palate that were discovered on the nose with an amazingly creamy texture & a bit of unbalanced alcohol on the finish. Overall, this is a fantastic beer that easily exceeded my expectations! Highly recommendation!"
"4/4.5/4/3.5/4.5"
"The color is a light golden yellow, clear with lots of suspended articles. The head is solid white foam with substantial lacing. The aroma brings briney malt caramel with a slight herbal hop. There's lemon and oats and malt, barleywine and alcohol is pretty notable to the tongue. Full bodied and mildly carbonated. I get some fruit nougat and buttery biscuit. Very tasty but a bit intense, not a session brew. Quite unique, very recommendable."
"Rather sweet and ""raw"" tasting. My first example of the style - but if this is indicative I would recommend sticking to barleywine..."
"Pours clear copper with off white head. The aroma is rich maltiness, a moderate hint of wheat and additional malt notes. After a few more draws I started to notice mild dark fruity esters and some alcohol heat. The taste has a syrupy sweet start (as it should) with some mild pine hops followed by sweet malts, some wheated malts and persistent sweet maltiness. Nice tasting brew with a pleasing load of malts and not much on the hop side of things."
"Drinkability- Very nice.."
"This is a great wheatwine, probably the best I've had to date. The taste is well balanced and not too sweet, which is something I don't often say when talking about this style. Very drinkable despite the relatively hefty ABV."
"Nice character and balance with a medium to medium/heavy body. Very assertive flavors. Creamed coffee and carmel in the longer finish. Nice. Perhaps drinks a bit sweet for some but tastes of quality and character, nonetheless. I almost see this as more of a dessert beer than a ""food"" beer."
"Highly recommend this beer, easily my favorite that the guys/gals at Marin have put together."
"Overall an extremely awesome beer from a quality brewing company who has been in the game for a long time."
"Drinkability is ok. My second 'wheatwine', drastically different then the smutty, which to me was really no different then a barelywine. This one is like BW mixed with lemon juice, but not in a nice and funky lambic way. Might age well but not digging it now, although it certainly is unique!"
"In short, this was a great beer. I had no expectations, but I really loved this beer. Great flavors and highly enjoyable. I will be buying more of this."
"Very balanced. Subdued hops and the alcohol is well hidden. Lacking much complexity though."
"Looking forward to a visit to this brewery at this years AHA conference in June."
"Easily drinkable because it's not heavy but the flavor didn't impress me at all. My girlfriend actually liked this brew better than I did so after drinking what I could, I gave her the remains of my half."
"Drinkability: It is very pleasant to drink. A bit high in alcohol and I can feel it, but that won't stop me from finishing the whole bomber!"
"Drinkability: I'm going to buy more of this. ISO: Wheatwines (half kidding - I need to give up trading for a bit). I could easily imagine myself drinking this until I passed out. Sweetness and bitterness battle back and forth throughout the sesh, neither one giving up any ground. Great balance. This totally exceeded expectations! (...which were high anyway)"
"D: one bottle is enough for me. it is a great brew to share with a couple of people."
"Hooray. After having those two Ridgeways, it was a relief to drink this. Pours cloudy amber-orange. Big off-white head. Caramel, dates, figs, wheat, honey, and bread/dough in the nose. Hops and dough in the taste, with that nice barleywine caramel mixing nicely with the wheat. Citrus and sugar in the finish. The alcohol is well-masked. A great beer."
"D: A big sweet, bready, 10% wheatwine isn't a typical session beer, but the balance between sweet, bitter, and alcohol keeps me coming back to my glass. A beer I would be interested in revisiting in the future."
"D: Eh... Its a good beer according to style but my personal taste says that its not something I really care for. But overall I wouldn't call this a bad beer."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Notes: Great stuff here, expertly balanced and surprisingly drinkable for the style. At less than $5 for a 22 oz bottle, it's hard to go wrong here."
"D: The only wheatwine I've had, this is the 2nd time I've had this Marin brew. A tasty beer, definitely a barleywine with a wheat perspective, quite good in its style, extremely bready and alcoholic."
"It's my first wheatwine, so I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Reminded me of a drier eisbock, so it wasn't totally different from beer I've had before."
"D - Easy to drink but might get a little cloying as the night goes on."
"Drinkability: Quite fruity and quite good. Sure, I'd have another!"
"drinkability is great. really enjoying this one. nice malt depth. excellent balance. smooth and very enjoyable. thanks dave!"
"Pours a cloudy amber, lots of chunkies floating inside, thick white head forms, settles down to a thin ring, big bubbles, thin layers, looks pretty good. Smell is sweet, caramel, bread, wheat, grapefruit, floral, tangerine, brown sugar, really nice. Taste is awesome, greats malt, toffee, raisiny, grapefruit, vanilla, wheat, rich caramel flavour in the finish, older bottle so the hops have mellowed, but nice floral and grapefruity, balanced finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth, very good. Thanks Russ!"
"Big barleywine smells of dates and rye bread on top of lighter, banana and citrus fruit. A little boozy but mostly inticingly rich malt-bomb goodness. Some hints of butter and cashews. Taste is glorious. Full-bodied with a big hoppy kick. As this is the first wheatwine I've tried, I don't know how it compares to others. But it reminds me of a good barleywine or a strong American ale. Definitely pick this one up if you see it!"
"Drinkability is good on this one. The alcohol is a bit noticeable in the taste but not too much. This is my first wheat wine, and I definitely wouldn't mind trying another."
"after review: I didn't notice that this was 10%, it drinks incredibly smooth for a ten percent beer, amazing!"
"The aroma of this brew was pretty drab and I wish that the ample hop character from the flavor had shown up some in the nose. An enjoyable brew; I want to say that this is overly simplistic, but that is what a wheat-wine is; clean wheat and malt flavors with a varying level of hop character. Still this is definitely lacking something; it needs a bit more character before I could really, really enjoy it."
"D- You definitely get a ""fortified"" feel from this beer and the 10%abv is well-masked (but not surprising), I am not a huge fan of this style, but I really like this Super Wheat Ale and would definitely pick this up again in the future for a post-dinner/cold evening/barleywine-esque situation. I do not have much experience with Marin's selection, but this beer makes me want to go try more of their lineup, a truly unique and complex ale that breaks all the molds for this style. . . ."
"2006 version. Poured golden with a thin head and okay lacing. The smell is slightly sweet with fresh wheat, banana, and wax. Tast is similar. More fresh wheat, somewhat grainy, banana, citrusy hops, waxy fruit- maybe cherry or apple. The mouthfeeel is substantial, slightly slick but creamy. You do't taste the alcohol in this one even though it is quite high in abv. This one is quite big for a wheat beer and definitely worth a try. I'd like to try it fresher and see if its even bolder and spicier."
"This is only my fifth wheat wine, but Star Brew Triple Wheat Ale is the best that I've had so far. It's a remarkable achievement that newcomers to the style owe it to themselves to try. Don't be surprised if it becomes your new gold standard. One delicious bomber (and counting) tells me that it's mine."
"This one looked good right off the pour - bright gold with a light haze, a tight white head, good retention, and sticky lacing. The aroma was dominated by citrusy hops, on the orange side, but as it warmed the malt came through with hints of wheat, bready crust and cereal grains. It had a solid bitterness, citrusy hop flavour, some toasted cereal, fruit, and a spicy alcohol finish. The aftertaste brought forward a piney character that wasn't apparent until that point. The carbonation was very fine and quite creamy, lower than expected. Full bodied with a pleasing texture, a bit of stickiness, and mild warmth. Overall, a very well made beer. Easy drinking and quite mellow for a big boy. I'd like to have a few more of these for the cellar so I'd never be without a high quality wheat wine."
"Highly recommended. A unique style and one I wouldn't mind seeing some more examples of. And to think, I was wary of trying this one again."
"Pours yellowy gold and very clear with a small white head that recedes quickly. Aroma is soft honey sweetness, hints of prunes and ripe fruit. Hints of sweet citrus in the aroma as well. Taste is also fruity, some very subtle citrus, with a nice nutty wheatiness that develops mid taste and lingers into the aftertaste. Medium to heavy in body, decent bitterness and a good sized drying mixes with a slightly sweet and cloying finish. Alcohol is very well balanced but evident in the taste. An easy to sip beer, very subtle aroma and taste wise, nothing reaches out and grabs you. The wheat presence is most evident in the taste and is quite nice."
"Drinkability: More hoppy, but as strong as i am used to. Very good. Thanks Zorro."
"Flavor is fairly sweet overall with some white grape and melon mixing with a dash of honey and then rolls to a bit of booziness. Not really hot but more wine like. Finishes with a bit of peppery spice. A sipping beer in my opinion."
"Thanks, BeerRun13"
"An interesting and enjoyable sipping brew. Definitely worth trying."
"D: This is nice. Lots of subtle flavors at work...I bet this beer would be good with sushi. Alcohol is well hidden"
"D- It is a very good and different (at least for me) brew. I like it a lot and would like to try others from the style. It is a sipper though at 10%."
"D - very drinkable! A well done example in the growing number of choices in this category. If it's in your local market buy it! This one is a great choice as winter is coming around!"
"This is one I may not have found without seeing it on somebody's trading want's list... glad I found it, as I'll revisit this one more often."
"D: For 9.2 alcohol it isnt noticeable in the taste but u can feel it. Highly drinkable beer, I could see using this to quench myself on a hot summer afternoon, or to warm up on a cold winter night, a really tasty and versatile beer."
"No prior biases, thanks awaisen from California. Good aroma, left by C hop. Well hopped taste, good white head. Very smooth drink of wheat, not very complex, very present orange citrus. The alcohol was high and hitting you at the end. Good full mouthfeel. Not too sweet, but well malted very drinkable."
"Overall: $4.53 a bottleworth every cent and more. I have grown to *love* the Marin Star Brew <insert number> Triple Wheat Ale, and always pick up a couple of bottles each year. An annual favorite that, despite its reported lower ABV from last year, is still a damned fine and tasty brew - well worth seeking out! I just wish theyd bring back the screen printed bottle."
"Oh yeah...while I might not notice the alcohol in the taste so much, I definitely feel it's effects."
"Poured from the 22oz bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. A darker golden body is topped by about an inch of sturdy, creamy white head that leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Not a whole lot of aroma - light caramel malt, a touch of dark fruit, some grassy hops, and a generous whiff of alcohol. Palate is light mellow wheat and malt, becoming sweeter towards the finish. A moderate hop profile holds notes of sweet plum, grass, and a touch of pine. Body is velvety smooth, with very light, mellow carbonation - just beautiful. Although the high alcohol content makes it a tricky proposition to tackle an entire bottle, this is a highly enjoyable beer. Find a friend to share it with."
"Beer is good. Happy big beering."
"Overall- Didn't expect much from this beer so I really had quite a treat. Never having had a wheat wine, I can't compare to other beers in the style, but I can say that I will be trying more within this style when I get the chace. Really a delicious brew that is worth seeking out."
"This is a very solid beer from a great NorCal brewery. I've only had a few wheat wines in my day, but this one was at the top."
"Notes: This beer definitely does not taste like it could be 10%. The fruitiness is pleasant, but maybe a little over the top. And I wish it finished a tiny bit dryer. But overall it was nice and easy to drink."
"Drinkability- Because of it's sweetness, it's not an everyday beer or even close to any kind of session beer. Probably a really good beer to have every once and a while though. Went particularly well with my homemade spicy basil beef and vegatable samosas."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability - nice amount of carbonation and left a little bit of bitterness at the end. I am not a giant fan of the brew, but it is good if you want to pack a little bit of punch into your day due to the high alcohol content in the brew. I would get it again and I have had it more than once already."
"D: It is definitely drinkable, though if not for the high alcohol content I would not likely waste my time on it. It is a good beer to get your grilfriend started on appreciating stronger beers though."
"Very hazy light copper color topped by a thin white head that receded quickly into the glass. The nose has some bubblegum, a little touch of biscuit, backed by a lemony citrus character. The taste has a quick punch of bubblegum, followed very quickly by herbal hop and mild citrus. Hard candy character on the finish along with a bit of alcohol heat. Mildly sticky mouth feel. OK drinkability. Interesting beer, but Im not sure how many of these I could drink."
"Hazy tangerine juice in color, assuming tangerine juice is made. Large, creamy white head with good density for such a big beer. Smells of apricots and papayas soaked in diluted vodka. Taste is fruit-filled, strongly alcoholic with notes of banana peels and honey covered apricots. Not very good. Cloying & malt liquorish."
"Flavor is not as strikingly complex, yet yields more and more nuances as it warms. Mild sherry comes through, and the hops bite more and more as it sits, which better balances the esters, and yes, the booze. It's like an impatient kid playing hide-and-seek. He hides well, but after you let him sit long enough he starts looking for YOU. Spices interplay well with the serious wheat bill this brew is packing, all making for a very enjoyable experience. Carbonation is light. This pup's delicious. More and more impressed with this brewery (and Moylan's) every time I try a new one. Big ups to RedwoodGeorge for sending this gem East. ."
"ehhh no thanks."
"Drinkability: Very interesting and a new style for me. The alcohol presence makes this one a bit heavy handed. Still, this is well crafted and immensely enjoyable. I can really see getting into this style. Strongly recommended."
"One of the better products from Marin, the balance is allright from start to finish, and the bottle states 9.7%."
"This beer is a classic example of temperature making all the difference. There was nothing especially outstanding about the nose or look on the pour. It was golden, clear with subtle hop and alcohol in the nose. Tasting it cold, there was nothing to write home about. As it warmed it was crisp clean and boozy with some vanilla in the aftertaste. The malts and alcohol dominate  I hate to say like a malt liquor but this is what it reminded me of. A rare beer style that should be experienced- not my cup of tea but a good buzz for trying."
"2002 Vintage bottle with the number 2280 in big numbers in the middle of the label. This beer poured with a very interesting look to it. The color was pinkish orange with a thin swirling head on top. The pink color in it was like something you'd see in pink lemonade or grapefruit juice. Very good looking beer. The aroma of the beer was wheaty and bready wit ha touch of burned sugar sweetness. The flavor comes on strong like a barleywine. It has a sweet syrupy flavor with hop bitterness at the end and tangy caramel notes in the middle. If there were such a thing as a Wheat-Barley Wine, this would be it."
"2003 vintage, *2450* from a 22oz bomber. The initial pour delivers a surprisingly clear, deep golden body with the exception that particulate can clearly be seen rising and falling amidst its turbulent, effervescent carbonation. A second pour, however, changes all that and it takes on the haze normally associated with the style. The foamy, bright-white head holds exceptionally well and leaves solid sheets of lace about the glass. The nose is yeasty and fruity with a touch of pepper, citrusy with hops, and backed by a wheatish malt. The body is medium-full (or is it full-medium?) and the natural, effervescent carbonation bristles on the tongue. Its flavor is bold and rich with a slap of lightly-tart fruit and yeast at the outset, followed by a luxurious wheat-based maltiness. A peppery spiciness appears towards the swallow; and it finishes dry but with a note of sweet, sugar-cookie-dough-like malt that lingers amidst a gentle spiciness from the alcohol. It's an impressive brew; yet it may be slightly over-done as the alcohol becomes obvious even within a twelve ounce serving (cutting down on its drinkability). Still, this is an excellent beer to enjoy while relaxing in the backyard on a cool summer evening as the sun sets. Recommended."
"Star Brew Triple Wheat Ale had me thinking of a barleywine minus the hops or a bruising doppelbock. Tasty, but one would do for a night."
"A real sipping brew this one. It is like a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, having you brains smashed in by a gold brick wrapped in velvet. Tasty stuff that will surprise you with its kick"
"Man, I can't believe how drinkable this stuff is. Problem is after a 22 ounce bottle or two, you're toast. Or at least horizontal."
"Thick, viscous mouthfeel letting you now this is a serious beer! Good carbonation lightens it up a little. The superb balance of this beer makes for great drinkability. Certainly a tummy warmer but beware the 10%, it's hidden well."
"Comments  What a score! I love tasting different and exotic beers, and this one surely fit the bill. This was sent to me by mickeymac, and he couldnt have picked a better offering."
"2002 Vintage here. Appearance: Deep orange slight cloudiness with a massive cream colored head that is quite resilient. lacing stays in thick patches appearance is all bueno here. Aroma: Doughy from the yeast, has nutty tones around the edges, with a massive wheat malt driven alcohol nose very full. Taste: Nuts, cream, fruit undertones, hop bitterness leaving it's mark in full, a massive wave of flavors that have to be picked apart this is a tough one here. I found this beer while living in SoCal but never gave it a shot, so here I am well over a year trying it a gain I thought a triple wheat sounded interesting and boy was I right, with a bready belgian yeast sharp tones of wheat malt this beer is incredible still after the aging process I am currently searching for a fresh sample to compare so send it my way. Overall Mouthfeel: Syrupy oily resins line the palate but there is still a smooth crispness that can be enjoyed in the winter or summer awesome. Drinkability: I must say so much flavor makes this a bit overwhelming so send me another bottle so I can have two."
"2002 vintage. Light orange color, large head. Full bodied triple wit style ale. Sherry-like character. Malts are bold and somewhat sweet. Not very hoppy. Interesting flavor, some banana and clove, citrus and orange. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and very smooth. Aftertaste is malty and sweet. Some alcohol bite in aftertaste despite a 9.2% alcohol content. Etched beer bottle."
"Overall, a decent beer, but not great. It's certainly worth having once."
"Hot damn, this was a big surprise and one of the best beers I've tried in while. Enjoyed from a bomber ebmossed with Marin's logo and ""Star Brew 2280," it's a 2002 vintage. It's honey-color with a fairly large white head that leaves lace all the way down the glass. The smell is sweet and candy or bubble-gum like. Hops mingle nicely with the sweet smell. The bottle says it's ""sherry-like."" Maybe sherry-like flavors are present, but mainly it's a thoroughly enjoyable sweetness that is not the least bit cloying. The mouthfeel is delightful, and this beer gives no clue that it weighs in at 9% abv. This one's a masterpiece that I've left sitting in the cooler on many previous trips to the shop. I won't make that mistake again."
"Wow, this is a great brew from the start. It poured a hazy golden amber with very little foam on the head. The smell was of hops and malt with a hint of caramel. The taste was of a heavenly nature. A complexity of malts and hops, with a sweetness/bitterness that is well balanced. I highly reccommend this beer and will try to buy up all that is left. This has to be one of my top 25 beers."
"Pours a crystal clear golden orange color with a nice thick white head on top that lasts a fair time.  Huge malty aromas with some big fruitiness as well.  Possibly some grapefruit/oranges and some darker/sweeter fruits with a nice vinous quality.  Sweet malty sweetness not unlike what you would get from a barley wine but not as heavy.  Complex fruitiness like a BW as well but on the lighter side as well with some lemon/orange/grapefruit flavors as well as some slightly tart grape/vinous quality.  The alcohol makes itself known only in its warming qualities.   Velvety smooth and very creamy and very easy to drink due to its wheat beer lighness.  This ""Wheatwine"" is a lot like a barley wine but light in color, body, and types of flavors.  It still has all the great complexity of flavors but lighter fruits, body, etc.  Somewhat like somparing a dubbel and a tripel.  Lighter in body and color but equally as complex and flavorful.  This is one great brew and I will have to get a few to cellar."
"Slightly hazy light orange in hue, covered by an ivory white head that settles into a very tight layer that leaves intricate lace.  Citrusy hops hit the nose upfront, then are ensued by spicy alcohol and sweet green fruit esters reminecent of kiwi and white grapes coupled with grainy wheat tartness. Very intriguing aromawise. Caramel malt and butterscotch become discernible as the brew warms and the volatile hop oils dissipate. Flavorwise, smoothly sweet medium caramel malt quickly gives way to nutty and buttery notes, leaving an initial impression of rich peanut brittle.  This then yields to a melange of a citric hop flavor, subdued wheat tartness and candy coated apple sweetness.  Moderate and clean hop bitterness oddly emerges after hop flavor towards the end of the taste, partially offsetting the assertive caramel malt presence.  The combination of fairly low carbonation, ample residual dextrins and wheat protein that escaped fining and/or filtration lend a smooth, viscous and slick mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ a bittersweet combo of brown sugar sweetness and light hop bitterness.  The myriad of flavors hide the relatively high alcohol content.  Star Brew Triple is a rich consortium of buttery malt, light wheat tartness, and signature citrusy west coast hopping.  This brew epitomizes American microbrew creativity.  Delicious and truly unique."
