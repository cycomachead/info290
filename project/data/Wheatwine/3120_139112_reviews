"Based on the aroma, I was not surprised to taste a beer that was very sweet. While it's full bodied and its alcohol well hidden, this beer is much sweeter than I prefer. All I taste are yams on top of yams with a splash of vanilla. ""Well, there's egg and bacon; egg sausage and bacon; egg and yam; egg bacon and yam; egg bacon sausage and yam; yam bacon sausage and yam; yam egg yam yam bacon and yam....."". Palatable, but not my fist pick."
