3.58,-13.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: I thought this beer was a bit weird. I didn't expect the herbal notes. I'm not sure of the age of this one, but the alcohol notes weren't as strong as I would have guessed. I don't know that I would have another in the future.","oline73","Feb 26, 2012"

4.1,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"On draft, poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark amber with a decent head that leaves behind an abundance of thin lacing. The smell is on the boozy side but otherwise remniscent of a hoppy American barleywine. Has a hint of honey in the nose as well. The taste has this sorghum type profile to it. Very interesting. Its tough to make out what else im tasting. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, albeit with a boozy finish. Overall pretty solid.","Retail1LO","Feb 17, 2012"

4.32,4.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Founders Wheatwine golden/hazy yellow in color, 1/2 inch of tight foam on top, streaks of lacing. Smell is very sweet and honey is the main contender. Wheat comes in second with earthy hops that are light and tame. The taste is great, this is the sweetest wheatwine I've had to date and I quite like it. Tastes include whatever I said above but I can't stress enough how well the honey is used in this, It's sweeeet but not cloying. The feel is a heavy handed medium with good carb livining up the feel on this a bit. Not at all syrupy although it tastes like it should be. I wish I was not driving or I would have gotten more of this one. This is one of my favorite Founder's ""brewery-only beers", one that i'll get everytime I see it.","BARFLYB","Feb 15, 2010"
4.05,-1.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This was a good steady sipper, and it was nice to be able to try the Nemesis base now that that beer has just hit the market. Not a ton of complexity to this but there was more than enough flavor to hold my interest through the duration of the glass, plus that wheat really helps contribute to the extremely smooth body on this. Founders fan or not, this is worth a look if you see it around on draft.","Kegatron","Feb 14, 2010"
4.05,-1.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"I'm probably tasting and reviewing this and Nemesis backwards, having had Nemesis the day before, but still made for an interesting comparison. This was a nice wheatwine, fairly unique compared to others of this style I've tried so far. Color is a deep, clear orange-amber with a off white head that has nice retention and sticky webbed lacing. Aroma is a warm boozy spice and wheat/yeast blend with a mild fruity touch. Flavor starts with strong yeast fruitiness and light spice with bready malt backbone. Finish was the most unique part of this for me, with a dry citrus hop flavor that was also the part that was most noticeable from this base beer in Nemesis. Body is medium thick with active carbonation, fairly thick and syrupy on the tongue with a strong boozy warming presence. Not quite as drinkable as some other wheatwines I've had, but overall I think this is the most interesting I've tried. Nice to try what I assume is the base beer (or something similar) of Nemesis.","yourefragile","Nov 29, 2009"
4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"D - While I don't have a lot of Wheatwine experience, I was overall quite pleased with this complex, barleywine-esque brew. The wheat malt gives this style a slight edge over a barleywine, as far as drinkability goes. Another winner from Founders!","ffejherb","Nov 14, 2009"
4.1,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy golden orange color, minimal head and lacing. Smell of citrus honey, belgian yeasts, bready wheat. Taste follows scent with bready wheat, citrus honey, toffee and belgian yeasts all combining almost equally and seemlessly. Slight booze burn on the end, noticible hop presence as well. Good carbonation that keeps the chewyness and stickyness to a minimum. Very good beer, not as sweet, chewy or sticky as other beers of the style i have had, nice touch with the belgian yeast flavor.","rfgetz","Oct 30, 2009"

3.92,-4.9,4,4.5,4,4,3,"(D)- A good beer. It just gets really sweet the more you have of it. Great, but a better dessert/after dinner treat, but you can only have it at the taproom. A rather potent alcohol level.","sweemzander","0"
