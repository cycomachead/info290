"D: A definite sipper.  A nice example of style.  Fitger's did a nice job with this one.  I'd recommend saving some for the next day...it actually gets better. (4)"

"D: High ABV but insanely delicious. Worth going to Duluth just for this one!"
"(Morning after)..ended up stopping after three pints....glad I did....let's just say the ABV is legit...now I've got some more to look forward to tonight.."
"The warmth catches up to ya quick as you down it easily at first. But man this stuff is awesome! Loved it!"
"Slight haze in dark copper body. Small, ringy, off-khaki to cream head. Nose of fruit (banana, cherry, fruit cocktail), rummy alcohol (esters?), and sugar. Yum. Taste starts with a toasted, toffeeish malt that soon gets sweet and fruity. Rummy, booze-soaked fruits take over and wow! This is a big beer! Spicy, banana wheat bitterness in a long, very warming finish. Full-bodied, with a syrupy, thick feel. Very smooth for such a strong beer and I better not drink this whole growler tonight!"
"Originally reviewd February 20, 2005. On tap at the brewpub. Murky auburn pour,with off-white sustaining head. Strong caramel and rose aroma. Ultra-buttery with strong butterscotch and hazlenut flavor. Fades on palate quickyl, but leaves a nice sweet kiss on the tounge. Alcohol very strongly noted. Hops? Tasted again more recently, with added notes of musky indian spice, like cardamon and coriander. Fresh blasts of pineapple, fresh cherries and some coconut. Finishes with a good round of mellowed hops..."
"Medium yellow, hazy and verging on opaque with some tiny floaters. Head is minimal, but laces in thin coating sheets. Aroma of light cinnamon toast, some mace, buttery thick malts, light esters. Thick mouthfeel, low and lush carbonation. Nice flavor, not bright and bold but rich and textured, light pineapple and a quality of sweet shortbread from beginning to end, like a Lorna Doone cookie with confectioner's sugar. A little one-sided, I suppose -- but to my mind -- very pleasant, like an old favorite candy bar. A nice entry in a style that I'm liking more and more."
