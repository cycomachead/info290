"O – So many great things going on for this beer, a ton of complexity, warm and inviting.  Hard to pack all this in and keep it in balance, but it’s well done here."

"O: This beer reminds me like a muted version of a barleywine as you can taste the malty flavors but it doesn't seem as heavy on the body as the wheat lightens things up. It is rather easy to drink considering its strength."

"Taste is toasty toffee, fairly sweet with an alcohol bite on the end, I wish it was lighter on the malt with a healthier hop dose. It is a different sort of wheatwine than the lighter colored, more effervescent variety. This one has a heavy, barleywine feel to it. Not bad, but I likely would pass it up on a store shelf."

"O: Good stuff. Almost like a dessert version of a quad/tripel/dubbel, or the doppelbocks."

"O - It's a good rendition of the style, but I just think this style is setup to not blow people away."

"D: This was a nice brew with nice scent and taste and fantastic body. The finish was smooth and the alcohol was really well hidden, so it was surprisingly easy to drink. I wish it had more boldness, either hoppy or sweet. Instead this ended up being nice but a little boring. Age may help."

"odd beer but another tasty one from perennial. on tap at hops and pie, this has a pale golden color, perfectly clear, but not much head or visible carbonation. smells quite sweet, like honey and wheat malt, somehow still light despite its obvious gravity and alcohol strength. I smell some fruity esters too, maybe even berries or honeysuckle or something lush and springy. the flavor is on the sweet side, residual sugars abound, and its subtle malt flavor is less prominent than it probably should be, although I am admittedly not much of a wheat wine connoisseur. the alcohol doesn't come out until the end, and the flavor is actually rather pleasant, just very sweet. a good glass to share. smooth in the feel, gentle vibes, but lacking the carbonation that I need in a beer like this. it gets heavy as a result, and starts to get tough to drink. the booze comes out as it warms and it can really get you smashed if you don't look out. a good beer from perennial. maybe not quite up to the level of some others, but a unique and enjoyable cold weather brew."
"Rich deep brown in color. Minimal head quickly disappears, but I see active carbonation bubbles. The aroma is a lush, inviting dark wheat aroma. The mouthfeel is very surprisingly smooth considering the strength. There's an earthiness that blends with the carbonation and makes its presence known by prickling the tongue. I've had a handful of other wheat wines and they haven't been good experiences, but this is very intriguing and inviting. There's a bit of a dark malt and buttery cracker refreshing aftertaste."

"Poured a lighter brown (reddish brown) with minimal head and lacing and had a strong boozy aroma, mixed with touches of caramel and dark fruit notes as well as some wheat is noticeable. The wheat helps make for a fuller body, not chewey but close, smooth drinking, the booze is noticeable as it has a slightly heavy boozy taste, not quite bourbon/woody, the dark fruits like plums, raisins, figs are in there, touches of bitter citric hops and spice. Enjoyed this beer but the balances seems to be slightly off as the finish is muddled and at some points was really biting."

"Alright for the style, not near as quaffable as Harvest Dance, so far this brewery isn't really impressing me, especially a pricey as they were at Brown Derby"
"Overall - This is hella dull."

"A really good wheat wine. One of my favorites that I think will do well in the cellar for a couple years. It does a much better job of hiding it's alcohol than many others that I've tried. I wish that expense and shipping didn't prevent easier access to this but I'm happy to have a couple more. Fans of the style should try it if/when possible."
""

"O: This is pretty good, but it's a bit one-noted."
"D - Hard to get past the initial alcohol taste/carbonation sting. Decent beer on the finish but the initial notes are below average."
""
""
""
""
"(O)- Its actually quite a nice beer for the style. I am by no means an expert when it comes to wheatwines, but compared to previous beers I have had in the style, this is actually near the top."
""
""
"Memories of Hitchhiker's Guide flowing back for some reason... Anyway, this stuff pours a slightly hazy sunset amber topped by over a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, wet grass, flowers, light perfume-y orange peel, and lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some grapefruit peel. The alcohol isn't quite as present as I'd expected from other encounters with this brewery, which is a nice bit of surprise. The body is a lithe medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, a sorta/kinda fluid feel, and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a kinda limp wheatwine, one with little character and a subsequently bland flavor."
""
"Poured on tap in a snifter. Appearance is a slightly hazy with a dark golden hue. Minimal head with some spotty lacing. Nose is full of wheat and bread, rich herbal hops come next with a bit of booziness. Taste is a bit sweet up front with heavy wheat character and burn. Mouthfeel is heavy with light carbonation. Overall, a little one note."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel isn't as sticky as I thought it would be. You want to sip this, if only because of the slight boozy finish. Overall, a good beer. The world needed a wheatwine like this one."
""
"O - This is yet another really good beer from Perennial."
"Overall: initially I thought this one was boozy but it mellows out forming a Wheateine unlike any other I have had. Very nice version of the style."
"Poured from tap at bridge in stl. Pours a slight amber golden syrup color. Not much head but its there. Smells off toffee and sweet malts with a bit of alcohol. Taste is fantastic. Sweet toffee malty booze. Slight vanilla and molasses. So easy to drink for such a high abv. Really liked this brew and my fav of the style for sure. Well worth a try but a bottle is on the spendy side"

"Notes: Really glad I got to try this one. Very few stuff from Perennial reaching me, and while all I've tasted felt quality this one might be the one that will make the bigger dent in my memory so far."
""
"The flavor, on the other hand, is excellent. Wheat crispness and lots of fruit esters up front, as expected. But the high point is the caramel/toffee gooey-ness that ensues. Delicious--more like a barleywine with a touch of wheat than the contrary, but I'm perfectly fine with that. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick on the palate, but comes off as easy to drink thanks to the fine carbonation. Overall, a fantastic wheatwine, and is right up there with New Holland's Pilgrims Dole for my favorites within the style. Nicely done, Perennial!"
"Overall this is a decent beer, but forgettable overall. It is good but doesn't shine in any specific aspect. I would def like a bit more of a hop presence, even for being over 6 mo old, it still would benefit greatly from a more dominant citrus punch. I cannot recommend seeking this out even for fans of the style as you can probably get a better example locally. Make no mistake this is a highly crafted ale, the ABV is non-existent even at close-to-room temps which is commendable, just lacks the necessary pop for a higher rating."
"Massive sleeping giant of a beer. It took a few sips to really fall into this beer and see the complexities open up. Very mellow, the 10% does not fully show until the end. A lovely Wheat Wine, yet another one that may show this style being more malt forward which is fine by me."
""

"Flavor has some slight citrus, otherwise a mellow, hearty caramel malt and burly wheat presence and a light herbal bitterness. Not much definitive character here, but it's alright and drinkable. Medium bodied, and fairly smooth considering the 10% abv."
"A citrusy, easy-drinking version of a rarely attempted style. I have been more than impressed with this brewery so far and look forward to enjoying more of their offerings--I just wish I could buy them off the shelves in San Diego."
"Overall: This was my first time trying a wheatwine so I really had no comparisons to make here but I really enjoyed the hell out of it and I will seek it out again"

"Drink- This was a unique wheatwine and I didn't really think it was all that special. I think it was getting a bit fatigued at the tasting at this point as well."
""
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one and quite possible one of my favorites in this style. The alcohol is hidden wonderfully and the sweetness is just perfect to enjoy a couple of pours, which I would really never want from this style normally. Recommend."
"O-Seriously good example of the style.Some of this is currently aging in Bourbon barrels at The Wine and Cheese Place and I can't wait."
"O - Very impressed with this wheatwine. Perennial has been releasing some great brews and I keep looking forward to their development."
""
"This is an exceptional wheat wine. I fully plan to get more of this and both trade and age it. Because of this bottle I'm going to order more of this brewery's stuff right now. Must try."
