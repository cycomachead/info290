"Semi tart apricot front with medium malt finish.  Hefty but not overwhelming."

"Overall â€“ This is a quite a wonderful barleywine. While rather sweet, the thick rye and bit of hop flavor that comes at the end of the taste really help balance the beer and make it a nice slow sipper. This flavor profile mixed with the wonderful aroma and fantastic feel, make this one a must try if you get a chance."

"Overall: a very good and impressive beer, captures everything i like about rye and wraps it nicely into a beer that is drinkable, complex and tasty. great combination of fruity and rye taste."

"O: This is really damn solid. It has a nice combination of sweetness, spiciness, and even smokiness. It could be more complex, but I don't care. Certainly worth trying/worth buying/worth trading for."

"O: Overall this is one hell of an interesting beer. Something to savor, enjoy, and ponder it's plethora of flavors. If this was barrel aged, it would be a monster!"
"O: This is delicious. I really need to go pick up some Repent and Misery."

"The beer is opaque and dark brown with a thin, tan cap. The aroma brings brown bread, lots of booze (in a pleasant way), fruity esters , a hint of spice, perhaps some clove. Really big flavor. Rye bread and a delectable sweetness that never becomes cloying. I'm typically not a huge fan of wheatwines / ryewines, but this one really hit the mark. A surprise winner from DuClaw. Recommended."

"Overall- very enjoyable. Fruit esters and hops more pronounced when it warms a bit. Great sipper."
