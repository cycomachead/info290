Aroma is floral with lots if sweet orange peel, grapefruits, caramel, toffee. Lots of sweetness here. Flavor is spent hops, sweet biscuity malts, orange peels, grass, light booze, lemon zest. Reminds me a bit of Behemoth. Dank with plus body, medium low carbonation. Overall I am glad I got to try this but it's not really my thing. Very sweet, and confused between an old DIPA and a barleywine.","BMMillsy","Oct 06, 2014"

Opens with mandarin orange, tangerine, pineapple, and hints of mango. Caramel shows up midpalate with some soapiness and wheat cracker notes. Low level of carbonation, full body, smooth with a touch of silkiness. A hop bomb, for sure. This brew has just as much in common with most DIPA's as it does with other wheatwines.","chanokokoro","Apr 22, 2014"
3.96,0.3,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall: This one was a weird one to rate. According to style, this is not a very well executed beer. Just overall enjoyment though, this is a classic hop bomb from PW. Bright, fruity, boozy, this one will do the job for you.","KFBR392","Apr 21, 2014"

Two of my favorite styles in on bottlee- the sweet caramel, toffee, mild heat and body I enjoy in a wheatwine with an outstanding DIPA hop profile. Quite glad to have tried this while it's so freash.
