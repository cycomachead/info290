"On-tap. ½ pt Pilsner glass. Enjoyed on agt´12. Reddish deep amber color & chill hazy appearance. Tan, creamy & lasting crown. Caramel toasted malt, ripe fig, sugar, alcohol aromas & bready hues. Toasted malts & resiny hops at first sip with brandy notes. Sharp & rough hoppiness. Full body. Soft carbonation. Oily texture. Dry bitter finish with fruity touch. Long woody aftertaste. No harsh but warming ABV."
"A decent wheatwine, the caveat being that I have relatively few comparisons to draw for it, especially in Alberta. Not too sweet, and complex enough, with a well-tempered elevated booziness. Nice to have the opportunity to try, though I would prefer the next time be free of 'entry' tickets."
