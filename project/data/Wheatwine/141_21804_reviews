"Overall- Not as abrasive as its mainstream cousin, the American barleywine, but VERY nice to drink on a chilly November in NWNJ."

"Great beer, although I dont catch to many notes on the wheat side of the beer.  The Barleywine REALLY stands out."

"Overall an interesting beer. I liked some aspects of it but felt some of the flavor notes were off-putting."

"O: Overall, I was a big fan of this one. The price was great too. I plan to buy a few more of these."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, wheat, caramel, toffee, wood, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour wheat, caramel, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop and wood bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a unique tartness in the flavor that I am not sure I have experienced in other beers of the same style."

"O: Interesting wheatwine. The herbal hops and the heavy breadiness makes me think this is like a triple ESB or something along those lines. Lots of hearty, wheaty bread and herbal hops throughout. Honestly I enjoyed it. It's a bit simple but almost no wheatwines aren't."

"O- The booze is quite noticeable, but this was a ver great sipper, with lots of depth in flavor. Beautiful color."
""
"Been in the fridge a long time. No idea why I bought it. Combo of wheat and barley wine; obviously incompatible. Patriot game on, might as well do this beer. Unexpectedly (which is always the the best) one of the best beer experiences I've had. ABV over 10. Too much under the influence to rate higher than 4.25. Thank you Smuttynose!"
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer, super smooth, easy drinking."

"O: This is an enjoyable beer but it is a very big beer and there is a definitely alcohol presence - you need to slowly sip this one."
"O: pretty heavy and complex, sip over a long period, very sweet"
""
"2013 Vintage. Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a bright, rose-amber coloring with a thin, frothy, off-white head that disappears rather quickly after the pour. Aromas of toasted grains, booze, tangy sweet caramel and toffee. Smells sweet and rich. Flavors are very rich and a bit boozey. Caramel rich and roasted backbone, which is overpowered by the sweetness of the palate. Some subtle spicing at the end of the palate helps clean everything up a bit. Peppery and slightly bitter hops profile. Smooth, robust feel in mouth. The aftertaste is a rich, sweet blend of booze and toffee, leading to a rich, slick, lingering finish. Heavy brew, with a robust talent. Tasty, but big."

"O: An interesting beer, but probably not something I could drink often."
""

""

"Hazy amber pour with a ringlet of white bubbles. Aroma of toasted bread, caramel malts, light stone fruits. The taste reflected the smell, caramel malts, fairly sweet, toasted bread, notes of soft fruits, pear and peach, nice citrus/herbal hop presence. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, low-medium carbonation, and quite drinkable overall."
"Overall: an excellent beer. I especially like the moderate mouth feel balanced with the accentuated finish. Looking forward to drinking again."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- It was flavorful and pretty good, just wanted more. I like what Smuttynose does."
""
""
"O – I like this beer. I’m not really sure what a wheatwine is supposed to be, but I can certainly smell the wheat in the aroma and can feel the creaminess in the mouthfeel. Other than that, it has a lot of similarities to a barleywine. Granted, it’s not on the same level as a lot of barleywines, but then again, it’s not a barleywine. I think it’s a nice, drinkable beer especially for the ABV. If I can find them, I’d like to try more wheatwines."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The wheat is too powerful and doesn't balance out nicely with he rest of the brew."
""
"overall - definitely rich. surprised this still has this much alcohol heat after 2 years."
""
""
"Overall this style is really hit or miss for me but luckily this was in the hit column. The fruitness from the yeast and/or hops helps to balance the sweet maltiness. I really enjoy these Smuttynose Big Beer Series offerings as they are readily available to me and quite reasonabley priced with above average quality."
"O - It's like a beer liqueur in a beer. Interesting to drink but not something I'd reach for again."
""
"This started out promising but the herbal flavors threw this out if whack."
""
""
""
"O/D-Well worth a try. I haven't been too impressed with Smuttynose's Big Beer Series. This one is pretty good, but far from awesome. I didn't really like their S'muttonator but their Baltic Porter is phenomenal. This lies somewhere in between. (Definitely closer to S'muttonator). It's a unique style of beer, but I won't be getting this again."
""
""
""
"O: 3 for the 2007. 4.5 for the 2012"
""
""
"Although I cannot come to any real conclusions regarding the cellaring of this brew from a single flawed data point like this, It does pique my interest enough with the detectable wheat malt aspects over the barleywine-like profile that I will certainly now be seeking out more Wheatwines to try in the future."
""
""
"O: Very well done. Very reminiscent of a barleywine, just with some lighter and more wheaty tones. Very well rounded. A pleasure to sip, and two years of aging has added a little more refinement."
""
"Overall - This was a disappointment, though I didn't know what to expect it was a bit of a letdown. Unbalanced and overcrowded palate and VERY boozy. Nice to see Smuttynose experimenting, but this is a style that is rare for a reason."
""
"Perhaps the boozeyist wheat wine I've tried so far. There is a nice underlying sweet complexity but it's just too overshadowed by that alcohol bite. Still, I'm glad I tried it and think it's worth getting 2-3 more to age. 18-24 months will take the edge off and allow those other sweet wheat wine flavors to shine."
"Another very nice offering from Smutty.. Recommended! Thanks Andy!"
""
"Eh, some alright flavors here but very sweet and boozy, even half a bomber is a bit of a chore."
"A superb beer! By it's nature, though, it's probably more suited for mid-winter consumption than mid-summer, but nonetheless, it was an amazing experience. Full flavored and ""in your face""."
"This beer pours an orange-gold color with no head or lace. It's aroma is mainly wheat with a hint of caramel. The flavor is like sour grapes mixed with a hefeweizen. The sourness is puckeringly strong. The mouthfeel is light with a mild sour aftertaste. Snuttynose Wheat Wine (Big Beer Series) is a disappointing beer, not recommended!"
"O: My first wheat wine. What a great style! Hopefully more like this to come from more breweries! Fantastic beer."
""
"The pretty orange coloring of the beer had me interested, although I found the sweetness a bit overpowering on the nose. There was some citrus and hops behind, but the malty sweetness also overpowered the palate. Some toasted notes on the finish, but lingering sweetness made this a difficult 22oz bottle to finish. Personal opinion is this needs more hops to balance out. Not sure if this would age to something special if the sweetness fades...perhaps."
""
""
""
""
"O: I think I'd like to see more wheat character in this beer. The sweetness of the barley stands out a little too much and overpowers the wheat. Instead of being 53% wheat and 47% barley, it should lean more towards something like 60/40 or a ratio where the tartness of the wheat stands out more. Maybe it does once it has a little age on it, but right now it's pretty barley/sweet forward in terms of taste. Other than that, though, this is a fairly solid beer"
""
""
"22oz bottle, 2012 release, pours golden-copper in color, with a thin bubble head, tons of carbonation in the body of the ale. Aromas are sweet with honey, vanilla, raisin. Tastes are cloyingly sweet with more vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee, raisin, booze. Mouth-feel is full bodied and syrupy, with moderate carbonation, finishes with a dash of white pepper and a tingle on the tongue. Alcohol is warming, but not overly assertive. Overall, this seemed to be too sweet. Good flavors, but cloyingly sweet. A whole bomber by myself was too much to handle. Nice take on the style, but needs to be drunk in smaller doses."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Perhaps it could use some time to mellow out. Hard to judge I guess because its not a specific style. But thinking of it as a wheat wine, not one of my favorites."
""
""
""
"Overall: I dont notice too much of a difference coming from the 53% wheat. It drinks very much like a barley wine, the flavors are very much like a barley wine. The wheat just doesn't add enough unique characteristics to the playing field. A good beer, but blends in with other barley wines already out there."
""
"Poured into a Stella glass. Pours a slightly hazy orange, with a one inch white head, that leaves some nice lacing. Smell is hard candy, clove, grass, dark fruit, carmel,biscuit, and booze. Taste is much more aggressive than the nose. Carmel leads the way, followed by rum soaked raisins, biscuit, and banana bread. Body is medium large, with plenty of carbonation for the large ABV, a little dry as expected from the style, and fairly drinkable for its large size. This is a must try for fans of barleywines and Belgians beers, another solid brew from Smutty. I have had many over the years, but was stoked that I never reviewed it."
""
""
""
""
"O- Yeah, the flavor profile is closer to a barleywine, but you can't put a label on delicious. Damn near perfect in my eyes."
""
""
"Overall - This is a big beer, but Smuttynose definitely takes it a step further. Wheat Wines are an interesting concept. The majority of this beer's malt bill is wheat. It adds subtle spice and definitely softens out the beer's character. "
""
""
"Overall: My first wheat wine. Very interesting style and I think that Smuttynose did a great job. Complex brew great for a cool winter's night."
""
""
""
"I'm sure a lot of snobs and supergeeks would bash this beer and I can understand why. It seems to be loaded with sugar and that was probably to intentionally spike the abv. It may be a little too over the top for some but I enjoyed the shit out of it. Would DEFINITELY buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've enjoyed a bottle or two of this stuff fresh in the past and it definitely seems worthy of cellar consideration as well."
""
""
""
""
"O - I think this is a fairly good beer, but not very drinkable and not very unique. Think of a barleywine with muted hop character and you pretty much have this beer. I can see more wheat than I can taste."
""
""
""
"O - While not my favorite, was not bad and I could appeciate the way it was made and the complexity of flavors, however it was too boozey for me."
""
""
"Urg, another overly sweet and overly boozy mess. Not something I enjoy, and not something I would recommend."
""
""
""
"I know Smutty makes good beer so im going to get a freshie to compare. I am going to review this aged bottle as is though and say that it lost pretty much everything. This is one to drink fresh, since the heat did not die one bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like this beer. I wish it balanced the syrupiness out a little more, but it is very good for what it is. I think it would be good to let it sit on the shelf for a few years. You'd get more flavors out of it and it will definitely stand the test of time. I have had a little less than half the bottle by now in the review, and I am getting a little tipsy already. On second thought, I should've split the bottle with someone. I'm going to go take a nap. Cheers!"
"O - Very sweet and boozy. I probably should have opened this after I bought it, or better yet, should have purchased a few bottles and opened them over time to compare the changes as it ages. I really enjoy the beers from Smuttynose and always look forward to my next glass from them. This is a brewery that doesn't get enough love here on BA! This particular bottle is a total sipper, it tastes bigger than 10.7% and will creep up on you very quickly so take your time and enjoy."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled in 2009. Pours slightly hazy red orange color with a small fairly dense light khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap of lace. Small patches of lacing clinging to the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, banana, orange zest, clove, spices, and a bit of booze. Very nice and balanced aromas. Taste of big caramel, banana, molasses, citrus, light fruits, light vanilla, spices, and maple syrup. No real amount of bitterness noticed on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, molasses, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming on the finish noticed. Great balance of flavors, the alcohol definitely cleans the palate with every sip and doesn’t detract from the flavor profile at all. Nice drinkability but it is still a sipper. Overall this is a damn nice wheat wine that is very enjoyable and smooth for the level of alcohol."

"O - Guess I just wasn't wowed by this. I love American Barleywines, but this takes on a bit of a different direction. Not having a hop presence results in more of a syrupy concoction in my opinion. There was depth in the taste, but not very much diversity."
"O- A decent brew. To me it's pretty much all barleywine, though it's only my second example of the style, and the Founders style version I had first rocked my frigging socks off. I think this would be interesting aged in oak, but would get way to hot in a bourbon barrel. Worth picking up."
"Overall (4.0): I’m a fan. Smuttynose Wheat Wine was the first I ever had of the style, a few years ago when I was still pretty fresh in the craft beer world. I really want to try this fresh, and also with 2-3 years on it, to compare to where it’s at right now—frankly I didn’t even realize this was aged about 10 months because I kept waiting for a good reason to open it. Either way, I like it the way it is now, and while it’s not for everyone (as I think is common to the style in general), this is my idea of a non-IS sipper. Warm, fruity, rich, and boozy."
"O: When I noticed the hop-centric side of the beer I decided to drink it now instead of aging it but now I have some wonders. Certainly some carbonation would help this beer but in any case I'd like to try this with a year or two on it some time. Well worth picking up a bottle of this if you can."
"Draft to snifter. Looks good; however, this is my first review of a wheat wine, so this portion of the review is somewhat arbitrary. Smell is good. Very similar to a barleywine. The taste is where it differentiates itself from a BW. Not better, not worse; just different, and refreshingly so. Much more candied up front. And throughout, for that matter. I like it. The mouthfeel is good too, especially for a big beer. I couldn't do too many of them because of how candied they are, but it's a nice alternative to a big beer."
"2009 vintage. Pours from the 22oz. bomber a dark amber color with a small off-white head that quickly vanishes. Lots of fizz in the head, but little evidence of any carbonation inside the glass. Thee aroma is quite similar to apple juice, in fact it's almost identical. 1st sip brings a semi-sweet taste of fruit (apples, raisins, plums, bananas) with a soft hint of alcohol. The alcohol is somewhat understated, perhaps due to 2 years of aging. Mouthfeel is kind of on the thick, syrupy side, but not in a bad way IMHO. Halfway through the first pouring and I can already start to feel the 11% alcohol starting to sneak up on me! The muting of the alcohol from aging makes the drinkability high. Overall, this is quite a tasty, satisfying beverage. I'll have to pick up a replacement now, but I don't know if I can wait 2 years to sample it!"
"O: Solid wheatwine and one of the best I’ve had. For a beer that isn’t of my favorite style, I quite enjoyed this."
"Pours orangish red in color,orange to the light.Slightly clear.Headed with a yellowish thin crown that quickly dissipates.Brief lacing rings.Caramel malt,bread,fruit & chewing gum aromas.Not bottering but kind burning alcohol all over & spicy hints.Dark fruit candy & dry hoppy flavor.It finishes with a complex underneath tartar.Funny tickly on nose comes from the aftertaste.Full body & fine carbonation.Good & gentle drinkability."
"O: Drinkability is good for the style uit not a beer you can drink alot of. Share a bomber."
"O- This is the first wheatwine I've had, so I didn't know what to expect. To me this tasted much like a strong double IPA mixed with an English barleywine. A good beer but nothing spectacular."
"o- another good beer from smuttynose, however rating it to style or to enjoyment is the ultimate question. this guy is more of a barelywine but nonetheless anextremely enjoyable beer."
"Medium bodied with very little carbonation, this beer is surprisingly smooth. The lack of carbonation has amazingly little effect on the drinkability. While it is rather sticky, and almost syrupy once warm, it is still easily enjoyable."
"SkÅL!"
"o - Overall a much better beer than the barleywine, though this had the advantage on aging a year. Sweeter and less alcohol, would have it again."
"overall: WOW, this is a great beer I enjoyed it so much."
"Overall, I enjoyed my first wheatwine."
"Overall: Nice beer, would drink it again."
"Taste is more of the same with a burnt caramel sweetness pervading the beer. Surprisingly dark malt flavors are coming forth. Maybe a bit too sweet? Nah..alcohol swoops in to rescue the day from the dreaded cloying demon-beast. Shockingly to me, this brew becomes more drinkable and quite enjoyable as the ounces pass. I think I would like this better fresh, but it is quite tasty even now. All the ingredients come together nicely and make the whole tastier than the sum of its parts. Color me impressed."
"Balanced, but big - and enjoyable. Easy does it on this one."
"overall, its good, but doesn't differentiate itself enough from a barleywine to really stick in my head."
"Comes out of the tap a hazy, barely transparent coppery red-brown with a thick, fine-bubbled, fairly persistent pale tan head that leaves some good lacing. Aroma is wheaty and fruity, the latter an interesting mix of apple and citrus, with a hint of an alcohol bite. Fruity, wheaty flavor has an undertone of barleywine (i.e., serious alcohol content) and equal parts sweetness and bitterness. Very tasty! Texture is rough and rowdy, leaving behind a nice fizz. Heartily recommended."
"O - A very interesting beer. Like a barley wine but smoother. Definitely a big beer, it takes a while to drink it down."
"Interesting, but perhaps not my favorite. A bit hot, and the flavors aren't really all that exciting here."
"Drinkablility- overall this beer is pretty drinkable considering the high abv, the wheat gives it slightly more light version of what you get out of barley but still real big flavor, this beer was good but I would have fall short of calling it great and as my first example of the style it was more okay then amazing, a unique style of beer i will have try again, do have admit though the beer did grow on me and certainly started appreciate balance of sweet and bitter"
"O- I dig the style and this a good overall beer. I want more wheat wines to compare it to."
"O- I wasnt sure what to expect with this one. althuogh it wasnt great, it wasnt horrible. I should let one sit in the basement for a littlewhile and give it a go."
"Pretty interesting and unique ale, enjoying it immensely but not sure it's something I would come back to. Glad to have it once though. But don't expect the same taste as a barleywine."
"O-This is meshing extremely well with the ham and turkey sandwich that i'm eating. I'm finding out though, that this is a bomber that is best shared with a friend. The tastes, though not extremely bad, just aren't something that I want a lot of right now, or ever. i think this beer needs a bit more carbonation, okay a lot more carbonation. it just isn't something i'll be getting again. i'll admit, i always though the whole wheat wine concept was a little weird, now i believe it even more."
"Overall, pretty mellow and drinkable considering how many brain cells it is sending to an early grave. This is a reading poetry on a snowy evening in a mountain cabin kind of beer, but a pretty good one."
"D - Heavy, but still pretty drinkable. The 10.7% abv shows here, but not in a bad way. The flavors are interesting and well balanced. The flavors are strong so this is pretty much a sipping beer but very enjoyable."
"D- This beer has some nice wheat wine flavors but it is a bit thin without much depth. Perhaps a little age will help bring things together but that may make it even thinner. The brassy flavor was a bit off putting and soon became stronger than the other malt flavors."
"D - A slow sipper. Pretty delicious in a desert kind of way. I don't know if I've ever consumed a beer with more malt and sweetness in it. It's kind of like drinking butterscotch. Interesting."
"Felt this was too similar to a normal barley wine. I thought that this would have been a little bit different. Expected it to be lighter I guess. To me not much really stood out and made much of a difference. It was a brownish colored brew with a little head that survived for a little while. The flavors in this beer was strong for sure. I would try this again in hopes of enjoying this a little more the second time around."
"I am impressed with this beer. As a relatively new style, I have not had much to sample just yet, however based on the description, this appears to be a winner."
"D- A decent brew overall not something to quaff but tasty nonetheless."
"Overall this is a beer to age only if you crave caramel malt sweetness between your teeth. Not the best of the Smutty Big Beer series, but it's pretty darn good."
"Big Beer Series? I'll say. Poured into a tall, more 'flute-shaped' snifter with a deep solid dark honey brown body and a nice tan one finger head to cap it. This beer smells incredibly sweet. I can't exactly put my finger on. It's very fruity and sugary, even. Any hops presence is muted by the incredibly wheaty profile of the wheat wine. The bar I had this beer at listed it at 12% ABV and you certainly notice it. Great beer to have if your in the mood for something big."
"Smuttynose did a credible job with a style that I find intriguing and difficult. To be fair, I'm not enthralled with Wheatwines. Nonetheless, this one's alright. I do think the strong citric fruit presence is why it succeeds. It works well with the heavy wheat presence. If you haven't tried a Wheatwine before, this is a great place to start. I can't say this is the best of the style, but it's rather friendly all around and is a little better than the score probably suggests."
"D: This one needs much more time before visiting again -- probably more like 4-5 years time."
"D: I realize that this is a sipper, but most sippers I've experienced have flavors that can stand up to the alcohol in them- that is not the case here. The slightly tasty, faint sweet notes are outweighed entirely by the ethanol. Not looking for another glass of this."
"D: a strong brew proudly representing a strong style. overall, just a bit too much alcohol. may need to get another one of these and set it aside for a while to see if it can mellow out."
"This is a very interesting mix making for a nice slow sipper."
"Overall: This is a straightforward malt and alcohol explosion in your mouth. While the malt does offer some complexity and tries its best to balance that alcohol, it does push toward overly hot at times. This beer would likely cellar quite well, mellowing out in time. Definitely worth picking up if you can find it, and a must try for any barleywine lover."
"D - Pretty good drinkability. It is a sipper for sure, but it goes down pretty easy. It is sweet, but not too sweet. It drinks pretty much like a barleywine. There is quite a big alcohol presence, and that mixed with the sweetness drug down the drinkability a bit for me. All in all, I really like this beer, and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. This was my first wheat wine, and I wish more breweries would make this style. I would for sure try this beer again."
"Very drinkable, great example of a wheat wine, but not an every day beer (as per the style)"
"drinkability - this is a style that needs to be explored more by me and breweries - this is only my fourth wheatwine and it is very good and just different enough from barleywines to make me want to buy everyone that pops up on store shelves around me"
"A big flavorful beer for a good price. Poured a slow to emerge 3/4"" head with lots of tiny slow bubbles rising through a hazy red body. Quite the rich taste with caramel and malt (barleywine indeed) and with a hoppiness added comparable to many IPAs. The lady of the house loved it too and that's saying something."
"High ABV makes it tough to drink much off."
"Pours a deep, clear amber with a very small, late-developing head that produces a small fizz of light tan head and no lacing whatever. The smell is strong, syrupy and with a distinct tang of copper, like licking an old penny. The flavor is quote sweet and almost soda-like, with a big round bite of wheat and a rich, plummy syrup, with strawberry and tropical fruit. The finish has that same odd old copper metallic tang. The booze is strong but muddled, like a fruity tropical drink - it almost has the feel of a mai-tai, with a candyish finish."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer, and wheatwines in general. Seems like some breweries use a hefeweizen yeast and get some banana or bubblegum esters, which this one does not. Tasty, but a little too boozy."
"Pours a nice hazy orangish reddish color with a thick off white head with visible yeast in the glass. The aroma is of caramel malt with a sweet sugary smell along with dark fruits and a slight hop presence along with a slight alcohol smell. The taste has a caramel malt backbone with a big sweet flavor. There are hints of dark fruit and ctirus with a touch of hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is creamy with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is okay the taste is a little sweet. It is a so so easy drink."
"4.0 D: It's a shame that no one gives a damn about wheatwines and only a handful of breweries make them. They're about as good as barleywines, which don't get enough respect either. Anyway, this is a solid beer. Not the greatest in any aspect, but good in them. Interesting booziness to this makes it almost taste like a ""training whiskey"" which is very nice for me since I can only handle whiskey well in limited concentrations."
"A fairly average wheatwine. The mouthfeel and flavor are decent, but nothing really stands out about this one."
"D - This is a thick, sweet, big beer, but very tasty and enjoyable. A sipper for sure, but delicious and complex."
"I am once again impressed by Smuttynose. A tremendous beer that has aged rather gracefully. In my opinion this one still has legs, I would wager it is still tasty in another couple years. Very smooth for a higher abv beer. Flavors are pleasant, never overwhelming."
"D: the alcohol isn't too strong and had a unique and interesting taste,but a bit sweeter than I like."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. Drinkability is good, I really liked the flavors it brought. it was a very flavorful beer overall with some bold flavors to it. They all came together nicely though and made a great beer. I'm really starting to love this style of beer, and this was another very good version of the style."
"Drinkability is very high. Very nice beer. Alcohol makes its presence known about half-way through the first glass. This is a big beer that deserves to be shared."
"D-It goes down easily. Each time I drink it, I want another sip."
"Pours dark orange with little head and some floaties present. Smells sweet, wheaty, and like golden molasses, with some hop and spice notes and a touch of alcohol. The taste is, thankfully, much less sweet. Firm and earthy with some good spice notes, some nice piney/spicy hoppiness, and a honeyed finish. Firm and almost chewy in the mouth, this is obviously strong, but the alcohol itself is fairly well hidden. The high hop levels help to camoflauge the sweetness, and overall make this beer seem pretty big for the style."
"Good beer, but its flat now. Would love to have a fresh bottle."
"not the most drinkable beer, too cloying and strong and out of balance."
"2007 Vintage. Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a murky red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of BOOZE, caramel, molasses, and sweet malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this one wasn't that bad. Usually I don't enjoy Wheatwines so that is saying A LOT. The taste on this one was definitely a lot better than the smell for sure. The taste of it was nicely balanced with the alcohol by some of the sweetness from the caramel and molasses notes. The aroma was just plain harsh to put it lightly. I could see this one aging for a bit longer myself."
"D - A bomber is probably it for the night. Maybe follow it by an Imperial Stout 12oz. Heat after 2-3 years was a bit surprising. I wish I could get my hands on another '08 and leave it for a few more years. I guess I'll have to get a '10 and leave it for 5 years or so."
"The body was thick, sticky, sweet and full. Drinkability was very good for a beer this size. Overall, this is a very nice brew, just not what I expect from the style. This is the type of review I have problems with. This is a very good beer, but not what I was looking for. This style is generally not so thick and, sweet and is crisper and lighter. Worth trying when you can, just don't expect to get what the says it is."
"Rounding out the flavor is a mild heat that I can only classify as acceptable. However, Smuttynose has really won me over with this one. They've really managed to create a ""big"" beer with a mildness that can be enjoyed by many and a robustness exalted by few."
"Drinkability is surprisingly well, for being 10.7% and loaded with malts and sweetness, I expected a lot more boozy taste, and sticky finish, but it really had neither. The long finish is the only thing keeping me from drinking this fast, that and not getting drunk too fast."
"I had no idea this beer would taste like this... I expected something like a caramely double white, or maybe an American barleywine with some wheat influence, both of which sound at least interesting. What I got was a well-crafted beer suited exactly to my tastes. Another exceptional beer from Smuttynose, and a great complement to their hoppy, tropical-fruit oriented Barleywine in the ""Big Beer Series""."
"Decent."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was an orangey brown with a dirty yellow white 1 finger head. Head didn't last long at all, clung a bit to the side, and had small streams of carbonation rising from the bottom. Aroma was sweet up front, with hints of bitter wheat in the end. Felt ok in the mouth. Felt very good in the mouth, coated nicely, and was well carbonated. Well balanced, mostly hid the ABV, but it still hit fairly hard."
"Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a perfectly matched level of carbonation. I'm not a big fan of most barleywines, but this is a style I could certainly get used to."
"Beer is pretty sweet, strong alcohol character. Odd bitterness, its dry on the finish, overall its pretty drinkable for an 11% beer. My hand hurts, I'm not typing anymore."
"D: Quite drinkable. If you do not absolutely hate wines (again I hate describing a beer this way, but its consistency is similar) I would heed a warning, though I found this to be a pleasant brew overall."
"Overall, a nice one to try with some age on it."
"The beer pours an absolutely gorgeous ruby, with bright red highlights when held up to light. Two fingers of beige head form, and while retention and lacing aren't great, given the alcohol I can't hold that against Smuttynose Wheat Wine too much. The nose gives me a little cause for concern, as while there's a certain spiciness to it the predominant aroma is of alcohol. The taste is a little bit better, as some sweetness from the wheat shows up to help the spiciness, but alcohol is still a bit too prevalent on my palate for this beer to make a great impression. It's a shame too, as a beer with this great a mouthfeel deserves to be supporting top notch flavors. The body is as rich as it could possibly be without becoming cloying and thick, and the carbonation is very nicely understated. The great mouthfeel helps make this beer drinkable, but with so much boozy flavors flying around it can't be anything more than a sipper. Smuttynose Wheat Wine isn't a bad beer, but the only reason I'd really be interested in revisiting it is to see it with a few years of age (and less alcohol heat) on it."
"D--Glad I tried it, Smuttynose makes some nice brews, I have really enjoyed their big beer series, keep em coming..."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best due to the heat as it could really use some time to mellow out a bit; all in all, it's definitely a nice beer though."
"I really like this beer; one of my favorite representation of the style (based on what I've tried so far). Drinkability is pretty good considering the abv; it might have been a good idea to split this with someone. I wish I had purchased more bottles when it was in all the stores. I will admit that the second pour isn't nearly as satisfying, but this is still a good beer."
"D- its a bit of a mess maybe with some time things will level out and it'll come together. Very hot and a tough drink."
"Overall, a good beer. I'm usually not a fan of highly hopped beers, but I enjoyed this one. I was surprised that it clocks in at 70 IBUs, as it doesn't taste that high."
"2008 vintage. 22oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Poured a semi-translucent plum with a quarter inch, loose, tan-colored head that quickly dispersed into a band of bubbles and a slick of foam. Some large globules of lacing appear on the tilt side of the glass. Nose reveals caramel, toffee, dark fruit, toasted malt and booze. Taste is not as sweet as the nose suggests, there also some bittering hops in the flavor profile and an alcohol quality that borders on caustic and presents itself throughout from start to finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a prickly carbonation level, a slight viscosity to the consistency and some residual alcohol heat that lingers at the finish. A pretty tasty brew, but definitely allow this one to warm to round out the flavors and disperse the carbonation. Best shared between one or two friends."
"The alcohol is notable, but isn't the predominate flavor. Mostly malty, with very little wheat bite. The swallow has some warming brandy elements and a touch of hop. The aftertaste is long-lasting alcohol with a background of distant wheat (finally). Closer to a barley wine, imho. Rich bodied, this is a sipper's beer."
"D) Just an average barleywine. The wheat characteristics don't really shine out."
"D - odd style which i've had a few of but cant put my finger on. this is a definite sipper due to high (and noticeable) ABV. not bad."
"A little too sweet for me but interesting enough to try again. Going to age this one for a year or so before try number two."
"Drinkability: At this ABV this beer is certainly a one a night beer and a beer for sipping. I'm glad I tried it and that I have another bottle in the cellar to age for a year or so. At the moment I don't mind drinking it but it doesn't grab me the way some barley wines do. It is a nice enough beer and I look forward to trying it with some age, but I'm not thinking I'll go out of my way to find it in the future."
"I really like big, boozy barley wines so it makes sense that I loved this stuff too. I'm not positive that I would be able to distinguish wheat from barley wines but definitely enjoyed that little extra kick the wheat seems to have given. The ABV obviously holds the drinkability back and it's a definite sipper, but I would love to get another chance to drink this one. Thanks again Eric!"
"T- The taste follows the nose. Alcoholic, strong, malty with a little bit of hops and plenty of spicy, snappy wheat."
"D - this is something i would really only want one of in a session.. i think it is a nice change of pace and i enjoyed throwing this into the mix.. smuttynose makes a lot of good beer in my opinion so i'm sure this one is fantastic.. but i would need someone who is more familiar with this style to second that emotion..."
"A little too sweet to much more than a serious sipper but I liked it for what it was, a giant boozy tasty beer."
"Note: 2009 vintage"
"June is a sweaty month here in Boston, and that also did not work in favour of this beer."
"MF is medium and smooth, nothing really to complain about. Could potentially use a little more carbonation. Drinkability was ok, the sweetness put it down a bit. Maybe some more hops would balance this out, as such it stands as an English Barleywine with a bit of wheat and for some reason I just don't like it very much."
"D: pretty good, but certainly not something I need 22oz. of."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Hmmm, not sure this goes to the top of the wheatwines I´ve had but typically I find the range within the style pretty stimulating, and this one fits the bill nicely. More so I think I´m influenced by its great price-quality ration, at least with this group of Smuttynose bottles that were simply amazingly priced."
"Drinkability: A hot mess of a beer. If you love the taste of alcohol, this is for you."
"D: Certainly warms the cheeks up, may be a little off-putting on a warm day. Slow sipper here for sure."
"Eh. If I'd wanted an American barleywine, I'd have bought one."
"All in all, a fun one to try and a decent bottle to split. Especially with pears and cheese."
"Overall, this is a good offering in the Big Beer Series from Smuttynose. The alcohol is a bit stiff, but would feel nice on a cold night. I like the caramel and herbal notes in the flavor, but beyond that nothing is really pulling back in. I may pick up another bottle for the cellar and see what happens in a couple more years. Still worth giving a try if you see it."
"What an amazing beer. Malt. Like a killer English Barleywine. Just classic."
"D: a rich experience for sure, this brew is meant for the courageous. Definitely worth a shot, as it is a great companion to their barley wine offering."
"22 ounce bottle from 2009. Served in an oversized wine glass, the beer pours a hazy reddish/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, not much lacing. Aroma is brown sugar, caramel malt, sweet booze (maybe brandy or sherry), and some dark fruit (figs, cherries). The beer tastes like brown sugar, earthy hops, dark fruit, caramel malt, booze and some butterscotch. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and a bit syrupy and coating with low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth going down and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good brew, I liked it."
"I had this on tap and loved it, not so good in the bottle."
"The first time I had this beer was the last time it was released in O8? I didn't like it... too much alcohol content for me to be able to see through it to what was actually happening beyond it. That and I was still young in my general all around beer nerdery and knowledge. Since these have been back on the shelves as of late I figured I give it one more shot. This time, while still having a strong alcohol presence, I was really able to notice the other flavors shinning through. The nose is big with candied sugar, tropical fruits, and sweet malt. The taste was similar with the malt backing nicely. Its very easy drinking and as it warm towards room temp, the flavors really start to develop. Starts taking on a butter scotch characteristic. I think I'll have to get a few more of these for the cellar."
"I think this is my first ""wheat wine"" and I'd have to say I like it a lot. It's a lot like a barley wine only different in the ways you'd expect. Lighter in color. A little sweeter. Fruitier in aroma. Give all that, it still packs the same punch as a barley wine with as equally complex a flavor. This is the first of this type of beer I bought but it won't be the last."
"D-big barleywine with a nice hop profile. Extremely tasty and nicely balanced. Smooth and easy drinking."
"Overall, a good beer that I do recommend since it's a unique style. Only my second wheatwine so hard to say which one represents the style best. The other one, to me, had better aroma and taste and I've already got some more in the cellar. This one, while good, had too much alcohol that overpowered the rest of the flavor. It's not available here so hard to get another to age and see what happens to it so this is probably my only shot at it. [N;N]"
"Overall a nice strong beer. I recommend it for American barleywine fans. It's a neat twist on a strong beer."
"D-much easier to drink than a typical barleywine due to the sweetness"
"EDIT: This beer has medium toast oak chips added during dry hopping...so I was right about the oak component being there....also, recently had a 2009...while ""ok", I did not like it nearly as much as the 2008 reviewed here."
"Pours a lovely clear amber garnet, with a tiny amount of clear sudsy head, which tries to coalesce into a cohesive layer of foam, but to no avail. The nose is wheat, corn, clove, and oak, but it is all quite weak. The taste holds notes of maple syrup, raisins, figs, cornmeal, and grains. The body is thick and lightly heavy, with a slight dab of carbontion. It covers the tongue in a light syrupy manner, but then proceeds to lithely slide right on down. Overall, a very drinkable brew, despite the relatively high ABV."
"My favorite Smutty product so far."
"Medium body with a chewy mouthfeel that fills the mouth. I didn't get much of the wheat contribution in this, making it substantially similar to a barleywine style. A bit hot and sweet, which isn't a total surprse for the style. Overall a pretty well-rounded and mostly balanced beer."
"Thick golden strawberry brew. Barely any head, just a thin off-white haze. Massive malt nose, hint of piney hops. Same in the taste. Complex but hard to pick apart. Mouthfeel is thickly sweet but not cloying. Slight alcohol burn in the finish but nicely hidden by carbonation."
"Smuttynose nails it again."
"Pours a very pretty reddish gold with a small head. Smells like a barleywine. Big sweet smell with notes of dark fruit. Taste is very sweet again. Caramel. Fruit notes. Just a bit of crispness and tartness from the wheat. Some herbal hops. Spicy warming booziness in the finish. Complex and very tastey. Not as heavy as you might think. Definitely a sipper but more drinkable than a typical barely wine. Very nice overall."
"Cheer."
"first wheat wine i've had and i definitely look forward to getting another bottle or two of this. it aged great, but i'd like to try a fresh one as well. recommended."
"D: You know this is really good. Its a sipper for sure. I am looking at this like a nice liquor. You sip and savor. The alcohol is a bit too big to just sit here and gulp down. This is too taken in moderation and savored which I am doing. Quite good in all departments and I can't complain at all. Fantastic beer and another great offering from the great Smuttynose."
"D - A decent brew that is made for sipping on. The alcohol definitely keeps you warm and is felt all the way to the finish. Similar to their barley wine"
"D - definitely a sipping beer, but at room temp it still tastes good and I'd have another"
"D: As an excellent aperitif, or dessert brew. Would go well with any kind of pie, or crusted dessert. The alcohol is certainly there, but it's hidden in the background and doesn't negatively affect the brew. One of the better barleywine/hybrids I've had."
"Though I'm increasing my exposure to wheatwines, it tastes like a barleywine! What gives? It's thick and, as I skip into mouthfeel, I chew its ingredients. There's a bite in the aftertaste I identify as wheat, but I just don't really know what to make of this beverage. Its density is its lasting impression! I've read a lot of reviews that make mention of leather, and here I am drinking this with thought bubbles of belts and boots! Where would that even come from? Fuck brandy--I could see a St. Bernard holding this Smuttynose Wheatwine in a barrel around his neck. Might not do much to nourish a dehydrated hypothermic, but it could certainly help numb the pain! This brew tastes even stronger than its 10.70%, thereby hampering its drinkability. Though not tops among my inaugural escapades into wheatwines, it's definitely memorable."
"Medium body, carbonation is on the low side. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming. A bit on the sweet side. Very complex. The sweetness is all I could knock this on. Age could make this really special."
"Notes: Smuttynose comes through again with an interesting, tasty beer. Bravo!"
"The mouthfeel is heavy and sweet, almost syrupy. Just what I would suspect from the style. The beer is just carbonated enough to make the flavors move over the palate. The beer is very sweet, and the alcohol is a bit overwhelming at this point. The some aging might benefit this beer."
"D- Overall, I didn't particularly care for this beer fresh. However, I could see it aging nicely. I will hold on to my other bottle for a while."
"Overall, I could get some Stone or Anchor or Sierra Nevada Barleywine and really enjoy it, or have this, which I kinda like. If you like barleywines, this is worth a try. Not great, but ok. Good winter brew. Warming, a grown-up beverage. Glad I tried it, but I'm one and done."
"D - A very drinkable wheat wine with a sweet yet balanced taste w/ spice, malt and alcohol all cooperating, however the alcohol is noticeable as well as mild honey-like and toffee hints under the hop balance"
"Wheatwine is an interesting style but doesn't seem like it could stand up against the best barleywines. That being said this still a great brew to enjoy when in the mood for something big. It would be interesting to see how this one ages."
"The clear body glowed golden orange, and the head was a little small for a wheat based beer. The smell was much closer to a Barleywine than I expected, with floral-honey like sweet aroma dominating others. The taste was very unusual for the style, with none of the banana, or clove characteristics. Instead what I tasted almost felt like pumpkin pulp or that honey again. Pretty hot in the mouth as well, but still quite pleasant. Very rich in the mouth with a lot of coating action, and then fading to a red hot finish in the belly. Deliciously different."
"This beer is very similar to a barley-wine. But a sweeter, less harsh barleywine. Its an emerging American ale style and I support anything experimental. This beer is really a kick in the pants and anyone who enjoys a barleywine or strong ale will appreciate this beer. Expect a sweet complex beer thats highly alcoholic and a bit hard to describe."
"Poured hazy copper color with an average off-white frothy head that motly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malt, earthy and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation and particle. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate to long duration. I would share this with a freind and didn't."
"Overall I would like to have this fresh (assuming my assumption that it's on the older side is correct) to compare the two. As it stands now I'd say it's worth a shot."
"Overall - A great offering"
"Drinkability: The alcohol is very present in this one and I think it overshadows the taste some. This reminds me of an above average barleywine. An interesting beer, but not the first I will reach for."
"M/D: Full bodied with low carbonation, alcohol is warm. A bit syrupy on the tongue. OK drinkability, but a beer like this has to be sipped and I don't know if I'd choose to drink."
"This is certainly an interesting brew. I love the fruitiness, but the spice from the wheat distracts me a bit. Fresh this is hot with alcohol. I hope to visit this again with some age on it as this is definitely different."
"M/D - Smooth as any beer I've tried. Incredibly drinkable for the style. The flavors and the alcohol have mellowed so well. Although mine has been able to age for quite some time, I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"I would consider this Smuttynose offering as my second favorite wheatwine to date. It is a solid example of the style, and leans more to the barleywine character than big wheat notes. More wheat profile than a Pilgrims Dole, less than a Weyerbacher 14. Overall SN WW is a solid wheatwine example, hides abv well, nice price @ $6/bomber, nice wheat/barley balance for a very enjoyable wheatwine."
"Small head, even with an aggressive pour, mainly big, popping bubbles, dark tan in color, no real lacing. Deep bronzed color, even as it's close to fully transparent, shades to brown as much as orange, very vivid. While the nose is sweet, has excellent focus an firmness, the butterscotch, toffee and milk chocolate form a controlled explosion, blends in pink grapefruit, pralines, little evidence of wheat or other grains, touch of floral dew, the high ABV curiously seems to extend the scents rather than dampen them. Medium-bodied, most of the weight front loaded into the mouth entry so the carbonation prickle hardly noticeable until the end. That noted, a minerally fizz relieves some of the sweetness from the caramel, toffee, butterscotch components, creates space for pink grapefruit and pine too. Something like witch hazel going on, definitely ""boozy."" Apricot, fig, banana, pear fruit of slimmer proportions. Here it comes close to losing it but, as in the nose, there's a guiding force that keeps the parts in order. But it is pretty damn alcoholic so be ready for that."
"Thick mouthfeel, just a tad slick, but full and satisfying. Tasty beer, a good sipper."
"Drinkability at this time is pretty low unfortunately, but I wish I had aged this a few years before opening it. Going to get a few more of these to throw in the cellar for a year+. A great wheatwine, it just needs more time to mature and let the booziness mellow out."
"22oz bomber into a DFH Signature Glass a murky orange with an almost nonexistant head. Aroma is loads of bananas, orange, sweet malts with mild hops. The taste is like a tropcal barley wine, loads of sweet fruits with a nice lingering finish. The beer is somewhat heavy with a decent amount of warming alcohol. This is a very interesting, enjoyable brew!"
"A very good standard of wheatwine and a pleasant beer to enjoy with a large array of beer appreciaters."
"D- Moderate, but oh-so-good. The best wheatwine I've had. I'll be buying more. If you like high-ABV beers, this one is a can't miss."
"D- This is my favorite Wheat wine so far, which is to say of the two I've had. Smuttynose does a nice job of having just enough hops in the finish to balance out the sweetness and prevent the beer from being cloying and yet add complexity. Impressive beer especially for the price."
"I like it."
"D: Big ABV and flavor but a nice slow sipper. Could use just a touch more carbonation."
"Drinkability: I've only had two or three wheat wines thus far, but this was the least impressive of the bunch. That's not to say it was bad; I actually liked this beer. I just think that it was kind of on the boring side. Nicely put together, but needs a little more pizazz."
"Smuttynose. I'm fast becoming a fan, they're churning out some good stuff, & some great stuff. This falls into the latter category. Excellent beer. I will seek this one out again."
"Drinkability? The abv is there in your face so this one is certainly a very slow sipper but I'm kind of fond of the overall taste(I was afraid that this would end up being too sweet) and it is a very nice looking brew. I didn't know what to expect from the style but the bottom line for me is that I like this. A very interesting style."
"22oz. bomber: 2006 vintage (3 years old). This one pours a clear amber color. There was a small beige head on it that goes away almost immediately. There was no lacing. This one has a big nose to it. A definite sweetness to the aroma. Raisins and brown sugar are there, as well as some grassy hops, some other fruits and a bit of alcohol. The taste is quite good. It isn't as sweet as the nose, if fact there is a bit of bitterness in the finish. There are lots of subtle tastes: fruits, caramel, maybe even a faint hint of chocolate. This is good!"
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle, 2006 vintage, shared with brothercannon. Poured into a pair of basic snifters. Appears a cloudy amber chestnut color with about an inch of light ecru foam. Notes of brown sugar, caramelized malts, mild floral hops, bananas, spicy wheat and yeast, toffee. Somewhere between medium and full bodied for a wheat wine with ample carbonation. Worth your while."
"Bottle dated 2007, so that would put this around 27 months (2yr, 3mo) old. Pours hazy amber. Still has a good deal of carbonation, takes a minute to get going, but nice thin head. Smell is mostly sweetness, not much complexity. Tastes a bit oxidated, on top of that, alcoholic sweetness. Like malt soaked in grain alcohol. Not much complexity, but it's still pretty good. I think this has actually mellowed over the years. Alcohol contributes to the mouthfeel... alcohol isn't actually bittering at all, but it does make a nice warmth in the throat on the way down, like a good whiskey. Makes it very pleasant. Does make it more of a sipper, though. Either way, don't know if the aging added or subtracted to this beer, but it was a very interesting go!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. It's one of my favorite Smuttynose beers and a great sipper to end an evening on."
"Feel is where this shines as a style, whereas a barleywine tends to be thicker and slightly slick this is nice and creamy, carbonation is very low but held in the mouth produces some prickly feeling to let you know it is there."
"Though i don't know when in 08 this was bottled i believe the beer has mellowed considerably since fresh. Another tasty and easily quaffed concoction from Smutty."
"One finger tanish yellow head that didn't last long, turned to a ring around the glass. Moderate lacing. Smells like a mild bourbon, or port, ethanol dominates over everything. Wow. Flavor is a mild bourbon too, alcohol bomb, baby. Sweet malts, I can't tell that it's wheat. If this was a blind taste I'd just as easy guess this was a barley wine. Mouth is nicely carbonated, but the alcohol is pretty intense, almost like this was bourbon-barrel-aged, but I don't remember seeing that on the bottle. I think the drinkability suffers from the high alcohol heat, but give it a little time. Warming mellow the heat a bit, but not much."
"8/4/7/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"M/D - This drinks like any respectable barley-wine. Wheatwine is my new favorite style, for sure!"
"Terrific sipper."
"Thanks to ABHatter for this one. Never had a wheat wine but I love barleywines so here we go. Pours a classic barleywine deep amber with no head but a nice head. Smell is light English barleywine with a hint of fresh bread like a bakery. Taste is also like an English barleywine, a strong one at that. Caramel-toffee malts well balanced and very good. But then it gets weird. Not necessarily bad, just different. The taste fades to a light wheat while the solid malt backbone remains. Finally the finish is smooth crisp toffee that lingers. The alcohol is strong at first and masks the flavors of this complex brew but it actually blends better with warmth. Very interesting beer"
"Thanks to Rochefort10nh for this trade! This is my first wheat wine, so I'm not entirely sure what to expect, but here goes. Pours a dark amber color with no head and no lacing. Pretty much looks like a barleywine. Aroma is boozy, medicinal, fruity, a bit of oxidization, and a touch of earthy, herbal hops. I was expecting some more wheat characteristics, but really wasn't getting any. Taste is... different. There's a sugary sweetness, almost akin to Smarties candy, brown sugar, a decent wheat twang, a bit of caramel, some apple-like fruitiness and a small amount of bitterness in the background an earthy, herbal like quality that i can't quite place my finger on, and a certain booziness that really comes out as it warms. Warming in the glass really brings out the flavors of this brew and it gets better and better as I sip it slowly. This is definitely an interesting brew, quite unlike anything I've tasted before. It's somewhat reminiscent of a Belgian Quad. Medium-full bodied, light carbonation. This is a big-ass balls to the wall beer, which keeps drinkability low, but I was happy to have had the chance to try it."
"Smuttynose Wheat Wine is a cloudy red-orange-brown beer with a thin off-white head. It has a twangy, sweet aroma that seems a little resiny. In the mouth, it's fluffy and full bodied. It's quite smooth. It's well balanced-- a little bitter and a little sweet. I like this. It seems like a good barleywine. I'd never suspect that there was so much wheat in it."
"This one isn't the most drinkable in the world, but it goes down pretty easy."
"Dark orange pour with a small tan head, that soon diminishes to a film. Lots of fruit in the aroma, pear, mango, lychee, as well as some brown sugar, and (ominously) alcohol. For the taste my notes say BOOZE, and I did find it a bit to big, brash and young. The fruit in the aroma didn't seem so detectable, and was buried under waves of alcohol. Some brown sugar was also present. Definitely a candidate for aging. While the flavour disappointed, the body did not, and exhibited the light syrupy feel I would hope for, with a bit of chewiness. For drinkability my notes again say BOOZE. That's not good."
"still, why don't brewers make more wheatwines? this is quite nice."
"D: Definitely a sipper. It's big & boozy. I couldn't imagine having a whole bomber when it's this fresh!"
"Good, highly drinkable. Might pair well with a dry cheddar. My first sampling of this style. To be honest, if I didn't know it was a ""wheat wine"" I would have assumed it to be a barleywine. Nice flavor regardless. Strong, yet smooth. Full of flavor."
"Big aromas jump out of this right off the pour - pineapple, apple and raw malt dominate. Pours out a clear copper/brown with a weak-ish head that drops quickly due to a very low carbonation level. Flavour is big and heavy, with intense sweetness and maltiness as well as a heavy bitter finish. Everything about this beer says big. Surprisingly smooth for such a heavy malty body, with no detectable astringency or coarseness. This beer makes no attempt to mask the big alcoholic presence and lets it mingle freely with the other flavours. Very warming. Overall impression is (again) bigness, although well balanced flavours make it somewhat drinkable."
"I had this on tap at the local watering hole a few weeks ago and it blew me away so I had to try the bomber. It's not as heavy bottled as it was on tap, which makes for a smoother drinking experience. Definitely recommended, but not for the faint of heart."
"I cannot argue that this is a good value, however, it's way too boozy for me. A big ABV sipper with a great nose. Sorry Jay-Bone, just didn't cut it for me."
"Notes: Definitely an interesting and relatively complex brew that was quite a pleasure to sample. If you are into malt-heavy brews and looking for something slightly different, this would be one to pick up. Most definitely recommended to try and another great brew from this brewery."
"Out of a bomber this brew was a slightly hazy brown/garnet color with some ruby highlights. The one-finger head was khaki-colored, retained as a thin collar and left decent lacing. The aroma was sweet, caramel malt, sweet malt, wheat, alcohol and some butter. The flavors were also punchy and sweet, starting with lots of toffee and caramel it then went into lots of alcohol, notes of nuts and dry wheat with a lightly bitter finish at the end. As it warmed up I tasted more of the musty/cellared malt in the middle but it remained rich and potent throughout. The mouthfeel was average to smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation on the low side. The alcohol definitely caught up with me as I drank it, not a beer for the faint of heart... but it probably will age very well."
"This beer would probably chill out with age. Don't try and drink one of these by yourself (well, its' too big for me to handle 22 ounces in one sitting)."
"Fairly big in body, that's rather chewy in taste, for the size of this brew, it goes down as easy as? Malted milk? I like it and would gladly have it again...cheers."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a pretty tasty strong beer that's balanced enough to go down faster then it probably should! Still, the spiciness from the hops and booze are not insignificant, and while the body isn't too heavy, you're not going to easily chug this one. All and all, I'm a little disappointed. Not that it's a bad beer by any stretch, but more in the whole 'wheat wine' category - I just don't get much of a difference, maybe a slightly sour tang from the wheat, but nothing really special."
"be an interesting beer. I wonder what would happen to this one after some time on it."
"D: definitely feel the ABV -- not in a bad way. Enjoyed all 22oz but probably wouldn't order a second back-to-back."
"Drinkability is good for this level of flavor and abv. Very nice!!!"
"The finish was subtle, despite the 11% ABV (why is it that Smuttynose never has the ABV printed on their labels?) and went down very well."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts- Highly drinkably- probably dangerously so at 10.7%. This is probably my favorite wheat wine I've tried to date, and also one of my favorite beers period. I've got plans to try to start aging some as this does seem to mellow out and get better with age."
"D: One I need to take slowly... between the higher alcohol content and the sheer body of the beer, it's a slow going process. Not too shabby, though not the best of the 'Big Beer Series,' imo."
"Date consumed: 4 July 2008"
"This poured a beautiful dark, clear cherrywood color, with a bit of light tan head. It smelled very complex, like caramelized sugar and honeysuckle, sour cherry and raisin, cereal wheat, alcohol, and a bit of cinnamon and oak and molasses. It tasted complex too, like fresh caramel and raisin and sour cherry, with fig and subdued copper hops, as well as cultured yeast and alcohol. It was thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting sour and sweet aftertaste. I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer, but it was delicious. It seemed like it was already aged, but I'm not sure. Overall it was very well balanced and blended a million different flavors amazingly well. It had great body, and the noticeable alcohol seemed fitting for how big this beer is. It was so tasty, it remained very easy to drink, and highly rewarding to sip. Fantastic."
"Very smooth to start, followed by rough tastes caramel,and harsh toffee notes and then the heat kicks in with a cheap vodka like taste that creeps down your throat throughout the swallow. Very sweet, semi-watery."
"D- Drinking this stuff will put hair on your chest. Syrupy, sour with a stiff alcohol taste. This stuff would be a serious ""acquired taste"". One was more than enough for me."
"Definitaly worth a try and may be more palatable to those who fancy themselves as Barleywine afficionados(sp). For myself who is much more into the bitter beers it was a little much and I probably won't buy it again."
"D: While this is a well made beer, it's not my favorite. Still outside of the alcohol, the taste is very well done."
"So as far as drinkability you can get messed up pretty quick drinking this brew. It is not as smooth as other 10+ abv beers I have had but, I found it easier to drink as the night went on."
"D- I drank this with pure ease just because the flavors were so great. Smuttynose has a big winner here. I need to seek out more wheat wines. This one is awesome."
"This is a solid beer in the genre, but not the best of the bunch."
"Pours a very cloudy orange amber with a one finger off white head that settles quickly. Aromas of alcohol, wheat, caramel and dark cherry. Caramel and alcohol up front with some raisin, cherry, and lemon in the middle with a chocolate finish. Medium carbonation, medium to full body, starts out creamy and ends slightly chalky and dry. Solid drinkability for a 10.7% beer. Great mix of flavors."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good beer to keep drinking until the ABV catches up with you."
"D: Pretty drinkable, there was alot of alcohol in this one so it was a bit less drinkable, but it was an interesting taste."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a dark orange with a thick, sticky head. The smell is rather sweet, but not really remarkable for specific characteristics, perhaps a hint of alcohol. I did enjoy the taste. This full bodied beer is smooth as it goes down, initially malty sweetness followed by phenols and alcohol. The 11% abv is fairly well hidden, but this beer is a definite sipper. Even though this is my first wheat wine, I think it is a great style."
"Overall: Thanks to Mbrandon2w for the generous hook up. I am happy to have tried this beer. It is a new style, and I have been looking forward to it for quite some time now. I wouldnt say it is my favorite beer, or style, but I didnt think it was bad. Worth checking out."
"Very good and it's the first example of this style that I've had. I would probably buy another bottle to age as this has a bit much alcohol heat but would definitely smooth out with some aging. Need to seek out more examples of this style but I think this one is well done."
"Pours a handsome mahogany/ruby-red color, small tan head fades into a thin collar around the beer, and some interesting swirls of foam in the center of the snifter. Smell is heavy with caramel, almost syrupy sweet smells, faint citrus hop aroma. Smell is big and dangerous. I believe one previous review referred to caramel apples when describing the taste, and I couldn't agree more. Big juicy apple-flesh flavors, warming alcohol, and some bitter grapefruit on the back of the tongue. Velvety-smooth & thick, very very sticky, mouth-coating flavors, lingering spice/bitterness/alcohol burn. A sipper, for sure. Delicious beer from Smuttynose."
"I honestly dont catch the wheat portion of it, more notes of a barleywine, but doesnt mean I dont like it."
"Pours in a snifter with a auburn, copper, bourbon-like body w/ a 1-finger head that receeds quickly and leaves a little bit of lacings. The aroma is packed with a heavy, thick malt smell of caramel and other sugariness, plus some spices. A little bit of alcohol sips in, creating a warming sensation. Even though this is a mix, it really comes across as a barleywine. The sugariness and syrupiness comes through in a thick, almost full-body and is matched with a pronouced sourness. A heavy, almost alcohol burning taste on the tongue; just a tad smoothness. This is a good beer but much more barleywine that wheat (not an even mix). Still contains a dry, hot backbite that resembles a cinnamon burn - and retains drinkability. There's still a good amount of sweetnessl this beer is complete with nut, almond, roasted and other malts that give it that sweet edge. I'd have this again, but I'm not going to seek this out. Just a little too potent and a little too sugary for a sessioning."
"As sweet as this brew is it serves up a big kick with a warming finish. Definitely a sipper."
"An intense rush of syrupy (and sligtly sour) wheat and rich, candied malts greets the palate. The sweetness is immediately kept in check by a hearty dose of spicy, floral hops and a liquor-esque boozy warmth. Finishes with a complex blend of spice, alcohol, nuttiness, and some veggies. The body is a bit too viscous and heavy on the tongue, and the alcohol makes things sticky at times, but the mouthfeel significantly improves as the beer warms. A low carbonation level allows it to meld into a creamy, velvety malt bomb. Overall, this was a great beer and one helluva tasty sipper. I wish I had another bottle to age for a few years in the cellar."
"D = A tasty brew, definitely worth coming back to."
"As far as extreme beers go, this one meets the mark and then some. It is the truth."
"I really enjoyed this beer. First example of the style and I really think Smuttynose has a great interpretation here. I paired this with some really sharp cheddar cheese and it was excellent. The sharpness of the cheddar cuts through the booze, leaving behind the sweet sugars and fruits."
"Cloudy amber colored ale with a thin rapidly fading head.Aroma is alcohol and very faint caramel.Taste is alcohol and molasses.This is not as sweet as the barleywines I've tried yet still had a good amount of sweetness.Overall pretty good but not something you can drink a lot of in one sitting.I would recommend to try it at least once."
"The alcohol burn of this one makes it a definite sipper. Could use some time to cool off. Still, yet another compelling offering from Smutty."
"I wasn't taken by Smuttynose's Wheat Wine, but I was certainly happy I decided to hide one in the cellar way back when. The age seems to have done it well. I've never had a bad beer from the Smuttynose Big Beer Series. In fact, I've never even had anything less than a really good one. Like the other offerings, this is one I look forward to revisiting again later down the road."
"I bought two bottles! Yippeee!"
"Pours really thick looking like it has a high viscosity, a deep amber with a nice looking blotchy head on top. Aroma is a little weaker than I expected, very airy hops with a touch of light crystal going on there. The taste is pretty prevalently alcohol-y with really not a lot going on there. It tastes very clean other than the alcohol without a lot of roastyness or sweetness that really draws your attention. There's a moderate hop aftertaste but nothing overwhelming or similar to other barleywines I've had. I guess what differentiates this as a wheat wine is the smooth mouthfeel which is pretty nice, I just wish there was a little more flavor behidn it to back it up. I just brewed one of these and I think mine is signficantly more heavily hopped which I think would go well for this."
"D: Alcohol more noticeable when it warms on the tongue but still very easy to drink. Must try."
"3.5/4/4/4/3.5"
"A solid copper tone with a thin disappearing off-white head and very little lacing. A mild and pleasant malt and wheat, sort of rye and molasses aroma. This has a beautiful viscous feel, smooth and warming with alcohol. Very tiny carbonation, some herbal hops, lots of sweet toffee in a thick mix of malt and rye flavors. Not a big drinker but very satisfying."
"A very high powered beer that is light enough in personality to catch you unaware."
"Drinkability: Very good, very nice, and I wish I had some extra bottles of it on-hand. Heavenly and delectable! I certainly recommend it."
"Courtesy of tpd975 hooking our weekly tasting group up with a yummy barleywine. You know what I like!! Pours hazy copper with thin gold edges and thin tan head. The aroma is plums, prunes, crystal malts, sweet malts, pine hops and some alcohol heat. The taste is sweet sticky sugar malts mixing seamlessly with some caramel candy. Those rich tasty notes are followed by prunes, dried cherries, figs, pears and raisins. The wheated malt note isn't all that noticeable or less than I was expecting anyway. I can get a sense of the wheat just behind the rich malt and caramel goodness. Yeah, I can get used to drinking a bomber of this. Thanks again Greg."
"From Smuttynose BIG BEER series. 53% Wheat, 47% Barley. Brownish color, slightly hazy with a sweet hoppy aroma. Moderate head and lacing on the glass. The taste is hoppy with sweet caramel malts and a bit sour. Bitter finish. A pretty good combination of flavors. The flavor is a little lingering. I liked it and I'd drink it again."
"Drinkability: Even though it's filed to the brink with medicianl alchol, it's still worth a shot. Why? The reasons are because it's a Smuttynose beer, it's not expensive, and it's an obscure beer style. Smuttynose big beers always give you more bang for your buck! Would I ever drink this beer again? Probably not."
"D: Slow-going due to the alcohol. WAY hot."
"D: Pretty nice for a big bold beer."
"This is only the 4th new wheatwine I've tried but its probably the best, with the exception of aged versions of the Marin Starbrew."
"A very tasty beer, a real alcohol bomb. Can't say this is like other wheat wines I've had in that the wheat is not overly assertive. Excellent barleywine, probably shouldn't be drinking in mid July with high humidity."
"Overall not bad for my first experience with the style, not sure I will be going back to it with any kind of regularity, but none the less, still very good. I would have no issue in trying this one again, especially a fresh bottle of it!"
"D: Oh boy, halfway through half a bottle and my body's hurting. This is potent stuff."
"Smuttynose does make a good wheat wine. I'm surprised to read the label and see this is brewed using 53% wheat. That's a big number. The flavors come together really well and if the alcohol calmed down a little more this would be an excellent beer. I'd love to give it another shot."
"D: For what it is very drinkable but I have a long hour and a half in front of me. I really do enjoy the style too bad there are not that many examples out there."
"This is a sipper. I enjoyed it. 22 ounces of this stuff will go the distance."
"I could drink this all night. It's so strong in its alcohol notes it really needs to be paired with some food. A sharp cheddar or olives would be nice."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, not syrupy sweet, which helps the drinkability...although this one is definitely a sipper. This was my first beer in the wheat wine style, and I enjoyed slowly drinking this one. I'm very interested in trying other examples of this style."
"The taste starts with a nice bitter bite but moves quickly to a sweet fruity boozey feel on the palate. This is a nice dare I say thirst quenching beer, sweet fruity, spicy hop, doughy, sweet mouthfeel. This is a great offering from Smutty and would be a nice way to end the night."
"Overall Wheat Wine was interesting and unique but not one i'll seek out in the future."
"Drinkability has to take a hit because the alcohol was too prominent. Come on guys, you're a great brewery - let's have a little more of the malt flavor in this one!"
"Drinkability is moderate, this one is almost 11% and is certainly not hiding that (from me, at least). I couldn't finish the bottle (couldn't even finish half, actually), so I put it in the fridge to enjoy a little later and probably into tomorrow. Under the right circumstances I could certainly finish one bomber by myself in a night, but I wouldn't be very sober afterwards."
"Solid beer. Creamy mouthfeel with a classic English barley wine middle that shows hints of RS, raisin, Caramel,toffee, brown sugar, fig, date, and hints of milk chocolate. Alcohol is big in the mouth and throat. Wheat is subdued and really smooths out the finish and adds a sense of refreshing qualities with a good touch of carbonation. Spicey and herbal on the finish."
"This is too sweet for me, drinkability hurts."
"This is my first Wheat Wine. I felt this one was a little boozy, lowering its drinkability. It's a good beer though, with plenty of hops for those who want them. Recommended."
"Not as good as Triticus, or Brooklyn Monster Ale for that matter, but definitely in the same league, which is great praise coming from me. The aging didn't hurt this one bit."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a medium copper color ale with a medium size foamy head with some average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is dominating and reminiscent of a regular barleywine. Taste is also dominated by some sweet malt notes with some notes of caramel and toffee. Full creamy body is well done with some medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done but I can't say that the wheat notes were clearly discernable."
"This is a pleasant deviation from the typical barleywine/strong ale, because there's a stern spiciness to the flavor. There is a nice fruit/pine hop bite up front, and a big, sweet alcohol finish. I was impressed by this beer; unique and delicious."
"Definitely recommended..."
"This acts much like a barley wine on the pour. Thick, and heavy. The head is dying, then it is completely dead a few seconds after the pour. Slight cloudiness, very mild carbonation, amber/red in color. The smell is great. I smell apple peels, bread, candied fruits. Fruity esters, and sticky caramel. It has a great bite to it. There are also nutty undertones. The alcohol is a bit astringent as it stings my chapped up lips a bit. Very warming. The bitterness comes directly after the sweet bready initial malt flavor and it draws out for the rest of the sip until only residual sticky sugars and metallic hop oils are left. The hops are a bit much for me and I would like to age this on a couple of years to dive more into the complex malt side of things. The mouthfeel is hurt a little because of this. It is just too sharp and hot. The drinkability will increase with age, I'm sure."
"Drinks good for the ABV, but after a while the chewyness slows you down, This reminds me a lot of Stingo or some of the English barleywines I had when I lived in England. This is a good one to cap the evening off"
"D: I think this beer needs some time to settle a bit. The ""hotness"" of this beer really took something away for me. I hope to try it again with some age on it."
"Big body for sure. Overall this is a beer that could use some (a lot of) age. The hot phenolics really overpower some nicer hidden characteristics."
"I really want this to review this beer again!"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle. Decent fluffy white head. Hazy amber orange hue. Some hints of lace down the sides of the glass. The smell is slightly sour with a rather pronounced alcohol tone. Caramel like sweetness in the nose. Some fruity fig like scent perhaps raisins or some souring grape like tone. The taste was fruity and sweet. Nice subtle sourness in the back of the mouth. Decent wheat flavor much lighter than the traditional barley wine making for a nice lighter alternative. Alcohol is certainly making its self known with the aftertaste. Has a potent like alcohol essence as it warms to the room. Very complex flavors blend in the taste though. Subtle hints of vanilla and hints of caramel mix with the slight sourness. Decent mouthfeel smooth and enjoyable to drink. I would certainly drink this one slowly. Nice taste and it gets the cheeks rosy."
"Pours a reddish amber color with a medium bodied head that fades slowly into a nice lace. The smell is a nice little balance of malt and hops, with hints of spice and dark fruits. The taste is a bit more malt heavy. The fruit and hops are not as noticeable, butare present. A bit sweet at first, there is a tartness in the finish, with the crisp alcoholness of a barleywine. Goes down smooth and hides the ABV well, and is a very solid offering from the Smutty guys."
"d: Smuttynose is a great brewery and I love the fact that they are willing to try different things like this. I almost couldn't finish this though, it was just too hot."
"This is an interesting, somewhat odd beer. My first wheatwine so I didn't know what to expect. The lack of lacing didn't detract for me because of the surprisingly good head retention. The taste was odd- it really is a mix of the three points they say on the bottle- barleywine sweet character, tart wheat, and bitter hops. They are all pretty well defined but at the same time I'm unsure if I'm happy with the balance- the tart wheat and bittering hops especially are in full effect. Given the chance, i'd revisit this beer again, and this style as well."
"The beer pours an amber/red color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale, wheat, and crystal malt scent that shows it's elevated abv., but also lends itself to a lighter body and malt aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a warm, malty flavor that goes down slow and steady and finishes bitter with a powerful alcohol bomb. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed beer with loads of complexity, but it's definately a sipper beer. This one will take a while to drink."
" Pours a very cloudy orange, golden light hued color with just a quarter inch of head that quickly forms a light trace. Aromas burst forth with bright, toasted malt, lots of esters, a slight cheesiness, candy sweetness and a big load of alcohol. So far it's a slight improvement. On the palate, the barleywine similarities are obvious. A heavy slickness with medium carbonation, candy sweet malts with a distinct wheat note, a bit of toffee and a stinging alcohol finish. I wish there was more hop complexity in this beer because beyond maybe Northern Brewer, there's virtually nothing coming from the hops. They claim there's a heavy dose, but besides a vague bitterness and slight herbaceous note, there's nothing. Overall, I'm still new to the style, but this one is a good offering."
"pours straight up crayola certified amber, with a very thin white head that laces very well. the nose is like an american barleywine or perhaps a mellow I.P.A., hops grab your attention right away. the taste starts off mellow as well, the hop bite/flavor comes out close to the end, however the finish is smooth not bitey as the late hop emergence would have you think. the mouth-feel is with the exception of when the hops first rear there head is smooth as can be, a very nice texture. drinks very very easy for it's abv, this is an overall impressive beer, i highly recommend this"
"Pours a clear ruby/orange with good head (vigorous pour) that dissipates into a ring and thin film in about two minutes. smell is very similar to a barleywine with a little more spice. Great flavor. Barleywinish, but with more spice and seems a bit smoother than most barleywines. Spicy with dark fruit flavors. Lots of malt flavor, wheat is there but not as strong as I expected. This is really like a barleywine other than the strong spice on the finish. some hop bitterness verrrryyy distant in the aftertaste. kind of slight (very) apple taste on the finish. Suprised at how distant the hops are on the end of this. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but quite good. Drinkability gets exceptional marks, as the abv is well hidden and it goes down very smooth. A great offering from smuttynose, and one I would love to put a couple years on. But for that I will need another bottle. ohhh Brian..."
"definitley a slow sipper, but one to be savored. more on the sweet side than some might prefer, so it looses some points for balance but a delicious stand it to dessert wines of all sorts."
"Props to Smutty for trying something different, but this one didn't do much for me. Give it a shot if you come across it, just so you can say you've tried a genuine Wheatwine."
"D- it's simply not a beer I would want to have very much of. I split a bottle 6 ways and had more than enough. I probably won't have it again."
"D - An enjoyable sipper. I might give this just a bit more time next time but still good."
"This is intense, moody, and as such, not wholly agreeable at all times. But it is worth sifting through on occasions. It can be a chore and a challenge, but it does reward in full. At less than $4 a bomber, it's worth putting up with some of it's bristle more frequently. State of mind can dictate when this is consumed, not wallet. I like that."
"At 10.7% ABV, this wheat wine makes no bones about its alcohol prowess. It is definitely a sipper, ideal for savoring on a cold night."
"Drinkability: Borders on overwhelming the palate. Warming and hearty, this beer is excellent for my 50-degree house."
"G"
"Overall- Very fruity and boozy. Not bad but the alc. is just to much for me."
"This is 2007 edition. The label is idyllic and you will be too if you finish a bomber of this. Great deep caramel color and nose. Taste heads straight for nyquil yet takes a turn right before cherry. Long , long, long finish that tends to fade into one dimension, maybe licorice? This is drinkable as long as you plan on sitting, my bomber felt like it packed much more wallop than the 10% abv would suggest. I had been eyeing this brew for awhile and it did not dissapoint, definitely has some wine characteristics as suggested by the label. Will look for more to cellar!"
"Pours a hazy orange/brown, thin off white head forms, leaves some spots, decent layer. Smell is fruity, some cedar/oak woodiness, citrus, grapefruits, buttery, some toffee and alcohol. Taste is caramel, very malty, wheat, fruits, dry oak, alcohol, citrus, very thick rich flavour, moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Pretty solid beer, Smuttynose can do no wrongs. Thanks Stan!"
"So... My impressions are... That this is like some kind of weird variation on a smutty barleywine. I get common characteristics out of it - I see how it's got a very similar mouthfeel and the flavor is close. The hops are probably pretty darned similar too - except in terms of bitterness (where this is much less bitter than their barleywine). I guess... I'd say that this was for the beer drinker who likes big body and nice hop flavor without the bitterness. In that context, is it fair of me to call it just above average? Maybe? It's my first wheat wine - I'm not entirely sure what to expect of the style! I guess... I'd think it better with more flavor or bitterness and perhaps even a bit less residual sweetness (unless there's a lot more bitterness to balance that out). Decent, but I won't go out of my way to get another bottle."
"Thanks to bjohnson for sending this many months ago..."
" This is one of the most bad-ass brews you can find in NH period."
"Pours a hazy deep orange with an initial finger of head, that melts down to a nice lacing after a few minuets. The smell comes on strong of sweet malts and biscuit with a slight aroma of floral hops towards the end. The taste also starts strong and malty, but not overpowering even with the abv. The alcohol becomes present with the balanced finish. Overall one of my favorites from smutty. A solid mouthfeel, and quite drinkable."
"A sharp sweetness hits up front couple with a tart bitterness. A light oak flavor helps to balance the sweetness and mute the alcohol flavor that is present but not over powering. There are nice light yeasty esters that fit in well. More grassy herbal hops in the finish, you can really taste the dry hops. I like the light carbonation, I think it complements this beer well. I could drink this one all day but won't since the 11% ABV would quickly catch up with me."
"Smooth mouthfeel from the wheat is enjoyable and the light carbonation enhances the effect. Drinkable, but a sipper. All around enjoyable albeit not amazing, but worth a try. I'd like to try this age another year or more and see what develops."
"I like."
"All in all... a well put together beer from Smuttynose.... congrats."
"A rare style done well."
"Drinkability - unique and definitely a sipper. The 10.7% ABV is all there."
"Poured into a chalice a nice slightly cloudy ruby red color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy off-white head, only some small islands left behind. The nose is slightly sweet of cherries, malts, slight oak, and some caramel. The taste is a little sweet, malty/oak, spicy, and some caramel. The alcohol is pretty up front on this one, nice warming feeling going down. Medium body. Drinkable, but not really a fan."
"Mouthfeel is big and chewy with a fast moving carbonation. The brew is not overly heavy, it sits just right for me and spot on for the style. I will say this is easily the best wheat wine I have sampled to date and I wish I had bought and cellared more bottles because it will be sad to see this one go. Smutty has a winner here and if you're hanging onto any 2005 bottles, they are drinking mighty fine right now."
"Exceptionable Barley/Wheat wine. I try to limit myself to 2 beers at a time, but 2 of these 22 oz babies is like a six-pack for alcohol. No real head to speak of, but the beautiful coppery color makes up for it. You can really smell the wheat, and it puts Sam Adams to shame. (Itself a good wheat) You can smell the alcohol too, but that's expected for a barley wine. It could use a tad more hops and my ""low"" score for drinkability is only due to its unchugability. At $4.59/22oz a bargain. Not to be missed, but not for Budweiser fans."
"D: Nothing about this one stands out for me. Good for the value, but not an outstanding beer."
"Deep orange in color. Small fluffy white head. Somewhat metallic and sharp aroma. I think it is trying to be ""crisp"" but lacks the cleanliness to pull it off. Malty flavor with a distinct bready and yeasty flavor. Somewhat citrusy. Quite boozy with a definate alcohol presence. While thick and malty it is lighter then a usual barleywine. Ok mouthfeel-some dryness in the finish. Overall not too impressive. Ok but I wouldnt go out of my way to find this."
"Don't know how this one tastes fresh, but it's not so good aged. Needed more malt to balance the edginess and the alcohols stood too tall and were too abrassive for my preference. Bummer of a drinker tonight. By holding off temptation I built high expectations and they were definitely not met. 5 or 6 sips into it and I found it rather too brutal to drink more. Blech!"
"If you like Smuttynose or just barleywines in general, this is a good pick."
"This beer pours an orange-bronze-caramel color with a nice, stable white head. Slight haze, but otherwise the appearance is very appealing. The smell is a mix of wheat grist, alcohol, complex fruit esters, and spice. Its got a little citric qualities thrown into the mix, making it an interesting aroma. The taste is sweet and strong, with an immediate warming sensation. This is a sipping beer for sure. The wheat is present through the entire taste, which retains a lot of fruit and a little malt character. Theres not much in the way of hops in this beer, and it could use a bit more balance. Full in body, this is a thick beer with some serious substance. I couldnt have too many of these, but its spectacular nonetheless."
"If this were available on a regular basis, Id probably be waking up at the end of the line more often. Its delicious and it its dangerously drinkable. They were pouring this at the Blind Tiger for their SmuttFest. It pours a reddish amber, and ¾ of an inch of head left some chunky lacing on the glass. The nose is intense  a base of heavy caramel malts, with some tangy fruits and alcohol to brighten things up. At first, this tastes a lot like a barleywine, but then these sweet grains emerge to mask the alcohol, and the finish is a nice blend of tangy and bitter, which makes this go down super easily for something with this high ABV. Despite the big full body, carbonation and a tangy bitter finish keep this remarkably light in the mouth. Dangerously drinkable, as they say."
"Dark buckwheat colour and taste, with different wheats. If you like wheat beer, this is a must try- it will be more aggressive. If you like barleywine-it's a tasty variation. Drinkable.Had on draft at Prime 16 3.5 years later and good mouthfeel, fruitiness. A barleywine. ('09 aged version)"
"This is my first foray into the wheat wine style and I have to say that it was a good one. It's like a barleywine, but not nearly as heavy. I'd definitely be interested in trying more, and I'd encourage more breweries to give this style a go. Definitely recommended."
"Cheers!"
"22oz bomber; this wheat-barley wine is an interesting concept, so Im intrigued to try it. It pours a bronze-orange color with just a thin fuzzy top and moderate carbonation. The aroma is definitely barley-winish with a big syrupy sweetness to it, but theres also an interesting orange twist to it. The first taste is perplexing ot me ... its overtly tangy, almost like a dry blood orange, that makes you shiver and squint. The strong alcoholic burn intermingles with this very earthy, dry citric bite in an odd way. I dont think Im diggin the combination. The more I sip at it and it warms, the flavor combinations start to give it a medicinal bite. (#2756, 3/18/2007)"
"Drinkability: Overall this is a nice beer and I will have it again. The aftertaste feels off but I am unsure why."
"FIRST TRIAL: On tap at the Landmark 1850. This was an unobjectionable brew. I've only had a few other wheat wines, but this was the closest to many of the barleywine's I've had, however, it was quite a bit less extreme in terms of flavor. The beer was a nice copper with a quickly diminishing head. There was very little aroma though (similar to the flavor). There was a slightly sweet/fruity malt taste, and a little bit of hop bitterness, with a reasonably smooth finish that didn't taste very alcohol-y (maybe the wheat?). This beer wasn't bad, there just didn't seem to be that much to it. I enjoy a few Smuttynose products, but don't know if I'd order this one again."
"This is a good cold night sipping ale."
"M/D- great variation on the barley wine...heavy for a wheat based beer...light carbonation, full flavor and big alcohol....I definitely want to seek more wheat wines out and I have a bottle of this in my fridge right now."
"Average beer. The style is rarely seen, and as such, this one isn't comparable to many others. Pair this with strong cheddar. A bit on the strong side, which overpowers other good qualities."
"Pours a nice amber-orange in color with a slightly off-white head that was initially about an 1/8"" but disappeared almost immediately. Smell is cirtusy, hoppy, malts, wheat, and maybe molasses. Taste is ok, earthy and citrusy hop presence followed by some malts, and some alcohol. Good mouthfeel, nice full body and a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is ok. The high alcohol content definitely makes this a sipper but overall I'm not really impressed. The taste just really doesn't do too much for me. I'm unable to really detect enough wheat here to call this a wheat wine. That being said I'd drink this again but won't go out of my way to do so."
"Medium thickness, but a bit bubbly. Bites you on the way down. This is some heavy drinking, more akin to a liquor than a beer. Gets better as it warms up."
"This is a great looking brilliant copper colored beer with a nice slightly off white head. It has a great hoppy aroma with primarily spruce aromas. There is a bunch of malty sweetness and the pronounced bitterness that I expected, but there is a creamy smoothness in the background that is likely the wheat speaking. I have several other bottles that I will let age and then try them again."
"Poured out a semi opaque orange brown with a thin light tan head. The nose offers grapefruit, hops, some alcohol, a bit of cherry, prune, and pine. The taste was bitter, with a strong alcohol bite and burn, hops. Lots of burn, not a lot of body or flavor. Eh, not a huge fan. It's a lot to get through, with big bitterness and alcohol, and not enough of anything else to make it interesting."
"D-at 10.7%abv, this is definately not a session ale, but it is a nice beer to sip on a cold day in Milwaukee while brewing a big-ass Quadrupel with a good friend."
"Overall a decent beer. Not sure I consider it something special, or one I would look to go back to."
"Very drinkable and certainly sessionable. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys wheat beers of any sort. Think ill be asking barleywinebrewer to get his hands on more of this for me in the future."
"stock up if you can. Enjoy! One of the top brews of the style in my humble opinion."
"Thanks to BA Fantasy Football and bjohnson for the beer."
"Not sure I'd get this again if SN Bigfoot or Anchor Old Foghorn is available. But it's a pretty decent drink for later in a chilly evening when winding down with a book and some music (for me right now it's actually the Boston Globe and Billie Holliday). And it's not a bad price."
"Nice effort from Smutty - really enjoying this one."
"Despite its heat, I found this very drinkable and yet another hit from southern NH."
"Notes of apricots, cedar and tobacco. Little head retention, but it's almost as velvety as it is fiery. This beer is now to be a staple in my household--on hand to be savoured with a spread of smoked, salty delights."
"Poured in a Guinness pint glass . Had bland apricot color . Smell of wheat & sweetness . The taste however is awful .Keeping an open mind and trying to give this brew a chance was tough . 3/4 of the way through I felt like dumping it in the sink and out to Dorchester Bay . With each swallow felt like drinking cologne . Was looking forward to trying this and was not impressed ."
"The mouthfeel is near perfect here. Full bodied with a nice tart afterbite. The alcohol flavor is minimized quite well. This one is very drinkable. In fact, I think I will remain seated for awhile as not to break valuables around la casa. A perfect beer for the snowy day here in NC (yes I said snow)."
"M&D - so smooth and sweet, without being only sweet or too sweet, very nice, and highly drinkable considering the ABV."
"But hey! Thanks a ton to bjohnson for the chance to partake of this."
"Thank you very much MuenchenerKindl for this one."
"Simply put, this is a fantastic beer."
"D- It is a sipper and a very strong in alcohol beer. I think it is a bit rough. Would love to see how this would be after a few years (if you are even supposed to age these?). I think the marin triple wheat ale is more refined than this one."
"Drinkability is decent. You can tell this is a huge beer but it is well disguised. At less than $4 a bomber, I will be going back for as many of these as I can. I wonder what it tastes like aged?"
"this certainly belongs in the big beer series and would be fine if aged"
"This review of a bottle of Smuttynose Wheat Wine was at a warmer temperature, which lead to a greater accentuation of flavors and a higher score."
"I feel like if a beer is 10.7% abv, you should really mark that on the label. Labeling aside, this was an interesting beer and definatley one that could benefit from cellaring. It was still good, but a touch boozy. It tasted of rich wheat and barley malt with fruit coming out and a finishing bitterness, but still tasted hot. Worth a try if you want to try the biggest wheat beer around in the Northeast (or anywhere)."
"22oz bottle from Smutty's Big Beer Series. A hazy red/orange color with very little head. It had a flowery, sweet aroma. A sharp, crisp hop presence. This is a pretty assertive beer, one made for sipping and quiet contemplation. Definitely not a session beer."
"pours an orange amber with very little head. kind of suprising with all the wheat in it. you can smell this beer across the room. very fruity, possibly apricot. the high abv also seems to be present in the nose. i was thrilled about the first sip, but to be honest, as i got a few sips into it, the beer definitly grew on me. i don't have a ton of barleywine experience but this one stacks up pretty solid. i dig the addition of the wheat, it definitly adds something to the mix. i have never been disapointed in a smuttynose offering and this is no exception. sessionable....probably not the best idea, delicious...hell yes."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass kind of a odd mix of deep burnt orange with ruddy brownish hue to it a thinner but well formed slight off white head atop.Boozy and quite sweet aromas like alcohol dipped apricot and a nutty terrine malt presence not much hop to be had here,definently a malt based big brew with a sweet alcohool kick dried apricot and dare I say applesauce flavors mixed with alcohol burn,definently flavorful and definently ballsy.Iam finishing the bomber and I will sleep well tonight,glad I tried it it really warms the insides."
"A slow sipper. Sharp. An interesing brew - something different, but not interesting or flavorful enough to revisit."
"Pours burnt orange to copper in color, fairly clear, small off white head fades away quickly. Raisiny sweet maltiness in the aroma along with a ripe fruit warm boozy alcohol smell. There is some pruney sweetness in the taste along with some citrusy hops and a noticeable alcohol presence. A crisp alcohol and slightly dry bite in the finish, are preceded by a medium bodied somewhat chewy maltiness. Interesting beer, although I don't get much wheat beer characteristics in it, maybe just a hint of wheatiness behind the malts and also contributing to the body. It definitely seems like an ipa/dipa-barleywine hybrid. This bottle is an 06, I look forward to an aged sample of this one, but an enjoyable warming beer to relax with now as well."
"In the end, the unmasked alcoholicity of Smuttynose Wheat Wine has worn down whatever enthusiasm I had during the first third of the bottle. I thought that I gave it enough time to rest, but it looks like another 18 months wouldn't have been out of the question. While it might improve a fair amount over that time, I don't believe that it will ever be great beer."
"Another ""big beer series"" winner from Smutty. This is the only wheat wine I've eve come across, so I can't compare it to others, but I do enjoy the beer completely. Others may taste the beer as it is... hot and boozy.... but I taste potential. I think this one will age very well. There is enough of a hop presence, and enough alcohol, to let this age for quite a while. I think I'll buy a few more bottles and let them sit for a couple years. It really is a great beer, and will only improve with age. I'd hope to see some of the wheat characteristics come through with age, once the hops and alcohol subside a bit. But highly recommended in any case. Smuttynose rarely disappoints. And at only $3.69 a bomber, this is one of the best bang for you buck beers out there. Simply can't beat it for the price."
"22oz bomber with classier than average label art. This beer is a balance of big flavors. Floral herb aroma hops,tangy fruitiness,bright wheat,barley malt caramelized sweetness, alcohol presence in nose and taste and a fine bubble bottle conditioned carbonation that adds to complexity and mouthfeel. Bright tasting for a barley wine and un-like any I have ever tasted. No one element of the flavor stands out as this is a balance of all the supporting characters. One weak link would bring the whole beer down. This is a beer that I'm not sure I would have liked in my youth(10-15yrs ago), but is just the type of challenging beer I now seek. Another excellent brew from Smuttynose."
"Overall: This is my first Wheat Wine, so I'm not sure how it compares to other examples of the style. I enjoyed it."
"Overall I found this brew interesting. Flavor profile isn't as balanced as I would prefer. The alcohol sweetness is a little overpowering. Still, this is a tasty offering that is recommended. Let this one warm a bit to get the fullest flavor."
"A bit to harsh with alcohol lowers the drinkability although the flavors are quite good, definitly a sipper."
"The cap popped with a weak hiss. Crystal clear amber with an orange hue. A vigourous pour resulted in a thin head that quickly fell to a ring. Just a bit of spotty lacing initially. Crackery malt aroma, some caramel, with a floral and powdery hop aroma. Toffee and faint alcohol were present as well. Ripe tropical fruit became fairly strong as it warmed. Moderate bitterness with a malty start, a bit crackery, fruity (a bit of citrus, very mild ripe berries). Caramel at the mid. Towards the end, alcohol really moved to the front and lingered through the finish. Lighter bodied than I expected, quite dry, with low carbonation that resulted in a flat mouthfeel. Not bad. I enjoyed it, but wasn't overwhelmed. Still, this is a solid beer."
"Rather weak, thin mouthfeel precedes a beer that is brimming with vibrant fruit flavors. Pear and lychee dominate the landscape with notes of candied apples present as well.	 This is somewhat onesided, with all of the flavors leaning towards the fruit spectrum of things. Alcohol is detectable towards the finish, and slightly distracting. A tasty beer, though not overly complex."
"My first Wheat Wine, sweet. Pours a nice reddish color with a small white lace heading. Also many champaigne like bubbles rising to the top. Smell contained some sweet honey, ripe red fruit...im thinking strawberry, and a certain cream taste as well. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and pretty damn easy to drink. Alcohol is hidden particularly well with this beer. While it is similar to Barleywine in many ways, this beer still has a personality all its own. I really enjoyed this bottle, and I think i will be going back for more in the near future."
"I plan on buying a few, cellaring them, and opening one each year and see how these babies age. All the great flavors and complexity is there, just the alcohol bite is too much at this point."
"Received way back in the day from, I think, ppoitras in BiF 24...and cellared since then."
"2005 Vintage"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Soft in the mouth, with just a hint of cutting carbonation... the alcohol shows some balls here, while the ingredients struggle to maintain their relatively decent balance. This bomber is one that should be enjoyed with at least one other enthusiast."
"This was my first Wheat Wine, and I definitely enjoyed the use of bringing the 2 different styles together. Part Barleywine, part Wheat Ale, equals a lovely beer. Just like this one. Highly recommended. Much thanks to Bill for the sample."
" Full mouthfeel, with a long finish. This is the most drinkable wheat wine I have yet tasted."
"This brew looks and smells like a barleywine, yet its flavor profile shows off something completely different. Pours a clear copper with no head and very little lacing. Mostly sweet-smelling, strawberries mixed with citrusy hops and caramel. Not as thick or sticky as its barleywine counterpart; it seems the wheat may thin and lighten the body. Esters run wild initially, yielding to some soft wheat notes with touches of orange peel throughout. Mildly spicy and a bit tart towards the finish, which leaves very little taste or flavor in the mouth; this surprised me, as I expected a long, lingering finish. Nonetheless! Now that I've tried a few of this style, I can say this is not the best I've had, but still pleasant and enjoyable. Watch out for the booze though!"
"Another great big beer from the folks at Smutty."
"Interestingly enough, even after about a year, this could use some more time in the bottle. Perhaps a bit more age will perk up the malt complexity and mellow the hops a bit more. As it is though, this is quite tasty and I certainly could do with a few more of these in my cellar."
"Last swigs: Dry vanilla meets grain short pier walk. Nice attempt."
"The heat/warmth of this beer is mightily present. It'll hold ya back some, but not much, as this is a solid treat from the folks at Smuttynose."
"22 oz bomber poured into a tulip wine glass. Moderate head, which is to be expected with a big beer like this. Recedes to a light lace. Color is a beautiful warm smokey amber color. Smell is quite sweet and malty. There is a alcohol warmth undertone. Taste is earthy and malty and a bit of honey. I definately can taste the wheat. Very vinious. Mouthfeel is warm and full with a pleasant alcohol burn. This is fantastic beer, everything that I expected for the style and more. I would love to get a few more bottles to celler and pull out for special occasions."
"Drinkability: I like the style and the example. I just wish there were more available. Thanks to BeerBeing for the bottle."
"Poured a Hazy very deep amber color with miniscule head. No lacing. Smell is fruity and a bit like sour wine, but not at all unpleasant. Taste is loaxded with alcohol which seems to overshadow any other aspect of this beer. Finished with a strong alcohol tang which is not at all enjoyable. Not my style of beer."
"A rich, sweet, candy-like beer, I would rate the drinkability lower than I really want to, as it's a pretty dominating sweetness. And with such a high ABV (11%), this is clearly one for slow sipping on special occasions only. But its spirit and uniqueness is undeniable."
"Smooth and creamy, once you get past the big alcohol bite (so that's why the head didn't last and mine is getting red and warm). Loads of candied fruits with some apple and citrus. Caramel and bready tastes too.Finished a bit sweet, but went down mighty easy."
"Drinkability  This went down well enough and is nice to split with someone. I really appreciate BeerGuy bringing this out on his visit to Seattle as I know these Wheat Wines can be quite pricey."
"Drinkability & Notes  The in check mouthfeel and light carbonation make this a beer that is easy to drink, that is aside from the pungent alcohol. Even though I held off drinking this one for a few months, it looks like I should have waited until next winter for the alcohol to calm down."
"Overall, a good beer. I've had a few wheat wines and this one isn't really like the others, but it's still a very good beer."
"Bright crimson hued. It is lacking aroma, unfortunately and I wonder why. Light hints of fruit and coconut, but its very subtle overall. Flavor is very rich and enjoyable, with coconut flavors so authentic, it makes you think it was aged in some barrel. White pepper, butter toffee and cream flavor, with a soft, succulent smooth texture. Wish the aroma was better, but this is still a very nice, enjoyable beer."
"12 oz would have been plenty."
"Notes: A certainly unique style of beer very enjoyable."
"Smutty's wheat wine pours a hazy amber red-orange. Very nice color. Thin head dissapates to nice ring of bubbles. Leaves nice lacing. Aroma is sweet and vanilla. Taste is sweet syrupy vanilla, fluffy wheat, and a slight sherry, fruity flavor with a strong alcohol warmth. Nice thick, full body. A rare and delicious treat."
"888"
"Interesting beer, my first wheat wine  Im up for more."
"This beer is interesting but not spectacular. I'd like to try Smuttynose's Barley Wine for comparison."
"Taste is also fruity at first with orange flavors, then a bit of bread, then the alcohol bomb, very astringent. The alcohol bomb made me think of almond extract, I don't know why but it did. The low carbonation and medium mouthfeel didn't do much for me. I didn't enjoy this beer that much, I need to try more beers in this style to get a good baseline."
"Drinkability is well horrible wouldn't want to try again unless they fix it or its 5 years old maybe. Want to thank Sam (merlin48)anyway for sharing this one it was at the end of our review session so had good buzz but didn't help this poor brew one bit."
"What amazed me about this beer( my first wheat wine) was the smoothness and drinkability at less than one year old. The hops were there and so was a background complexity but unlike many barley wines there was instant drinkability. Not sure how aging would benefit this beer but at 11 % it probablyt won't hurt either. All in all a real smooth operator at a dangerously high ABV."
"11%? Hoo, boy...it's creeping up on me..."
"This pours a cloudy golden red with a small tan head. A very different color. The smell is very sweet with some fruit,raisins? The taste is very bold with some fruit tastes and carmel aftertones. This does have a wine/brandy fell to it. This m/f is heavy and pretty well balanced,but you can taste the alcohol. This is a pretty good beer,with some flaws,but you can do worse."
"D - Again outstanding! I am not a heavy drinker, I cannot handle that much, but this was easy to drink. I finished the bomber myself and survived with no ill effects. It proved delectable at all temperatures. A bomber of this is a session! I would not try to match foods with this beer. I might have it again, although not soon (a volume issue more than anything). However, it has inspired me to try more of the big beer series."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I was expecting something a little big bigger with more body and more malt to it, but as it is, it's very drinkable. And although the 11% alcohol is there, it's not really too distracting (although I guess that knowing it's there helps you to prepare for it). It's got a very nice appearance with a hazy reddish-orange-copper body, but there's little head and even less lacing, which I thought was odd for a beer with 53% wheat (even if it does have a high alcohol content). Hops are noticeable in the nose, along with some very nice yeasty fruitiness and a flicker of alcohol, and it's quite welcoming. It's smooth across the palate with a very fine bubbled, restrained carbonation and medium body. In the flavor it's lightly sweet and somewhat candyish, but still well-balanced, and the malt and hop bitterness seem to have a tug of war going on until the finish where the bitterness overcomes. The alcohol is more apparent here than in the nose, and it rises up at mid-palate, and remains a bit in the finish. However, it does lend a bit of pepperiness that helps to balance the malt and give it greater depth of character. Overall, an interesting tipple."
"Bottle provided by Brewfan. Many Thanks! Pours a cloudy apricot body that seems to glow. No real head or lacing, not unexpected for this style. Aroma was surprisingly subdued, featuring notes of wheat malt, cedar, stale wine, and vague fruits. Mouthfeel is medium ot light medium bodied with low carbonation. Taste is slightly vinous, with notes of dry white wine. Mild wheat wafer notes become toasty wheat as it warms. A bit phenolic and hot. Fruity notes are vague and understated. Felt like I was drinking rocket fuel, at times. Alcohol is upfront and in your face with this one. A decent wheat wine that I wish I had cellared for a couple of years."
"I found myself in the rare position of having to drink this bottle by myelf. One glass would be more than enough of this big beer on any given night. I drank the whole bottle and found myself in bed and asleep by 9pm. Seems a tad sharp and the alcohol is not well hidden. Other than that I find it interesting, I've never had this style before so wasn't really sure what to expect."
"Scarlet red-orange body. Thin light beige head. Recedes to a thin collar that leaves sporadic lace. Aroma is alcohol and fruits and more alcohol. Passion fruits mostly. Kiwi and mango come to mind. Oh, and a little pepper as well. Upon tasting, I find out that this beer packs a little punch. Well, maybe a big punch. Alcohol is hidden in no way whatsoever. Spicy and hot. And lingering. There are some good qualities to go along with that. The fruits are there. And some rich barleywine-esque malt characteristics. Just not enough to make this taste any better than average to me. Besides the heat, the mouthfeel is also lightly carbonated and close to medium in body."
"Pretty powerful stuff, 22oz bottle. Pours a deep orange color. My nose is stuffed up but can taste well. What I do taste? Hops galore, very citrusy is flavor, slight alcohol warmth balanced by the hops. Mouthfeel is really nice. Not something you can knock back one after the other but something to enjoy over a long period of time. That's what I'm doing here!! :)"
"M & D: Medium/full body. A smooth, yet formidable brew. Drinkability is good, despite the well-disguised alcohol content. It was quite a challenge to knock one back by myself. I haven't had any wheat wines before that I can compare it to, but this was definately satisfying. Try it out."
"A modest tan head of small and large bubbles tops a new penny copper colored liquid. There are a handful of carbonation streamers lazing their way to the surface. The smell is big and hoppy; piney and sappy with hints of malt sweetness. The first taste is medicinal in a high alcohol way. Finishes astringent, almost whiskey-like with its alcohol heat. It has a big body and is only somewhat malty, but the alcohol dominates, and it is not well integrated or balanced. I could not find a hint of the wheat notes I expected. Barely drinkable."
"22 oz., bottle conditioned - served in a snifter. Pours an amber with hints of red and a 1 finger white head that leaves a collar and some lacing. It smells of citric and herbal hops, apricots, pine, pineapple, and some tingly alcohol. The first taste reveals the tart/tangy characters and a thick body with low carbonation. It's followed with citric/herbal hops, pineapple, apricot, sweetness, vinous malts, tobacco?, and a pretty good bitterness - essentially a barley wine with a wheat kick and tanginess. Fairly good, but could be better. I'm gonna try to find other examples of the style though."
"Popped this open because the spouse fried up a panful of oysters. The wife enjoyed this with these succulent shellfish. But let's look at it on the individual merits. This pours a dirty orange, cloudy, and no head to speak of. Nose is a chalky sugar odor with no malts or hops discernible. Taste follows with another chalky sugar soaked alcohol bath of the tongue. There is an abrupt cherry prune flavor but it isn't all that pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium but the taste gets in the way. To be sure I've tried this after having two stouts and a tripel, but I expected much more from this."
"Not quite a session beer, but this is a wonderfully unique ale that should be sought after. Well crafted and very unique...exactly what I've come to expect from my bros in NH."
"Never had this style before and it wasnt too bad. Apparently is a hybrid between a barely wine and a wheat ale and, in some ways, its the best of both worlds; hoppier and more drinkable than your average barely wine, but tastier and richer than many wheat ales. Certainly worth a try, though I bet that some aging would be a good idea. Recommended."
"It's sinewy and slinky, saucy and sassy, and intriguing blend of grain and hops. It is large, flexing strong ABV muscles that kick quite stoutly. While that imits things slightly, the sweet and snappy nature stand tall and make each sip a treat. The only downside is that, as part of the brewery's Big Beer series, the availability will be limited, but anticipation becomes a good thing indeed in the hands of Smuttynose."
"Glad I had this beer. Definitely an interesting introduction to the style, and it wasn't all bad. I enjoyed sipping it for a few hrs this cold afternoon. But I would like to try some different interpretations of the style in the future."
"Drinkability: I'm having no trouble finishing this bottle. The hops are balancing out the sweetness enough for me so it's not cloying. Yes, it's a sipper for sure, and this small Delirium glass is the trick I think; you can maybe get way too much in a snifter when 10 ounces is probably more than sufficient upon the refills. But yes, try this. It's been a great experience, and I can't wait to cellar a few to see what happens to them. Cheers to a style I certainly will pursue in the future."
"I found this beer to be very tasty. However, the alcohol tended to dominate each sip and kicked my butt."
"Drinkability: Not good. Stong, dark and gorgeous. I can't drink Neha Dhupia, best I know, but I'll be damned if I won't try."
"The ber poured a pale orange unfiltered color with a thin watery head which disappated quickly. The smell got more intense as it warmed, as did the taste. It smelled fo wheat and hops mainly, some spice and a lot of alchol. I wasn't ready for the taste. maybe I wasn't expecting what I got, but it caught me off gaurd. I keep readung other reviews and the term 'earthy"" keeps coming up. I really can't do better than that, it kinda sums it up. I understand it was a wheat wine, but there was not much wine-y about it. Wheat and more wheat. There also was a serious ammount of alcohol and it wasn't masked as well as it should be to fully enjoy the beer. I appreciate what Smuttynose is trying ot do with the big beer series, and this might be a better drink if it was cellared for a while, but right now, I'm not much of a fan."
"medium to full bodied with appropriately middle of the road carbonation. good drinkability, no trouble finishing this bomber. this is one beer that in my opinion could benefit from a little less of a hop presence, and that usually ain't the case with me. so that may say something about this beer. it's just the hops kill a little of the more subtle characteristics."
"This made me want to try more wheat wines."
"Overall: A pretty interesting beer and my first take on the style. I'd really much prefer to have this one in a 12 oz bottle rather than a bomber, as it got to be a bit trying by the end."
"Drink: Am looking forward to this beer next year. I've heard the brewers are keeping guarded eyes on the few remaining bottles."
"Drinkability: decent drinkability, even though this is high on the alcohol scale. Find this one and enjoy it."
"wish I had more to drink."
"This beer shows off everything it has in it's charecter. It is malty and smooth. It has enough hop presence to make a statement. But it done so in a very balanced way. The mouthfeel is vaugley oily, but, not so much that i ttakes away from the beer. despite the high ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. I am very sorry that I do not have more of thise"
"22 ounce bottle. Bottled in 2005 on front label."
"Orange amber body with a nice with a good size head that left a scattering of lace around the glass. Pretty fruity aroma with plenty of sweetness. Some grassy and earthy hops are noticeable as is a bit of alcohol. Some caramel as well. Taste starts off with some more fruits and a good amount of earthy hops. Some light tartness towards the end with a hoppy fruity finish. Interesting smelling and tasting brew. Mouthfeel was fairly thick and enough to support the flavor. Pretty smooth and easy drinking for such a big brew. Solid all around wheat wine from my experience."
"Hate to do it, because I love Smutty, but this beer is a trainwreck. Pours a decent looking amber red color, zero head, though that could be expected because of the high ABV. Smell is filled with oppressive alcohol, though under that, if you try hard, you can find some nice sweet malty notes and vanilla. Taste is much the same, lots of alcohol compared to the little flavor that manages to break through. Oily, uncarbonated mouthfeel, doesn't back up the attempted boldness of this beer. Almost undrinkable. If I had to describe this brew in a word, I'd say abrasive."
"Pours a one-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Hazy amber color. Slight malty nose. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Starts sweet but complex flavor, the high ABV is not really noticeable, slight hop finish. Good beer to savor. $3.29 for a 22oz bottle from RSVP Liquors, Portland, Me."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" manila tan head over the orangey amber brew. Head lasts well, esp for the style, with sticky, slow falling lace. Aroma is sweet, malty, fruity, and boozy. Taste is dominated by the alcohol in this young brew, probably best to let it age for awhile. But I didn't, so let's see what else we have. Light fruitiness and wheat character both wave from beneath the surface of alcohol, but hardly can make themselves noticed. Alcohol even numbs the mouth a bit. Mouthfeel is exceptional from the wheat input, sliding so nicely across the tongue, gives a valiant effort in tempering the alcohol, just comes up a tad short. Drinkability is good, because even though I'm not quite happy with this one right now, it has great potential for the future. A brew to look forward to, for sure."
"This is a drinkable brew. An excellent winter warmer."
"I was surprised by this one. I don't think it will be a fave or go to just style wise for me, but I have to say it is damn tasty and an interesting one to check out.. dig it !"
"This is a really good beer. When I get back to UJ's, I'm going to buy another. Every barleywine loving beer geek needs to try this!"
"Flavor is also fairly mild with toffee and berries up front roling to some red grape and a bit of wheaty twang. I do detect some lite alcohol on the finish as well. The finish is also very dry and vinous which encourages me to take another sip. This is a very tasty beer that is a definite sipper. Give it a shot if you see it!"
"Maybe this is the way wheat wines are, but it seems unbalanced. There's the soft mouthfeel, and faint aromas and flavors, but it leaves you with a bitter alcohlic finish that borders on unpleasant. I'll try some others, and give this one another go."
"Overall, this could be a really nice brew if the medicine flavour was, well, removed. Get rid of that and you've got a winner. As of now, this one is a tad above average at best."
"A really solid beer, and one that I will be buying quite a bit of during its season."
"Drinkable in the league of barleywines and wheat wines. Expect the bite, but also expect the buzz that follows. A true sipping beer that should be enjoyed for it's complexity. I first had this beer while camping a couple of weekends ago. I'm glad I bought a couple of these. This beer will only become more intense as it ages. Another great and original offering from Smuttynose."
"An interesting offering. No abv given, but as I drink it, I gather it is quite high! Nice copper appearance..minimal head...no doubt due to high abv. Smell is yeasty a tad fruity, with a definite alcohol presence.Taste is lightly sweet, malty, with a definite alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is relatively smooth considering its strength. Drinkable for the style."
"** WORD TO THE WISE ** do not try to drink this bomber by yourself. bad things will happen and your judgement and motor skills will be severely impaired. share this beast with a buddy."
"Drinkability is probably not off the charts. Definitely a sipping brew at this ABV, but a very good one to sip."
"This beer is very drinkable in moderation. More of a sipping beer, but very enjoyable as such."
"I had this beer on tap Wednesday at RedBones. It poured a dark amber, very hazy, almost no head. Clearly the high alcohol content kept the production of head to a minimum. I was struck by the lack of a defined aroma. I guess its my reflex to associate wheat wines wit barleywine, and the latter always have a complex, layered aroma. This really lacked that, it had notes of pear, bit nothing from the hops and little from the malt.. Taste is over the too alcohol. Lot of apple pear, orange fruit. Slick mouth feel medium drinkability."
"Had on tap at 'bones last Friday. 10.5 pour. Light clear amber, some cloudiness as well. Thin clingy cream colored head. Vanilla and some fruitness in the aroma. Mouthfeel was interesting...I thought it was a bit thick, some cheweyness. But it also is very smooth ride, with no clunkiness. Vanilla is a prominent feature tastewise. I did find the beer a bit sweet and cloying. Mixed emotions. I hate to use this but: aging might toughen this beer up (in a good way). Seems young."
"On tap at the Collins bar in little 'ole NYC. Pours orangy apricot, moderatly cloudy, minimal head, with light and elongated strips of lacing. Nose is sweet and phenolic, with notes of gin and anise, mmm yummmy stuff my eyes and nose are telling me. Buttery mouthfeel. Nice yeasty, wheat feel to this stuff. Packed with fruity flavors with some gin, and bourbon notes to make things interestingly complex.This is a fruity, alcoholic, strong, and tasty beer. More fine brew from smutty. Extra fine on tap, I'd love to try some of the bottled variety as well."
"Okay, here is the deal. This beer has a wonderful amber hued glow with a nose that blends subdued malts, slight hops and complex oak. The mouth-feel is alive without being overly active. The taste starts with a simple rounded sweetness of malt and alcohol, but not overly so - don't let the wine name fool you. These big bold flavors are controlled and even highlighted by the dryness of the oak. In fact, the only note I would give is that the oak might...slightly...dominate the flavor. Give this puppy some age and forget about it..."
"Cheers to Smutty for pushing the envelope with their Big Beers!"
"Batch #2 was also sampled recently from the brite tank,and is very good also,although slightly different. Feel free to beermail me if you are interested in batch #2."
