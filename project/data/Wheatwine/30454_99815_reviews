"I couldn't quite find anything wheaty about this brew but I still found it enjoyable."
"aroma of pine and citrus.  Tastes like malt with marmalade and bitter orange rind.  Not much alcohol is detected over the intense hoppy, bitter finish."

"Ah, finally having another wheatwine. It's been too long, kids... Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear amber topped by a half-finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises white bread, orange peel, mild booze, and a hint of cream. The taste ups the booze ante, along with the requisite burn; then there's a sense of off Cointreau being suffocated by wet white bread slathered in Country Crock. Then add a sprig of mint and astringent pine resin. Ooph. The body is a hefty medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, a slightly syrupy feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, this was just an unpleasant wheatwi--make that an unpleasant beer in general. No nuance, no real niceness, this seems rather rough for a wheatwine."

"Overall: This is a terrific beer with huge flavor though I don't care for the marketing shtick - focus on making good beer, not denigrating and stereotyping people"
"Mouthfeel is super thick. mild carbonation along with the rich body make this a big beer."

"Overall: One of the top offerings from Spiteful no doubt. Killed it with this many times overlooked style. A ton of complexity and wonderful flavors. Spiteful continues to assert itself as one of the top breweries in Illinois."
"DELICIOUS; GRAB A BOTTLE!!"
