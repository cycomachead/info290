3.65,-5.4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"odd beer but another tasty one from perennial. on tap at hops and pie, this has a pale golden color, perfectly clear, but not much head or visible carbonation. smells quite sweet, like honey and wheat malt, somehow still light despite its obvious gravity and alcohol strength. I smell some fruity esters too, maybe even berries or honeysuckle or something lush and springy. the flavor is on the sweet side, residual sugars abound, and its subtle malt flavor is less prominent than it probably should be, although I am admittedly not much of a wheat wine connoisseur. the alcohol doesn't come out until the end, and the flavor is actually rather pleasant, just very sweet. a good glass to share. smooth in the feel, gentle vibes, but lacking the carbonation that I need in a beer like this. it gets heavy as a result, and starts to get tough to drink. the booze comes out as it warms and it can really get you smashed if you don't look out. a good beer from perennial. maybe not quite up to the level of some others, but a unique and enjoyable cold weather brew.","StonedTrippin","Nov 13, 2013"

The mouthfeel is very surprisingly smooth considering the strength. There's an earthiness that blends with the carbonation and makes its presence known by prickling the tongue. I've had a handful of other wheat wines and they haven't been good experiences, but this is very intriguing and inviting. There's a bit of a dark malt and buttery cracker refreshing aftertaste.","Franziskaner","Nov 08, 2013"

The wheat helps make for a fuller body, not chewey but close, smooth drinking, the booze is noticeable as it has a slightly heavy boozy taste, not quite bourbon/woody, the dark fruits like plums, raisins, figs are in there, touches of bitter citric hops and spice.

The nose comprises wheat, wet grass, flowers, light perfume-y orange peel, and lightly-toasted biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some grapefruit peel. The alcohol isn't quite as present as I'd expected from other encounters with this brewery, which is a nice bit of surprise. The body is a lithe medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, a sorta/kinda fluid feel, and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a kinda limp wheatwine, one with little character and a subsequently bland flavor.","TMoney2591","Dec 27, 2012"

Delicious--more like a barleywine with a touch of wheat than the contrary, but I'm perfectly fine with that. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick on the palate, but comes off as easy to drink thanks to the fine carbonation.

I would def like a bit more of a hop presence, even for being over 6 mo old, it still would benefit greatly from a more dominant citrus punch. I cannot recommend seeking this out even for fans of the style as you can probably get a better example locally. Make no mistake this is a highly crafted ale, the ABV is non-existent even at close-to-room temps which is commendable, just lacks the necessary pop for a higher rating.","claspada","Jun 14, 2012"
