"I like the fact that Bore Tide brings some new aspects to the barrel aged wheatwine table. The spicier rye (versus the more popular bourbon) and fruitier Belgian yeast add some playful depth on top of the solid base of sweet, grainy wheat. I'm very happy itracy63 hooked me up with a couple bottles and looking forward to how much smoother this could be after 18 months or so of cellaring."

"Overall, uhh...I liked it but don't know enough about wheatwines. Are they supposed to be this sticky sweet? I dunno."
