3.3,-2.7,3.75,3,3.5,3,3.25,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, ruby-copper coloring with no head whatsoever. Aromas of tangy sweet caramel, honey, mango and other tropical fruits, a hint of roast, and booze characteristics. The nose is a bit muddled and cloying. Flavors of roast and rich sweetness, with a toffee backbone, and overlays of banana, booze, and mango. Very sweet, but balanced and smooth. Very robust and creamy body to support all the rich flavorings. The aftertaste is roasted, sweet, and a bit on the cloying side, with a sugary feel to it. The finish is smooth, with a cloyingly sweet linger.","GarthDanielson","Jun 23, 2013"
2.76,-18.6,2.75,3,2.75,2.25,2.75,"Date tasted: July 19, 2013 ... Glassware: Duvel oversized snifter... Occasion: having endured the hottest week in a Jersey decade, kicking back and hoping for refreshment with a complex hefe....Appearance: pours out a spectacle of rushing head formation; having settled, the beer becomes opaquely light brown, almost muddy, with a thin, pencil-thin off-white head; when held to the light, microscopic bubbles slowly hover upward ... Aroma: some pilsner fragrance collides with a malty stiffness that doesn't make for a happy wedding in the nostrils... Palate: powerful, furnace-like impact on the throat--the 9% ABV is overly exposed and makes the tasting a bit of a chore...Taste: mostly barley, as wheat and Saaz are relegated to a supporting role; a bit of iced tea to the flavor (?) with the tongue wondering where the "softening" qualities of the wheat/malt/hop combination indicative of the style are to be found... Overall: having bought this bomber with a gift card, I felt little danger in trying a beer made by "manly men," and still I had hope this beer would be a powerful 9% wheat beer that would wed well with the summer heat; instead, this self-proclaimed "sort of a cross trainer" really doesn't profile well enough to merit a second taste or a friendly recommendation...but I can say it does deliver the alcohol well enough to persuade my critical eye to overlook its stranger genre-bending qualities....","dacrza1","Jun 21, 2013"

3.58,5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Tasted at the big "SeaBass has got to go" tasting courtesy HonusWagner over on ratebeer. Thanks, I appreciate you hanging on to this so I could give it a try. Pours deep copper with gold edges and white head. The aroma is apples, a touch of peach, prunes and a sense of ripe cherries and a touch of heat at the end of the draw. The taste is malty and earthy as well as seaweed Atlantic Ocean like with some sweet rich dark fruity esters intermingling here and there. A few more sips reveals a modest amount of smoke and maybe a sense of peat. Whatever wheat notes there may be they are pretty faint and well hidden.","BigMcLargeHuge","0"
3.98,17.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Taste is sweet wheat upfront, a balance of clove and banana, a peek of fruit in the middle, and closes warmly with the wheat character again. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good, esp for the abv. Good rep of the style.","ppoitras","Jan 16, 2011"
3.66,8,4,3,4,4,3.5,"D: A seriously easy drinking wheat wine at first. The sweet boozy character and cough medicine like alcohol does catch up to you towards the finish of the bomber so ones aplenty.","beerthulhu","Nov 21, 2010"
4,18,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a one finger cream head that quickly fades leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color but with floaties. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is malty with some alcohol. Flavor is caramel with some sharpness from the wheat, alcohol is muted. $11.30 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","Nov 15, 2010"
4.17,23,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Nice presentation, caramel in color. Limited head but what do you expect at nine percent? Cloudy like hefe but other than that, i agree with the overall booziness sentiment -- this is a big barley wine. What folks may not say is that this is one of three in a series and the biggest abv of the lot. It doesn't taste like a nine, finishes smooth with an aftertaste of sour. I liked this when placed in context with the other manly man brews. It's certainly drinking well now but could be savored for a while.","anotherpg","Nov 02, 2010"
2.39,-29.5,4,2.5,2,3.5,2,"d - Not a very good wheatwine; I thought it was kind of a boozy mess. Would not want to try again.","mdfb79","Sep 21, 2010"

3.88,14.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a beautiful amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a rich pale and wheat malt scent along with a mild yeast fruitiness. It's dry with a touch of smokiness. The taste is much the same. It's smooth and full flavored with a rich hefe feel. It goes down with ease and finishes dry with some pale malt sweetness and a bit of warmth. The yeast character is there, but as a back drop only. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable wheat wine. I've had other samples of this beer where the yeast character was more pronounced. This one was more subtle.","WesWes","Jul 24, 2010"
2.6,-23.3,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,2,"Since I'm always pushing for more Maine brewers to try new things in the brewhouse, I want to commend Atlantic for trying something different with the Manly Men line. I'm excited to give the other two initial Manly Men beers a shot. Unfortunately, it looks like exploring "the outer reaches of the malt beverage universe" with the El Hefe pushed brewing a balanced brew into the backseat. An imperial hefeweizen is a fantastic idea, but this release tastes like it could use just a touch more tweaking.","umfskibum","Jul 22, 2010"
3.85,13.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"P.S. I think its miss labeled as a hefeweizen regardless of the gravity.","Snamnoum","Jun 23, 2010"
3.37,-0.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability is average. This beer is not really my thing, but it's not too bad and the flavor gets a bit smoother as it warms. The ABV is somewhat noticeable, but not overdone. This is an interesting combination of beers (Hefe and Barleywine), but it doesn't seem to work very well. I applaud Atlantic Brewing for their effort, but I'll probably pass on this the next time I see it.","sisuspeed","Beers"
3.95,16.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, a different, somewhat schizophrenic beer. I couldn't tell what the brewer was trying to do with this beer, but I enjoyed it.","lordofthewiens","0"
