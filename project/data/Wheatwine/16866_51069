Wonderful rich malt on the palate joined by caramel, fruit, banana, vanilla, coconut - the vanilla coconut banana thing is extreme and nicely done.  Very nice texture and body, medium to medium full with fine soft carbonation.","pat61","Mar 15, 2015"

Light on the palate yet very complex, lots of bourbon aroma without overwhelming other elements, smooth despite its strength. This was one of the first BBA beers I tried (~6 years ago) and I didn't like it very much. Age, as well as change in my own palate, have served this one well.","orangebison","Mar 12, 2015"

I have some difficulty ascribing the flavors; mild vanilla darkened a bit by light bourbon in the background, apples(?), mild sweetness yet a very mild tartness, a little caramel maybe?  This is a very, very good beer. A sipper to be enjoyed slowly with a good friend.","JebBeerFish","Feb 03, 2015"

I'm not sure how I'll get through this bottle though, a lot of complexity and depth but I find the sweetness and alcohol on the high side. Not to say it isnt a very tasty and inspired beer, which it is, a lot of interesting things going on, but I think they are lessened by the strength and sweetness of this. Nevertheless, age has been good to this and it showed a good performance all around, a good balance struck between the two ales.","mick303","Jan 14, 2015"

Aroma of oak and pale wheat when combined almost give off a dry cider like note. The flavor is an intense blend of oak and pale wheat,which, like the aroma,almost give a dry cider like flavor. There's a residual sweetness that lingers that I find a bit cloying. I believe the bourbon notes and the oak are clashing with the pale wheat.

4.65,20.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Quite a gorgeous beer. Incredibly complex with lots of prickly carbonation despite the strength. Tart ripe apples and stone fruit covered in a light caramel glaze. Soft notes of oak and vanilla with just the right touch of bourbon. A delicate beer like this would be so easily overpowered but sweet bourbony notes come through just a bit on the back end and compliment some of the more savory and richer notes while letting some of the brighter fruit notes still shine. Complex, surprisingly lighter in body than expected. The wheat really creates an incredibly drinkable beer out of such a big one. Alcohol heat is noticeable on the back.end but provides balance to the intense flavors and drys out the finish. Finishes lingers long and is almost tannic in that it scrubs the gums. Very nice, and well worth the bottle cost.","jtierney89","Apr 18, 2014"

Great clean apples supported by warm caramel malt tease the olfactory senses with a refreshing, crisp brew to come, but it turned into a heavily oak-dominated and deceivingly biting flavor.

The oak helps keeps things balanced and smooth, as there is something akin to yeast that keeps the beer fluffy and lively and then some sour/tart citric flavors and then a finish of vanilla sweetness. The ABV is rather well hidden as the booziness and medicinal/barrel taste that some barrel aged beers have is vaguely there on backend as beer warms. A beer that is out there as it touches on but doesn't excel at one particular taste sensation but I really enjoyed it.","clayrock81","Dec 26, 2013"

Looked pretty nice. Aroma of toasted wheat and sweet malts, candi sugar, notes of stone fruit and coconut. This was pretty indicative of the taste, wheat and pale malts, fruity, peachy flavors, on the sweeter side, with a pretty big hit of fusel alcohol, no real bourbon or barrel notes, but a definite coconut sensation came through. Body was medium, mouthfeel was pretty thin, quite unexpectedly, but I guess it would have been less drinkable if it were a chewy full-blown malt bomb. Alcohol was present for sure, but actually it wasn't too hot. Not bad overall, but not great. I was glad to have it on tap instead of committing to a bomber.","Rifugium","Dec 25, 2013"

On paper, an 11.5% ABV wheatwine with half of it aged in bourbon barrels sounds like a defeating task to drink. Boozy with the sweetness from all of the malt needed to establish its alcohol content only added on to by the bourbon barrels. But that isn't the case. The high level of carbonation and Belgian forward characteristics help to make this not only enjoyable but drinkable as well. They did a fantastic job at making a potentially intense, very pronounced, boozy mother of a beer into one that is well rounded, soft, and delicate and I commend them for that.

Taste has a touch of tartness, some citrus and carmel. A little boozy but not overpowering, with just a hint of the barrel. Medium mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation and a little dry.

The bourbon is applied with subtlety, giving airs of wood and whiskey to the mix; lots of fruits for fans: tropical and orchard; citrus comes through, assisted by the hops (?), and the wheat provides some characteristic flavors and smells; this came across like a wheat tripel, bourbon barrel aged. Can't imagine not enjoying this.","Greywulfken","Sep 16, 2013"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 3/8/2013. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, banana, apricot, pear, pepper, clove, toffee, coconut, oak, bourbon, wheat, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big pineapple, apricot, pear, banana, clove, pepper, toffee, oak, bourbon, wheat, vanilla, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, light fruit, banana, clove, pepper, toffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla, wheat, candi sugar, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and barrel flavors; with a nice moderate barrel presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Moderate alcohol warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice blended wheat wine style. All around nice balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV despite the moderate warming on the finish. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

It opens the palate and intensifies the flavors, where I found that a bit of degassing tends to smooth the beer and adds to the drinkability. After trying two of these barrel-aged (in this case, partially barrel-aged) wheatwines, I must confess I'm not entirely sold on the concept of a barrel-aged wheatwine. I'm not sure that the grainy, cereal-like qualities of the style are well complemented by the bourbon notes it inherits. I find the transition on the palate from soft wheat to harsh booze to be offputting at first, but who knows. It might be a taste I could acquire.","deadonhisfeet","Jun 15, 2013"

Bourbon notes come through and offer up some vanilla and oak. Taste is fruity and citrusy up front with more depth and complexity as it sits on the palate. Bourbon takes ahold by mid palate and some dry oaky notes on the finish. Alcohol Is relatively low key as it is overshadowed by orange and citrus. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. Overall, the citrus and wheat really take center stage here and overshadow the bourbon. Lots of bright fruit notes, almost forgot this was wheatwine.","homebrew311","Jun 05, 2013"

This case-in-point pours a lightly hazy orange-gold topped by a finger if lightly cream-white foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, vanilla, buttercream, light bourbon, oak, orange glaze, and banana. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the barrel is coming through a bit more powerfully, the caramel and vanilla have melded into a beautiful embrace of sweetness, the orange is joined by light pineapple and even lighter papaya, and some molasses sneaks in for good measure. A light booziness provides a bit of alcoholic heat, enough to allow you to feel it, but not enough to detract from the surrounding tastiness. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a damn fine wheatwine, the best I've had from the style in an awfully long time.","TMoney2591","Oct 20, 2012"

Finishes crisp, clean, and dry with a very mild hint of oaky bourbon and medicinal alcohol. Medium bodied with fairly effervescent carbonation.

Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like caramel, oak, vanilla, bourbon, citrus peel, peppery spice, and a bit of pear. The bourbon is more noticeable as the beer warms up more. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky and coating, and is well carbonated. For an 11.5% ABV beer, I thought the alcohol was well hidden.

4.09,5.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Barely energetic pour fills half the glass with wispy off-white foam, luckily it is so airy and whipped up that it dissipates quickly to a thin if consistent surface coating, as might be expected not much stick in the lacing, what might be there. Super-cloudy orange which lightens at the outer edges, even given its opacity you can see a maelstrom of bubbles whipping around inside the glass, has a relaxed feel about it. The nose displays an initial burst of wheat and then lemongrass, follows up with honey, vanilla bean, caramel, grape skins and some coal and earth, gives up a bushel of peach, apricot, pear fruit scents with a little mixed sweet citrus on top, overall most notable for its restraint even as it openly offers the benefits of the barrel aging. Full-bodied, sweet yet with a sour side as well. Here banana and bubblegum comes through along with wheatgerm, mild sous bois and then that honey and lees. The orange peel is clearer, hint of a poached fruit character to the peach, apricot, pear, pineapple and apple fruit. It is damn foamy, the increasing dryness through the finish helps temper this. Interesting for how you sense its complexity but can’t quite tease them apart. The oak influence is moderate and not dominant. Creaminess helps it hug the palate and last longer.","farrago","Jul 20, 2012"

3.6,-7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"White Oak pours a hazy, slightly dull tangerine. More than three fingers of white foam coalesce atop the beer, and the head displays very good retention. Lacing is fairly spotty though. There's a lot going on in the nose, though nothing's there that i would call a focus, or centerpiece. Notes of coconut, bourbon, oak, fruity booziness, and vanilla all blend together, without anything establishing itself as the primary aroma. The flavor is just a little bit more boozy, with the alcohol soaked fruit and bourbon notes taking over somewhat, and any coconut from the nose being lost. The body is surprisingly light for more than an 11% beer, and it's paired with an overactive carbonation that leaves the beer coming across as way too effervescent for what should be a malt driven beer. White Oak is an alright tasting beer that doesn't rank as one of the Bruery's best offerings.","axeman9182","0"

Sweet vanilla and bourbon...wow...just phenomenal flavors here. Finishes with a bit more citrus...somewhat bitter. A bit of alcohol as well. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Smooth and creamy.

Started off with predominant light fruitiness, bordering sourness, then as it warms you get a nice oak and light Bourbon presence. The 50% barrel aging was perfect for this because there aren't many (or any) that can hold up to the complete Bourbon Barrel treatment. Not sure what this was like fresh, but it is perfect right now. Kinda wished I saved this for slightly warmer weather but I was too anxious to try it. Definitely the best Wheat Wines I have ever had hands down. I heard there's a new batch coming out this year (2012) so definitely seek it out then as it is probably quite hard to come by now.","claspada","Feb 05, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, subtle sweet alcohol, mango, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, fruit, and mango. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one was a little out of place with the other 44 brews that were cracked open as they were ALL sours (except for one or two others). This was a nice palate refresher and definitely was quite well received with the group. The fruit aspect going on here was quite nice and seemed to work well with the woody character I picked up on.

1.91,-50.6,4,3,1.5,1.5,1,"Medium bodied with very tight carbonation up front that is immediately countered by a blast of bourbon and burnt wood that overpower almost everything and lingers throughout into a very hot, burning finish. The barrel character is way too strong in this beer creating an overly hot, boozy, astringent mess. Lots of earthy oak and hot bourbon flavor with a decent bit of vanilla flavor that surprisingly doesn't mellow things out much at all. Underneath all of the heat there is a slightly creamy presence with hints of crisp light fruit and zesty, peppery spice. This beer is not very well balanced and is kind of an abrasive assault on the palate. It doesn't taste very good and is tough to choke down.

4.2,8.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A capped 750ml bottle. Much thanks to mymrnngjckt for sharing this treat at a recent tasting. The bottle was uncapped and poured into my snifter. The ale appears a hazy golden amber color with a good inch or so of fluffy white head. The head produces a slight lace with each sip. The flavors and aromas consist of oak, vanilla, nutty, sweet caramelized grains, toasted coconut, wheat bread, fruity yeast. Medium to full bodied for a BSPA and adequately carbonated as well. Thanks again for sharing this one Kevin - tasty stuff.","ClockworkOrange","Jan 21, 2010"
3.98,2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"75cl bottle thanks to sandstone. Hazy orange with a big white head. The aroma is like a lemon meringue pie with a ton of vanilla. Very crusty with a buttery, flaky crust. The flavor has the same lemon-vanilla pie quality with some oak and caramel sweetness. Low on the hops with the sweetness carrying through the finish. Full bodied with smooth carbonation. Almost a little too sweet, but very unique and complex flavors.","bulletrain76","Jan 14, 2010"

3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,3,"Bottle courtesy Sandstone. Pours a cloudy dark orange color with a fading tan head. Aroma is scotch-like, both in character and in alcohol. Strong estery notes with pear and stone fruit, some vanilla/honey. Flavor is delicious but very sweet; honey, candied citrus, vanilla, maybe a touch of tropical fruit. Not to mention bourbon. Rich but still hot, could use some time to mellow out.","illidurit","Dec 23, 2009"
4.17,7.8,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste follows the aroma. The alcohol is definitely apparent, but not necessarily intrusive. At first, I thought it was over carbonated (despite the appearance), but as time went on I realized how much the carbonation of this beer helps lift some of the 'heaviness' of the barrel character and alcohol. A very robust beer with a lot going on, but a 7oz serving or so was plenty satisfying. Looking forward to seeing how this one ages.","Ineedabeerhere","Dec 21, 2009"

4.1,5.9,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Thanks very much to stevemcqueenjr for carrying this one cross-country. Poured a hazy burnt orange with a half inch frothy, bright white head that settles into a quarter inch skim. Some strands of lacing are revealed, but weak legs. Nose expresses, white grapes, cotton candy, toasted oak, vanilla and ethanol. Taste reveals coconut, citrus, whiskey, vanilla and buttery notes. Mouthfeel is medium-light, a little too high in terms of carbonation, but eases up as it dissipates. Amazing complexity to this beer with a fairly well-hidden abv. I'd love to see what some time in the cellar would do to this beer over time.","Jwale73","Nov 21, 2009"
3.73,-3.6,4.5,4,4,3,3,"I think this beer is too carbonated. The drinkability isn't terrible, but I can already tell you it's going to be a long night's work polishing off this 750ml bottle myself. Halvsies would have been perfect!","rudylaw","Nov 19, 2009"
4.7,21.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Brought to the table in a tulip, I nice golden color and white fluffy head. The smell is wonderful! It has a nice bourbon and caramel sweetness, with little hints vanilla and clove and a little bit if alcohol in the finish. The taste is very similar to the smell, lots of bourbon, caramel, vanilla and wheaty sweetness. It goes down super smooth and finishes very clean and dry. The bourbon plays very nice with beer. The bourbon and caramel in this beer are awesome. An absolute pleasure to drink. It coats my month very nice, medium bodied and just wonderful. The drinkability is pretty good. Overall, this is a wonderful beer! To bad this came out underneath the huge hype shadow that was Black Tuesday. But that leaves more for me!","walows","Nov 17, 2009"
3.89,0.5,3.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Delicious really, but definitely one for contemplation, if not dessert. If you are a fan of bourbon or single malt, you will probably enjoy this - if not, then stay far far away. If I weren't rating for style, I might increase my score...","augustgarage","Nov 15, 2009"
1.94,-49.9,3,4,1,2,1,"D: Lots of strong tastes here. But it's very heavy on the palate, and the finish is challenging. I'm not sure barrel-aging was a good idea for this one. Also, I really should have split this with people. I was unable to finish the bottle and poured out about 40% of it. Gah. I hate throwing away expensive beer.","Arbitrator","Nov 12, 2009"
4.38,13.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a big beer with tons of flavors and a seriously sweet character overall. Despite that and the high ABV, it remains exceptionally drinkable. Really well done.","gford217","Nov 09, 2009"
3.5,-9.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste opens with apricot and melon-like sweetness, honey, pepper and clove. Carbonation is very high, reminiscent of beers like Duvel. Again, I don't pick up much bourbon barrel character. The finish is semi-dry, woody, peppery. This is pretty good, but I don't think it's the most harmonious blend. A barrel-aged wheatwine sounds great on its own, but it seems like it lost some complexity and body in the blend. Taken as a Belgian golden ale, this beer is too sweet and heavy. These beers were probably best left separate.","largadeer","Nov 09, 2009"
3.43,-11.4,4.5,4,3,4,3,"Drinkability is a bit shaky....just too high of an ABV and too much booziness to really make me want more than 8-12 oz. at a time. The 750 ml bottle really should be split 3 ways. Bottom line is this beer has some potential for improvement through maturity, but is a bit rough at this point.","alcstradamus","Nov 02, 2009"

4.37,12.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is quite good too. Fairly thick-bodied, verging on syrupy; but it is well balanced by ample carbonation. Sweet, syrupy body and high ABV limit drinkability, but overall I think this is a great brew. I was told this will be bottled in a couple months. I sure hope it is, and that the bottles find their way to Denver.","waltonc","Aug 31, 2009"

4.27,10.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Tulip glass at the brewery on Saturday after the Angels and Yankees game, this beer is actually a wheatwine, excited to try another component of the Melange #3, color is a golden yellow with some orange tint, one inch fluffy white head, some retention, minimal lacing, good looking for a barrel aged brew, aroma consists of oak, milk, vine, bourbon, lots of vanilla, tannins, overly ripe berries, and some doughy wheat, taste starts off a little warming with the booze hitting you up front, ripened fruits in the middle mixed with a little toffee, not chewy at all and mostly sweet, finish is also warming with lots of vanilla, some caramel that is on the sweeter side lingers in the aftertaste, warms up nicely, would have been much better on a cooler day probably, sticky, sweet, warm, and fruity mouthfeel, medium bodied, decent carbonation, taste lingers a long time, could drink another glass but this stuff is strong and you can pretty much taste it, at least it is not heavy or too sweet, which saves its drinkability, will drink again, recommended","Floydster","Jul 11, 2009"
