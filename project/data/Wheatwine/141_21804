Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, wheat, caramel, toffee, wood, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour wheat, caramel, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop and wood bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a unique tartness in the flavor that I am not sure I have experienced in other beers of the same style.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 02, 2014"

Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a bright, rose-amber coloring with a thin, frothy, off-white head that disappears rather quickly after the pour. Aromas of toasted grains, booze, tangy sweet caramel and toffee. Smells sweet and rich. Flavors are very rich and a bit boozey. Caramel rich and roasted backbone, which is overpowered by the sweetness of the palate. Some subtle spicing at the end of the palate helps clean everything up a bit. Peppery and slightly bitter hops profile. Smooth, robust feel in mouth. The aftertaste is a rich, sweet blend of booze and toffee, leading to a rich, slick, lingering finish. Heavy brew, with a robust talent. Tasty, but big.","GarthDanielson","Jun 14, 2013"

I’m not really sure what a wheatwine is supposed to be, but I can certainly smell the wheat in the aroma and can feel the creaminess in the mouthfeel. Other than that, it has a lot of similarities to a barleywine. Granted, it’s not on the same level as a lot of barleywines, but then again, it’s not a barleywine. I think it’s a nice, drinkable beer especially for the ABV. If I can find them, I’d like to try more wheatwines.","BlackBelt5112203","Jan 23, 2013"

Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming on the finish noticed.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall (4.0): I’m a fan. Smuttynose Wheat Wine was the first I ever had of the style, a few years ago when I was still pretty fresh in the craft beer world. I really want to try this fresh, and also with 2-3 years on it, to compare to where it’s at right now—frankly I didn’t even realize this was aged about 10 months because I kept waiting for a good reason to open it. Either way, I like it the way it is now, and while it’s not for everyone (as I think is common to the style in general), this is my idea of a non-IS sipper. Warm, fruity, rich, and boozy.","fmccormi","Oct 25, 2011"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Draft to snifter. Looks good; however, this is my first review of a wheat wine, so this portion of the review is somewhat arbitrary. Smell is good. Very similar to a barleywine. The taste is where it differentiates itself from a BW. Not better, not worse; just different, and refreshingly so. Much more candied up front. And throughout, for that matter. I like it. The mouthfeel is good too, especially for a big beer. I couldn't do too many of them because of how candied they are, but it's a nice alternative to a big beer.","b3shine","Oct 21, 2011"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"2009 vintage. Pours from the 22oz. bomber a dark amber color with a small off-white head that quickly vanishes. Lots of fizz in the head, but little evidence of any carbonation inside the glass. Thee aroma is quite similar to apple juice, in fact it's almost identical. 1st sip brings a semi-sweet taste of fruit (apples, raisins, plums, bananas) with a soft hint of alcohol. The alcohol is somewhat understated, perhaps due to 2 years of aging. Mouthfeel is kind of on the thick, syrupy side, but not in a bad way IMHO. Halfway through the first pouring and I can already start to feel the 11% alcohol starting to sneak up on me! The muting of the alcohol from aging makes the drinkability high. Overall, this is quite a tasty, satisfying beverage. I'll have to pick up a replacement now, but I don't know if I can wait 2 years to sample it!","CJfromPhilly","Oct 16, 2011"

It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this one wasn't that bad. Usually I don't enjoy Wheatwines so that is saying A LOT. The taste on this one was definitely a lot better than the smell for sure. The taste of it was nicely balanced with the alcohol by some of the sweetness from the caramel and molasses notes.

Two fingers of beige head form, and while retention and lacing aren't great, given the alcohol I can't hold that against Smuttynose Wheat Wine too much. The nose gives me a little cause for concern, as while there's a certain spiciness to it the predominant aroma is of alcohol. The taste is a little bit better, as some sweetness from the wheat shows up to help the spiciness, but alcohol is still a bit too prevalent on my palate for this beer to make a great impression. It's a shame too, as a beer with this great a mouthfeel deserves to be supporting top notch flavors. The body is as rich as it could possibly be without becoming cloying and thick, and the carbonation is very nicely understated. The great mouthfeel helps make this beer drinkable, but with so much boozy flavors flying around it can't be anything more than a sipper. Smuttynose Wheat Wine isn't a bad beer, but the only reason I'd really be interested in revisiting it is to see it with a few years of age (and less alcohol heat) on it.","axeman9182","Aug 22, 2010"

Poured a semi-translucent plum with a quarter inch, loose, tan-colored head that quickly dispersed into a band of bubbles and a slick of foam. Some large globules of lacing appear on the tilt side of the glass. Nose reveals caramel, toffee, dark fruit, toasted malt and booze. Taste is not as sweet as the nose suggests, there also some bittering hops in the flavor profile and an alcohol quality that borders on caustic and presents itself throughout from start to finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a prickly carbonation level, a slight viscosity to the consistency and some residual alcohol heat that lingers at the finish.

Head retention is decent, not much lacing. Aroma is brown sugar, caramel malt, sweet booze (maybe brandy or sherry), and some dark fruit (figs, cherries). The beer tastes like brown sugar, earthy hops, dark fruit, caramel malt, booze and some butterscotch. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and a bit syrupy and coating with low carbonation.

That and I was still young in my general all around beer nerdery and knowledge. Since these have been back on the shelves as of late I figured I give it one more shot. This time, while still having a strong alcohol presence, I was really able to notice the other flavors shinning through. The nose is big with candied sugar, tropical fruits, and sweet malt. The taste was similar with the malt backing nicely. Its very easy drinking and as it warm towards room temp, the flavors really start to develop. Starts taking on a butter scotch characteristic.

Medium-bodied, most of the weight front loaded into the mouth entry so the carbonation prickle hardly noticeable until the end. That noted, a minerally fizz relieves some of the sweetness from the caramel, toffee, butterscotch components, creates space for pink grapefruit and pine too.

I was expecting some more wheat characteristics, but really wasn't getting any. Taste is... different. There's a sugary sweetness, almost akin to Smarties candy, brown sugar, a decent wheat twang, a bit of caramel, some apple-like fruitiness and a small amount of bitterness in the background an earthy, herbal like quality that i can't quite place my finger on, and a certain booziness that really comes out as it warms. Warming in the glass really brings out the flavors of this brew and it gets better and better as I sip it slowly. This is definitely an interesting brew, quite unlike anything I've tasted before.

3.87,0.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Out of a bomber this brew was a slightly hazy brown/garnet color with some ruby highlights. The one-finger head was khaki-colored, retained as a thin collar and left decent lacing. The aroma was sweet, caramel malt, sweet malt, wheat, alcohol and some butter. The flavors were also punchy and sweet, starting with lots of toffee and caramel it then went into lots of alcohol, notes of nuts and dry wheat with a lightly bitter finish at the end. As it warmed up I tasted more of the musty/cellared malt in the middle but it remained rich and potent throughout. The mouthfeel was average to smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation on the low side. The alcohol definitely caught up with me as I drank it, not a beer for the faint of heart... but it probably will age very well.","thekevlarkid","Feb 20, 2009"

It tasted complex too, like fresh caramel and raisin and sour cherry, with fig and subdued copper hops, as well as cultured yeast and alcohol. It was thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting sour and sweet aftertaste. I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer, but it was delicious. It seemed like it was already aged, but I'm not sure. Overall it was very well balanced and blended a million different flavors amazingly well. It had great body, and the noticeable alcohol seemed fitting for how big this beer is.

Smell is heavy with caramel, almost syrupy sweet smells, faint citrus hop aroma. Smell is big and dangerous. I believe one previous review referred to caramel apples when describing the taste, and I couldn't agree more. Big juicy apple-flesh flavors, warming alcohol, and some bitter grapefruit on the back of the tongue.

The aroma is packed with a heavy, thick malt smell of caramel and other sugariness, plus some spices. A little bit of alcohol sips in, creating a warming sensation. Even though this is a mix, it really comes across as a barleywine. The sugariness and syrupiness comes through in a thick, almost full-body and is matched with a pronouced sourness. A heavy, almost alcohol burning taste on the tongue; just a tad smoothness. This is a good beer but much more barleywine that wheat (not an even mix). Still contains a dry, hot backbite that resembles a cinnamon burn - and retains drinkability. There's still a good amount of sweetnessl this beer is complete with nut, almond, roasted and other malts that give it that sweet edge. I'd have this again, but I'm not going to seek this out. Just a little too potent and a little too sugary for a sessioning.","clayrock81","Oct 25, 2008"

The sweetness is immediately kept in check by a hearty dose of spicy, floral hops and a liquor-esque boozy warmth. Finishes with a complex blend of spice, alcohol, nuttiness, and some veggies. The body is a bit too viscous and heavy on the tongue, and the alcohol makes things sticky at times, but the mouthfeel significantly improves as the beer warms. A low carbonation level allows it to meld into a creamy, velvety malt bomb. Overall, this was a great beer and one helluva tasty sipper.

It tastes very clean other than the alcohol without a lot of roastyness or sweetness that really draws your attention. There's a moderate hop aftertaste but nothing overwhelming or similar to other barleywines I've had. I guess what differentiates this as a wheat wine is the smooth mouthfeel which is pretty nice, I just wish there was a little more flavor behidn it to back it up.

Those rich tasty notes are followed by prunes, dried cherries, figs, pears and raisins. The wheated malt note isn't all that noticeable or less than I was expecting anyway.

Slight cloudiness, very mild carbonation, amber/red in color. The smell is great. I smell apple peels, bread, candied fruits. Fruity esters, and sticky caramel. It has a great bite to it. There are also nutty undertones. The alcohol is a bit astringent as it stings my chapped up lips a bit. Very warming. The bitterness comes directly after the sweet bready initial malt flavor and it draws out for the rest of the sip until only residual sticky sugars and metallic hop oils are left. The hops are a bit much for me and I would like to age this on a couple of years to dive more into the complex malt side of things. The mouthfeel is hurt a little because of this.

3.53,-8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is an interesting, somewhat odd beer. My first wheatwine so I didn't know what to expect. The lack of lacing didn't detract for me because of the surprisingly good head retention. The taste was odd- it really is a mix of the three points they say on the bottle- barleywine sweet character, tart wheat, and bitter hops. They are all pretty well defined but at the same time I'm unsure if I'm happy with the balance- the tart wheat and bittering hops especially are in full effect. Given the chance, i'd revisit this beer again, and this style as well.","ABCJiugui","Feb 25, 2008"
3.9,1.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours an amber/red color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale, wheat, and crystal malt scent that shows it's elevated abv., but also lends itself to a lighter body and malt aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a warm, malty flavor that goes down slow and steady and finishes bitter with a powerful alcohol bomb. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed beer with loads of complexity, but it's definately a sipper beer. This one will take a while to drink.","WesWes","Feb 11, 2008"
3.8,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4," Pours a very cloudy orange, golden light hued color with just a quarter inch of head that quickly forms a light trace. Aromas burst forth with bright, toasted malt, lots of esters, a slight cheesiness, candy sweetness and a big load of alcohol. So far it's a slight improvement. On the palate, the barleywine similarities are obvious. A heavy slickness with medium carbonation, candy sweet malts with a distinct wheat note, a bit of toffee and a stinging alcohol finish. I wish there was more hop complexity in this beer because beyond maybe Northern Brewer, there's virtually nothing coming from the hops. They claim there's a heavy dose, but besides a vague bitterness and slight herbaceous note, there's nothing. Overall, I'm still new to the style, but this one is a good offering.","dreadnatty08","Feb 11, 2008"

This is really like a barleywine other than the strong spice on the finish. some hop bitterness verrrryyy distant in the aftertaste. kind of slight (very) apple taste on the finish. Suprised at how distant the hops are on the end of this. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but quite good. Drinkability gets exceptional marks, as the abv is well hidden and it goes down very smooth.

I get common characteristics out of it - I see how it's got a very similar mouthfeel and the flavor is close. The hops are probably pretty darned similar too - except in terms of bitterness (where this is much less bitter than their barleywine). I guess... I'd say that this was for the beer drinker who likes big body and nice hop flavor without the bitterness. In that context, is it fair of me to call it just above average? Maybe? It's my first wheat wine - I'm not entirely sure what to expect of the style! I guess... I'd think it better with more flavor or bitterness and perhaps even a bit less residual sweetness (unless there's a lot more bitterness to balance that out). Decent, but I won't go out of my way to get another bottle.","charlesw","Nov 12, 2007"

No real head to speak of, but the beautiful coppery color makes up for it. You can really smell the wheat, and it puts Sam Adams to shame. (Itself a good wheat) You can smell the alcohol too, but that's expected for a barley wine. It could use a tad more hops and my ""low"" score for drinkability is only due to its unchugability.

The taste is sweet and strong, with an immediate warming sensation. This is a sipping beer for sure. The wheat is present through the entire taste, which retains a lot of fruit and a little malt character. Theres not much in the way of hops in this beer, and it could use a bit more balance.

The nose is intense  a base of heavy caramel malts, with some tangy fruits and alcohol to brighten things up. At first, this tastes a lot like a barleywine, but then these sweet grains emerge to mask the alcohol, and the finish is a nice blend of tangy and bitter, which makes this go down super easily for something with this high ABV. Despite the big full body, carbonation and a tangy bitter finish keep this remarkably light in the mouth. Dangerously drinkable, as they say.","jbsteiny","May 11, 2007"

There was a slightly sweet/fruity malt taste, and a little bit of hop bitterness, with a reasonably smooth finish that didn't taste very alcohol-y (maybe the wheat?).

A crisp alcohol and slightly dry bite in the finish, are preceded by a medium bodied somewhat chewy maltiness. Interesting beer, although I don't get much wheat beer characteristics in it, maybe just a hint of wheatiness behind the malts and also contributing to the body. It definitely seems like an ipa/dipa-barleywine hybrid.

Others may taste the beer as it is... hot and boozy.... but I taste potential. I think this one will age very well. There is enough of a hop presence, and enough alcohol, to let this age for quite a while. I think I'll buy a few more bottles and let them sit for a couple years. It really is a great beer, and will only improve with age. I'd hope to see some of the wheat characteristics come through with age, once the hops and alcohol subside a bit. But highly recommended in any case. Smuttynose rarely disappoints. And at only $3.69 a bomber, this is one of the best bang for you buck beers out there.

Bright tasting for a barley wine and un-like any I have ever tasted. No one element of the flavor stands out as this is a balance of all the supporting characters. One weak link would bring the whole beer down. This is a beer that I'm not sure I would have liked in my youth(10-15yrs ago), but is just the type of challenging beer I now seek.

Ripe tropical fruit became fairly strong as it warmed. Moderate bitterness with a malty start, a bit crackery, fruity (a bit of citrus, very mild ripe berries). Caramel at the mid. Towards the end, alcohol really moved to the front and lingered through the finish. Lighter bodied than I expected, quite dry, with low carbonation that resulted in a flat mouthfeel. Not bad.

Esters run wild initially, yielding to some soft wheat notes with touches of orange peel throughout. Mildly spicy and a bit tart towards the finish, which leaves very little taste or flavor in the mouth; this surprised me, as I expected a long, lingering finish. Nonetheless!

It's got a very nice appearance with a hazy reddish-orange-copper body, but there's little head and even less lacing, which I thought was odd for a beer with 53% wheat (even if it does have a high alcohol content). Hops are noticeable in the nose, along with some very nice yeasty fruitiness and a flicker of alcohol, and it's quite welcoming. It's smooth across the palate with a very fine bubbled, restrained carbonation and medium body. In the flavor it's lightly sweet and somewhat candyish, but still well-balanced, and the malt and hop bitterness seem to have a tug of war going on until the finish where the bitterness overcomes. The alcohol is more apparent here than in the nose, and it rises up at mid-palate, and remains a bit in the finish. However, it does lend a bit of pepperiness that helps to balance the malt and give it greater depth of character. Overall, an interesting tipple.","NeroFiddled","Jan 24, 2006"

Taste is slightly vinous, with notes of dry white wine. Mild wheat wafer notes become toasty wheat as it warms. A bit phenolic and hot. Fruity notes are vague and understated.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Orange amber body with a nice with a good size head that left a scattering of lace around the glass. Pretty fruity aroma with plenty of sweetness. Some grassy and earthy hops are noticeable as is a bit of alcohol. Some caramel as well. Taste starts off with some more fruits and a good amount of earthy hops. Some light tartness towards the end with a hoppy fruity finish. Interesting smelling and tasting brew. Mouthfeel was fairly thick and enough to support the flavor. Pretty smooth and easy drinking for such a big brew. Solid all around wheat wine from my experience.","meathookjones","Nov 03, 2005"
1.93,-49.9,3.5,3,1.5,2,1,"Hate to do it, because I love Smutty, but this beer is a trainwreck. Pours a decent looking amber red color, zero head, though that could be expected because of the high ABV. Smell is filled with oppressive alcohol, though under that, if you try hard, you can find some nice sweet malty notes and vanilla. Taste is much the same, lots of alcohol compared to the little flavor that manages to break through. Oily, uncarbonated mouthfeel, doesn't back up the attempted boldness of this beer. Almost undrinkable. If I had to describe this brew in a word, I'd say abrasive.","twelvsies","Oct 31, 2005"
3.86,0.3,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Pours a one-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Hazy amber color. Slight malty nose. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Starts sweet but complex flavor, the high ABV is not really noticeable, slight hop finish. Good beer to savor. $3.29 for a 22oz bottle from RSVP Liquors, Portland, Me.","jdhilt","Oct 29, 2005"
3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" manila tan head over the orangey amber brew. Head lasts well, esp for the style, with sticky, slow falling lace. Aroma is sweet, malty, fruity, and boozy. Taste is dominated by the alcohol in this young brew, probably best to let it age for awhile. But I didn't, so let's see what else we have. Light fruitiness and wheat character both wave from beneath the surface of alcohol, but hardly can make themselves noticed. Alcohol even numbs the mouth a bit. Mouthfeel is exceptional from the wheat input, sliding so nicely across the tongue, gives a valiant effort in tempering the alcohol, just comes up a tad short. Drinkability is good, because even though I'm not quite happy with this one right now, it has great potential for the future. A brew to look forward to, for sure.","ppoitras","Oct 26, 2005"

4.27,10.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Flavor is also fairly mild with toffee and berries up front roling to some red grape and a bit of wheaty twang. I do detect some lite alcohol on the finish as well. The finish is also very dry and vinous which encourages me to take another sip. This is a very tasty beer that is a definite sipper. Give it a shot if you see it!","sulldaddy","Oct 14, 2005"
3,-22.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,2,"Maybe this is the way wheat wines are, but it seems unbalanced. There's the soft mouthfeel, and faint aromas and flavors, but it leaves you with a bitter alcohlic finish that borders on unpleasant.

I first had this beer while camping a couple of weekends ago. I'm glad I bought a couple of these. This beer will only become more intense as it ages.

3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I had this beer on tap Wednesday at RedBones. It poured a dark amber, very hazy, almost no head. Clearly the high alcohol content kept the production of head to a minimum. I was struck by the lack of a defined aroma. I guess its my reflex to associate wheat wines wit barleywine, and the latter always have a complex, layered aroma. This really lacked that, it had notes of pear, bit nothing from the hops and little from the malt.. Taste is over the too alcohol. Lot of apple pear, orange fruit. Slick mouth feel medium drinkability.","carln26","Sep 01, 2005"

Mouthfeel was interesting...I thought it was a bit thick, some cheweyness. But it also is very smooth ride, with no clunkiness. Vanilla is a prominent feature tastewise. I did find the beer a bit sweet and cloying. Mixed emotions. I hate to use this but: aging might toughen this beer up (in a good way). Seems young.","PatandDavid","Aug 30, 2005"
4.25,10.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at the Collins bar in little 'ole NYC. Pours orangy apricot, moderatly cloudy, minimal head, with light and elongated strips of lacing. Nose is sweet and phenolic, with notes of gin and anise, mmm yummmy stuff my eyes and nose are telling me. Buttery mouthfeel. Nice yeasty, wheat feel to this stuff. Packed with fruity flavors with some gin, and bourbon notes to make things interestingly complex.This is a fruity, alcoholic, strong, and tasty beer. More fine brew from smutty. Extra fine on tap, I'd love to try some of the bottled variety as well.","Billolick","May 11, 2005"
4.52,17.4,4.5,5,4,4.5,5,"Okay, here is the deal. This beer has a wonderful amber hued glow with a nose that blends subdued malts, slight hops and complex oak. The mouth-feel is alive without being overly active. The taste starts with a simple rounded sweetness of malt and alcohol, but not overly so - don't let the wine name fool you. These big bold flavors are controlled and even highlighted by the dryness of the oak. In fact, the only note I would give is that the oak might...slightly...dominate the flavor. Give this puppy some age and forget about it...","aaj1002","Apr 23, 2005"
