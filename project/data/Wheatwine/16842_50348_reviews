"Love this Brewery, their location, and their restaurant and wish them nothing but the best but....this beer is tough on the pallet...I would actually call it slightly harsh and definitely NOT for the faint of heart..... Lets cut to the chase....I have had several other high alcohol beers (7.50% ABV or Greater) that were less over-powering and harsh then Illegal Ale-Ien is. But if getting ""LIT"" is your #1 objective.....down a pint or two of this bad boy.... Simply put...One sip and you know you are in for the long hall. You WILL BE wearing the proverbial LAMP SHADE at some point in the evening."

"O: Labeled as a hybrid k√∂lsch, it definitely has the fruity aspect down. The curveball of the agave and both the flavor and sweetness that it brings is a nice change of pace and is the highlight of the beer. Drinks extremely easily for being 7.3%. Worth a shot"

"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a hazed, copper-orange coloring with a filmy, white, sparse head. Nose of toasted wheat and floral highlights. Flavors are roasted grains and honey balanced throughout. Very balanced. Smooth bodied and easy to drink despite the higher ABV. Subtle honey sweet aftertaste, with a grainy roast character to keep it in check. Smooth, light, clean finish. Very solid, strong brew."

"Poured a slightly hazed straw-yellow with a foamy finger of white head. Light, sweet malt aroma, with some citrusy hops noticeable. Toasted biscuit taste, very light, some floral hops, honey (or agave nectar, I suppose) and just a tad of citrus, with a clean malt finish. Looks are deceiving, for this light beer is pretty complex. Crisp and easily drinkable."
"Great bear and great company. Looking forward to trying other great beers from Marshall Wharf."
"This brew has morphed into about 8% according to the brewery. Pours a bright yellow with a white head. Almost a wheat cracker flavor upfront and then I could notice the blue agave flavor. Some minor notes of hops, but not overpowering. This beer is very easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Off the breweries tap this beer was a bright yellow color with a snow-white head. The one-finger of foam retained fairly well and left nice fishnets of lacing. The aroma was of wheat, floral hops, hints of malty sweetness and some dough. The flavors started dry with some hints of sweet malt in the middle and a mild tartness from the wheat. The blue agave nectar that was used to make the beer imparted a distinct agave/tequila note. It drank like a pilsner and not a 6.4% brew, dangerous! The mouthfeel was good, the body light and the carbonation light/medium. An interesting hybrid and highly creative."
"Taste is mildly hoppy and bitter but is evened out with the malt sweetness, strength is well hidden. The first taste was pretty much all creamy head, quite surprising for the style, after the head faded, the carbonation tasted a little flat but for the first half of the pint it was quite good."
"Served in my Uprising Chalice at Novare Res. This beer pours a golden straw color and has a thick white head of tiny bubbles. You can see plenty of additional carbonation bubbles rising in streams inside the glass. The aroma is of wheat and grass, which isn't too surprising, considering this is a hybrid kolsch/wheat beer. This is a full-bodied beer, it is kind of thick. There is some sweetness up front in the taste, as well as some hop bitterness. I found it to have pleasing amount of carbonation. According to the brewey's website, this beer is brewed with blue agave nectar, which may have been a taste I couldn't identify. They also say it is served on a nitro-tap, which explains the impressive looking head. Overall, a fine beer for a warm summer day, a very good one to enjoy outside in the sun."
