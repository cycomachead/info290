review_text
" The taste has a flavor of dark wheat -somewhat grain influenced with mild toasted accent and subtle sweetness from the wheat with a mild yeast spice and a light alcohol influence as it finishes with a subtle caramel  quality in the residual taste. Overall this is a very good wheatwine, not intensely hopped or full of alcohol, but a substantial and drinkable strong wheat ale for 8%"

"Flavor also had a hint of sweetness, and some suggestions of vanilla. Had a touch of some faint brown sugar and perhaps a smidge of honey. Had a lightly herbal hop finsih. Not bad... Prosit!!"
