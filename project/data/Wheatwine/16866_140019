I liked it more on tap than from the bottle, as the bottle had less of a tequila and salt flavor, but all in all was still a pretty accurate depiction of a margarita (though perhaps a cheaper one).","nathanmiller","Mar 16, 2015"

Props for pretty much nailing the essence of a tequila-forward margarita, although I'm not sure anyone wants a beer to taste like that.  It'll be interesting how this thing tastes with a few years in the cellar - no point in drinking any more right now, and I doubt anyone's gonna want to trade for this.","rand","Mar 11, 2015"
2.24,-23,4,2.5,2,2,2,"Lime, salt and tequila are all present, along with a fair share of booze. The citrus component comes off as almost plastic, strangely. While it sort of tastes like a margarita, the execution is lacking here - it's an overbearing mix of sweet, salty and citrus without any of the refreshing qualities of a good margarita. Perhaps a different base beer with significantly lower alcohol and sweetness would have worked better for this idea.","largadeer","Mar 09, 2015"

4.5,54.6,,,,,,"It's easy to hate this beer, but hear me out. If this was served to me blind, I would hate it. But trying to execute a ""margarita"" beer can't be easy (I assume), but for what it is, the Bruery nailed it. Appearance is a dark amber colored beer with little to no head. The smell is margarita mix melded with the boozy sweetness of a wheatwine style ale known as White Oak. The tequila, lime and salt are there, and evenly balanced in smell and taste. This beer is exactly how the label reads. Actually, maybe a little better because I thought this was a sour ale, but it's not. It's tart, but not sour by any means. But that works for what they are going for in my opinion. The mouthfeel is perfect as light carbonation represents a cocktail beer well. Overall, I am impressed with what they achieved here. I am disappointed it was a mystery beer as I honestly would not want more than one. I expected a different direction for the mystery beers, but that has nothing to do with my rating.","PlinyBeMiney","Nov 09, 2014"
