3.93,7.4,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"This is my first wheatwine, so I've rated it fairly similarly to a barleywine. Age has treated this well, with the flavors much less harsh and no signs of oxidation. It must have been reasonably hopped when freshed considering the amount of bitterness present, but no aroma/flavor carried through. Fairly well-balanced for such a big beer. I really wish I didn't forget about this one for so long and got to try it earlier (or even better, bought more!)","Phocion","Oct 14, 2014"

4.12,12.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A solid clear copper color with a fair off-white ring on top and reasonable signs of lacing. The aroma brings on a beautiful pine-malt blend with caramel popcorn sweetness. Very nice. The flavor delivers nutty evergreen and caramel malt with a general hemp-like overtone. Grainy and a hint of booziness that doesn't interfere at all. Carbonation is moderate, body is pretty close to full and the feel is pretty heavy and viscous, but "liquid". A very tasty brew and easily recommended!","Durge","Nov 09, 2012"

3.16,-13.7,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a clear bright light copper color with a moderately-thick off-white head. Doesn't last long, falling to a thin ring. Some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose is pretty sweet with some light cherry and a bit of caramel. Has a good amount of bitterness from the start in the flavor, as well as some light pit-type fruits and a bit of malty sweetness. Light amount of booze--not too much. Heavy bitterness starts to take over a bit. Really dry finish. Flavor doesn't have enough character and the body isn't big enough, but American Barleywine seems to be the closest fit.","Thorpe429","Apr 29, 2011"
3.63,-0.8,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Personally I could use a little more maltiness to balance out the hops and alcohol, but seeing as how wheat isn't nearly as chewy as barley, I suppose that means this is decent for the style.

2.53,-30.9,3.5,3,2,2,3,"I thought this might be a really interesting beer. I was wrong. It tasted more like a Miller Lite wanting to be a barleywine. I don't know, I guess I saw what they were aiming for, but they were quite far away. There isn't much to this beer except for a decent abv and a taste similar to some not so well prepared grainy soup served cold. I'm being a bit harsh, but I was let down especially for the money I threw away on it. Do yourself get a 4 pack of uintas barleywine for the same price as 22oz of this crap. Or do yourself a better one if you want something great get jw lees harvest ale. dont try this guy.","claytong","Jan 21, 2011"
3.49,-4.6,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Fort Collins Wheat Wine Ale is a fairly standard version of the style, circa 2010/2011 America. If you're a fan of high-octane, primarily pale-malted beer, take the plunge. Besides, $6.99 is unlikely to break the bank.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 25, 2010"
3.48,-4.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Bomber pours brilliantly clear copper with off white head. The aroma is light and fruity and just as much fusel like notes as anything else.

3.82,4.4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Color is clear reddish amber with noticeable carbonation. Fair head retention. Sweet aroma of apples and caramel. Very, very soft up front. Almost no carbonation evident. Alcohol in the middle, but not as hot as a barley wine. Very sweet, almost Scottish ale like. Smooth finish. Bitterness builds after the finish. Very rich body. Definitely a winter drink.","LittleDon","Nov 14, 2010"
3.63,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"It pours a clear ruby topped by a nice finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, light toffee, earthy hops, flowers, light fusels, coriander, and nutmeg. The taste is a strong dichotomy of peppery toffee and flowery orange peel. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a decently solid wheatwine, though it is lacking in complexity and the two flavor groups seem to clash a bit. Despite that, it keeps me wanting more and coming back for it.","TMoney2591","Oct 20, 2010"
3.91,6.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Aroma is fruity and a little yeasty/wheaty, not strong but still appealing. It pours a beautiful dark golden amber with a substantial, fluffy white head that leaves some decent lacing. Flavor - WOO HOO, has it got an alcohol bite to it! Other than that, it tastes more like an ale than a wheat beer, fruity, malty and a little bit yeasty. Texture is smooth as soy milk with a subtle but long-lasting tingle.","Cyberkedi","Oct 19, 2010"
3.32,-9.3,4,4.5,3,2,3,"Notes: Wow, you know - some beers can surprise you. This one smells great and like a thick chewy monster, but on the palate its really light and mostly a let down.
