"Terrible. No white chocolate, no vanilla, no cocoa, no bourbon. Sour and tart. A huge disappointment. I've had an infected cacaonut and this wasn't as god-awful but it wasn't good. Most expensive drain pour I've had yet. It took me a long time to land this and it was beyond an epic disappointment. Given the choice of bein forced to drink this or my own urine, I'd pick urine. Uhh"

"750 ml bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/amber color with a small foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring fairly quickly. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, golden raisin, pear, apple, toffee, bourbon, coconut, oak, honey, light caramel, light pepper, and bourbon/oak earthiness. Damn nice complexity and balance of pale malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa nib notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, golden raisin, pear, apple, toffee, bourbon, coconut, oak, honey, light caramel, light pepper, and bourbon/oak earthiness. Slight amount of oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, coconut, oak, honey, light caramel, and bourbon/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of pale malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa nib flavors; with an awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged wheatwine style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of pale malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa nib flavors; and smooth to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"It was tasty and savory, but a bit boozy strong for my liking. A little bit was enough for me."

"this really is one of the most interesting and delicious beers ever made. i have had the privilege of enjoying ti a few times not, but have not gotten to write about it here until now. its a very special brew, tasting quite a bit like white chocolate, and while there has been some discussion about soured and infected bottles or batches or whatever, that has not ever been my experience. the base beer is amazing, but its almost hard to imagine the wheaty strong ale without the bourbon barrel and the additives. the bourbon character is immense here, sweet vanilla and oak and booze in nose and taste. the addition of vanilla in the process really picks up on the component of the bourbon, and the vanilla factor is consequently through the roof. the cocoa is raw and more of a cacao butter type than a chocolate in the traditional sense, giving further credence the name white chocolate. while its obviously a very strong beer, the alcohol never really gets in the way of the unique flavors, which i would say about most of these bruery strong ales. this is one of the more decadent and delicious ive ever had, so much vanilla, so nice as it warms. its luxurious and regal and i am thankful to have shared it with good friends. for me this is the final evolution of the style, i cant imagine this being improved in any way."

"Thank god for the heavy bourbon, it really blended nicely."

"Overall: Great beer, but I actually prefer White Oak for it's drinkability.  The flavor is great in this one, but the heat makes it tough to put down."

"Pretty good, but for the price, probably should have been better still."

"I am sorry, but given the effort taken to get this bottle, I am not going to give a 4.75 score to an infected beer when I am expecting something else.  I appreciate the efforts of The Bruery to avoid contamination by splitting their sours off as Bruery Terreux.  Hopefully I can try a non-infected White Chocolate soon."

"Couldn't say this was an outstanding beer.  It did have a white chocolate taste in a strange sort of way. Bourbon and yeast on the nose. Very little carbonation. Something sweet on the pallet, not really cocoa but maybe toffee or something like that with a slight metallic edge that I didn't really enjoy. Overall a little odd...would like to try it on tap...might be a different story."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another high gravity offering. There is no mistaking the bourbon presence in both taste and aroma. Boozy and grainy with accents of chocolate and vanilla."

"Thanks for the infected beer Bruery. It made a great birthday beer."
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed with White Chocolate, maybe a couple years will add some richness or balance to it. Will revisit."
""
""
"A good wheat wine and the fact that it's bourbon barrel aged helps obviously. The only negative is it's advertised as ""white chocolate"". The bottle I got tasted nothing like white chocolate or vanilla for that matter. The bruery has def put out better barrel aged beers in the past."
""
"Compared to the 2012 batch this is obviously not what the brewers intended, but there's no reason to send this back.  I've had a lot of intentionally soured that were far harder to drink than this."

"Before even seeing this bottle, and knowing little about The Bruery (had only tried the Tart of Darkness prior). First nose and sip I was convinced this was a sour. A delicious one at that. Was drunk at a bottle share so can't say much about my 2-3oz pour. But later found out that this was totally infected. Hoping to try it non-infected but would gladly buy this as a sour."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This was definitely an infected bottle yet I decided to review the beer anyway because it turned out to be well worth drinking. The vanilla, cacao, and bourbon treatment made for a really interesting flavour profile when combined with the sourness from the infection. A happy accident."

"The pour is a murky light brown, no visible head. Bubbles coming from the bottom, some nice film around the glass. Smell is sweet and huge with white chocolate flavor. What a great smelling beer. There's a sweet bourbon start on the flavor, then falls back to a smooth white chocolate and vanilla after taste. You can also pick up oak, and the alcohol burn isn't overwhelming. It's incredibly sweet but it's so flavorful. Medium mouthfeel, slightly carbonated, thought it would be more bubbly from the appearance, but I'm glad it's not. Nice unique beer and a great sipper."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, fine cushy carbonation, sugary;. Surprisingly easy to drink for the sweetness and alcohol levels; goes down easy. Goes well with Pepperidge Farm Brussels cookies."

"Bottle: Poured a golden amber color ale with a nice large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of white chocolate is actually surprising with some residual sugars and some vanilla. Taste is also very reminiscent of white chocolates with some vanilla and quite a bit of residua sugars. Taste is quite over-theâ€“top so it is probably best to drink this in small doses. Body is about average for style with good carbonation with no alcohol being easily apparent. Interesting experiment for sure but not something I would seek on a regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear and golden color with minimal head and no lacing. The nose is light but heavy on sweet malt, caramel, toffee, vanilla and hot alcohol. The taste is very similar, a cloying mix of vanilla, caramel and overly sweet malt. It has a heavy body and minimal carbonation making it oily, silky and thick. Overall, an interesting brew that was just to sweet and unbalanced for me."

"Served from a 2012 bottle into a Bruery tulip (proper!). Poured a vibrant yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, wheat, sweet alcohol, vanilla, and cocoa nibs. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, wood, milk chocolate, wheat, earth, spice, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. There is a ton of stiff going on in this one. The nose was really quite nice and balanced. Almost like this is just an unassuming beer for the masses. The flavor is the first hint that something is going on here. The booze on the follow through confirms it. This thing has simmered down some in the time before I opened it. Granted this made it really quite well balanced and easy to drink. Yes, I just said that. At 14+%, this was easy to drink. Could I kill an entire bottle to the face, probably. Would I recommend this to high schoolers to butt chug? Absolutely. The less of them there are, the better, after all. Definitely find a way to get this on your palate. Based on the rumors from the 2013 bottles, get a 2012. Based on this, you won't regret it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting attempt at playing around with the base beer."
""
""
"Overall, a delicious beer in its own right, but one that I can't help wondering what it would taste like without that tartness. As noted already, the tart didn't ruin the beer by any means, but it was hard not to long to taste it in all its rich, sweet glory without that tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is a transparent dark amber with a foamy white head. Nose is a fair bit of bourbon, heavy wheat base and odd caramel malt, muddled and dirty with a hint of coconut and notes of milk chocolate. Taste is extremely sweet and not integrated at all. The bourbon is lighter, notes of apple juice and some overly sweet caramel. The chocolate and nib notes are extremely out of place and don't fit in at all. There is tons of sugar, hints of booziness through the softly carbonated finish. The body is big, soft palate and creamy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body has a surprising heft and thickness to it, and acidity plays an interesting feel in the role as it feels like sweetness ought to weigh it down. The dryness that cuts in prevents that. It has a bite on the tongue with every sip, but it's pretty smooth, too."

"First beer of 2013 and a big thanks to MexicanSkittel for sending over this one to me. This was a beer I was pretty excited to try for a good amount of time. The beer poured out as muddy looking gold or copper color with a fizzy white head that comes and goes very quickly. No retention or lacing at all in this beer but I suppose it's due to the high ABV. The smell of the beer is strong, it's got a lot of boozy ethanol fumes as well as vanilla, cocoa and bourbon oak. The smell does resemble actual White Chocolate a little bit. The taste of the beer at first has some sour notes that were a little unexpected from the barrel aging. The more I drank the vanilla and chocolate flavors became more intense which was really impressive. The mouthfeel of the beer was boozy, a little syrupy and had a moderate carbonation to it. Overall I expected the beer to be more along the lines of a Southern Tier Creme Brulee or something like that. It was much stronger than I thought it'd be as well. It's not as good as I had hoped for in my opinion, still very glad I got to try it though."

"If the ale could have finishes like it started, then the tart and spice would have offered enough intrigue and complexity to fit right in. But because of its misplaced dryness and carbonation, those spices and acidities are left on an island to fend for themselves."

"The trick to this beer is to know your drinking a wheat wine and not a White Chocolate Stout. Once you put aside expectation this is a flavorful ""beer"" experience."

""

"O: Very interesting brew. I can't tell if I like it. Barrel aging isn't super heavy but supplies a nice layer of complexity. Even the chocolate and vanilla isn't overpowering. The raisins really stand out for me initially though. Aftertaste is a bit rough, that's my only real complaint. Very unique, strong and complex brew at the same time. Never had anything like this. Making a beer that can actually produce the flavors of white chocolate is an accomplishment in itself."

"Single finger head without much retention and only minimal lacing on a murky burnt orange with golden and copper hues. Aroma of cardboard, white chocolate, apricot, cocoa, vanilla and bourbon. Flavor follows with vanilla dominant notes with additional flavors of cocoa, cane sugar and bourbon. Medium to full body and light to moderate carbonation. I am a little disappointed with this one. It's good but for me didn't live up to the hype. A very boozy beer in both aroma and flavor."
""
"Didn't know what to think about this beer before I tried it. I really thought I wasn't going to like it. Instead it is one of my favorite beers out there. It actually taste like white chocolate. It is beyond delicious. The bottom of the bottle gets a little murky but the flavor is still there. I love this beer!"

"Overall - White chocolate bomb! The tartness was a real pleasant surprise as well. The 14.whatever% alcohol is not a factor at all. I wouldn't change this beer ever. One of my recent favorites."

""
""
"Good night cap."
""
""

"Would it be possible to make a better ""wheatwine"" than this? There's so much going on in a beer that seemed destined to be a booze and sugar bomb. The blending is magnificent here, and the flavors come in spades in a way that this would please beer, bourbon, and wine drinkers alike. A true pleasure to sip on. I wish I had more bottles that I could cellar and see how this would develop over time. Highly recommended - the first beer from these guys that I can safely say was mind-blowing."

"O - The Bruery's White Chocolate lives up to it's name, smelling and tasting like a liquified brownie made with booze. This heavy hitter doesn't deceive; it's alcohol is right out in the open, adding complexity to the white chocolate brew. Mmm delicious."
""
""
""
"6/18/13 bottle that opened cleanly with no gush. Slightly cloudy orange/blonde body with a little white head around the top. You can smell the white chocolate especially as it warms. A hint of vanilla and some bourbon on the nose as well. Oak notes on the nose and in the taste. The finish is incredible. It leaves your tongue coated in white chocolate flavor. A truly impressive beer that is definitely delivering the ABV. It doesn't overpower, and it isn't nearly as hot as other fresh Bruery bourbon beers. Very little tartness. Quite a dessert indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Had the 2012 and thought it was much better from what I remember. Fuller body and lower tartness. Will open a 2012 in the next few days to compare."
"Overall better than I expected. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I'm very pleased with the uniqueness of this beer. This is a true work of art that I'm sure isn't for everyone. I'd love to try it on tap."
""
""

"Normally, I'm not one to reach for the white chocolate (my preference lying with the dark or peanut butter-filled), but who am I to turn down some barrel-aged wheatwine goodness? This stuff pours a hazy auburn topped by a half-finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet bourbon, light candied orange peel, vanilla bean, buttercream, light oak, and a twinge of booze. The taste brings in more of the same, the orange coming through a bit stronger, though tempered a bit by the booze. Still, the sweetness is what reigns supreme here, but not in a Southern Tier Creme Brulee sort of way: more restrained due to the overt cooperation of its constituent parts. Basically, the complexity of the sweetness plays off of itself, rather than having it serve to o'erwash all else as in the aforementioned New York-based stout. The body is a hefty medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice wheatwine, one that somehow did not overdo things with the barrel and the additives, despite how easily it certainly could have. Good times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Love this decadent delight. Should come with its own cake tin."
"Overall: Maybe it's something with the bottle? Once it's in a glass and sits for a while it completely changed and was enjoyable. People also need to remember that regardless of the name and description on the label it's still a wheat wine style beer. All said I will voluntary pick up a couple more of these as I suspect this will be really great with a year or two under its belt."
""
"the booze will get ya for sure, smells amazing and lacks nowhere, age worthy for sure and something I'd like to revisit years from now"
""
""
"I wonder about beers like this...did the Bruery make this beer and then name it or set out to make a beer that tastes like white chocolate. Nailed it. The beer is really sweet, pushing it but not over the edge, and has a nice vanilla flavor to it, creamy smooth, no alcohol sneaking through...thick bodied. It is a good beer but it is a committment to drink it. I won't turn it down in the future but it is a big task to drink this alone...one of the only wheatwines I think tastes good."
""
""
""
""
"O: I hope this beer rounds out and cleans up. Not bad right now but it has room for improvement, especially at the price point...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I never got the cacao nibs in this though, although I suppose I could conjure the 'chocolate' portion of the name..."
""
""
"Overall: Not what I expected. I love The Bruery (I belong to the Preservation Club) and I saw this online to purchase. Bought two bottles, received next day shipping and cooled to 55 degrees. First bottle I thought was a fluke. Saw all these posts and deceided to pop other bottle. Won't buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - my wife isn't a beer drinker but loves wine and ports. She actually likes this beer. Not something I'd like to drink more than once in a blue moon but it really succeeds as a good dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a VERY good wheatwine, but the bourbon dominates the flavor. Alcohol warmth is very present, but it is 14.5%. Hard to consider this a summertime wheatwine when it drinks like a big, slow sippin brew. Glad I had the chance to try this one on tap. I would drink it again."
""
""
""
"While this smells sweet, the taste lags behind, and I think it would be better if it tasted a bit sweeter. As it is, I would drink this beer colder with a dessert pairing."
""
"The smell is the best thing about this beer. It's probably one of the best smelling beers I've ever had. The rest of the beer holds up rather well, but is nowhere near as awesome as the smell is. Worth trying at least once, but as with other Bruery beers, it's just not something I want to drink on a regular basis. Thanks again for sharing this one, Doug!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't know that I'm going to be able to explain this one. It just really didn't do it for me. I think the amount of maltiness didn't stand up to the treatments, and it's just too sweet to drink much of. It lacks the heft of a nice barrel-aged barleywine. I was really looking forward to this beer, and just came away disappointed. In general, I'd be tempted to give it a second go, but at this price point I don't know that I will."
""
""

"O- Beer doesn't look all the great and the nose isn't earth shattering, but everything is amazing. Great beer, very interesting idea, worth seeking out!"

"T: One of my friends I was tasting this with called it best- this tastes like a White Chocolate Clif Bar. It's almost identical to the white chocolate coating that they use. I get cocoa, bourbon, milk chocolate, a lingering, almost sour finish and just a touch of oak. Slight burn from the booze, but this beer is just money."

"Full bodied, milder carbonation, creamy, sticky and soft on the tongue. Similar to what others have said, this beer is wildly expressive and flavorful, although insanely sweet and rich. We split a bottle between 4 people and finished every drop."
"Overall a fantastic product. I would strongly recommend pairing this with white chocolate desserts. However, any more than the 4 or 5 ounces I had would probably result in me feeling quite ill."
""
""
""
"This 'beer' most closely resembles a fancy after-dinner chocolate liquer, both in taste, apparent alcohol content, & mouthfeel. The Bruery knows how to make big beer bombs, both the good kind & the bad. This is one of the former. Sneaking over the border of excellent."
"(O)- This is so sugary sweet, but damn it does it fit the name perfectly. Very interesting to say the least. Very happy we split this 5 ways."

"Overall: I was very pleased with this brew. The time in the barrels gave this beer some really nice bourbon flavors and the vanilla and cacao gave it an incredible finish. Definitely a very tasty sipper."

"I'll admit that as a huge fan of both wheatwines and white chocolate that I may be predisposed towards this but The Bruery has done a truly outstanding job here. Every aspect has been nailed. Hands down the best wheatwine I've had and definately in my top 3-5 beers. I'm super excited for the chance to buy more when they release it later this year."

"Almost no head and carbonation. The white chocolate was there but not the same as i got in the Chocolate Rain. Pity cause this beer could have been made much better. Glad to have it though because i love the other Bruery beers (exept the sour ones)..."
""
""
"My respect to The Bruery for pulling this off. It really does smell like beautiful white chocolate."
""
""
"Bottle from trade. White wax top. Pours cloudy yellow-orange with a small head that dissapates quickly. Unique aroma of sour butter, bread dough, yeast, wheat, hints of spice, a bit of campfire. Low to medium carbonation. Flavor is astringent alcohol but not bad. White chocolate and citrus, maple syrup maybe, with an alcohol finish that stings. Almost like a white chocolate rum, but the citrus and syrup flavors balance this out. Medium to heavy syrup mouthfeel. Neat beer!"
""

""
""
""

"Overall, this is a good beer to have with friends and family. A sipper a little goes along way easily sharable with 4 to 6 people at 2 to 4oz pours. If you can trade for it do it. Glad I still have quite a few bottles left to enjoy in the coming years."
""
""
"pours a clear amber, slightly hazy, with almost no head. the nose is a white chocolatey marshmallow with some oak and chocolate. tasty beer with great chocolate and ghram cracker, bit of wheat. the mouthfeel is rich like a barleywine and drinkable. very sweet, but drinkable, a bit boozy. this is tasty, but not crazy unbelievable."

""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: How does this get a 4.19 on this site? I understand that people like The Bruery's high abv booze bombs, and there are some good ones, but this is definitely bottom of the barrel in that department. While the nose showed some promise, this was artificial tasting, boozy, muted, and the feel was light and harsh, making it difficult to choke down my 6oz glass. Fruet was leagues better than this, proving that The Bruery can make high quality booze bombs. This was a complete disaster, however. Drain even had a tough time with this, and she's dealt with some doozies in the past. I'm glad you boys were thinking of me when this came out, so I greatly appreciate the bottles gents. Can't win 'em all."
"D - Very bold, complex, and interesting. But also very well balanced."

"O - this is an awesome desert beer and perfect to share with. That said, I could take this down solo with pleasure. This beer, along with Fruet and Melange, make me happy to be an RS member and make me feel like the Bruery owns this country's best barrel program. And I haven't even had CR, BT, or GM. Soon..."

"Overall: How does the Bruery take these monster beers and make them so smooth? Its beyond me. This is probably the best wheatwine that I have had. It a tough style to do really well in my mind. I wasnt blown away, but really thought it was solid. The flavor and mouthfeel are the best aspects of this beer."

"O - interesting beer...definitely get some white chocolate character here but quite a bit more too. A bit of a sipper and not as smooth as I expected, but still very enjoyable. Not quite a dessert beer either. Would definitely like to have again"
""
"O: Phenominal beer. Worth the trade demand. I put the value at 3-4 KH."
"Follow up: gave a great spiciness to my slow cooked meat pot, 2 weeks after opening"

"Verdict: A very nice bourbon barrel beer from The Bruery. While certainly a sweet, sipping beer, the richness is moderately kept in check making this a great beer to share for desert."

"Overall mixed, the nose is great, the taste starts great but seems to fade the more it opens and especially as the booze really kicks in. Quite a nice beer if the booze didn't really kick in, and I wish some of the great aromas like bourbon and vanilla were more present on the flavor. Curious how this will age, could be great as the booze mellows and the flavors merge, or could be bad as all the great characteristics fade out."
""
""
"O - Overall this isn't a bad beer. Like this much more than white oak. Not sure how this will hold up to age though."

"Overall: White Chocolate is a really interesting beer and one I would recommend to any lover of big sweet beers. That said, have a few friends on hand as a full 750 gets a little much."

"The beer is yellowish orange with a thin white head. The aroma offers vanilla, oak, chocolate, malt, booze. Fabulous flavor. Super smooth and teeming with flavor. Vanilla candy and seriously...white chocolate. Alcohol is certainly there but doesn't bother me. Delicious. Would happily have this again."

"O: Yeah, I want more of this. Itâ€™s not a revelation, but itâ€™s beautifully accurate and rich. Yep, drink it and enjoy the confection."

"An interesting beer that lives up to its name, cheers!"

"Quite an enjoyable beer overall. It's not for everyone, and I'd never want an entire bottle to myself, but it's great in small quantities."
"O - Smell is different, but tast is very nice. White chocolate for sure."

"O: this is a fun ass big American beer. Not something I wanna drink very often but the bruery did a great job at making a white chocolate wheat wine, that's exactly what it smells and tastes like. if your one of those people that just goes crazy for big sweet beers, this and a lot of the bruery beers are for you . If you dont want to be drinking sweet boozy beer, then i understand, its not for most occasions. And I could see how this brew could even offend some beerdrinkers, it's just fucking nuts that only American brewers, and the Bruery, would try to pull off. I think it smelled better than it tasted. .some next level shit. Obviously a beer like this will only get better with time to mellow out."

"o - overall, great. white chocolate!!!"
"O: This one ends up tasting like the name; well, maybe a bit more like frosting, but the white chocolate is definitely there. Which leads me to have mixed emotions about this beer: On the one end, this beer tastes the way it is supposed to. It is a well crafted beer and it is a very creative take on the style. The alcohol is well hidden. But on the other, it is sweet, with a candy-like taste. And I don't want to drink a glass of candy. In the end, I imagine your appreciation for this beer will largely depend on your like or dislike for white chocolate."
""

"White Chocolate pours a hazy auburn, turning positively opaque with the final pour. Maybe two fingers of bone colored foam forms to fill out he top of the glass. Head retention and lacing are both minimal, this one's just not much of a looker. The nose though, is fantastic. Lots of vanilla, some toasted brown sugar, and a little bit of chocolate and bourbon. It really does live up to its name. The balance shifts a little bit in the flavor profile. Vanilla is still the central focus here, perhaps even more-so than in the aroma. The brown sugar disappears entirely, leaving more room for the chocolate, and especially the bourbon. Still, the vanilla is just a little bit overbearing here. The mouthfeel though is as good as you could ask for from a beer like this. The body is only heavy enough that I'd guess the beer was 9% or so ABV, and the carbonation is just enough to cut through the beer without distracting in any way. I wasn't sure what to expect from White Chocolate given my mixed reaction to White Oak, but it's a very nice beer. It'd be a great bottle to open after a meal with a few friends."
"4.0 D: This may be the only Bruery beer ever made that is both super high in ABV and not diabetes-inducingly sweet (which is why a Bruery beer is usually the only option if that itch needs to be scratched). That said, this is far too drinkable. You don't have to chew it and you don't have to wince from the booze tinge. It's pretty tasty and definitely worth a try. Does it taste much like actual white chocolate? No, not really, but I'm thrilled about that since white chocolate doesn't do much for me anyway."
""

""

"O: I have to say I am by any means not a fan of white chocolate candy but damn this beer is delicious and the aroma is crazy nuts. The only con is that the sweetness is pretty intense and you might go diabetic after this one."
"o - Overall a pretty interesting and well done beer; probably one of the better wheatwines I've had to be honest. Very interesting nose and taste with a lot of white chocolate and vanilla; pretty cool how they nailed it. The only downside I'd say here is that there is a fair amount of alcohol to it; not terrible considering how high the ABV is, but I was hoping it was hidden a little better than it is. Still quite good and something I look forward to revisiting."

"O: If you are a fan of the sticky sweet beers, this beer is for you. Amazing flavor profile coupled with a unusual mouth feel make this beer a winner in my book. The longer I held onto it and let it warm up the better it got. This beer is another beer I would recommend."
""
""
""
""
"D - I didn't really like the aroma much, but once I got past that there was a really enjoyable beer to be found. It's very sweet and best enjoyed in small quantities, but may be the best Bruery offering I've had in a while. If you like white chocolate (like I do), then check this one out."
""
""
"Overall I was skeptical about this beer but I have to say it totally delivered. I do not like super cloying or boozy beers and you would expect this to be both, but thankfully it is not either. Definitely a sweeter beer, a beer to share with others and sipper/post-dinner beverage. I would say crack one of these open instead of Thanksgiving, Christmas or Valentine's day dessert (not sure if the misses will approve) and share with family, friends and loved ones."
"The drinkability of this is dangerous. I don't feel at all like I'm drinking a 30-proof beer. Sweet, sugary. Good for dessert."

"Overall - share this one...like with 4 or more people. I split this bottle and it was a bit too much for me, it is very sweet and pretty heavy. This is dessert, have a slice of cake rather then the whole thing..."

"A little reminiscent of Chocolate Rain with a sweeter finish. Points for creativity. Glad to have tried it. Thanks TATURBO!."

"O: This is like a white chocolate version of Black Tuesday. Or a Sauternes. A good dessert beer, optimal in small doses."
"I'm not generally a fan of white chocolate to begin with, so it isn't surprising that I wasn't gushing over this beer like the others at our tasting were. If that's your thing, though, you're gonna love this beer."
"M - Medium body. Chewy. Light carbonation."
""
""
""

"O: Overall, I loved it. What else is there to say. World class aroma and complex, tasty flavor profile. Not for the faint of heart, but a must try for fans of big beers. Thanks again Matt for sending this my way!"

"O: When the beer was announced, I was skeptical; I thought White Oak was horrendous, and taking a component of it seemed similarly destined for failure. I will concede that this was better than I had anticipated, but it was still not a great beer; as someone else remarked, ""I'm a little sad that I have 14 bottles of it."" I don't think I'm in the target market here."

"Finally picked up my allocations to try this beer! Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange color with a small white head. Scent is...WOW! I remember reading reviews of this beer when it was first released, and someone said it didn't have a good nose on it. I respectfully disagree with that. The nose is like a delicious desert. I get some definite white chocolate...even a little bit of a cheesecake aroma. Sweet, boozy vanilla aromas with some lovely bourbon. A good amount of vanilla with a hint of orange. Taste is not a dessert-ish as the nose. It is definitely still a sipper and rich like a desert, but the wheatwine characteristics kick in, making it not so rich. Still has some boozy bourbon and vanilla flavors, but also has some orange citrus flavors. Some light maple syrup flavors with a sharp, cloying sweetness almost on the back of the palate. Very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is perfect for this style, as it is not overly carbonated and not too full-bodied. Drinkability is fairly high for what this is. Overall, there is no way in hell I could drink a whole bottle of this, as it is far too rich and sweet for one sitting. However, when shared amongst friends, this beer is brilliant."
"Pours a cloudy dark golden amber with a nice sized off white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of vanilla, bourbon, oak, white chocolate, honey, vanilla frosting, and a solid shot of ethanol. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Lots of sweet vanilla and white chocolate up front with a solid bourbon oak flavor and plenty of alcohol to remind you this is a huge beer. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy mouthfeel. I really liked this beer it's quite different. I'm not sure this needed to be 14.5% abv but I enjoyed sipping on this for most of the night."

"O - Bg, sweet sticky beeper that brings a nice white chocolate and oak flavor. Still really boozy and would love to have this settle down to see what develops."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is really fitting of the name. The aroma especially screams white chocolate with a pretty solid inclusion in the flavor as well. This is quite a hearty sipper that I could never imagine sitting down and wanting to kill a whole bottle of. The solvent alcohol aside, it really is taxing to the palate perhaps even more so than Black Tuesday/Chocolate Rain. Fans of wheatwine will want to give this a try."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is absolutely incredible and is of white chocolate, vanilla beans, cocoa, and bourbon/alcohol. Taste is much the same with a very sweet flavor and a mild tartness. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with an exceptional smell and great flavors."
""
"Drink- I thought it was fantastic. So sad I am not an RS member to land a bottle or 2 to sit on. Will try to get one though. Oh yes it will be mine!!!"
"I like big boozy beers so this is right up my alley. Fans of more integrated less aggressive booze will want to sit on this a while. Flavors are very solid although not quite to the level of Chocolate Rain."

"A very interesting concoction. Thanks again Patrick, Tyler et al."
"Just awesome. I don't think anybody actually expected this to taste/resemble white chocolate, but...it does!"
"Pours very light with a very small head. It looks like the wheatwine cousin of black tuesday. OH WOW. The nose on this beer is unbelievable. Enormous flavor of...wait for it...White Chocolate. Like, potent sweet vanilla white chocolate cake. It smells like a beer/desert hybrid. If you are going to call a beer ""White Chocolate", I cannot imagine you could make it smell any better than this. The taste is very sweet, like sipping on desert. It doesn't come off as inappropriate, other than this being released in 750 mL bottles. Again, sweet vanilla and white chocolate cake coupled with a bit of booziness (but, for those familiar with BT, it's on par). The mouthfeel is moderate and actually not as huge as BT or as expected. Surprisingly easy to drink given everything above. The bottom line is that this beer is quite the achievement. I don't like actual white chocolate and find this beer to be a better execution than the product itself. 5 in the execution because I cannot imagine nailing a beer with this name better. I had probably a 4 oz pour of this, BT and a 2 oz 50/50 cuvee. BT was slightly more dominant in flavor, the blend didn't live up to my expectations and WC really impressed. After drinking all of that, I took a bit more out of the end of the bottles and quickly realized that I didn't really want or need it. I would say sitting down with 4-5 oz of this beer is well sufficient, as, as such, I wouldn't open a bottle of WC with less than 5 people sharing in it."

"Overall: A high ABV beer that has a great tasting, crisp, summer beer feel to it. Be careful as this drinks like a beer with half the alcohol it actually has."

"From the bottle at the Bruery tap room during RBSG 2012. Pours a murky brownish gold color. Aroma is boozy and unwelcoming, disjointed. Flavor is much better: lots of vanilla, thick and sweet caramel/honey. Not much alcohol, just delicious confectionary delight. In sample size, this is awesome. If only it smelled good."
"Not as thick a brew as a Black Tuesday, but that's not a bad thing. Overall, a delicious beer."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a small white head. Nose is full of rich vanilla and chocolate. Very sweet with plenty of bourbon, oak, caramel, and toast. The vanilla and chocolate notes are the stars of the beer on the palate as well. Plenty of bourbon/oak flavors with a subtle toasted maltiness. Just a hint of spice and yeast in the background."
