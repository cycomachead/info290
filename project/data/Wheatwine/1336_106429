3.66,1.9,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75," The taste has a flavor of dark wheat -somewhat grain influenced with mild toasted accent and subtle sweetness from the wheat with a mild yeast spice and a light alcohol influence as it finishes with a subtle caramel  quality in the residual taste. Overall this is a very good wheatwine, not intensely hopped or full of alcohol, but a substantial and drinkable strong wheat ale for 8%","Slatetank","Jul 13, 2014"
