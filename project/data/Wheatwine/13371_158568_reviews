"Glassy appearance, medium amber color with a thin layer of white head that held at a collar and left some speckled of lacing. Barrel-heavy aroma, lots of booze, apple and tequila. Almost tasted more like apple brandy than tequila to me, lots of malts and sugary sweetness, oaky background. Chewy mouthfeel, filmy aftertaste, viscous body. Not bad, but a small pour was enough for me."
