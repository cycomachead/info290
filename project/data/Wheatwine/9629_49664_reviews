"O: I thought this was fairly enjoyable, although the predominance of the blood orange flavor eliminates any illusion of complexity. But, it's a natural pleasant flavor to find in the beer. Glad to have tried this one."

"Overall, there was some really nice fruit flavor, but it didn't really come together on the palate for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really interesting beer and incredibly refreshing for such a high level of alcohol. Based on the flavors, I'm going to guess that this is the 2014 release--the orange flavor is just so fresh and juicy."

"Final thought - 10% and awesome. Wow. thank you shorts brewing and marcatgsb!"
""
""
"They put something in this beer that they shouldn't have. Maybe some part of the blood orange? Whatever it is, it gives the flavor a powerful and unpleasant bitterness. I like plenty of bitter beers, but this is just nasty. An unhesitating, unquestioned drainpour."
""
""
""
""
"O-an interesting ale, good flavor, a unique ale"
""
""
"O - As my first Wheatwine, I love it! I'm sure they are not all this citrusy, but this was excellent. I need to convince Dan Cary from New Glarus to make one of these. He sure knows his way around wheat beer. Excellent work Shorts!"

"Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with a little more carbonation than appears. Slick and smooth. Clean finish almost like the carbonated juice drinks."
""
""
"Pours hazy reddish orange color with a small 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge orange, orange zest, orange rind, grapefruit, peppercorn, caramel, coriander, bread, floral, grass, earth, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity; with a huge citrus presence as expected. Taste of big orange, orange zest, caramel, grapefruit, orange rind, coriander, peppercorn, floral, grass, earth, and herbal. Light citrus rind tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, citrus rind, grapefruit, peppercorn, coriander, caramel, toast, floral, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic citrus and peppery flavor balance with nice complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish."

"I've had less than great experiences with Short's and their crazy concoctions. This one actually drinks like a glass of blood orange juice with a little wheat and caramelized sweetness. Damn is it tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting brew, and an okay summer drink, but not something I would actively seek out again."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was an interesting brew that I was glad to try, but probably wouldn't seek out to try again. It was packed with flavor but the zestiness and peppercorn were a little bit too much in my opinion, plus it was fairly flat. Overall this is definitely something worth trying for it's uniqueness, but I wouldn't necessarily seek it out unless you love blood oranges."
""
"I'm glad I traded for several of these. The first couple I found a bit strange but the more I drink, the more I like this. It's a great original take on wheatwines with such potent blood orange flavor and it goes down dangerously easily for a 10% brew. Highly recommended for any fellow wheatwine fans because it's like no other. I'll be trading for some of this every year."

"Decanted into a Gigantic Brewing goblet (it was convenient). Poured a pleasant honey-amber color, pristine clarity, no head, but a wispy layer of bubbles that dissipated to an extremely thin ringlet; no lacing. Lots of orange in the aroma, pith, pulp, rind, you name it, spicy peppercorns that came out more as the beer warmed up, herbal hops, and a bit of booziness. Taste was distinctively dominated by orange, much like the aroma, tangy, toasted wheat, secondary notes of banana peel, and a ubiquitous peppercorn presence. Higher alcohol was detectable, but not imposing. Flavors melded very well. Medium body, low carbonation, unusually good drinkability. Very nice!"
"The reveal: Short's Anniversary Ale! A Blood Orange wheatwine, with orange zest and green peppercorns! On BA it says it was aggressively dry-hopped, so I got that and a citrusy fruit. Totally whiffed on the peppercorns though, and the actual style was a mystery, but in my defense, a fruited hoppy wheatwine is tough to pick out. I should have guessed Shorts though. Great beer! Looks pretty polarizing on BA, but I really enjoyed it. Thanks Abraxel!"

"O: I think I would like this beer a lot more without the peppercorns. While they do add interesting layers of flavor, I think they are also partly clashing with the blood oranges. This is an interesting beer and it was worth the purchase, but probably not one I'd have again."
""
""
"Fuller medium body, lighter carbonation, sticky and full on the tongue. I really enjoyed the hell out of this one - between the oranges, peppercorns and warmth, this was one of the best Short's beers I've tasted in a long time. More, please."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer from Short's, the taste and smell are awesome and I think it is among the best of Short's line of eccentric brews. Very good, and definitely worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Wow... again, the flavors from the oranges are big and bad. Grapefruit and orange dominate the palate with undertones of cereal wheat and honey. This is absolutely fantastic. My favorite beer from Short's without a doubt. Unique, thirst quenching, vibrant. Is this really ten percent?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I found this beer enjoyable, but would probably not seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
"This just isn't quite my style. It's not bad by any means, though. In fact, I'd consider it to be a VERY GOOD beer just because I never thought ""Peppery, sour orange juice brine"" would be an appealing flavor. Definitely glad to have tried this, and it's a unique beer, but I'd not have it often."
""
""
""
"Overall: i picked up the last one of these at the store when i had thought i missed it. and am i glad i did. this is a great beer. i wish i coulda got a whole sixpack. the tastes are spot. just delicous"

"Enjoyed a 2013 Anniversary Ale fresh. The blood oranges are a little more vibrant and assertive and the peppercorn is toned down just a touch, but it still an integral part of the brew. Hop character is also a bit more prominent. Mouth feel is better than I remember, and the juicy, sweet, and nearly tart blood orange finish is fantastic. Don't know if this is ""better"" fresh, or the 2013 batch was just a little more to my liking, but I've gotta bump the score. This is great stuff."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 4/20/2012. Pours hazy reddish orange color with a small 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge orange, orange zest, orange rind, grapefruit, peppercorn, caramel, coriander, bread, floral, grass, earth, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity; with a huge citrus presence as expected. Taste of big orange, orange zest, caramel, grapefruit, orange rind, coriander, peppercorn, floral, grass, earth, and herbal. Light citrus rind tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, citrus rind, grapefruit, peppercorn, coriander, caramel, toast, floral, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic citrus and peppery flavor balance with nice complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent wheatwine! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"This is my first Shorts Brewing beer and Anniversary Ale is one of the most unique Ales I have had…I guess I am still trying to figure this one out. I plan to age a few of these to see how age affects this unique brew."
""
"Whew. Blood oranges. You get subtle hints of it on the nose, but there is nothing subtle about the blood oranges on the flavor profile. The bitter tones that taste like they are from the orange's skin are too prevalent. Beyond that, there is little that you get a ride from. As a wheatwine, this falls short. As a beer, it's alright."
""
"Quite the enjoyable beer, glad I still have one left, the only question is, when?"
"A nice change. The blood oranges really come through. The peppercorn provides a nice bonus."
""
""
""
""
"O: I actually really like this beer. Honestly, it's like biting into an orange picked straight off the tree. Rind and all."
""
""
""
""
"Overall real impressive, it's like eating grapefruit rinds and all its bitter softness in a liquid form, with a chewy backbone. Neat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious grapefruit and orange flavors on the palate. Spicy, peppery, herbal. Some earthy notes mid palate. Finishes quite bitter and herbal. Dry and light bodied. Delicious."
"O: I really enjoyed this, but I guess I haven't had anything else to compare this against. I will be seeking other ""wheatwines"" and compare. I also may be very partial here because I love the taste of blood orange. If you like blood orange and don't mind the alcohol heat, this is your beer."

"O: I can't remember ever having a beer like this one before, which is why I pick it up each year. It is a unique flavor pairing, and it really challenges the tastebuds. Like many of the Short's brews, this is probably not for everyone. Though I enjoy it, I do have to be in the mood for it, but there really isn't anything quite like it."

"O: Extremely well rounded and great tasting. Definitely one that I would pick a bunch of and perhaps age if it ages well."
"O - Overall I am very impressed with this beer. I only spent a few months in Michigan, but Short's is definitely one of the breweries that I will truly miss."
"There's no doubt this is crisp, and a medium body shows some depth to it, with a good smoothness that a little more of would serve to put this one a step above. It goes slightly slick in the mouthfeel toward the finish."
"D. I'm on the verge of liking this. Probably the hoppiest BW or WW that I've had and enjoyed - the citrus hop character really helps to accentuate the citrus in the beer. It just - idk- it doesn't quite hit me like I want it to, but a good beer overall."
"mouthfeel - drinkable, medium to thick bodied, curious how this would age. good carbonation for the body."
"O: Exceeded my expectations to the point where I am ISO another bottle. I thoroughly enjoyed the ipa-like qualities this had to offer. Send me another bottle Jay!"
"D: Certainly very flavorful but the question is how that flavor appeals to the individual, goes down slowly because of the strange flavor and the high ABV, not too filling, very strong kick, odd representation of style, this is without a doubt the strangest beer I have ever tasted over 6+ years and 2500+ reviews. This is definitely a novelty beer but it has a taste that can grow on you if you have an affinity for that kind “Bloody Mary” flavor."
"O: Overall I really like this beer a good break from the IPA's, DIPA's and Stouts I have been enjoying lately. This one is definitely a sipper and really hitting the spot. 4.0"
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a 1 inch orange-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, blood oranges, citrus zest, and some pepper notes. Taste is of blood oranges, blood orange juice, citrus zest, and a spicy kick from the peppercorns. The aftertaste is a bit acidic and definitely citrus zest bitterness lingers on the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good and interesting beer with the blood orange and peppercorn combination."
"Overall, this is not a top choice for wheatwines, but I do understand the desire to make an anniversary beer different and exciting-- I just think this is not a very enjoyable beer, wheatwine or not."
"I give two Schlitz about Short's Anniversary Ale. Here's to another great year of brewing."
"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one. 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a deep red-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, orange, sugar, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, orange, sugar, and syrup. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I was not really a big fan of this one. I'm starting to wonder if wheat wines are just not for me or something... The idea is nice, but usually the execution is off for my palate. The sweetness from the sugar on this one really killed it for me unfortunately. Worth trying for a fan of the style, but if you have never had one before I suggest starting elsewhere."
"Deep orange color in the glass, very sexy color. Head is absent, managed to force a few bubbles with a heavy pour, but they run and hide. The carbonation is present in the mouth, however. Aromas of sweet candied oranges, smells sticky. Flavor has god intensity, orange is nicely squeezed in the midpalate with a wheaty finish. A good bit of heat fro mthe booze, matches up nicely with the mellow, rich body to this beer. Very solid brew, my favorite of the Short's I've tried."
"O - The beer is interesting to say the least. It has some good flavors and is pretty well crafted."
"O- This was really cool and unusual to try. Certainly not something I'd wanna drink everyday, but I'm really glad I got to try this. Thank you northernbrews!"
"D: I love a shorts beer and this is mos definitely that. Totally out there. I love this beer. Totally different take on the style."
"Drink- I really wanted this to blow me away and I was just wrong direction. I didnt like the taste at all. I am sure this is for some people but just not me."
"Overall it's a very interesting brew that I'd like to re-try ever now and again just because it's so interesting. Tasty too!"
"This is my first Wheatwine, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but glad I tried it. This is a good example of a seasonal beer as I can't imagine drinking a lot of it, but will look for it again when I'm back in Michigan next year."
"O: One of the best wheatwines I have had so far. The blood oranges gave it a nice flavor and made it much more drinkable probably. Does not seem like a 10% beer whatsoever."
"O: I have 1-additional bottle of this that I brought back with me and I am curious to see how this evolves in the bottle. I should've really popped this 2-months ago when I first got home to get a better idea of it while fresh, compared to the bottle I'm cellaring. Certainly interesting for the style, I think I'm just not personally a huge fan of this type of beer, but was curious to try it. I honestly had no preconceived notions of what to expect here."
"The CPJ"
"O - Not a bad beer, and a lot better than I was expecting. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, and I got this down pretty easily."
"Overall: A fantastic achievement in the art and practice of brewing. Wheat wine can be great or not so, and this one was the best of the style I've had to date. Captures the flavor of the blood orange, and the essence of a wheat wine in perfect harmony."
"This beer pours a bright reddish copper in color with a light off white lacing. It hits blood orange in color on the head. It smells or orange peels with light sweet caramel malts. It's pretty appealing on the nose. It tastes of grated orange peels that've assaulted your palate with an aerial assault. It's very spicy and doesn't present any alcohol at all. It maskes the generic overly sweet malt of the style and is overly fruity. It drinks well and is pretty light in body. It features a lot of malt but doesn't drink in an overly sticky manner. The alcohol isn't present whatsoever. Overall this is one of the better wheatwines I've had. The fruit did this one some favors. I'd recommend it."
"O: A decent beer. A bit odd at times, but the flavor combination seems to work quite well, much more so than in Short's other beers. Slight bitter and slightly sweet."
"o: this is a great wheat wine and the orange zest is an incredible flavor in this. Blends well in the style and I'll be trying to get a few more of these."
"O: This is a very unique beer. The blood orange flavors are right up front and not subtle at all. But it's still very tasty. I only bought 1 bottle, but I'd probably have another - curious what a year or 2 would do for it."
"Overall this is a very interesting brew, which I'm glad to have had. A little bit too sweet for me, but I appreciate the effort from Short's. Not too many beers out there made with oranges that work very well, but this one is on the right track."
"O: This brew is interesting and like all Short's beers its incredibly unique. The resulting product is drinkable and worth a try."
"Finally gonna crack into this tasty-sounding wheatwine. It pours a clear amber-copper topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises blood orange zest, tart orange, nutmeg, maple syrup, and light black pepper. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some mandarin orange syrup, light green peppers, banana, light vanilla bean, ruby red grapefruit, and some very light leek. Somehow, this thing tastes both all over the place and citrus-centric at the same time. Nice. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice wheatwine, one that shows what strategic use of blood oranges can do."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for the opportunity to try this one. Pours a lovely deep burnt red hue with a quarter inch bright white head that dissipates into a frothy band. Nose is sweet and clearly expresses blood orange and citric acid as well as an herbal/spicy quality. It's really quite interesting and like nothing I've ever smelled before in a beer. Taste expresses a great deal of citrus rind as well as a trace of sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a lively carbonation and quite a bit of astringency. An interesting beer. I'm happy to have tried it; however, a half pour was more than sufficient."
"Overall - it's unlike any beer I've ever had. I can respect what Shorts was trying to do. It may not be the most drinkable beer but its one of the most memorable I've had from them."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of rayl101! Many thanks Kevin!). Pours a slightly hazy orange-mahogany color with thin off-white head. Carbonation is quite active. Aroma had loads of sweet orange, pith, wheat, caramel, and light pepper. Taste is sweet with the orange really coming through. The peppercorns are noticeable, but only appear at times. This one is definitely more about the orange. Full bodied with a sticky texture. A nice beer!"
"Pours a clear copper maroon, slight head and some lacing. Aroma is juicy orange, sugary cherry, floral, grassy, macadamia nut, with a spicy and peppery undertone. There's a lot of really interesting stuff going on here, all nicely integrating and nothing dominating. I like the contrast between spicy and sweet. The taste does not quite live up to the great aroma in terms of breadth and balance of flavor, with the pepper coming through more--perhaps for the worse. Also present in the taste is a bitter red grapefruit. This is pretty dry. Carbonation and body are both medium. No heat to speak of. Overall, this has a really interesting nose, but the flavor comes up lacking, and I didn't find myself wanting another one after finishing."
"O - I sipped on this for awhile and I'm still a little baffled. It isn't like anything I've had to date - oddly enough, it's almost like a flanders mixed with a saison."
"2011 bottle poured into snifter on 05/12/2011. This beer immediately lives up to its name. Blood orange/red body topped by a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves very little lace. The nose is met with orange (strong citrus) and a touch of honey for an attempt to balance. The taste follows though- lots of blood orange, sweet malt, with a slightly bitter finish. Medium body, light/medium carbonation. Good and interesting brew. One or two is enough."
"D - One of the better wheatwines I've had, and one of the strongest Short's offerings I've had in recent memory. The flavor combination worked for me, and the 10% ABV was pretty unobtrusive. I'd have this one again for sure."
"The beer is ruby hued and transparent, with 1/4"" head and decent lacing. The aroma is primarily of hops, with a present alcohol sweetness. The flavor starts out well, with hops in the driver seat, masking the alcohol for the most part. Unfortunately, the finish brings an oddness and harshness that negatively impacts my enjoyment to a great degree. The sweetness mounts rapidly, and I could see this beer becoming cloying quickly. A couple of ounces was more than enough for me."
"Pours a ruby redish blood organish color with very little head and a slight amount of hops. The aroma is of big orange and some other citrus notes along with a hint of peppercorn and some breadiness. The taste has a breadiness backbone with hints of pepper but the real star is the big orange and grapefruit flavors. A nice sweet inviting taste. There is a slight hop bite at the end to bring in some balance. There is no hint of booze. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall this is a very good beer , the aroma draws you in and the taste left me wanting more. I would seek this beer out."
"Beer is sweet and quite hoppy, thin up front with a moderately dry finish. The overall beer is quite good too. As the beer warms unfortunately it takes on this medicinal sweetness and harsh finish with a really bad aftertaste of grainy acidity and a little sulfur. I don't know what the deal with this beer is but overall I did not enjoy it. In the beginning I really liked it but it was all downhill from there."
"Thanks again Jim!"
"O: Wow, color me impressed. Even if you're not a fan of wheat wines, seek this one out. It was a great experience to drink on a multitude of levels. Appearance, aroma, taste, all pushing the boundaries and working synergistically to create an amazing drinking experience. Well done Shorts! Keep this adventurous spirit alive and screw the mainstream."
"I really enjoyed this. There now way a beer this big should go down so easy in warm weather. Could drink this all spring/summer if feasible"
"O: This is a great wheat wine, and I would feel less concerned with using this blood oranges in a homebrew. I would not even think that this beer would be at 11.7% ABV at all, nice job."
"This is not a subtle beer. It is intense and in your face, but still enjoyable if a little rough around the edges."
"HV"
"Overall a very nice effort. Makes a nice nightcap. But I couldn't drink more than one of these at a time."
"O: I think the year in the cellar has helped this beer out, bringing its various elements into balance. An above-average wheatwine. "
"D - Not someting to drink a lot of in one sitting especially with the 11.7 abv totally masked. Would make a nice digestif w/ pastry or even fresh fruit."
"Overall: Hey, it wasn't infected! The blood orange is quite tasty, but to be honest this isn't a beer I could drink a lot of. A unique beer with an awesome aroma that was a pleasure to try."
"Overall I though this was one excellent beer. For this warm mid Michigan night I don't think I could have picked a better beer. To me everything about this beer screams warm weather, the citrus flavors were bold and in your face and I thought that was really good and unique. The blood orange was the most prevalent of the citrus fruits like the description on the bottle implies, the peppercorns were much more subtle and harder to pick out but they did add to the complexity of this beer. The only other Wheatwine I have had was Pilgrims Dole from New Holland, its hard to compare the two since Pilgrims Dole seemed to be much straight forward and truer to the style, while on this beer shorts seems to use the Wheatwine as a backbone to hold tons of hoppy and citrus fruit flavors normally associated with DIPA's, I expect Shorts to try something with a style nobody has tried before and this seems to go along with that just like it should. The drinkability of this beer was awesome, it went down really smooth and there was no way I would have guessed this was almost 12%, which could make it pretty devastating after two or three. I only bought one bottle but I am making sure to grab a six pack before they are all gone so I can have some during the summer. I think everybody should give this beer a try, it's just that good. This was one kick ass brew from Shorts, I love all the crazy shit you guys do to your brews, keep it up."
"Drink and overall: The Shorts legend continues to grow. Fantastic wheat wine, that shines with the addition of peppercorns and blood oranges. I'd say this is a hit, rather than a miss. A beer for savoring."
"Growler thanks to StFun on Ratebeer! Clear, but very dark orange/red pour, light lasting lacing and an aroma of sweet blood oranges and a little caramel. Flavor is incredibly unique; toffee, floral bittersweet blood oranges, then jumps into bitter grapefruit, pineapple and finished with a warming and just slightly boozy aftertaste. Very good, I might need to go chasing after a few bottles of this."
"O - As usual with Shorts beers...this is interesting and a bit unique. I liked it, but not sure I need a lot of this. We shared a bottle three ways and it seemed about right. Good in small quanities, but not sure that a full bottle is necessary."
"d - fairly drinkable if you're into it. short's beers seem to be hit or miss, and this is a miss to me. certainly an interesting flavor experience, but not a beer that i'd want to have again."
"D: if this werent utterly through the roof in terms of ABV, id drink it forever. i know by the time i get to the end ill be ready to move on, but i will be refilling its space in my cellar with more bottles. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"D - Unique beer. Good to try one."
"Drinkability: Middle of the road in terms of drinkability, a bomber would be overwhelming."
"Unique none the less. Difficult to find and a little pricey for these beers, but I do enjoy it. It's a sipping beer, but the sweetness makes it feel like I could slam this. ABV is definitely prevalent. A beer you'd just have one of. I've had this out of a growler and a bottle and both were excellent. I'd have it again, but doubt I'll seek it out."
"The mouthfeel was mildly carbonated and medium in body."
"D- Not the easiest to drink by any means. This one grew on me a lot."
"Drinkability: One-dimensional and strange. I couldn't seem to find anything underneath the heavy grapefruit and blood orange. This felt more like a novelty beer than a celebratory one."
"Courtesy of jdubFL, wow! thanks Justin! Growler poured out clear copper with thin off white head. The aroma is IIPA like with fresh rich citrus, pine and grassiness and then a mild malt like sweetness. The taste is yummy with fresh rich citrus flavors, some pine hop bitterness, spicy rye notes, some drying malt roastiness and a thin layer of sweet maltiness. These notes all head off into the finish with the addition of a pleasing black tea like sensation that brings the whole thing together. This beers is fresh, rich citrus, robust, pummeling hops and yet manages to create a semblance of balance too. Wow! I need a keg or two of this."
"The more time I spend with this beer, the more its lingering flavors come out, and after not having taken a sip for several minutes, I distinctly taste peppercorns on the front of my tongue. I like that."
"Interesting, but not my favorite Shorts beer..."
"Overall a great experience. I don't see knocking down a 6 pack on poker night, its the type of beer you drink in front of a fire and think about. Or drink some with a citrus based dessert. Makes me kinda wish I had one of those dumb chocolate covered orange things you get from people at work on Christmas."
"D - This is a sipping beer if I've ever had one. Warming and potent with a complex flavor profile, Short's Anniversary has some well-used, interesting ingredients to make a good wheatwine."
"Drinkability: I did a 180° with this beer; at first I found it unbalanced and a bit too herbal but as it warmed, I enjoyed the subtle flavorings and, in particular, the peppercorn heat on the finish"
"Weird beer... Doesn't seem to be like most Wheatwines."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability isn't that great for me, the oranges were just too overpowering to get much of anything else out of it. It felt more like an OJ and vodka at times. I really love the wheatwine style, but this beer didn't do it for me at all. On the positive side they did really infuse a fresh orange taste into it."
"D- This is another very interesting, unique brew by shorts brewing co. The alcohol heat really comes through toward the end of this brew. Still enjoyable and unique."
"Definitely worth trying - weird for a wheatwine, but quite enjoyable. I won't seek this out but would be up for another some time."
"D - interesting here, and perhaps the best wheatwine (a style i just cant seem to figure out) i've had to date. excellent use of fruit, and insanely dangerous with nary any noticeable alcohol."
"Overall I was very impressed with how similar the flavor profile stayed to blood oranges. The sweetness was more robust than normal oranges and the citrus notes came through as much as any beer I've had previously. Very much worth a shot."
"D-Nice beer overall...good job Short's!"
"D: Reading through previous reviews I almost have to question my taste. It seems a lot of what I liked about this beer wasn't a big hit with others. I'm glad I got this one recommended to me though. I think I could drink these until I passed out; wouldn't have guessed this was above 6%. I see how the smell could be off-putting to some but if you stick around its gold. Nectar of the Gods in a few years time? I hope so."
"This is probably the best beer I've had so far from Short's. But that's not saying much."
"I tried this again after buying a six pack three-4 weeks later. It was much less bitter, much hotter, and much boozier. Not as great as I remembered. Fresh, this beer was amazing."
"... and now, for something completely different. The palate. Grapefruit juice and rind is just overwhelming here. This is very, very intense, this almost tastes like they tossed the blood oranges in whole rather than actually separate the zest, the rind and the flesh. The sweetness of the nose does not translate to the palate, it is in fact quite low, as is the spice. Boozy on the finish with a little sweetness with vanilla and candied oranges. A light spice character is present on the finish. Full in body with a smooth palate and low carbonation, this has great flavors but is just a little too intense to be drinkable. And, as it warms up, I get a slightly stale flavor I find in a few wheatwines. Solid stuff."
"Like nothing else I've ever encountered. Interesting stuff."
"d - Kind of a weird beer. The smell was ok, but the taste wasn't very enjoyable. Wouldn't seek out again."
"It felt somewhat syrupy, with a light bitter bite. If it was easier to come across this I would be worried about being too drinkable."
"Pours dark red brown, zero head despite an aggressive pour. Smells citrusy, very much like fresh squeezed orange juice. The peppercorns are in the nose as well, however much more subtly. Tart citrusy taste from the oranges, almost borders on sour. There is a spiciness from the peppercorns. Also some sweet caramel malt throughout. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and syrupy. Surprisingly drinkable for how sweet and high in alcohol it is. A really unique beer, worth tracking down and keeeping a few in the cellar."
"Carbonation is fizzy and high, though easy to drink even with the sharpness. Would pair nice at brunch as a complement to some waffles since it has a champagne dryness, similar to a mimosa."
"This is probably the best beer I've had out of the Short's camp. Their bizarre creations can be hit or miss, count this firmly in the hit category. I think I might return to the store where I bought it and pick up another 6-pack or two. Here's to hoping they have some left."
"I'd rate this as a good beer. The peppercorns, however, have really taken over, obliterating most of the orange, wheat, & hops that might have originally existed here. Nice twist, & happy to have another 10 ounces to work through a Burn Notice with."
"Sampled at the Great Taste of the MW. The 2010 Anniversary edition. Pours a truly awesome blood orange reddish tan color with a tan head. Liquid ruby comes to mind. Grapefruit and orange aromas in the nose, very pleasant. Very sweet and malty start that then turns slightly bitter. Medium mouthfeel. This is a beer that I hate to rush and drink as it really is very good."
"D- Fairly high, style in mind. The alcohol is in check- boozy but not out of line. A refreshing take on a favorite style of mine."
"This is a sipper, and has some wonderful flavors in it. Who would have thought that pepper and blood oranges would complement each other so well? Another creative and well crafted beer from Bellaire, MI."
"D- Short's just likes to make beers that make you think a lot. The flavors are very present during the whole beer and are in your face. Short's does well with making beers you want to drink over and over again. The ABV is high on this which limits it but only if you want to play it safe."
"Pours an orangish color with an off white head. Smell is immediately magnetic to my nose--the peppercorns and blood orange really make a wonderful pairing. The taste is another step up from there, with the peppercorns not too pronounced and the blood oranges presenting a cacophony of flavors all by themselves. Mouthfeel is exception...thought this was about 5% abv based on taste. Drinkability isn't that high, although I thought about boosting the score about more as this is so good compared to other wheatwines that it's drinkability is by definition good or a bit higher."
"Had a couple bottles of this one, and it did not approach the greatness of the tap version, so I will adjust my score accordingly. The cloudy pour and sour orange flavor detract a bit from what was great about this one on tap."
"Bottle poured into new belgium tulip. Pours a blood orange red with a small white head that fades to a ring. Smell is very citrusy, with lots of sweetness and orange zest. Taste is slightly sour and acidic, with lots of bitter orange zest and antiseptic in the finish. Aftertaste is not pleasant, but other then that, this is a tasty beer. Mouthfeel is heavy with a light carbonation. Drinkability isnt great, but I havent had much different for the style."
"(D)- It does not exactly remind me of a wheatwine other than the underlying sweetness of it, bu it sure is tasty besides. I would put this as a fruit beer instead in my humble opinion, but I am torn since it really appeals to me due to my love of sours and such. A fun and dynamic beer though that I am enjoying very much; I am just not sold on the style it is in."
"D - You sip it. You drink one. You are over. The taste is so complex you don't want anything before it to muss up the taste buds, nor do you want (or need anything after)."
"Drinkability:This is an incredible and complex wheatwine with amazing orange flavors."
"D- Hit's the spot and goes down easy. A good summertime drink, though it wasn't really sessionable with the 11.7%ABV. Goes down very easy though. Almost a standalone drink. You don't need much else after it. Would maybe try a bit warmer next time. Perhaps after leaving out of the fridge for a half hour or so."
"D- Overall, the alcohol is hidden extraordinarily well and the sweetness isn't too rich. Drinks far too easily for the ABV."
"D - This another great beer from Shorts. You can dell it's a great execution, but I think the intent falls short. Worth a try if you can find it, and definitely an experience. Just not a amazing beer."
"A sipper but very enjoyable. Not something I would drink more than a couple, a couple would certainly be enough. It is unfortunate this is not a season, I would like to have this available on occasion. This beer just makes me shake my head, I do not know what to say besides its damn good."
"Really good stuff that I was glad to see on HopCat's bottle list. Well worth tracking a bottle down if you can."
"Not quite the winner I was expecting, but super glad to get to try it."
"Pours a clean, deep reddish color, with a small light tan head. In the aroma, orange zest, somewhat peppery and spicy wheat notes. In the taste, orange juice, quite spicy and a hint of alcohol. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry orange zest aftertaste. Big orange presence, almost difficult to finish due to ABV and citrus."
"A Blood Orange Wheat Wine sounded a little crazy when I first heard about this but the flavors all just worked very nicely for me here. I love that this didn't skip on the orange flavor and the addition of peppercorns really upped the zestiness of this to a new level. The finish was a little overly bitter IMHO but otherwise, this was pretty great stuff."
"M- I felt that this was much too thin and not carbonated enough. This is really the only glaring default I found with this beer."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the oranges and wheat. The flavor is blood oranges, wheat and alcohol. There is a little bit of tartness in the flavor, but not as much as you would get in a sour ale. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very good beer."
"Taste: Big juicy blood orange flavor. The green peppercorn are slightly offputting for me but it is still rather tasty."
"Overall this is gonna be a love it or hate it beer, an I loved it, really worked very well for me on nearly every level."
"3.5 D: I like Short's for their innovative brews. While they had a good idea here, it fell short due to the lack of maltiness (which is something I rarely suggest when considering barleywines). Still, it was worth the experience."
"This is @&$/(ing fantastic. It's a dry wheat ale (wheat wine) 11% abv with a sweet blood orange flavor up front and blood orange bitterness in the middle from zest. It finishes with a dry peppery spike to the tongue from green peppercorns. The hops are centennial and just on the nose. Quality brew  "
"This, fellow BAs, is a diamond in the rough. If you see this beer, buy it, chill it, let it sit for 20 minutes or so after pouring, and enjoy - you'll never try another beer like this again."
"D: This is a really large and interesting beer which I have had a couple of times now. But, with its aggressive spiciness, high a.b.v., and dry finish, I don't think this would be a 'drink often' beer for me."
"One is plenty, the aftertaste doesn't keep my interest for more. I like that this is original but the flavor doesn't quite do it for me."
"Overall Short's has fried my circuits once again, (in a good way). Very sweet and somewhat sour with lots of warm spices worming themselves through this hearty, jovial beast. As it warms, the clove finally spouts out. The green peppercorns can be a little heavy handed, but don't really rock the boat...or I should say 'battleship'. This is one big & burly ale with a big smile on it's shiny face. At least my face is grinning with a slight shine to it, now that my glass is empty."
"D: My expectations were far exceeded by this beer. Really is an absolute must try in my opinion. The 11.7% ABV is completely hidden, the flavor is wonderful, it's smooth, dangerously drinkable. I saw this on the shelf during a recent trip to Michigan, and debated whether or not to buy it, but am so glad I did."
"Overall, this wheatwine drinks like an IIPA. Very fresh hops and citrus profile. It is very good and drinks easily. I will have more of this one."
"I'm extremely pleased with this one and I really enjoyed what the blood oranges bring to the table. Big, complex brew. Not extremely drinkable but quite a sipper."
"D - With its sour, slightly alcoholic profile, it drinks a lot like a wine. Definitely a sipper, but a good one."
"D: At nearly 12%, this wheatwine is best enjoyed in short doses. I love the flavor, the citrus and blood orange. A worthy anniversary ale."
"D- It's a definite sipper. So complex and ""fun"" that I'm disappointed that I likely won't have a chance to try it again as it's a ""one off brew."" I'm pretty sure I got the last bottle at my local shop. The abv is the only thing holding me back from wanting to lock myself in my room with a sixpack. I have to give a shout out to one of my brewsday buddies for giving me a sample of this fine brew. I was pretty geeked to find my own bottle last week."
"Drinkability - A sipper for sure. What an interesting beer; granted what was I expecting from Short's? I am very thankful I was able to try this style and beer in general. Haven't had many beers really surprise me lately so needless to say I am happy this beer blew me away. The way the sweet orange and peppery spices mix, the dryness, tartness, alcohol warmth...everything just makes this beer complete. Well done Short's."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"A very delicious beer and an excellent way to celebrate their sixth year of production. Very good job, Shorts!"
"i want to try it aged but don't think i would have the discipline to do so.. yum"
"The flavor was smooth and insanely fruity, bursting with blood red orange, starting sweet and finishing tart. Some light spice follows you throughout this beer, mingling with acidity from the fruit, almost teasing you throughout your journey. There is a nice acidic finish and a buttery caramel flavor that lingers. It has a medium full body and light carbonation. Highly drinkable as a good night cap."
"D: Interesting, but quite nice. Just a touch too much pepper on the finish, but overall, easy to drink. Not sure if I'll hunt this out again, but glad I got to try this."
"Overall, the spicy flavors balance what would be an epically sweet beer, making it something new and unique. Excellent."
"Overall, very wine-like: Dry, tart, fruity and little carbonation. Not really my favorite style, but it follows form pretty well."
"Glad I got to taste this, but at the end of the day I found it to be just a little bit weird for my taste. It is dark amber with no head or lacing. Smells like oranges and mango and tastes like wheat and oranges. Very citrusy and odd; not very drinkable to me due to the syrupy mouthfeel and the odd citrus. Pretty good, but also weird, which makes sense for Short's."
"A very interesting beer that you won't find anywhere else. Definitely worth trying."
"Very drinkable."
"Great beer! I am impressed with the creativity of Short's brewery. They don't disappoint and I think they are always worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"D: Another cool beer from Shorts. I liked the addition of the fruit in this one and found it to be a bit sweet and at nearly 12% ABV, this is one that you need to drink with caution."
"Pours a deep red with a decent amount of carbonation in my tulip-shaped glass. Smells of blood oranges, soft cheese rind and rose water, but also a bit musty and metallic. The aroma gets much more complex and floral as the beer warms up to room temperature. Tastes tart with blood oranges melding with the hops in a peculiar way. Green peppercorn emerges towards the finish with ample bitterness. A touch metallic and tart. Slightly tannic in the finish when cold, but gets juicier with more peppery heat as it warms up. Surprisingly dry for a wheat wine and rather potent. Filtered with no yeast apparent. A very interesting beer that definitely gets better as it warms up to room temperature. Some of the individual flavors almost seemed offensive at colder temperatures, but as the warms up it's magic."
"Fruity tartness greets the tongue, along with a bit of peppery bitterness. Rhubarb and tart cherry pie follow, before a nice dollop of fruity sweetness. Strawberry, mandarin orange, and sweet cherry come through. Hints of toffee and banana bread sneak in along with some warming alcohol. Fruity tartness picks up near the finish. Woody, oaky bitterness in the finish with plenty of lingering fruit. Very nice. More tartness than expected, but it balances the sweetness nicely. Medium-full body with low carbonation for a smooth, flattish feel. Happy anniversary Shorts!"
"Drinkability- Not bad. Thank god I had help drinking this growler as there is no way I'd be able to put the whole thing down. Very tasty and super unique but two glasses were plenty. Thanks much Jeff!!"
"Fairly alcoholic, very unique and interesting."
"Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub, a wheatwhine with a lot of oranges and peppercorn. Dark brown and lacey. Full mouthfeel. Malty and licorice. Refreshing and how this would be amazing with a meal. Was fairly average in aroma, not as complex as expected. Had aged in bottle form, and was very rich, thanks Steve! same rating."
"All and All another very unique brew from Short's, but I had one glass at the Anniversary party and one this time as well and I don't think I could really drink anymore than that....its pretty strong. Now in all fairness I've had Joe's last 3 anniversary ales and all of them have been very very strong, but in the case of a double or triple IPA I think it works better than it does with this Wheatwine...still glad to try it and Congrats to Short's for 5 yeard and continued success!!"
"D- The high ABV limited me to only one of these, but I'm very glad I was able to try this beer, definitely a different experience."
"D-Outstanding, this would get another 5 if it wasn't for the alcohol tickle and the fact that the 11.8% ABV will surely kick you on your ass in no time! Happy 5th Anni to Joe and the entire Short's crew! Well done, well done indeed!"
"I enjoyed this beer on tap at the brewery. The brewery described this beer as a wheat wine and the description stated that they used a half a pound of blood oranges per gallon. This beer pours a ruby red color with a small head that quickly dissipates. The smell has a huge tropical aroma of grapefruit, pineapple and orange. The taste is incredibly sweet with grapefruit and orange flavors. The mouthfeel was relatively thick and nicely carbonated. Hands down the most interesting and complex beer I have had so far this year."
"Highly drinkable and very refreshing, Joe and crew again show they can work magic with the hops. Served with a blood orange if desired at the pub, which is a nice touch. This beer is certainly best enjoyed fresh, but I can't help but wonder what some age might do, if it would go barleywine like aorta has, and if some of the added spices might shine thru more strongly. Delicious, thanks Shorts!"
