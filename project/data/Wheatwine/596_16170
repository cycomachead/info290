4.1,3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22oz. bottle shared by EnfronCFO. 2010 vintage. Pours slightly lighter than cider in color with a loose head that dissipates into an oily skim and a bubbly band around the shoulders. Nose is sugary off the initial sniff, followed by wheat malt and a hint of ethanol. Cotton candy comes out as the brew warms. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a slight chemically aftertaste at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an oily texture and an even carbonation. Overall, this beer seems spot on for the style. I would recommend trying this beer both fresh and cellared. Another great beer from Portsmouth.","Jwale73","Apr 01, 2012"

The aroma has fruity esters mixing with wheat as well as a wine barrel like sense to it. barrel aged? The taste confirms as modestly tart and sour wine barrel notes start things off. Behind these notes are some sweet wheat malts mixing with tart tangerine like citrus hops and spicy hops. Interesting. It seems somewhat like Alesmith’s 2008 Decadence. I don’t know the vintage of the current bottle. It’s pretty good.","BigMcLargeHuge","Jan 25, 2012"

Smells of caramelized dark sugars, a bit of spice, some earth, light sweet citrus fruit, oranges and tangerines come to mind. The flavor is sweet and malty with lots of dark sugars and light fruits. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. This beer is miles ahead of the last time I had it. My score reflects this tasting.","johnnnniee","Jan 25, 2012"

The '09 had unfortunate similarities to the '10 Bare Tree from Two Brothers (although it wasn't nearly as awful). While the '10 is one of the better Portsmouth offerings I've had, it's not something I'd actively seek out or highly recommend.

3.5,-12.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very nice brown, pretty cloudy with a thin head and some lace. The smell is of blueberries a bit of vanilla and some heavier alcohols propanol for example. The taste is interesting, a bit sour almost more like a wild ale than a sweet wheat wine. The malt character is somewhat restrained I do notice a fair amount of caramel malt but it is pretty one dimensional and a bit syrupy. Bitterness seems to be limited only to the sourness and not really much from hops. The mouthfeel is pretty clean it does finish quite tingly and a little puckering. I'm not sure what is going on with this one. Perhaps I've got a bad bottle because it doesn't seem to match what others have said in their reviews. It is different and still enjoyable but not my favorite. Glad to get the chance to try it all the same.","fank2788","Oct 01, 2010"

Hints of alcohol were detectable, along with bits of wheaty grain. Taste was up front sweet, but not in a sugary syrupy sweet way. Spiciness tended to end the sip, maybe some pepper? Felt outstanding in the mouth. Coated very well, felt great in the mouth. Hid the alcohol nicely, but still a sipping beer. Extremely pleasant, mellow beer.","mountdew1","May 31, 2010"

The bourbon, brown sugar, candied fruit and slight maltiness in the aroma actually reminded me of a scotch ale. The taste was a little syrupy and a little boozey but was true to the smell, with noticeable yeast and sweet fruit and a nice caramel hint.

3.68,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I've never been disappointed with Portsmouth offerings...and I really mean never...but this one is a little off the mark. Not sure if there's a capping problem or an inherent flaw (or the toffee thing again), but something leaves this wanting quite a bit. Heft makes it tough to plunder through the whole bomber. Even after stopping this up with a wine stopper and re-opening, what I'm left with is a decent example for the style but not the excellence I'm used to from Portsmouth. For the weight class the flavor is a little too meek. Maybe there's not a capping/bottling issue, but the off-flavor, butter, toffee or butter toffee at least burned off after a while. Still, it's not too bad for mere mortals. As far as the pure question of ""how well it drinks," it drinks pretty well after breathing for quite a while.","IBUnit63","Jun 03, 2009"

It has a decent medium sized off-white head and goodly patchess of lace on this classic chalice served at the Portsmouth Brewery. The aroma is an intense, but tasteful butterscotch caramel, plain and true, very enticing. The taste brings strong malt sugars and hints of licorice and floral hops blended nicely into a full bodied, viscous, fair alcoholed brew of great distinction. Midland drinkability but normal for this style. Quite sweet, perhaps a bit much for the uninitiated. It definitly brings a red wine quality along with the tartness of cherries and the acrid contrast of grassy wheat. Quite a solid brew that deserves a try by anyone interested in the more intense varieties.","Durge","May 28, 2009"

Smells lightly of bubblegum and slightly sour wheat. Strangely enough, this tastes a bit like sake. Hot with alcohol with distinct soft rice grain flavors, a hint of banana, cherry, and clove.

4.52,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Was very happy to see a healthy carbonation during the pour. Retaining a beer's proper carbonation in a growler is a constant worry. The nose smells of caramel like a freshly unwrapped Werthers Original. Behind that is a very pronounced dried apricot. Some alcohol heat makes it into the aroma as well as some wheat and hop spice. At one time I believed this to be the same beer as Smuttynose Wheat Wine from the big beer series. They do have similar traits of apricot and alcohol heat. This beer however is much easier going down and the caramel nose is an added pleasure. During the pour there was a torrent of fine bubble carbonation leaving a 1/4 inch head which has since dissipated to a thin ring. The mouthfeel is that of a barley wine with high alcohol and light carbonation. Very enjoyable and very drinkable.","mshallah","Apr 06, 2008"
4.22,6,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This review comes from a growler purchased from the brewery. Pours a lively strawberry blond color, with a small white lacing. Smell is on the sweet side, with elements of cotton candy, toffee, kiwi, strawberry and banana. Taste is dominated by a lovely tart fruit flavor...sour apple and watermelon come to mind. Wheat and a dry husky grain note make themselves apparent in the aftertaste. Body of the beer is the highlight for me in that it seems so light and sessionable for a beer of this size abv wise. Although the alcohol catches up with you after a couple glasses, it is still highly drinkable. This is a real treat of a beer. I might go so far as to say that I like it better then the Smutty Wheat Wine, which would pretty much put it in the top slot among Wheat Wines for me. Cheers","jamie2dope","Apr 02, 2008"

4.25,6.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Copper color, tends toward clearish. Sudsy head, leaves rings on the glass but not a lot of lacing. Lurking aroma, not overt, lightly fruity and somewhat estery, reminds me most of candied citrons with a bit of other candy elements to it. Active and nicely done carbonation -- parses out the licorice and ginger flavors well, making it fun in its mouthfeel and letting the flavors play out in grand style. Finishes with a light bit of green leaves and even some cigar tobacco (the 70 IBUs asserting themselves?). A bit of alcohol comes through at the close. This is a very entertaining beer to drink.","ADR","Feb 01, 2005"
3.85,-3.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Ive been wanting to try Todd Motts Wheat Wine since he moved up to Portsmouth. On vacation about 5 years ago, I stopped by the Boston Beer and Fish company down town, and was blown away by his barleywine. This beer poured an amber color with a thick cream colored head. Mild hop aroma. There really wasnt much beyond the hops in the nose. A mild boozy character, but little else/ The head did leave a remarkably good lace for this style. Mildly boozy taste too. A sweetness comes to the front with some citrus hop character. Very slick mouth feel. Ok drinkability. This wasn't what I remembered from 5 years ago, but was still a decent beer.","carln26","Jan 15, 2005"
3.98,0,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured in what looked like a 10-ounce goblet. Lazy ruby red with golden tinges around the edges, striving to penetrate the crimson inside. Slight cream coating at top with a tight sheen. Berries (raspberry?), and alcohol at front, with a slight soapy character later, though not detracting in any way. Alcohol belies a low-level buzz throughout, with the malt just above the radar. Kumar eyed the goblet suspiciously and mumbled that he could swear there was some fruit in it, but if there was, I didnt think it made the ale any less drinkable. In fact, the mingling of the different profiles was excellent and Jim agreed by stating in his best Homer Simpson impression, Yummy. We agreed to have another, even Kumar.","Truh","Jun 21, 2004"
