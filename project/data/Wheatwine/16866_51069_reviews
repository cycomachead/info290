"Caramel, coconut, vanilla, alcohol on the nose. Pours hazy orangeamber under a 2"" moussey pure snow white head that produces excellent lace. Wonderful rich malt on the palate joined by caramel, fruit, banana, vanilla, coconut - the vanilla coconut banana thing is extreme and nicely done.  Very nice texture and body, medium to medium full with fine soft carbonation."
"Broke out a 2013 bottle for an epic bottleshare Friday evening. A confoundingly pleasant surprise! Light on the palate yet very complex, lots of bourbon aroma without overwhelming other elements, smooth despite its strength. This was one of the first BBA beers I tried (~6 years ago) and I didn't like it very much. Age, as well as change in my own palate, have served this one well."

"This drinks with a mellow bourbon tone, coconut cream pie, light citrus fruit, lemon sour, caramel malt, toffee and a subtle wheat malt. Not much heat for 11.5% and it's a bit spritzy. Very good one here, but that's what I expect from Bruery."

"My first Bruery beer. 2013 vintage. One of the  top five beers that I have had in the last calendar year. I have some difficulty ascribing the flavors; mild vanilla darkened a bit by light bourbon in the background, apples(?), mild sweetness yet a very mild tartness, a little caramel maybe?  This is a very, very good beer. A sipper to be enjoyed slowly with a good friend."
""
""
"As described, a rich and interesting beer. I'm not sure how I'll get through this bottle though, a lot of complexity and depth but I find the sweetness and alcohol on the high side. Not to say it isnt a very tasty and inspired beer, which it is, a lot of interesting things going on, but I think they are lessened by the strength and sweetness of this. Nevertheless, age has been good to this and it showed a good performance all around, a good balance struck between the two ales."
""
"Tasted after a year of aging. I do think this beer will develop in another 6 months and becomes even more complex."
"The one I tried had been cellared  1 years. I expect it to get even better with age."

"O: for some reason, I wasn't anticipating a light-colored beer here... mild shock but a pleasant surprise, as it certainly played into the interpretation of flavors... while it packs a decent punch, alcohol wise, it doesn't come across as heavy or filling... I feel they've made a fine wheat-ish beer here"

"A wonderful, quite special brew. Coconut, vanilla, Oak barrel wheat body. Quite shy on showing its high ABV. Very complex. Dangerously drinkable. The bruery at its best!"

"This is an interesting beer style.  The breadiness in both the aroma and flavor is new to me as a desirable characteristic but works well in this beer.  The alcohol is very well hidden but slowly sneaks up.  This is the first time I’ve tried it but it won’t be the last."

"Bright golden hued with vibrant carbonation and brilliant clarity. The head is easily an inch thick of tightly woven and off white in color. Light Brussels lacing. Aroma of oak and pale wheat when combined almost give off a dry cider like note. The flavor is an intense blend of oak and pale wheat,which, like the aroma,almost give a dry cider like flavor. There's a residual sweetness that lingers that I find a bit cloying. I believe the bourbon notes and the oak are clashing with the pale wheat. The palate is highly carbonated and slightly warm from the alcohol."
""
"I really enjoyed this one and it drank much lighter than I expected."
""
""
""
"Quite a gorgeous beer. Incredibly complex with lots of prickly carbonation despite the strength. Tart ripe apples and stone fruit covered in a light caramel glaze. Soft notes of oak and vanilla with just the right touch of bourbon. A delicate beer like this would be so easily overpowered but sweet bourbony notes come through just a bit on the back end and compliment some of the more savory and richer notes while letting some of the brighter fruit notes still shine. Complex, surprisingly lighter in body than expected. The wheat really creates an incredibly drinkable beer out of such a big one. Alcohol heat is noticeable on the back.end but provides balance to the intense flavors and drys out the finish. Finishes lingers long and is almost tannic in that it scrubs the gums. Very nice, and well worth the bottle cost."

"O: Full of character for sure, but it takes a while to get accustomed to it. Great clean apples supported by warm caramel malt tease the olfactory senses with a refreshing, crisp brew to come, but it turned into a heavily oak-dominated and deceivingly biting flavor. I ended up enjoying it overall, but after the first few sips I was reconsidering my choice. Get ready for an adventure with this one."
""
""
""
""
"Taste was similar to the nose – had a strong weizenbock/wheat flavor up front, and then the caramel, coconut, vanilla, and bourbon notes came in after the initial swallow. Heat from the 11.5 abv was pretty pronounced after the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was a little more carbonated than I had expected, but overall was a tasty beer, and would love to try more from this place. I expect great things from a brewery that call themselves 'The Bruery'. They live up to the name!"
""
""
""
"While enjoyable it would be better served with a strong cheese. It is remarkably similar to carbonated white wine, if there were such a thing."
""
""
"O- Nothing to seek out, but certainly worth a try if you can find it. I think the fullness of the feel is the best part."
""

"O Not bad, but I more than likely would not go out of my way to buy this again"

"Picked up bottle on clearance that was approaching best buy date. Great looking beer, not quite as murky as a wheat with good head that does not stick around long. Smell is awesome, hard to describe but wonderful. Taste was very interesting, could not compare it to anything. The boozy taste sticks around a little long from a guy who likes very big beers. Definitely more of a sipper, but a very good one with interesting taste. Very much enjoyed the beer and definitely worth trying as it is a bit unique"

"Overall: a huge disappointment as a barrel aged beer. also makes 2 of 3 breury beers that have let me down largely (the other was just good not great)"
""
""
"Medium body with prickly carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty nice. Opaque golden coloration, bubbly head, no real lacing. Nose is wine, yeast, funk, and booze. Buttery and yeasty, with hefty prominence of white wine grapes. Peaty and boozy, bitter and sweet, with a dry finish. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"Pours a light golden body, hints of orange, with decent head and lace. A funky, earthy aroma hits me and there's also some minor oakiness and sweetness as well. The oak helps keeps things balanced and smooth, as there is something akin to yeast that keeps the beer fluffy and lively and then some sour/tart citric flavors and then a finish of vanilla sweetness. The ABV is rather well hidden as the booziness and medicinal/barrel taste that some barrel aged beers have is vaguely there on backend as beer warms. A beer that is out there as it touches on but doesn't excel at one particular taste sensation but I really enjoyed it."
"Served in a snifter, a slightly hazy golden color with a surprisingly thick, creamy head that retained well and left some soapy lacing on the glass. Looked pretty nice. Aroma of toasted wheat and sweet malts, candi sugar, notes of stone fruit and coconut. This was pretty indicative of the taste, wheat and pale malts, fruity, peachy flavors, on the sweeter side, with a pretty big hit of fusel alcohol, no real bourbon or barrel notes, but a definite coconut sensation came through. Body was medium, mouthfeel was pretty thin, quite unexpectedly, but I guess it would have been less drinkable if it were a chewy full-blown malt bomb. Alcohol was present for sure, but actually it wasn't too hot. Not bad overall, but not great. I was glad to have it on tap instead of committing to a bomber."

"O: I declare this the Three Stooges of beerdom. All the flavors do is get jammed in a doorway, with the sugary sweetness poking the fruit esters in the eyes and bonking the oak barrel in the head. There's no way I could finish a whole 750 solo, which is why I split it with a couple friends. Don't need to ever have this one again...I really hope the bottle of Bois I'm sitting on isn't like this."

"O: I am not thrilled with the price on Bruery offerings, but I have really enjoyed a majority of them so far. This is no exception, as I really enjoyed it. For the abv, it is really quite drinkable and would pair well with a wide variety of foods. The bright Belgian crosses with the sweet barrel character nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The barrel comes on a bit strong, even after the 50/50 blend. That wheatwine must have really been a barrel bomb on its own. An interesting blend. It actually meshes quite well, though it still feels somewhat foreign and a little odd. It takes some getting used to, but it's a very thought provoking sipper indeed."
""
""
""
"Bottle from Dad, thanks Pop! Pours hazy dark yellow with a big fluffy white head. Aroma is light citrus, pear, apple, yeast funk, dry oak. Was expecting more sweetness on the nose given my experience with White Chocolate. Really smells like a Saison. Flavor is sweet honey apples, and alcohol presence but unexpectedly light bodied. Maybe a bit of vanilla. The alcohol presence doesn’t mend well here and is slightly offensive. No trace of the beer that I tasted in WC. Adequate carbonation that prickles the tongue. Dryish finish. A bit disappointed here."
""
""
"O: Overall a pretty solid beer. Reminds me of a farmhouse ale, (probably from the Mischief addition) as I seem to get those characteristics, along with the big bourbon presence. Not a bad beer, worth trying."
""
""
"Overall my introduction to The Bruery and its a tasty one. Havent had a blend like this and welcome the style with open arms. Wheat really makes this creamy and smooth allowing it to pack a lot of punch."
""
""
"It's still hard to justify its $30 price tag but I'm glad I can come out of this saying I thoroughly enjoyed my first beer from the Bruery. On paper, an 11.5% ABV wheatwine with half of it aged in bourbon barrels sounds like a defeating task to drink. Boozy with the sweetness from all of the malt needed to establish its alcohol content only added on to by the bourbon barrels. But that isn't the case. The high level of carbonation and Belgian forward characteristics help to make this not only enjoyable but drinkable as well. They did a fantastic job at making a potentially intense, very pronounced, boozy mother of a beer into one that is well rounded, soft, and delicate and I commend them for that. Sour in the Rye is next and I can't wait!"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, I've had better from the bruery. but I suppose they cant ALL be awesome.... I suppose it serves a purpose, and it is a different blend of style. still very drinkable, refreshing to a degree and high abv. mixed with a couple o' painkillers after surgery, i'm inclined to rate this one higher than deserved.... maybe...."
""
""
""
""
"Would be better with some age on it, I think. The present alcohol just gives the beer a boozy spiciness that's hard to get past. The other flavors are great, though, and would probably shine after a few years of rest."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber- orangish with a huge soapy off-white head that fades very slowly. Smell is citrusy, oak and Belgian yeast. Taste has a touch of tartness, some citrus and carmel. A little boozy but not overpowering, with just a hint of the barrel. Medium mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation and a little dry. Overall it is good, if you like wheat wines it's worth a try."
"O: the label speaks the truth! The bourbon is applied with subtlety, giving airs of wood and whiskey to the mix; lots of fruits for fans: tropical and orchard; citrus comes through, assisted by the hops (?), and the wheat provides some characteristic flavors and smells; this came across like a wheat tripel, bourbon barrel aged. Can't imagine not enjoying this."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 3/8/2013. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, banana, apricot, pear, pepper, clove, toffee, coconut, oak, bourbon, wheat, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big pineapple, apricot, pear, banana, clove, pepper, toffee, oak, bourbon, wheat, vanilla, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, light fruit, banana, clove, pepper, toffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla, wheat, candi sugar, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and barrel flavors; with a nice moderate barrel presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Moderate alcohol warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice blended wheat wine style. All around nice balance and complexity of yeast, malt, and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV despite the moderate warming on the finish. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting blended beer with a lot going on. Some of it gets lost and other areas dominate a little more then others. A ride for the palate though, glad I got to try it."
""
"Sometimes a big beer is just what is needed and it pours a clear yellow straw hue with a one finger head with no lacing but a subtle rim,the smell is bourbon,vanilla,booze and coconut,the mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of vanilla,coconut,caramel,booze,candy and is finished just like a fine white port with a touch of warming bourbon on the back of the palette and overall it's such a unique drop that toes the boundaries of wheat beer and wine and even though I've tried it and liked it I probably wouldn't fork out the big dollars on it again cheers."

"Overall: Not my cup of tea, but seeing as I'm not a big belgian fan, I think I'd prefer the original wheat wine instead of this blend with Mischief. Interesting, and oddly refreshing for such a big beer, but won't be buying it again."
""
""
"Overall, this is quite good, though quite strong."
""
""
"Overall: This was my first wheatwine, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this was really tasty. The bourbon barrel aging added nice additional complexity and really took this from a good beer to a really good beer. I would definitely get this again."

""

"10oz draft pour at Oblivion In Orlando. This is a wheat-wine aged in bourbon barrels blended with a Belgian-style golden ale. The taste has some fruitiness with vanilla and oak from the bourbon barrel aging with a dry and slightly spicy finish with a lingering warmth from the alcohol. Overall, this is a solid Wheatwine that is definitely worth a try! Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Phenomenal beer. Only aging half of it in the bourbon barrel was a great call, as I don't see the subtle notes of the wheat and yeast standing up to much more. Probably should have saved this brew to share with some one considering I don't think drinking the entire thing by yourself is very healthy. Going to grab another to cellar as I imagine this brew will be absolutely incredible with a few years."

"Like the best in the admittedly limited examples of this style that I've tried, White Oak possesses a heady wheat heft, aided and abetted by the elevated, and integrated ABV, an attendant fruitiness, and here, some overarching whisky barrel indoctrination. That's a good thing - oakey dokey, indeed!"
"O: a solid beer. I'm not exactly a fan of it but it has some good flavors. It's a bit too sweet in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
"I love barrel aged beers, but this has nothing to combat the barrel notes. Maybe a 75% Ale, 25% Barrel Aged Ale blend would suit this one better. Maybe age, maybe funk?"

"Overall for a Bourbon Barrel aged beer at 11.5% abv. this was a smooth & easy drinking beer."

"one of those beers that I liked but doubt I'll be dropping the cash to age a bottle or two even though I think it would improve drastically. I'm stoked to get The Bruery here in Alberta but so far I'm overspending."
""
""
"O - Good example of a style that's not typical for me nor one I've had a bunch of. I like the complexity and ease of drinking this."
"Overall- Sort of a letdown. I will need to search out other examples of this style. A 3.75 N 4 T 3.5 M 3.5 D 3.5"

"I've only had a couple of wheatwines so my opinion doesn't count for much here. I enjoyed this beer, but I'm not sure the high carbonation suits it well. It opens the palate and intensifies the flavors, where I found that a bit of degassing tends to smooth the beer and adds to the drinkability. After trying two of these barrel-aged (in this case, partially barrel-aged) wheatwines, I must confess I'm not entirely sold on the concept of a barrel-aged wheatwine. I'm not sure that the grainy, cereal-like qualities of the style are well complemented by the bourbon notes it inherits. I find the transition on the palate from soft wheat to harsh booze to be offputting at first, but who knows. It might be a taste I could acquire."

"O - Interesting combo that some thought went into."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25) a wonderful beer from The Bruery, which is probably good, given the cost of this particular 750. Brings to mind the feel of cognac or even moreso a strong brandy. If this was more available, I would definitely keep it around."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with minimal clarity and pillowy white head with heavy lacing. Nose has a strong presence of wheat and lemon. Bourbon notes come through and offer up some vanilla and oak. Taste is fruity and citrusy up front with more depth and complexity as it sits on the palate. Bourbon takes ahold by mid palate and some dry oaky notes on the finish. Alcohol Is relatively low key as it is overshadowed by orange and citrus. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. Overall, the citrus and wheat really take center stage here and overshadow the bourbon. Lots of bright fruit notes, almost forgot this was wheatwine."
""
""
"O: Beer that makes you think! Put all the flavors together and you get something that’s anything but conventional, a Belgian wheatwine with enough wood and fruit to make it unique. Even after I look at the empty bottle, I wonder if there’s anything inherently good about this beer that makes it special or if it’s just something different to a palate that demands something different. Though it isn’t a Sour in the Rye or an Orchard White, this beer is damn good – one that I’d buy again at a moment’s notice if it wasn’t almost a dollar an ounce."
""
""
"O - really enjoyed. Bourbon doesn't dominate. wheat/vanilla/coconut is balanced out really well. yes, finish is a bit boozy in the finish but real smooth. wish it was a bit more frothy. do recommend."
""
""
""
""
"o - overall a nice wheatwine. the bourbon and oak give a big sweetness. enjoyable, but a bit overly sweet and i tend to love sweet beers."
""
""
""
""
"Every time I have a Wheatwine my mouth says WTF? Lots of flavors that don't mesh nor go away! LOL!!! This one is even more over the top and if this is wrong to my tongue, I don't wanna be right! Certainly not something I would or could drink daily. This may get better and smooth out with age. I'll grab another bottle and let you know in a few years."
""
""
"Overall: White Oak is very good. It is certainly more interesting than most barleywines/wheatwines. That said, it is probably a bit too sweet and, though I try to ignore pricing in my reviews, I don't think I'd be willing to pay its fairly high price for a second pour or bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours golden with a solid quilt of light yellow foam; brilliant clarity. Smells like co2, pears, vanilla, some apple skin, some dandelion. Flavor is booze, sweet malt, sweet vanilla, some bourbon, some oak, some more pear and honeydew. Full bodied with moderately hi carb and a semi dry finish. Meh, tastes more like an old ale than a wheatwine, and although I'm not a wheatwine fan on most occassions, this one isn't at the top of that list. I think it will age gracefully however. A little sweet and a little too much pear for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting brew. It reminds me of a wheat beer just taken up a few notches: heavier mouth-feel, more flavor, stronger aroma. I don't get the impression that any of this was aged in bourbon barrels, like the label says that it was, which is interesting. Definitely a lot going on in this one."

"Overall. A decent and big wheat beer with a bit of that hefe flavour going on. Not really my thing but it's not terrible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A huge, boozy, dynamic, well balanced and well blended beer. Very unique stuff, as usual from The Bruery. I think this beer will only get more refined with age. I'm definitely looking to aging some bottles of this, just to see how it develops. Highly recommended for someone who is looking to try a bourbon barrel aged beer that isn't a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Fascinating combination of flavors. Not convinced it works all that well, but only the booze is offensive. The rest of it is just a crazy big wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very interesting mix of flavors, but very well balanced and complex."
" The complex light dessert flavors really complement the alcohol in a beer that seems refined and is both complex and delicate."

"This is maybe my third time with this beer, and I have always been equally impressed with it each time. A great example of how barrel-aging needs to evolve, with a careful touch of blending and a remarkable balance that brings out a deeper flavor to the palate. I will be buying this again...highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting beer, well balanced and hit on all cylinders"
"D: This was nice and refined and complex. Well executed version of a difficult style, with nice scent and taste and body. It seemed like it could age really well, but it was also very good fresh."

"750 ml bottle poured into a Gouden Carolus chalice. Thanks Cheesemoose! White, frothy head, high retention on a hazy golden body. Soapy, sudsy lacing, sticky. Aroma includes sweet fruits, banana, percimmon, a pleasant tartness and a hint of vanilla. Taste includes candi sugar, slight tartness, slight alcohol, some coconut as advertised. All the flavored work well together and the beer is delicious and highly drinkable for a high abv."

"O - the complexity of the flavors is tasty; the mouthfeel isn't spectacular, at least not up-front; I dig what's going on here with all the flavor, but having recently had WC, this falls short...and I hate to compare the two, but I believe the base beers are the same; despite all that, this is a tasty beer with the Belgian sugars and other flavors coming through nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not sure what to think of this beer, maybe a little age would help this, a little expensive for what I got out of it, I might come back to this later"

"[O] While high gravity wheat beers don't really make sense to me, I actually think this would have been a pretty decent beer...sans the bourbon barrel treatment. The Bruery's website describes White Oak as: ""50% wheatwine aged in Bourbon barrels...and 50% Mischief (our Golden Strong Ale)..."" - now, things are starting to make sense."
""
"This one really surges with booze after a while and it's not exactly easy drinking. Medium body and carbonation, slightly sticky, fruity and hot finish. Pretty wild. I probably would have preferred to split this three, rather than two, ways."
""
""
""
""
"I poured from a bomber into a tulip, hazy yellow pour, plus sized white head. The aroma was kinda weak, slight bourbon notes. The beer has some bourbon notes, bannana, very light clove, lingering finish. The body and carbonation are medium, no noticeable alcohol. IMO a dissapointment, there are much better wheatwines available for a lesser price."
"White Oak is a pretty impressive beer. I was skeptical. For such a big beer, it is rather mild mannered and is definitely tasty. Perhaps three years has taken some of the edge off. Tough to say. It’s good stuff. The nose needs work, but it performs well in all other respects. Easy recommendation."
"D - More of a tripel than a wheat wine to my taste, but it works well with the subtle barrel character."
"Overall: surprisingly drinkable for the ABV which is very well hidden. The degree of carbonation probably helps."
""
"This is an awesome beer. Smelling it I thought ""Oh crap, this is just gonna be a shitty wheat ale, and I HATE wheat ales :("" but the taste is soooo different. The bourbon barrel dominates in such an awesome way. I'd drink this every day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer for certain occasions. Would make a great winter warmer. Very complex with touches of sweet,slightl sour and woody notes. Will definitely cellar one and see how it ages."
"Poured into an overized wine glass a hazed orange infused copper color with a thin white head atop.Alot of hot booze in the nose along with heavy yeast esters,lingering vanilla and a hint of spiced pears.Really hot at first,it took a few swallows for it to tone down enough for me,vanilla and alot of yeasty notes,faint drying and toasted oak in the finish.A little hot for my liking,it has some rich flavors but they are masked a little by the yeast and big alcohol in my opinion."
"O- Tastes a little hot, but I though Mischief was very hot when I tried it too. Complex flavors and drinkable for a 11.5% abv beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma is pretty boozy with distinct notes of bourbon and some sweet caramel malt notes. Taste is a pretty complex mix of light fruity ester with some dominant bourbon notes with some woody notes and light bubblegum notes. Body is pretty full with good carbonation and the alcohol is quite apparent. Interesting exercise with good idea of blending different beers but a bit too strong on the bourbon at the end of the day."
""
""
""
"The nose is deceiving. This is a bourbon forward beer. The underlying beer is good but doesn't hold up to the huge woody, earthy, bourbon flavors. It is a complex beer, but the overall product needs balance. In the end, it is a bit unique so in my book it's worth trying."
""
"O: An interesting experience for sure. A well-made beer that is extremely complex. But not something I'll come running back to, especially with a price tag near $20."
"Nothing like finishing a day on the town with a beer on the train ride home. This case-in-point pours a lightly hazy orange-gold topped by a finger if lightly cream-white foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, vanilla, buttercream, light bourbon, oak, orange glaze, and banana. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the barrel is coming through a bit more powerfully, the caramel and vanilla have melded into a beautiful embrace of sweetness, the orange is joined by light pineapple and even lighter papaya, and some molasses sneaks in for good measure. A light booziness provides a bit of alcoholic heat, enough to allow you to feel it, but not enough to detract from the surrounding tastiness. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a damn fine wheatwine, the best I've had from the style in an awfully long time."
""
""
""
"Full body, slightly higher carbonation, chewy, sticky and lingering on the tongue. This beer definitely excels when it rises toward room temperature, but it doesn't quite reach the benchmark that many of the other barrel-aged Bruery beers have set."
"O: This is very drinkable for its strength. Not mind-blowing, but somewhat tasty."
""
"definitely the best wheatwine ive ever had. this is so complex and different. it pours a pale yellow almost white color, with a playful head a couple inches tall and bone white. the nose is a little heavy on the bourbon, but theres a lot of funky yeast, new fresh oak, and hefty wheat malts. oh yeah, and plenty of booze. the flavor is great, wildly complex. starchy oak notes first, sappy but not sweet, like a freshly milled tree, not some old decaying barrel. the what malt is strong for its color, really robust biscuity notes, and some vanilla from the bourbon in the finish. the booze doesnt taste as strong is it smells, but boy can you feel it. one bottle of this is goodnight. mouthfeel is great. vibrant carbonation and a little acidity in the mouth. almost has the feel of a sour, but it isnt. the body is medium, lighter than other wheatwines ive had. its scary drinkable, and easy to do because theres so much going on. one of the better beers ive had this month."
""
""
"A fine wheatwine, particularly as it warms and the overdone carbonation fades. I'm pretty sure my second bottle is going to be awesome in another year or so."
""
"Pours a hazy gold with amber accents capped with a two finger bright white foamy head. Very good retention, limited amount of splotchy lacing on the glass. The aroma of toasted coconut, vanilla, and a very understated hint of oak on the nose. The taste follows the nose initially coconut and vanilla are both present joined by mild hints of ripe fruit and caramel. Finishes crisp, clean, and dry with a very mild hint of oaky bourbon and medicinal alcohol. Medium bodied with fairly effervescent carbonation. There was a lot about this brew that was unexpected including it's lighter body. Also, there was little overt evdience of barrel aging as it is much more subtle. The crispness of the finish was very pleasing along with many other subtle complexities."
""
""
"M: Medium leading to full. Big."
"I really expected this to be darker and take on some kind of chocolate or toffee character, but this beer stays pretty true to its Wheat roots. However, the bourbon really overtakes it at times. Pretty easy drinking for 11.5%."
"Wowza... Big, brash, and boozy. I don't know if I would cellar it though because the hops are still shining through quite brightly...Maybe so."
""
""
"Mid bodied, a fair amount of carbonation, but not quite creamy. Alcohol shows with a heavy warmth, could be much better hidden. Barrel aging is extreamely subtle. Certainly a descent enough beer, but another Bruery beer I wouldn't bother with again, especially at the price point."
""
""
""
""
"4.0 D: I am a bit surprised how much I like this considering I think Mischief sucks balls. Still, I can't help but think the wheatwine itself is probably a hell of a lot better. (I guess I can find out somewhat when I get my White Chocolates). In any case, not bad and worth a try."

"750 ml bottle, 2012 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a couple inch off-white head. The head stayed around a while, and there's a good amount of lacing. It smells like oak, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, bready malt, and a bit of peppery spice and banana. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like caramel, oak, vanilla, bourbon, citrus peel, peppery spice, and a bit of pear. The bourbon is more noticeable as the beer warms up more. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky and coating, and is well carbonated. For an 11.5% ABV beer, I thought the alcohol was well hidden. I like this brew a lot, I'd buy it again. $17.99 a bottle."

"D - A bit boozy and heavy on the whiskey/oak aspect."
""
""
""
"O - Not really sure what to make of this one. I wouldn't seek it out, but it does have some good things going on, including a pretty good flavor."
""
"O- Wow, I'm a HUGE Bruery fan, but this is by far the most displeasing entry I've had from them. I've had good wheatwines before too (Smuttynose does a good one, for example). Hopefully this is one that absolutely needs to be cellared because, otherwise, it's just a hot mess."
""
""
"Tart up front getting smoother late/ Warming throughout. Full-bodied. Good though the aged part doesn't really seem to be too prevalent. The oak is nice, not overpowering like is some beers but a solid partner to the other flavors. Very nice overall and certainly better after it warms."
""
""
"I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. Belgian yeast complements the base beer nicely. A little too all around boozy and got sweet at times, but a solid beer."
""

""

"I love wheatwines but they tend to be on two ends of a fault line: delicious or bland, with little in between. This one, unfortunately, leans towards the latter. Odd to wish a Bruery beer was more extreme but, well, I do. Pretty good."
"Slightly above medium bodied with a lively, sharp carbonation."
""
"O: This beer is pretty good. It's a little too boozy for my liking, but the nose is nice and the flavor transitions work well. Solid beer. I'd drink this again."
"Overall a solid barrel-aged wheatwine. A little heavy-handed w/ the bourbon though and I still prefer Harvest Dance, and not only because it costs half as much."
"overall, this beer has a really nice barrel presence that I really enjoy. Why am I feeling pretty buzzed after drinking the majority of this bottle over multiple hours- oh yea its 11.5%- its becoming a bit much to finish this bottle off by myself, and the alcohol content is becoming a bit more apparent the further i get into the bottle but it is still enjoyable. Overall a nice, big beer with a great barrel presence that doesn't go too overboard. The high abv and large format detracts slightly here."
"Barely energetic pour fills half the glass with wispy off-white foam, luckily it is so airy and whipped up that it dissipates quickly to a thin if consistent surface coating, as might be expected not much stick in the lacing, what might be there. Super-cloudy orange which lightens at the outer edges, even given its opacity you can see a maelstrom of bubbles whipping around inside the glass, has a relaxed feel about it. The nose displays an initial burst of wheat and then lemongrass, follows up with honey, vanilla bean, caramel, grape skins and some coal and earth, gives up a bushel of peach, apricot, pear fruit scents with a little mixed sweet citrus on top, overall most notable for its restraint even as it openly offers the benefits of the barrel aging. Full-bodied, sweet yet with a sour side as well. Here banana and bubblegum comes through along with wheatgerm, mild sous bois and then that honey and lees. The orange peel is clearer, hint of a poached fruit character to the peach, apricot, pear, pineapple and apple fruit. It is damn foamy, the increasing dryness through the finish helps temper this. Interesting for how you sense its complexity but can’t quite tease them apart. The oak influence is moderate and not dominant. Creaminess helps it hug the palate and last longer."
""
""
"O-This is an intense beer that I recommend you share. It's another beautiful beer from the Bruery. It's unique and complex, but it's slightly more serious and strong than most other Bruery beers I've had. It is the best wheat wine I've had."
""
"Overall - A great big beer, lots of flavor, complex and unique. The coconut flavor is really good, as is the floral fruits. This is a intense drink, something id drink on occassion, not all the time. Worth a drink for sure."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a large white head. The aroma has a lot of wheat in it, as well as some pepper and bubblegum notes. The flavor is similar but more complex. I get a lot of wheat, as well as a big dose of alcohol up front. I also get some pepper notes, as well as a very light amount of whiskey and some Belgian yeast. The oak is very strong in the beer and really is what this beer is all about, which I guess you can expect given the beer's name. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
"Big white head sits atop a slightly opaque orange body. Smell is sweet.. Hints of coconut and spice. The taste is really well balanced.. Citrus, noticeable wheat, spice and yeast. The oak yields some coconut and vanilla, very nice fit. This is a great blend of beers here, if you've had mischief in the past you'll notice that as well. Glad I grabbed 2 of these.. Looking to save the other for cooler weather."
""
"O: Interesting experiment. I can't say it blew me away, but it was definitely above average. The bourbon didn't take the beer over, but simply imparted some really nice characteristics to an already interesting style."
""
"I like many of the Bruery's barrel treatments even more than this, but I greatly enjoyed this beer."
"O: I really liked this beer but I would rather drink Curieux I think instead."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was surprised, I liked this quite a bit. Wheatwine is a style that is very underrepresented in my opinion. It's nice to find one that's not too expensive, easy to find, and quite delicious."
"Complex and mellow, may or may not be worth the price."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking cloudy yellow color with a nice looking white head on top. The head settles and just leaves a thin white ring around the glass. The smell of the beer is boozy and sweet, lots of grainy aromas in there too. The taste of the beer is sweet and had a nice amount of wheat flavors upfront, it fades into a slight bitterness that finishes with a subtle sweetness from the barrel aging. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, it's got a low carbonation to it. It's not overly heavy for the ABV. Overall I thought this was a really good brew. I'd like to try it again sometime."
""
"O - This bottle wasn't cheap, so I don't know how many more I will pick up, but I was very happy to have tried one!"
""
""
""
""
"This is medium to full bodied, with a full mouthfeel. This is a slow sipper. This one isn't bad, but the barrel flavors seem compromised, and the wheatwine flavors are a bit harsh at times; keeping this from being really great."
"This one is pretty solid. Really enjoyable."
"...from Bruery Provisions in Orange, CA) White Oak - good Christ. Citrus, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, Belgian yeast, spice, green peppercorn, and tropical fruit notes highlighted with papaya. Medium full bodied, peaches resounding, and reminding me of southern comfort in a way. Some heat of abv is evident but enjoyable under the circumstances. A sipper to enjoy after dinner. In their words, ""oakey-dokey!"""
"White Oak pours a lighter bodied, slightly cloudy honey gold with a two finger bright white head. The nose is odd, a lot of slicing and alcohol with slight Belgian yeast and chamomile and other herbal notes. The flavors are odd. It's a weird mix of Belgian yeast, intense slicing, alcohol, and unripe vegetables. It's almost a super spiced wheat with a lot of alcohol and fresh green veggies. I cant get behind it. It's awkward, its boozy, its just not well integrated and is pretty disjointed. This is one of the few beers I can't like from the Bruery."
"O: Very enjoyable and an interesting blend of styles that make up this beer. I think bourbon barrel aging added a lot to this beer and the contribution of coconut was unique. Definitely one to try again."
""
"O: This beer is an interesting mix of beers (half wheatwhine aged in bourbon barrels and half Mischief)"
""
""
""
"The beer is good, but not something I'd pay $16 for again honestly. Worth a try."
""
"M/D - medium bodied with a high amount of carbonation. It sort of has a syrupy mouthfeel to it and that detracts a little. It really reminds me of a spruce ale I brewed. I like it, not sure i'd go for another bottle on my own though."
""
"Poured from a 750, very frothy head with golden color and dense carbonation. Smell was mostly of bourbon barrel, with some vanilla? Taset was heavy on the bourbob, not my favorite. Also sweet and fairly alcoholic. This should be served in 2 or 4 oz. size for me, as that's plenty. Not a refreshing or tasty beer. Mouthfeel was fine, but the taste missed for me."

"O - The first wheat wine I've ever had, and really an enjoyable one. One of the easiest drinking high abv beers I've had. Bourbon goodness in a lighter colored beer."
"I am not normally a fan of wheatwines, but I am really enjoying this one. By far the best example of the style I have had."
"Overall: This is a sweet beer with a lot going on, and that big ABV would throw your thoughts straight to the hopper if you drink too much and try to think about it. Moderation is certainly key with this bad boy, but I'll say i again, The Bruery has certainly come though."

"I love my ales as much as I love my Belgians, and I have to say, this has been a good competitor on what I think is one of the best beers I've had. A great experience for me, I made a trade with my friend for this bottle. I would advise anyone who has a limited chance at getting their hands on a year aged bottle, to go for it."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. A decent sipper that seems like something is going on with it. Not really what I expected for a barrel aged wheatwine but wasnt horrible either."
"O: My first bourbon-barrel wheatwine. It's not too bad, I feel like the bourbon doesn't really work with the wheatwine though. Just not complimentary flavors. It's decent enough and drinkable and unique but it really didn't suit my style."
""
"O: I really tried to get into this one, the bruery is one of my favs especially when it comes to sours and over the top extreme IMp stouts aged in barrels.... However the yeast flavors and the high carbonation kinda ruined it for me.... Maybe I'm a year or so when the whole thing mellows out the barrel character will shine more and the yeast and carbonation might calm down a bit."
"Overall it was a decent beer, but not one that really stands out. It felt over carbonated, over spiced, and lacked much barrel presence for being partially barrel aged."
"Gotta admit I’m a little let down by this one. Wheatwines are good; barrel-aged wheatwines even better. But White Oak is just too solvent and lacks the creamy body I expect from the style. Too bad."
""
"An enjoyable beer, but the booze really dominates at times. Once it cools off I think this will improve greatly."
"O: What a train wreck of a beer. This isn't anywhere close to good. It feels lazy and uninspired, and it disappoints in most every facet. Do your palate a favor and introduce Mr. White Oak to Ms. Drain, pronto."
""
""
"O: Overall a very interesting beer. This is one of those brews that each time you put it to your lips you taste something a little different from the last sip. Very interesting indeed."
"O - This was not what I expected but still very good. I am very interested to see what some age does to this."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty complex beer, but surprisingly, it didn't wow me. It has a heck of a lot going on, broad and deep, but nothing that captivated me. Loads of strong, solid flavors."
"Pretty good wheatwine. Strong alcoholic notes but that get tempered by some fruit juice notes and some wheat notes as well."
"At 11.5% this is boozy, but not burning. Pretty good beer. May go well with a salad up front."
""
""
"This beer is tasty... very tasty... just want less carbonation is all."
"Overall: Too much alcohol, not really that complex or enjoyable"

"A bunch of different flavor notes but none of them excellent. Carbonation is too sharp."
""
""
""
""
"D - Undoubtedly the strangest beer I've had from the Bruery yet. There are a lot of different elements within the aroma and taste, but I find them to clash rather the meld/blend. Ultimately that makes this pretty poor for drinkability, imo."
""
""
""
""
"D+"
""
"Overall meh, not what I expected, way too much booze and carb, feels thin, its like they made a Belgian tripel strong ale and tried to do a bunch of things with it that didn't pan out well, and just got way too boozy and carbonated, and where the hell is the bourbon, where they fifteenth fill barrels?"
""
"O - Overall what the heck did I buy? Its such a jumble of flavours and is all kinda thin and faint. Had such high expectations for this beer and it was dashed wonderfully by a crummy flavour. Argh."
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a huge bone white head and a steady stream of carb bubbles rising from the depths. Smells of spicy wheat, yeasty phenols, a bit of oak and bourbon with a hint of fruity sour sweetness. This tastes much better than it smells. Dark fruity sugary sweetness up front. Lots of berries and caramel followed by a bit of barrel oak, vanilla and a touch of alcohol. There's a spicy earthy sweetness that turns into a long lingering heat in the finish. Medium to full body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly sugary mouthfeel. I liked this one, but the carbonation might be a bit high and the alcohol is still a bit too present. Too bad I don't have another of these as it would be interesting to see how this ages."
"Well who knew that this was distributed in my area? Probably a lot of people but now me. Completely opaque and hazy, bright golden yellow in color with sligh orange highlights. One finger lightly dense head with just ok retention. Aroma is chock full of coconut, and big on raw oak. Some vanilla and caramel and a little bit of hops a hint of solventy alcohol, but the aforementioned flavors are the main players. The flavor is big on fresh cut oak and coconut. Some vanilla along with a touch of pine and citrus notes from the hops. There is a distinct tropical nature to this beer. Pretty abundent alcohol flavor on the back end. Pretty huge body, thick, full, and round. I love the Bruery and seek there beers out when possible so I was really happy to have this, but I won't be seeking it out again. To much alcohol, and could use some additional blending so smooth out the divergent flavors."

"O: this is a very nice representation of the style, nice taste notes and depth, really drinks incredibly well for an 11.5% number on it, quite happy with this offering from the bruery"

"DOA"

"Appearance is a cloudy yellow tone with a short white head. Its` nose has vanilla, oak and coconut. A very interesting smell complex to be sure. The taste contains orange, wheat, more of the oak and a strong punch of bourbon....mmm, sip this one. Mouthfeel is med-full, quite a bit of alcohol bite in the finish. The ABV here is not well-masked, but that is fine by me. I very much enjoyed White Oak and had been looking out for it. For me, it did not disappoint."
""
""
""
"Flavor could stand to be more aggressive and forward, but overall, a very nice and well thought out brew. Another great offering from Famille Rue! Recommended and worth *some* hype, but over priced at $18/750ml. I have two more and can't wait to report back once some age has been put on them..."
"O: I was hoping this would be something awesome like Nemesis 2009 but apparently blending this with Mischief has turned this into a belgian farmhouse beer instead of a wheatwine. I would love to try the pure barrel aged version of White Sap as I feel it could be more of what I am looking for."
""
""
"poured from aprox 22 oz. bottle into tulip shaped pint glass.... nice initial head but soon disapates with no lacing.... reminds me of an oak aged saison/farmhouse ale... if i was blindfolded i would have bet it was brewed @ ommegang brewery... which in my opinion is a huge compliment...OMMEGANG RULES... a little pricey @ $16.99, but i would buy this again on occasion... very good stuff... but very little bourbon character... a little hot @ 11.5% ABV, but i like that..."
""
"Pours a clear amber with a light bourbon smell and no sediment. The beer has a light, sweet taste that carries the bourbon well. It's very well balanced and drinkable, but doesn't wow me in he end. I would say for notes of bourbon, for someone that's not used to BA beers, this may change their ways. The fruitiness in the aftertaste is quite refreshing as well and makes this beer a winner!"
"White Oak pours a hazy, slightly dull tangerine. More than three fingers of white foam coalesce atop the beer, and the head displays very good retention. Lacing is fairly spotty though. There's a lot going on in the nose, though nothing's there that i would call a focus, or centerpiece. Notes of coconut, bourbon, oak, fruity booziness, and vanilla all blend together, without anything establishing itself as the primary aroma. The flavor is just a little bit more boozy, with the alcohol soaked fruit and bourbon notes taking over somewhat, and any coconut from the nose being lost. The body is surprisingly light for more than an 11% beer, and it's paired with an overactive carbonation that leaves the beer coming across as way too effervescent for what should be a malt driven beer. White Oak is an alright tasting beer that doesn't rank as one of the Bruery's best offerings."

"Pours a murky honey orange with an off-white head that fades to oily wisps on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is very grainy and fruity with some woody aromas. Taste is of grain, fruits, wood, and subtle bourbon flavors. There is a slight tartness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but the barrel aging is very subtle and comes out more in the aftertaste."

"2012 Vintage. Pours a very hazy, golden-orange color with a large white head that goes down rather slowly. Pours very nicely. Scent is initially hoppy with some Belgian yeast aromas. Sweet coconut with spicy aromas...Very unique nose on this one. Vanilla and oak make their way to the nostrils...the oak is quite pleasant as it warms. Lots of citrus as well...orange peel, lemon, etc. Subtle bourbon. Quite the complex smelling brew we have here. Taste initially remind me of Mischief...you get that bold, spicy, hoppy, bright citrus flavor...but then it smoothly transforms to oaky coconut and caramel flavors. Sweet vanilla and bourbon...wow...just phenomenal flavors here. Finishes with a bit more citrus...somewhat bitter. A bit of alcohol as well. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Smooth and creamy. Drinkability is very high, as I cannot believe this is 11.5%. Overall, such an amazing beer. I bought my full allocation of 5 bottles. I will gladly buy 5 more if I get the chance to head to Orange before it is sold out."

"Overall this was a really great, unique great beer. The flavor profile reminds me a lot how the Cascade Bourbonic Plague beer progressed as you drank it. Started off with predominant light fruitiness, bordering sourness, then as it warms you get a nice oak and light Bourbon presence. The 50% barrel aging was perfect for this because there aren't many (or any) that can hold up to the complete Bourbon Barrel treatment. Not sure what this was like fresh, but it is perfect right now. Kinda wished I saved this for slightly warmer weather but I was too anxious to try it. Definitely the best Wheat Wines I have ever had hands down. I heard there's a new batch coming out this year (2012) so definitely seek it out then as it is probably quite hard to come by now."

"O - It's great after 2 years of cellaring. I want more."
"D - This would be alright if it was solid in 6oz nip bottles, and split two ways. Pretty tough to drink more than a few ounces."
"O - Different, but I really loved this one. I would go for this one again."
"Overall: As the temerature increases the burbony/caramel flavors inceras, with the caramel, apply flavors taking a back seat. Overall, a very satisfying beer."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, subtle sweet alcohol, mango, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, fruit, and mango. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one was a little out of place with the other 44 brews that were cracked open as they were ALL sours (except for one or two others). This was a nice palate refresher and definitely was quite well received with the group. The fruit aspect going on here was quite nice and seemed to work well with the woody character I picked up on. The aroma let you know this one was going to be a heavy hitter, but there was no sign of this in the flavor at all. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity!"
"Drink- This was very unique with the flavor profile. I am very glad I got to try this one. It struck me as a beer that could go underappreciated."
"Overall is amazing and I'm really excited to have got to try this beer."
"I'd recommend this one around the holiday, but on a warm spring day, it didn't hit the spot for me. There are so many other great beers from this brewery that I will likely not seek this out again, but I commend them for producing this one."
"O: I don't think I've had this particular combination of flavors before. I liked it, but the flavors were a bit disjointed, and I think another six months may help them to meld together more."
"O: A bit too strong in the booze department for me. Interesting beer, but not something I'd care to drink a lot of."
"Medium bodied with very tight carbonation up front that is immediately countered by a blast of bourbon and burnt wood that overpower almost everything and lingers throughout into a very hot, burning finish. The barrel character is way too strong in this beer creating an overly hot, boozy, astringent mess. Lots of earthy oak and hot bourbon flavor with a decent bit of vanilla flavor that surprisingly doesn't mellow things out much at all. Underneath all of the heat there is a slightly creamy presence with hints of crisp light fruit and zesty, peppery spice. This beer is not very well balanced and is kind of an abrasive assault on the palate. It doesn't taste very good and is tough to choke down. It improves a bit as it warms but it is still a one dimensional failure."
"D: definitely a sipper due to the ABV but was really tasty and was digging the variation of flavors going on. Glad I got to grab another bottle of this brew."
"Beer is medium in body and relatively easy to drink. Its mildly dry on the back end and the forward is a little sweet. The midpalate region is mostly estery and bready. Its a pretty drinkable and decent beer."
"Pours a light caramel color with a nice, light off white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose really brings nice notes forward and I really like the oak characteristics. Some light bread notes as well. The taste and mouthfeel combine quite well, bringing down some really nice, creamy oak as well as light caramel and bread. Really digging the mouthfeel. Drinks quite well overall and was a nice treat."
"A unique and complex flavor profile going on here. Oaky tannic notes and white grape are prominent up front, then some spicy, Belgian yeast and candy sugar move forward. The 11.5% abv is present in some sharp black pepper notes, but no boozyness. Prickly carbonation throughout."
"On the taste, boozy and spicy bourbon assault the palate yet not exhibiting fusel alcohol harshness; quite a plus. Angel food cake and marshmallow middle. Essentially after the dominating aspect of the bourbon is looked past, the malt body is quite mellow and lightly sweet. Finish is a touch hot but more on the pleasant warming side with a very enjoyable tongue coating texture. Additionally it ends a touch dry and tart. Robust with respect to the bourbon quality and yet drinkable; solid."
"Surprisingly drinkable. Alcohol is barely noticeable. 4.5"
"This is a great beer, well done Bruery. This one is dangerously drinkable with a high ABV. Don't pass up the chance to drink this one."
"D - Easily my favorite Bruery beer to date. White Oak incorporates sweet, woody and hoppy elements to create a complex and flavorful ale that is pretty damn drinkable for an 11% Strong Ale."
"D: I really enjoyed White Oak, from the first vanilla notes to the last of the bubbles."
"O: This is pretty tasty. Given the high alcohol, one would think that it would be a chore to go through a bottle, but I've gone through two glasses and am looking forward to a third."
"Hugely carbonated, pouring this one into a snifter results in a good 3-4 fingers of rocky white foam, floating upon the dark straw colored brew. Nosing the beer, I get apricots, tropical fruits, wheat, vanilla and oak. Upon tasting the beer for the first time, I get a very complex blend of vanilla, oak, caramel, white pepper and soothing, warming alcohol. An outstanding blend and a great beer. Probably my favorite from the Bruery so far."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and fairly light. it hides its alcohol pretty well. tasty and delicious."
" Overall, a very good beer and a style I would like to see more of and become more familiar with."
"Quite a unique beer. I really like what the Bruery. They not only make good beer, but also continue to push what beer can be."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, a bit of warmth but goes down pretty easy for its weight. Thanks Eric!"
"Very high carbonation, good body with it's great crispness. Pretty drinkable, though nothing to get too excited about."
"Not really bad (in fact, still pretty good) but with all the Bruery beer we had this one was kinda ""meh"" for me, a bit of a mess that perhaps would integrate better with some time."
"Pretty tasty!"
"Thanks again Eric... I would buy a few of these if we got them into town.. but I doubt I would open one for at least a year."
"A good beer that is very drinkable for the abv."
"D: Takes a hit from the noticeable alcohol, but still pretty drinkable for an 11.5% beer."
"Overall, a decent beer. It is very interesting for the style. It is drinkable, but going down slower than some. I like it."
"This is a great beer, as the light barrel notes make this one unique and very enjoyable. Thanks Ben for breaking this one out."
"d - Overall I really enjoyed this pale ale. I thought the vanilla, oak, and bourbon combined for a great smell and taste. Would definitely have again."
"D: Pretty good. Solid beer."
"D - Considering the ABV, pretty darned drinkable!"
"D: Drinkability is solid given the abv."
"Feel is light as should be expected for a Wheat ale with Belgian yeast. Highly carbonated, light mouthfeel."
"I didn't have much hope for this before I tried, but after i'm floored. This beer is complex, totally drinkable, and very unique. Get a hold of this if you can."
"D- very nice flavors in this beer, I finished the bottle and enjoyed all of it. Swirl in glass to release some of the extra carbonation, it helps. Gonna have to go buy some more of this and let it sit for a year and try again."
"D: This one is very memorable but I don't know if I would go out of my way to come back to it. Definitely worth a try as it defies categorization."
"A capped 750ml bottle. Much thanks to mymrnngjckt for sharing this treat at a recent tasting. The bottle was uncapped and poured into my snifter. The ale appears a hazy golden amber color with a good inch or so of fluffy white head. The head produces a slight lace with each sip. The flavors and aromas consist of oak, vanilla, nutty, sweet caramelized grains, toasted coconut, wheat bread, fruity yeast. Medium to full bodied for a BSPA and adequately carbonated as well. Thanks again for sharing this one Kevin - tasty stuff."
"75cl bottle thanks to sandstone. Hazy orange with a big white head. The aroma is like a lemon meringue pie with a ton of vanilla. Very crusty with a buttery, flaky crust. The flavor has the same lemon-vanilla pie quality with some oak and caramel sweetness. Low on the hops with the sweetness carrying through the finish. Full bodied with smooth carbonation. Almost a little too sweet, but very unique and complex flavors."
"I feel bad giving a poor review to such a revered brewery but this one was unpalatable to me."
"Oh baby bring me more of this one. The abv is well integrated and while not invisible you can easily make the mistake of drinking this one too quickly."
"Drinkability is very high for the style and ABV."
"D: Strong sweet flavors and alcohol, but still smooth and delicious. It seems the wheat portion really smooths things out a bit."
"Bottle courtesy Sandstone. Pours a cloudy dark orange color with a fading tan head. Aroma is scotch-like, both in character and in alcohol. Strong estery notes with pear and stone fruit, some vanilla/honey. Flavor is delicious but very sweet; honey, candied citrus, vanilla, maybe a touch of tropical fruit. Not to mention bourbon. Rich but still hot, could use some time to mellow out."
"Taste follows the aroma. The alcohol is definitely apparent, but not necessarily intrusive. At first, I thought it was over carbonated (despite the appearance), but as time went on I realized how much the carbonation of this beer helps lift some of the 'heaviness' of the barrel character and alcohol. A very robust beer with a lot going on, but a 7oz serving or so was plenty satisfying. Looking forward to seeing how this one ages."
"D: Not what I was expecting... in a very good way. This was a nice treat to enjoy."
"This is an excellent brew, with complex flavors that evolve, making one sip invite another. A great beer to curl up with for an evening or to share as an after dinner drink."
"D: Interesting to try. I wonder what time will do to it. Next time I open one I will definitely let it sit and open up a bit first."
"Decent, but not my fave Bruery beer."
"Interesting, but not entirely enjoyable."
"Thanks very much to stevemcqueenjr for carrying this one cross-country. Poured a hazy burnt orange with a half inch frothy, bright white head that settles into a quarter inch skim. Some strands of lacing are revealed, but weak legs. Nose expresses, white grapes, cotton candy, toasted oak, vanilla and ethanol. Taste reveals coconut, citrus, whiskey, vanilla and buttery notes. Mouthfeel is medium-light, a little too high in terms of carbonation, but eases up as it dissipates. Amazing complexity to this beer with a fairly well-hidden abv. I'd love to see what some time in the cellar would do to this beer over time."
"I think this beer is too carbonated. The drinkability isn't terrible, but I can already tell you it's going to be a long night's work polishing off this 750ml bottle myself. Halvsies would have been perfect!"
"Brought to the table in a tulip, I nice golden color and white fluffy head. The smell is wonderful! It has a nice bourbon and caramel sweetness, with little hints vanilla and clove and a little bit if alcohol in the finish. The taste is very similar to the smell, lots of bourbon, caramel, vanilla and wheaty sweetness. It goes down super smooth and finishes very clean and dry. The bourbon plays very nice with beer. The bourbon and caramel in this beer are awesome. An absolute pleasure to drink. It coats my month very nice, medium bodied and just wonderful. The drinkability is pretty good. Overall, this is a wonderful beer! To bad this came out underneath the huge hype shadow that was Black Tuesday. But that leaves more for me!"
"Delicious really, but definitely one for contemplation, if not dessert. If you are a fan of bourbon or single malt, you will probably enjoy this - if not, then stay far far away. If I weren't rating for style, I might increase my score..."
"D: Lots of strong tastes here. But it's very heavy on the palate, and the finish is challenging. I'm not sure barrel-aging was a good idea for this one. Also, I really should have split this with people. I was unable to finish the bottle and poured out about 40% of it. Gah. I hate throwing away expensive beer."
"This is a big beer with tons of flavors and a seriously sweet character overall. Despite that and the high ABV, it remains exceptionally drinkable. Really well done."
"The taste opens with apricot and melon-like sweetness, honey, pepper and clove. Carbonation is very high, reminiscent of beers like Duvel. Again, I don't pick up much bourbon barrel character. The finish is semi-dry, woody, peppery. This is pretty good, but I don't think it's the most harmonious blend. A barrel-aged wheatwine sounds great on its own, but it seems like it lost some complexity and body in the blend. Taken as a Belgian golden ale, this beer is too sweet and heavy. These beers were probably best left separate."
"Drinkability is a bit shaky....just too high of an ABV and too much booziness to really make me want more than 8-12 oz. at a time. The 750 ml bottle really should be split 3 ways. Bottom line is this beer has some potential for improvement through maturity, but is a bit rough at this point."
"Overall one of the most interesting and enjoyable blends I have had it quite some time. I would have no trouble at all with splitting this one with some family and friends again any day. Really a remarkable style they are going for here."
"i shared this bottle with my sister(who is becoming quite a beer advocate herself now) and she says this is her favorite beer now. i'd have to say this is one of my top favorites as well now. they are going to go far with all these phenomenal beers they're making."
"Mouthfeel is quite good too. Fairly thick-bodied, verging on syrupy; but it is well balanced by ample carbonation. Sweet, syrupy body and high ABV limit drinkability, but overall I think this is a great brew. I was told this will be bottled in a couple months. I sure hope it is, and that the bottles find their way to Denver."
"All and all, I think I have been more impressed with this than any other Bruery beer (other than black tuesday which is made with Narwhal horn, the blood of the last known Mayans, and Panda tears...)"
"(for those who don't know; this beer is a Barrel aged Wheatwine blended with Mischief)"
"Out of the three beers that make up Melange 3 (White Oak, Papier, and Black Tuesday), this is probably my least favorite. However, that does not mean it's a bad beer - on the contrary, its another wonderful small batch from the Bruery that carves out a nice niche among the rest of their lineup."
"One of the few really big brews that I've tried where the tap pour and the growler pour have been noticeably different. Still, both very nice and well worth the try. A great effort and one that I would consider extreme in bold flavors; to my liking."
"The beer is light-medium bodied with medium carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel. This is tasty, but the alcohol in the flavor wore on me."
"I don't know what I was expecting but White Oak hit the spot on this hot day. It's a wheat beer with notes of vanilla. A whole lot of sweet with a tinge of sour fruit. Very drinkable. Left me wanting more. In fact, I want one now."
"Tulip glass at the brewery on Saturday after the Angels and Yankees game, this beer is actually a wheatwine, excited to try another component of the Melange #3, color is a golden yellow with some orange tint, one inch fluffy white head, some retention, minimal lacing, good looking for a barrel aged brew, aroma consists of oak, milk, vine, bourbon, lots of vanilla, tannins, overly ripe berries, and some doughy wheat, taste starts off a little warming with the booze hitting you up front, ripened fruits in the middle mixed with a little toffee, not chewy at all and mostly sweet, finish is also warming with lots of vanilla, some caramel that is on the sweeter side lingers in the aftertaste, warms up nicely, would have been much better on a cooler day probably, sticky, sweet, warm, and fruity mouthfeel, medium bodied, decent carbonation, taste lingers a long time, could drink another glass but this stuff is strong and you can pretty much taste it, at least it is not heavy or too sweet, which saves its drinkability, will drink again, recommended"
"D: I'm glad I finally got to try their wheatwine on it's own. This beer is fairly pronounced in Melange No. 3 which I loved, so I'm glad to see the basis of that brew."
"Overall: Since I haven't had the opportunity to taste the Melange #3, I would have to say this is the best beer coming out of the Bruery. Even better than Papier! A must try. Cheers!"
