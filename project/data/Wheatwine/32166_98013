4.37,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Whew! I'm really glad I made the trip back to Griffin Claw's booth to check out this beer. The recommendations and positive words aren't just jargon - this beer is seriously awesome. One of the most drinkable 13% ABV beers I've encountered with great balance between rye whiskey warmth and caramel, malty sweetness. Not the kind of beer you'd take to the dome, but in relatively sized, smaller pours, it's magical.","tectactoe","0"
