I'd think the wheat would add some smoothness (it seemed to), but cut the dark fruit tastes a bit (seemed to). I just think this offering lacks depth, which might be a discerning attribute from a barleywine, so take it for what it's worth.","cjgiant","Jul 10, 2014"

Smells of candied dates, some belgian sugar, some hints of toasted malts, a bit of sweet malt, some cocoa powder and a little tawny character - nice. Tastes sweet with toasted brown sugar, graham, some candied yams and plums. Tea, rice and and a little bit of malt extract syrup. Yummy beer. A bit like a simple syrup, low carb and a forgettable finish. I don't know that this really fits the wheatwine category, but I think this particular take on the beer to be fucking brilliant - I would even consider tossing a little bit of belgian yeast into this to give it a touch more depth.","harrymel","Nov 06, 2012"

I'm glad I got it as an extra in a trade, as I don't think I would want an entire 4 pack. I feel like a few of the bottles would sit around for a while (although with this ABV that shouldn't hurt the beer).

4.15,5.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5," This wheatwine stands out in the flavor dept for me -a candy like presence that shows the grain bill has a good amount of malt -the triticale is unique as it is toasty and does show off some of the finer flavor of both toasted wheat and rye giving a mild bread crust element with mild raisin and hint of date/nut with subtle caramel tinges toward the end. The alcohol is noticeable in the aroma more than the taste which is not an easy feat for an 11% ale - I found this to a pretty exceptional beer in the places where it counts -taste and drinkability.","Slatetank","Dec 08, 2011"

3.51,-10.5,3,2,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a 1" mocha head which seemed to draw all the carbonation out of the body which was flat thereafter. Dark as coffee. Very mild almost no smell but subtle hints of malt. Taste is sweet and hoppy and pretty strong despite the lack of smell and has dried fruits and toffee. There's a hop bitterness along moderate IPA scale. A mixed bag in this beer.","MoreThanWine","Oct 27, 2011"
3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Flavor has a smidge of bitterness with some choco and subtle toffee. Mixed in here is a grapey, vinous quality. This was more noticeable in their original Triticus series, but still present here in their small format. The choco is of the cocoa variety, a touch dry and chalky, and settles nicely on the palate.

The pour is a handsome looking dark brown to black with a thin tan head and pretty good clarity through its opaqueness. Powerful malt and chocolate aromas penetrate the nose with a hop presence on the backside. The body was about medium but firm, meaning the texture did not break down into carbonation bubbles while swirling. The chocolate is a bit more obvious in the taste than in the aroma with a pungent, strong hop bitterness melding itself into the experience. It is too bad that I did not notice it was a wheat wine/barley wine until after I opened it. I wonder what it might have tasted like at this time next year. Guess I'll have to buy another one and shelf it.","smakawhat","Oct 15, 2011"

At 11.5% you won't be grabbing one of these to cool off after a hot day, but at the same time it is not heavy or cloying, or overpowering to the tastes. Relax and sip this one, but enjoy its subtle friendliness and don't harass it for an explosion of flavors and sensations that you may quickly grow tired of.

It has a lot of dark fruit in the nose, and the flavors are present in the beer. There is a nice bit of roasted malt and smoke which compliments the sweetness of the fruit. The spiciness which is present in the finish also helps balance the sweetness level of the beer. Harpoon really made a solid big beer.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 24, 2011"
4.42,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours an almost opaque cola brown with a 1 inch puffy tan head that settles to a thin cap. A nice curtain of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark wheat bread, brown sugar, dark fruits, spices, and alcohol. Taste is of dark bread, dried fruit, and some spices. There is an alcohol twang on the tongue with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a thick and slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good wheatwine with a better smell than taste.

3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, this is one of the better beers that I've tried in the Leviathan series (having now tried almost all of them), and is one of the few in that series that I would regularly purchase. The beer as a whole is quite delicious, and the heavy sugars are nicely tempered by the wheat flavors, in much the same way that a good bowl of oatmeal, fresh berries, and maple syrup makes for a perfect combination. Only the slightly overpronounced alcohol whang keeps this from being a near-perfect beer in my books. Well worth trying.","VncentLIFE","Beers"

I was struck by the amazing smell of this beer. Tons of subtle malt smell with a delicate but identifiable hops zest around the edges. The hop smell is earthy with a bit of citrus. To taste this beer I expected something like an old ale meets a wheat wine. I actually tasted a subtle malt bomb that is all wheat wine with some subtle hopping.

Tastes of ripe fruit that were overlaid with the flavors of heavily roasted grains. Mouthfeel was actually the biggest and most pleasant surprise here.

4.03,2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"2010 vintage. 12oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with ruby highlights along the bottom of the bowl when backlit. Head was one inch, loose, tan-colored and embedded with ringlets. Head eventually collapses into a solid 1/8th inch cap - some lacing, but weak legs; only a few residual spots remained during the tasting. Nose is very much reminiscent of a Baltic Porter - cocoa notes, dark malt and a suggestion of red grape skins, as well as a hint of bubblegum. Taste consistent with nose, but a little bit acidic, and a strong ethanol presence towards the back, which culminates in a slightly acrid, hoppy bitterness that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light and slightly oily, with an assertive carbonation and some residual alcohol bite at the finish. In terms of drinkability, this beer could use a little more age in my opinion. It's still a little rough around the edges, but pretty tasty nonetheless.","Jwale73","Sep 04, 2010"

Banana bread, raisin cake, toasted wheat cereal...it's all there, and it works exceedingly well together. The body is heavy on the palate, but doesn't weigh it down to the point of tediousness. Carbonation helps that last point, as does a crisp bite of earthy hops and booze in the finish. Bottom line: Triticus is a beast. A big, boozy, beautiful beast of a beer.

The taste largely follows the nose: sugary, coffee (espresso to be more precise), dark fruits like you would expect in a quad or RIS, and a boozy flavor all are tasted before giving way to a big wheat flavor and lingering grain aftertaste coupled with the roasted espresso beans tasted before as they return. Low carbonation, thick and filmy. A very heavy but very tasty beer. Booze is pretty well hidden, but makes more of itself known as it warms. Going to try this again at a few different intervals to see how it ages.

4.63,18.1,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Hands down, this is the best beer that Harpoon has ever produced. The purpose of their Leviathan Series is to attract craft beer enthusiasts who have been disappointed with the mediocre brews in their 100 Barrel Series. Boy, did they ever get my attention with this initial release. Keep up the great work!","Damian","Jul 04, 2008"
4.29,9.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Had on tap most recently at Union Brewhouse, although I tried a couple of growlers straight from the brewery as well. Pours a dark brown, black with a thin tan head. Smells of dark fruits, wine, and lots of alcohol. Tastes are similar. I have liked this beer more each time I have tried it. It is extremely strong- almost makes you wince after each sip and warms you as you drink it. Very slick mouthfeel. I am excited for Harpoon to start up this series!","DrDogbeer","Beers"
3.88,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability - A huge beer and also a new style for me. A great experience to the wheatwines, which will make me seek out more. I doubt I'll have this one again, not because it wasn't enjoyable, but instead due to my ability to obtain more easily. However, if I see a Triticus, I'll be more than happy to add it to my beer cellar and revisit it in a few years, to see how it matures.","Nesued","0"
