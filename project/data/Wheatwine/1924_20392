This was a rather interesting warming brew, and while I would not come back to it again and again, it is worth a try and possibly a time to time revisiting.","Darkmagus82","May 24, 2014"

3.49,-5.9,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a deep golden color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and light lacing. Aroma of light residual sugar notes with some caramelized malt notes. Taste is also dominated by dry caramelized malt with some light grainy notes and a dry finish. Body is slighter thinner then average with average carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I thought this was not as warm as most wheat wine I’ve taste before and probably a tad more dry then I was expecting.","Phyl21ca","Oct 13, 2013"

3.67,-1.1,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Served in a snifter, a dark golden liquid, slightly hazy, topped with a small but solid cap of white head; a slight swirl left traces of laces on the glass. In the nose, sweet bready malts, citrus notes, yeast, peppery spice. I don't think this saw any barrel time, but there were some earthy/woody notes in the aroma and taste. Taste of caramel malts, fairly sweet, but kept in check by a pithy characteristic, dry toasted wheat, light peppery spice, grain alcohol, leafy hops, with a dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Worth a round, maybe even two, but that'd probably be enough for me.","Rifugium","0"
3.65,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has lots of tropical fruits. Taste is mild compared to the smell. There are tropical fruits, some sweetness, alcohol is present, a touch of hops. Easy drinking for this abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer.","tone77","Mar 19, 2013"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"D a better than average wheat wine, which isnt necessarily saying much. In this case I actually kind of like this one, it has a pleasant fruity character that balances any if the harshness that RNA other examples of the style.","nickfl","Jul 03, 2012"
3.43,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Thin head on a clear deep golden with copper hues body. Excellent lacing. Very sweet aroma with candied citrus, caramel malts and grape notes. Flavor follows well but is even sweeter, too sweet and medicinal up front with thick caramel malts, candied citrus and finishing a touch bitter And sour with earthy and Chardonnay notes. Creamy body and lighter side of moderate carbonation. Not an expert on this style, I just know I don't like it very much. Can't honestly say if this is a good version or not but overall too sweet for me.","kylehay2004","May 23, 2012"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an auburn type body w/ minimal head and lace. A very fruity aroma, I'm picking up cherry for some reason, as well as hints of citric but nothing too sour. Also a touch of peppery spice and some caramel malt. Strong bite from the alcohol and spice but not overpowering, definitely a thick sipper. I actually taste a sharp caramel and sugary sweetness balancing w/ a yeast/wheat twang (which makes the beer go down easier) and fruit flavors. I'm picking up things like black cherries and some herbal citric bitterness as well as a touch of tropical and tart fruits. A strong beer w/ a strong finish, this is a great after dinner sipper.","clayrock81","Jul 02, 2011"

3.64,-1.9,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF Round 5. It pours a murky amber-orange topped by a mild wisp of soapy bubbles. The nose comprises orange rind, mandarin orange flesh, light black pepper, light rubbing alcohol, white bread, lemon rind, and a hint of honey. The taste holds more/sharper orange, more lemon zest, lighter booze and bread, light bubblegum, honey, and a bit of that ol' clove/banana combo that we all enjoy so much. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta light syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty nice wheatwine, though ever-so-slightly boozy for my liking. Nice to see the style continues to spread.","TMoney2591","Mar 31, 2011"

3.72,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Recently saw this available in a bomber and thought I'd give it a try. Pours a deep golden color with a slight off white head. Smells of honey, golden currants, tart apples, and late summer goodness. Thick in mouthfeel that makes this a certain sipper. Alcohol heat is there from the beginning but as you work through it you get some blood orange, mixed with honey, peaches, and general breadiness. I enjoyed this overall but I would sit my next bottle in the cellar for awhile in hopes that the alcohol heat would ease somewhat so the other good flavors would be more prominent from the get go. As it stands now a good beer to try and share with a friend.","smokeypeat","Feb 23, 2011"
4.07,9.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"D: This had very nice honey wheat character that was really clean and tasty. It grew on my more and more as I drank it, too. Smooth body also, but the alcohol was quite noticeable, so drinkability was slightly hindered. Age may help mellow that out, but it was still definitely an enjoyable beer fresh.

3.72,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"On tap at a beer tasting event in MD. A clear copper pour with a smallish off-white head. A sweet aroma that features some Golden Delicious apples, golden raisins, vanilla extract, and a little oak. Some juicy oranges, lemons, grapefruits, and some floral qualities become apparent after it sits some. Medium to full-bodied and just a touch syrupy on the way down. Caramel, candied sugar, and vanilla upfront in the taste. Peach and apricot follow. Some sweet oranges at the end along with a touch of bittering grapefruits. Quite sweet all the way through. A tad cloying by the end. Not nearly as warming as I would've expected based on the 10% ABV.","CuriousMonk","May 14, 2005"

4.45,19.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this in a snifter at Xmas in July in Arundel Mills. This is an unfiltered beer that pours a hazy dark bronze with hues of red and a finger of off-white head which fades to a nice lasting ring. Very aromatic beer---wheat, plums, dark cherries, raisins pepper, floral hops. Taste is very sweet upfront--sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, cherry, with a strong hop finish mixed with a lingering alchohol. The beer is full-bodied and not overly carbonated making for a nice sipping beer. This is a highly drinkable beer for the ABV, one of the best that Duclaw has made.","cubedbee","Oct 18, 2004"
4.57,23.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both really high for a beer this powerful. The 11% ABV is cloaked well, and the combination of taste, just right carbonation and aroma can lead one to drink this far to fast - but this is one to savor and sip.","sideshowrob","Beers"
