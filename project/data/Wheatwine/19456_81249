4.29,11.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O:  Fantastic and interesting approach to the style. Huge wheat flavors earthy and fruity with a taste of sour funk. Nicely done. Coop's Territorial Series have been great so far. I'm glad to see this adventurous side to brewing. Well done! ","Hopswagger","Aug 07, 2012"
3.45,-10.2,4,4,3.5,2.5,3,"O: The bugs ran away with this beer leaving only a sample of a wheatwine. While many of the tasting notes common to a wheatwine are opresent the underlying sweet, fluffy and fullness a wheatwine should provide","barleywinefiend","Aug 04, 2012"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of wheat and orange citrus notes in it, as well as a little bit of tartness. The flavor is similar. The tart and lightly sour orange citrus notes come through first, but they are backed up by a good dose of wheat. There is also a nice amount of funk and leather in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Jun 18, 2012"
3.92,2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A good-sized, thin and bubbly off-white head clears out quickly, leaving scattered bubbles around the edge. Brass in color with a chill haze and some reddish orange around the edges. Sour fruits (apples, white grapes) are first noticed to the nose, and I must admit, the level of funkiness is bit unexpected, but quite nice. Following are some fresh wheat notes, a bit of lemon and some Belgian yeast. Tastes sweet with an almost cloying aftertaste and bit metallic in parts. Further inspection reveals a fruity, creamy core (banana anyone?), some caramel and grain. The initial sweetness subsides and the beer balances quickly as it warms. The alcohol is distant, and this one is dangerous because it slowly draws you in with a sweet siren song. Before you know it you are deep within its clutches, a fact that is not necessarily bad news, because this beauty comes in a magnum, so there's plenty more funky goodness to be had before the fun is over.","stephens101","Jun 15, 2012"
4.73,23.2,4.5,4,5,5,5,"This is a hybrid brew, not really a wheat wine and not really a wild ale. Some have criticized the lack of a discernible category; however, I find the end result fantastic and leaving me without a care in the world as to what style it is. What should be a strong sour profile is masked by alfalfa honey, which only adds to the complexity and layering of flavor. This beer gets better as it warms. I'd compare it to some of the Russian River beers.","JohnDRaines","Jun 11, 2012"

4.24,10.4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Well this "hybrid" take on the style seems to work very well. The wild yeast and wood add a deep level of layering. Very complex aroma and super mouthfeel are the strongest components. Alcohol is there, per style, but adds a sharpness that really works with the floral aspects. Not sure about the ABV but I'm guessing it's around 10.5%. I bought a couple of extra bottles on a gamble and I'm glad I did.","StaveHooks","0"
