"I understand why people don't like this and it's certainly got a bit of a bite, but I'm a fan. I liked it more on tap than from the bottle, as the bottle had less of a tequila and salt flavor, but all in all was still a pretty accurate depiction of a margarita (though perhaps a cheaper one)."

"I went into this with low expectations and was still disappointed."
"Well this is not a great beer by any stretch, but I think it's underrated.   Props for pretty much nailing the essence of a tequila-forward margarita, although I'm not sure anyone wants a beer to taste like that.  It'll be interesting how this thing tastes with a few years in the cellar - no point in drinking any more right now, and I doubt anyone's gonna want to trade for this."
"Lime, salt and tequila are all present, along with a fair share of booze. The citrus component comes off as almost plastic, strangely. While it sort of tastes like a margarita, the execution is lacking here - it's an overbearing mix of sweet, salty and citrus without any of the refreshing qualities of a good margarita. Perhaps a different base beer with significantly lower alcohol and sweetness would have worked better for this idea."

"Really, really not good. A mess of a 'beer'. I understand their goal but I'd rather and quite happily drink a dozen Lime A Rita's than have to suffer through this again. Smelled like vaginal feet."

"Sour lime, light tequila, very sour. No salt."
"Smells like an old margarita.  Tastes like an old woman's vagina.  Foul, foul."
"I shouldnt need to justify this review. Stuff is just awful."
""
"Sweet and sour at the same time. Faint tequila aroma and flavor. I hate tequila. I hate margaritas. I like this."
""
"The beer is definitely weird but the goal was to make a beer that tasted like a margarita and I think they made a great effort at it. Not something I want to drink every day but huge tequila flavor and some nice acid helps them meet their goal and that is how I was judging the beer."
""
""
"Offensive flavor, out of balance artificial lime profile with a watered down mouthfeel for such a big beer.  Not a sour or strong ale or a wheat whine but a mess of flavors with no real identity. I drain poured this."
""
"Smells like a margarita. Dead on. Tastes really weird. Don't know what to make of this, really. Is it a cocktail inspired beer? Is it a beer inspired cocktail? Is it happy hour down at the cabana? Not very drinkable - kind of like drinking melted alcoholic ice water that had some lime soda and tequila spilled in it. Sorry I'm just not the right audience for this one."
""
"Overall, it's not a great beer, but at least I have to give them props for trying something very unique, executed decently, but just hard to have."
"Serving type: Bottle"

"This beer definitely isnt something most people will enjoy. I myself am a tequila lover so I definitely enjoyed what this beer had to offer.  The smell was spot on but the flavor was a little too barrel heavy for me. I'd give this about a year in the bottle to see how it develops."
""
"Interesting what they were going for and while it hits on some notes, this is an overall miss for me."
""
"Tart, sour but not overpowering. Tequila is present but not offensive. Light saltiness. This is surprisingly a nice recreation/integration of a margarita and beer. Enjoyable but one glass is probably the max I can handle."
"Those mad scientists at The Bruery have gone way outside the box again with Roble Blanco. It is a departure from any wheatwine or barrel aged sour that I've ever had but it's quite the south-of-the-border taste adventure. Beer-garita!"
"Not what I had expected."
"Was really good, didn't taste like a margarita though. Reminded me of good tequila (haven't had much high-end tequila though). Hid the high ABV extremely well. Gotta give it to the Bruery for doing something different."
"Overall not the best; just weird and a lot of tequila/lime to it. Would not want to have it again."
""
"Nose full of aloe vera (raw agave?). A little salty, a little limey, a little awful."
""
""

""
"How can it be a Margarita-like beer when it's such a sweet, malty mess.  I tried to like it, but it needs to be more sour to balance it out."
"Tequila everywhere. Great beer. Nailed it!"
"Smells absolutely awful, and tastes like straight tequila & agave. Some lime and slight saltiness on the palate too."
"O: I was prepared for the worst but I actually really liked this.  A lot.  A failure for most but a definite winner in my book."

"It's easy to hate this beer, but hear me out. If this was served to me blind, I would hate it. But trying to execute a ""margarita"" beer can't be easy (I assume), but for what it is, the Bruery nailed it. Appearance is a dark amber colored beer with little to no head. The smell is margarita mix melded with the boozy sweetness of a wheatwine style ale known as White Oak. The tequila, lime and salt are there, and evenly balanced in smell and taste. This beer is exactly how the label reads. Actually, maybe a little better because I thought this was a sour ale, but it's not. It's tart, but not sour by any means. But that works for what they are going for in my opinion. The mouthfeel is perfect as light carbonation represents a cocktail beer well. Overall, I am impressed with what they achieved here. I am disappointed it was a mystery beer as I honestly would not want more than one. I expected a different direction for the mystery beers, but that has nothing to do with my rating."

"Had this the other day at work, and it was amazing when it is chilled. The downfall is that it is a little grainy at the end. Just a little too much salt that kind of lingers for too long. Do not let the beer get too warm."
""
"FT:  ISO: ?"
"Overall, I'm insulted that this is the RS Mystery Beer. If you don't live close enough to try this at the tasting room before you buy, heed my advice and skip it-- or buy it at your own risk."
