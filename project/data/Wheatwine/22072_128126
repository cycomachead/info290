Anyway, this stuff pours a cloudy amber topped by a finger of cream foam.  The nose comprises buttercream, bourbon barrel (and all that that encompasses), and a touch of ancillary booze.  The taste brings in more of the same, with a decided undercurrent of candied orange peel and miscellaneous dark fruits.  Nice.  The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.  Overall, a very nice barreled wheatwine, the base really cooperating very well with the barrel.  Get some!","TMoney2591","Nov 17, 2014"
