4.12,4.8,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours an off-white and creamy head that dissipates moderately. The beer itself is an opaque orange brown. The smell has strong wheat notes with what appears to be celery. There are also some light notes of sweet malt and a bit of alcohol. The taste is a bit different than the smell. In the taste, there are strong notes of wheat and malt. The malt is very sweet and the wheat takes the edge of a little bit. The celery taste is interesting in that it is a very nice finish to the more sweet notes. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy bodied with a bit of carbonation. The drink is pretty smooth and a little silky. Overall, a pretty good beer and worth getting again.","HattedClassic","Feb 28, 2014"
4.03,2.5,4,4,4,4.25,4,"A thick and hazy rusty walnut colored brew with pretty solid off white ring and scattering a of cover with a spotty, respectable lace in retreat. The aroma is delicate but undoubtedly full of dry grape skin and grainy alcohol with musty cinnamon lemon grass. The flavor offers wheat apple and more grape skin. A touch of honey and grainy malt. Alcohol is a touch heavy so the flavors have to contend with that a little. Citrus and leafy qualities come through. Overall this is a very nice blend. The body is medium full with a substantial feel yet it has a somewhat aqueous quality that drinks nicely. But ultimately it's a sipper to savor and goes very well with pepper jack cheddar !","Durge","Feb 18, 2014"

4.6,17,4,4.5,4.5,4.75,5,"I had this at a very very very nice Boston restaurant. Something like a champagne cork finish had me expecting a lot of froth but it poured with very little carbonation. Seriously cloudy with all kinds of chunkies! Not that chunkies are bad, I like the earthy, rusticality. This is my kind of aroma! Toffee and toasted walnuts with a mild hint of cocoa. Yay! Tastes like dark caramel and is really nice and sweet. I found myself just letting it all linger between sips. So much to enjoy!","JD4Cali","Feb 16, 2013"

Nose is dark fruit and malt and flavor is sweet dark fruit, mellow wheat. High ABV is hidden. Nice wheatwine. $14.99 for a 750ml bottle, from Giles Fine Wine Arlington, MA.","jdhilt","Dec 20, 2012"

4.62,17.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"O - I can't say I've heard of Mystic before receiving this bottle in a trade without warning was terrific. They've masterfully blended a strong barleywine with an abundance of smooth wheat for a round feel and flavor that's accented by alcohol and hops, not overtaken by them. Ever crevice of this beer demands exploring and though my review is finished, my time contemplating it is not.","BeerFMAndy","Oct 05, 2012"

3.61,-8.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Batch 001. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours a dull golden-orange with a slightly hazy clarity. Head is dense, three inches and cream-colored and eventually settles into a fairly consistent frothy skim with residual spots and strands of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus, pit fruit (slightly soured) and an earthy character. There's also a bit of ethanol towards the finish. Taste follows nose; however, there's a slight peppery/spicy character in the flavor profile. Malt is definitely present, but not overly forward. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an even carbonation the falls just shy of lively. I haven't had too many wheatwines; however, I found this one to be decent, albeit not mindblowing. I don't see age doing too much with this beer either. I do have to say that the alcohol is very well-hidden.","Jwale73","Sep 15, 2012"
4.1,4.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall: About as fruity a wheatwine as I have had. An excellent beer that is meant to be drunk slow. I would get this again if I saw it on tap. Good for the style and great overall.","tigg924","Sep 15, 2012"

3.58,-8.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a steady carb stream feeding a huge bubbly tan head that persists forever. Smells of lightly spiced wheat, a bit of orange peel, and grainy bready and caramel malt. The flavor is sweet and a bit subtle. There's a light sweet honey like malt up front followed by some bready and caramel notes as well as a hint of dark berries and a solid dose of ethanol. Medium to thick body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Nice beer, I'm glad I got to try it, but it doesn't really excite me. Its definitely better as it warms, but its crying for a solid dose of hops in my opinion.","johnnnniee","Jul 29, 2012"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Old Powderhouse pours a very hazy burnt orange. The off white foam that billows up to crown the beer hits four fingers in height. Head retention is very good, but the lacing left behind is pretty minimal. The nose has plenty of caramel and fruity esters. There's also a little bit of diacetyl present. Flavor wise, dicetyl is a bit more present when the beer's cold, and it's a bit overbearing. It retreats with time though, allowing caramel and apple led fruity esters to shine through. There's also a bit of a warming booziness to the beer. The body is full and creamy, with a carbonation that's just a hair too bubbly and active. It's definitely a minor issue though. I don't know if some more time would let Old Powderhouse finish cleaning up and rounding into form, but it's definitely not drinking badly right now.","axeman9182","Beers"

Bubbly and bitter punch of sour apples, rye spices, alcohol, nutmeg, and caramel on the first sip. Body remains bitter while the bubbly carbonation and booze lingers on the palate.

3.41,-13.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip. Pours a very murky brownish orange, with a massive 4 inch off white head, with plenty of lacing. Smell is lots of grape, clove, carmel, figs, hard candy, and bread. Taste is less sweet than the nose would lead on, but everything from the nose with fermented grapes being most dominant. A hint of brown sugar, but I have only had one other wheat wine from Smuttynose and that drinks closet to a barleywine then this. Body is thinner than you would expect with it's hefty ABV, plenty of life, not that dry considering the flavors, and surprisingly drinkable. This isn't my favorite type of flavors, but am enjoying anyway.","SawDog505","Apr 18, 2012"
3.97,1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a 2.5" caramel colored head with long life. The body is a deep cloudy sienna tan color. It smells of malt, tropical juices, and sweetness. The taste is quite rich with sugar, butterscotch, some malt, a little of the tropical fruit. Quite a long finish. I've got to say it's a little alcoholic, quite a burn to it, and I'm not averse to high alcohol beers I'm just commenting it's quite noticeable.","MoreThanWine","Apr 15, 2012"

4.03,2.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Well, an interesting wheatwine if there ever was one. Honestly it looks and tastes like the world's biggest witbier. Like someone took a witbier recipe and just doubled or tripled it. It's good, a bit simple - perhaps more complex when it's got some age on it. Plenty fine as is, nice and wheaty and fruity. Let this one warm up fully, it's much nicer that way.","Dope","0"
