"Pours red/brown/copper. Strong smell of apple and fruit. Smell very sweet. Taste is sweet and boozy. Fruits and sugary candy. My first experience with a wheat wine. Don't get me wrong... It is good and worth a try. It is a bit on the sweet side for me. Maybe the jury is still out on this style for me."

"True to style with it's grainy sweetness, the originality of Vern's Wheat Wine is in its fruitiness. This is a great wheat wine with everything I look for in the style plus that interesting apple and cherry factor. I hope this site is wrong about this being discontinued because this is more fine work from Straight To Ale."

"O: I really enjoyed this one. Maybe not the best wheat wine I've had, but very nice brew."

"I like this a ton. Yummity yum, yum, yum."
"I’m amazed to be drinking an 11% abv beer from Alabama. While Vern’s Wheat Wine is a pretty good beer, it’s a huge step forward for a state that’s had its beer shelves flooded with mediocrity. It’s alright. Definitely worth a try…especially if you live in Alabama."
"O- very nice beer would definitely drink ago. Easy drinking for 11% worth trying if you are able to find it. As it was only brewed once and running out. Grab one if you see it and try it."

"O: I liked this beer, but it didn't seem anything like the previous wheat-wine I just tried. This tasted like an Old Ale to me, and didn't have the light malt character or hop profile I'd expect from a wheat wine."

"Overall: A solid attempt at a tough style, especially laudable due to the brewery's infancy. If the booziness could be contained just a bit more, it would be a phenomenal brew. I probably won't go out of my way to buy this again, but I by no means regret giving it a try."
"As to the other review, I hope the headache went away and that reviewer is feeling better. I quite enjoyed this wheat wine. It has an almost ""spiciness"" to it that is quite unique. To be honest at 11% this is quite smooth and drinkable for what most would think would be a sipping ale. The color is a cloudy reddish color and the mouthfeel has many components besides a bit of booziness which would be expected for something this high in abv. All in all a great rendition of this sparsely attempted style. Good job Straight To Ale."
"O: Pretty average. I almost believe this beer may contain sulfites. After two sips I received the worst red wine like headache."
