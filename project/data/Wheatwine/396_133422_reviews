"Overall: An interesting brew in an often overlooked style.  Not sure what to think of it, but I do enjoy AleSmith."

"AleSmith Decadence is a strong, classic take on wheatwine. I'd love a barrelled version of this but am happy to have tried it and still have one to cellar for a year or two."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled in summer 2014. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big golden raisin, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, plum, honey, caramel, toasted bread, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of pale/bready malt, stone fruit/citrus, and moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big golden raisin, lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, plum, honey, caramel, toasted bread, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of golden raisin, lemon/orange zest, apricot, plum, honey, caramel, toasted bread, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice robustness, complexity, and balance of pale/bready malt, stone fruit/citrus and moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wheatwine style. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of pale/bready malt, stone fruit/citrus, and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"750 ml bottle.  Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  The aroma is sweet, the brew smells like raisins, dark bread, wheat, brown sugar, and caramel.  It tastes like dark fruit (raisins), brown sugar, dark bread, honey, wheat, caramel, earthy hops, and a bit of booze and apricot.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating, a little syrupy and smooth with moderate carbonation.  I thought this was a good brew, it's always nice to see more wheat wines out there for me to try!  $14.99 a bottle."

"Overall this is a good beer that was nice to try."
"O - This beer has many good qualities, but total absence of a head and overly boozy taste detract somewhat."

"In Alesmith we trust! I love wheatwines & was jazzed to see this, but itâ€™s too simply sweet to reach greatness. Still a good brew."

"Overall: a good and flavorful wheatwine. just lacking a little balance as it is very sweet."

"25.4oz bottle. Pours a murky orange-ish brown colot with a 1/4 inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is bready with apricots, peaches, honey, and caramel. The taste is wheat, peaches, apricots, honey, and some toasted malts. Some floral hops as well. Finishes with more wheat, honey, and apricots. Fairly noticeable alcohol presence. Lightly carbonated. Fruity and bready with a fair amount of sweetness. Overall, not bad but nothing I need to have again."

"This beer was ok. For what it was it was great, but I'm not really into wine ales so it was a little rich for me. Definitely grew on me by the end of the taster glass though."

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pous a hazy, medium orange amber with a brief thin head that dissipates to light ring around the glass, leaving no lacing. Aroma of caramel, light stone fruit, alcohol. Flavor is sweet wheat, caramel, honey, stone fruit, finishes unexpectedly dry and peppery with lingering hop bitterness. Thick, almost syrupy body with light carbonation. A classic take on a wheatwine, with the sweet body and hop finish, a bit sweeter than expected, but the drier finish balances that out and make an interesting flavor progression. I'm curious about how this one would age as the sweetness balances out; will cellar one if I see another bottle."
