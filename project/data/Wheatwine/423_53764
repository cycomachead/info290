I'm a tad disappointed in the lack of barrel characteristics, but then, I'm not.

4.03,0,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Pours a nice golden color with a big, frothy head that holds for quite a while.  Smells very bready, some peppercorn spice, bananas, cloves, and some fading tropical fruit notes.  The taste follows the nose rather well, like an imperial hefeweizen with some earthy, wine-like oak notes.  It's earthy, grass and hay, peppery, and loaded with fruit esters.  Highly carbonated mouthfeel and dry, bitter finish make this drink lighter than the abv would suggest.","adapt313","Mar 28, 2015"

It pours hazy gold with a 1” quickly dissipating white foam cap that has wine aromas, pours hazy gold with a 1 finger head that quickly dissipates, gold and produces rich lace. On the palate the yeast driven esters tend more towards white wine than the barley wine fruit profile. There is an underlying sweetness with a balancing hop bitterness on the finish. The alcohol is big, with the malt flavors providing balance and pulling things together. Oak flavors with a touch of vanilla lurk in the background. Medium full body with medium high carbonation. Alcohol warming on the finish but not overly hot or solventy.","pat61","Jan 25, 2015"

4.13,2.5,4,4,4.25,4.25,4,"An excellent wheat wine from Boulevard. As mentioned from other reviews it is a HUGE foamer that takes forever to die down. Attractive glowing amber in the glass with a nice light foam layer with no clinging lacing on the glass from this syrupy beast. Smells of honey, pears, light citrus fruits, grapes, and sweet malt. Complex as all get out. Mouthfeel is effervescent and crisp with a dry finish and bittering on the back of the tongue. Taste is sweet malts up front with the tastes of pears, green grapes, sweet almost Belgian style candy sugar, and medium bittering hops. Aftertaste is sweet and lightly citrus flavored. Meaty, beefy, big and bouncy. While I would say I was more of a fan of the Bell's versions (which I am holding for a special occasion) THIS is excellent and I would purchase it again, which for me makes it highly recommendable for all who can acquire it.

In fact where this beer lacked in smell and look it more than made up for in taste, faint tropical fruits, Papaya, Pineapple, going to a rich cream of wheat with hints of yeasty sweetness, with the alcohol barely discernible. Hops seem to be only present in the fruity notes, probably have diminished with age. The mouth feel was actually pretty good and it wasn't as heavy and thick as I expected, felt much 'smaller' than a typical english barleywine. Overall a very interesting beer and style that I would like to try more of as this was my first one.","oceanman907","Sep 23, 2013"

The taste was quite a bit more hoppy than I was expecting, because I did not read the back label first. The orange juice like flavor from the wheat malt phenols was balanced by very citric hops. There were notes of clove and pepper in the finish, as well as some white grape vinousness. The body was light and the fluffy feel given by the carbonation aided in drinkability.

Aromas of huge lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, tangerine, peach, pear, honey, wheat, bread, light pine, floral, grass, and herbal. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity hop notes with a moderate malt balance.

Fair amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, pine, wheat, bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus and tropical hop complexity; with a solid malt balance still showcasing hop flavors; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, creamy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

The oak aging adds a level of complexity without the overpowering nature that can come with 2nd use barrels--it's still fundamentally a wheatwine, calling to mind it's German ancestor, the weizenbock, but with a distinctively American flair.","LambicPentameter","Dec 26, 2012"

Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy dark gold/orange color with about an inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing. The brew smells like wheat, citrus (oranges), white grapes, clove, and some tropical fruit. It tastes like white grapes, oak, peppery spice, cloves, and some wheat/bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with low carbonation. I think this is a decent enough brew, but nothing really impressed me about it.

Smells sweet with lots of wheat, some lemon, and some bubblegum. The taste follows the nose really well. Starts off with some honey flavors that are mixed in with some wheat malts. Mixed in is a lot of bubblegum with some more of the honey and a touch of molasses. I am not too familiar with this style, however this is a delicious beer.

The aroma mixes refined fruity banana clove with a bubblegum hop that really entices the worthy observer. One of the undeniable scents in beer ken. The flavor brings on big bubblegum hop and biscuit clove over cloying lemon wheat sweetness. This stuff is near full bodied with fine carbonation and a luscious feel.

Tastes very complex as well -- grape skins, orange, lemon zest, wheat, malts, interesting Citra and noble hops contribute an almost muted bitterness that is very well balanced. There are a few spices in there -- pepper and something else. The yeast is very apparent as well. The alcohol does not come through (which I think is a good thing.) Mouthfeel is medium with a very light carbonation. Drinkability is high. Drank the whole 750ml and wanted more. What a great beer.

This caramel returns with quite a vengeance in the taste, along with all that wheat, some floral hoppiness, toffee, and a mixed bag of miscellaneous spice rack staples. The overall taste is a combination of light and buttery sweetness and a relatively weak piney bitterness. It's all good.

The abv% is actually remarkably low for a wheatwine (9.1%? really?), but it's definitely there after a while.

Up front the taste is maltier than the aroma with the earthy yeast tones kicking through in the finish. There is a nice overripe fruit thing going on that I find pleasing. The alcohol that is present in the aroma is nowhere it be found in the taste.

Light candied apples, sweet malts, light caramelized sugar sweetness, black pepper and honey are picked up in the taste. It is what I imagine an Imperial Saison would taste like, not sure if such a thing actually exists. Full bodied with a dry finish that hangs out for a while.

Smells of honey, hay, a touch of horse blanket, and a vague citrus. Tastes malty and nutty, with a slight acidic finish. The aftertaste is very pleasantly earthy. The mouthfeel is great.

I can see the booziness being too much for some, but for me it borders on the right side of harsh, thankfully restrained just enough to add the right amount of warmth and flavor to the back of the tongue and throat. Harvest Dance has a great mouthfeel, too...slick and slightly chewy, but light enough from the carbonation to keep it at a drinkable level. This beer is definitely a sipper--I can feel the booze working after half a glass--but it's a damn tasty one that I will gladly revisit.

3.8,-5.7,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Batch 1-2009. Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a hazy burnt wheat with a massive 4 inch head that just doesn't go away. I had to wait close to 5 minutes, just for the head to recede enough for some beer to actually settle out. As this beer recedes a crazy, sticky lacing is left all the way down the glass. If there were a category just for head retention this would be a 5. At all times there is a good 1-2 inch hat resting on top of the beer. The aroma is extremely complex. Up front is a good mixture of the Citra and Hallertau hops. Mango, pineapple, and just a slight bit of grass fill the nostrils first. Then comes the sweet orchard fruit with pears and red delicious apples. Sweet malts and Belgian candy sugar all come together with just a little bit of Dimetapp. The flavor profile is just as complex as the aroma; I just don't like it as much. The hops are a bit more subdued but still lend their tropical fruits. Overly ripe apples are abound along with yeasty biscuits, toast rolled together in a classic wheat profile. At the very tail of the flavor profile the Muscat grapes used to carbonate the beer really comes through, which leads to my biggest problem with this beer. It's really sweet. Its already a fairly sweet/sugary beer and the Muscat grape juice just makes it that much sweeter. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for such a big beer and it has a definitely effervescent carbonation. I love it that Boulevard pushes the boundaries and I'm excited to see them do it with a Wheat Wine.","hwwty4","Jan 10, 2010"

4.35,7.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours orange-brown with a huge, dark white head. The aroma is strongly wheaty, with a lot of alcohol as well. You get some citrus and grassy hops, more than expected. The flavor is wheat with the same earthy and citrus hops that were in the nose. You also get some Belgian yeast. This beer is very carbonated and has a medium mouthfeel. A sipper that changes both flavor and aroma as it warms.","Mora2000","Dec 29, 2009"
3.31,-17.9,4.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Overall, this is a pretty mellow beer (surprising given the alcohol), and nothing stands out like a huge impy stout. It is a little far on the sweet side for me. The pouring gets to be a bit annoying too - each pour, I get about an ounce of beer and tons of head.","Beaver13","Dec 29, 2009"
3.88,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a hazy, golden orange with a huge white head. There are also little particles of sediment suspended in the liquid. Aroma was fruity with a Belgian-like spice. Taste is much more hoppy than I was expecting from the aroma. Very fruitty and citrusy with some spice and some oakiness. Another solid beer from Boulevard in the Smokestack Series.","hckyfn9999","Dec 26, 2009"

My first wheatwine so can't say how it compares to others in style but if this is a good representation then I've found another style that I love. Highly recommend. Rotation - avail here in TX. Believe it's rotating in the series and not a permanent member. Gonna try at least one more fresh and then get another to cellar.","TexIndy","Dec 21, 2009"
3.58,-11.2,4,3.5,4,2,3.5,"Light to medium body. The overcarbonation really detracts from the beer here. Some alcohol warmth. Overall, this can be a really nice beer but the carbonation is too detracting.","Bierguy5","Dec 20, 2009"
3.63,-9.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Got out the Duvel tulip as the Boulevard smokestack series all seem to have enormous heads. The tulip still wasn't enough, difficult to pour without getting 90% head. Very light body, reminded me almost of a grape wine with the dryness. Interesting, but not my favorite from the smokestack series so far.","Mdog","Dec 20, 2009"
4.27,6,4,4.5,4,3.5,5,"Tastes, looks and smells much like a heavily hopped and malted Belgian wit which i guess makes sense. Not a bad thing at all","bfields4","Dec 18, 2009"
3.88,-3.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D - A zinger all the way around. It is pretty potent in terms of ABV. Also, I would find that it is a bit filling by its strong carbonation. Lastly, the wild saison like flavors make his beer a certain ""single quantity"" addition to your evening.","katan","Dec 18, 2009"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Wish I had something to better compare it, but its an enjoyable brew and I will gladly go finish off the bottle and likely pick up again. Another great smokestack offering from Boulevard!","kylejohnson03","Dec 16, 2009"

4.14,2.7,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"My biggest knock on this beer is the head. It was aggitating to pour a glass and not even see beer at the bottom. The whole glass was filled with head! I've never seen that before. I'm a barleywine fan and this did let me down a little by comparison. I was expecting a thick ale, but unless Boulevard totally screwed this up, a wheatwine is not too thick. Still, this was enjoyable and I wish I would have drank it during early fall, where I could see it really hitting the spot.","johnnybgood1999","Dec 15, 2009"

3.82,-5.2,3,3.5,4,4,4,"This is my only experience with a wheat wine but I am certainly going to look for more as this was quite enjoyable. Color is slightly hazy orangish yellow, pours with a huge amount of head but most of it dissapates quickly and only a small amount lasted through the first few sips. The nose on this one came across as tons of pineapple finished off with some grassy notes and a little peppery spice. Tastes like honey mixed with what I imagine fresh cut grass would taste like, toss in some black pepper. Hops are definitely present but not up front as is the case with most barley wines. Really nice complexity, as it finishes with a variety of different spicy notes lingering on the palate. The biggest surprise to me was the lightness of body of this beer. I was expecting something much heavier considering the alcohol content. Overall this was a great buy, just like all of the smokestack series purchases I have made so far. Highly drinkable, possibly dangerously so at 9.1%. I strongly recommend giving it a shot.","mhaws000","Dec 14, 2009"

4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D: Very nice. Abv feels much lower than what's stated on the bottle. This drinks like a beer with half the strength. Another Smokestack Series winner!","GbVDave","Dec 09, 2009"
4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange with a HUGE stiff off white head that resists fading and leaves a good amount of Belgian lacing. The smell is interesting...grainy wheat, sweet malt, earthy yeast...this one has it all very fruity, crazy complex with an unimaginable balance that stems from tha vanilla oaky notes...scoring points. The mouth feel is effervescent, tangy and creamy soft. Very light to style. Full flavored, the classic grain and oak treatment persist. A really fine drinker, the 9% ABV is well integrated. Great job on your 20 Boulevard!","jjayjaye","Dec 08, 2009"
3.93,-2.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This is admittingly the first Wheatwine I've ever had. Poured into a wineglass orange with a huge thick head. Most of this head can be contributed to me having just bought it and it was rolling around in the car. But the head had great staying value and great lacing. The smell was of orange and grapefruit scents. Which is what the taste was like. Being my first wheatwine, I can best compare it to a Belgian IPA without the Belgian yeast, and more of a straw dry feel in the mouthfeel. Very interesting.","whoneeds8","Dec 07, 2009"
3.26,-19.1,4,3,3,4,3.5,"750ml bottle $9. Nice orange color with a super-foamy head, I was actually surprised how much this one foamed up. The smell was kind of weird like a belgian style beer, strange and I wasn;t too impressed. The flavor had some tropical fruit just as the label noted but overall it was kind of boring, a little bit of vanilla and alcohol. This is not a beer I would revisit but I will always give the smokestack beers a whirl.","ArrogantB","Dec 06, 2009"
4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Extremely complex, though subtle. Exceptional balance. Another unique and enjoyable release from Boulevard whose Smokestack Series has become one of the most prolific big beer series in the industry. Can't wait to taste one after some time in the cellar. Move over Wheelsucker, this is now my favorite Wheat Wine.","BradLikesBrew","Dec 06, 2009"
3.7,-8.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"D= pretty good. I'm wondering what is up with all the esters in my bottle and the huge head that blew up. It has been in the fridge since I bought it about a week ago so it has nothing to do with me storing it. Oh well I guess it was delicious none the less.","jjanega08","Dec 05, 2009"
4.28,6.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"As with the rest of the Smokestacks, the carbonation is huge, so be careful pouring. Head is fairly thick and bubbly, and the color is reddish-orange. Retention is excellent, and a thick, somewhat crackled lacing is left behind. Aroma involves the obvious malt and wheat, as well as a sharp citrisy notes that strike at the end, some spice, and a slight sourness. Tastes of pure wheat, more spice and fruits, and a yeasty base with some slightly sweet malts enveloping it all and a middle layer of bitterness that finishes things off to near perfection. Goes down crisp with a nice little alcohol heat lingering in the throat. Boulevard can seem to do no wrong these days, and this is a tasty and unique addition to an already stellar lineup.","stephens101","Dec 05, 2009"
5,24.1,5,5,5,5,5,"This beer has a flavor that i have never experienced before. It is almost like white grapes and papaya with tons of fruity bitter hops and sweet barley. The new Citra hops are really nice and the wheat helps to enhance the fruity flavor! The oak adds a very subtle dryness and can be tasted slightly during the sip. The color is a mix between gold, brown, and orange with a very thick white head. The head will actually come out of the glass without pouring over the sides. The beer smells like white grape juice and wheat mixed together. Beer as innovative as this is one of the reasons why i love drinking so much. I recommend stocking up on this beer and let it age! Incredible!!!","huricrane47","Dec 05, 2009"
4.18,3.7,5,4.5,4,4,4,"This is my first foray into this style but I'm impressed. It's complex, rich, but not overly heavy. My only complaint is that the alcohol is a bit too noticeable even for a 9% ABV beer.","bump8628","Dec 02, 2009"
4.15,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Ah, now this is what I was looking for in a Wheatwine. So much more flavor and complexity than the last disaster of the style that I tried. Honestly, I don't see this one getting much better over time, so I say drink them now.","Mistofminn","Nov 24, 2009"

4.33,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Body is highly carbonated but really supports the bittereness and overall flavor of the beer. Medium body and really does well to hide the 9.1 ABV. Truly good!","naterock","Nov 14, 2009"

Its insanely flavored yet very balanced. Easy to drink for the style but also very complex. This is fantastic. You really must obtain some, drink some and age some.","Reaper16","Nov 11, 2009"
2.99,-25.8,3,4,2.5,2.5,3,"This is my only second wheat wine style beer. The other was 75th streets wheat wine! So when I poured this I thought it would be darker and sweeter. Appearance is brighter than I expected. Almost copper color, amberish. I can see a bit of suspended yeast and it is a bit cloudy. I absolutely love the smell. I can definitely pick out the citra hops, as I am a regular drinker of SN Torpedo which is the only other beer I know that has this new hop. The taste is very Belgium blond to me. I can pick up the sweet wheat malt all over. Not as sweet as I would like. I think this beer is overcarbed to my liking. I like the beer, but it is not one I'll pick up very often.","bearcamp","Nov 11, 2009"
