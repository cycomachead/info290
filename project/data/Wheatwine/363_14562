4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"OVERALL: Good stuff. A little boozier than it needs to be maybe, but the aroma and flavor are quite nice. A little less booze, or perhaps a little more time in the basement, and this would be excellent. Recommended if you happen to come across it somewhere. Thanks again Rutger!","Jeffo","Sep 13, 2013"

Looking forward to trying a fresh bottle as I believe this was probably past its peak, but not yet oxidized.","Quafftastic","Jun 06, 2013"

4.5,13.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours an attractive clear medium orange amber. Very light carbonation and only a slight head, but it left light lacing as it dissipated. Sweet citrus caramel malt aroma. Malty with a distinct, unusual orange citrus flavor. The fruit flavor persists strongly in the finish. Unusual and tasty. Medium bodied, almost syrupy. A very nice wheatwine.","LiquidAmber","Sep 22, 2011"

2.21,-44.5,3.5,2.5,2,2,2,"Wet paper and grossness is what follows. Is it possible to be boozy and oxidized? yes, yes it is. And here it is. Strong and gross throughout. Drainpour.","drabmuh","Sep 17, 2011"
2.51,-36.9,4,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Pours a light-medium copper with a thin off-white head and fairly-good retention before falling into a collar. The nose carried a bit of bread crust and malt plus slight oxidation. The flavor was a bit of oxidation with mild sweetness and a bit of a generic malted barley character. Faint toffee and moderately-heavy alcohol. Medium body and light carbonation, plus some dry grain tannins. Fairly boozy. Not a big fan.","Thorpe429","Sep 05, 2011"
3.48,-12.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer is light orange colored, and appears transparent. The head is small, fades quickly, and leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma offers malt, butterscotch, caramel, alcohol. The flavor is of butterscotch candies soaked in alcohol. I happen to enjoy the flavor of butterscotch, albeit infrequently and in small quantities, so I did not find this beer as unsatisfactory as the other guys who shared this bottle. The feel is thick and syrupy, with moderately low carbonation and present alcohol. Overall, an ok brew, but I don't think this is the number one wheatwine.","Huhzubendah","Jul 31, 2011"

4.17,4.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Courtesy of bvc over on ratebeer. Thanks again Brandon. Pours crystal clear copper with full tan head. The aroma is spicy hops mixing with red apple, plum, dates, a mild level of ripe cherry, a thin layer of malts and caramel. The taste is yum with smooth ripe plums, sugar simmered diced cherries, skinned red apple wedges, some dates and slick sweet malts. I'm missing the wheat part of this but it's so good I don't really care. Well done.","BigMcLargeHuge","Jul 31, 2010"
4.25,6.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability: quite good; this has all the elements of a very drinkable beer. For me, though, it is a bit strong to keep quaffing all night. I was quite happy with my half-pint serving size.","flagmantho","Jul 25, 2009"
3.87,-2.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Way too fruity and sweet at first, but once it warmed up, I could see it as a kind of dessert beer or nightcap. Definitely not something to drink in quantity, however. One bomber is definitely enough! It's high price and lack of local availability makes it unlikely I'll have another one anytime soon, and while a novel drinking experience, it's not one I'll pine for, but I'm glad to have tried it.","woemad","Oct 05, 2008"

4.5,13.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability is very good. Man... I am Wheat Wine fan, and this is probably the #1 beer of the style in my book. Just super complex and very tasty. My only complaint? That I don't have another one of these too sit on. This beer easily could have aged for quite a while longer.","flexabull","0"
4.48,12.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Orange body with touches of amber and scarlet. Almost no head, aside from a smattering of patchy foam. Nose is like boozey orange, with the alcohol shooting through the nostrils. I can taste oranges covered with carmel, and extremely pleasant alcohol that I find heavenly. There's a certain graininess to the finish. The light carbonation gives this a full mouth feeling that I enjoy. I could see myself buying a lot of this were it readily available (and cheaper too ... my bottle cost me almost $10). Easily the best Wheatwine I've ever had. It's hard to believe Bill Jenkins made this beer even better than it ever was, but he did. Cheers to you Bill!","TheBungyo","Sep 24, 2004"
4.25,6.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Tastes lovely. Notes of ripe apples, lemon, brown sugar, grapes, plums and banana. Big buttery grain body. Well hidden alcohol. One I would love to revisit someday.","Crosling","Sep 02, 2004"
4.42,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Sampled from a 22 oz bomber. A million thanks to skyhand for sharing this one with me. Pours a deep golden almost orange. It's a little hazy and has a tiny and quickly dissipating head. Sugary sweet aroma of candied citrus fruit. Lemon and orange citrusy sweetness atop toffee-ish base with notes of white grapes & sugar-coated raisins. Hoppy bitterness and burning alcohol are an absolute delight. Full-bodied and then some. A delectable, sweet sipping treat.","garthwaite","Aug 05, 2004"
4.22,6,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Flavor is initally sweet witha continuing bite of a ton of hops and a blow through of alcohol before the final hop burn.","drewbage","Beers"
4.5,13.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"As a side note, it looked so much more better. There was a huge, retentive, lacing head on this vintage that made it quite awesome to look at. I also enjoyed the nose a bit more so raised both ratings by half points.","RoyalT","0"
