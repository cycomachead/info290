"Overall – The flavors reminded me somewhat of a grand cru, but without the yeasty flavors and with a bit more of a boozy flavor. This was a rather interesting warming brew, and while I would not come back to it again and again, it is worth a try and possibly a time to time revisiting."

"Bottle: Poured a deep golden color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and light lacing. Aroma of light residual sugar notes with some caramelized malt notes. Taste is also dominated by dry caramelized malt with some light grainy notes and a dry finish. Body is slighter thinner then average with average carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I thought this was not as warm as most wheat wine I’ve taste before and probably a tad more dry then I was expecting."

"I just didn't enjoy the taste or numbing mouthfeel of this one."

"O- Pretty good wheat wine. Big and robust, and the wheat is definitely in the forefront."

"Served in a snifter, a dark golden liquid, slightly hazy, topped with a small but solid cap of white head; a slight swirl left traces of laces on the glass. In the nose, sweet bready malts, citrus notes, yeast, peppery spice. I don't think this saw any barrel time, but there were some earthy/woody notes in the aroma and taste. Taste of caramel malts, fairly sweet, but kept in check by a pithy characteristic, dry toasted wheat, light peppery spice, grain alcohol, leafy hops, with a dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Worth a round, maybe even two, but that'd probably be enough for me."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has lots of tropical fruits. Taste is mild compared to the smell. There are tropical fruits, some sweetness, alcohol is present, a touch of hops. Easy drinking for this abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"o: One of the best wheatwines I've had. Should have bought more dammit."

"D - This was yet another enjoyable offering from DuClaw... A bit rough around the edges and perhaps a bit cloying, but those are rather minor critiques in the grand scheme of things... Overall this one of quite enjoyable with good depth and character..."

"D a better than average wheat wine, which isnt necessarily saying much. In this case I actually kind of like this one, it has a pleasant fruity character that balances any if the harshness that RNA other examples of the style."
"Thin head on a clear deep golden with copper hues body. Excellent lacing. Very sweet aroma with candied citrus, caramel malts and grape notes. Flavor follows well but is even sweeter, too sweet and medicinal up front with thick caramel malts, candied citrus and finishing a touch bitter And sour with earthy and Chardonnay notes. Creamy body and lighter side of moderate carbonation. Not an expert on this style, I just know I don't like it very much. Can't honestly say if this is a good version or not but overall too sweet for me."
"O: One of the most unique beers I've ever come across, wheatwine or no. Any time I can easily finish a bomber of a 10% beer, it's usually a great thing. Can't say drinking this gives me the feeling of misery - maybe when it's all gone, I'll feel this misery DuClaw preaches, but right now, all I feel sipping this is glee."

"D: Very good beer but I just want a little more flavor out of the style. We split this bottle and it was too drinkable. For better of worse. Barrel age this then..."
""
"A totally solid wheatwine, not miserable at all! And at a good price point as well."
""
"Overall I think the beer fits the style and seems to be a good representative of it. My personal experience in this style is limited, but I certainly enjoyed the ride!"
""
"Very good beer. The combo of flavors is interesting in a wheatwine no, scratch that, unique. Odd, but nice."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and a little syrupy overall. Carbonation is moderate for the style. Overall it was a solid beer of the style. It wasn't amazing in any of the categories, but very enjoyable overall."
"D: a lot of potential in this glass, just needs some time to mellow. alcohol gets in the way of citrus/fruit nuances. otherwise a great bottle to put away in the cellar and share with some friends."
"O: Nice wheaty, boozy, sweetness."
"This is complex, chewy and overall enjoyable. Sweet, boozy and thick, this is not for the faint of heart!"
"Pours an auburn type body w/ minimal head and lace. A very fruity aroma, I'm picking up cherry for some reason, as well as hints of citric but nothing too sour. Also a touch of peppery spice and some caramel malt. Strong bite from the alcohol and spice but not overpowering, definitely a thick sipper. I actually taste a sharp caramel and sugary sweetness balancing w/ a yeast/wheat twang (which makes the beer go down easier) and fruit flavors. I'm picking up things like black cherries and some herbal citric bitterness as well as a touch of tropical and tart fruits. A strong beer w/ a strong finish, this is a great after dinner sipper."
"O: This beer sort of blew me away. I felt like I was drinking a barleywine only a little sweeter. This was my first wheatwine experience and I wasn’t disappointed."
"O- Nice brew from DuClaw... Not quite world class, but a totally solid brew that you should pick up and check out if you see it. Enjoyed it."
"O: this one is a little too far on the sweet side of things for my liking."
"O: I couldn't bear the misery induced by this beer and ending up drain pouring half of it. Odd, cloying, sweet alcoholic orange juice."
"Very solid, almost like a light barleywine, but in a good way. Definitely the best beer I've had from Duclaw, a must try."
"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF Round 5. It pours a murky amber-orange topped by a mild wisp of soapy bubbles. The nose comprises orange rind, mandarin orange flesh, light black pepper, light rubbing alcohol, white bread, lemon rind, and a hint of honey. The taste holds more/sharper orange, more lemon zest, lighter booze and bread, light bubblegum, honey, and a bit of that ol' clove/banana combo that we all enjoy so much. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta light syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty nice wheatwine, though ever-so-slightly boozy for my liking. Nice to see the style continues to spread."
"O: To date, the best Wheatwine I've tasted."
"D: Only due to the high ABV and the fact you can taste and feel it right away, I had to give this a lower drinkability score.. I'd only have 1 serving, but savor it."
"I'm pretty sure this is a wheatwine, and maybe one I have had before, so let's see... DuClaw Brewing Misery Wheat Wine! Sweet! This is tasty, and while I got the style right, I have never had this, yet alone heard of it. Thanks again Nate!"
"Recently saw this available in a bomber and thought I'd give it a try. Pours a deep golden color with a slight off white head. Smells of honey, golden currants, tart apples, and late summer goodness. Thick in mouthfeel that makes this a certain sipper. Alcohol heat is there from the beginning but as you work through it you get some blood orange, mixed with honey, peaches, and general breadiness. I enjoyed this overall but I would sit my next bottle in the cellar for awhile in hopes that the alcohol heat would ease somewhat so the other good flavors would be more prominent from the get go. As it stands now a good beer to try and share with a friend."
"D: This had very nice honey wheat character that was really clean and tasty. It grew on my more and more as I drank it, too. Smooth body also, but the alcohol was quite noticeable, so drinkability was slightly hindered. Age may help mellow that out, but it was still definitely an enjoyable beer fresh. Recommended."
"On tap at a beer tasting event in MD. A clear copper pour with a smallish off-white head. A sweet aroma that features some Golden Delicious apples, golden raisins, vanilla extract, and a little oak. Some juicy oranges, lemons, grapefruits, and some floral qualities become apparent after it sits some. Medium to full-bodied and just a touch syrupy on the way down. Caramel, candied sugar, and vanilla upfront in the taste. Peach and apricot follow. Some sweet oranges at the end along with a touch of bittering grapefruits. Quite sweet all the way through. A tad cloying by the end. Not nearly as warming as I would've expected based on the 10% ABV."
"Drinkability: The beer is limited by the 10% abv. It has aged surprisingly well though and I'd love to try it in a year or so."
"Had this in a snifter at Xmas in July in Arundel Mills. This is an unfiltered beer that pours a hazy dark bronze with hues of red and a finger of off-white head which fades to a nice lasting ring. Very aromatic beer---wheat, plums, dark cherries, raisins pepper, floral hops. Taste is very sweet upfront--sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, cherry, with a strong hop finish mixed with a lingering alchohol. The beer is full-bodied and not overly carbonated making for a nice sipping beer. This is a highly drinkable beer for the ABV, one of the best that Duclaw has made."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both really high for a beer this powerful. The 11% ABV is cloaked well, and the combination of taste, just right carbonation and aroma can lead one to drink this far to fast - but this is one to savor and sip."
"Drinkability: Sippers only need apply, this ain't no chuggin beer here."
