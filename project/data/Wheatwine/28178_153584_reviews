"Pours cloudy light woody brown in color with a thin off white head. Aroma has loads of caramel, apple, orange peel, and some spices in the finish. Hint of oak and bourbon are throught the entire nose. Taste has more fruity aromas forward then the nose with flavors of orange, apple, caramel, bourbon and oak and a faint acidity in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick in body with light carbonation and a slight dry sweet finish."

"This is the barrel aged version of Elijah's Revival. Good beer, though atypical. Lots of orange flavor."
