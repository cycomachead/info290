"Overall, a full bodied, surprisingly easy drinking wheat wine.  A good dessert beer, even if just after lunch."

"Delicious. Smooth mouthfeel and sweet on the nose. I can definitely sense the honey hiding in the background and its sweet from beginning to end. An easy sipper and a very dangerous beer because I could easily throw back a few of these and at the 9.1% alcohol content these bad boys could quickly do some damage!"
