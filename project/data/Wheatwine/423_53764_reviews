"This beer is too sour to enjoy.  I try something else"
""
"A pretty tasty version of the style, everything nicely aligned, with the inherent fruit esters more or less running the show.  I'm a tad disappointed in the lack of barrel characteristics, but then, I'm not.  Overall, I'd have no problem taking this one to the soiree, and then dance with the one I brung."
"Pours a nice golden color with a big, frothy head that holds for quite a while.  Smells very bready, some peppercorn spice, bananas, cloves, and some fading tropical fruit notes.  The taste follows the nose rather well, like an imperial hefeweizen with some earthy, wine-like oak notes.  It's earthy, grass and hay, peppery, and loaded with fruit esters.  Highly carbonated mouthfeel and dry, bitter finish make this drink lighter than the abv would suggest."
""
""
""
""
"Spice, fruit, complexity all in a lower carbonated flavor bomb.  Notes of more cinnamon, ripe bananas and pineapple,  mild red hot candies.  Well crafted and quite enjoyable. Nice mellow  dessert/night capper kinda brew"
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer, although I think they could cut another percent off of the ABV and really have something to put in their seasonal lineup to rival Tank 7 and Long, Strange Tripel.  Another winner from Boulevard."
""
""
""
"Smells like a hefeweizen, tastes like a tripel."
""
"O – Love the way this beer feels, and the French oak adds a lot of character without overwhelming it.  Much like a heavier version of saison or biere de garde, seems very Belgian in inspiration.  Excellent."
""
"Final thought - $9 is a little high for the quality but the abv is very nice and almost undetectable in the ale which is nice and not nice"
""
""
""
"Very good and unique wine wheat styled beer. It's very smooth going down and the taste is splendid. A personal favorite of mine."

"O- surprisingly very fruity, but it played well with the wood.  This has held up nicely over 3 years"
""

"This has a white wine nose with a background of light bread without the crust, light malts, a faint trace of citrusy hops and a hint of alcohol. It pours hazy gold with a 1” quickly dissipating white foam cap that has wine aromas, pours hazy gold with a 1 finger head that quickly dissipates, gold and produces rich lace. On the palate the yeast driven esters tend more towards white wine than the barley wine fruit profile. There is an underlying sweetness with a balancing hop bitterness on the finish. The alcohol is big, with the malt flavors providing balance and pulling things together. Oak flavors with a touch of vanilla lurk in the background. Medium full body with medium high carbonation. Alcohol warming on the finish but not overly hot or solventy."

""
""
""
""
"Poured from the tap at Oak & Oar OKC a clear apricot gold. The two fingers of creamy, white head stays for several minutes leaving heavy lacing as it settles to a thick foam. Nose is floral, spicy and a bit woody. As others have noted, it's similar to a saison with Belgian yeast, lemon and some pine. The mouth is medium light and very dry, almost off-putting. It's not like other wheatwines, but it is interesting. Well-crafted, but not something I would turn to often."
""
""
""
"Good beer, well crafted.  Unique compared to others I've had of the style.  Definitely worth a try."
"O - Not bad, but the sweetness begs for a higher level of carbonation to balance it out."
""
""
"Beer is delicious, but does not remind me of any other Wheatwine I've ever had. It is more of a farmhouse style.  I would rate it higher if it was considered that."
""
""
""
"O:  Enjoyable brew, but bills much better as a farmhouse ale or saison than a wheat wine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Wheatwine hasn't always been my favorite style, but Harvest Dance is a better example of one. Very drinkable and well done."
"Pours a hazy orange, thick off white colored head, half inch remains, rings of thick lace down the glass. Smell: this is an odd mix... really phenolic... heavy on clove and band-aid; next estery... banana pudding (and vanilla coming in here); finally, hopping is soft tropical fruit and mild grassiness. Taste: sugary mango-banana pudding, citrus peel note, clove, wheat bread. Medium-plus bodied, sugary but no alcohol. Powdery banana thing becomes a bit much over the course of the 750ml. Enjoyable but an odd combo. Not much from the oak, if anything."
""
"Just a little lacing. After five years the carbonation was still strong and flavor interesting. I'm definitely glad I had this."

"i am really glad they made this one again. i have regretted not picking up a bottle since it was out last. this is a real cool beer, oddly light in palate and oddly dry for the style, unlike any wheatwine i have had before it. its also quite hoppy too, coming through almost as an ipa in that way, although more fruity than bitter for sure. the booze is warming but not sharp, and the wheat malt is fresh and flavorful, but also extremely light in weight. honey sweetness comes on mid palate, and the oak its finished on is really subtle, but mellows the edges nicely. i enjoy the dynamic nature of this, but also the fact the i can drink a whole glass of it without being full or sugared out. definitely the most unique expression of the style ive had, and maybe one of my favorites. bold beer again in the smokestack series. some of the best domestic beers out there have come from it."

"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of caramelized malt with some toffee notes and some residual sugars is enticing. Taste is dominated by caramelized malt with some grainy notes of wheat and some residual sugars with light aftertaste of toffee. Body is about average with good carbonation and light warming alcohol notes. Very flavorful beer but slightly lacking in terms of complexities."
"Pairing with gourmet popcorn.  2 parts salted butter 1 part extra virgin olive oil, Gruyere cheese, garlic powder, sea salty and spicy Mediterranean mix for bread dipping."

"O: Not bad but I think I let this one mellow a little too long. Smelled great from the bottle but all those delicious hop notes are pretty muted. Due to the malt bill there isn't enough specialty grain flavor to keep things interesting without the hops. shaking out some carb helped round things out but it's still a little weak. I need to pick up a fresh bottle and revisit this one because the potential is there but it isn't meant to be aged for this long."

"An excellent wheat wine from Boulevard. As mentioned from other reviews it is a HUGE foamer that takes forever to die down. Attractive glowing amber in the glass with a nice light foam layer with no clinging lacing on the glass from this syrupy beast. Smells of honey, pears, light citrus fruits, grapes, and sweet malt. Complex as all get out. Mouthfeel is effervescent and crisp with a dry finish and bittering on the back of the tongue. Taste is sweet malts up front with the tastes of pears, green grapes, sweet almost Belgian style candy sugar, and medium bittering hops. Aftertaste is sweet and lightly citrus flavored. Meaty, beefy, big and bouncy. While I would say I was more of a fan of the Bell's versions (which I am holding for a special occasion) THIS is excellent and I would purchase it again, which for me makes it highly recommendable for all who can acquire it. Cheers."
"O - If the bottle didn't say ""Wheat Wine Style Ale"" I would swear this is a saison. It is the lightest, easiest drinking wheat wine I have had. I is fantastic on a hot, humid, day. It doesn't drink like a 9% beer either. The years have been kind to this one."

"O- I think I'm starting to dislike wheat wines more than I have in the past. It seems like it's a style you really have to nail to be enjoyable yet I haven't had enough examples frequently enough to know what needs to be achieved. Guess I'll just have to keep trying different ones out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This wheatwine is very delicious, enjoyable, and tasty. Makes me want more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I look forward to trying the next batch of this stuff fresh. If this is exemplary of the style, I'd love to try more of them. If you see it on the shelf, don't turn away from it. It's a solid beer even if it *is* past it's best-by date. Once you pour it, make sure you're very aware of where your coffee table begins and ends too. Your rug won't appreciate it as much as you will."

"The appearance of the beer may have been bad because of the extended time in the bottle, because there was quite a bit of floating bits throughout the beer, but it was not off putting tastewise. In fact where this beer lacked in smell and look it more than made up for in taste, faint tropical fruits, Papaya, Pineapple, going to a rich cream of wheat with hints of yeasty sweetness, with the alcohol barely discernible. Hops seem to be only present in the fruity notes, probably have diminished with age. The mouth feel was actually pretty good and it wasn't as heavy and thick as I expected, felt much 'smaller' than a typical english barleywine. Overall a very interesting beer and style that I would like to try more of as this was my first one."

"--- Re: I must've been in th right mood.  To me it's just okay, and didn't hit the spot, and I can't see many occasions where I'd think differently. (Rated down to 3.5 from 3.75)"
""
"Overall, this is good beer, though I suspect that the pineapple and melon notes might drive some off. Luckily the bubble gum aromas did not translate to the tongue, which would have been disastrous. The beer may be a bit dry, but the massive fruit esters make it seem like apple cider champagne, and the result is so interesting that it’s worth a try."
""

""
"I haven't had too many wheat wines to compare this beer to, but I am enjoying it and think it is a good example of the style. I'm glad I traded for it!"

"O: This beer seemed to taste more like a tripel compared to a wheatwine and wasn't nearly as drinkable compared to other beers in the style."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was my first wheatwine and I enjoyed it. I would drink this again."
"This is a great beer, but the ABV could be better hidden and there could be more subtleties in it as well. Worth checking out!"
""
""
""

"O: Wonderful, complex flavor with a noticeable mouthfeel, Harvest Dance is a winner. I would buy it again, happily."

"22 ounce bottle for $6.99. Aroma is wheat husk, crushed malt grains, lime, banana, and peppermint. Appearance is dark, grey yellow with a lot of foam. Taste is lime, paprika, cornbread and orange zest. There’s a wooden earthiness that adds a complementary dimension. Palate is medium bodied and heavily carbonated. Overall, it’s crisp, filling due to the big carbonation dose, refreshing, sweet. Pretty good."

"Great wheat beer"
""
"O: Overall, I enjoyed this one. As I said above Im not very familiar with the wheatwine style, the only other one I've had was White Chocolate which is amazing but I dont think is representative of the style. To me this one was definitely reminiscent of a Tripel. I could see myself enjoying this on a hot summer day, which certainly isnt always the case with high gravity beers. I enjoyed this, would recommend, and plan to keep an eye out for more in the style to compare."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the first wheat wine I have tasted however compared to the description of a fluffy mouth feel I would say this beer is spot on in style. This style actually reminds me of a farmhouse ale/saison. Personally it’s a little too citrusy for me. I don’t know why this is maybe it is the wheat malt."
""
""
"O: Much better than I expected. This had been sitting on the shelf at my beer store for months before I thought I'd give it a try, and it's actually very good. The wheatwine style seems to lend itself to the Belgian flavors. Overall a wonderful beer."
""
"D: This was a unique wheat wine with a very ""true"" wheat scent and taste. The body was refined, and the finish was smooth, and the alcohol was well hidden. So it was surprisingly easy to drink. It would probably age well, but it was also good fresh. I wish the barrel character was more prominent, but this was otherwise a very well constructed and enjoyable beer."
"Great beer!"
""
""
"The orange-amber color made this beer look more like a DIPA, than a wheatwine. The beer was well carbonated, and a four finger thick head formed rapidly in my Duvel tulip glass. The beer smelled strongly like oranges and roses. The taste was quite a bit more hoppy than I was expecting, because I did not read the back label first. The orange juice like flavor from the wheat malt phenols was balanced by very citric hops. There were notes of clove and pepper in the finish, as well as some white grape vinousness. The body was light and the fluffy feel given by the carbonation aided in drinkability. The alcohol was very well concealed, as there was no burn. Another well made beer from Boulevard."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; batch 2012-1, best before 6/2013. Pours cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, tangerine, peach, pear, honey, wheat, bread, light pine, floral, grass, and herbal. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity hop notes with a moderate malt balance. Taste of big lemon zest, orange zest, peach, tangerine, pineapple, pear, floral, wheat, bread, pine, grass, and herbal earthiness. Fair amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, pine, wheat, bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus and tropical hop complexity; with a solid malt balance still showcasing hop flavors; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, creamy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic wheatwine style. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus and tropical hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"OK...at least 15 minutes into this bottle...nice head remains on slightly cloudy gold-copper colored wheat wine. Bread and slight tropical fruit aroma. Flavors are rich, complex, intriguing...bitter, tropical fruit rind, creamy malts, a touch of lemon and hay...different and intriguing. Not for everyone, but I find this fun enough...9.5%, rich and creamy helps. A robust load of malts, hops and oak aging...some funky fruit rind...oooh baby...esters galore...different from the wheat wines I've had in the past, but that's OK...nicely done."
"O: Sort of an odd choice to use a Belgian yeast strain for a wheatwine, but this tastes pretty good."
""
""
"750ml bottle: This one pours a cloudy, slightly orange tinged golden color. There was a huge frothy head on it that lingers awhile and leaves a little lacing. The nose is wheaty and bready. Maybe some spice and grassiness also. The taste is good. Wheat, some spiciness, bready, a bit dry. Perhaps some lighter fruits in the background. A bit of Saison-like characteristics to it. This is a really good beer."
""
""
""
"This was a really impressive beer. I'm not a huge fan of wheatwines, but this one has depth, character, and a really tremendous flavor profile. I thought for 9% the ABV was well hidden and only added warmth and body. The fruit and hop flavors are tremendous. They alone make this worth trying. In all this is a really good beer. It's impressive and worth your time."
"It pours orange with a frothy head with large bubbles. It smells fruity and bready but my review does not give its fragrance justice because it has a quite pleasing aroma. It has a pleasant fruit taste...maybe apricots and a nice yeast character. Being such a weird style of beer it has a nicely balanced body and great carbonation with what I would call amazing lacing. I would highly recommend this beer to pretty much everyone including people who don't like beer."
""

"I've liked my wheat wines a little sweeter, but fertainly worth trying."

"Highly recommended offering from Boulevard, it's one to hang on to and keep coming back to. But watch out, it'll mess you up!!"
""
""
""
"Pours hazy golden with amber and orangish hues. Substantial fluffy white two and half finger head. Excellent retention and abundant splotchy lacing. Citrus, honey, flora, and peppery alcohol on the nose. Bready as can be but very smooth, light citrus, and white grape skin. Hints of oak...Yeasty-hints of Belgian yeast typical of Belgian tripels. Very malty but finishes very dry with spicy, peppery alcohol. Heavier side of medium body, smooth and a touch of syrup on the edges. Persistent carbonation. Certainly one of the better wheatwines I've enjoyed."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25), one of my favorite Boulevard beers, and one of the better wheatwines available, in my opinion. The oak aging adds a level of complexity without the overpowering nature that can come with 2nd use barrels--it's still fundamentally a wheatwine, calling to mind it's German ancestor, the weizenbock, but with a distinctively American flair."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I dig it. First time I've had it, and definitely one of my favorites from Boulevard's Smokestack Series."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent carbonation. Good overall but not one i anticipate fiending for"
"I've been enjoying Boulevard's offerings over the past few months since they started distribuing to Georgia. Being a huge fan of wheat wines, I had higher hopes for this but it is good (and I'll definately buy a couple more). I like the smooth earthyness that the French oak and yeast give it."
""
""
""
"I really liked this beer. I haven't had too many Wheat Wines and this beer makes me want to seek out more. Lots of flavors with the vanilla, grape, citrus, oak, and others. As with all the other Smokestack series offerings, this one is definitely worth picking up."
""
""
""
"Overall - I would certainly recommend to try this beer at least once. It's not anything to freak out about, make a special trip somewhere that carries it, or anything like that, but it is a solid beer that will get the job done. I would absolutely buy it and drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is not a bad beer, I not a huge fan off all the Belgian yeast notes... Also I wish the hops were a bit more prevelant, I am also not a huge fan of wheat beers, although I do tend to enjoy wheat wines... Decent brew."
""
""
"Pours carbonated cloudy golden with a full white head into my snifter glasses from a 750ml bottle. Looked awesome as it carbonated fruit and wheat flavor heavily in the glass. There is a slight sour with a nice hit of hop along with clove. I definitely will like to get it again to be added to my cellar."
"Great wheat wine. All the complexity you could ask for in perfect balance."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, citrus fruit, and wood. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is fairly tasty but strong."
""
"O: Just such a pretty looking beer. I wish the alcohol was a little more masked."
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, but nothing like I was expecting which I thought it was a wheatwine but it's more like Belgian golden strong and saison combined. But decent flavors, complex and all merge well, although maybe a bit too much booze and carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real solid fantastic memorable wheatwine, will definitely seek this out in the future, very drinkable."
""
""
"."
"Awesome Belgian style ale. Very unique and smooth. Has a citrus flavor to it. Do not pour into a normal glass or you will have a volcano of head overflowing onto your floor. Definitely one of the best I've came across in 2012. If I had to compare this brew with something I've had before it would come close to three philosophers belgian ale."
"Thanks to fLax for this one!"
"D: It is one for sipping for sure, would not be an easy chug."
"Nice job Boulevard – I will have another!!"
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice barleywine. Lots of fruits and while there is some alcohol in the taste, it gets better as it warms up. A little less heat and carbonation and this could be even better. Would certainly have it again."
"Overall this is a decent beer that is probably best drank fresh. I dont think saving this for a year did it any good. While the alcohol and sweetness probably subsided, most of the hop character also did. There is still some but for a Citra-forward Wheat Wine I would have enjoyed more but that's my fault. Will try to revisit and consume fresher next time."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, Batch 2010-1, best by 07/2011. It's got some age on it, but it still should be good. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy dark gold/orange color with about an inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing. The brew smells like wheat, citrus (oranges), white grapes, clove, and some tropical fruit. It tastes like white grapes, oak, peppery spice, cloves, and some wheat/bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with low carbonation. I think this is a decent enough brew, but nothing really impressed me about it. Maybe I should try a fresher bottle next time. $8.99 a bottle."
""
""

""
""
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a white head. Sweet bready malt on the nose with a touch of banana. A light citrus quality, a hint of vanilla, floral hops, and a touch of yeast. There is a light alcohol heat to the palate, but otherwise the booze is fairly well hidden. Primarily a sweet, malty beer dominated by caramel and wheat bread with a nice toast note. A hint of banana along with citrus peel, floral hops, and a touch of bitterness."
"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a slightly opaque orange brown with a massive tan head. Nice lacing as the head died down. Sweet malt and wheat aroma. Medium, bordering on creamy mouth feel. Wheat, bitter, malt in a nice blend with a malty middle with light fruits and bitter finish. The bitterness is a little too pronounced in the finish,but otherwise delicious. This brewery is becoming one of my favorites and this is one of my favorite annual beers."
"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer worth drinking for a long time."
"bottle"
"O: This one surprised me a bit, I'm not going to lie. Most wheatwines are basically pure wheat bombs. This one is balanced nicely. There are a lot of unique flavors that blend surprisingly well. The grape and the oak and the hoppiness really come together to make a very unique brew. I enjoyed it. Without the ridiculous carbonation it could have been a #1 wheatwine for me, Boogoop notwithstanding."
""
"Mouthfeel is light, airy. Overall, pretty solid beer."
""
"Other than the carbonation being too high it’s quite attractive when it dies down. It has a smooth, complex, and enjoyable aroma and flavor. A very nice warm evening sipping beer to be enjoyed slightly chilled."

"M: Medium bodied."

"Poured from 750ml to tulip. After 10 months in the bottle, served cold, this thing pours a massive off white, loose head - great lacing, subtle beading. The nose is reminiscent of a farmhouse ale - estery, clove, black pepper, cereal, dead hops. The taste takes a similar direction. Very well rounded and easy to approach. The freshness of the wheat has succumb to a yeasty tartness. Quite good and very different than its former self."
"Dense texture in the mouthfeel but very little notice of the alcohol for the high abv making it very drinkable. Overall, a very good brew that I enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Alcohol doesn’t taste heavy but don’t let that fool you. Definitely a great wheat wine."
"Overall I really enjoy this beer and would gladly drink it again."
""
"Sadly, this falls into the former."
""
""
""
"O - As a novice of wheatwines I can't make any comparison, but this is a solid beer especially if you age it a while. Delicious!"
"On tap at the Muddy Pig poured into a sampler glass. Pours a hazy deep golden color with a very tall, puffy white head. A strong fresh hop leaf nose, woody, strong notes of lemon and almost mango-ish fruity nose. A light cinnamon or allspice type spiciness, mild woody presence and a full ""sourness"" of the wheat malt at the tail end of the beer. As a whole, this beer has an extremely lively paring of flavors. It starts off with a fantastic fresh bitter hop leafy kick and transitions to a spicy, woody , citrus and light mango fruitiness middle and finishes with a light bitterness with a solid wheat malt presence. Medium mouthfeel and good amount of carbonation. A very nice wheatwine!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a orange-amber-gold color if that makes sense, extreme clarity with continuous bubbles. It forms a hyuge white bubbly and frothy head that is very sticky. The nose really comes into its own as the beer is a bit warmer, belgian style yeast with clove and banana as well as citrus rinds and a touch of alcohol. The taste definitely puts forward some citrus hops with bready notes and a touch of alcohol. It has a medium sticky body that coats the mouth as well as noticeable carbonation. Very good."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being high. Overall it was a decent beer, but not really an outstanding one. The banana and spice were all a little overdone and overshadowed some of the wheat malts and hoppiness for me."
"Mildly cloudy golden hue with an enormous bubbly, frothy off-white head. Belgian yeasts, whole grains, citrus, bananas, clove and some spice in the aroma. Smells almost like a good hefeweizen, leveled and flavorful. Heavy citrus, booze, wheat, banana and clove on the initial sip. Definitely a big hit on the citrus, while pale sugared fruits follow. Some sweet, bitter undertones float along with the rest of the medium to full sized body. Aggressive carbonation gives this brew a big kick. Quality wheatwine styled beer."
""
"Poured out as a nice looking golden color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer was a little boozy somw grain on the nose also. The taste of the beer seemed a little spicy actually which I was surprised about. The flavors of sweet grains and wheat are blended with a semi spicy finish and a hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth but it gave off a good amount of boozy heat. Carbonation was minimal. Overall it wasn't a bad beer but I think I've had better."
"It's a rough and tough beer that seems to be trying to be a lot of things. The Belgian yeast is out of the deep outfield for me, I hadn't expected that. Its over carbonation affects the appearance significantly. I'm a bit disappointed to have to say that this is one of my least favorite Boulevard beers."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied and high carbonation leads to a good feel. Soft feeling and pillowy in the mouth. Overall, one of the more interesting beers I've had lately. Very yeasty and fruit forward. Nice one from Boulevard."
"Thanks, SalukiAlum, for the opportunity"
""
"O - I'm from KC and honestly I've never been the biggest fan of the beers they have on tap in the bars, but this beer, I believe, is worlds above those. It has a full and balanced flavor, aromatic, and smooth."
""
""
""
"O: This was not like any Wheatwine I've ever tried. High quality stuff for sure and much more in step with the ""wheat"" part of the ""wine"" than any others of this style that I've ever tried."
"O: Interesting flavors, and pretty drinkable for the style/ABV. Shows some nice complexity as it warms. I haven't really enjoyed the other wheatwines I've tried, but this is pretty good. Reminds me vaguely of a Sauternes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An above average to OK wheatwine. I have been blown away by some wheatwines I have tasted, but this is not one of them. I would be really curious though to try this with some age. I will say the whole time I was drinking this I was thinking--I have had better in the style--yet I want more...I want more."
"O: Wow!! Simply amazing beverage that is at the top of my list of all time favorites. I truly look forward to engulfing this lush brew again and again."

"O: I‘m sincerely impressed with this beer. The play between funk and sweetness is spot on. I love the earthy notes in this beer, and I love the crisp citrus. This beer is pretty darn good."
"Overall- I like it a lot. If I'm gonna spend the $10 I might take a gamble on something else in that price range instead of buying this one again though."

"Pours a hazy orangish yellow color with a nice 1 finger head that retreats to form a thin white layer on the top. Smells sweet with lots of wheat, some lemon, and some bubblegum. The taste follows the nose really well. Starts off with some honey flavors that are mixed in with some wheat malts. Mixed in is a lot of bubblegum with some more of the honey and a touch of molasses. I am not too familiar with this style, however this is a delicious beer. It is an amped up wheat beer that was a nice change of pace for me."
""

"Outstanding wheatwine, light bodied and kind of an imperial saison, quite interesting."
""
"Overall- This is my first wheatwine and it is fairly enjoyable. It reminds me of a Saison with a toned down peppery taste."
"- I like the unique qualities of this beer. It looks amazing, smells amazing, but the flavor and feel fall just a touch short. This ""wheat-wine"" does have a best by date of 10/10, and I am a couple months past that, but for a strengthy beer, that shouldn't make much of a difference except for perhaps a little lack of aroma hops. Very good beer either way."
""

""
""
"O: well I was a little let down by this. I was surprised by the Belgian influence this beer seems to have, it appears that it is intentional."
"Taste is spicy; hops meld with the wheat backbone but get clouded by the massive carbonation. Plenty of booze character. Medium-bodied but the excessive carbonation really kills any potential it might have."
""
"Enjoyed at the Ale House in Amesbury, MA. this brew shows a clear amber color with a healthy off-white colored head and gutsy lacing throughout. The aroma mixes refined fruity banana clove with a bubblegum hop that really entices the worthy observer. One of the undeniable scents in beer ken. The flavor brings on big bubblegum hop and biscuit clove over cloying lemon wheat sweetness. This stuff is near full bodied with fine carbonation and a luscious feel. A little thick to be sessionable but a no brainer flavor fest for the Belgian-esque full flavored brew."
"O - Overall this is a pretty nice beer. I love the play of flavors with the spicy/yeasty aspects mixed with the heavy citrus flavors. At first, this reminded me a lot of the Ithaca Thirteen which I think is a highlight of 2011...the booziness here makes this less enjoyable but doesn't kill this entirely. I know I'm knocking the booziness a bit hard here but I really find this to be a great beer. I guess I find the booziness to be an ""obvious"" flaw where other issues maybe aren't as apparent. Very good beer!"
""
""
"O - A nice and refreshing higher alcohol brew. The alcohol is completely hidden in this beer somehow. The lemony and bready flavors would lend this beer very nicely to being served with a nice dinner."
""
"Overall this is an awesome beer. It's hugely unique and a real pleasure to consume. I love the nose and the taste has some fantastic subtlety to it. I'm really looking forward to the progression this beer will give me as it warms. Thanks for another great one."

"Overall another very good beer from Boulevard. Not their best, but still an excellent beer."

"Some time will no doubt settle this a bit which is exactly why I'm planning on setting aside one or two. Great now though, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Very interesting!"

"Broke this out at elrogish's barleywine themed cabin weekend."
"Altogether a great wheat wine, and would recommend this to any friend!"
"O - I can see why people would like this beer. IT really is the smell (while drinking) that makes this beer too sweet for me. Alcohol and hops are present, just well hidden. I'm not much of a fan of white wine either so maybe that's why I don't quite get it."

"The Harvest Dance is a very interesting beer. I am sharing with my neighbor...who is also a Boulevard fan. The beer pours a fully primed hazy copper with huge head that is only slightly lacing. The smell includes subtle spice and hop....along with a slight white wine aroma. The taste has hop and spice with a white wine overtone. The mouthfeel is good...the beer was super primed...like popping a bottle of Champaign. Overall it was a pleasure to try this beer and certainly would suggest it to anyone looking for something different."
""
"Boulevard has started distributing to MA."

"This one is a bit odd to me. It's pleasant enough; however, it drinks more like Tripel than a Wheatwine."

"Notes: 2011 Batch 2. Pretty complex and delicious beer. Lots of fruitiness and oakiness with a good hop showing. I really enjoyed this overall, just well made and plenty of complex and subtle flavors. Well worth a try."
"O- Another great offering from the Smokestack Series. A nice amount of complexity and I like the addition of citra hops. Worth seeking out."

"O: Wow, what a tasty beer. Big and bold, full of flavor. I have been having this the last couple of days, but just getting to review it now. Must buy another couple of bottles before they are gone."
"Smooth, creamy, medium bodied, and moderately carbonated. Slick feeling. If you get the chance, try this."
"Overall, not a bad wheatwine style brew and I am impressed with the presence of citrus-like hops here."
"Once again I'm wondering why I waited a year before trying this. The Smokestack Series has been as reliable as clockwork in the high quality of their beers. This is my first wheat wine and I could imagine it's set the bar high for the style. Nice work, Boulevard!"
"O: quite good, I'd prefer a 12oz and I'd have this more often"
"Overall, unique, tasty, smooth, enjoyable beer."
"This is my first ""wheatwine"" offering and I really didn't find it too different than some of the higher alcohol content hefeweizens out there ie. New Glarus Dancing Man Wheat. I really enjoyed Harvest Dance. If it weren't for the obnoxious head that formed after every pour I this would be an easy ""A rated"" beer for me. If and when I ever buy this again I hope I have better results appearance-wise."
"O - delicious beer. Perfect seasonal. Just amazing wheat and hops"
"This is really nice...I don't know if I'd seek it out again, but I'm glad I had a chance to try it. The nose is phenomenal and quite alive...this beer is almost worth buying just to smell it."
"Overall : this is a well crafted beer. Definitely a beer worth seeking out give this one a try I highly recommend it."
"The taste and mouthfeel are SMOOTH. You can feel the wheat gently rolling down your throat as if you inhaled a big Whiff of clean air fresh from big sky country. The ABV is not noticeable in the least."
"Sunset orange beer with golden highlights around the edges. Fluffy white head lingers and bubbles nicely on top until a slow dissipation to just beer. Fresh wheat in the nose with spice and lots of soft fruit--orange peel, mango, pear. Clear, clean spice from the yeast that continues in the taste. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but a nice twang from the wheat and spice, but the fruit lessens compared to the nose. Very nice beer. 9% is completely unapparent."
"Pours a golden reddish orange with a bunch of white frothy head. Looks great. Smells wheaty and boozy. A really nice aroma. Tastes sweet and malty. Lots of wheat on the tongue. Boozy but light and tasty. Very well carbonated. Overall pretty enjoyable especially on a cold day."
"This is the only wheatwine (and the second Harvest Dance) I've ever had, but I have to say, I love it. This is a beer I would keep stocked at all time, especially if Boulevard put it in 4-packs of 12oz bottles for say $11. Just saying."
"Very good beer!"
"Very complex. There's a rawness but it's weaved together in a delicate way. It's fruity, raw, mellow, sweet, dry, bitter, and much more."
"o) I have had many a hef's but this is my first wheat wine beer and I am just not picking up any of the wood notes with it. Overall though very drinkable, especially for the abv but, I would not seek this one out again."
"Amazing, complex and showing beautifully for its age- gets oakier and spicer towards the yeasty bottom of the bottle, which is almost a whole different experience completely. I'm definitely picking up the last few of these in Nashville for the cellar."
"In conclusion - a highly enjoyable ale with not much else like it. I really hope they create this again. Also - how cool is that label art? Would seek out again."
"Overall: A sipper."
"O- The nice fruity esters and bright juicy hops are really supported by the dry crisp finish. The fizz and citra finish is a great combination and the alcohol is really well hidden. Without a label I would have called this an IPA or Imp IPA not a wheatwine. But no matter what you label it, it was tasty."
"Overall I like this one, def a different style with the wheat combined, very enjoyable"
"Medium bodied and slightly oxidized with tight carbonation up front and a prominent dry, earthy hop presence. Pretty bitter with lots of earthy pine and only faint citrus sweetness. Lots of heat and boozy sweetness with sweet malt notes underneath. Hints of caramel, toffee and dark fruit. Not as earthy, leathery as expected with a but more wheat character than the aroma suggests. Faint spice with some bready yeast and orange peel. The bitterness from the hops give this beer a bit of complexity but overall it's too boozy and a bit of a mess."
"CHEERS"
"O: I am quite pleased with Harvest Dance; Boulevard, once again, does not disappoint. I know their beers, especially in the Smokestack Series, tend to possess a Belgian bent, so I will keep that in mind when I sample my next Wheat Wine, whatever it might be. This is, I believe, a great benchmark to have moving forward, and certainly an enjoyable beer, especially if you like their Tank 7 since they share many qualities."
"I've yet to be disappointed by a Boulevard Smokestack beer and this is no exception. It's not the best wheat wine I've had but I like the hop-forward character."
"An excellent example of a style I'm not a huge fan of - this almost changes my mind. Another success from the Smokestack Series."
"Overall, its like a hefe on roids, citrus flavors were nice and the alcohol wasn't overpowering like I thought it might be, solid beer."
"Harvest Dance was orange in color and hazy. It had a large beige head with good retention and decent lacing. The smell was citrus hops. The taste was citrus (grapefruit) with some pepper and a little sweet malt. The finish was dry with some some residual citrus, peppery spice, and a bit of throat warming alcohol. It was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Overall this is a good beer and worth a try."
"Medium to medium big bodied, plenty of carbonation, it has a good mouth feel. Drinkability isn't the greatest because of the alcohol but the one bottle will be enjoyed for some time. I like it and the price was right. And as always, the label of Boulevard's Smokestack Series is tres cool."
"Pours a very pretty brown-orange-golden combination with a huge billowing off white head and a very small amount of lacing. Smells very complex -- for one second it smells like a very interesting deep red wine and then for the next instant the wheat malts flow through and the next a very zesty citrus. Tastes very complex as well -- grape skins, orange, lemon zest, wheat, malts, interesting Citra and noble hops contribute an almost muted bitterness that is very well balanced. There are a few spices in there -- pepper and something else. The yeast is very apparent as well. The alcohol does not come through (which I think is a good thing.) Mouthfeel is medium with a very light carbonation. Drinkability is high. Drank the whole 750ml and wanted more. What a great beer. One of the most surprising experiences I have had with any kind of craft beer. I was expecting this to be a horrible beer and I can't believe I was totally blown away."
"Is is the first commercial wheatwine I've had and it's quite good. However, I wish it would share a bit more in common with its barley cousin... and a bit less with a saison. Still, I can't complain."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. I almost hate to say this as there are so many beers that are in the ""*wine"" style that are stupidly bold, but this beer is really reserved overall. The hops are there in the flavor but don't do much for the finish. That is OK with me, but it seems a little lame for the style. I don't know...this beer is clean and well balanced...which I like a lot. It is just very reserved for what it claims to be, so I would recommend trying it, but don't expect an assault to your palate."
"Atmosphere is very good. Decent appearance, great head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is not too complex, but a little grain with some nice sweetness. Flavor is bittersweet combination of grain, citrus, and honey. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Really wish I had tried this fresh so I could compare this one, especially since Boulevard has pulled out of this area. Oh well - being a fan of wheat beers in general, this one did not disappoint."
"Drink- It's a new taste but it's very good. The 9.1% is well hidden within this big beer. The profile is very nice. I'll have to find some more wheatwines to try. It was dry and spicy(wrong adjective in my head) but all I can think. Maybe musky I guess."
"Overall: I hate wheatwines. Not anymore. This is a fantastic brew and I will be looking for more!"
"D: I've never tried this style before but I found this really interesting--it's kind of like an imperial witte."
"A fantastic beer. The aroma and taste constantly changed as I drank it. Good job, Boulevard."
"Pours a hazy golden-yellow color with a good white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose is pretty nice with a bit of hops in the finish, preceded by a bit of sweetness, citrus, and some mild spice. The flavor has a bit of light pale malt and white with a touch of hops and some mild fruit. Body is medium with a dry finish. Wow, a wheatwine that's actually pleasurable rather than just being somewhat I can palate. What a novel concept. Thanks, Boulevard."
"Overall impression: Orgasm in a glass. What can I say?!?!"
"Beer is medium bodied and a little heavy on the lead off and the finish is oddly dry and bitter. The mid palate is yeast / wheat goodness. This beer is quite drinkable, not as sweet as other wheatwines and not as harsh as some. If it weren't for the dry / bitter finish I would really recommend this beer."
"drinkability: nice."
"Notes: This is probably my second wheatwine I've had and I enjoyed this one the most. The complex and interesting flavors really keep you engaged with the beer. This beer was supposedly past its best by date but I was truly impressed with this one with a year on it. I will be picking up one now to try fresh and another to age."
"Allegedly this was primed with grape juice, which explains some of the nice fruit flavors. I really enjoyed this one and was amazed at the drinkability and light nature of this... never quite had a wheatwine that fit the bill like this, but it was quite nice."
"Very good beer. The hops are a nice interpretation. Keep cranking these brews out, please."
"D - Very drinkable and very delicious, my only complaint is the heat on this one pronounced."
"No surprise, since it's boulevard smokestack, It's just plain fabulous."
"Somewhat hoppy, but this wheat wine is a hint different from the barleywine style. While sweetness"
"The carbination is light and being ""only"" 9% this is one really drinkable Wheatwine, 750ml alone."
"Have to confess that wheatwines are not one of my favorite styles, but I thought this was a pretty tasty beer nonetheless. Nicely done..."
"Very drinkable, I easily drank most of the 750 before starting the review. I think the high amount og wheat makes it deceptively light and drinkable."
"D- Starts out fantastic, but the flat, boring, finish really seems odd and is disappointing. Not all that intriguing."
"Overall, a cellar beer if I've ever had one. I wish I had another."
"D: The most drinkable example of the style I have ever had by far. I really enjoy the style but it is hard to get beers. Really a tasty beer. They need to make this again and again."
"Fruity and spicey nightcap . Good for sipping."
"D- This is really nice stuff. This beer reminds me why wheatwines are one of my favorite styles. On a cool autumn evening this is just what the doctor ordered. Thanks Dan!"
"Even though the final score won't necessarily reflect it, Harvest Dance is one of the best wheatwines that I've had so far. The taste score *just* missed the next highest number. It might be the alcohol talking, but what the hell, 4.5 it is. I'm not sure if Boulevard has plans to release this Smokestack Series beer yearly, but it would be great if they did."
"Pours a wonderful cloudy copper with excellent head and some decent lacing. Very deep malty scent, nice and wheaty with huge spice (pepper mostly) tones. Very nice taste, a wonderful deep and thick wheat maltiness with huge (almost too much) spice flavors (pepper again mostly). Goes down really smooth with almost no hint of the high ABV."
"D-very enjoyable, well balanced and integrated with all flavors being subtle and well presented. Hints of booze in the back but still well done."
"This is a very well done beer, and for my first time trying this brewery and style I am quite impressed with both."
"Dominant sweet notes of unfiltered honey and raw cane sugar, peppery and a little sharp with alcohol a bit prominent in the flavor. Some maltyness rears toward the end wiht hints of Grape Nuts. I've yet to come across a wheatwine that did not struggle to contain itself, and this is a worthy effort."
"A great wheatwine one I would not mind partaking in again. I did hate to see the bottle go"
"Drinkability: A joy to pour down the ole gullet. Go on, friends, and embrace a heavy-handed dose of wheat. I sure as hell did."
"Great beer. Love the tropical hops laced with the strength of the beer and livley character. I've never had this before but I would say this might be peaking now."
"M&D - thick bodied beer that is smooth and coating, nearly syrupy at the finish, easy to drink despite a higher ABV, the smokestack series continues to impress"
"Conclusion: Really glad I got to try this; I tasted it fresh at the brewery (on tap) and wasn't really sure then. The bottle said this was best before October 2010, so I thought I'd give it a shot now, w/some age on it. Eh, it's better, but it's still a bit of an oddball."
"Apricot with blonde highlights and a massive stiff, rocky eggshell cap that lasts a good while and leaves sheets of sticky lace on the glass. Peaches and apricots, wheat malt tang and lemon zest make up the fabulous smelling aroma on this one. The flavor is fruity up front with apricot and pear notes and dry, yeasty and mildly alcoholic in the finish. Full bodied and slightly sticky with ample carbonation. There are a lot of complex flavors melding together to form a really great beer. I think I'm going to hoard all the bottles of this that I can, it is drinking very well right now. This beer is really under the radar for how great it is."
"Poured a amber brown with orangish highlights and had a big 2 finger head. It also left lots of bubbly sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma was big on grains such a wheat yeast and bready notes that was also a little spicy that was made up of cloves, coriander and pepper. There was also faint caramel and honey scents. The flavor was also a bit hearty with the bready yeasy malt make up that had coriander, caramel, and clove accents. In the background I got slight hops and honey that seemed to be aa little tart as well. The beer was medium body with tons of carbonation that had a grainy slight spice and tart finish. It was a taste and intresting smelling brew that astually drank damn good. I've had this one twice now and both times were quite enjoyable."
"D: This is a nice wheat wine. I've only had three at this point, and this has been the best of the bunch. It's another excellent offering from Boulevard's Smokestack Series."
"Poured into a DFH tulip, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head above the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Meringuey head isn't going anywhere fast, snow-coning above the rim, with tons of hunky lasting lace. Aroma is wheat, effervescence, and light tartness. Taste starts with light banana sweetness, goes tart in the middle, and closes with sharp clove character. Alcohol heat and flavor is subtle. Mouthfeel is prickly bubbles, and drinkability is pretty good as well. This one could smooth out a bit, but an enjoyable brew."
"Pours a mostly `clear, somewhat hazed, orange amber topped by lots o' thick, cream-colored froth, which leaves some thick lacing behind as it dies away. The nose is packed with sweet wheat (how's that for a season finale twist), along with lesser amounts of sweetgrass, butter, and sugary caramel. This caramel returns with quite a vengeance in the taste, along with all that wheat, some floral hoppiness, toffee, and a mixed bag of miscellaneous spice rack staples. The overall taste is a combination of light and buttery sweetness and a relatively weak piney bitterness. It's all good. The body is a firm medium, with moderate carbonation and a partially dry finish. A very solid and tasty wheatwine, if I do say so myself. And I do."
"D - Overall, not bad, but not what I hoped for or expected."
"Best by 10/10.Poured into a snifter a clear orange infused glden with a huge blooming white head that sticks like glue as it settles into a frothy mass.Aromas are a mix of citrus,caramel/vanilla,and faint leather.Big chewey feel and not overcarbonated like I was thinking it might be in the mouth.Big caramel and honey sweet notes upfront with some of the leathery component coming thru as well,the finish is sharp and leafy with a big citric jolt as well.Complex to the hilt,with a good combination of sweetish deep maltiness and herbal,citric hop.The alcohol does play a part as the beer warms,but the hops really play a big role in this wheatwine."
"Drinkability alcohol apparent but goood...."
"Sweet grains and tangy, zesty wheat interplay perfectly with a spicy, hay-esque and floral hop flavor. Not an abundance of bitterness and the lingering sweetness is really the only minor flaw I can find in this beer. The alcohol is a touch hot and lends a light tropical aspect. This is easily the best Wheatwine I have had and another surefire winner in Boulevard's Smokestack series. I will be anxious to see how this one ages, as it is drinking mighty fine right now."
"Drinkability: This is the only drawback in my opinion. This one drinks too smoothly and too well. It's 9.1% ABV is remarkably well hidden, and the light, effervescent mouthfeel makes this beer a ""lion in sheep's clothing."" Polishing off an entire 750mL on a work night would not be out of the question, but the consequences the next day would make you seriously ponder how you managed to go back for glass after glass of such a heady beer."
"Like all the smokestack series so far, recommend this one."
"Again, as with seemingly all of the Smokestack beers, I had trouble removing the cork. When I finally got it open, I was rewarded with a beautiful golden color and a good two inches of rocky white head. Aromas of wheat, dark spices, and maybe golden delicious apples. On the palate, I found a nicely balanced strong wheat beer, with alcohol, sweet malt and some nice spiciness. Another good effort from Boulevard."
"Courtesy of Oddefellowe. Pours deep gold with tall nearly explosive off white head. It smells a touch infected with bright notes of wheat, sharp yet not strong acidity, a mild level of banana and bubble gum. The taste is bright and punchy with thin wheat mixing with a bit of acidity and then moving into smooth somewhat sweet banana. If it is infected it wasn't much of a distraction."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer tremendously. It's one of the better in the Smokestack series - a series which has produced some damned good beers. I also have to say it's one of the better wheatwines I've had. Very drinkable for 9% ABV."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly enjoyable brew. The taste had a few detractors, and I can't help but think that what was an accident (the sheer volume of carbonation) actually turned out to be a bit of a blessing, cutting through the thickness in the mouthfeel and providing a basis for a gorgeous appearance. The abv% is actually remarkably low for a wheatwine (9.1%? really?), but it's definitely there after a while. Regardless, this is a solid brew, one that showcases the better sides of a wheatwine (with a few missteps). Worth a try, as most Boulevard brews are. Cheers!"
"Harvest Dance's excellence makes me interested in pursuing the wheatwine style. Because if this beer is any indication, wheatwines are unique beers."
"I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but Harvest Dance is a fairly decent beer. It pours a dark cloudy orange color with a head that sticks around. The taste is also very wheaty, also a little bitter. The 9.1% alcohol is hidden nicely. A good beer for those who like wheat beers."
"So good, can I find any way to improve this...who am I to suggest there's anything better? 9.1%, but much more easier-going than other strong wheat wines I've had lately. Starts tropical fruit, gets dry, and now the alcohol gets a bit of a burn. But still really cool down the tongue. And yeah, there's some oaky-ness, ...one of my favorite beers in quite a long time, highly recommended."
"Too big of bottle for one person. It gets old about half way down. Alcohol is well hidden with herbal spice."
"Notes: It's a pretty solid and nice wheatwine, I guess I prefer a broader and thicker sense in them. Not the top of the crop from Boulevard but a rather reliable brew."
"Of the maltier Wheatwines, a sipper for sure. I'd love to see what this beer tastes like in a year or more. Lovely now."
"D: Heavy, but satisfying. One of the stronger entries I've had of the non-limited Boulevard Smokestacks."
"Taste is citrus rind and hops and spice. It reminds me of a tripel and a pale ale mixed into one beer. This is very appealing. I served this at just the right temperature. Mouth feel is nice and carbonated as well. As I finish this beer I am so glad my son passed. This is one of the best beers I have had in some time. The first wheat wine I have tried."
"A nice amber copper color with big sticky white head. Great retention and lacing. Smell is largely clove, with some spicy fruity notes, some musty and almost smokey notes. Taste is really interesting, some big leafy and citrus hops but also some clove, spice, some tobacco, some sweetness in there too. I'm really impressed. I like this better than the other wheatwine I've had, i.e. Nemesis. MF is a bit over-carbonated, but it definitely keeps it going. Coating, lingering aftertaste. Good drinkability, though the ABV and robust flavor limits a bit."
"pours a gorgeous hazed copper with a fluffy and very lively three finger, pearl head with intense lace. a very beautiful beer. smells toasty and sweet. coriander, bread, and sweet yeast. the taste is dominated by a grassy/earthiness flavor and high carbonation stings. then very nice toasty oak tones set in with a malty, sweet balance. banana (nice), dark and tropical fruit. aromas of funkiness and barnyard/hay as it warms. a bit clingy on the teeth. a bitter finish that lingers for minutes after consumption."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is a massive three inches in height, and recedes extremely slowly into thick, chunky lacing that sticks around until the beer is gone. This beer looks a lot like a really good hefe, and I like that. The aroma is of yeast, banana, pale malt, some earthiness, and alcohol. Up front the taste is maltier than the aroma with the earthy yeast tones kicking through in the finish. There is a nice overripe fruit thing going on that I find pleasing. The alcohol that is present in the aroma is nowhere it be found in the taste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with carbonation that is a bit too high, and seems to get in the way of the taste but only slightly. Overall, this is a very good beer, and one of the better beers I've had from the Smokestack Series."
"D - Very high in terms of flavor but the ABV might get you."
"Verdict: While perhaps a little muddled, Harvest Dance is tasty enough, nicely drinkable, and pleasantly different. Though this is my first Wheatwine, it seems like a solid start."
"Pours a clear, copper color. One and one half inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. There is also suspended sediment present. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, slight hop, hint of wheat, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Wheatwine. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, slight sweet malt, slight citrus, hint of hops, wheat, alcohol, and slight metallic flavor. Overall, good aroma, body, and complexity, but metallic flavor hurts."
"Poured into a chalice glass @ 48 degrees. This is my first Wheatwine, here goes. Pours a dusty copper with an impressive head that is fed by a hefty amount of carbonation. Smells of light fruity esters mingling with a light malt sweetness. Subtle amount of earthy/floral hops noted as well along with some alcohol. Noticably effervescent in the mouth. Light candied apples, sweet malts, light caramelized sugar sweetness, black pepper and honey are picked up in the taste. It is what I imagine an Imperial Saison would taste like, not sure if such a thing actually exists. Full bodied with a dry finish that hangs out for a while. Opens up nicely as the head sttles down and the beer warms up a few degrees. Very interesting beer."
"Excellent offering from Boulevard, who continue to impress with their limited editions."
"One of the very best Smokestack Series offerings I've had, Harvest Dance is nothing short of outstanding. A must try."
"Thanks to Kris D for introducing me to this one."
"Overall, this beer is bomb awesome. Very shocked that boulevard could pull off a style that not to many breweries make and do it so well. I highly recommend this one. Very drinkable."
"Back to the carbonation. This beer looks carbonated but really is not - my girlfriend who hates soda for its carbonation really enjoys this beer. It leads to an almost perfect drinkability - even more so that less powerful brews."
"Very drinkable, great beer, definitely worth seeking out."
"D: Quite drinkable for the style; alcohol is very well masked"
"Flavors were similar, apples and spice with a supple feel and a dry bitter finish. I'm guessing the wheat is responsible for the mellow smoothness. For all the crazy foam it had, it didn't feel super carbonated. Overall it was pleasant, light and easy drinking, especially for 9.1%. Would buy this again, seems like it would be a nice Autumn seasonal."
"Thanks BlueOkie!"
"Strong carbonation and md light body. IMO, not very drinkable."
"D: Dangerously drinkable with the big ABV. Serves well as a sipper, but, is light enough to keep going back to it. Nicely done!"
"750ml corked & caged. My first wheatwine. I sort of expected something like a barleywine, which is to say I expected no carbonation. The healthy ""pop"" of the cork & dense, active, sticky head are a pleasant surprise. It is a dark gold with very active carbonation. Smells of honey, hay, a touch of horse blanket, and a vague citrus. Tastes malty and nutty, with a slight acidic finish. The aftertaste is very pleasantly earthy. The mouthfeel is great. Sharply carbonated and then a light but viscous body. The drinkability is great. The alcohol is just a pleasant warmth going down and that earthy aftertaste is just what the Dr. ordered. Then he ordered me another one. Then I had a nap."
"D: Incredibly drinkable, the carbonation holds it back just a touch. Overall a fantastic beer and if this is a true example of the style then I love wheatwine!"
"Overall, I liked the beer but the carbonation was a little much... A little less would have made this one a real pleasure..."
"Rich layers of tangerine flesh and grated lemon peel hit the palate first, followed by a grassy, almost soapy hop bitterness and a blast of ethanol. Yeast & alcohol add more fruitiness to the mix, notably pear and granny smith apple. I can see the booziness being too much for some, but for me it borders on the right side of harsh, thankfully restrained just enough to add the right amount of warmth and flavor to the back of the tongue and throat. Harvest Dance has a great mouthfeel, too...slick and slightly chewy, but light enough from the carbonation to keep it at a drinkable level. This beer is definitely a sipper--I can feel the booze working after half a glass--but it's a damn tasty one that I will gladly revisit. As per most of the Smokestack Series, Boulevard hasn't missed a beat with this wheat(wine)."
"Overall, this was a great beer - better than most barleywines that I've tried. Definitely worth the search for another bottle."
"I haven't had more than a few versions of this style but this isn't what I would consider one of the best. That would go to the Portsmouth version."
"D. Very good and very interesting. My first Wheat Wine. Too much carbonation IMO. Still have not been disappointed with a single Smokestack Series beer."
"Batch 1-2009. Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a hazy burnt wheat with a massive 4 inch head that just doesn't go away. I had to wait close to 5 minutes, just for the head to recede enough for some beer to actually settle out. As this beer recedes a crazy, sticky lacing is left all the way down the glass. If there were a category just for head retention this would be a 5. At all times there is a good 1-2 inch hat resting on top of the beer. The aroma is extremely complex. Up front is a good mixture of the Citra and Hallertau hops. Mango, pineapple, and just a slight bit of grass fill the nostrils first. Then comes the sweet orchard fruit with pears and red delicious apples. Sweet malts and Belgian candy sugar all come together with just a little bit of Dimetapp. The flavor profile is just as complex as the aroma; I just don't like it as much. The hops are a bit more subdued but still lend their tropical fruits. Overly ripe apples are abound along with yeasty biscuits, toast rolled together in a classic wheat profile. At the very tail of the flavor profile the Muscat grapes used to carbonate the beer really comes through, which leads to my biggest problem with this beer. It's really sweet. Its already a fairly sweet/sugary beer and the Muscat grape juice just makes it that much sweeter. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for such a big beer and it has a definitely effervescent carbonation. I love it that Boulevard pushes the boundaries and I'm excited to see them do it with a Wheat Wine."
"D: Exceptional drinkability. It doesn't taste boozy considering the 9% Alcohol by volume."
"750ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a Tank 7 tulip. Lots of carbonation. Poured a hazy gold with a massive overflowing head. Fantastic aroma of tropical fruit along with some citrusy spice. Aroma reminded me of a California Sauvignon Blanc. Flavor starts of with some wheaty spice and more citrus. There is a fair amount of hop bitterness. Dry finish. Medium bodied and very drinkable for the ABV. Wood comes out a bit in the finish as it warms. A very unique and tasty beer."
"drinkability - i split this bottle with a few people but i could have drank the whole thing"
"I really enjoy this every time I have it. This style really has not grown on me, but this seems like the cream of the crop. Something I would recommend."
"A slow, boozy, enjoyable, complex, unique sipper!"
"Pours orange-brown with a huge, dark white head. The aroma is strongly wheaty, with a lot of alcohol as well. You get some citrus and grassy hops, more than expected. The flavor is wheat with the same earthy and citrus hops that were in the nose. You also get some Belgian yeast. This beer is very carbonated and has a medium mouthfeel. A sipper that changes both flavor and aroma as it warms."
"Overall, this is a pretty mellow beer (surprising given the alcohol), and nothing stands out like a huge impy stout. It is a little far on the sweet side for me. The pouring gets to be a bit annoying too - each pour, I get about an ounce of beer and tons of head."
"Poured a hazy, golden orange with a huge white head. There are also little particles of sediment suspended in the liquid. Aroma was fruity with a Belgian-like spice. Taste is much more hoppy than I was expecting from the aroma. Very fruitty and citrusy with some spice and some oakiness. Another solid beer from Boulevard in the Smokestack Series."
"4.5/4/4/4/4"
"Overall, an excellent beer and another solid Smokestack offering. My first wheatwine so can't say how it compares to others in style but if this is a good representation then I've found another style that I love. Highly recommend. Rotation - avail here in TX. Believe it's rotating in the series and not a permanent member. Gonna try at least one more fresh and then get another to cellar."
"Light to medium body. The overcarbonation really detracts from the beer here. Some alcohol warmth. Overall, this can be a really nice beer but the carbonation is too detracting."
"Got out the Duvel tulip as the Boulevard smokestack series all seem to have enormous heads. The tulip still wasn't enough, difficult to pour without getting 90% head. Very light body, reminded me almost of a grape wine with the dryness. Interesting, but not my favorite from the smokestack series so far."
"Tastes, looks and smells much like a heavily hopped and malted Belgian wit which i guess makes sense. Not a bad thing at all"
"D - A zinger all the way around. It is pretty potent in terms of ABV. Also, I would find that it is a bit filling by its strong carbonation. Lastly, the wild saison like flavors make his beer a certain ""single quantity"" addition to your evening."
"Wish I had something to better compare it, but its an enjoyable brew and I will gladly go finish off the bottle and likely pick up again. Another great smokestack offering from Boulevard!"
"Tastes good. Feels good. Good drinkability. Not what I expected from a Wheat Wine, but not bad. Smokestack Series is always worth a try."
"My biggest knock on this beer is the head. It was aggitating to pour a glass and not even see beer at the bottom. The whole glass was filled with head! I've never seen that before. I'm a barleywine fan and this did let me down a little by comparison. I was expecting a thick ale, but unless Boulevard totally screwed this up, a wheatwine is not too thick. Still, this was enjoyable and I wish I would have drank it during early fall, where I could see it really hitting the spot."
"Drinks fairly easy for the style & ABV, great offering from Boulevard, one of the better takes on this style I've had."
"This is my only experience with a wheat wine but I am certainly going to look for more as this was quite enjoyable. Color is slightly hazy orangish yellow, pours with a huge amount of head but most of it dissapates quickly and only a small amount lasted through the first few sips. The nose on this one came across as tons of pineapple finished off with some grassy notes and a little peppery spice. Tastes like honey mixed with what I imagine fresh cut grass would taste like, toss in some black pepper. Hops are definitely present but not up front as is the case with most barley wines. Really nice complexity, as it finishes with a variety of different spicy notes lingering on the palate. The biggest surprise to me was the lightness of body of this beer. I was expecting something much heavier considering the alcohol content. Overall this was a great buy, just like all of the smokestack series purchases I have made so far. Highly drinkable, possibly dangerously so at 9.1%. I strongly recommend giving it a shot."
"D- Very different. I'm still surprised this is a wheatwine for sure. But I do enjoy it. so hard to complain."
"Wow! A wonderful Wheatwine that has a uniquely Belgian-esk twist to it and warms the soul quickly with a nice complexity. Boulevard continues to create incredibly nice brews for the Smokestack series! Harvest Dance will makes your palate do just that; Dance!"
"D: Very nice. Abv feels much lower than what's stated on the bottle. This drinks like a beer with half the strength. Another Smokestack Series winner!"
"Pours a hazy orange with a HUGE stiff off white head that resists fading and leaves a good amount of Belgian lacing. The smell is interesting...grainy wheat, sweet malt, earthy yeast...this one has it all very fruity, crazy complex with an unimaginable balance that stems from tha vanilla oaky notes...scoring points. The mouth feel is effervescent, tangy and creamy soft. Very light to style. Full flavored, the classic grain and oak treatment persist. A really fine drinker, the 9% ABV is well integrated. Great job on your 20 Boulevard!"
"This is admittingly the first Wheatwine I've ever had. Poured into a wineglass orange with a huge thick head. Most of this head can be contributed to me having just bought it and it was rolling around in the car. But the head had great staying value and great lacing. The smell was of orange and grapefruit scents. Which is what the taste was like. Being my first wheatwine, I can best compare it to a Belgian IPA without the Belgian yeast, and more of a straw dry feel in the mouthfeel. Very interesting."
"750ml bottle $9. Nice orange color with a super-foamy head, I was actually surprised how much this one foamed up. The smell was kind of weird like a belgian style beer, strange and I wasn;t too impressed. The flavor had some tropical fruit just as the label noted but overall it was kind of boring, a little bit of vanilla and alcohol. This is not a beer I would revisit but I will always give the smokestack beers a whirl."
"Extremely complex, though subtle. Exceptional balance. Another unique and enjoyable release from Boulevard whose Smokestack Series has become one of the most prolific big beer series in the industry. Can't wait to taste one after some time in the cellar. Move over Wheelsucker, this is now my favorite Wheat Wine."
"D= pretty good. I'm wondering what is up with all the esters in my bottle and the huge head that blew up. It has been in the fridge since I bought it about a week ago so it has nothing to do with me storing it. Oh well I guess it was delicious none the less."
"As with the rest of the Smokestacks, the carbonation is huge, so be careful pouring. Head is fairly thick and bubbly, and the color is reddish-orange. Retention is excellent, and a thick, somewhat crackled lacing is left behind. Aroma involves the obvious malt and wheat, as well as a sharp citrisy notes that strike at the end, some spice, and a slight sourness. Tastes of pure wheat, more spice and fruits, and a yeasty base with some slightly sweet malts enveloping it all and a middle layer of bitterness that finishes things off to near perfection. Goes down crisp with a nice little alcohol heat lingering in the throat. Boulevard can seem to do no wrong these days, and this is a tasty and unique addition to an already stellar lineup."
"This beer has a flavor that i have never experienced before. It is almost like white grapes and papaya with tons of fruity bitter hops and sweet barley. The new Citra hops are really nice and the wheat helps to enhance the fruity flavor! The oak adds a very subtle dryness and can be tasted slightly during the sip. The color is a mix between gold, brown, and orange with a very thick white head. The head will actually come out of the glass without pouring over the sides. The beer smells like white grape juice and wheat mixed together. Beer as innovative as this is one of the reasons why i love drinking so much. I recommend stocking up on this beer and let it age! Incredible!!!"
"This is my first foray into this style but I'm impressed. It's complex, rich, but not overly heavy. My only complaint is that the alcohol is a bit too noticeable even for a 9% ABV beer."
"Ah, now this is what I was looking for in a Wheatwine. So much more flavor and complexity than the last disaster of the style that I tried. Honestly, I don't see this one getting much better over time, so I say drink them now."
"D: High alcohol % is covered well. Flavor is intense, but very drinkable."
"D-not something I would drink alot of or alot of the time but a beer like this is one I tend to want when the mood strikes and nothing else will do! A nice steak dinner with this would be amazing."
"Body is highly carbonated but really supports the bittereness and overall flavor of the beer. Medium body and really does well to hide the 9.1 ABV. Truly good!"
"Pretty tasty, and though not necessarily my favorite style - it's likely a pretty fair example of it. The whole package is a good way to close out the season."
"Drink: Taste alone make this wheat wine super drinkable. Though it does seem at taste to be slightly more boozy than it is. That could deter some for drinkability. But, this beer is damn fine!"
"Boulevard have proven themselves time and again to be masters of wheat. They just know how to make it do great things. Harvest Dance Wheat Wine is no exception. Its insanely flavored yet very balanced. Easy to drink for the style but also very complex. This is fantastic. You really must obtain some, drink some and age some."
"This is my only second wheat wine style beer. The other was 75th streets wheat wine! So when I poured this I thought it would be darker and sweeter. Appearance is brighter than I expected. Almost copper color, amberish. I can see a bit of suspended yeast and it is a bit cloudy. I absolutely love the smell. I can definitely pick out the citra hops, as I am a regular drinker of SN Torpedo which is the only other beer I know that has this new hop. The taste is very Belgium blond to me. I can pick up the sweet wheat malt all over. Not as sweet as I would like. I think this beer is overcarbed to my liking. I like the beer, but it is not one I'll pick up very often."
"D- Tastes fine but the excessive carbonation takes away as you'll be belching frequently."
"Drinkability? I'll be back."
"D - This is a very good wheatwine. I is delicious and surprisingly easy drinking."
"Mouthfeel is so soft, it feels more delicate than it really is. Carbonation has a tight density. As stated, the retained head adds to the creamy smooth texture. Boulevard has another outstanding beer here. They do extreme beers, extremely balanced and drinkable."
