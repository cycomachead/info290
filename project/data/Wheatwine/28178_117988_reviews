"Bottle from trade but forget who. Big thanks! Big bottle with Batch #371-374 noted on the bottle. Pours dark orange colors with a beautiful off white and creamy looking head on top. Aroma is floral with lots if sweet orange peel, grapefruits, caramel, toffee. Lots of sweetness here. Flavor is spent hops, sweet biscuity malts, orange peels, grass, light booze, lemon zest. Reminds me a bit of Behemoth. Dank with plus body, medium low carbonation. Overall I am glad I got to try this but it's not really my thing. Very sweet, and confused between an old DIPA and a barleywine."

"Overall: a very well done wheatwine. great combo of strong and sweet malts along with very tasty and bitter hops. alcohol plays a large part and goes nicely with everything else in the beer."

"o - Overall a very good beer; I really liked the nose as I thought the fruity and caramel malts worked really well with fresh citrus hops. Worth checking out, would like to have it again sometime."

"O: Well, this isn't what I think of when I think of Wheatwines. Really more of a wheat-centric DIPA. And a DIPA in the PW style at that. But as someone who enjoys DIPAs, I still found the beer to quite enjoyable. A bit hot for my liking, but not bad."

"An American strong for sure and a rich wheat malt make this the wine. Sitting on the fence tween Barleywine and DIPA. Expect richness and depth. Big on hop and 'Big' on booze to confound your session. You not cuuurushing this."

"Pours mostly amber with some a bit of orangish accents here and there. Tropical fruit and citrus on the nose; hints of caramel as it warms. Opens with mandarin orange, tangerine, pineapple, and hints of mango. Caramel shows up midpalate with some soapiness and wheat cracker notes. Low level of carbonation, full body, smooth with a touch of silkiness. A hop bomb, for sure. This brew has just as much in common with most DIPA's as it does with other wheatwines."
"Overall: This one was a weird one to rate. According to style, this is not a very well executed beer. Just overall enjoyment though, this is a classic hop bomb from PW. Bright, fruity, boozy, this one will do the job for you."

"This might not be what I'd reach for when I want a wheatwine but I think it's delicious. It's almost like a double/imperial Gumballhead. Two of my favorite styles in on bottlee- the sweet caramel, toffee, mild heat and body I enjoy in a wheatwine with an outstanding DIPA hop profile. Quite glad to have tried this while it's so freash. An excellent brew."
""
"Mouthfeel is pretty big. Thick body and sticky feel are cut by crisp hop oils and a good amount of carbonation. There is a mild bitterness but it's not overly assertive."
