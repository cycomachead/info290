"Big miss Surly. Sorry"
"Surly Doom Tree -----3.5/5"
"Seems a bit dark and heavy for an English Bitter. Like a souped up version, much more malt driven than I expected."
"we dont get enough good english styles anymore, so this is rad. also, no surly still in colorado, so thanks to my man in omaha for sending this one my way! an esb grain base hopped like an american ipa, thats what this is to me, i get the maris otter malt and the crystal 60 range stuff, and i do get a cool english yeast profile thats less doughy and bready and more fresh baked, not so raw. amber ale seemingly in its base too, with some caramelized sugar going on. hops are enormous in nose and taste, pine family, more woody even than needles or sap, and for me, that screams centennial, although i am not sure what varietals are used here. i think its cool they collaborated with a band on this one, and i think its neat that they did so much with a traditional european style. surly is one of those breweries i go back and forth on, like, is it local hype or is it really all that good. this one pushes me back into the, yeah, fair enough, its awesome, side of the debate, but it wages on. wonderful carbonation and dry enough in the finish for nothing but the intense hops to linger. well made and clever brew, thanks again to my buddy in nebraska for sharing this one! low enough abv to romp on as well, i could drink eight of these without question."
"Very weird taste, even for an English bitter.  It was also kind of syrupy.  I wasn't a fan."

"I don't have a ton of experience with the style but I find that what I want from my bitters are to be very drinkable with just enough complexity and balance of tropical fruit and tea presence. Needless to say, this beer really delivers and Surly continues to put out phenomenally brewed session ales!"

"Doomtree pours a clear hazel color with a small but lacing head.  There is a spicy malty aroma.  The taste is bold, lots of malt comes out, with hints of hop, and lots of spices.  Good body good feel.  Overall its a very bold English bitter."

"Moving on to my first viewing of The Room.  Oh hai, Surly.  This stuff pours a mostly clear ""roby""-amber topped by a finger or so of off-white foam.  The nose is dominated by straight pine, mildly earthy greens, and a touch of grapefruit rind.  The taste brings in more of the same, the pine underlined by a vein of resin that rounds things out rather nicely.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall, a solid, straightforward hop farm of a beer.  I'm digging it."

"F-Good body, a little more carbonated than I'd expect from a bitter, but leaves a nice mouth feel."
"Have you ever put your nose into a dime bag and inhaled deeply? That wonderful sensational is how this beer tastes: dank, earthy, a little bit naughty. This beer is an example of what Surly does best: takes a classic style, and tweaks it ever so slightly, so you can still recognize it, but its juiced up in a surprising and mind-expanding way. Highly recommend."

"I think this just isn't my style"
"Hoppy and delicious bitter. Word."
""
"Looks like a brown ale, dark saison lots of spicy bubblegum yeast."
"Tasted from a 1 pint aluminum can on March 22, 2015."
"O-this beer brings together the qualities of several styles of beer in a very enjoyable manner. It's most like an English bitter but brings in some definite saison and hoppiness that are unusual."
"Not what I expected from Surly - I expected the flavors to be stronger.  I thought it was just toasty and bitter enough.  Good beer!"
""
""
""
"Overly toasted and bitter, but not in an enjoyable way. Different is cool but it's not very good here."
""
"Much like Minneapolis hip-hop, I suppose."

"For a non sought after beer this is really solid!"

"Drinking straight out of the can this beer reminded me of a hopped-up version, slightly spicy version of Spotted Cow. Out of glass the subtlety disappears and it leans towards almost towards Christmas beer. I will drink the rest out of the can at cellar temp."
""
"sweet with medium carbonation somewhat dry finish with fruit /candy"
"Fun and interesting.  This yeast may be too much for some, but with this recipe it is working well."
""
""
"Overall:  PIcked up a 4 pack of Surly's latest.  Doesn't really taste like a bitter to me, seems more on the Belgian Pale or Belgian IPA side.  Lots and lots of bubblegum flavor, which I enjoyed.  I haven't really tasted bubblegum in beer for quite a while for some reason.  An interesting mix of flavors."
"Aroma is fruit, sugar/candy and light bananas/bubblegum. The flavor is fruit, sugar/candy, light hops, bananas/bubblegum, malts and a mix of mild sweetness and slight warming/heat in the finish."
""
""
"Another brilliant brew from Surly. Clasic Surly hop bite but with plenty of balance. Not malty, but other things are here to calm the beast. While it is technically an English Bitter, it is more like they took the best parts of a Bitter and and American Pale Ale and smashed them together."

"I think this is a great mashup that I'd like to see on a regular basis."
""
"Doomtree, look for it local... Very nice malty, spicey, piney, dry finish - explodes in your mouth. Very much worth trying.  Have two of them and you will love it."
"Wasn't for me, spice notes struck the wrong chord."
""
""
""
"Sure. The Doomtree name is enough to make me love this beer. However, it has a subtle home brew taste that made me fall in love with it. Here is hoping that this is not the last batch."
""
"Overall this is a pretty drinkable beer.  Give it a try if you see it."
""

"Bready with a little spice and a lot of fruitiness. Rye shows. Lots of orange. Very tasty bitter. Reminds me of a hopped up bitter brewer. Very well done. Easy to drink."
""
"O- I'd say its a hybrid rye ipa. easy to drink. there is a bit of a leather/ rubber spicyness that some may not like but i think its fantastic. along with a bit of sweet tabacco its perfect. try it. yum!"
""
""
""
"Picked up a 4 pack pint cans. It tastes really good."
""
""
"The smell was great.  That did ut for me.  The feel was of carb and subtle bitter slash roastyness w great smell.  Hmm. Need to sample many more."
""
""
""
"Very little head that stuck around while drinking. Citrus-hop aroma. Nice hopy body with a 'belgium triple'-esq finish. Complex taste that was hard to pinpoint."
""
"This offering just wasn't for me!"
""
""
"Not bad but Surly still overrated"
""
""
""
""
"In a can at the Doomtree pre-party at Tipsy Cow. Spicy Belgian aroma. Tastes like a spicy Belgian IPA. Way too much going on. Not really that easy to drink. Ok beer."

"overall:  interesting and not bad, but it doesn't all come together as well as it might.  I'm surprised to see it classed here as a bitter, though I guess Surly doesn't tend to worry much about style guidelines.  It was described by the bartender as a ""strange love child of Furious and Cynic"".  I definitely picked up on the traces of Furious, and there is some spiciness here, too.  Interesting experiment, I guess, but it doesn't compete with most of their other beers."
"Overall: Unique and interesting. I like it."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty unique and good brew. Good balance of ripe hops and toasty malt with a nice bitterness. It comes off like a blend of Bitter Brewer and the recent Black Aleâ€™s Surly has been doing"
