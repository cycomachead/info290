3.95,8.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Fresh bottle. Pours a pale golden/straw color with modest white head. Nose is fresh with some black tea aromas, grain, and light citrus. Palate offers an expected black tea sort of flavor, soft biscuity malt, medium carbonation, and a rather clean malty aftertaste. Citrusy hops mix in for some balance, but overall malt stands out more to me. Very easy drinking. Delight.","yemenmocha","Apr 23, 2012"

4.03,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer was a special treat for me at the Brickskeller in DC. It is very pricey. I'd call it a full flavored bitter that is very smooth with an unfiltered feel (not sure if it's unfiltered). I don't drink a lot of bitters but give this beer a thumbs up and a recommendation for someone looking for a unique import.","dball","Jun 25, 2010"
3,-17.8,3,3,3,3,3,"I've had this before from cask and it's much better that way. This one poured with a small, cream colored head that quickly faded and no lace. Color is a slightly hazy orange amber. Aroma is malt, caramel, a bit of toffee and hop. Flavor is fairly bland (this bottle was in my cold fridge) and similar to nose. Body is ok and carbonation is a bit fizzy. Fiinish is like flavor and short. Usually I'd rather have another brand. Nothing really wrong with it. Can't imagine finding this someplace and not being able to find something better.","drpimento","Mar 20, 2010"
3.25,-11,4,4,3,2.5,3,"Orange with a slight haze with a thick, eggshell cap of fine bubbles. Great head retention and thick, sticky sheets of lace. Fruity aroma, tart apples, pears, soft malts, and a bit of citrusy hop spice. Moderate bitterness, fruity up front, apples, light citrus. There's a bit of spice towards the end and light, lingering bitterness. It's drier than I expected, which gave the texture a more coarse character and seemed to draw away any significant malt flavour. Light bodied with slightly rough carbonation. I liked the aroma on this one, but it feels like it's overattenuated.","DrJay","Feb 28, 2010"

3.25,-11,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"While XB Bluebird Bitter isn't a bad beer, it disappointed me in comparison to the normal Bluebird Bitter. The appearance is a light transparent amber with a head that dissipates a bit quickly. The aroma has some American and British hop notes, which is nice but nothing too spectacular. The flavor is a bit generic and yeasty for an English ale. Unlike the normal Bluebird, this is another English ale that makes me think that English ales don't travel terribly well.","popery","May 17, 2009"

3.6,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into my Imperial pint glass a clear medium apricot color with about two fingers of dense off white head. No lacing to mention. Smells and tastes of bready grains, a hit of caramel malts and floral, citrusy hops (lemon and orange). Barely medium bodied with ample carbonation and a pleasant bitterness that lasts through the finish. Overall a tasty bitter, but for the price, I'll stick with the regular Bluebird.","ClockworkOrange","Jan 25, 2009"
3.53,-3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours clear amber with a thin creme head. Nose is mild apple tones and bitter edges. Flavor is high on the grain tones. Highly bitter. Feel has a pretty high carbonation.

3.75,2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Somewhat dark yellow in color, with a loose and fizzy head and a good wad of citrus provided by the fruity hops; somewhat pungent with grapefruit. Nice and light in the mouth and with a lightly bitter tang. The addition of the American hops is interesting, but one of the things I like most about British beer of this type is that it's *not* overloaded with hops like so many American brews. I'd say try XB as a curiosity, but for a better example of this style AND an excellent example of what Coniston does best, try Bluebird Bitter. You won't be sorry. And if you still have an urge for hoppy, overly-spiced pale ales, buy something American.","gfreed","Sep 08, 2008"
3.31,-9.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"M&D: overall this is a lightly-carbonated, smooth-enough, medium-bodied pale ale that suffers a little from the intervention of the yeast sediments, clouding the overall balance b/w malts and hops a bit more than what does to the traditional/ordinary Bluebird Bitter.","wl0307","Mar 26, 2008"
3.8,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Flavor is a lightly dry lemon zest, very mild cereal grains, and a touch of biscuit. Highly drinkable. The American hops don't do a whole lot for this beer, and the brewer's notes on the bottle say that they were aiming to miss an APA on purpose. That's where their dart landed; this is a very sessionable, hoppy (for the style) bitter. I'd love to have a pint or four on cask -- good stuff.","shirfan","Beers"
3.9,6.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Great drinkabilty, this one I could easily session on, although I'd prefer to move on after a few, because I'd think the flavor would bore me after a while. If less pricey or on cask, this one would work for me!","russpowell","0"
3.47,-4.9,3.5,4,3,3,4,"This is basically the same beer as the bluebird bitter (see reviews) but they tried to Americanize it with some late cascade additions. As with most European beers that flirt with more hops to create a more American inspired offering, this one just doesn't deliver that true hop character we Yanks have learned to love (at least the hop heads). This is fair play I suppose for all the American brewers who claim they have made a true British/ Belgian/ German/ Czech style, and also fall short.","dedrinker","Jan 07, 2007"
2.95,-19.2,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"It not undrinkable despite odd blend that is ironically helped by its mildness. But, it's nothing worthwile, IMO. It's a nice idea in theaory to blend British (Challenger?) and American (Mt. Hood?) hops with English malt, but it doesn't come through well in this case.","jwc215","Dec 06, 2006"
3.41,-6.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"good drinkability, but needs to commit to being a pale ale a little more to be good. it's got some potential though, a little tweaking would do this good.","kmo1030","Nov 18, 2006"
3.26,-10.7,4,3,3,3,4,"Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head, which maintains retention throughout my entire drinking of this beer. ""ENGLISH PALE ALE with AMERICAN AROMA HOPS"" is what is stated on the bottle. Since I do not agree with calling this an english bitter i'm going to rate it according to the english pale ale style. It smells of light citrus hops(lemon zest as it warms a little), slightly fruity, and maybe some spice. Smells almost of a hefeweizen. Taste is not too different from the smell with the yeasty hefen flavors comming through and the american hops making a fight to balance. The malt flavor is nonexistant with no fruit showing. All in all the taste of the beer isn't bad though. It's dry and not cloying at all with biting active carbonation, citrus and low abv, making it very refreshing. Though it is not what i woiuld have in mind tryign to pull a EPA off the shelf it is ultimately decent and interesting.","mattpetti","May 27, 2006"
2.97,-18.6,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Light fruit-like sweetness on the tongue but did not find it resembling a washed out mass-produced light beer.

3.1,-15.1,5,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,"This is ... interesting. It changes a lot all down the glass, which I could admir despite not exactly liking it. Doesn't bear any resemblance to the regular Bluebird, as far as I can tell.","gentlebubbles","Apr 17, 2006"

3.65,0,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass a dull lightly hazed gold with a nice well retained white head that inches down very slowly leaving a creamy top.The addition of Mt. Hoods for aroma really show thru giving it a ""light"" citrusy character not robust like the bottle says but quite nice I also picked up a touch of mineral and biscuit.Sadly the citrusy character doesnt carry over into the flavor much somewhat dry with a mineral-like quality with that English herbal,"green"" finish.Now this is a nice bitter the aromas were very nice and its very sessionable but I was hoping for a little more oomph in the end.","oberon","Mar 24, 2006"
2.54,-30.4,4.5,3,2,3.5,2,"Would I drink this again? Only if someone told me this was a bottling mistake at the brewery. From the coloration (no reds or ambers to be found) to the nose (no caramels) to the taste (no fruity esters) this is not in the least an English Pale Ale. The brewer doesn't seem to make anything hefeweizen like so it's probably not a bottling error - this just doesn't measure up to other English Pale Ales.","RedwoodGeorge","Mar 20, 2006"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a light copper color with a thick white head from a brown bottle. The smell is all citrusy hops. The taste is predominated by the American hops, there is an English beer lurking in the background however. I think its a real interesting idea to blend the English and American styles as they try to here. I'm not sure its exactly a fair match as the American hops tend to overwhelm. That said, I think this is actually a very good, very drinkable beer that is lighter than many heavily hopped American beers, making for a nice relatively light style. Recommended.","Drew966","Feb 21, 2006"
3.27,-10.4,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Fans of Bluebird Bitter are hereby warned to avoid this beer. It isn't very good and it certainly isn't as advertised. Coniston's hope of a more highly hopped, American-style pale ale with English roots (a fantastic idea by the way) fails in the execution. Bluebird soars while Bluebird XB never gets off the ground.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 23, 2005"
3.27,-10.4,3.5,4,3,3,3,"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild malt scent that boasts of pale, light crystal, and bisquit malts along with a nice hoppy aroma that balances well. The taste is average. It has a very bitter flavor that dominates the taste. It's very citrousy. The malt content is way off balance and hardly enjoyable. It has a fruity yeast element that seems almost sour to the taste. The mouthfeel is average also. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This seemed like a good beer at the first smell, but it quickly dropped in my opinion with the first taste. It's one and done for me.","WesWes","Oct 31, 2005"
3.71,1.6,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was surprised when I got this because it was golden orange and cloudy. I thought is was a hefe at first, but upon tasting, I was corrected. Smells of a crisp hop dryness and mandarin orange. The hops carry over in to the taste but it is backed by an odd Cheerios like grain. Not bad, but different. Mouth feel was heavy, but flat with smooth little bubbles.","DarkerTheBetter","Jul 23, 2005"
3.83,4.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The taste is sweet and malty with an up front citric. Little to no taste in the finish. Very light and quaffable. Not as impressed by this as I was with the regular Bluebird. The American hops didn't mix well with the English style, and may have even been a bit skunked. Still a decent brew.","neonbrown82","Jun 11, 2005"
3.17,-13.2,4,4.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"A noble try at an international merger, but the sum doesn't equal the parts. Stick with the tradtional and classic Bluebird Bitter.","RonfromJersey","Jun 05, 2005"
3.75,2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Hazy light amber with a big bottle-conditioned head that's a little tough to control in a glass. Not a lot of lace though, mostly dots (much better in the second pour, as it warms). Pleasant mild citrus aroma, not overwhelming but slightly astringent. Mouthfeel is lighter, carbonation plenty ample overall, maybe overdone. Granular senses, pithy with black pepper and asociated spices. Malt is fairly ordinary in impression. Despite the American aroma hops, the beer remains well-balanced and tight. Finishes with a bit of tar resin and some exaggerated fizziness in the aftertaste. Drinkable, but a bit unremarkable, not sure why Coniston needs an entry like this, but its an interesting idea.","ADR","Apr 19, 2005"

3.35,-8.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Amber beer with golden highlights, topped by a fine but foamy head. Midly orange citrus in the nose blends well with the very light touch of phenols that have always bothered me about this beer. Hints of toast and caramel. Toasty in the mouth, but overall quite light on the malt flavor and fullness of the body. Carbonation is way too fierce, same as with the original. Orangey citrus hop flavor is restrained. This is definitely a British beer not to be confused with a West Coast style hop bomb.","yen157","Beers"
4.22,15.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"On the palate it is balanced. Easy, hardened shells of honey and caramel flavors contain leafy mints and lemon peel notes that rise on the finish. Cottony tannins and tangy acidity don't quite fill in a gap on the mid-palate. Where's the obnoxious malty sweetness and head-spinning alcohol? Oh yeah, it's a hybrid. This beer's English chromosomes require it to be very drinkable.","putnam","0"
