"Overall: normally I am not that big a fan of English mid bitters due to the massive price in Australia (mainly due to our stupid excise laws and taxes on, well, everything). This is a good-tasting beer for a 3.6% - it is fairly light, but the flavours are there and are quite identifiable. A good price at AU$77 for a case of 24 x 440mL."

"Be warned dont drink it too cold it kills the taste badly"

"Food match: Don't go overboard with flavours on this brew otherwise what's the point? I'm picturing potato and leek soup with crusty bread, or a minestrone, or cream of mushroom, or winter vegetable, or... you get the idea - soup."

"Nitro-can poured into an English pub glass. A rather light golden straw color with perhaps a hint of red, once the entire glass of billowing beige nitro bubbles gradually broke ... Actually looks pretty cool as the bubbles recede and the beer coalesces at the bottom of the glass. Aroma is rather weak and mellow but I do get a tea-like floral and fruity scent along with scant doughy malts. Taste is similarly subdued, with some Juicy Fruit bubblegum, very light citrus iced tea, and dry bitter tea leaf hops putting in appearances. Ultra-thin body and silky smooth ... One of the creamiest beers I have yet to sample and admittedly I enjoyed this aspect. The carbonation is high but feels soft, with little in the way of astringent burning. Good ol' nitro bubbles. Finish does not really linger although there is a persistent metallic tang. I can appreciate this modern English bitter for what it is ... A low ABV brew drinkable in massive quantities. Look elsewhere for robust flavors."
"O: don't expect much from something like this though, once again, it's funny how something like Boddington's manages to stand out in the crowd"

"Final Grade: 3.23, a C+. Tetley's Smoothflow isn't the worst nitro beer I've ever had, but it's definitely not the best, either. This is a mediocre English bitter/pale ale, with no real strong points to counter the typical weak points of this style of beer (weak aroma, mild flavour and flat mouthfeel). At $2.50 a can (and only available in four packs), this isn't something I anticipate I'll be returning to at any point in the near future - it reminds me a little of Boddington's, in that both are proof-positive that imported ales can be every bit as dull and lifeless as North American pale lagers."

"Between the low ABV, smooth taste and low carbonation this beer is too easy to drink."

"O: Decent beer for the style and quite sessionable."

"something of an oddity here, from the nitro can. pours at first like a disgusting milkshake, but makes a comeback into a bronze liquid littered with tiny yeast bits and a dense as anything nitro head just off white and unwavering. the nose is bitter and dry English malts, with some finishing hops and some metallic notes. the flavor is about the same, real bitter on the back end, and a really minerally finish, not particularly pleasant, but not downright brutal either. the longer I sit without taking another sip, the less and less I like the aftertaste, just not quite right. the feel is weird too, with the head being thick like taffy, and the body of the beer itself being much thinner, and way under carbonated after all the nitro juice is gone. this really was a let down, as I thought itd be like a boddingtons cream or something, but this is way inferior to those. in the end, I can get through a can okay, but this just isn't as good as it could be. the 3.6% abv is curious as well, not sure if its a pro or a con here, but that's inconsequential at this point. so-so at best."

"The taste took its time to arrive because of the coldness, but it turns out the beer is slightly malty and semi-sweet throughout. Fairly smooth in texture as the name suggests, although I think smoothbland rather than smoothflow would suit it more."

""
"looks great but I'm sure its all nitrogen, pretty tame without a whole lot of flavor and the feels a little lame, basic beer I wouldn't go looking for"
""
"Drinkability: It is canned British ale. Tasty and decent, but nothing special. Enough said."
""
"This is one of the least flavorful beers I've ever had, right up there with Coors light. This review is therefore sparse, as I just don't have all much to say. It's not awful, certainly, as being awful would require some flavor of some sort. It's just hardly even there."

"O: This beer is quite sessionable; I would have no problem drinking this beer all night long. The smell and taste could be a little stronger, but the mouthfeel from the nitro-can helps to keep things a little interesting."
"Tetley's was once the embodiment of real ale. Now, it is nothing more than a damaging testimony to the state of beer in England. The fact that an ale so insipid and uninspired can be a top-ten selling brand does not speak highly of British palates. However, I will concede that, insofar as mass-produced beers go, one could do much worse. That is in no way an endorsement, but it is about the most positive thing I can say."
"The Crack immediately caused The Surge, a massive off-gassing of what I assume to be N2. It is always good to read directions and I followed theirs to the letter. I employed a gentle Glug, running the beer down the side of the tilted glass, where it began a beautiful cascade upon arrival at the bottom. I was left with a dense, thick finger of tawny head head with excellent retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a pleasant biscuit malt quality. Mouthfeel was full and creamy thanks to the N2 presence. It was light in its flavor, a biscuit/cracker-like semi-sweetness, but still quite pleasant. Finish was likewise semi-sweet with the maltiness lingering well after the swallow. The low ABV makes it a sessionable CANdidate by even Ding's standards, but I am afraid that as a hophead, I would need more bitterness to sustain me."

"O: Extremely easy to drink and very sessionable - you could literally drink this beer all day long with the low ABV and light body. A very mild flavor and aroma to this beer but still quite enjoyable."
"Overall: Tetley's Smoothflow tastes alot like chilled Tetley tea."
"Taste-Mineral malt, light and creamy. Very smooth and sessionable at only 3.6ABV."
""
"Not very good - doesn't live up to it's description as an English bitter. The mild aroma and flavour are bland and characterless. Looks the part and the mouthfeel is OK, but overall this is just dull. Another macro ale with a nitrogen gimick. Give it a miss."

"From the 440 ml. can marked 15/09/12-05:33-B1316N2. Sampled on February 23, 2012. It is a nitro can so the head explodes into the pint glass and nearly engulfs the whole glass. Once it settles down it has the appearance of medium amber with fine clarity. The aroma is full of sugar-sweetened malts but little in the way of hops. The body is light like a 3.6% ABV beer should be. This has a decent bitter flavor with an accompanying smooth sweetness."

"O - Mild English Bitter taken too far."

"Incredibly easy to drink, but pretty boring stuff!"

"Pours amber with a one inch off white head that lasts all the way down. Fair amount of lacings. Smell is grains and malt. Taste is malty with a fair amount of bitter hops. Mouthfeel is quite good. Creamy with minimal carbonation. Fair imitation of a pub pull. Drinkability is awesome. At 3.6%abv this is the original session pub ale."
"O- There is not a whole lot going on in there, but there isn't anything unpleasant. an easy beer to sit on and have a few through the evening, especially with the lower ABV. Its not a great beer, but its better than average, and by the end of it i wanted (and had) another."
"Tetley's is undoubtedly my favourite ""mild"" and probably my favourite low ABV beer overall. Its great for lunch meals or any other time you may want a decent malty taste without catching too much of a buzz."
"Drink - The beer really has a fantastic look and is a nice easy drinker. I could easily session this beer all night long. Worth seeking out."
"Overall - it's pretty similar to Boddington's"

"Overall a very decent beer that is just tasty, and certainly one of the best looking beers in its category."
"Overall a decent nitro ale."
"D - nice foamy head thanks to the nitrogen. The flavor is an appealing mix of grain and breakfast tea."
"A nice, pleasant enough, and refreshing mild bitter - like those low-fat snacks that still taste good (huh?) - you just want to, and will, consume more of it. My only prior experience with this offering was an unexpected foray into the lunchtime wait line at a fish 'n chips shop in a working class area of my city. While me and me mates (one of them was an ex-pat, so, well, there) stood around, we were unexpectedly offered a pint to while the time away - and this was one of the very limited options. It kept us blissfully happy, is all I can say."
"Notes: What really is distinguishable about this is the mouthfeel. Pretty light but extremely creamy, interesting beer that's worth a try, seems to fall in the category of a good transitional beer."
"D- Very drinkable, but better on tap."
"D: Goes down easy, there's just not much there selling me on this beer."
"A wonderful beer."
"Light body with a creamy head, almost flat carbonation. Very smooth and creamy without any heaviness. This and it's pleasant but simple flavour profile make it really easy to drink. A clean tasting brew at such low ABV is extremely sessionable."
"D- Very low abv and mild flavor make this a decent session choice. Not really a top choice in my book though. Availability was the main factor driving this purchase. It was the best available at the quick stop, and they were sold out of Guinness."
"What a great looking beer. The solid white head rests over a dark amber body. Some solid lacing is left on the half pint glass as the beer quickly disappears. Very creamy texture. Some floral hop notes on the nose. A chalky dryness on the palate. I really enjoyed the half but I wonder whether I could do to many."
"enjoyed it at a Saracens rugby match on vacation"
"D: Not a terrible beer and one that Icould drink plenty. But there are a lot of other beers that could replace this one on the next round."
"d: the menthol flavor is quite weird but on a hot day it could be a pretty quenching ale; i suppose you could say it is the newport of beers"
"this brew pours very well into my pint glass.A very nice light golden color with a very creamy head that sticks around the whole way down.This beer is a low to medium body,as for mouthfeel i thought it was rather watered down but went down smooth.Great flavor overall but the wateryness takes a little away from the malt.finishes slightly dry.Very drinkable beer,i enjoy this brew and recommend to all."
"A very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"overall, not a bad bitter. highly drinkable and no real low points."
"Other comments: What can I say? It's a nitro-can. I hope no CAMRA members spot the fact that I drank a nitro-can and revoke my membership!"
"This is really a gently drinkable beer of very little character. The nitro softens everything to a gentle almost tasteless foam. All in all it's a laid back beer with a pleasant enough vanilla caramel flavour. Not a quality drink, but nothing revolting about it."
