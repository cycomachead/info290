3.42,-5.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"one of the better beers at grittys I though, which isn't saying a whole lot, but this classic bitter and amber style fusion worked out pretty well. pours a lighter amber color, flat though, like all beers I had here. smells like light English pale and crystal malts, with the same ale yeast as the others, and a pronounced English hop finish, which is this beers best feature. the taste is the same as the nose, lighter than it looks, sessionable more than any other beer they had. carbonation is severely lacking, as it has the texture of tap water. plenty of body for the style, maybe a nitro tap would liven this up, but it just sits there dead. still, one of grittys better beers, went well with the food, and didn't offend me like their ipa did, so that's a start.","StonedTrippin","Aug 18, 2013"

2.78,-23.2,3,2.5,3,2,3,"Served on cask and poured in a true pint, the beer is a clear, pale chestnut coloring with a light, foamy, frothy off-white head of about a half an inch. Aromas of rich toffee and caramel, with a slight roasting characteristic overall. Flavors are smooth, with toffee and butter sweetness, and a kiss of chocolate. Hops presence is extremely minimal, with only a hint of bitter at the tail end. The hops presence does build as you drink, but still a minority player on the palate. The body is very light, and there is a smooth and creamy texture that completely owes itself to the cask serving. The aftertaste is a slight linger of the toffee sweetness, with a slightly drying finish. Flavors and overall experience of the beer aren't bad, but there just seems to be an overall lackluster feel to it all. Palate seems watered down throughout, and nothing really jumps out at you.","GarthDanielson","Feb 16, 2012"

The aroma was subtle (yet again), a blend of crystal malt and some hoppy bitterness. The flavors were good, but unremarkable. Some malt sweetness at first, then pale malt and the bitterness towards the end. But for a ""Best Bitter"" it was awfully malty. Still the hoppy, crisp finish was on-point and it did strike me as rather well balanced. The mouthfeel was decent, the body medium and the carbonation pleasant enough helping it be sessionable. Not bad, but a little off-style.","thekevlarkid","Jan 31, 2009"

However the aroma is a pleaasing mixture of malts and maybe something a little citrus like. I think its body is average to above average. The taste is kind if bitter or sour and it ends dry. This is one that I enjoy and drink it often.","puboflyons","Jan 17, 2009"

Solid head retention with a nice brewer's lace along the glass during drinking. S: No overpowering nose or aroma of mention. T: Excellent, in my opinion. My impression of a session beer. Not sure on the ABV, but highly drinkable. Slightly hoppy, with a lingering citrus and piney taste. A great gateway beer to bolder or bigger brews. M: Mouthful was full, but not overly. Easy to swallow. D: This is a drinkable beer in every sense of the word. Labeled a ""Bitter", maybe closer to a lighter pale ale. All around an enjoyable beer.

3.82,5.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a nice dry English Bitter. It pours a clear golden, slightly amber color with almost no head, lacing, retention. The aroma is English hops, cracked grains, some maltiness in the backbone, also some huskiness. The taste is pretty buttery, perhaps a tad butterscotch, but clearly with English hops, a coarse graininess, a drying finish, a tad bit caramel malt. There is a slight saltiness in the finish. This is modestly carbonated, fairly light bodied, overall not too complex, but a good English Bitter and worth seeking out. L'Chaim.","albern","Nov 21, 2008"
3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Longneck bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Best enjoyed before February 2009 notched on the label. Airy white head atop an amber colored liquid and extremely clear. Head drops to a slight covering with a bit of stick to the sides after a short time. Buttery aroma with grain husk, caramel and esters. Flavors include toffee, caramels, light toast, butterscotch, and finishes with a moderate bitterness and appely fruitiness. Feel is medium with prickly carbonation. This is an easy bitter to drink - pleasing malt flavors balanced out by an adequate carbonation and interesting yeast character.

The taste is interesting. Sweet toasted malts underneath some very bitter flavors that I can't put my finger on. The aftertaste isn't as bitter as the rest of it but overall, it is a bitter beer.

I don't mean that in a bad way, I just mean its there flagship brew that is solid, simple and easy to drink.

A bit of a toasted corn taste with a nice malty finish. Carbonation is powerful throughout entire tasting. I find this beer to be extremely drinkable, basically a session beer.

The hops are a bit odd for me, I can't tell if they're jujst grassy or hae been skunked. The flavor profile is a bit low, but this is a style that thrives in casks anyways. Reminds me of milder version of my local Syracuse Pale Ale but a little more delicate.","tempest","Feb 21, 2007"

The smell was nondistinct. The taste was a malty sweet and bittered mess. The aftertaste was a bit sticky on the back of the tongue, but not distractingly so.

It eventually died down to about half, but when the beer arrived, it was about 1.5 inches thick and you could almost eat it with a spoon. Deep orange brown, crystal clear and minimal carbonation. Really low aroma. Medium - mouthfeel. Taste was of pleasant biscuityness, with a small citrus burst at the end. Just a small dollop of diacetyl, not a drawback with this one. Would make a good session brew.","PatandDavid","Jan 30, 2006"

An okay mouthfeel, not too many bubbles, and fairly drinkable. This was nothing spectacular, but it was a solid brew.","scooter231","Jan 24, 2006"
3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Crystal clear faded apricot colored with a thick and foamy head an inch high that sticks around long. Faint smell of a mix of bready malts and citrusy hops.

Mouthfeel is full and round, low carbonation. Reminiscent of a traditional English bitter style.","far333","Jan 16, 2006"

This is ther first beer that it might actually work in though. I would like to see a little more hop and malt character carry through. The flavor is right with the nose. Big diacetyl with just a hint of hop hanging in the background. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Another brew that could use a diacetyl rest. I don't think I would try and find this one again.","kmpitz2","Jul 26, 2005"

Aromas are subtle, but fresh grassy hops, and biscuity malts are prevalent if you look for them. The taste is more about the hops than the malts, but this still isn't one of the hoppier bitters that I have had. The malts are in good show too, but neither the malts or the hops take center stage. This brew is about balance and drinkability. Mouthfeel is cask goodness, smooth and light and oh-so-drinkable. not a bad UK beer from a Maine brewery.","francisweizen","Apr 14, 2005"

The smell has lots of lightly toasted biscuit malt and a good hop aroma. Very well balanced. The taste also has that biscuit malt flavor, a little bit of hay in the middle, and a sharp hop finish. Nice and crisp. A bitter that's actually bitter! The mouthfeel is incredibly thick for the style. The drinkability is great too. Another nice Maine beer!","SheepNutz","Nov 12, 2004"

Medium bodied, light balanced ale. Malt is soft and nutty, minor hops balance things out but dont exert themselves. Hint of butterscotch also noted.

A handful of caramel malts buttressed perfectly by a quite mild hop character. Authentically British. Lemon in the finish. Creamy, thinnish mouthfeel. Some metallic water qualities. Solidly flavorful, enough to keep me interested without inflicting palate fatigue. Brings back memories of huddling over a table in Gritty's pub in Portland Maine.
