"Belhaven Best is undoubtedly Belhaven's worst. What can I say? I guess you gotta make money somehow and, for reasons that I'll never understand, the majority of beer drinkers prefer something insipid, predictable, and undistinguished. I can't blame the marketing department for being unable to pass-up the ""The Cream of Scottish Beer"" tagline but I certainly don't have to support it. Nevermind a repeat purchase - this is a beer I wish I never bought in the first place."

"For the four-plus years we lived in Scotland, Belhaven Best was the beer on which I always fell back. It was so creamy and smooth -- with taste -- that I esteemed it the ""Best."" I also like really hearty beers, of which Belhaven Best is not; but for everyday drinking -- especially with meals -- I loved Belhaven Best. It's like the Irish Guinness when poured in a glass. Lots of gas that needs to settle out. What's left is a great, smooth, TASTY beer!"

"Overall - Not a bad beer to me a bit of a cross with English Pale Ales. While decent there's nothing spectacular about this either. Worth a try."

"Clear, light amber in colour, with a thick, rich, creamy staying head. Faint hop aroma. Taste is very light, subtle and creamy. A delicious balance of soft malts carrying faint notes of nut and caramel. Faintly carbonated, and mouthfeel is very round and smooth. A very delicate yet full-flavoured beer."

"Smell of sweet malts, maybe some wheat beer aromas, no real discernable hops. Taste is thin with no one flavor jumping out. I don't want to say bland, just not alot going on. Average taste and flavor, thin body and mouthfeel. A drinkable sessional because it won't overpower your taste buds, or fill you up. Not sure about it being 'the best'."

"At only about $2 a tall can this is a decent bitter with the creamy mouthfeel of a nitro can. The beer is certainly not too complex but I enjoyed the toffee notes and the smooth finish. As Fall approaches this is the kind of easy drinking beer that replaces the wheat and light lagers from the summer. I prefer the Courage Directors Ale in cans for the same price but I will buy some more of this brew."

"Overall - decent, but not somethign I'd seek out."
"O: A decent bitter. Obviously much better on tap."

"Final Grade: 3.35, an acceptable B minus grade. Good stuff, and as a bonus for any frugal UK ale fans, it's quite cheap in these parts as well. Hopefully the LCBO keeps bringing in Belhaven's Best, because it's easily the best nitro beer I've picked up from there in years. Simple, yet solid. Worth a try, but not something to move mountains in search of."
"I was a bit surprised with the nitro can. I'm used to nitro widgets only being in Guinness. Anyways, this bitter pours out an amber colour with a thick, white, creamy head. It goes downhill from there. The smell has some light butterscotch, grassy hops, tea like aroma, honey, and an odd smell that I can't quite described. Something kind of, gassy. Tastes sweet with toffee and malts, with a hint of brown sugar. Some grassy and citrus hops cleans the palate afterwards. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Overall, a rather disappointing English style bitter."
""
"Doesn't make that great of an impression, I would imagine this is the type of light mediocre domestic fare that folks in the U.K. chug down without thinking twice about. Glad I managed to just pick up a single of this stuff."

"Final Thoughts: I touched base on it on the mouthfeel, but I honestly wouldn't mind trying this beer without the nitro. I will say this though, this is probably the first beer I've had where I actually wanted to see a bit more bitterness involved. Still I'd recommend it regardless, but that being said I can't stand IPAs so take from that what you will."
"D - Easy drinking, moderately flavoured brew. A true sessioner."
"Pale amber orange colour, nearly 2 fingers of dense white head, some lace left behind. Smell is biscuity malt and caramel, graham crackers, faint traces of honey and at points some floral notes. Taste is pretty biscuity and malty, oddly metallic, light fruity and floral points in aftertaste, light underlying bitterness throughout. Mouthfeel is light and fairly watery though the medium body makes this fairly creamy on the tongue, minimal carbonation. This was juts OK, nothing overly interesting and if that metallic taste wasn't there that would help its case quite a bit."
"I little on the fizzy side, like most keg bitters, but I still enjoyed this: the only non-cask ale I had during the crawl."
"Overall – This is a very drinkable beer that has just enough flavour to keep it interesting and sessionable. The appearance is fantastic in the glass and it was priced fairly reasonably. I'd buy it again."

"D: To be blunt, the beauty of a nitro-can can't make up for the blandness. If you need something light-flavoured and easy-as-water to drink, it's a fine choice, but otherwise not really worthwhile and not much of a bitter at all."
"If canned pub ale's what your after, I wouldn't put this at the top of my list, but nor would it be near the bottom. It tastes fine, inoffensive, and the low ABV is a plus if sessioning's the thing. It's cheap in Ontario so I might get it again."
"A lovely beer, in the tactile sense, this goes down so smoothly, the nitro puck really doing its thing. However, for a bitter, there just isn't enough, well, bitterness - and that's not doing its thing. As enjoyable as this seems to be, and even with the senses-preserving ABV, this fundamental lack would prove tiring, and somewhat cloying, whilst considering a night's iterative rounds."
"It certainly isn't bad, but just not as smooth going as I remember. The smoky notes in the taste and sourness in the finish are a bit off-putting for my current palate, but it goes down quite easy after a pint or two."
"This beer poured out has a nice looking deep copper color. The head was creamy looking and white. The smell of the beer is malty and has some nice sweet grainy aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer has a subtle sweetness upfront that fades into a dry bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel is light but remains creamy. Overall I enjoyed the beer, I like most of what I've had from Belhaven thus far. Not a bad brew to try."
"The drinkability of this beer is very high. I could totally sit in a pub and down several pints of this. I might even buy this again if I was in the mood for a light beer with some flavour."
"O: I liked this one a lot better on cask. Starting out less than terrible, but as the head got consumed, quality plummeted. Not bad enough to pour out, but I won't be having any more Belhaven from a can. Stuff like this is why people think they don't like beer. Needless to say, not recommended."
"Pours a nice mid copper with awesome head and lacing. Nice scent with good malts and a nice light earthy bitterness. Good flavor with good malt backing, a slight toffeeness underneath, and good earthy hop aftertaste. Extremely smooth, almost cask like! Good stuff."
"It is pretty popular here in Scotland, although south of the border i am not too sure, but i find it unlikely to be so widespread."
"D: Easy to down a few of these over a meal and not bat an eye, too weak for my taste. There are other better bitters, move along."
"I had this on tap (assuming it was nitro) at Twisted Kilt in Toronto. Pours a copper orange colour with a finger or 2 of creamy white head. Head doesn't dissipate at all, with some lacing all the way down the glass. Smells very mild, some floral hops and biscuit malt. Flavour is just mild bitterness, a bit of sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel, I'm pretty sure this is on nitro. An ok beer, nothing too great though."
"Not a bad beer it would be good with standard pub fare."
"This Scottish ale was poured from a nitro can, and the appearance was darker than a Boddington but a tad lighter than a Kilkenny. Taste was a mild bitter, not at all displeasing. Mouthfeel was very creamy as are most nitros. I only had one, but this could easily be a session beer."
"Doesn't look horrendous but that uniform foamy head was a sign of things to come. Almost devoid of odour this tasted slightly tinny at best. Body was fat and bloated letting very little resembling flavour escape. Like an over inflated tire about to burst to be honest. Considering the brewing legacy here this is not a beer which inhances Belhaven's reputation."
"Excellent honey in color, but with thin off-white head, lingering for a long time. Sweet bready malts in aroma. Smooth caramel, almost neutral, slight hop ensues. Dry and strict in character ale, I would spend my money on something else, more spectacular."
"Overall, I'd say this beer, like nearly all beers, has its time and its place. It's a good interpretation of the style and I think it's been amped up a bit since it was first put into this system, jumping a percent higher in ABV. Pints of this can easily be crushed, but on most days I still prefer a full flavoured, savoury beer over a quaffer frothing froth quaffer like this."
"MF/D: easily drinkable as a session beer as there is not much flavor. almost flat, but very light would be the obvious conclusion."
"Overall, still a drinkable beer."
"Tasting notes October 2009"
"Suits my taste for a low-hopped ale, though I actually prefer Belhavens Scottish Ale, but it's not so easy to get in pubs. Not nearly so attractive in cans, even with the little nitro bomb inside."
"Fairly average bitter. Very easy to drink."
"This is not a bad bitter. Just a bit boring. The nitro does not help in that regard. I would like to try this on cask, but as is you can do a lot worse."
"Totally drinkable, decent brew for the style (is on-tap bitter even a style???) anyway, does the trick on a nice Glaswegian Sunday afternoon for 4.99 with a Sunday roast!"
"One of the best beers i've tasted from Scotland. Brownish in colour with dominant burnt/caramel notes [both on the nose and taste] probably due to the pasteurisation regime in goes through. Very drinkable especially in the wet/cold scottish atmosphere."
"I would drink this if there was nothing else on offer, but it is no better than any other manufactured beer out there, especially with the number in Scotland. If you are desperate for manufactured beer then McEwans Export or Tennents Special are both, in my opinion, better alternatives. This lacks any real taste, not sure where Best came from, they should be sued for misleading information."
"Note: I actually can't remember whether this was keg or cask, so I'm guessing keg."
"It's definitely a mass market brew, but tastes good enough to do in a pinch. My marks might be adjusted downward to account for the fact that it was 1. on the golf course, and 2. free. Very nice!"
"Weak watery body on this one ruined what could have been a decent session bitter...just too weak for me....2 or 3 of this diluted concoction and you feel water-logged."
"On Tap in a pub somewhers in Ketih, Scotland. This is on nitro..i think. After the cascadeing effect has finished. Its a nice enough looking pint brown with hints of garnet. Lovelly tan creamy head . Not much aroma to this.But it doesnt stink. Nice actually, caramel/toffeeish hints in the flavours. Malts are slightly roasty. Nice on the palate, very smooth. Overall drinkable yet uninspiring. This seems to be taking over in my old neck of the woods ( NE Scotland)."
"Upgraded rating based on 1.5 years later on tap at Abbot On the Hill, but still poor."
"D - Drinkable for the style. Although i cant find anything make me feel this ale is moreish. Would not go out of my way to get a glass of this again."
"Smooth and creamy in the mouth, good body and superb nitro-carbonation, make this tasty brew a pleasure to enjoy. I was very suprised by this one, had never heard of nor tried it before. I recommend it and will drink it again in the future. Cheers!"
"It was an average English Boitter, but to me that is more than adequate.An obviously quaffable beer , but not one I would actively seek out."
"I had this one at the Castle on King in Kitchener, ON. The pint was a clear amber colour with a dense, cream coloured head from the nitro tap. Head retention was great and it left lacing down the entire glass. Aromas were very mild, with some fruity esters, subdued hops, and a bit of caramel malt. Same in the flavour department, with malt and hops lingering for a short time in the finish. Low carbonation with a light body and great balance. A great session beer."
"Overall impression: Not bad .. interesting to try something different, but I won't be seeking these out again."
"An easy drinking beer and non-offending to the taste buds, but it is just a nice mild beer that isn't particularly outstanding."
"Great looking, shitty tasting. The beer had so much potential and then it just failed to impress. It started out nice with a beautiful nitro pour with a densly packed white head and a nice clear carmel color. The smell was not good at all with a prevailing sourness that turned me off from the get go. The taste was not one that I would care to experience again with its overly woody/raw hamburger meat aftertaste. Not recommended at all."
"Pours a pale copper color with a frothy, off-white head. Subtle aromas of sweet, earthy malt, light hops and an undercurrent of fruitiness. There's a slight sweet tea-like malt twang to it, a bit of buttery diacetyl, and a slight bitterness in the finish to round it out. Overall, it's rather weak, but it's to be expected. It's a little too balanced towards the sweet side, and the metallic-like taste that shows up after the first couple of sips really takes away from what could be a good bitter."
"This isn't Belhaven's Best. Down right terrible. Perhaps it was a very old 4 pack of nitro's, but this was unbearable. Poured out a an amber/brownish color with a huge head from the nitro can. The head never really did setlle down. Smell consisted of malts, caramel, and toasted aromas. It was on the sweet side mostly. Taste was almost the same. Very sweet and some metallic notes could be detected as well. Just very unpleasent and avoid this brew at all costs."
"14.9 ounce nitro can (oddly enough it made no mention of the widget on the can) - $1.60 a can at Asheville Wine Market."
"You know a beer is gonna be rated poorly when its best feature is its head and carbonation. The widget does an amazing job here, if you like LONG lasting creamy super fine bubble head and amazing creamy lacing. Otherwise this was a stinker, minimal flavor, no hops, metalic tastes etc etc. Back to the drawing board for this one."
"Another perfect nitrogen-corrupted head on this beer. Somehow the texture of nitro beers really detracts from the brews other characteristics. Below the head is a tawny colored liquid. Aroma of caramel maltintensely so. I really liked caramelized sweetness of the smellunderpinnings of fruitiness and maybe a tad diacetyl, but pleasingly so (I think that the nitro-texture gets in the way when looking for the slickness). Mild hopiness, moderate to high-sweetness. The hops dont do a good job balancing the sweetness, and by the end of the brew, it becomes a little cloying. Worth a trymaybe even two or more, but not worth going out of your way to find."
"really nice looking beer, with a thick super creamy head that lasts to the bottom of the glass, with lacing all the way down. mild nutty slightly smokey smell. nice and mild malts nuttyness with a liottle bit of that smoke in there, real mild hops that aren't very distinctive, but present. mouthfeel is the very thinner side of medium, but well suited i think. the drinkability here is very high, it looks great has a good taste, and is low on the alcohol, i feel like i could put 6 of these away and not even notice. i would like to see a little more power behing the taste though."
"It looked great as it poured and settled. The taste is similar to Belhaven's Scottish Ale but much more creamy. All the flavors are somewhat muted but, for some reason, this works very well. There is a toasted flavor upfront and a bitterness in the after-aftertaste. This beer is oh so smooth and one I can see myself returning to."
"I knew this was a low abv, so my review reflects that. Typical nice nitro head and decent caramel color. Smell was lightly malty with a bit of a smoky quality. Taste was smoky in a nice mild way...a definite session brew, Mouthfeel, as expected was light but pleasing enough. Extremely easy to drink...kind of like a light beer, but with a lot more flavor. Good for what it is, a low abv session beer."
"The ""best"" thing about this beer is its nitro-can. It gives the beer an amazing head, and is a cool looking shade of blue. Everything else about it is disappointing. THe most disappointing thing: It only contains 3.9% alcohol! That's incredible! I didn't notice that until I already had poured it, and when I tasted it I couldn't deny the beer's weakness. After the creamy head was a wierd yellow beer that had almost no taste. It didn't taste bad, and it didn't taste good. It simply had no flavor. Not surprising when you consider that it is weaker than Mic Ultra, the tapwater beer. I wouldn't buy it again. If you get a chance to try it for free, do so, just so you can tell everyone about the weakest beer ever."
"Pours a light amber. For such little head it has a nice bit of lace to go w/ it. Not to much of a smell to it. it has a light, semi-sweet flavor it it. Has a hint of smoke mixed with the malty. Dry, finish, but definately not crisp, more of a nice creamy feel.Blanaced through and through. Easy drinking through and through, nice easy going beer"
"Pop the top and let the Nitro can do its thing. This beer pours a nice amber color after some separation and leaves behind a nice thick creamy white head that keeps its form. Smells of malts and the taste could be described as very subtle. Some may even consider this brew as being watery. Once you can get by this you notice a very nicely balance beer that has a nice malty/smokeyness to it. This beer is very drinkable and I would not pass it by if it was offered to me."
"Another sad example of how not to package a great beer. The usual presentation for the nitro: pop the tab, dump into the glass. After the bubbles do their trick, an amber color beverage appears. First sip, watered down. I hate writing this review because you sense this is a great beer that has been destroyed by the ""widget"". A little hops, but I could not get by the watered down taste. Even my wife commented, ""this would be a good beer after mowing the lawn."" Tragedy."
"Flavor is creamy and malty, with a nice nutty finish. Reminds me of that same aftertaste you get when you eat hazelnuts. No apparent metallic taste. Light earthy herbal hops, blending seamlessly with the malt. Balance like whoa. I can't tell where the malts begin and the hops end. Awesome. Damn fine beer, even in the can. I'd love to try this on tap or cask."
"A staple on my recent Scotland trip. It has a black or brown plastic bubble tap sign. The extra cold version of the same beer has a blue bubble tap sign. Medium copper color, Orange looking at times, rust or brown at times depending on the light. Bubbly thin tan head. Toasted smells seem to dominate. Taste was smooth and sufficiently bitter, nice hop presence. Always a somewhat metallic taste to finish. Hard water ? Not sure, but it happened more than once. Nice nitro creaminess to it, but it seemed to get a little watery at times. Overall an easy to find, pleasing experience."
"This one is just not for me ..."
"Pours a dark amber with a big frothy cascading head and a fair amount of lace. The mild sweet malty aroma and faint hop smell fades fast so enjoy it while you can. Notes of Caramel blend with tea-like hops. A trace of metallic bitterness can be detected with some effort. I don't know how they do it, but this ale is a pretty fair forgery of a Scottish Mild on tap."
"This is the first Belhaven product I've tried. On balance, although I've been pleased with several of the imported ales available in nitro cans, I was disappointed with this one. It poured out a nice brown color but, unusual for a product in a nitro can, had a very weak-looking head. The smell and taste seemed lighter than I would have expected for a ""Best"" - very little hop flavor - more like a summer ale. Certainly a drinkable product but I find it hard in this case to justify paying the premium import price being charged for a 4-pack"
"If this is the best stuff they got, I'd hate to see the worst. Just kidding! This stuff is awesome! It's appearance isn't that bad, but I usually do like darker beers. It did have a cool seperation effect though. The head stuck around forever too, so I liked that. The taste was a very nice creamy taste, somewhat similar to the Wexford, but a little bit deeper in taste. The finish was definately smooth and didn't leave a nasty aftertaste, like most light beers."
