"One of the few U.S. examples of a proper bitter that I have encountered (the best is from Oliver brewery at the Pratt Street Ale House in Baltimore). Well balanced and served cask conditioned, as all bitters should be. This was a surprising treat."

"Overall: A very good English Bitter. Great citrus presence for an easy drinking session ale."
"On cask at Town Hall Brewery. This beer arrives a clear orange-amber color. The head is a solid inch of foam that lasts until the beer is gone, and leaves thick rings of lacing along the sides of the glass. The aroma is of lemons, limes, oranges, and herbal hops. The taste has a strong grapefruit character, but there is also an ample amount of passion fruit, lemon, lime and orange. There is also a firm bitterness in the finish. It is a really complex taste, and I seem to find something new with each sip. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a really good beer that verges on greatness. I am really kicking myself that it took me seven years of patronizing Town Hall before I tried it. I will certainly not be waiting seven more years before I drink it again."

"O- I’ve had this beer many times and have always forgotten to tick it, this beer I feel is over looked because of all the other great beers Town Hall brews, this beer is solid and very enjoyable."
"The West Bank was also available on cask condition during our visit to the Town Hall. This gave a nice chance to try the cask vs standard pour. The cask condition carried the same color (nice copper) as the tap version, however there was no carbonation and the head was thicker and more frothy. The smell was also the same as my previous review; however, the taste was much more bitter making it more tough on the pallet. Still a decent beer, but I prefer it on tap."
"A surprisingly flavorful pale. It’s a bit weak on the finish, but a good display of Simcoe hops."
"Not a bad beer, but I wasn’t that crazy about it. The cask style seemed to be the better option here."
"O - Solid beer, should be easier to drink with the low ABV, but not a ton of complaints on this one. Worth trying if you like hoppy APAs."
"On tap at the brewery poured into a sampler glass. Pours a glowing golden hue, a good haze, frothy offwhite head laces well. Hops are luscious. Tropical and grapefruit hops, lemon. Touches of gumball, peach. Some pale malts and bread. Initial is lighter bodied, a rich tropical fruit hop profile. Decent bitterness. Some bready malts, sticking tropical. Lingering sweet gumball, tropical fruit bitterness with some mandarin orange, lingering grapefruit. Quite a flavorful hop profile and strong bitterness for an APA. Quite nice. Better than the IPA in my opinion with sufficient bitterness, complex hop profile, and an easy drinkability and solid balance."
"Good. A very nice low ABV option. Always welcome."
"Although the flavors aren't complex, this is a very nicely done pale ale. The bitter back half and finish make the beer for me. I'll be sure to get this again next time I'm at MTH and it's on cask."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a decent pale ale, but it could stand to be cleaned up on the fermentation side."
"Worth trying but not outstanding."
"Draft. Pours a clear golden straw color with a slight coastered white head. Good lace as it settles. Nice mix of hops aromas wih predominant citrus but also some earthy and floral notes. Medium/light mouthfeel. Slight sweet start then transitions to a slight hop bitterness. Lingering bitter. An easy drinking and sessionable beer."
"Overall, a fairly hoppy pale ale. A little sticky. Somewhat drinkable. I like it, but a pint would be enough."
"Pours a fairly-bright orange with some visible carbonation. A nice white head with a good deal of lace as it goes down. The aroma is of caramel and mild malts with a little bit of hop bitterness, with no hop type in particular standing out. The flavor is quite crisp, yet subdued. Drinkability is very high, and for that reason the low abv is appreciated."
"Pours a copper color with a decent head and nice retention. Has a nice combination of malt and hops, with some caramel present in the smell and the taste. Somewhat heavy carbonation and medium bodied. This is a nicely drinkable beer, and it finishes very dry."
"Great beer from Town Hall. Not my favorite, but a good beer none the less."
"Pours a clear coppery orange, medium sized white head forms, drops to a thick ring, some looks chunks of lace stick to the glass. Smell is nice, toasty and caramelized, some light fruitiness, oats and honey, earthy, lightly spicy hops, floral, very malty. Taste is similar, very malty, caramel, floral, lightly fruity, earthy, oat toastiness, solid bitterness, very balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, nice fruitiness and nicely balanced. Just a good session beer, I could knock back pints of this all night."
"Drinkability: Great example of the style, just a little too carbonated."
"Copper color with a thick foamy head. Heavy grain and malt character in the flavor and a little in the nose. There are some hops that pop out during the sniff and the sip, but not as much as some ""stock ales."" The finish to this beer has a nice malty sensation in the mouth. This beer is pretty drinkable and when I bring ""new"" friends to the Town Hall Brewery and they are looking for a recommendation I will usually pull this one for them. One friend I visit with regularly loves this stuff and almost never drinks anything else. I like other offerings better, but its better than lots of beers on the market."
"i have come to realize that it resembles a similar tap water quality of the minneapolis area. i think this may have something to do with it."
"D- Solid beer throughout and quite drinkable. I probably would opt for others though in the future."
"D- Pretty easy drinking beer."
"Maybe it was off,at least the bitterness and my drinking buddy agreed. It was presented to us as a mild red - that was the colour. Lace suggested freshness, it had some head too. Served cold, but a tad of mould in there and an off-bitterness. I could drink some of it, but a surprisingly weak one."
"D - Good brew. Certainly could be a great session beer."
"This beer is much better than it used to be since Hoops has tweaked the recipe. Nicely toasty with a mild hop bitterness and creamy mouthfeel. BUT drink this first because for some reason it doesn't go well with the IPA, unless you drink the Pub first. So when you head over to the Town Hall for Pint Club or Pick-a-Pint Hour, grab a Pub Ale first before drowning yourself in IPA!"
"Something went wrong here for me. Maybe my palate was compromised by drinking a pint of the 1800 IPA before this. The barkeep also said they just changed the barrel (or whatever they use to serve the beer) so maybe it was a fouled batch. The taste was dirty, musty, and almost skunky. The appearance was good. For some reason I can't really get a smell of the beers while I'm sitting at the bar besides the smell of detergent off the glassware but nothing alerted me that there might be something wrong. When I go back I will definately give it another go because I am sure it was just a combination of things that led me to have a negative response to this beer."
"Dusty Copper colored body topped by an off-white head. Aromas of malt and a touch of woody hops. The flavor has great malt character backed by a solid bitterness. The earthiness of the malting floor seems to come through with this beer. Not sure if the yeast is unique to this offering, but the yeast character seems to come through. Mouthfeel smooth and solid. The drinkability is better than the sum of the individual parts. Although not impressive in any other individual way, overall this is a really nice beer."
"As a side note, on cask, or on nitro, this beer is extreeeemly smooth, tops mouthfeel for sure. On grolwer though, much is lost. A shame, oh well."
"Originally reviewed on December 12, 2005. On tap at the brewpub. A slightly peculiar halloween orange, clear. A little whitish head. Estery almost belgian aroma. Sweet hoppy flavor, with grass and honey. Brown sugar and some underlying complexity improve the beer. Palate is hop dry, leaving grassy smack and resin impression."
"UPDATE: 11/24/10 - This is a pale ale now with Simcoe hops. It's an even better session beer with a great citrus fruity and perfumey hops."
"On tap at the brewpub, this pours a pale golden amber color with a quarter-inch whitish head and nice lacing on the glass. There is a minimal smell of malt. The taste is mildly malty and grassy, with a touch of caramel and just a hint of bitterness. This feels pleasingly light on the tongue. A nice undemanding easy drinker."
"In all, this is a beer i could see drinking several of in an evening... not quite a session beer, but i could see drinking enough of these to need a cab or bus ride home."
"Last swigs: Mild ale, overall, barely bitter, almond ginger."
"This beer came a bright honey gold with a foamy white head that left awesome lace. Smells of yeasty malt with a very slight bitterness. Tastes of delicate bitterness and of a buttery brown ale with some decisive grassiness. Mouth feel is medium with a very light carbonation."
"Amber in colour with low carbonation. Definitely a milder type of bitter, in keeping with the English style session bitters. Slightly spicy hop aroma. A light but pleasing malt vs. bitter balance. Good drinkability, but a little thin in the mouth for me. I thought it also lacked a bit of the complexity of some of the other bitters that I've had. Generally solid, but I like their other products better."
"Dark gold, almost amber color, slightly chill-haze on the pint. Nice head, close to 1/2 an inch in height and leaving very attractive lace. Hops mark the aroma more than I anticipated, almost weedy in Springtime fashion, perhaps indicative of some American influence. Smooth and quaffable, better mouthfeel than some in its consistent quality with a well-balanced approach to flavor profile. Lightly diacetyl with buttery tones and an interesting combination of licorice-like hoppiness and chocolate and toffee candy. Lighlty sweet aftertaste marks an overall pleasant experience. More substance than many brewpub Bitters, without a marked alcohol hike."
"West Bank didnt rock my world but this was actually my fifth pint of the evening and its possible I was at the threshold of palate fatigue."
"East bank thanks to Bighuge for sharing this one."
"like all Town Hall beers, goes fast."
"Very clear golden color...nice white head...fresh nose but soft...nice light maltiness with a fresh floral hoppiness on the taste..mouthfeel is perfect for this style...session beer all the way...easy drinking...nice fresh floral taste...nice easy drinking beer...certainly not a big beer...seems more of a mild to me in substance but has a bit more hops than you'd expect....I guess a basic bitter is about right....certainly not an ESB by any means...good brew for the style..I'd select many of their others over this because I'd prefer something more substantial but that's just me...like I said for the style this is good"
"This was a beer that I didn't wuite figure out the style on it. I assumed it was another pale ale when I tried it, but there was a difference. There was a sudle spiciness that was hard to trace throught the sample. I like the hops finish, this beer is definitely one I'd get again."
"Kind of a dull copper appearance. Very slight haze. A good sized ivory white head sits on top and has great retention. The lace left by it is full, intricate and droopy. Aroma is herbal and grassy. Oily and hoppy. And toffee-like. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. (From cask, this beer is like velvet.) Body is pushing medium. Flavor profile seems to be very English, which is no surprise. I'm guessing English hops here, but I could be wrong. They are earthy and grassy. Bitterness is clean and noticeable. Enjoyable. Malt profile seems caramel derived. Toffee tones are quite enjoyable. Really good. This one is quite quaffable."
"Smell is solid display of balance with a nice fresh bread toned malt thats a bit roasty and the hops lend a nice bouquet of light pine and citrus. Taste is well balanced starting with lightly toasted bread that keeps its share of the taste up til it starts with the hops which is just past midway and goes from there with some pretty favorable amounts of bittering hops, fresh and herbally grassy with sour pineyness and light puckering grapefruit rinds. Great lingering bitterness quality that also gives way to a bit of highly roasted nuts and more bread malts and yeast playing in with the bitterness. Quite a nice attachment. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and mellow the whole way through and the bitterness gives a little extra zip. Quite a nice little bitter brew. Refreshing and drinkable, goes good with any of the appetizers."
"This visit, the WB Pub was also available on cask, and in that form, I'd have to add an extra star: the head was thick and creamy, the flavor was mellow, but made a powerful presence on the palate, and it went down like a dream. Ah, bliss!"
