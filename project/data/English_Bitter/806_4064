4.11,9.3,4.5,3.5,4.25,4,4.5,"Final Grade: 4.11, an excellent A-. Brakspear Bitter is a fabulous session ale, and definitely one of the highlights of Marston's 'Classic Ales' sampler. This is not a complex beer, or even necessarily a particularly memorable one - but it's easily one of the best English bitters I've had in years, and for that reason I must give it some sincere props. Solid stuff that all English ale fans should consider worth a shot - I'd definitely be buying more if it were available in this province in a more convenient format.","thehyperduck","Dec 10, 2014"

4.1,9,,,,,,"Served on cask in Philly. Pours light amber with an almost grapefruit-like hue and the thick creamy head of cask beer. Nose has faint whiffs of biscuits and toast. Taste is surprisingly fruity with back current of woody tannins. Body is thin but supported by the nice carbonation from the cask. Both that and the cask temperature were a huge compliment to the beer; it would have been a far lesser beer served cold from a keg.","RichardMNixon","Aug 23, 2014"

Surprisingly complex and flavorful, this is highly indicative of the English brewing style-- finding ways to create flavorful beers without having to jack up body and ABV. Toffee and caramel flavors explode in the mouth and finish with a earthy bitter twinge. This is an ale that you could drink all night long, enjoy every last drop, and not stagger out of the pub drunkenly.","dwren89","Jul 04, 2013"

The first mouthful was a delight, very smooth and creamy with a refreshing bitterness. But then strange things started to happen, it started to smell vaguely of rubber tyres, oak and even whisky. The problem was a lack of consistency within the pint, one minute there was a strange smell and then the next it was gone.

Taste is quite nice, bit of malty caramel sweetness up front, nutty biscuity middle, herbal bitterness, light touch of roast, bit of a yeasty finish, some floral, nice solid bitterness.

The initial taste is almost of apple juice with the bitterness kicking in after a few seconds. But, I'm sorry to say, I found it very watery and on the flat side (but then why not?

Brewed with Maris Otter malts, Goldings and Fuggles hops. Copper coloured, low head. Aroma of ""dusty"" Goldings hops + rusty iron in stale water + hospital flesh wound dressings(!)

4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hearty amber color with some tan head and nice foaming action. Smell comes out maltier than I expected for a bitter, nutty maybe. There are also some nice hop characteristics in there. Taste is more hoppy than the smell let on, and a bit biscuity and buttery, with the nutty malt flavor backing it up. And of course it's got that nice biting bitter kick at the end which I've really come to enjoy a lot recently. Yum.","twelvsies","Jan 13, 2005"
4.03,7.2,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This bitter poured a clear, amber-red color with off-white foam that settled slowly and which clung to the glass a bit. The smell was mildly fruity hops with mild malt.

Smell consisted of malts, biscuits, buttery tones and some soft fruit. Blended well together actually. Taste was good, but the mouthfeel was quite flat. Perhaps a bad bottle but it was pretty flat. But the taste held up nicely. British brewed beers usually like to be on the low side of carbonation so perhaps that's what the beer is supposed to be but I didn't like it that way.

The head was nice and slow to fade, though. The nose was surprisingly hoppy as was the flavor. Since the body was really thin the abundant hopping was forced to carry the beer. Unfortunately, the hops (Goldings, according to Oakes at least) don't have enough flavor and character besides the bitterness and a slight medicinal quality to add much excitement. Although the malt there was nice, like buttered caramel, there wasn't enough of it. Not bad, just not good. Easily quaffable though.","aracauna","Feb 17, 2003"
3.8,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A cloudless amber color, the head modest but quite short-lived leaving a fine sheet of lace to blanket the glass. The nose crisp and clean with the malts dominant and lightly sweet tones to seal it off.

4.43,17.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Brilliantly clear light copper hue, topped by a thin, but persistant head that leaves loose lace.  Rustic, leafy, dry - hopped, earthy Fuggles hop nose hits the nose upfront, & is ensued by biscuit malt, light caramel and mild diacetyl butterscotch.  The malt profile is a seemless extension of the aroma, being comprised of biscuit & light buttery diacetyl, w/ malt sweetness provided by light crystal malt.  Hop bitterness offsets malt sweetness perfectly, lending an overall balance to this bitter.  Ample residual dextrins provide a full body, & when coupled with the low carbonation, the mouthfeel is slickly smooth.  Assertively British, earthy Fuggles hop flavor.  Finishes w/ fading biscuit notes.  Brakspear Bitter is a very flavorful & full bodied session brew, especially considering its low gravity.
