"500 ml. bottle, golden orange colour with a white head that fades soon, but leaves a good lace. Smell of hops and citrus, mineral, limestone. Sme rough edges in the (buttery) palate but it feels very good and refreshing. Taste of citrus, hops and minerals. Good one."
" This is just one of the beers that is perfect to have at the pub with the mates as it doesn't ask for too much attention and slakes the thirst just fine without boring the palate or mind."

"This is a nice enough beer and good for a session."
"D- An average bitter, good, but not special."
"The execution is brilliant. It's high on flavor and relatively low on alcohol. I really like these aspects, and think this makes for a perfect session beer."
"One of the most drinkable beers I have had lately, I am sure I will make some effort to find the version in the cask."
"Probably lacking the character it once had but certainly more consistent. Still a pretty good ordinary bitter which remains a classic session beer."
"nearly didnt review this. its well with the bottle date, but i just dont think this beer travels well. check out the other bottle reviews from australia and they are all well below the average. its probably great from the cask, but avoid the bottle."
"The definition of a Cask Bitter for me."
"Overall a nice refreshing session ale; tasted more like a Summer ale."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are respectable as well. ABV is slightly higher than your average English bitter (typically a session beer), but still very drinkable--especially in moderation."
"d) It drinks very smoothly."
"On cask at a Young's pub in Camden Town, London. Had a half pint and it appeared a clear amber-orange. This was just a nice, classic English bitter with lots of dry pale malt flavor. The aroma takes a fruitier malt aroma. Overall, this bitter cleaner is on the cleaner side of the style, but worth trying."
"Orange haze with an ample head, looks very inviting. Not a hell of a lot happenning nose -wise. A bit of malty action with some hop presence but it all comes together on the palate. Nice warming malt with beautiful lingering bitterness that you just don't see often enough in other beers purporting to be bitter. Very nice aftertaste, only had one bottle unfortunately. Went down a treat with devilled steak burger my missus made. Yummo."
"Surprisingly sweet on the front palate, elements of candied orange, but that's really it. Mostly watery and quite refreshing with a slight bitterness on the finish. Again, that's about it. Slight bitterness. I guess this is all in keeping with the style, smooth drinking with a minimum of flavour. Mouthfeel is a bit full, like swallowing soapy water. The body feels heavier than expected, given the lack of flavour."
"This is a nice beer - a very well made English bitter. Truly, not my favourite style, but a good example of it. Raw, robust and true to its name."
"Overall, this was an interesting and well-balanced brew that I wish I were able to find in the US. Would very much recommend."
"but easily drinkable with solid flavours."
"Golden in colour with a slight haze and a decent sized tight foam. The aroma is a pleasant balance of sweet toffee malt, fruity esters and subtle hops. The taste is sweet up front with a rich toffee malt profile going right through into the finish. There is a firm hop flavour supporting the sweet malt, the bitterness being superbly balanced. The mouthfeel is full yet not cloying, making this an exceptional session ale. This is a wonderful beer, a great example of what can be done with a low alcohol beer."
"M&D: lightly-fizzy, but very well bottle-conditioned... It retains the freshness of a true cask of Young's Bitter, while the slightly higher level of bitterness contributes a bit more body, hence more drinkable to my liking! I have to say, this is a success in bottle-conditioning one of the beloved old tipples of London! I just wonder why it took them so long before deciding to do something like this, esp. now they're not based in the old Wandsworth Ram brewery anymore??"
"It's not very drinkable because it tastes very bland."
"NOTE The version I drank was the cask one which is only 3.7% ABV.The bottled version is 4.5% and clearly falls outside the ""session"" class.Many cask beers are beefed up to compensate for the dumbing down of flavours when put in bottles or cans.It doesn't really work but that's another story."
"D - Not much to this beer - just a good quality, sessionable bitter."
"Thie beer is a well balanced blend of hoppyness and a dry thirstquenching bitter flavour, to produce a fine English Bitter. I just hope it doesn't change to much once it is brewed in Bedford."
"Drinkability: A session beer, defined. The old hops are off-putting, and I am not sure if they are intentionally aged or not, but they don't intrude too much on the beer's drinkability. A well-rounded ale."
"BB 07 Aug 06. Not much head and beautifull amber and bright beer. Sweet and very malty nose, litle english hops aswell as good esters. Taste is full and well bittered witch makes this brew taste stronger as it is and make it hang for quiet some time. Well carbonated and having much more taste as the avarage lager. Not that much expirience in this style but for shure well drinkable and IMHO a perfect sessionbeer."
"Now, the glass is empty. I miss it already. Can one fall in love with an ale?"
"the brew was bitter to adstringency, rather watery and pretty bland .... while I very much appreciate the more special brews from Young's this one is but a disappointment ..."
"Overall, subtle and nice, but didn't knock my socks off."
"Other comments: A good, standard bitter. As with most British beer, much better on cask, of course."
"This beer was a total bore. I can only imagine that it is better on cask."
"If someone offers to pick up a couple for you from ""over there", I highly recommend that you ask for this one."
"Not bad, like a watered down version of their london ale in some respects"
"This was one of my favorite cask beers on my trip to London. Pours a bright bronze with minimal carb and a big frothy head. Lacing is unbelievable with big rings left behind down the entire glass. The aroma is mostly of Goldings and Fuggles, with a small bit of biscuity malt. The taste is very well balanced and dry, much hoppier than the other cask bitters I sampled. Hops reast on a delicious malt background. Cask beer have the best mouthfeel and this one was incredibly full bodied for 3.7 ABV. A highly drinkable bitter."
"Mellow malt, with a sparkling mouthfeel. Dry finish with a bit of metal in it. Decent, if unremarkable."
"This bitter poured a clear, golden amber color with white foam that persisted. The smell was very modest and faintly malty. The taste was very nice: lightly malty with light bitterness in the finish. There was a light floral hoppiness as well as a touch of hop bitterness in the taste. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation. The flavor lingered on the tongue. This was a very easy to drink and enjoyable bitter."
"Young's bitter, as sampled at the Duke Of Camberwell pub, the bunch of grapes, and the Lamb on Lamb Conduit Street in the city. Contrary to what some previous reviewers have said, I still think this beer is a very hoppy, citrusy offering. Perhaps the very ""malty"" pints are just bad pints were the lines are not properly cared for!? This is a lovely light amber colour with a nice white head. The aromas are of citirc hops and honey-like malts. The taste is similar to the aromas. They are very citrusy, hoppy, and honey-ish. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is wonderful! Excellent stuff!"
"It's still quite drinkable, but not what it once was."
"Drinkability: ah, again. They can call it what they will - for ME this would be a perfect ale for the warmer days of summer if it were chilled just a wee bit more and with a wee bit more carbonation. Perhaps they also sell it in bottles? Anyway, as it was a rather warm summer day out, this beer was quite refreshing in!"
"Drank this at a Young's pub in Wandsworth, London...right down the road from the brewery. Clear, light caramel in color with a near absent white head atop small bubbles. Mild carbonation with no retention or lacing. Aroma is of fruity fermentation and light English hops. Taste is extremely mild, with pale malts and a corn-ish adjunct. Finish is lightly bitter, lightly dry and round. Mouthfeel is smooth, soft with a watery finish and thin body...Extremely mild, one could easily drink 4 pints of this over a lunch break."
"A CAMRA Award winner on more than one occassion, that simply has to be tried on Cask, preferably in a Youngs House in London UK, to fully appreciate its nuances and intended drinking environs. Try the Lamb (WC1) or Morpeth Arms (SW1). Both of which sell vast quantities of it in top-condition. I will I try and add these establishments to the Beerfly soon."
"One of the most flavourful ordinary bitters I've ever had. I was able to enjoy this lovely brew in a very friendly CAMRA certified Young's pub in London, for which the name escapes me. Copper coloured with a distinct fresh bready aroma...some fruit and hop aroma are also noted. Flavor is full with a relatively assertive (for this style) hop finish. Could easily drink several pints of this fine ale."
"This is my all time favourite ordinary bitter, such a small beer with big complexities. So drinkable to the point of going down like water, malt is a bit thin but that is they way the style is. Malt was faintly doughy from hints of yeast and lightly kilned grain. Great subtle hopping with a balance of bitterness and flavour. A faint haze lingered but the lace sat well and seems to stick here and there."
"First let me say you have to go to the U.K. to have this. It is cask conditioned and absolute heaven to drink. I have never had a more drinkable ale. The taste is a unique malty almost biscuit like flavor. There is a distinct but mellow hop twang that perfectly balances this fine beer. I made my second pilgrimage to the Young's brewery tasting pub just last week. The first thing I do is get on my knees and thank god I'm there. Then they ""pull"" me a pint of the nectar of the gods. If I had access to this here at home I WOULD develop a serious problem. The King! As an addition I would like to add, the aroma is incredibly earthy and exudes health, flowery hops abound and lean towards lemony. The most drinkable ale on earth!!"
