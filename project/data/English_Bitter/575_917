The aroma is slightly better than your average american macro-lager due to the bitter hops. Very thin mouthfeel followed by a rather simple disappointing flavor.

So I saw it tonight for $1.99 and decided to give it a proper tasting and review. It poured a nice, clear amber body and frothy off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. The nose was lightly fruity (when it's cold it's almost undistinguishable from a lager), and it had a sulphury, and perhaps even metallic edge to it. Standard mouthfeel. The flavor is pretty basic ""pale ale"". Lightly caramelish malt, mildly yeasty fruit, and grassy/leafy hops. Not sure where the metallic edge is coming from. Standard bitterness. Finishes dry with some residual, dull hops. Average. Australian for just slightly better than regular Foster's.","NeroFiddled","Dec 23, 2006"

There was a bit of a canned corn taste, but it was really mild in the aftertaste, not in an overpowering or unpleasant way. Mouthfeel was a light medium, good carbonation.

It is actually a lovely reddish-copper color. It has a big foamy white head that dies fast but does leave some lacing. The nose is a forcefully sweet malt and earthy and spicy hops. Taste is a big bitter flavor on top of a weaker but distictively sweet malt body.

With a macro brewery, the brewing process is so ""engineered", I am sure they can achieve the flavor profile they want regardless of the type of yeast (ale or lager).

Thick veins of lace were left at the top of the glass, with moderate lacing appearing while drinking the beer. The aroma was very pleasant, with caramel malt and fruit notes, with a bit of hop spice. As I suck some of this ale through the foam, the taste mimics the aroma, with a clean, sweet caramel maltiness followed by a stronger bitterness. The finish is rather clean, with a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin perhaps, but not at all watery.

3.3,15.4,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,4,"The thick, white head tops a light copper hued brew and settles quickly.  Diacetyl butterscotch dominates the aroma, and a light Kent Goldings hop nose is there as well.  Mild, yet pleasant in overall aroma.  The hop bitterness and malt sweetness is well balanced, but body and mouthfeel is a bit thin and a touch watery. Considering it's an ESB, more fruitiness and malt complexity would've been appreciated.  Regardless, the overall balance and lack of flaws make this a drinkable brew.  I was craving a Fullers ESB while drinking this one, however.","marc77","Jun 06, 2002"

2.71,-5.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Big ass 25.4 oz can with no freshness date, brewed in Canada  damn and I thought I was drinking an Aussie product. Pretty good bubbly rocky head that slowly dissipates with a sunset orange hue. Mild fruity and grainy aroma with vague hints of caramel and mineral. Smooth with a moderate carbonation. Slight metallic and buttery flavours run amuck upfront, hop bitterness is no help in the matter and seems to be accentuated from the metallic flavours. Along comes a mildly buttery malt and late fruitiness that seems to barely tame the astringencies but at least draws the brew closer to balance and leads into a bit more malt character. Semi-dry after taste with more mineral and grain flavours. Not a beer I would go back to.","Jason","May 08, 2002"

3.26,14,4,3,3,3,4,"Grainey scent.  Good balance of barley malt and hops.  IMHO, this is a superior brew to the Foster's Lager.  Nothing very fancy or original here, it's just a good tasting classic (even though a plain) beer.  Good amount of sediment in the glass.  Was pleasantly surprised with this one.","Jordan","Nov 29, 2001"
3.04,6.3,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Personally, I think that ""Foster's is Australian for crap"" but I found their Special Bitter to be most enjoyable and quite the session beer. Shame it only comes in oil cans here in the US, but I'd definitely purchase more of this beer.","Todd","Jul 09, 2001"
