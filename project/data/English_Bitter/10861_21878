2.97,-14.4,3.75,3,3,2.75,2.75,"Overall: This is another fairly ubiquitous brew locally and one of the few bitters I've found in clear bottles - I'm wondering whether or not this is a factor in the excessive amount of diacetyl flavours I noticed, because this beer really doesn't do much for me out of the bottle. Draught might be a different matter (less chance of being light-struck, for a start) so there may be a case for having this on draught and re-reviewing. All in all, disappointing.","interzen","Dec 24, 2014"
2.98,-14.1,3,3,3,2.75,3,"Overall - This beer seems to be everywhere now. I have had great experiences with the brewery's other beers but this one was a complete let down. The smell and taste are closer to lager than anything else and  the mouth feel is plain annoying, but the actual taste is not too bad if you just imagine you are drinking a lager","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Dec 01, 2014"

3.09,-11,2.75,3,3.25,3,3,"Beer which seems to have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years. Pours from 500ml bottle a dark amber colour with minimal head (or maybe that was down to a poor pour). The nose is malty, brown sugar, toffee and carrot. Tangy beer with a fruity start becoming sweeter and a rather metallic finish. Definitely malt dominated and less salty than I recall the cask version being. Not unpleasant but could do with more assertive hops.","charlatan","Jul 09, 2014"

Dark amber in colour, with plenty of resinous hop aroma and flavour. Big malt backing and full mouth feel. It being a rare sunny day in London and the beer a little warmer than an Aussie is use to, I found the 4% alcohol less drinkable than some of the other Ales I sampled.","rizzo","Sep 17, 2007"
