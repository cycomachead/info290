We’ve been excited to sample each of the Beer Camp offerings, so we figured that here we could kill two birds with one stone.  “There and Back” served both of these purposes nicely.  This is an expectedly mild beer, with a bit more sweetness than hoppiness for the style.  The bitterness of it tends to come on the back, and as you allow for each sip to settle.  We found this to be a refreshing presentation and introduction of that aspect of the beer, rather than being killed off the top with forced flavoring.  The malts are allowed to build to their dark, biscuity center; enough to cushion the bitterness of yeast, booze, and toast.  This will be easy to enjoy for most beer lovers.","TheBrewo","Oct 04, 2014"

Flavor is malty to the core, bready with some fruits in there like figs and apples, clean crisp finish of straw and sugars. Light bodied, crisp, medium plus carbonation.

Scents of sweetly floral hops, medium levels of fruity esters reminiscent of apple, a moderate presence of caramel, a lightly earthy herbal hop presence in the background, a touch of alcohol faintly discernible and light presence biscuity malt. Overall impression is a sweet, malty aroma with a nice balancing touch of fruity esters and hop aromas. Very pleasing and quite balanced. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of caramel and slight toasted and nutty malts balanced by a nice moderate level of hop bitterness with an herbal and lightly citrusy character. This moves into a moderately bitter middle with notes of herbal and floral hop flavors and a medium-light level of fruity esters with a balancing pale and nutty malt backbone. Finish is dry with notes of toasted and nutty malt, herbal, earthy and zesty citrus fruit hops and a light presence of fruity esters with a touch of alcohol. Aftertaste is dry with notes of resinous hops, toasted and nutty malts. Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth feeling with low carbonation adding to this impression. Overall this is a good English Bitter. It balances sweet, nutty and toasted malt flavors with a nice level of hop character and bitterness to create a moderately bitter, yet still balanced impression on the drinker. Its aroma is similarly balanced and the mouthfeel adds to impression of a balanced, quaffable session ale. A very nice beer and one of the best of the Beer Camp series.","Auraan","Aug 18, 2014"

The back end began, miraculously to take on strong nodes of Sierra Nevada yeastiness.  The combination of somewhat rougher American nodes livened up the beer considerably.","mynie","Aug 18, 2014"

3.68,0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/22/2014. Pours lightly hazy orange/copper color with a 1-finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of citrus zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of citrus zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and robustness of earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and fruity yeast flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English bitter. Good balance and robustness of earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

4.21,15,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Has a nice brown ale appearance with small head that doesn't hold that long. Smell is nice. Very bready and grainy. Fresh grain smell I like. The taste is quite shocking and interesting. Almost a numbing quality like novacaine but I don't mean that in a negative way. Its honestly void of flavor, but not in a negative way like a cheap watery adjunct. Incredibly sessionable. Maybe my pallet is off from the last one, but aside from a slight grain flavor upfront and slight hop finish, this beer I really can't detect much flavor yet I still crave it. Overall, its a wonderful session beer but unfortunately this is a 1 and done beer camp sampling. If this were sold regularly, I'd buy periodically as a great lawnmower, pallet break beer.","bubseymour","Jul 30, 2014"

3.47,-5.2,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Pours a light brown amber/copper color, like a redwood stain. The beer might be a touch hazy, or perhaps, it’s just the color. The head initially kicks up as a blanket of off white foam. It’s a touch fizzy and fades away after a minute, leaving moderate lacing. Not the most vigorous. Mild but rich caramel in the aroma. A touch of cough syrup. Bready malt, a bit simple but nice. Some fruitiness, mostly strawberries, grapes, cherries and raspberries, but all sweet with no acidity. Mild hoppiness, some sort of herbal, earthy, mineral-ish spice in the background. Taste is fairly sweet. The malt is nice, but the sweetness climbs a bit much and takes on an off character with that cough syrup flavor, which I’ve noticed in other English-style beers, as well. That same sweet fruitiness and mild hop flavor. It’s a fruity, earthy flavor. Finish dries out some, ending with a mineral finish. Mouthfeel is quite full. Carbonation is fairly low. The beer does wash out a bit at the end. Decent beer and it’s always nice to try a less common English style.","popery","Jul 29, 2014"

Not too "bitter" as the label and style would lead you to believe, but it was a very sold and good quality beer. Nice golden bronze color, taste was not bitter, but well balanced like a pale ale more than anything I could explain. This is probably one of the stepchildren of this package but I think it is as good or better, based purely upon my expectations of the more lauded breweries, as any other beer in this offering.","humuloner22","Beers"

Nose expresses a hint of something spicy/fruity as well as grassy/herbal hops character. Taste consistent with nose; however, biscuity and caramel notes are the more prominent features in the flavor profile; whereas the spicy and earthy/herbal qualities come out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that falls a little shy of crisp.

The sweet malts are stronger but are still overshadowed by the fruity notes. The taste is still close to what a traditional bitter tastes like but the tropical notes do not exactly mix very well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the lighter side with very little biting carbonation. Overall, an okay beer and extremely unique but it doesn't work for me.

3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"meh, this is one of the least exciting beers in the box, and although its pretty tasty, theres not much to it, and its not a style that gets much stoke going with me. clear lighter copper to bronze sort of color, bright looking, no haze at all. the nose is a little tannic, grain rich and a slightly sweet. there is some nice bittering hops in there as well, but its pretty simple really. the flavor is identical to the nose, the grain tannins are evident and it makes the beer feel a little thin. it also drags on a little too long in the middle, overbalancing the sweetness of the grain, leaving just the bitter hop finish, which isnt anything abrasive, but its more robust than the english ones for the most part. well carbonated and clean drinking, but just a beer thats hard to get too pumped up on. i was hoping for a fruit beer with new glarus, given how fun they get with it, so this was a bit of a drag. good beer though for what it is, as they all are in this box.","StonedTrippin","Jul 23, 2014"

I get a toasted caramel malt note which is balanced by a tropical fruit punchbowl of hoppy goodness. The flavor has that same caramel malty character, rich and fulfilling without being weighted down or heavy. The hops play well in this field with a guava mango floral citrus mélange. It’s not what I’d expect from a run-of-the-mill bitter but here it works, and it works wonderfully. So glad I have another bottle of this to enjoy again later.","elNopalero","Jul 23, 2014"

Aroma has a crystal-malt caramel smell; hops are present, but very light. In the taste though, bitterness is there and moderately high, but it's well-balanced with malt. Yeast character is slightly fruity. Soft carbonation and body is spot-on too. Really, this is de-lish, a really drinkable English PA (maybe a bit strong to be a bitter per se). The highlight in the set so far.","allengarvin","Jul 23, 2014"

The brew smells like nuts, dried fruit, toffee, bready/caramel malt, and some grassy/leafy hops. It tastes like caramel/bready malt, toffee, nuts, light grassy hops, apple/apple skins, and some herbalness. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and smooth with moderate carbonation. It's also easy and enjoyable to drink. I thought this was a solid brew, but not a memorable one. With that being said, I wouldn't turn down a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jul 20, 2014"
