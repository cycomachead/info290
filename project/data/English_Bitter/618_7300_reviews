"O: Nice to have a craft beer from my University Home town, in an English style. My first English Bitter, but really reminds me of English Browns."

"Overall - a fine English bitter than isn't jaw dropping but is a very solid selection especially with a limited number of other local options."

"Final Thoughts: A decent beer and a good example of how much flavor can be packed into a low ABV. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"O: This beer starts well on the nose. Makes you look forward to tasting it but then when you do you're disapointed by the lack of flavours, bittereness and dry finish. It's not a bad beer just not on style."
"Very drinkable beer. Good tasting. Nice aroma. Very well balanced, not too bitter but you can taste hopiness. Enjoyed this one. Enjoyed the tall can format. I would drink this beer more often if it was available in Quebec. Seems true to style of English bitter, but I need to try more English Bitter’s to compare."
"Pours a tawny, dark auburn color with a finger of egg shell colored head. The aroma was toasty, with doughy bread crust, crackers and a subtle herbal hop note. Tast wasn't really bitter, though by English standards, it may be great. Bits of caramel, soft sweet bread notes. Had a nice feel, light, but with a silky sort of feel on the palate. Nothing mind blowing, but a nice little session ale."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"O - A tasty rendition of the style, solid flavour profile and an easy drinking brew. Glad this was a part of the mixer pack."
"Serving type: Can"
"O - Pretty flavorful for a light beer. Indeed sessionable but it could use a bit more bitterness from hops in my opinion. Otherwise it is a well crafted beer."
""
"O/D - I've had this beer and enjoyed it before but it's not really doing much for me in the can. Off for the style. While drinkable, it's nothing to write home about, especially if judging to style."
""
"Filtered amber brown, with a loose off-white head. Some lacing and moderate retention. Nose has some nice hop notes, earthy, bready and lightly caramelized malts. A touch of diacetyl - simple and pleasant. Taste is a bit restrained, more lightly bready notes, some cracker, fruits but the richer earthier English malt notes on the nose weren't as pronounced on the palate. A bit watery, a bit from some carbonation and a modest hop bitterness. Light and relatively flavourful, I'm sure this is substantially more enjoyable fresh. Good stuff nonetheless."

"O- Good bitter, note really familiar with the style but worth looking into more."
"Overall – Not a very exciting beer by any means, but it I guess it work well as a session beer. Only thing is I think it would be quite boring to drink these one after another. Anyways, it's a decent beer but not something I'd buy again."

"Taste is sweet at first, easily drinkable for a bitter, part of that may owe to the lower ABV as well 4%, it does say it's intended as a session beer and it seems to achieve what they set out to do."
"Arkell Best Bitter is perfect for a 21st century beer set in early 20th century England. It is a simple, neutral, malt-forward and clean-brewed ale that lends itself to being knocked back easily, and in large quantities. This is a beer better suited to cask, no doubt, but even in the bottle is worth a try. A good alternative to commercial lagers."
"Final Grade: 3.72, a B."
"Nose has a slight mineral character, bready malt, caramel, light fruitiness. Flavor is more fruity, pretty sweet for a bitter, honey bread, light grassy bitterness gives a drying finish, light lemon, a bit of butter, caramel. Definitely over carbonated, a little thin in this format, even for a bitter. It's not bad but we do some better bitters than this in Ontario."
"Poured a one finger head on tap at the Golden Kiwi - little lacing and head dissipated quickly - nice dark amber colour - S - slightly grassy, a little caramel and light malt - the taste follows the nose - also buttery with a little spice - pleasant and very sessionable but a little understated with only a hint of hops - nice but could be more bitter - O - very decent although compared to other bitters could use a bit more punch IMO."
"Would definitely recommend."
"D: An exceptionally flavoural and sessionable bitter; probably the best offering from Wellington's. It took me a while to find it (finally got it on tap at Hometown Eatery, i.e. Yukiko's, in Waterloo), but it is unquestionably worth seeking out."
"A well crafted English ale but lacking in the depth of malt character that makes this style rock."
"This review was based on my second sample out of a six pack, but I've already had enough to know the beer will make it into high rotation for social gatherings or poker games."
"Decent, easy to drink, but lacks a solid flavor profile to really enjoy. I actually prefer the SPA to Arkell as my Welly sessionable."
"It pours a deep copper with thin white head. The aroma is pleasant, but very mild. It has some floral hops and some biscuit malt. Taste has a sligtest hint of bitterness, with some caramel coming through. It is an fine bitter, but nothing special."
"D- This is probably the best session beer available in Canada at 4% abv, unbelievably easy to get down. This packs a lot flavor for 4% IMO."
"A decent thirst quencher. Not something I'd buy again though."
"A nicely drinkable bitter, light, but with decent amounts of malt and hop - an eminently sessionable beer."
"I must ask, what is this beer trying to achieve? Most of the great bitters have way more fruit and hop flavours, with some nice British nuances like butter and toffee. Not so with Wellington Arkell. I think the brewer needs to take this one back to the drawing board and create something with much more character."
"D: A good beer for hot summer day. I'm a little bit disappointed due to the lack of bitterness... Maybe not out of style, but I prefer my bitter to be more bitter."
"Overall, this brew seems like an average offering from a great brewery. Hope the others I have from Wellington's will fair better than this."
"Final Thoughts: As my first regular English Bitter, I was impressed. I mean, with stuff like this around, it astounds me how the light lager is so popular. An all around great beer for all seasons. It would go well with dinner or be good for a hot day. It would be fine at the pub or to give to your buds at poker night. It would make a great session ale and is even good for cooking with. Certainly worth your time and at about $12.00 a six pack in Ontario this beer is well worth every penny."
"This is a very clean, refreshing beer with a great mouthfeel. I'm not sure how it would fare on tap or in a cask for a british beer as it is very light and the taste is not overly pronounced, which makes me slightly bored with it, but it's extrordinarily easy drinking otherwise."
"On tap at the winking judge in Hamilton, Ontario. Pours a slight head with a dark amber/copper body. Aroma is spicy/malty with some bitterness as well. Taste is bitter, spicy, and maybe even sweet. Nice bitter aftertaste as well. A really good light beer. Was suprised to see that it is 4%. Nice."
"Pours very clear copper color with one finger off-white head, which disappeared quickly. Smell - rye bread, toasted malts, slight raisiny aroma. Very nice actually. Taste - toastiness comes at first, followed by bready malty and fruity (raisins, plums) notes. Very well balanced, crisp, refreshing, light, but at the same time it doesn't lack flavor. Very drinkable, great stuff!"
"Drinkability is 5/5. This is a session beer."
"Not overly bitter or good. Wellington doesn't do a heck of a lot for me. I should have avoided this one..."
"also i think it is worth noting that with about 6 months of proper cellaring you get a much more complex fruit forward beer. this isnt something that i recommend you hang onto for that long but if you feel like experimenting its any interesting brew with a little age on it."
"Overall a decent beer, but not a bitter."
"My first English Bitter. I like this beer quite a bit, it's nice to have a lower abv quaffer to fall back on when desired."
"Perfect carbonation for the style... next to none. Mouthfeel was quite thin I found. This contributes to an insane drinkability for a best bitter. I could hammer these back and at 4%, that's a dangerous beer."
"Overall this is by far one of the best light beers that I have had to date. Its probably on of the best English Bitters that I have had as well. Good flavorfull easy drinking light beer. These beers make the domestic macro garbage light beers look really, really bad. I wish there were more light beers of this quality."
"Overall impression is that this is a good, mild Beer. A casual type of Beer that I will enjoy again."
"D: Very drinkable. A great bitter on cask. Wellington Brewery needs to get this stuff to the states."
"Taste is fruity, like a good English bitter. Rather mild, not sharply hopped. Some caramel or candy sugar notes. The beer is slightly sticky on my lips and has enough (bit too much) carbonation. I expected it too be more bitter, but it is a very drinkable beer."
"It's misleadingly referred to as a light beer, by some, but this is terribly misleading. Welly's Best Bitter - while not the best entry in the brewery's flagship product line - is a very taste brew that's highly sessionable. It's an ale that grows on you; rich in taste and low enough in ABV that you can have a few without feeling guilty. Once again, Wellington demonstrates its position at the fore of craft brewing in Ontario."
"I LIKE this Ale from cask ! Beats the hell out of the rather subdued and overly carbonated and pasturized bottle version"
"D - Very nice session-type brew. At 4% it won't knock you on your ass after a few pints either. I wouldn't mind trying to homebrew something like this for an everyday beer."
"D: Quality session beer."
"This poured a light brown to a finger thick head that lingers for a while. Smell is very fresh, barley malts make their way through quite nicely. This stuff tastes pretty good, a modest bitterness with a clean finish. Very very smooth and very easy to drink. Another excellent brew from Wellington."
"Dusty bronze. An interestingly Canadian beer in that it expresses flavors of maple so strongly that other malt and hop flavors are simply forgotten. Recurrent themes of stark bitterness that seem sour and out of place, mingling with that ubiquitous maple-leaf flavor. Dusty, almost leathery hints as well. Went down fairly well but seemed ham-handed in use of maple. Relatively fat mouthfeel for such a smallish beer."
"Poured a clear light brown, fresh from the cask at Bow and Arrow. Small head formed, no lace. The smell was almost non existant, little bit of malt and hops. Taste is subdued as well, some sweet maltiness is present, grapefruity, little bitterness. It was smooth but very light and watery kind of, alright but disappointing."
"Couldn't find the burst of flavour the rest of the reviews seem to reflect. Overall too thin and watery for me to consider a real good drinking beer, inspite of a slight pleasant fruitiness."
"Cask: Poured a clear brown color ale with a small head that disappeared quite fast. Aroma is quite weak with some malt being distinguishable with some light hops. Taste is refreshing but very light with some sweet malt and light hops. Body is too thin for my own liking and was expecting more bitterness. Not bad but there is some way better bitter out there."
"Pours a vibrant amber/orange, with a tan head and impressive lacing. Appearance reminds me of a west coast american style pale ale. Very light and flavourful bitter. Tonnes of hop aroma and flavour. Also a light fruitiness. Pine, nuts, floral. One of my favourites from Wellington. A great session beer."
"Just a note, the freshness of casks at Cest What can be inconsistent, so some samples arent as good as others. This review was based on a cask that was tapped only a few hours earlier. Ive had other samples that tasted overwhelmingly of sour milk."
"Poured a coppery burnt orange with a white head that dissipated relatively quickly. Smell well rather floral and nutty, with a touch of citrus. Taste was some malts and quite hoppy for an ale, with a smooth mouthfeel and nice dry finish. Bitters are known for there drinkability, and this is no exception. I could drink this all day, and I probably will..."
"The taste is quite similar to the aromas with an excellent citrus hop taste up front and a more subdued, yet lovely french bread-like maltiness in the middle. The finish of this ale on cask is much more crisp, and dry, making for a much more refreshing tipple. Wow, another winner from Wellington, a damn good ordinary bitter in the cask conditioned format. Sure, this beer is still damn good on tap, but it really shines on cask! Another world-class UK style beer is being brewed in Ontario!"
"Light body. Very well balanced beer. The start has more malty sweetness and then the hops come out. Almost no aftertaste, if anything just a lingering sweetness."
"Clear rich copper with a thin, but long lasting, head that producing some fine lacing. This beer has a very clean, mild aroma with well-balanced hops and caramel/toasted malts. Malty flavour to start and hop bitterness becomes more apparent towards the finish. Medium/light body, and low carbonation helps keep it smooth. The finish is dry, with hops lingering on the palate. Great session beer."
"Pretty good, mild bitter. Appearance is kind of a dull sunset colour. Browns twingling with oranges. A 1 1/2 finger head that slowly settles to one finger at the finish. Small strings of lace coat the glass. Smells of caramel, barley, hops, apples(russet?) and ripe raspberries. Tastes a bit more bitter than the smell leads to believe. The malts are first, with the hops a close contender. Their is also a bit of toffee taste. Pleasantly balancing. The apples leave a somewhat sour aftertaste. Definite Granny Smith, but I still think their are some Russets in the mix. Mouthfeel is a little chewy and light. I would like to know what it'd be like with more body. One of those circumstances where more body could be an improvement, or fatal. Very drinkable. The light body makes for a good session beer, while the complex balances of taste and aromas leaves you curious for more. A good, nay, a terrific beer from Wellington. It's nice to know their is a brewery in Ontario that produces some quality beer."
"Another gem from the Wellington County Brewery. Beer must be consumed at room temperature to appreciate its essence. The terra cotta colour was quite intriguing for a bitter. The head lingered a tad too long, but once it subsided the plethora of hops came to the fore. I really enjoyed the chewy taste and the light smooth feel in swallowing. No apparent after taste. Not the ""Best Bitter"" I have every had, but not a bad bitter either. (say that 5 times)"
"Also tried on cask and not as tasty, had on cask again 3 years later and there is a funky taste to it."
"Very nice."
"Deep golden hue, light and short-lived head that leaves a little lacing. Smell is fairly typical - a little hoppy, a little sweet. Taste is solid, well hopped and with a dryish bitter finish. Feels light, but substantial (kind of an oxymoron, but I'm sure most people know the feeling). Certainly a fine and solid brew that I may come back to when I want a session drinker."
