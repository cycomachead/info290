Would buy it again but it is not easy to find and there are some I like a bit more.

Sticky lace and thick cap. Smells great with fat malt and light citrus. Lemon and floral are light as a feather on a bread & biscuit caramel malt spine. Malt opens up deep and sweet. Taste is gentle ,clean crystal malt with a good honey and butter sweetness, slightly nutty, alongside hops that are as gentle as a spring breeze with some earth and floral and not quite too bitter. Just enough bitter to lean in on the back palate. It was a touch watery and thin. Drank smooth and bittersweet and had a silky mouthfeel with just a bit of carbonation to tickle the throat. Really good.","utopiajane","Jun 09, 2013"

3.78,8.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This was a surprisingly good brew. I had on draft at XL center in Hartford during a Huskies game and another on tap at City Steam - I found it to be a refreshing, easy drinking alternative to the other Macros on draft at XL. I then bought this in bottle six pack and was equally impressed, actually more impressed. As far as ambers go, it holds up in all categories. Ambers aren't my go to, but I'm always curious to see what's available as a local brew. Overall, a quality and satisfying beer.","WhaleHopper","Jan 26, 2012"

3.62,3.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Grabbed a bottle at the Red Door in my home town of Watertown, CT. This amber ale is a deep copper color, clear and fairly quiet. The head is just a thin off-white cover but the lacing is decent. The aroma brings a solid molasses caramel malt that seems promising. The flavor says much the same with more of the distinctive molasses with peachy fruit highlights and a subtle pinch of herbal hop. It’s medium-light bodied with modest carbonation and a slightly chalky feel. It’s not bad, certainly a bit of a statement compared to the average amber ale. But I think it could do with just a little bit more of the molasses power to make this better than simply distinctive. It seems a little watery at times but not enough to ruin it. A different sort of amber and well worth a try.","Durge","Jun 07, 2011"
3.3,-5.4,3,3,3.5,4,3,"Overall, this isn't a style I would normally go for, but this beer isn't bad. If I were offered one, I would happily drink it. If it were available here, I would probably not ever buy it.","AleWatcher","May 16, 2011"

3.38,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall: Not sure if this is good for a bitter or pale ale. When I was drinking it, I thought sweet amber ale. There is a nice mix, but the malt triumphs. Not out of the ordinary, but nothing to pass over either.","tigg924","Apr 29, 2011"
2.82,-19.2,4,2,3,3,3,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a gorgeous dark amber with small head and decent retention of lacing. Aroma is malty, with some hops and yeast. Mouthfeel is light. Taste is of hops, yeast and is just overall watered down tasting. It is just ok.","surprenant1138","Apr 21, 2011"
2.7,-22.6,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Not too bad, but not that great either. Pretty mild and smooth, but not too flavorful/memorable. Poured a light amber with a light head that settled quickly. Light, mildly hoppy aroma and taste. Easy drinking, light mouthfeel. Not something I'd reorder, but nice for those who don't live dangerously.","Rifugium","Apr 20, 2011"

3.68,5.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Smell has a small amount of citrus hops, caramel and grain. Naughty Nurse tastes fairly sweet, sugar, light on the hops. MF is medium, no strong aftertaste of any kind. Drinkability is fairly good in this offering from City Steam out of Hartford. I have enjoyed this on-tap at their brewpub there a couple years ago. Now, it is nice to have the option to pick this up at the local package store.","mltobin","Dec 14, 2010"
3.3,-5.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"12oz bottle. Pours a dark chestnut brown color with minimal head. Some lacing. Sweet aroma of malts and spices. Taste is mostly spices at first with some maltiness to it. Somewhat bready. Spices in the finish. Overall this beer is okay but I'm hoping this is just the beginning of City Steam bottling its beers. I would really like to see Acapulco Gold or the Summer Stout in 6 packs. For now this entry is ""eh"".","PicoPapa","Oct 27, 2010"
3.78,8.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"D: Very drinkable, nice mix of flavors, nice body, and overall a nice beer. I am glad they started bottling this, it's nice to have more local stuff.","erosier","Jun 25, 2010"

3.92,12.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from tap, a nice golden color, with a decent head and excellent lacing. Aromas are of citrus, a bit of wheat and some grassy like elements. This one has a nice tinge of maltiness in the back upon tasting, the grapefruit flavors compliments the malt up front. Mouthfeel is perfect, a nice bitter finish accomapnies a well carbonated brew. Overall, enjoyable, but I still liked the Carpenter's Ale better.","thespaceman","Dec 19, 2008"

3.77,8,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The naughtly nurse is a popular beer at City Steam, some part due to it's mischievous name no doubt. In truth, its a decent, well balanced pale ale, nothing amazing but very drinkable. Color is a light brown to amber, a little bit of white head that doesn't stick around long. Smells like a lighter pale ale, aroma of subtle hops and malt, which matches the taste indeed. The Nurse goes down quite well :-), without any bitterness or major aftertaste. This is a beer you can drink a fair amount of, not too strong, but fairly smooth and mellow. Pretty good for a standard City Steam beer, but I much prefer some of their special brews.","mikeys01","May 12, 2003"
2.68,-23.2,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Draught: Lighter amber color. It had a little head, but not too much, with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is a bit thin. I get some citrus hops and a little malt, plus some floral notes. There is a decent enough maltiness to the beer, but pretty this on any bitterness to the taste. Good, but a bit on the thin side for a Pale Ale. A typical ""standard"" house beer for a micro: good, but definitely brewed for the Macro masses.","Boto","Beers"
3.48,-0.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This seems to be the flagship brew, at least the most popular, perhaps because it has what it takes for mass appeal. Better than average in most respects, but it probably won't blow you away. Light brown color with a low head that dissipates fairly quickly. Slight hop aroma, followed by a mellow hop flavor, supplemented with some malt and fruity undertones. Decent mouthfeel, but no real lingering flavors.","far333","0"
2.45,-29.8,3,3,2,2.5,2.5,"I had high hopes. It had a frothy head, it was served well chilled. I could smell hops on the nose. Then I drank it.. missed the hops. They were just really weak. Is this ~supposed~ to be a pale ale? Sure doesn't seem it. The 2nd beer I tried at City Steam. I'm a bit dissapointed.","packetknife","Beers"
3.06,-12.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Kind of a weak pale ale.  Doesn't have the hop kick that I expect from a pale ale and had a very thin body with a short finnish.  I've found that this place's seasonals are much better than their year-round products.","pbrian","0"
