3.89,-2.5,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Starting the Super Bowl evening off right with some badass K-Tina K-So (patent pending) and a Bitter Brewer.  This stuff pours a mostly clear brass-tawny topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises grass, sharp flowers, light biscuit, and a touch of resin for the sake of it.  The taste brings in more of the same, the bready biscuit somewhat tempering the grass, but still allowing those hops to shine.  The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish that keeps the grassy twang from malingering.  Overall, a very enjoyable little beer, something I could easily see myself having more of in the future (if not tonight, even).","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2015"

Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, bitter hop, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, bitter hop, earth, and earth hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really liked the hop profile on this one as the earthiness mixed really well with the bitter hops. While it was good it definitely didn’t stand out compared to other brews I’ve had from the style.

4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"I think this is a pretty good-looking beer... and one of my favorite Surly cans to date. Pours a nice orange-y yellow with moderate white head. Nose is decently hoppy, citrusy with a bit of a toasty malty background. Flavor follows suit. Toasty malt with a light hop bitterness, and bigger hop citrusy flavor. THe marmalade and toast comparison made on the can is not far off, though I might not think of it as quite THAT fruity. MF is decent for a bitter like this--light, well-carbonated, but not watery. Overall I enjoy this beer. It's a nice break from the more intense beers that Surly makes--a nice Surly-esque take on a session beer. Kind of like a light IPA (if Abrasive is a double IPA, then this is a half IPA). Nice beer, worth trying, wish it was cheaper than the other Surlys though.","LordAdmNelson","Aug 02, 2011"
4.15,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O: definitely would recommend a four pack of pint cans will run you 9$. Great at night after work. Surly knows what they are doing. That's why I bought the kit for this one.","YumYumGumGum","Aug 02, 2011"

It is clear, but not overpowering, the great, classic toastiness of the malt is in the background and just has so much nuance. Somewhere between a slightly overcooked pie crust and a pancake. Just an excellent beer that makes a ton of flavor and subtlety for being only 4%. I will drink this any day.","Ineedabeerhere","Sep 30, 2010"

Floral hops with orange sweetness and bit of oak. Slightly bitter with a solid malt profile. The taste is dry and absolutely bitter. Bitter grassy hops with light malts. I'm into this one. Already lamenting that I only have one can left. The mouthfeel is light and subtly carbonated, nothing offensive here. And at four percent, a tailor made session beer that's easy to kick back and enjoy.","Bendurgin","Sep 23, 2010"
3.6,-9.8,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Amber color with a thick frothy head about 2 or 3 cm thick that clings all over the glass after pouring. The beer has american hops and british malt. The nose is gently hoppy. It seems that the hops in the nose is imparted by the flavoring hops and that there wasn't much done with aromatics. Gentle flavor of hops and malt working together. The body of the beer is mostly a malty read and there seems to be some orange zest or lemon peel or both. Light body and finishes very clean. The mouthfeel is pretty ordinary as there is nothing about it that I can even make note of. It just slides down your throat. The hops seems to almost get lost until the finish and aftertaste. The brewery itself describes the beer as ""marmalade"" flavor, so I guess I am on it with the orange.","Ragingbull","Sep 23, 2010"
3.98,-0.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The English malts shine through on the flavor with a perfectly-restrained sweetness that suggests toffee, dates, and mineral water. Yeast adds notes of tobacco and shoe polish, with a healthily bitter floral kick on the finish from fresh-tasting hop cones. Mouthfeel is aggressive, as Surly beers tend to be, but not overly so. Big bubbles from the CO2 roll across the palate to make the body feel even thinner than the style dictates. Still, Bitter Brewer is an excellent take on an obscure style.

I'd love to find out what a traditional English brewer would have to say about this beer.Tastes like some of the best, quintessential English bitters, with distinctly American hopping. Nice mellow malt up front with an interesting hop profile to say the least. It seems like all the hops are in the nose, but there's a nice dry finish to it. Spicy, with very light citrus notes and hardly any bitterness, yet juicy. Super smooth and crips on the palate. So refreshing and uber quaffable.

Taste is very similar to the smell, all of the above mentioned smells were also present in flavor, with the floral hops asserting themselves more. Definitely seems to be a medium sized beer in body. Drinkability is really something. The low alcohol content along with the high level of complexity make it an excellent session brew. Surly has not disappointed with any of their beers so far. I especially love the style; It is one that I rarely get a chance to try, so I am very happy that I had the opportunity. Now my only problem is that this glass is becoming empty far too quickly.

The smell is straightforward west coast hops. It actually really surprises me that the hop aroma is so prevalent. The flavor is a bit disappointing. Up front, as it says on the can, is an orange preserves flavor, with orange peel and sugar coming through but after that the flavor just diminishes into a watery tea. The flavor really reminds me of a cold, orange citrus tea. The mouthfeel is very thin, but not really light, like a good pilsner would be. I think this beer is very good at what it's trying to be.

This pours, just as the can states, a pale orange color with a nice rocky, airy head of foam that dissipates to subtle lacing and white film. The aroma is filled full of peppery, earthy hops. Heavy resinous notes get me salivating for a taste. A soft biscuit-like smell balances the hops quite well. The taste is full of hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Nothing overpowering at all and the body, although full of flavor, is soft and light. This makes this beer remarkably easy to drink and makes me want more and more with each taste.

Anyone who really like the English Bitter listed above will be surprise by this one. For me the nose is a great invitation of twangy hops, but the taste is a bit too much. The bite is acrid, and tough, but not in a totally bad way. It's well brewed to be just that--but it's not fun for me to drink, and the malty base and body are too weak to match up to the hops, which linger ad infinitum and build uncomfortably over the course of the beer. With that said, I can see why those very things would be a postive for a lot of people.","FightingEntropy","Jul 10, 2008"

Medium to medium light in body with low carbonation. Somewhat watery and lacking in a lot of malt presence, but packing in the hops like they're actually grown in the can.

While I've never cared much for it on tap, I hoped that the cask version would be better(take for example the Summit IPA, which is terrific on cask, but the cold version leaves me, well, cold). This beer(disapointingly) is just a warmer version of the cold Bitter Brewer. Served on cask, this pours a hazy amber color, with a frothy white head and ample lacing on the glass. The smell is malty with a hint of lemon. The lemon smell is an overwhelming flavor in the beer. It's hard to taste much else, although there is a bready malty flavor as well. The mouthfeel is rich(typical of Surly brews). There is just too much lemon flavor in this beer for me to appreciate it.

Extremely light orange taste at first, almost ephemeral. Bitterness rises quickly, and seems disembodied from the beer. Its not a hop bitterness, per se, its just bitterness, seemingly unrelated to the soft, light, otherwise easy drinking beer. The only trace of a floral hop is manifested in my after-burps.

Lots of hop character, but not as dominating as you'd think. There is a lot of malty sweetness going on, caramel and vanilla with a lemon zest finish. I'd like to see more people drinking this beer.

Smell is sweet caramal malt, rye bread, and a touch of clementine and grapefruit. A light floral aroma and some nuttiness tickles the nose as well. Very pleasant beer to sniff. Taste begins with a quick but strong bitter burst followed by lemon flavored tea and caramel glazed peanuts. Dry midway with a brown sugar sweetness and pink grapefruit. Aftertaste is floral with a bit of earthy hops and molasses. Light to medium body with a fairly creamy feel. Carbonation stings the mouth with a puckering effect. This is definitely a session beer and a damn good one at that. If I could get this on a regular basis as well as ST Hop Sun, one of each would be in the fridge all year round.

The aroma has a punch of American hops with some definite citrus aroma coming through.
