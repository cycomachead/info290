Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are overly yeasty and otherwise quite bland. Mouthfeel is OK but a shade overcarbonated. Possible yeast overdevelopment or cell death giving some off-notes to the character. Nothing special but might be worth sampling again if I have the chance.

A light, bright, juicy yeastiness and hoppiness thoroughly dominate and it leans firmly, but gently, to the bitter side with plenty of well-rounded character, yeasty-hoppy-juicy-leafy-herbal, to support the bitterness.

3.88,5.1,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Very flavorful, hop-forward and quite bitter. Hop flavors take on a more earthy and herbal quality on the tongue. The malt foundation is bready and dry, quite crisp. There's a mineral backbone that seems to enhance the dryness, adding a bit of astringency that doesn't go too far. It's a light bodied beer, but not as thin as some bitters can be - there's just enough heft. Apple-like fruitiness appears mid-palate, but the strong bitterness in the finish quickly washes it away. Bitterness could stand to be dialed down a bit, I feel like it covers up some of the complexity. Nonetheless, this was a very enjoyable beer, one I'd definitely buy again.","largadeer","Apr 02, 2011"

3.85,4.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Yet another nice find at My Place in Newtown, CT this cask ale presents a pale clear amber color with a fair, big-bubbled head that dies pretty quickly with no lacing. The aroma is dank wheat with a slight herbal hop highlight. Not thrilling but there's hope. The taste offers a creamy citrus bite, nothing harsh but reasonable in typical English style. Very modest carbonation. It's a very nice blend of citrus and floral bread. A near full feel, very smooth and quite drinkable. The hops seem to build as you go.

The smell is slight, but I detected some citrus. The taste is surprisingly watery, but has a slight citrus hop taste. The mouthfeel, like the beer, is light. I was expecting something bolder, especially as this was the 1998 Champion Bitter at the Great British Beer Fest.

This is the first time I had this beer, and sometimes my prejudice (for and against) English bitters compels me to usually rate their beers ""quaint"" and unremarkable. However, this one does stick out for me. Maybe it's been a while since I've sampled many beers of the style, but this one was either quite fresh, or just beautifully made. Or both!

The tea thing is sticking with me on this one ... definitely an impression of fresh brewed Ear Grey here, which is really odd for this yellow-orange brew, but there it is. It mellows as you go, more like a small, seedy orange.

Floral hops dominate the aroma with some caramel malt. Hops (English), kind of grassy and somewhat piney, dominate the flavor with a fair bit of malt to support them. I may be off, but I detect a hint of smoke in this beer too. Medium to full in body. Not a bad English bitter.","MrHurmateeowish","Feb 01, 2007"
3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"500 ml brown bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Bottle conditioned. Brewed with pale malt only. Golden colour, just a slight haziness, large off-white head.

A refreshing beer - not bad at all.","Sigmund","Dec 23, 2006"

The aroma is earthy, with just a slight whiff of hops. A small amount of caramel, citrus, and some grain also mix in the smell. The taste is dry, with a grain and mild hop flavor. The flavor is somewhat restrained, which was a disappointment to me. Same goes for the mouthfeel, with seemed a little light. Lots of carbonation. The finish has a grapefruit citrus flavor, with modest bitterness. The beer is okay, but it dint really speak to me. All in all, this is an average and uninteresting bitter.","Suds","Jul 31, 2006"

It has a pale malt scent along with a slightly dry, yet fruity English yeast aroma. It's bitter with noble hops; quite nice. The taste is average. It has a very bitter hop flavor that is way over the top. It has a light pale malt flavor, but there is no real balance here. It has a powerful grapefruit aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is an average bitter. It's way too over the top for me. I'm not a huge fan of citrus hops.

3.62,-1.9,5,3,4,2,4,"Another English ale that pours with a good amount of carbonation (probably because it bottle-conditioned.) This bitter pours with a beautifully rocky head that slowly falls leaving thick lacing. There's just a little bit of a saltine cracker aroma. A fairly full-bodied bitter with a straightforward maltiness (not complex) and hearty bitter finish. Nothing terribly complex here, just a very refreshing bitter ale. Perhaps a bit too clean for the style, but a good quencher, and certainly bitter enough. The bottle mentions adding the yeast to the bottle for ""a fuller flavour", which I'd recommend, as doing so seemed to bring out a delicate fruitiness in this beer. I liked this beer but it seemed to be overcarbonated. I can only imagine what it would be like on cask.","marcobrau","Aug 11, 2005"

Light brown sugar aroma with an appetizing hop aroma, muted and bark-like, but nice. Light body but fairly generous carbonation. Interesting beer, emphasizes hops but distinctly in an English style, tight and floral, verging on charred. Pretty good balance but hop skewed. Notable in that its almost a stand out in taking a classic Bitter to its extreme, low in alcohol and sharp and a nice change of pace in light of the numerous American Ales that cross my path. Because of the higher carbonation and slightly medicinal qualities, I didn't find this really drinkable however.","ADR","Apr 28, 2005"

The nose was sltigthly caramel sweet with a toasted character and a really nice english hop, pretty much what I would expect of a bitter. The flavor was very nice, mellow caramel and toasted grains moved to a really smooth yet crisp hop that lingered nicely on my tongue. There was a slight metallic aftertaste that detracted a bit. The beer was smooth and an awesome moderate feel. This beer was a very nice one to start the evening with. Served at just the perfect temperature.

Bitterness is there in good quantity for a bitter, mellow and inviting, nice length and fruity characteristics lingers nicely. Quite a nice taster. I nearly forgot it was a bitter, it came into an IPA quality of some English variants I've had so that impressed me.
