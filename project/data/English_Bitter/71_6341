3.7,1.6,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Pours a bright, clear copper, with a sizable white head that dissipates a bit quickly and leaves virtually no lacing. Smell is quite nice, mild Goldings bitterness over light caramel and crady malts. Light tropical fruitiness and a hint of tea. Taste is weaker. Most of the bitterness is lost, and it winds up being too sweet and one dimensional. Mouthfeel is awfully watery and much too thin. Drinkability is fine, but it's not something that I feel compelled to return to. Fuller's is one of my favourite breweries, but this is quite a letdown.","Mandrake","Aug 10, 2009"
3.48,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a clear golden, thick white head forms and slowly settles down to a nice ring, good retention, lace spots all over. Smell is interesting, light and fruity, apricots, toasty malt, honey sweetness, lightly floral. Taste is similar, quite light but nice flavours, neat apricot fruitiness, some floral, oats/cereal toasty malt middle, hint of sweetness in the finish, no real bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. I like it but not much of a bitter. Doesn't have a kick in the finish, so comes across as a little weak.","Viggo","Jun 18, 2009"

English Milds and Bitters are not always good, but when they are they're often truly phenomenal - and that's definitely the word I'd use to sum up this beer.","biegaman","May 23, 2009"
3.83,5.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"My local off licence in Dublin began stocking bottles of Chiswick a while back but I avoided it because I remember trying a glass of it from cask in London and not being particularly impressed. I'm a big fan of London Pride but for some reason that half-pint of Chiso just didn't do it for me. Anyway, I now reckon it must have been a dodgy cask because the bottle I eventually decided to pick up last night was excellent. The colouring is a nice orange and more like an American pale ale than a traditional English ale. The taste is also quite different to other English ales, which I find quite malt-heavy, nor is it like a hop-heavy American ale, however - it retains its own distinctive English hoppiness which gives it a nice aroma and a really fresh aftertaste. Finally, I like the way the way its low in alcohol content but still very full bodied and flavoursome. This is a highly drinkable beer with a great hop profile and I'll definitely be trying it on cask next time I'm in London.","Madigan","May 17, 2009"

3.51,-3.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Had this one on tap at Mahars and it was poured at a very good temperature, not warm but by no means cold. The color was a medium to dark colored yellow with a very good sized white head that had very good retention and left nice chunky lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was pretty good though it was a little light, what was there was a nice fruit aroma and slight hop presence. The flavors of this brew where pretty nice, some what muted but what was there was quite tasty. The malts come out more here and the fruit flavors seem to be more citric, reminds me a little of lemons. While this brew was some what muted on both the aroma and taste fronts it goes down very easy and the flavors that are there seem to work, a very good session brew. I hope that Mahar's might be able to get this on cask sometime as they do bring in some very nice things in that format.","Stimack","Feb 04, 2009"
