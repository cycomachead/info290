This is a good-tasting beer for a 3.6% - it is fairly light, but the flavours are there and are quite identifiable. A good price at AU$77 for a case of 24 x 440mL.","SmashPants","Nov 28, 2014"

3.45,7.1,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Nitro-can poured into an English pub glass. A rather light golden straw color with perhaps a hint of red, once the entire glass of billowing beige nitro bubbles gradually broke ... Actually looks pretty cool as the bubbles recede and the beer coalesces at the bottom of the glass. Aroma is rather weak and mellow but I do get a tea-like floral and fruity scent along with scant doughy malts. Taste is similarly subdued, with some Juicy Fruit bubblegum, very light citrus iced tea, and dry bitter tea leaf hops putting in appearances. Ultra-thin body and silky smooth ... One of the creamiest beers I have yet to sample and admittedly I enjoyed this aspect. The carbonation is high but feels soft, with little in the way of astringent burning. Good ol' nitro bubbles. Finish does not really linger although there is a persistent metallic tang. I can appreciate this modern English bitter for what it is ... A low ABV brew drinkable in massive quantities. Look elsewhere for robust flavors.","CalgaryFMC","Beers"

This is a mediocre English bitter/pale ale, with no real strong points to counter the typical weak points of this style of beer (weak aroma, mild flavour and flat mouthfeel). At $2.50 a can (and only available in four packs), this isn't something I anticipate I'll be returning to at any point in the near future - it reminds me a little of Boddington's, in that both are proof-positive that imported ales can be every bit as dull and lifeless as North American pale lagers.","thehyperduck","Dec 31, 2013"

3.01,-6.5,4,3,3,2.5,3,"Tetley's was once the embodiment of real ale. Now, it is nothing more than a damaging testimony to the state of beer in England. The fact that an ale so insipid and uninspired can be a top-ten selling brand does not speak highly of British palates. However, I will concede that, insofar as mass-produced beers go, one could do much worse. That is in no way an endorsement, but it is about the most positive thing I can say.","biegaman","Oct 09, 2012"
3.96,23,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"The Crack immediately caused The Surge, a massive off-gassing of what I assume to be N2. It is always good to read directions and I followed theirs to the letter. I employed a gentle Glug, running the beer down the side of the tilted glass, where it began a beautiful cascade upon arrival at the bottom. I was left with a dense, thick finger of tawny head head with excellent retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a pleasant biscuit malt quality. Mouthfeel was full and creamy thanks to the N2 presence. It was light in its flavor, a biscuit/cracker-like semi-sweetness, but still quite pleasant. Finish was likewise semi-sweet with the maltiness lingering well after the swallow. The low ABV makes it a sessionable CANdidate by even Ding's standards, but I am afraid that as a hophead, I would need more bitterness to sustain me.","woodychandler","Oct 02, 2012"
