"this beer was a big suprise"
""
"A light and drinkable bitter. Looks great. Tastes a little boring."
""
"Overall: This is another fairly ubiquitous brew locally and one of the few bitters I've found in clear bottles - I'm wondering whether or not this is a factor in the excessive amount of diacetyl flavours I noticed, because this beer really doesn't do much for me out of the bottle. Draught might be a different matter (less chance of being light-struck, for a start) so there may be a case for having this on draught and re-reviewing. All in all, disappointing."
"Overall - This beer seems to be everywhere now. I have had great experiences with the brewery's other beers but this one was a complete let down. The smell and taste are closer to lager than anything else and  the mouth feel is plain annoying, but the actual taste is not too bad if you just imagine you are drinking a lager"

"Beer which seems to have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years. Pours from 500ml bottle a dark amber colour with minimal head (or maybe that was down to a poor pour). The nose is malty, brown sugar, toffee and carrot. Tangy beer with a fruity start becoming sweeter and a rather metallic finish. Definitely malt dominated and less salty than I recall the cask version being. Not unpleasant but could do with more assertive hops."
"O) Not as good as I remember it from drinking previously. Will buy it again, maybe this is an off batch or drinking it cold is muting the flavours."

"O_I have had a few of these here and I have enjoyed them quite a bit. A nice easy drinking ale with a lot of flavor."

"It had a great color of a cask ale, maroon, transparent, but not watery, decent head. I was looking forward to it, but when i drank it....it had almost no flavor whatsoever. It was watery, had no real personality, reminded me of dishwater almost. Should've gotten a Stella instead."
"Jury out, go figure, in terms of a numbers review."

"Flavorful and refreshing taste. Sweet malt with a hint of spices and caramel. Not so bitter. Fast finish with oranges and mild dry. Good smooth beer."
""
"A basic English bitter here and nothing to get particularly exciting about it. It was an easy drink to consume and goes down well despite being a little plain."

"O: wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't seek out a bottle of it. Would like to see how the cask version varies."
"The most average beer that I've ever rated on this site!"
"In the long run could become a little heavy, so to avoid on summer days, but interesting at other times."
"It's drinkable enough, and decent enough. Not huge, but smooth and quaffable."
"O: Good session beer. Not overwhelming but was well worth trying."
"This is a true british session beer."
"Cheers!"
"Sweetish, thin and flat so easy to slam if you're into that. May explain it's popularity."
"Pint, dark brown mahogany colour, hazy. No head. Had a sweet wheaty smell. Some kentish or sussex hops.Tasted very slightly of cherries. Medium bitter, not too sweet. Medium mouthfull, no real fiz decent bitter to session, but not complex. Overall good."
"Good taste and refreshing, i.e. a good beer. On-tap at The Porcupine at Charing Cross Rd."
"d - A nice ESB I was glad I got to try. Pretty generic overall but enjoyable. Would drink again."
"Pleasant surprise! Poured with a small light tan to cream colored head with lots of lace. Color is a very clear medium amber. Aroma is woody, leather, hoppy, a little malt, and earthy. Flavor's similar to aroma and with richer malt plus a good malt sweetness to hop bitterness balance. Great British hop character. Very good beer. Excellent finish. Clean. Definitely a session."
"A plain old pint of bitter; no trouble to sip but nothing to go out of your way for."
"Overall - A pretty good beer... nothing ground breaking but very drinkable... worth a try..."
"It is velvety smooth and pleasant."
"Like the Cornish Coaster, I really enjoyed this one from Sharp's. Had this out of a gravity fed cask at the Bree Louise near Euston Station. Dark amber in colour, with plenty of resinous hop aroma and flavour. Big malt backing and full mouth feel. It being a rare sunny day in London and the beer a little warmer than an Aussie is use to, I found the 4% alcohol less drinkable than some of the other Ales I sampled."
"a CAMRA beer of the year (2004) award is promising, but also raises the bar of expectations .... but this brew doesn't need to hide itself... medium bodied but fully flavored and balanced, resinous spices overshadowed by a palate of succulent dried figs and mangos ... great cornish ale ...."
"The beer just doesn't taste right to me, too sweet, especially in the aftertaste. it has an almost sickly smooth feel to it, very strange for an English bitter."
"M&D: light-bodied and very lively-textured. It's a easy-drinking standard bitter that is not to excite but to quench one's thirst. Good quality though."
