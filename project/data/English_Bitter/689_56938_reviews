"06/12/12 On tap this is a genuinely pleasant surprise. Humidity outside is 96% so this truly refreshing brew hits the spot. At only 4.2% I could drink this all day...& probably should, but some brawnier cousins are calling."

"Overall: While it's not something I'll necessarily seek out, I respect it for what it is: a truly sessionable beer that manages to offer considerable flavor and some degree of complexity. Not everything works perfectly, but it's better than about 90% of beers in its ABV range and that are as thin, and that's saying something."

"Overall: Balanced and drinkable. Plenty of flavor but goes down smooth. The malt is central but the noble hops truly shine as a supporting role in this session. I always find french oak to be very subtle but imparting strong vanilla notes. This is an incredibly intriguing, drinkable beer."
""
"Overall Drinkability: I appreciate this beer a lot more after drinking it. A nice change of pace for oak-aged beer fans."
""
""
"Overall, this is a beer worth getting a six pack of. I strongly suggest giving Long Haul a try. It is more than just a session al.e"

"This is a solid beer. Nice complexity for a beer clearly labeled ""session beer"". Nicely done. Good fall beer for afternoons of getting stuff done."

"This is a very unique tasting beer, well worth a try."

"Quite sessionable. Descent flavors and well balanced. I could drink a few of these."

"Overall still a pretty darn good beer."
""

"Taste: Very rich oaky nuttiness right off the bat here. The kicker with this bitter ale is the balance that the high hoppage and the strong use of wheat creates with the malt. Overall, this is a really freakin smooth beer with great balance. Extremely drinkable. I guess the bottle name ""Session"" says it all."
"Overall definitely not the best idea or ale they had. The same french oak on IPA does wonders but these bitters aged just made it tart and unenjoyable."
""
""

"O: a nice brew, drinks crisp and smooth, good taste, overall enjoyable could find it better on a very hot summer day after, or while, mowing the lawn"

"O: obviously a sessionable beer and you could do a lot worse than this. However, based on the look and smell, I expected more in the flavor. I think this could use a tad more malt or some more of the oak to cut what I believe to be a slightly unpleasant aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: there is sweetness, floral, nice bitterness ending pinu a little bit earthy, the final is long bitter tasting, a little bit dry"
""
""
"I think this beer succeeds in what it's trying to be. This is definitely tasty enough to be a true session beer, but I've had other lower ABV's that have packed in better flavor."
"Overall, this beer will make you realize how great common, American session beers could be, but are not. This is a wonderfully executed brew."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, gingerbread like malt and a small oak note. In the taste, quite oaky and a gingerbread malt that goes from sweet to dry. A small bite amd medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry gingerbread like malt aftertaste. Quite English, and a nice mellow oak."
"This is an ok beer. It's sessionable, but the fairly lackluster taste and foaming mouthfeel are a turn-off. If you want a sessionable ale, Two Brothers' pale ale is only slightly more alcoholic and boasts more complexity to this."
"Overall a good beer. Nothing exceptional, but a great amount of flavor for a session beer. Would drink again, but won't seek it out."
"Long Haul Session Ale is a brown colored ale, with a small bubbly white head. The body is pretty clear with just a slight haze. The aroma of this brew has both caramel malt and bitter hop elements to it. Maybe a bit of fruit as well. As I take a sip and look into it, I find out that the beer is oak-aged for at least a month, and that oakiness comes through. I would say that flavor dominates the rest, which consists of light hops and a bit of bitter hop. Some apple comes through as well. Medium bodied and very sharp on the tongue."
"Pours a pale copper color with a nice foamy head. Very light aroma, some malty sweetness and hints of vanilla. In the flavor, pale malts, mild caramel sweetness, and definate oak presence. Chalky yeast and tannins coat the palate. Still, mild in its flavors, simple, but a nice session brew at 4.2%. The lightest oak influenced brew I've come across as well."
"O: Really a strange beer. The idea just doesn't make any sense to me."
"O: A very flavorful session beer. The oak aging really ads a lot. Good drinkability, though it is a little more sour than I would like it."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. The hop aroma is adequate, but nothing too incredible. The taste is good. It has a smooth, somewhat bitter flavor that boasts of English hops and pale/crystal malts. It's an easy drinking beer that's well balanced and quite flavorful. It's a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a solid session ale. It's nothing bold, but drinks well and is accessible to most people."
"Pours darker brown than I expected with off white head; there is a little bit of lacing and good retention. The smell is pleasant malt but not too pungent. The body is medium but very smooth. The French oak aging has given this beer a nice tangy bite, but it isnâ€™t near as noticeable as it is in the Resistence IPA. This is a great pale ale with a unique fruitiness and delicious malt finish, I could easily have a few of these."
"D -- Fitting to the intention of brewer, nice but not really grabbing me. Definitely more interesting than a domestic adjunct lager but nothing amazing."
"Overall I thought this beer was ok but I don't know that I'll order it again."
"O- Drinks easy, but I became tired of it quickly."
"Sunday afternoon hockey...which is a rarity...usually we are at 10pm or later. So we make the most of it by having a BBQ afterward!! Our silky Defensemen stopped by Two Bros on his way to All Seasons to pick up two growlers of Long Haul...and they tasted mighty fine after a 6-1 win. The color was a nice carmelly clear with white foamy head. The smell was hinted with malt, other than that not much there. The taste was very well balanced and quite nice after sweatin my ass off. SESSION is a great description for this beer....could drink it in droves!!!!"
"Overall, a pretty good session beer, as promised. Worth a try, but Two Brothers have other better beers."
"O: At 4.2, you can have all you want and still not tie one on. It's a good practice beer."
"O: The low alcohol content makes this beer sessionable. I could easily drink more than one of these in a sitting because the sourness keeps the taste interesting."
"I admire any brewery who, in this age of mindless hoppy excess, puts such care into building a flagship session. This is a very, very nice beer."
"O: Very tasty beer! I'd definitely have it again."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a copper clear color with a 1.5 finger head of light tan that quickly settles, leaving some lace as it goes down. The aroma is that of sweet, lighlty toasted bread or biscuit. I don't pick up really any of the oak notes but it does have a ever so slight fruity aroma to it they may be caused by the oak. Medium/light mouthfeel. Sweet caramel like start with a light drawn out flavor that just sort of melts away. Nothing overpowering here in this one. Would like to see maybe a dash more hop character to this along with possibly more of the oak. Overall, not bad. The plusses are the looks and the light ABV which makes it a solid choice for a light beer."
"Great concept and brew from Two Brothers this would be something that would be excellent in an English Pub on cask, kind of underperforms in its current state."
"What the Hell did I just get myself into? This beer pours a cloudy amber hue with a thick head that slowly settles. Lacing is sticky and coats the glass. Smell is somewhat off, with a cider-like aroma and some caramel malt. Almost like oxidization of a wine. Taste is a bit better, with some caramel malt notes, along with some floral hops. Creamy mouthfeel and a dry finish express the style, although the smell and flavor didn't do it for me. Session ale? no. This beer just seems wrong in many ways. Sorry, but maybe a third brother could come in to make this beer right."
"Pours a moderately-dark copper color with a single-finger off-white head. A bit of spotty lacing and a nice cap and collar as it goes down. The nose brings some slightly-caramelized malt along with a touch of fruit and some toffee. The taste is mildly bitter and somewhat sweet, mostly focusing on bready malt with a bit of caramel. Medium body with lower levels of carbonation. Pretty nice all around. I'd certainly pick this up again."
"Wicked easy drinking and totally poundable. Way tastier than expected, and nearly meets the ""session beer"" definition of <=4.0%. I don't often enjoy, or therefore even drink, beers this light. I was pleasantly impressed by this one recently and picked up some more to give it an honest review. And enjoy."
"Hazy, somewhat coppery color. decent head on top. Astringent and detergent like aroma. More of the same flavor wise-very soapy and detergent like flavors. A lot of sulfur and yeast. Overly hopped and bitter. No malt to balance anything against. Ok body. In a word-BLEH. Homebrew gone bad. I would give these guys another chance but this was plain lousy. Would not buy thats for sure."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Another nice, very drinkable beer from Two Brothers. This one is a good, solid beer all around. It has a nice color and the depth and aroma is very enjoyable. Its flavor isn't as deep as its color, but, in general, it's a simple, yet very enjoyable drink. This is a beer that I could stick with all night!"
"D: I find this to be extremely drinkable, it even tastes like there should be more ABV then there is. Great tastes and complexities. A solid session brew from Two Brothers."
"D - Lots of flavor for a session brew. It wouldn't be a first choice for me honestly, but it has some nice balance going on with a good finish."
"Pours a crystal clear dark copper/amber color with a short creamy head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of a sweet bready malt with some brown sugar notes; perhaps a touch of vanilla as well. The flavor is of a steely caramel malt, some fruity and metallic notes, sour oak, grassy/earthy hops, and a bit of a brown sugar/brown ale thing going on. The feel is light to moderate with soft to tingly carbonation; generally sweet but has a touch of sour and bitterness to help balance. A very well made and solid feeling brew. A big plus for the 4.2abv."
"After an almost never ending trip of bad tasting beer I can't believe how good this beer is. I love Two Brothers call me partial but I just proved why I love em. This is a nice dark session ale aged on French Oak Foudres...whatever it takes this beer definitely doesn't suck. Appears a dark caramel amber hue with a bright white head finely speckled evenly across my pint glass. Aroma has hints of apple cider, french oak, and fruity undertones. Flavor is wonderful dark fruit, raisin, tart apple and oak belonging on my palate as a comprehensive flavor profile with each sip. Carbonation is mellow has all get out, and it goes down smoother than any other barrel aged beer I've ever had. Extreme flavor but limited alcohol and body that doesn't outweight, long haul is a perfect concept meant for the craft beer revolution. Drinkability incredibly satisfying I can't get enough of this beer next time or if it ever comes into PA I will swear to buy cases of Two Brothers and drink regularly."
"D- The ABV on the beer makes this very drinkable. Although this beer is not my style at all and I don't really care for it flavor wise. This beer is judged on the style and not my personal preference though therefore it gets the marks it does."
"Good, not great, for a session-a /real/ session ale for gonzo exxxtreme American beers."
"D: Overall a strange yet sessionable brew. All the flavors work to make this drinkable."
"Hazy coppery/scarlet red body. Thin beige head recedes to nothing quickly and the light rimming left behind leaves sparse lace. Aroma is toffee malts blended with nougat and oak tones. Base flavor is toffee/nougat malt base. Crispy and dry hop presence. Light oak notes. Everything is very even keeled and easy going. Decent enough."
"I had this on tap at the brewpub as part of the tour as recommended highly by the tour guide...A light copper color with some ok retention...The aroma is super weird, malty caramel with spices, french fries, only a slight bit of oak...Taste is mostly malt a little oak, just boring. I'm senxing a trend here in their beers, light oak, not where would should be and boring."
"Although TBBC Long Haul Session Ale sounds good on paper, it falls a bit short when beer meets taste buds. It might be worth a brief jaunt (single bottle) if you're curious about an oak-aged English bitter from an American craft brewery, but it isn't worth a long haul (sixer) for this BA."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes very slowly into nice sticky lacing all the way down the glass. This is a nice looking beer. The aroma is of toffee, vanilla, caramel, a hint of cherry, and toast. This isn't the strongest aroma, but it has very good complexity. The taste is similar to the aroma, and full of wonderful subtleties. The finish is of lingering vanilla and very mild cherry. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer that I will surely drink again."
"Overall a decent ale."
"Pours a dark amber with a small head that did not last very long. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. In the aroma I pick up some diacetyl and a little acidity. A little vanilla comes out as well. I do not detect any hops which is unfortunate. I taste a lot of malt that gives this beer a bready nature. The diacetyl comes out again. Not a deal breaker in this style. Very balanced between the malt and hops. Hard to conclude that this beer has had any ""special aging"". I would place this beer more into the ESB style as it is more balanced than a Bitter. Light body with very low carbonation. Could of used a little more life in the body. About the only great thing about this beer is its low ABV which would make this sessionable. Just not that well crafted to want to buy this again though."
"D: for as many flavors as I was able to pluck from this beer, I can't say I enjoyed this one."
"D: Amazing. I can't believe this is only 4.2% abv. This is what craft brewers should be making to compete with BMC"
"D: i like that they made a lower abv session beer. i like that they tried something different with the oak/barrel aging. i just didn't like the result too much."
"There's not much unsessionable about this one."
"Purchased from Binny's Beverage Depot in Warrenville, IL. Pours a medium amber body with a thin white head. Aroma is of peach and fleshy fruit and lemon grass. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. The initial fleshy fruit flavors lead to a more caramelly and dusty finish. Very unique flavors. Good drinkability."
" An interesting and flavorful beer for the relatively low ABV. Nicely balanced and certainly sessionable."
"D- easy to put back a couple, and with the low ABV it wouldnt be a bad idea. the biggest drawback is the price tag, at 10$ for 6."
" D- Malt flavor is a bit old or dull tasting but it is quickly overtaken by pure pungent hops. This doesn't really taste like a session beer as the hops out of bounds compared to malt and other flavors."
"D: This is a well named beer, as it is a very easy beer to session with."
"D-This was one really nice, easy drinking beer. I went into this one blind figuring that it would be something sessionable (duh), but besides that I didn't know what to expect. The chocolate malt notes pushed this beer over the top for me in terms of grabbing my interest."
"D: this beer is intriguing in concept (oak aged session ale), but it falls short due to its lack of flavor. It is a decent session beer as it is easy drinking and low in alcohol, but nothing here stands out."
"A good choice for a no frills session. There is not a lot going on, but it is still very enjoyable. Recommended."
"Easy drinking, fits the name, its clearly a low alcohol session style ale, not bad."
"This pared real well with a cheddar burger. This beer won't be one of the bold and brawny standouts, but that isn't what its designed to do, so don't be put off by its rating."
"Overall...drinkable, but not memorable. Could do without the metallic quality."
"Medium heft in the mouth, lightly carbonated, just a decent drinker for the seasons between summer and winter. Very drinkable, one to keep around as a regular. A very decent Bitter from this side of the pond."
"D: An interesting beer to end up in a barrel considering the hyped up beers being put in them today, but I really like what the barrel has done to this beer and think that subsequent versions of this beer could get even better. There are some weaker points to this beer where it seems things tend to wash together midway though the drinking session, but otherwise this beer adds up to a fine session beer."
"D: A decent session bitter that comes off as uncluttered, unfussy, and well, uninspiring. I'll revisit this as the weather gets warmer."
"This is a decent beer, more of one i'm buying to give a bottle to alot of my BMC drinking friends as a gateway beer, as its great as a gateway beer. It's very interesting to have for the Beer geek because of the Oak presence in this style of beer, but not enough for a whole six pack."
"Fairly nondescript toasted malt aroma, almost lagerish in a way. Not getting any oak here. Flavor is malt dominated, maybe a kiss of fruit from the yeast. Somewhat dry finish with mild bitterness. Easy going, light bodied, even carbonation. Searching for any oak character and coming up short. Fits the bill for a warm weather session beer, but not especially complex or memorable."
"drinkability is good - yes i could drink this beer all day but just not at 9.99 a sixer"
"This a malty smooth, and faintly grainy feeling beer. A very flavorful and unique session ale that I would love to have on tap."
"The label on this one tells it all, this is the session beer."
"This is my second six pack of this stuff and it won't be my last. I'd love to try this on a hand pull."
"Not really working for me, smell is a bit off and taste is mediocre at best...the Resistance IPA is a much better offering if you want to try the new Two Bros oaked beers..."
"Warmed up and the oak seems to express itself a little more with a very woody character, as opposed to the vanilla which it can sometimes contribute to beer. Overall, pretty tasty, and much bolder than it's alcohol content would suggest. Perhaps it could have a bit more body, at least up front, but I would drink this one again."
