"Tasteless, has no oomph. Looks cloudy and amazing. Doesn't deliver on anything other than that."

"O: Pretty good."

"Delicious, but a little weak in ABV for me. Purchased in Italy."

"really underwhelmed by this red ale, i expected much more, just based on how good the cream stout is. this one falls a bit flat of that mark, but my bottle may not have been stored or handled properly, so that could be a factor. no bottle date to check either. frothy brick red color, pretty clear, glowing darker amber. the nose is stale english malt, muted and dusty, not real appealing, and the yeast seems weird in it, like bread dough or something, unfinished. notes of oatmeal and sweeter red malt on the front end, and barley a bittering hop to finish. i like the mouthfeel pretty well, real frothy and sturdy, especially for a beer so low in alcohol, but there is a weird tannic thing running through it, and with the staleness of the grain, i really dont care much for it. i love their packaging, i find it distinct and alluring, but if these green bottles are responsible for light struck beer, im not a fan anymore. this bottle exhibited those properties for sure. i will revisit this again when i can guarantee its freshness."

"Overall: a drinkable and tasty bitter. Perhaps I should go to Britain and attempt to quaff a few of these down the local pub."

"interesting flavour combinations and beer - liked it a lot - but the bitterness from the hops seemed a little out of place or wasn't quite in balance but probably being too picky as everything else about the beer was great"

"The taste is of malts but the odd chocolate note I got on the nose is not as noticeable in the taste. A kind of herbal quality too. The ending is slightly bitter and lingers to a dry a finish."

"O: Nice beer for the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very decent stuff. Solidly, if unimaginatively made and providing a pleasant drinking experience. I think it's one of the stronger entries in the St Peters range."
""
"Food match: Roasted game meats like partridge, grouse, woodcock and venison. Also roasted wild pig on a spit would lend its medieval feel to the brew."

"Overall: Not my favorite red ale but at 4.3% this beer packs in a lot of flavor. I like the hint of cherry tart but could use just a bit more. Overall I really enjoyed this red ale and would buy it again."
"O - Good example of the style. Love the 18th century oval bottle too."
""
""
"A good example of style - and more importantly has travelled well. Would be very sessionable, but not at the price. Really good example of a moderately flavoured beer well made."
""
""
"Mouthfeel, slightly dry finish but this makes you want more!"
""
""
"Drinkability: It's smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""
"Put together with ideal carbonation and a real warming mouth feel that is not at all heavy it produces a splendid dark bitter for the darker days"
"D: I'd definitely agree with most critics that this ale is enduringly bitter even for a bitter, but I personally find that the complex flavour profile stands up to it. Besides, it's anything but a traditional bitter; it's distinctly unorthodox, rather sophisticated, and definitely worth a try. Especially in autumn or winter."
"Wow! Big hoppy chewy red, yet very English. Not surprised to read it’s Cascade in there. Red Rocket’s little sister?"
"Tasty - I was surprised by how much was going on with this ale. A strong malt flavour with more bitterness than expected, but nicely balanced by subtle aromatic hops. Good stuff - seek it out...."
"Very smooth, easy to drink. Perhaps not a session beer as its very rich but ideally savoured in low quantity."
"Not a bad beer, went down pretty well, but the tartness is becoming a bit over-powering. Tone that down a touch (perhaps on cask or fresher it would do better?) and this would be a great English bitter. As it stands, this is merely a good English bitter."
"This is a rather nice Fall / Winter beer, but I wouldn't have more than two in a sitting."
"Really a nice beer, nothing particularly exceptional, just good, well-articulated flavors in a balanced, deliciously drinkable ale. One for all seasons."
"Overall this beer does well I almost falls into the hopped amber category."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style English bitter."
"What a great ale..well made, quenching, flavorful, approachable and satisfying world class red bitter. I wish I could get this all the time."
"Living on this side of the Atlantic, St. Peter's will never be my favourite brewery. Granted, they make an impressive array of fairly decent, albeit pedestrian, offerings that would likely be real treats if available fresh, local and on cask. Ruby Red, however, like seemingly all this brewery's offerings, shows that conventional beer is rarely all that colourful."
"Mouthfeel is good but the aftertaste is too dry to be really enjoyable."
"Overall a decent, well made beer and one worth repeating. Too bad this only comes in a gift pack in Ontario or I might buy more."
"This is a very nice example of a well-hopped red ale. It would hold up to any standard pub fare and would be good for a couple of rounds alone, but the hop finish might beg a changeup after that."
"Medium bodied with a lean drying sensation."
"D - I could definitely have a few of these in a row, the finish of the hop bitterness might get a bit much after a while, but right now I wish i had about 2 more bottles to go with my dinner! This beer is quite well balanced and is certainly on my list of beers to drink more of."
"This beer pours a deep reddish-copper color (I wouldn't exactly call it Ruby). Nice off-white head, though. The aroma is a nice mix of toasted malts and herbal hops. It has an English hop aroma, with some spice and resiny characteristics. Not bad, but it's not the kid of aroma that jumps at you. The taste is semi-dry. Some fruit, but mostly toasted malt and hops. The beer has a firm and satisfying mouthfeel. Full body, more than the taste and aroma lets on. This one is quite drinkable."
"M&D: the carbonation is just light enough to render a refreshing texture, while the body remains medium for the moderate flavour profile. Overall, this dark amber malty ale gets rather good support from the hops, from time to time showing a necessary sour-fruity edge to balance off the sweetness and bitterness. This is a balanced ale to me and I'd have no problem having a few if in good mood!"
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced, tasty, and extremely sessionable. i bet this would be pretty excellent on cask..."
"Mouthfeel was carbonated and light. Drinkability is good on this one, wont fill you up, and you could easily drink this all night if you wanted too."
"I liked it, but I couldn't stay on it all night."
"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 4.3%. Deep copper to chestnut colour, moderate off-white head. Pleasant aroma of malts with moderate notes of caramel, earthy and fruity hops (Styrian Goldings) also come up front. The flavour is malty and woody but not sweet, and there are plenty of hops throughout, with a fairly bitter aftertaste. Good beer!"
"This is a fantastic English Bitter. Balanced with an aggressive hoppiness, I could session it all night."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light ruby color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of dry English hops with some very light caramel malt. Taste is also dominated by some subtle dry English-style hops with a subtle malt presence. I was expecting a bit more and I thought the body was too thin."
"Fairly drinkable and not dissapointing, a lot of hop character"
"the best bitter ive ever had by far"
"I found this very drinkable and think it's a shame that they don't sell this as a single at the shop that I go to because I would probably buy this often."
"A mild bitter freshly brought in from the UK. A light grapefruit colour with a bit of soapy head, all that remains from initial malt foaminess. A moderate malty aroma. Its like an amber, well balanced with a bit of toastiness and hop bitterness. Smooth drinking. Average mouthfeel."
"Pours a cloudy orange/reddish, very thick and chunky off white head forms, very rocky, drops a ton of lace, nice rings, looks really great, head is insane on this one. Smell is nice, caramel, bready, citrus, orange peel, grains, sweet and sugary, light fruity kick, quite nice, bit of herbal hopping. Taste is similar, very malty, caramel, bready, some grains, light bit of fruit, herbal/medicinal and lightly sour finish, orange peel, very caramelized at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very drinkable, not the most flavourful but very solid."
"This is lovely. I wish I could get this in singles, this one was out of a gift pack."
"D - If I had regular access to this at a better price ($7.99AUS 500ml bottle) it would be a mainstay. A highly flavourful beer at a pretty low ABV%."
"Pours a clear deep red under a pinkish head that couldn't muster more than 1/2 finger despite a very hard pour. The head fades fast back to film and thin collar, but still manages to leave some very nice lace lines. The strong floral hop and raspberry nose is very enticing. The mouth is mildly carbonated and fiarly light. Strong and distinctive taste of bready malt with a touch of peppermint and a good dose of espresso-like dry bitter hops. The hops last longest, providing an intense bitter for the back of the throat. Must drink more..."
"Overall - An average beer.... worth a try once... not one of St. Peter's best...."
