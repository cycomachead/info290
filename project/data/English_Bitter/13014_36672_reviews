"Starting the Super Bowl evening off right with some badass K-Tina K-So (patent pending) and a Bitter Brewer.  This stuff pours a mostly clear brass-tawny topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises grass, sharp flowers, light biscuit, and a touch of resin for the sake of it.  The taste brings in more of the same, the bready biscuit somewhat tempering the grass, but still allowing those hops to shine.  The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish that keeps the grassy twang from malingering.  Overall, a very enjoyable little beer, something I could easily see myself having more of in the future (if not tonight, even)."

"Poured a light golden color. Light sweet aroma. Interesting taste. It has this buttery characteristic that reminds me of Abrasive. Also has a gritty maltyness to it. It’s decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite session ales. Right there with Day Tripper from Indeed and GO TO by Stone."
""
""
"I like this.  I could add this to my regular rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So crushable.  Tons of caramel and a little coffee like in the finish.  Deelish."
""

"O- very flavorful session beer that emphasizes orange and floral hop notes, balanced out by some toasty malt, very good   4"

"Not sure I'd call this an ESB but it's pretty good for what it is."
"Quite good for what it is. Has a nice, fresh hop profile throughout with a nice malt flavor at the end. Not a super bitter beer, but definitely more bitter than sweet. Bitter Brewer is pretty tasty, but it reminds me a little too much of a session IPA, which is a style that I'm rarely impressed by. Still worth checking out, though maybe not at the price of $3.19 a can."

"I like the fruitiness of this beer, especially fresh on tap, but the body is a bit too thin and the older can doesn't hold up quite as well. 3.65"

"Brilliant golden brew with grassy, dank, resiny aromas that are contrasted by grapefruit add tangerine, with a hint of biscuit malt. Flavor reveals sharp grapefruit, with a touch of tangerine sweetness,a light, crackery malt backbone, and a minerally, slightly bitter finish. Would've liked more citrus than minerally notes. There's a clash between tart lime and mineral characters that doesn't suit my palate."

"At Great Taste pre party (so I won't get technical).  Seems to be a nice representative of the style.  Served too cold.  Nice appearance, light copper.  Aroma of pine.  Mouthfeel is very reminiscent of the bitters do old.  Lower carbonated as expected.  Biscuity back flavor."

"O - Where I've found most bitters lack something at their core, this bitter is robust and fully realized, ultimately quite satisfying. This is not my favorite style, but this represents an exciting entry that I'd actually reach for when looking for a brew by the lake where I need to keep my edge."

"Surly Bitter Brewer ---4/5."

"O: Very easy to drink for the summer. Great to bring to the camper for the weekend and drink a handful."
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a nice Session Pale Ale, but in terms of ratings it as a Bitter I have to give it lower marks. The carbonation is too much and the hop bitterness goes way beyond “assertive”, it is downright intense. Will I drink this one again, for sure, but it isn’t really an English Bitter."

"D: This is a nice little bitter and would go great if served as a Real Ale. All things considered it is well balanced and offers up some good flavor points. It is far from any type of a game changer but I don’t think of an ESB in that regards any matter. Just a really well crafted brew with no frills. Glad to have tried but not something I would probably go seeking out."

"Another impressive brew from Surly. Easy to drink, nice balance, and flavorful. Well worth picking up."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this, as most other Surly offerings has not failed to impress. The tropical and citrus hop character was the highlight for me. Fans of Surly's IPA's will likely appreciate this one."

"O - first English bitter I've tried, enjoyed it"
""
""
""
"O: Extremely sessionable refreshing but never boring bitter. English syles arn't really my thing but this one blew me away. Drink it fresh and often."
""
"Taste is indeed bitter upfront with some creaminess and caramel flavor in the body. Solid ESB that drinks very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter Brewer pours a darker copper color, with a small dissipating head. There is this amazing bitter aroma, with hints of hops; very crisp. The flavor has this this very dry crisp taste, with a nice mix of a pale malts, and just a tad of hops. Nice full flavors and body, and finishes with this amazing dryness. Overall I love it, very drinkable flavorful and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O-An easy drinking summer beer, with some hop bite. However the tea-like flavors are not doing anything for me."
""
"O: Haven't had a lot of English Bitters (like most N.Americans it seems except when it comes to this one), but this one finds a very nice balance of something that isn't too sweet, too hoppy, too heavy... just a perfect pub summer sipper... if anything I think this could do with a little more malt complexity and would like to try it on cask, to see if it could be a little smoother or something...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a slighty fizzy, somewhat watery mouthfeel. Closes quite dry, with light residual stickiness clinging to the lips and palate."
""
"O/D-This was a slight disappointment but I did not know how low the ABV was until I looked up and check while reviewing. This was a pretty neat beer but I think its a bit overrated due to how well Surly is received in the craft beer community."
""
""
"Overall: Having had benchmarks from the origin of the style, this doesn't quite measure up. Still, it is a well made ale and glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very drinkable beer. Nice Americanized take on a classic bitter, although way out of style with the hopping. Will be drinking more of these this summer for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really an enjoyable beer to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Extremely flavor packed and sessionable take on the style,I had this beer outside on an early summer day and it was a great fit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A decent beer that fits within style guidelines while still unique enough to pick out of a lineup. It's beers like Bitter Brewer that give hope for a future wave of low ABV beers being the craft beer trend. Would I drink it again? Sure."
" The combination of American hops with the traditional ingredients found in an English-style Bitter works incredibly well. Surly hit a home run here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An awesomely sessionable beer that does not lack for flavour whatsoever- whether its from the malts or the hops. We don't have the chance to drink much English Bitters at all, but this is definitely a style I'm into. It's a good one to drink on the porch in the summer evening. (4.25)"

"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus and tea-like flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O: 4.25 - I am willing to chalk this up as Surly's session beer and, to be honest, as much as I like IPAs/DIPAs, it's their aroma/flavor and not their bitterness that appels to me, so an ESB is not a favorite style; this is a solid sessionable offering, but, with all the more flavorful options from Surly out there, I won't be buying this one again as, unfortunately, this is their most underwhelming beer on my palate"

"Pours an opaque amber with a medium head. The nose is very floral with some spicy hops and a hint of sweet caramel. Flavor has earthy tea notes and pale malts with mild hoppy spice and an earthy bitterness. Finishes with a subtle hop taste that lingers."
""
""
"The perfect brew for any summer activity. Well done."

"O) Really enjoyed this beer. As stated above, excellent drinkability, and at 4% ABV, you could drink quite a few of them. I've really been impressed by everything I've had from Surly thus far. Glad to recommend."
""
""
"An okay beer."
"Cheers Aaron!"
"This can came in an unexpected but very welcomed package from a friend who has family in Minnesota. It pours with a warm, light orange-amber color and a big, fluffy, sticky head. The aroma provides a nice balance of sweet caramel malt and some light herbal hops. The flavor likewise blends fruity, sweet malts with a bright yet somehow musty combination of hops, and the light effervescence further lightens the flavor profile. Overall, this beer , has a nice earthy quality, but it is at the same time light, bright, sweet, and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It is a solid, tasty, and sessionable brew — perfect for the Twin Cities’ future MLS hooligans."
""
""
""
"Addendum: well I'll be damned if the Sox just didn't tie it after vomiting themselves."
""
""
""
""
"The weakness of this beer is the mouthfeel and arguably balance. The resulting beer is all hops and in order to keep the ABV down, the malt backbone isn't quite there. That said, this is no thin beer. There is lacing left on the glass, and the resulting beer is still quite enjoyable, especially on a warm day, or when you want a session beer."
""
""
""
"O - Overall I liked this better, somehow, than Surly Furious. A Very tasty English Bitter."
""
"This is an excellent beer to expand the horizons of American light lager drinkers, I know from past experience that when Bud drinkers try something from Stone or Rogue its basically like culture shock to them, but this beer in its light but yet solid taste of dry hops, etc. one might just find another convert to the world of great ales and lagers."
""
""
""
""
"O: When I first popped this can and took a swig, I was more than impressed. This beer was really packing some flavor for it's mild 4% ABV. But as a I got about half way through, the flavor became less bright and much darker and one-note. It really just seemed to fall off. I do wonder if this beer has more age on it than it should (there appears to have been a valiant attempt to date the can, but the date is illegible) that is resulting in some of the earthy flavors that seem to be dominating this beer."
""
""
"Tastes very much like it smells, almost like a very light west coast APA only with Surly's excellent yeastmanship helping hold everything together. The hops are subtle yet variegated, the malt is sweet, and the balance is superb."
""

"Had during the 2nd Annual Redneck Racin’ & Tastin’ while watching the dirt track race! Big thanks goes out to marine1975 for this one! Served from can into a shaker. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, bitter hop, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, bitter hop, earth, and earth hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really liked the hop profile on this one as the earthiness mixed really well with the bitter hops. While it was good it definitely didn’t stand out compared to other brews I’ve had from the style. Glad I got the chance to try this one again as my review ended up disappearing…"
""
""
"Yep, it's definitely English... Unique and stylish. Nothing memorable about this one, just refreshing. Perfect for a hot and humid day. Can't Recommend."
""
""
""
""
"O- Surly just delivers... plain and simple. Bitter brewer is another example of a completely drinkable beer that is full of flavor. Best english bitter I have ever experienced!"
"Likely my favorite example of the style I've sampled thus far, though the U.S. hops probably diverge from stylistic tradition quite a bit."
""
"Great brew from the folks at Surly. I look forward to trying many more of their offerings. 4.0"
"Enjoy this herbal and buttery bitter, or three, if you can."
""
"Cost: $8.49 for a four pack."
"O: Good, solid English Bitter. No real complaints here."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad number at all. Again, would like to see a little more balance in the taste, but pretty drinkable & enjoyable."
"this is an excellent session ale, and a great esb. perfect for the summer heat! great taste, great mouthfeel, and looks excellent.. though, not too great on the nose, session beers are very hard to get this high of a rating. job well done by surly."
""
""
""
"D/O: This pale ale features nuanced charms that seem a bit retro when one weighs its malt focus and hops that maintain a complimentary role. While the hop qualities are never really featured, they do vary from the beginning to the end of the flavor profile, leaving the drinker with a nagging perception of inconsistency. Its English qualities are well-cultivated, however, and at 4% abv it drinks as easily as a traditional bitter ought to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Overall, an easy and light drink; not bad and very easy for the summer; I'd pass on another as the watery texture is a bit of a turn-off"
""
"Overall - I enjoyed Honker's Ale before as my goto Bitter Ale, but now it looks like I have a new favorite. It looks good, smells great, tastes great, and feels absolutely refreshing. What more can I say? I will miss Surly when I move to Chicago, but hopefully I will see it once I move there!"
"Overall this is truly a world-class session beer. So much flavor in such a light bodied, low abv brew. The only draw back is that it is Surly, so it is not cheap at $9 per 4-pack. My go too brew the spring camp/boating trips. Recommended to all who can get it. Cheers!"
""
"Overall, I think this beer is too often overlooked. Very tasty and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
"O - definitely a unique brew with a pleasant hop mix and a prominent bitter finish, well crafted"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This stuff is incredibly tasty and leans more on the hopped up english bitter than a traditional bitter. Loads of flavour, insanely drinkable, and an all around scrumptious ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No head at all has a grassy smell analyte mouthful nonalcoholic or heat when it goes down bitter taste you can also taste the hop more than you can taste the mall it's got this fresh hop fail flavored as well as Woody and spice and very low carbonation"
"Pours a slightly cloudly light brown with fluffy white head. Aroma is subtle and nice. Some mild hops (nothing too fruity or piney) up front with a solid malt backbone. The taste is all about balance. Really nice hop bitterness with just enough complexity to keep you going back for more. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side which contributes to its drinkability. Overall this is a really nice brew. If I lived within distribution this would definitely be an everyday favorite. Nothing amazingly out of the box but that is not what they are trying to do here, just a solid brew."
""
""
""
""
"This is absurdly drinkable, and it has way more flavor than the 4% ABV would imply. It's relatively mild, but that is the point. For the style, Surly has nailed this."
""
""
""
"A delicious bitter. I would love to have more of this."
""
""
"Light bodied beer and extremely drinkable. Petty layered and somewhere between clean and oily, more towards the clean side yet reasonably crisp. Slight bitter pinch at the end and well carbonated. Overall a really good beer. Perfect beer if you're not sure what you're in the mood for drinking at the moment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- awesome sessionable beer. I can't wait to order a bunch of this when it drops fresh next year!"
"Very enjoyable. Another fine beer from Surly."
"O – A great session brew."
""
""
""
""
"Truth be told this isn't a favorite style of mine and while the nose isn't true to the style it's more enticing to me than the dry, bitter mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very clean and crisp. The citrus came thru in the taste more than the smell. Which I loved. The mouthfeel is fantastic with this brew. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Lots of flavor for 4% ABV. Not quite as good as Founder's All Day or 21st Amendment's Bitter American but I'd be glad for one of these any day."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with lots of sweet citrus hop flavor up front that lingers over the pale malt backbone into a slightly dry finish. The hop profile is one dimensional without much bitterness and not very dry. More sweet than anything with hints of tropical fruit and citrus peel countered by biscuity malts. Well balanced but not overly complex."

"Canned 28JUL11 A: pours orange with an ephemeral foam cap finishing in a central dome over this excellently clarified beer. No lace. (3) S: Some citric hops over a malty base layer. The malts may be a hint oxidized and it shows with a cardboard character. (3) T: Lots of pale malts and some nice sweetness from the oats give this a rural taste. Subtle and simple. (3.5) M: Thin with hi carb. The carb is sharp and a little too much for the body. Semi dry finish. (3) O: I could take it or leave it. I make a mild ale actually that is similar to this. I wouldn’t call it world class, but certainly sessionable. (3)"
"Ah, olde English Ale! To bad Bitters aren't more popular, I could drink beer like this all day long. This is what session beer is all about. Highly drinkable, but still very interesting. The hops really linger on the palate and remind you that while American hops may have assumed superiority, English varietals can still be very enjoyable."
"Could drink alot of this, a nice session beer."
"Overall - So hoppy that it isn't really genuine to the style. Lacking the malt backbone to justify the hop content. Still, an interesting take that I don't mind drinking. And you can't beat the flavor for the ABV."
"O - Unbelievably good for a beer at this ABV. Only Stone Levitation can compare in the low-ABV beer category. A fine beer to have at a pub, so as to avoid getting shit-faced."
"Definitely a bitter beer, but never gets close to the palate wrecking ways of an IPA. Everything about the flavor is exactly what I would expect from a bitter. Another very good job by Surly."
"Serving type: can"
"D- Overall this is a very drinkable beer. could drink a few of these in a sitting. It was good but i was hoping for a little more body and also looking for it to be a little more bitter. Ive had a few more Esb's that are a tad more flavorful. Def. give this a try though!"
"O: Not a bad beer and easy to drink"
"Pours a deep transparent amber orange with a large bubbled cream colored head. The nose is very hoppy, orange peel and leafy hop with a bit of stale biscuity bread up front and notes of tea. The flavor is less hoppy and has a bit of an empty finish, very tea like, some herbal leafy hops, with some underlying biscuit. Thin body, well carbonated, lacks depth in finish."
"O - A very welcome flavorful low abv brew. The citrus notes are quite nice."
"O: I really liked this, I think the flavors really popped off the body in a very unique and clean way. It was like taking a hoppy trip to a farm, setting fire to it, and then making a clean low ABV getaway. I enjoyed thick bitter flavors and chewy mouthfeels, but I don't feel trashed. I need to drink more bitters, as this one left me with a craving for more bitter sessionables."
"O - I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Very easy drinking, I could easily put down a few of these. Probably won't go too far out of my way to get this brew though, but wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"O It's an easy drink beer. I was expecting a bitter beer but not the case. I'd buy a 4 pack if I had the opportunity. Not bad."
"o - really nice session beer that packs a lot of flavor into a 4% ABV beer."
"Orange marmalade doesn't come through as well as the nose would suggest but its there and it's tasty. Earthy, grassy hops lead the charge. Bready malts showing slate like flavors, and fresh baked tea cakes. Great carbonation makes this beer amazing to drink. At this ABV I'm afraid it won't last long."
"D/O- Simple, yet highly effective. This is now the best ""lowest ABV to fullest flavor""-ed beer I've ever had. Bring me more of these English Bitters if they are anything like this, as I am quite impressed. Would love to be able to take this on summer outdoor adventures. Surly, again."
"Bitter Brewer looks a like a typical bitter if a bit paler and more golden than most, but my how it distances itself from its more modest English roots with huge orangish fruit flavors. It's in the nose and rules the taste buds. The beer is appropriately dry with a little bready malt, but also very crisp from the tangy hops. This is a beer that should catch the attention of BMC and craft drinkers alike. It's very hoppy without being stupidly bitter"
"O- A simple but very tasty beer. Would make for an excellent sessioner."
"O- A really good beer. If I wanted to have several beers in a night, I'd probably go this direction. Super flavorful."
"D - I fell this is the definition of a session beer. Really nice flavors and complexity, yet clocks in with an abv slightly above 4%."
"This is probably the best 4% abv beer I've ever had and whenever I have access to it, you can bet I'm buying it."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer and the hops in the nose are great. Well worth a shot."
"Terrific little session brew here... I could pound these..."
"O: Interesting beer. It's a much different beer than I expected. Tasting but strange at the same time."
"Overall a great session beer. A perfect blend of English malt and American hops. Who knew the two would get along so well together?"
"O: Really enjoyable and sessionable brew from Surly. Think it could've packed more abv considering how hefty it was in many other ways but I won't hold that against it. Definitely worth a shot, with unique flavors making this worth another try!"
"O - this is pretty good, also pretty weird."
"Pours a hazy cloudy golden orange. A nice bit of white frothy head. Good head retention. Smells... Bitter, mildly bitter and hoppy but more sweet and earthy than anything. Tstes similar. Low impact, subtle bitter hops compliment a very smooth sweet malt backbone. The mouthfeel is really impressive on this beer. Smooth, clean, thick, very drinkable. This beer is really enjoyable!"
"Overall Surly has done a great job with this flavor profile. Perfect for the summer rotation. The bitterness is only one piece of the puzzle, don’t let the name scare you away. Easy drinking with great aroma and flavor."
"Overall it's pleasantly bitter and easy to drink although the nose can be confusing and like I said, may set one's mind on a different track than English Bitter."
"Pours a clear copper with a 2-inch fluffy white head that leaves some spotty lacing as it dissipates. Big, fresh, and pungent hop aromas of grapefruit, orange, and pine with a slightly sweet toasted caramel malt backbone. Taste follows the nose closely, lots of pungent, floral hops with a nice toasted malt character. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with sharp carbonation. Great beer, uniquely American take on the English Bitter style."
"O: Again, a bit hoppier than I was expecting, but for me thats a good thing. I look forward to tying more in this style to see if this is an aberration. Extremely easy to drink."
"-If this were more available, I would be buying it all the time. really nice session!"
"O- so confused. It smelled terrific, looked great, and tasted like flavored water. Extremely disappointed"
"O: I've always had a soft spot for English bitters, and this is one of the best of them... and definitely the most citrusy!"
"I think this is a pretty good-looking beer... and one of my favorite Surly cans to date. Pours a nice orange-y yellow with moderate white head. Nose is decently hoppy, citrusy with a bit of a toasty malty background. Flavor follows suit. Toasty malt with a light hop bitterness, and bigger hop citrusy flavor. THe marmalade and toast comparison made on the can is not far off, though I might not think of it as quite THAT fruity. MF is decent for a bitter like this--light, well-carbonated, but not watery. Overall I enjoy this beer. It's a nice break from the more intense beers that Surly makes--a nice Surly-esque take on a session beer. Kind of like a light IPA (if Abrasive is a double IPA, then this is a half IPA). Nice beer, worth trying, wish it was cheaper than the other Surlys though."
"O: definitely would recommend a four pack of pint cans will run you 9$. Great at night after work. Surly knows what they are doing. That's why I bought the kit for this one."
"O - Very interesting, and I am loving it."
"Beer pours an orange color with a good frothy head. Smell is of grass and pine. Taste is slightly bitter with a citrus suggestion and a very dry finish. At 4% ABV, this is an excellent drinking session beer with a much higher hop profile than most beers with a lower ABV. Definitely a nice beer to drink on the boat during the summer."
"The CPJ"
"interesting and novel, a good beer."
"Eminently drinkable, but ultimately unexciting. I have a feeling this would have been a dramatically different beer in June, and I imagine that it's great on cask. For now, I can't see myself seeking out another can."
"Overall: Definitely a solid take on the style. The American hops really brighten the whole bitter experience and make it something unique. It's incredibly drinkable, and with the low ABV, even more so."
"Thanks Jon!"
"Man this hits the spot after a long day of work on a sticky Georgia summer day. Nice flavor and surprising bitterness for a low ABV session brew."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not too filling, low kick, nice representation of style. At first, this beer seemed slightly flat but actually ends up working out well."
"O-Another well balanced beer from Surly. Has a lot of flavor for a 4% ABV beer. My preference would be for a slightly less bitter hopped taste, but those who are fans of this style will likely approve."
"Pours a clearish, hazed dark copper colo with a quickly fading light tan head. Some sparse rings of lacing. Aroma is earthy and floral hops, tea, and biscuit malt. Flavor is balanced, smooth and finishes with an earthy bitter bite. Body is biscuit, bread, tea and earthy hops. Medium body with moderate carbonation. An odd beer, regardless of style classification, but very enjoyable for the ABV. Full of balanced flavor and mild citrus hops in the finish; nothing remarkable, but highly recommended if you've never had it."
"Appearance: 4/5; Aroma 3/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4.5/5"
"O - I enjoyed this beer a lot. One of the more simpler offerings that I've had from Surly, but I really enjoyed it. I honestly haven't had many beers from this style, but I could see myself easily putting a few of these down. Very sessionable and tasty."
"O: An enjoyable beer that if it had a bit more bite it would be a very sessionable (even by the crazy British definition :)"
"The beer is pretty thin. I would like a touch more carbonation and body (after all, this isn't cask conditioned). Overall, this is a very solid beer that I has multiple nits to pick over. I drank this at Bryant-Lake Bowl's excellent brunch, and it worked very well as a compliment to breakfast foods. I have to imagine that it is better out of the can, though, as this wasn't quite the beer that it was hyped to be."
"O: A very interesting light-bodied hoppy brew. Nice work on this one Surly -- a superior session brew which showcases a lot of flavor in a highly drinkable package."
"Color is dark orange with head the disappears quickly. It has a lot of earthly smells to it along with some citrus. The taste has a lot going for it considering the lower ABV. Very easy to drink. I was put off by the name of the beer for awhile, but after receiving it as a gift it is my go to session beer in the summer."
"O - Nose is great but goes downhill from there with me. A good summer beer."
"Easy drinking, low abv, and down right tasty."
"Overall, a great summer beer. I can't get enough of this stuff when it's hot out. Tons of flavor while still being extremely quaffable. Will keep a stock of this in my fridge when it's in season."
"all in all, I love it. a bit more potent than many bitters I've encountered, and one of the most flavorful 4% abv brews I've had in a while, but that makes is insanely drinkable and makes me wish i had a few more."
"Pours a translucent golden-brown. The nose is mild hops, mild malts and big orange, like tangerine. Nice. The taste is very low key citrus, slightly bitter hops and some proinounced malts. A lot given the ABV. Goes down crazy smooth, like the younger sibling of a good APA. Good carb and nice medium mouthfeel for the ABV/style. Overall, this is one of my favorite under 5% I've ever had. Very good stuff. Surly can brew some beer."
"O- a very sessionable beer and perfect for warm weather. Not one of my favorite surly offerings, but still a great brew. Could see myself drinking a few of these on a hot day"
"This is a very nice summer session ale. If you can drink sun, flowers, and citrus fruits, it would match this brew."
"O - Delicious brew after some nice hours of yard work. Well crafted malt and hops with a great malt backbone that is complimented by intense bitter hops."
"o - Overall another good beer from Surly. This one had a lot of orange and citrus to it. Was a great beer to have at the beach; would certainly like to have it again."
"O: As recommended by Romulux, a great bitter and refreshing Summer beer!"
"I'm impressed. This beer brings wonderful flavors and complexity, in a tidy little 4% ABV package. Tasty and refreshing. I will be drinking more of it."
"As I said, a fantastic summer drinker -- though likely not worth multiple repeat purchases considering the price. I'll stick to Furious or Bender for this kind of money."
"Overall extremely nice and super sessionable drinking brew, I just wish it had a little less wet character in feel to it, but that would be hard to pull off, and that probably wouldn't represent the style very well. The nose on this is just flat out fantastic."
"Overall: A very good summer brew that is lighter but packed with flavor. Good balance in the citrus sweetness, bread, and hops."
"Overall this is a great great great beer in the English Bitter category. This passes 21st Amendment Bitter American as my new favorite beer under 5 ABV. Extremely drinkable and crisp. If you enjoy a nice pale ale/bitter with English style hopping, you must seek this out. Highly highly recommended."
"O- Its been years since my last experience with Bitter Brewer, I had tried a can which was far past its use by date and it really put me off. A wonderful balance of flavors, light and crisp, perfect for summertime."
"Thanks again surly."
"O- What can I say Surly continues to produce delicious beers that are never a letdown, bitter brewer is a solid beer that is easy drinking, I will continue to drink this beer till it’s out of season."
"Very drinkable beer, can consume a few of theses no problem with the low Abv 4%"
"Oddly enough, I didn't care for this beer as much when I first tried it last July. Maybe my palette just needed some development, because now I think this one is fantastic."
"An excellent 'session' beer. Too bad its not available here in New Mexico."
"Great drinkability. Low ABV, as expected, and an overall enjoyable brew."
"Overall: Fantastic take on a style I don't usually enjoy. Maybe it is the American hops providing some great flavors the English varietals just can't deliver. Surly seems to not know how to a mediocre beer."
"Lighter medium body, slightly creamy, mild carbonation, overall extremely smooth and pleasant. Drinks exceptionally well, with plenty of hop bitterness tempered by slightly sweet malt profile. The nose was a little subdued, but everything else is right on point."
"D - Unbelievable. I tried this not because I like the style but because I love Surly. Man, it was worth it! Best Ding-worthy session ale ever!!"
"An easy drinker at both alcohol by volume and its light to medium body with tasty finish, this is a better bitter."
"Overall, a good beer but probably my least favorite from Surly."
"Highly drinkable. The low ABV makes this super easy to sip... Ding would be proud: I'm enjoying a session ale!"
"Cheers!"
"Honey colored that's more orange at the bottom and becomes more golden at the top. 1 finger sticky white head that leaves lot's of sticky lacing behind. Smells like a tropical fruit bowl. Lot's of flavor packed into this one. Tangerine, grapefruit, and other citrus flavors. Some sweet and pale malts to round it out. The mouthfeel feels light for the complexity and flavor profile of the beer but I think it's exactly what the brewer was shooting for. This is the best session beer I've had yet. The hop profile is perfect to drink a few with out having palate overkill. That with only a 4% abv makes this the ultimate session beer."
"D - It's semi-easy to drink, but should be easier at 4%."
"Ah, the Crack & Glug! A beautiful, thick, bubbly two fingers of ecru head sat bubbling, creating some beautiful lacing as it began to sit down. Nose was a mix of orange zest and grapefruit juice. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side but the taste was as advertised - toast and marmalade in the mouth. Finish was much more pronounced in terms of the marmalade and left a tingly feeling on my tongue. Sorry you are bitter, Todd, but this was suh-wheet! I am envisioning a whole cooler filled with Surly beers with me at the beach."
"O: I enjoyed this one noticeably more the second time I tried it. I can only assume that my palate changed, but I'll be sure to try this one again in the future."
"Scored these at Buckbean for only $1 a piece, proceeds to charity, these were the Surly beers that didn't make it from Canfest."
"On tap into 4oz tasting tulip...Poured a light, clear and watery copper with light head that doesn't last...The aroma and taste to me are super generic versions of an English ipa. Sugar and caramel come through mostly with watery metallic hops on the back. The feel is too watery. Surly mostly nails it, but to me this is a macro versions attempt at an esb."
"3.5/4/3.5/3.5/4"
"Thank you Shango42."
"On the palate is a lightly toasted malt flavor with a light bitterness. Fruity orange and a leafy, woodsy hop flavor come together for a deep hop profile. Mouthfeel is on the wet side with a suprisingly substantial body. Still, the overall character is nice and light, making me crave another session beer."
"A little bit of a bright floral, earthy combo of hops is noticed right off the bat. Really on point. Not too aggressive, but just assertive enough over the tastiness of the malt character with some dried apricot as well. The taste follows as well with an upper low level of bitterness. It is clear, but not overpowering, the great, classic toastiness of the malt is in the background and just has so much nuance. Somewhere between a slightly overcooked pie crust and a pancake. Just an excellent beer that makes a ton of flavor and subtlety for being only 4%. I will drink this any day."
"D - Pretty drinkable. As stated earlier it is way too carbonated for the style however. I really prefer smoother bitters. The flavor is pretty solid abit more floral hop bite than normal but pleasant. Certainly a beer worth trying."
"Not the most drinkable bitter because of the dryness, however there is no alcohol to speak of and the flavor component is refreshing. I like the hop kick near the end which is showing a bit of American flare to the style. Overall, a winner that everyone should give a whirl."
"Poured this into a pint glass. The color is a nice light amber with a bubbly white head about an inch thick. The aroma is wonderful on this. Floral hops with orange sweetness and bit of oak. Slightly bitter with a solid malt profile. The taste is dry and absolutely bitter. Bitter grassy hops with light malts. I'm into this one. Already lamenting that I only have one can left. The mouthfeel is light and subtly carbonated, nothing offensive here. And at four percent, a tailor made session beer that's easy to kick back and enjoy."
"Amber color with a thick frothy head about 2 or 3 cm thick that clings all over the glass after pouring. The beer has american hops and british malt. The nose is gently hoppy. It seems that the hops in the nose is imparted by the flavoring hops and that there wasn't much done with aromatics. Gentle flavor of hops and malt working together. The body of the beer is mostly a malty read and there seems to be some orange zest or lemon peel or both. Light body and finishes very clean. The mouthfeel is pretty ordinary as there is nothing about it that I can even make note of. It just slides down your throat. The hops seems to almost get lost until the finish and aftertaste. The brewery itself describes the beer as ""marmalade"" flavor, so I guess I am on it with the orange."
"The English malts shine through on the flavor with a perfectly-restrained sweetness that suggests toffee, dates, and mineral water. Yeast adds notes of tobacco and shoe polish, with a healthily bitter floral kick on the finish from fresh-tasting hop cones. Mouthfeel is aggressive, as Surly beers tend to be, but not overly so. Big bubbles from the CO2 roll across the palate to make the body feel even thinner than the style dictates. Still, Bitter Brewer is an excellent take on an obscure style. Wish I could come across more English Bitters like this in the states..."
"MF/D: an initial buzz of carbonation that dissipates as quickly as it hits the tongue for a smooth swallow. excellent session beer."
"We need more beers like this. Session beers, that are moderate in alcohol, packed with flavor and keep you grabbin' for more. Get bitter!"
"D: Sure it was an exhausting day and all, but, good lord, this disappeared quickly! I'll give BB credit for slaking a *killer* thirst, but moreso for having a perfectly palate-pleasing blend of malt and hops and an oh-so-sessionable weight. Bitter? Only that I don't have any more to enjoy..."
"Drinkability is fine; I think this does a pretty good job of getting across the bitterness of Todd the brewer as described on the can. Very curt & brazen bitterness, especially considering the abv."
"Quite simply, If I this beer was available in my area it would be my go to. I would literally always have a case in my fridge."
"sampled at Stub & Herbs, Minneapolis"
"Poured this beer from the can into a glass and was a liked the light color of the beer. I didn't like the smell and maybe next time I'll just keep it in the can. It smelled like citrus but not hop citrus, but as if there were some additions other than hops to aid in the citrus-ness. I was also a little put off by the body. I know this is a light beer but it feel really dry to me. Overall this is not something that I would seek out"
"For the style this a good overall beer."
"D- Very nice sessionable beer, low on the ABV, great drinkable beer."
"The feel of this brew is a bit light and watery and modestly carbonated. Well balanced overall, it lends itself to being quite sessionable and not only is it easy to drink down the 16oz but I would have another if available."
"Overall a perfectly crafted session beer that suites me to a 'T'. I know the traditional English Bitter doesn't have as much of a hops presence, but this still stays remarkably balanced even thought the malt and hops are amped up compared to a British version. This is a respectable nod of the hat towards Britain while still keeping the independent spirit of American ingenuity alive and kickin'! Love this ale! Thanks maximum12 for this bonus in our trade in Madison, WI last weekend!"
"D - Bitter Brewer for the win! ...in drinkability. I could pound this down, especially in the summer, but I wouldn't particularly care to. It goes down smooth and easy but it's just bland and bitter."
"Bitters are slowly becomeing my new goto beers. They are excellent after dinner, refreshing after cutting the grass and hell fantastic in the shower."
"D: Could drink all day. One of the better bitters I have had. Goes down so easy. Very crisp and refreshing."
"Serving type- Can pour into a nonic Eglish pint glass"
"D: A very light and delicious beer. Beers like these are my ""light"" beer equivalents to BMCs. A very delicious and sessionable beer."
"Thanks Shango42!"
"(D)- A unique and interesting beer that certainly fits the style and name. Dry and bitter. Not exactly my most favorite from Surly though."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable at 4%. I really need to drink some more English bitters, as they are an underrated style. Very easy drinker, not offensive at all. Great beer."
"Cheers!"
"I have yet to taste an unpleasant beer from Surly."
"Poured from a 16oz. can into a Sam Adams perfect pint on a 90 degree hot and humid day. Pours a light copper with medium carbonation and has an off white soapy head. A nice nose of lightly hopped citrus aromas with some light malt and fruit. Taste starts out with lots of toast and light caramal then finishes with some lighter fresh fruits and a kiss of hops. This has a nice soft texture with a little creaminess to it but also has a nice crisp finish. This is the definition of a session beer."
"D: another low alcohol masterpiece from Surly. I have gotten to the point where I am confident that any Surly product I try will impress me regardless of style"
"D: Incredibly drinkable; one of the most sessionable, every day beers I have ever had"
"D- Every sip makes me want to take another. Very nice flavor and good mouthfeel makes this another winner from Surly. Not bitter from the end result."
"O: Again, surprised I haven't review this yet seeing as I've been enjoying it the last two summers but I suppose it's appropriate because this summer I've been drinking more than ever. Love this beer. Love Surly."
"I had 3 more of these, and I totally appreciate this brew so much more, just fantastic."
"D- Easy to drink this beer, just finished the can after throwing the baseball around and it was refreshing as well, I just like my beers to have a little more body, but not bad. This beer slightly reminds me of The Bruery's Humulus XPA for some reason, I don't know just light beers."
"A perfect cold lighter beer for the summer."
"I've had BB recently in a can and it was much better overall. I'm wondering if the barrel was just older."
"Overall this is the definition of drinkable. Just enough flavor and body to make it substantial. With the low ABV I could drink this all night and not get drunk."
"Beer has a medium body and is a little nutty and only mildly bitter. I get that bitters should be around 35 - 45 IBUs, this nails that. It gets better the more I drink it. There is some graininess on the palate. It is pretty good. I enjoyed it and drank a couple."
"Somewhat hazy, dark-gold to coppor. Decent white head and some sticky lace. Scent has a lot of sweet malts, fair amount of fruit tones. Some floral hops. I guess the first word that hits my mind when i taste it is ""english," which makes some sense i guess. Although bitters arent a style im overly familiar with, this reminds me of some other beers brewed in england that i've come across. Biscuit malts, touch of bitter hops. More floral elements arise as the beer continues to be consumed. Fairly wet mouth. I dunno, not bad. Certainly a good session beer"
"Drinkability this is full of hop flavor and 4% crisp refreshing now this is what beer should be for the masses, looks like I should be in England..."
"Drinkability -- Quite refreshing, true to style, but a little ho-hum. Not my favorite Surly offering, but I'm certainly glad I got to try it."
"M/D: A little on the thin side, pretty smooth over the palate, lower carbonation. Very easy drinking, not to flavorful since its only 4%abv. A great ""light"" beer for the summer. Mellow, easy drinking flavors makes this very sessionable."
"pours an amber copper color with a beige head and ring some nice lacing on side of glass..smell is crisp malts first then some hops with citrus and some toffee ..the taste is malts and some mild bitterness as it warms... some hop and citrus mixed in as well with some bread and toffee..the mouthfeel is thin but with flavor..what impressed me most about this brew was the flavor it packed @ 4.5% ABV,,wow it was damn good ..crisp and refreshing..i want another one...recommended of course"
"Important note: You will really sell this beer short if you drink it ice cold. I usually take a can out of the fridge a half hour before I want to have one, then take the next one when I'm opening the first."
"Drinkability: A very low ABV and almost no taste of it makes it wonderful for a long beer session. Great flavors are still present even with such a low ABV."
"D - This is very good. Light enough for hot weather sessions and flavorful enough with some unique flavor components that really work. I wouldn't call this a traditional English bitter, but it is an excellent American interpretation. Would love to get more of this."
"Somewhat hard to review this beer instead of just keep drinking it."
"Bitter Brewer is a fantastic beer I highly endorse. I think my macro loving friends would like this beer and it's a also great example of a style too few breweries attempt...maybe because it's hard to make one with the character and uniqueness Surly has done."
"Very good drinkability. Quite refreshing on a hot summer night, and the relatively low ABV helps."
"Would I buy more of it? - yep, one more that I'd love to have on a camping trip or at a Saturday afternoon BBQ."
"D: This is a fairly new style to me, but one that I'm enjoying more and more. I really like the subtle flavors and mildness of it which make this beer a really easy drinker."
"A three finger head is easily achieved with a vigorous pour. It quickly turns rocky with off white bubbles that leave scattered lace as they slowly fade. Body is a rich honey amber in tone. Nose is immediately noticeable with fragrant and rustic hops that are very vibrant. As you continue to smell you get a floral citrus character also along with sappy sweet pine notes. With first sip you get a slight piney hop bite but it quickly yields to a thin almost watery body. Super easy to drink as it is so smooth. This kind of reminds me of a hoppy pilsner. A little on the light side though. Mouthfeel is a soft bitter hue that really hangs on the tongue. As I said, this beer is very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to someone who seeks a citrus/grassy hop/bitter brew that has a clean and light body. Very enjoyable."
"All in all, not being a super hop guy, this brew did not do much for me. Too much of that grapefruit / grassy flavor. If you like it dry and hoppy, this is definitely a brew to try. If you like malts and sweets, then avoid this beer."
"Pours a slightly murky yellow with a white head. The aroma is wet grass with some oranges, but overall it is a little faint. The flavor is pineapple, orange and some grassyness. The beer is slightly bitter. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, a lot of flavor is a 4 percent ABV package."
"I could drink a ton of this, and 16oz just isnt enough. So refreshing and really nice overall."
"D: I'm not a great big fan of this type of taste but I can and do appreciate it. Very different from anything else I've had in a surprising and pleasant way. Not terribly complex but very unique and the Surly body makes this infinitely more drinkable."
"Part of my Secret Santa 2009 haul from Scoobydank. A 16oz. can poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Bitter Brewer appears a clear pale amber color with about two finger of off white foam. The head leaves a nice lace in it's wake. Nose and flavors consist of caramel, beautifully toasted malts, apricot, orange marmalade, mildly dank grassy notes, a bit floral. Certainly bitter, yet dry and clean. Decent carbonation with a medium body, really nice body actually, for a 4% ale. Very nice stuff here. I'd love too try this on cask someday."
"D - This is another example of a well done beer by Surly, I wish these guys would bring their beer to Louisiana, they are some of the best"
"D - I love this beer. It's one that has a low enough ABV to make it sessionable, yet the taste is bigger than most session brews. The only bad part is the fact that Surly doesn't distribute to WI...looks like I'll have to rely on my MN pipeline to keep getting my Surly fix! YUM!"
"Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, nothing overpowering that I would get tired of. Very good tasting and drinkable beer."
"The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and this is a beer that would be way better on a hot day than a cold December night. I hope to revisit this (maybe 8-12 times) at the beach in July."
"D - Another good brew from Surly, bitter's is not one of my favorite styles but this one was a good eye opener. I could have another and I will, but not a brew that I could enjoy all night long. I good brew to share with others to introduce them to the style."
"low ABV and great flavor make this very sessionable. something i could drink whenever. i bet this is even better when fresh."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer which I was glad I got the chance to try. Now I am going to have to go and try to get some more of it! Great job Surly!!!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light and nearing creamy. The carbonation is low but works well with the beer. I could throw this beer back all night and never become bored. English Bitter isnt really my favorite style of beer; however, if this came to Cincinnati this would almost always be in my beer fridge rotation."
"Another beer that, for me, brings nothing to the party. Sure it's very drinkable, but so is water. I want my beers to have character, for my tastes, this one does not."
"Drinkability: A very tasty brew indeed, and pretty true to the style. I guess when it comes to bitterness I like the hops to eat the enamel off my teeth. Still, this is a refreshing brew and I'm glad I got to try it."
"Final thoughts: This is a very easy drinking and delicious beer. It's got a great malt quality and hop taste as well as some bitterness that all blend together well. It reminds me very much of a British style IPA but American hops instead, which makes sense since it is American hops with British malts. Has a lot of fresh brewing tastes, the aromas, the malt taste, the hop taste, all of it reminds me of brewing. All of that, plus it comes in a tall boy can. Wow, I so wish I could get more Surly!"
"D: Quite drinkable, as is the tradition of the style. Not my favorite of Surly's, but a solid attempt at this style."
"This is tasty stuff and a super easy drinker. I'd love to have this on cask. Good stuff."
"Served on-tap in a pint glass at Stub & Herbs in Minneapolis, MN. Has a bright amber body with a thin white head. Toasted malts dominate the aroma with hops coming in a distant second. Medium bodied with a spicy carb bite, this beer has woody hop flavors up front followed by malt sweetness, then a fairly long hop finish. Drinkability was okay, but half way through I was looking forward to a differnt beer. This is the first Surly offering that I didn't fall immediately in love with."
"D: I wish i could have this beer as my go to. I could drink this every night. It is very easy to drink and really goes to show that a beer doesn't need to be a huge abv for it to be flavorful. This may be the best session beer I have ever had."
"Pours a deep orange with a one finger white lace. There is good cling to the glass and there is some small carbonation activity present afther the pour. I am not getting a strong smell presence from this beer. I get a weak alcohol smell but that is all. The taste follows closely with the smell as well. There is a smooth start to the beer that then finishes a little bitter. The bitterness is nothing strong or overpowering but it is present. I received this beer as an extra from Jeff. It is a decent beer and a good offering from Surly. I have been happy with everything that I have had from Surly but this is a beer that I would probably not have again."
"I would seek this one out, if it werent for the ridiculous local-ness of this beer."
"A nice orange golden color with no head and very little lacing. Smells a bit hoppy and a touch of earthiness. Taste is nice smooth hop with a big bit. A perfect copy of a traditional english bitter. Very nice offering from Surly."
"Gold color with maybe a touch of dark orange to it, just to take enough awawy from a straw color. Smell is crisp and hoppy with a touch of bitter bite. A great English bitter! Very mild and biting with a nice blast of bitterness to shake things up. Dead on for the style in the mouthfeel as well. Highly drinkable, and another winner from Surly."
"This is an interesting interpretation from Surly. Definitely hopped for the North American palate, and I think better for it."
"Thanks Bobsy!"
"I wish more breweries would make beers like this instead of taking it to the other extreme of alcohol and hops. One session beer in the lineup isn't too much to ask, is it?"
"I could enjoy this brew anytime."
"D- Quite drinkable. This could be a good session beer. It is a solid entry from Surly, but not the apex of their greatness."
"Not the most flavorful but very sessionable, a great example of the style."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange tea color with a BIG foamy light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good amount of lacing behind. The smell is sweet malt, roasted grainy with equal part citrus hop. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is light and tangy. Full flavored, I really appreciate the association with 'intense toast and marmalade'. The grainy biscuit character lingers nicely. At 4.0% ABV this is one crazy drinker...one of the best I've ever had of this style. Many thanks to maximum12 for this opportunity!"
"Had this again a few weeks later and had the same impression."
"Bitter, yes. English, not really. Drinkable? For sure, but the bitterness lasts long enough that one pint of this seems plenty. Yet another Surly beer that tastes 10 times bigger than its modest ABV, although with this one there are more than enough clues that it is indeed a mere four-percent. Wish this stuff was available in all 50 states, but that's silly Utopian longing, isn't it?"
"D--Not much here to enjoy once it hits the palate (other than some tasty burps). There is nothing offensive about this at all, but the burps should not be better than the beer. Very average brew."
"Drinkability - awesome session beer. Great flavor. Thanks to crazynelson for tossing one of these my way at DLD."
"Drinkability is very good. It's just a hair sharp on the hops to get a full 5, but it's damn close. One of my favorites from Surly so far."
"Light in body with a lively carbonation. Drinkability is great. The perfect summer brew and the perfect brew to enjoy during a brewery tour in 95 degree weather. Cheers!"
"D: Hiigh. This is the stuff that summer brews are made of. Well done."
"mouth is smooth and easy going. calling this thing an easy drink would be the understatement of the month. a fantastic session ale. wow. well done surly. not just if you would start selling your beer in so cal..."
"I'm having a tough time with this beer. In one way I am saying a big ""eh"" to it due to that almost solvent like taste. At the same time, I'm not sure it wasn't intended around a massive hop backbone without bitterness. I have several more of these, so we'll see if things change."
"D: Incredible"
"D- Very drinkable, could drink it all day! its crisp and refreshing and of course, full of flavors i enjoy!"
"Surly makes some great stuff, and I dig anything in cans. Like the other brews I have tasted from them, this one is tasty and very drinkable; nice beer."
"Drinkability - Not usually my favorite style, but not bad either. My least favorite Surly so far."
"The drinkability is exceptional. I drank mine in a mere few minutes and would love another; if only the brewery wasn't 1400 miles away. Oh well that's why there's trading."
"Overall, I am really digging this beer. It seems to be just right for me at this point in time. Easy drinking. Tasty. Not to filling. I will be drinking more of this."
"D- Could probably drink quite a few of these but would rather go with something else like Bender or Furious."
"although i have been told that the beer is rather inconsistent. i may have lucked out but it was really worth it."
"Notes: Thanks to mnjeff for the trade!"
"Surly's rep precedes itself, so if I'm slightly disappointed it's for that reason alone. But as an American example of an English Bitter, it's well done and very drinkable. Recommended."
"D= A pretty drinkable and surely sessionable ale here, I just wish that odd tropical cereal flavor was not present. Would gladly drink it again though if one was offered to me."
"Drinkability - A nice drinkable beer, gets a bit sweeter as it warms. Finishes dry."
"Overall, search this one out for a nice session ale."
"D: A session beer. I would order another and definitely buy a four pack. Glad I stuck with this one! It got better as I drank it and peaked just before I finished it."
"My first of this style is a pleasant one!"
"D :: Very drinkable. After so many high ABV beers, this was quite refreshing. Great flavor, well balanced and very enjoyable."
"Surly Bitter Brewer pours a thin disk of foam over an orange brew. Carbonation is steady and the nose is fresh pine hop aroma. The flavor is light toasty English malts with apricot notes and grapefruit rind hop bitterness off the back. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with that grapefruit rind persisting in the aftertaste. At 4% alcohol by volume, it nods to the great English tradition of brewing light, yet flavorful ales yet in this case with a healthy addition of American hops. Very interesting and flavorful!"
"Overall I would say this is a very good beer, though it is pretty subtle in aroma and flavor it still has nice complexity and balance."
"Comment I think this is a really great beer and if it was sold here I'd be getting a lot of it."
"Drinkability: i enjoyed this beer. and at 4%, i can enjoy that much more of it."
"16oz. can courtesy of PhiDelt. Served in a standard pint glass; no freshness dating indicated. Poured a hazy, pale copper-orange with a half inch, off-white head that sizzled and popped as it slowly receded into a broken froth revealing textured clumps of foam during the session. Nose is sweet orange marmalade and a bit biscuity. Taste reveals cereal grains and some mild, bittering hops that linger between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light bodied and very lively, with a little prickliness on the roof of the mouth. Not my favorite Surly offering, but very drinkable and a nice option for a lawnmower beer."
"D- Outstanding warm weather beer. Nice balance, easy drinking and refreshing!"
"Finally get a chance to try a variety of Surly brews, thanks to sonicdecent. Had a few flavors, and this one is my favorite so far. Brass orange with a nice thick looking head, slowly dies down as I drink. So much aroma - American hops, pale malt, hay, and some complex soapy almost laundry detergent smell. Yeah, in a good way. I'd love to find out what a traditional English brewer would have to say about this beer.Tastes like some of the best, quintessential English bitters, with distinctly American hopping. Nice mellow malt up front with an interesting hop profile to say the least. It seems like all the hops are in the nose, but there's a nice dry finish to it. Spicy, with very light citrus notes and hardly any bitterness, yet juicy. Super smooth and crips on the palate. So refreshing and uber quaffable. Damn near just exactly perfect."
"Drinkability- Damn good. Nice to actually find a beer with big flavor that has such a low ABV. It has a way more orange/tangerine flavor than a traditional English Bitter but that's what makes it so great. Very good brew that I enjoyed tremendously."
"Another solid beer from Surly. I love these guys."
"D- This is an incredible session beer. If it was available around here I would make it my go to. I didn't know a beer under 5 percent alcohol could have this kind of hop profile without being incredibly bitter."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall: Mouthfeel is very light and well carbonated. Drinkability is amazing, as is should be. I could easily drink a couple four-packs. Perfect for summer! well done Surly!"
"D-Pretty damn decent drinkability. Not amazing, but enjoyably different in its British characteristics. The 4-pack I grabbed before my friends came over was gone before long."
"D- Very drinkable being 4% a couple of these 16oz. cans won't knock you over."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink and at 4% abv, it is an ideal session beer."
"Overall: Very drinkable! Very refreshing and delicious! Keeps you wanting more. None of the flavors are overwhelming, nice subtle spiciness as it warms up. Delicious beer!"
"Nice."
"D= extremely high. The most sessionable beer in the world I think. Never tasted anything so great with such a low abv. Truely a masterpiece."
"Big thanks goes out to Todd for sending me home with a can of this stuff. Poured this beer in to an English pint glass. Color was a hazy dark orange, with a large, frothy white head. Floral hops kick off the nose, followed by some biscuit, bread crust, and some dry grain. Taste is very similar to the smell, all of the above mentioned smells were also present in flavor, with the floral hops asserting themselves more. Definitely seems to be a medium sized beer in body. Drinkability is really something. The low alcohol content along with the high level of complexity make it an excellent session brew. Surly has not disappointed with any of their beers so far. I especially love the style; It is one that I rarely get a chance to try, so I am very happy that I had the opportunity. Now my only problem is that this glass is becoming empty far too quickly. Get Surly."
"D: Goddamn this beer is drinkable, if it wasn't so difficult to get this would be my go to session beer. There's just not enough Bitters out there and the majority of them are past their prime, Surly comes through again proving that, for some beer, cans are the perfect medium"
"Drinkability: An entirely inoffensive and sessionable brew. It's not the most flavorful or aromatic beer out there, but hey, it's not supposed to be, is it? I could see bringing a four-pack of these along on a camping trip (though I suppose I could see doing the same w/ a four-pack of Ten FIDY ...). A tasty beverage."
"Drinkability is sky high. This is a tasty beer, super sessionable, and would be a staple in my fridge if this was available locally."
"Not my favorite Surly, but a solid brew and a nice change of pace."
"M + D: Goes down fairly easily, with a rather assertive carbonation. Light enough to swig it back, but lacking in some flavour/aroma."
"Goldish copper color with a white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of tangerine, apricots, and some perfume notes. Taste is immediately of apricots, followed by some sort of sweet candy that I'm not sure of the name of, followed by some tangerine in the finish. Light bodied and on the lower side of medium carbonation."
"M/D - very drinkable, nice carbonation and nothing too overwhelming, just a nice tasting beer from a great company."
"Average copper color. Heavy handed hops in the aroma-very grassy and grapefruity. Pleasantly malty-more hops then I expected but thats just me. Nice bitterness to it. Body is ok but a tad thin. Overall a lot of flavor in a low abv. Because of the thinness in the body I might tone the hops back a bit. Just a thought-still a damn good beer."
"Really easy to drink and an extremely well balanced English Bitter."
"Bitter despite the firm, smooth malty backbone. More bitter in the American style than the traditional English. Certainly an American take on the style, with English malts but plenty of American hops. Light enough to be very drinkable/""sessionable"" but big on aroma and flavor. This is surely one that is worthy of a bitter ""session"" brew!"
"Poured a 16oz can into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a slightly hazy orangish amber with a nice 3 inch head that left thin lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell is straightforward west coast hops. It actually really surprises me that the hop aroma is so prevalent. The flavor is a bit disappointing. Up front, as it says on the can, is an orange preserves flavor, with orange peel and sugar coming through but after that the flavor just diminishes into a watery tea. The flavor really reminds me of a cold, orange citrus tea. The mouthfeel is very thin, but not really light, like a good pilsner would be. I think this beer is very good at what it's trying to be. It's a very (it says 4% on the can) sessionable ale. I could really drink this stuff all day."
"Overall, a rather interesting beer. The aroma leads you in one direction and the taste in another with both of them good. Recommend. Another great one from Surly."
"HV"
"Thanks to a buddy of mine for bringing this back from MN this summer. My first sample of this was at the Whitefish Bay fireworks on the 4th of July and it was delicious (even out of the can). This pours, just as the can states, a pale orange color with a nice rocky, airy head of foam that dissipates to subtle lacing and white film. The aroma is filled full of peppery, earthy hops. Heavy resinous notes get me salivating for a taste. A soft biscuit-like smell balances the hops quite well. The taste is full of hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Nothing overpowering at all and the body, although full of flavor, is soft and light. This makes this beer remarkably easy to drink and makes me want more and more with each taste. This may be my favorite from Surly that I have had the pleasure to try. One of the top session beers in my opinion."
"Surly brewery does full flavored beers, not watered down bitter beer face. I like this place."
"D - This one goes down very easy and has a nice herbal hop kick."
"Glad to have tried it but not impressed at all. In fact not impressed with any of the Surly brews I've tried yet. Wondering if surly's just a victim of the hype train."
"This is a nice English Bitter. Surly did a good a job with it. This style (by my standards) is dominated by a wealth of mediocre beers. This is a good one that's perfect for a session. Too bad I can't easily get more. Damn limited distribution."
"Poured into my Surly glass a very nice cloudy golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing and small islands. The nose is malty, hoppy, bitter, with some citrus notes. The taste is malty, with some very nice hop notes, bitter, citrus notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very nice brew."
"Easy drinkin bitter. Less filling, tastes great."
"The mouthfeel is just a tad thin, but still very solid. Good carbonation keeps it exciting. Low abv + lots of flavor = excellent session beer. Thanks, Daniel, for the opportunity!"
"D: An exceptionally light body, modest IBU (37), low ABV, and interesting flavor profile make Bitter Brewer highly sessionable. Recommended if you're looking for a lighter beer with plenty of character."
"Thanks, tempest, for the opportunity"
"16oz can, what a solid brew out of a can. My 1st go at any of the Surly beers and it did not disapoint. Some metalic ""can"" flavor hidden in the finish of the brew maybe? Or was I just saying that as I stair at the can? Poured into tulip glass. Some sour / bitter flavors, intense and with terrific mouth feel, almost like it was barrel aged. Cirtrus, hops, balanced flavor. Really enjoyed this, and the price and packaging!"
"This is just too easy to drink. The aroma is fantastic and I wish the flavor was a little more assertive, but this definitely needs to be on the warm side of 50°F / 10°C to be fully experienced properly. I would kill to have this on hand pulled cask for a pint or five in a row. This is a very good beer, that really would be at its best as a real ale; I would love to have that, but I know that is never going to happen. Way before I want it to happen, this beer has disappeared from my glass."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, zesty, peppery."
"Thanks again Scoobydank for this great beer."
"Pours a cloudy tangerine/iced tea colour. Moderate off white head. Nose- orange pekoe tea leaves, marmalade. Taste- sweet marmalade on whole wheat toast. Aspirin dryness on the finish. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. For sure the most flavourful 4.5% beer I've had the pleasure of trying."
"Pours a clear orange hue with a lively white head. No lace, good retention. Aroma is crisp apricots and slight bready malts. Flavour is again reminiscent of apricots and light bready malt. Bitterness is pronounced but not over the top. The finish is very dry. The body is very light and the carbonation seems quite high. Very thirst quenching and enjoyable. We need more beers like this around."
"Mouthfeel is a little light and low level of carbonation, but very smooth and slick. This is a tasty session beer if I ever had one."
"Cheers."
"D: Very drinkable -- light in heft and ABV but with some flavor, this one goes down easy."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is yet another really good beer from Surly. It's a very flavorful session beer with good substance."
"Bitter Brewer pours out of the can a nice hazy orange-yellow color with a solid two fingers of head with great lacing power. From the smell you can quickly tell you're in for a treat. Hints of honey with a nice balanced hop bite. I could try to describe the taste differently, but really this carries over flavor-wise as well. It makes for a perfectly refreshing and amazingly drinkable beer. I just wish this was more readily available to me. Great session beer."
"D: Tons of drinkability. Cans of these went down easy with some grilled squid and Indian curry. Thanks again buckeyenation."
"Mouthfeel was mild to medium in carbonation and body. Seems right on for the style."
"Overall this was not a bad one at all. Truly a session beer. Now as for the style to be honest I am not sure about that one. It was weird, like a hybrid light ale. Still though I would not turn this one down at all. A solid offering for sure and something a bit different."
"D. This is one drinkable beer. Its a shame I only have one sample, but am certainly glad I did. Thanks Oneeye!"
"M/D - Light bodied and very crisp. A very drinkable bitter with a much stronger hop profile than your average English brewed bitter."
"drinkability is good. liked the aroma, but the taste was not quite up to it. seems atypical for the style, but an interesting take on it. still, overall it was quite solid and tasty."
"Pours a hazed golden amber, some orange hues, thin white head forms, drops to a nice ring, drops tons of lace on the glass. Smell is nice, citrus, tea like hops, crystal malt, floral, light fruits, very fragrant. Taste is similar, citrus kick, some floral, tea, caramel, some bready malt, nice tangerine bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, super smooth. Great refreshing low ABV beer, I would love to drink this stuff all day. Thanks Scott!"
"The beer has a very pleasant taste, but I was a bit taken aback. When I grab a Surly, I expect an explosion of tastes and hops and so much going on that my tongue can barely wrap itself around it all. Not so with this beer. It goes down smooth, with just a tad of bitterness at the end, although not nearly as much as I was expecting. It's got a nice balance to it and is obviously drinkable at that ABV, but if I'll go with one of the other Surly options next time."
"Thanks Bobby for bringing with you on your visit. Pours mostly big creamy soap bubble white head, onto light yellow body.Some citrus and fresh grainy malt in aroma, remembering that this is one season later. Lots of lace layers and dots down my glass. A flavorful bitter, and the can lists but 4%. Satisfying this warm summer day, creamy mouthfeel, and drying finish."
"D- definitely an awesome beer, on cask this would probably get all 5's"
"Really easy to drink. Good flavor, not crazy great, but solidly good. I could seemingly put back a few of these without trouble."
"Decent drinkability."
"This is a very easy drinking brew great for the summertime. If I could get surly I would consume mass quantities of this stuff."
"I like Surly, and I am not disappointed with this beer. Just not the best I've had from them. Perhaps it's the style, but I prefer bitter beers to have a little more floral and/or citrus aroma from the hops. Tasty nonetheless."
"Bottom line: I really like this ""English Bitter"" though purists would probably say it's too bitter. I agree, basically, but it in no way impedes me from enjoying this brew. This is yet another winner from Surly!"
"If there's one thing Surly does well, it's creating full flavored beers and this is no exemption. Packed tight with flavors and easy sessionalbility, I could go at this all night."
"D: This beer is much easier to palate as it warms a bit."
"D - Quite different from Surly's other offerings. Very malty but still very Surly bitter. Enjoyable to drink. As with any of Surly's beers, this has nothing to do with style guidelines, but just enjoying the beer."
"Another winner from Surly."
"D: Completely sessionable. Very clean and refreshing with a low abv...let's drink!"
"This light golden-orange beer with a white head packs a punch of hops. Clearly bitter, and, like many of Surly brews, calling it a style is a bit of a misnomer. Anyone who really like the English Bitter listed above will be surprise by this one. For me the nose is a great invitation of twangy hops, but the taste is a bit too much. The bite is acrid, and tough, but not in a totally bad way. It's well brewed to be just that--but it's not fun for me to drink, and the malty base and body are too weak to match up to the hops, which linger ad infinitum and build uncomfortably over the course of the beer. With that said, I can see why those very things would be a postive for a lot of people."
"Pours a clear orange/amber color with 2 fingers of foamy eggshell head with nice retention and good lacing. Smells of pine, grass, honey, lightly toasted grain, and citrus fruit. Tastes of earthy hops, grassy hop pellets, toasted grain and biscuit, and a finish of dry pine. Medium to medium light in body with low carbonation. Somewhat watery and lacking in a lot of malt presence, but packing in the hops like they're actually grown in the can. Low in ABV and very sessionable for those who like a more bitter beer."
"Would order pints all day long, if I had them."
"a very tasty offering here. surly again impresses me with a twist on a style that sometimes isn't respected in america. recommended."
"Drinkability is high. Great flavors, low alcohol, feels good, very easy to consume. A nice session brew."
"D: Bitterness is held nicely in check. A good representative of style. Fairly refreshing brew. Decently complex, but not outstanding. I would certainly recommend this one."
"This beer was one of my favorites. A low ABV session brew, that has the hop intensity of beers twice as strong. The unique citrus aspect was interesting at first, but after one pint you just want more. I would especially love to try this on cask, as I can only imagine it being worthy of a long days session..."
"Toasted malts up front along with some toffee/biscuit flavor. Minty and citrusy hops follow soon after. Nice and bitter with developing into marmalade on toast. Hint of butter. Citrus and mild pine bitterness in a dry finish. Moderate body with nice, even carbonation. Would be really nice on cask methinks. Still a very good brew from the can! Keep up the great work Surly!"
"Drinkability: One of the best bitters I've ever had, and I would gladly make this a regular if I could get it regularly. Unfortunately I don't think I can."
"If hops and some astringency are your thing this beer is for you. I'm finding this to be pretty drinkable, but this may be too extreme of a small beer to be truely sessionable for myself. That said this is a very tasty small beer, and one that i wish i had more of so i could challenge myself to see just how sessionable it is. The burps come up as tingly pine... just thought i would throw that in there. Another ballsy beer from the ballsy brewery we know as Surly."
"drinkability: high"
"D: Just a tasty and drinkable brews. Nothing mind blowing but definitely another well above average brew from Surly. Though, the more that I drink of this, the more I like it."
"Thanks to dfried for the opportunity. Pours a light copper/orange color. Nice fluffy head that settles to a nice little layer. Proper amount of carbonation for the style. Small amounts of lacing that travels down the glass. Smells of light toasted malts with a light yet fair amount of earthy floral hops. Mouth feel is light and clean. Nice level of hops throughout the mouth. Citrus hops up front, that transitions to a more floral type. I touch of toasted malts comes in for the aftertaste. I really light and highly sessionable beer. Utterly fantastic."
"I had high hopes for this beer. While I've never cared much for it on tap, I hoped that the cask version would be better(take for example the Summit IPA, which is terrific on cask, but the cold version leaves me, well, cold). This beer(disapointingly) is just a warmer version of the cold Bitter Brewer. Served on cask, this pours a hazy amber color, with a frothy white head and ample lacing on the glass. The smell is malty with a hint of lemon. The lemon smell is an overwhelming flavor in the beer. It's hard to taste much else, although there is a bready malty flavor as well. The mouthfeel is rich(typical of Surly brews). There is just too much lemon flavor in this beer for me to appreciate it. This is a rare misfire for an otherwise terrific brewery."
"D - easy drinking and pretty tasty."
"You can drive home safely after a couple of these."
"on tap at Stub n' Herbs in Minneapolis. Pours straw-red with a shirt creamy head and long, sticky lacing. light, pale malt odor with a dry grainy orange hint. Extremely light orange taste at first, almost ephemeral. Bitterness rises quickly, and seems disembodied from the beer. Its not a hop bitterness, per se, its just bitterness, seemingly unrelated to the soft, light, otherwise easy drinking beer. The only trace of a floral hop is manifested in my after-burps. Light bodied, soft. An easy drinker, with good bitterness. nice."
"D : Really good and easy to drink. One I wouldn't mind having on a regular basis."
"D: This is definitely a drinkable brew despite the bitter connotations and taste. It tasted like a beer version of a nice iced tea on a summer afternoon."
"Drinks very easy, I could easily drink 3 or 4 before moving on. A good, not great take on the style. I put it up against most canned or bottled bitters I've had. Hops are a bit too dominant, but not perfection, but pretty good. Maybe if I had this on cask..."
"I had this on tap at the HopLeaf in Chicago, served in a goblet (odd choice, I expected a pint glass for a bitter). The beer was slightly hazy copper colored, almost no head. The aroma is toasted malts and a little bit of pungent hops. The taste is sharp with hops bitterness at the beginning of each sip, leaving a beautiful biscuity after-taste at the end. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, very easy to drink. Another winner from Surly in my opinion."
"Easy drinking, flavorful, interesting tastes. Yum. Great for the summer."
"Has a nice hoppy flavor but not much of a malt backbone compared to most Bitters. Has a low ABV and the lighter body makes consumption extremely easy."
"Another solid offering from Surly, have not had many beers of this style but this was good and I could drink it often, too bad this is a one time release, wish I had more of this stuff, my can said 4% ABV instead of 4.5 not that it matters that much, would like to drink again soon, recommended"
"I love a good bitter and this is, well, a good bitter - on the hop assertive end of the spectrum, but no less drinkable for it. I do find it slightly overcarbonated, but that's hardly going to stop me from knocking back a few for a session. Thanks owed to mully for the opportunity to do so. Would love to have this on cask - which would probably bump up the score here."
"Great mouthfeel, I could drink this all day."
"Thanks a bunch to pitmonkey for trading this to me!!"
"Another tasty beer from Surly. Keep 'em commin', boys!"
"Pick it up and drink it."
"Thanks to scoobydank for the can!"
"Pours a light caramel copper in color, slight haze, a decent sized off white, creamy head slowly recedes to a ring. Aroma is grassy, lemon citrus and just a bit of honey sweetness. Some graininess in the aroma as well. Taste follows with a good sized grassy bitterness coming on strong and lasting fairly long in the taste, blending well with the light maltiness. Bready grains and a hint of lemon and citrus in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light, hops are peppery and crisp and leave just a hint of dryness on the tongue. Very refreshing beer for some yard work today. Thanks to Eben and Travis for the sample."
"Other than an aroma that failed to meet me halfway (despite being dry-hopped), Bitter Brewer in the can is pretty close to the beer that I enjoyed from the tap last Fourth of July. Too bad it isn't in the same league as Furious, Bender and CynicAle. Then again, there are but a handful of breweries that can bring a trio like that to the table."
"D: Very drinkable - I know when I'm drinking my next three - hot summer day, come here and fast!"
"D- very drinkable and refreshing, great beer"
"Dark, golden color, but with a little opacity to it. The head is a clean, off-white color that tops it off nicely. Lots of earthy notes in the nose, bits of citrus hops running in and out. There is a yeastiness to the aroma as well. Flavor is surprisingly complex. Lots of hop character, but not as dominating as you'd think. There is a lot of malty sweetness going on, caramel and vanilla with a lemon zest finish. I'd like to see more people drinking this beer. It's very accessible and maintains a depth that lots of session-style beers lack."
"Drinkability is exceptional with this beer. I don't know how my glass empties so fast. This is not a chugging beer, but one that you find yourself constantly going for another mouthfull to let it wander the tongue. Try some, but not too much, I want to stock up!"
"Pours a somewhat hazy copper hue with a fluffy two finger off-white head that sticks around for a long ass time. Minimal lacing is left behind on the sides of the glass. Smell is sweet caramal malt, rye bread, and a touch of clementine and grapefruit. A light floral aroma and some nuttiness tickles the nose as well. Very pleasant beer to sniff. Taste begins with a quick but strong bitter burst followed by lemon flavored tea and caramel glazed peanuts. Dry midway with a brown sugar sweetness and pink grapefruit. Aftertaste is floral with a bit of earthy hops and molasses. Light to medium body with a fairly creamy feel. Carbonation stings the mouth with a puckering effect. This is definitely a session beer and a damn good one at that. If I could get this on a regular basis as well as ST Hop Sun, one of each would be in the fridge all year round. Luckily I have three cans left, I'm putting the next can in the fridge NOW."
"Note: Have had many of these on-tap and find its much more fruity and creamier with an unholy yummy drinkability thats killer good. I may need to review that at some point if I can ever remember to."
"D: Another great beer by Surly. Delightfully bitter yet with enough taste to keep you coming back. Had no trouble at all taking down this beer."
"This beer pours a clear burnt orange color. The head is on inch in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch cap of lacing. The aroma is very floral with pine and hints of citrus. It smells like good gin. The taste is of pine, with lots of floral notes, and a lingering dry bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation and a velvety texture. Overall, this is quite a refreshing beer. I could easily drink this all afternoon."
"Overall: I like Surly, I like hops, and I like beer (good beer that is) in a can. This is a winner. I am glad ObjectiveMonkey is sending me 4 cans in our trade. Yum....Let summer begin."
"D- Overall, this is a good transition beer for those into the craft brew world, and even those who aren't. A great beer for a warm afternoon."
"This is a delicious balanced bitter...hops quite restrained, malt crisp and dry. They have nailed the style. Low alcohol. perfect session beer, one that you will not tire of, fantastic with food. It's now in cans. Another great effort by these surly guys."
"Thanks to Zealot for this beer! Decanted from the can into a pint glass. Pours a golden color, with a two finger head that dissipates to a thin layer of foam. Aroma of citrus, a little malt, and fruit in general. Very pleasant smelling. Taste starts with a little fruit, then switches to a breadiness, and finally resiny hops. A little on the thin side and quite carbonated. Zealot mentioned this was an easy drinker, and he wasn't fucking around. This is one of the more drinkable beers I've had period. Damn. It's extremely hot in San Diego today and this is a perfect beer for the weather."
"D- Overall, this release is very approachable, especially for those who love hops. It's low alcohol by volume makes it a beer that can be enjoyed in sessions. Definitely another job well done by the guys at Surly!"
"Notes: This is one hell of a good bitter and yet another stellar brew from Surly. These guys are on a roll it seems."
"Orange gold with a big white head of large bubbled foam. Aroma is crazy for an English or American bitter Citrus and floral but with a different mix of aromas one would normally find in a bitter. Crazy citrus with kaffir lime peel, pomegranate, and tea in the mix. A bit of grapefruit, marigolds, biscuit malt, and more. Taste is more subdued yet complex fruit sweet citrus and tea with a nice biscuit malt background and a hoppy-sweet finish. Mouthfeel is light and medium bodied which is perfect for a bitter, and drinkability is great. A really solid and unique take on the style. Awesome"
"Tarnished copper. Thin light tan head. Retention and lace are quite good. Hoppy aroma. Similar to the Surlyfest, though I'm told it's not the same hop. Very scenty with citrus notes but also some very light doses of onion and garlic on the nose. Nice flavor of toasted malt and floral hoppiness. A little bit of a bitterness lingers on. Lightly carbonated and light-medium bodied."
"overal, this isnt bender or furious but susrly has brewed a very nice, very sessionable beer with a lot of flavor"
"Definitely a session beer that has a low ABV and may be better on a hot summer day. Overall, I prefer beers with at least one quality that is memorable. This beer doesn't do it for me. I look forward to Suryly's Cynic Ale which I think is one of their better (if under appreciated) beers. While this isn't a beer I plan on drinking much of, I do think it is a nice, easy drinking local brew that will appeal to some beer drinkers who are turned off by some of the bolder brews from Surly."
"Surly has another winner here. Not very complex, but it's amazing the flavor they can get out of such a low abv beer. I could drink this all day."
"Stellar is one word to describe this beer. I'm a sap for good English beers. This definitely isn't English, but it is a good Americanized version of the English Bitter. An obvious session beer. I wish Surly would release this year round. It is a great beer to have around when you finish a long day at work, mow the lawn on a hot day, or are just feeling like having a good, drinkable brew. If only I could find this on cask somewhere..."
"Bender is better for a session beer, but that's just my opinion. Pick this one up if you see it."
"I am glad this beer has a low abv, other wise it would get me in some serious trouble... As it stands, it's great."
"This is a really good beer. I've already traded six of the eight I picked up, so I'll be out to grab at least another four-pack (or two, or three) soon."
"All around, a very drinkable beer and perfect for the coming summer months. Not really something you'd want to drink in a Minnesota December, but a great picnic and BBQ beer."
"esb on cask served at dld. an earthy light amber in color with just a hint of white lacing and no head due to being from the cask. slightly hazy. nice aromas of toffee and caramel with some nice piney hops. well-balanced, this tastes bigger than it's abv would suggest. a bit of bready malt sweetness and smooth yet noticeable hop bitterness. struck me as being incredibly fresh. creamy mouthfeel, very light carbonation here. this would be an excellent session beer."
"Poured from growler into my new Surly pint glass and shared with a couple friends. Pours a nice amber color with thin white head. Smell is of wonderful piney, grassy, and spruce hops. Really clean smell. Tastes different than I would expect from the smell- clean & dry, yet extremely smooth. I get a nice sweet caramel type malt flavor that has a nice touch of slightly tangy hops to finish it off. No lingering aftertaste. Extremely drinkable! Love this beer- would be one of my perfect session beers."
"Beautifully balanced, tad out of style, but its Surly. What did you expect? I was bummed to arrive in Minneapolis only to find out the beer hasn't been canned yet. So finding it on tap made my day."
"I should also mention that this brewery is local to me and Surly Furious, to me, is the nectar of the gods. My opinion may be biased. Enjoy!!"
"Overall - This was a very very enjoyable beer from Surly. It was distinct and stood apart from their other beers. I look forward to trying this beer once again next summer."
"I had this beer at a beer tasting at Uproots Cafe in Uptown. This beer is nice and smooth, was a cloudy yellowish tan, smelled of a nice citrus. The beer had a nice bitter taste with some citrus aftertones in the flavor. The beer reminded me of summit extra pale but with something else added. I would love it if the canned this beer for a seasonal availability."
"I tried only one, but imagine this would be a great session beer."
"I want more."
"A highly enjoyable summer beer for the hop lover. I would/could drink a bunch of this on a hot day. Reminds me just a bit of Gumballhead - great flavor, light body and low ABV."
"Nice light orange color. Nose gave me an aroma of bready malt and hops with a touch of pine and citrus. First taste gave me a nice hop flavor that was extremely well balance with the maltiness that finishes with a touch of lemon. This is an extremely drinkable beer, and a very good session beer. This is a perfest beer to switch to after a couple of Furious."
"Once again, an utterly unique, new creation from Surly. Keep 'em coming , guys!"
"Ventured out from my hidey-hole to try Surly's latest. I was a little worried since it is described as an Americanized English bitter. This was enjoyable; I like the Americanized part (citrus hops) but not the English part (dry bread and earthy hop tone). I'm just not a big fan of earthy hop flavors that are often found in bitters and ESBs. I'd still have this over most beers at the bar."
"Overall: this is one of the best session beers I have ever had and I think you would agree. Light gentile body, bustling with hop flavor but without much bitterness. It just keeps you coming back for more. IMO this would be a great gateway beer for the MBC crowd, but it still has the respectability and quality of Surly."
"Despite it's name and the use of English malts, I'd be tempted to classify this as an APA rather than an English Bitter. This beer pours a translucent golden color with a small white head. Looks can be deceiving, as this beer might pass for something fizzy and yellow if you have no sense of smell or taste. The aroma has a punch of American hops with some definite citrus aroma coming through. The flavor is nice... subdued like a bitter should and yet filled with a nice, yet not overwhelming hop presence (at least not in my book). It has a light and whispy feel in the mouth.. very smooth. Drinkable? Very. I'll have another..."
