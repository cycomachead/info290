"Final Grade: 4.11, an excellent A-. Brakspear Bitter is a fabulous session ale, and definitely one of the highlights of Marston's 'Classic Ales' sampler. This is not a complex beer, or even necessarily a particularly memorable one - but it's easily one of the best English bitters I've had in years, and for that reason I must give it some sincere props. Solid stuff that all English ale fans should consider worth a shot - I'd definitely be buying more if it were available in this province in a more convenient format."

"O: Certainly not bad but not great. Low ABV ale gets much more flavourful than this."
"O: has some taste, also some stale in there."
"Overall – A very complex Bitter with a lot of character and a well-balanced, ever changing flavour. I liked this one a lot so I drank it almost forgetting to make my normal notes. If you want to try and rate a good bitter I recommend this one."

"Served on cask in Philly. Pours light amber with an almost grapefruit-like hue and the thick creamy head of cask beer. Nose has faint whiffs of biscuits and toast. Taste is surprisingly fruity with back current of woody tannins. Body is thin but supported by the nice carbonation from the cask. Both that and the cask temperature were a huge compliment to the beer; it would have been a far lesser beer served cold from a keg."

"Overall Impression: Considering this ale only sports 3.4% ABV, it packs a malty and flavorful punch! Surprisingly complex and flavorful, this is highly indicative of the English brewing style-- finding ways to create flavorful beers without having to jack up body and ABV. Toffee and caramel flavors explode in the mouth and finish with a earthy bitter twinge. This is an ale that you could drink all night long, enjoy every last drop, and not stagger out of the pub drunkenly."

"Very good, very sessionable, and very reasonable ABV."

"Overall.. quite good taste of Old England. Be really interesting to try to session, but at $9 a bottle, it ain't gonna happen. Difficult to rate given flavour / ABV."

"Would buy it anytime again!"

"Edit: Just looked at the bottle, it's not spoiled however it is brewed in Belguim... I don't know why, but that has a funny feeling to it..."
"O: One of the best additions to the Swedish supermarket shelves so far - why don't we import more beers like this, instead of watered down versions of stronger likes? A great British session beer that's nice on its own, as well as with most typical British (and Swedish) dishes. Go-ood."
"Conclusion-A pretty tasty bitter. At 3.4%, this would make one really nice quaffable (true) session ale. The bitterness is still just a bit high for me, in that (for me) it overtakes the malt just a bit too much. I like my bitters fairly balanced, if leaning towards the bitter side. Still, this one isn’t bad at all."
"All round, an extremely agreeable Bitter and a pleasant companion for the evening. This would be ideal with Shepherd's Pie, English Tikka Masala, or ye olde Fish & Chips."
"A decent ale - the flavour is subtly complex but not over the top. Makes for easy drinking. Worth cracking one open if you come across it."
" Utterly and absolutely gorgeous stuff."
"Very thing body."
"D - A pretty tasty beer for 3.4%. Just a shame the value isn't there. But if I was sitting in a pub by the Thames drinking this all afternoon I'd be happy enough."
"Decent sessioner but not at these prices."
"drinkable if given an open mind."
"Overall I wasn't too impressed, hopefully I'll find a pub that has it on tap, im sure it I would appreciate it more."
"This brew is rather drinkable, due to the mellow taste and a low alcohol content. Nonetheless, I do prefer stronger bitters, and thus consider them as more drinkable."
"Ironically, I don't find most English bitters to be all that bitter. But this one is. I enjoy trying new beers, and this one was no different, but having said that it's way too bitter for my tastes."
"Fairly standard one dimensional bitter with enough of a hop bite to make it palatable. Slightly oily on the tongue. Reminds me of the Badger beers."
"Easy drinking, well made, but not real interesting."
"I loved the colour if the Brakspear, dark amber with an off-white head. On giving it a good sniff it was slighty bready and laced with bananas. The first mouthful was a delight, very smooth and creamy with a refreshing bitterness. But then strange things started to happen, it started to smell vaguely of rubber tyres, oak and even whisky. The problem was a lack of consistency within the pint, one minute there was a strange smell and then the next it was gone. I found that towards the end of the pint it had become stale, reminding me of digestive biscuits that go soft."
"Bottle: Poured a light clear brown color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light caramel malt with some dry Fuggles hops. Taste is also a mix between some dry Fuggles hops and a medium caramel malt base. I thought it was relatively well done for the style."
"Pours a clear light orange/gold, thick big soapy white head forms, drops some lace chunks as it settles down to a thin ring around the glass, looks nice! Smell is weird, some thick malts, caramel, wheat, very bready and biscuity, fresh baked, bit of citrus, some herbal and earthy spiciness, pretty interesting. Taste is quite nice, bit of malty caramel sweetness up front, nutty biscuity middle, herbal bitterness, light touch of roast, bit of a yeasty finish, some floral, nice solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very drinkable stuff, I might have to get more. This would be stellar on cask."
"A decent bottled bitter, could be a little bolder and hoppy though."
"Plain and simple, nice. You can have this beer anytime considering the low ABV."
"A new one at the LCBO. Low in alcohol at 3.5% but very tasty. Lot's of flavours going in in this: malty, butterscotch, biscuit. Very bitter like a bitter should be. The label states that this is a double fermented ale. Very rich, very fresh and very drinkable."
"Easy drinking, classic tasting bitter, I'd love to have it on cask."
"Not a bad bitter for 3.5%. Pours a yellow with some creamy head. Easy drinking, a nice mild bitterness. Neutral to cheesy scent in head. About average mouthfeel,mild hop-grassy.A drop of spice and the band-aid. An average beer, which is not a bad thing."
"I have had a few good offerings I enjoyed from Brakspear. But this beer, a 3.5% well malted bitter, was nothing like what it should be. I will try to avoid a rant before it begins by saying anyone who's been to England and had true bitters, that is to say unpasteurized, unfiltered and fresh off cask, can attest that these imports are a ghost of the real selves. That said, this is all I have to go by ... at least hopefully only for now."
"D - Doesn't get any more drinkable than this. Superb."
"nice amber color, firm and creamy head ... smell of wet grass and fresh hops with hints of tar .... taste of pink grapefruit, macadamia, with hints of sultanas and lime ... a bit watery, perhaps ... nevertheless, probably one of the better brews from Wychwood ...."
"Low ABV of 3.4% makes it an excellent beer for session drinking."
"Overall - A pretty standard bitter... no real flaws just not the most exciting beer in the world... worth a try..."
"This is a well balanced beer, not sweet or sour, just a pleasant session beer, ideal for an afternoon in a beergarden on one of those rare sunny days we have during an English summer."
"D: Goes down really easy. And with an abv of 3,4%, you could drink a considerable amount of it without getting too cocky."
"The colour is of copper yellow wild honey and it pours with weird big bubbles looking like soap. The smell is bitter with apples, pears and a pinch of caramel. The initial taste is almost of apple juice with the bitterness kicking in after a few seconds. But, I'm sorry to say, I found it very watery and on the flat side (but then why not? It's a low-alcohol English bitter). The aftertaste is not so bad although the as a whole I think the product begs for another percent ABV."
"Other comments: This bitter stands out from the ""bog standard"" bitters you find in England because... well... it's actually bitter!"
"(Edit: I first encountered this as part of the old All Saint's Brands import portfolio, and was positively ecstatic to see it return via Shelton Brothers - naturally, the brewery closed soon after! May or may not be brewed by the good folks at Wychwood . . . I sure hope so!)"
"660 ml brown bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Served with original Brakspear pint glass, nice! ""Double dropped", ABV is 3.4%. Brewed with Maris Otter malts, Goldings and Fuggles hops. Copper coloured, low head. Aroma of ""dusty"" Goldings hops + rusty iron in stale water + hospital flesh wound dressings(!) Flavour is very tasty for a 3.4% pasteurised beer, nicely balanced between the malts and hops, nutty and toffee elements, not sweet. Moderate carbonation. A nice Fuggles finish."
"The carbonation is light and pleasant with tiny bubbles, making this a highly drinkable beer. As a bitter should be."
"M&D: the soft mouthfeel is consistently backed by subtle and fine carbonation--very good cask-conditioned; light-bodied, simple-flavoured, this is a good honest bitter to savour--could use bolder flavour to really stand out, though."
"Pours a hearty amber color with some tan head and nice foaming action. Smell comes out maltier than I expected for a bitter, nutty maybe. There are also some nice hop characteristics in there. Taste is more hoppy than the smell let on, and a bit biscuity and buttery, with the nutty malt flavor backing it up. And of course it's got that nice biting bitter kick at the end which I've really come to enjoy a lot recently. Yum."
"This bitter poured a clear, amber-red color with off-white foam that settled slowly and which clung to the glass a bit. The smell was mildly fruity hops with mild malt. The taste was malty and fruity with a very light sweetness and low hoppiness. There was a bit of buttery diacetyl upfront. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and very low carbonation. This was a very enjoyable bitter and excellent as a session beer."
"Drinkability  This Bitter is refreshing and very well-balanced and definitely worth a look."
"Found this at Manchester Wine & Spirits in CT. Poured out a light copper/amber color with a very little head that went to lacing all the way until the end. Smell consisted of malts, biscuits, buttery tones and some soft fruit. Blended well together actually. Taste was good, but the mouthfeel was quite flat. Perhaps a bad bottle but it was pretty flat. But the taste held up nicely. British brewed beers usually like to be on the low side of carbonation so perhaps that's what the beer is supposed to be but I didn't like it that way. Other than that not a bad bitter."
"I'm impressed."
"This is an interestingly refreshing beer. It goes down very easily, but I'm definitely not getting bored with it. I could drink this all night."
"Pours a nice light copper color with a light but pretty sticky head,aroma is light and slightly grassy and mineral-like.Flavor is nice and subtly hopped with some mineral flavors with a nice slightly sweet malt backbone.A true sessions beer in my mind a great find."
"Would get again. pat"
"Overall very good and I would order another."
"Poured a fairly standard amber but not a lot of character. Didn't have that glow I like in a beer that's pale enough to see through. The head was nice and slow to fade, though. The nose was surprisingly hoppy as was the flavor. Since the body was really thin the abundant hopping was forced to carry the beer. Unfortunately, the hops (Goldings, according to Oakes at least) don't have enough flavor and character besides the bitterness and a slight medicinal quality to add much excitement. Although the malt there was nice, like buttered caramel, there wasn't enough of it. Not bad, just not good. Easily quaffable though."
"A cloudless amber color, the head modest but quite short-lived leaving a fine sheet of lace to blanket the glass. The nose crisp and clean with the malts dominant and lightly sweet tones to seal it off. Front is lightly sweet, the top skimpy and the acidity modest in its bite with a nice English hop spiciness that makes the Bitters and ESB, special brews that I enjoy as often as I can."
"Notes: Quite an impressive little ale at 3.4% abv, the head retention has its problems but on a whole this is a stellar bitter. It was worth the 3.99 (I personally would not pay more) a pop and an ale to go back to when I crave a refreshing bitter."
"Brilliantly clear light copper hue, topped by a thin, but persistant head that leaves loose lace.  Rustic, leafy, dry - hopped, earthy Fuggles hop nose hits the nose upfront, & is ensued by biscuit malt, light caramel and mild diacetyl butterscotch.  The malt profile is a seemless extension of the aroma, being comprised of biscuit & light buttery diacetyl, w/ malt sweetness provided by light crystal malt.  Hop bitterness offsets malt sweetness perfectly, lending an overall balance to this bitter.  Ample residual dextrins provide a full body, & when coupled with the low carbonation, the mouthfeel is slickly smooth.  Assertively British, earthy Fuggles hop flavor.  Finishes w/ fading biscuit notes.  Brakspear Bitter is a very flavorful & full bodied session brew, especially considering its low gravity.  The best ""light"" beer I've ever tasted!"
