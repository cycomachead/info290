There's toffee and caramel on the nose with some roasted malts, but not much going on aroma-wise. Big roasty malts with some chocolate and more toffee flavours in the ale itself. There's a little bit of piney hops, but not a lot. I'm even noticing some oakyness rounding it off at the end. The flavor profile is nicely balanced...not very complex, but fairly smooth and easy to drink. It's an enjoyable ale, but nothing more.","greenmtn1111","Beers"

4.54,24.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The flavors and aromas of beer (and food) trigger emotions and memories for me, just like music. Colonel Blides Cask Ale is one that does not disappoint. When brewing my own, one style I continually attempted to perfect was an English Cask Conditioned Ale. From time to time, I stumbled across a brewery that was offering a hand pumped ale, and always ordered it. This beer looks great. It's smell is awesome - it triggered that ""ahhhh"" in my brain that said ""yea, this is good"". It tastes very much like it should. A few too many bubbles, but when I let it warm slightly from the fridge temp, there were less bubbles and it became real. If you enjoy the style, this is definitely worth a try.","Sipchue","0"

The pour was pretty standard for me with a some decent head on it and an amber colored body. The beer wasn't much more than a regular English Bitter. The flavor is on the dry and malty side. Not much hop aromas of taste coming from this one. For me this beer was just average and not much more. Just another English Bitter.","Knapp85","Dec 20, 2010"
4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"started to pour this one into the glass, it became quickly obvious that it was going to be a voracious pour, so I quickly slowed it down, but even still, it took two times to get the full bottle into the glass. A huge head, almost immeasurable in size formed on the top and quickly spilled over down the sides of the glass. Very vigorous and lively pour here. The color was bright amber yellow, somewhat hazy and cloudy, but very light and bright. There was tons of carbonation visible throughout the entire glass, which really kept up throughout the entire session. Nice light yeast and fruity characters coming out right away. Some light smells of peaches, bananas, light cereal grains, and grasses were all picked up right away. Very bright aroma, here for sure. Really a nice tight profile and seemed to be very nice. A touch spicy in the back end I was starting to pick up, and some muted hop aromas, though nothing terribly extreme here. Lots of light cereal grains, light fruit, bananas, peach, a hint of lemon perhaps, all mingling in together and giving it a very light flavor. Hints of grass coming through now along with a slightly muted hop profile are really starting to make this one pop now. The finish was crisp, clean and quick, straight to the point. A nice sharp cutoff of light grassy hops gave way to a lingering flavor of light grain. Super light bodied and very highly carbonated would be the best way to describe this one. The feel was extremely light, classic for a blond ale, and much lighter then even a pale ale would be. Huge carbonation profile really helped it go down effortlessly, with a smooth clean and crisp finish.","mikesgroove","Nov 23, 2010"

4.15,14,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Colonel Blide looks nice, nice in that a nice bright white sudsy head stays on top throughout the ride. Sticking is minimal but it's there if you look for it. For a English Bitter this is much darker than other versions. Id say a bright brown with gold within sets the mood. Smell is quite sweet but not cloyingly so. I get a bunch of apple, slight pear with caramel in small spirts. A nice earthy hop background keeps it together. I never experienced a bitter with such a fruity component and Im liking it. The usual bitter characteristics are there including pale malt(muted), bready morning food, and a touch of grain. The fruit is a added bonus and apple and pear are up there with some others following. The feel is spactacular and smooth with a minimal bite of carbonation, that's barely noticable. A medium bodied bitter with uummmpppphhh. I really liked this and I had another. Very easy to drink but not that easy to find, I never saw this anywhere in the philly area, or even heard of it. Thanks Scoats for bringing this one to my attention.","BARFLYB","Aug 07, 2010"
4.1,12.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Had a glass at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. While this was a tasty ale, I was disappointed that a beer with ""cask"" in the name was poured with CO2. Still, it was a subtle and well-balanced beer. Up front there were toasted mildly nutty barley, which were then backed by floral, herbal citrus hops that I couldn't quite place as either American of British. Still I think this beer would fit in just fine at an English pub, the body was, light, drinkable, and true to style. I really enjoyed and hope I can find a case around here.","tempest","Jul 28, 2010"

Aroma is very creamy and has a orange sorbet undertone. Also has a bready rye component. The taste is very smooth and fruity. Dry esters of fruit come through with a bitterness that give this beer a nice bite. This is one of my favorite cricket hill beers next to their jersey summer ale.
