"Not very good.  Definitely the weakest of the beer camp series so far. If this were homebrew I would give it away to non-particular friends or dump it."
"3.52/5.00"
"I Pop!ped the cap and commenced a gentle pour so as not to rouse the lees that had collected in the punt. This meant no head until I used the bartender's trick and stirred it in the glass. I got a brief two fingers of tawny head that fell rather quickly. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "

"Taste-Tosated malt, nice dose of fruity/herbal hops. Well-balanced and tasty. Session-worthy."
""
""
"This is further proof that I utterly failed in my strategy to drink this 12-pack. This is probably the best I've had so far. This, like the Torpedo Pils, I would probably buy again if it ever saw the light of day."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Disclosure that the ESB's are not on my favorite beer list.  That being said, this is one of the better ones I have ever had.  I would buy this one again, and that says a lot!"

"12/1....BCAA 10/12...bright copper with fst fizzy white foam. Light lager remains. Musty malt nose, soft citrus. Tasty chewy malt body with a buzzed hop bitter. Firm carbonation. Toasty and smooth."

"Aroma of noble hops and a bit of expected dated malts.  Touch bready and with a light apple fruit note.  Taste follows with a hint of lemon and a notable but balanced bitterness.  Finish is fairly dry with a subtle hint of lemon sweetness and a balanced bitterness on the finish.  Rather nicely done and finish is crisp and balanced for the style.  Coarse and lightly bready on the finish yet expected given a relatively robust take on the style."
"So it's bitter. Little aftertaste. Kind of a one trick pony. Just OK."
""
""
""
"Overall an ok toasty bitter, lacks body and is very light and watery. Nothing special will forget it in no time~"

"Pours dark orange and hazy with a short head that faded pretty quickly. Aroma was sweet, bready malt, with some slight fruity notes. Taste was pretty malty up front, but lots of fruity orangish flavors as well. As it warmed, more citrus and fruity flavors came forward. This one is a little old, but has held its own over time."
""
""
"Overall: Good but not exceptional/ Lack of lacing a drawback."
""
""
""
"Enjoyable."
"O: Not too impressed given the two breweries involved. Certainly no flaws just not as complex as I would have expected and overall I found it a touch too sweet with not quite enough bitterness"

"O: A decent session beer for a carnival.  Nothing subtle but well rounded for a beer that could appeal to the masses.  No crazy flavors or notes, but it gets the job done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, considering the reliable—and, in the case of New Glarus, reliably awesome—names behind this bitter (one of my favorite styles, no less), it's an underwhelming offering: it's interesting, but not necessarily very pleasing.  I'm glad to have tried it—and went back for seconds, to clarify my impressions—but I don't believe I could call it a success."
"It was good to see Sierra and New Glarus collaborate on this traditional style of beer.   Make more please and get other breweries to make this style of beer every once in a while too."

"Overall, this beer is drunk on the day of our style-quest, where we attempt to round out the remaining styles we need to rate on BA.  We’ve been excited to sample each of the Beer Camp offerings, so we figured that here we could kill two birds with one stone.  “There and Back” served both of these purposes nicely.  This is an expectedly mild beer, with a bit more sweetness than hoppiness for the style.  The bitterness of it tends to come on the back, and as you allow for each sip to settle.  We found this to be a refreshing presentation and introduction of that aspect of the beer, rather than being killed off the top with forced flavoring.  The malts are allowed to build to their dark, biscuity center; enough to cushion the bitterness of yeast, booze, and toast.  This will be easy to enjoy for most beer lovers."
""
"O- Very impressed with this one. Lots of great toasty and sweet qualities. Too bad this was only brewed once. This would be a go-to drinker for me."
""
"A tasty and thirst-quenching beer, some nice simple tastes and aromas.  It's solid and easy to drink.  Since it's a one-off, this is your only chance to try it, so I'd say it's worth picking up if you run across it.  You're not going to be heartbroken if you miss out on it, though."
""
"O: I have a soft spot for ESBs and this one hits the spot. I dig it."
""
""
"Begins with an earthy, spicy nose floating on a rich British malt backbone. It pours brilliant coppery amber with a 1” white foam cap that provides rich lace. Big grainy malt initiates the palate with light spice, a hint of chocolate, caramel and vanilla over a subtle malty sweetness in the background that fades into a grain spiced dry finish. There and Back’s medium body and medium low carbonation make it an easy drinking session beer."
"O- an easy drinking English mild with nice fruity notes"
""
"Pours a dark amber with a medium off white head. Aroma and Taste is of mild toasted grains, barley, fruity notes, caramel malt and a bready. Palate is a medium crisp body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet malted toasted grains, yeast and mild bread flavor, fruity notes with mild bitterness. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, crisp, refreshing and tasty."

"Western PA backwoods... I JUST got this. I know it may be a bit past it's prime. Here goes. 12oz into the snifter. Cool looking tangerine hue, and a 1/2 finger of white head that dropped to virtually zero in quick succession. Clean (SN standard?) aroma, distinct bitter note, and a hoppy (floral) note in there as well. Up front bitterness on the tongue, and a decent malt presence. Mild, light, and pretty refreshing. It's good. Overall, this was nice. I am not too well-educated on ESB. Despite the slightly old bottles, I was not disappointed."

"Looks like, tastes, and feels like a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale with a lot less hops and more toasted malts. Average at best. A disappointment in my book from two top notch Brewers. Was expecting something much more than this. Not a bad beer by any means, though - just around average. When did a bitter get to 5.6% ABV?"
""
"Overall a nice beer to try, would drink again!"

"O-Yet another miss from the Beer Camp pack."

"Pours a hazy, dark copper color.  2/3 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, hint of hop, hint of pale malt, slight citrus, and a hint of alcohol.  Fits the style of an English Bitter.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, citrus, hops, hint of pine, hint of pale malt, slight alcohol, and a hint of yeast.  Overall, great appearance, good aroma, great aroma, great blend, and decent feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it started nicely, aroma was pretty good for an English Bitter, but the flavor profile just swung and missed, so much iced tea and sweet malts that attempt to be syrupy but not quite there, just wasn't really enjoyable for an english bitter. Also not nearly as bitter as expected, and little on the grassy leafy herbal earthy hops. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
"pours a clear copper color, with foamy off-white colored head that fades.  aroma is biscuity malt.  more of the same in the taste - a bit bready.  not really much hop flavor, but does have some bitterness to balance out the malt.  medium body and carbonation."
""
"O: a little thin, but enjoyable;"

"Had this on tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Louisville, my ninth review of a Sierra Nevada offering.  Call me old fashioned but I think I prefer my bitters to be...you know, bitter.  This one is very mild, and the fruitiness wasn't really welcome either.  The color is an orangish-amber, not a bad look.  It's all right, just not my favorite."
"Bottle from the mix pack. Pours deep hazy copper colored with a one finger white to off white head. Aroma of characteristic SN yeast, some light bitterness, bready malt, straw. Flavor is malty to the core, bready with some fruits in there like figs and apples, clean crisp finish of straw and sugars. Light bodied, crisp, medium plus carbonation. Not bad, easy drinking, seems on style, but a style that doesn't excite me that much. One of the better in the style for me though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o; Nice and smooth, but a bit too fruity and bitter for my English Bitter preference, although that dissipates towards the end probably due to warming.   Might be better served closer to the English standard of 55-60 rather than around 50 as I did due to storing it in a beer fridge set to 48."
"So many good pieces but several that take away.  Still a worthwhile ale."
""
""
""
"Overall: Supreme drinkability and a well crafted example of the style. 3.9"
""
""
""
"EDIT: As I finish this, I'm detecting more nice malty flavor with a slight floral element to the hops, and I'm enjoying enough to give it a boost in flavor points."
""
""
"D:  This was my least favorite of the pack and that might be given the style.  That said it is brewed quite well and has a great drinkable balance.  Just a bit uninspired for me."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very nice, malt forward flavors create a sweet presence then transitions to a dry  and crisp finish"

"Solid ESB with toasted caramel flavors and I light hoppy backbone.  Balanced with a drying finish. Milky, smooth texture."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark copper body with a quarter inch of head. Bready aroma, with alcohol, line, sweet, fruity malts. Earth flavor with underlying herbal notes. Light line and perhaps a touch of citrus. Not on par with the quaffable British bitters. Another mediocre, boring Beer Camp offering."
"Toasty and nutty bitter with a moderate amount of hop flavors and plenty of contribution from the yeast, balanced to say the least. Not a hype brew but for me this is a refreshing bitter to drink down on this swampy, humid day."
""
"O - Not especially inspired, but well put together and a decent effort."

"Overall:  I note that a number of reviewers are incorrectly calling this an ESB and a few are calling it an English Pale Ale - I think the problem is that many folks are unfamiliar with an English Bitter, as few domestic craft brewers tackle the style and those that do tend not to bottle it; in any event, for a bottled Bitter, this is OK though it lacks some of the earthy bitterness and stone fruit flavor to really nail the style"
""
""
""
""
"This is a pleasant beer, but I have to knock off points because I feel it is just a bit too hoppy for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The nose is bitter, earthy hops.  Very rustic and musty with a little citrus zest.  The flavor is malt pelts, grassy and bitter hops.  A little hay/straw note, very grainy.  This is a bit all over the place, dancing around from flavor to flavor, not really working together.  This is not as balanced as I would like it to be.  Still good and refreshing, but could be better."
""
""
""
""
"This ESB is perfectly inline with a ESB, I am not sure what others were expecting but this is a very fine 'almost' sessionable ale. I love the fruitiness of the hops with the strong malt backbone. It's not the best beer in the world but it is fine for what it is."
""
"Bottle: Poured a light copper color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention.  Aroma consists of fruity ester with light dry bitter notes. Taste is also dominated by dry caramel malt notes with some fruity ester. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Enjoyable as a one-time beer but not something I would necessarily seek again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light orange color with a short 1/2"" head that breaks down rather quickly. Fruity characteristics dominate along with some caramel, light floral bitterness, and and a touch of breadiness. Crisp throughout and nicely refreshing. When you are looking for an ESB with some nice flavor, this is it."
""
""
"A very unremarkable beer. Not much to smell and not much to taste. Fizzy water beer. Not a bad, but certainly not a good beer. So far I think I want to call my parents and be picked up from Beer Camp early."

"Overall, not the best of the bunch but not the worst either.  No wow factor."
""
""
""

"Gentle hop flavor with herbal element and slight caramel flavor from the malt with subtle fruity  yeast taste with hint of dry toast and yet creamy flavor from malt and yeast comingling which adds a light smooth yet not really buttery aspect. The taste is great-what you expect from an English bitter-a blend of hops malt and yeast. I am finding more to enjoy as it warms with light spice and slight dark sugar in the back with mildly bitter herbal hop aspect in the finish. Overall I could drink this every day...enjoyable actually a pretty great bitter/ESB with lots of dimension ...my second favorite in the case so far: splendid and enjoyable"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking and par the course for this variety."
""
""
""
""

""

"Poured a nice clear amber body with fairly lively carbonation at first, which quickly died off and a fluffy white three-finger head that slowly receded. A nice looking bitter. Scents of sweetly floral hops, medium levels of fruity esters reminiscent of apple, a moderate presence of caramel, a lightly earthy herbal hop presence in the background, a touch of alcohol faintly discernible and light presence biscuity malt. Overall impression is a sweet, malty aroma with a nice balancing touch of fruity esters and hop aromas. Very pleasing and quite balanced. Flavor begins malty sweet with notes of caramel and slight toasted and nutty malts balanced by a nice moderate level of hop bitterness with an herbal and lightly citrusy character. This moves into a moderately bitter middle with notes of herbal and floral hop flavors and a medium-light level of fruity esters with a balancing pale and nutty malt backbone. Finish is dry with notes of toasted and nutty malt, herbal, earthy and zesty citrus fruit hops and a light presence of fruity esters with a touch of alcohol. Aftertaste is dry with notes of resinous hops, toasted and nutty malts. Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth feeling with low carbonation adding to this impression. Overall this is a good English Bitter. It balances sweet, nutty and toasted malt flavors with a nice level of hop character and bitterness to create a moderately bitter, yet still balanced impression on the drinker. Its aroma is similarly balanced and the mouthfeel adds to impression of a balanced, quaffable session ale. A very nice beer and one of the best of the Beer Camp series."

"But then the beer warmed up, and a whole bunch of neatness began to shine through.  (Maybe that's the whole ""English"" thing--since they drink this warm, we should, too.)  The back end began, miraculously to take on strong nodes of Sierra Nevada yeastiness.  The combination of somewhat rougher American nodes livened up the beer considerably."

"New Glarus and SN know beer, so when they say this is nutty they aren't joking. I catch not only a nutty malt but pecans and almonds. There is a light hop bitterness and some pine but the nutty malt flavors are more pervasive. This is very highly carbonated and has some harsh tendencies along with a bit of bitterness. This is a very nice entry in the Beer Camp 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a bland English Pale Ale.  Very muted malt flavor.  I did enjoy the light bitter aftertaste, but it needed way more body."
""
""
""
"A well done English Bitter. Easy drinking. Light hops, with a solid, but unobtrusive malt backbone."
"Overall a good beer that was nice and malty with just enough hop zest to add to the flavor. I’m not well versed in this style, but I really enjoyed this beer and will have to check out more English Bitter’s."

"Really great collaboration as part of the Beer Camp offerings. I think this is my favorite one so far and I have had about half of them. An excellent Summer beer. Crisp, refreshing, very nice."

"O- This is such a well-balanced, flavorful, and smooth English Ale.  This one caught me by surprise, quite a treat."

"O:  This is very nice.  Reminds me of a civilized, gentle bitter quaff."
"Overall – A decent bitter overall, but really nothing all that fantastic."
""
""
""
"O:  A good beer, overall.  Simple, but tasty, crisp, and refreshing."
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass with a slight white head.  Light anger color with a steady amount of light bobbles.  Malty toasty smell with a slight fruity taste.  Slight toasty taste with a good malt backbone and a slight amount of hops.   Has a slight bitter taste and has that English tent.  Slight carbonation but I think it could use a little more.  Pretty good beer.  Haven't had many English bitters but I do like this one."
"Turbid copper colored body with a white head. Toasty malt, nutty and caramel aromas. Malty flavors with dry fruity hop finish. Tasty."
""
"Overall - The fruitiness is odd for the style, but everything else is pretty good."
"O - This beer reminded me of many other New Glarus brews. You can tell they are experts at picking out and mixing the finest imported malts. That being said, this collaboration falls short of other malty New Glarus ales like Fat Squirrel. My wife and I had great hope for this beer (we previously lived in Wisconsin) and while we were happy enough with it, it made us wish for the real deal."

"O: A solid and easily drinkable English-style bitter. Just enough complexity to keep you coming back for more. Pretty standard fare for an English-style brew"
""
""
""
""
"D - A very decent representation of a style that I wish more American brewers would tackle... Quite quaffable... Goes down easily sip after sip... Good complexity and quite enjoyable... I'm still early on on my exploration of the Beer Camp Across America offerings, but this one is one of my favorites thus far..."

"The body is smooth, full, and even, with a nicely dry finish. Drinkability is very good, I could see knocking off a sixer on a summers afternoon with no problem. Overall, a very pleasant beer, and one of the ones from this box that I'd like to see as a stand alone brew."
""
"O: I'm not going to lie, given New Glarus' pedigree, I had hoped that the collaboration brew would be fruit based. That said, this bitter is a pretty decent 'no frills' example of the style. It's a one-two punch of toasted malt and herbal hops; not the most polished and smooth bitter on the block, but not bad. You don't always have to shoot for the moon with collaboration beers."

"Overall, I must admit that my experience with this style is very limited. This is the first I've reviewed on BA, but I've had a couple in the past, and while There And Back seems to touch all the bases for the style, I feel like the fruitiness could come out a bit more and the bitterness could be a lot more assertive. In spite of having a favorable appearance and mouthfeel that seems ""to style", the aroma and taste just fall well short for me, which brings the overall down for me."
"O: Easy drinking and refreshing. A thirst quencher."
""
""
"Prost!"
"O - This was a very sold ESB. Very malt forward with a light hop presence. A nice crisp version of the style."

"Overall: A very solid take on the English ESB style. Good toasty and nutty malt presence with some good citrus hop esters."
""
""
""
""
"Clean and simple with a Nutty toasted malt flavor and a slightly floral dry finish. I love the simplicity of this one because it delivers all its characteristics at the end. It starts smooth and somewhat light but follows up with a little kick of dry hops and toasted malt to give it a crisp finish. Its not outrageous, more classy and to the point."
"12oz bottle. Pours a brownish amber color with a half inch of head. Fair amount of lacing. The aroma is pretty faint. Some faint citrus and herbal hops. That's about it. The taste is some of the citrus and floral hops with some light nuttiness and some bread. Sweet lightly toasted malts at the end with some fruity hop notes. Medium bodied. Minimal alcohol presence. One of the more boring beers of the mix pack. Overall, meh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Just like the style usually is, boring, simple and easy to just slam down and move to the next beer. My final beer in the beer camp 12 pack, and it closes just like it started, boring, half assed, nothing special. Sierra Nevada dropped the ball on this pack, from getting a hoppy pale ale 2 months after bottled on date, to the overall collection of world class breweries collaboration to make some real lame beers, this was a disappointment and sierra Nevada should publicly apologies to all the drinkers of this collection."

"Overall a well crafted beer, very drinkable and flavorful."

"This seems to not a very good imitation an English Bitter, though it does have the mineral taste and fruity hop note. From the 12 oz bottle as part of the 2014 Beer Camp box, purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach."
""
"O - Fairly simple and straight-forward beer. Mostly in line with the style. Boring but easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very good. A light, refreshing beer with good balance between malt and hop. It's a little fruitier than I am used to for the style, but even that component is done with balance. The finish is slightly astringent and what I would describe as very mildly boozy. Overall, though, this is a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a decent beer in a style with which I'm not specifically familiar - English accents abound, subtle, light but staunch - worth a go-round even if only once."
""
""
"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and New Glarus. Pours a clear copper color with a good amount of froth. Smell is sweet, sweet, sweet, almost cola sweet. The flavor profile is pretty sweet also. Bitter as an ESB should be, but I also get a raw alcohol taste that is quite unpleasant. Mouthfeel is smooth but its hard to get over that taste. Not a fan of this guy, probably my least favorite out of the Beer Camp."
"O - nothing extraordinary, but is very well crafted. No complaints here."
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this take on the style. Not as heavy as some I've had in the past and one I would enjoy again."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and the taste has a nice balance of contrasting fruity and malty flavors."
""
""
""
"A very nice beer. One of my first of the English bitter style. The appearance was a nice hazel with an off white head that trailed the glass. The smell was really nice with orange and floral notes coming through. The taste was really nice with crisp pops of hop and malt flavor while maintaining a nice bitter fruit flavor. The mouthfeel was nice also for a warm day and a nice amount of carbonation."
"O: Good bitter. Good bittersweet flavor with a balanced sweet finish. A lot going on in the flavors that keep evolving as it warms. Solid beer."
""

"Taste is thick chewy biscuity malt with a nice rounding nut flavor pushed hard away by a bitter herb liveliness. A very tasty easy drinking beer."
"This is a pretty good take on the style. It's both bitter and malty, and is very drinkable."
""
"O- Another solid beer in the Beer Camp series."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/22/2014. Pours lightly hazy orange/copper color with a 1-finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of citrus zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of citrus zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and robustness of earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and fruity yeast flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English bitter. Good balance and robustness of earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall, well I'm not upset this is a one off."
"Otherwise, taste is good, mouth feel and appearance is around what is expect for a bitter style."

"Pours out a brilliantly clear copper with a thin head. I get lots of juicy fruit from the yeast and hops. Caramel and toasted bread aromas. Smells great. Flavor is malty with a solid caramel backbone. A lot more toast than in the nose. Hops are subdued in flavor - herbal and floral. Bitterness is solid in the finish. Aftertaste is very fruity. Dry. Mouthfeel is fairly light. Too much carbonation for me. This is a great American example of a British bitter. Great job."
""
"Overall: cleanly brewed beer, but nothing that stands out to me. This would be better on cask or from an engine."
""
""
"Overall: A fantastic bitter! Reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but with more floral hoppiness as opposed to a stronger bitterness."

"Has a nice brown ale appearance with small head that doesn't hold that long. Smell is nice. Very bready and grainy. Fresh grain smell I like. The taste is quite shocking and interesting. Almost a numbing quality like novacaine but I don't mean that in a negative way. Its honestly void of flavor, but not in a negative way like a cheap watery adjunct. Incredibly sessionable. Maybe my pallet is off from the last one, but aside from a slight grain flavor upfront and slight hop finish, this beer I really can't detect much flavor yet I still crave it. Overall, its a wonderful session beer but unfortunately this is a 1 and done beer camp sampling. If this were sold regularly, I'd buy periodically as a great lawnmower, pallet break beer."

"O: Nice showcasing of the style, but a little subdued for me. The case is slow going for me, and I'm noticing a trend in what all their beers have in common (which I seem to also notice in other breweries from which I've had a lot ). I find that I'm not liking their trend, but that is besides the point."
"(As an aside: it's getting quite boring to taste all these ""proper"" flavors in such muted form- it's like beer drinking on training wheels.)"
"Pours a light brown amber/copper color, like a redwood stain. The beer might be a touch hazy, or perhaps, it’s just the color. The head initially kicks up as a blanket of off white foam. It’s a touch fizzy and fades away after a minute, leaving moderate lacing. Not the most vigorous. Mild but rich caramel in the aroma. A touch of cough syrup. Bready malt, a bit simple but nice. Some fruitiness, mostly strawberries, grapes, cherries and raspberries, but all sweet with no acidity. Mild hoppiness, some sort of herbal, earthy, mineral-ish spice in the background. Taste is fairly sweet. The malt is nice, but the sweetness climbs a bit much and takes on an off character with that cough syrup flavor, which I’ve noticed in other English-style beers, as well. That same sweet fruitiness and mild hop flavor. It’s a fruity, earthy flavor. Finish dries out some, ending with a mineral finish. Mouthfeel is quite full. Carbonation is fairly low. The beer does wash out a bit at the end. Decent beer and it’s always nice to try a less common English style."
""
"I was not familiar with this brewery before trying this beer. I was not expecting much at all really, but I felt that it was a well balanced beer. Not too ""bitter"" as the label and style would lead you to believe, but it was a very sold and good quality beer. Nice golden bronze color, taste was not bitter, but well balanced like a pale ale more than anything I could explain. This is probably one of the stepchildren of this package but I think it is as good or better, based purely upon my expectations of the more lauded breweries, as any other beer in this offering."
""

"O: an excellent and easy drinking version of the style."
""
""
"Nothing crazy, nothing awful, just a solid good bitter."
""
"O- Decent English bitter, drinkable with no off-flavours."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this brew although I wouldn't say it is to style in terms of being an ESB. If you'd told me it was an American Pale Ale, I would have believed it. In any case, it's a well-balanced, flavorful brew. Kind of like an SNPA but with more bready malt and fruit."
""
""
"The malt character begins in the taste but the assertive traditional English bitterness finishes the drinking experience."
""
""
"Overall, very impressive from start to finish, here’s to complexity I’m game for a beer like this anyday!"
"This comes off more as a extra strong bitter than a standard mild. Like a mild with the volume turned up a but but isn't that exactly an ESB? The abv and hop content pull it there so I feel it is misidentified on the website here. Altogether a good beer regardless. Some more toasty malt character would round out the bitterness better in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: well, its much zestier than i'm used to. i would have like the sweetness to be featured a little more than the spice from the hops. i do enjoy the cracker flavor (which also helps the mouthfeel), but i would like to see just a little more caramel in here for the balance"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy honey color with finger width foamy head. There is mild head retention and lacing on the side of the glass. Sweet, malty aroma. Possible hints of apple. Strong malty backbone with a moderate bitter finish. In the aftertaste, I can discern a mild apple taste. Mildly bitter aftertaste. Decent beer but not really my style. Isn't something I would search for."
""
"12oz. bottle served in a can glass. Pours a hazy caramel hue with a loose, 1/4 inch, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a tight band around the shoulders. Nose expresses a hint of something spicy/fruity as well as grassy/herbal hops character. Taste consistent with nose; however, biscuity and caramel notes are the more prominent features in the flavor profile; whereas the spicy and earthy/herbal qualities come out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that falls a little shy of crisp. Overall, a pretty drinkable ESB with a bit more character to the malt profile than I've come to associate with the style - this might explain the slightly higher abv."
""
"Nice low carbonation factor and a medium body. Light honeydew flavor and aroma had a very silky feel to it. Light toffee flavor, biscuit, piney resin match well with its medium copper color. Nice 2 finger head. I can taste pale malts-bready and chewy- but it has crispness from some lemon character. Low bitterness that excites the palate throughout. Straightforward and very very drinkable."

"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a light, crystal clear, caramel coloring, with a filmy, clingy, off-white head. Nose of subtle caramel and toffee, with roasted notes throughout. Flavors are smooth and sweet, with roasted caramel overtones, rich and layered. Tangy sweet, with a subtle hopping. Smooth and light bodied, with a tangy caramel aftertaste. Smooth, slightly sweet lingering finish. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a very bubbly and white head that does not dissipate for a long while. The beer itself is either a clear dark orange or clear very light brown that can't quite make up its mind about what it is. The beer smell is extremely fruity with strong banana notes and limey citrus notes. The sweet malts are also present but very faint. The taste is less fruity but the lime taste is still there. The sweet malts are stronger but are still overshadowed by the fruity notes. The taste is still close to what a traditional bitter tastes like but the tropical notes do not exactly mix very well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the lighter side with very little biting carbonation. Overall, an okay beer and extremely unique but it doesn't work for me. Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist when it comes to bitters but I just didn't really enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: quite drinkable, with a nice refreshing character. I like it."
""
"This is a pretty nice bitter. Has a consistent mildly roasted edge on it. Heavy malt presence. Spice edge is there from what I assume are more English style hops? Smooth feel. Very easy to drink. I would imagine this would be quite tasty on cask. As it is though, it's very nice. Another hit from the Beer Camp release."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, and slight citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, toast, earth, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Brilliantly clear brew with a lightly toasted, slightly nutty malt character and lots of floral and earthy hops, with a hint of citrus zest and pine. Flavor echoes the aroma, but with more citrus, pine, floral notes, and earthiness. The malt backbone is subtle, but adds character. Fruity specialty malt surfaces late."

"meh, this is one of the least exciting beers in the box, and although its pretty tasty, theres not much to it, and its not a style that gets much stoke going with me. clear lighter copper to bronze sort of color, bright looking, no haze at all. the nose is a little tannic, grain rich and a slightly sweet. there is some nice bittering hops in there as well, but its pretty simple really. the flavor is identical to the nose, the grain tannins are evident and it makes the beer feel a little thin. it also drags on a little too long in the middle, overbalancing the sweetness of the grain, leaving just the bitter hop finish, which isnt anything abrasive, but its more robust than the english ones for the most part. well carbonated and clean drinking, but just a beer thats hard to get too pumped up on. i was hoping for a fruit beer with new glarus, given how fun they get with it, so this was a bit of a drag. good beer though for what it is, as they all are in this box."

"There’s a great aroma that showcases the malts while allowing room for a wonderfully vibrant hop combination. I get a toasted caramel malt note which is balanced by a tropical fruit punchbowl of hoppy goodness. The flavor has that same caramel malty character, rich and fulfilling without being weighted down or heavy. The hops play well in this field with a guava mango floral citrus mélange. It’s not what I’d expect from a run-of-the-mill bitter but here it works, and it works wonderfully. So glad I have another bottle of this to enjoy again later."
""

"Taste is smooth and malty, with a distinctive bitter hops finish. There's some grapefruit on the tongue t the finish, but this is predominantly a malt-based brew, heavy on the toasty grains. A well-done and enjoyable collision of both breweries' distinctive styles."
"This beer pours out a nice walnut color, clear, with a small head--looks pretty English, in other words. Aroma has a crystal-malt caramel smell; hops are present, but very light. In the taste though, bitterness is there and moderately high, but it's well-balanced with malt. Yeast character is slightly fruity. Soft carbonation and body is spot-on too. Really, this is de-lish, a really drinkable English PA (maybe a bit strong to be a bitter per se). The highlight in the set so far."

"Pours into a nonic a clear brass color with a thinner but well sustained white head,hard to find the right adjective for the color so I came up with a light brass.herbal hops and toffee malt in the nose,the hops are bigger than the average English bitter.Hard toffee and mild caramel on the pale with a drying zesty herbal hop finish,again the hops a little bigger than the average of the style.A good quaffing bitter,could drink alot of these in a sitting."

"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about an inch frothy off-white head that stuck around a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like nuts, dried fruit, toffee, bready/caramel malt, and some grassy/leafy hops. It tastes like caramel/bready malt, toffee, nuts, light grassy hops, apple/apple skins, and some herbalness. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating and smooth with moderate carbonation. It's also easy and enjoyable to drink. I thought this was a solid brew, but not a memorable one. With that being said, I wouldn't turn down a bottle."
""
"Cheers!"

"Clear copper gold pour with a white one-finger head and medium carbonation. Aroma is light bread and toast. Flavor is very mild and not overly bitter. Has more of a sweet flavor upfront with tastes of bread, biscuit and caramel. Slight floral bitterness comes towards that back end. Finishes with a mild bitterness."

"pours a dark copper color with a nice inch thick white head. aroma is quite big and you can smell it from a ways off. lots of malt and caramel. clean taste... tad bit of hops, some fruitiness, dry. some orange zest as the primary flavor. body is mild. mouthfeel is a bit creamy. maybe not necessarily to style. nothing extraordinary here just a solid easy drinking beer . good."
""

"Overall 3.5: Good tasting beer, but misses the mark by far in its attempt to be an English bitter. Too many bubbles (too much CO2 or bottle conditioning), not enough focus on the malt, and the hops...don't get me started on the hops. English bitters are known for their restrained and grassy British hops. There is nothing restrained or grassy about the hops in this beer. Again, this is a good beer, but it tastes nothing like an English bitter. This is simply an IPA in ESB's clothing."

"Taste has very mild cracker, straw, and bready malt notes, it's slightly astringent with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Light bodied and fairly drinkable. It's just not all that memorable."

"Coppery amber pour with a transient head that dissipates to zilch. Smell is mild malts, caramels, biscuits. Taste has a nice bready crust and crackers with a little zing of carbonation very light sweetness is eradicated by a wash of bitter. Some very light citrus. Medium body with a crafted mouthfeel. Decent brew. Dry finish. A good English bitter."
""
""
"Overall- Above average to good beer that becomes closer to just good as I continue to drink it. I would definitely give this try but it does seem to lack something that I generally find in most bitters. The promise of nutty and toasted notes mostly goes unfulfilled but I don't think that is a major problem."

"Pours clear amber topped by an slightly off white two finger head. Excellent retention, spotty sticky lacing. Pear, apple, and biscuity notes on the nose.

Light to light medium body, lively carbonation slick and smooth. Really enjoyable and quaffable brew."

"On tap at PreFunk. Is it a bitter? You betcha! Dry and bitter, leaves your tongue tingling. Dark golden, extra malty. Slight hoppiness, but mostly malt, smooth and buttery, slick mouth feel. The hops are what separates this from the English styles, but still not bad."
