3.78,12.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"o: A good refreshing summer drink. Fortunately we are having an unusual warm spell at the moment so it is welcome to drink something this fruity. My main issue is that it is listed as an "English Bitter," but there is too much fruit flavor and not enough malt dominance for it to be comfy in that category IMO. However I did self-serve it at 40 degrees, and most Bitters are best at least ten to fifteen degrees warmer than that. As it is it is certainly not a bad sessionable warm weather brew. I would venture to guess that the whole idea was to modify an English Bitter to make it more drinkable at lower serving temps in warmer weather than is the usual case back in Merry Olde England.","scotorum","Sep 29, 2013"

3.64,8,3,4,3.75,3,3.5,"Refreshing! Makes me want to sit on the porch on a summer night with a pitcher. Easy to drink but its has enough complexity to put it on a shelf above most easy to drink lighter beers. It has a beautiful dark golden color with a starkly lighter colored head. I'm mostly a dark thick beer kind of person but this beer beer impressed me enough for what it was to want to review it.","Insanity55","Aug 11, 2013"
3.21,-4.7,2.75,3.5,3.25,3,3,"Clear light amber in color with lots of bubbles visible. It has a small head that dissipates quickly. Lots of lemon zest and medium bodied malt on the nose. Light fruitiness. Taste is refreshing but flavors aren’t really refined – nothing stands out. Nicely crisp and clean, though with a light bitterness. Good carbonation levels, but maybe too much for a bitter. Overall it’s thirst-quenching but not overly flavorful and a tad watery.","greenmtn1111","Aug 08, 2013"

3.38,0.3,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"O: The beer is a nice adventure for a summer thirst quencher and should be tried. Especially appealing for those looking for a more floral taste and for those that may enjoy iced herbal teas often. The balance could come smoother with a touch less of the elderflower flavors. Good effort overall from Harpoon!","scottbrew4u","Jul 04, 2013"

Curious, since it is supposed to be an English Bitters style beer. Would be great for a hot summer days barbecue or party. Very drinkable.","CaptJackHarkness","Jun 23, 2013"

There's a lack of bitterness at the end of the taste, so this seems close to a SweetTart sort of a beer. It's not bad per se, but I would really need to be at a hot backyard barbeque to want to have another. Good body and carbonation.","smcolw","Jun 01, 2013"

4.01,19,3.75,4,4,3.75,4.25,"Harpoon Midsummer Fling pours a clear orange color with two fingers of head. The aroma is very interesting. There's a pretty strong herb aspect, but also a solid amount of Citra hops backing it up. The taste, is again, very interesting for a summer beer. The strong herbs from the nose overpower the hops here, letting the Citra only shine through slightly with it's citrus tones. A biscuity malt backs everything up. The mouthfeel is light and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Midsummer Fling is one of the more interesting summer seasonals I've had in a while. A Citra hopped and herbed bitter? I've gotta say, it works better than I expected.","shand","0"
