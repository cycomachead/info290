3.15,-14.4,3.75,3,3,3.5,3.25,"really underwhelmed by this red ale, i expected much more, just based on how good the cream stout is. this one falls a bit flat of that mark, but my bottle may not have been stored or handled properly, so that could be a factor. no bottle date to check either. frothy brick red color, pretty clear, glowing darker amber. the nose is stale english malt, muted and dusty, not real appealing, and the yeast seems weird in it, like bread dough or something, unfinished. notes of oatmeal and sweeter red malt on the front end, and barley a bittering hop to finish. i like the mouthfeel pretty well, real frothy and sturdy, especially for a beer so low in alcohol, but there is a weird tannic thing running through it, and with the staleness of the grain, i really dont care much for it. i love their packaging, i find it distinct and alluring, but if these green bottles are responsible for light struck beer, im not a fan anymore. this bottle exhibited those properties for sure. i will revisit this again when i can guarantee its freshness.","StonedTrippin","Jun 10, 2014"

3.68,0,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer pours a deep reddish-copper color (I wouldn't exactly call it Ruby). Nice off-white head, though. The aroma is a nice mix of toasted malts and herbal hops. It has an English hop aroma, with some spice and resiny characteristics. Not bad, but it's not the kid of aroma that jumps at you. The taste is semi-dry. Some fruit, but mostly toasted malt and hops. The beer has a firm and satisfying mouthfeel. Full body, more than the taste and aroma lets on. This one is quite drinkable.","Suds","Feb 04, 2009"
3.88,5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"M&D: the carbonation is just light enough to render a refreshing texture, while the body remains medium for the moderate flavour profile. Overall, this dark amber malty ale gets rather good support from the hops, from time to time showing a necessary sour-fruity edge to balance off the sweetness and bitterness. This is a balanced ale to me and I'd have no problem having a few if in good mood!","wl0307","Feb 01, 2009"

The head fades fast back to film and thin collar, but still manages to leave some very nice lace lines. The strong floral hop and raspberry nose is very enticing. The mouth is mildly carbonated and fiarly light. Strong and distinctive taste of bready malt with a touch of peppermint and a good dose of espresso-like dry bitter hops. The hops last longest, providing an intense bitter for the back of the throat. Must drink more...","Globetrotter","Beers"
