3.9,-1,,,,,,"i really dig this brew here. a well americanized take on a classic english stye.. caramel in color but nice and clear, and having almost a full inch of soft white head. the nose smells like desserty english malt, while the yeast is a burton or something similar. whats unique about this is the flavor in the middle. it has an almost holiday spice cake character, where cinnamon seems obvious, but maybe some molasses and clove too. not over spiced,or even spice per se, but that complexion is there for sure, before its all cleaned up in the finish. loading this much flavor and character into a beer with such low alcohol is a feat, unforced and natural in this beer, and very impressive. clean finishing, plenty of body, and the kind of beer i could gladly have several of given that its both sessionable and different. well done here by rogue, i prefer this to the massive imperial version.","StonedTrippin","Aug 30, 2014"

3.38,-14.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"After cleaning up the initial disaster, this got poured into a mug. A cloudy amber color results, with some decent frothy head, which evaporates sporadically. What remains laces down the glass. Smell was of some caramel malts. Taste was bitter, obviously, with some floral sweetness. No real excessive carbonation.. potentially used it all up earlier. Leaves the mouth dry with a slightly sour aftertaste. A decent bitter overall.","Seanstoppable","Apr 20, 2009"
3.58,-9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Decent attempt, well crafted, but Rogue got a tad carried away with the citrus hop for it to be a top-notch English bitter. If there was an American Bitter then this would score a lot higher.","Shadman","Feb 09, 2009"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this as the Fat Head's Ale at Fat Head's in Pittsburgh on tap. Came in light brown body with minimal head that died and left no real lacings. A citric/leafy hop aroma would be the best way to characterize the smell. A little oily/buttery slickness in this thin-bodied beer, but the hops do come through in a herbal, tea-like punch and there is a moderately dry backbite. An easy to down beer that I recommend.","clayrock81","Jan 20, 2009"

With a bit too much carbonation and some hops that don't belong, it misses the English Bitter style. That being said this is a terrific beer whatever it is. I have had other Northwest ESB's that are similar to Rogues, so call it a NW ESB. Very tasty indeed. It gets even more pleasant as the bubbles subside and it warms up.

3.78,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a clear, medium amber color with plentiful, dense, off-white head. Aromas are very toasty, biscuity, a touch of caramelish toffee, and just a touch of floral hops. On the palate, a dense malt profile really blossoms. All that toasty, caramel like sweetness really pulls through, with a slight dark molasses like touch. The hops are certainly in check. Hop flavor is further relegated to the back and finish of the beer, with floral, slightly spicy tones evident. This malty beer still manages to finish relatively dry and bitter, perhaps a high sulfate water helps. No too bitter but nice.","HopEnthusiast","Nov 08, 2008"

3.88,-1.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: This is a good-quality example of an English Bitter, not necessarily a great style, but a really decent beer for daily drinking. The price tag makes it a bit steep, though.","danielharper","Aug 16, 2008"
4.03,2.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This isn't an English Bitter, nor is it an ESB. It's closer to an American Pale Ale than anything else. But I guess the goal of this beer is an ""Imperial English Bitter", which is a bit of an oxymoron, but they somehow pull it off.

The beer pours as you would expect from a bitter, but wow that first sip has has hops dancing and attacking your mouth. Luckily, the brewer balanced it out with a good dose of maltiness.

4.3,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear, medium to dark amber color with plentiful, dense, off-white to tan head. Aromas are very toasty, biscuity, a touch of caramelish toffee, and just a touch of floral hops. On the palate, a dense malt profile really blossoms. All that toasty, caramel like sweetness really pulls through, with a slight dark molasses like touch. The hops are certainly in check with the 35 IBUs barely making a dent. Hop flavor is further relegated to the back and finish of the beer, with floral, slightly spicy tones evident. This malty beast still manages to finish relatively dry and bitter, perhaps a high sulfate water helps. Another solid offering from Rogue, very true to the British examples.","dreadnatty08","Apr 16, 2008"

I guess the guys at Rogue are going for a true to style bitter. *Tear* for no big hops. Nice and lightly earthy/floral hops on the tongue. Good maltiness with biscuit-like qualities. A good nutty slight sweetness in the tail end. Hops subtly tingle throughtout. Finishes dry with a lingering aftertaste that leans toward the hops. This is what I expect a special bitter to be. Amazing.","timbro81","Apr 01, 2008"

Very nice smell, a true bitter, with enough malt to help even it out a bit. Wondeful taste, a nice balance of malts and hops with a slightly bitter side and slightly bitter aftertaste, just like it should have.

Flavour is restrained, but bitter enough to make it interesting and worth drinking a bomber of! Low-to-moderate carbonation (just the way I like it), and a pleasantly full mouthfeel (especially as it warms) just add to the drinkability.

The aroma is nice, with a bitterness that is easily recognized when you take a good whiff. Also picking up some nice malt characteristics but they seem to be very mellow. The taste is good, very smooth with the malt flavor coming out in front but quickly breaking away to the hop finish that seems to have a fruit like property, or at least is mixed in with the hops.

Warm rounded malts introduce the taste, with a biscuity character being most prominent. There is an ever-so-slight butteriness to the biscuit flavor, and there are some green plum and other watery fruit flavors -- the character is almost woody. Leafy English hops bring the swallow to a close, and a strikingly sharp mineral finish seals it up. The mouthfeel here is incredibly smooth. Medium body gives it just enough heft. A ridiculously drinkable bitter. I actually much prefer this to Rogue's Brutal Bitter ESB. I'm very glad to have found this at Beers of the World in Rochester, and I hope they continue to stock it.

This is probably the least interesting beer that I've had from Rogue, yet it's still very good and almost too drinkable.

There's a fruitiness in there as well, a little bit of citrus like orange. Aftertaste is very pleasant, too, kind of toasted malt. Mouthfeel is a little light for me, but it's not distracting.

Very smooth with a little toastiness, balanced by clean citrous and pine hops. The malt sticks through to the end, balancing the hops quite well with a little caramel sweetness.

Very easy drinking and not over done on the hops. It might be the most ""balanced"" beer Rogue puts out. This might be the best session beer Rogue has out there.

It poured a dark orange color with about an inch of white foam that left patches of sticky lace down the glass. The smell of this beer was quite lite, with a very sweet malty scent and slight scents of orange. The taste was a little weird with a thick malt hit in the beginning that threw me off and reminded me of Marsala wine, a decent breadiness in the middle and a slightly bitter hop finnish. The mouthfeel was good but the taste was just a little off to me. Try it for yourself.","Dmann","Jun 27, 2004"

Aroma reminds me of a very subdued barleywine-esk nose, some caramel, a bit toasty, slight pine sap, sweet malt mostly, dry hop leaves and floralness touch the back end in bigger wiffs. Taste is nice and mild, welcoming warm toasty malts favor from front to back. Some refined and soft malt sweetness of breads and dull fruit keep it smooth and tolerable to the palate. There's a nice subtlety about its approach. Floating and caring malt character with the same amount of comfort with the hop profile which has very slight floral, citrus, and pine mindfully placed in different areas throughout the palate. Feel is light and fluffy with a firm and sturdy, smoother lighter body. Which seems to fit this here, making for a nice little drinker. This is one of the few 12oz bottles with a paper label that Rogue distributes, which is a bit weird, cuz I really like seeing the ingredients listed like on their bombers. Oh well...label, no label, this is a pretty nice beer.","tavernjef","Jun 17, 2004"
3.97,0.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Tawny-coppery gold in hue, this has a lovely color, slightly hazy too. A skimpy white head of a half finger briefly formed, it actually faded to a soapy cap before I could set my glass down after the pour. No subsequent lacing. The nose is brighter than a traditional bitter, as expected by Rogue. The hops shine with good citrusy depth, it is very fleshy with its grapefruit notes. Sharp pine notes follow. However before the bouquet ends the malt becomes noticeable with its biscuit and caramel aromas. I like the fragrance; it is straightforward but inviting. The palate is tasty and dead-on as to what the nose told me what to expect. The hops are a little juicier and the flavors are a bit wider as they encompass both lemon-like citrus and grapefruit. As the hops conclude on the palate they become very dry, which is quite nice. Random orange flavors sprung up. Long hoppy aftertaste, which seems more a kin to an APA, this is no surprise as Rogue is often hard to pinpoint a style on. The malt doesnt say much and it is very secondary only offering suggestions of biscuits and caramel hints. Once the beer warmed to room temperature I thought it fell apart a little, I was a bit too slow drinking it I guess. For the most part this beer is damn tasty. And only modestly bitter. Medium in body, moderate but natural feeling carbonation, the mouthfeel is very pleasant. This was a pleasure to drink. Very enjoyable, true it is quite tame compared to other Rogue beers; Im not knocking it though. I bought a 12-ounce bottle in Iowa City for $1.80. Id drink it again.","bditty187","Jun 16, 2004"

Initial smoothness, gives way to a stinging carbonation on the tongue, which lessens as the beer warms. Fruity and juicy hop flavors dominate. There's a very nice roasted malt and caramel flavor underneath. Finish is moderately bitter and hints at a dryness that never quite materializes. The bitterness is balanced pretty well with the malt flavor and actually I thought the beer would have been more bitter than it was. Nuances in the flavor really emerge as the beer warms to room temps. The water almost seems to have an English ""hard-water"" quality to it.","Winter","Oct 24, 2003"

Very clear orange amber color. With the flavor I'm again taken by the strength of the hops presence. The malt balances and smooths off the hops, thus preventing the drink from being to bitter, but aren't offering enough of a presence to make it a malt based beer. Even with warming the malt didn't make enough of a presence. Nice smoothness to the mouthfeel, making it an easy drink. A good tasting beer, but not a fine enough sample of style. Not sure why my sample is different than others. No dating on the bottle to give a hint as to that issue.","garymuchow","Aug 06, 2003"

Much hoppier than a British bitter would be, but fortunately not too tart and one of the easiest beers to drink on the face of the planet. This beer has it all; a robust, sweet malt quality that is salty, chewy and sugary all in one. A huge hop presence that does not overwhelm the beer (only Dogfish IPAs are such hoppy beers that are simultaneously restrained). A tantalizing yeastiness that makes you praise God for bringing back small, unfiltered microbrews. All around great. I am very jealous of our fellow beerdrinkers at the Horse Brass Pub in Portland, OR, who get to enjoy this from a cask every day of the week.","Thrasher","May 03, 2003"

Well the YSB pulls that off brilliantly. Excellent balance here, making for a very quaffable ale. Up there with Troegs and Anderson Valley's Belks as one of the best American ESBs i've had.

A big, fruity nose full of mango and malt. Toasty bread up front followed by a substantial hop kick. Malt and caramel flavors were constant throughout, though the presence of the malt grows as the beer warms and the mouth acclimates itself to the hops.

Nose features hints of sweet malt and bitter hops, which are nicely balanced. Balance is the key word with regard to the taste, as well. Typical Rogue bittering hops are in place, but they're complemented extremely well with the inclusion of sweet caramel malt.

A mild crystal malt sweentess hits the nose as well.  The body is a bit light for an ESB.  Tastewise, however, there are a myriad of flavors.  The upfront crisp and clean hop bitterness quickly gives way to light nutty and bready malt notes.  The body is just a tad thin.  Crystal malt and overall residual sweetness is overpowered by the above average hop bitterness for style. Although not as balanced as some British ESB's, the signature Rogue hop character coupled with tasty malt flavors makes this a fine and highly drinkable brew.  Yum.","marc77","May 09, 2002"
