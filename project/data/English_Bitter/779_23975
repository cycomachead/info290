3.88,5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O. Very smooth and easy to drink. Balanced, even if a slight bit dry.","Amalak","Oct 16, 2011"
3.25,-11.7,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Not bad; a decent bitter (as the label says, a classic). Slightly sweet, with subtle flavours that blend well. But it's a bit boring - if something more exciting was on offer then I'd probably pass this over.","jazzyjeff13","Sep 30, 2011"
3.5,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Still decent enough but it ain't Adnams's Extra is it?","Zimbo","Aug 30, 2011"
3.46,-6,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Food match: I would match this with a pie or Cornish pastie, some mash potatoes with gravy (or tomato sauce) and peas. A classic English meal for a classic English bitters.","doktorhops","Aug 05, 2011"
4.22,14.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"O: A classic British bitter, pimped with an extra 0.8% ABV to suit local alcohol habits (or something like that). It's got just enough creamy caramel flavours and just that amount of body and bitterness (not too light, not too much) to be a great session beer. Now I feel like having fish and chips, or beans on toast.","stjaernstoft","Jun 26, 2011"
2.91,-20.9,4,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Flavour is citrus and hop, loads of grapefruit bitterness. Quite boozy and drinkability is compromised by this. Some grassiness and subdued breadiness. I was a little disturbed by a slight soapy taste that bothered e when I identified it. I think this is a pretty average bitter.","rjimlad","May 21, 2011"
3,-18.5,3,3,3,3,3,"A very 'meh' drink overall. I would order it again if there were no other ales but I would always choose somthing like Doom Bar over this.","CwrwAmByth","Feb 27, 2011"
3.7,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear amber-copper pour with quickly fading two finger head and nice lacing. Pretty typical English Bitter nose with lots of biscuity malt, subdued fruity herbal hops, and a strong aroma of tea and rye bread. The taste follows suit with fruity, herbal tea, and bitter hops up front, balanced nicely by solid bready, nutty, caramel malt with hints of vanilla, rye bread and a touch of metal. Smooth bitter finish and the low ABV make this pretty drinkable. I've heard a lot about Adnams and they're a solid brewery, but still nothing that really jumps out to me.","beerdrifter","Dec 18, 2010"

3.68,0,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A very drinkable brew, and a mild but pleasant English bitter. Not a very robust one, but it's nice enough.","lacqueredmouse","Aug 09, 2010"
3.85,4.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Of all the english beers I had on my recent visit to London this was probably one of my favorites. Very bright light color, good carbonation, refreshing (especially for an english draft ale) and quite a nice thing in the afternoon. Perhaps it was partially the difference between draft and cask but I enjoyed this beer all week.","david18","Jul 22, 2010"
2.98,-19,3.5,3,3,3.5,2.5,"In bottle, 28/5/13 - Raspberry nose, more red berry up front with woody hops and some chew. A very fruity bitter. Makes Fuggles palatable, though past date. I'll taste this fresh some day...","StJamesGate","Apr 19, 2010"
3.53,-4.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Overall: More than avrage bitter, but not really a favorite.","Mjoepp","Apr 06, 2010"
3.38,-8.2,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"This would have been quite good if not for the dodgy finish.","CrazyDavros","Mar 20, 2010"
4.33,17.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This bitter is easy to drink, and more or less the one I most often have in stock.","rarbring","Mar 11, 2010"
4.5,22.3,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Oh, and for those confused about the ABV... the cask version is 3.7%, the bottle is 4.5. I got this info from the Adnams website.","dionisio","Feb 03, 2010"
3.98,8.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall a very tasty beer from Adnams. Tasty but very easy to drink at the same time - could be a very good session brew.","mike130","Sep 11, 2009"
3.75,1.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The carbonation could be toned down a bit, but this is definitely a nice session beer.","BDTyre","Apr 22, 2009"
4.18,13.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: This is a great bitter. Nice mix of light roasted malts together with bitter hops and citric notes. Finishes of with a really long nice aftertaste. This one is great.","Evil_Pidde","Apr 21, 2009"
4.38,19,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A joy to hold and drink!","BlackHaddock","Apr 20, 2009"
3.58,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Something almost clashes here, but ends up with a refreshing quality. Caramelly with an herbal dryness. It does have a certain drinkable smoothness to it.","jwc215","Nov 20, 2008"

3.36,-8.7,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a dark amber orange with thick foam white head. Nice delicate hop aroma balanced by a slightly malty bacbone. Very smooth and refreshing ale with floral and citrus hops making it quite crisp. Nicely balanced with a slight dry finish.","corby112","Nov 11, 2008"
3.45,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Good drinkable brew.","tmoneyba","Aug 21, 2008"
3.16,-14.1,4,3,3,4,3,"The aroma is simple toasted malt and grassy hops. The appearance is deep amber with a medium foamy tan head. The flavor is hops, toasted malt and nuts and some toffee. The palate is fitting for a bitter. The aftertaste has an astringent bitterness that reminds me of soap, otherwise its not too bad.","nick76","Mar 22, 2008"
2.5,-32.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Too thin, just pretty bad, overall.","Overlord","Jan 25, 2008"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The ""regular"" Adnams bitter - a lighter version of the estimable Broadside. Many a long night in an Aldeburgh pub and several pints of this fine bitter punctuated my university career. Dark amber and moderate sudsy head appear on first pouring. Lowish in alcohol, but not concomitantly low in flavour, malty fruity, slight hop aroma, good body, eminently drinkable.","AylwinForbes","Oct 06, 2007"
4.13,12.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Earlier, I didnt really esteem the ales of Adnams. I thought they were too chemical and dry. But I think that they have been served too cold; at circa 10° C (50° F), it really opens up.","bark","Sep 11, 2007"
3.88,5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I will try it again when I´m not having a cold.","Jonte","Mar 02, 2007"
3.9,6,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"I'm sure this is a real winner on cask. A very drinkable and flavourful bitter","cypressbob","Feb 22, 2007"
3.85,4.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is just the way a bitter should taste and feel, to my opinion.","Hammarby","Feb 14, 2007"
3.9,6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Very drinkable, session type brew.","IntriqKen","Beers"
4.15,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Finally had this beer in a pub in Hampstead. Adnams bitter is a deep and clear amber topped by a nicely formed head, lacing is scattered but nice. Herbal hop aroma is followed by a zingy sharp hop blast that is also herbal and a bit fruity. Finish is long. Tingly mouth feel, a nice beer to enjoy while relaxing and it is quite refreshing.","Mark","0"
3.12,-15.2,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Mouthfeel: medium body, pert carbonation, crisp, slight astringency","GreenCard","Sep 22, 2006"

4.04,9.8,4.5,3,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The pint went down very well and had I bought any more I would have drunk these on the same night. This is one that will definately retain a place in the beer cupboard. I would be very keen to try this on cask.","kmacphail","May 06, 2006"
3.63,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I'm not sure if I should use bitters on tap as a reference in rating this beer. I think bitters need to be carbonated but not overly carbonated like the can version I had. It kind of puts it in another style (or sub-style) so to speak. In any case, Adnams Bitter filled my glass with an inviting chestnut colored brew, lots of bubbles and some good foam. Straight out of the can it produced a smell of hops and metal. After a while it became floral too. The first taste was of sweet caramel and bitterness (ta-dam!). This was followed by a hint of licorice and dryness. Refreshing, I'm happy with it.","JanM","Mar 28, 2006"

3.91,6.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"M&D: quite smooth on the palate, albeit not without a refreshing mouthfeel, and the flavour is rather rich against its overall light body. A very very tasty and more-ish session beer!","wl0307","0"
