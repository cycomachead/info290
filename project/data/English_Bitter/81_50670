There was some foam laying on top after sitting for 20-25 with a last mouthful of beer. Aroma is ok, reminds me of Boddington's (?). It has a nice citrus-like finish but not in the taste. Feels slightly tangy, a little hoppy but not strong. Light maltiness. It is kind of like a Nut Brown ale light. Seems pleasant enough to drink on a scorching summer day, but not an outstanding beer. For summer beer, I prefer to drink a Heffe or Kolsch.","Murphious","Jul 04, 2012"

I get malts, yeast, and floral hops on the nose but there is something else offsetting the whole thing...something akin to ginger. The body is summer seasonal light and creamy. The taste has a kind of cardboard like maltiness with a more notable bitter hop finish that lingers for a moment. There are summer seasonals from other brewers that I find to be more appealing than this one. I think I will stick with their traditional nut brown ale.","puboflyons","Jun 14, 2012"
2.96,0,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty average example of an English Bitter, I don't have any experience with this style so that might not be that accurate, but I see this beer as average all the way around regardless of style. This beer had ok drinkability, it was somewhat smooth and a little crisp, but the flavors are bland and don't hold my attention, one is enough for me, I wouldn't want another one. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were the highlights of this beer and while not the best they didn't have many flaws like the other aspects of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and the taste, they were just too bland with not enough hops showing up. I don't think I would buy this beer and I can't say I would really recommend this beer, as far as summer ales go, it's not hard to find a much better one. I have had their Newcastle Ale before but I haven't reviewed it, it's a solid English beer and is a little similar to this beer, but the extra hops that they advertise really don't show up, I wasn't impressed with beer but I still think this brewery is pretty solid, I'll have to try more of their beers, but this one just wasn't for me.","StoutHunter","Jun 13, 2012"

The bottle label says “hops and glory” but I really don’t get any evidence of noticeable hop aromas or flavors. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

I feel like in attempt to make a really drinkable summer ale they fell a little short on what makes newcastle a good beer and that's the great fullness of it's flavor.

Hops have a quick kiss of bitterness and spicy flavor. Light bready maltiness peeks through right before the dry finish. The buttery tone eventually chips away at the drinkability; not half bad, but the flavor doesn’t scream summer to us, so perhaps it’s not so typical after all.","BeerAdvocate","Jul 28, 2011"

I appreciate the different flavor profile that the English hops have to offer, don't get me wrong, I love Cascades, Chinooks and the like, but it is nice to have something that is not over the top with citrus and pine once in a while.

Under 4.4% abv send me this in cans and I will tailgate before the concert or the big game.

A little concerned about having a summer ale in the depths of winter, but I can't decipher the ""freshness date"" on the label to ease my mind (or dissuade me from drinking it). Here goes. It pours a clear brass topped by a healthy finger of white froth. The nose comprises coriander, menthol, wheat, and light grapefruit peel. The taste brings more of the same, though the menthol is increased, and there is a strong sense of the white, fleshy part of an orange's peel. The bitterness is a bit in the extreme, to the point of puckering my lips (more like buckling them, like a boxer's fatigued legs). The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, I hope this was just an old batch or something, 'cause it doesn't taste anywhere near good.

3.06,3.4,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Rich and round body-wise, perhaps from a low carbonation. Relatively unflavorful on the initial sip. The swallow features a touch of hop and notable sourness. The aftertaste is blandly bitter.","smcolw","Oct 02, 2010"
3.2,8.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Taste is light peppery-leafy hops with hints of bitter lemon pulp slightly dominating throughout with light bitterness just dominating over light honey-bready sweetness with hint of buttery caramel. The hop elements and bitterness linger gently in the clean, lean finish and aftertaste. It is pretty good, a decent drinking beer but a bit thin in character and not at all complex. It is on the bitter side and slightly lacking character or malt presence to support this since the hops mostly come through in a bitter bite that has only short hop flavour as noted above.","Offa","Sep 26, 2010"

3.84,29.7,4.5,3,3.5,4.5,5,"Verdict: Newcastle Summer Ale is a solid little brew. Thoroughly British and easily drinkable without sacrificing all character, this is one of those cheerful session beers from that side of the pond we hear so much about. I was a little skeptical going in, but Newcastle's first seasonal spin-off is a welcome addition for me.","BeanBone","Sep 12, 2010"
2.5,-15.5,2,2,2.5,3,3,"Pours a bright yellow with minimal lacing and strong carbination. Sweet caramel and malt dominate the aroma. Tastes emtremely sweet and smooth with a butter and caramel taste. Flavoring does not appear balanced and is a bit off. While smooth and easy to drink, the flavors do not bode well, seems way off for a form of a English Bitter, and this a poor choice for a summer beer with so many others out there.","MA08","Aug 24, 2010"
3.57,20.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: This a pretty basic bitter. It does its job in that it's light and refreshing, while still having some character.","Rayek","Aug 22, 2010"
2.67,-9.8,4,2,2.5,3.5,3,"D - Easy enough to drink I suppose but slight hints of off flavors aren't encouraging. The vanilla seems pretty out-of-place and neither the hops nor the bitterness is large enough here.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 22, 2010"

4.1,38.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a very nice light golden color with some nice initial head and some wonderful lacing. Very nice aroma, with a nice sweet malty undertone that's enhanced by a great hop aroma -- a bit jerky and eggish. Nice taste, with a good malt/hop ratio; sweet on top with a quickly turning hop flavor that lasts after swallowing; slightly grassy and a lot of jerky in the hops. Goes down very smooth with a nice lasting hop flavor.","JamesS","Aug 09, 2010"
2.62,-11.5,4,2,2.5,3,3,"DB- This one started out with some characteristics of an English Bitter but went downhill fairly quickly. The more artificial hop and adjunct flavors took over and balance was lost. It ended up tasting like some kind of tea-soda elixir, not my kind of thing. It is fairly refreshing when it is cold but I wouldn't wanna imbibe too many of these.","cbutova","Jul 27, 2010"

2.8,-5.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"On tap at a concert at Wolf Trap. Tap choices were only this or fellow Heineken products Heineken and Amstel Light. I hadn't tried this... and It was hot and I was thirsty and had just paid twice as much as I should have for food, so I was ready for something to drink. That's about what I got. Thirst quencher. Pale gold in the plastic glass, 1/2 inch foam on top; slightly spritzy bubbles visible. No real smell to speak of, though initial taste was a hint of malt sweetness, grass and then some residual sweetness plus... well, that's about it. As it warmed, the flavor waned and was replaced by an annoying diacetyl buttery flavor (albeit faint) that kind'a ruined the whole thing. I wish I had ordered the Amstel. At least that has some balance to it. As much as I enjoy Newcastle Brown (and even have some in my fridge today), I think they missed it with this.","tugdriver7","Jul 18, 2010"

2.88,-2.7,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a pale straw color with a half finger head. The aroma is faint I get some caramel malt and not much else, maybe a hint of a hop presence. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with a slight citrus hop bite at the end. The mouthfeel is low carbonation. Overall its not a hard drink because there is nothing harsh about it, however, the taste could stand to be improved some.","goblue3509","Jul 05, 2010"

2.11,-28.7,3,2,2,2.5,2,"Newcastle Brown Ale is a decent beer, so I was interested to give Newcastle Summer Ale a try. Newcastle Summer Ale, despite its name, is NOT a decent beer. It is on par with an average American Adjunct Lager, and I don't suggest giving it a try.","Hojaminbag","Jun 12, 2010"
2.26,-23.6,3,2,2,2,3,"Pours a filtered light orange color with a fizzy off-white head. Aroma is a little sweaty/skunky despite this being in a brown bottle. Could just be some earthy hops, but it's not particularly pleasant. A bit of musty grain too. Flavor is light grains and dust with a hard finish, similar to mineral water. In fact this might actually even be malt-flavored mineral water. Kind of slimy on the finish, ultra-thin. Not a good beer.","illidurit","Jun 08, 2010"
3.55,19.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"What I did get from the tasting was a pleasant surprise. Whereas there is litte hop presence in NBA there is plenty here, as promised by the information on the packaging. A spicy Fuggles element really comes through. Mouthfeel is substantial and the higher hopping level doesn't affect the strong malt elements here. For NBA they do add corn grits as the adjunct and I suspect some here also (it is alot less noticable in NSA). The ale finshes with a crisp hop finish. At the end of the day, this ends up being a good quality bitter.","alehopman","May 29, 2010"
3.42,15.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a dull pale oranage color with minimal head, retention and lacing. Smell is of light carmel malts, faint floral and earth and a touch of chocolate. Taste is reminicient of a mild Newcastle Brown... the sweet carmel matls are there in lesser quantity and also a taste of tootsie roll like chocolate. Faint floral hoping also present. Certain sips tasted good, others muddled... a very mixed reaction. Medium bodied, under carbonated, slight aftertaste. A lighter version of the brown, decent beer that quickly wears out its welcome, a better option than BMC however.","rfgetz","May 17, 2010"
2.58,-12.8,2.5,2,2.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability -- The real reason I picked this up was that I drank so much Newcastle Brown in college that I figured I owed Summer Ale a shot, if only for old time's sake.

3.24,9.5,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,4,"Although not a real fan of Brown Ales, I liked Newcastle's, so figured their Summer Ale should be decent...WRONG. This poured from the tap to a very pale yellow, with thin white head and little lacing. Aroma was faint, but tried to be a floral and apple mix, and the mouthfeel was flat. Taste was bland, and the finish had somewhat of an unpleasant aftertaste. Newcastle should stick to the brown.","kimcgolf","Dec 12, 2009"
