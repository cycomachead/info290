"On cask in Stamford. Very smooth. Distinct fruity taste. Hints of oak. Very pleasing"

"A malty juice. Not really that fun, an average real ale."

"O: A lovely daytime beer. Very mild flavour but somewhat satisfying."

"Overall impression: typical bitter flavor, nothing spectacular. Fairly weak bodied to be honest."
"Bitter and a great example of the style with a great appearance and a nice balance throughout. There was some nice caramel malts and the hints of fruit were nice too."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, hint of citrus, hint of oak, hint of liquor. Fits the style of an English Bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hop, and a hint of citrus. Overall, average appearance, aroma, and feel."

"One of the best bitters I have had the pleasure of consuming. I definitely recommend this on cask!"

"Still under £2.00 a pint in an historic central London pub (Oct 2011), you can’t go wrong. In fact I had another half in the beautiful Princess Louise half an hour after rinsing this pint I’ve just reviewed."
"So so. Sam smith do great pubs. I love their porter and barley wine, but this is the definition of mediocrity. At best."
"Cheers!"
"O/D - High dinkability as this is tasty and low abv. A good beer with depth and interesting parts coming together as you go. A good one but nothing crazy."
"A decent enough Bitter. Certainly sessionable."
"D: Not a session beer for most due to the bitterness. But look at the name! I really enjoyed it. My favorite Sam Smith."
"A good solid ale. On-tap at The Earl of Lonsdale at Portobello Rd."
"D - Usually have three in one sitting attesting to the exceptional drink-ability of this awesome ale."
"Pours a lovely amber with a dense white head with firm bubbles from tap (Nitro, I believe, at a company pub in Oxford). The aroma has very low levels of earthy UK hops. This is a very estery beer, pears and apples. Raisiny caramel notes lead the flavor, with low levels of bittering hops complemented by low flavor hops and noticeable esters. The beer goes down smooth with a medium body."
"On-cask at The Cock in London. Appeared a hazy golden yellow with a tall white head. Eh, nice and drinkable but a bit plain. The aroma is just a sharp, sweet mellon note and a plain bready flavor. Very drinkable and it fits well into the style Worth a try is you're into Sam Smith beers - but understand, this isn't at the same level as the Taddy Porter or Oatmeal Stout."
"A splendid bitter!"
"Warning: the same beer could be very bland when served on tap, over-chilled, or dispensed carelessly, in another Samuel Smith's pub with poor bar-training and cellarmanship, though."
"Pours a clear, rich orangey-amber with a nice creamy off-white head which leaves some lacing. Sweet and fruity malts in the nose, with discernable oak notes. Not too powerful, but present. Sweet malts up front with fruity notes of pear, green apple, and peach leading to a lingering earthy hop bitterness with definite oak overtones. Lovely. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable and quite refreshing."
"Was excited to try a Sam Smith on cask, from a wood cask at that! Old Brewery Bitter was a solid copper color topped by a thin white head. lacing was smattered about and on the thin side. Sweet malt aroma is strong yet inviting. Sweet malt and hop is prevalent in a long finish. Seems well balanced and is very smooth and drinkable. Had it at the wonderful Citte Of York pub in London."
"This is ""beer from the wood"" drawn from an oak cask! An orange/ amber color with a light beige head. The aroma was lighty sweet with a hint of apple. A malty sweetness starts out on the tip of the tongue. Followed by an even smooth bitterness througout the rest ot the tongue. This is one the very few beers that are still served from oak casks. I know because I saw the Cooper making the casks a the brewery."
"Smooth and drinks well. Pleasantly light body."
"This beer had a unique taste, bitter is definitely the operative term, as this beer is very bitter. I liked it OK, but could not drink more than one in a sitting. Mouthfeel is similar to sucking on a lemon, the beer's appearance is intriguing. I wonder if this is a more popular beer in the UK, where it probably compliments the blander taste of the food there."
"This beer had a medium sized head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles.The hue of this beer was orange and it produced a decent lacing on the sides of my glass.To me it has a fruity, citrusy nose.This is definitely a bitter tasting beer.This is not my favorite style of beer; however, it wasn't that bad."
"I had this in what was supposed to be the oldest pub in London: the ""Old Cheshire Cheese"". The beer was a rich copper color. A bit of a lingering head. There was a slightly sweet maltiness to the aroma. There was as full, malty taste to this one, with a hine of bitterness coming through at the end. Very Good!"
"sit and have a plesant conversation with."
"Drinkability: I was in heaven getting Samuel Smith on tap. A truly amazing experience. This beer goes down smooth, and with the relatively low alcohol content of 4.% abv, you could drink these all night (speaking from experience). I think I paid 2 pounds 50 pence per pint (roughly $3.75), and it was worth every cent. If you find yourself in London anytime soon, check out Cittie of Yorke."
"If only you could have tasted their Museum Ale on Cask  oh, it was Wonderous!!"
"Pretty ordinary, sweet creamy mouthfeel, Ok maltiness, not much bitterness, not much hoppyness, smooth aswell and tasted very very flat, lacks bite and once again this is a bit to sweet and creamy for me."
"Had the pleasure of drinking this brew in one of the oldest pubs in London, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese. OBB as it's referred to in the UK, is not available in the US. Golden peach color with a thin layered head. Light, multi-grain bread aroma. Toasted malt, trace fruit and faint hop aroma. Lightly toasted malt is again present in flavor along with a skillfully reserved hop finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. A fine, flavorful, easy drinking bitter."
