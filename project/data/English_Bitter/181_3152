3.88,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is really nice, great sweet malty flavors and maybe some toffe, but is well balanced with a good amount of hops. Easy drinker but heavy. Im usually not a fan of bitters, but this is one of the best bitters ive had to date.","DrinkSlurm","Aug 07, 2012"

3.85,-2.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear ruby hue which leaves a two finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is sweet caramelized malts,herbal hops,a touch of dried fruits and also some sweet dark port,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied and has tastes of dark ripe fruits,sweet caramel,marzipan,sticky toffee and finished with a earthy hop bittersweetness and overall its alright and different but not my favourite example of the style.","ADZA","Sep 12, 2011"

3.5,-11.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Cask conditioned at The Hogshead pub, Ipswich. Deep amber to brown colour, low head. Moderate aroma of English malt vinegar and plums. The flavour is "dusty" malty with notes of malt vinegar and sour fruits. "Dusty" hops in the finish. OKish.","Sigmund","Feb 14, 2011"

3.8,-4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Very balanced overall, but I was a bit surprised with this being a bitter, since there is precious little hop that can be felt in this brew. A very drinkable beer, but maybe, just maybe a little bland, especially compared to Fuller's ESB for example.","dolzan","Jul 20, 2010"
3.64,-8.1,4,5,3.5,2,3,"D - Smells great but the taste really isn't the greatest and the mouthfeel really hurts this one. I remember this being a million times better when I had it out of a cask and hopefully I will be able to try it again that way to post another review for this beer. I wouldn't pick up another bottle of this but would love to try it out of the cask!","jpmclaug","Apr 14, 2010"
4.06,2.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The aroma is watery fruitiness, some caramel and bitter hops. The taste though pokes your tongue awake! Wow, lot's of flavor! Rich malt, fruit, The bitterness has a slight sourness which adds a lot of interest. The body is light/medium. The brew is super silky smooth. Very nice and very, very drinkable. I would love to have this beer available in my market.","ThirstyBird","Mar 26, 2010"

4.6,16.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Incredible how they replicated the cask-feel so well in a bottle, adding to the drinkability factor. Very well-balanced and delicious. Complex in a soft and subtle way. This is an exceptional bitter!","jwc215","Apr 29, 2009"
4.2,6.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Gales HSB now brewed at Fullers is an excellent example of an dark ale that is highly drinkible and not to heavy, but also not watery. The taste is quite strong with a slight fruit taste and also quite fruit cakey witha malty base and a slight hop kick. This is my favorite Gales beer and can be drunk all night long.","blamoe","Jun 17, 2008"
3.78,-4.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"4.5 M&4 D: very rounded mouthfeel throughout, good depth of dark malts and refreshingly bitter texture are the winners for this beer. Very very nice bitter indeed, extremely drinkable for me, especially in Autumn.","wl0307","Dec 10, 2007"
4.32,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"It's somewhat understandable why Brits are able to down pint after pint of dark ales after you've had a brew like HSB. It may be dark, but it goes down smooth and keeps you thirsty for more. Easy to quaff, and leaves a satisfying malt aftertaste. I know this to be one of the more popular bitters in England, so I can only hope that it may one day be exported to the US, to satisfy our ever expanding national beer palette.","sawbones420","Nov 10, 2007"
4.23,6.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The taste clings to your palat, this is a good beer. Glad I re-introduced myself to it, I won't wait so long between visits again.","BlackHaddock","Sep 15, 2007"
3.53,-10.9,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"Drinkability - the good flavour but mild aroma combines to give a fairly light feel to this best bitter. Nothing outstanding, however, a good session bitter for those who prefer a stronger pint","DaveUK","Jul 08, 2007"
3.2,-19.2,3,3,3,3,4,"Other comments: Bitters bore me a bit, but this one is quite nice. Smooth and drinkable. It's a shame that this brewery has been bought out by Fuller's and, consequently, might be closed down.","GreenCard","Jan 11, 2006"
3.68,-7.1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I can't make up my mind about this beer. It tastes of quality brewing but at the same time it's sort of bland. I drank it bottle conditioned. It poured in a nice amber color, it's smooth and creamy, and has a toffee taste somewhere in the background. Fruity smell. It looses most of its dynamics if served just a little too cold. Looking at the average BA score I think it's overrated. Perhaps it's better on tap?","JanM","Aug 11, 2005"
3.68,-7.1,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"I like this. Even though it's from a can I like it. It's one of the stand by ales I keep in the house... The hops are impressive, even under these poor conditions. The more I drink it the more I like it.","SteveP","Oct 31, 2004"
3.26,-17.7,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Its a Dark copper color with a short lasting head and no lace. The aroma is of raisins, raw husky grains and alcohol solvency, virtually no hops in the nose. The flavor is dominated by a bland maltiness. There is very little hoppiness even for an English Bitter. Its a very one dimensional taste. The least hoppy of all the cask bitters I tried. Some sort of burnt quality (burnt grains?) is noticeable in the finish. Not very impressive.","CAMRAhardliner","Aug 17, 2004"
4.5,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability is very high. Could sit in the garden all day and drink this beauty. A 2nd prop goes to the cellarman at The Castle in Cambridge for this well-kept beauty.","CRJMellor","Jul 08, 2004"
4.54,14.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is an excellent bitter. Simply excellent. Good color with little head. Has an excellent malt smell. The taste is very good, incredibly drinkable. Noticeable but not overwhelming hops presence. You want to have this at a nice temperature. A very good balance for a bitter. Carboniation seems perfect for mouthfeel. This has got to be one of the best session brews I have ever had the pleasure to drink. This beer makes me rethink the quality of canned beers.","GeoffFromSJ","Jun 24, 2004"
4.7,18.7,5,5,4.5,4,5,"This might be the best thing that's ever happened to a can.","cokes","Jun 22, 2004"
4.5,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bought a four pack of this at Monster beverage in Glassboro, NJ. Poured a bright and clean orangey amber brown and was topped off by a rich and creamy head of tan foam. The aroma has some metallic notes and leans more towards the sweet and malty side rather than the bitter and hoppy. Has a candy like caramel malt sweetness. The taste is full of flavor and the sweetness is dead on. The hops are there but barely noticeable. Nicely blended. This leaves a sweet butter toffee tang on the tongue. I really enjoyed this beer, although it should have been a bit warmer.","pezoids","May 06, 2004"
4.95,25,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Canned or not, this will be a staple in my fridge. A most enjoyable pint, easily one of the best bitters I've had, if not the best. I actually feel a little sad when I take a sip, as I want the glass to last forever. This is exactly what I want in a bitter, and I'm determined to track down a cask. Perhaps this is my holy grail? The only thing keeping this beer from a straight 5 review is the fact that I know it's got to be even more amazing cask conditioned. My only complaints are that I'm having a difficult time allowing it to warm, and the only place i know of that sells it is a small store in north jersey. I can't get enough. A case or two is coming home with me next time I see it.","UnionMade","Feb 08, 2004"
4.36,10.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"A slightly hazy chestnut body with deep reddish-copper highlights is topped by a good-sized head of rocky "vanilla" foam. The head holds quite well, and it leaves some very nice rings of lace throughout the pint. The nose displays an earthy/mineral (but not quite metallic) and leafy character that seems to come from a combination of both malt and hops; over a decidedly caramelish malt. The medium body is accentuated by a very fine and delicate carbonation that leaves it creamy, soft and smooth in the mouth. There's just enough carbonation to give it a little mouthfeel and bring out the flavors without becoming gassy. Very nice, and perfect for a session beer. The flavor reveals basically what the aroma indicates with a maltiness that's just as equally earthy and dusty as it is caramelish with a touch of mineral, some leafy hops, and a mild woodiness. More complexities arise, however, with a bit more investigation. There's an underlying touch of yeasty, berry-like fruitiness; and a toasty, chocolate side to the malt that becomes quite apparent in the finish. It's very well-balanced with a bitterness seems to hide itself in the shadows but continually keeps things dry without ever building on the palate. Again, it's perfectly balanced and makes for an excellent session ale. There's enough character to keep it interesting throughout an evening; a brilliant balance that makes it workable; and a low enough alcohol that you can do it at a session pace. Brilliant!","NeroFiddled","Aug 17, 2003"
3.88,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Medium brown color, large head. Aroma is nutty and malty.Toasted malt flavor, nicely hopped. Good balance. Nice flavor, large body. Mouthfeel is full and round. Smooth taste, somewhat dry. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is malty and full, very slight bitterness.","beerguy101","Aug 16, 2003"
4.47,12.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Good example of an English bitter. Seems not to suffer from living in an aluminum can.","assurbanipaul","May 29, 2003"
4.33,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Brown coloring with little head. Soft nose with a bit of light malt. Low carbonation. Toasty caramel malt in the forefront with some light hops to balance; short finish. High drinkability. Very nicely made.","doerickson","Sep 26, 2002"
3.45,-12.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Very nive english bitter, had it on cask and enjoyed it a lot, a good example of the style, lots of zesty hops, with a decent maltiness.","rastaman","Apr 14, 2002"
4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A wonderful beer to drink while kicking back, talking with the cute barmaids, and watching a pivotal playoff-implication hockey game.","Viking","Apr 11, 2002"
4.26,7.6,4,3,4.5,5,5,"Quite possibly one of the most drinkable beers on the palate, where nothing overwhelms and all is in harmony. A top-notch session beer, to say the least, and much like a cask ale in the bottle. We need more real English-style bitters in the US. I'll have to write Congress.","Todd","Apr 11, 2002"
4.62,16.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"HSB starts off with a decided hop presence (I noticed it more on tap than I remembered in bottle) and firm bitterness, with a round, almost buttery malt to complement the hops. The hops are present throughout the sip, leaving a pleasant, just shy of unbalanced bitterness on the tongue along with the lingering malt flavors. As the brew warms, the malt comes to the forefront as expected.  A very, very drinkable ale.","sponberg","Mar 26, 2002"
